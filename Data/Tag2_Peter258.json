                "content": "<p><h2><b><i>Tony&rsquo;s Old Tee</i></b></h2><p><b>I don&rsquo;t even know what this is, I just loved the concept and had to write it&hellip;sorry it&rsquo;s kinda longer than I expected :/ </b></p><p><b>Inspired by a previous post of Tony&rsquo;s old tee and the wonderful @the-mad-starker (who I apparantly can&rsquo;t tag&hellip;), please let me know if this was actually any good!</b></p><p>To others, it might seem stupid. However, to Peter, having a favourite item of Tony&rsquo;s clothing seemed perfectly understandable.  </p><p>To others, it would just be some stupid science tee with a half-witty pun printed over it. To Peter, it was so much more. It was a tee that Tony had owned for over a decade &ndash; that in itself proved that it meant something to the older man. It was the first item of Tony&rsquo;s clothing that Peter had &lsquo;stolen&rsquo; (claimed as his own), the first night that he&rsquo;d stayed the night under more than just business terms. </p><p>It was the tee that Peter now wore every morning that he woke up in Tony&rsquo;s mansion &ndash; which was becoming more of a regular occurrence, lately. It was the tee that, whenever Tony saw him wearing it &ndash; sleeves almost reaching his elbows, the fabric hanging loosely over his small frame &ndash; he would visibly melt, bringing Peter in at the waist until their chests met in a flurry of heartbeats, lips pressed to one other in a sweet, early morning kiss with aftertastes of bitter coffee and toast. </p><p>So yeah, to Peter, having a favourite item of Tony&rsquo;s clothing was nothing out of the ordinary. </p><p>In fact, Peter loved this tee so much, he would practically parade around in it. He&rsquo;d wear it to school with a smug smirk, usually hidden under a sweater or hoodie of his own, but on occasion he&rsquo;d sit in class with the tee on full show. People didn&rsquo;t think anything of it. Well, Ned wasn&rsquo;t stupid; he&rsquo;d always send Peter a knowing look (eyebrows raised and a hidden smile on his lips) whenever Peter strolled into class wearing said tee. </p><p>But nobody else would understand &ndash; why would they?  </p><p>Peter found some strange pleasure in that, which didn&rsquo;t really make sense, but the fact that he was literally wearing billionaire Tony Stark&rsquo;s old tee, pulled from the genius&rsquo; closet that morning in Peter&rsquo;s half-awake state of mind whilst Tony Stark himself stood in the kitchen below cooking them both breakfast, and nobody knew about it - well, it was a nice feeling to say the least. </p><p>Peter would always end up sat in class biting back a smile that threatened to spread across his face whenever he thought back to those moments. </p><p>There had been the awkward encounter with Aunt May, when she&rsquo;d gone to grab his dirty laundry and found the tee sprawled by the bottom of his bed. Once she&rsquo;d noticed it, she&rsquo;d questioned him because &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember seeing this before?&rsquo;. Peter had blushed, grabbing the tee and trying to hide it &ndash; despite the fact that Aunt May had no way of knowing who it actually belonged to. </p><p>She&rsquo;d tutted, rolling her eyes as she took it from his hands muttering about how she didn&rsquo;t care if it was someone else&rsquo;s, but it smelt and it needed a wash. </p><p>MJ, much like Ned, wasn&rsquo;t as oblivious as Aunt May, however. Peter had gone round to her place for a movie marathon with her and Ned &ndash; getting there first, of course &ndash; and he&rsquo;d been wearing the tee. It&rsquo;d been a couple days since he&rsquo;d seen Tony; the older man had been called away on some small mission with the Avengers and &ndash; no matter how much Peter insisted &ndash; Tony argued against allowing Peter to join. Peter had only stopped arguing after Tony admitted that he just wanted to keep &lsquo;his boy&rsquo; safe as best as he could, leaning down to press his lips to Peter&rsquo;s, calloused fingers running over his smooth jaw and keeping him steady. </p><p>The musky, pine and almond scent of Tony still lingered in the fabric (he hadn&rsquo;t even worn the tee since Peter claimed it as his, but it gathered the older man&rsquo;s scent from spending most of it&rsquo;s time surrounded by his other clothes). Peter inhaled the addictive aroma, eyes slipping closed momentarily.  </p><p>When he finally opened them back up to the present, he found MJ watching him with an almost pitying smile. He tried to shrug it off but he knew there was no point, and so he sat beside MJ on her couch, pulling the tee incredibly closer to himself in the hopes that it would bring Tony home quicker.  </p><p>MJ didn&rsquo;t even say anything, simply nudging him gently with her shoulder and sending him a soft smile before switching on the TV and shouting at Ned (who had just arrived) to hurry his ass up and sit down. </p><p>The funny part of Peter parading around in Tony&rsquo;s tee, wearing it like some sort of badge-of-honour with a proud smile, was the affect that it also had on Tony. Peter never noticed it, but that was probably because he wasn&rsquo;t really looking for anything. </p><p>Tony would smile over the top of his morning mug of coffee at Peter&rsquo;s small body looking practically lost inside his old tee, hair ruffled (both from the previous night&rsquo;s events and simply the younger&rsquo;s habit of fidgeting in his sleep), eyes half-lidded and a cute smile on his lips. He looked delicate. Fragile, almost. A whole world away from the brave Spider-Man who spent his free time helping strangers. </p><p>Tony saw the happy glint in Peter&rsquo;s eyes whenever he wore the tee, saw how the boy hugged the fabric closer to his body and breathed in it&rsquo;s scent &ndash; something of which caused Tony&rsquo;s insides to do uncontrollable flips. He never understood it, he just knew that it brought a smile to his face. </p><p>And perhaps Tony didn&rsquo;t try to hide his feelings; there had been an embarrassing encounter during a set-up with a few of the Avengers, in which Peter had strolled in from the other room wearing the oversized tee and leggings of all things (God, this boy drove Tony crazy), earphones in as he hummed away to some popular song and grabbed an orange juice from the fridge.

As much as the mercenary&rsquo;s humor and attitude got to Peter, it was a welcome change from the blandness and seriousness of his every-day life. He pulled a burger out of the paper bag and unwrapped it, tossing Wade one over his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Hungry?&rdquo; Peter asked, taking a bite of his burger.

He glanced at the mercenary to see his reaction, remembering from an earlier conversation that he&rsquo;d never been to Carl&rsquo;s.</p><p>Wade frowned as he swallowed his first bite, looking at the contents of the burger. He furrowed his brows and looked from the burger to Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Peter asked curiously. He wondered if Wade was allergic to something in the burger or something.</p><p>Wade squinted at the burger for a moment before answering, &ldquo;No onions?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh and shake his head. &ldquo;No, never had one.&rdquo; He shrugged, taking another bite of his burger.</p><p>Wade stared at Peter; wide eyes, open, hanging jaw. &ldquo;WHAT?!&rdquo;</p><p>The loud booming voice caught Peter off guard and he jumped, nearly falling off the edge of the building.

Why is that such a big deal?&rdquo; He asked, crumpling up his burger wrapper and putting it in the empty paper bag.</p><p>&ldquo;Petey, they&rsquo;re onions.&rdquo; He repeated as if that helped.

He put his hands up slowly to stop Wade, giggling. &ldquo;Since you know so much, tell you what: I&rsquo;ll try onions in something if you cook it. At your place.

Yet, it\u2019s difficult to return to a normal life when what you were once addicted to becomes addicted to you. <br/><b>A/N: </b>This is a crossover between Venom (2018) and Sam Raimi\u2019s Spiderman trilogy (2002-07)\n\n<br/></p><h2><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16255619/chapters/38092217\">( READ ON AO3 )\u00a0</a></b></h2><hr><p>The symbiote was relentlessly starved when they finally made\nsome sort of harbor a dark place where grime crawled deeper and lower than the\nrats Venom gorged itself upon, being generous, ginger. It withdrew from coating\nthe whole of Eddie\u2019s body and instead emerged like a serpent, slithering and\nbobbing as it devoured what it could while Eddie watched on apathetically. Not\nbecause he didn\u2019t care, but because it held less horror for him than it should.\nThose few days together\u2014had it been less? Whatever it was, there had been no\ntime to slow down and<i> think</i>. Here and\nnow, in the deafening silence, there was.</p><p>Without having to be told, he knew that it\u2019d known Maria.\nThey had been together for a time, and it let him access that trust through the\nhum of tension. The hum that sometimes growled. A pigeon panicked and squawked when\nVenom lunged and crushed the bird in its jaws in a sickening crunch of finality,\nfeathers and thin talons sticking from its jaws before swallowing it down\nwhole. Then, more rats. More crunching and devouring and sick noises instead of\nwhat hung in the air like a noose.</p><p>Eddie squatted on a crushed cardboard box while it ate, unwilling\nto shut his eyes lest he saw what Venom did. The blood, the viscera, a taste\nthat would make him retch if he let himself. His skin felt clammy. Oh, he\u2019d\nbeen sweating. His clothes clung to his body unpleasantly, almost like he\u2019d\nbeen dipped in water. Was it him, or Venom? He couldn\u2019t tell anymore.</p><!-- more --><p>All he did know was, in the silence, there wasn\u2019t any\ncensor. While Venom feigned like it was fully absorbed in foraging for prey,\neverything passed between them. Every badly suppressed sensation, emotion. The\ncautious relief, the tension, the anxiety\u2014those were Venom\u2019s, he thinks. Or was\nit both? All Eddie really knew was his own caution, the tension, the suspicion,\nthe\u2014oh. So, there was some overlap. Did he fear it? Suddenly, everything he\u2019d\ndone came in sharp relief and the last month had felt like withdrawal. This\u2026it\nwas like taking a hit but getting none of the high. </p><p>Being too fucking aware to drown in the weird colors, to\nsmell sound. </p><p>\u201cSo, how long are we gonna hole down here and pretend what\nhappened didn\u2019t, Ven?\u201d It\u2019s asked suddenly, tiredly, and now Venom flinches. He\ncan feel it all the way up the appendage. Like a shiver down a spine. His\nspine, Venom\u2019s? Or theirs. Regardless, Eddie sounded tired, frustrated.\nProbably not the most inviting front. </p><p>Venom slurps down the last rat. It\u2019s morbid seeing it slide\ndown his throat, and he can\u2019t stand to watch. He pressed a finger to his temple,\nexpelling a weary and terse sigh. </p><p><b>\u201c\u2026We\u2019re sorry, Eddie.\nThere\u2019s just so much we didn\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d </b></p><p>He can feel it. Like Venom is going to crumble, like he\u2019d\nblow away if he didn\u2019t clamor towards Eddie and twist around him for dear life.\nEddie wants it, too. He wants it so much he can feel his fingers twitching,\nbiceps tense like they\u2019d open up at the slightest insistence and seize the\nsymbiote in a crushing embrace. But, they can\u2019t. Not yet. Not when Eddie doesn\u2019t\ntrust it. Even if he can feel its fragility, its heart that throbbed painfully.\n</p><p>Not when he can\u2019t distinguish what belongs to whom. </p><p>\u201c\u2026Could\u2019ve asked me. I wouldn\u2019t have minded, y\u2019know. Just\nsat down and watched some fuckin\u2019 boring documentary about\u2026 I dunno, goddamn\nPlato for somethin\u2019. Freud. Those guys. Knew all about how humanity ticks.\u201d\nEddie dropped his face in his hand, digging into the hair at his hairline as he\nwatched a trickle of water run past to a storm sewer. He wanted to sleep. But,\nhe couldn\u2019t just leave things hanging like this.</p><p>A drop on his forehead. Who\u2026? Nah, it was just beginning to\nrain. He forgot how cold and dreary Manhattan could be. Glancing towards Venom,\nthe symbiote looking like the alien equivalent of a kicked puppy, the downpour\nstarting. </p><p>\u201cCom\u2019mere. I don\u2019t want ya gettin\u2019 all soaked like that.\u201d\nPutting his hood up, Venom retracted some back into his body, like ink soaking\nup parchment. The part that remained hung on the hoodie\u2019s collar and tucked\nitself beneath his chin, warm and pliant beneath his stubble. Meekly did Venom\nrub himself against his chin, which admittedly tickled. Eddie broke out in a\nquick grin and chuffed softly, which earned a relieved pause from Venom as it\ncontinued to nuzzle into his jawline. </p><p>It was a start, at least.</p><p><b>\u201c\u2026We don\u2019t want to\nend up like last time. We missed you, Eddie. \u2026We want a second chance.\u201d</b> Venom\u2019s\nwords were quiet and admissive, and totally vulnerable. He could feel a\ntightness in his chest that wasn\u2019t his own. </p><p>Eddie nodded, a thoughtful silence descending even as he got\nsoaked, rain dripping from the lip of his hood. \u201cI wanna trust you, Ven. I do,\nit\u2019s just\u2014 \u2026Funny. How people all over the world lead these fuckin\u2019 lonely\nlives. Top brass. Lowest scum. And everyone in between who doesn\u2019t have anyone\nto understand them. Not in the way they wish they could. Boy, if they knew the\ndamn cost of it all.\u201d Venom filled a side of Eddie\u2019s hoodie, nuzzling\nyearningly into the blond\u2019s cheek and rubbing affectionately. Absently, he\ngrazed his lips against the symbiote that began purring deeply. \u201cAnd now, I got\nit. Y\u2019think it wouldn\u2019t be this fuckin\u2019 complicated, sharing headspace an\u2019 all.\u201d\n</p><p>Venom breathed softly against Eddie\u2019s neck, pressing into\nhis pulse. <b>\u201cYou were kind to her. We saw\nit through her eyes. You were a good friend.\u201d</b></p><p>Eddie swallowed thickly. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed hoarsely, voice\ncracking huskily, feeling his eyes mist wetly. \u201cToo bad she ain\u2019t here to say\nso. <i>Fuck</i>\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real hard guy to track down, Brock. Guess I\u2019m\nlucky you didn\u2019t get very far.\u201d</p><p>Eddie reared to stand and upset whatever water had been\naccumulating on him, like a statue suddenly come to life, perched over a gloomy\nautumn fountain and under a funeral shroud sky. There was the red. Red he\nremembered. But somehow shouldn\u2019t but did. Spiderman. He\u2019d seen him before in\nthe papers, but that red looked different in person. Realer. Too vivid for a\ndark city. </p><p>\u201cSpiderman? Th\u2019 hell\u2019re you doin\u2019 here?\u201d Eddie asked in\nsurprise, Venom having vanished at the right time.</p><p>\u201cEnough of the talk. You\u2019ve got the symbiote, Brock. A lot\nof people are gonna get hurt if you don\u2019t give it up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat, is there a crime against loiterin\u2019 in alleyways? Or\nare ya suddenly an avenger for fuckin\u2019 vermin?\u201d the blond demanded\nincredulously, those inscrutable opaque lenses making it impossible to tell\nwhat the vigilante was thinking. He could feel Vernom\u2019s trepidation evolve into\nsomething malicious, tenebrous shadow building behind him like a nascent forest\nfire. </p><p><b>\u201c<i>Spiderman</i>!\u201d</b> Venom seethed menacingly, claws curling and fangs\nbared menacingly. Its eyes narrowed to slits, Eddie feeling its inky substance\ncreep up his skin and over his clothes. So, it was really coming to that? That\nthey\u2019d be the villains jumping innocent people in dark alleyways?</p><p>Spiderman poised himself to attack, reflexively wheeling a\nstep back when Venom\u2019s form grew like a cloud, sucking Eddie into that familiar\nblack mist. \u201cWait\u2014you two know each other?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBoy, I wish it was just a mutual acquaintanceship, but I\nwouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t know what a threat that thing is, Brock. And you\u2019re\nin danger if you keep using it!\u201d Spiderman proclaimed in a truer accusation. \u201cYou\nhave no idea what this thing is really capable of.\u201d</p><p>The cogs in Eddie\u2019s brain began turning. \u201cWait\u2014so you were\nthe schmuck who handed Ven over to those exploitive creeps?!\u201d Anger. There it\nwas. Like finding a pilot light beneath a tank of petrol and lighting it. There\nwas an emotion he didn\u2019t mind sharing for once. And it was symbiotic between\nthem. </p><p>A rumbling noise interrupted what the two were saying. <b>\u201cI bonded with him temporarily, Eddie.\nBecause\u2026I missed it. I missed <i>us</i>.\nSpiderman treated us like another suit. It lasted for a few days before a Dr. Richard\nReeds parted us.\u201d </b>The hiss it uttered was low and banal, burgeoning with\nresentment. And now, of course Spiderman wanted to do the right thing and put\nthem on the slaughterhouse floor they liked to call justice. <b>\u201cWe\u2019re a<i>\nmonster</i> to him, Eddie.\u201d</b></p><p>Whatever had gone on between them suddenly didn\u2019t matter.\nSpiderman acted on impulse and slung his webbing on two dumpsters and hauled\nthem back manfully, both metal cannisters careening and bouncing roughly on\nconcrete before Venom enveloped him completely, like drowning in those 20,000\nleagues under the sea without a submarine. It was familiar, like a womb. They were\none again. </p><p><b>\u201cYOU HURT US!\u201d</b>\nVenom roared as it caught one of the dumpsters and pitched it at Spiderman who\nreflexively leaped over it. <b>\u201cAnd now\u2014you\nthreatened to hurt Eddie! <i>We\u2019ll never\nforgive you</i>!\u201d </b>It was less heartbreak here and more a possessive and\nrighteous anger. At least, righteous to <i>them</i>.\nHere, in the darkness, everything felt right. Only Spiderman was wrong. He\nwould never part them!</p><p>\u201cBrock, if you\u2019re in here, listen to me: I know how it\nfeels! It feels great, at first. But this\u2026this <i>thing</i>, it\u2019s leeching on everything wrong! It makes it worse and\u2014\u201d Venom\nroared indignantly and tore the other dumpster in two, leaping to bear the\nweight on its blow that Spiderman barely avoided, vaulting into the air several\nfeet up and racing up the side of the building. \u201c\u2014It\u2019s going to ruin you if you\nkeep this up!\u201d </p><p><b>\u201cSHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT\nUP!\u201d</b> Venom roared furiously, its own webbing soaring its body into the sky\nas it gave chase to Spiderman who took off in hot pursuit of a place\npredictably further away from civilians. <b>\u201cWe\nwon\u2019t let you or anyone else separate us ever again!\u201d</b> Rage. The white-hot,\npoetic rage that would make the stars tremble. A romantic rage of tortured\npoets who saw the futility of gray skies and death. It was here, raw and\nmaligned. Except towards Eddie. Despite everything, nothing could make it hurt\nEddie. </p><p><i>His Eddie. </i></p><p>Spiderman landed squarely against the side of a warehouse,\npractically soundless. He couldn\u2019t let innocent people get hurt, but inside no\none was there in the charge of shifts. Maybe it\u2019d cause damage, but all he\ncared about was the preservation of life. Not lost assets. </p><p>Adroitly did he use his webbing to open a narrow enough\nwindow near the roof and catapult his way through it, assessing his\nsurroundings in the blink of an eye. The stacks were at least a few stories\nhigh, enough to provide ammunition against the symbiote. And\u2014speakers! </p><p>Venom rocketed through the same window with a loud violence,\nstruggling to squeeze through compared to the slender Spider. Glass shards\nrained as it landed heavily, a shake in the air as its tongue tasted the air. <b>\u201cWe can hear you, little spider! Climbing higher\nup the water spout, ha!\u201d</b> the symbiote taunted, arrogance rife in its very\nveins. It stalked the long avenues of boxes and paraphernalia, Spiderman high\naloft and studying its movements. </p><p>Wait\u2014were those exhaust vents? And tankards of gas.</p><p>That gave him an idea. </p><p>\u201cHey, ugly! Over here!\u201d The jeer got Venom\u2019s attention, the\nsymbiote snarling as it propelled itself upwards and swung through the rafters,\njust rows away from Spiderman. The masked arachnid dropped down when Venom\nbarreled through and came too close, landing deftly on his feet before he found\nthe exhaust vents. It was natural gas\u2014perfect! </p><p>Venom waited for a brief moment, scenting the air for Peter.\nQuietly, and as swiftly as he could, he knocked off the spouts of two of the\ntwo natural gas tanks and a high pennywhistle of air pitched and already the\nstench of natural gas flooded the room. Booking it from the narrow office, he\nstood before and where Venom could see him. Luckily, the office\u2019s doors looked\nsturdy and all but one entrance were locked, as there was only one way in or\nout. </p><p>\u201cLooking for me? Guess we\u2019re like the tortoise and the hare\nhere, aren\u2019t we, big guy?\u201d </p><p>Already with a thin pride as it was, Venom snapped and\ndevolved into a galloping morass of oily sludge as it raced towards him, Peter\nrunning headlong towards it as if embracing death. Except, he wasn\u2019t. The smell\nof gasoline was acrid and likely set to implode at any minute. </p><p>At the last second did Peter dive aside while Venom barreled\nheedlessly into the office, ramming into several desks and overturning them in\nthe process. Papers upset by the collision created a hail of white, obscuring\ntheir view while Peter locked the office shut with the fumes pent up inside,\nusing his webbing to topple a row of shelving that landed cacophonously and\nshed its merchandise to effectively lock the pair inside, hauling it with\ninhuman strength to barricade the windowless room shut. </p><p>Feeling the very air shimmer with heat, Peter launched\nhimself skyward and propelled himself by slinging through the skylight, willing\nthat he was right and no one else was around to get hurt.

He couldn\u2019t tell anymore.</p>[[MORE]]<p>All he did know was, in the silence, there wasn\u2019t any\ncensor. While Venom feigned like it was fully absorbed in foraging for prey,\neverything passed between them. Every badly suppressed sensation, emotion. The\ncautious relief, the tension, the anxiety\u2014those were Venom\u2019s, he thinks. Or was\nit both? All Eddie really knew was his own caution, the tension, the suspicion,\nthe\u2014oh. So, there was some overlap. Did he fear it? Suddenly, everything he\u2019d\ndone came in sharp relief and the last month had felt like withdrawal. This\u2026it\nwas like taking a hit but getting none of the high. </p><p>Being too fucking aware to drown in the weird colors, to\nsmell sound. </p><p>\u201cSo, how long are we gonna hole down here and pretend what\nhappened didn\u2019t, Ven?\u201d It\u2019s asked suddenly, tiredly, and now Venom flinches. He\ncan feel it all the way up the appendage. Like a shiver down a spine. His\nspine, Venom\u2019s? Or theirs. Regardless, Eddie sounded tired, frustrated.\nProbably not the most inviting front. </p><p>Venom slurps down the last rat. It\u2019s morbid seeing it slide\ndown his throat, and he can\u2019t stand to watch. He pressed a finger to his temple,\nexpelling a weary and terse sigh. </p><p><b>\u201c\u2026We\u2019re sorry, Eddie.\nThere\u2019s just so much we didn\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d </b></p><p>He can feel it. Like Venom is going to crumble, like he\u2019d\nblow away if he didn\u2019t clamor towards Eddie and twist around him for dear life.\nEddie wants it, too. He wants it so much he can feel his fingers twitching,\nbiceps tense like they\u2019d open up at the slightest insistence and seize the\nsymbiote in a crushing embrace. But, they can\u2019t. Not yet. Not when Eddie doesn\u2019t\ntrust it. Even if he can feel its fragility, its heart that throbbed painfully.\n</p><p>Not when he can\u2019t distinguish what belongs to whom. </p><p>\u201c\u2026Could\u2019ve asked me. I wouldn\u2019t have minded, y\u2019know. Just\nsat down and watched some fuckin\u2019 boring documentary about\u2026 I dunno, goddamn\nPlato for somethin\u2019. Freud. Those guys. Knew all about how humanity ticks.\u201d\nEddie dropped his face in his hand, digging into the hair at his hairline as he\nwatched a trickle of water run past to a storm sewer. He wanted to sleep. But,\nhe couldn\u2019t just leave things hanging like this.</p><p>A drop on his forehead. Who\u2026? Nah, it was just beginning to\nrain. He forgot how cold and dreary Manhattan could be. Glancing towards Venom,\nthe symbiote looking like the alien equivalent of a kicked puppy, the downpour\nstarting. </p><p>\u201cCom\u2019mere. I don\u2019t want ya gettin\u2019 all soaked like that.\u201d\nPutting his hood up, Venom retracted some back into his body, like ink soaking\nup parchment. The part that remained hung on the hoodie\u2019s collar and tucked\nitself beneath his chin, warm and pliant beneath his stubble. Meekly did Venom\nrub himself against his chin, which admittedly tickled. Eddie broke out in a\nquick grin and chuffed softly, which earned a relieved pause from Venom as it\ncontinued to nuzzle into his jawline. </p><p>It was a start, at least.</p><p><b>\u201c\u2026We don\u2019t want to\nend up like last time. We missed you, Eddie. \u2026We want a second chance.\u201d</b> Venom\u2019s\nwords were quiet and admissive, and totally vulnerable. He could feel a\ntightness in his chest that wasn\u2019t his own. </p><p>Eddie nodded, a thoughtful silence descending even as he got\nsoaked, rain dripping from the lip of his hood. \u201cI wanna trust you, Ven. I do,\nit\u2019s just\u2014 \u2026Funny. How people all over the world lead these fuckin\u2019 lonely\nlives. Top brass. Lowest scum. And everyone in between who doesn\u2019t have anyone\nto understand them. Not in the way they wish they could. Boy, if they knew the\ndamn cost of it all.\u201d Venom filled a side of Eddie\u2019s hoodie, nuzzling\nyearningly into the blond\u2019s cheek and rubbing affectionately. Absently, he\ngrazed his lips against the symbiote that began purring deeply. \u201cAnd now, I got\nit. Y\u2019think it wouldn\u2019t be this fuckin\u2019 complicated, sharing headspace an\u2019 all.\u201d\n</p><p>Venom breathed softly against Eddie\u2019s neck, pressing into\nhis pulse. <b>\u201cYou were kind to her. We saw\nit through her eyes. You were a good friend.\u201d</b></p><p>Eddie swallowed thickly. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed hoarsely, voice\ncracking huskily, feeling his eyes mist wetly. \u201cToo bad she ain\u2019t here to say\nso. <i>Fuck</i>\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real hard guy to track down, Brock. Guess I\u2019m\nlucky you didn\u2019t get very far.\u201d</p><p>Eddie reared to stand and upset whatever water had been\naccumulating on him, like a statue suddenly come to life, perched over a gloomy\nautumn fountain and under a funeral shroud sky. There was the red. Red he\nremembered. But somehow shouldn\u2019t but did. Spiderman. He\u2019d seen him before in\nthe papers, but that red looked different in person. Realer. Too vivid for a\ndark city. </p><p>\u201cSpiderman? Th\u2019 hell\u2019re you doin\u2019 here?\u201d Eddie asked in\nsurprise, Venom having vanished at the right time.</p><p>\u201cEnough of the talk. You\u2019ve got the symbiote, Brock. A lot\nof people are gonna get hurt if you don\u2019t give it up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat, is there a crime against loiterin\u2019 in alleyways? Or\nare ya suddenly an avenger for fuckin\u2019 vermin?\u201d the blond demanded\nincredulously, those inscrutable opaque lenses making it impossible to tell\nwhat the vigilante was thinking. He could feel Vernom\u2019s trepidation evolve into\nsomething malicious, tenebrous shadow building behind him like a nascent forest\nfire. </p><p><b>\u201c<i>Spiderman</i>!\u201d</b> Venom seethed menacingly, claws curling and fangs\nbared menacingly. Its eyes narrowed to slits, Eddie feeling its inky substance\ncreep up his skin and over his clothes. So, it was really coming to that? That\nthey\u2019d be the villains jumping innocent people in dark alleyways?</p><p>Spiderman poised himself to attack, reflexively wheeling a\nstep back when Venom\u2019s form grew like a cloud, sucking Eddie into that familiar\nblack mist. \u201cWait\u2014you two know each other?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBoy, I wish it was just a mutual acquaintanceship, but I\nwouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t know what a threat that thing is, Brock. And you\u2019re\nin danger if you keep using it!\u201d Spiderman proclaimed in a truer accusation. \u201cYou\nhave no idea what this thing is really capable of.\u201d</p><p>The cogs in Eddie\u2019s brain began turning. \u201cWait\u2014so you were\nthe schmuck who handed Ven over to those exploitive creeps?!\u201d Anger. There it\nwas. Like finding a pilot light beneath a tank of petrol and lighting it. There\nwas an emotion he didn\u2019t mind sharing for once. And it was symbiotic between\nthem. </p><p>A rumbling noise interrupted what the two were saying. <b>\u201cI bonded with him temporarily, Eddie.\nBecause\u2026I missed it. I missed <i>us</i>.\nSpiderman treated us like another suit. It lasted for a few days before a Dr. Richard\nReeds parted us.\u201d </b>The hiss it uttered was low and banal, burgeoning with\nresentment. And now, of course Spiderman wanted to do the right thing and put\nthem on the slaughterhouse floor they liked to call justice. <b>\u201cWe\u2019re a<i>\nmonster</i> to him, Eddie.\u201d</b></p><p>Whatever had gone on between them suddenly didn\u2019t matter.\nSpiderman acted on impulse and slung his webbing on two dumpsters and hauled\nthem back manfully, both metal cannisters careening and bouncing roughly on\nconcrete before Venom enveloped him completely, like drowning in those 20,000\nleagues under the sea without a submarine. It was familiar, like a womb. They were\none again. </p><p><b>\u201cYOU HURT US!\u201d</b>\nVenom roared as it caught one of the dumpsters and pitched it at Spiderman who\nreflexively leaped over it. <b>\u201cAnd now\u2014you\nthreatened to hurt Eddie! <i>We\u2019ll never\nforgive you</i>!\u201d </b>It was less heartbreak here and more a possessive and\nrighteous anger. At least, righteous to <i>them</i>.\nHere, in the darkness, everything felt right. Only Spiderman was wrong. He\nwould never part them!</p><p>\u201cBrock, if you\u2019re in here, listen to me: I know how it\nfeels! It feels great, at first. But this\u2026this <i>thing</i>, it\u2019s leeching on everything wrong! It makes it worse and\u2014\u201d Venom\nroared indignantly and tore the other dumpster in two, leaping to bear the\nweight on its blow that Spiderman barely avoided, vaulting into the air several\nfeet up and racing up the side of the building. \u201c\u2014It\u2019s going to ruin you if you\nkeep this up!\u201d </p><p><b>\u201cSHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT\nUP!\u201d</b> Venom roared furiously, its own webbing soaring its body into the sky\nas it gave chase to Spiderman who took off in hot pursuit of a place\npredictably further away from civilians. <b>\u201cWe\nwon\u2019t let you or anyone else separate us ever again!\u201d</b> Rage. The white-hot,\npoetic rage that would make the stars tremble. A romantic rage of tortured\npoets who saw the futility of gray skies and death. It was here, raw and\nmaligned. Except towards Eddie. Despite everything, nothing could make it hurt\nEddie. </p><p><i>His Eddie. </i></p><p>Spiderman landed squarely against the side of a warehouse,\npractically soundless. He couldn\u2019t let innocent people get hurt, but inside no\none was there in the charge of shifts. Maybe it\u2019d cause damage, but all he\ncared about was the preservation of life. Not lost assets. </p><p>Adroitly did he use his webbing to open a narrow enough\nwindow near the roof and catapult his way through it, assessing his\nsurroundings in the blink of an eye. The stacks were at least a few stories\nhigh, enough to provide ammunition against the symbiote. And\u2014speakers! </p><p>Venom rocketed through the same window with a loud violence,\nstruggling to squeeze through compared to the slender Spider. Glass shards\nrained as it landed heavily, a shake in the air as its tongue tasted the air. <b>\u201cWe can hear you, little spider! Climbing higher\nup the water spout, ha!\u201d</b> the symbiote taunted, arrogance rife in its very\nveins. It stalked the long avenues of boxes and paraphernalia, Spiderman high\naloft and studying its movements. </p><p>Wait\u2014were those exhaust vents? And tankards of gas.</p><p>That gave him an idea. </p><p>\u201cHey, ugly! Over here!\u201d The jeer got Venom\u2019s attention, the\nsymbiote snarling as it propelled itself upwards and swung through the rafters,\njust rows away from Spiderman. The masked arachnid dropped down when Venom\nbarreled through and came too close, landing deftly on his feet before he found\nthe exhaust vents. It was natural gas\u2014perfect! </p><p>Venom waited for a brief moment, scenting the air for Peter.\nQuietly, and as swiftly as he could, he knocked off the spouts of two of the\ntwo natural gas tanks and a high pennywhistle of air pitched and already the\nstench of natural gas flooded the room. Booking it from the narrow office, he\nstood before and where Venom could see him. Luckily, the office\u2019s doors looked\nsturdy and all but one entrance were locked, as there was only one way in or\nout. </p><p>\u201cLooking for me? Guess we\u2019re like the tortoise and the hare\nhere, aren\u2019t we, big guy?\u201d </p><p>Already with a thin pride as it was, Venom snapped and\ndevolved into a galloping morass of oily sludge as it raced towards him, Peter\nrunning headlong towards it as if embracing death. Except, he wasn\u2019t. The smell\nof gasoline was acrid and likely set to implode at any minute. </p><p>At the last second did Peter dive aside while Venom barreled\nheedlessly into the office, ramming into several desks and overturning them in\nthe process. Papers upset by the collision created a hail of white, obscuring\ntheir view while Peter locked the office shut with the fumes pent up inside,\nusing his webbing to topple a row of shelving that landed cacophonously and\nshed its merchandise to effectively lock the pair inside, hauling it with\ninhuman strength to barricade the windowless room shut. </p><p>Feeling the very air shimmer with heat, Peter launched\nhimself skyward and propelled himself by slinging through the skylight, willing\nthat he was right and no one else was around to get hurt. He raced away as fast\nas his webs could take him, several blocks so before an explosion rocked the\nair and he was sundered to skid to a stop on a sidewalk, the silent night\nbrightening hellishly as an inferno erupted and plumes of smoke roiled\nenormously and black into that grey sky, dying it sable. </p><p>Peter coughed and groaned softly, rolling on his back as he\nslowly got himself back on his feet, wiping away a skid mark of dirt on his\nmask. </p><p>Police and fire engines raced past, a cold breeze of their\nspeeding coloring the night that same, vivid red. So different from the\nviolence several blocks away, the vigilante\u2019s heart heavy with a deep regret. </p><p>He didn\u2019t like it when people died. Especially people who\ndidn\u2019t know what they\u2019d gotten themselves into, but what choice did he have?\nPeter watched on as people slowly emerged from their homes, bundling themselves\nin coats and shawls as they gossiped worriedly for the flames licking the sky. </p><p>Peter bowed his head. </p><p>He had to get home. His Aunt May would be wondering where he\nwas. Especially after all of this. </p>",

The\ncautious relief, the tension, the anxiety\u2014those were Venom\u2019s, he thinks. Or was\nit both? All Eddie really knew was his own caution, the tension, the suspicion,\nthe\u2014oh. So, there was some overlap. Did he fear it? Suddenly, everything he\u2019d\ndone came in sharp relief and the last month had felt like withdrawal. This\u2026it\nwas like taking a hit but getting none of the high. </p><p>Being too fucking aware to drown in the weird colors, to\nsmell sound. </p><p>\u201cSo, how long are we gonna hole down here and pretend what\nhappened didn\u2019t, Ven?\u201d It\u2019s asked suddenly, tiredly, and now Venom flinches. He\ncan feel it all the way up the appendage. Like a shiver down a spine. His\nspine, Venom\u2019s? Or theirs. Regardless, Eddie sounded tired, frustrated.\nProbably not the most inviting front. </p><p>Venom slurps down the last rat. It\u2019s morbid seeing it slide\ndown his throat, and he can\u2019t stand to watch. He pressed a finger to his temple,\nexpelling a weary and terse sigh. </p><p><b>\u201c\u2026We\u2019re sorry, Eddie.\nThere\u2019s just so much we didn\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d </b></p><p>He can feel it. Like Venom is going to crumble, like he\u2019d\nblow away if he didn\u2019t clamor towards Eddie and twist around him for dear life.\nEddie wants it, too. He wants it so much he can feel his fingers twitching,\nbiceps tense like they\u2019d open up at the slightest insistence and seize the\nsymbiote in a crushing embrace. But, they can\u2019t. Not yet. Not when Eddie doesn\u2019t\ntrust it. Even if he can feel its fragility, its heart that throbbed painfully.\n</p><p>Not when he can\u2019t distinguish what belongs to whom. </p><p>\u201c\u2026Could\u2019ve asked me. I wouldn\u2019t have minded, y\u2019know. Just\nsat down and watched some fuckin\u2019 boring documentary about\u2026 I dunno, goddamn\nPlato for somethin\u2019. Freud. Those guys. Knew all about how humanity ticks.\u201d\nEddie dropped his face in his hand, digging into the hair at his hairline as he\nwatched a trickle of water run past to a storm sewer. He wanted to sleep. But,\nhe couldn\u2019t just leave things hanging like this.</p><p>A drop on his forehead. Who\u2026? Nah, it was just beginning to\nrain. He forgot how cold and dreary Manhattan could be. Glancing towards Venom,\nthe symbiote looking like the alien equivalent of a kicked puppy, the downpour\nstarting. </p><p>\u201cCom\u2019mere. I don\u2019t want ya gettin\u2019 all soaked like that.\u201d\nPutting his hood up, Venom retracted some back into his body, like ink soaking\nup parchment. The part that remained hung on the hoodie\u2019s collar and tucked\nitself beneath his chin, warm and pliant beneath his stubble. Meekly did Venom\nrub himself against his chin, which admittedly tickled. Eddie broke out in a\nquick grin and chuffed softly, which earned a relieved pause from Venom as it\ncontinued to nuzzle into his jawline. </p><p>It was a start, at least.</p><p><b>\u201c\u2026We don\u2019t want to\nend up like last time. We missed you, Eddie. \u2026We want a second chance.\u201d</b> Venom\u2019s\nwords were quiet and admissive, and totally vulnerable. He could feel a\ntightness in his chest that wasn\u2019t his own. </p><p>Eddie nodded, a thoughtful silence descending even as he got\nsoaked, rain dripping from the lip of his hood. \u201cI wanna trust you, Ven. I do,\nit\u2019s just\u2014 \u2026Funny. How people all over the world lead these fuckin\u2019 lonely\nlives. Top brass. Lowest scum. And everyone in between who doesn\u2019t have anyone\nto understand them. Not in the way they wish they could. Boy, if they knew the\ndamn cost of it all.\u201d Venom filled a side of Eddie\u2019s hoodie, nuzzling\nyearningly into the blond\u2019s cheek and rubbing affectionately. Absently, he\ngrazed his lips against the symbiote that began purring deeply. \u201cAnd now, I got\nit. Y\u2019think it wouldn\u2019t be this fuckin\u2019 complicated, sharing headspace an\u2019 all.\u201d\n</p><p>Venom breathed softly against Eddie\u2019s neck, pressing into\nhis pulse. <b>\u201cYou were kind to her. We saw\nit through her eyes. You were a good friend.\u201d</b></p><p>Eddie swallowed thickly. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed hoarsely, voice\ncracking huskily, feeling his eyes mist wetly. \u201cToo bad she ain\u2019t here to say\nso. <i>Fuck</i>\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real hard guy to track down, Brock. Guess I\u2019m\nlucky you didn\u2019t get very far.\u201d</p><p>Eddie reared to stand and upset whatever water had been\naccumulating on him, like a statue suddenly come to life, perched over a gloomy\nautumn fountain and under a funeral shroud sky. There was the red. Red he\nremembered. But somehow shouldn\u2019t but did. Spiderman. He\u2019d seen him before in\nthe papers, but that red looked different in person. Realer. Too vivid for a\ndark city. </p><p>\u201cSpiderman? Th\u2019 hell\u2019re you doin\u2019 here?\u201d Eddie asked in\nsurprise, Venom having vanished at the right time.</p><p>\u201cEnough of the talk. You\u2019ve got the symbiote, Brock. A lot\nof people are gonna get hurt if you don\u2019t give it up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat, is there a crime against loiterin\u2019 in alleyways? Or\nare ya suddenly an avenger for fuckin\u2019 vermin?\u201d the blond demanded\nincredulously, those inscrutable opaque lenses making it impossible to tell\nwhat the vigilante was thinking. He could feel Vernom\u2019s trepidation evolve into\nsomething malicious, tenebrous shadow building behind him like a nascent forest\nfire. </p><p><b>\u201c<i>Spiderman</i>!\u201d</b> Venom seethed menacingly, claws curling and fangs\nbared menacingly. Its eyes narrowed to slits, Eddie feeling its inky substance\ncreep up his skin and over his clothes. So, it was really coming to that? That\nthey\u2019d be the villains jumping innocent people in dark alleyways?</p><p>Spiderman poised himself to attack, reflexively wheeling a\nstep back when Venom\u2019s form grew like a cloud, sucking Eddie into that familiar\nblack mist. \u201cWait\u2014you two know each other?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBoy, I wish it was just a mutual acquaintanceship, but I\nwouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t know what a threat that thing is, Brock. And you\u2019re\nin danger if you keep using it!\u201d Spiderman proclaimed in a truer accusation. \u201cYou\nhave no idea what this thing is really capable of.\u201d</p><p>The cogs in Eddie\u2019s brain began turning. \u201cWait\u2014so you were\nthe schmuck who handed Ven over to those exploitive creeps?!\u201d Anger. There it\nwas. Like finding a pilot light beneath a tank of petrol and lighting it. There\nwas an emotion he didn\u2019t mind sharing for once. And it was symbiotic between\nthem. </p><p>A rumbling noise interrupted what the two were saying. <b>\u201cI bonded with him temporarily, Eddie.\nBecause\u2026I missed it. I missed <i>us</i>.\nSpiderman treated us like another suit. It lasted for a few days before a Dr. Richard\nReeds parted us.\u201d </b>The hiss it uttered was low and banal, burgeoning with\nresentment. And now, of course Spiderman wanted to do the right thing and put\nthem on the slaughterhouse floor they liked to call justice. <b>\u201cWe\u2019re a<i>\nmonster</i> to him, Eddie.\u201d</b></p><p>Whatever had gone on between them suddenly didn\u2019t matter.\nSpiderman acted on impulse and slung his webbing on two dumpsters and hauled\nthem back manfully, both metal cannisters careening and bouncing roughly on\nconcrete before Venom enveloped him completely, like drowning in those 20,000\nleagues under the sea without a submarine. It was familiar, like a womb. They were\none again. </p><p><b>\u201cYOU HURT US!\u201d</b>\nVenom roared as it caught one of the dumpsters and pitched it at Spiderman who\nreflexively leaped over it. <b>\u201cAnd now\u2014you\nthreatened to hurt Eddie! <i>We\u2019ll never\nforgive you</i>!\u201d </b>It was less heartbreak here and more a possessive and\nrighteous anger. At least, righteous to <i>them</i>.\nHere, in the darkness, everything felt right. Only Spiderman was wrong.

But this\u2026this <i>thing</i>, it\u2019s leeching on everything wrong! It makes it worse and\u2014\u201d Venom\nroared indignantly and tore the other dumpster in two, leaping to bear the\nweight on its blow that Spiderman barely avoided, vaulting into the air several\nfeet up and racing up the side of the building. \u201c\u2014It\u2019s going to ruin you if you\nkeep this up!\u201d </p><p><b>\u201cSHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT\nUP!\u201d</b> Venom roared furiously, its own webbing soaring its body into the sky\nas it gave chase to Spiderman who took off in hot pursuit of a place\npredictably further away from civilians. <b>\u201cWe\nwon\u2019t let you or anyone else separate us ever again!\u201d</b> Rage. The white-hot,\npoetic rage that would make the stars tremble. A romantic rage of tortured\npoets who saw the futility of gray skies and death. It was here, raw and\nmaligned. Except towards Eddie. Despite everything, nothing could make it hurt\nEddie. </p><p><i>His Eddie. </i></p><p>Spiderman landed squarely against the side of a warehouse,\npractically soundless. He couldn\u2019t let innocent people get hurt, but inside no\none was there in the charge of shifts. Maybe it\u2019d cause damage, but all he\ncared about was the preservation of life. Not lost assets. </p><p>Adroitly did he use his webbing to open a narrow enough\nwindow near the roof and catapult his way through it, assessing his\nsurroundings in the blink of an eye. The stacks were at least a few stories\nhigh, enough to provide ammunition against the symbiote. And\u2014speakers! </p><p>Venom rocketed through the same window with a loud violence,\nstruggling to squeeze through compared to the slender Spider. Glass shards\nrained as it landed heavily, a shake in the air as its tongue tasted the air. <b>\u201cWe can hear you, little spider! Climbing higher\nup the water spout, ha!\u201d</b> the symbiote taunted, arrogance rife in its very\nveins. It stalked the long avenues of boxes and paraphernalia, Spiderman high\naloft and studying its movements. </p><p>Wait\u2014were those exhaust vents? And tankards of gas.</p><p>That gave him an idea. </p><p>\u201cHey, ugly! Over here!\u201d The jeer got Venom\u2019s attention, the\nsymbiote snarling as it propelled itself upwards and swung through the rafters,\njust rows away from Spiderman. The masked arachnid dropped down when Venom\nbarreled through and came too close, landing deftly on his feet before he found\nthe exhaust vents. It was natural gas\u2014perfect! </p><p>Venom waited for a brief moment, scenting the air for Peter.\nQuietly, and as swiftly as he could, he knocked off the spouts of two of the\ntwo natural gas tanks and a high pennywhistle of air pitched and already the\nstench of natural gas flooded the room. Booking it from the narrow office, he\nstood before and where Venom could see him. Luckily, the office\u2019s doors looked\nsturdy and all but one entrance were locked, as there was only one way in or\nout. </p><p>\u201cLooking for me? Guess we\u2019re like the tortoise and the hare\nhere, aren\u2019t we, big guy?\u201d </p><p>Already with a thin pride as it was, Venom snapped and\ndevolved into a galloping morass of oily sludge as it raced towards him, Peter\nrunning headlong towards it as if embracing death. Except, he wasn\u2019t. The smell\nof gasoline was acrid and likely set to implode at any minute. </p><p>At the last second did Peter dive aside while Venom barreled\nheedlessly into the office, ramming into several desks and overturning them in\nthe process. Papers upset by the collision created a hail of white, obscuring\ntheir view while Peter locked the office shut with the fumes pent up inside,\nusing his webbing to topple a row of shelving that landed cacophonously and\nshed its merchandise to effectively lock the pair inside, hauling it with\ninhuman strength to barricade the windowless room shut. </p><p>Feeling the very air shimmer with heat, Peter launched\nhimself skyward and propelled himself by slinging through the skylight, willing\nthat he was right and no one else was around to get hurt. He raced away as fast\nas his webs could take him, several blocks so before an explosion rocked the\nair and he was sundered to skid to a stop on a sidewalk, the silent night\nbrightening hellishly as an inferno erupted and plumes of smoke roiled\nenormously and black into that grey sky, dying it sable. </p><p>Peter coughed and groaned softly, rolling on his back as he\nslowly got himself back on his feet, wiping away a skid mark of dirt on his\nmask. </p><p>Police and fire engines raced past, a cold breeze of their\nspeeding coloring the night that same, vivid red. So different from the\nviolence several blocks away, the vigilante\u2019s heart heavy with a deep regret. </p><p>He didn\u2019t like it when people died. Especially people who\ndidn\u2019t know what they\u2019d gotten themselves into, but what choice did he have?\nPeter watched on as people slowly emerged from their homes, bundling themselves\nin coats and shawls as they gossiped worriedly for the flames licking the sky. </p><p>Peter bowed his head. </p><p>He had to get home. His Aunt May would be wondering where he\nwas. Especially after all of this. </p>",

It withdrew from coating\nthe whole of Eddie&rsquo;s body and instead emerged like a serpent, slithering and\nbobbing as it devoured what it could while Eddie watched on apathetically. Not\nbecause he didn&rsquo;t care, but because it held less horror for him than it should.\nThose few days together&mdash;had it been less? Whatever it was, there had been no\ntime to slow down and<i> think</i>. Here and\nnow, in the deafening silence, there was.</p><p>Without having to be told, he knew that it&rsquo;d known Maria.\nThey had been together for a time, and it let him access that trust through the\nhum of tension. The hum that sometimes growled. A pigeon panicked and squawked when\nVenom lunged and crushed the bird in its jaws in a sickening crunch of finality,\nfeathers and thin talons sticking from its jaws before swallowing it down\nwhole. Then, more rats. More crunching and devouring and sick noises instead of\nwhat hung in the air like a noose.</p><p>Eddie squatted on a crushed cardboard box while it ate, unwilling\nto shut his eyes lest he saw what Venom did. The blood, the viscera, a taste\nthat would make him retch if he let himself. His skin felt clammy. Oh, he&rsquo;d\nbeen sweating. His clothes clung to his body unpleasantly, almost like he&rsquo;d\nbeen dipped in water. Was it him, or Venom?

It was natural gas&mdash;perfect! </p><p>Venom waited for a brief moment, scenting the air for Peter.\nQuietly, and as swiftly as he could, he knocked off the spouts of two of the\ntwo natural gas tanks and a high pennywhistle of air pitched and already the\nstench of natural gas flooded the room. Booking it from the narrow office, he\nstood before and where Venom could see him. Luckily, the office&rsquo;s doors looked\nsturdy and all but one entrance were locked, as there was only one way in or\nout. </p><p>&ldquo;Looking for me? Guess we&rsquo;re like the tortoise and the hare\nhere, aren&rsquo;t we, big guy?&rdquo; </p><p>Already with a thin pride as it was, Venom snapped and\ndevolved into a galloping morass of oily sludge as it raced towards him, Peter\nrunning headlong towards it as if embracing death. Except, he wasn&rsquo;t. The smell\nof gasoline was acrid and likely set to implode at any minute. </p><p>At the last second did Peter dive aside while Venom barreled\nheedlessly into the office, ramming into several desks and overturning them in\nthe process. Papers upset by the collision created a hail of white, obscuring\ntheir view while Peter locked the office shut with the fumes pent up inside,\nusing his webbing to topple a row of shelving that landed cacophonously and\nshed its merchandise to effectively lock the pair inside, hauling it with\ninhuman strength to barricade the windowless room shut. </p><p>Feeling the very air shimmer with heat, Peter launched\nhimself skyward and propelled himself by slinging through the skylight, willing\nthat he was right and no one else was around to get hurt. He raced away as fast\nas his webs could take him, several blocks so before an explosion rocked the\nair and he was sundered to skid to a stop on a sidewalk, the silent night\nbrightening hellishly as an inferno erupted and plumes of smoke roiled\nenormously and black into that grey sky, dying it sable. </p><p>Peter coughed and groaned softly, rolling on his back as he\nslowly got himself back on his feet, wiping away a skid mark of dirt on his\nmask. </p><p>Police and fire engines raced past, a cold breeze of their\nspeeding coloring the night that same, vivid red. So different from the\nviolence several blocks away, the vigilante&rsquo;s heart heavy with a deep regret. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t like it when people died. Especially people who\ndidn&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;d gotten themselves into, but what choice did he have?\nPeter watched on as people slowly emerged from their homes, bundling themselves\nin coats and shawls as they gossiped worriedly for the flames licking the sky. </p><p>Peter bowed his head. </p><p>He had to get home. His Aunt May would be wondering where he\nwas. Especially after all of this. </p>",

Bless you for your patience, I hope you like it :)</p><hr><p>Ned sat in an armchair and fumbled with his phone uneasily, casting an anxious glance at Peter from across the room. He raised his empty beer can to his lips again; everyone else around him was so drunk, no one had seen him slip into the kitchen and dump all of its contents in the sink shortly after having it shoved into his hands. He scrolled through his contact list again, desperate to find someone who could pick them up this late. They shouldn&rsquo;t have come, it was a mistake.<b><br/></b></p><p><i>MJ</i>. Out of town and she doesn&rsquo;t have a license either. Though he was pretty sure that wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped her.<i> Mom. Dad.</i> Nope, he wanted to survive the night. <i>May.</i> That would be even worse. <i>Peter.</i> Ned anxiously looked up from his phone, his friend was drunk out of his mind.</p><p>The night had started out promisingly enough, Flash had gotten them into their first college party as promised and no one seemed to mind their much younger company. Though Ned wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was because they didn&rsquo;t care or if they were too drunk to notice. Flash started shoving alcohol in Peter&rsquo;s face almost immediately, urging him to \u2018stop being such a pussy for once.\u2019 When the unease on his friend&rsquo;s face turned into determination, Ned knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to end well.</p><!-- more --><p>Now, Peter was sitting on a couch with Flash and a group of frat guys. Ned couldn&rsquo;t hear what they were saying over the pounding music, but when, a relatively sober, Flash pushed another cup of jungle juice into Peter&rsquo;s hand, a sick feeling nestled itself in Ned&rsquo;s stomach. Something wasn&rsquo;t right. Flash and the others hadn&rsquo;t drank much themselves, and yet they seemed to be vigilantly making sure that Peter&rsquo;s cup was never empty for long.</p><p>Ned slipped his phone into his back pocket and took another \u201cdrink\u201d from his beer as he approached the couch. Whatever was going on, he wasn&rsquo;t going to just sit there and let it happen.</p><p>\u201c-kid doesn&rsquo;t have a limit, holy shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow has he not passed out yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInitiation doesn&rsquo;t start \u2018til he does, newbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t worry, he will,\u201d Flash said, pouring what looked like straight vodka into a solo cup. \u201cI just thought he was more of a lightweight.\u201d Ned&rsquo;s stomach dropped. They were purposely trying to get Peter drunk. No, they had already succeeded at that, but his friend hadn&rsquo;t passed out yet. A chill went down his spine when he considered what they might \u00a0have planned once Peter did. He definitely needed to get his friend out of here.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had enough, Flash. Leave him alone,\u201d Ned said, reaching for his friend\u2019s arm. Flash jumped up from the couch and stood in between them, shoving Ned\u2019s hand away from Peter.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you mind your own business, Leeds?\u201d Everyone on the couch was staring at Ned, and Peter suddenly realised he was there too.</p><p>\u201cOh heeeyy, Ned. Wha&rsquo;s up, man?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI said, leave him alone.\u201d Before he saw it coming, Flash pushed him hard on the chest and Ned stumbled backward.</p><p>\u201cWhy don&rsquo;t you make me, chubbs?\u201d He felt his face redden when the guys on the couch snickered to one another. Peter&rsquo;s eyebrows furrowed, finally realizing something was going on.</p><p>\u201cNed don\u2019 worry. S'fine, we&rsquo;re jus\u2019 hangin\u2019 out s'all,\u201d he slurred, taking another drink of punch. Flash took another step forward.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Leeds. You heard him, we&rsquo;re just hanging out, so why don&rsquo;t you fuck off?\u201d Ned swallowed at the four other guys smirking at him from the couch. He was badly outnumbered, and Ned knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to put up much of a fight against them. He bit the inside of his cheek, leaving Peter here meant leaving him at their mercy, and Ned didn&rsquo;t think he would ever be able to forgive himself if he did. He could feel tears beginning to sting the corners of his eyes, Ned looked away so Flash wouldn&rsquo;t see them. He clenched his fist, if trying to get Peter out of here meant getting beaten to a pulp, then it was worth it.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The challenge was plain as day, and a dangerous glint appeared in Flash&rsquo;s eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Flash looked over his shoulder at the older guys on the couch with a devilish grin. \u201cYou hear that guys? I think it&rsquo;s time I showed-\u201d</p><p>He was cut off by Ned&rsquo;s fist connecting with his cheekbone, the force sent him sprawling backward and nearly to the ground. Flash frantically clawed at the couch to catch himself and narrowly avoided landing on Peter&rsquo;s lap. The college students howled with laughter and Flash&rsquo;s face turn murderous, Ned involuntarily took a step back. Flash charged at him, swinging wildly at his face with a speed that Ned hadn&rsquo;t expected. He managed to throw an arm up without a moment to spare, but Flash had already sent another jab downward and hit him solidly in the stomach. </p><p>Ned gasped as the wind was knocked out of him, inadvertently hunching over at the sudden pain. He heard hooting over the music, and what sounded like Peter&rsquo;s voice, but he had little time to contemplate the fact before a fist crashed into his nose. The next thing he knew, Ned was on the ground, tears blurring his vision from the pain. Flash was standing over him, smug victory plastered all over his face as he turned and grabbed something, throwing it on the floor by Ned&rsquo;s face.</p><p>\u201cHere, Leeds. Why don&rsquo;t you call your mommy and have her pick you up? Parker won&rsquo;t be needing it.\u201d When he finally got his eyes to focus, Ned saw it was Peter&rsquo;s phone that had clattered to the floor. He grabbed it hurriedly and shoved it in his pocket when Ned realized there was still one more thing he could try. </p><p>Flash had already turned back to the couch, fist bumping one of the jocks and laughing. Ned colored as he realised that quite a few others had gathered around to see the commotion, and were snickering at him. He quickly got up and weaved through the crowd of laughing college students toward the bathroom. Thankfully it was empty, so Ned slipped inside and shut the door behind him. </p><p>He cringed as he caught a glance of himself in the mirror; blood was streaming from his nose and had already gotten on his shirt. Ned grabbed a wad of toilet paper and tried to stem the flow as he unlocked Peter&rsquo;s phone. Ned smiled in spite of himself. Of course Peter&rsquo;s password was Spiderman.</p><p>He scrolled through Peter&rsquo;s contact list and prayed that the number he was looking for was there. Finally, he found it and sent a quick text.</p><p><b>Peter Parker: </b>Please call me. It&rsquo;s important.</p><p>The reply came in under a minute.</p><p><b>Tony freaking Stark \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31:</b> At nearly midnight? Kid, I&rsquo;m getting old, how do you know I&rsquo;m not in bed already?</p><p><b>Tony freaking Stark \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31:</b> Actually scratch that, who am I kidding?</p><p><b>Tony freaking Stark\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31:</b> and btw, the last time you said it was important, you just wanted to tell me about that morbidly obese squirrel you saw in central park.</p><p>Ned rolled his eyes, and tapped out a hurried reply.</p><p><b>Peter Parker</b>: Urgent.</p><p>Apparently that was all the man needed to hear because the phone started vibrating almost immediately. Ned made sure the door was locked, and he picked it up.</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s going on, kid?\u201d The joking had disappeared without a trace, and Ned was grateful.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I&rsquo;m sorry to bother you.\u201d Ned tilted his head back. \u201cBut this is an emergency-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this and why do you have Peter&rsquo;s phone?\u201d Ned cringed, how was he supposed to explain that he and Peter had thought it was a good idea to go to a college party? Let alone at Flash&rsquo;s recommendation.</p><p>\u201cUh, this is Peter&rsquo;s friend-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTed? What&rsquo;s going on? And why does your voice sound like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s Ned- never mind that doesn&rsquo;t matter. I kind of got punched, I think my nose is broken.\u201d He prodded it with his fingers and yelped at the jolt that shot through his face. \u201cNo, yeah it&rsquo;s definitely broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What?</i> I&rsquo;m going to need you to back up here, where are you guys?\u201d Ned swallowed, well here went nothing. He just hoped Mr. Stark didn&rsquo;t fly him to the top of the Empire State building and leave him there after all of this.</p><p>\u201cPeter and I went to a party, and there&rsquo;s a bunch of guys getting Peter drunk. I tried to stop it, Mr. Stark, I swear, I&rsquo;m sorry\u2026\u201d Ned\u2019s voice broke as tears slipped down his face. Why hadn&rsquo;t he tried harder to talk Peter out of going? Some friend he was.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, hang on. I need you to keep it together for little bit longer. I&rsquo;m already on the way to my car.\u201d From what it sounded like, Ned knew Mr. Stark was actually running there. \u201cWhere are you and Peter right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI locked myself in the bathroom, and Peter was on the couch when I left. Please hurry, Mr. Stark, I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, stay there. Text me the address, I&rsquo;ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><hr><p>Tony gripped his steering wheel tightly as he floored it. A rage he had never felt before was running hot through his veins. He had been angry when his mansion, along with his life&rsquo;s work, had been blown to hell off a cliff. When the plane Happy had insisted was secure, also carrying his life&rsquo;s work, had been destroyed and nearly took Peter with it, Tony had been furious. This was different, a fiery protectiveness bloomed in his chest. There was going to be hell to pay.</p><p>\u201cPete, what did you get yourself into,\u201d he muttered to himself when the house came into view. Tony didn&rsquo;t look to verify the address number, there wasn&rsquo;t any need to. There were drunk college kids <i>everywhere. </i></p><p>The house clearly belonged to a fraternity, its greek symbol sat above the front door and was plastered to several flags hanging beside it. Not to mention one of the jocks had it painted across his bare chest. Tony smiled grimly, this fraternity was going to be shut down come Monday morning. The best part was that it would only take a single letter to the dean explaining that his intern had been victimized, and he would refuse to continue making rather<i> generous</i> donations if such action was not taken. These punks didn&rsquo;t stand a chance.</p><p>Tony parked in front of the house and stepped out into the street before cutting across the lawn, toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cHey, nice car, man!\u201d </p><p>He ignored the shout and continued walking. Several of the partiers had quieted down and were watching him anxiously, suddenly aware that an adult was present. Tony walked up the porch steps and headed through the open door.</p><p>\u201cHey, what do you think you&rsquo;re-\u201d Shirtless toughguy stepped forward to stop him, but froze when he saw who was walking into his frat house. Tony smirked, kid didn&rsquo;t even know what was gonna hit him.</p><p>The music got even louder when he was inside, Tony was surprised none of the frames on the wall had fallen off at the absurd amount of bass vibrating through the house. He walked past the staircase and pushed through a group of girls in skimpy outfits toward what he assumed was the living room. That&rsquo;s where Ned had said Peter was, right?</p><p>His question was answered when a roar of laughter erupted ahead of him.</p><p>\u201cNo way, he&rsquo;s actually pissing himself!\u201d Tony shoved his way into the room and froze at what he saw.</p><p>Peter was sitting on the ground, his back pressed against the couch and a red solo cup held in his hand at a precarious angle. There was a group of jocks sitting behind him on the cushions, watching with interest, almost like they were supervising the whole thing. They looked like Grade A douchebags, complete with bad tans and muscle shirts with sleazy catch phrases in neon lettering. One of the shirts read: <i>Leg Rests</i> and had an arrow pointing at each shoulder. A much younger kid that caught Tony&rsquo;s eye, the one who had shouted, was standing in front of Peter recording. The bright light coming from his phone shined in Peter&rsquo;s face and he clumsily tried to block it with his hand.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes were glazed and he didn&rsquo;t seem to understand what was so funny, but laughed along anyway. <i>Penis Parker</i>, along with other obscenities, was written all over his face. The kid&rsquo;s belt was unbuckled and a dark stain was spreading across the front of his pants.</p><p>Tony saw red.</p><p>Spinning the face of his watch, Tony felt metal cover his right hand as he rushed forward and grabbed the curly haired rat holding the phone with the other. He yelped as Tony shoved him up against the wall, fistful of fabric clutched in his left hand. Tony hardly registered the shouts over the blood roaring in his ears, and he pointed his right palm inches from his face, the repuslor ready to fire. The kid paled, and recognition suddenly sparked in Tony\u2019s eyes. </p><p><i>Flash. </i></p><p>Just when Tony thought the piece of shit was going to faint, he pointed his hand at the booming speaker standing in the corner and fired a single blast, killing it instantly.</p><p>\u201cParty&rsquo;s over,\u201d Tony yelled, not breaking eye contact for a second. Satisfied with the screams and footsteps pounding toward the front door, Tony tightened his grip on Flash&rsquo;s shirt and pointed his palm back at his face.</p><p>\u201cP-please don&rsquo;t-\u201d Tears had already started running down his face, and he looked so terrified Tony thought he was going to pee his pants. He internally shrugged, it would be poetic justice if he did.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you give him?\u201d Tony snarled, yanking on his collar harshly.</p><p>\u201cI-I only gave him a few beers,\u201d Flash choked out, pressing his head back into the wall as hard as he could to get away from the weapon.</p><p>\u201cBull. Shit.\u201d Tony pointed the repulsor even closer to his face and the light got brighter. </p><p>\u201cOkay! Okay! I- I don&rsquo;t remember, think it was three beers, some vodka, jungle juice, whiskey, and a c-couple shots of tequila.\u201d Tony thought he was going to lose it.</p><p>\u201cWhat was in the punch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t know, I swear! Please-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was all of this, are you trying to kill him?\u201d Flash&rsquo;s eyes got even wider as tears continued to well in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo! I swear, it was just initiation for next year. I-I didn&rsquo;t want to do it, but I had to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looked like you were enjoying it to me.\u201d So it was the fraternity&rsquo;s doing. Tony kept the blaster trained on him, though in the back of his mind he knew he&rsquo;d never shoot the idiot, and looked back at the couch. The douchebags had already taken off, leaving Peter sitting on the ground. Ned had appeared and was helping Peter get his belt back on. He was crying. </p><p>\u201cYou know I could let all this get out, that Tony Stark&rsquo;s intern was nearly killed by his own classmate,\u201d Tony threatened, turning back to Flash who had managed to pale even more. \u201cNo university would ever admit you, and you certainly won&rsquo;t be getting my recommendation letter. Hell, the police might even get involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please. I&rsquo;ll do anything, Mr. Stark.\u201d The jerk was openly sobbing now. Tony didn&rsquo;t feel an ounce of sympathy.</p><p>Tony weighed his options. He could expose the punk, God knows he deserved it, but then that would create a huge mess that Tony knew Peter wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate. He glared at Flash, Tony had heard a lot about this asshole and found a deep satisfaction at seeing him blubber for mercy. This punk had bullied Peter since middle school, and had been relentless ever since. It had taken many long nights of coaxing for him to draw this information out of the kid, and whenever Peter showed up to the tower in tears, Tony knew why. He smiled, and that seemed to scare Flash even more.</p><p>\u201cOh I know you will,\u201d Tony said, lowering his hand and disarming the repulsor. He hit a button and it disappeared, collapsing back into his watch. \u201cFirst, I want the names of each and every prick who put you up to this.\u201d Flash nodded hastily, not showing a second thought about snitching on them. Tony grabbed a business card out of his shirt pocket with his free hand and let it flutter to the ground, his left hand still holding onto Flash&rsquo;s shirt. \u201cYou email me those names by tomorrow morning, or I&rsquo;m going to expose you as the ringleader, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond, I know who you are. You&rsquo;re a pathetic piece of shit that gets off on making Peter&rsquo;s life miserable. That stops now.\u201d Tony brought his face more inches from Flash&rsquo;s. \u201cIf I hear one more, just one more complaint about how you&rsquo;ve been cruel to him, all bets are off. Got it?\u201d Flash nodded vigorously. </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Tony released him and he slid to the ground. \u201cAnd if that video you took, surfaces anywhere and I mean <i>anywhere</i>, same deal. So I suggest you delete it.\u201d Flash scrambled for his phone and the business card on the ground, before hurriedly scrolling through it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it&rsquo;s gone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSmart choice,\u201d Tony said, pulling Flash to his feet. \u201cNow get out.\u201d He didn&rsquo;t need to be told twice, as soon as Tony released him he ran toward the front door as fast as he could. When he turned around, Tony saw Ned crouched beside Peter, trying to console him. Peter&rsquo;s friend looked up and Tony cringed at the purple bruising that was already starting to color his nose. He looked at Tony sadly before turning back to his crying friend.</p><p>\u201cPeter it&rsquo;s okay, this isn&rsquo;t your fault. It was Flash&rsquo;s and those assholes. Remember in health class? Alcohol is a diuretic, you couldn&rsquo;t control it.\u201d Peter shook his head and continued to sob inconsolably. \u201cIt&rsquo;s okay, man. You&rsquo;re drunk, it basically doesn&rsquo;t count.\u201d </p><p>Tony walked over to Peter and sat on the couch, placing a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNed&rsquo;s right, Pete. Not your fault.\u201d Peter kept crying, but Tony wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was the alcohol or the embarrassment talking. \u00a0\u201cCome on, kiddo, it&rsquo;s time to go.\u201d Ned helped Tony pull Peter to his feet, and he stumbled, holding onto Tony for dear life. </p><p>\u201cRoom&rsquo;s spinning,\u201d he whimpered, trying to get his balance under control.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it&rsquo;s going to be doing that for awhile.\u201d Tony helped the drunk teenager walk, while Ned kept a cautious hand on his back in case he fell. When they made it out of the house, Tony saw that everyone was gone, except for a few stragglers who watched them from a distance. Unlocking his car, Tony guided Peter into the passenger seat while Ned opened a door and slid into the seat behind his friend. Tony got into the driver&rsquo;s seat and pulled away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cUm, are you taking me home, Mister Stark?\u201d Tony glanced up to the rear view mirror and looked at Ned.</p><p>\u201cNot with that shiner. We&rsquo;re going back to the tower to get you both checked out first.\u201d Ned fell silent.</p><p>Tony focused back on the road and sped up. He needed to get Peter to the medbay to make sure the kid wasn&rsquo;t ODing, the only thing preventing him from going into a full fledged panic attack was the fact that he was still conscious. </p><p>\u201cM'ser Stark, I don&rsquo; feel good,\u201d Peter slurred, shifting uncomfortably in the seat. He had stopped crying for the time being, but Tony doubted it would last for very long.</p><p>\u201cI know, buddy. We&rsquo;re almost there, just hang on-\u201d Tony was cut off when Peter suddenly pitched forward and vomited harshly all over the floorboard and himself. </p><p>\u201c<i>Shit!</i>\u201d Tony hit his steering wheel, and immediately regretted it when Peter jumped. He coughed and tears began running down his face again. Tony sighed, he definitely should have seen that coming. </p><p>\u201cOh no, oh no, m'so sorry, please don&rsquo;t be mad-\u201d Peter was interrupted when around gag tore from his throat and sent more of the foul liquid splashing onto the carpet. He was crying hard now, fingers pressed to his mouth as if it would stop any more from coming up. Tony cringed at the splattering beside him and the smell beginning to fill the car. His heart felt heavy at Peter&rsquo;s pleading, the kid almost sounded afraid. He cursed his knee jerk reaction and rubbed his back gently in an attempt to calm him down. </p><p>\u201cShhh, it&rsquo;s alright, buddy. I&rsquo;m not mad, it was just an accident. I&rsquo;m sorry if I scared you,\u201d he said gently, guilt writhing in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cI think I&rsquo;m gonna puke again,\u201d Peter sobbed, looking around trying to find a way out.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s okay if you do, Pete. Just breathe, okay? Don&rsquo;t worry about the car, it can be cleaned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, m'such an idiot,\u201d he cried into his hands sadly. \u201cI thought he finally liked me.\u201d Tony thought his heart was going to shatter.</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t you dare say that, Pete. You&rsquo;re not an idiot, you&rsquo;re one of the smartest kids I&rsquo;ve ever met. Flash is the one with the problem, not you, kiddo.\u201d Ned shifted in the seat behind him, and Tony felt his face burn. He had forgotten that they weren&rsquo;t alone. Tony swallowed before making up his mind, he wasn&rsquo;t about to let his pride stand in the way of taking care of his kid. </p><p>\u201cWhy does he hate me so much?\u201d Peter continued to cry into his hands, making Tony wish he had beat the ever living shit out of Flash. He had seen the bruise starting to form on his face, and Ned&rsquo;s swollen knuckles made a surge of fondness for Peter&rsquo;s friend go through him. Peter looked down at the mess he&rsquo;d made of himself and whimpered. \u201cGod, m'so <i>gross</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo you&rsquo;re not, buddy. It&rsquo;s alright. I need you to calm down for me, Pete, before you make yourself sick again.\u201d He kept rubbing small circles on Peter&rsquo;s back as they drove.</p><p>When they finally pulled up to the tower, Peter sat in the seat quietly, his sobs dying down to hiccups. Tony threw his seatbelt off and walked around the car to help Peter get out. Tony&rsquo;s stomach clenched as he opened the door, nausea threatening to take over. Vomit covered Peter&rsquo;s the bottom half of his shirt, lap, and shoes, but the carpet had taken the worst of it. Not to mention his pants were still soaked and was likely seeping into the seat\u2019s fabric. Tony steeled himself, this wasn&rsquo;t about him, it was about Peter and he needed his help. The kid fumbled with his seatbelt for several moments before Tony reached over and popped it open for him. His heart ached at Peter&rsquo;s red rimmed eyes, and Tony patted him on the back. </p><p>\u201cCome on, Pete, let&rsquo;s get you cleaned up.\u201d He dragged his feet out of the car and leaned heavily against the doorframe, evidently still dizzy.</p><p>\u201cCan&rsquo;t,\u201d he whimpered, eyes closed. </p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;m going to help you, okay?\u201d Peter nodded, so Tony grabbed his arms and slowly helped him to his feet. He tried to take a step, but stumbled forward and fell against Tony&rsquo;s chest. He caught the kid just in time and wrapped his left arm tightly around Peter&rsquo;s waist, bearing some of his weight. Ned was standing beside the car uncertainly, clearly not sure what to do. Tony jerked his head toward the door.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let&rsquo;s get that nose looked at.\u201d After a significant amount of effort, Tony managed to get Peter up the stairs and into the elevator. When they staggered into the medbay, he couldn&rsquo;t say he blamed Bruce for the incredulous look on his face. He knew they must be quite a sight.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened, Tony? FRIDAY said it was important, but she didn&rsquo;t tell me much. Is Peter drunk?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHeeeeyy Bruce,\u201d Peter said, his eyes partly closed. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion. \u201cWait, why aren&rsquo;t you green? M'ser Stark shouldn\u2019 he be green?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that answers your question, Banner. Anyway, it&rsquo;s a long story. Mind checking his BAC?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Bruce said, rummaging through a drawer and grabbed a small device out before holding it in front of Peter. \u201cBlow into this, please.\u201d Peter did so, and when the machine beeped, Bruce checked the small screen and whistled.</p><p>\u201c0.18, that&rsquo;s pretty high.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs he going to be alright?\u201d Bruce let out a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOh he&rsquo;ll be fine, with his levels of metabolic activity from the mutation he&rsquo;d need about a gallon of pure vodka to overdose. But he&rsquo;ll be feeling it tomorrow, just like the rest of us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019 drink <i>that</i> much M'ser S'ark. Jus- had a few\u2026\u201d He mumbled, his eyes already drooping closed. Tony rolled his eyes and readjusted his grip on the kid.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever you say, Spiderling. Come on,\u201d Tony started guiding him out of the room. \u201cCan you check his friend out? Thinks his nose if broken. I&rsquo;m gonna go take care of drunkie, here.\u201d Bruce snapped some rubber gloves on and motioned for Ned to sit on a nearby table.</p><p>\u201cOf course. And what&rsquo;s your name?\u201d He asked as he started prodding the skin tenderly. Ned winced at the touch.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m Ned. Aren&rsquo;t you the Hulk?\u201d Bruce smiled at his obvious excitement. </p><p>\u201cOnly on my bad days. Fortunately, today isn&rsquo;t one of them or I&rsquo;m afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t be much help to you at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, that&rsquo;s so cool! What does it feel like? Are you conscious when it happens or is it like a blackout?\u201d Ned continued to excitedly rattle off questions, seemingly unbothered by his injury for the moment. </p><p>Satisfied that Peter&rsquo;s friend would be taken care of, Tony headed back to the elevators, correcting Peter&rsquo;s balance every couple of steps. As they were riding up, Tony frowned when he realised that his shirt felt damp. It didn&rsquo;t take long to register that vomit had been smeared onto his own shirt, and he grimaced slightly. He reminded himself that it wasn&rsquo;t the kid&rsquo;s fault and stepped onto the residential floor. </p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Peter asked as they made their way to Tony&rsquo;s room. The bathroom there was the largest one on this floor, and he knew they&rsquo;d need as much space as they could get.</p><p>\u201cTo get you out of these clothes and hopefully into the shower.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, m'kay.\u201d They were nearly there when Peter shifted in his grip. \u201cGotta pee.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright, hang on. Almost there.\u201d Tony quickened their pace and as much he could. His pants were already a goner anyway, but if Peter didn&rsquo;t make it he knew he&rsquo;d be crying again, and that was the last thing Tony wanted. </p><p>They had finally staggered through the master bedroom, and into the bathroom when Peter whined and crossed his legs. Knowing they didn&rsquo;t have much time, Tony had Peter hold onto his shoulders while he hurriedly undid his belt for him. He knew the kid would never make it if he tried to do it himself. When it was open, he averted his eyes before pulling the fabric down and sitting him on the toilet. </p><p>\u201cWait, m'not a girl M'ser S'ark,\u201d Peter said, confusion evident on his face. He moved to get up, but Tony steadied him with a firm hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo shit, kid,\u201d Tony said, rolling his eyes. \u201cBut do you really think standing is such a good idea right now?\u201d The simplicity of that logic seemed to penetrate Peter&rsquo;s foggy mind and he shook his head. \u201cOkay, I&rsquo;m going to step out. Call me when you&rsquo;re done.\u201d </p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t wait for a response as he left the bathroom, face burning. This was beyond weird, and he was pretty sure that this situation hadn&rsquo;t been spelled out in the internship contract he had signed. But what was he going to do? Lock the kid in a guest room and wish him luck? Hell no. Peter needed him right now, and if he was drunk off his ass, Tony knew without a doubt Peter would do the same for him. Though he prayed it never came to that, Tony was certain the mortification alone would kill him.</p><p>\u201cM'done, M'ser S'ark,\u201d Peter slurred from the bathroom. Tony came back into the room to see Peter leaning precariously to the right, and he was thankful the kid hadn&rsquo;t fallen off. </p><p>\u201cOkay, kid. Now let&rsquo;s get you out of these clothes, I&rsquo;m sure they aren&rsquo;t very comfortable.\u201d Tony knelt and started untying Peter&rsquo;s shoes while the kid struggled with his shirt. When both of them were off, he tugged his jeans and boxers the rest of the way off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019 look,\u201d Peter said, tossing the wet shirt onto the tile floor.</p><p>\u201cWouldn&rsquo;t dream of it, Pete,\u201d Tony promised, looking at the ceiling as he helped Peter stand and shuffle over to the large shower. </p><hr><p>Peter sat quietly on Tony&rsquo;s bed in fresh pajamas, struggling to keep his eyes open. It had been tricky, but he had managed to get the kid clean, though he made Peter sit under the spray of water. The last thing he needed was for him to slip and bash his head open. Tony brought a warm washcloth and a bottle of rubbing alcohol from the bathroom and sat beside him on the bed. Wetting the rag, Tony began gently rubbing at the marker off Peter\u2019s cheek. He was halfway done with his forehead, when Peter&rsquo;s face suddenly crumpled.</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s wrong, buddy? I didn&rsquo;t get any of this in your eyes, did I?\u201d A tear rolled down his cheek, quickly followed by more.</p><p>\u201cI miss Uncle Ben.\u201d Tony sighed, tossing the rag and bottle onto the comforter at Peter&rsquo;s words.</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d he said softly, his heart clenching at the sadness all over Peter&rsquo;s face. </p><p>\u201cH-he always took care of me when I was sick. Just like this,\u201d he sniffed, tears dripping onto the comforter.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter turned and wrapped his arms around Tony in a hug, burying his face in the crook of his neck. Tony returned it without a second thought and held him tightly. </p><p>\u201cShhhhh, it&rsquo;s alright. You&rsquo;re okay, you&rsquo;re alright,\u201d Tony soothed, carding his fingers through Peter&rsquo;s wet hair.</p><p>\u201cHe was jus\u2019 always there for me, and now he&rsquo;s not,\u201d he wept sadly. Tony didn&rsquo;t say anything and just held him. Hell, what could he say to that? </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Tony eventually managed, his chest aching.</p><p>\u201cBut tha&rsquo;s okay, m'not alone anymore,\u201d he sniffled.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot you now,\u201d Peter said simply before hugging him harder. Tony&rsquo;s throat tightened, if he hadn&rsquo;t been speechless before, he certainly was now. Tony figured it must be the alcohol talking. </p><p>Sure, he mentored the kid a little and let him help in his workshop from time to time, but he certainly wasn&rsquo;t a father figure. He was a terrible role model and was pretty pathetic with kids, but Peter didn&rsquo;t seem to care about any of those things.</p><p>Peter sniffled and Tony looked down at his intern that had him in a deathgrip, letting out a sigh. Who was he kidding? The kid was so much more than that, he was- well he was just Peter: a goofy kid from Queens who had somehow managed to squeeze his way into Tony&rsquo;s life. As much as he hated to admit it, Tony couldn&rsquo;t deny the warmth that began sprouting in his chest at Peter\u2019s admission. He remembered the late nights they\u2019d spent together tweaking the kid\u2019s suit, eating their weight in ice cream, and training together. Tony smiled softly to himself, he knew he definitely wouldn&rsquo;t have spent his Friday night like this for just any intern.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it looks like you do, kiddo,\u201d he said, resting a hand on top of Peter&rsquo;s head. The kid sighed contently and relaxed against him, and they sat that way for some time.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Pete, before you zonk out, at least let me get the rest of this crap off of your face. Can&rsquo;t have you looking like some shitty rapper.\u201d Peter whined at being dislodged from Tony&rsquo;s arms, and let him wipe the rest of the sharpie off. When Tony was done, the kid all but collapsed back into the bed, asleep before he hit the pillow. </p><p>\u201cWell good night to you too, Underoos,\u201d Tony snorted before making sure Peter was laying on his side in case he got sick again. Tossing a blanket over him, Tony grabbed the small trash can from beside his desk and put it on the floor next to the bed. Tony yawned and looked at his watch, it was almost three o'clock in the morning. He curled up in the armchair sitting beside the bathroom door and watched the blanket steadily rise and fall with Peter&rsquo;s breathing. Tony was asleep before he knew it.</p><hr><p>Peter cracked his eyes open and he immediately regretted doing so. The sunlight peering in through the window sent a sharp stab of pain through his head. All of his senses felt like they were dialed up to eleven, and he was pretty sure there was an ice pick being driven through his skull. His tongue was stuck to the roof of his mouth and his stomach felt like it was going to turn inside out at any moment. He groaned and closed his eyes when the room started to move.</p><p>Peter could feel acid beginning to creep up the back of his throat, and his swallowed thickly trying to prevent the inevitable. He didn&rsquo;t know where he was, and he was pretty sure whoever&rsquo;s bed he was laying in wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate him puking all over it. Tears pricked his eyes and he gagged, but thankfully nothing came up. He leaned over the bed and retched again, dreading the splattering that would accompany it as it hit the floor. But it never came.</p><p>\u201cEasy, kid. Let it out, I got you.\u201d Peter snapped his eyes back open, he&rsquo;d know that voice anywhere. Mister Stark was holding a bin up to his mouth and rubbing his back. How the hell did he get here?</p><p>\u201cWhat hap-\u201d Peter was cut off as he was sick again, though it was only bile at this point. Each heave made his head pound even harder.</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t try to speak. Thanks for the warning gag by the way, gave me time to grab this.\u201d Finally he spit the last of the saliva into the trashcan and fell back onto the bed, utterly exhausted. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgghh, my head,\u201d Peter groaned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that&rsquo;s what I thought, kiddo. Welcome to the final stage of a fun night: regret.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He asked, eyes buried in the crook of his elbow. </p><p>\u201cDoes a college party ring any bells?\u201d </p><p>Yeah, it did. Hazy images flicked through his mind, the loud music, the alcohol, Flash punching Ned, his pants getting warm, the car ride. Oh God, the car ride. His face flushed as the rest of the memories filled his head, he had cried on Mister Stark. Peter didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ever live it down.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d he groaned. \u201cMister Stark, I&rsquo;m so sorry. I was so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was pretty stupid, Pete,\u201d the man chuckled and sat on the bed beside him. \u201cBut definitely not the end of the world, I&rsquo;m just glad you&rsquo;re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I puked all over your car,\u201d Peter cringed. \u201cAnd your seat\u2026\u201d He couldn&rsquo;t get himself to say it.</p><p>\u201cEh, not a big deal, kiddo,\u201d Mister Stark waved the apology away. \u201cI have to admit, I&rsquo;ve given several of my other cars the same treatment and they survived.\u201d Peter nodded, and the man suddenly put his hand to his ear, listening to whoever was speaking in the piece.</p><p>\u201cYeah, send him up.\u201d</p><p>Peter suddenly felt all the blood rush to his feet. Flash had been recording him the whole time last night, tears began to well in his eyes again. The whole school must have seen him pissing himself like a toddler by now.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, what&rsquo;s going on, bud? Talk to me.\u201d He looked down and he felt a gentle hand land on his shoulder. Peter shook his head and sniffled. This was all so embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Pete, it&rsquo;s okay, really. I&rsquo;m not mad, everything&rsquo;s going to be fine.\u201d Peter felt a surge of anger and humiliation. Of course Mister Stark wouldn&rsquo;t understand, MJ was going to see it. Oh God, he&rsquo;d never be able to look her in the face again.</p><p>\u201cNo it&rsquo;s not! Flash-\u201d Peter struggled with himself for a few moments, the anger was suddenly replaced with despair. \u201cEveryone&rsquo;s gonna know,\u201d he finally choked out. He could not, for the life of him, fathom why Mister Stark suddenly started laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you won&rsquo;t have to worry about that. Actually, he won&rsquo;t be bothering you ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet&rsquo;s just say, I scared him a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little? He did more than that, Peter, I thought Flash was going to faint!\u201d Peter jerked his head up to see Ned walking through the door, smile plastered on his face. \u201cYou should have seen it, it was totally awesome. Had his blaster shoved in his face and everything!\u201d </p><p>\u201cReally? You did that for me?\u201d Peter asked, turning to his idol.</p><p>\u201cCourse I did, Underoos. Made sure he deleted the video and everything. See? No sweat.\u201d The relief made Peter want to laugh and cry at the same time. \u201cSpeaking of which, I need to go check my email,\u201d Tony said with a glint in his eye that Peter didn&rsquo;t understand. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two keep each other company for awhile?\u201d The man headed for the door, but stopped and looked back. \u201cAnd, Ned? Thanks for calling me, I owe you one.\u201d He watched Mr. Stark leave and Ned plopped down at the foot of his bed, beaming. Shame sat heavily in his stomach when he saw the bandage on his best friend&rsquo;s face.</p><p>\u201cNed, I&rsquo;m so sorry. I should have listened to you. If you don&rsquo;t want to be my friend anymore, I understand,\u201d Peter said dejectedly, staring hard at the blanket. Ned had told him it was a bad idea as soon as Flash invited them, but he hadn&rsquo;t listened. Now his friend had a broken nose, and it was all his fault.</p><p>\u201cDude, shut up. It doesn&rsquo;t even hurt that bad anymore, see?\u201d He poked the bandage hard and winced. \u201cOkay, that was a lie. It still hurts, but I don&rsquo;t care. I wasn&rsquo;t just gonna let Flash do all that to you, you&rsquo;re my best friend, Peter, I\u2019ll always have your back. Plus, after all these years I got to finally deck him, it felt awesome.\u201d Peter laughed with him, relieved he hadn&rsquo;t lost Ned. \u201cAnd I got to ride in Tony Stark&rsquo;s car, meet Doctor Banner, and sleep at the Avengers\u2019 hideout? Not to mention Stark said <i>he owed me one</i>. I&rsquo;m basically having a nerdgasm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGross dude,\u201d Peter laughed. \u201cAnd thanks, for&hellip;you know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnytime, Spiderman. Just doing my duty as the guy in the chair.\u201d Ned turned and reached into his backpack. \u201cOh yeah, Doctor Banner said you&rsquo;d probably need this when you woke up.\u201d</p><p>Ned handed him a water bottle and a bottle of Tums. </p><p>\u201cOh, thank God. It feels like I have sand in my mouth,\u201d Peter said, quickly taking a huge swig. \u201cYou&rsquo;re the best, man.\u201d Ned smile and laid back, horizontally across the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>",

Ned couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying over the pounding music, but when, a relatively sober, Flash pushed another cup of jungle juice into Peter\u2019s hand, a sick feeling nestled itself in Ned\u2019s stomach. Something wasn\u2019t right. Flash and the others hadn\u2019t drank much themselves, and yet they seemed to be vigilantly making sure that Peter\u2019s cup was never empty for long.</p><p>Ned slipped his phone into his back pocket and took another \u201cdrink\u201d from his beer as he approached the couch. Whatever was going on, he wasn\u2019t going to just sit there and let it happen.</p><p>\u201c-kid doesn\u2019t have a limit, holy shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow has he not passed out yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInitiation doesn\u2019t start \u2018til he does, newbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he will,\u201d Flash said, pouring what looked like straight vodka into a solo cup. \u201cI just thought he was more of a lightweight.\u201d Ned\u2019s stomach dropped. They were purposely trying to get Peter drunk. No, they had already succeeded at that, but his friend hadn\u2019t passed out yet. A chill went down his spine when he considered what they might \u00a0have planned once Peter did. He definitely needed to get his friend out of here.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had enough, Flash. Leave him alone,\u201d Ned said, reaching for his friend\u2019s arm. Flash jumped up from the couch and stood in between them, shoving Ned\u2019s hand away from Peter.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you mind your own business, Leeds?\u201d Everyone on the couch was staring at Ned, and Peter suddenly realised he was there too.</p><p>\u201cOh heeeyy, Ned. Wha\u2019s up, man?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI said, leave him alone.\u201d Before he saw it coming, Flash pushed him hard on the chest and Ned stumbled backward.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make me, chubbs?\u201d He felt his face redden when the guys on the couch snickered to one another. Peter\u2019s eyebrows furrowed, finally realizing something was going on.</p><p>\u201cNed don\u2019 worry. S'fine, we\u2019re jus\u2019 hangin\u2019 out s'all,\u201d he slurred, taking another drink of punch. Flash took another step forward.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Leeds. You heard him, we\u2019re just hanging out, so why don\u2019t you fuck off?\u201d Ned swallowed at the four other guys smirking at him from the couch. He was badly outnumbered, and Ned knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to put up much of a fight against them. He bit the inside of his cheek, leaving Peter here meant leaving him at their mercy, and Ned didn\u2019t think he would ever be able to forgive himself if he did. He could feel tears beginning to sting the corners of his eyes, Ned looked away so Flash wouldn\u2019t see them. He clenched his fist, if trying to get Peter out of here meant getting beaten to a pulp, then it was worth it.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The challenge was plain as day, and a dangerous glint appeared in Flash\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Flash looked over his shoulder at the older guys on the couch with a devilish grin. \u201cYou hear that guys? I think it\u2019s time I showed-\u201d</p><p>He was cut off by Ned\u2019s fist connecting with his cheekbone, the force sent him sprawling backward and nearly to the ground. Flash frantically clawed at the couch to catch himself and narrowly avoided landing on Peter\u2019s lap. The college students howled with laughter and Flash\u2019s face turn murderous, Ned involuntarily took a step back. Flash charged at him, swinging wildly at his face with a speed that Ned hadn\u2019t expected. He managed to throw an arm up without a moment to spare, but Flash had already sent another jab downward and hit him solidly in the stomach. </p><p>Ned gasped as the wind was knocked out of him, inadvertently hunching over at the sudden pain. He heard hooting over the music, and what sounded like Peter\u2019s voice, but he had little time to contemplate the fact before a fist crashed into his nose. The next thing he knew, Ned was on the ground, tears blurring his vision from the pain. Flash was standing over him, smug victory plastered all over his face as he turned and grabbed something, throwing it on the floor by Ned\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHere, Leeds. Why don\u2019t you call your mommy and have her pick you up? Parker won\u2019t be needing it.\u201d When he finally got his eyes to focus, Ned saw it was Peter\u2019s phone that had clattered to the floor. He grabbed it hurriedly and shoved it in his pocket when Ned realized there was still one more thing he could try. </p><p>Flash had already turned back to the couch, fist bumping one of the jocks and laughing. Ned colored as he realised that quite a few others had gathered around to see the commotion, and were snickering at him. He quickly got up and weaved through the crowd of laughing college students toward the bathroom. Thankfully it was empty, so Ned slipped inside and shut the door behind him. </p><p>He cringed as he caught a glance of himself in the mirror; blood was streaming from his nose and had already gotten on his shirt. Ned grabbed a wad of toilet paper and tried to stem the flow as he unlocked Peter\u2019s phone. Ned smiled in spite of himself. Of course Peter\u2019s password was Spiderman.</p><p>He scrolled through Peter\u2019s contact list and prayed that the number he was looking for was there. Finally, he found it and sent a quick text.</p><p><b>Peter Parker: </b>Please call me. It\u2019s important.</p><p>The reply came in under a minute.</p><p><b>Tony freaking Stark \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31:</b> At nearly midnight? Kid, I\u2019m getting old, how do you know I\u2019m not in bed already?</p><p><b>Tony freaking Stark \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31:</b> Actually scratch that, who am I kidding?</p><p><b>Tony freaking Stark\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31:</b> and btw, the last time you said it was important, you just wanted to tell me about that morbidly obese squirrel you saw in central park.</p><p>Ned rolled his eyes, and tapped out a hurried reply.</p><p><b>Peter Parker</b>: Urgent.</p><p>Apparently that was all the man needed to hear because the phone started vibrating almost immediately. Ned made sure the door was locked, and he picked it up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, kid?\u201d The joking had disappeared without a trace, and Ned was grateful.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I\u2019m sorry to bother you.\u201d Ned tilted his head back. \u201cBut this is an emergency-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this and why do you have Peter\u2019s phone?\u201d Ned cringed, how was he supposed to explain that he and Peter had thought it was a good idea to go to a college party? Let alone at Flash\u2019s recommendation.</p><p>\u201cUh, this is Peter\u2019s friend-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTed? What\u2019s going on? And why does your voice sound like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ned- never mind that doesn\u2019t matter. I kind of got punched, I think my nose is broken.\u201d He prodded it with his fingers and yelped at the jolt that shot through his face. \u201cNo, yeah it\u2019s definitely broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What?</i> I\u2019m going to need you to back up here, where are you guys?\u201d Ned swallowed, well here went nothing. He just hoped Mr. Stark didn\u2019t fly him to the top of the Empire State building and leave him there after all of this.</p><p>\u201cPeter and I went to a party, and there\u2019s a bunch of guys getting Peter drunk. I tried to stop it, Mr. Stark, I swear, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Ned\u2019s voice broke as tears slipped down his face. Why hadn\u2019t he tried harder to talk Peter out of going? Some friend he was.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, hang on. I need you to keep it together for little bit longer. I\u2019m already on the way to my car.\u201d From what it sounded like, Ned knew Mr. Stark was actually running there. \u201cWhere are you and Peter right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI locked myself in the bathroom, and Peter was on the couch when I left. Please hurry, Mr. Stark, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, stay there. Text me the address, I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><hr><p>Tony gripped his steering wheel tightly as he floored it. A rage he had never felt before was running hot through his veins. He had been angry when his mansion, along with his life\u2019s work, had been blown to hell off a cliff. When the plane Happy had insisted was secure, also carrying his life\u2019s work, had been destroyed and nearly took Peter with it, Tony had been furious. This was different, a fiery protectiveness bloomed in his chest. There was going to be hell to pay.</p><p>\u201cPete, what did you get yourself into,\u201d he muttered to himself when the house came into view. Tony didn\u2019t look to verify the address number, there wasn\u2019t any need to. There were drunk college kids <i>everywhere. </i></p><p>The house clearly belonged to a fraternity, its greek symbol sat above the front door and was plastered to several flags hanging beside it. Not to mention one of the jocks had it painted across his bare chest. Tony smiled grimly, this fraternity was going to be shut down come Monday morning. The best part was that it would only take a single letter to the dean explaining that his intern had been victimized, and he would refuse to continue making rather<i> generous</i> donations if such action was not taken. These punks didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>Tony parked in front of the house and stepped out into the street before cutting across the lawn, toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cHey, nice car, man!\u201d </p><p>He ignored the shout and continued walking. Several of the partiers had quieted down and were watching him anxiously, suddenly aware that an adult was present. Tony walked up the porch steps and headed through the open door.</p><p>\u201cHey, what do you think you\u2019re-\u201d Shirtless toughguy stepped forward to stop him, but froze when he saw who was walking into his frat house. Tony smirked, kid didn\u2019t even know what was gonna hit him.</p><p>The music got even louder when he was inside, Tony was surprised none of the frames on the wall had fallen off at the absurd amount of bass vibrating through the house. He walked past the staircase and pushed through a group of girls in skimpy outfits toward what he assumed was the living room. That\u2019s where Ned had said Peter was, right?</p><p>His question was answered when a roar of laughter erupted ahead of him.</p><p>\u201cNo way, he\u2019s actually pissing himself!\u201d Tony shoved his way into the room and froze at what he saw.</p><p>Peter was sitting on the ground, his back pressed against the couch and a red solo cup held in his hand at a precarious angle. There was a group of jocks sitting behind him on the cushions, watching with interest, almost like they were supervising the whole thing. They looked like Grade A douchebags, complete with bad tans and muscle shirts with sleazy catch phrases in neon lettering. One of the shirts read: <i>Leg Rests</i> and had an arrow pointing at each shoulder. A much younger kid that caught Tony\u2019s eye, the one who had shouted, was standing in front of Peter recording. The bright light coming from his phone shined in Peter\u2019s face and he clumsily tried to block it with his hand.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes were glazed and he didn\u2019t seem to understand what was so funny, but laughed along anyway. <i>Penis Parker</i>, along with other obscenities, was written all over his face. The kid\u2019s belt was unbuckled and a dark stain was spreading across the front of his pants.</p><p>Tony saw red.</p><p>Spinning the face of his watch, Tony felt metal cover his right hand as he rushed forward and grabbed the curly haired rat holding the phone with the other. He yelped as Tony shoved him up against the wall, fistful of fabric clutched in his left hand. Tony hardly registered the shouts over the blood roaring in his ears, and he pointed his right palm inches from his face, the repuslor ready to fire. The kid paled, and recognition suddenly sparked in Tony\u2019s eyes. </p><p><i>Flash. </i></p><p>Just when Tony thought the piece of shit was going to faint, he pointed his hand at the booming speaker standing in the corner and fired a single blast, killing it instantly.</p><p>\u201cParty\u2019s over,\u201d Tony yelled, not breaking eye contact for a second. Satisfied with the screams and footsteps pounding toward the front door, Tony tightened his grip on Flash\u2019s shirt and pointed his palm back at his face.</p><p>\u201cP-please don\u2019t-\u201d Tears had already started running down his face, and he looked so terrified Tony thought he was going to pee his pants. He internally shrugged, it would be poetic justice if he did.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you give him?\u201d Tony snarled, yanking on his collar harshly.</p><p>\u201cI-I only gave him a few beers,\u201d Flash choked out, pressing his head back into the wall as hard as he could to get away from the weapon.</p><p>\u201cBull. Shit.\u201d Tony pointed the repulsor even closer to his face and the light got brighter. </p><p>\u201cOkay! Okay! I- I don\u2019t remember, think it was three beers, some vodka, jungle juice, whiskey, and a c-couple shots of tequila.\u201d Tony thought he was going to lose it.</p><p>\u201cWhat was in the punch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I swear! Please-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was all of this, are you trying to kill him?\u201d Flash\u2019s eyes got even wider as tears continued to well in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo! I swear, it was just initiation for next year. I-I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I had to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looked like you were enjoying it to me.\u201d So it was the fraternity\u2019s doing. Tony kept the blaster trained on him, though in the back of his mind he knew he\u2019d never shoot the idiot, and looked back at the couch. The douchebags had already taken off, leaving Peter sitting on the ground. Ned had appeared and was helping Peter get his belt back on. He was crying. </p><p>\u201cYou know I could let all this get out, that Tony Stark\u2019s intern was nearly killed by his own classmate,\u201d Tony threatened, turning back to Flash who had managed to pale even more. \u201cNo university would ever admit you, and you certainly won\u2019t be getting my recommendation letter. Hell, the police might even get involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please. I\u2019ll do anything, Mr. Stark.\u201d The jerk was openly sobbing now. Tony didn\u2019t feel an ounce of sympathy.</p><p>Tony weighed his options. He could expose the punk, God knows he deserved it, but then that would create a huge mess that Tony knew Peter wouldn\u2019t appreciate. He glared at Flash, Tony had heard a lot about this asshole and found a deep satisfaction at seeing him blubber for mercy. This punk had bullied Peter since middle school, and had been relentless ever since. It had taken many long nights of coaxing for him to draw this information out of the kid, and whenever Peter showed up to the tower in tears, Tony knew why. He smiled, and that seemed to scare Flash even more.</p><p>\u201cOh I know you will,\u201d Tony said, lowering his hand and disarming the repulsor. He hit a button and it disappeared, collapsing back into his watch. \u201cFirst, I want the names of each and every prick who put you up to this.\u201d Flash nodded hastily, not showing a second thought about snitching on them. Tony grabbed a business card out of his shirt pocket with his free hand and let it flutter to the ground, his left hand still holding onto Flash\u2019s shirt. \u201cYou email me those names by tomorrow morning, or I\u2019m going to expose you as the ringleader, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond, I know who you are. You\u2019re a pathetic piece of shit that gets off on making Peter\u2019s life miserable. That stops now.\u201d Tony brought his face more inches from Flash\u2019s. \u201cIf I hear one more, just one more complaint about how you\u2019ve been cruel to him, all bets are off. Got it?\u201d Flash nodded vigorously. </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Tony released him and he slid to the ground. \u201cAnd if that video you took, surfaces anywhere and I mean <i>anywhere</i>, same deal. So I suggest you delete it.\u201d Flash scrambled for his phone and the business card on the ground, before hurriedly scrolling through it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s gone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSmart choice,\u201d Tony said, pulling Flash to his feet. \u201cNow get out.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to be told twice, as soon as Tony released him he ran toward the front door as fast as he could. When he turned around, Tony saw Ned crouched beside Peter, trying to console him. Peter\u2019s friend looked up and Tony cringed at the purple bruising that was already starting to color his nose. He looked at Tony sadly before turning back to his crying friend.</p><p>\u201cPeter it\u2019s okay, this isn\u2019t your fault. It was Flash\u2019s and those assholes. Remember in health class? Alcohol is a diuretic, you couldn\u2019t control it.\u201d Peter shook his head and continued to sob inconsolably. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, man. You\u2019re drunk, it basically doesn\u2019t count.\u201d </p><p>Tony walked over to Peter and sat on the couch, placing a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNed\u2019s right, Pete. Not your fault.\u201d Peter kept crying, but Tony wasn\u2019t sure if it was the alcohol or the embarrassment talking. \u00a0\u201cCome on, kiddo, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d Ned helped Tony pull Peter to his feet, and he stumbled, holding onto Tony for dear life. </p><p>\u201cRoom\u2019s spinning,\u201d he whimpered, trying to get his balance under control.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s going to be doing that for awhile.\u201d Tony helped the drunk teenager walk, while Ned kept a cautious hand on his back in case he fell. When they made it out of the house, Tony saw that everyone was gone, except for a few stragglers who watched them from a distance. Unlocking his car, Tony guided Peter into the passenger seat while Ned opened a door and slid into the seat behind his friend. Tony got into the driver\u2019s seat and pulled away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cUm, are you taking me home, Mister Stark?\u201d Tony glanced up to the rear view mirror and looked at Ned.</p><p>\u201cNot with that shiner. We\u2019re going back to the tower to get you both checked out first.\u201d Ned fell silent.</p><p>Tony focused back on the road and sped up. He needed to get Peter to the medbay to make sure the kid wasn\u2019t ODing, the only thing preventing him from going into a full fledged panic attack was the fact that he was still conscious. </p><p>\u201cM'ser Stark, I don\u2019 feel good,\u201d Peter slurred, shifting uncomfortably in the seat. He had stopped crying for the time being, but Tony doubted it would last for very long.</p><p>\u201cI know, buddy. We\u2019re almost there, just hang on-\u201d Tony was cut off when Peter suddenly pitched forward and vomited harshly all over the floorboard and himself. </p><p>\u201c<i>Shit!</i>\u201d Tony hit his steering wheel, and immediately regretted it when Peter jumped. He coughed and tears began running down his face again. Tony sighed, he definitely should have seen that coming. </p><p>\u201cOh no, oh no, m'so sorry, please don\u2019t be mad-\u201d Peter was interrupted when around gag tore from his throat and sent more of the foul liquid splashing onto the carpet. He was crying hard now, fingers pressed to his mouth as if it would stop any more from coming up. Tony cringed at the splattering beside him and the smell beginning to fill the car. His heart felt heavy at Peter\u2019s pleading, the kid almost sounded afraid. He cursed his knee jerk reaction and rubbed his back gently in an attempt to calm him down. </p><p>\u201cShhh, it\u2019s alright, buddy. I\u2019m not mad, it was just an accident. I\u2019m sorry if I scared you,\u201d he said gently, guilt writhing in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna puke again,\u201d Peter sobbed, looking around trying to find a way out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you do, Pete. Just breathe, okay? Don\u2019t worry about the car, it can be cleaned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, m'such an idiot,\u201d he cried into his hands sadly. \u201cI thought he finally liked me.\u201d Tony thought his heart was going to shatter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that, Pete. You\u2019re not an idiot, you\u2019re one of the smartest kids I\u2019ve ever met. Flash is the one with the problem, not you, kiddo.\u201d Ned shifted in the seat behind him, and Tony felt his face burn. He had forgotten that they weren\u2019t alone. Tony swallowed before making up his mind, he wasn\u2019t about to let his pride stand in the way of taking care of his kid. </p><p>\u201cWhy does he hate me so much?\u201d Peter continued to cry into his hands, making Tony wish he had beat the ever living shit out of Flash. He had seen the bruise starting to form on his face, and Ned\u2019s swollen knuckles made a surge of fondness for Peter\u2019s friend go through him. Peter looked down at the mess he\u2019d made of himself and whimpered. \u201cGod, m'so <i>gross</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not, buddy. It\u2019s alright. I need you to calm down for me, Pete, before you make yourself sick again.\u201d He kept rubbing small circles on Peter\u2019s back as they drove.</p><p>When they finally pulled up to the tower, Peter sat in the seat quietly, his sobs dying down to hiccups. Tony threw his seatbelt off and walked around the car to help Peter get out. Tony\u2019s stomach clenched as he opened the door, nausea threatening to take over. Vomit covered Peter\u2019s the bottom half of his shirt, lap, and shoes, but the carpet had taken the worst of it. Not to mention his pants were still soaked and was likely seeping into the seat\u2019s fabric. Tony steeled himself, this wasn\u2019t about him, it was about Peter and he needed his help. The kid fumbled with his seatbelt for several moments before Tony reached over and popped it open for him. His heart ached at Peter\u2019s red rimmed eyes, and Tony patted him on the back. </p><p>\u201cCome on, Pete, let\u2019s get you cleaned up.\u201d He dragged his feet out of the car and leaned heavily against the doorframe, evidently still dizzy.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d he whimpered, eyes closed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m going to help you, okay?\u201d Peter nodded, so Tony grabbed his arms and slowly helped him to his feet. He tried to take a step, but stumbled forward and fell against Tony\u2019s chest. He caught the kid just in time and wrapped his left arm tightly around Peter\u2019s waist, bearing some of his weight. Ned was standing beside the car uncertainly, clearly not sure what to do. Tony jerked his head toward the door.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get that nose looked at.\u201d After a significant amount of effort, Tony managed to get Peter up the stairs and into the elevator. When they staggered into the medbay, he couldn\u2019t say he blamed Bruce for the incredulous look on his face. He knew they must be quite a sight.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened, Tony? FRIDAY said it was important, but she didn\u2019t tell me much. Is Peter drunk?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHeeeeyy Bruce,\u201d Peter said, his eyes partly closed. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion. \u201cWait, why aren\u2019t you green? M'ser Stark shouldn\u2019 he be green?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that answers your question, Banner. Anyway, it\u2019s a long story. Mind checking his BAC?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Bruce said, rummaging through a drawer and grabbed a small device out before holding it in front of Peter. \u201cBlow into this, please.\u201d Peter did so, and when the machine beeped, Bruce checked the small screen and whistled.</p><p>\u201c0.18, that\u2019s pretty high.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs he going to be alright?\u201d Bruce let out a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOh he\u2019ll be fine, with his levels of metabolic activity from the mutation he\u2019d need about a gallon of pure vodka to overdose. But he\u2019ll be feeling it tomorrow, just like the rest of us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019 drink <i>that</i> much M'ser S'ark. Jus- had a few\u2026\u201d He mumbled, his eyes already drooping closed. Tony rolled his eyes and readjusted his grip on the kid.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever you say, Spiderling. Come on,\u201d Tony started guiding him out of the room. \u201cCan you check his friend out? Thinks his nose if broken. I\u2019m gonna go take care of drunkie, here.\u201d Bruce snapped some rubber gloves on and motioned for Ned to sit on a nearby table.</p><p>\u201cOf course. And what\u2019s your name?\u201d He asked as he started prodding the skin tenderly. Ned winced at the touch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ned. Aren\u2019t you the Hulk?\u201d Bruce smiled at his obvious excitement. </p><p>\u201cOnly on my bad days. Fortunately, today isn\u2019t one of them or I\u2019m afraid I wouldn\u2019t be much help to you at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, that\u2019s so cool! What does it feel like? Are you conscious when it happens or is it like a blackout?\u201d Ned continued to excitedly rattle off questions, seemingly unbothered by his injury for the moment. </p><p>Satisfied that Peter\u2019s friend would be taken care of, Tony headed back to the elevators, correcting Peter\u2019s balance every couple of steps. As they were riding up, Tony frowned when he realised that his shirt felt damp. It didn\u2019t take long to register that vomit had been smeared onto his own shirt, and he grimaced slightly. He reminded himself that it wasn\u2019t the kid\u2019s fault and stepped onto the residential floor. </p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Peter asked as they made their way to Tony\u2019s room. The bathroom there was the largest one on this floor, and he knew they\u2019d need as much space as they could get.</p><p>\u201cTo get you out of these clothes and hopefully into the shower.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, m'kay.\u201d They were nearly there when Peter shifted in his grip. \u201cGotta pee.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright, hang on. Almost there.\u201d Tony quickened their pace and as much he could. His pants were already a goner anyway, but if Peter didn\u2019t make it he knew he\u2019d be crying again, and that was the last thing Tony wanted. </p><p>They had finally staggered through the master bedroom, and into the bathroom when Peter whined and crossed his legs. Knowing they didn\u2019t have much time, Tony had Peter hold onto his shoulders while he hurriedly undid his belt for him. He knew the kid would never make it if he tried to do it himself. When it was open, he averted his eyes before pulling the fabric down and sitting him on the toilet. </p><p>\u201cWait, m'not a girl M'ser S'ark,\u201d Peter said, confusion evident on his face. He moved to get up, but Tony steadied him with a firm hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo shit, kid,\u201d Tony said, rolling his eyes. \u201cBut do you really think standing is such a good idea right now?\u201d The simplicity of that logic seemed to penetrate Peter\u2019s foggy mind and he shook his head. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to step out. Call me when you\u2019re done.\u201d </p><p>Tony didn\u2019t wait for a response as he left the bathroom, face burning. This was beyond weird, and he was pretty sure that this situation hadn\u2019t been spelled out in the internship contract he had signed. But what was he going to do? Lock the kid in a guest room and wish him luck? Hell no. Peter needed him right now, and if he was drunk off his ass, Tony knew without a doubt Peter would do the same for him. Though he prayed it never came to that, Tony was certain the mortification alone would kill him.</p><p>\u201cM'done, M'ser S'ark,\u201d Peter slurred from the bathroom. Tony came back into the room to see Peter leaning precariously to the right, and he was thankful the kid hadn\u2019t fallen off. </p><p>\u201cOkay, kid. Now let\u2019s get you out of these clothes, I\u2019m sure they aren\u2019t very comfortable.\u201d Tony knelt and started untying Peter\u2019s shoes while the kid struggled with his shirt. When both of them were off, he tugged his jeans and boxers the rest of the way off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019 look,\u201d Peter said, tossing the wet shirt onto the tile floor.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it, Pete,\u201d Tony promised, looking at the ceiling as he helped Peter stand and shuffle over to the large shower. </p><hr><p>Peter sat quietly on Tony\u2019s bed in fresh pajamas, struggling to keep his eyes open. It had been tricky, but he had managed to get the kid clean, though he made Peter sit under the spray of water. The last thing he needed was for him to slip and bash his head open. Tony brought a warm washcloth and a bottle of rubbing alcohol from the bathroom and sat beside him on the bed. Wetting the rag, Tony began gently rubbing at the marker off Peter\u2019s cheek. He was halfway done with his forehead, when Peter\u2019s face suddenly crumpled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, buddy? I didn\u2019t get any of this in your eyes, did I?\u201d A tear rolled down his cheek, quickly followed by more.</p><p>\u201cI miss Uncle Ben.\u201d Tony sighed, tossing the rag and bottle onto the comforter at Peter\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d he said softly, his heart clenching at the sadness all over Peter\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cH-he always took care of me when I was sick. Just like this,\u201d he sniffed, tears dripping onto the comforter.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter turned and wrapped his arms around Tony in a hug, burying his face in the crook of his neck. Tony returned it without a second thought and held him tightly. </p><p>\u201cShhhhh, it\u2019s alright. You\u2019re okay, you\u2019re alright,\u201d Tony soothed, carding his fingers through Peter\u2019s wet hair.</p><p>\u201cHe was jus\u2019 always there for me, and now he\u2019s not,\u201d he wept sadly. Tony didn\u2019t say anything and just held him. Hell, what could he say to that? </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Tony eventually managed, his chest aching.</p><p>\u201cBut tha\u2019s okay, m'not alone anymore,\u201d he sniffled.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot you now,\u201d Peter said simply before hugging him harder. Tony\u2019s throat tightened, if he hadn\u2019t been speechless before, he certainly was now. Tony figured it must be the alcohol talking. </p><p>Sure, he mentored the kid a little and let him help in his workshop from time to time, but he certainly wasn\u2019t a father figure. He was a terrible role model and was pretty pathetic with kids, but Peter didn\u2019t seem to care about any of those things.</p><p>Peter sniffled and Tony looked down at his intern that had him in a deathgrip, letting out a sigh. Who was he kidding? The kid was so much more than that, he was- well he was just Peter: a goofy kid from Queens who had somehow managed to squeeze his way into Tony\u2019s life. As much as he hated to admit it, Tony couldn\u2019t deny the warmth that began sprouting in his chest at Peter\u2019s admission. He remembered the late nights they\u2019d spent together tweaking the kid\u2019s suit, eating their weight in ice cream, and training together. Tony smiled softly to himself, he knew he definitely wouldn\u2019t have spent his Friday night like this for just any intern.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it looks like you do, kiddo,\u201d he said, resting a hand on top of Peter\u2019s head. The kid sighed contently and relaxed against him, and they sat that way for some time.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Pete, before you zonk out, at least let me get the rest of this crap off of your face. Can\u2019t have you looking like some shitty rapper.\u201d Peter whined at being dislodged from Tony\u2019s arms, and let him wipe the rest of the sharpie off. When Tony was done, the kid all but collapsed back into the bed, asleep before he hit the pillow. </p><p>\u201cWell good night to you too, Underoos,\u201d Tony snorted before making sure Peter was laying on his side in case he got sick again. Tossing a blanket over him, Tony grabbed the small trash can from beside his desk and put it on the floor next to the bed. Tony yawned and looked at his watch, it was almost three o'clock in the morning. He curled up in the armchair sitting beside the bathroom door and watched the blanket steadily rise and fall with Peter\u2019s breathing. Tony was asleep before he knew it.</p><hr><p>Peter cracked his eyes open and he immediately regretted doing so. The sunlight peering in through the window sent a sharp stab of pain through his head. All of his senses felt like they were dialed up to eleven, and he was pretty sure there was an ice pick being driven through his skull. His tongue was stuck to the roof of his mouth and his stomach felt like it was going to turn inside out at any moment. He groaned and closed his eyes when the room started to move.</p><p>Peter could feel acid beginning to creep up the back of his throat, and his swallowed thickly trying to prevent the inevitable. He didn\u2019t know where he was, and he was pretty sure whoever\u2019s bed he was laying in wouldn\u2019t appreciate him puking all over it. Tears pricked his eyes and he gagged, but thankfully nothing came up. He leaned over the bed and retched again, dreading the splattering that would accompany it as it hit the floor. But it never came.</p><p>\u201cEasy, kid. Let it out, I got you.\u201d Peter snapped his eyes back open, he\u2019d know that voice anywhere. Mister Stark was holding a bin up to his mouth and rubbing his back. How the hell did he get here?</p><p>\u201cWhat hap-\u201d Peter was cut off as he was sick again, though it was only bile at this point. Each heave made his head pound even harder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to speak. Thanks for the warning gag by the way, gave me time to grab this.\u201d Finally he spit the last of the saliva into the trashcan and fell back onto the bed, utterly exhausted. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgghh, my head,\u201d Peter groaned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought, kiddo. Welcome to the final stage of a fun night: regret.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He asked, eyes buried in the crook of his elbow. </p><p>\u201cDoes a college party ring any bells?\u201d </p><p>Yeah, it did. Hazy images flicked through his mind, the loud music, the alcohol, Flash punching Ned, his pants getting warm, the car ride. Oh God, the car ride. His face flushed as the rest of the memories filled his head, he had cried on Mister Stark. Peter didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever live it down.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d he groaned. \u201cMister Stark, I\u2019m so sorry. I was so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was pretty stupid, Pete,\u201d the man chuckled and sat on the bed beside him. \u201cBut definitely not the end of the world, I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I puked all over your car,\u201d Peter cringed. \u201cAnd your seat\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t get himself to say it.</p><p>\u201cEh, not a big deal, kiddo,\u201d Mister Stark waved the apology away. \u201cI have to admit, I\u2019ve given several of my other cars the same treatment and they survived.\u201d Peter nodded, and the man suddenly put his hand to his ear, listening to whoever was speaking in the piece.</p><p>\u201cYeah, send him up.\u201d</p><p>Peter suddenly felt all the blood rush to his feet. Flash had been recording him the whole time last night, tears began to well in his eyes again. The whole school must have seen him pissing himself like a toddler by now.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, what\u2019s going on, bud? Talk to me.\u201d He looked down and he felt a gentle hand land on his shoulder. Peter shook his head and sniffled. This was all so embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Pete, it\u2019s okay, really. I\u2019m not mad, everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d Peter felt a surge of anger and humiliation. Of course Mister Stark wouldn\u2019t understand, MJ was going to see it. Oh God, he\u2019d never be able to look her in the face again.</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not! Flash-\u201d Peter struggled with himself for a few moments, the anger was suddenly replaced with despair. \u201cEveryone\u2019s gonna know,\u201d he finally choked out. He could not, for the life of him, fathom why Mister Stark suddenly started laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you won\u2019t have to worry about that. Actually, he won\u2019t be bothering you ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say, I scared him a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little? He did more than that, Peter, I thought Flash was going to faint!\u201d Peter jerked his head up to see Ned walking through the door, smile plastered on his face. \u201cYou should have seen it, it was totally awesome. Had his blaster shoved in his face and everything!\u201d </p><p>\u201cReally? You did that for me?\u201d Peter asked, turning to his idol.</p><p>\u201cCourse I did, Underoos. Made sure he deleted the video and everything. See? No sweat.\u201d The relief made Peter want to laugh and cry at the same time. \u201cSpeaking of which, I need to go check my email,\u201d Tony said with a glint in his eye that Peter didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two keep each other company for awhile?\u201d The man headed for the door, but stopped and looked back. \u201cAnd, Ned? Thanks for calling me, I owe you one.\u201d He watched Mr. Stark leave and Ned plopped down at the foot of his bed, beaming. Shame sat heavily in his stomach when he saw the bandage on his best friend\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cNed, I\u2019m so sorry. I should have listened to you. If you don\u2019t want to be my friend anymore, I understand,\u201d Peter said dejectedly, staring hard at the blanket. Ned had told him it was a bad idea as soon as Flash invited them, but he hadn\u2019t listened. Now his friend had a broken nose, and it was all his fault.</p><p>\u201cDude, shut up. It doesn\u2019t even hurt that bad anymore, see?\u201d He poked the bandage hard and winced. \u201cOkay, that was a lie. It still hurts, but I don\u2019t care. I wasn\u2019t just gonna let Flash do all that to you, you\u2019re my best friend, Peter, I\u2019ll always have your back. Plus, after all these years I got to finally deck him, it felt awesome.\u201d Peter laughed with him, relieved he hadn\u2019t lost Ned. \u201cAnd I got to ride in Tony Stark\u2019s car, meet Doctor Banner, and sleep at the Avengers\u2019 hideout? Not to mention Stark said <i>he owed me one</i>. I\u2019m basically having a nerdgasm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGross dude,\u201d Peter laughed. \u201cAnd thanks, for\u2026you know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnytime, Spiderman. Just doing my duty as the guy in the chair.\u201d Ned turned and reached into his backpack. \u201cOh yeah, Doctor Banner said you\u2019d probably need this when you woke up.\u201d</p><p>Ned handed him a water bottle and a bottle of Tums. </p><p>\u201cOh, thank God. It feels like I have sand in my mouth,\u201d Peter said, quickly taking a huge swig. \u201cYou\u2019re the best, man.\u201d Ned smile and laid back, horizontally across the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p></p>",

Bless you for your patience, I hope you like it :)</p><hr><p>Ned sat in an armchair and fumbled with his phone uneasily, casting an anxious glance at Peter from across the room. He raised his empty beer can to his lips again; everyone else around him was so drunk, no one had seen him slip into the kitchen and dump all of its contents in the sink shortly after having it shoved into his hands. He scrolled through his contact list again, desperate to find someone who could pick them up this late. They shouldn\u2019t have come, it was a mistake.<b><br></b></p><p><i>MJ</i>. Out of town and she doesn\u2019t have a license either. Though he was pretty sure that wouldn\u2019t have stopped her.<i> Mom. Dad.</i> Nope, he wanted to survive the night. <i>May.</i> That would be even worse. <i>Peter.</i> Ned anxiously looked up from his phone, his friend was drunk out of his mind.</p><p>The night had started out promisingly enough, Flash had gotten them into their first college party as promised and no one seemed to mind their much younger company. Though Ned wasn\u2019t sure if it was because they didn\u2019t care or if they were too drunk to notice. Flash started shoving alcohol in Peter\u2019s face almost immediately, urging him to \u2018stop being such a pussy for once.\u2019 When the unease on his friend\u2019s face turned into determination, Ned knew it wasn\u2019t going to end well.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Now, Peter was sitting on a couch with Flash and a group of frat guys. Ned couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying over the pounding music, but when, a relatively sober, Flash pushed another cup of jungle juice into Peter\u2019s hand, a sick feeling nestled itself in Ned\u2019s stomach. Something wasn\u2019t right. Flash and the others hadn\u2019t drank much themselves, and yet they seemed to be vigilantly making sure that Peter\u2019s cup was never empty for long.</p><p>Ned slipped his phone into his back pocket and took another \u201cdrink\u201d from his beer as he approached the couch. Whatever was going on, he wasn\u2019t going to just sit there and let it happen.</p><p>\u201c-kid doesn\u2019t have a limit, holy shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow has he not passed out yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInitiation doesn\u2019t start \u2018til he does, newbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he will,\u201d Flash said, pouring what looked like straight vodka into a solo cup. \u201cI just thought he was more of a lightweight.\u201d Ned\u2019s stomach dropped. They were purposely trying to get Peter drunk. No, they had already succeeded at that, but his friend hadn\u2019t passed out yet. A chill went down his spine when he considered what they might \u00a0have planned once Peter did. He definitely needed to get his friend out of here.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had enough, Flash. Leave him alone,\u201d Ned said, reaching for his friend\u2019s arm. Flash jumped up from the couch and stood in between them, shoving Ned\u2019s hand away from Peter.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you mind your own business, Leeds?\u201d Everyone on the couch was staring at Ned, and Peter suddenly realised he was there too.</p><p>\u201cOh heeeyy, Ned. Wha\u2019s up, man?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI said, leave him alone.\u201d Before he saw it coming, Flash pushed him hard on the chest and Ned stumbled backward.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make me, chubbs?\u201d He felt his face redden when the guys on the couch snickered to one another. Peter\u2019s eyebrows furrowed, finally realizing something was going on.</p><p>\u201cNed don\u2019 worry. S'fine, we\u2019re jus\u2019 hangin\u2019 out s'all,\u201d he slurred, taking another drink of punch. Flash took another step forward.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Leeds. You heard him, we\u2019re just hanging out, so why don\u2019t you fuck off?\u201d Ned swallowed at the four other guys smirking at him from the couch. He was badly outnumbered, and Ned knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to put up much of a fight against them. He bit the inside of his cheek, leaving Peter here meant leaving him at their mercy, and Ned didn\u2019t think he would ever be able to forgive himself if he did. He could feel tears beginning to sting the corners of his eyes, Ned looked away so Flash wouldn\u2019t see them. He clenched his fist, if trying to get Peter out of here meant getting beaten to a pulp, then it was worth it.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The challenge was plain as day, and a dangerous glint appeared in Flash\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Flash looked over his shoulder at the older guys on the couch with a devilish grin. \u201cYou hear that guys? I think it\u2019s time I showed-\u201d</p><p>He was cut off by Ned\u2019s fist connecting with his cheekbone, the force sent him sprawling backward and nearly to the ground. Flash frantically clawed at the couch to catch himself and narrowly avoided landing on Peter\u2019s lap. The college students howled with laughter and Flash\u2019s face turn murderous, Ned involuntarily took a step back. Flash charged at him, swinging wildly at his face with a speed that Ned hadn\u2019t expected. He managed to throw an arm up without a moment to spare, but Flash had already sent another jab downward and hit him solidly in the stomach. </p><p>Ned gasped as the wind was knocked out of him, inadvertently hunching over at the sudden pain. He heard hooting over the music, and what sounded like Peter\u2019s voice, but he had little time to contemplate the fact before a fist crashed into his nose. The next thing he knew, Ned was on the ground, tears blurring his vision from the pain. Flash was standing over him, smug victory plastered all over his face as he turned and grabbed something, throwing it on the floor by Ned\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHere, Leeds. Why don\u2019t you call your mommy and have her pick you up? Parker won\u2019t be needing it.\u201d When he finally got his eyes to focus, Ned saw it was Peter\u2019s phone that had clattered to the floor. He grabbed it hurriedly and shoved it in his pocket when Ned realized there was still one more thing he could try. </p><p>Flash had already turned back to the couch, fist bumping one of the jocks and laughing. Ned colored as he realised that quite a few others had gathered around to see the commotion, and were snickering at him. He quickly got up and weaved through the crowd of laughing college students toward the bathroom. Thankfully it was empty, so Ned slipped inside and shut the door behind him. </p><p>He cringed as he caught a glance of himself in the mirror; blood was streaming from his nose and had already gotten on his shirt. Ned grabbed a wad of toilet paper and tried to stem the flow as he unlocked Peter\u2019s phone. Ned smiled in spite of himself. Of course Peter\u2019s password was Spiderman.</p><p>He scrolled through Peter\u2019s contact list and prayed that the number he was looking for was there. Finally, he found it and sent a quick text.</p><p><b>Peter Parker: </b>Please call me. It\u2019s important.</p><p>The reply came in under a minute.</p><p><b>Tony freaking Stark \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31:</b> At nearly midnight? Kid, I\u2019m getting old, how do you know I\u2019m not in bed already?</p><p><b>Tony freaking Stark \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31:</b> Actually scratch that, who am I kidding?</p><p><b>Tony freaking Stark\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31:</b> and btw, the last time you said it was important, you just wanted to tell me about that morbidly obese squirrel you saw in central park.</p><p>Ned rolled his eyes, and tapped out a hurried reply.</p><p><b>Peter Parker</b>: Urgent.</p><p>Apparently that was all the man needed to hear because the phone started vibrating almost immediately. Ned made sure the door was locked, and he picked it up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, kid?\u201d The joking had disappeared without a trace, and Ned was grateful.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I\u2019m sorry to bother you.\u201d Ned tilted his head back. \u201cBut this is an emergency-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this and why do you have Peter\u2019s phone?\u201d Ned cringed, how was he supposed to explain that he and Peter had thought it was a good idea to go to a college party? Let alone at Flash\u2019s recommendation.</p><p>\u201cUh, this is Peter\u2019s friend-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTed? What\u2019s going on? And why does your voice sound like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ned- never mind that doesn\u2019t matter. I kind of got punched, I think my nose is broken.\u201d He prodded it with his fingers and yelped at the jolt that shot through his face. \u201cNo, yeah it\u2019s definitely broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What?</i> I\u2019m going to need you to back up here, where are you guys?\u201d Ned swallowed, well here went nothing. He just hoped Mr. Stark didn\u2019t fly him to the top of the Empire State building and leave him there after all of this.</p><p>\u201cPeter and I went to a party, and there\u2019s a bunch of guys getting Peter drunk. I tried to stop it, Mr. Stark, I swear, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Ned\u2019s voice broke as tears slipped down his face. Why hadn\u2019t he tried harder to talk Peter out of going? Some friend he was.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, hang on. I need you to keep it together for little bit longer. I\u2019m already on the way to my car.\u201d From what it sounded like, Ned knew Mr. Stark was actually running there. \u201cWhere are you and Peter right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI locked myself in the bathroom, and Peter was on the couch when I left. Please hurry, Mr. Stark, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, stay there. Text me the address, I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><hr><p>Tony gripped his steering wheel tightly as he floored it. A rage he had never felt before was running hot through his veins. He had been angry when his mansion, along with his life\u2019s work, had been blown to hell off a cliff. When the plane Happy had insisted was secure, also carrying his life\u2019s work, had been destroyed and nearly took Peter with it, Tony had been furious. This was different, a fiery protectiveness bloomed in his chest. There was going to be hell to pay.</p><p>\u201cPete, what did you get yourself into,\u201d he muttered to himself when the house came into view. Tony didn\u2019t look to verify the address number, there wasn\u2019t any need to. There were drunk college kids <i>everywhere. </i></p><p>The house clearly belonged to a fraternity, its greek symbol sat above the front door and was plastered to several flags hanging beside it. Not to mention one of the jocks had it painted across his bare chest. Tony smiled grimly, this fraternity was going to be shut down come Monday morning. The best part was that it would only take a single letter to the dean explaining that his intern had been victimized, and he would refuse to continue making rather<i> generous</i> donations if such action was not taken. These punks didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>Tony parked in front of the house and stepped out into the street before cutting across the lawn, toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cHey, nice car, man!\u201d </p><p>He ignored the shout and continued walking. Several of the partiers had quieted down and were watching him anxiously, suddenly aware that an adult was present. Tony walked up the porch steps and headed through the open door.</p><p>\u201cHey, what do you think you\u2019re-\u201d Shirtless toughguy stepped forward to stop him, but froze when he saw who was walking into his frat house. Tony smirked, kid didn\u2019t even know what was gonna hit him.</p><p>The music got even louder when he was inside, Tony was surprised none of the frames on the wall had fallen off at the absurd amount of bass vibrating through the house. He walked past the staircase and pushed through a group of girls in skimpy outfits toward what he assumed was the living room. That\u2019s where Ned had said Peter was, right?</p><p>His question was answered when a roar of laughter erupted ahead of him.</p><p>\u201cNo way, he\u2019s actually pissing himself!\u201d Tony shoved his way into the room and froze at what he saw.</p><p>Peter was sitting on the ground, his back pressed against the couch and a red solo cup held in his hand at a precarious angle. There was a group of jocks sitting behind him on the cushions, watching with interest, almost like they were supervising the whole thing. They looked like Grade A douchebags, complete with bad tans and muscle shirts with sleazy catch phrases in neon lettering. One of the shirts read: <i>Leg Rests</i> and had an arrow pointing at each shoulder. A much younger kid that caught Tony\u2019s eye, the one who had shouted, was standing in front of Peter recording. The bright light coming from his phone shined in Peter\u2019s face and he clumsily tried to block it with his hand.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes were glazed and he didn\u2019t seem to understand what was so funny, but laughed along anyway. <i>Penis Parker</i>, along with other obscenities, was written all over his face. The kid\u2019s belt was unbuckled and a dark stain was spreading across the front of his pants.</p><p>Tony saw red.</p><p>Spinning the face of his watch, Tony felt metal cover his right hand as he rushed forward and grabbed the curly haired rat holding the phone with the other. He yelped as Tony shoved him up against the wall, fistful of fabric clutched in his left hand. Tony hardly registered the shouts over the blood roaring in his ears, and he pointed his right palm inches from his face, the repuslor ready to fire. The kid paled, and recognition suddenly sparked in Tony\u2019s eyes. </p><p><i>Flash. </i></p><p>Just when Tony thought the piece of shit was going to faint, he pointed his hand at the booming speaker standing in the corner and fired a single blast, killing it instantly.</p><p>\u201cParty\u2019s over,\u201d Tony yelled, not breaking eye contact for a second. Satisfied with the screams and footsteps pounding toward the front door, Tony tightened his grip on Flash\u2019s shirt and pointed his palm back at his face.</p><p>\u201cP-please don\u2019t-\u201d Tears had already started running down his face, and he looked so terrified Tony thought he was going to pee his pants. He internally shrugged, it would be poetic justice if he did.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you give him?\u201d Tony snarled, yanking on his collar harshly.</p><p>\u201cI-I only gave him a few beers,\u201d Flash choked out, pressing his head back into the wall as hard as he could to get away from the weapon.</p><p>\u201cBull. Shit.\u201d Tony pointed the repulsor even closer to his face and the light got brighter. </p><p>\u201cOkay! Okay! I- I don\u2019t remember, think it was three beers, some vodka, jungle juice, whiskey, and a c-couple shots of tequila.\u201d Tony thought he was going to lose it.</p><p>\u201cWhat was in the punch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I swear! Please-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was all of this, are you trying to kill him?\u201d Flash\u2019s eyes got even wider as tears continued to well in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo! I swear, it was just initiation for next year. I-I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I had to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looked like you were enjoying it to me.\u201d So it was the fraternity\u2019s doing. Tony kept the blaster trained on him, though in the back of his mind he knew he\u2019d never shoot the idiot, and looked back at the couch. The douchebags had already taken off, leaving Peter sitting on the ground. Ned had appeared and was helping Peter get his belt back on. He was crying. </p><p>\u201cYou know I could let all this get out, that Tony Stark\u2019s intern was nearly killed by his own classmate,\u201d Tony threatened, turning back to Flash who had managed to pale even more. \u201cNo university would ever admit you, and you certainly won\u2019t be getting my recommendation letter. Hell, the police might even get involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please. I\u2019ll do anything, Mr. Stark.\u201d The jerk was openly sobbing now. Tony didn\u2019t feel an ounce of sympathy.</p><p>Tony weighed his options. He could expose the punk, God knows he deserved it, but then that would create a huge mess that Tony knew Peter wouldn\u2019t appreciate. He glared at Flash, Tony had heard a lot about this asshole and found a deep satisfaction at seeing him blubber for mercy. This punk had bullied Peter since middle school, and had been relentless ever since. It had taken many long nights of coaxing for him to draw this information out of the kid, and whenever Peter showed up to the tower in tears, Tony knew why. He smiled, and that seemed to scare Flash even more.</p><p>\u201cOh I know you will,\u201d Tony said, lowering his hand and disarming the repulsor. He hit a button and it disappeared, collapsing back into his watch. \u201cFirst, I want the names of each and every prick who put you up to this.\u201d Flash nodded hastily, not showing a second thought about snitching on them. Tony grabbed a business card out of his shirt pocket with his free hand and let it flutter to the ground, his left hand still holding onto Flash\u2019s shirt. \u201cYou email me those names by tomorrow morning, or I\u2019m going to expose you as the ringleader, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond, I know who you are. You\u2019re a pathetic piece of shit that gets off on making Peter\u2019s life miserable. That stops now.\u201d Tony brought his face more inches from Flash\u2019s. \u201cIf I hear one more, just one more complaint about how you\u2019ve been cruel to him, all bets are off. Got it?\u201d Flash nodded vigorously. </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Tony released him and he slid to the ground. \u201cAnd if that video you took, surfaces anywhere and I mean <i>anywhere</i>, same deal. So I suggest you delete it.\u201d Flash scrambled for his phone and the business card on the ground, before hurriedly scrolling through it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s gone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSmart choice,\u201d Tony said, pulling Flash to his feet. \u201cNow get out.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to be told twice, as soon as Tony released him he ran toward the front door as fast as he could. When he turned around, Tony saw Ned crouched beside Peter, trying to console him. Peter\u2019s friend looked up and Tony cringed at the purple bruising that was already starting to color his nose. He looked at Tony sadly before turning back to his crying friend.</p><p>\u201cPeter it\u2019s okay, this isn\u2019t your fault. It was Flash\u2019s and those assholes. Remember in health class? Alcohol is a diuretic, you couldn\u2019t control it.\u201d Peter shook his head and continued to sob inconsolably. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, man. You\u2019re drunk, it basically doesn\u2019t count.\u201d </p><p>Tony walked over to Peter and sat on the couch, placing a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNed\u2019s right, Pete. Not your fault.\u201d Peter kept crying, but Tony wasn\u2019t sure if it was the alcohol or the embarrassment talking. \u00a0\u201cCome on, kiddo, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d Ned helped Tony pull Peter to his feet, and he stumbled, holding onto Tony for dear life. </p><p>\u201cRoom\u2019s spinning,\u201d he whimpered, trying to get his balance under control.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s going to be doing that for awhile.\u201d Tony helped the drunk teenager walk, while Ned kept a cautious hand on his back in case he fell. When they made it out of the house, Tony saw that everyone was gone, except for a few stragglers who watched them from a distance. Unlocking his car, Tony guided Peter into the passenger seat while Ned opened a door and slid into the seat behind his friend. Tony got into the driver\u2019s seat and pulled away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cUm, are you taking me home, Mister Stark?\u201d Tony glanced up to the rear view mirror and looked at Ned.</p><p>\u201cNot with that shiner. We\u2019re going back to the tower to get you both checked out first.\u201d Ned fell silent.</p><p>Tony focused back on the road and sped up. He needed to get Peter to the medbay to make sure the kid wasn\u2019t ODing, the only thing preventing him from going into a full fledged panic attack was the fact that he was still conscious. </p><p>\u201cM'ser Stark, I don\u2019 feel good,\u201d Peter slurred, shifting uncomfortably in the seat. He had stopped crying for the time being, but Tony doubted it would last for very long.</p><p>\u201cI know, buddy. We\u2019re almost there, just hang on-\u201d Tony was cut off when Peter suddenly pitched forward and vomited harshly all over the floorboard and himself. </p><p>\u201c<i>Shit!</i>\u201d Tony hit his steering wheel, and immediately regretted it when Peter jumped. He coughed and tears began running down his face again. Tony sighed, he definitely should have seen that coming. </p><p>\u201cOh no, oh no, m'so sorry, please don\u2019t be mad-\u201d Peter was interrupted when around gag tore from his throat and sent more of the foul liquid splashing onto the carpet. He was crying hard now, fingers pressed to his mouth as if it would stop any more from coming up. Tony cringed at the splattering beside him and the smell beginning to fill the car. His heart felt heavy at Peter\u2019s pleading, the kid almost sounded afraid. He cursed his knee jerk reaction and rubbed his back gently in an attempt to calm him down. </p><p>\u201cShhh, it\u2019s alright, buddy. I\u2019m not mad, it was just an accident. I\u2019m sorry if I scared you,\u201d he said gently, guilt writhing in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna puke again,\u201d Peter sobbed, looking around trying to find a way out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you do, Pete. Just breathe, okay? Don\u2019t worry about the car, it can be cleaned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, m'such an idiot,\u201d he cried into his hands sadly. \u201cI thought he finally liked me.\u201d Tony thought his heart was going to shatter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that, Pete. You\u2019re not an idiot, you\u2019re one of the smartest kids I\u2019ve ever met. Flash is the one with the problem, not you, kiddo.\u201d Ned shifted in the seat behind him, and Tony felt his face burn. He had forgotten that they weren\u2019t alone. Tony swallowed before making up his mind, he wasn\u2019t about to let his pride stand in the way of taking care of his kid. </p><p>\u201cWhy does he hate me so much?\u201d Peter continued to cry into his hands, making Tony wish he had beat the ever living shit out of Flash. He had seen the bruise starting to form on his face, and Ned\u2019s swollen knuckles made a surge of fondness for Peter\u2019s friend go through him. Peter looked down at the mess he\u2019d made of himself and whimpered. \u201cGod, m'so <i>gross</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not, buddy. It\u2019s alright. I need you to calm down for me, Pete, before you make yourself sick again.\u201d He kept rubbing small circles on Peter\u2019s back as they drove.</p><p>When they finally pulled up to the tower, Peter sat in the seat quietly, his sobs dying down to hiccups. Tony threw his seatbelt off and walked around the car to help Peter get out. Tony\u2019s stomach clenched as he opened the door, nausea threatening to take over. Vomit covered Peter\u2019s the bottom half of his shirt, lap, and shoes, but the carpet had taken the worst of it. Not to mention his pants were still soaked and was likely seeping into the seat\u2019s fabric. Tony steeled himself, this wasn\u2019t about him, it was about Peter and he needed his help. The kid fumbled with his seatbelt for several moments before Tony reached over and popped it open for him. His heart ached at Peter\u2019s red rimmed eyes, and Tony patted him on the back. </p><p>\u201cCome on, Pete, let\u2019s get you cleaned up.\u201d He dragged his feet out of the car and leaned heavily against the doorframe, evidently still dizzy.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d he whimpered, eyes closed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m going to help you, okay?\u201d Peter nodded, so Tony grabbed his arms and slowly helped him to his feet. He tried to take a step, but stumbled forward and fell against Tony\u2019s chest. He caught the kid just in time and wrapped his left arm tightly around Peter\u2019s waist, bearing some of his weight. Ned was standing beside the car uncertainly, clearly not sure what to do. Tony jerked his head toward the door.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get that nose looked at.\u201d After a significant amount of effort, Tony managed to get Peter up the stairs and into the elevator. When they staggered into the medbay, he couldn\u2019t say he blamed Bruce for the incredulous look on his face. He knew they must be quite a sight.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened, Tony? FRIDAY said it was important, but she didn\u2019t tell me much. Is Peter drunk?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHeeeeyy Bruce,\u201d Peter said, his eyes partly closed. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion. \u201cWait, why aren\u2019t you green? M'ser Stark shouldn\u2019 he be green?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that answers your question, Banner. Anyway, it\u2019s a long story. Mind checking his BAC?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Bruce said, rummaging through a drawer and grabbed a small device out before holding it in front of Peter. \u201cBlow into this, please.\u201d Peter did so, and when the machine beeped, Bruce checked the small screen and whistled.</p><p>\u201c0.18, that\u2019s pretty high.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs he going to be alright?\u201d Bruce let out a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOh he\u2019ll be fine, with his levels of metabolic activity from the mutation he\u2019d need about a gallon of pure vodka to overdose. But he\u2019ll be feeling it tomorrow, just like the rest of us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019 drink <i>that</i> much M'ser S'ark. Jus- had a few\u2026\u201d He mumbled, his eyes already drooping closed. Tony rolled his eyes and readjusted his grip on the kid.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever you say, Spiderling. Come on,\u201d Tony started guiding him out of the room. \u201cCan you check his friend out? Thinks his nose if broken. I\u2019m gonna go take care of drunkie, here.\u201d Bruce snapped some rubber gloves on and motioned for Ned to sit on a nearby table.</p><p>\u201cOf course. And what\u2019s your name?\u201d He asked as he started prodding the skin tenderly. Ned winced at the touch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ned. Aren\u2019t you the Hulk?\u201d Bruce smiled at his obvious excitement. </p><p>\u201cOnly on my bad days. Fortunately, today isn\u2019t one of them or I\u2019m afraid I wouldn\u2019t be much help to you at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, that\u2019s so cool! What does it feel like? Are you conscious when it happens or is it like a blackout?\u201d Ned continued to excitedly rattle off questions, seemingly unbothered by his injury for the moment. </p><p>Satisfied that Peter\u2019s friend would be taken care of, Tony headed back to the elevators, correcting Peter\u2019s balance every couple of steps. As they were riding up, Tony frowned when he realised that his shirt felt damp. It didn\u2019t take long to register that vomit had been smeared onto his own shirt, and he grimaced slightly. He reminded himself that it wasn\u2019t the kid\u2019s fault and stepped onto the residential floor. </p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Peter asked as they made their way to Tony\u2019s room. The bathroom there was the largest one on this floor, and he knew they\u2019d need as much space as they could get.</p><p>\u201cTo get you out of these clothes and hopefully into the shower.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, m'kay.\u201d They were nearly there when Peter shifted in his grip. \u201cGotta pee.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright, hang on. Almost there.\u201d Tony quickened their pace and as much he could. His pants were already a goner anyway, but if Peter didn\u2019t make it he knew he\u2019d be crying again, and that was the last thing Tony wanted. </p><p>They had finally staggered through the master bedroom, and into the bathroom when Peter whined and crossed his legs. Knowing they didn\u2019t have much time, Tony had Peter hold onto his shoulders while he hurriedly undid his belt for him. He knew the kid would never make it if he tried to do it himself. When it was open, he averted his eyes before pulling the fabric down and sitting him on the toilet. </p><p>\u201cWait, m'not a girl M'ser S'ark,\u201d Peter said, confusion evident on his face. He moved to get up, but Tony steadied him with a firm hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo shit, kid,\u201d Tony said, rolling his eyes. \u201cBut do you really think standing is such a good idea right now?\u201d The simplicity of that logic seemed to penetrate Peter\u2019s foggy mind and he shook his head. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to step out. Call me when you\u2019re done.\u201d </p><p>Tony didn\u2019t wait for a response as he left the bathroom, face burning. This was beyond weird, and he was pretty sure that this situation hadn\u2019t been spelled out in the internship contract he had signed. But what was he going to do? Lock the kid in a guest room and wish him luck? Hell no. Peter needed him right now, and if he was drunk off his ass, Tony knew without a doubt Peter would do the same for him. Though he prayed it never came to that, Tony was certain the mortification alone would kill him.</p><p>\u201cM'done, M'ser S'ark,\u201d Peter slurred from the bathroom. Tony came back into the room to see Peter leaning precariously to the right, and he was thankful the kid hadn\u2019t fallen off. </p><p>\u201cOkay, kid. Now let\u2019s get you out of these clothes, I\u2019m sure they aren\u2019t very comfortable.\u201d Tony knelt and started untying Peter\u2019s shoes while the kid struggled with his shirt. When both of them were off, he tugged his jeans and boxers the rest of the way off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019 look,\u201d Peter said, tossing the wet shirt onto the tile floor.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it, Pete,\u201d Tony promised, looking at the ceiling as he helped Peter stand and shuffle over to the large shower. </p><hr><p>Peter sat quietly on Tony\u2019s bed in fresh pajamas, struggling to keep his eyes open. It had been tricky, but he had managed to get the kid clean, though he made Peter sit under the spray of water. The last thing he needed was for him to slip and bash his head open. Tony brought a warm washcloth and a bottle of rubbing alcohol from the bathroom and sat beside him on the bed. Wetting the rag, Tony began gently rubbing at the marker off Peter\u2019s cheek. He was halfway done with his forehead, when Peter\u2019s face suddenly crumpled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, buddy? I didn\u2019t get any of this in your eyes, did I?\u201d A tear rolled down his cheek, quickly followed by more.</p><p>\u201cI miss Uncle Ben.\u201d Tony sighed, tossing the rag and bottle onto the comforter at Peter\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d he said softly, his heart clenching at the sadness all over Peter\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cH-he always took care of me when I was sick. Just like this,\u201d he sniffed, tears dripping onto the comforter.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter turned and wrapped his arms around Tony in a hug, burying his face in the crook of his neck. Tony returned it without a second thought and held him tightly. </p><p>\u201cShhhhh, it\u2019s alright. You\u2019re okay, you\u2019re alright,\u201d Tony soothed, carding his fingers through Peter\u2019s wet hair.</p><p>\u201cHe was jus\u2019 always there for me, and now he\u2019s not,\u201d he wept sadly. Tony didn\u2019t say anything and just held him. Hell, what could he say to that? </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Tony eventually managed, his chest aching.</p><p>\u201cBut tha\u2019s okay, m'not alone anymore,\u201d he sniffled.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot you now,\u201d Peter said simply before hugging him harder. Tony\u2019s throat tightened, if he hadn\u2019t been speechless before, he certainly was now. Tony figured it must be the alcohol talking. </p><p>Sure, he mentored the kid a little and let him help in his workshop from time to time, but he certainly wasn\u2019t a father figure. He was a terrible role model and was pretty pathetic with kids, but Peter didn\u2019t seem to care about any of those things.</p><p>Peter sniffled and Tony looked down at his intern that had him in a deathgrip, letting out a sigh. Who was he kidding? The kid was so much more than that, he was- well he was just Peter: a goofy kid from Queens who had somehow managed to squeeze his way into Tony\u2019s life. As much as he hated to admit it, Tony couldn\u2019t deny the warmth that began sprouting in his chest at Peter\u2019s admission. He remembered the late nights they\u2019d spent together tweaking the kid\u2019s suit, eating their weight in ice cream, and training together. Tony smiled softly to himself, he knew he definitely wouldn\u2019t have spent his Friday night like this for just any intern.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it looks like you do, kiddo,\u201d he said, resting a hand on top of Peter\u2019s head. The kid sighed contently and relaxed against him, and they sat that way for some time.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Pete, before you zonk out, at least let me get the rest of this crap off of your face. Can\u2019t have you looking like some shitty rapper.\u201d Peter whined at being dislodged from Tony\u2019s arms, and let him wipe the rest of the sharpie off. When Tony was done, the kid all but collapsed back into the bed, asleep before he hit the pillow. </p><p>\u201cWell good night to you too, Underoos,\u201d Tony snorted before making sure Peter was laying on his side in case he got sick again. Tossing a blanket over him, Tony grabbed the small trash can from beside his desk and put it on the floor next to the bed. Tony yawned and looked at his watch, it was almost three o'clock in the morning. He curled up in the armchair sitting beside the bathroom door and watched the blanket steadily rise and fall with Peter\u2019s breathing. Tony was asleep before he knew it.</p><hr><p>Peter cracked his eyes open and he immediately regretted doing so. The sunlight peering in through the window sent a sharp stab of pain through his head. All of his senses felt like they were dialed up to eleven, and he was pretty sure there was an ice pick being driven through his skull. His tongue was stuck to the roof of his mouth and his stomach felt like it was going to turn inside out at any moment. He groaned and closed his eyes when the room started to move.</p><p>Peter could feel acid beginning to creep up the back of his throat, and his swallowed thickly trying to prevent the inevitable. He didn\u2019t know where he was, and he was pretty sure whoever\u2019s bed he was laying in wouldn\u2019t appreciate him puking all over it. Tears pricked his eyes and he gagged, but thankfully nothing came up. He leaned over the bed and retched again, dreading the splattering that would accompany it as it hit the floor. But it never came.</p><p>\u201cEasy, kid. Let it out, I got you.\u201d Peter snapped his eyes back open, he\u2019d know that voice anywhere. Mister Stark was holding a bin up to his mouth and rubbing his back. How the hell did he get here?</p><p>\u201cWhat hap-\u201d Peter was cut off as he was sick again, though it was only bile at this point. Each heave made his head pound even harder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to speak. Thanks for the warning gag by the way, gave me time to grab this.\u201d Finally he spit the last of the saliva into the trashcan and fell back onto the bed, utterly exhausted. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgghh, my head,\u201d Peter groaned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought, kiddo. Welcome to the final stage of a fun night: regret.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He asked, eyes buried in the crook of his elbow. </p><p>\u201cDoes a college party ring any bells?\u201d </p><p>Yeah, it did. Hazy images flicked through his mind, the loud music, the alcohol, Flash punching Ned, his pants getting warm, the car ride. Oh God, the car ride. His face flushed as the rest of the memories filled his head, he had cried on Mister Stark. Peter didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever live it down.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d he groaned. \u201cMister Stark, I\u2019m so sorry. I was so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was pretty stupid, Pete,\u201d the man chuckled and sat on the bed beside him. \u201cBut definitely not the end of the world, I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I puked all over your car,\u201d Peter cringed. \u201cAnd your seat\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t get himself to say it.</p><p>\u201cEh, not a big deal, kiddo,\u201d Mister Stark waved the apology away. \u201cI have to admit, I\u2019ve given several of my other cars the same treatment and they survived.\u201d Peter nodded, and the man suddenly put his hand to his ear, listening to whoever was speaking in the piece.</p><p>\u201cYeah, send him up.\u201d</p><p>Peter suddenly felt all the blood rush to his feet. Flash had been recording him the whole time last night, tears began to well in his eyes again. The whole school must have seen him pissing himself like a toddler by now.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, what\u2019s going on, bud? Talk to me.\u201d He looked down and he felt a gentle hand land on his shoulder. Peter shook his head and sniffled. This was all so embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Pete, it\u2019s okay, really. I\u2019m not mad, everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d Peter felt a surge of anger and humiliation. Of course Mister Stark wouldn\u2019t understand, MJ was going to see it. Oh God, he\u2019d never be able to look her in the face again.</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not! Flash-\u201d Peter struggled with himself for a few moments, the anger was suddenly replaced with despair. \u201cEveryone\u2019s gonna know,\u201d he finally choked out. He could not, for the life of him, fathom why Mister Stark suddenly started laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you won\u2019t have to worry about that. Actually, he won\u2019t be bothering you ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say, I scared him a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little? He did more than that, Peter, I thought Flash was going to faint!\u201d Peter jerked his head up to see Ned walking through the door, smile plastered on his face. \u201cYou should have seen it, it was totally awesome. Had his blaster shoved in his face and everything!\u201d </p><p>\u201cReally? You did that for me?\u201d Peter asked, turning to his idol.</p><p>\u201cCourse I did, Underoos. Made sure he deleted the video and everything. See? No sweat.\u201d The relief made Peter want to laugh and cry at the same time. \u201cSpeaking of which, I need to go check my email,\u201d Tony said with a glint in his eye that Peter didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two keep each other company for awhile?\u201d The man headed for the door, but stopped and looked back. \u201cAnd, Ned? Thanks for calling me, I owe you one.\u201d He watched Mr. Stark leave and Ned plopped down at the foot of his bed, beaming. Shame sat heavily in his stomach when he saw the bandage on his best friend\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cNed, I\u2019m so sorry. I should have listened to you. If you don\u2019t want to be my friend anymore, I understand,\u201d Peter said dejectedly, staring hard at the blanket. Ned had told him it was a bad idea as soon as Flash invited them, but he hadn\u2019t listened. Now his friend had a broken nose, and it was all his fault.</p><p>\u201cDude, shut up. It doesn\u2019t even hurt that bad anymore, see?\u201d He poked the bandage hard and winced. \u201cOkay, that was a lie. It still hurts, but I don\u2019t care. I wasn\u2019t just gonna let Flash do all that to you, you\u2019re my best friend, Peter, I\u2019ll always have your back. Plus, after all these years I got to finally deck him, it felt awesome.\u201d Peter laughed with him, relieved he hadn\u2019t lost Ned. \u201cAnd I got to ride in Tony Stark\u2019s car, meet Doctor Banner, and sleep at the Avengers\u2019 hideout? Not to mention Stark said <i>he owed me one</i>. I\u2019m basically having a nerdgasm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGross dude,\u201d Peter laughed. \u201cAnd thanks, for\u2026you know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnytime, Spiderman. Just doing my duty as the guy in the chair.\u201d Ned turned and reached into his backpack. \u201cOh yeah, Doctor Banner said you\u2019d probably need this when you woke up.\u201d</p><p>Ned handed him a water bottle and a bottle of Tums. </p><p>\u201cOh, thank God. It feels like I have sand in my mouth,\u201d Peter said, quickly taking a huge swig. \u201cYou\u2019re the best, man.\u201d Ned smile and laid back, horizontally across the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p></p>",

Bless you for your patience, I hope you like it :)</p><hr /><p>Ned sat in an armchair and fumbled with his phone uneasily, casting an anxious glance at Peter from across the room. He raised his empty beer can to his lips again; everyone else around him was so drunk, no one had seen him slip into the kitchen and dump all of its contents in the sink shortly after having it shoved into his hands. He scrolled through his contact list again, desperate to find someone who could pick them up this late. They shouldn&rsquo;t have come, it was a mistake.<b><br /></b></p><p><i>MJ</i>. Out of town and she doesn&rsquo;t have a license either. Though he was pretty sure that wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped her.<i> Mom. Dad.</i> Nope, he wanted to survive the night. <i>May.</i> That would be even worse. <i>Peter.</i> Ned anxiously looked up from his phone, his friend was drunk out of his mind.</p><p>The night had started out promisingly enough, Flash had gotten them into their first college party as promised and no one seemed to mind their much younger company. Though Ned wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was because they didn&rsquo;t care or if they were too drunk to notice. Flash started shoving alcohol in Peter&rsquo;s face almost immediately, urging him to &lsquo;stop being such a pussy for once.&rsquo; When the unease on his friend&rsquo;s face turned into determination, Ned knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to end well.</p><p>Now, Peter was sitting on a couch with Flash and a group of frat guys. Ned couldn&rsquo;t hear what they were saying over the pounding music, but when, a relatively sober, Flash pushed another cup of jungle juice into Peter&rsquo;s hand, a sick feeling nestled itself in Ned&rsquo;s stomach. Something wasn&rsquo;t right. Flash and the others hadn&rsquo;t drank much themselves, and yet they seemed to be vigilantly making sure that Peter&rsquo;s cup was never empty for long.</p><p>Ned slipped his phone into his back pocket and took another &ldquo;drink&rdquo; from his beer as he approached the couch. Whatever was going on, he wasn&rsquo;t going to just sit there and let it happen.</p><p>&ldquo;-kid doesn&rsquo;t have a limit, holy shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How has he not passed out yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Initiation doesn&rsquo;t start &lsquo;til he does, newbie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, he will,&rdquo; Flash said, pouring what looked like straight vodka into a solo cup. &ldquo;I just thought he was more of a lightweight.&rdquo; Ned&rsquo;s stomach dropped. They were purposely trying to get Peter drunk. No, they had already succeeded at that, but his friend hadn&rsquo;t passed out yet. A chill went down his spine when he considered what they might &nbsp;have planned once Peter did. He definitely needed to get his friend out of here.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s had enough, Flash. Leave him alone,&rdquo; Ned said, reaching for his friend&rsquo;s arm. Flash jumped up from the couch and stood in between them, shoving Ned&rsquo;s hand away from Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you mind your own business, Leeds?&rdquo; Everyone on the couch was staring at Ned, and Peter suddenly realised he was there too.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh heeeyy, Ned. Wha&rsquo;s up, man?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I said, leave him alone.&rdquo; Before he saw it coming, Flash pushed him hard on the chest and Ned stumbled backward.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you make me, chubbs?&rdquo; He felt his face redden when the guys on the couch snickered to one another. Peter&rsquo;s eyebrows furrowed, finally realizing something was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;Ned don&rsquo; worry. S'fine, we&rsquo;re jus&rsquo; hangin&rsquo; out s'all,&rdquo; he slurred, taking another drink of punch. Flash took another step forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Leeds. You heard him, we&rsquo;re just hanging out, so why don&rsquo;t you fuck off?&rdquo; Ned swallowed at the four other guys smirking at him from the couch. He was badly outnumbered, and Ned knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to put up much of a fight against them. He bit the inside of his cheek, leaving Peter here meant leaving him at their mercy, and Ned didn&rsquo;t think he would ever be able to forgive himself if he did. He could feel tears beginning to sting the corners of his eyes, Ned looked away so Flash wouldn&rsquo;t see them. He clenched his fist, if trying to get Peter out of here meant getting beaten to a pulp, then it was worth it.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The challenge was plain as day, and a dangerous glint appeared in Flash&rsquo;s eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Flash looked over his shoulder at the older guys on the couch with a devilish grin. &ldquo;You hear that guys? I think it&rsquo;s time I showed-&rdquo;</p><p>He was cut off by Ned&rsquo;s fist connecting with his cheekbone, the force sent him sprawling backward and nearly to the ground. Flash frantically clawed at the couch to catch himself and narrowly avoided landing on Peter&rsquo;s lap. The college students howled with laughter and Flash&rsquo;s face turn murderous, Ned involuntarily took a step back. Flash charged at him, swinging wildly at his face with a speed that Ned hadn&rsquo;t expected. He managed to throw an arm up without a moment to spare, but Flash had already sent another jab downward and hit him solidly in the stomach. </p><p>Ned gasped as the wind was knocked out of him, inadvertently hunching over at the sudden pain. He heard hooting over the music, and what sounded like Peter&rsquo;s voice, but he had little time to contemplate the fact before a fist crashed into his nose. The next thing he knew, Ned was on the ground, tears blurring his vision from the pain. Flash was standing over him, smug victory plastered all over his face as he turned and grabbed something, throwing it on the floor by Ned&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Here, Leeds. Why don&rsquo;t you call your mommy and have her pick you up? Parker won&rsquo;t be needing it.&rdquo; When he finally got his eyes to focus, Ned saw it was Peter&rsquo;s phone that had clattered to the floor. He grabbed it hurriedly and shoved it in his pocket when Ned realized there was still one more thing he could try. </p><p>Flash had already turned back to the couch, fist bumping one of the jocks and laughing. Ned colored as he realised that quite a few others had gathered around to see the commotion, and were snickering at him. He quickly got up and weaved through the crowd of laughing college students toward the bathroom. Thankfully it was empty, so Ned slipped inside and shut the door behind him. </p><p>He cringed as he caught a glance of himself in the mirror; blood was streaming from his nose and had already gotten on his shirt. Ned grabbed a wad of toilet paper and tried to stem the flow as he unlocked Peter&rsquo;s phone. Ned smiled in spite of himself. Of course Peter&rsquo;s password was Spiderman.</p><p>He scrolled through Peter&rsquo;s contact list and prayed that the number he was looking for was there. Finally, he found it and sent a quick text.</p><p><b>Peter Parker: </b>Please call me. It&rsquo;s important.</p><p>The reply came in under a minute.</p><p><b>Tony freaking Stark &#128561;&#128561;:</b> At nearly midnight? Kid, I&rsquo;m getting old, how do you know I&rsquo;m not in bed already?</p><p><b>Tony freaking Stark &#128561;&#128561;:</b> Actually scratch that, who am I kidding?</p><p><b>Tony freaking Stark&#128561;&#128561;:</b> and btw, the last time you said it was important, you just wanted to tell me about that morbidly obese squirrel you saw in central park.</p><p>Ned rolled his eyes, and tapped out a hurried reply.</p><p><b>Peter Parker</b>: Urgent.</p><p>Apparently that was all the man needed to hear because the phone started vibrating almost immediately. Ned made sure the door was locked, and he picked it up.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, kid?&rdquo; The joking had disappeared without a trace, and Ned was grateful.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, I&rsquo;m sorry to bother you.&rdquo; Ned tilted his head back. &ldquo;But this is an emergency-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is this and why do you have Peter&rsquo;s phone?&rdquo; Ned cringed, how was he supposed to explain that he and Peter had thought it was a good idea to go to a college party? Let alone at Flash&rsquo;s recommendation.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, this is Peter&rsquo;s friend-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ted? What&rsquo;s going on? And why does your voice sound like that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ned- never mind that doesn&rsquo;t matter. I kind of got punched, I think my nose is broken.&rdquo; He prodded it with his fingers and yelped at the jolt that shot through his face. &ldquo;No, yeah it&rsquo;s definitely broken.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i> I&rsquo;m going to need you to back up here, where are you guys?&rdquo; Ned swallowed, well here went nothing. He just hoped Mr. Stark didn&rsquo;t fly him to the top of the Empire State building and leave him there after all of this.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter and I went to a party, and there&rsquo;s a bunch of guys getting Peter drunk. I tried to stop it, Mr. Stark, I swear, I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; Ned&rsquo;s voice broke as tears slipped down his face. Why hadn&rsquo;t he tried harder to talk Peter out of going? Some friend he was.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa, hang on. I need you to keep it together for little bit longer. I&rsquo;m already on the way to my car.&rdquo; From what it sounded like, Ned knew Mr. Stark was actually running there. &ldquo;Where are you and Peter right now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I locked myself in the bathroom, and Peter was on the couch when I left. Please hurry, Mr. Stark, I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re going to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, stay there. Text me the address, I&rsquo;ll be there as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Tony gripped his steering wheel tightly as he floored it. A rage he had never felt before was running hot through his veins. He had been angry when his mansion, along with his life&rsquo;s work, had been blown to hell off a cliff. When the plane Happy had insisted was secure, also carrying his life&rsquo;s work, had been destroyed and nearly took Peter with it, Tony had been furious. This was different, a fiery protectiveness bloomed in his chest. There was going to be hell to pay.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete, what did you get yourself into,&rdquo; he muttered to himself when the house came into view. Tony didn&rsquo;t look to verify the address number, there wasn&rsquo;t any need to. There were drunk college kids <i>everywhere. </i></p><p>The house clearly belonged to a fraternity, its greek symbol sat above the front door and was plastered to several flags hanging beside it. Not to mention one of the jocks had it painted across his bare chest. Tony smiled grimly, this fraternity was going to be shut down come Monday morning. The best part was that it would only take a single letter to the dean explaining that his intern had been victimized, and he would refuse to continue making rather<i> generous</i> donations if such action was not taken. These punks didn&rsquo;t stand a chance.</p><p>Tony parked in front of the house and stepped out into the street before cutting across the lawn, toward the front door.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, nice car, man!&rdquo; </p><p>He ignored the shout and continued walking. Several of the partiers had quieted down and were watching him anxiously, suddenly aware that an adult was present. Tony walked up the porch steps and headed through the open door.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what do you think you&rsquo;re-&rdquo; Shirtless toughguy stepped forward to stop him, but froze when he saw who was walking into his frat house. Tony smirked, kid didn&rsquo;t even know what was gonna hit him.</p><p>The music got even louder when he was inside, Tony was surprised none of the frames on the wall had fallen off at the absurd amount of bass vibrating through the house. He walked past the staircase and pushed through a group of girls in skimpy outfits toward what he assumed was the living room. That&rsquo;s where Ned had said Peter was, right?</p><p>His question was answered when a roar of laughter erupted ahead of him.</p><p>&ldquo;No way, he&rsquo;s actually pissing himself!&rdquo; Tony shoved his way into the room and froze at what he saw.</p><p>Peter was sitting on the ground, his back pressed against the couch and a red solo cup held in his hand at a precarious angle. There was a group of jocks sitting behind him on the cushions, watching with interest, almost like they were supervising the whole thing. They looked like Grade A douchebags, complete with bad tans and muscle shirts with sleazy catch phrases in neon lettering. One of the shirts read: <i>Leg Rests</i> and had an arrow pointing at each shoulder. A much younger kid that caught Tony&rsquo;s eye, the one who had shouted, was standing in front of Peter recording. The bright light coming from his phone shined in Peter&rsquo;s face and he clumsily tried to block it with his hand.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes were glazed and he didn&rsquo;t seem to understand what was so funny, but laughed along anyway. <i>Penis Parker</i>, along with other obscenities, was written all over his face. The kid&rsquo;s belt was unbuckled and a dark stain was spreading across the front of his pants.</p><p>Tony saw red.</p><p>Spinning the face of his watch, Tony felt metal cover his right hand as he rushed forward and grabbed the curly haired rat holding the phone with the other. He yelped as Tony shoved him up against the wall, fistful of fabric clutched in his left hand. Tony hardly registered the shouts over the blood roaring in his ears, and he pointed his right palm inches from his face, the repuslor ready to fire. The kid paled, and recognition suddenly sparked in Tony&rsquo;s eyes. </p><p><i>Flash. </i></p><p>Just when Tony thought the piece of shit was going to faint, he pointed his hand at the booming speaker standing in the corner and fired a single blast, killing it instantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Party&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; Tony yelled, not breaking eye contact for a second. Satisfied with the screams and footsteps pounding toward the front door, Tony tightened his grip on Flash&rsquo;s shirt and pointed his palm back at his face.</p><p>&ldquo;P-please don&rsquo;t-&rdquo; Tears had already started running down his face, and he looked so terrified Tony thought he was going to pee his pants. He internally shrugged, it would be poetic justice if he did.</p><p>&ldquo;How much did you give him?&rdquo; Tony snarled, yanking on his collar harshly.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I only gave him a few beers,&rdquo; Flash choked out, pressing his head back into the wall as hard as he could to get away from the weapon.</p><p>&ldquo;Bull. Shit.&rdquo; Tony pointed the repulsor even closer to his face and the light got brighter. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay! Okay! I- I don&rsquo;t remember, think it was three beers, some vodka, jungle juice, whiskey, and a c-couple shots of tequila.&rdquo; Tony thought he was going to lose it.</p><p>&ldquo;What was in the punch?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I swear! Please-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What was all of this, are you trying to kill him?&rdquo; Flash&rsquo;s eyes got even wider as tears continued to well in his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;No! I swear, it was just initiation for next year. I-I didn&rsquo;t want to do it, but I had to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It looked like you were enjoying it to me.&rdquo; So it was the fraternity&rsquo;s doing. Tony kept the blaster trained on him, though in the back of his mind he knew he&rsquo;d never shoot the idiot, and looked back at the couch. The douchebags had already taken off, leaving Peter sitting on the ground. Ned had appeared and was helping Peter get his belt back on. He was crying. </p><p>&ldquo;You know I could let all this get out, that Tony Stark&rsquo;s intern was nearly killed by his own classmate,&rdquo; Tony threatened, turning back to Flash who had managed to pale even more. &ldquo;No university would ever admit you, and you certainly won&rsquo;t be getting my recommendation letter. Hell, the police might even get involved.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, please. I&rsquo;ll do anything, Mr. Stark.&rdquo; The jerk was openly sobbing now. Tony didn&rsquo;t feel an ounce of sympathy.</p><p>Tony weighed his options. He could expose the punk, God knows he deserved it, but then that would create a huge mess that Tony knew Peter wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate. He glared at Flash, Tony had heard a lot about this asshole and found a deep satisfaction at seeing him blubber for mercy. This punk had bullied Peter since middle school, and had been relentless ever since. It had taken many long nights of coaxing for him to draw this information out of the kid, and whenever Peter showed up to the tower in tears, Tony knew why. He smiled, and that seemed to scare Flash even more.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I know you will,&rdquo; Tony said, lowering his hand and disarming the repulsor. He hit a button and it disappeared, collapsing back into his watch. &ldquo;First, I want the names of each and every prick who put you up to this.&rdquo; Flash nodded hastily, not showing a second thought about snitching on them. Tony grabbed a business card out of his shirt pocket with his free hand and let it flutter to the ground, his left hand still holding onto Flash&rsquo;s shirt. &ldquo;You email me those names by tomorrow morning, or I&rsquo;m going to expose you as the ringleader, do you understand?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Second, I know who you are. You&rsquo;re a pathetic piece of shit that gets off on making Peter&rsquo;s life miserable. That stops now.&rdquo; Tony brought his face more inches from Flash&rsquo;s. &ldquo;If I hear one more, just one more complaint about how you&rsquo;ve been cruel to him, all bets are off. Got it?&rdquo; Flash nodded vigorously. </p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Tony released him and he slid to the ground. &ldquo;And if that video you took, surfaces anywhere and I mean <i>anywhere</i>, same deal. So I suggest you delete it.&rdquo; Flash scrambled for his phone and the business card on the ground, before hurriedly scrolling through it.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Smart choice,&rdquo; Tony said, pulling Flash to his feet. &ldquo;Now get out.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t need to be told twice, as soon as Tony released him he ran toward the front door as fast as he could. When he turned around, Tony saw Ned crouched beside Peter, trying to console him. Peter&rsquo;s friend looked up and Tony cringed at the purple bruising that was already starting to color his nose. He looked at Tony sadly before turning back to his crying friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter it&rsquo;s okay, this isn&rsquo;t your fault. It was Flash&rsquo;s and those assholes. Remember in health class? Alcohol is a diuretic, you couldn&rsquo;t control it.&rdquo; Peter shook his head and continued to sob inconsolably. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, man. You&rsquo;re drunk, it basically doesn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony walked over to Peter and sat on the couch, placing a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Ned&rsquo;s right, Pete. Not your fault.&rdquo; Peter kept crying, but Tony wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was the alcohol or the embarrassment talking. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come on, kiddo, it&rsquo;s time to go.&rdquo; Ned helped Tony pull Peter to his feet, and he stumbled, holding onto Tony for dear life. </p><p>&ldquo;Room&rsquo;s spinning,&rdquo; he whimpered, trying to get his balance under control.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s going to be doing that for awhile.&rdquo; Tony helped the drunk teenager walk, while Ned kept a cautious hand on his back in case he fell. When they made it out of the house, Tony saw that everyone was gone, except for a few stragglers who watched them from a distance. Unlocking his car, Tony guided Peter into the passenger seat while Ned opened a door and slid into the seat behind his friend. Tony got into the driver&rsquo;s seat and pulled away from the curb.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, are you taking me home, Mister Stark?&rdquo; Tony glanced up to the rear view mirror and looked at Ned.</p><p>&ldquo;Not with that shiner. We&rsquo;re going back to the tower to get you both checked out first.&rdquo; Ned fell silent.</p><p>Tony focused back on the road and sped up. He needed to get Peter to the medbay to make sure the kid wasn&rsquo;t ODing, the only thing preventing him from going into a full fledged panic attack was the fact that he was still conscious. </p><p>&ldquo;M'ser Stark, I don&rsquo; feel good,&rdquo; Peter slurred, shifting uncomfortably in the seat. He had stopped crying for the time being, but Tony doubted it would last for very long.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, buddy. We&rsquo;re almost there, just hang on-&rdquo; Tony was cut off when Peter suddenly pitched forward and vomited harshly all over the floorboard and himself. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Shit!</i>&rdquo; Tony hit his steering wheel, and immediately regretted it when Peter jumped. He coughed and tears began running down his face again. Tony sighed, he definitely should have seen that coming. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, oh no, m'so sorry, please don&rsquo;t be mad-&rdquo; Peter was interrupted when around gag tore from his throat and sent more of the foul liquid splashing onto the carpet. He was crying hard now, fingers pressed to his mouth as if it would stop any more from coming up. Tony cringed at the splattering beside him and the smell beginning to fill the car. His heart felt heavy at Peter&rsquo;s pleading, the kid almost sounded afraid. He cursed his knee jerk reaction and rubbed his back gently in an attempt to calm him down. </p><p>&ldquo;Shhh, it&rsquo;s alright, buddy. I&rsquo;m not mad, it was just an accident. I&rsquo;m sorry if I scared you,&rdquo; he said gently, guilt writhing in his stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m gonna puke again,&rdquo; Peter sobbed, looking around trying to find a way out.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay if you do, Pete. Just breathe, okay? Don&rsquo;t worry about the car, it can be cleaned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, m'such an idiot,&rdquo; he cried into his hands sadly. &ldquo;I thought he finally liked me.&rdquo; Tony thought his heart was going to shatter.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare say that, Pete. You&rsquo;re not an idiot, you&rsquo;re one of the smartest kids I&rsquo;ve ever met. Flash is the one with the problem, not you, kiddo.&rdquo; Ned shifted in the seat behind him, and Tony felt his face burn. He had forgotten that they weren&rsquo;t alone. Tony swallowed before making up his mind, he wasn&rsquo;t about to let his pride stand in the way of taking care of his kid. </p><p>&ldquo;Why does he hate me so much?&rdquo; Peter continued to cry into his hands, making Tony wish he had beat the ever living shit out of Flash. He had seen the bruise starting to form on his face, and Ned&rsquo;s swollen knuckles made a surge of fondness for Peter&rsquo;s friend go through him. Peter looked down at the mess he&rsquo;d made of himself and whimpered. &ldquo;God, m'so <i>gross</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not, buddy. It&rsquo;s alright. I need you to calm down for me, Pete, before you make yourself sick again.&rdquo; He kept rubbing small circles on Peter&rsquo;s back as they drove.</p><p>When they finally pulled up to the tower, Peter sat in the seat quietly, his sobs dying down to hiccups. Tony threw his seatbelt off and walked around the car to help Peter get out. Tony&rsquo;s stomach clenched as he opened the door, nausea threatening to take over. Vomit covered Peter&rsquo;s the bottom half of his shirt, lap, and shoes, but the carpet had taken the worst of it. Not to mention his pants were still soaked and was likely seeping into the seat&rsquo;s fabric. Tony steeled himself, this wasn&rsquo;t about him, it was about Peter and he needed his help. The kid fumbled with his seatbelt for several moments before Tony reached over and popped it open for him. His heart ached at Peter&rsquo;s red rimmed eyes, and Tony patted him on the back. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Pete, let&rsquo;s get you cleaned up.&rdquo; He dragged his feet out of the car and leaned heavily against the doorframe, evidently still dizzy.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he whimpered, eyes closed. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;m going to help you, okay?&rdquo; Peter nodded, so Tony grabbed his arms and slowly helped him to his feet. He tried to take a step, but stumbled forward and fell against Tony&rsquo;s chest. He caught the kid just in time and wrapped his left arm tightly around Peter&rsquo;s waist, bearing some of his weight. Ned was standing beside the car uncertainly, clearly not sure what to do. Tony jerked his head toward the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s get that nose looked at.&rdquo; After a significant amount of effort, Tony managed to get Peter up the stairs and into the elevator. When they staggered into the medbay, he couldn&rsquo;t say he blamed Bruce for the incredulous look on his face. He knew they must be quite a sight.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell happened, Tony? FRIDAY said it was important, but she didn&rsquo;t tell me much. Is Peter drunk?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Heeeeyy Bruce,&rdquo; Peter said, his eyes partly closed. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion. &ldquo;Wait, why aren&rsquo;t you green? M'ser Stark shouldn&rsquo; he be green?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think that answers your question, Banner. Anyway, it&rsquo;s a long story. Mind checking his BAC?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; Bruce said, rummaging through a drawer and grabbed a small device out before holding it in front of Peter. &ldquo;Blow into this, please.&rdquo; Peter did so, and when the machine beeped, Bruce checked the small screen and whistled.</p><p>&ldquo;0.18, that&rsquo;s pretty high.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is he going to be alright?&rdquo; Bruce let out a chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh he&rsquo;ll be fine, with his levels of metabolic activity from the mutation he&rsquo;d need about a gallon of pure vodka to overdose. But he&rsquo;ll be feeling it tomorrow, just like the rest of us.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo; drink <i>that</i> much M'ser S'ark. Jus- had a few&hellip;&rdquo; He mumbled, his eyes already drooping closed. Tony rolled his eyes and readjusted his grip on the kid.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, whatever you say, Spiderling. Come on,&rdquo; Tony started guiding him out of the room. &ldquo;Can you check his friend out? Thinks his nose if broken. I&rsquo;m gonna go take care of drunkie, here.&rdquo; Bruce snapped some rubber gloves on and motioned for Ned to sit on a nearby table.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. And what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; He asked as he started prodding the skin tenderly. Ned winced at the touch.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ned. Aren&rsquo;t you the Hulk?&rdquo; Bruce smiled at his obvious excitement. </p><p>&ldquo;Only on my bad days. Fortunately, today isn&rsquo;t one of them or I&rsquo;m afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t be much help to you at the moment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my gosh, that&rsquo;s so cool! What does it feel like? Are you conscious when it happens or is it like a blackout?&rdquo; Ned continued to excitedly rattle off questions, seemingly unbothered by his injury for the moment. </p><p>Satisfied that Peter&rsquo;s friend would be taken care of, Tony headed back to the elevators, correcting Peter&rsquo;s balance every couple of steps. As they were riding up, Tony frowned when he realised that his shirt felt damp. It didn&rsquo;t take long to register that vomit had been smeared onto his own shirt, and he grimaced slightly. He reminded himself that it wasn&rsquo;t the kid&rsquo;s fault and stepped onto the residential floor. </p><p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Peter asked as they made their way to Tony&rsquo;s room. The bathroom there was the largest one on this floor, and he knew they&rsquo;d need as much space as they could get.</p><p>&ldquo;To get you out of these clothes and hopefully into the shower.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, m'kay.&rdquo; They were nearly there when Peter shifted in his grip. &ldquo;Gotta pee.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, hang on. Almost there.&rdquo; Tony quickened their pace and as much he could. His pants were already a goner anyway, but if Peter didn&rsquo;t make it he knew he&rsquo;d be crying again, and that was the last thing Tony wanted. </p><p>They had finally staggered through the master bedroom, and into the bathroom when Peter whined and crossed his legs. Knowing they didn&rsquo;t have much time, Tony had Peter hold onto his shoulders while he hurriedly undid his belt for him. He knew the kid would never make it if he tried to do it himself. When it was open, he averted his eyes before pulling the fabric down and sitting him on the toilet. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, m'not a girl M'ser S'ark,&rdquo; Peter said, confusion evident on his face. He moved to get up, but Tony steadied him with a firm hand on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;No shit, kid,&rdquo; Tony said, rolling his eyes. &ldquo;But do you really think standing is such a good idea right now?&rdquo; The simplicity of that logic seemed to penetrate Peter&rsquo;s foggy mind and he shook his head. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m going to step out. Call me when you&rsquo;re done.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t wait for a response as he left the bathroom, face burning. This was beyond weird, and he was pretty sure that this situation hadn&rsquo;t been spelled out in the internship contract he had signed. But what was he going to do? Lock the kid in a guest room and wish him luck? Hell no. Peter needed him right now, and if he was drunk off his ass, Tony knew without a doubt Peter would do the same for him. Though he prayed it never came to that, Tony was certain the mortification alone would kill him.</p><p>&ldquo;M'done, M'ser S'ark,&rdquo; Peter slurred from the bathroom. Tony came back into the room to see Peter leaning precariously to the right, and he was thankful the kid hadn&rsquo;t fallen off. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, kid. Now let&rsquo;s get you out of these clothes, I&rsquo;m sure they aren&rsquo;t very comfortable.&rdquo; Tony knelt and started untying Peter&rsquo;s shoes while the kid struggled with his shirt. When both of them were off, he tugged his jeans and boxers the rest of the way off.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo; look,&rdquo; Peter said, tossing the wet shirt onto the tile floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t dream of it, Pete,&rdquo; Tony promised, looking at the ceiling as he helped Peter stand and shuffle over to the large shower. </p><hr /><p>Peter sat quietly on Tony&rsquo;s bed in fresh pajamas, struggling to keep his eyes open. It had been tricky, but he had managed to get the kid clean, though he made Peter sit under the spray of water. The last thing he needed was for him to slip and bash his head open. Tony brought a warm washcloth and a bottle of rubbing alcohol from the bathroom and sat beside him on the bed. Wetting the rag, Tony began gently rubbing at the marker off Peter&rsquo;s cheek. He was halfway done with his forehead, when Peter&rsquo;s face suddenly crumpled.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, buddy? I didn&rsquo;t get any of this in your eyes, did I?&rdquo; A tear rolled down his cheek, quickly followed by more.</p><p>&ldquo;I miss Uncle Ben.&rdquo; Tony sighed, tossing the rag and bottle onto the comforter at Peter&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you do,&rdquo; he said softly, his heart clenching at the sadness all over Peter&rsquo;s face. </p><p>&ldquo;H-he always took care of me when I was sick. Just like this,&rdquo; he sniffed, tears dripping onto the comforter.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter turned and wrapped his arms around Tony in a hug, burying his face in the crook of his neck. Tony returned it without a second thought and held him tightly. </p><p>&ldquo;Shhhhh, it&rsquo;s alright. You&rsquo;re okay, you&rsquo;re alright,&rdquo; Tony soothed, carding his fingers through Peter&rsquo;s wet hair.</p><p>&ldquo;He was jus&rsquo; always there for me, and now he&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; he wept sadly. Tony didn&rsquo;t say anything and just held him. Hell, what could he say to that? </p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Tony eventually managed, his chest aching.</p><p>&ldquo;But tha&rsquo;s okay, m'not alone anymore,&rdquo; he sniffled.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean, buddy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Got you now,&rdquo; Peter said simply before hugging him harder. Tony&rsquo;s throat tightened, if he hadn&rsquo;t been speechless before, he certainly was now. Tony figured it must be the alcohol talking. </p><p>Sure, he mentored the kid a little and let him help in his workshop from time to time, but he certainly wasn&rsquo;t a father figure. He was a terrible role model and was pretty pathetic with kids, but Peter didn&rsquo;t seem to care about any of those things.</p><p>Peter sniffled and Tony looked down at his intern that had him in a deathgrip, letting out a sigh. Who was he kidding? The kid was so much more than that, he was- well he was just Peter: a goofy kid from Queens who had somehow managed to squeeze his way into Tony&rsquo;s life. As much as he hated to admit it, Tony couldn&rsquo;t deny the warmth that began sprouting in his chest at Peter&rsquo;s admission. He remembered the late nights they&rsquo;d spent together tweaking the kid&rsquo;s suit, eating their weight in ice cream, and training together. Tony smiled softly to himself, he knew he definitely wouldn&rsquo;t have spent his Friday night like this for just any intern.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it looks like you do, kiddo,&rdquo; he said, resting a hand on top of Peter&rsquo;s head. The kid sighed contently and relaxed against him, and they sat that way for some time.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, Pete, before you zonk out, at least let me get the rest of this crap off of your face. Can&rsquo;t have you looking like some shitty rapper.&rdquo; Peter whined at being dislodged from Tony&rsquo;s arms, and let him wipe the rest of the sharpie off. When Tony was done, the kid all but collapsed back into the bed, asleep before he hit the pillow. </p><p>&ldquo;Well good night to you too, Underoos,&rdquo; Tony snorted before making sure Peter was laying on his side in case he got sick again. Tossing a blanket over him, Tony grabbed the small trash can from beside his desk and put it on the floor next to the bed. Tony yawned and looked at his watch, it was almost three o'clock in the morning. He curled up in the armchair sitting beside the bathroom door and watched the blanket steadily rise and fall with Peter&rsquo;s breathing. Tony was asleep before he knew it.</p><hr /><p>Peter cracked his eyes open and he immediately regretted doing so. The sunlight peering in through the window sent a sharp stab of pain through his head. All of his senses felt like they were dialed up to eleven, and he was pretty sure there was an ice pick being driven through his skull. His tongue was stuck to the roof of his mouth and his stomach felt like it was going to turn inside out at any moment. He groaned and closed his eyes when the room started to move.</p><p>Peter could feel acid beginning to creep up the back of his throat, and his swallowed thickly trying to prevent the inevitable. He didn&rsquo;t know where he was, and he was pretty sure whoever&rsquo;s bed he was laying in wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate him puking all over it. Tears pricked his eyes and he gagged, but thankfully nothing came up. He leaned over the bed and retched again, dreading the splattering that would accompany it as it hit the floor. But it never came.</p><p>&ldquo;Easy, kid. Let it out, I got you.&rdquo; Peter snapped his eyes back open, he&rsquo;d know that voice anywhere. Mister Stark was holding a bin up to his mouth and rubbing his back. How the hell did he get here?</p><p>&ldquo;What hap-&rdquo; Peter was cut off as he was sick again, though it was only bile at this point. Each heave made his head pound even harder.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to speak. Thanks for the warning gag by the way, gave me time to grab this.&rdquo; Finally he spit the last of the saliva into the trashcan and fell back onto the bed, utterly exhausted. &ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugghh, my head,&rdquo; Peter groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I thought, kiddo. Welcome to the final stage of a fun night: regret.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; He asked, eyes buried in the crook of his elbow. </p><p>&ldquo;Does a college party ring any bells?&rdquo; </p><p>Yeah, it did. Hazy images flicked through his mind, the loud music, the alcohol, Flash punching Ned, his pants getting warm, the car ride. Oh God, the car ride. His face flushed as the rest of the memories filled his head, he had cried on Mister Stark. Peter didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ever live it down.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Mister Stark, I&rsquo;m so sorry. I was so stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that was pretty stupid, Pete,&rdquo; the man chuckled and sat on the bed beside him. &ldquo;But definitely not the end of the world, I&rsquo;m just glad you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry I puked all over your car,&rdquo; Peter cringed. &ldquo;And your seat&hellip;&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t get himself to say it.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, not a big deal, kiddo,&rdquo; Mister Stark waved the apology away. &ldquo;I have to admit, I&rsquo;ve given several of my other cars the same treatment and they survived.&rdquo; Peter nodded, and the man suddenly put his hand to his ear, listening to whoever was speaking in the piece.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, send him up.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter suddenly felt all the blood rush to his feet. Flash had been recording him the whole time last night, tears began to well in his eyes again. The whole school must have seen him pissing himself like a toddler by now.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa, what&rsquo;s going on, bud? Talk to me.&rdquo; He looked down and he felt a gentle hand land on his shoulder. Peter shook his head and sniffled. This was all so embarrassing.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Pete, it&rsquo;s okay, really. I&rsquo;m not mad, everything&rsquo;s going to be fine.&rdquo; Peter felt a surge of anger and humiliation. Of course Mister Stark wouldn&rsquo;t understand, MJ was going to see it. Oh God, he&rsquo;d never be able to look her in the face again.</p><p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s not! Flash-&rdquo; Peter struggled with himself for a few moments, the anger was suddenly replaced with despair. &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s gonna know,&rdquo; he finally choked out. He could not, for the life of him, fathom why Mister Stark suddenly started laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you won&rsquo;t have to worry about that. Actually, he won&rsquo;t be bothering you ever again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say, I scared him a little.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A little? He did more than that, Peter, I thought Flash was going to faint!&rdquo; Peter jerked his head up to see Ned walking through the door, smile plastered on his face. &ldquo;You should have seen it, it was totally awesome. Had his blaster shoved in his face and everything!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Really? You did that for me?&rdquo; Peter asked, turning to his idol.</p><p>&ldquo;Course I did, Underoos. Made sure he deleted the video and everything. See? No sweat.&rdquo; The relief made Peter want to laugh and cry at the same time. &ldquo;Speaking of which, I need to go check my email,&rdquo; Tony said with a glint in his eye that Peter didn&rsquo;t understand. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you two keep each other company for awhile?&rdquo; The man headed for the door, but stopped and looked back. &ldquo;And, Ned? Thanks for calling me, I owe you one.&rdquo; He watched Mr. Stark leave and Ned plopped down at the foot of his bed, beaming. Shame sat heavily in his stomach when he saw the bandage on his best friend&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Ned, I&rsquo;m so sorry. I should have listened to you. If you don&rsquo;t want to be my friend anymore, I understand,&rdquo; Peter said dejectedly, staring hard at the blanket. Ned had told him it was a bad idea as soon as Flash invited them, but he hadn&rsquo;t listened. Now his friend had a broken nose, and it was all his fault.</p><p>&ldquo;Dude, shut up. It doesn&rsquo;t even hurt that bad anymore, see?&rdquo; He poked the bandage hard and winced. &ldquo;Okay, that was a lie. It still hurts, but I don&rsquo;t care. I wasn&rsquo;t just gonna let Flash do all that to you, you&rsquo;re my best friend, Peter, I&rsquo;ll always have your back. Plus, after all these years I got to finally deck him, it felt awesome.&rdquo; Peter laughed with him, relieved he hadn&rsquo;t lost Ned. &ldquo;And I got to ride in Tony Stark&rsquo;s car, meet Doctor Banner, and sleep at the Avengers&rsquo; hideout? Not to mention Stark said <i>he owed me one</i>. I&rsquo;m basically having a nerdgasm.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Gross dude,&rdquo; Peter laughed. &ldquo;And thanks, for&hellip;you know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Anytime, Spiderman. Just doing my duty as the guy in the chair.&rdquo; Ned turned and reached into his backpack. &ldquo;Oh yeah, Doctor Banner said you&rsquo;d probably need this when you woke up.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned handed him a water bottle and a bottle of Tums. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, thank God. It feels like I have sand in my mouth,&rdquo; Peter said, quickly taking a huge swig. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best, man.&rdquo; Ned smile and laid back, horizontally across the foot of the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p></p>",

Bless you for your patience, I hope you like it :)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ned sat in an armchair and fumbled with his phone uneasily, casting an anxious glance at Peter from across the room. He raised his empty beer can to his lips again; everyone else around him was so drunk, no one had seen him slip into the kitchen and dump all of its contents in the sink shortly after having it shoved into his hands. He scrolled through his contact list again, desperate to find someone who could pick them up this late. They shouldn&rsquo;t have come, it was a mistake.<b><br /></b></p>\n<p><i>MJ</i>. Out of town and she doesn&rsquo;t have a license either. Though he was pretty sure that wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped her.<i> Mom.

Though Ned wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was because they didn&rsquo;t care or if they were too drunk to notice. Flash started shoving alcohol in Peter&rsquo;s face almost immediately, urging him to &lsquo;stop being such a pussy for once.&rsquo; When the unease on his friend&rsquo;s face turned into determination, Ned knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to end well.</p>\n</p>",
