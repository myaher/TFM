Tyrion is a father slayer btw, kind of like Jon is an aunt slayer. And they both murdered women that were their lovers.</p><h2>In conclusion.</h2><p>I love Bran but left face it, Westerosis like Dothraki don&rsquo;t follow the weak.</p><h2>2. Jon. </h2><p>Even after becoming Queenslayer he&rsquo;s still a contender for the main seat with the support of the North and potentially Riverlands, Vale and Stormlands, a military commander with plenty of experience and a war hero after the War with the dead. </p><p>All of this WITHOUT even considering he has the &ldquo;right&rdquo; blood. The Targs were deposed what? For twenty years?. Not even?. There are Targ loyalists still alive out there and ruling dinasties don&rsquo;t just banish into thin air. I mean how long was the War of the Roses? Weren&rsquo;t all Lancaster heirs persecuted for the hint of royal blood they had?. Weren&rsquo;t the Warwicks still regarded as &ldquo;rightful heirs&rdquo; even during Henry VIII reign (and he was far more popular and successful than King Robert Baratheon for instance)?. </p><p>Even when the NW existed he was pestered by Stannis and others to claim his birthright to Winterfell (which he has through Lianna btw, although obvs Sansa, Arya and Bran and in the books Rickon are above him) and you expect me to believe Westerosi Lords will let him live quietly over there? Than no one will be offering their daughters in the hope of a Targ heir that they could use for power?. </p><h1>But is Jon the best candidate?</h1><h2>Let&rsquo;s look at the pros:</h2><ol><li>He is a capable leader (brooding does not disqualify him).</li><li>Tried his hand in administrative matters at the Wall.</li><li>In spite of having drank Dorito&rsquo;s kool aid (according to a scene that was completely occ), he still has a moral compass. A strong one like his mother and his foster dad.</li><li>His coin landed on the right side and he has no nukes. </li><li>He&rsquo;s forgiving, not blood thirsty and has a talent for making allies of former enemies.</li><li>He naturally attracts people and they love him. Yes, charismatic leaders are not necessarily the best but it certainly helps.This is show canon episode 4. </li><li>He fights for his family and the North but he also actively tried to stop the bloodbath in KL, as much as one could stop a dragon firing naplam from the sky. That means he cares for southerners as well.</li><li>After all is said and done now we all &ldquo;know what happens when people find out the truth&rdquo; about him. People will be willing to lose their heads to put him in power and the scheming won&rsquo;t stop simply because the Wall is far. </li></ol><h2>Let&rsquo;s look at the cons:</h2><ol><li>Queenslayer? That&rsquo;ll make him King actually by right of conquest. Case in point Henry Tudor literally grabbing Richard&rsquo;s crown from his dead body.</li><li>He doesn&rsquo;t want it. No matter what he wants. Now we all &ldquo;know what happens when people hear the truth about you&rdquo;. Show canon.</li></ol><p>Side note: when at Craster&rsquo;s he tells Commander Mormont he does have ambition for ruling. Show canon. Season 3? I&rsquo;m not sure.</p><h2>In conclusion.</h2><p>He may be enjoying his pleasure trip up North for the moment but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll have to wait ten years or even one before the political situation deteriorates, someone tries to kill him or kidnap him to force others to act. Or to Bran or Sansa.</p><p>To paraphrase Jon&rsquo;s second greatest supporter:</p><p class=\"npf_quirky\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;quirky&quot;}\">Nothing lasts. Not even eternal exile.</p></p>",

        "body": "<p>So, Game of Thrones is over, and Bran is king. Whether that\u2019s good news or not depends on how one views Bran as a character.</p><p>What I do notice, however, is that whether people approve or disapprove of Bran as king, their reasons for or against\u00a0focus entirely on Bran as a person and not on the circumstances surrounding his ascent to the throne. From this individualistic perspective, King Bran may seem to come out of nowhere. But taking a bird\u2019s eye view (pun intended) and looking at the situation as it stands for most people, King Bran makes a lot of sense.</p><p>Look at what we\u2019re dealing with: The populace of Westeros has been ravaged by a series of bloody, devastating wars. Entire great houses have been eradicated, and others are hanging on by a thread. We\u2019re not even talking civilian casualties, casualties that disrupt trade, commerce, agriculture and infrastructure.</p><p>Then there\u2019s the psychological toll. People are fucking <i>exhausted</i>. People have been killing and dying for the Iron Throne virtually non-stop since the death of Robert Baratheon. But they can\u2019t rebuild the kingdom with this gaping power vacuum staring them in the face. Someone has to be in charge, but who?</p><p>Whoever the people can live with. In other words, the person least likely to drag the people into another war over who gets to sit in an ugly chair. The person who most fits that bill is Bran. Due to his disability and his detachment from the usual things that motivate people, he\u2019s the\u00a0least offensive choice. He is (or seems) harmless.</p><p>After weeks in a prison cell with nothing to do but think, Tyrion knows this. He also knows that compared to the inspiring, passionate, beautiful Dany and strong, honorable, handsome Jon, a quiet, reserved boy in a wheelchair would not be eagerly embraced as king material.</p><p>And this is where Tyrion\u2019s stroke of genius comes in. Stories do unite people. But Bran having the best story? With Sansa and Arya right there, Jon in a prison cell and Dany barely cold in the grave? With his own colorful life? Please. That\u2019s pure bullshit. It\u2019s spin. It\u2019s the PR campaign to sell the nobility on the idea of Bran being king.</p><p>It\u2019s quite brilliant, really.</p><p>(This is a huge moment of character development for Tyrion, where he grows beyond clever and becomes wise.)</p>",
