Your heart fluttered and your stomach jumped, unable to hide the smile on your face.\u00a0</p><hr><p>You had to stop walking, bending over as you continued laughing from Steve\u2019s stories about his best friend, Bucky. Someone who you\u2019d met before in the halls, but not enough to call him a friend.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet him.\u201d You said as you calmed down, resuming the walk down the hall.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019ll love you.\u201d Steve\u2019s smile was beaming as he looked down at you.\u00a0<br></p><p>You finally arrived at your door,\u00a0\u201cwell, this is me.\u201d You chuckled as Steve stuffed his hands in his pocket.\u00a0\u201cI had a really great time,\u201d he said, looking at you.

You wrapped your arms around his neck, pressing your lips to his as you felt him wrap his arms around your waist, pressing his lips harder against yours.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;God, I was hopin&rsquo; you&rsquo;d do that,&rdquo; he groaned against your lips, before lifting you as you wrapped your legs around his waist.&nbsp;<br /></p><hr /><p><b>TAGLIST (OPEN): </b></p><p>@<a href=\"https://nerdgirljen.tumblr.com/\">nerdgirljen</a>, @<a href=\"https://harryngtonewithyourshit.tumblr.com/\">harryngtonewithyourshit</a>, @<a href=\"https://just-in-case-iloveyou.tumblr.com/\">just-in-case-iloveyou</a>, @<a href=\"https://stevehesaidabadlanguageword.tumblr.com/\">stevehesaidabadlanguageword</a>, @<a href=\"https://cant-decide-at-this-moment.tumblr.com/\">cant-decide-at-this-moment</a>, @<a href=\"https://srgntjbbarness.tumblr.com/\">srgntjbbarness</a>, @<a href=\"https://laucontrerasv.tumblr.com/post/184864033136\">aucontrerasv</a>, @<a href=\"https://california-grown.tumblr.com/\">california-grown</a>, @<a href=\"https://potteryourotter.tumblr.com/\">potteryourotter</a>, @<a href=\"https://treacheroussparks.tumblr.com/\">treacheroussparks</a>, @<a href=\"https://mittenskittie.tumblr.com/\">mittenskittie</a>, @<a href=\"http://glitteryoungho.tumblr.com/\">glitteryoungho</a>, @<a href=\"http://5secondsofhollands.tumblr.com/\">5secondsofhollands</a>, @<a href=\"http://battlebunnyteardropsinthesun.tumblr.com/\">battlebunnyteardropsinthesun</a>, @<a href=\"http://imdiegohargreeves.tumblr.com/\">imdiegohargreeves</a>, @<a href=\"http://mybabe-buckybarnes.tumblr.com/\">mybabe-buckybarnes</a>, @<a href=\"https://vitamingrant.tumblr.com/\" title=\"vitamingrant\">vitamingrant</a>, @<a href=\"https://captainamericasbeard.tumblr.com/\" title=\"captainamericasbeard\">captainamericasbeard</a>, @<a href=\"https://treacheroussparks.tumblr.com/\" title=\"treacheroussparks\">treacheroussparks</a>, @<a href=\"https://laucontrerasv.tumblr.com/post/184864033136\" title=\"laucontrerasv\">laucontrerasv</a>, @<a href=\"https://princess-yuna.tumblr.com/\">princess-yuna</a>, @<a href=\"https://littleprincesstrxsh.tumblr.com/\">littleprincesstrxsh</a>, @<a href=\"https://ohhhhhhsweetfandomofmine.tumblr.com/\">ohhhhhhsweetfandomofmine</a>, @<a href=\"https://watchtoomuchtv.tumblr.com/\">watchtoomuchtv</a>, @<a href=\"https://thorandlokigetsunshine.tumblr.com/\">thorandlokigetsunshine</a>, @<a href=\"http://wxshes-kxsses.tumblr.com/\">wxshes-kxsses</a>, @<a href=\"http://beardburnsupersoldiers.tumblr.com/\">beardburnsupersoldiers</a>, @<a href=\"http://marveliz.tumblr.com/\">marveliz</a>,&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Send me a message if you would like to be added/removed!</i></b><br /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2Fballyhoobarnes&amp;t=YTgyNzM3OTQyOGEzZTIxYTEyMmE5MzI2ZTM4MThhZmI5ZDI5NjA0ZCwyajZPUmJrbw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A-2rK5zBwRmCkh5ya8peLlQ&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fballyhoobarnes.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174313492264%2Fnsfw-alphabet-steve-rogers\"><b><i>If you enjoy my work, consider buying me a coffee (:</i></b></a></p>",

Their shenanigans getting in the way of filming, not that anyone was particularly mad at that.</p><p>\tFeeling a presence behind you, you turned to see Chris Evans.</p><!-- more --><p>\t\u201cChris!\u201d You squealed, your smile bursting forth full force as you jumped to hug the Captain America Actor.</p><p>\tYou caught your breath and once you let go of Chris you looked up, admiring his mustache that he grew out for his new role in Lobby Hero.</p><p>\tSlapping his chest lightly, you scolded, \u201cYou didn\u2019t respond to my text last night about drinks.\u201d You took a moment to think, then continued, \u201cActually, why are you here? You already filmed your last scene.\u201d</p><p>\tYou watched in wonder as a pink blush flushed his cheeks.</p><p>\tButterflies fluttered in your stomach and your mouth went dry as you drank up the sight of the older man.</p><p>\tYou had a major crush on him. Despite the age difference. So you never acted on your urge to ask him out, always keeping it casual, friendly. There was no way in your mind that this older, handsome, decorated actor would want to date a young actress like yourself.</p><p>\t\u201cUmm&hellip;well&hellip;I saw the news last night and..\u201d</p><p>\tYou laughed, the sound awkward, as you waved a hand, \u201cYeah I know. Those reporters are getting dumber by the day I swear. Just because Tom and I were spotted walking side by side in the afternoon, suddenly we\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>\tChris\u2019s baby blue eyes widened for a second before becoming steely with determination. Drawing a breath, \u201cSo you two aren\u2019t? You know? A thing?\u201d</p><p>\tYou squinted at Chris. His voice was timid. Which was unlike his normal, joking, boisterous self.</p><p>\t\u201cNo.\u201d Your tone broke no room for argument. It had been disgusting when you saw the report the night before about you and Tom secretly dating. He was a good friend and those reporters were twisting it to fit their narrative. </p><p>\tChris let out a sigh, of relief. Which confused you.</p><p>\tThen he smiled. And it was so bright, you swore you would become blind.</p><p>\t\u201cGood. That\u2019s..that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\tYou laid a hand on his arm, watching as his eyes flitted to your hand before back to your gaze, \u201cChris. You\u2019re worrying me. Why did you come to set today? I know it wasn\u2019t just about the report last night. We deal with nosey reporters all the time. I am a big girl, you know.\u201d You teased with a smirk and a wink.</p><p>\tYou could only watch with fascination as Chris swallowed hard, his adam&rsquo;s apple bobbing.</p><p>\t\u201cAhhh. Yes, Well&hellip;I wanted to see if you&hellip;Well&hellip;if you wanted to come see the opening night of Lobby Hero.\u201d</p><p>You smiled softly at him. Was that what he was worried about? That you wouldn\u2019t be happy about his success outside of the MCU universe? </p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m sure the rest of the cast would love to come to. Let me ask-\u201d</p><p>You were cut off and your hand grabbed by his as you turned to ask the others. Turning back with a questioning look, you saw Chris\u2019s jaw tick as he fought to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cNo..like as a date. I\u2019m asking if you want to &hellip;go out&hellip;with me?\u201d He winced, as if expecting a slap or something.</p><p>\tMeanwhile, you had stopped working. The Exe. Error symbol running through your head. No thoughts coming to you.</p><p>\tYour mouth open in shock. Eyes staring at Chris.</p><p>\tAnd then it was like reality slammed back into you.</p><p>\tYour lips widened in a wide smile as you giggled, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\tHe smiled softly down at you, \u201cReally Really.\u201d</p><p>\tThat had you cracking up, \u201cDid you just quote Shrek!?\u201d</p><p>\tYour raised voice finally caught the attention of the others on set as Tom bounced over with a shit eating grin, \u201cDid someone say Shrek?\u201d</p><p>\tChris sighed lowly. But you merely winked at him, before moving closer and lowering your voice, \u201cI would love to go out with you.

There was no way in your mind that this older, handsome, decorated actor would want to date a young actress like yourself.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Umm&hellip;well&hellip;I saw the news last night and..&rdquo;</p><p>\tYou laughed, the sound awkward, as you waved a hand, &ldquo;Yeah I know. Those reporters are getting dumber by the day I swear. Just because Tom and I were spotted walking side by side in the afternoon, suddenly we&rsquo;re dating.&rdquo;</p><p>\tChris&rsquo;s baby blue eyes widened for a second before becoming steely with determination. Drawing a breath, &ldquo;So you two aren&rsquo;t? You know? A thing?&rdquo;</p><p>\tYou squinted at Chris. His voice was timid. Which was unlike his normal, joking, boisterous self.</p><p>\t&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Your tone broke no room for argument. It had been disgusting when you saw the report the night before about you and Tom secretly dating. He was a good friend and those reporters were twisting it to fit their narrative. </p><p>\tChris let out a sigh, of relief. Which confused you.</p><p>\tThen he smiled. And it was so bright, you swore you would become blind.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Good. That&rsquo;s..that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p><p>\tYou laid a hand on his arm, watching as his eyes flitted to your hand before back to your gaze, &ldquo;Chris. You&rsquo;re worrying me. Why did you come to set today? I know it wasn&rsquo;t just about the report last night. We deal with nosey reporters all the time. I am a big girl, you know.&rdquo; You teased with a smirk and a wink.</p><p>\tYou could only watch with fascination as Chris swallowed hard, his adam&rsquo;s apple bobbing.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Ahhh. Yes, Well&hellip;I wanted to see if you&hellip;Well&hellip;if you wanted to come see the opening night of Lobby Hero.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled softly at him. Was that what he was worried about? That you wouldn&rsquo;t be happy about his success outside of the MCU universe? </p><p>&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;m sure the rest of the cast would love to come to. Let me ask-&rdquo;</p><p>You were cut off and your hand grabbed by his as you turned to ask the others. Turning back with a questioning look, you saw Chris&rsquo;s jaw tick as he fought to get the words out.</p><p>&ldquo;No..like as a date. I&rsquo;m asking if you want to &hellip;go out&hellip;with me?&rdquo; He winced, as if expecting a slap or something.</p><p>\tMeanwhile, you had stopped working. The Exe. Error symbol running through your head. No thoughts coming to you.</p><p>\tYour mouth open in shock. Eyes staring at Chris.</p><p>\tAnd then it was like reality slammed back into you.</p><p>\tYour lips widened in a wide smile as you giggled, &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>\tHe smiled softly down at you, &ldquo;Really Really.&rdquo;</p><p>\tThat had you cracking up, &ldquo;Did you just quote Shrek!?&rdquo;</p><p>\tYour raised voice finally caught the attention of the others on set as Tom bounced over with a shit eating grin, &ldquo;Did someone say Shrek?&rdquo;</p><p>\tChris sighed lowly. But you merely winked at him, before moving closer and lowering your voice, &ldquo;I would love to go out with you. Pick me up at Eight.&rdquo;</p><p>\tThe grin that took over Chris&rsquo;s face could rival the sun with its brightness. And you could no longer deny the thumping of your heart as you took in his face.</p><p>\tThis man. This amazing, incredible man, wanted to go out with you. Didn&rsquo;t care about the age gap like you thought he would.</p><p>\tAnd as he began joking with Tom, and saying hello to Anthony, you couldn&rsquo;t help but hope that maybe this relationship could last.</p><p><br /></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>FOREVER Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mueqGDjNU-px9eazPTAiIaw\">@sxph-t</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JrH0mInv0_jJIQb7ThoRQ\">@mialeelavellan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mezyjFsJ8KB5sI8HvSbv3Pg\">@rainydaysrnevergrey</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maKNWOBDx1gFx-pwWIPIqLA\">@sociallyawkwardcircus-freak-hi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXMa1-Lg1MwHvfZ4eHrQ8Pg\">@ayyidkeither</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYmLRg0re4tEdiXOVlxPUfA\">@queenbbarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMa22YNJDzooYAhgSdAUaHA\">@mythixmagic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCCNAjP9ndzMFGDkgSK-_sw\">@chas-z</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbgCK4NETm23uYtIEABN6-A\">@thefridgeismybestie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPOqWgH7GCQm2YsvdXy7OQ\">@strangersstranger</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Avengers Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSr3kQd1at8n76VB0yKCV3A\">@jadepc</a><strike> @marvel-is-a-mood</strike></p></p>",

From there, it\u2019s a mess of dripping stickiness, a mountain of tissues and a litany of\u00a0\u201cbe careful\u201ds. The bench dips as you take a seat next to father and daughter. Three mouths become framed and crusted with chocolate rings outlining happy smiles.</p><p>Once everyone is finished, your daughter takes off again, to yet another new adventure. She murmurs something about saving a family of pigeons, to which you respond with furrowed brows directed at your husband.</p><p>All he does is lift his shoulders, cracking another smile before turning his head to watch her run off.</p><p>\u201cWe got a good one; let\u2019s hope the next is just as easy,\u201d he says, resting a hand on your growing bump.<br/></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d<br/></p>",

They were walking through the beautiful scenes of Boston during its final changes if fall to winter. It was a chilly night, where the sudden breeze would pinch at the couples cheeks and noses. Leaving bright red trail marks in its wake. </p><p>Y/N smiled up at Chris, feeling like there was something wrong with him. He had been distant from the moment he had been picked her up from her place. \u201cChris?\u201d She called out. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded his head at Y/N, \u201cit\u2019s a chilly tonight, huh?\u201d He was trying to change the subject, something that he did often to avoid something Y/N asked or said. </p><p>\u201cChris, what\u2019s going on? Is something wrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing, sweetheart, I promise. <b>Let\u2019s go,\u201d</b> Chris reached his opposite hand over and gave Y/N a reassuring squeeze. </p><p>Y/N sighed, there was something on his mind but she knew better than to push the topic. So, she brushed it off turning her attention to the beautiful scenery that stood before them. It was silent for a long moment until Chris cleared his throat and asked, \u201cwould you like me to take a picture of you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d shrugged, fixing herself before looking onto the scenery. Allowing Chris to take a not so candid picture of the moment. It was a while since she heard anything coming from Chris. Not a click of a camera nor comment from him so she partially turned, confused as to what was going on. </p><p>\u201cDid you get it?\u201d </p><p>When she got no response, she turned and in then her heart dropped. There was Chris kneeling down on one knee, with a velvet jewellery box in his hand. Y/N\u2019s gloved hand rose to her mouth, her eyes tearing up; to which she was sure because Chris was doing and not because of the stinging chill. \u201cOh my god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, I have thought of this moment ever since I met you because I knew that you were the one for me. You were the one that I had been waiting for, so will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>By then, Y/N had tears rolling down her cheeks as she nodded her head. \u201cyes!\u201d Chris pulled the ring from its place and slid it carefully onto Y/N\u2019s finger. He stood up and pulled her into a kiss and a hug. Once they separated, Chris looked down and asked, </p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d </p><p>Y/N\u2019s jaw dropped at Chris\u2019 question, of course, she liked it. Truthfully, she didn\u2019t even need a ring. She was simply was just happy at the idea to spend the rest of her life with Chris. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>She leaned up at to peck Chris\u2019 lips until she felt a wet spatter fall on her nose. She pulled back with confusion until she felt a sudden more, causing her to chuckle. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Chris looked up to finally realize what was falling from the sky, making him grin to grow even wider. <b>\u201cIt\u2019s snowing.</b>\u201d It was Y/N\u2019s first time to experience snow so, for it to be the day she got engaged was altogether magical and special. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyes grew wide as she turned to Chris and practically squealed with excitement. \u201cNow we can have a snow fight!\u201d</p><p>Chris let out a bolting laugh, his hand shooting out to grab at his chest. <b>\u201cOh, it is on.\u201d</b></p>",

I do know how you take yours.&rdquo;</p><p>He leaned over with his hands on the table. &ldquo;You get my coffee almost every morning. Let me get yours this time.&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Two creams, four sugars.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Four? You like it sweet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do. Decaf, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve ordered their coffees then returned to their table to wait.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; decaf.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for caffeine. I&rsquo;d be up late, have to get up early for work. Not fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I forget. Caffeine doesn&rsquo;t affect me now. Alcohol, either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we know who the designated driver is.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiled. &ldquo;Does that imply future dates?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to see.&rdquo;</p><p>The barista sat their coffees in front of them, and Melanie watched her gaze linger over Steve until she walked away. A quick glance around the room found others doing the same. If Steve noticed he didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to it.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what do you do for fun, other than draw?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve took a sip of the coffee. The steam coming from it was proof that it was way too hot, and would have burned the mouth of anyone else.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have much free time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m either training or learning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you learning?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The world. I lost a lot of years.&rdquo;</p><p>Melanie shook her head. &ldquo;Right. Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t even think about that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. I like that you didn&rsquo;t think about that.&rdquo;</p><p>Melanie smiled. &ldquo;Ok, if you had the free time, what would you want to do for fun?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve sat back in his chair and took a deep breath. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. What do you do for fun?&rdquo;</p><p>Melanie chuckled. &ldquo;Most of my fun is solo activities. I read a lot. Movies, tv. Nothing as far as talent goes, like your drawing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds like you and I are passing time the same way. Maybe we could do it together, sometime?&rdquo;</p><p>Melanie&rsquo;s eyes widened and Steve blushed.</p><p>&ldquo;Pass time, I mean.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, and nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, that could be fun. I&rsquo;ll bet there&rsquo;s movies I love that you haven&rsquo;t seen yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a safe bet. I think\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; a blonde walked over and sat on the edge of your table, leaning in front of you to face Steve. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Captain America aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve sighed. &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think what you do is so amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, but we&rsquo;ve got men and women who do more than I do everyday\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, but are they as sexy as you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ma'am, I&rsquo;m having coffee with someone, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>She flipped her hair. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind. So, are you\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>Melanie stood and walked around the blonde intruder as she continued talking. She took Steve&rsquo;s hand, tugged him to his feet, and led him from the coffee shop.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I was talking to him!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, you were.&rdquo;</p><p>Outside, Steve took a deep breath. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bet you&rsquo;re not used to forward women.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really. I mean, we had some forward women in my day, but they tried to hide it. Way more subtle. Not so rude.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to the new millennium.&rdquo;</p><p>Melanie glanced at her watched and Steve shoved his hands into his pockets.</p><p>&ldquo;Somewhere to be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early. How would you like to come back to my apartment and watch one of those movies?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve&rsquo;s eyebrow twitched.</p><p>&ldquo;Purest of intentions,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo; She crossed her heart. &ldquo;I just figured you could have some privacy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds great, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>At her apartment, Melanie scanned over her DVD&rsquo;s looking for something she thought Steve might enjoy.

She smiled back.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. And after the way that woman hit on you at the coffee house, I didn&rsquo;t want you to think I was pulling the same thing.&rdquo;</p><p>She stared at their joined hands. His thumb swept back and forth over her skin. When she looked up, Steve put his free hand to her face and pressed his lips to hers. An almost chaste kiss, except for the hum he released.

She took Steve\u2019s hand, tugged him to his feet, and led him from the coffee shop.</p><p>\u201cHey, I was talking to him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you were.\u201d</p><p>Outside, Steve took a deep breath. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet you\u2019re not used to forward women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I mean, we had some forward women in my day, but they tried to hide it. Way more subtle. Not so rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the new millennium.\u201d</p><p>Melanie glanced at her watched and Steve shoved his hands into his pockets.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early. How would you like to come back to my apartment and watch one of those movies?\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s eyebrow twitched.</p><p>\u201cPurest of intentions,\u201d she said, \u201cI promise.\u201d She crossed her heart. \u201cI just figured you could have some privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great, actually.\u201d</p><p>At her apartment, Melanie scanned over her DVD\u2019s looking for something she thought Steve might enjoy. It wasn\u2019t until her eyes landed on a box set of a tv show that she smiled.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever watched I Love Lucy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Heard of it, though.\u201d</p><p>Melanie pulled out the first disc and popped it into the player.</p><p>\u201cIt was a tv show in the 50\u2019s. A little closer to the type of entertainment you would have been used to.\u201d</p><p>She sat next to him on the sofa, leaving just enough space so that they weren\u2019t touching, and grabbed the remote.</p><p>\u201cI thought the point of this was to get me caught up on modern stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the point was to enjoy ourselves?\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled.</p><p>\u201cThis is a date, right?\u201d Melanie asked.</p><p>\u201cRight. A date.\u201d</p><p>The smile slowly faded from Steve\u2019s lips as his eyes flicked over Melanie\u2019s face. Melanie cleared her throat and started the first episode.</p><p>\u201cSo, what we have here is a situation comedy. Every week, Lucy finds herself in a new situation, and misunderstandings and slapstick comedy ensue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds kind of predictable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn general, yes, but the brilliance is in the ridiculousness.\u201d</p><p>After laughing his way through the first episode, Steve asked to continue. Two more in and Steve\u2019s arm ended up behind Melanie on the back of the couch. His presence was overpowering.</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>Steve settled into the couch a little more, his leg drifting until it rested against Melanie\u2019s. She sighed, louder than she meant to.</p><p>\u201cYou ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Why?\u201d</p><p>Steve grabbed the remote and paused the show.</p><p>\u201cYou seem a little\u2026 uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>He sat up a little straighter. \u201cHave I worn out my welcome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, something\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She played with her fingers in her lap until Steve took one of her hands in his.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk. Honesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice.\u201d</p><p>He visibly tensed, as if waiting for some horrible confession.</p><p>\u201cYou coming into the coffee shop was a huge surprise. I knew who you were the moment I saw you, but you had that hat and you were kind of hunched, like you were trying to hide. So, I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what made me come back.\u201d</p><p>Melanie nodded. \u201cI kind of figured. But, I\u2019m human. I was attracted to you before you walked in. News and photos\u2026 that suit does amazing things for you.\u201d</p><p>Steve blushed, but Melanie kept going.</p><p>\u201cHaving you here, next to me, I\u2019m just finding it a little difficult to not focus on how attractive you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s quite a confession.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled as he said her words back to her. She smiled back.</p><p>\u201cYeah. And after the way that woman hit on you at the coffee house, I didn\u2019t want you to think I was pulling the same thing.\u201d</p><p>She stared at their joined hands. His thumb swept back and forth over her skin. When she looked up, Steve put his free hand to her face and pressed his lips to hers. An almost chaste kiss, except for the hum he released. He sighed as he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cYou free tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo nights in a row? I thought you didn\u2019t have that much free time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make time. Tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. More Lucy?\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled. \u201cSure. Maybe I can bring dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, that is a great idea.\u201d</p><p>Steve chuckled. He stood and walked to the door, never letting go of her hand. His free hand tucked a stray piece of hair behind her ear, then he pressed his lips to hers, very briefly.</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Steve.\u201d</p><hr><p>I wasn\u2019t going to tag anyone.

                "content": "<p>Steve has a thing for the local barista, but can Captain America really have a relationship?<br /></p><p>Chapter 2<br /></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Steve held Melanie&rsquo;s chair as she sat.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I should go order. I do know how you take yours.&rdquo;</p><p>He leaned over with his hands on the table. &ldquo;You get my coffee almost every morning. Let me get yours this time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two creams, four sugars.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Four? You like it sweet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do. Decaf, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve ordered their coffees then returned to their table to wait.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; decaf.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for caffeine. I&rsquo;d be up late, have to get up early for work. Not fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I forget. Caffeine doesn&rsquo;t affect me now. Alcohol, either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we know who the designated driver is.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiled. &ldquo;Does that imply future dates?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to see.&rdquo;</p><p>The barista sat their coffees in front of them, and Melanie watched her gaze linger over Steve until she walked away. A quick glance around the room found others doing the same. If Steve noticed he didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to it.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what do you do for fun, other than draw?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve took a sip of the coffee. The steam coming from it was proof that it was way too hot, and would have burned the mouth of anyone else.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have much free time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m either training or learning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you learning?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The world. I lost a lot of years.&rdquo;</p><p>Melanie shook her head. &ldquo;Right. Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t even think about that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. I like that you didn&rsquo;t think about that.&rdquo;</p><p>Melanie smiled. &ldquo;Ok, if you had the free time, what would you want to do for fun?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve sat back in his chair and took a deep breath. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. What do you do for fun?&rdquo;</p><p>Melanie chuckled. &ldquo;Most of my fun is solo activities. I read a lot. Movies, tv. Nothing as far as talent goes, like your drawing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds like you and I are passing time the same way. Maybe we could do it together, sometime?&rdquo;</p><p>Melanie&rsquo;s eyes widened and Steve blushed.</p><p>&ldquo;Pass time, I mean.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, and nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, that could be fun. I&rsquo;ll bet there&rsquo;s movies I love that you haven&rsquo;t seen yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a safe bet. I think&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; a blonde walked over and sat on the edge of your table, leaning in front of you to face Steve. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Captain America aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve sighed. &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think what you do is so amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, but we&rsquo;ve got men and women who do more than I do everyday&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, but are they as sexy as you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ma'am, I&rsquo;m having coffee with someone, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>She flipped her hair. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.
