I could definitely be missing things, but I just don\u2019t know.\u00a0</p><p>As I keep working on various fix-its, I am forced to confront things that Endgame left up in the air, at least to my understanding. Most of these things I would be able to let go if I weren\u2019t trying to write fics around them in a way that makes a modicum of sense.</p><p>1. Can Thor summon the Bifrost with Stormbreaker? I thought Infinity War and Ragnarok implied that Thor could do it and Stormbreaker could help, but did Thor lose that power when he declared Valkyrie the Queen of New Asgard? Or does he still have it as the rightful son of Odin who has now unlocked his full power? Does he require Stormbreaker or can he summon it himself?\u00a0</p><p>2. When Cap came back to the main timeline to give Sam the shield, was he intending to stay or was he only dropping by? Was alternate universe Peggy already dead? Was the alternate universe that Steve went back in time to the same one where 2014 Thanos was already gone, or were multiple alternate universes created? Did Steve return to 1945 after dropping off the Tesseract in 1970, or did he just stay in 1970? I couldn\u2019t tell based on the cars in the final scene. Was old Steve himself close to death? He seemed pretty healthy in that scene, just old. Did he talk to anyone else or was he trying to keep his presence quiet? Wouldn\u2019t his very presence back in the main timeline create a new alternate universe going forward?\u00a0</p><p>3. Where did Steve live and what he did he do when he wasn\u2019t leading group therapy sessions during the five year time jump? Nat makes a joke, asking him if he\u2019s at the compound to do his washing. This implies to me me that he did not live there full-time. So does this mean he was not involved in any of the Avenging activities that Nat, Rhodey, etc. were doing? Or only some of the time?</p><p>4. One thing that didn\u2019t register with me until now is: how did Scott Lang\u2019s things get into storage? Was it a government program for all the missing people? There seemed to be a number of other compartments, and it is funny that Lang\u2019s identification number on his sign was 616. Or did Maggie and Jim survive the Snap, Scott\u2019s stuff was given to them, and they put it in storage? It seems like other vehicles and things were just abandoned? Why wasn\u2019t Scott\u2019s stuff just abandoned? Is there a good in-universe explanation or is it just the needs of the plot?</p><p>I don\u2019t know that there are clear answers to any of these questions, so I am treating the answers to all of them as:\u00a0\u201cWhatever I want.\u201d But it would be nice to have just a little more canonical detail.</p>",

I thought Infinity War and Ragnarok implied that Thor could do it and Stormbreaker could help, but did Thor lose that power when he declared Valkyrie the Queen of New Asgard? Or does he still have it as the rightful son of Odin who has now unlocked his full power? Does he require Stormbreaker or can he summon it himself?\u00a0</p><p>2. When Cap came back to the main timeline to give Sam the shield, was he intending to stay or was he only dropping by? Was alternate universe Peggy already dead? Was the alternate universe that Steve went back in time to the same one where 2014 Thanos was already gone, or were multiple alternate universes created? Did Steve return to 1945 after dropping off the Tesseract in 1970, or did he just stay in 1970? I couldn\u2019t tell based on the cars in the final scene. Was old Steve himself close to death? He seemed pretty healthy in that scene, just old. Did he talk to anyone else or was he trying to keep his presence quiet? Wouldn\u2019t his very presence back in the main timeline create a new alternate universe going forward?\u00a0</p><p>3. Where did Steve live and what he did he do when he wasn\u2019t leading group therapy sessions during the five year time jump? Nat makes a joke, asking him if he\u2019s at the compound to do his washing. This implies to me me that he did not live there full-time. So does this mean he was not involved in any of the Avenging activities that Nat, Rhodey, etc. were doing? Or only some of the time?</p><p>4. One thing that didn\u2019t register with me until now is: how did Scott Lang\u2019s things get into storage? Was it a government program for all the missing people? There seemed to be a number of other compartments, and it is funny that Lang\u2019s identification number on his sign was 616. Or did Maggie and Jim survive the Snap, Scott\u2019s stuff was given to them, and they put it in storage? It seems like other vehicles and things were just abandoned? Why wasn\u2019t Scott\u2019s stuff just abandoned? Is there a good in-universe explanation or is it just the needs of the plot?</p><p>I don\u2019t know that there are clear answers to any of these questions, so I am treating the answers to all of them as:\u00a0\u201cWhatever I want.\u201d But it would be nice to have just a little more canonical detail.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>\ud83d\ude02 That is hilarious. So yeah, the quick MCU backstory on Thor\u2019s hammer, Mjolnir, is that most people cannot pick it up. You have to be deemed worthy.

Tony can\u2019t even do it with his Iron Man hand. So then Steve goes, and it budges ever-so-slightly, which Thor notices and his arrogant smile immediately drops. I was never really sure whether Steve noticed because he doesn\u2019t let on; instead, he immediately gives up. (Side note: Later in the movie, we see Vision pick it up with ease, which I think was completely unnecessary and dampens this sweet victory just a little bit.) But yeah, that\u2019s why everyone lost their shit and Thor was like, \u201cI knew it!\u201d We\u2019ve all been waiting for the followup to that moment since 2015, lol. (Cap can also wield the hammer in the comics, so I\u2019m sure fans of that were also super happy about seeing it on screen.)

You have to be deemed worthy. (Even Thor couldn\u2019t wield it for a while.) So there\u2019s this whole scene in Avengers: Age of Ultron where all the Avengers are hanging out at a party and each of them try to pick it up. Tony can\u2019t even do it with his Iron Man hand. So then Steve goes, and it budges ever-so-slightly, which Thor notices and his arrogant smile immediately drops. I was never really sure whether Steve noticed because he doesn\u2019t let on; instead, he immediately gives up. (Side note: Later in the movie, we see Vision pick it up with ease, which I think was completely unnecessary and dampens this sweet victory just a little bit.) But yeah, that\u2019s why everyone lost their shit and Thor was like, \u201cI knew it!\u201d We\u2019ve all been waiting for the followup to that moment since 2015, lol. (Cap can also wield the hammer in the comics, so I\u2019m sure fans of that were also super happy about seeing it on screen.)

        "answer": "<h2>Please note this answer has spoilers for<i> Avengers: Endgame.</i></h2><p><b><i>1) Spider-Man: Homecoming </i></b>is my favorite solo MCU movie. It\u2019s #3 all-time behind Endgame &amp; Infinity War. I credit Kevin Feige with bringing the Peter Parker I love from the comics to life. Okay, so he\u2019s not 1:1 with 616 Peter or Ultimate Peter, but his personality is beautifully adapted. You\u2019ve got the villain with a personal stake in his life; the awkwardness around his crush; the super brains; the trying to have a secret identity while blatantly jumping into action when he sees someone in need; the adoration with other superheroes (early Spidey, this was the Fantastic Four); and even though it\u2019s been recontextualized as a mentor/mentee relationship, his working relationship with Iron Man. I also love what\u2019s been changed because it works so well with the MCU, like his suit having AI Karen; MJ having model-worthy looks but not flaunting them and really being a muted, sarcastic foil to Peter; Flash being less of a 1960s-type jock bully and more of a smartass; and Ned being his close friend as a version of Ganke rather than jumping right into Harry Osborn. It\u2019s also incredibly important in retrospect that this movie is integral to Tony Stark\u2019s arc in Phase 3. This movie gives Infinity War and Endgame its emotional gravitas. Tony may have had a kid of his own by 2023, but Peter Parker is the catalyst for everything.</p><p><b><i>2) Black Panther</i></b> is incredibly important to cinema as a whole in 2018 and beyond, not just to the MCU. Top-notch acting by Boseman, Nyong\u2019o, and Jordan with a script that ties back into <i>Age of Ultron </i>and <i>Civil War</i>\u00a0while still being standalone. Killmonger is one of the MCU\u2019s best villains and this film has incredibly personal stakes, a killer art and sound direction, and Marvel\u2019s first Oscar wins. It\u2019s an enjoyable watch that proves to the naysayers superhero franchises can also have cinematic objective quality (which we\u2019ve all been saying all along).</p><p><b><i>3) Captain America: The First Avenger </i></b>is like a bowl of chicken noodle soup. It\u2019s not 5-star quality but it warms the soul and the heart like an old friend. MCU Captain America is my favorite hero in the franchise and this movie gave new life to a hero many passed off as outdated propaganda. I can watch <i>The First Avenger</i> all day. What makes that special? Nothing, I\u2019m just a kid from Florida who loves how cheesy but serious this one gets. (Also, Steggy.)</p><p>\n\n<i><a href=\"http://marvelousvasili.tumblr.com/ask\">Send me 3 Marvel movies (or anything, really) and I\u2019ll rank them best to worst!</a></i>\n\n<br/></p>",

It\u2019s #3 all-time behind Endgame &amp; Infinity War. I credit Kevin Feige with bringing the Peter Parker I love from the comics to life. Okay, so he\u2019s not 1:1 with 616 Peter or Ultimate Peter, but his personality is beautifully adapted. You\u2019ve got the villain with a personal stake in his life; the awkwardness around his crush; the super brains; the trying to have a secret identity while blatantly jumping into action when he sees someone in need; the adoration with other superheroes (early Spidey, this was the Fantastic Four); and even though it\u2019s been recontextualized as a mentor/mentee relationship, his working relationship with Iron Man. I also love what\u2019s been changed because it works so well with the MCU, like his suit having AI Karen; MJ having model-worthy looks but not flaunting them and really being a muted, sarcastic foil to Peter; Flash being less of a 1960s-type jock bully and more of a smartass; and Ned being his close friend as a version of Ganke rather than jumping right into Harry Osborn.
