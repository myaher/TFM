Language</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Space was a beautiful and big thing something I would enjoy if I wasn\u2019t worried trying to look for my dad and peter. But still sometimes I couldn\u2019t help but stare at the stars so many of them. All much clearer and more beautiful then in earth. It all reminded me when I was in hydra those nights I would look up the little window I had hoping and knowing that their was much more then that little space. Seeing the stars always gave me hope back there. Hope that I would leave that place and travel the world see the stars from different places In the world. And now I was in fucking space unbelievable! </p><p><i>Harry would love this. </i></p><p>Our spaceship was destroyed a couple days after being in space by some people that hated Carol. The good thing is I had the suit. We had also gathered some information on where tony and peter could\u2019ve been. When we arrived on the said planet there was nothing there but pure emptiness. Looked like it had been abanonded for years. The only clue we had was a what looked like a moon had crashed into the planet and another broke spaceship Nothing else and nothing more. </p><p>I was more fustarted then before. We\u2019ve been in space for five days and still nothing. We had no spaceship anymore and the clue we had to finding them was a dead clue now. I kicked a rock that was on the ground and it went flying across. My helmet retracts from my face revealing frustrated tears. </p><p>Frustrated because you couldn\u2019t find the only dad you had. The dad you just got to meet even if it felt like a long time it really wasn\u2019t. It has just been 2 to 3 years with him. You\u2019ve only recently got know him after years of not knowing if you had a family and if you did them not caring. I hated to think the fact that he was gone but maybe Steve was right maybe he was gone and I\u2019m out here in a space adventure rather then looking for the stones. </p><p>I again felt the loss of control I was frustrated but I tried to call myself tried to be my own anchor just like carol had said to do. I ran my fingers through my hair in a huff. I heard Carol approach but I said nothing instead looked down at the red dirt. She put her hand on my shoulder and squeezed it trying to comfort me. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to find him okay? There still might be a chance for him to be stuck not far by.\u201d She reassured me. Her words felt distant they felt like lies now. Just her trying to keep me calm and to keep me from killing myself with my own powers. I wanted to give up, give up hope but deep inside me I knew that if I was lost in space and never made it back then he would do everything could to find me again. I cling onto that last bit of hope I had inside me and pushed myself up. I put my helmet back on and turned to look at Carol. </p><p>\u201cLets go.\u201d I told her she smiled and we blasted off. </p><p>I don\u2019t know why but the hope I had was decreasing with every passing minute when not seeing any sign of anything but just darkness and the emptiness of space. we traveled for what felt like forever passing by the same background we had passed everyday. It all looked the same until we saw a shape of what looked to be a ship it was to dark to tell. We got closer with Carol lighting the way. The ship didn\u2019t seem to be on or anything just looked to be stranded. We moved to the front of the ship to see if would find anyone or anything inside. </p><p>Their was hope building up once more when I saw the ship. I couldn\u2019t hide it as hard as I tried I couldn\u2019t. When we got to the front of the ship Carol pushed me to be behind her just in case if any sudden attack would happen. I looked inside and their was a body inside and it seemed to be moving but in a non threatening way. I moved myself to be in front now so I could get a better view. My eyes went wide at the sight of him and I felt a smile grow behind my helmet. I felt joy as I saw him. All I wanted to do was rush in hug him but I couldn\u2019t not until we landed back on earth. When I saw him he was blocking his eyes from the brightness that came from Carol. I could still see his eyes as they peaked over his arm. I saw his eyes shift over to me a confused gaze not knowing who was under the helmet. The sight of him brought me joy but it also made me sad seeing as cheeks were hallow and his skin looked pale. In the background I saw another figure approach the front of the ship from inside. Carol looked over at me with a knowing smile on her face. </p><p>\u201cTime to go home.\u201d </p><p>\u2014 </p><p>When we landed back on earth I saw Steve, Natasha, Bruce, Rhodey, Rocket, Harry and Pepper on the ground waiting and seeing as we landed on the ground close to them. Steve rushed over to the ship and the door opened revealing Tony. He looked over at me still wondering who was behind the helmet. I quickly got out of the suit finally revealing myself. A wide and relieved smile on my face when I saw him standing there with Steve. When he saw me he looked relieved and a small smile appeared on his face. I rushed over to him and gave him a hug. He wrapped his arms around me and his hand run down my hair as he kissed the top of my head. </p><p>\u201cOh god you\u2019re here, you\u2019re alive.\u201d I heard him say quietly with a relieved sigh. I felt as happy tears now rolled down my cheeks. I tried to be gentle and not hug him that tight afraid to break his fragile state. \u201cI lost him&hellip;. I lost peter.\u201d He whispered his voice breaking. I closed my eyes at the sound of that and swallowed thickly. Seconds later feeling the embrace of Pepper as she came to hug tony. I was going to move to the side but she pulled me closer. Tony now had his arms wrapped around the both of us. This made me feel better made me feel complete. Having them both here with me. </p><p>Maybe theirs still hope to bring peter back. We just find the stones and we can maybe bring them all back. We have to have hope even if it is just a little. We need to bring him back all of them back. </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p>",

Just her trying to keep me calm and to keep me from killing myself with my own powers. I wanted to give up, give up hope but deep inside me I knew that if I was lost in space and never made it back then he would do everything could to find me again. I cling onto that last bit of hope I had inside me and pushed myself up. I put my helmet back on and turned to look at Carol. </p><p>&ldquo;Lets go.&rdquo; I told her she smiled and we blasted off. </p><p>I don&rsquo;t know why but the hope I had was decreasing with every passing minute when not seeing any sign of anything but just darkness and the emptiness of space. we traveled for what felt like forever passing by the same background we had passed everyday. It all looked the same until we saw a shape of what looked to be a ship it was to dark to tell. We got closer with Carol lighting the way. The ship didn&rsquo;t seem to be on or anything just looked to be stranded. We moved to the front of the ship to see if would find anyone or anything inside. </p><p>Their was hope building up once more when I saw the ship. I couldn&rsquo;t hide it as hard as I tried I couldn&rsquo;t. When we got to the front of the ship Carol pushed me to be behind her just in case if any sudden attack would happen. I looked inside and their was a body inside and it seemed to be moving but in a non threatening way. I moved myself to be in front now so I could get a better view. My eyes went wide at the sight of him and I felt a smile grow behind my helmet. I felt joy as I saw him. All I wanted to do was rush in hug him but I couldn&rsquo;t not until we landed back on earth. When I saw him he was blocking his eyes from the brightness that came from Carol. I could still see his eyes as they peaked over his arm. I saw his eyes shift over to me a confused gaze not knowing who was under the helmet. The sight of him brought me joy but it also made me sad seeing as cheeks were hallow and his skin looked pale. In the background I saw another figure approach the front of the ship from inside. Carol looked over at me with a knowing smile on her face. </p><p>&ldquo;Time to go home.&rdquo; </p><p>&mdash; </p><p>When we landed back on earth I saw Steve, Natasha, Bruce, Rhodey, Rocket, Harry and Pepper on the ground waiting and seeing as we landed on the ground close to them. Steve rushed over to the ship and the door opened revealing Tony. He looked over at me still wondering who was behind the helmet. I quickly got out of the suit finally revealing myself. A wide and relieved smile on my face when I saw him standing there with Steve. When he saw me he looked relieved and a small smile appeared on his face. I rushed over to him and gave him a hug. He wrapped his arms around me and his hand run down my hair as he kissed the top of my head. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh god you&rsquo;re here, you&rsquo;re alive.&rdquo; I heard him say quietly with a relieved sigh. I felt as happy tears now rolled down my cheeks. I tried to be gentle and not hug him that tight afraid to break his fragile state. &ldquo;I lost him&hellip;. I lost peter.&rdquo; He whispered his voice breaking. I closed my eyes at the sound of that and swallowed thickly. Seconds later feeling the embrace of Pepper as she came to hug tony. I was going to move to the side but she pulled me closer. Tony now had his arms wrapped around the both of us. This made me feel better made me feel complete. Having them both here with me. </p><p>Maybe theirs still hope to bring peter back. We just find the stones and we can maybe bring them all back. We have to have hope even if it is just a little. We need to bring him back all of them back. </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></p>",
