        "answer": "<p>I\u2019ll speak to the parallels that I was thinking of when I wrote that, but I\u2019m afraid this is not going to be \ncomprehensive because it\u2019s been a while since I read the books. I might come back to it later when I have the chance to do a \nreread. <br/></p><!-- more --><ul><li>Adapting to their surroundings and managing their image<br/></li></ul><p>Both Arya and Sansa have a penchant for adapting which develops from an intuitive \nreaction to a conscious effort that plays on managing people\u2019s \nperception of them. Sansa approaches it through the medium of a lady\u2019s \neducation; she instinctively employs her socially-approved image as a \nproper lady and her courtesies to try and sway the court in her favor \nwhen she delivers her plea for Ned\u2019s life, then consciously and \ncarefully modifies her mannerisms and her wardrobe \n to reflect the persona she wants to convince\n others of as she shifts from playing Joffrey\u2019s dedicated royal \nbetrothed to Littlefinger\u2019s daughter-slash-mentee to the bastard girl \nthe Vale lords think her to be. She takes care of how to present herself to various factions and leans \ninto people\u2019s perception of her as unthreatening and naive to achieve \nher goals. Who would think that little Sansa was planning her escape in \nthe godswood? Who would pay much attention to the unassuming bastard girl?<br/></p><p>Arya also leans into people\u2019s mistaken \nperceptions of her.

Aegon V lived with the commoners over the course of his squiring\n for Ser Duncan the Tall which made him more attuned to the needs and \nstruggles of a social class that often goes ignored by the high lords.

That Sansa experiences the prejudiced attitude leveled at bastards and \nArya shares in the hardships the smallfolk go through could only bolster\n their innate kindness in \nhaving them able to empathize with the plight of those \nwho \nsuffer from the class hierarchy that tramples the weak in the game \nof thrones. The \ndegree of separation that the girls had before gets degraded to an extent. They \nstruggle through those hardships and prejudices, through the cruelty and\n apathy of the noble class towards a population they don\u2019t see as \nvaluable enough. That can only make Sansa and Arya mindful of how their \ndecisions reflect on those below them in the social ladder when they are\n the ones in charge and enable them to be a source of change to the social attitude towards lower classes.<br/></p><p>A similar effect would result from how the girls went through experiences that showed them\nthe horrors of war. Arya travels through the Riverlands and sees\n how war, even just and righteous ones, ravishes the people and exacts a \ntoll on the commoners first and foremost. She sees the destruction and the misery Robb\u2019s troops inflict on innocents in a similar way to the Lannisters\u2019. Sansa lives the \nreality of being a political hostage and what it really means to have \nyour life hanging on the balance. While the Lannisters push and break \nthe boundaries of acceptable practices as always, holding hostages \nagainst the good behavior of their family on the threat of death remains\n an acceptable political tool that everyone freely partakes in. It is \nalso a fundamentally unjust practice that inflicts harm on people for \nthe actions of their kin. The Starklings have all grown up with Theon \nsuffering from that perilous position but none of them really understood\n it. That builds an awareness of the consequences of these accepted political practice and puts the human side of the game of thrones firmly on their minds.</p><ul><li>Leadership skills</li></ul><p>\nThe arcs of the Starks girls, different as they get, keep circling back \nto how they personify an ideology that implanted the Starks into the \nvery history of the North. Despite not being in power the way characters\n like Jon or Dany are in their own leadership roles, the girls find \nthemselves in spaces that allows them to understand power, whether as a \nduty or a privilege, and build their own leadership model. The thing to note is that the Stark girls understand that leadership is a duty of protection and care. So it\u2019s not just that Sansa saves Dontos Hollard or talks Joffrey into giving that poor Kingslander with the dead baby money instead of running her down, it\u2019s not just that Arya fiercely pursues justice for those victimized by the Lannisters from Mycah to Ned to Lanna to Lomy; it\u2019s that the girls understand that that leadership is a responsibility. Sansa correctly identifies that \nruling through love through easing the suffering of people is the correct principle and considers it a main part of royal role.\n\nArya steps in for her family taking on the role of the Stark in Winterfell when she metes out justice to Daeron in the name of the Starks. Both girls reflect their father\u2019s ideology and teachings, with Arya directly invoking Ned\u2019s leadership lessons to Robb and Jon.</p><p>As the story progresses, the girls get more instances where they step up to take charge in time of need. Arya emerges as a natural leader during the attack on Yoren\u2019s group and tries her best to steer her little newfound pack away from danger. She plots with Jaqen to free the Northmen and refuses to leave Gendy and Hot Pie behind when she flees Harrenhal. She takes Weasel under her wing and is very protective of her. \nBeing caring and protective has always been in Arya\u2019s nature but we see her growing awareness of the unfairness of the world and her determination to push back. This is the girl who stepped in between Joffrey and Mycah and was literally the only person who cares about justice for Mycah after all. Justice is a major concern for Arya, but she also clearly understands \nthat justice has to be tempered with mercy as shown in her reaction to \nthe Karstark men dying in crow cages. \n\n<br/></p><p>Where Arya leans more towards the protector role, Sansa leans towards the providing aspect of leadership. She is associated with the wish to provide foodstuff to the starving population of King\u2019s Landing, with successfully getting Joffrey to give money, with giving comfort to the terrified women during the Blackwater, with helping Lancel and calling for medical attention. Her more traditional feminine skills like sewing and running the household has always been cited as majorly important skills to surviving in winter. Sansa\u2019s story associates her with relief efforts which she is positioned to do as winter kicks in with a vengeance considering that Littlefinger is currently hoarding food up in the Vale. <a href=\"https://moonlitgleek.tumblr.com/post/166825231390/do-you-think-sansa-will-ever-return-home-or-see-wf\" target=\"_blank\">I\u2019m quite invested in the theory</a> that <a href=\"https://joannalannister.tumblr.com/post/152192054786/hi-first-i-have-to-say-i-love-your-metas-the-one\" target=\"_blank\">she\u2019ll be the one to hold Winterfell during the thick of the War for the Dawn</a> as the castle becomes a refuge for those fleeing winter and the Others.

Her affinity for political analysis shows itself when she thinks over what Margaery\u2019s betrothal to Joffrey and Loras\u2019 appointment to the Kingsguard mean in light of Joff\u2019s temperament, \nunknowingly putting her finger on the design of the Purple Wedding. In the aftermath of the wedding, \nshe connects the missing \namethyst\n\n in her hairnet and Dontos\u2019 insistence that she wears it to the wedding \nto Joffrey\u2019s murder, a fact Littlefinger confirms later. She also \nfigures out that Petyr framed Tyrion from the information that he was \nthe one who arranged for the jousting dwarves. In the Vale, Sansa understands the significance of Petyr\u2019s act in granting Nestor Royce the Gates of the Moon as a political play, and pays close attention to the Lords Declarant upon their arrival in the Eyrie, noting the purpose behind the seating arrangements and deducing that Lyn Corbray is working with Littlefinger. Her training montage with Littlefinger includes lessons her about inheritance, the intricacies of social interactions and the interpersonal dynamics of\n Vale nobility which is immensely valuable in a political setting.

She has always been good at listening and her underfoot tendencies gave her access to a lot of important information ahead of time, even if she does not always realize their importance in the moment. From the plotting of Varys and Illyrio to the design of the Red Wedding, Arya gets bits and pieces about some rather significant events. Syrio Forel hones her skills by teaching her to be fast and silent, to look closely and observe carefully which Arya consciously employs across her arc, most notably when she sees the guards in grey cloaks waiting by the Wind Witch and figures out that they are not her father\u2019s men. The kindly man only bolsters Arya\u2019s perceptiveness by forcing her to rely on her other senses and furthers her awareness of body language and facial expressions, both her own and other people\u2019s, which helps her see through people\u2019s lies and also sell her own lies capably. The kindly man also encourages Arya further to observe and listen once in Braavos by asking her to learn three new things every day, and the things Arya bring ranges from mundane (jabes, riddles) to important politically (sailor\u2019s tales about the war in Slaver\u2019s Bay and Dany\u2019s dragons) and economically (\u201dtricks of this trade or the other\u201d). <br/></p><p>On top of that, Arya\u2019s time in Braavos exposes her to a\ndifferent culture, ruling model and political atmosphere, which she we see her use to build a growing understanding of the politics of Bravoos and how it compares to that of Westeros. Her political ability shines through when she uses the data she gathered to deduce that the death of the current ill Sealord will bring a conflict and assassinations till a new one, who she identifies as Tormo Fregar, comes out on top. \nArya\u2019s knack of making friends with any and everyone, whether highborn \nand lowborn, Westeros native or not, means she is quite capable of \nbuilding a huge network of relationships and diverse sources of \ninformation. <br/></p><p>Parallels also exist in the way Sansa and Arya are both learning to recognize cues that they are being played or lied to. To slip between personas as befits their circumstances but without losing the core of their identity. They are gaining a lot of knowledge about political intrigue and learning the tools of diplomatic relations. The methods and the aspects of their training montages may differ, but I don\u2019t think the skills they are each acquiring are all that divergent. In fact, I think the girls\u2019 skills are rather complementary, and they are each meant to enhance and round off the other\u2019s skillset.<br/></p>",

Sansa approaches it through the medium of a lady\u2019s \neducation; she instinctively employs her socially-approved image as a \nproper lady and her courtesies to try and sway the court in her favor \nwhen she delivers her plea for Ned\u2019s life, then consciously and \ncarefully modifies her mannerisms and her wardrobe \n to reflect the persona she wants to convince\n others of as she shifts from playing Joffrey\u2019s dedicated royal \nbetrothed to Littlefinger\u2019s daughter-slash-mentee to the bastard girl \nthe Vale lords think her to be. She takes care of how to present herself to various factions and leans \ninto people\u2019s perception of her as unthreatening and naive to achieve \nher goals. Who would think that little Sansa was planning her escape in \nthe godswood? Who would pay much attention to the unassuming bastard girl?<br></p><p>Arya also leans into people\u2019s mistaken \nperceptions of her. She is repeatedly mistaken for a boy which she \neventually uses to conceal her true identity and evade capture. We see \nher high awareness of how to behave while with Yoren to pass as a boy \nand is conscious of how her dirty appearance at Harrenhal sells her \nfalse identity as a peasant and tries to behave accordingly. \nShe learns \nto be conscious of her mannerisms in the House of Black and White to \nadapt to the identities she slips between. In fact, one of the main \nthings Arya is taught during her time in Braavos is how to adapt to her \nsurroundings and adjust everything else down to her body language and facial expressions to \ntake on a new persona and she is very adept at it. She has also \nrepeatedly uses the fact that people underestimate her because of her \nsize or her gender to get close enough to do what she wants, whether \nthat\u2019s to get information or to launch an attack as she did with the \nweasel soup.<br></p><p>That\u2019s three skills the girls are getting better \nat: learning to adapt, learning how to use self-presentation to support \nan endeavor or alter perception, and learning how to deliberately play \non others\u2019 expectations to accomplish your goal. All of which are extremely\n handy in political situations. <br></p><ul><li>\nExperiencing the life of the disadvantaged \n\n<br></li></ul><p>The experiences that Sansa and Arya go through in their\n individual journeys are sure to inform the political philosophy of both\n girls. As we\u2019ve seen with the example of Aegon V and his pro-smallfolk \nreforms, \na life among the lower social classes can have a significant effect on \npolicy. Aegon V lived with the commoners over the course of his squiring\n for Ser Duncan the Tall which made him more attuned to the needs and \nstruggles of a social class that often goes ignored by the high lords. Daenerys\u2019 powerlessness and harsh life similarly informs her anti-slavery campaign in Slaver\u2019s Bay.<br></p><p>In the same vein, Sansa and Arya\u2019s \narcs in the aftermath of Ned\u2019s death leads them to live the life of the \ndisadvantaged in a way that could only elevate their natural compassion.\n The girls are innately kind, and Arya in particular has always been \nsensitive to injustices inflicted on the weak, but it remains that the \ngirls \nstart the series with a great deal of privilege as the \ndaughters of a great lord who, despite his own compassionate nature, \ndoesn\u2019t really know what it is to live a disenfranchised or unprivileged\n life. That Sansa experiences the prejudiced attitude leveled at bastards and \nArya shares in the hardships the smallfolk go through could only bolster\n their innate kindness in \nhaving them able to empathize with the plight of those \nwho \nsuffer from the class hierarchy that tramples the weak in the game \nof thrones. The \ndegree of separation that the girls had before gets degraded to an extent. They \nstruggle through those hardships and prejudices, through the cruelty and\n apathy of the noble class towards a population they don\u2019t see as \nvaluable enough. That can only make Sansa and Arya mindful of how their \ndecisions reflect on those below them in the social ladder when they are\n the ones in charge and enable them to be a source of change to the social attitude towards lower classes.<br></p><p>A similar effect would result from how the girls went through experiences that showed them\nthe horrors of war. Arya travels through the Riverlands and sees\n how war, even just and righteous ones, ravishes the people and exacts a \ntoll on the commoners first and foremost. She sees the destruction and the misery Robb\u2019s troops inflict on innocents in a similar way to the Lannisters\u2019. Sansa lives the \nreality of being a political hostage and what it really means to have \nyour life hanging on the balance. While the Lannisters push and break \nthe boundaries of acceptable practices as always, holding hostages \nagainst the good behavior of their family on the threat of death remains\n an acceptable political tool that everyone freely partakes in. It is \nalso a fundamentally unjust practice that inflicts harm on people for \nthe actions of their kin. The Starklings have all grown up with Theon \nsuffering from that perilous position but none of them really understood\n it. That builds an awareness of the consequences of these accepted political practice and puts the human side of the game of thrones firmly on their minds.</p><ul><li>Leadership skills</li></ul><p>\nThe arcs of the Starks girls, different as they get, keep circling back \nto how they personify an ideology that implanted the Starks into the \nvery history of the North. Despite not being in power the way characters\n like Jon or Dany are in their own leadership roles, the girls find \nthemselves in spaces that allows them to understand power, whether as a \nduty or a privilege, and build their own leadership model. The thing to note is that the Stark girls understand that leadership is a duty of protection and care. So it\u2019s not just that Sansa saves Dontos Hollard or talks Joffrey into giving that poor Kingslander with the dead baby money instead of running her down, it\u2019s not just that Arya fiercely pursues justice for those victimized by the Lannisters from Mycah to Ned to Lanna to Lomy; it\u2019s that the girls understand that that leadership is a responsibility. Sansa correctly identifies that \nruling through love through easing the suffering of people is the correct principle and considers it a main part of royal role.\n\nArya steps in for her family taking on the role of the Stark in Winterfell when she metes out justice to Daeron in the name of the Starks. Both girls reflect their father\u2019s ideology and teachings, with Arya directly invoking Ned\u2019s leadership lessons to Robb and Jon.</p><p>As the story progresses, the girls get more instances where they step up to take charge in time of need. Arya emerges as a natural leader during the attack on Yoren\u2019s group and tries her best to steer her little newfound pack away from danger. She plots with Jaqen to free the Northmen and refuses to leave Gendy and Hot Pie behind when she flees Harrenhal. She takes Weasel under her wing and is very protective of her. \nBeing caring and protective has always been in Arya\u2019s nature but we see her growing awareness of the unfairness of the world and her determination to push back. This is the girl who stepped in between Joffrey and Mycah and was literally the only person who cares about justice for Mycah after all. Justice is a major concern for Arya, but she also clearly understands \nthat justice has to be tempered with mercy as shown in her reaction to \nthe Karstark men dying in crow cages. \n\n<br></p><p>Where Arya leans more towards the protector role, Sansa leans towards the providing aspect of leadership. She is associated with the wish to provide foodstuff to the starving population of King\u2019s Landing, with successfully getting Joffrey to give money, with giving comfort to the terrified women during the Blackwater, with helping Lancel and calling for medical attention. Her more traditional feminine skills like sewing and running the household has always been cited as majorly important skills to surviving in winter. Sansa\u2019s story associates her with relief efforts which she is positioned to do as winter kicks in with a vengeance considering that Littlefinger is currently hoarding food up in the Vale. <a href=\"https://moonlitgleek.tumblr.com/post/166825231390/do-you-think-sansa-will-ever-return-home-or-see-wf\" target=\"_blank\">I\u2019m quite invested in the theory</a> that <a href=\"https://joannalannister.tumblr.com/post/152192054786/hi-first-i-have-to-say-i-love-your-metas-the-one\" target=\"_blank\">she\u2019ll be the one to hold Winterfell during the thick of the War for the Dawn</a> as the castle becomes a refuge for those fleeing winter and the Others. I think both girls will embody the historical roles of the Starks in that war, with Arya protecting the North with her wolf pack and Sansa comforting and taking care of the civilians inside the castle. <br></p><ul><li>Political analysis and deduction skills<br></li></ul><p>The girls are each developing a mind for political analysis that is being bolstered by the crash course they are receiving in the Vale and the House of Black and White respectively, under mentors who actively encourage them to hone their observation skills and connect the dots to a larger picture. <br></p><p>Sansa\u2019s skill shows when she starts looking closer at her maids in the aftermath of Ned\u2019s death and concludes that they are spying on her for Cersei. Her affinity for political analysis shows itself when she thinks over what Margaery\u2019s betrothal to Joffrey and Loras\u2019 appointment to the Kingsguard mean in light of Joff\u2019s temperament, \nunknowingly putting her finger on the design of the Purple Wedding. In the aftermath of the wedding, \nshe connects the missing \namethyst\n\n in her hairnet and Dontos\u2019 insistence that she wears it to the wedding \nto Joffrey\u2019s murder, a fact Littlefinger confirms later. She also \nfigures out that Petyr framed Tyrion from the information that he was \nthe one who arranged for the jousting dwarves. In the Vale, Sansa understands the significance of Petyr\u2019s act in granting Nestor Royce the Gates of the Moon as a political play, and pays close attention to the Lords Declarant upon their arrival in the Eyrie, noting the purpose behind the seating arrangements and deducing that Lyn Corbray is working with Littlefinger. Her training montage with Littlefinger includes lessons her about inheritance, the intricacies of social interactions and the interpersonal dynamics of\n Vale nobility which is immensely valuable in a political setting. Sansa is also basically running the Eyrie right now and her idea about \nthe tourney of the Winged Knights and organizational skills shows \nbudding political skill. \n\n<br></p><p>Meanwhile, Arya is developing a knack for gathering information from multiple sources and how to separate hard facts from her own deductions. She has always been good at listening and her underfoot tendencies gave her access to a lot of important information ahead of time, even if she does not always realize their importance in the moment. From the plotting of Varys and Illyrio to the design of the Red Wedding, Arya gets bits and pieces about some rather significant events. Syrio Forel hones her skills by teaching her to be fast and silent, to look closely and observe carefully which Arya consciously employs across her arc, most notably when she sees the guards in grey cloaks waiting by the Wind Witch and figures out that they are not her father\u2019s men. The kindly man only bolsters Arya\u2019s perceptiveness by forcing her to rely on her other senses and furthers her awareness of body language and facial expressions, both her own and other people\u2019s, which helps her see through people\u2019s lies and also sell her own lies capably. The kindly man also encourages Arya further to observe and listen once in Braavos by asking her to learn three new things every day, and the things Arya bring ranges from mundane (jabes, riddles) to important politically (sailor\u2019s tales about the war in Slaver\u2019s Bay and Dany\u2019s dragons) and economically (\u201dtricks of this trade or the other\u201d). <br></p><p>On top of that, Arya\u2019s time in Braavos exposes her to a\ndifferent culture, ruling model and political atmosphere, which she we see her use to build a growing understanding of the politics of Bravoos and how it compares to that of Westeros. Her political ability shines through when she uses the data she gathered to deduce that the death of the current ill Sealord will bring a conflict and assassinations till a new one, who she identifies as Tormo Fregar, comes out on top. \nArya\u2019s knack of making friends with any and everyone, whether highborn \nand lowborn, Westeros native or not, means she is quite capable of \nbuilding a huge network of relationships and diverse sources of \ninformation. <br></p><p>Parallels also exist in the way Sansa and Arya are both learning to recognize cues that they are being played or lied to. To slip between personas as befits their circumstances but without losing the core of their identity. They are gaining a lot of knowledge about political intrigue and learning the tools of diplomatic relations. The methods and the aspects of their training montages may differ, but I don\u2019t think the skills they are each acquiring are all that divergent. In fact, I think the girls\u2019 skills are rather complementary, and they are each meant to enhance and round off the other\u2019s skillset.<br></p>",

They want her to be nice to Daenerys, Creepyfinger, Tyrion, Jon, etc the way she was forced to be nice to Joffrey and Cersei. When they didn\u2019t get that, they whined about her attitude and pretended that they prefered book Sansa. And the only way their repugnant ships could happen it's where Sansa is still a \"little bird\" with no agency or power.",
        "answer": "<blockquote><p><i>2/ The thing is they hate book Sansa too, they don\u2019t understand her, they think she\u2019s a secondary character at best and that she deserves to be with a pedophile just because he is ugly or has been rejected. When book Sansa gains agency and rejects their faves, they\u2019ll stop pretending they like her. They like the idea of the pretty girl in a cage. They don\u2019t want her to fly free. The second she gets agency in the books, she\u2019s going to lose half of her so-called \u201cfan base\u201d.</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>100% right. They fetishize so-called goodness, victimhood and a lack of agency, and worst of all, sexual purity.</p><p>And to add on, for me anyway, it was never about the men she\u2019s shipped with being\u00a0\u201cugly\u201d because for one thing, in the show at least, they\u2019re not remotely unattractive! Peter Dinklage especially is extremely charismatic which just adds to his appeal and in the show, Tyrion definitely likes and respects Sansa as a person although I\u2019d still argue it\u2019s not remotely romantic on either side no matter what gross comments Bronn makes. But even in the show, Sandor definitely terrifies Sansa (I was so glad he got more scenes with Arya without the creepy romantic undertone of the scenes with Sansa who\u2019s young enough to be his daughter) and Littlefinger literally sells her to the Boltons (Jeyne Poole in the books) so I don\u2019t want them anywhere near her! And in the books, Tyrion is much darker than in the show and a rapist, which he isn\u2019t in the show so I can enjoy their scenes in the show but am very uncomfortable by his thoughts about her in the book.</p><p>Plus like, in the show, Tyrion has miles more chemistry with DANY than Dany does with Jon and Peter has confirmed Tyrion has feelings for her but nobody ships them and hmmm I wonder why\u2026 I feel like that\u2019s where the fandom\u2019s ableism comes in, not when people, namely women, are leery about shipping a teenage girl with a man whose family murdered hers. And in the show, Emilia Clarke\u2019s about a decade older than Sophie Turner and definitely didn\u2019t look 18 even at the beginning of the show so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same kind of power dynamic issue as Sansa/Tyrion especially since Dany\u2019s an adult and a queen when Tyrion\u2019s her hand while Sansa\u2019s a teenage hostage when married to Tyrion and if he had wanted to rape her, couldn\u2019t say no (which again, is a turn-on to some people because they prefer when women are subjugated and \u201ckept down\u201d and well, living in fear).\u00a0</p>",
