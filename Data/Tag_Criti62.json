A Beau who spends as much time as she can get away with playing in the dirt, surrounded by trees and spending hours watching the animals, the rats &amp; birds &amp; bugs &amp; deer that she loves more than the actual people in her life. Socially awkward Beau falling more in tune with these animals than she ever manages w/ humans. A Beau who one night wanders reaaal deep into those woods after a fight with her parents and accidentally winds up getting touched by a sympathetic/feisty nature spirit. Then suddenly the forest around her is responding to her in ways it never has before, and the deer and squirrels no longer run away or get startled by her presence, and sometimes she can do weird things like make the flowers around her blossom, or light a candle without even touching it, or make her parents\u2019 bedroom smell faintly, inexplicably like skunk spray after they\u2019ve done or said something shitty.</p><p>But mostly&ndash; imagine Beau getting older and gaining WILD SHAPE. Beauregard with the same gruff, rebellious, awkward, playful asshole personality she has in canon but now SHE CAN TURN INTO ANIMALS. Beau who as a teen was likely forced by her parents to look and act \u201cfeminine\u201d and \u201cladylike,\u201d making her feel awkward and uncomfortable in her own body, so then preferring to spend more time as a rat or wolf or panther or frog than as a human. Then maybe Beau gets involved in crime and smuggling anyway, but now she\u2019s better than any of her accomplices at recon and stealth and getting into impossible locked buildings, and most of them never figure out why.</p><p>Fast forward to Beau meeting Fjord and Jester as, like, a fckin mastiff people-watching in Trostenwald or some-shit, and Jester is just like OMG LOOK FJORD, LOOK AT THIS ADORABLE PUPPY DO U THINK SHE HAS AN OWNER?? CAN WE KEEP HER and Fjord is just \u201cwtf jester u can\u2019t call this a puppy, this thing is like 200 pounds.\u201d but then it eventually y\u2019know turns out to be a rude af scrawny human girl who\u2019s like \u201chey man what the fuck, do you have a problem with my weight ???\u201d</p><p>Also uh Beau as a cat chilling with Frumpkin. Beau probably spending half their time traveling as a cat or weasel draped around Jester\u2019s neck Sprinkle-style, until they get the actual pets (then Beau getting lowkey jealous of Sprinkle; they\u2019re *rivals* now). Alternatively she just goes as the RUDEST horse who bucks Molly off whenever he tries to hop on, meanwhile she\u2019s like \u201cHey Yasha just FYI, you are welcome to ride me <i>anytime </i>u want ;)\u201d And when they do get the pets.. Like, uh. BEAU CAN WILD SHAPE INTO A BLINK DOG. Beau and Nugget would be best friends, these chaotic asshole blink puppy buddies. Also Beau casting Speak With Animals to talk to Prof. Thaddeus like \u201chey. Hey quick question but WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SUCH A DICK? pls work with me here\u201d</p><p>Beau would be so chaotic with druid spellcasting in general, she really would be dnd Korra. And when they meet Caduceus he\u2019s probably like \u201cI sense you are one of the Wildmother\u2019s favored ones\u201d and she\u2019s just, \u201cWHOSE mother?? What? Anyway do u wanna see me fry this dude with lightning\u201d</p><p>Plus when Beau gets access to flight-capable beasts at level 8 u just know she is gonna want to spend all her time as a bird, soaring in the sky above the group as an owl or crow or hawk, or giving Jester or Nott rides as a giant eagle.. Just Beau still being cagey and shy about displaying affection as a human, but feeling a lot more comfortable being tactile w/ her friends when using wild shape!!!</p><p><strike>but also she\u2019d have to multiclass because oh god FUCK THAT TIMELESS BODY SHIT</strike></p>",

Socially awkward Beau falling more in tune with these animals than she ever manages w/ humans. A Beau who one night wanders reaaal deep into those woods after a fight with her parents and accidentally winds up getting touched by a sympathetic/feisty nature spirit. Then suddenly the forest around her is responding to her in ways it never has before, and the deer and squirrels no longer run away or get startled by her presence, and sometimes she can do weird things like make the flowers around her blossom, or light a candle without even touching it, or make her parents&rsquo; bedroom smell faintly, inexplicably like skunk spray after they&rsquo;ve done or said something shitty.</p><p>But mostly&ndash; imagine Beau getting older and gaining WILD SHAPE. Beauregard with the same gruff, rebellious, awkward, playful asshole personality she has in canon but now SHE CAN TURN INTO ANIMALS. Beau who as a teen was likely forced by her parents to look and act &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; and &ldquo;ladylike,&rdquo; making her feel awkward and uncomfortable in her own body, so then preferring to spend more time as a rat or wolf or panther or frog than as a human. Then maybe Beau gets involved in crime and smuggling anyway, but now she&rsquo;s better than any of her accomplices at recon and stealth and getting into impossible locked buildings, and most of them never figure out why.</p><p>Fast forward to Beau meeting Fjord and Jester as, like, a fckin mastiff people-watching in Trostenwald or some-shit, and Jester is just like OMG LOOK FJORD, LOOK AT THIS ADORABLE PUPPY DO U THINK SHE HAS AN OWNER?? CAN WE KEEP HER and Fjord is just &ldquo;wtf jester u can&rsquo;t call this a puppy, this thing is like 200 pounds.&rdquo; but then it eventually y&rsquo;know turns out to be a rude af scrawny human girl who&rsquo;s like &ldquo;hey man what the fuck, do you have a problem with my weight ???&rdquo;</p><p>Also uh Beau as a cat chilling with Frumpkin. Beau probably spending half their time traveling as a cat or weasel draped around Jester&rsquo;s neck Sprinkle-style, until they get the actual pets (then Beau getting lowkey jealous of Sprinkle; they&rsquo;re *rivals* now). Alternatively she just goes as the RUDEST horse who bucks Molly off whenever he tries to hop on, meanwhile she&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Hey Yasha just FYI, you are welcome to ride me <i>anytime </i>u want ;)&rdquo; And when they do get the pets.. Like, uh. BEAU CAN WILD SHAPE INTO A BLINK DOG. Beau and Nugget would be best friends, these chaotic asshole blink puppy buddies. Also Beau casting Speak With Animals to talk to Prof. Thaddeus like &ldquo;hey. Hey quick question but WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SUCH A DICK? pls work with me here&rdquo;</p><p>Beau would be so chaotic with druid spellcasting in general, she really would be dnd Korra. And when they meet Caduceus he&rsquo;s probably like &ldquo;I sense you are one of the Wildmother&rsquo;s favored ones&rdquo; and she&rsquo;s just, &ldquo;WHOSE mother?? What? Anyway do u wanna see me fry this dude with lightning&rdquo;</p><p>Plus when Beau gets access to flight-capable beasts at level 8 u just know she is gonna want to spend all her time as a bird, soaring in the sky above the group as an owl or crow or hawk, or giving Jester or Nott rides as a giant eagle.. Just Beau still being cagey and shy about displaying affection as a human, but feeling a lot more comfortable being tactile w/ her friends when using wild shape!!!</p><p><strike>but also she&rsquo;d have to multiclass because oh god FUCK THAT TIMELESS BODY SHIT</strike></p>",
