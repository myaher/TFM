<i>confringo</i>!\u201d<br/></p><p>they were pushed by the spells towards the walls. their heads were hit as they let out groans and fainted. the spider-guy stood still as if shocked. she walked towards him, ready to perform the <i>obliviate</i> charm on the superhero.</p><p>\u201cyou should tie them up, just in case. this is a wizard matter, not a no-maj one. i\u2019ll notify our government and clean this up, but you have to forget this,\u201d (y/n) told him.<br/></p><p>\u201cwhat?! why?\u201d a familiar voice asked from under the mask as the slits moved in response to his own expression.</p><p>her eyebrows furrowed, and her eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u201cyour voice sounds familiar, do i know you?\u201d</p><p>the eyes of the mask opened wide, and the familiar stranger shook his head in fear. she took a few steps towards him, ready to uncover his disguise. he took a few steps back in response. right before she could grab at the mask, the spider-guy flung himself away with webs faster than she could react and cast a spell.\u00a0\u201chey!\u201d she shouted after him as he disappeared into the city.</p><p>\u201cmerlin&hellip; i hope the MACUSA doesn\u2019t find out&hellip;\u201d she whispered to herself as she walked over to deal with the fainted criminals. using her gift in transfiguration, she transformed the broken rocks into small vials.</p><p>\u201clet\u2019s turn you into little insects, shall we?\u201d (y/n) asked, mostly to herself. for your average wizard, yes, it\u2019s quite difficult to transfigure someone else. however, (y/n) wasn\u2019t the average witch. she graduated at the top of her class for a reason and had won several excellence awards at ilvermorny. one of them happened to be for transfiguration. with a wave of her wand, one man turned into a beetle, and the smaller one a ladybug.\u00a0<br/></p><p>she placed them into the vials and made holes at the top for air. but wasn\u2019t there something else she had to&hellip;? <i>peter</i>. <i>shit</i>, she thought to herself as her (e/c) eyes widened.</p><p>there was no way (y/n) could hand the criminals over to the magical government without ditching peter. and that was something she didn\u2019t wanna do. pocketing the vials and her wand in her pantyhose, she left the mess and ran to the cafe. she ducked under the table they were at previously as to not raise suspicion.</p><p>peter darted out of the bathroom, panting a little.\u00a0\u201c(y/n)? are you okay? i called the police, and they should be here.\u201d</p><p>she peeked from her hiding place and lied between her teeth.\u00a0\u201cyeah, i\u2019m okay&hellip; the criminals already escaped though.\u201d</p><p>his brown eyes narrowed a little as if to judge her, but they quickly returned to normal. peter approached the table and lent out a hand to help her out. she took it, and he pulled her up with surprising strength. something clicked in her mind. \u201clet\u2019s get you home then,\u201d he told her with a smile.</p><p>\u201cyeah, that would be great. it\u2019s been a long day,\u201d (y/n) said to him. they walked out of the store, peter holding the door for her. he didn\u2019t close it and leave, but turned to shout something.</p><p>\u201chey, sal! thanks for letting us stay! we\u2019ll be leaving now!\u201d another click. she knew that voice.<br/></p><p>\u201calright, peter! you get home safely!\u201d the owner shouted back.<br/></p><p>\u201cwill do!\u201d and he closed the door and nodded to her. she stood, not moving as he walked away. he noticed and turned around to look at her. his eyebrows were raised.\u00a0\u201c(y/n), is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cpeter&hellip; you wouldn\u2019t lie to me right?\u201d she hesitantly said. she looked up at him slowly.<br/></p><p>\u201ci wouldn\u2019t. what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked curiously.<br/></p><p>\u201care you&hellip; that spider superhero?\u201d<br/></p><p>his face froze as his eyes widened and looked at her. his lips tried to form words before he gulped and started to speak,\u00a0\u201cthen, are you&hellip; a witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cpeter, we need to talk.\u201d he nodded.\u00a0\u201csomewhere private. and now.\u201d<br/></p><p>(y/n) stepped towards him and grabbed his hand. she knew she shouldn\u2019t be doing this, but this was an emergency.\u00a0\u201csorry,\u201d she apologized in advance.</p><p>\u201cwhy are y\u2014\u201c he started to ask, and that is when she apparated them to her apartment.\u00a0\u201cWHOA!\u201d peter stumbled a little and fell on his bottom.\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s why you were\u2014\u201c\u00a0</p><p>she answered with a nod. she was glad he was still the same peter with his easily excited personality in these sort of situations. \u201chave a seat, pete. we have a lot of explaining to do.\u201d<br/></p><p><i>\u201cyeah, we do, (y/n/n).\u201d</i><br/></p><p><i><a href=\"https://peachyypotter.tumblr.com/post/175891017013/peachyypotters-sprouting-imagine-masterlist\">general masterlist</a></i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://peachyypotter.tumblr.com/post/176667513068/double-double-fantasy-peter-parker-x-witch\">series masterlist</a></i></p><p><b>tag list</b>: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ2sj66ITaidEYQON7XKzHg\">@eh-ilikestuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moqEFJjn5bIsNSyuwadTrvQ\">@mbsgr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6W_hcHUayKBVph83MwzFuA\">@aknerdchick</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSHWnm5YYvwilIEUqlsU4dg\">@glader-witch-wolf</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/my_ro0S4ECXu9cK0MVoIyDw\">@bxsunshine</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbxKTqI7Sd3LkwpvegwGiyg\">@dark-night-sky-99</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msEsreOmIXmYQU9IXpBozrQ\">@daringbanshee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvxfgttGCmNc8W-0BNWdE1w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvxfgttGCmNc8W-0BNWdE1w\">@amagicalmess</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNvJsbKok_GcU-m8-hv2dCg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNvJsbKok_GcU-m8-hv2dCg\">@krispykreeme</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu2Lx6-oDqIfWECsH3BfE8A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu2Lx6-oDqIfWECsH3BfE8A\">@m4shtyx</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8RopNrvvyXKaF265RSVNXw\">@peter-spider-parker-man</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjCnwuBPM1PTVOFc4gTb9Yg\">@cutepineapplex3</a></p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XVb01Essr42kJEtpLVn2VehcVwJbcvikfUEEWrmNVr0/\">ask to join a tag list!</a></i></b></p>",
