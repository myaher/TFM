I refuse to allow you to hide it from me.\u201d</p><p>Arya giggled happily then, and your heart swelled. She so rarely laughed nowadays; you were constantly striving to make her do so, and you felt incredibly accomplished when you did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too sweet to me, you know that?\u201d Arya said, smiling at you.</p><p>\u201cI would argue that <i>you </i>are the one who is too sweet to <i>me</i>. But I won\u2019t, because I suspect we\u2019d be arguing for hours on that subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect you\u2019re right,\u201d Arya agreed, and you leaned forward to place a quick kiss on her lips.</p><p>\u201cI know you want to make a good impression, but you worry far too much. I\u2019m sure your letter is as perfect as it can possibly be. You should send it with the raven and then get some rest,\u201d you declared, and Arya sighed. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she muttered, then set the letter aside so she could stand and stretch. Before she had the chance to do much else, you stood behind her and wrapped your arms around her waist, resting your chin on her shoulder and placing a kiss on her jaw.</p><p>Arya sighed once more, but this time, it was more a sigh of content than of stress. She leaned back into you, resting her hands over yours and relishing in the warmth of your embrace as compared to the chill of the room. After a few moments of peaceful silence, she turned in your arms to place a kiss on your lips. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go send the raven. In the meantime, why don\u2019t you add more wood to the fire, and when I return, you can tell me more about that new book of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds wonderful,\u201d you said, kissing her nose before reluctantly releasing her.</p><p>You did as she suggested, and she returned shortly after, quick to crawl into bed beside you and rest her head on your shoulder.</p><p>The remainder of the evening was spent enjoying one another\u2019s company, Arya listening patiently as you told her all about the book you had just finished. She\u2019d said that she honestly enjoyed hearing your renditions of novels more than actually reading them. When you\u2019d questioned that statement, she explained that she just liked the sound of your voice, and it never failed to sooth her. She\u2019d been through a great deal in her young life, so you were more than happy to do whatever you could to aid her relaxation.</p><p>Shortly before you\u2019d finished relaying the ending of the book, you noticed that Arya had begun to put her full weight on you, and her breathing had slowed. Upon glancing down at her, you noticed that her eyes were closed, and she was sound asleep. You placed a kiss on her forehead, then covered you both up with more blankets, and the comfort of her embrace did wonders to lull you to sleep, eagerly joining your love in the realm of dreams.</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/my1Y10BCPc352ZwbDXV7M9A\">@whoabrekker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3eR-PVcC926uIY_PAAC6aA\">@alexsunmners</a></p>",

You had spent so long believing she was dead, as so many others had convinced you she was, and while you refused to believe it at first, you slowly became to accept that it was a very real possibility.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t expected Arya to be the same, mischievous girl you had once fooled around with in the Winterfell courtyards, but there was something about her that had changed so dramatically it almost felt as though she was a stranger. There was an aura of mystery surrounding her, lips curled into a smile as if she knew something bigger than all of you, a secret she refused to tell anyone. She lurked around the towers, her footsteps silent, often frightening you as she\u2019d approach you from behind without even noticing.</p><p>And then there was her fighting skills. You had always known Arya was a fighter, but you had seen her spar with Brienne with Sansa. Arya was precise, quick, deadly \u2013 that wasn\u2019t something she could\u2019ve learned by herself.</p><p>\u201cWho taught you how to do that?\u201d Brienne had asked, and you couldn\u2019t forget the smile Arya had flashed Brienne.</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d she had replied, without missing a beat.</p><p>Arya had asked you about what had happened to you after Ned was executed, and you had so easily told her, your stories spilling from your lips before you realized she had never told you how she had survived, where she had gone. You had asked her multiple times, desperate to know where she had been, yet she remained elusive, her answers vague, clearly hiding something from you.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know what she could be hiding. What had happened to the youngest Stark girl, and who had she become?<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are you hiding from me, Arya?\u201d you demanded one day, and Arya simply smiled, as if amused by your confusion.\u00a0\u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me where you\u2019ve been all this time?\u201d<br/></p><p>Arya didn\u2019t respond, simply looking out as the snow quietly floated down onto every possible surface below, a white blanket over Winterfell. You would never believe her even if she told you. She took a deep breath, \u201cNowhere.\u201d\u00a0</p>",
