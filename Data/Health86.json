We spent most of our weekend at home in our pajamas tending to Ryder who seemed to catch whatever bug hit me and Chase a week and a half ago. Thankfully he seemed remarkably better by Sunday afternoon so my hopes are high that whatever bug he\u2019s fighting will be a short one. Suffice it to say I don\u2019t have much of a weekend recap for you guys today but I do have a lot of delicious dinner recipes to share with you!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-10.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85092\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-10-683x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"359\" height=\"538\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-10-683x1024.png 683w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-10-200x300.png 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-10.png 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px\"/></a></p>\n<p>In keeping with the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/a-week-of-january-weeknight-dinners-a-whole-lot-of-bowls/\">debut of this series</a>\u00a0on my blog last month, today I\u2019m sharing my February edition of \u2018A Week of Weeknight Dinners.\u2019 Now that this is the second month I\u2019m assembling this kind of blog post, I think it\u2019s interesting to see how I get into various kicks with our meals. Last month I was clearly into warm and hearty soups and meals in bowls and this month I was all about exploring more meat-free recipes and really fell in love with lentils all over again.</p>\n<p>Three of the five recipes below are vegetarian dishes and I\u2019d absolutely make every single recipe we enjoyed last week again. I made sure to include any notes about my alterations to the recipes and photographed the recipes as we were about to eat them so you can see what they look like in the moment without any fancy schmancy food styling.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d also love to hear about any must-make recipes you guys have been loving this month. Clearly anything with lentils is right up my alley these days, so if you have a great lentil-based recipe we should try, let me know!</p>\n<h4>A Week of Weeknight Dinners</h4>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><strong><a href=\"http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269783/cheesy-spinach-artichoke-stuffed-spaghetti-squash/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269783/cheesy-spinach-artichoke-stuffed-spaghetti-squash/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1551119670304000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvT4Vavwffj8b6gJzpNm7cYGDUpA\">Cheesy Spinach Artichoke Spaghetti Squash</a>\u00a0via Eating Well Magazine\u00a0</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4430.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85091\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4430-1024x767.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"492\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4430-1024x767.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4430-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4430-768x575.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4430.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\"/></a></p>\n<p>The first issue of Eating Well magazine in 2019 was a slam dunk! I\u2019ve made a handful of recipes from the January/February issue and we\u2019ve loved them all! The recipe for Cheesy Spinach Artichoke Spaghetti Squash was a meat-free meal that was absolutely bursting with cheesy flavor. It was rich and filling but still veggie-packed. I made a couple of changes to the recipe but nothing major. I simply used full-fat cream cheese in place of reduced fat and used an extra &frac14; cup of Parmesan cheese since we looove cheese in this house! For the sake of cutting down the time the recipe took to make, I cooked the spaghetti squash in the microwave and then put the casserole in a baking dish to broil rather than scooping everything back into the spaghetti squash shells. If you\u2019re a fan of spinach artichoke dip, give this recipe a try!</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><strong><a href=\"http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269820/slow-cooker-chicken-white-bean-stew/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Slow Cooker Chicken and White Bean Stew</a>\u00a0via Eating Well Magazine</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85088\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"522\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px\"/></a></p>\n<div>\n<p>This slow cooker recipe was another Eating Well Magazine winner! It appealed to me instantly when I glanced at the ingredient list and knew our family would enjoy this Tuscan-inspired dish. We paired our stew with crusty sourdough bread and thought it was fantastic! I also loved digging into leftovers of this soup and almost felt like it was better the next day. The only change I made was to add a little poultry seasoning to the broth and I also added canned chickpeas the the soup at the end rather than white beans.

We spent most of our weekend at home in our pajamas tending to Ryder who seemed to catch whatever bug hit me and Chase a week and a half ago. Thankfully he seemed remarkably better by Sunday afternoon so my hopes are high that whatever bug he\u2019s fighting will be a short one. Suffice it to say I don\u2019t have much of a weekend recap for you guys today but I do have a lot of delicious dinner recipes to share with you!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-10.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85092\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-10-683x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"359\" height=\"538\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-10-683x1024.png 683w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-10-200x300.png 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-10.png 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px\"></a></p>\n<p>In keeping with the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/a-week-of-january-weeknight-dinners-a-whole-lot-of-bowls/\">debut of this series</a>\u00a0on my blog last month, today I\u2019m sharing my February edition of \u2018A Week of Weeknight Dinners.\u2019 Now that this is the second month I\u2019m assembling this kind of blog post, I think it\u2019s interesting to see how I get into various kicks with our meals. Last month I was clearly into warm and hearty soups and meals in bowls and this month I was all about exploring more meat-free recipes and really fell in love with lentils all over again.</p>\n<p>Three of the five recipes below are vegetarian dishes and I\u2019d absolutely make every single recipe we enjoyed last week again. I made sure to include any notes about my alterations to the recipes and photographed the recipes as we were about to eat them so you can see what they look like in the moment without any fancy schmancy food styling.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d also love to hear about any must-make recipes you guys have been loving this month. Clearly anything with lentils is right up my alley these days, so if you have a great lentil-based recipe we should try, let me know!</p>\n<h4>A Week of Weeknight Dinners</h4>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><strong><a href=\"http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269783/cheesy-spinach-artichoke-stuffed-spaghetti-squash/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269783/cheesy-spinach-artichoke-stuffed-spaghetti-squash/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1551119670304000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvT4Vavwffj8b6gJzpNm7cYGDUpA\">Cheesy Spinach Artichoke Spaghetti Squash</a>\u00a0via Eating Well Magazine\u00a0</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4430.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85091\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4430-1024x767.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"492\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4430-1024x767.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4430-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4430-768x575.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4430.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\"></a></p>\n<p>The first issue of Eating Well magazine in 2019 was a slam dunk! I\u2019ve made a handful of recipes from the January/February issue and we\u2019ve loved them all! The recipe for Cheesy Spinach Artichoke Spaghetti Squash was a meat-free meal that was absolutely bursting with cheesy flavor. It was rich and filling but still veggie-packed. I made a couple of changes to the recipe but nothing major. I simply used full-fat cream cheese in place of reduced fat and used an extra \u00bc cup of Parmesan cheese since we looove cheese in this house! For the sake of cutting down the time the recipe took to make, I cooked the spaghetti squash in the microwave and then put the casserole in a baking dish to broil rather than scooping everything back into the spaghetti squash shells. If you\u2019re a fan of spinach artichoke dip, give this recipe a try!</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><strong><a href=\"http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269820/slow-cooker-chicken-white-bean-stew/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Slow Cooker Chicken and White Bean Stew</a>\u00a0via Eating Well Magazine</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85088\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"522\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4389.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px\"></a></p>\n<div>\n<p>This slow cooker recipe was another Eating Well Magazine winner!

We spent most of our weekend at home in our pajamas tending to Ryder who seemed to catch whatever bug hit me and Chase a week and a half ago. Thankfully he seemed remarkably better by Sunday afternoon so my hopes are high that whatever bug he\u2019s fighting will be a short one.

I made a couple of changes to the recipe but nothing major. I simply used full-fat cream cheese in place of reduced fat and used an extra \u00bc cup of Parmesan cheese since we looove cheese in this house! For the sake of cutting down the time the recipe took to make, I cooked the spaghetti squash in the microwave and then put the casserole in a baking dish to broil rather than scooping everything back into the spaghetti squash shells.
