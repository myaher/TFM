Also, i really suck at tagging, so if you want to be tagged please message me separately. Also, I post this on my AO3 as well, so if you see it anywhere else, thats still me. Thank you so much for reading :)</p><p style=\"\">Special thanks to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCTAqohmHPU-_KW6zq06aHw\">@petey-verse</a> for being the best human ever\u00a0</p><p>Pairing: Peter Parker x Reader (if you squint)\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Warnings: Depression, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, Cancer\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">Word Count: 2457</p><hr><p>Silence. </p><p>Deafening silence.</p><p>Dr. Barton\u2019s grim expression, it radiates pity.</p><p>His lips are moving, but she only hears the painful silence. </p><p>Someone grabs her hand; Sarah. Y/N turns her head and and sees her friend with fat tears rolling down her cheeks. Tears for Y/N.</p><p>The silence is replaced with a dull ringing noise deep within her brain.</p><p>Cancer? A tumor?</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Y/N chokes out. Sarah covers her mouth with her hand, attempting to stop her crying. </p><p>\u201cIt seems that a tumor has grown in your stomach. That was shown in the MRI we took as you can see here,\u201d Dr. Barton hands a tablet over with a black and white picture that she doesn\u2019t really understand. \u201cWe know its cancer because of the blood test we took earlier.\u201d </p><p>Y/N sits still for a second, letting the words Dr. Barton said sink in. Insurmountable fear courses through her veins and she feels the hair on her body prickle. </p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to die?\u201d Y/N asks. The hand that was pressed over Sarah&rsquo;s mouth drops and the sobs that were once under control now fill the room with noise. </p><p>\u201cWe are going to do everything in our power to keep that from happening Y/N. Your treatment plan is going to start as soon as possible.\u201d Dr. Barton insists. Y/N nods. </p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not going to die, I\u2019m just going to wish I was dead.\u201d Y/N mutters and sinks further into the bed. Lucky for her, Dr. Barton and Sarah didn\u2019t hear her depressing comment. </p><p>\u201cOkay, if you have any questions, just call for a nurse to get me.\u201d Dr. Barton says before leaving the room. The loud sound of the door closing seems to shake Sarah out of her sorrow. She looks up at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Sarah says softly. Y/N just rolls her eyes. </p><p>\u201cMaybe, it\u2019s time to call your dad?\u201d Sarah says pulling out Y/N\u2019s phone. </p><p>\u201cUh- yeah, I think you might be right. I\u2019ll do it. He\u2019ll want to hear it from me.\u201d Y/N rushes out.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I guess since we&rsquo;re going to be here for a while, I\u2019ll go pick up some stuff. Make this room feel more comfortable. Are you good to be alone for a few hours?\u201d Sarah asks. Y/N nods and takes her phone from Sarah. </p><p>Once she\u2019s alone, she opens up her dads contact. The smiling contact picture stares back at her. Who was she make him upset and ruin that happy smile? She exits his contact and and clicks on Derek&rsquo;s. The phone rings a few time before Derek picks up.</p><p>\u201cHello, who is this?\u201d Derek says. He had already deleted her number, that stung.</p><p>\u201cUh- it\u2019s Y/N.\u201d She chokes out. Derek sighs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He whispers. Sounds like he\u2019s moving around.</p><p>\u201cDerek, I\u2019m in trouble. I-I need help.\u201d Y/N whimpers. </p><p>\u201cY/N, seriously, what&rsquo;s going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the hospital. I, I have cancer, in my stomach, they said gastric an-and,\u201d Y/N cries. Derek audibly gasps, cutting her off.</p><p>\u201cY/N. I\u2019m so sorry. What hospital are you at?\u201d Derek yells.</p><p>\u201cMercy Grace. Derek I\u2019m so sorry. You really don\u2019t have to come. I just wanted you to know, ya know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be there in a few.\u201d Derek says, and she can hear his car door open then slam shut. The call then ends. </p><hr><p>The ER is slow today. Peter assumes it\u2019s due to it being a weekday, with all the kids in school. MJ and Ned are standing at the front desk, waiting for anyone to come in. He almost drags his body over to the desk.</p><p>\u201cI need sleep.\u201d Peter whines, throwing his upper half over the hard surface. MJ lets out a laugh, but it\u2019s more of a deep exhale. </p><p>\u201cYou, kind sir, are preaching to the choir.\u201d MJ smiles.</p><p>\u201cYeah well, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Ned shrugs. Peter raises his head and glares at Ned. </p><p>\u201cOh, can we please go to the roof today for lunch? It\u2019s so nice out and I could use some fresh air to wake me up.\u201d Peter suggests.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m down.\u201d MJ says pulling out a chart and scribbling something down.</p><p>\u201cSure, it\u2019s not like I have anything better to do.\u201d Ned chuckles. </p><p>The door to the emergency room pushes open and a man rushes through. The gang quickly perks up, ready to help when the man comes over to a table.</p><p>\u201cI-I know the emergency room is for emergencies only, but there\u2019s no parking near the main entrance, and I really need to see my gir- uh, ex-girlfriend.\u201d The man quickly rambles. </p><p>\u201cOkay, I need her name.\u201d Peter says, helping the man, which causes Ned and MJ to move away to check on patients.</p><p>\u201cUh, Y/N Y/L/N, she said she has cancer.\u201d The man says. Y/N Y/L/N, Peter quickly wonders if that was the girl he helped with the needles, but pushes the thought aside. He types her name onto the tablet and pulls up her information. </p><p>\u201cOkay, Y/N Y/L/N is on the second floor, room 44.\u201d Peter says, expecting the man to thank him and quickly walk away, but instead he stays at the desk. </p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know if I can go up there. I told her I would come but I haven\u2019t seen her since she broke my heart. And now she has cancer.\u201d The man trails off. Peter senses the man\u2019s worry and he decides to help this man. </p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright Derek. How \u2018bout I walk you up there, make sure you don\u2019t run away or anything.\u201d Peter offers. Derek nods, but still stays planted to a tile on the floor. Peter moves around the desk and places a hand on Derek\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Peter urges. Finally Derek moves. </p><hr><p>The door to Y/N\u2019s room rattles with a knock before being pushed open. Peter walks in with Derek following behind him. </p><p>\u201cHey you.\u201d Peter says, instantly realizing that his hunch was correct. So the vomiting was because of cancer. He stays quiet, knowing that Y/N is staring Derek behind him. </p><p>\u201cHey Peter, could we, uh, have a minute?\u201d Y/N asks motioning to Derek.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Peter smiles backing out of the room. Derek slowly moves to the seat next to the bed and lowers himself onto it. </p><p>\u201cAre you here alone?\u201d Derek asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, uh, Sarah\u2019s been here with me, since we ya know.\u201d Y/N whispers.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that&rsquo;s good.\u201d Derek says, but his mind is running almost too fast to think of anything to say.</p><p>\u201cDerek, I want to get back together, I miss you. And look at what\u2019s happened since we broke up. I got cancer and I don&rsquo;t think I can do this without you.\u201d Y/N says, and it cuts through Derek like a blade. </p><p>\u201cWe want different things Y/N. We broke up for a reason and I understand you are going through a tough time, but we can not get back together. And this might make me sound like a complete dick but if you want to get back together, I can\u2019t be around you.\u201d Derek says standing up. </p><p>Y/N eyes water and she feels as if a weight has been lifted off her shoulders. </p><p>\u201cOkay, You should probably go then.\u201d Y/N says, holding in her tears. Derek moves towards the door and grasps the handle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Y/N.\u201d Derek says before leaving the room, and Y/N\u2019s life. Her watery eyes sting and the corners of her mouth seem to be stuck in a permanent frown. She slowly pulls herself out of bed and begins pacing the small room. Her I.V. drip is being pulled by the stuck arm as her socked feet shuffle along. Quickly the room becomes too small and she opens the door and peeks into the hallway. </p><p>The air in the hallway is the same to the air in her small room, hot and stuffy. She needs to get out. The air outside would definitely be better than this suffocating air. Her feet carry her to an elevator, to which she pushes the button for the roof. She silently is thankful for the slight luck of coming to a hospital with easy roof access. Nobody else is in the elevator with her, which she is also thankful for. The slow ride to the roof makes Y/N think about why exactly she picked the roof over the ground, the thought makes Y/N\u2019s eyes water again. The elevator dings and the doors open on a small rooftop. </p><p>The area is empty, besides a small picnic table and a few potted plants. She walks over to the table and sits down. Her tears finally begin to fall at thought of Derek and her grim life expectancy. The panic and anxiety forms a pit in her stomach, almost like a sibling to the cancer, eating away at her until she\u2019s nothing. </p><p>Soon, the bench becomes to confining, so she stands abruptly, knocking the bench over.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d The profanity flows from her mouth quietly while she attempts to shuffle her way towards the ledge of the building. The IV pulling on her arm is not helping the dangerous thoughts, so she pulls the needle out of her arm with a short yelp. </p><p>Finally free from the confines of the IV and table, she slowly walks toward the edge of the building. Sitting on the ledge of the building with her legs hanging off, she weighs her options.</p><p>Jump and die.</p><p>Cancer and die.</p><p>Or stay, go through treatment, possibly live. </p><p>Salty tears flow from her eyes, leaving streaks down her cheeks. The body-shaking sobs that are pulled from her body make it hard to breathe and the mucus dripping from her nose is left dripping into her mouth and down to her chin a bit. </p><p>She knows she needs to calm down. She knows that for sure. She attempts deep breaths until her breathing calms to a slower pace. She takes the shoulder of her hospital gown and uses it to wipe her face down, trying to hide the tear streaks enough to walk back down to her room.</p><hr><p>\u201cPeter I can\u2019t believe you got three sandwiches!\u201d MJ laughs between bites of her apple. </p><p>\u201cWha, I\u2019m a hungry guy.\u201d Peter says shrugging his shoulders. The elevator doors open onto the rooftop and Peter immediately notices the knocked over bench and the patient-less IV stand. </p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d MJ whispers, before rushing over to the patient sitting on the ledge. Peter and Ned follow close behind her to try and help. </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d MJ says softly as to not scared the patient. The girl whips her head around to see the group of nurse standing behind her. It\u2019s Y/N. </p><p>\u201cY/N, hey. What brings you up here?\u201d Peter asks quietly. Y/N let\u2019s out a wet laugh. Her face is still red from what Peter assumes must be crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not allowed to get some air,\u201d Y/N questions, \u201cbecause ya know, it\u2019s way to hot in that hospital.\u201d Peter nods with a smile. </p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m gonna have to talk with someone about that.\u201d Ned smiles. Y/N swings her legs over, placing them on solid ground and MJ lets out a breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to get air Y/n, you are not allow to take out your IV, and you definitely are not allowed to to sit on the ledge.\u201d MJ states. Y/N\u2019s face falls from a playful smile to a guilty, kicked puppy type look.</p><p>\u201cSorry, won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Y/N solemnly whispers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d </p><p>Peter helps Y/N stand up and moves her towards the abandoned IV stand. Ned grabs the stand, MJ grabs the food, and the group gets back into the elevator. The ride down is silent. Peter knows what Y/N was doing up there, and is terrified at the thought of what may have happened if he hadn\u2019t insisted that they ate lunch on the roof. He knows about her cancer diagnosis, but he did not know about the ex-boyfriend, or apparently the depression. </p><p>Once back in her room, MJ replaces the IV bag, but this time Y/N doesn\u2019t yell and cry through it, instead she clamps her eyes shut until the needle is in. Ned sits down on the windowsill and unwraps his lunch. Peter open one of his sandwiches and begins to munch down.</p><p>\u201cSure, make yourselves at home.\u201d Y/N grits as MJ wraps her arm in a bandage, to keep the IV in. </p><p>\u201cSorry, we can leave if you want, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Ned starts.</p><p>\u201cNo, stay. I need the company anyways.\u201d </p><p>MJ finishes getting Y/N back into the bed, then sits next to Ned on the windowsill. That leaves the seat next to the bed for Peter, which he takes hesitantly. </p><p>\u201cY/N, if you ever want to talk, I- uh, we are here for you. Whether as a friend or as a nurse. I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d Peter says. Y/N looks at Peter with an expression he can\u2019t exactly place. Disgust? Appreciation? He couldn\u2019t tell. </p><p>\u201cWell thanks, but I don\u2019t want pity, especially from some people I don\u2019t even know.\u201d Y/N whispers. </p><p>\u201cWell we can change that, tell me about yourself!\u201d Ned smiles. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you guys want to know me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just want to open your support pool. Cancer is a lot to deal with, and I know you have your friend that came with you, but you need people to lean on.\u201d Peter rambles. </p><p>\u201cI never told you about my cancer?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell your in the oncology ward, and Derek mentioned it when I brought him up here.\u201d Y/N rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course he did.\u201d Y/N groans. </p><p>A nurse walks in with a tray of food and places it down on the tray with a smile. Y/N returns the smile and thanks her. Once the nurse is gone Y/N takes one look at the food on the tray and nearly gags.</p><p>\u201cAlright, here\u2019s the deal, you guys can come eat your lunch in here everyday, as long as you bring me some real food instead of this.\u201d Y/N says gesturing to the tray in front of her. Peter smiles.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d MJ and Ned say simultaneously. Peter hands one of his sandwiches to Y/N who smiles and accepts it. </p><p>\u201cSo, anyone watch Supernatural?\u201d Y/N asks, trying to spur a conversation. MJ perks up.</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d </p><p>The group falls into easy conversation until Sarah returns, then continues with the help of another fan. </p><p>Tag List:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUkEFgAFhXeXKJJSUj_9itg\">@xxxxdelenaxxxx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maoNI5tc3Ew1bKc2SgkAt3A\">@dashlilymark</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0VoOa78m1HigQjWbIA2nWA\">@itsteatimelovely</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk5n6kms3d9Mxa1XceHE7Mw\">@starkillazz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/me10PdiJMxuf24ovAABXOKw\">@sarahsassafras13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0YlrOK0iRymfnt2nZG0fsw\">@brokenuntilapril26th2019</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a><br/></p>",

A tumor?</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Y/N chokes out. Sarah covers her mouth with her hand, attempting to stop her crying. </p><p>\u201cIt seems that a tumor has grown in your stomach. That was shown in the MRI we took as you can see here,\u201d Dr. Barton hands a tablet over with a black and white picture that she doesn\u2019t really understand. \u201cWe know its cancer because of the blood test we took earlier.\u201d </p><p>Y/N sits still for a second, letting the words Dr. Barton said sink in. Insurmountable fear courses through her veins and she feels the hair on her body prickle. </p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to die?\u201d Y/N asks. The hand that was pressed over Sarah\u2019s mouth drops and the sobs that were once under control now fill the room with noise. </p><p>\u201cWe are going to do everything in our power to keep that from happening Y/N. Your treatment plan is going to start as soon as possible.\u201d Dr. Barton insists. Y/N nods. </p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not going to die, I\u2019m just going to wish I was dead.\u201d Y/N mutters and sinks further into the bed. Lucky for her, Dr. Barton and Sarah didn\u2019t hear her depressing comment. </p><p>\u201cOkay, if you have any questions, just call for a nurse to get me.\u201d Dr. Barton says before leaving the room. The loud sound of the door closing seems to shake Sarah out of her sorrow. She looks up at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Sarah says softly. Y/N just rolls her eyes. </p><p>\u201cMaybe, it\u2019s time to call your dad?\u201d Sarah says pulling out Y/N\u2019s phone. </p><p>\u201cUh- yeah, I think you might be right. I\u2019ll do it. He\u2019ll want to hear it from me.\u201d Y/N rushes out.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I guess since we\u2019re going to be here for a while, I\u2019ll go pick up some stuff. Make this room feel more comfortable. Are you good to be alone for a few hours?\u201d Sarah asks. Y/N nods and takes her phone from Sarah. </p><p>Once she\u2019s alone, she opens up her dads contact. The smiling contact picture stares back at her. Who was she make him upset and ruin that happy smile? She exits his contact and and clicks on Derek\u2019s. The phone rings a few time before Derek picks up.</p><p>\u201cHello, who is this?\u201d Derek says. He had already deleted her number, that stung.</p><p>\u201cUh- it\u2019s Y/N.\u201d She chokes out. Derek sighs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He whispers. Sounds like he\u2019s moving around.</p><p>\u201cDerek, I\u2019m in trouble. I-I need help.\u201d Y/N whimpers. </p><p>\u201cY/N, seriously, what\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the hospital. I, I have cancer, in my stomach, they said gastric an-and,\u201d Y/N cries. Derek audibly gasps, cutting her off.</p><p>\u201cY/N. I\u2019m so sorry. What hospital are you at?\u201d Derek yells.</p><p>\u201cMercy Grace. Derek I\u2019m so sorry. You really don\u2019t have to come. I just wanted you to know, ya know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be there in a few.\u201d Derek says, and she can hear his car door open then slam shut. The call then ends. </p><hr><p>The ER is slow today. Peter assumes it\u2019s due to it being a weekday, with all the kids in school. MJ and Ned are standing at the front desk, waiting for anyone to come in. He almost drags his body over to the desk.</p><p>\u201cI need sleep.\u201d Peter whines, throwing his upper half over the hard surface. MJ lets out a laugh, but it\u2019s more of a deep exhale. </p><p>\u201cYou, kind sir, are preaching to the choir.\u201d MJ smiles.</p><p>\u201cYeah well, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Ned shrugs. Peter raises his head and glares at Ned. </p><p>\u201cOh, can we please go to the roof today for lunch? It\u2019s so nice out and I could use some fresh air to wake me up.\u201d Peter suggests.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m down.\u201d MJ says pulling out a chart and scribbling something down.</p><p>\u201cSure, it\u2019s not like I have anything better to do.\u201d Ned chuckles. </p><p>The door to the emergency room pushes open and a man rushes through. The gang quickly perks up, ready to help when the man comes over to a table.</p><p>\u201cI-I know the emergency room is for emergencies only, but there\u2019s no parking near the main entrance, and I really need to see my gir- uh, ex-girlfriend.\u201d The man quickly rambles. </p><p>\u201cOkay, I need her name.\u201d Peter says, helping the man, which causes Ned and MJ to move away to check on patients.</p><p>\u201cUh, Y/N Y/L/N, she said she has cancer.\u201d The man says. Y/N Y/L/N, Peter quickly wonders if that was the girl he helped with the needles, but pushes the thought aside. He types her name onto the tablet and pulls up her information. </p><p>\u201cOkay, Y/N Y/L/N is on the second floor, room 44.\u201d Peter says, expecting the man to thank him and quickly walk away, but instead he stays at the desk. </p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know if I can go up there. I told her I would come but I haven\u2019t seen her since she broke my heart. And now she has cancer.\u201d The man trails off. Peter senses the man\u2019s worry and he decides to help this man. </p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright Derek. How \u2018bout I walk you up there, make sure you don\u2019t run away or anything.\u201d Peter offers. Derek nods, but still stays planted to a tile on the floor. Peter moves around the desk and places a hand on Derek\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Peter urges. Finally Derek moves. </p><hr><p>The door to Y/N\u2019s room rattles with a knock before being pushed open.

Derek slowly moves to the seat next to the bed and lowers himself onto it. </p><p>\u201cAre you here alone?\u201d Derek asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, uh, Sarah\u2019s been here with me, since we ya know.\u201d Y/N whispers.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s good.\u201d Derek says, but his mind is running almost too fast to think of anything to say.</p><p>\u201cDerek, I want to get back together, I miss you. And look at what\u2019s happened since we broke up. I got cancer and I don\u2019t think I can do this without you.\u201d Y/N says, and it cuts through Derek like a blade. </p><p>\u201cWe want different things Y/N. We broke up for a reason and I understand you are going through a tough time, but we can not get back together. And this might make me sound like a complete dick but if you want to get back together, I can\u2019t be around you.\u201d Derek says standing up. </p><p>Y/N eyes water and she feels as if a weight has been lifted off her shoulders. </p><p>\u201cOkay, You should probably go then.\u201d Y/N says, holding in her tears. Derek moves towards the door and grasps the handle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Y/N.\u201d Derek says before leaving the room, and Y/N\u2019s life.

Her face is still red from what Peter assumes must be crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not allowed to get some air,\u201d Y/N questions, \u201cbecause ya know, it\u2019s way to hot in that hospital.\u201d Peter nods with a smile. </p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m gonna have to talk with someone about that.\u201d Ned smiles. Y/N swings her legs over, placing them on solid ground and MJ lets out a breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to get air Y/n, you are not allow to take out your IV, and you definitely are not allowed to to sit on the ledge.\u201d MJ states. Y/N\u2019s face falls from a playful smile to a guilty, kicked puppy type look.</p><p>\u201cSorry, won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Y/N solemnly whispers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d </p><p>Peter helps Y/N stand up and moves her towards the abandoned IV stand. Ned grabs the stand, MJ grabs the food, and the group gets back into the elevator. The ride down is silent. Peter knows what Y/N was doing up there, and is terrified at the thought of what may have happened if he hadn\u2019t insisted that they ate lunch on the roof. He knows about her cancer diagnosis, but he did not know about the ex-boyfriend, or apparently the depression. </p><p>Once back in her room, MJ replaces the IV bag, but this time Y/N doesn\u2019t yell and cry through it, instead she clamps her eyes shut until the needle is in. Ned sits down on the windowsill and unwraps his lunch. Peter open one of his sandwiches and begins to munch down.</p><p>\u201cSure, make yourselves at home.\u201d Y/N grits as MJ wraps her arm in a bandage, to keep the IV in. </p><p>\u201cSorry, we can leave if you want, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Ned starts.</p><p>\u201cNo, stay. I need the company anyways.\u201d </p><p>MJ finishes getting Y/N back into the bed, then sits next to Ned on the windowsill. That leaves the seat next to the bed for Peter, which he takes hesitantly. </p><p>\u201cY/N, if you ever want to talk, I- uh, we are here for you. Whether as a friend or as a nurse. I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d Peter says. Y/N looks at Peter with an expression he can\u2019t exactly place. Disgust? Appreciation? He couldn\u2019t tell. </p><p>\u201cWell thanks, but I don\u2019t want pity, especially from some people I don\u2019t even know.\u201d Y/N whispers. </p><p>\u201cWell we can change that, tell me about yourself!\u201d Ned smiles. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you guys want to know me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just want to open your support pool. Cancer is a lot to deal with, and I know you have your friend that came with you, but you need people to lean on.\u201d Peter rambles. </p><p>\u201cI never told you about my cancer?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell your in the oncology ward, and Derek mentioned it when I brought him up here.\u201d Y/N rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course he did.\u201d Y/N groans. </p><p>A nurse walks in with a tray of food and places it down on the tray with a smile. Y/N returns the smile and thanks her. Once the nurse is gone Y/N takes one look at the food on the tray and nearly gags.</p><p>\u201cAlright, here\u2019s the deal, you guys can come eat your lunch in here everyday, as long as you bring me some real food instead of this.\u201d Y/N says gesturing to the tray in front of her. Peter smiles.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d MJ and Ned say simultaneously. Peter hands one of his sandwiches to Y/N who smiles and accepts it. </p><p>\u201cSo, anyone watch Supernatural?\u201d Y/N asks, trying to spur a conversation. MJ perks up.</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d </p><p>The group falls into easy conversation until Sarah returns, then continues with the help of another fan. </p><p>Tag List:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUkEFgAFhXeXKJJSUj_9itg\">@xxxxdelenaxxxx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maoNI5tc3Ew1bKc2SgkAt3A\">@dashlilymark</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0VoOa78m1HigQjWbIA2nWA\">@itsteatimelovely</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk5n6kms3d9Mxa1XceHE7Mw\">@starkillazz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/me10PdiJMxuf24ovAABXOKw\">@sarahsassafras13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0YlrOK0iRymfnt2nZG0fsw\">@brokenuntilapril26th2019</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a><br></p>",

Y/N turns her head and and sees her friend with fat tears rolling down her cheeks. Tears for Y/N.</p><p>The silence is replaced with a dull ringing noise deep within her brain.</p><p>Cancer? A tumor?</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Y/N chokes out. Sarah covers her mouth with her hand, attempting to stop her crying. </p><p>\u201cIt seems that a tumor has grown in your stomach. That was shown in the MRI we took as you can see here,\u201d Dr. Barton hands a tablet over with a black and white picture that she doesn\u2019t really understand. \u201cWe know its cancer because of the blood test we took earlier.\u201d </p><p>Y/N sits still for a second, letting the words Dr. Barton said sink in. Insurmountable fear courses through her veins and she feels the hair on her body prickle. </p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to die?\u201d Y/N asks. The hand that was pressed over Sarah\u2019s mouth drops and the sobs that were once under control now fill the room with noise. </p><p>\u201cWe are going to do everything in our power to keep that from happening Y/N. Your treatment plan is going to start as soon as possible.\u201d Dr. Barton insists. Y/N nods. </p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not going to die, I\u2019m just going to wish I was dead.\u201d Y/N mutters and sinks further into the bed. Lucky for her, Dr. Barton and Sarah didn\u2019t hear her depressing comment. </p><p>\u201cOkay, if you have any questions, just call for a nurse to get me.\u201d Dr. Barton says before leaving the room. The loud sound of the door closing seems to shake Sarah out of her sorrow. She looks up at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Sarah says softly. Y/N just rolls her eyes. </p><p>\u201cMaybe, it\u2019s time to call your dad?\u201d Sarah says pulling out Y/N\u2019s phone. </p><p>\u201cUh- yeah, I think you might be right. I\u2019ll do it. He\u2019ll want to hear it from me.\u201d Y/N rushes out.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I guess since we\u2019re going to be here for a while, I\u2019ll go pick up some stuff. Make this room feel more comfortable. Are you good to be alone for a few hours?\u201d Sarah asks. Y/N nods and takes her phone from Sarah. </p><p>Once she\u2019s alone, she opens up her dads contact. The smiling contact picture stares back at her. Who was she make him upset and ruin that happy smile? She exits his contact and and clicks on Derek\u2019s. The phone rings a few time before Derek picks up.</p><p>\u201cHello, who is this?\u201d Derek says. He had already deleted her number, that stung.</p><p>\u201cUh- it\u2019s Y/N.\u201d She chokes out. Derek sighs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He whispers. Sounds like he\u2019s moving around.</p><p>\u201cDerek, I\u2019m in trouble. I-I need help.\u201d Y/N whimpers. </p><p>\u201cY/N, seriously, what\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the hospital. I, I have cancer, in my stomach, they said gastric an-and,\u201d Y/N cries. Derek audibly gasps, cutting her off.</p><p>\u201cY/N. I\u2019m so sorry. What hospital are you at?\u201d Derek yells.</p><p>\u201cMercy Grace. Derek I\u2019m so sorry. You really don\u2019t have to come. I just wanted you to know, ya know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be there in a few.\u201d Derek says, and she can hear his car door open then slam shut. The call then ends. </p><hr><p>The ER is slow today. Peter assumes it\u2019s due to it being a weekday, with all the kids in school. MJ and Ned are standing at the front desk, waiting for anyone to come in. He almost drags his body over to the desk.</p><p>\u201cI need sleep.\u201d Peter whines, throwing his upper half over the hard surface. MJ lets out a laugh, but it\u2019s more of a deep exhale. </p><p>\u201cYou, kind sir, are preaching to the choir.\u201d MJ smiles.</p><p>\u201cYeah well, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Ned shrugs. Peter raises his head and glares at Ned. </p><p>\u201cOh, can we please go to the roof today for lunch? It\u2019s so nice out and I could use some fresh air to wake me up.\u201d Peter suggests.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m down.\u201d MJ says pulling out a chart and scribbling something down.</p><p>\u201cSure, it\u2019s not like I have anything better to do.\u201d Ned chuckles. </p><p>The door to the emergency room pushes open and a man rushes through. The gang quickly perks up, ready to help when the man comes over to a table.</p><p>\u201cI-I know the emergency room is for emergencies only, but there\u2019s no parking near the main entrance, and I really need to see my gir- uh, ex-girlfriend.\u201d The man quickly rambles. </p><p>\u201cOkay, I need her name.\u201d Peter says, helping the man, which causes Ned and MJ to move away to check on patients.</p><p>\u201cUh, Y/N Y/L/N, she said she has cancer.\u201d The man says. Y/N Y/L/N, Peter quickly wonders if that was the girl he helped with the needles, but pushes the thought aside. He types her name onto the tablet and pulls up her information. </p><p>\u201cOkay, Y/N Y/L/N is on the second floor, room 44.\u201d Peter says, expecting the man to thank him and quickly walk away, but instead he stays at the desk. </p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know if I can go up there. I told her I would come but I haven\u2019t seen her since she broke my heart. And now she has cancer.\u201d The man trails off. Peter senses the man\u2019s worry and he decides to help this man. </p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright Derek. How \u2018bout I walk you up there, make sure you don\u2019t run away or anything.\u201d Peter offers. Derek nods, but still stays planted to a tile on the floor. Peter moves around the desk and places a hand on Derek\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Peter urges. Finally Derek moves. </p><hr><p>The door to Y/N\u2019s room rattles with a knock before being pushed open. Peter walks in with Derek following behind him. </p><p>\u201cHey you.\u201d Peter says, instantly realizing that his hunch was correct. So the vomiting was because of cancer. He stays quiet, knowing that Y/N is staring Derek behind him. </p><p>\u201cHey Peter, could we, uh, have a minute?\u201d Y/N asks motioning to Derek.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Peter smiles backing out of the room. Derek slowly moves to the seat next to the bed and lowers himself onto it. </p><p>\u201cAre you here alone?\u201d Derek asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, uh, Sarah\u2019s been here with me, since we ya know.\u201d Y/N whispers.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s good.\u201d Derek says, but his mind is running almost too fast to think of anything to say.</p><p>\u201cDerek, I want to get back together, I miss you. And look at what\u2019s happened since we broke up. I got cancer and I don\u2019t think I can do this without you.\u201d Y/N says, and it cuts through Derek like a blade. </p><p>\u201cWe want different things Y/N. We broke up for a reason and I understand you are going through a tough time, but we can not get back together. And this might make me sound like a complete dick but if you want to get back together, I can\u2019t be around you.\u201d Derek says standing up. </p><p>Y/N eyes water and she feels as if a weight has been lifted off her shoulders. </p><p>\u201cOkay, You should probably go then.\u201d Y/N says, holding in her tears. Derek moves towards the door and grasps the handle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Y/N.\u201d Derek says before leaving the room, and Y/N\u2019s life. Her watery eyes sting and the corners of her mouth seem to be stuck in a permanent frown. She slowly pulls herself out of bed and begins pacing the small room. Her I.V. drip is being pulled by the stuck arm as her socked feet shuffle along. Quickly the room becomes too small and she opens the door and peeks into the hallway. </p><p>The air in the hallway is the same to the air in her small room, hot and stuffy. She needs to get out. The air outside would definitely be better than this suffocating air. Her feet carry her to an elevator, to which she pushes the button for the roof. She silently is thankful for the slight luck of coming to a hospital with easy roof access. Nobody else is in the elevator with her, which she is also thankful for. The slow ride to the roof makes Y/N think about why exactly she picked the roof over the ground, the thought makes Y/N\u2019s eyes water again. The elevator dings and the doors open on a small rooftop. </p><p>The area is empty, besides a small picnic table and a few potted plants. She walks over to the table and sits down. Her tears finally begin to fall at thought of Derek and her grim life expectancy. The panic and anxiety forms a pit in her stomach, almost like a sibling to the cancer, eating away at her until she\u2019s nothing. </p><p>Soon, the bench becomes to confining, so she stands abruptly, knocking the bench over.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d The profanity flows from her mouth quietly while she attempts to shuffle her way towards the ledge of the building. The IV pulling on her arm is not helping the dangerous thoughts, so she pulls the needle out of her arm with a short yelp. </p><p>Finally free from the confines of the IV and table, she slowly walks toward the edge of the building. Sitting on the ledge of the building with her legs hanging off, she weighs her options.</p><p>Jump and die.</p><p>Cancer and die.</p><p>Or stay, go through treatment, possibly live. </p><p>Salty tears flow from her eyes, leaving streaks down her cheeks. The body-shaking sobs that are pulled from her body make it hard to breathe and the mucus dripping from her nose is left dripping into her mouth and down to her chin a bit. </p><p>She knows she needs to calm down. She knows that for sure. She attempts deep breaths until her breathing calms to a slower pace. She takes the shoulder of her hospital gown and uses it to wipe her face down, trying to hide the tear streaks enough to walk back down to her room.</p><hr><p>\u201cPeter I can\u2019t believe you got three sandwiches!\u201d MJ laughs between bites of her apple. </p><p>\u201cWha, I\u2019m a hungry guy.\u201d Peter says shrugging his shoulders. The elevator doors open onto the rooftop and Peter immediately notices the knocked over bench and the patient-less IV stand. </p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d MJ whispers, before rushing over to the patient sitting on the ledge. Peter and Ned follow close behind her to try and help. </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d MJ says softly as to not scared the patient. The girl whips her head around to see the group of nurse standing behind her. It\u2019s Y/N. </p><p>\u201cY/N, hey. What brings you up here?\u201d Peter asks quietly. Y/N let\u2019s out a wet laugh. Her face is still red from what Peter assumes must be crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not allowed to get some air,\u201d Y/N questions, \u201cbecause ya know, it\u2019s way to hot in that hospital.\u201d Peter nods with a smile. </p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m gonna have to talk with someone about that.\u201d Ned smiles. Y/N swings her legs over, placing them on solid ground and MJ lets out a breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to get air Y/n, you are not allow to take out your IV, and you definitely are not allowed to to sit on the ledge.\u201d MJ states. Y/N\u2019s face falls from a playful smile to a guilty, kicked puppy type look.</p><p>\u201cSorry, won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Y/N solemnly whispers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d </p><p>Peter helps Y/N stand up and moves her towards the abandoned IV stand. Ned grabs the stand, MJ grabs the food, and the group gets back into the elevator. The ride down is silent. Peter knows what Y/N was doing up there, and is terrified at the thought of what may have happened if he hadn\u2019t insisted that they ate lunch on the roof. He knows about her cancer diagnosis, but he did not know about the ex-boyfriend, or apparently the depression. </p><p>Once back in her room, MJ replaces the IV bag, but this time Y/N doesn\u2019t yell and cry through it, instead she clamps her eyes shut until the needle is in. Ned sits down on the windowsill and unwraps his lunch. Peter open one of his sandwiches and begins to munch down.</p><p>\u201cSure, make yourselves at home.\u201d Y/N grits as MJ wraps her arm in a bandage, to keep the IV in. </p><p>\u201cSorry, we can leave if you want, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Ned starts.</p><p>\u201cNo, stay. I need the company anyways.\u201d </p><p>MJ finishes getting Y/N back into the bed, then sits next to Ned on the windowsill. That leaves the seat next to the bed for Peter, which he takes hesitantly. </p><p>\u201cY/N, if you ever want to talk, I- uh, we are here for you. Whether as a friend or as a nurse. I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d Peter says. Y/N looks at Peter with an expression he can\u2019t exactly place. Disgust? Appreciation? He couldn\u2019t tell. </p><p>\u201cWell thanks, but I don\u2019t want pity, especially from some people I don\u2019t even know.\u201d Y/N whispers. </p><p>\u201cWell we can change that, tell me about yourself!\u201d Ned smiles. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you guys want to know me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just want to open your support pool. Cancer is a lot to deal with, and I know you have your friend that came with you, but you need people to lean on.\u201d Peter rambles. </p><p>\u201cI never told you about my cancer?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell your in the oncology ward, and Derek mentioned it when I brought him up here.\u201d Y/N rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course he did.\u201d Y/N groans. </p><p>A nurse walks in with a tray of food and places it down on the tray with a smile. Y/N returns the smile and thanks her. Once the nurse is gone Y/N takes one look at the food on the tray and nearly gags.</p><p>\u201cAlright, here\u2019s the deal, you guys can come eat your lunch in here everyday, as long as you bring me some real food instead of this.\u201d Y/N says gesturing to the tray in front of her.

                "content": "<p>&nbsp;Alrightly sorry for such a long wait, but here it is! yay! Let me know if you&rsquo;re enjoying this series! Please. I live off praise. Also, i really suck at tagging, so if you want to be tagged please message me separately. Also, I post this on my AO3 as well, so if you see it anywhere else, thats still me. Thank you so much for reading :)</p><p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCTAqohmHPU-_KW6zq06aHw\">@petey-verse</a> for being the best human ever&nbsp;</p><p>Pairing: Peter Parker x Reader (if you squint)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Warnings: Depression, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, Cancer&nbsp;</p><p>Word Count: 2457</p><hr /><p>Silence. </p><p>Deafening silence.</p><p>Dr. Barton&rsquo;s grim expression, it radiates pity.</p><p>His lips are moving, but she only hears the painful silence. </p><p>Someone grabs her hand; Sarah. Y/N turns her head and and sees her friend with fat tears rolling down her cheeks. Tears for Y/N.</p><p>The silence is replaced with a dull ringing noise deep within her brain.</p><p>Cancer? A tumor?</p><p>&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; Y/N chokes out. Sarah covers her mouth with her hand, attempting to stop her crying. </p><p>&ldquo;It seems that a tumor has grown in your stomach. That was shown in the MRI we took as you can see here,&rdquo; Dr. Barton hands a tablet over with a black and white picture that she doesn&rsquo;t really understand. &ldquo;We know its cancer because of the blood test we took earlier.&rdquo; </p><p>Y/N sits still for a second, letting the words Dr. Barton said sink in. Insurmountable fear courses through her veins and she feels the hair on her body prickle. </p><p>&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m going to die?&rdquo; Y/N asks. The hand that was pressed over Sarah&rsquo;s mouth drops and the sobs that were once under control now fill the room with noise. </p><p>&ldquo;We are going to do everything in our power to keep that from happening Y/N. Your treatment plan is going to start as soon as possible.&rdquo; Dr. Barton insists. Y/N nods. </p><p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m not going to die, I&rsquo;m just going to wish I was dead.&rdquo; Y/N mutters and sinks further into the bed. Lucky for her, Dr. Barton and Sarah didn&rsquo;t hear her depressing comment. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, if you have any questions, just call for a nurse to get me.&rdquo; Dr. Barton says before leaving the room. The loud sound of the door closing seems to shake Sarah out of her sorrow. She looks up at Y/N.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Sarah says softly. Y/N just rolls her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe, it&rsquo;s time to call your dad?&rdquo; Sarah says pulling out Y/N&rsquo;s phone. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh- yeah, I think you might be right. I&rsquo;ll do it. He&rsquo;ll want to hear it from me.&rdquo; Y/N rushes out.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. I guess since we&rsquo;re going to be here for a while, I&rsquo;ll go pick up some stuff. Make this room feel more comfortable. Are you good to be alone for a few hours?&rdquo; Sarah asks. Y/N nods and takes her phone from Sarah. </p><p>Once she&rsquo;s alone, she opens up her dads contact. The smiling contact picture stares back at her. Who was she make him upset and ruin that happy smile? She exits his contact and and clicks on Derek&rsquo;s. The phone rings a few time before Derek picks up.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, who is this?&rdquo; Derek says. He had already deleted her number, that stung.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh- it&rsquo;s Y/N.&rdquo; She chokes out. Derek sighs.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; He whispers. Sounds like he&rsquo;s moving around.</p><p>&ldquo;Derek, I&rsquo;m in trouble. I-I need help.&rdquo; Y/N whimpers. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, seriously, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the hospital. I, I have cancer, in my stomach, they said gastric an-and,&rdquo; Y/N cries. Derek audibly gasps, cutting her off.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N. I&rsquo;m so sorry. What hospital are you at?&rdquo; Derek yells.</p><p>&ldquo;Mercy Grace. Derek I&rsquo;m so sorry. You really don&rsquo;t have to come. I just wanted you to know, ya know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll be there in a few.&rdquo; Derek says, and she can hear his car door open then slam shut. The call then ends. </p><hr /><p>The ER is slow today. Peter assumes it&rsquo;s due to it being a weekday, with all the kids in school. MJ and Ned are standing at the front desk, waiting for anyone to come in. He almost drags his body over to the desk.</p><p>&ldquo;I need sleep.&rdquo; Peter whines, throwing his upper half over the hard surface. MJ lets out a laugh, but it&rsquo;s more of a deep exhale. </p><p>&ldquo;You, kind sir, are preaching to the choir.&rdquo; MJ smiles.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah well, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Ned shrugs. Peter raises his head and glares at Ned. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, can we please go to the roof today for lunch? It&rsquo;s so nice out and I could use some fresh air to wake me up.&rdquo; Peter suggests.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m down.&rdquo; MJ says pulling out a chart and scribbling something down.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s not like I have anything better to do.&rdquo; Ned chuckles. </p><p>The door to the emergency room pushes open and a man rushes through. The gang quickly perks up, ready to help when the man comes over to a table.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I know the emergency room is for emergencies only, but there&rsquo;s no parking near the main entrance, and I really need to see my gir- uh, ex-girlfriend.&rdquo; The man quickly rambles. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I need her name.&rdquo; Peter says, helping the man, which causes Ned and MJ to move away to check on patients.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, Y/N Y/L/N, she said she has cancer.&rdquo; The man says. Y/N Y/L/N, Peter quickly wonders if that was the girl he helped with the needles, but pushes the thought aside. He types her name onto the tablet and pulls up her information. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Y/N Y/L/N is on the second floor, room 44.&rdquo; Peter says, expecting the man to thank him and quickly walk away, but instead he stays at the desk. </p><p>&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know if I can go up there. I told her I would come but I haven&rsquo;t seen her since she broke my heart. And now she has cancer.&rdquo; The man trails off. Peter senses the man&rsquo;s worry and he decides to help this man. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Derek.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright Derek. How &lsquo;bout I walk you up there, make sure you don&rsquo;t run away or anything.&rdquo; Peter offers. Derek nods, but still stays planted to a tile on the floor. Peter moves around the desk and places a hand on Derek&rsquo;s back.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Peter urges. Finally Derek moves. </p><hr /><p>The door to Y/N&rsquo;s room rattles with a knock before being pushed open. Peter walks in with Derek following behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey you.&rdquo; Peter says, instantly realizing that his hunch was correct. So the vomiting was because of cancer. He stays quiet, knowing that Y/N is staring Derek behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Peter, could we, uh, have a minute?&rdquo; Y/N asks motioning to Derek.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Peter smiles backing out of the room. Derek slowly moves to the seat next to the bed and lowers himself onto it. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you here alone?&rdquo; Derek asks.</p><p>&ldquo;No, uh, Sarah&rsquo;s been here with me, since we ya know.&rdquo; Y/N whispers.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Derek says, but his mind is running almost too fast to think of anything to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Derek, I want to get back together, I miss you. And look at what&rsquo;s happened since we broke up. I got cancer and I don&rsquo;t think I can do this without you.&rdquo; Y/N says, and it cuts through Derek like a blade. </p><p>&ldquo;We want different things Y/N. We broke up for a reason and I understand you are going through a tough time, but we can not get back together. And this might make me sound like a complete dick but if you want to get back together, I can&rsquo;t be around you.&rdquo; Derek says standing up. </p><p>Y/N eyes water and she feels as if a weight has been lifted off her shoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, You should probably go then.&rdquo; Y/N says, holding in her tears. Derek moves towards the door and grasps the handle.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Y/N.&rdquo; Derek says before leaving the room, and Y/N&rsquo;s life. Her watery eyes sting and the corners of her mouth seem to be stuck in a permanent frown. She slowly pulls herself out of bed and begins pacing the small room. Her I.V. drip is being pulled by the stuck arm as her socked feet shuffle along. Quickly the room becomes too small and she opens the door and peeks into the hallway. </p><p>The air in the hallway is the same to the air in her small room, hot and stuffy. She needs to get out. The air outside would definitely be better than this suffocating air. Her feet carry her to an elevator, to which she pushes the button for the roof. She silently is thankful for the slight luck of coming to a hospital with easy roof access. Nobody else is in the elevator with her, which she is also thankful for. The slow ride to the roof makes Y/N think about why exactly she picked the roof over the ground, the thought makes Y/N&rsquo;s eyes water again. The elevator dings and the doors open on a small rooftop. </p><p>The area is empty, besides a small picnic table and a few potted plants. She walks over to the table and sits down. Her tears finally begin to fall at thought of Derek and her grim life expectancy. The panic and anxiety forms a pit in her stomach, almost like a sibling to the cancer, eating away at her until she&rsquo;s nothing. </p><p>Soon, the bench becomes to confining, so she stands abruptly, knocking the bench over.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; The profanity flows from her mouth quietly while she attempts to shuffle her way towards the ledge of the building. The IV pulling on her arm is not helping the dangerous thoughts, so she pulls the needle out of her arm with a short yelp. </p><p>Finally free from the confines of the IV and table, she slowly walks toward the edge of the building. Sitting on the ledge of the building with her legs hanging off, she weighs her options.</p><p>Jump and die.</p><p>Cancer and die.</p><p>Or stay, go through treatment, possibly live. </p><p>Salty tears flow from her eyes, leaving streaks down her cheeks. The body-shaking sobs that are pulled from her body make it hard to breathe and the mucus dripping from her nose is left dripping into her mouth and down to her chin a bit. </p><p>She knows she needs to calm down. She knows that for sure. She attempts deep breaths until her breathing calms to a slower pace. She takes the shoulder of her hospital gown and uses it to wipe her face down, trying to hide the tear streaks enough to walk back down to her room.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Peter I can&rsquo;t believe you got three sandwiches!&rdquo; MJ laughs between bites of her apple. </p><p>&ldquo;Wha, I&rsquo;m a hungry guy.&rdquo; Peter says shrugging his shoulders. The elevator doors open onto the rooftop and Peter immediately notices the knocked over bench and the patient-less IV stand. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God.&rdquo; MJ whispers, before rushing over to the patient sitting on the ledge. Peter and Ned follow close behind her to try and help. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; MJ says softly as to not scared the patient. The girl whips her head around to see the group of nurse standing behind her. It&rsquo;s Y/N. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, hey. What brings you up here?&rdquo; Peter asks quietly. Y/N let&rsquo;s out a wet laugh. Her face is still red from what Peter assumes must be crying.</p><p>&ldquo;What? I&rsquo;m not allowed to get some air,&rdquo; Y/N questions, &ldquo;because ya know, it&rsquo;s way to hot in that hospital.&rdquo; Peter nods with a smile. </p><p>&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m gonna have to talk with someone about that.&rdquo; Ned smiles. Y/N swings her legs over, placing them on solid ground and MJ lets out a breath.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re allowed to get air Y/n, you are not allow to take out your IV, and you definitely are not allowed to to sit on the ledge.&rdquo; MJ states. Y/N&rsquo;s face falls from a playful smile to a guilty, kicked puppy type look.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; Y/N solemnly whispers.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter helps Y/N stand up and moves her towards the abandoned IV stand. Ned grabs the stand, MJ grabs the food, and the group gets back into the elevator. The ride down is silent. Peter knows what Y/N was doing up there, and is terrified at the thought of what may have happened if he hadn&rsquo;t insisted that they ate lunch on the roof. He knows about her cancer diagnosis, but he did not know about the ex-boyfriend, or apparently the depression. </p><p>Once back in her room, MJ replaces the IV bag, but this time Y/N doesn&rsquo;t yell and cry through it, instead she clamps her eyes shut until the needle is in. Ned sits down on the windowsill and unwraps his lunch. Peter open one of his sandwiches and begins to munch down.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, make yourselves at home.&rdquo; Y/N grits as MJ wraps her arm in a bandage, to keep the IV in. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, we can leave if you want, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; Ned starts.</p><p>&ldquo;No, stay. I need the company anyways.&rdquo; </p><p>MJ finishes getting Y/N back into the bed, then sits next to Ned on the windowsill. That leaves the seat next to the bed for Peter, which he takes hesitantly. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, if you ever want to talk, I- uh, we are here for you. Whether as a friend or as a nurse. I&rsquo;ve got your back.&rdquo; Peter says. Y/N looks at Peter with an expression he can&rsquo;t exactly place. Disgust? Appreciation? He couldn&rsquo;t tell. </p><p>&ldquo;Well thanks, but I don&rsquo;t want pity, especially from some people I don&rsquo;t even know.&rdquo; Y/N whispers. </p><p>&ldquo;Well we can change that, tell me about yourself!&rdquo; Ned smiles. </p><p>&ldquo;Why do you guys want to know me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I just want to open your support pool. Cancer is a lot to deal with, and I know you have your friend that came with you, but you need people to lean on.&rdquo; Peter rambles. </p><p>&ldquo;I never told you about my cancer?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well your in the oncology ward, and Derek mentioned it when I brought him up here.&rdquo; Y/N rolls her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course he did.&rdquo; Y/N groans. </p><p>A nurse walks in with a tray of food and places it down on the tray with a smile. Y/N returns the smile and thanks her. Once the nurse is gone Y/N takes one look at the food on the tray and nearly gags.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, here&rsquo;s the deal, you guys can come eat your lunch in here everyday, as long as you bring me some real food instead of this.&rdquo; Y/N says gesturing to the tray in front of her. Peter smiles.</p><p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo; MJ and Ned say simultaneously. Peter hands one of his sandwiches to Y/N who smiles and accepts it. </p><p>&ldquo;So, anyone watch Supernatural?&rdquo; Y/N asks, trying to spur a conversation. MJ perks up.</p><p>&ldquo;I do!&rdquo; </p><p>The group falls into easy conversation until Sarah returns, then continues with the help of another fan. </p><p>Tag List:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUkEFgAFhXeXKJJSUj_9itg\">@xxxxdelenaxxxx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maoNI5tc3Ew1bKc2SgkAt3A\">@dashlilymark</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0VoOa78m1HigQjWbIA2nWA\">@itsteatimelovely</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk5n6kms3d9Mxa1XceHE7Mw\">@starkillazz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me10PdiJMxuf24ovAABXOKw\">@sarahsassafras13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0YlrOK0iRymfnt2nZG0fsw\">@brokenuntilapril26th2019</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a><br /></p>",

It was likely one of the lowest points of his life. Pepper had left him a few weeks ago, and now half of his team was following. Worse yet, he was now resorting to recruiting a teenage kid to help detain what were now being called the Rogue Avengers. He tried to push that all aside as he put on his mask to introduce himself to the kid\u2019s aunt. Not his Iron Mask, as that would likely startle her quite a bit, but his figurative mask that was the persona he took on at press conferences and business meetings, the persona of a cocky, flirtatious, carefree billionaire. After a brief questioning. Mrs. Parker buys his phony story of a grant and soon the boy arrives home and he is allowed to speak with him in private. Seeing the kid in person for the first time, it felt hard to breathe. Years of practice allowed him to hide his panic but he was internally at war with himself, he knew this kid was a 14, but his brain did not truly realize how young that was until his eyes were seeing it. Even his brain, which many considered genius, struggle to consolidate this gangly teen with the graceful vigilante from the videos. Be brought the kid to Germany and told himself that he was helping him by giving him a safer suit, but the guilt came crashing down on him when he saw the boy knocked out by the giant Ant Man, ad felt panic that he refused to admit felt vaguely parental when he did not get back up. Thankfully, Peter seemed to be okay, albeit slightly roughed up.</p><p>In the time that followed Tony\u2019s life just seemed to keep going further and further downhill, starting with Rhodey falling from the sky and Tony being unable to help, to Tony facing what he considered the ultimate betrayal from the Captain he used to call a friend. Returning from the fight, Tony immediately rushed to be with Rhodey while the doctors ran tests. While they awaited results, Tony kept checking for messages from Happy, who he had left Peter with.</p><p>\u201cI can tell your worried about more than just my legs Tones, your waiting for Happy to message you about the Spider Boy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Spiderman\u201d Tony mutters</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point and you know it. How do you know the guy? You haven\u2019t told me anything about him but judging from what I\u2019ve seen, he can\u2019t be older than 25, which places his birth right around the time of your-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fourteen, actually\u201d That manages to put Rhodey into a stunned silence as Tony looks away guilty. After taking a few seconds to process Rhodey whispers</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Tony\u201d after pausing for a few seconds\u00a0\u201cHow could you recruit your teenage son to fight with the Avengers, and how could you have not told me?\u201d</p><p>If Tony had been holding a drink he would have spit it out. Instead the man shook his head, and explained what had happened.</p><p>\u201cDespite your denial, i can tell you care a lot about the kid. Go, check on him. I know you sent Happy to take him home, based on how eager the kid was to please you, I bet he\u2019ll be glad to see you\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhodey I can\u2019t just leave you here alone\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019ll be here when you get back, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna get up and walk away.\u201d Tony laughs for the first time in what feels like weeks, bids his friend good bye and good luck and goes off to check on the spiderling.</p><p>Tony had originally planned to take a hands on approach in mentoring the kid, but upon seeing his eagerness to get involved with the big leagues he decides a more distant approach may be better. Tony already made the mistake of bringing him to an Avengers fight, he wasn\u2019t going to get the kid killed by introducing him to a level of fighting he is to young for. Instead, he has the kid send Happy status reports, but in truth he has them all forwarded to himself. When he spends long days working with politicians to fix the accords, listening to Peter\u2019s voicemail reminds him that there is good in the world. Living alone in the tower was rough, it seemed every corn he turned he could feel the ghosts of the happy memories he and the team had had their. Now, the rooms that once seemed vibrant and full of life faded to a dull gray.</p><p>Over the next few weeks several things happen very quickly. While Tony is away in India Tony has t send a suit to save Peter after he got involved in crime that was a little to advanced for him. Tony briefly thought that the stress he felt for Peter\u2019s safety must be what it\u2019s like to be a father, but he quickly pushed that notion out of his head.\u00a0 Next comes the incident in DC, which Tony only saw a few hours later and he swore that kid was TRYING to give him a heart attack. A few days later, Tony calmed down and realized, despite how stressful it appeared, the kid did a good job. He had just got off the phone from telling him this when he saw Spiderman on the news, and he was most definitely NOT at band practice.\u00a0</p><p>The events that follow happen in a bit of a blur, one second he\u2019s fixing the ferry, the next he\u2019s on top of a building with Peter, taking the suit. He feels awful about it the next day, but he also thinks that he cannot go back</p><p>Of course, then comes moving day, and the plane crash, and Tony decide that maybe he ought to keep the tower after all.</p><p>(Pepper suggests he wants a location to stay close to New York\u00a0 to keep a eye on Peter. Tony will never admit it, but she isn\u2019t wrong)</p><p>After the shocking turn of events that was Peter turning down the offer to join the Avengers, Pepper and Tony were in their kitchen, celebrating their engagement when his phone rings. He does not recognize the phone number calling and he answers in the manner he does all of these calls</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you got this number but don\u2019t even think about cal-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Spider Man\u2019s aunt. You may remember recruiting my kid to fight behind my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>No women could ever scare Tony as much as Pepper, but May Parker came pretty darn close. After she finished thoroughly chewing him out she agreed to allow him to continue under the basis of Tony training him and personally monitoring his patrols (which Tony normally did anyways, not that he\u2019d admit it) and that he give her access to monitor the suit (he sent her a StarkPad that was completely synced with Karen the next day.) After Peter accidentally blew up his school lab making web fluid, she added the condition that he go to Tony\u2019s lab once a week. What started as Peter using the facility to make web fluid, led to Tony teaching the kid all the inner workings of the Spider Man suit to Peter being his personal intern.\u00a0</p><p>(Pepper suggested that it was less like he was his personal intern and more like he was his son, but what does Pepper know?)</p><p>Occasionally they would work so late into the night that Peter would just stay the night. This led to Peter coming to the compound every Friday after school with a duffle bag and then returning to his apartment Sunday afternoon. This definitely was not because they were forming a father son bond (\u201d<i>I swear to God\u00a0 if you call me Iron Dad one more time Rhodey&hellip;</i>.\u201d) It was just convenient. May had the most shifts on weekends and Peter got bored being home alone. Any good mentor would invite him to stay. For an early birthday present, Tony decided to redo the guest room to personalize it for Peter. Pepper suggested he just hire someone to do it, but he brushed her aside. If someone leaked that he was having a room decorated for a teenage boy God only know what kind of rumors would spread. That is why he was sitting on his tablet at 11 PM stressing over what color paint would prefer.</p><p>\u201cJust buy both and ask him which he likes better when he comes over\u201d</p><p>\u201cPep I can\u2019t just&hellip;. actually your right, I\u2019m a billionaire, I\u2019ll get both.\u201d</p><p>That is how, a few days later the billionaire finds himself hand painting a room with a 15 year old boy. Peter returns from the bathroom just to feel paint drip on his face from above. He looks up to see Peter on the ceiling painting the part of the ceiling he couldn\u2019t reach from the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhoops, sorry Mr. Stark\u201d the laughter in his voice told him he wasn\u2019t really sorry. picking up a paintbrush he exclaimed</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you for that little you little twerp\u201d and with tat flung some of the paint at Peter.</p><p>When Pepper went 30 minutes later to see what kind of pizza to order for lunch, she finds them laughing hysterically and covered in paint.</p><p>A week later Tony hosted a surprise birthday for Peter at the tower.\u00a0 He, shockingly enough, kept it small, only inviting Peter\u2019s closest friends, May, Rhodey and Pepper. He and May had spent the past few hours painstakingly setting everything up to be perfect. Tony\u2019s back hurt more than he cared to admit, and part of him was wary the girl, Michelle, who watched him with a far to knowing look. It was all made worth it when he say the look on Peter\u2019s face when they surprised him. When Peter crushed him into a hug his initial reaction was to jerk away, but instead he returned the hug. He wasn\u2019t certain, but he thinks he heard the boy mumble\u00a0\u201cthanks dad\u201d into his shoulder. After a few seconds he released the boy and ruffled his hair.</p><p>\u201cAnytime, son\u201d he said to quietly for anyone to hear. Than, louder, he said\u00a0\u201cEnjoy the party, kiddo\u201d and handed him off to his aunt.</p><p>Now, when Tony walks the halls of the tower, instead of seeing the ghosts of his ex teammates he see\u2019s Peter\u2019s homework strewn across the table, his backpack propped against the couch, his report card that he had jokingly taped on the fridge and often time the curly haired teenager himself, breathing life back into the place.</p><p>One day he realized that the world is no longer all gray.</p><p><b>AN: Thanks for reading, i haven\u2019t actually read back over this, though I might sometime soon.

I\u2019ll be here when you get back, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna get up and walk away.\u201d Tony laughs for the first time in what feels like weeks, bids his friend good bye and good luck and goes off to check on the spiderling.</p><p>Tony had originally planned to take a hands on approach in mentoring the kid, but upon seeing his eagerness to get involved with the big leagues he decides a more distant approach may be better. Tony already made the mistake of bringing him to an Avengers fight, he wasn\u2019t going to get the kid killed by introducing him to a level of fighting he is to young for. Instead, he has the kid send Happy status reports, but in truth he has them all forwarded to himself. When he spends long days working with politicians to fix the accords, listening to Peter\u2019s voicemail reminds him that there is good in the world. Living alone in the tower was rough, it seemed every corn he turned he could feel the ghosts of the happy memories he and the team had had their. Now, the rooms that once seemed vibrant and full of life faded to a dull gray.</p><p>Over the next few weeks several things happen very quickly. While Tony is away in India Tony has t send a suit to save Peter after he got involved in crime that was a little to advanced for him. Tony briefly thought that the stress he felt for Peter\u2019s safety must be what it\u2019s like to be a father, but he quickly pushed that notion out of his head.\u00a0 Next comes the incident in DC, which Tony only saw a few hours later and he swore that kid was TRYING to give him a heart attack. A few days later, Tony calmed down and realized, despite how stressful it appeared, the kid did a good job. He had just got off the phone from telling him this when he saw Spiderman on the news, and he was most definitely NOT at band practice.\u00a0</p><p>The events that follow happen in a bit of a blur, one second he\u2019s fixing the ferry, the next he\u2019s on top of a building with Peter, taking the suit. He feels awful about it the next day, but he also thinks that he cannot go back</p><p>Of course, then comes moving day, and the plane crash, and Tony decide that maybe he ought to keep the tower after all.</p><p>(Pepper suggests he wants a location to stay close to New York\u00a0 to keep a eye on Peter. Tony will never admit it, but she isn\u2019t wrong)</p><p>After the shocking turn of events that was Peter turning down the offer to join the Avengers, Pepper and Tony were in their kitchen, celebrating their engagement when his phone rings. He does not recognize the phone number calling and he answers in the manner he does all of these calls</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you got this number but don\u2019t even think about cal-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Spider Man\u2019s aunt. You may remember recruiting my kid to fight behind my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>No women could ever scare Tony as much as Pepper, but May Parker came pretty darn close. After she finished thoroughly chewing him out she agreed to allow him to continue under the basis of Tony training him and personally monitoring his patrols (which Tony normally did anyways, not that he\u2019d admit it) and that he give her access to monitor the suit (he sent her a StarkPad that was completely synced with Karen the next day.) After Peter accidentally blew up his school lab making web fluid, she added the condition that he go to Tony\u2019s lab once a week. What started as Peter using the facility to make web fluid, led to Tony teaching the kid all the inner workings of the Spider Man suit to Peter being his personal intern.\u00a0</p><p>(Pepper suggested that it was less like he was his personal intern and more like he was his son, but what does Pepper know?)</p><p>Occasionally they would work so late into the night that Peter would just stay the night. This led to Peter coming to the compound every Friday after school with a duffle bag and then returning to his apartment Sunday afternoon. This definitely was not because they were forming a father son bond (\u201d<i>I swear to God\u00a0 if you call me Iron Dad one more time Rhodey\u2026</i>.\u201d) It was just convenient. May had the most shifts on weekends and Peter got bored being home alone. Any good mentor would invite him to stay. For an early birthday present, Tony decided to redo the guest room to personalize it for Peter. Pepper suggested he just hire someone to do it, but he brushed her aside. If someone leaked that he was having a room decorated for a teenage boy God only know what kind of rumors would spread. That is why he was sitting on his tablet at 11 PM stressing over what color paint would prefer.</p><p>\u201cJust buy both and ask him which he likes better when he comes over\u201d</p><p>\u201cPep I can\u2019t just\u2026. actually your right, I\u2019m a billionaire, I\u2019ll get both.\u201d</p><p>That is how, a few days later the billionaire finds himself hand painting a room with a 15 year old boy. Peter returns from the bathroom just to feel paint drip on his face from above. He looks up to see Peter on the ceiling painting the part of the ceiling he couldn\u2019t reach from the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhoops, sorry Mr. Stark\u201d the laughter in his voice told him he wasn\u2019t really sorry. picking up a paintbrush he exclaimed</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you for that little you little twerp\u201d and with tat flung some of the paint at Peter.</p><p>When Pepper went 30 minutes later to see what kind of pizza to order for lunch, she finds them laughing hysterically and covered in paint.</p><p>A week later Tony hosted a surprise birthday for Peter at the tower.\u00a0 He, shockingly enough, kept it small, only inviting Peter\u2019s closest friends, May, Rhodey and Pepper. He and May had spent the past few hours painstakingly setting everything up to be perfect. Tony\u2019s back hurt more than he cared to admit, and part of him was wary the girl, Michelle, who watched him with a far to knowing look. It was all made worth it when he say the look on Peter\u2019s face when they surprised him. When Peter crushed him into a hug his initial reaction was to jerk away, but instead he returned the hug. He wasn\u2019t certain, but he thinks he heard the boy mumble\u00a0\u201cthanks dad\u201d into his shoulder. After a few seconds he released the boy and ruffled his hair.</p><p>\u201cAnytime, son\u201d he said to quietly for anyone to hear. Than, louder, he said\u00a0\u201cEnjoy the party, kiddo\u201d and handed him off to his aunt.</p><p>Now, when Tony walks the halls of the tower, instead of seeing the ghosts of his ex teammates he see\u2019s Peter\u2019s homework strewn across the table, his backpack propped against the couch, his report card that he had jokingly taped on the fridge and often time the curly haired teenager himself, breathing life back into the place.</p><p>One day he realized that the world is no longer all gray.</p><p><b>AN: Thanks for reading, i haven\u2019t actually read back over this, though I might sometime soon.

You may remember recruiting my kid to fight behind my back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Crap.&rdquo;</p><p>No women could ever scare Tony as much as Pepper, but May Parker came pretty darn close. After she finished thoroughly chewing him out she agreed to allow him to continue under the basis of Tony training him and personally monitoring his patrols (which Tony normally did anyways, not that he&rsquo;d admit it) and that he give her access to monitor the suit (he sent her a StarkPad that was completely synced with Karen the next day.) After Peter accidentally blew up his school lab making web fluid, she added the condition that he go to Tony&rsquo;s lab once a week. What started as Peter using the facility to make web fluid, led to Tony teaching the kid all the inner workings of the Spider Man suit to Peter being his personal intern.&nbsp;</p><p>(Pepper suggested that it was less like he was his personal intern and more like he was his son, but what does Pepper know?)</p><p>Occasionally they would work so late into the night that Peter would just stay the night. This led to Peter coming to the compound every Friday after school with a duffle bag and then returning to his apartment Sunday afternoon. This definitely was not because they were forming a father son bond (&rdquo;<i>I swear to God&nbsp; if you call me Iron Dad one more time Rhodey&hellip;</i>.&rdquo;) It was just convenient. May had the most shifts on weekends and Peter got bored being home alone. Any good mentor would invite him to stay. For an early birthday present, Tony decided to redo the guest room to personalize it for Peter. Pepper suggested he just hire someone to do it, but he brushed her aside. If someone leaked that he was having a room decorated for a teenage boy God only know what kind of rumors would spread. That is why he was sitting on his tablet at 11 PM stressing over what color paint would prefer.</p><p>&ldquo;Just buy both and ask him which he likes better when he comes over&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pep I can&rsquo;t just&hellip;. actually your right, I&rsquo;m a billionaire, I&rsquo;ll get both.&rdquo;</p><p>That is how, a few days later the billionaire finds himself hand painting a room with a 15 year old boy. Peter returns from the bathroom just to feel paint drip on his face from above. He looks up to see Peter on the ceiling painting the part of the ceiling he couldn&rsquo;t reach from the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoops, sorry Mr. Stark&rdquo; the laughter in his voice told him he wasn&rsquo;t really sorry. picking up a paintbrush he exclaimed</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you for that little you little twerp&rdquo; and with tat flung some of the paint at Peter.</p><p>When Pepper went 30 minutes later to see what kind of pizza to order for lunch, she finds them laughing hysterically and covered in paint.</p><p>A week later Tony hosted a surprise birthday for Peter at the tower.&nbsp; He, shockingly enough, kept it small, only inviting Peter&rsquo;s closest friends, May, Rhodey and Pepper. He and May had spent the past few hours painstakingly setting everything up to be perfect. Tony&rsquo;s back hurt more than he cared to admit, and part of him was wary the girl, Michelle, who watched him with a far to knowing look. It was all made worth it when he say the look on Peter&rsquo;s face when they surprised him. When Peter crushed him into a hug his initial reaction was to jerk away, but instead he returned the hug. He wasn&rsquo;t certain, but he thinks he heard the boy mumble&nbsp;&ldquo;thanks dad&rdquo; into his shoulder. After a few seconds he released the boy and ruffled his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Anytime, son&rdquo; he said to quietly for anyone to hear. Than, louder, he said&nbsp;&ldquo;Enjoy the party, kiddo&rdquo; and handed him off to his aunt.</p><p>Now, when Tony walks the halls of the tower, instead of seeing the ghosts of his ex teammates he see&rsquo;s Peter&rsquo;s homework strewn across the table, his backpack propped against the couch, his report card that he had jokingly taped on the fridge and often time the curly haired teenager himself, breathing life back into the place.</p><p>One day he realized that the world is no longer all gray.</p><p><b>AN: Thanks for reading, i haven&rsquo;t actually read back over this, though I might sometime soon. Hope you enjoyed!</b></p></p>",
