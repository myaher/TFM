He always made sure you were taken care of and that you were happy. He never would\u2019ve guessed that you were depressed, mainly because you always put on a good show for the world. </p><p>It was a particularly rough night for you. You woke up with a start in the middle of the night due to your recurring nightmares. You hadn\u2019t had nightmares since your parents died, but they were back, and they were back with a vengeance. You always dreamt the same thing: the way your parents died and you weren\u2019t able to save them. This had been going on for months now and you always resorted to the same coping mechanism&ndash;self harm. It definitely wasn\u2019t the best, you knew that, but it was all you knew how to do. You had been doing it ever since your parents died. You got out of bed and went into your bathroom. You opened the cupboard by the mirror and took out a prescription bottle. You opened it and let the blade you hid in it fall into your hand. You sat on the edge of the bathtub and raised your shorts. You always cut where people wouldn\u2019t see so no one would question you&ndash;that\u2019s how you\u2019ve gotten away with it all these years. A few tears fell down your cheeks as you lifted the blade and held it to the skin on your thigh. You glided the blade across your thigh and you didn\u2019t even flinch when you did. You had gotten used to the pain by now. You did this a few more times until you were as satisfied as you knew you were going to get. </p><p>You woke up the next morning with a sharp pain in your leg. You had bled all over your bed sheets. </p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d you muttered and hobbled over to your bathroom to clean your leg. You cleaned all the blood off your leg and just sat on the bathroom floor staring at the wall. All of a sudden you broke down. You cried and cried and cried until you didn\u2019t have any tears left. You were tired. You were tired of constantly hurting yourself and you were tired of hiding it from everyone, most importantly Tony. You eventually got up off the floor and walked back into your bedroom. You stripped the bed of the bloody sheets and replaced them with fresh, clean ones. You gathered the bloody sheets and made your way down to the laundry room to bleach them. </p><p>\u201cGood morning, sunshine,\u201d you heard behind you. You froze in your place and kept walking. Tony came up to you and grabbed your shoulder, spinning you around.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, honey?\u201d he asked. The second you met his eyes, you broke down again. Tony saw the bloody sheets and looked at you with a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cDo we need to go to the store?\u201d he asked. He thought you were on your period. You shook your head, still crying and dropped the sheets to the floor. Tony had no idea what was going on and he was starting to freak out.</p><p>\u201cY/N, what\u2019s going on? This isn\u2019t funny,\u201d he said sternly. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been keeping from you,\u201d you said shakily. Tony gave you another quizzical look. You lifted your shorts to show him the fresh cuts. Among that, Tony saw your thigh littered with old and new scars. It was worse than anything he\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he whispered, trailing off. Tears immediately started forming in his eyes. \u201cWhy did you never tell me sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you muttered. You didn\u2019t want to tell him it was because you didn\u2019t trust him enough yet. But now you did. And you needed help. Badly. You continued to cry and Tony softly shushed you, wiping away your tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m going to get you through this, okay? I love you so much and I\u2019m not going to let you go through this alone, okay? You have me, and you know for a fact you have the whole team,\u201d said Tony, matter of factly. You didn\u2019t know what to say, so you just nodded in response.</p><p>\u201cNow those cuts look really deep, so let\u2019s go to the lab and Bruce will stitch you up. He won\u2019t tell anyone. I promise. This is between you and me and whoever else you tell,\u201d continued Tony. Once again, you nodded. Tony picked up the bloody sheets off the floor and ushered you to Bruce\u2019s lab.</p><p>\u201cAlways know that I\u2019m always here for you no matter what. I would go to the ends of the earth for you, and I need you to know that. We\u2019re gonna get you through this. And no matter what, I\u2019ll always love you,\u201d finished Tony. You nodded again, a small smile on your face. You really owed that man the world. </p>",

He always made sure you were taken care of and that you were happy. He never would\u2019ve guessed that you were depressed, mainly because you always put on a good show for the world. </p><p>It was a particularly rough night for you. You woke up with a start in the middle of the night due to your recurring nightmares. You hadn\u2019t had nightmares since your parents died, but they were back, and they were back with a vengeance. You always dreamt the same thing: the way your parents died and you weren\u2019t able to save them. This had been going on for months now and you always resorted to the same coping mechanism\u2013self harm. It definitely wasn\u2019t the best, you knew that, but it was all you knew how to do. You had been doing it ever since your parents died. You got out of bed and went into your bathroom. You opened the cupboard by the mirror and took out a prescription bottle. You opened it and let the blade you hid in it fall into your hand. You sat on the edge of the bathtub and raised your shorts. You always cut where people wouldn\u2019t see so no one would question you\u2013that\u2019s how you\u2019ve gotten away with it all these years. A few tears fell down your cheeks as you lifted the blade and held it to the skin on your thigh. You glided the blade across your thigh and you didn\u2019t even flinch when you did. You had gotten used to the pain by now. You did this a few more times until you were as satisfied as you knew you were going to get. </p><p>You woke up the next morning with a sharp pain in your leg. You had bled all over your bed sheets. </p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d you muttered and hobbled over to your bathroom to clean your leg. You cleaned all the blood off your leg and just sat on the bathroom floor staring at the wall. All of a sudden you broke down. You cried and cried and cried until you didn\u2019t have any tears left. You were tired. You were tired of constantly hurting yourself and you were tired of hiding it from everyone, most importantly Tony. You eventually got up off the floor and walked back into your bedroom. You stripped the bed of the bloody sheets and replaced them with fresh, clean ones. You gathered the bloody sheets and made your way down to the laundry room to bleach them. </p><p>\u201cGood morning, sunshine,\u201d you heard behind you. You froze in your place and kept walking. Tony came up to you and grabbed your shoulder, spinning you around.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, honey?\u201d he asked. The second you met his eyes, you broke down again. Tony saw the bloody sheets and looked at you with a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cDo we need to go to the store?\u201d he asked. He thought you were on your period. You shook your head, still crying and dropped the sheets to the floor. Tony had no idea what was going on and he was starting to freak out.</p><p>\u201cY/N, what\u2019s going on? This isn\u2019t funny,\u201d he said sternly. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been keeping from you,\u201d you said shakily. Tony gave you another quizzical look. You lifted your shorts to show him the fresh cuts. Among that, Tony saw your thigh littered with old and new scars. It was worse than anything he\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he whispered, trailing off. Tears immediately started forming in his eyes. \u201cWhy did you never tell me sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you muttered. You didn\u2019t want to tell him it was because you didn\u2019t trust him enough yet. But now you did. And you needed help. Badly. You continued to cry and Tony softly shushed you, wiping away your tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m going to get you through this, okay? I love you so much and I\u2019m not going to let you go through this alone, okay? You have me, and you know for a fact you have the whole team,\u201d said Tony, matter of factly.
