To his own surprise, one was already slightly longer than the other, and part of him wondered how he had missed it, in the time they&rsquo;d been with him. Green slowly picks through his list, writing everything, no matter how small. Once he&rsquo;d gone through, he carefully crossed out what didn&rsquo;t bother him, and instead focused on what he <i>knew</i>&nbsp;he couldn&rsquo;t stand. In the end, he leaned back, shaking his head slightly.</small></p><p><small>He&rsquo;d call them in the morning, he decided quietly, pushing off to go to bed at last.</small></p><p><small>He&rsquo;s waiting for them the next morning, expression set into a firm line. Red and Gold both look a bit nervous, and he tries to soften up a little for a smile at both of them. They both manage to smile back, so he watches them, sees how hopeful they both are.</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;I know that you two have been waiting for this,&rdquo; He smiles a little, gestures for them to take a seat.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to disappoint either of you, but I did find one of you more preferable than the other, and that is entirely due to personal reasons.&rdquo; He gives them both a glance, before apologetically looking at Red.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Red - I don&rsquo;t think I can see myself dating you.&ldquo; He does reach out, takes Red&rsquo;s hand, the disappointed teen looking at him.&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mind spending time with you, but the history we have is just too much. You&rsquo;re going to make someone <i>very</i>&nbsp;lucky someday.&ldquo; Green leans in to kiss Red&rsquo;s cheek, who blushes pink in surprise, though he&rsquo;s clearly disappointed. He doesn&rsquo;t let Red go quite yet, and instead, pulls him into a hug.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll still love you, just not the way you want.&rdquo;<br /></small></p><p><small>In the end it hadn&rsquo;t been as tough of a choice as he made it out to be - While Gold&rsquo;s over-eagerness had been annoying, Red&rsquo;s disregard for his initial comfort had cost them any chance at a relationship. He bids a dejected Red goodbye, and out of the corner of his eye, he can see how excited he is, how <i>delighted</i>&nbsp;Gold is to be able to date him. Green plops back into his seat, and Gold fidgets in his seat, head down and fingers fiddling together as he does so.</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;No kiss?&ldquo; Green says lightly, gets a smile from the younger of the two brothers he&rsquo;d given his answer to.<br /></small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Do you want one?&ldquo; Gold appears thunderstruck, perks up. Green chuckles, leans in to plant a gentle kiss against a cheek. Gold&rsquo;s hand carefully touches his face, tilts his head just enough to lay a delicate kiss against Green&rsquo;s mouth, soft and sweet.<br /></small></p><p><small>(Eager and hopeful for what could become more) They pull apart, and Green presses their foreheads together.</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t treat this like a game Gold. You&rsquo;ve only got one chance to prove yourself. I don&rsquo;t give out second chances.&rdquo; Gold nods intently - just because he&rsquo;d beaten Red didn&rsquo;t mean anything. Now he had the <i>real</i>&nbsp;hard work - winning Green&rsquo;s heart.<br /></small></p>",

And her being able to understand her partner Aburibbon is just sweet. But, let\u2019s start talking about Bebenom\u2019s drawings in the \nlatest episode\n\nof <i>Pocket Monsters: Sun &amp; Moon:</i></p><h2>The Shape of Family, Bebenom\u2019s Feelings!</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c07f831281c2ffc4a8bbf4d25b518b2/tumblr_inline_pcw6zjlb791ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"/></figure><p>Well the first drawing is kind of a simple one, as it expresses how Bebenom loves Pikachu quite a bit, as we know already.

We see (from left to right) Pikachu, Mokuroh, Lugarugan, Rotom, Nyaheat, Satoshi, Burnet, Kukui and Gonbe, all surrounded by love scribbles. This scene made it <i>clear</i> that Bebenom is enjoying its stay with its Alolan Family (a term given by Suiren to Satoshi when Matsurika shows her painting of Burnet, Kukui, Satoshi, Bebenom, Rotom and Pikachu, and calling the painting a Scene of Family), and likes each and every one of the members in it.\u00a0 Honestly, Bebenom is such a good artist, and I like how the animators managed to make them look simple yet, to me, quite full of emotion (Iwane being the animation director this episode its probably his take on this).<br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8510621a431a5fd0ce00829f8ef561dc/tumblr_inline_pcw6qgSLbo1ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"/></figure><p>The third drawing happens after Bebenom sees a nightmare involving it\u2019s most-likely past in its homeworld, where everything is dark, gloomy, and no light in sight. And where Naganadel seems to be ill, probably even dying. It made such a painful voice. But after seeing the nightmare, Bebenom is shown to be in sort of a depressed state, focusing on its drawing and no paying attention to anyone around it. And when you look at the painting, Pikachu still has the Love Scribble, but around a drawing of itself, Bebenom has drawn clear tears of sadness. <br/></p><p>To me, this drawing kinda tells that while it\u2019s happy around Pikachu, loving the company of him and all, it\u2019s still feeling heavy burden around itself. It\u2019s like it\u2019s feeling guilty or something, about enjoying itself in Alola while its friends and family back at home are suffering. It either got to Alola by accident, or was told to go here. Either way, Bebenom\u2019s been away from home for so long, it\u2019s hard to imagine what might be going on with its friends. <i>What if, that Meteno episode was done as a way<b> to prepare the viewers for a horrible sight incoming</b></i>. I don\u2019t really want to believe Pokeani would go as far as to show Bebenom\u2019s whole family be dead, but I\u2019m getting the feeling someone is gonna be dead, or close-to-dying once Bebenom gets back home. And Ultra Guardians will most likely accompany it to see it happen. All of them or just Satoshi. We\u2019ll have to see about that.<br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0033e51b7fe78de37ae562d847655597/tumblr_inline_pcw6s3pnqD1ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"/></figure><p>The last drawing it drew right at the end of the episode confirms Bebenom definitely knows about The Radiant One, and while my intial thought from SM074 was that Bebenom might have fearful feelings towards this Legendary Pokemon, this drawing confirms it\u2019s the opposite. <b>Bebenom <i>loves</i> Ultra Necrozma.\u00a0 </b>This has me thinking that, while I do believe Necrozma is the one to cause chaos and darkness in Bebenom\u2019s homeworld, it\u2019s true form - The Radiant One - might actually be the key to restoring it back to the world with light. <br/></p><p>Sure, the nightmare may have been greyscale to futher emphatize the gloomy atmosphere around it, but when it comes to the dark clouds that were shown at the start of the nightmare, I think it may have been a hint at Necrozma having been to that world and sucking all the light out of it. But since Ultra Necrozma <i>is</i> filled with light, <a href=\"http://maskedkitsune.tumblr.com/post/173771097189/so-in-the-anime-universe-necrozma-is-known\">and as the legend in Pokeani says</a>, is one of the Legendary Trio (the other two being Lunala and Solgaleo) who brought light to Alola when it was created.</p><p>All of this makes me believe that Bebenom is on this journey to find The Radiant One, so it can restore its homeworld back to its origins, and to save its family back home. However, I doubt it knows Necrozma and The Radiant One are one and the same, so if it ever learns this&hellip;. it might be painful. Or Pokeani decides to make it slightly less painful, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c859a1e5dc444be0722155d38a79c21f/tumblr_inline_pcw8zvVmhn1ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7b058b7572d31ff16c34e1ec1378509e/tumblr_inline_pcw91sXvLd1ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/05719985159e4181f4579f6ff88a3468/tumblr_inline_pcw9101qDx1ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"/></figure><p>As a ending note, I have to add in addition to Bebenom\u2019s drawings, I am totally loving Bebenom itself right now, and I get so heartbroken at the scene where Bebenom is crying, and looking for comfort from Satoshi, each time I watched this episode. Even the moment where its happily nuzzling with Satoshi has me in tears because it\u2019s such a precious moment of the two. My heart is gonna break when Bebenom has to return to its home. I\u2019m so certain it\u2019ll go back now. It has its own family it cares for.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a2cf9402fb6e3aa08101ec6f1bd7a47/tumblr_inline_pcw9aeLb6G1ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"/></figure><p>Also really liked Skull Gang in this episode, since it shows they\u2019re just normal beings who have grown to be bullies. They don\u2019t have an agenda like Rocket Gang or Flare Gang or any other previous Gangs. They just want to be appreciated. But their personalities don\u2019t exactly help with that.</p><p>Anyway, I\u2019m not sure I have much else to say! Although I do have to mention how much I <i>love </i>Burnet!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a75ee6144ea63813af4ca30463f88dbc/tumblr_inline_pcw9glV3A41ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"/></figure><p>Just look at her! What a great mom she\u2019ll be. And a great parent for Satoshi\u2019s Alolan Family \u2665 This family bond is gonna be hard to overcome when the series is done and we move on to Gen 8 series. <br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9e948bd4dd70709af86bb80a85ba970/tumblr_inline_pcw9iwp2Ak1ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"/></figure><p>Overall a good episode, nice start with Satoshi shown practice battling with everyone involved (more arrowshaped Razor leaf from Mokuroh &lt;3), and nice plot reveals. I am <i>so</i> looking forward to the Necrozma arc that starts on August 23rd. Only 3 weeks til that!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ee344526bc61576245849b79ff03c9f7/tumblr_inline_pcw9n5ye8r1ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"/></figure><p>In the PokeProblem\u2019s Post-Segment, Bebenom shows its affection towards Satoshi by scribbling on his shirt.

You can tell from her personality she\u2019s a kind soul and has no ill feelings towards anyone, and really likes giving soul to her drawings. And her being able to understand her partner Aburibbon is just sweet. But, let\u2019s start talking about Bebenom\u2019s drawings in the \nlatest episode\n\nof <i>Pocket Monsters: Sun &amp; Moon:</i></p><h2>The Shape of Family, Bebenom\u2019s Feelings!</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c07f831281c2ffc4a8bbf4d25b518b2/tumblr_inline_pcw6zjlb791ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"></figure><p>Well the first drawing is kind of a simple one, as it expresses how Bebenom loves Pikachu quite a bit, as we know already. We learn about halfway through the episode from Matsurika that the scribble next to Pikachu right here actually is Bebenom saying \n\u3059\u304d \u3059\u304d \u3060\u3044\u3059\u304d [<i>Suki Suki Daisuki</i>], which means <i>\u201cLike, like, love\u201c! </i>Having heard those words quite a bit in the past, I didn\u2019t need subtitles to understand the message.<br></p>[[MORE]]<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb3a35b21b4476af3f8f064140530092/tumblr_inline_pcw6pps2Fu1ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"></figure><p>The second drawing we see is of the people Bebenom seems to feel close to, loving them whole lot. We see (from left to right) Pikachu, Mokuroh, Lugarugan, Rotom, Nyaheat, Satoshi, Burnet, Kukui and Gonbe, all surrounded by love scribbles. This scene made it <i>clear</i> that Bebenom is enjoying its stay with its Alolan Family (a term given by Suiren to Satoshi when Matsurika shows her painting of Burnet, Kukui, Satoshi, Bebenom, Rotom and Pikachu, and calling the painting a Scene of Family), and likes each and every one of the members in it.\u00a0 Honestly, Bebenom is such a good artist, and I like how the animators managed to make them look simple yet, to me, quite full of emotion (Iwane being the animation director this episode its probably his take on this).<br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8510621a431a5fd0ce00829f8ef561dc/tumblr_inline_pcw6qgSLbo1ugmi1y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"></figure><p>The third drawing happens after Bebenom sees a nightmare involving it\u2019s most-likely past in its homeworld, where everything is dark, gloomy, and no light in sight. And where Naganadel seems to be ill, probably even dying. It made such a painful voice. But after seeing the nightmare, Bebenom is shown to be in sort of a depressed state, focusing on its drawing and no paying attention to anyone around it. And when you look at the painting, Pikachu still has the Love Scribble, but around a drawing of itself, Bebenom has drawn clear tears of sadness. <br></p><p>To me, this drawing kinda tells that while it\u2019s happy around Pikachu, loving the company of him and all, it\u2019s still feeling heavy burden around itself. It\u2019s like it\u2019s feeling guilty or something, about enjoying itself in Alola while its friends and family back at home are suffering. It either got to Alola by accident, or was told to go here. Either way, Bebenom\u2019s been away from home for so long, it\u2019s hard to imagine what might be going on with its friends. <i>What if, that Meteno episode was done as a way<b> to prepare the viewers for a horrible sight incoming</b></i>. I don\u2019t really want to believe Pokeani would go as far as to show Bebenom\u2019s whole family be dead, but I\u2019m getting the feeling someone is gonna be dead, or close-to-dying once Bebenom gets back home.

You can tell from her personality she&rsquo;s a kind soul and has no ill feelings towards anyone, and really likes giving soul to her drawings. And her being able to understand her partner Aburibbon is just sweet. But, let&rsquo;s start talking about Bebenom&rsquo;s drawings in the \nlatest episode\n\nof <i>Pocket Monsters: Sun &amp; Moon:</i></p><h2>The Shape of Family, Bebenom&rsquo;s Feelings!</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c07f831281c2ffc4a8bbf4d25b518b2/tumblr_inline_pcw6zjlb791ugmi1y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Well the first drawing is kind of a simple one, as it expresses how Bebenom loves Pikachu quite a bit, as we know already. We learn about halfway through the episode from Matsurika that the scribble next to Pikachu right here actually is Bebenom saying \n&#12377;&#12365; &#12377;&#12365; &#12384;&#12356;&#12377;&#12365; [<i>Suki Suki Daisuki</i>], which means <i>&ldquo;Like, like, love&ldquo;! </i>Having heard those words quite a bit in the past, I didn&rsquo;t need subtitles to understand the message.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb3a35b21b4476af3f8f064140530092/tumblr_inline_pcw6pps2Fu1ugmi1y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The second drawing we see is of the people Bebenom seems to feel close to, loving them whole lot. We see (from left to right) Pikachu, Mokuroh, Lugarugan, Rotom, Nyaheat, Satoshi, Burnet, Kukui and Gonbe, all surrounded by love scribbles. This scene made it <i>clear</i> that Bebenom is enjoying its stay with its Alolan Family (a term given by Suiren to Satoshi when Matsurika shows her painting of Burnet, Kukui, Satoshi, Bebenom, Rotom and Pikachu, and calling the painting a Scene of Family), and likes each and every one of the members in it.&nbsp; Honestly, Bebenom is such a good artist, and I like how the animators managed to make them look simple yet, to me, quite full of emotion (Iwane being the animation director this episode its probably his take on this).<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8510621a431a5fd0ce00829f8ef561dc/tumblr_inline_pcw6qgSLbo1ugmi1y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The third drawing happens after Bebenom sees a nightmare involving it&rsquo;s most-likely past in its homeworld, where everything is dark, gloomy, and no light in sight. And where Naganadel seems to be ill, probably even dying. It made such a painful voice. But after seeing the nightmare, Bebenom is shown to be in sort of a depressed state, focusing on its drawing and no paying attention to anyone around it. And when you look at the painting, Pikachu still has the Love Scribble, but around a drawing of itself, Bebenom has drawn clear tears of sadness. <br /></p><p>To me, this drawing kinda tells that while it&rsquo;s happy around Pikachu, loving the company of him and all, it&rsquo;s still feeling heavy burden around itself. It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s feeling guilty or something, about enjoying itself in Alola while its friends and family back at home are suffering. It either got to Alola by accident, or was told to go here. Either way, Bebenom&rsquo;s been away from home for so long, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine what might be going on with its friends. <i>What if, that Meteno episode was done as a way<b> to prepare the viewers for a horrible sight incoming</b></i>. I don&rsquo;t really want to believe Pokeani would go as far as to show Bebenom&rsquo;s whole family be dead, but I&rsquo;m getting the feeling someone is gonna be dead, or close-to-dying once Bebenom gets back home. And Ultra Guardians will most likely accompany it to see it happen. All of them or just Satoshi. We&rsquo;ll have to see about that.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0033e51b7fe78de37ae562d847655597/tumblr_inline_pcw6s3pnqD1ugmi1y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The last drawing it drew right at the end of the episode confirms Bebenom definitely knows about The Radiant One, and while my intial thought from SM074 was that Bebenom might have fearful feelings towards this Legendary Pokemon, this drawing confirms it&rsquo;s the opposite. <b>Bebenom <i>loves</i> Ultra Necrozma.&nbsp; </b>This has me thinking that, while I do believe Necrozma is the one to cause chaos and darkness in Bebenom&rsquo;s homeworld, it&rsquo;s true form - The Radiant One - might actually be the key to restoring it back to the world with light. <br /></p><p>Sure, the nightmare may have been greyscale to futher emphatize the gloomy atmosphere around it, but when it comes to the dark clouds that were shown at the start of the nightmare, I think it may have been a hint at Necrozma having been to that world and sucking all the light out of it. But since Ultra Necrozma <i>is</i> filled with light, <a href=\"http://maskedkitsune.tumblr.com/post/173771097189/so-in-the-anime-universe-necrozma-is-known\">and as the legend in Pokeani says</a>, is one of the Legendary Trio (the other two being Lunala and Solgaleo) who brought light to Alola when it was created.</p><p>All of this makes me believe that Bebenom is on this journey to find The Radiant One, so it can restore its homeworld back to its origins, and to save its family back home. However, I doubt it knows Necrozma and The Radiant One are one and the same, so if it ever learns this&hellip;. it might be painful. Or Pokeani decides to make it slightly less painful, we&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c859a1e5dc444be0722155d38a79c21f/tumblr_inline_pcw8zvVmhn1ugmi1y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7b058b7572d31ff16c34e1ec1378509e/tumblr_inline_pcw91sXvLd1ugmi1y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/05719985159e4181f4579f6ff88a3468/tumblr_inline_pcw9101qDx1ugmi1y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>As a ending note, I have to add in addition to Bebenom&rsquo;s drawings, I am totally loving Bebenom itself right now, and I get so heartbroken at the scene where Bebenom is crying, and looking for comfort from Satoshi, each time I watched this episode. Even the moment where its happily nuzzling with Satoshi has me in tears because it&rsquo;s such a precious moment of the two. My heart is gonna break when Bebenom has to return to its home. I&rsquo;m so certain it&rsquo;ll go back now. It has its own family it cares for.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a2cf9402fb6e3aa08101ec6f1bd7a47/tumblr_inline_pcw9aeLb6G1ugmi1y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Also really liked Skull Gang in this episode, since it shows they&rsquo;re just normal beings who have grown to be bullies. They don&rsquo;t have an agenda like Rocket Gang or Flare Gang or any other previous Gangs. They just want to be appreciated.

            "description": "There is a growing desire and expectation of humans here on Earth in making full contact with PoK\u00e9MoN who are still unknown. Back in 1995, when I saw my first UPM (Unindexed Pocket Monster), I found out very quickly that other people thought you were totally crazy if you said you saw such things. The world has changed quite a bit since then when I was a child. In fact, in late 1997, a poll taken in Kanto shows that for the first time ever, more than fifty percent of residents now believe in Pok\u00e9GODS's. Since then, there have been polls that put the figure at over eighty percent or more.",

Cause that&rsquo;s still something that surprises me to this day. Instead, it winds up with the rather unique Electric/Ground typing. Which makes enough sense for a flatfish, being something the buries itself in the sand. And what better way to interpret that than basically making the thing a land-mine. But also a whoopie cushion. Suddenly its rather flatulent-sounding cry makes more sense!</p><p>Of course, this is another one of those Pokemon that was hated immediately just because it ain&rsquo;t a cat or a fox. But rather some \u201cugly\u201d fish thing. But honestly, if you were to look at a real-life flat-fish&rsquo;s face, you&rsquo;d be counting your blessings that Stunfisk here is actually less weird looking than that thing. But I&rsquo;m over here saying it&rsquo;s a crime that Stunfisk&rsquo;s face isn&rsquo;t all contorted and Picasso-like.</p><p>As far as personal opinion goes, Stufisk feels like a design from Gen 1.
