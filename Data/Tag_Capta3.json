Muggy with a very slight breeze. The sun blazes over the desert highway when she drove, making her wonder how anyone could ever drive here without melting. She covers her eyes as she looks upon the small building in front of her. Turning the motorcycle (that she\u2026 borrowed) off, she steps off and pushes the kickstand with her right foot. Sporting a\u2026 whatever \u2018NIN\u2019 is shirt, she walks inside <i>Pancho\u2019s Bar</i>, flashbacks appear of a time where she and unknown beautiful lady spent time playing arcade games, drinking, and singing karaoke.\u00a0</p><p>The bar had an air of familiarity surrounding it. Looking around the room, Carol\u2019s eyes zero in on the dashingly gorgeous woman behind the bar. She sports a very high afro, big golden hoops, and a <i>Pancho\u2019s Bar</i> t-shirt, Carol unable to see the rest of her due to the counter top blocking her view. As she approaches the bar, something from her peripheral vision stops her in her tracks. She turns her head to the wall that\u2019s plastered full of Air Force fighter jet pictures. As she walks closer to the wall, the picture with\u00a0a winged unicorn logo on the tail of one of the jets\u2019 tail stands out to her. She slightly touches the picture, startled when she hears a clear of a throat. She turns back to see the lady behind the bar with her arms folded, a scowl on her face.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d The woman asks, a slight attitude in her tone. Although her tone seemed a bit rude, Carol couldn\u2019t help but swoon a bit over the lady\u2019s voice; it sounded the way honey tastes: sweet and thick, her accent being unfamiliar to Carol\u2019s ears.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Carol looks back at the picture in front of her. \u201cWhere was this photograph taken?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The lady scoffs and makes her way back to the bar. Carol follows behind closely. With her arms still folded, the woman stands behind the bar, unfolds her arms and starts wiping the counter. \u201cNo clue, boo. I just work here\u2026 I wasn\u2019t in charge of interior decorating, so I don\u2019t know where that picture comes from, let alone where it was taken\u2026\u201d</p><p>Carol frowns in thought, then leans over a bit from where she stands in front of the bar top to read the woman\u2019s name tag. <i>Nina</i>, it read. Nina gives Carol a puzzled look, as if she\u2019s trying to look right through her. A gasp escapes her lips, which only leaves Carol to give the same puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cCarol! Girl, I thought you were dead?\u201d Nina exclaims, stopping herself from wiping the counter and instead placing her left hand on top of it, her right on her hip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 Vers. I\u2019m sorry, who\u2019s Carol?\u201d She questions, a blank look adorns her face.</p><p>Nina looks at Carol for a split second before bursting into laughter. \u201cGirl\u2026 Vers? Seriously? Like your last name, Danvers?\u201d</p><p>Carol shakes her head slowly in a \u2018no\u2019 motion. Who is Carol and how does this Nina know her?</p><p>\u201cYou messing with me, right?\u201d\u2014 when Carol shakes her head \u2018no\u2019 again, Nina\u2019s eyes widen\u2014 \u201cOh snap\u2026 you really don\u2019t know who you are anymore? Damn, that accident jacked you up!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Carol cracks a small smile after hearing that phrase; she may have lost her memory, but she still had a good sense of humor. Nina takes the moment to laugh too, her nose and eyes crinkling as she does so. Carol suddenly felt her stomach churn, almost giddy at hearing Nina laugh. That same air of familiarity from her arrival hits her as she looks at Nina.</p><p>**</p><p><i><b>1988. Pancho\u2019s Bar</b></i></p><p><i>Maria dragged Carol to this bar for the third time this week, letting her best friend know that they both needed a break from the boys\u2019 club known as the Air Force. Carol willingly let this happened since she knew she\u2019d have a great time like always at the bar.</i></p><p><i>Pancho\u2019s was always so welcoming; it didn\u2019t matter who came in, the staff of Pancho\u2019s had a lovely greeting for them. Tonight, was no different.</i></p><p><i>Maria and Carol walked in arm-in-arm and immediately walked to the bar. The bartender was none other than Nina herself; a beautiful, fly black woman with two small afro puffs donning her head.</i></p><p><i>\u201cTwo fuzzy navels for us, Nina!\u201d Maria orders, gaining a nod from Nina who immediately made the drinks.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Carol shook her head at her best friend; Maria always knew what to order to get the party started.</i></p><p><i>Nina came back with the drinks, handing each one to Carol and Maria, who tipped handsomely. Being from Louisiana, Maria downed her drink in no time, leaving Carol to drink alone.</i>\u00a0</p><p>**</p><p><i>5 shots and 2 more fuzzy navels later, Maria and Carol cackle loudly at some joke made by someone sitting with them at their booth. Maria looked around the room and spotted the stage that held two microphones for karaoke. She looked back at Carol and wiggled her eyebrows. Carol rolled her eyes in return and groaned.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAgain, Maria? We just sung \u2018<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APohhzK0jOU\">Kiss Me Deadly</a>\u2019 two nights ago\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>Maria said nothing in return and dragged her best friend (like she\u2019d been doing the entire night) up to the stage and cued the DJ to play \u2018<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xzN8Nt0Pok\">I Wanna Dance with Somebody</a>\u2019 by Whitney Houston. Although reluctant at first, Carol eventually got into the groove and sung her heart out along with her best friend. Carol eventually made her way behind the bar to serenade Nina and coaxed her to sing into the mic. Nina giggled and sung right along with Carol.</i></p><p><i>**</i></p><p><i>Once the bar was closing up, Maria and Carol stood in front of it, talking to a few coworkers about facing another day at the airport. Maria walked over to a telephone booth to make a call for a taxi. Carol looked between the telephone booth and the bar\u2019s entrance, making sure Maria was safe and waiting for Nina to make her exit. Nina was in charge of closing and Carol wanted to make sure she\u2019d make it safely to her car. When Nina exited, she locked the door behind her and smiled when she turned to see Carol waiting for her. It was a habit of Carol\u2019s that Nina found endearing. Waving a bit, Nina walked towards Carol to thank her as always.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>In a drunken stupor, Carol softly took hold of Nina\u2019s arm and crashed her lips into hers, moaning softly when Nina kissed back. A mix of peach schnapps and mint clashed together as the two held each other closely. Carol supposed it was liquid courage that finally had her make a move on someone she\u2019d had her eyes on for a while. Nina was the first to break away from the kiss, leaving Carol dissatisfied. When Carol pouted, Nina giggled again and caressed Carol\u2019s left cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk, boo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Carol smiled widely and laughed a bit. \u201cAnd when I\u2019m sober, I\u2019ll come back and do the same thing!\u201d She hiccupped after the confession, making Nina laugh again.</i></p><p><i>She looked to where Maria stood at the telephone booth (who had been silently cheering her best friend on) and pointed to Carol. \u201cPlease make sure you two make it home safely, Maria!\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>She looked back at Carol, who had such a stupid grin on her face, Maria was bound to make fun of her for it later. Nina smiled and pinched the cheek she caressed earlier. \u201cGoodnight, Carol.\u201d</i></p><p>**</p><p>\u201cNina\u2026 Nina Sanders\u2026\u201d Carol speaks softly as she looks into Nina\u2019s eyes. She sees those eyes getting teary and felt a shove coming from Nina.</p><p>\u201cI thought you completely forgot!\u201d Nina exclaims, quickly wiping a tear that fell from her eye. Carol was a dear friend to Nina, so when she heard the news of Carol\u2019s \u2018death\u2019, it took a toll on her, too. When Carol walked into Pancho\u2019s and didn\u2019t seem to recognize the place, let alone her and their moment back in \u201988, Nina began to lose hope. But leave it to Carol to defy the odds.</p><p>\u201cWe sung to <i>Whitney Houston</i> the night we kissed\u2026 I think your laugh\u2026 triggered that memory for me.\u201d Carol admits, subconsciously touching her lips. <br/></p><p>Nina wears a smugly grin, similar to that of Carol\u2019s that night after their kiss. Carol\u2019s smile quickly fades into a frown, pondering of the whereabouts of Maria.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaria? Well, after your accident, she moved back to Louisiana\u2026\u201d Nina speaks somberly, saddened that her two favorite customers (and close friends) became separated by such a tragic thing.</p><p>Carol looks back to the picture on the wall, closing in on the details. A logo of a winged unicorn is displayed on the tail of the airplane. She points back to it again. \u201cWhere\u2019s <i>Pegasus</i>?\u201d</p><p>Before Nina could open her mouth, Director Nick Fury coolly strolled into the place to interrupt. \u201cThat\u2019s classified. Not unlike the file I started on you.\u201d <br/>Carol looks to Nina apologetically before eyeing Fury and slowly walking over to the table near him. \u201cBut I see you changed it up a bit since then. Grunge is a good look for you.\u201d Fury comments jokingly.</p><p>Nina took this as a cue to actually prep for the bar\u2019s opening in a few hours. Carol took the opportunity to test Fury to see if it was actually him or a Skrull. Once he seemingly passed, Fury questions Carol on whether she\u2019s a Skrull or not. She calmly blasts energy out her fists towards the jukebox on the opposite side of the room. She cheekily rests her head back on her fist. Fury turns around to check out the jukebox, he looks back to her confused and concerned. In the background, they hear Nina yell \u2018what the fuck, Carol!?\u2019 as she hurriedly ran over to check the damage.</p><p>**</p><p>Once Carol and Fury decide to head out in search for <i>Pegasus</i>, Carol tells Fury to wait by the door. He listens, waiting at the door since he sensed he\u2019d interrupted earlier. Carol half jogs to the bar counter again, Nina looking up at her in feigned anger. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the jukebox, Nina.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Nina rolls her eyes and laughs a bit. \u201cDon\u2019t even trip, C-baby!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Carol looks confused by the phrase (and the nickname) until Nina clarifies that the jukebox incident is fine. They share a laugh between each other before silently grinning at one another. Carol turns to walk away, but suddenly turns back around. She approaches the counter closer than earlier, leaning ever so slightly in Nina\u2019s personal space. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m sober now.\u201d</p><p>Nina beams at her and the two share a brief, but slightly steamy kiss. Carol\u2019s the first to break away, booping Nina\u2019s nose with her finger before walking away backwards.</p><p>\u201cTell Maria and Monica I said \u2018hey\u2019, alright?\u201d</p><p>Carol salutes her then turns around to face Fury and they exit the building in search for Dr. Lawson and Pegasus.<br/></p><p>**</p><p><b><i>A.N: I\u2019ll probably do this more often now, but please don\u2019t hesitate to leave feedback! Whether it\u2019s directly on the post or in the tags, it\u2019s greatly appreciated! It definitely helps me write more lol</i></b></p>",

As she approaches the bar, something from her peripheral vision stops her in her tracks. She turns her head to the wall that\u2019s plastered full of Air Force fighter jet pictures. As she walks closer to the wall, the picture with\u00a0a winged unicorn logo on the tail of one of the jets\u2019 tail stands out to her. She slightly touches the picture, startled when she hears a clear of a throat. She turns back to see the lady behind the bar with her arms folded, a scowl on her face.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d The woman asks, a slight attitude in her tone. Although her tone seemed a bit rude, Carol couldn\u2019t help but swoon a bit over the lady\u2019s voice; it sounded the way honey tastes: sweet and thick, her accent being unfamiliar to Carol\u2019s ears.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>Carol looks back at the picture in front of her. \u201cWhere was this photograph taken?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The lady scoffs and makes her way back to the bar.

Nina gives Carol a puzzled look, as if she\u2019s trying to look right through her. A gasp escapes her lips, which only leaves Carol to give the same puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cCarol! Girl, I thought you were dead?\u201d Nina exclaims, stopping herself from wiping the counter and instead placing her left hand on top of it, her right on her hip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 Vers. I\u2019m sorry, who\u2019s Carol?\u201d She questions, a blank look adorns her face.</p><p>Nina looks at Carol for a split second before bursting into laughter. \u201cGirl\u2026 Vers? Seriously?

Damn, that accident jacked you up!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Carol cracks a small smile after hearing that phrase; she may have lost her memory, but she still had a good sense of humor. Nina takes the moment to laugh too, her nose and eyes crinkling as she does so. Carol suddenly felt her stomach churn, almost giddy at hearing Nina laugh. That same air of familiarity from her arrival hits her as she looks at Nina.</p><p>**</p><p><i><b>1988. Pancho\u2019s Bar</b></i></p><p><i>Maria dragged Carol to this bar for the third time this week, letting her best friend know that they both needed a break from the boys\u2019 club known as the Air Force. Carol willingly let this happened since she knew she\u2019d have a great time like always at the bar.</i></p><p><i>Pancho\u2019s was always so welcoming; it didn\u2019t matter who came in, the staff of Pancho\u2019s had a lovely greeting for them. Tonight, was no different.</i></p><p><i>Maria and Carol walked in arm-in-arm and immediately walked to the bar. The bartender was none other than Nina herself; a beautiful, fly black woman with two small afro puffs donning her head.</i></p><p><i>\u201cTwo fuzzy navels for us, Nina!\u201d Maria orders, gaining a nod from Nina who immediately made the drinks.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Carol shook her head at her best friend; Maria always knew what to order to get the party started.</i></p><p><i>Nina came back with the drinks, handing each one to Carol and Maria, who tipped handsomely. Being from Louisiana, Maria downed her drink in no time, leaving Carol to drink alone.</i>\u00a0</p><p>**</p><p><i>5 shots and 2 more fuzzy navels later, Maria and Carol cackle loudly at some joke made by someone sitting with them at their booth. Maria looked around the room and spotted the stage that held two microphones for karaoke. She looked back at Carol and wiggled her eyebrows. Carol rolled her eyes in return and groaned.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAgain, Maria?

Although reluctant at first, Carol eventually got into the groove and sung her heart out along with her best friend. Carol eventually made her way behind the bar to serenade Nina and coaxed her to sing into the mic. Nina giggled and sung right along with Carol.</i></p><p><i>**</i></p><p><i>Once the bar was closing up, Maria and Carol stood in front of it, talking to a few coworkers about facing another day at the airport. Maria walked over to a telephone booth to make a call for a taxi. Carol looked between the telephone booth and the bar\u2019s entrance, making sure Maria was safe and waiting for Nina to make her exit. Nina was in charge of closing and Carol wanted to make sure she\u2019d make it safely to her car. When Nina exited, she locked the door behind her and smiled when she turned to see Carol waiting for her. It was a habit of Carol\u2019s that Nina found endearing. Waving a bit, Nina walked towards Carol to thank her as always.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>In a drunken stupor, Carol softly took hold of Nina\u2019s arm and crashed her lips into hers, moaning softly when Nina kissed back.

Pancho&rsquo;s Bar</b></i></p><p><i>Maria dragged Carol to this bar for the third time this week, letting her best friend know that they both needed a break from the boys&rsquo; club known as the Air Force. Carol willingly let this happened since she knew she&rsquo;d have a great time like always at the bar.</i></p><p><i>Pancho&rsquo;s was always so welcoming; it didn&rsquo;t matter who came in, the staff of Pancho&rsquo;s had a lovely greeting for them. Tonight, was no different.</i></p><p><i>Maria and Carol walked in arm-in-arm and immediately walked to the bar. The bartender was none other than Nina herself; a beautiful, fly black woman with two small afro puffs donning her head.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Two fuzzy navels for us, Nina!&rdquo; Maria orders, gaining a nod from Nina who immediately made the drinks.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Carol shook her head at her best friend; Maria always knew what to order to get the party started.</i></p><p><i>Nina came back with the drinks, handing each one to Carol and Maria, who tipped handsomely. Being from Louisiana, Maria downed her drink in no time, leaving Carol to drink alone.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>**</p><p><i>5 shots and 2 more fuzzy navels later, Maria and Carol cackle loudly at some joke made by someone sitting with them at their booth. Maria looked around the room and spotted the stage that held two microphones for karaoke. She looked back at Carol and wiggled her eyebrows. Carol rolled her eyes in return and groaned.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Again, Maria? We just sung &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APohhzK0jOU\">Kiss Me Deadly</a>&rsquo; two nights ago&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Maria said nothing in return and dragged her best friend (like she&rsquo;d been doing the entire night) up to the stage and cued the DJ to play &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xzN8Nt0Pok\">I Wanna Dance with Somebody</a>&rsquo; by Whitney Houston. Although reluctant at first, Carol eventually got into the groove and sung her heart out along with her best friend. Carol eventually made her way behind the bar to serenade Nina and coaxed her to sing into the mic. Nina giggled and sung right along with Carol.</i></p><p><i>**</i></p><p><i>Once the bar was closing up, Maria and Carol stood in front of it, talking to a few coworkers about facing another day at the airport. Maria walked over to a telephone booth to make a call for a taxi. Carol looked between the telephone booth and the bar&rsquo;s entrance, making sure Maria was safe and waiting for Nina to make her exit. Nina was in charge of closing and Carol wanted to make sure she&rsquo;d make it safely to her car. When Nina exited, she locked the door behind her and smiled when she turned to see Carol waiting for her. It was a habit of Carol&rsquo;s that Nina found endearing. Waving a bit, Nina walked towards Carol to thank her as always.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>In a drunken stupor, Carol softly took hold of Nina&rsquo;s arm and crashed her lips into hers, moaning softly when Nina kissed back. A mix of peach schnapps and mint clashed together as the two held each other closely. Carol supposed it was liquid courage that finally had her make a move on someone she&rsquo;d had her eyes on for a while. Nina was the first to break away from the kiss, leaving Carol dissatisfied. When Carol pouted, Nina giggled again and caressed Carol&rsquo;s left cheeks. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re drunk, boo.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Carol smiled widely and laughed a bit. &ldquo;And when I&rsquo;m sober, I&rsquo;ll come back and do the same thing!&rdquo; She hiccupped after the confession, making Nina laugh again.</i></p><p><i>She looked to where Maria stood at the telephone booth (who had been silently cheering her best friend on) and pointed to Carol. &ldquo;Please make sure you two make it home safely, Maria!&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>She looked back at Carol, who had such a stupid grin on her face, Maria was bound to make fun of her for it later. Nina smiled and pinched the cheek she caressed earlier. &ldquo;Goodnight, Carol.&rdquo;</i></p><p>**</p><p>&ldquo;Nina&hellip; Nina Sanders&hellip;&rdquo; Carol speaks softly as she looks into Nina&rsquo;s eyes. She sees those eyes getting teary and felt a shove coming from Nina.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you completely forgot!&rdquo; Nina exclaims, quickly wiping a tear that fell from her eye. Carol was a dear friend to Nina, so when she heard the news of Carol&rsquo;s &lsquo;death&rsquo;, it took a toll on her, too. When Carol walked into Pancho&rsquo;s and didn&rsquo;t seem to recognize the place, let alone her and their moment back in &rsquo;88, Nina began to lose hope. But leave it to Carol to defy the odds.</p><p>&ldquo;We sung to <i>Whitney Houston</i> the night we kissed&hellip; I think your laugh&hellip; triggered that memory for me.&rdquo; Carol admits, subconsciously touching her lips. <br /></p><p>Nina wears a smugly grin, similar to that of Carol&rsquo;s that night after their kiss. Carol&rsquo;s smile quickly fades into a frown, pondering of the whereabouts of Maria.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maria? Well, after your accident, she moved back to Louisiana&hellip;&rdquo; Nina speaks somberly, saddened that her two favorite customers (and close friends) became separated by such a tragic thing.</p><p>Carol looks back to the picture on the wall, closing in on the details. A logo of a winged unicorn is displayed on the tail of the airplane. She points back to it again. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s <i>Pegasus</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Before Nina could open her mouth, Director Nick Fury coolly strolled into the place to interrupt. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s classified. Not unlike the file I started on you.&rdquo; <br />Carol looks to Nina apologetically before eyeing Fury and slowly walking over to the table near him. &ldquo;But I see you changed it up a bit since then. Grunge is a good look for you.&rdquo; Fury comments jokingly.</p><p>Nina took this as a cue to actually prep for the bar&rsquo;s opening in a few hours. Carol took the opportunity to test Fury to see if it was actually him or a Skrull. Once he seemingly passed, Fury questions Carol on whether she&rsquo;s a Skrull or not. She calmly blasts energy out her fists towards the jukebox on the opposite side of the room. She cheekily rests her head back on her fist. Fury turns around to check out the jukebox, he looks back to her confused and concerned. In the background, they hear Nina yell &lsquo;what the fuck, Carol!?&rsquo; as she hurriedly ran over to check the damage.</p><p>**</p><p>Once Carol and Fury decide to head out in search for <i>Pegasus</i>, Carol tells Fury to wait by the door. He listens, waiting at the door since he sensed he&rsquo;d interrupted earlier. Carol half jogs to the bar counter again, Nina looking up at her in feigned anger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about the jukebox, Nina.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Nina rolls her eyes and laughs a bit. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even trip, C-baby!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Carol looks confused by the phrase (and the nickname) until Nina clarifies that the jukebox incident is fine. They share a laugh between each other before silently grinning at one another. Carol turns to walk away, but suddenly turns back around. She approaches the counter closer than earlier, leaning ever so slightly in Nina&rsquo;s personal space. &ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;m sober now.&rdquo;</p><p>Nina beams at her and the two share a brief, but slightly steamy kiss. Carol&rsquo;s the first to break away, booping Nina&rsquo;s nose with her finger before walking away backwards.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell Maria and Monica I said &lsquo;hey&rsquo;, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Carol salutes her then turns around to face Fury and they exit the building in search for Dr. Lawson and Pegasus.<br /></p><p>**</p><p><b><i>A.N: I&rsquo;ll probably do this more often now, but please don&rsquo;t hesitate to leave feedback!

Muggy with a very slight breeze. The sun blazes over the desert highway when she drove, making her wonder how anyone could ever drive here without melting. She covers her eyes as she looks upon the small building in front of her. Turning the motorcycle (that she&hellip; borrowed) off, she steps off and pushes the kickstand with her right foot. Sporting a&hellip; whatever &lsquo;NIN&rsquo; is shirt, she walks inside <i>Pancho&rsquo;s Bar</i>, flashbacks appear of a time where she and unknown beautiful lady spent time playing arcade games, drinking, and singing karaoke.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The bar had an air of familiarity surrounding it. Looking around the room, Carol&rsquo;s eyes zero in on the dashingly gorgeous woman behind the bar. She sports a very high afro, big golden hoops, and a <i>Pancho&rsquo;s Bar</i> t-shirt, Carol unable to see the rest of her due to the counter top blocking her view. As she approaches the bar, something from her peripheral vision stops her in her tracks. She turns her head to the wall that&rsquo;s plastered full of Air Force fighter jet pictures. As she walks closer to the wall, the picture with&nbsp;a winged unicorn logo on the tail of one of the jets&rsquo; tail stands out to her. She slightly touches the picture, startled when she hears a clear of a throat. She turns back to see the lady behind the bar with her arms folded, a scowl on her face.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;May I help you?&rdquo; The woman asks, a slight attitude in her tone. Although her tone seemed a bit rude, Carol couldn&rsquo;t help but swoon a bit over the lady&rsquo;s voice; it sounded the way honey tastes: sweet and thick, her accent being unfamiliar to Carol&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",
