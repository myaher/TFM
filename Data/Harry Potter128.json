Maybe, it could be in the library, while the two of you were looking for some books to help you figure out some mysterious things that were happening in the school. He would bring you so many books because he didn&rsquo;t know what to actually look for. He put them in front of you with a loud noise. You were used to him being so childish so you didn&rsquo;t even looked at him. He than moved from his place and got around the corner. You stopped your reading and the thought of the fact that you were both in the last year and that you were the girlfriend of the Golden Boy brought a smile on your lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; Harry called for you. &ldquo;Would you mind helping he with getting those books? I don&rsquo;t know which one of them to choose.&rdquo; You stood up and went to the place where the voice called to you.</p><p>As you went around the corner you saw your boyfriend in one knee. You thought that he fell and you joked a little. &ldquo;Did the Golden Boy, lost something?&rdquo; You said with your lips curved into a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I wanted to ask you something&hellip;&rdquo; He took out of his pocket a small red box. &ldquo;&hellip;Will you make me the happiest wizard and will you be my wife?&rdquo;</p><p>You were too shocked to say anything, but still, your humor didn&rsquo;t let you be.</p><p>&ldquo;And why would I say yas?&rdquo; You asked with a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m the Chosen One.&rdquo; He said with a smile on his beautiful lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Hhmm&hellip; Than&hellip; Yes!!&rdquo; He stood up and raised you from the ground and spun you around.</p><h2>Draco Malfoy</h2><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>I think that he wold be so stressed about it, tbh.

Of course, he didn&rsquo;t say anything about his plan in the letter, he just said it was because he wanted to move some things and he needed &ldquo;a feminine eye&rdquo;.
