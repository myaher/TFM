        "body": "<p>Arya prepares for the last battle against the White Walkers. She hasn\u2019t found her place yet, and is filled with dread. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/43054922\">AO3</a>.</p><p>First thing\nin the morning, Arya looked for Gendry, but he was already at the forge,\nhelping out with doing some last reparations. His face had a concentrated look,\nbut he seemed to feel her gaze. He looked up and smiled, but soon bent his head\nover the forge again. Arya knew, she should not distract him. Reluctantly she\nleft him to mind his business.</p><!-- more --><p>On her way\nout, she almost ran into the Dragon queen. She bowed and said \u201cYour grace\u201d like\na proper subject. She wondered what Daenerys wanted in the forge. Jon had flown\nout scouting checking if Bran\u2019s estimate of the arrival of the army of the dead\nwas right, but not Daenerys. </p><p>It seemed\nlike everyone had something important to do. Sansa drove them all relentlessly during\nthe whole day, Ghost a permanent presence at her side. Food was transported\ninto the crypts, to last them for a few days. Samwell, the fat black brother,\nand Maester Wolkan were told to take care for the medicine and Gilly and other\nmothers invented a play for the children, so they would know to run fast for\nthe crypts. Brienne went through the motions with the soldiers twice, and only\nstopped when it was her time to guard Sansa. That old man Ser Davos directed\nthe men who distributed the wildfire. </p><p>Arya became\nincreasingly nervous over the day. A sense of dread threatened to enclose her\nwhich she had not felt before the last battle. Somehow last time, when the\nWhite Walkers had come it had been easier. Now she knew what awaited them, and although\nthe plan was set, her heart was heavy. She was trying to make up her mind,\nwhere her place would be. She felt out of place and for the first time in weeks\nshe was tempted to take one of her faces and do some spying. She knew it was no\nuse. She had no face that would be blend in with the Dothraki and she had no\nidea of the language, not to mention the Unsullied. </p><p>In between\nshe went to Gendry at the forge. He was busy every time, there was an endless\nstring of men who wanted last minute repairs, many of them Unsullied. Arya\nbrought him something to eat, so he would not have to interrupt his work. That\nwas at least something useful and she felt a bit better. They chatted for a\nwhile, Gendry munching happily on the bread she had brought. She wished this\nday would never end, she wished it was the next day already, or the day after\nthat. <i>Then I will know, if I\u2019ll be dead.</i>\nShe might not know of course. She tried to squeeze some laughter into the\nremaining hours, and she gladly listened to Gendry telling her about how he had\nactually run the City watch in King\u2019s Landing. For half an hour she forgot her\nworries and she chuckled happily at the image of Cersei being duped into\ntrusting a bastard son of King Robert. Gendry went back to work, and it was her\ntime to tell. Arya was reluctant to share all her adventures, but she told\nGendry how Sansa and herself had taken down Littlefinger.</p><p>Her mood\nsoured when Daenerys came to the forge. Again! This time, she was accompanied\nby the pretty girl that had stood by her side on the field. The Unsullied immediately\nstood to attention. Daenerys didn\u2019t seem to have a real purpose in being there.\nShe strolled idly through the room, picking up some items and discarding them.\nHer eyes kept coming back to Gendry though and she gave him a dazzling smile, that\nfilled Arya\u2019s belly with smoldering heat of annoyance. <i>Why does she smile so smug?</i> She exchanged a few words with Gendry\nand introduced him to the Unsullied. <i>She\nalready knows who he is, what is this all about? </i>Suddenly, Arya could not\nbear it any longer. She jumped up, took her leave with a barely muttered \u201cyour\nGrace\u201d and stormed off. </p><p>She went in\nsearch for Sansa, who was in her room and let herself in after a bare knock.\nBrienne greeted her with a snarl. Her hand was on the hilt of her sword. Ghost\ntrotted over, rubbed himself at her calves but took up his silent vigil at\nSansa\u2019s side again. Arya rubbed her eyes. <i>I\nwill not cry.</i></p><p>It was no\nuse, Sansa took her hand and she blurted it all out. That she felt useless, that\nshe hated Daenerys, that she was afraid to die, afraid to survive, only to lose\neveryone else, that Bran made no sense half of the time and that Daenerys had\nogled Gendry. The last was out before she could stop herself and she felt the\nblood rush to her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt is\njust\u2026 I am so nervous. Half of the time, I don\u2019t know what I am saying. Gendry\nis my friend, I don\u2019t want her near him, with her smug smile. She is up to\nsomething. I just know it.\u201d</p><p>Sansa had\nlistened and her face became serious. </p><p>\u201cDo you\nthink Daenerys knows, that Gendry is King Robert\u2019s son? I was careful not to\nmention it, but someone else might have told her.\u201d </p><p>She looked\nat Brienne. \u201cI try to avoid her as much as I can. But with his looks you\nwouldn\u2019t even need to be told.\u201d</p><p>Arya\u2019s\nheart skipped a beat.</p><p>\u201cBut he is\njust a bastard? Surely, she can\u2019t think that this means anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nexactly did she do?\u201d</p><p>Arya took a\ncalming breath and told Sansa everything she remembered and then it dawned on\nher.</p><p>\u201cShe was\nmaking sure her Unsullied know who he is,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Sansa\nnodded.</p><p>A cold hand\nextended its clammy fingers over Arya\u2019s heart. </p><p>\u201cDaenerys\nmight think that one more or less man who falls in the battle will not be\nquestioned,\u201d Brienne said. \u201cMaybe we should guard him.\u201d</p><p><i>Yes, guard him. </i>Arya wanted to shout, but she knew that Brienne\nwould be among the fighters this night. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do\nthat Arya,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cJust keep close to him. We might be mistaken, and Daenerys\njust wanted to make sure that her Unsullied have good armour.\u201d</p><p>Arya\nscoffed. \u201cNot very likely. She doesn\u2019t strike me as someone who looks after her\nmen\u2019s armour personally.\u201d</p><p>Sans took\nher sister\u2019s hand. \u201cOr do you want me to take Gendry with me? Brienne says I\ncould use more guards.\u201d </p><p>Arya shook\nher head. \u201cHe probably wouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d </p><p>There was a\nshort knock and Jon entered. He went to Sansa in long strides and took her in\nhis arms. His murmurs were too low for Arya to understand. He pressed himself\nto her as if he never wanted to let go. Then he abruptly stepped back.</p><p>\u201cGods bless\nyou, Sansa. I hope we\u2019ll see dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are\nprepared, Jon. We did everything we could. Now, we have to survive this night.\u201d</p><p>She took\nhis face in her hands and kissed him fully on the lips.

Her hand was on the hilt of her sword. Ghost\ntrotted over, rubbed himself at her calves but took up his silent vigil at\nSansa&rsquo;s side again. Arya rubbed her eyes. <i>I\nwill not cry.</i></p><p>It was no\nuse, Sansa took her hand and she blurted it all out. That she felt useless, that\nshe hated Daenerys, that she was afraid to die, afraid to survive, only to lose\neveryone else, that Bran made no sense half of the time and that Daenerys had\nogled Gendry. The last was out before she could stop herself and she felt the\nblood rush to her cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;It is\njust&hellip; I am so nervous. Half of the time, I don&rsquo;t know what I am saying. Gendry\nis my friend, I don&rsquo;t want her near him, with her smug smile. She is up to\nsomething. I just know it.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa had\nlistened and her face became serious. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you\nthink Daenerys knows, that Gendry is King Robert&rsquo;s son? I was careful not to\nmention it, but someone else might have told her.&rdquo; </p><p>She looked\nat Brienne. &ldquo;I try to avoid her as much as I can. But with his looks you\nwouldn&rsquo;t even need to be told.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s\nheart skipped a beat.</p><p>&ldquo;But he is\njust a bastard? Surely, she can&rsquo;t think that this means anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What\nexactly did she do?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya took a\ncalming breath and told Sansa everything she remembered and then it dawned on\nher.</p><p>&ldquo;She was\nmaking sure her Unsullied know who he is,&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>Sansa\nnodded.</p><p>A cold hand\nextended its clammy fingers over Arya&rsquo;s heart. </p><p>&ldquo;Daenerys\nmight think that one more or less man who falls in the battle will not be\nquestioned,&rdquo; Brienne said. &ldquo;Maybe we should guard him.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Yes, guard him. </i>Arya wanted to shout, but she knew that Brienne\nwould be among the fighters this night. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do\nthat Arya,&rdquo; Sansa said. &ldquo;Just keep close to him. We might be mistaken, and Daenerys\njust wanted to make sure that her Unsullied have good armour.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya\nscoffed. &ldquo;Not very likely. She doesn&rsquo;t strike me as someone who looks after her\nmen&rsquo;s armour personally.&rdquo;</p><p>Sans took\nher sister&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Or do you want me to take Gendry with me? Brienne says I\ncould use more guards.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya shook\nher head. &ldquo;He probably wouldn&rsquo;t want that.&rdquo; </p><p>There was a\nshort knock and Jon entered. He went to Sansa in long strides and took her in\nhis arms. His murmurs were too low for Arya to understand. He pressed himself\nto her as if he never wanted to let go. Then he abruptly stepped back.</p><p>&ldquo;Gods bless\nyou, Sansa. I hope we&rsquo;ll see dawn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We are\nprepared, Jon. We did everything we could. Now, we have to survive this night.&rdquo;</p><p>She took\nhis face in her hands and kissed him fully on the lips. Arya looked away and\nstudied her toes.</p><p>Jon turned\nto Brienne. &ldquo;I trust you have enough guards for the Queen.&rdquo; </p><p>Brienne\nnodded. Jon turned to Arya and ruffled her hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you\nstay with Sansa?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight.&rdquo;\nArya said.</p><p>Jon studied\nher. &ldquo;Just be careful.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d\nbetter do a speech to motivate people, before I am off on Rhaegal again. We\nhave an hour if not less. Will you join me?&rdquo; He exended his hand.</p><p>Sansa let\nher hand linger for a moment on the cover of her bed, as if she had a fond\nmemory she wanted to salvage. But when she left the room with Jon at her side,\nshe did not look back. Neither did Arya. Her dread stayed with her, but\nsuddenly her fear had a name, and she knew what she would do. She would ensure\nthat Gendry stayed alive.<i> Just to spite\nyou Dragon queen. If you think you can take my friend, you&rsquo;d better think\nagain.</i></p>",
