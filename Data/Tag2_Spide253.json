It was the start of fall, so the nights were always crisp with a cold that was bearable. Swinging from ledge to ledge on his way home was the only thing that was preventing him from completely losing his mind.</p><p>If I had just&hellip;</p><p>If he had just what? What could he have done to make the outcome any different? What did it even matter at this point? He had lost someone. It was tragic. The police could be approaching the door to her house at any second now, telling her family the mistake he had made. Then again, he was the only one who would ever know that it was his mistake.</p><p>He had heard her getting mugged before he had seen it. Perched on a fire escape, he turned around to see three men yelling at her, and she was fighting back. She was obviously strong-willed, but that didn&rsquo;t mean she was smart. He swung down, ready to take them on.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, fellas. I would say pick on somebody your own size, but isn&rsquo;t that a little overrated-&rdquo;</p><p>The gunshot was the loudest thing he had heard in a long time. It took him back to a vivid and traumatic moment in his life that he would never lose.</p><p>It was a strange scenario to want to be the victim of somebody&rsquo;s bullet, but this wasn&rsquo;t the first time he had been sitting in that precise scenario. The woman crumpled to the ground, violently shoving Peter&rsquo;s heart straight into his stomach. My fault.</p><p>Before he could think twice, his webs started flying, each one attaching to the faces of the muggers. To secure them, he lassoed their ankles, tying them together and stringing the bundle of bodies to a light post so they were suspended above anyone&rsquo;s head. Frantically, he rushed to the side of the woman, taking her hand and letting her head sit in his lap. Now that he had a closer look at her, she had to be in her mid-twenties, at least ten years older than him. The bullet had gone into her abdomen, and blood was pouring out at an alarming rate.</p><p>Still, with his other hand, Peter dialed 911. He spoke a million words a minute, answering the operator&rsquo;s questions hastily until they said an ambulance the police were on their way. All he wanted was to return his attention to the woman who he had let slip from his safety.</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Anna. My name is&hellip;Anna,&rdquo; she was choking the words out, begging him to hear them.</p><p>&ldquo;Anna&hellip;I&rsquo;m&hellip;&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t want his identity known. Anna was dying, but he had no idea who was passing by. Even after a month of stopping crime he hadn&rsquo;t thought of some sort of name to call his vigilante alter ego.</p><p>&ldquo;Were those&hellip;&rdquo; she coughed, &ldquo;webs? Are you some sort of spider man?&rdquo;</p><p>A lightbulb went off in his brain, &ldquo;I am. That&rsquo;s my name, actually. Spider-Man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow&hellip;a real superhero. I never thought I would-&rdquo;</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t finish the thought. She exhaled and went limp. Peter felt his body quiver and his heart rate pick up. This wasn&rsquo;t supposed to happen. He was supposed to be the hero that saved people, not the one that put others in danger. If he had just&hellip;</p><p>With great power comes great responsibility.</p><p>This technically wasn&rsquo;t the first time he had lost someone, but the fact that he now had another life on his hands was incredibly unsettling. It was traumatizing. He peeled the goggles off of his face and stared at her, lifeless. One tear rolling down his face, he shut her eyes, hoping that it would give some amount of dignity to her death.</p><p>At the first sound of sirens, Peter wrote on a notepad left in his pocket the location of her murders, as they were completely out of sight to any normal investigator. He added that her name was Anna, just in case she wasn&rsquo;t carrying her ID on her. Not wanting to feel too disrespectful, he placed it underneath her hand and rested it on her heart.</p><p>Now he was swinging, tears pouring down his face, headed home.</p><p><br /></p><p><i>tagging a few mutuals who i would appreciate feedback from</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf7aEuHNT4ysiy40FuBBwRQ\" target=\"_blank\">@rainbow-marvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAXrEaWvSfH23IXgpb802A\" target=\"_blank\">@starksmile</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlwy1zQGX8v0frk4LDIIm9g\" target=\"_blank\">@moonkissedtom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj1ozk4sSvmnpQXSzmixTlw\" target=\"_blank\">@candycornparker</a></i></p>",
