Yes, he loved both his daughters and was willing to sacrifice his honor for their safety. However, Ned sorely lacked on his relationship with Sansa. He never took the time to really get to know her.

We never see him even apologize for it. He has a doll made up for her and gives it to her as if that will heal the traumatic experience of losing a beloved pet. This is seen as a \u201cbratty\u201d moment of Sansa when she tells Ned she hasn\u2019t played with dolls since she was 8 years old. But really this is an example that Ned has no clue of her current interests and never bothered to learn them either. </p><p>But with Arya, her interest are something he\u2019s able to understand. And he is able to bring in a teacher that fits her passion. This is one of the reasons I believe he went to Arya and told her about the situation in King\u2019s Landing. He knew how to talk to her and perhaps thought she\u2019d have a better understanding of it. Unfortunately, he never gave that chance for Sansa to realize they were in danger as well. </p><p>Another major parenting mistake from Ned is using Sansa as a pawn to investigate the Lannisters under the cover of Sansa\u2019s betrothal to Joffery. After the incident at the Trident, Arya, a child even asks Ned \u201cwhy would you let her marry someone like that?\u201d And Ned, a grown ass man has no answer for her. </p><p>As for the resemblance to Lyanna, that could very well be a component in Ned\u2019s favoring of Arya. Ned does say how Arya even sometimes looks like the little sister he tragically lost. But I don\u2019t believe Sansa had to look like Lyanna in order for Ned to love her as Ned did love Sansa. I can never be 100% sure on what Sansa could have done for Ned to give her more attention. But I think it\u2019s another example of Sansa\u2019s femininity being used against her. Perhaps, if she had been more boyish like Arya, Ned would have felt he could have talked to her the way he did with Arya. </p><p>I hope that makes sense.</p><p>Thanks for the ask! </p>",

Unfortunately, he never gave that chance for Sansa to realize they were in danger as well. </p><p>Another major parenting mistake from Ned is using Sansa as a pawn to investigate the Lannisters under the cover of Sansa&rsquo;s betrothal to Joffery. After the incident at the Trident, Arya, a child even asks Ned &ldquo;why would you let her marry someone like that?&rdquo; And Ned, a grown ass man has no answer for her. </p><p>As for the resemblance to Lyanna, that could very well be a component in Ned&rsquo;s favoring of Arya. Ned does say how Arya even sometimes looks like the little sister he tragically lost. But I don&rsquo;t believe Sansa had to look like Lyanna in order for Ned to love her as Ned did love Sansa. I can never be 100% sure on what Sansa could have done for Ned to give her more attention. But I think it&rsquo;s another example of Sansa&rsquo;s femininity being used against her. Perhaps, if she had been more boyish like Arya, Ned would have felt he could have talked to her the way he did with Arya. </p><p>I hope that makes sense.</p><p>Thanks for the ask! </p>",
