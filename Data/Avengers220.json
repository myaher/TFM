Original characters.)<br/></p><p><b>Chapter Summary: </b>Tony, Rhodes and Peter get called to do recon on an old S.H.I.E.L.D. facility when one of its alarms goes off. They try to find out what\u2019s missing.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><b>Iceland - 2017</b></p><p>The low rumble of the hover jet was soothing, as was the dark ocean beneath them. It was making staying awake more difficult for the team. The low lights in the cabin illuminated the sleepy, half-asleep faces. </p><p>Peter was curled up under a blanket, discarded homework on the table in front of him. His hair had grown a little long, the front wisps trailing over his forehead. \u00a0</p><p>Rhodes was in the row behind him. The small television in front of him flashing lights across his face. He had been fading in and out of sleep the whole ride. </p><p>Tony was at the back of the plane, straining to keep his eyes open. He was looking over the schematics and blue prints of the facility they were going to. Not that there was much to look at. There were so many blank spots with no information on what was in the room. And the prints were old. About 30 years old. There was no telling if something had changed since then. </p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.\u201d Tony said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Star.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSearch for more information on Site 10034 from S.H.I.E.L.D., what they gave us is laughable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSearching. We\u2019re also 20 minutes out. Should I wake the Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and start the coffee pot. Please and thank you.\u201d</p><p>The cabin started to be filled with grunting and slow shuffles. Soon all three of them were up, mugs of coffee in their hands and looking at the plan Tony had made up. They looked as the holograms rising out of the table in the cockpit. </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cMmm, no, not for you kid. I don\u2019t want your growth stunted. Your Aunt May wouldn\u2019t like that.\u201d Tony gave Peter a stern look and took the mug, taking a sip. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Have some juice. Vitamin D is good for you. Alright F.I.D.A.Y., what did you find?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing Mr. Stark. There is no record of a Site 10034 in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s databases. All maps of the location show it as empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that makes this more interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we think is there? Weapons? Secret jail? Hydra camp?\u201d Rhodes asked.</p><p>\u201cUnknown. All S.H.I.E.L.D. knows is that its one of their old facilities and that its been compromised. They\u2019re sending agents in after we clear the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what exactly do they want us to do\u2026\u201d Peter looked around at the blank plans, an equally blank expression on his face. </p><p>\u201cRecon. Find out if there\u2019s anyone still down there and if anything\u2019s been taken.\u201d Tony walked away from the table, heading towards the back of the jet. </p><p>\u201cHow do we know if there\u2019s anything missing?\u201d Peter wondered, following close behind. </p><p>\u201cLook for a missing mantle piece. Now suit up, we\u2019ve got to drop in.\u201d </p><p>The hover jet humming was louder in the back near the drop door. All three men waited by the door for the go ahead to jump. The red light reflecting off all of their suits. Peter\u2019s new jump suit was bulkier than he was used to. He fidgeted a bit, missing the easy flexibility of his other one. </p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d Tony said, he checked the map on his wrist screen. \u201cWe\u2019re jumping in 20. Put your helmet on and get ready. You\u2019re about to fly.\u201d He closed his mask, Rhodes following his lead. </p><p>Peter took a deep breath. Shook off his nerves. He pushed his hair back. Slide on his helmet. And waited.</p><p>3. 2. 1. The green light turned on. The doors opened. And they jumped. Tony and Rhodes first, Peter a few moments later. Then, he was free falling. </p><p>Iceland was below them, a few lights visible down on the ground. Air rushed by him, but he could barely feel it through his suit. He looked around. Feeling so small compared to everything that was below him. He was amazed. He took a few moments to enjoy the view, before turning his attention to the ground below him.</p><p>\u201cKaren, h-how\u2019re doing?\u201d His helmet\u2019s screen lit up, showing his altitude, speed and mapping the route to the drop point. </p><p>\u201cRight on target.\u201d Peter stayed on course. Going through all the steps he was taught during his sky diving training. He could see his landing point. Tony and Rhodes were already on the ground, lighting it up for him. He was getting closer and closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. I can do this. I\u2019m not going to fall like in training.\u201d He said to himself. </p><p>\u201cGood luck Peter.\u201d Karen responded.</p><p>He released his parachute, and got pulled back up. He reached his legs towards the ground, and started to run along, burning off his momentum. He was 20 feet from the others when his toe got caught. He rolled the rest of the way to Tony\u2019s feet, getting wrapped up in his parachute. </p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d Peter squeaked. Tony look down at him, his mask pulled down and a blank expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cDid you get that?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cOh ya.\u201d Rhodes answered, his suit\u2019s camera on and pointing at Peter.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Add it to the montage.\u201d Tony laughed as he helped Peter get up. Once he was untangled they headed towards the site. </p><p>The valley they were in had no visible buildings. Darkness stretched out in front of them, the lights from the urban areas long gone. The low glow from the iron suits providing the only light. The stars shone down brightly, twinkling as they walked on. </p><p>\u201cSo where is it? Is what\u2019s got taken the whole building!? Did they Ant-man it?\u201d Peter wondered, excitement lacing his voice. </p><p>Tony lifted up his arm, scanning the area. A series of red beams glided over the landscape before displaying that nothing was found. \u201cWell that\u2019s not good.\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\u201cIs it just me, or is this starting to feel like a trap?\u201d Rhodes said, opening his helmet\u2019s mask. </p><p>\u201cEither that or a really bad prank.\u201d Tony continued to walk on, looking around the grass. \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., scan for disturbances in the dirt and grass.\u201d He lifted his arm and scanned the area again. This time a dozen places were identified. \u201cSomeone has definitely been here recently.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs there anything in particular we should be looking for?\u201d Rhodes walked over to Tony looking at the disturbance pattern that was on the hologram. </p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d Tony activated his boosters, and rose into the air. \u201cStand back.\u201d He lifted his hand, then began to incinerate all the grass in the area. Within a few minutes the whole area was clear of grass. </p><p>\u201cMmm. Let\u2019s try this again.\u201d Tony performed a final scan. This time the whole area lit up. Tony looked at the ground beneath his feet. He pondered for a second before blasting into the ground. An explosion knocked him back several feet. Rhodes and Peter rushing over, alert and ready for whatever it might be. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Rhodes asked.</p><p>Tony got back to his feet, then walked straight to the hole in the ground. The three men slowly peered down, unsure of what they were going to find. Beneath the dissipating smoke was a metallic slab that disappeared into the soil. </p><p>\u201cI think we found the building.\u201d Peter whispered. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to the bottom of this.\u201d Tony placed a small round device on the top of the metal slab. It beeped to life and began to emit short beams all along the slab and into the soil.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that doing? What if the metal explodes again?\u201d Peter asked, taking a step back form the hole. </p><p>\u201cIts a scanner. It will tell us what part of the building this is and we can compare it to our subpar plans. Maybe then we can find a door.\u201d Tony looked at his holographic map as the device beeped. The building blue print came up, highlighting the portion of the building they seemed to be on top of. Tony waved his hand, highlighting the entrances. A single surface one was displayed and two underground ones, presumably connected to tunnels or other buildings they didn\u2019t have the plans to. \u201cThere\u2019s the bugger.\u201d </p><p>They hurried over to where the entrance should be, making quick work of the soil covering it with their lasers. In a few moments Tony lifter his hand, signalling them to stop. \u201cNot any deeper, we don\u2019t want a repeat explosion.\u201d The team switched to air blasters and in a few minutes they had found a trap door.</p><p>They stared at it for a moment. Unsure if they should touch it. A quick scan revealed nothing.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s not surprising. Here goes nothing.\u201d Tony reached down for the handle, twisted it and opened the door. A hiss of air came out, releasing the seal that had been holding it shut. They peered down, finding a dark flight of stairs. Tony lead the way as they began to descent down the stairs. Lights turned on once Tony reached the bottom. They were standing in a short white hall, another door with a passcode at the end. Along the display they could read the words \u201cDisarmed-Failure Sector 9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that settles it. Something definitely happened here. Be on high alert.\u201d Tony grabbed the handle and twisted the door. He stepped out onto a catwalk, a tidy common space beneath them. All of the furniture was in good condition, with not even a layer of dust on it. There were sets of couches, a small kitchenette and dinning table. Bookshelves ran along one wall, reaching all the way to the celling. There was a ping-pong table in the far corner, with a chalkboard on the wall next to it. The board had names and game scores recorded on it of an unfinished tournament. </p><p>\u201cThis is not what I expected.\u201d Rhodes said, looking towards a piano that was right below the cat walk. Christmas sheet music was still on the stand. </p><p>\u201cIts so homey. Oh! Look at that!\u201d Peter pointed towards the ceiling. A series of ropes and monkey bars were hanging down, as well as a few hammocks. \u201cThis is so cool!\u201d He reached out his arm, ready to shoot a web.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Tony held Peter\u2019s arm down. \u201cNot until we clear the building.\u201d</p><p>Peter slouched down, his disappointment not hidden by his helmet. Tony went back to the door and connected to the facility\u2019s system. In a few moments he had the seemingly complete floor plan, divided into nine sectors. </p><p>\u201cAlright team. It looks like we have to go through most of the sectors before we get to nine. Let\u2019s make quick work of this.\u201d He sent the plans to the other two and then they were off, making their way through the facility.</p><p>Off the common room they found two hallways with dorm like bedrooms coming off them. Neat and tidy, with very few personal items. Past the catwalk they went down another set of stairs and into another hall. There they found what looked like classrooms, and a gymnasium and workout space. Further in were more bedrooms, a movie theatre, kitchen, mess hall and laundry room. All were in good condition, and spotless, as if someone had just cleaned the spaces. </p><p>\u201cAre we sure this was S.H.I.E.L.D.? It feels more like a weird family bunker.\u201d Rhodes noted as he picked up a book that had been left open on a table. They were in the library. It covered three floors with a large atrium in the middle.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only covered three sectors. It still has time to get weird.\u201d Tony said, watching as Peter swung from floor to floor, looking at the titles of the books. He was having way too much fun.</p><p>They continued down the hall, reaching a set of industrial doors with \u2018Sector 4\u2019 written across them. Tony pushed against the doors, and they didn\u2019t budge. There was no handle or knob to turn. Looking around Tony was confused, until the doors slid open in front of him. He looked over at Rhodes who had pushed the open button next to the door. </p><p>Stepping inside the team found themselves in a stark white hallway, with clinical lights over head. The door slid shut behind them, sealing with a distinct suction sound. There were four doors on each side of the hall, with numbers on each. As they walked past they could see patient rooms, each with a bed and its own set of medical equipment. A nurses\u2019 station was at the end of the hall and another door. Through this one they found operating rooms, most of the equipment old and outdated but still in working order. They also found labs, offices and storage rooms.</p><p>\u201cAll clear in here too.\u201d Rhodes reported back after looking over the physical therapy and rehab spaces. Tony and Peter had finished looking over the labs, and were waiting in front of the sector nine door.</p><p>\u201cOnly one more place to check.\u201d \u00a0Tony said reaching towards the key pad that controlled the single door. It was shorter than the others, Tony and Rhodes would have to crouch down to enter. It was also marked with danger tape around its outline and protective gear lined a small closet next to it. There was nothing indicating what they might find behind the door.</p><p>They waited a moment, as the door got unlocked, a small ping signalling its opening. The seal broke, and the door sunk back into its frame before sliding to the side. Inside they could see another vacuum sealed door, with another key pad next to it. </p><p>\u201cSeal your suits, and turn on your air masks. Be on high alert. We have no clue what\u2019s past those doors.\u201d They stepped into the space. Rhodes pressed the close button on the first door. The room sealed shut. Tony walked up to the next key pad, and pressed the enter button. The room\u2019s air changed, becoming colder and thinner. The sensors on the suits adjusted, keeping the three men warm and breathing easily. Then the door opened. </p><p>Blue light covered the small room. It had two low tables and instruments and equipment lining the walls. Tony quickly scanned the space. They were alone. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check the back space. This is the area that was taking up the most energy of the whole facility.\u201d Tony led the way to the door at the back of the room. Pushing it open he found a large space, the same blue light filling the room. Along the walls were cylindrical tubes, each with their top covers opened to show a mat and a variety of wires and tubes.</p><p>Tony stepped in, looking more closely at each device. </p><p>\u201cWhat are these? Is there supposed to be something in these? Is this an empty mantle piece?\u201d Peter asked, looking closely at one of the beds.</p><p>\u201cAre these what I think they are, Tony?\u201d Rhodes asked, swinging one of the lids shut.</p><p>\u201cCryogenic tubes.\u201d Tony replied. </p><p>\u201cCryogenic tubes? Why would S.H.I.E.LD. need those?\u201d Peter asked, walking over to Tony. </p><p>\u201cTo keep super soldiers alive.\u201d Tony pointed to the wall. A small photo and identification card was above the cryogenic tube. </p><p>Katherine Adams<br/>Birthday: December 30, 1935<br/>Physical Age: 22<br/>Serum #: 132<br/></p><p><a href=\"https://avengers-generation.tumblr.com/post/178770451362/generationsprologue\">Prologue</a></p><p><strike>Chapter 2</strike></p>",

Then, he was free falling. </p><p>Iceland was below them, a few lights visible down on the ground. Air rushed by him, but he could barely feel it through his suit. He looked around. Feeling so small compared to everything that was below him. He was amazed. He took a few moments to enjoy the view, before turning his attention to the ground below him.</p><p>\u201cKaren, h-how\u2019re doing?\u201d His helmet\u2019s screen lit up, showing his altitude, speed and mapping the route to the drop point. </p><p>\u201cRight on target.\u201d Peter stayed on course. Going through all the steps he was taught during his sky diving training. He could see his landing point. Tony and Rhodes were already on the ground, lighting it up for him. He was getting closer and closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. I can do this. I\u2019m not going to fall like in training.\u201d He said to himself. </p><p>\u201cGood luck Peter.\u201d Karen responded.</p><p>He released his parachute, and got pulled back up. He reached his legs towards the ground, and started to run along, burning off his momentum. He was 20 feet from the others when his toe got caught. He rolled the rest of the way to Tony\u2019s feet, getting wrapped up in his parachute. </p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d Peter squeaked. Tony look down at him, his mask pulled down and a blank expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cDid you get that?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cOh ya.\u201d Rhodes answered, his suit\u2019s camera on and pointing at Peter.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Add it to the montage.\u201d Tony laughed as he helped Peter get up. Once he was untangled they headed towards the site. </p><p>The valley they were in had no visible buildings. Darkness stretched out in front of them, the lights from the urban areas long gone. The low glow from the iron suits providing the only light. The stars shone down brightly, twinkling as they walked on. </p><p>\u201cSo where is it? Is what\u2019s got taken the whole building!? Did they Ant-man it?\u201d Peter wondered, excitement lacing his voice. </p><p>Tony lifted up his arm, scanning the area. A series of red beams glided over the landscape before displaying that nothing was found. \u201cWell that\u2019s not good.\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\u201cIs it just me, or is this starting to feel like a trap?\u201d Rhodes said, opening his helmet\u2019s mask. </p><p>\u201cEither that or a really bad prank.\u201d Tony continued to walk on, looking around the grass. \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., scan for disturbances in the dirt and grass.\u201d He lifted his arm and scanned the area again. This time a dozen places were identified. \u201cSomeone has definitely been here recently.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs there anything in particular we should be looking for?\u201d Rhodes walked over to Tony looking at the disturbance pattern that was on the hologram. </p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d Tony activated his boosters, and rose into the air. \u201cStand back.\u201d He lifted his hand, then began to incinerate all the grass in the area. Within a few minutes the whole area was clear of grass. </p><p>\u201cMmm. Let\u2019s try this again.\u201d Tony performed a final scan. This time the whole area lit up. Tony looked at the ground beneath his feet. He pondered for a second before blasting into the ground. An explosion knocked him back several feet. Rhodes and Peter rushing over, alert and ready for whatever it might be. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Rhodes asked.</p><p>Tony got back to his feet, then walked straight to the hole in the ground. The three men slowly peered down, unsure of what they were going to find. Beneath the dissipating smoke was a metallic slab that disappeared into the soil. </p><p>\u201cI think we found the building.\u201d Peter whispered. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to the bottom of this.\u201d Tony placed a small round device on the top of the metal slab. It beeped to life and began to emit short beams all along the slab and into the soil.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that doing? What if the metal explodes again?\u201d Peter asked, taking a step back form the hole. </p><p>\u201cIts a scanner. It will tell us what part of the building this is and we can compare it to our subpar plans. Maybe then we can find a door.\u201d Tony looked at his holographic map as the device beeped. The building blue print came up, highlighting the portion of the building they seemed to be on top of. Tony waved his hand, highlighting the entrances. A single surface one was displayed and two underground ones, presumably connected to tunnels or other buildings they didn\u2019t have the plans to. \u201cThere\u2019s the bugger.\u201d </p><p>They hurried over to where the entrance should be, making quick work of the soil covering it with their lasers. In a few moments Tony lifter his hand, signalling them to stop. \u201cNot any deeper, we don\u2019t want a repeat explosion.\u201d The team switched to air blasters and in a few minutes they had found a trap door.</p><p>They stared at it for a moment. Unsure if they should touch it. A quick scan revealed nothing.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s not surprising. Here goes nothing.\u201d Tony reached down for the handle, twisted it and opened the door. A hiss of air came out, releasing the seal that had been holding it shut. They peered down, finding a dark flight of stairs. Tony lead the way as they began to descent down the stairs. Lights turned on once Tony reached the bottom. They were standing in a short white hall, another door with a passcode at the end. Along the display they could read the words \u201cDisarmed-Failure Sector 9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that settles it. Something definitely happened here. Be on high alert.\u201d Tony grabbed the handle and twisted the door. He stepped out onto a catwalk, a tidy common space beneath them. All of the furniture was in good condition, with not even a layer of dust on it. There were sets of couches, a small kitchenette and dinning table. Bookshelves ran along one wall, reaching all the way to the celling. There was a ping-pong table in the far corner, with a chalkboard on the wall next to it. The board had names and game scores recorded on it of an unfinished tournament. </p><p>\u201cThis is not what I expected.\u201d Rhodes said, looking towards a piano that was right below the cat walk. Christmas sheet music was still on the stand. </p><p>\u201cIts so homey. Oh! Look at that!\u201d Peter pointed towards the ceiling. A series of ropes and monkey bars were hanging down, as well as a few hammocks. \u201cThis is so cool!\u201d He reached out his arm, ready to shoot a web.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Tony held Peter\u2019s arm down. \u201cNot until we clear the building.\u201d</p><p>Peter slouched down, his disappointment not hidden by his helmet. Tony went back to the door and connected to the facility\u2019s system. In a few moments he had the seemingly complete floor plan, divided into nine sectors. </p><p>\u201cAlright team. It looks like we have to go through most of the sectors before we get to nine. Let\u2019s make quick work of this.\u201d He sent the plans to the other two and then they were off, making their way through the facility.</p><p>Off the common room they found two hallways with dorm like bedrooms coming off them. Neat and tidy, with very few personal items. Past the catwalk they went down another set of stairs and into another hall. There they found what looked like classrooms, and a gymnasium and workout space. Further in were more bedrooms, a movie theatre, kitchen, mess hall and laundry room. All were in good condition, and spotless, as if someone had just cleaned the spaces. </p><p>\u201cAre we sure this was S.H.I.E.L.D.? It feels more like a weird family bunker.\u201d Rhodes noted as he picked up a book that had been left open on a table. They were in the library. It covered three floors with a large atrium in the middle.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only covered three sectors. It still has time to get weird.\u201d Tony said, watching as Peter swung from floor to floor, looking at the titles of the books. He was having way too much fun.</p><p>They continued down the hall, reaching a set of industrial doors with \u2018Sector 4\u2019 written across them. Tony pushed against the doors, and they didn\u2019t budge. There was no handle or knob to turn. Looking around Tony was confused, until the doors slid open in front of him. He looked over at Rhodes who had pushed the open button next to the door. </p><p>Stepping inside the team found themselves in a stark white hallway, with clinical lights over head. The door slid shut behind them, sealing with a distinct suction sound. There were four doors on each side of the hall, with numbers on each. As they walked past they could see patient rooms, each with a bed and its own set of medical equipment. A nurses\u2019 station was at the end of the hall and another door. Through this one they found operating rooms, most of the equipment old and outdated but still in working order. They also found labs, offices and storage rooms.</p><p>\u201cAll clear in here too.\u201d Rhodes reported back after looking over the physical therapy and rehab spaces. Tony and Peter had finished looking over the labs, and were waiting in front of the sector nine door.</p><p>\u201cOnly one more place to check.\u201d \u00a0Tony said reaching towards the key pad that controlled the single door. It was shorter than the others, Tony and Rhodes would have to crouch down to enter. It was also marked with danger tape around its outline and protective gear lined a small closet next to it. There was nothing indicating what they might find behind the door.</p><p>They waited a moment, as the door got unlocked, a small ping signalling its opening. The seal broke, and the door sunk back into its frame before sliding to the side. Inside they could see another vacuum sealed door, with another key pad next to it. </p><p>\u201cSeal your suits, and turn on your air masks. Be on high alert. We have no clue what\u2019s past those doors.\u201d They stepped into the space. Rhodes pressed the close button on the first door. The room sealed shut. Tony walked up to the next key pad, and pressed the enter button. The room\u2019s air changed, becoming colder and thinner. The sensors on the suits adjusted, keeping the three men warm and breathing easily. Then the door opened. </p><p>Blue light covered the small room. It had two low tables and instruments and equipment lining the walls. Tony quickly scanned the space. They were alone. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check the back space. This is the area that was taking up the most energy of the whole facility.\u201d Tony led the way to the door at the back of the room. Pushing it open he found a large space, the same blue light filling the room. Along the walls were cylindrical tubes, each with their top covers opened to show a mat and a variety of wires and tubes.</p><p>Tony stepped in, looking more closely at each device. </p><p>\u201cWhat are these? Is there supposed to be something in these? Is this an empty mantle piece?\u201d Peter asked, looking closely at one of the beds.</p><p>\u201cAre these what I think they are, Tony?\u201d Rhodes asked, swinging one of the lids shut.</p><p>\u201cCryogenic tubes.\u201d Tony replied. </p><p>\u201cCryogenic tubes? Why would S.H.I.E.LD. need those?\u201d Peter asked, walking over to Tony. </p><p>\u201cTo keep super soldiers alive.\u201d Tony pointed to the wall. A small photo and identification card was above the cryogenic tube. </p><p>Katherine Adams<br>Birthday: December 30, 1935<br>Physical Age: 22<br>Serum #: 132<br></p><p><a href=\"https://avengers-generation.tumblr.com/post/178770451362/generationsprologue\">Prologue</a></p><p><strike>Chapter 2</strike></p>",

In the 1950s, some of these attempts were a success. (Taking place post \u201cCivil War\u201d. Original characters.)<br></p><p><b>Chapter Summary: </b>Tony, Rhodes and Peter get called to do recon on an old S.H.I.E.L.D. facility when one of its alarms goes off. They try to find out what\u2019s missing.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><b>Iceland - 2017</b></p><p>The low rumble of the hover jet was soothing, as was the dark ocean beneath them. It was making staying awake more difficult for the team. The low lights in the cabin illuminated the sleepy, half-asleep faces. </p><p>Peter was curled up under a blanket, discarded homework on the table in front of him. His hair had grown a little long, the front wisps trailing over his forehead. \u00a0</p><p>Rhodes was in the row behind him. The small television in front of him flashing lights across his face. He had been fading in and out of sleep the whole ride. </p><p>Tony was at the back of the plane, straining to keep his eyes open. He was looking over the schematics and blue prints of the facility they were going to. Not that there was much to look at. There were so many blank spots with no information on what was in the room. And the prints were old. About 30 years old. There was no telling if something had changed since then. </p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.\u201d Tony said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Star.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSearch for more information on Site 10034 from S.H.I.E.L.D., what they gave us is laughable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSearching. We\u2019re also 20 minutes out. Should I wake the Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and start the coffee pot. Please and thank you.\u201d</p><p>The cabin started to be filled with grunting and slow shuffles. Soon all three of them were up, mugs of coffee in their hands and looking at the plan Tony had made up. They looked as the holograms rising out of the table in the cockpit. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cMmm, no, not for you kid. I don\u2019t want your growth stunted. Your Aunt May wouldn\u2019t like that.\u201d Tony gave Peter a stern look and took the mug, taking a sip. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Have some juice. Vitamin D is good for you. Alright F.I.D.A.Y., what did you find?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing Mr. Stark. There is no record of a Site 10034 in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s databases. All maps of the location show it as empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that makes this more interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we think is there? Weapons? Secret jail? Hydra camp?\u201d Rhodes asked.</p><p>\u201cUnknown. All S.H.I.E.L.D. knows is that its one of their old facilities and that its been compromised. They\u2019re sending agents in after we clear the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what exactly do they want us to do\u2026\u201d Peter looked around at the blank plans, an equally blank expression on his face. </p><p>\u201cRecon. Find out if there\u2019s anyone still down there and if anything\u2019s been taken.\u201d Tony walked away from the table, heading towards the back of the jet. </p><p>\u201cHow do we know if there\u2019s anything missing?\u201d Peter wondered, following close behind. </p><p>\u201cLook for a missing mantle piece. Now suit up, we\u2019ve got to drop in.\u201d </p><p>The hover jet humming was louder in the back near the drop door. All three men waited by the door for the go ahead to jump. The red light reflecting off all of their suits. Peter\u2019s new jump suit was bulkier than he was used to. He fidgeted a bit, missing the easy flexibility of his other one. </p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d Tony said, he checked the map on his wrist screen. \u201cWe\u2019re jumping in 20. Put your helmet on and get ready. You\u2019re about to fly.\u201d He closed his mask, Rhodes following his lead. </p><p>Peter took a deep breath. Shook off his nerves. He pushed his hair back.

Neat and tidy, with very few personal items. Past the catwalk they went down another set of stairs and into another hall. There they found what looked like classrooms, and a gymnasium and workout space. Further in were more bedrooms, a movie theatre, kitchen, mess hall and laundry room. All were in good condition, and spotless, as if someone had just cleaned the spaces. </p><p>\u201cAre we sure this was S.H.I.E.L.D.? It feels more like a weird family bunker.\u201d Rhodes noted as he picked up a book that had been left open on a table. They were in the library. It covered three floors with a large atrium in the middle.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only covered three sectors. It still has time to get weird.\u201d Tony said, watching as Peter swung from floor to floor, looking at the titles of the books. He was having way too much fun.</p><p>They continued down the hall, reaching a set of industrial doors with \u2018Sector 4\u2019 written across them. Tony pushed against the doors, and they didn\u2019t budge. There was no handle or knob to turn. Looking around Tony was confused, until the doors slid open in front of him. He looked over at Rhodes who had pushed the open button next to the door. </p><p>Stepping inside the team found themselves in a stark white hallway, with clinical lights over head. The door slid shut behind them, sealing with a distinct suction sound. There were four doors on each side of the hall, with numbers on each. As they walked past they could see patient rooms, each with a bed and its own set of medical equipment. A nurses\u2019 station was at the end of the hall and another door. Through this one they found operating rooms, most of the equipment old and outdated but still in working order. They also found labs, offices and storage rooms.</p><p>\u201cAll clear in here too.\u201d Rhodes reported back after looking over the physical therapy and rehab spaces. Tony and Peter had finished looking over the labs, and were waiting in front of the sector nine door.</p><p>\u201cOnly one more place to check.\u201d \u00a0Tony said reaching towards the key pad that controlled the single door. It was shorter than the others, Tony and Rhodes would have to crouch down to enter. It was also marked with danger tape around its outline and protective gear lined a small closet next to it. There was nothing indicating what they might find behind the door.</p><p>They waited a moment, as the door got unlocked, a small ping signalling its opening. The seal broke, and the door sunk back into its frame before sliding to the side. Inside they could see another vacuum sealed door, with another key pad next to it. </p><p>\u201cSeal your suits, and turn on your air masks. Be on high alert. We have no clue what\u2019s past those doors.\u201d They stepped into the space. Rhodes pressed the close button on the first door. The room sealed shut. Tony walked up to the next key pad, and pressed the enter button. The room\u2019s air changed, becoming colder and thinner. The sensors on the suits adjusted, keeping the three men warm and breathing easily. Then the door opened. </p><p>Blue light covered the small room. It had two low tables and instruments and equipment lining the walls. Tony quickly scanned the space. They were alone. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check the back space. This is the area that was taking up the most energy of the whole facility.\u201d Tony led the way to the door at the back of the room. Pushing it open he found a large space, the same blue light filling the room. Along the walls were cylindrical tubes, each with their top covers opened to show a mat and a variety of wires and tubes.</p><p>Tony stepped in, looking more closely at each device. </p><p>\u201cWhat are these? Is there supposed to be something in these? Is this an empty mantle piece?\u201d Peter asked, looking closely at one of the beds.</p><p>\u201cAre these what I think they are, Tony?\u201d Rhodes asked, swinging one of the lids shut.</p><p>\u201cCryogenic tubes.\u201d Tony replied. </p><p>\u201cCryogenic tubes? Why would S.H.I.E.LD. need those?\u201d Peter asked, walking over to Tony. </p><p>\u201cTo keep super soldiers alive.\u201d Tony pointed to the wall. A small photo and identification card was above the cryogenic tube. </p><p>Katherine Adams<br>Birthday: December 30, 1935<br>Physical Age: 22<br>Serum #: 132<br></p><p><a href=\"https://avengers-generation.tumblr.com/post/178770451362/generationsprologue\">Prologue</a></p><p><strike>Chapter 2</strike></p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Summary:&nbsp;</b>After the creation of Captain America, many attempts have been made to re-create the super-soldier serum. In the 1950s, some of these attempts were a success. (Taking place post &ldquo;Civil War&rdquo;. Original characters.)<br /></p><p><b>Chapter Summary: </b>Tony, Rhodes and Peter get called to do recon on an old S.H.I.E.L.D. facility when one of its alarms goes off. They try to find out what&rsquo;s missing.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><b>Iceland - 2017</b></p><p>The low rumble of the hover jet was soothing, as was the dark ocean beneath them. It was making staying awake more difficult for the team. The low lights in the cabin illuminated the sleepy, half-asleep faces. </p><p>Peter was curled up under a blanket, discarded homework on the table in front of him. His hair had grown a little long, the front wisps trailing over his forehead. &nbsp;</p><p>Rhodes was in the row behind him. The small television in front of him flashing lights across his face. He had been fading in and out of sleep the whole ride. </p><p>Tony was at the back of the plane, straining to keep his eyes open. He was looking over the schematics and blue prints of the facility they were going to. Not that there was much to look at. There were so many blank spots with no information on what was in the room. And the prints were old. About 30 years old. There was no telling if something had changed since then. </p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y.&rdquo; Tony said quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Star.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Search for more information on Site 10034 from S.H.I.E.L.D., what they gave us is laughable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Searching. We&rsquo;re also 20 minutes out. Should I wake the Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Parker?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and start the coffee pot. Please and thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>The cabin started to be filled with grunting and slow shuffles. Soon all three of them were up, mugs of coffee in their hands and looking at the plan Tony had made up. They looked as the holograms rising out of the table in the cockpit. </p><p>&ldquo;Mmm, no, not for you kid. I don&rsquo;t want your growth stunted. Your Aunt May wouldn&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo; Tony gave Peter a stern look and took the mug, taking a sip. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Have some juice. Vitamin D is good for you. Alright F.I.D.A.Y., what did you find?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing Mr. Stark. There is no record of a Site 10034 in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.&rsquo;s databases. All maps of the location show it as empty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that makes this more interesting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what do we think is there? Weapons? Secret jail? Hydra camp?&rdquo; Rhodes asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Unknown. All S.H.I.E.L.D. knows is that its one of their old facilities and that its been compromised. They&rsquo;re sending agents in after we clear the area.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what exactly do they want us to do&hellip;&rdquo; Peter looked around at the blank plans, an equally blank expression on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Recon. Find out if there&rsquo;s anyone still down there and if anything&rsquo;s been taken.&rdquo; Tony walked away from the table, heading towards the back of the jet. </p><p>&ldquo;How do we know if there&rsquo;s anything missing?&rdquo; Peter wondered, following close behind. </p><p>&ldquo;Look for a missing mantle piece. Now suit up, we&rsquo;ve got to drop in.&rdquo; </p><p>The hover jet humming was louder in the back near the drop door. All three men waited by the door for the go ahead to jump. The red light reflecting off all of their suits. Peter&rsquo;s new jump suit was bulkier than he was used to. He fidgeted a bit, missing the easy flexibility of his other one. </p><p>&ldquo;Stop that.&rdquo; Tony said, he checked the map on his wrist screen. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re jumping in 20. Put your helmet on and get ready. You&rsquo;re about to fly.&rdquo; He closed his mask, Rhodes following his lead. </p><p>Peter took a deep breath. Shook off his nerves. He pushed his hair back. Slide on his helmet. And waited.</p><p>3. 2. 1. The green light turned on. The doors opened. And they jumped. Tony and Rhodes first, Peter a few moments later. Then, he was free falling. </p><p>Iceland was below them, a few lights visible down on the ground. Air rushed by him, but he could barely feel it through his suit. He looked around. Feeling so small compared to everything that was below him. He was amazed. He took a few moments to enjoy the view, before turning his attention to the ground below him.</p><p>&ldquo;Karen, h-how&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; His helmet&rsquo;s screen lit up, showing his altitude, speed and mapping the route to the drop point. </p><p>&ldquo;Right on target.&rdquo; Peter stayed on course. Going through all the steps he was taught during his sky diving training. He could see his landing point. Tony and Rhodes were already on the ground, lighting it up for him. He was getting closer and closer.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready. I can do this. I&rsquo;m not going to fall like in training.&rdquo; He said to himself. </p><p>&ldquo;Good luck Peter.&rdquo; Karen responded.</p><p>He released his parachute, and got pulled back up. He reached his legs towards the ground, and started to run along, burning off his momentum. He was 20 feet from the others when his toe got caught. He rolled the rest of the way to Tony&rsquo;s feet, getting wrapped up in his parachute. </p><p>&ldquo;Ow.&rdquo; Peter squeaked. Tony look down at him, his mask pulled down and a blank expression on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you get that?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh ya.&rdquo; Rhodes answered, his suit&rsquo;s camera on and pointing at Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect. Add it to the montage.&rdquo; Tony laughed as he helped Peter get up. Once he was untangled they headed towards the site. </p><p>The valley they were in had no visible buildings. Darkness stretched out in front of them, the lights from the urban areas long gone. The low glow from the iron suits providing the only light. The stars shone down brightly, twinkling as they walked on. </p><p>&ldquo;So where is it? Is what&rsquo;s got taken the whole building!? Did they Ant-man it?&rdquo; Peter wondered, excitement lacing his voice. </p><p>Tony lifted up his arm, scanning the area. A series of red beams glided over the landscape before displaying that nothing was found. &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s not good.&rdquo; Tony said.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it just me, or is this starting to feel like a trap?&rdquo; Rhodes said, opening his helmet&rsquo;s mask. </p><p>&ldquo;Either that or a really bad prank.&rdquo; Tony continued to walk on, looking around the grass. &ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y., scan for disturbances in the dirt and grass.&rdquo; He lifted his arm and scanned the area again. This time a dozen places were identified. &ldquo;Someone has definitely been here recently.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is there anything in particular we should be looking for?&rdquo; Rhodes walked over to Tony looking at the disturbance pattern that was on the hologram. </p><p>&ldquo;Only one way to find out.&rdquo; Tony activated his boosters, and rose into the air. &ldquo;Stand back.&rdquo; He lifted his hand, then began to incinerate all the grass in the area. Within a few minutes the whole area was clear of grass. </p><p>&ldquo;Mmm. Let&rsquo;s try this again.&rdquo; Tony performed a final scan. This time the whole area lit up. Tony looked at the ground beneath his feet. He pondered for a second before blasting into the ground. An explosion knocked him back several feet. Rhodes and Peter rushing over, alert and ready for whatever it might be. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell was that?&rdquo; Rhodes asked.</p><p>Tony got back to his feet, then walked straight to the hole in the ground. The three men slowly peered down, unsure of what they were going to find. Beneath the dissipating smoke was a metallic slab that disappeared into the soil. </p><p>&ldquo;I think we found the building.&rdquo; Peter whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to the bottom of this.&rdquo; Tony placed a small round device on the top of the metal slab. It beeped to life and began to emit short beams all along the slab and into the soil.</p><p>&ldquo;What is that doing? What if the metal explodes again?&rdquo; Peter asked, taking a step back form the hole. </p><p>&ldquo;Its a scanner. It will tell us what part of the building this is and we can compare it to our subpar plans. Maybe then we can find a door.&rdquo; Tony looked at his holographic map as the device beeped. The building blue print came up, highlighting the portion of the building they seemed to be on top of. Tony waved his hand, highlighting the entrances. A single surface one was displayed and two underground ones, presumably connected to tunnels or other buildings they didn&rsquo;t have the plans to. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the bugger.&rdquo; </p><p>They hurried over to where the entrance should be, making quick work of the soil covering it with their lasers. In a few moments Tony lifter his hand, signalling them to stop. &ldquo;Not any deeper, we don&rsquo;t want a repeat explosion.&rdquo; The team switched to air blasters and in a few minutes they had found a trap door.</p><p>They stared at it for a moment. Unsure if they should touch it. A quick scan revealed nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s not surprising. Here goes nothing.&rdquo; Tony reached down for the handle, twisted it and opened the door. A hiss of air came out, releasing the seal that had been holding it shut. They peered down, finding a dark flight of stairs. Tony lead the way as they began to descent down the stairs. Lights turned on once Tony reached the bottom. They were standing in a short white hall, another door with a passcode at the end. Along the display they could read the words &ldquo;Disarmed-Failure Sector 9.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well that settles it. Something definitely happened here. Be on high alert.&rdquo; Tony grabbed the handle and twisted the door. He stepped out onto a catwalk, a tidy common space beneath them. All of the furniture was in good condition, with not even a layer of dust on it. There were sets of couches, a small kitchenette and dinning table. Bookshelves ran along one wall, reaching all the way to the celling. There was a ping-pong table in the far corner, with a chalkboard on the wall next to it. The board had names and game scores recorded on it of an unfinished tournament. </p><p>&ldquo;This is not what I expected.&rdquo; Rhodes said, looking towards a piano that was right below the cat walk. Christmas sheet music was still on the stand. </p><p>&ldquo;Its so homey. Oh! Look at that!&rdquo; Peter pointed towards the ceiling. A series of ropes and monkey bars were hanging down, as well as a few hammocks. &ldquo;This is so cool!&rdquo; He reached out his arm, ready to shoot a web.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Tony held Peter&rsquo;s arm down. &ldquo;Not until we clear the building.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter slouched down, his disappointment not hidden by his helmet. Tony went back to the door and connected to the facility&rsquo;s system. In a few moments he had the seemingly complete floor plan, divided into nine sectors. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright team. It looks like we have to go through most of the sectors before we get to nine. Let&rsquo;s make quick work of this.&rdquo; He sent the plans to the other two and then they were off, making their way through the facility.</p><p>Off the common room they found two hallways with dorm like bedrooms coming off them. Neat and tidy, with very few personal items. Past the catwalk they went down another set of stairs and into another hall. There they found what looked like classrooms, and a gymnasium and workout space. Further in were more bedrooms, a movie theatre, kitchen, mess hall and laundry room. All were in good condition, and spotless, as if someone had just cleaned the spaces. </p><p>&ldquo;Are we sure this was S.H.I.E.L.D.? It feels more like a weird family bunker.&rdquo; Rhodes noted as he picked up a book that had been left open on a table. They were in the library. It covered three floors with a large atrium in the middle.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only covered three sectors.

Through this one they found operating rooms, most of the equipment old and outdated but still in working order. They also found labs, offices and storage rooms.</p><p>&ldquo;All clear in here too.&rdquo; Rhodes reported back after looking over the physical therapy and rehab spaces. Tony and Peter had finished looking over the labs, and were waiting in front of the sector nine door.</p><p>&ldquo;Only one more place to check.&rdquo; &nbsp;Tony said reaching towards the key pad that controlled the single door.
