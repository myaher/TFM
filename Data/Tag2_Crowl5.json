        "body": "<h1>new eden</h1><p>The gardens were burning. Decades worth of work lost to the gnashing teeth of death, the boiling licks of flame. Mithridates and his army had taken the city, determined to burn it to the ground if they had to. And all Crowley would do was watch.</p><p>He sat cross-legged, shoulders slouched, on a ridge just outside the city. His eyes fixed on the towering blaze eating away his prized creation. He\u2019d spent a lifetime tending to those plants. He\u2019d been fond of them. Never even shouted a cruel word or threatened a painful end. But his affection had been for nothing.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move as footsteps approached him, his gaze never leaving the red painted city of Babylon.</p><p>\u201cYou knew this would happen.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question, just a statement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Aziraphale hesitated. It was the only answer that Crowley needed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The Serpent nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear,\u201d the angel spoke again in earnest. \u201cI know how much you liked the hanging gardens.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause before Crowley responded. And when he did, it was soft and toneless. Maybe it was a defence mechanism. Or maybe he really couldn\u2019t feel anything. But it was possible that he was simply feeling too much. \u201cI was making a new Eden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>.\u201d The devastated sigh that came from the angel would\u2019ve broken Crowley\u2019s heart in two if it weren\u2019t already left shattered in the rubble of the gardens. Crowley had loved Eden\u30fcAziraphale knew that, he just didn\u2019t realise how much.</p><p>The Garden had been his paradise. Cast out of Heaven, and outcasted in Hell, it was his only true home. He cared for each plant with patience and words of encouragement. The greenery knew he loved them, and he\u2019d hoped they loved him in return. They might\u2019ve been the only things on the whole planet to do so. And then he\u2019d lost them, just as he\u2019d lost Divinity. Shoved out of the Garden alongside the humans he\u2019d tempted into sin, whose immortality had been stripped away by an angry Mother. He hadn\u2019t known the Almighty would react so badly as to throw away Her favourite children.</p><p>He\u2019d watched Eden disappear then, just as he watched Babylon now.</p><p>Aziraphale was sitting next to him now, a gentle hand placed on his shoulder. Yellow eyes turned amber in the light cast by the flames. The sun was setting and the air was getting cold.</p><p>The hanging gardens of Babylon had been Crowley\u2019s first, and last, attempt to recreate the Garden. Kindness in regards to life had gotten him nowhere. He\u2019d lost everything he\u2019d ever had mercy on.

Why risk taking on a demon that could sit in a path of holy water and showed no compunctions in destroying one of their own? It would be much safer to sit back, take advantage of Crowleys favorite vice, and torture him when he was at his most vulnerable. <br/><br/>Hm.

A purge of On High. The world was beginning to close, a layer being built, bit by bit, high above. This was Her newest creation. An eternal prison. Hell.</p><p>He heard him then. Crowley, gasping for air, shrieking as he struggled from the river of sulfur. His black wings soaked to the very core and useless for flight no matter how hard he flapped and jumped, attempting to get lift. He fell to his knees before rising again, stumbling and shambling, shouting all the way. \u201cWait! WAIT! Where are you going?! Don\u2019t leave me here!\u201d<br/><br/>The sky closed up, leaving only rock and heat. Aziraphael wanted to curl in on himself and cocoon in his wings. It was too horrible. Unavoidable, yes, but unavoidable things were often the worst of all.</p><p>Crowley screamed an cursed and, all at once, fell as if bound by rope, arms and legs tight together. He hit the hardwood like a stack of bricks, scattering books.</p><p>Wait. Books? Aziraphael tore his eyes from friends, taking stock of his surroundings once again. There had been a change. This was hell but not at the same time. The materials were all wrong.<br/><br/>Instead of smoldering feathers there were burning pages falling from on high. The sulfur and brimstone stench subsided only to be replaced by the scent of burning paper and molten leather. The sulfurous stalagmites had changed when he wasn\u2019t looking into teetering, smoldering stacks of nameless books. <br/><br/>Crowley was thrashing against his invisible bindings, wings tucked so close they were flush to him. The blackened feathers flattened, hardening into scales&hellip;then there were no legs but a tail-<br/><br/>\u201c<b>Aziraphael!</b>\u201d His own name being screamed so terribly sucked the breath from him. Crowley was screaming once again, his mouth all fangs and forked tongue. \u201cAssssziraphael I can\u2019t-&hellip;you\u2019re gone! I can\u2019t find you! You\u2019ve gone! h\u2019Assssssssszzzziraphael! H\u2019asssszira-!\u201d<br/><br/>All that was left was the snake, fangs bared to the dark ceiling above them, striking as if it might bring all of heaven down to its level.</p><p>As a principality Aziraphael had all manner of experience in the evils of man and how to inspire the strength to counter them. He considered himself quite good at it, if not lax at times, which is why he allowed himself to indulge. A delicious meal, a rare edition, sitting a bit too close at times to demonic company, taking orders as more of a suggestion, excetera, excetera. <br/><br/>Anger was a rarity, saved for only the most dire of situations. His patience and faith that all would be well if he did the right thing kept it bay. Blind rage was beyond him. Even in mortal men he found it hard to truly know what would restore them. <br/><br/>Crowley, however much he liked to deny it to the angel, was an optimist. There was always a temper brimming just beneath the surface, fueling his humor and more pragmatic view points, but his \u2018glass half full\u2019 way of approaching himself and the world around him seemed to keep him standing up right. <br/><br/>This was a wrath born from the lack of a silver lining. Black as the billowing smoke that was beginning to choke Aziraphael and overflowing with fear and heartbreak. It was primal and without rational thought, destructive to its very core and more volatile than nitroglycerine being transported by express freight. <br/><br/>It was terrifying.</p><p>Or, rather, he felt it should be. Instead he found himself bursting with compassion and sympathy. \u201cI lost my best friend.\u201d At the time with the end of the world looming and his lack of body he could only offer the briefest of apologies, of condolences, and they had never truly revisited that moment in the weeks that followed. The shop was fine, Aziraphael was corporeal, and upper management was giving them both a wide berth. <br/><br/>\u201cI lost my best friend.\u201d His voice had broken, unusually hoarse as if he had screamed himself raw and never bothered to fix the damage. Oh! He hadn\u2019t even looked like himself! Covered in soot and dried swat, clothing rumpled and filthy\u2026. \u00a0He had never seen Crolwy so disheveled, not in the six thousand years he had known him. <br/><br/>Oh Crowley! Oh dear, sweet Crowley!</p><p>He was in motion before he consciously made the decision to go to him. The great snake tossed and coiled, hissing and striking, blind, utterly reptilian rage reflected in familiar yellow eyes. \u00a0He threw himself on the serpent without further hesitation, wrestling with it. He yelped as a fang found purchase but kept on it, holding tighter, putting his wings into it. <br/><br/>\u201cI know, my dear, I know. It wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d He found himself saying through grunts and pants, saying whatever he thought might soothe the demon. After six thousand years of companionship surely he knew the right combination of words somewhere in his heart. \u00a0\u201cYou were never abandoned, though, not truly! You did not go gentle into that good night. You raged, raged against the dying light. I\u2019m right here. It\u2019s quite alright! I\u2019ll be here until you can see the dawn again.\u201d</p><p>He kept talking, eyes screwed shut as it was all becoming too much. Too much fire, too much smoke, too much fury. \u00a0Concentrate on scales, concentrate and pulling him closer, concentrate only Crowley.</p><p>He kept talking.</p><p>His hands ran over smooth, searing hot scales in gentling motions. He hushed and soothed.</p><p>Keep talking. Hold closer.</p><p>He was in the midst of some Whitman and breathless reassurances when he relized he stroking feathers. That all was still. The air was thick and hot but lacked the acrid smoke of moments ago. Cautiously he opened his eyes. <br/><br/>Staring up at him from his lap were bright yellow eyes, framed by an angular face. Clean and well groomed from his red hair down to the tips of snake skin shoes. Aziraphael could only stare back, suddenly mute after speaking at such great length. <br/><br/>Around them was Eden. Wait. No. The stone ceiling was made of glass, as were the walls. A green house awash with lush plants, fed on anger but provided for with care. He barely noticed. He couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from the demon looking up at him from his lap. <br/><br/>Slender hands reached upwards, framing his face tentatively. Relief exploded in his chest and, for the first time in his long life Aziraphael wanted to give in and allow himself to fall into those welcoming hands, turn his face until his lips meant the pulse in Crowley\u2019s wrist and-</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ssss all wrong, innit?\u201d Crowley spoke finally, a residual hiss worming its way into his words. \u201cSssomething wrong is being done. We weren\u2019t here a second ago. I wasss&hellip;elssssewhere.\u201d<br/><br/>Aziraphael seized on this moment of lucidity. \u201cYes! My dear, I\u2019m afraid you are under some sort of psychic attack! This all exists in the confines of your mind.\u201d<br/><br/>Gentle fingers ghosted along his jawline. \u201cAre you real, then?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDo I often make valiant appearances in your sleeping hours?\u201d The angel joked, shooting a grin his way. <br/><br/>Crowley never answered, fingers stopping their journey all at once. Aziraphael laughed uncertainly. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have any answers, do you?\u201d He pushed, trying to wave away his last question with a new one.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of demons that could do&hellip;thissss,\u201d Crowley hissed thoughtfully. \u201cHumans ssskilled in the occult assswell. And angelsss.\u201d<br/><br/>Aziraphael nodded along. He wasn\u2019t saying anything that he had not already considered himself but it was nice to get Crowley\u2019s opinion on matters. It helped him think. Between the two of them they could come to a solution. They were truly stronger together. <br/><br/>Crowley went rigid in his arms. \u201cAh, hell. Thisss doessssn\u2019t feel good.\u201d<br/><br/>Everything was breaking apart. The plants were wilting and fading to nothing, the floor itself collapsing in on itself. \u201cNot again!\u201d He groaned and held to Crowley tighter. \u201cYou can\u2019t go without me! I\u2019ll&hellip;I\u2019ll follow!\u201d<br/><br/>Crowley once again, infuriatingly, said nothing. Instead he continued to gaze at him with a peculiar expression.<br/><br/>Then he was pushing the angel away, falling back into the crumbling nothing.</p><p>This time when Aziraphael came to his senses he shouted out in frustration and very nearly pitched the clock radio on the nightstand across the room in a fit of rarely felt anger.</p>",

A purge of On High. The world was beginning to close, a layer being built, bit by bit, high above. This was Her newest creation. An eternal prison. Hell.</p><p>He heard him then. Crowley, gasping for air, shrieking as he struggled from the river of sulfur. His black wings soaked to the very core and useless for flight no matter how hard he flapped and jumped, attempting to get lift. He fell to his knees before rising again, stumbling and shambling, shouting all the way. \u201cWait! WAIT! Where are you going?! Don\u2019t leave me here!\u201d<br><br>The sky closed up, leaving only rock and heat. Aziraphael wanted to curl in on himself and cocoon in his wings. It was too horrible.

You\u2019ve gone! h\u2019Assssssssszzzziraphael! H\u2019asssszira-!\u201d<br><br>All that was left was the snake, fangs bared to the dark ceiling above them, striking as if it might bring all of heaven down to its level.</p><p>As a principality Aziraphael had all manner of experience in the evils of man and how to inspire the strength to counter them. He considered himself quite good at it, if not lax at times, which is why he allowed himself to indulge. A delicious meal, a rare edition, sitting a bit too close at times to demonic company, taking orders as more of a suggestion, excetera, excetera. <br><br>Anger was a rarity, saved for only the most dire of situations. His patience and faith that all would be well if he did the right thing kept it bay. Blind rage was beyond him. Even in mortal men he found it hard to truly know what would restore them. <br><br>Crowley, however much he liked to deny it to the angel, was an optimist. There was always a temper brimming just beneath the surface, fueling his humor and more pragmatic view points, but his \u2018glass half full\u2019 way of approaching himself and the world around him seemed to keep him standing up right. <br><br>This was a wrath born from the lack of a silver lining. Black as the billowing smoke that was beginning to choke Aziraphael and overflowing with fear and heartbreak. It was primal and without rational thought, destructive to its very core and more volatile than nitroglycerine being transported by express freight. <br><br>It was terrifying.</p><p>Or, rather, he felt it should be. Instead he found himself bursting with compassion and sympathy. \u201cI lost my best friend.\u201d At the time with the end of the world looming and his lack of body he could only offer the briefest of apologies, of condolences, and they had never truly revisited that moment in the weeks that followed. The shop was fine, Aziraphael was corporeal, and upper management was giving them both a wide berth. <br><br>\u201cI lost my best friend.\u201d His voice had broken, unusually hoarse as if he had screamed himself raw and never bothered to fix the damage. Oh! He hadn\u2019t even looked like himself! Covered in soot and dried swat, clothing rumpled and filthy\u2026. \u00a0He had never seen Crolwy so disheveled, not in the six thousand years he had known him. <br><br>Oh Crowley! Oh dear, sweet Crowley!</p><p>He was in motion before he consciously made the decision to go to him. The great snake tossed and coiled, hissing and striking, blind, utterly reptilian rage reflected in familiar yellow eyes. \u00a0He threw himself on the serpent without further hesitation, wrestling with it. He yelped as a fang found purchase but kept on it, holding tighter, putting his wings into it. <br><br>\u201cI know, my dear, I know. It wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d He found himself saying through grunts and pants, saying whatever he thought might soothe the demon. After six thousand years of companionship surely he knew the right combination of words somewhere in his heart. \u00a0\u201cYou were never abandoned, though, not truly! You did not go gentle into that good night. You raged, raged against the dying light. I\u2019m right here. It\u2019s quite alright! I\u2019ll be here until you can see the dawn again.\u201d</p><p>He kept talking, eyes screwed shut as it was all becoming too much. Too much fire, too much smoke, too much fury. \u00a0Concentrate on scales, concentrate and pulling him closer, concentrate only Crowley.</p><p>He kept talking.</p><p>His hands ran over smooth, searing hot scales in gentling motions. He hushed and soothed.</p><p>Keep talking. Hold closer.</p><p>He was in the midst of some Whitman and breathless reassurances when he relized he stroking feathers. That all was still. The air was thick and hot but lacked the acrid smoke of moments ago. Cautiously he opened his eyes. <br><br>Staring up at him from his lap were bright yellow eyes, framed by an angular face. Clean and well groomed from his red hair down to the tips of snake skin shoes. Aziraphael could only stare back, suddenly mute after speaking at such great length. <br><br>Around them was Eden. Wait. No. The stone ceiling was made of glass, as were the walls. A green house awash with lush plants, fed on anger but provided for with care. He barely noticed. He couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from the demon looking up at him from his lap. <br><br>Slender hands reached upwards, framing his face tentatively. Relief exploded in his chest and, for the first time in his long life Aziraphael wanted to give in and allow himself to fall into those welcoming hands, turn his face until his lips meant the pulse in Crowley\u2019s wrist and-</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ssss all wrong, innit?\u201d Crowley spoke finally, a residual hiss worming its way into his words. \u201cSssomething wrong is being done. We weren\u2019t here a second ago. I wasss\u2026elssssewhere.\u201d<br><br>Aziraphael seized on this moment of lucidity. \u201cYes! My dear, I\u2019m afraid you are under some sort of psychic attack! This all exists in the confines of your mind.\u201d<br><br>Gentle fingers ghosted along his jawline. \u201cAre you real, then?\u201d<br><br>\u201cDo I often make valiant appearances in your sleeping hours?\u201d The angel joked, shooting a grin his way. <br><br>Crowley never answered, fingers stopping their journey all at once. Aziraphael laughed uncertainly. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have any answers, do you?\u201d He pushed, trying to wave away his last question with a new one.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of demons that could do\u2026thissss,\u201d Crowley hissed thoughtfully. \u201cHumans ssskilled in the occult assswell. And angelsss.\u201d<br><br>Aziraphael nodded along. He wasn\u2019t saying anything that he had not already considered himself but it was nice to get Crowley\u2019s opinion on matters. It helped him think. Between the two of them they could come to a solution. They were truly stronger together. <br><br>Crowley went rigid in his arms. \u201cAh, hell. Thisss doessssn\u2019t feel good.\u201d<br><br>Everything was breaking apart. The plants were wilting and fading to nothing, the floor itself collapsing in on itself. \u201cNot again!\u201d He groaned and held to Crowley tighter. \u201cYou can\u2019t go without me! I\u2019ll\u2026I\u2019ll follow!\u201d<br><br>Crowley once again, infuriatingly, said nothing. Instead he continued to gaze at him with a peculiar expression.<br><br>Then he was pushing the angel away, falling back into the crumbling nothing.</p><p>This time when Aziraphael came to his senses he shouted out in frustration and very nearly pitched the clock radio on the nightstand across the room in a fit of rarely felt anger.</p>",
