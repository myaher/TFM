His tall stature, I could recognize almost anywhere. It seemed that ever since we had bid our wistful goodbyes and he had gone to fight in the Great War, he had not changed.&nbsp;</p><p>His features that I always described as chiseled as a perfectly carved Michelangelo statue that I couldn&rsquo;t await to touch. His soft, plump lips that I couldn&rsquo;t wait to kiss for hours if I could. His soft luscious hair that I wanted desperately to tangle my fingers in.&nbsp;</p><p>The bright rays of sun highlighted the adorable dimples in his cheeks as he smiled once he noticed me in the crowd. He waved at me and quickly made his way to where I stood. Instantly, as he did so, I feel tears trickle down my cheeks as I reach to wipe them away.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Bucky</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>I jump into his arms for a tight embrace whilst he wraps his strong arms around my waist and buries his face into my hair and spins us around as we laugh wholeheartedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, doll, I&rsquo;ve missed you so much!&rdquo; He exclaims, as he takes a minute to look at me. I place both my hands upon his cheeks and pull him into me for a passionate kiss.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t changed at all, angel.&rdquo; He says after we break the kiss.&nbsp;&ldquo;Still the most gorgeous dame I love more and more each day.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>I rest my head upon his chest and whisper, though I still knew he could hear me from all the shouts, laughter and chatters around us.&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a slight change while you&rsquo;ve been gone, love.&rdquo;</p><p>Gently, he raises my chin and his blue orbs melt into mine.&nbsp;&ldquo;What change, doll?&rdquo;</p><p>I peer up at him through my wet lashes, unaware that I had begun crying. I reach for his hand and place it on my belly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant, Bucky.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky seemed to stagger back a few steps while his mouth rested agape in astonishment. I noticed the corners of his eyes watering with tears as his fingertips rubbed my belly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m going to be a father?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, love. You&rsquo;re going to be a father.&rdquo;</p><p>After a few moments, that he had finally processed my words, surprisingly, he picks me up and spins me around as I hold onto his shoulders.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a father.&rdquo; He says, kissing me as I laugh at his excitement and joy.</p><p>Bucky looks around and throws a fist into the air.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a father!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The people around us applaud, cheer and whistle as I blush at the sudden attention.

        "body": "<p>Loki was different. Had always been different. He had never let his strangeness bother him, never let what Thor\u2019s friends said about him when they thought he wasn\u2019t listening get to him. It was no bother of his if he had friends or not. He had his mother and when Thor had the time, he had his brother as well. And if Thor didn\u2019t, well, he had magic. Which occasionally lead to mischief.<b><br/></b></p><p>So really, the situation that he was in right now was completely Thor\u2019s fault. If Thor had just listened to mother and come with him to get herbs from Healer Eir, then he would be completely fine and wouldn\u2019t currently be being chased by her apprentices. It wasn\u2019t his fault his magic acted up, he was still a novice. As father would never let him forget. He ducked around a corner and slid behind one of the many pillars that lined the hallways. Catching his breath, Loki couldn\u2019t help but reflect on how he had gotten into this situation. Thor&rsquo;s fault indeed.</p><p>___</p><p><i>His magic sparked in a serpent green burst of light as someone knocked gently on his chamber door, causing the levitating book to stop flipping its pages and fall violently out of the air. Loki, who had been laying on his belly, idly moving his hand through the air to flip the pages of the now crumpled book, glanced up at the door. </i></p><p><i>He sighed, a heavy sigh that no child should make, before calling out, \u201cyou may come in!\u201d There was no answer at first, causing Loki to sit up on his elbows like a raven about to take flight. Then the door finally opened to reveal who was on the other side. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMother,\u201d he breathed in relief, half fearing that it had been Odin or worse, Thor come to demand his attention. </i></p><p><i>She stood in the doorway, a proud figure with curling hair that was brighter than the rainbow bridge and far more golden than even Heimdall\u2019s armor. The All-mother carried the scent of parchment, ink, and the ever heavy presence of apples as she glided into the room.
