Tony doesn\u2019t cry then, at least not until he\u2019s in the backseat of his car, letting Happy drive him to the airport for once as tears stream down his face.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s happy though. Happy that his daughter is special in this tangible way, even though he\u2019s known she is all along. Happy that <i>she\u2019s </i>so happy to be going off to boarding school to learn how to be a wizard, or whatever the hell it is she\u2019ll be doing there.\u00a0</p><p>When he gets home, he throws himself into work in a way that he hasn\u2019t for years. He builds things that can destroy because it\u2019s the one thing he\u2019s good at. Other than being a father, of course. Which is something he would have never thought after being left as the sole caregiver of a little girl 11 years ago, but hey. He\u2019s actually managed just fine, thank you very much.\u00a0</p><p>The next time he sees, his daughter is 12 and carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders. The next time he sees her is the last, and it\u2019s not even a memory he will be able to hold onto in the years to come.\u00a0</p><p>This time, when she cries, it\u2019s an ugly sobbing sound that rips from her chest, not nervous laughter and fond goodbyes. It\u2019s final and fleeting, just as the flick of her wand and the whispered\u00a0\u201cobliviate\u201d that falls from her lips.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s a memory that would haunt Tony, if only it were one he could keep.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>It was a difficult task for a twelve year old to complete\u2013 erasing her existence entirely from the world. But it was necessary. There was evil waiting for people like her, and even at a young age she knew that she would have to take a stand. One that had incredible potential to put her family in danger. So she would do what she could to protect him and the world, to make her father proud even if he would never realize it.\u00a0</p><p>So she erased herself from the pictures, from the videos, from the little press coverage her father allowed her to be in, from the minds of family and strangers alike. And if anyone wondered for the briefest of seconds what happened to Tony Stark\u2019s daughter, they would find nothing but the strangest sense that they were <i>sure </i>there had been a Stark heir despite the clear evidence that no such girl had ever existed. But they would move on, and so did Tony.\u00a0</p><p>He worked and he drank and he slept around and he found himself staring at the pictures on his wall that seemed like they had held something more at some point.\u00a0</p><p>He saw a joy in the face that looked back at him from a gondola in Venice, a beach in Greece, an <i>amusement park </i>in California, of all things. A joy that was as foreign and strange to Tony as the inexplicable nostalgia that ached in his chest whenever he saw a father swing his daughter up on his shoulders or clutch her hand tightly when maneuvering the busy streets of New York.\u00a0</p><p>He saw a stranger that he couldn\u2019t remember being, and was faced with a resulting void that he tried to fill with as much movement as possible.\u00a0</p><p>He bounced from project to project, demonstration to demonstration, bar to bar, and woman to woman to fulfill the restlessness that pushed at him.

He builds things that can destroy because it&rsquo;s the one thing he&rsquo;s good at. Other than being a father, of course. Which is something he would have never thought after being left as the sole caregiver of a little girl 11 years ago, but hey. He&rsquo;s actually managed just fine, thank you very much.&nbsp;</p><p>The next time he sees, his daughter is 12 and carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders. The next time he sees her is the last, and it&rsquo;s not even a memory he will be able to hold onto in the years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>This time, when she cries, it&rsquo;s an ugly sobbing sound that rips from her chest, not nervous laughter and fond goodbyes. It&rsquo;s final and fleeting, just as the flick of her wand and the whispered&nbsp;&ldquo;obliviate&rdquo; that falls from her lips.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s a memory that would haunt Tony, if only it were one he could keep.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a difficult task for a twelve year old to complete&ndash; erasing her existence entirely from the world. But it was necessary. There was evil waiting for people like her, and even at a young age she knew that she would have to take a stand. One that had incredible potential to put her family in danger. So she would do what she could to protect him and the world, to make her father proud even if he would never realize it.&nbsp;</p><p>So she erased herself from the pictures, from the videos, from the little press coverage her father allowed her to be in, from the minds of family and strangers alike. And if anyone wondered for the briefest of seconds what happened to Tony Stark&rsquo;s daughter, they would find nothing but the strangest sense that they were <i>sure </i>there had been a Stark heir despite the clear evidence that no such girl had ever existed. But they would move on, and so did Tony.&nbsp;</p><p>He worked and he drank and he slept around and he found himself staring at the pictures on his wall that seemed like they had held something more at some point.&nbsp;</p><p>He saw a joy in the face that looked back at him from a gondola in Venice, a beach in Greece, an <i>amusement park </i>in California, of all things. A joy that was as foreign and strange to Tony as the inexplicable nostalgia that ached in his chest whenever he saw a father swing his daughter up on his shoulders or clutch her hand tightly when maneuvering the busy streets of New York.&nbsp;</p><p>He saw a stranger that he couldn&rsquo;t remember being, and was faced with a resulting void that he tried to fill with as much movement as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>He bounced from project to project, demonstration to demonstration, bar to bar, and woman to woman to fulfill the restlessness that pushed at him. Pushed him to move, to find, to <i>remember</i>. But no matter what he did, he <i>couldn&rsquo;t </i>so he just kept moving without any care as to where he went. As long as he wasn&rsquo;t standing still, wondering about who he was supposed to be and comparing it to who he was, he was fine. He could <i>survive</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>He had Pepper and Rhodey and Happy, of course, but they seemed just as confused as he was. They stood by him through all the destruction and disaster, and he never even <i>thanked </i>them for it, but he was glad all the same. They loved him, though he couldn&rsquo;t fathom why, and he tried to make it enough.</p><p>It never was.&nbsp;</p><p>But he pushed on anyway, and when Afghanistan happened and he was forced to reevaluate his entire life, he thought maybe he had found what he was looking for. A sense of purpose, a legacy of heroism, and (later, after the Battle of New York and the Avengers) a sort of family that could actually work.&nbsp;</p><p>It still never felt like it was <i>quite </i>enough.</p><p>His daughter, for her part, did her best to stay focused. She learned as much as she could, trained even when she didn&rsquo;t have the will to keep standing, and made herself known as some reliable, resilient, a force to be recounted with and counted upon to do what needed to be done.&nbsp;</p><p>But she was still a Stark and still a daughter, though it no longer felt like it.</p><p>She watched her father go missing and mourned him, attempted to search for him but was restricted by rules and teachers that were looking out for her best interests. She had never felt trapped before, but she certainly did then and was faced with the very real possibility that she had extracted herself from her father&rsquo;s life forever and no longer had a home to return to after she helped defeat Voldemort (because she would, obviously; she was a Stark after all).&nbsp;</p><p>For the first time, she thought that perhaps she had made a mistake in protecting her father from the truth, and had subsequently played a part in his death.&nbsp;</p><p>She grieved and she let her guilt consume her and she did nothing. And that is what she regrets most of all when she finally sees the newspapers with her father&rsquo;s gaunt, haunted eyes staring back at her.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, she does nothing but resolve to work harder. For her father and the rest of the world, even if they would never know it.</p><p>She tells herself that every time she receives news that her father has almost died (always long after she could have intervened, something she wonders at whenever Dumbledore brings her news of her hero father and his death-defying stunts). She tells herself she is proud to have a father so brave and heroic, even if he doesn&rsquo;t know he exists. She tells herself she is merely following in his footsteps as she resolves to keep her distance.&nbsp;</p><p>But mostly, she fears for him.Yet she has no time to really give that fear much thought when Dementors and the Ministry are invading her home and suddenly she&rsquo;s forced into the role she always knew she would take: a solider.&nbsp;</p><p>She stops hearing about her father entirely once Dumbledore is gone, and she finds that she doesn&rsquo;t have much time to worry about him anyway once the Deatheaters come.&nbsp;</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t until she is 18 and battle-worn that Tony Stark&rsquo;s daughter comes home, a little weary, a little afraid, but ready to take back her family now that she&rsquo;s done her part in saving them.&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing she sees when she pops into the kitchen is her father, half-smiling at something the blonde man with a hammer is saying, and she thinks that his smiles used to be more radiant. Heartfelt. But it&rsquo;s been along time, and she considers the possibility that she has remembered incorrectly. It&rsquo;s a thought that makes her unbearably sad, but it isn&rsquo;t one she can entertain for long because suddenly six superheroes are seconds away from attacking her.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s possible that breaking into the home base of the world&rsquo;s mightiest heroes may not have been the best plan, but she&rsquo;s a Stark, which is practically synonymous with&nbsp;&ldquo;impatient&rdquo; and this is her home. It&rsquo;s also something easy enough to rectify when you have magic.&nbsp;</p><p>So she whips out her wand, a sight apparently confusing enough to earn her a few seconds. Enough to say the word and change Tony&rsquo;s world for the third time in his life.&nbsp;</p><p>This time when they cry, it&rsquo;s together, wrapped up in an embrace so tight she thinks she may suffocate. But this is&nbsp;her father&nbsp;and he&nbsp;<i>remembers</i>, so it&rsquo;s a possibility she&rsquo;s willing to face, just so long as he never lets go of her again.&nbsp;</p>",
