If it was something he was scared about, it only meant 10x worse for you. So when he told you turn out the lights upon the arrival of some unknown vehicle, you felt your anxiety go through the roof.<br/></p><p> \u201cWho\u2019s..\u201d You questioned as you quickly tiptoed over and shut the light off as Jungkook shut the balcony door and slid the lock shut. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We need to hide. I\u2019ll kill the lights downstairs with the power box in the hall.\u201d Jungkook deadpanned as he quickly disappeared into the hallway, leaving you standing bewildered.\u00a0</p><p>You turned your head frantically trying to locate a spot to hide as you heard the door to the car slam shut outside. \u201cY/N come on!\u201d Jungkook whisper-yelled as he stuck his head in the doorway. You blinked a few times before wandering over towards him. </p><p>He quickly grabbed your wrist and pulled you down the hallway towards a storage closet when a black blur zoomed past the 2 of you down the stairs, causing you both to back into the walls on either side.\u00a0</p><p>Feeling as if all air had left your body at that moment, you carefully swung the closet door open and climbed inside, hiding behind a stack of blankets. Looking around, there was barely enough room for you, let alone Jungkook.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUhh.. Okay here I can move these over and sit in them so you can get in.\u201d You whispered as you reached for Jungkook\u2019s hand as he still glared down the staircase. </p><p>\u201cNo.. I\u2019ll hide somewhere else.\u201d He answered flatly. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we will both fit in there. I\u2019ll find somewhere to hide in these rooms.\u201d Jungkook quickly explained as he leaned down to cup your face in his hands. \u201cWhatever you do, do NOT move. I will come back and get you when it\u2019s safe.\u201d Jungkook pleaded.\u00a0</p><p>He knew you would argue and beg to go with him but he couldn\u2019t afford you getting caught for his sake. \u201cBut..\u201d \u201cNo Y/N. Please.. Just listen-\u201d Jungkook was cut off by the sound of glass shattering downstairs.\u00a0</p><p>Pressing a quick kiss to your temple, Jungkook pulled his gun from his waistband, closed the closet door behind him and headed for the stairs. All you could do was watch through the small slots in the door. </p><p>Waiting for what seemed like hours, there was still no sign of Jungkook. The house grew eery silent as you pulled your knees into your chest. The hallway was barely illuminated by the glow of the moon through a window, adding even more to the uneasy feeling.\u00a0</p><p>All you could see through the slots was the wall on the opposite side and about halfway down the stairs. Itching to figure out who it was and what was going on, you slowly inched towards the door and got ready to peer down the stairs when a flash of black shot past, causing you to gasp and fly back into the closet.\u00a0</p><p>Slapping your hand over your mouth at the sudden sound you made, you feared for your life when you saw the figure backup, stopping just in front of the door. </p><p>Your eyes grew wide as you could make out the silhouette of a gun in his hand as he seemingly just stood eyeing the closet as if he could see right through it. Your breathing grew heavy and you tried everything to slow it down, but once the door was ripped open, exposing you to the moonlight and figure, your adrenaline took over.\u00a0</p><p>Glaring up at the unknown man, you immediately flipped your body around and made a dash for the stairs when the man shot his foot out, tripping you. Taking a large tumble down the wooden set of stairs, you almost didn\u2019t care your head was bleeding and the fall had caused a large gash.\u00a0</p><p>Scrambling up from the floor, you ran over around the kitchen counter to grab a knife when he shot in your direction, causing a scream to erupt from your throat. Swinging your hands across the counter, you successfully grabbed a decent sized knife and hid on the other side of the kitchen island. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You don\u2019t wanna come out and play?\u201d He taunted you as you could hear the click of his boots approaching you. Gripping the knife so hard your knuckles became white, you held the weapon close to your body, ready to stab as he made it around the corner.\u00a0</p><p>However, he took you by surprise, pinning you to the floor instead, kicking the knife feet away. \u201cGet off!\u201d You yelled through your rigid breathing. Watching as he picked up his gun and aimed it at your abdomen, you used all your strength to push his hand up, and he fired at the ceiling light, causing millions of glass shards to come raining down on the both of you. </p><p>Buying yourself some time with the glass shards, you picked up a large chunk and stuck it directly into his thigh. Hearing his blood curdling screams as he immediately retreated, you turned on your stomach, crawling for the knife, cutting your arms in the process.\u00a0</p><p>Just as you felt the material of the handle of the knife touch your fingertips, you gripped it tightly in your hand, turning and landing a clean slash to the man\u2019s hand as he made an attempt to reach for you once more.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d He seethed as he reached for his gun once more, but you were quicker this time. Letting out screams of anger, you lost it completely. You charged directly for the man, landing several stabs and lacerations to his abdomen and chest.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cDON\u2019T EVER TOUCH ME AGAIN!\u201d</i> You screamed as you plunged the knife into his body several more times. </p><p>Blood pooled around you and him both, covering not only the floor, but your hands, face, everything. Your hair was even clumped at the ends from being drenched in blood. Sitting over his body, you let the knife drop to the floor, making a metal clank as it did.\u00a0</p><p>You were too infuriated to even notice you had been crying as well. Your entire body was shaking intensely. Turning your head to take in the mess you had caused, you noticed a figure in the corner of your eye. You slowly turned your head and noticed it was Jungkook. </p><p>He stood completely still. Baffled by the scene in front of him. You.. of all people.. Were capable of this? Your eyes traveled down to his hand to see him holding the same pistol from earlier. He had no words. And even if he did, he couldn\u2019t say them.\u00a0</p><p>So he simply slowly neared you, putting his gun back into his waistband. Your response was just to just stare back at the lifeless body beneath you. His eyes were still open, staring lifelessly at the ceiling.\u00a0</p><p>His clothes drenched in blood.. His hair stuck to his forehead. You began to feel sick.. Beginning to backpedal away from the body, Jungkook caught you in his arms and lifted you up. \u201cJungkook I\u2026\u201d You began as you wiped at your forehead. Looking down at your hands, you didn\u2019t even know if it was your blood or his now. And that scared you. </p><p>\u201cShh.. Baby it\u2019s okay..\u201d He comforted. You began to feel panic arise in your chest as the reality of the situation dawned on you. \u201cJungkook.. Jun- I- I killed.. I killed..\u201d You stuttered like a broken record.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.. Just breathe.. Look at me..\u201d Jungkook sat in front of you on the floor, holding your hands in his. Your frantic eyes searched for his, fearing he would never look at you the same.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.. Just keep your eyes on me baby..\u201d He breathed out as he rubbed his thumb over your bloodied face. \u00a0\u201cI h-had t-to.\u201d You hiccupped as you let your head fall. \u201cI know. I know.\u201d He consoled. He glanced around the room, before pulling his phone out of his back pocket knowing who he needed to call. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phncsq8Orb1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"/></figure><p>Watching as Namjoon and some of his men pulled up in the driveway, you could tell he was genuinely concerned at your state. You stood in front of Jungkook on the porch, not wanting to go back inside until they got rid of the body. You couldn\u2019t stomach what you did.. </p><p>Watching as Namjoon conversed with his men for a few moments before they charged in the house beneath you and Jungkook, he soon followed. \u201cYou say this was one of Yoongi\u2019s?\u201d Namjoon sighed as he stepped in front of Jungkook. He simply nodded, shifting his head to the car next to theirs.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLook inside the car. Looks like the guy had plans of returning after whatever he was gonna do here..\u201d Jungkook notified as he shuffled his feet. Namjoon just nodded before waving a guy over to the car.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N.. Look I know I\u2019m probably the last face you wanna see right now..\u201d Namjoon wavered, fearing that you\u2019d blow up on him. \u201cBut I just wanted to say I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay kid.\u201d He slowly inched towards you, resting his hand on your shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>He actually felt shitty that he had brought this upon you. You just nodded and let your head fall into Jungkook\u2019s chest.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phnctcKYl21tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"/></figure><p><i>\t\u201cAlright I\u2019ve just arrived boss.\u201d He spoke over the ear piece. He surveyed the building carefully, making mental note of every exit he could see. He noticed the lights shut off upstairs, meaning they were already aware of his presence.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cGood. Don\u2019t mess this up. Make it quick. In and out. She\u2019s all you\u2019re there for.\u201d He nodded mentally before stepping out the car onto the driveway with his gun already out. </i></p><p><i>\tSliding a window open, he quickly climbed inside, turning against it so he wouldn\u2019t leave his back vulnerable. He had landed in what seemed to be the living room.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Taking in note of his surroundings, he noticed the staircase leading to upstairs, figuring that\u2019s where you\u2019d be. \u201cAlright I\u2019m in. I\u2019m checking first level then moving up.\u201d He whispered over the ear piece.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Stalking around the kitchen, office, bathroom, and such downstairs, he found it empty. Was Jungkook not here? Because surely if he was, he would\u2019ve made himself present by now. Oh well, makes my job easier.. He chuckled to himself as he slowly stalked up the stairs. </i></p><p><i>\tLooking down the narrow hallway, there was only about 4 rooms you could hide in, and a closet that looked beyond small, so he headed for the rooms first.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>However, hearing a small gasp come from the narrow hideaway, he smirked. Stopping just inches away from the handle, he listened in closely before ripping the door open to reveal your fragile figure. </i></p><p><i>\tFollowing hot on your trail as you made a dash for the stairs, he was quick to shoot his foot out, hearing a loud thump follow as you fell down the steps.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Running down them after you, he quickly fired a shot into the wall, barely missing your head as you scrambled for that knife. Stupid bitch\u2026 He could only think to himself. </i></p><p><i>\tTurning the corner of the kitchen island, he quickly pounced on top of you, trailing the gun up your body trying to work you into submission when you suddenly got the upper hand, quite literally. He grunted as you forced his hand up, taking out one of the kitchen lights, bracing his face to avoid the falling glass shards.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Feeling as if his leg had been set on fire, he quickly applied pressure to the wound on his thigh, growing angrier and angrier by the minute as he also watched you reach for that stupid knife once more.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0Knowing if he couldn\u2019t work you into submission while you were conscious, he reached for his gun again and shot his hand out to grab you, landing a clean laceration to the palm of his hand. \u201cYou Bitch!\u201d He called out as he hissed in pain. </i></p><p><i>\tBut what happened next was something he never thought would be his fate. You had finally gathered enough courage to strike back, plunging the knife in and out of his body.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He felt his body growing weaker and weaker as each stab became more and more of a fight to keep alive. But on the last few stabs, his body had lost and he registered completely still.</i></p><p><i>\t\u201cDammit!\u201d Yoongi raged as he slammed his ear piece down on his desk, shattering it to pieces. He couldn\u2019t believe everything he had just heard. One of his men, dead, at the hands of you.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0It almost made Yoongi laugh in hysterics, but then again this only meant reconstruction for his plans. Calling in his other reinforcements, he lined up a proposal for each and every one of them.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Watching as they all filed into his office, Yoongi smirked knowing damn well this was only a minor set back. \u201cBack to the drawing board boys..\u201d He announced as they all seated..</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phncuzJQGz1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"/></figure><p>Sitting outside in pure silence for about 20 minutes was making you extremely anxious. You watched as Jungkook conversed with Namjoon as they stood outside that unfamiliar vehicle as his men searched it.\u00a0</p><p><i>What did he think of you..? Does he still love me..? How could anyone after this..</i> You let a million questions wander in your mind before one of Namjoon\u2019s men stepped outside alerting everyone. \u201cNamjoon it\u2019s done.\u201d He announced.\u00a0</p><p>Jungkook turned nodding to the man before turning and walking back to you. \u201cHey.. let\u2019s go back inside. I\u2019ll get you cleaned up.\u201d Jungkook softly spoke.

Let\u2019s get you cleaned up.\u201d Jungkook somewhat mumbled as he rid himself of his shirt. You still stood completely still as he stalked up to you.\u00a0</p><p>He let his hands linger around your waist, not wanting to lift your shirt just yet if you weren\u2019t comfortable. \u201cY/N please talk to me.\u201d Jungkook pleaded as he searched your face for any sort of emotion. You could see the hurt in his eyes, but you were still too scared.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust say something. Please. Anything.\u201d He let his arms fall to his side in defeat. Watching as you still stood vacant, he sighed and turned around to head for the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d You quickly chimed. Even if you didn\u2019t want to talk, you still needed him here with you. \u201cI\u2019ll talk.. I\u2019ll talk.. Just don\u2019t leave me please..\u201d You stuttered as your fidgeted with your shirt. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you&hellip;\u201d Jungkook responded quickly as he made he was back over towards you. You slowly began to peel your bloody shirt off, but struggled with the cuts on your arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHere..\u201d Jungkook whispered from behind you as he helped you lift it off with ease. The 2 of you just stood against each other for a moment before Jungkook spoke against your neck. \u201cI\u2019d never leave you.. And that\u2019s a promise.\u201d He spoke muffled into your skin as he left small butterfly kisses along the way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know.. I know you\u2019re scared right now. And you think you\u2019re some monster..\u201d You closed your eyes at his words. It sounded even worse coming from him than it did in your own head. </p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t. You did it to survive Y/N.\u201d He turned you around to face him. \u201cIt\u2019s like you told me.. Just because you were dealt some bad cards doesn\u2019t mean it defines you.\u201d He pulled you into his bare chest, letting his hand rest on the back of your head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about it..\u201d You broke down. \u201cHe was already dead and.. And I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I felt as if he would just come back and kill me and..\u201d Jungkook pulled your head back to face him and pressed a soft kiss to your lips.\u00a0</p><p>You froze at the sudden contact, but slowly eased into it before he pulled away. \u201cYou did what you had to do.. And I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t have been there sooner.. I went to check the perimeter outside but once I heard your screams..\u201d Jungkook closed his eyes as if the memory had pained him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI thought..\u201d He choked up on his own words and you could see tears welling in his eyes. \u201cI thought I lost you.. And it would\u2019ve been my fault for leaving you there..\u201d Jungkook murmured as he pulled you into him once more.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t lose me.. It\u2019s okay..\u201d You consoled as you rubbed your hands up and down his back. It\u2019s usually what you did to calm him down when you two cuddled.\u00a0</p><p>Slowly letting your arms fall as Jungkook pulled back to cup your face, you looked him in the eyes. \u201cYou know how much I love you right..?\u201d Jungkook sniffled as he softly rubbed his thumb against your cheek once more.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEven like this?\u201d You let a small smile break as he had seemingly forgotten about your appearance. <i>\u201cEven like this.\u201d</i> He leaned down, pressing a kiss to your lips once more. \u201cNow how about that shower?\u201d He smiled as he pressed one more short kiss to your lips.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phncxfffFu1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"/></figure><p>Laying back in bed now with a new change of clothes and being ridden of the blood that coated your body, you clung tightly to Jungkook. You rested your head on his chest as his arm snaked around your waist holding you in close.</p><p>\u00a0You both lied still against one another in the dark, listening in closely to the soft sound of each other\u2019s breathing. Listening as your head rose up and down in sync on his chest, you turned over slightly and pressed a small kiss to his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d You mumbled into the fabric of his shirt. \u201cSo much..\u201d You deeply inhaled the scent of him as you began to close your eyes. \u201cI love you more.\u201d Jungkook chimed back, as he ran his hands through your hair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be here and I\u2019ll always love you no matter what Y/N.\u201d He breathed out as exhaustion fully took over and he inevitably drifted to sleep with you alongside him, safe. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phncxv4afq1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"/></figure><p>Waking up and reading the clock, <i>2:45AM</i>, You figured you better get a move on now. Glancing up from your spot beneath him, you watched as Jungkook slept soundly.\u00a0</p><p>His lips slightly parted, his hair messy and covering his face, his chest rising and falling in sync. It pained you. It pained you to leave him. You didn\u2019t want to. You wanted to stay and be with him for the rest of your life, but you couldn\u2019t. </p><p>Slowly unhinging yourself from his arms, you let your feet fall against the carpeted floor and took a deep breath. Grabbing the small suitcase you found in that closet and shoved under the bed the night before, you slowly slid it out, and began to throw in whatever articles of clothing you could.\u00a0</p><p>Rummaging through the closet as quietly as you could, you came across one of Jungkook\u2019s jackets. Slowly pulling it off the hanger, you held it delicately in your hands and pressed it against your face taking in the smell of him.\u00a0Letting out a shaky breath as you did so.\u00a0</p><p>You decided you\u2019d take it with you. Slipping it on over your frame, you zipped it up to hold it as close to your frame as possible. Something to remind you why you were doing this and that you would come back.</p><p>Zipping up the suitcase and setting it in the hallway, you quietly made your way back into the room with a pad of paper and a pen. Sitting on the floor at the edge of the bed, you began to write.</p><p>Wiping the tears that had began to drip down your face, you carefully rose from the floor and set the pen and paper on the nightstand next to Jungkook\u2019s sleeping figure.\u00a0</p><p>Quickly wiping your tears, you neared the edge of the bed and pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead. <i>\u201cI love you so much.</i>\u201d You whispered before brushing some of the hair out of his face and backing away.</p><p>Not daring to turn around in fear of breaking down, you quietly and quickly exited the room, grabbing your suitcase and the spare keys to one of the cars in the garage. Making your way down the stairs, you let your eyes glance over at the spot where you had killed the man earlier, forcing yourself to face it to know why you were doing this.</p><p>Slamming the trunk shut as you loaded your suitcase, you walked around the car, climbing into the driver\u2019s seat.\u00a0</p><p>Taking in a deep breath as you started the car, you began to reverse out of the driveway, taking in the house one more time, letting your eyes stop on the bedroom window. You really hoped to come back to him. Just like how things were in the beginning.</p><p>Taking off down the road, the house just became a mere image in the rearview mirror. Recalling the note you wrote to Jungkook, you let the tears freely fall now, as you knew you couldn\u2019t come back to him this time.</p><p><i>Dear Jungkook,</i></p><p><i>When you read this you will know I\u2019m gone. And I\u2019m so deeply sorry. I really am. I wish I could be with you. I wish I could be in your arms once more.

You\u2019ve come to be the absolute love of my life despite the situation we were put into. You are the most strongest and beautiful person I know and I\u2019m gonna need you to stay that way, okay? So please don\u2019t worry about me.. Worry about making things right with Namjoon and Yoongi. Worry about making a future that\u2019s safe for you. I know you can do it. I need to take some time to myself and figure out some things. But, I hope that when I return you\u2019ll still be there for me with open arms. No matter how long it may take, or how many obstacles I may run into, I will come back to you. You did it for me, as I will for you. I love you so so so much Jeon Jungkook. Thank you for loving me.

If it was something he was scared about, it only meant 10x worse for you. So when he told you turn out the lights upon the arrival of some unknown vehicle, you felt your anxiety go through the roof.<br></p><p> \u201cWho\u2019s..\u201d You questioned as you quickly tiptoed over and shut the light off as Jungkook shut the balcony door and slid the lock shut. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We need to hide. I\u2019ll kill the lights downstairs with the power box in the hall.\u201d Jungkook deadpanned as he quickly disappeared into the hallway, leaving you standing bewildered.\u00a0</p><p>You turned your head frantically trying to locate a spot to hide as you heard the door to the car slam shut outside. \u201cY/N come on!\u201d Jungkook whisper-yelled as he stuck his head in the doorway. You blinked a few times before wandering over towards him. </p><p>He quickly grabbed your wrist and pulled you down the hallway towards a storage closet when a black blur zoomed past the 2 of you down the stairs, causing you both to back into the walls on either side.\u00a0</p><p>Feeling as if all air had left your body at that moment, you carefully swung the closet door open and climbed inside, hiding behind a stack of blankets. Looking around, there was barely enough room for you, let alone Jungkook.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUhh.. Okay here I can move these over and sit in them so you can get in.\u201d You whispered as you reached for Jungkook\u2019s hand as he still glared down the staircase. </p><p>\u201cNo.. I\u2019ll hide somewhere else.\u201d He answered flatly. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we will both fit in there. I\u2019ll find somewhere to hide in these rooms.\u201d Jungkook quickly explained as he leaned down to cup your face in his hands. \u201cWhatever you do, do NOT move. I will come back and get you when it\u2019s safe.\u201d Jungkook pleaded.\u00a0</p><p>He knew you would argue and beg to go with him but he couldn\u2019t afford you getting caught for his sake. \u201cBut..\u201d \u201cNo Y/N. Please.. Just listen-\u201d Jungkook was cut off by the sound of glass shattering downstairs.\u00a0</p><p>Pressing a quick kiss to your temple, Jungkook pulled his gun from his waistband, closed the closet door behind him and headed for the stairs. All you could do was watch through the small slots in the door. </p><p>Waiting for what seemed like hours, there was still no sign of Jungkook. The house grew eery silent as you pulled your knees into your chest. The hallway was barely illuminated by the glow of the moon through a window, adding even more to the uneasy feeling.\u00a0</p><p>All you could see through the slots was the wall on the opposite side and about halfway down the stairs. Itching to figure out who it was and what was going on, you slowly inched towards the door and got ready to peer down the stairs when a flash of black shot past, causing you to gasp and fly back into the closet.\u00a0</p><p>Slapping your hand over your mouth at the sudden sound you made, you feared for your life when you saw the figure backup, stopping just in front of the door. </p><p>Your eyes grew wide as you could make out the silhouette of a gun in his hand as he seemingly just stood eyeing the closet as if he could see right through it. Your breathing grew heavy and you tried everything to slow it down, but once the door was ripped open, exposing you to the moonlight and figure, your adrenaline took over.\u00a0</p><p>Glaring up at the unknown man, you immediately flipped your body around and made a dash for the stairs when the man shot his foot out, tripping you. Taking a large tumble down the wooden set of stairs, you almost didn\u2019t care your head was bleeding and the fall had caused a large gash.\u00a0</p><p>Scrambling up from the floor, you ran over around the kitchen counter to grab a knife when he shot in your direction, causing a scream to erupt from your throat. Swinging your hands across the counter, you successfully grabbed a decent sized knife and hid on the other side of the kitchen island. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You don\u2019t wanna come out and play?\u201d He taunted you as you could hear the click of his boots approaching you. Gripping the knife so hard your knuckles became white, you held the weapon close to your body, ready to stab as he made it around the corner.\u00a0</p><p>However, he took you by surprise, pinning you to the floor instead, kicking the knife feet away. \u201cGet off!\u201d You yelled through your rigid breathing. Watching as he picked up his gun and aimed it at your abdomen, you used all your strength to push his hand up, and he fired at the ceiling light, causing millions of glass shards to come raining down on the both of you. </p><p>Buying yourself some time with the glass shards, you picked up a large chunk and stuck it directly into his thigh. Hearing his blood curdling screams as he immediately retreated, you turned on your stomach, crawling for the knife, cutting your arms in the process.\u00a0</p><p>Just as you felt the material of the handle of the knife touch your fingertips, you gripped it tightly in your hand, turning and landing a clean slash to the man\u2019s hand as he made an attempt to reach for you once more.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d He seethed as he reached for his gun once more, but you were quicker this time. Letting out screams of anger, you lost it completely. You charged directly for the man, landing several stabs and lacerations to his abdomen and chest.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cDON\u2019T EVER TOUCH ME AGAIN!\u201d</i> You screamed as you plunged the knife into his body several more times. </p><p>Blood pooled around you and him both, covering not only the floor, but your hands, face, everything. Your hair was even clumped at the ends from being drenched in blood. Sitting over his body, you let the knife drop to the floor, making a metal clank as it did.\u00a0</p><p>You were too infuriated to even notice you had been crying as well. Your entire body was shaking intensely. Turning your head to take in the mess you had caused, you noticed a figure in the corner of your eye. You slowly turned your head and noticed it was Jungkook. </p><p>He stood completely still. Baffled by the scene in front of him. You.. of all people.. Were capable of this? Your eyes traveled down to his hand to see him holding the same pistol from earlier. He had no words. And even if he did, he couldn\u2019t say them.\u00a0</p><p>So he simply slowly neared you, putting his gun back into his waistband. Your response was just to just stare back at the lifeless body beneath you. His eyes were still open, staring lifelessly at the ceiling.\u00a0</p><p>His clothes drenched in blood.. His hair stuck to his forehead. You began to feel sick.. Beginning to backpedal away from the body, Jungkook caught you in his arms and lifted you up. \u201cJungkook I\u2026\u201d You began as you wiped at your forehead. Looking down at your hands, you didn\u2019t even know if it was your blood or his now. And that scared you. </p><p>\u201cShh.. Baby it\u2019s okay..\u201d He comforted. You began to feel panic arise in your chest as the reality of the situation dawned on you. \u201cJungkook.. Jun- I- I killed.. I killed..\u201d You stuttered like a broken record.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.. Just breathe.. Look at me..\u201d Jungkook sat in front of you on the floor, holding your hands in his. Your frantic eyes searched for his, fearing he would never look at you the same.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.. Just keep your eyes on me baby..\u201d He breathed out as he rubbed his thumb over your bloodied face. \u00a0\u201cI h-had t-to.\u201d You hiccupped as you let your head fall. \u201cI know. I know.\u201d He consoled. He glanced around the room, before pulling his phone out of his back pocket knowing who he needed to call. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phncsq8Orb1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"></figure><p>Watching as Namjoon and some of his men pulled up in the driveway, you could tell he was genuinely concerned at your state.

He simply nodded, shifting his head to the car next to theirs.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLook inside the car. Looks like the guy had plans of returning after whatever he was gonna do here..\u201d Jungkook notified as he shuffled his feet. Namjoon just nodded before waving a guy over to the car.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N.. Look I know I\u2019m probably the last face you wanna see right now..\u201d Namjoon wavered, fearing that you\u2019d blow up on him. \u201cBut I just wanted to say I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay kid.\u201d He slowly inched towards you, resting his hand on your shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>He actually felt shitty that he had brought this upon you. You just nodded and let your head fall into Jungkook\u2019s chest.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phnctcKYl21tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"></figure><p><i>\t\u201cAlright I\u2019ve just arrived boss.\u201d He spoke over the ear piece.

She\u2019s all you\u2019re there for.\u201d He nodded mentally before stepping out the car onto the driveway with his gun already out. </i></p><p><i>\tSliding a window open, he quickly climbed inside, turning against it so he wouldn\u2019t leave his back vulnerable. He had landed in what seemed to be the living room.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Taking in note of his surroundings, he noticed the staircase leading to upstairs, figuring that\u2019s where you\u2019d be. \u201cAlright I\u2019m in. I\u2019m checking first level then moving up.\u201d He whispered over the ear piece.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Stalking around the kitchen, office, bathroom, and such downstairs, he found it empty. Was Jungkook not here? Because surely if he was, he would\u2019ve made himself present by now. Oh well, makes my job easier.. He chuckled to himself as he slowly stalked up the stairs. </i></p><p><i>\tLooking down the narrow hallway, there was only about 4 rooms you could hide in, and a closet that looked beyond small, so he headed for the rooms first.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>However, hearing a small gasp come from the narrow hideaway, he smirked. Stopping just inches away from the handle, he listened in closely before ripping the door open to reveal your fragile figure. </i></p><p><i>\tFollowing hot on your trail as you made a dash for the stairs, he was quick to shoot his foot out, hearing a loud thump follow as you fell down the steps.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Running down them after you, he quickly fired a shot into the wall, barely missing your head as you scrambled for that knife. Stupid bitch\u2026 He could only think to himself. </i></p><p><i>\tTurning the corner of the kitchen island, he quickly pounced on top of you, trailing the gun up your body trying to work you into submission when you suddenly got the upper hand, quite literally. He grunted as you forced his hand up, taking out one of the kitchen lights, bracing his face to avoid the falling glass shards.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Feeling as if his leg had been set on fire, he quickly applied pressure to the wound on his thigh, growing angrier and angrier by the minute as he also watched you reach for that stupid knife once more.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0Knowing if he couldn\u2019t work you into submission while you were conscious, he reached for his gun again and shot his hand out to grab you, landing a clean laceration to the palm of his hand. \u201cYou Bitch!\u201d He called out as he hissed in pain. </i></p><p><i>\tBut what happened next was something he never thought would be his fate. You had finally gathered enough courage to strike back, plunging the knife in and out of his body.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He felt his body growing weaker and weaker as each stab became more and more of a fight to keep alive. But on the last few stabs, his body had lost and he registered completely still.</i></p><p><i>\t\u201cDammit!\u201d Yoongi raged as he slammed his ear piece down on his desk, shattering it to pieces. He couldn\u2019t believe everything he had just heard. One of his men, dead, at the hands of you.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0It almost made Yoongi laugh in hysterics, but then again this only meant reconstruction for his plans. Calling in his other reinforcements, he lined up a proposal for each and every one of them.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Watching as they all filed into his office, Yoongi smirked knowing damn well this was only a minor set back. \u201cBack to the drawing board boys..\u201d He announced as they all seated..</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phncuzJQGz1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"></figure><p>Sitting outside in pure silence for about 20 minutes was making you extremely anxious.

How could anyone after this..</i> You let a million questions wander in your mind before one of Namjoon\u2019s men stepped outside alerting everyone. \u201cNamjoon it\u2019s done.\u201d He announced.\u00a0</p><p>Jungkook turned nodding to the man before turning and walking back to you. \u201cHey.. let\u2019s go back inside.

Let\u2019s get you cleaned up.\u201d Jungkook somewhat mumbled as he rid himself of his shirt. You still stood completely still as he stalked up to you.\u00a0</p><p>He let his hands linger around your waist, not wanting to lift your shirt just yet if you weren\u2019t comfortable. \u201cY/N please talk to me.\u201d Jungkook pleaded as he searched your face for any sort of emotion. You could see the hurt in his eyes, but you were still too scared.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust say something. Please. Anything.\u201d He let his arms fall to his side in defeat. Watching as you still stood vacant, he sighed and turned around to head for the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d You quickly chimed. Even if you didn\u2019t want to talk, you still needed him here with you. \u201cI\u2019ll talk.. I\u2019ll talk.. Just don\u2019t leave me please..\u201d You stuttered as your fidgeted with your shirt. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you\u2026\u201d Jungkook responded quickly as he made he was back over towards you. You slowly began to peel your bloody shirt off, but struggled with the cuts on your arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHere..\u201d Jungkook whispered from behind you as he helped you lift it off with ease. The 2 of you just stood against each other for a moment before Jungkook spoke against your neck. \u201cI\u2019d never leave you.. And that\u2019s a promise.\u201d He spoke muffled into your skin as he left small butterfly kisses along the way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know.. I know you\u2019re scared right now. And you think you\u2019re some monster..\u201d You closed your eyes at his words. It sounded even worse coming from him than it did in your own head. </p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t. You did it to survive Y/N.\u201d He turned you around to face him. \u201cIt\u2019s like you told me.. Just because you were dealt some bad cards doesn\u2019t mean it defines you.\u201d He pulled you into his bare chest, letting his hand rest on the back of your head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about it..\u201d You broke down. \u201cHe was already dead and.. And I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I felt as if he would just come back and kill me and..\u201d Jungkook pulled your head back to face him and pressed a soft kiss to your lips.\u00a0</p><p>You froze at the sudden contact, but slowly eased into it before he pulled away. \u201cYou did what you had to do.. And I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t have been there sooner.. I went to check the perimeter outside but once I heard your screams..\u201d Jungkook closed his eyes as if the memory had pained him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI thought..\u201d He choked up on his own words and you could see tears welling in his eyes. \u201cI thought I lost you.. And it would\u2019ve been my fault for leaving you there..\u201d Jungkook murmured as he pulled you into him once more.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t lose me.. It\u2019s okay..\u201d You consoled as you rubbed your hands up and down his back. It\u2019s usually what you did to calm him down when you two cuddled.\u00a0</p><p>Slowly letting your arms fall as Jungkook pulled back to cup your face, you looked him in the eyes. \u201cYou know how much I love you right..?\u201d Jungkook sniffled as he softly rubbed his thumb against your cheek once more.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEven like this?\u201d You let a small smile break as he had seemingly forgotten about your appearance. <i>\u201cEven like this.\u201d</i> He leaned down, pressing a kiss to your lips once more. \u201cNow how about that shower?\u201d He smiled as he pressed one more short kiss to your lips.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phncxfffFu1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"></figure><p>Laying back in bed now with a new change of clothes and being ridden of the blood that coated your body, you clung tightly to Jungkook. You rested your head on his chest as his arm snaked around your waist holding you in close.</p><p>\u00a0You both lied still against one another in the dark, listening in closely to the soft sound of each other\u2019s breathing. Listening as your head rose up and down in sync on his chest, you turned over slightly and pressed a small kiss to his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d You mumbled into the fabric of his shirt. \u201cSo much..\u201d You deeply inhaled the scent of him as you began to close your eyes. \u201cI love you more.\u201d Jungkook chimed back, as he ran his hands through your hair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be here and I\u2019ll always love you no matter what Y/N.\u201d He breathed out as exhaustion fully took over and he inevitably drifted to sleep with you alongside him, safe. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phncxv4afq1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"></figure><p>Waking up and reading the clock, <i>2:45AM</i>, You figured you better get a move on now. Glancing up from your spot beneath him, you watched as Jungkook slept soundly.\u00a0</p><p>His lips slightly parted, his hair messy and covering his face, his chest rising and falling in sync. It pained you. It pained you to leave him. You didn\u2019t want to. You wanted to stay and be with him for the rest of your life, but you couldn\u2019t. </p><p>Slowly unhinging yourself from his arms, you let your feet fall against the carpeted floor and took a deep breath. Grabbing the small suitcase you found in that closet and shoved under the bed the night before, you slowly slid it out, and began to throw in whatever articles of clothing you could.\u00a0</p><p>Rummaging through the closet as quietly as you could, you came across one of Jungkook\u2019s jackets. Slowly pulling it off the hanger, you held it delicately in your hands and pressed it against your face taking in the smell of him.\u00a0Letting out a shaky breath as you did so.\u00a0</p><p>You decided you\u2019d take it with you. Slipping it on over your frame, you zipped it up to hold it as close to your frame as possible. Something to remind you why you were doing this and that you would come back.</p><p>Zipping up the suitcase and setting it in the hallway, you quietly made your way back into the room with a pad of paper and a pen. Sitting on the floor at the edge of the bed, you began to write.</p><p>Wiping the tears that had began to drip down your face, you carefully rose from the floor and set the pen and paper on the nightstand next to Jungkook\u2019s sleeping figure.\u00a0</p><p>Quickly wiping your tears, you neared the edge of the bed and pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead. <i>\u201cI love you so much.</i>\u201d You whispered before brushing some of the hair out of his face and backing away.</p><p>Not daring to turn around in fear of breaking down, you quietly and quickly exited the room, grabbing your suitcase and the spare keys to one of the cars in the garage. Making your way down the stairs, you let your eyes glance over at the spot where you had killed the man earlier, forcing yourself to face it to know why you were doing this.</p><p>Slamming the trunk shut as you loaded your suitcase, you walked around the car, climbing into the driver\u2019s seat.\u00a0</p><p>Taking in a deep breath as you started the car, you began to reverse out of the driveway, taking in the house one more time, letting your eyes stop on the bedroom window. You really hoped to come back to him. Just like how things were in the beginning.</p><p>Taking off down the road, the house just became a mere image in the rearview mirror. Recalling the note you wrote to Jungkook, you let the tears freely fall now, as you knew you couldn\u2019t come back to him this time.</p><p><i>Dear Jungkook,</i></p><p><i>When you read this you will know I\u2019m gone. And I\u2019m so deeply sorry. I really am. I wish I could be with you. I wish I could be in your arms once more. I wish there could still be an us. </i></p><p><i>I am writing this to let you know I have left. And I\u2019m not quite sure where to, but I know I\u2019ll be okay. I am so grateful for everything you\u2019ve taught me and the unconditional love you\u2019ve shown me. I won\u2019t forget it or you. You\u2019ve come to be the absolute love of my life despite the situation we were put into. You are the most strongest and beautiful person I know and I\u2019m gonna need you to stay that way, okay? So please don\u2019t worry about me.. Worry about making things right with Namjoon and Yoongi. Worry about making a future that\u2019s safe for you. I know you can do it. I need to take some time to myself and figure out some things. But, I hope that when I return you\u2019ll still be there for me with open arms. No matter how long it may take, or how many obstacles I may run into, I will come back to you. You did it for me, as I will for you. I love you so so so much Jeon Jungkook. Thank you for loving me. I hope to see you soon.\u201d</i></p><p><i>- Love, Y/N</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phnd015A8L1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"></figure><p><i>(A/N: woo! it\u2019s finally finished! i\u2019m def a lot happier about how my writing is coming out since i\u2019m spending much more time on it now. also ngl i def cried while writing this lmaooo but i hope you guys like it! let me know if you do pls! i hope u have a great day/night! thanks!)</i></p>",

If it was something he was scared about, it only meant 10x worse for you. So when he told you turn out the lights upon the arrival of some unknown vehicle, you felt your anxiety go through the roof.<br></p><p> \u201cWho\u2019s..\u201d You questioned as you quickly tiptoed over and shut the light off as Jungkook shut the balcony door and slid the lock shut. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We need to hide. I\u2019ll kill the lights downstairs with the power box in the hall.\u201d Jungkook deadpanned as he quickly disappeared into the hallway, leaving you standing bewildered.\u00a0</p><p>You turned your head frantically trying to locate a spot to hide as you heard the door to the car slam shut outside. \u201cY/N come on!\u201d Jungkook whisper-yelled as he stuck his head in the doorway. You blinked a few times before wandering over towards him. </p><p>He quickly grabbed your wrist and pulled you down the hallway towards a storage closet when a black blur zoomed past the 2 of you down the stairs, causing you both to back into the walls on either side.\u00a0</p><p>Feeling as if all air had left your body at that moment, you carefully swung the closet door open and climbed inside, hiding behind a stack of blankets. Looking around, there was barely enough room for you, let alone Jungkook.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUhh.. Okay here I can move these over and sit in them so you can get in.\u201d You whispered as you reached for Jungkook\u2019s hand as he still glared down the staircase. </p><p>\u201cNo.. I\u2019ll hide somewhere else.\u201d He answered flatly. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we will both fit in there. I\u2019ll find somewhere to hide in these rooms.\u201d Jungkook quickly explained as he leaned down to cup your face in his hands. \u201cWhatever you do, do NOT move. I will come back and get you when it\u2019s safe.\u201d Jungkook pleaded.\u00a0</p><p>He knew you would argue and beg to go with him but he couldn\u2019t afford you getting caught for his sake. \u201cBut..\u201d \u201cNo Y/N. Please.. Just listen-\u201d Jungkook was cut off by the sound of glass shattering downstairs.\u00a0</p><p>Pressing a quick kiss to your temple, Jungkook pulled his gun from his waistband, closed the closet door behind him and headed for the stairs. All you could do was watch through the small slots in the door. </p><p>Waiting for what seemed like hours, there was still no sign of Jungkook. The house grew eery silent as you pulled your knees into your chest. The hallway was barely illuminated by the glow of the moon through a window, adding even more to the uneasy feeling.\u00a0</p><p>All you could see through the slots was the wall on the opposite side and about halfway down the stairs. Itching to figure out who it was and what was going on, you slowly inched towards the door and got ready to peer down the stairs when a flash of black shot past, causing you to gasp and fly back into the closet.\u00a0</p><p>Slapping your hand over your mouth at the sudden sound you made, you feared for your life when you saw the figure backup, stopping just in front of the door. </p><p>Your eyes grew wide as you could make out the silhouette of a gun in his hand as he seemingly just stood eyeing the closet as if he could see right through it. Your breathing grew heavy and you tried everything to slow it down, but once the door was ripped open, exposing you to the moonlight and figure, your adrenaline took over.\u00a0</p><p>Glaring up at the unknown man, you immediately flipped your body around and made a dash for the stairs when the man shot his foot out, tripping you. Taking a large tumble down the wooden set of stairs, you almost didn\u2019t care your head was bleeding and the fall had caused a large gash.\u00a0</p><p>Scrambling up from the floor, you ran over around the kitchen counter to grab a knife when he shot in your direction, causing a scream to erupt from your throat. Swinging your hands across the counter, you successfully grabbed a decent sized knife and hid on the other side of the kitchen island. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You don\u2019t wanna come out and play?\u201d He taunted you as you could hear the click of his boots approaching you. Gripping the knife so hard your knuckles became white, you held the weapon close to your body, ready to stab as he made it around the corner.\u00a0</p><p>However, he took you by surprise, pinning you to the floor instead, kicking the knife feet away. \u201cGet off!\u201d You yelled through your rigid breathing. Watching as he picked up his gun and aimed it at your abdomen, you used all your strength to push his hand up, and he fired at the ceiling light, causing millions of glass shards to come raining down on the both of you. </p><p>Buying yourself some time with the glass shards, you picked up a large chunk and stuck it directly into his thigh. Hearing his blood curdling screams as he immediately retreated, you turned on your stomach, crawling for the knife, cutting your arms in the process.\u00a0</p><p>Just as you felt the material of the handle of the knife touch your fingertips, you gripped it tightly in your hand, turning and landing a clean slash to the man\u2019s hand as he made an attempt to reach for you once more.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d He seethed as he reached for his gun once more, but you were quicker this time. Letting out screams of anger, you lost it completely. You charged directly for the man, landing several stabs and lacerations to his abdomen and chest.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cDON\u2019T EVER TOUCH ME AGAIN!\u201d</i> You screamed as you plunged the knife into his body several more times. </p><p>Blood pooled around you and him both, covering not only the floor, but your hands, face, everything. Your hair was even clumped at the ends from being drenched in blood. Sitting over his body, you let the knife drop to the floor, making a metal clank as it did.\u00a0</p><p>You were too infuriated to even notice you had been crying as well. Your entire body was shaking intensely. Turning your head to take in the mess you had caused, you noticed a figure in the corner of your eye. You slowly turned your head and noticed it was Jungkook. </p><p>He stood completely still. Baffled by the scene in front of him. You.. of all people.. Were capable of this? Your eyes traveled down to his hand to see him holding the same pistol from earlier. He had no words. And even if he did, he couldn\u2019t say them.\u00a0</p><p>So he simply slowly neared you, putting his gun back into his waistband. Your response was just to just stare back at the lifeless body beneath you. His eyes were still open, staring lifelessly at the ceiling.\u00a0</p><p>His clothes drenched in blood.. His hair stuck to his forehead. You began to feel sick.. Beginning to backpedal away from the body, Jungkook caught you in his arms and lifted you up. \u201cJungkook I\u2026\u201d You began as you wiped at your forehead. Looking down at your hands, you didn\u2019t even know if it was your blood or his now. And that scared you. </p><p>\u201cShh.. Baby it\u2019s okay..\u201d He comforted. You began to feel panic arise in your chest as the reality of the situation dawned on you. \u201cJungkook.. Jun- I- I killed.. I killed..\u201d You stuttered like a broken record.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.. Just breathe.. Look at me..\u201d Jungkook sat in front of you on the floor, holding your hands in his. Your frantic eyes searched for his, fearing he would never look at you the same.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.. Just keep your eyes on me baby..\u201d He breathed out as he rubbed his thumb over your bloodied face. \u00a0\u201cI h-had t-to.\u201d You hiccupped as you let your head fall. \u201cI know. I know.\u201d He consoled. He glanced around the room, before pulling his phone out of his back pocket knowing who he needed to call. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phncsq8Orb1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"></figure><p>Watching as Namjoon and some of his men pulled up in the driveway, you could tell he was genuinely concerned at your state.

He simply nodded, shifting his head to the car next to theirs.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLook inside the car. Looks like the guy had plans of returning after whatever he was gonna do here..\u201d Jungkook notified as he shuffled his feet. Namjoon just nodded before waving a guy over to the car.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N.. Look I know I\u2019m probably the last face you wanna see right now..\u201d Namjoon wavered, fearing that you\u2019d blow up on him. \u201cBut I just wanted to say I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay kid.\u201d He slowly inched towards you, resting his hand on your shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>He actually felt shitty that he had brought this upon you. You just nodded and let your head fall into Jungkook\u2019s chest.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phnctcKYl21tqh8f1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6\" data-orig-width=\"800\"></figure><p><i>\t\u201cAlright I\u2019ve just arrived boss.\u201d He spoke over the ear piece.

He had landed in what seemed to be the living room.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Taking in note of his surroundings, he noticed the staircase leading to upstairs, figuring that\u2019s where you\u2019d be. \u201cAlright I\u2019m in. I\u2019m checking first level then moving up.\u201d He whispered over the ear piece.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Stalking around the kitchen, office, bathroom, and such downstairs, he found it empty. Was Jungkook not here? Because surely if he was, he would\u2019ve made himself present by now. Oh well, makes my job easier.. He chuckled to himself as he slowly stalked up the stairs. </i></p><p><i>\tLooking down the narrow hallway, there was only about 4 rooms you could hide in, and a closet that looked beyond small, so he headed for the rooms first.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>However, hearing a small gasp come from the narrow hideaway, he smirked. Stopping just inches away from the handle, he listened in closely before ripping the door open to reveal your fragile figure. </i></p><p><i>\tFollowing hot on your trail as you made a dash for the stairs, he was quick to shoot his foot out, hearing a loud thump follow as you fell down the steps.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Running down them after you, he quickly fired a shot into the wall, barely missing your head as you scrambled for that knife. Stupid bitch\u2026 He could only think to himself. </i></p><p><i>\tTurning the corner of the kitchen island, he quickly pounced on top of you, trailing the gun up your body trying to work you into submission when you suddenly got the upper hand, quite literally. He grunted as you forced his hand up, taking out one of the kitchen lights, bracing his face to avoid the falling glass shards.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Feeling as if his leg had been set on fire, he quickly applied pressure to the wound on his thigh, growing angrier and angrier by the minute as he also watched you reach for that stupid knife once more.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0Knowing if he couldn\u2019t work you into submission while you were conscious, he reached for his gun again and shot his hand out to grab you, landing a clean laceration to the palm of his hand. \u201cYou Bitch!\u201d He called out as he hissed in pain. </i></p><p><i>\tBut what happened next was something he never thought would be his fate. You had finally gathered enough courage to strike back, plunging the knife in and out of his body.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He felt his body growing weaker and weaker as each stab became more and more of a fight to keep alive. But on the last few stabs, his body had lost and he registered completely still.</i></p><p><i>\t\u201cDammit!\u201d Yoongi raged as he slammed his ear piece down on his desk, shattering it to pieces.

You still stood completely still as he stalked up to you.\u00a0</p><p>He let his hands linger around your waist, not wanting to lift your shirt just yet if you weren\u2019t comfortable. \u201cY/N please talk to me.\u201d Jungkook pleaded as he searched your face for any sort of emotion. You could see the hurt in his eyes, but you were still too scared.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust say something. Please. Anything.\u201d He let his arms fall to his side in defeat.

Glancing up from your spot beneath him, you watched as Jungkook slept soundly.\u00a0</p><p>His lips slightly parted, his hair messy and covering his face, his chest rising and falling in sync. It pained you. It pained you to leave him. You didn\u2019t want to. You wanted to stay and be with him for the rest of your life, but you couldn\u2019t. </p><p>Slowly unhinging yourself from his arms, you let your feet fall against the carpeted floor and took a deep breath. Grabbing the small suitcase you found in that closet and shoved under the bed the night before, you slowly slid it out, and began to throw in whatever articles of clothing you could.\u00a0</p><p>Rummaging through the closet as quietly as you could, you came across one of Jungkook\u2019s jackets. Slowly pulling it off the hanger, you held it delicately in your hands and pressed it against your face taking in the smell of him.\u00a0Letting out a shaky breath as you did so.\u00a0</p><p>You decided you\u2019d take it with you. Slipping it on over your frame, you zipped it up to hold it as close to your frame as possible. Something to remind you why you were doing this and that you would come back.</p><p>Zipping up the suitcase and setting it in the hallway, you quietly made your way back into the room with a pad of paper and a pen. Sitting on the floor at the edge of the bed, you began to write.</p><p>Wiping the tears that had began to drip down your face, you carefully rose from the floor and set the pen and paper on the nightstand next to Jungkook\u2019s sleeping figure.\u00a0</p><p>Quickly wiping your tears, you neared the edge of the bed and pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead. <i>\u201cI love you so much.</i>\u201d You whispered before brushing some of the hair out of his face and backing away.</p><p>Not daring to turn around in fear of breaking down, you quietly and quickly exited the room, grabbing your suitcase and the spare keys to one of the cars in the garage. Making your way down the stairs, you let your eyes glance over at the spot where you had killed the man earlier, forcing yourself to face it to know why you were doing this.</p><p>Slamming the trunk shut as you loaded your suitcase, you walked around the car, climbing into the driver\u2019s seat.\u00a0</p><p>Taking in a deep breath as you started the car, you began to reverse out of the driveway, taking in the house one more time, letting your eyes stop on the bedroom window. You really hoped to come back to him. Just like how things were in the beginning.</p><p>Taking off down the road, the house just became a mere image in the rearview mirror. Recalling the note you wrote to Jungkook, you let the tears freely fall now, as you knew you couldn\u2019t come back to him this time.</p><p><i>Dear Jungkook,</i></p><p><i>When you read this you will know I\u2019m gone. And I\u2019m so deeply sorry. I really am. I wish I could be with you. I wish I could be in your arms once more. I wish there could still be an us. </i></p><p><i>I am writing this to let you know I have left. And I\u2019m not quite sure where to, but I know I\u2019ll be okay.

You\u2019ve come to be the absolute love of my life despite the situation we were put into. You are the most strongest and beautiful person I know and I\u2019m gonna need you to stay that way, okay? So please don\u2019t worry about me.. Worry about making things right with Namjoon and Yoongi. Worry about making a future that\u2019s safe for you. I know you can do it. I need to take some time to myself and figure out some things. But, I hope that when I return you\u2019ll still be there for me with open arms. No matter how long it may take, or how many obstacles I may run into, I will come back to you. You did it for me, as I will for you. I love you so so so much Jeon Jungkook. Thank you for loving me.

If it was something he was scared about, it only meant 10x worse for you. So when he told you turn out the lights upon the arrival of some unknown vehicle, you felt your anxiety go through the roof.<br /></p><p> &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s..&rdquo; You questioned as you quickly tiptoed over and shut the light off as Jungkook shut the balcony door and slid the lock shut. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. We need to hide. I&rsquo;ll kill the lights downstairs with the power box in the hall.&rdquo; Jungkook deadpanned as he quickly disappeared into the hallway, leaving you standing bewildered.&nbsp;</p><p>You turned your head frantically trying to locate a spot to hide as you heard the door to the car slam shut outside. &ldquo;Y/N come on!&rdquo; Jungkook whisper-yelled as he stuck his head in the doorway. You blinked a few times before wandering over towards him. </p><p>He quickly grabbed your wrist and pulled you down the hallway towards a storage closet when a black blur zoomed past the 2 of you down the stairs, causing you both to back into the walls on either side.&nbsp;</p><p>Feeling as if all air had left your body at that moment, you carefully swung the closet door open and climbed inside, hiding behind a stack of blankets. Looking around, there was barely enough room for you, let alone Jungkook.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhh.. Okay here I can move these over and sit in them so you can get in.&rdquo; You whispered as you reached for Jungkook&rsquo;s hand as he still glared down the staircase. </p><p>&ldquo;No.. I&rsquo;ll hide somewhere else.&rdquo; He answered flatly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way we will both fit in there. I&rsquo;ll find somewhere to hide in these rooms.&rdquo; Jungkook quickly explained as he leaned down to cup your face in his hands. &ldquo;Whatever you do, do NOT move. I will come back and get you when it&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo; Jungkook pleaded.&nbsp;</p><p>He knew you would argue and beg to go with him but he couldn&rsquo;t afford you getting caught for his sake. &ldquo;But..&rdquo; &ldquo;No Y/N. Please.. Just listen-&rdquo; Jungkook was cut off by the sound of glass shattering downstairs.&nbsp;</p><p>Pressing a quick kiss to your temple, Jungkook pulled his gun from his waistband, closed the closet door behind him and headed for the stairs. All you could do was watch through the small slots in the door. </p><p>Waiting for what seemed like hours, there was still no sign of Jungkook. The house grew eery silent as you pulled your knees into your chest. The hallway was barely illuminated by the glow of the moon through a window, adding even more to the uneasy feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>All you could see through the slots was the wall on the opposite side and about halfway down the stairs. Itching to figure out who it was and what was going on, you slowly inched towards the door and got ready to peer down the stairs when a flash of black shot past, causing you to gasp and fly back into the closet.&nbsp;</p><p>Slapping your hand over your mouth at the sudden sound you made, you feared for your life when you saw the figure backup, stopping just in front of the door. </p><p>Your eyes grew wide as you could make out the silhouette of a gun in his hand as he seemingly just stood eyeing the closet as if he could see right through it. Your breathing grew heavy and you tried everything to slow it down, but once the door was ripped open, exposing you to the moonlight and figure, your adrenaline took over.&nbsp;</p><p>Glaring up at the unknown man, you immediately flipped your body around and made a dash for the stairs when the man shot his foot out, tripping you. Taking a large tumble down the wooden set of stairs, you almost didn&rsquo;t care your head was bleeding and the fall had caused a large gash.&nbsp;</p><p>Scrambling up from the floor, you ran over around the kitchen counter to grab a knife when he shot in your direction, causing a scream to erupt from your throat. Swinging your hands across the counter, you successfully grabbed a decent sized knife and hid on the other side of the kitchen island. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? You don&rsquo;t wanna come out and play?&rdquo; He taunted you as you could hear the click of his boots approaching you. Gripping the knife so hard your knuckles became white, you held the weapon close to your body, ready to stab as he made it around the corner.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he took you by surprise, pinning you to the floor instead, kicking the knife feet away. &ldquo;Get off!&rdquo; You yelled through your rigid breathing. Watching as he picked up his gun and aimed it at your abdomen, you used all your strength to push his hand up, and he fired at the ceiling light, causing millions of glass shards to come raining down on the both of you. </p><p>Buying yourself some time with the glass shards, you picked up a large chunk and stuck it directly into his thigh. Hearing his blood curdling screams as he immediately retreated, you turned on your stomach, crawling for the knife, cutting your arms in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as you felt the material of the handle of the knife touch your fingertips, you gripped it tightly in your hand, turning and landing a clean slash to the man&rsquo;s hand as he made an attempt to reach for you once more.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You bitch!&rdquo; He seethed as he reached for his gun once more, but you were quicker this time. Letting out screams of anger, you lost it completely. You charged directly for the man, landing several stabs and lacerations to his abdomen and chest.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;DON&rsquo;T EVER TOUCH ME AGAIN!&rdquo;</i> You screamed as you plunged the knife into his body several more times. </p><p>Blood pooled around you and him both, covering not only the floor, but your hands, face, everything. Your hair was even clumped at the ends from being drenched in blood. Sitting over his body, you let the knife drop to the floor, making a metal clank as it did.&nbsp;</p><p>You were too infuriated to even notice you had been crying as well. Your entire body was shaking intensely. Turning your head to take in the mess you had caused, you noticed a figure in the corner of your eye. You slowly turned your head and noticed it was Jungkook. </p><p>He stood completely still. Baffled by the scene in front of him. You.. of all people.. Were capable of this? Your eyes traveled down to his hand to see him holding the same pistol from earlier. He had no words. And even if he did, he couldn&rsquo;t say them.&nbsp;</p><p>So he simply slowly neared you, putting his gun back into his waistband. Your response was just to just stare back at the lifeless body beneath you. His eyes were still open, staring lifelessly at the ceiling.&nbsp;</p><p>His clothes drenched in blood.. His hair stuck to his forehead. You began to feel sick.. Beginning to backpedal away from the body, Jungkook caught you in his arms and lifted you up. &ldquo;Jungkook I&hellip;&rdquo; You began as you wiped at your forehead. Looking down at your hands, you didn&rsquo;t even know if it was your blood or his now. And that scared you. </p><p>&ldquo;Shh.. Baby it&rsquo;s okay..&rdquo; He comforted. You began to feel panic arise in your chest as the reality of the situation dawned on you. &ldquo;Jungkook.. Jun- I- I killed.. I killed..&rdquo; You stuttered like a broken record.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.. Just breathe.. Look at me..&rdquo; Jungkook sat in front of you on the floor, holding your hands in his. Your frantic eyes searched for his, fearing he would never look at you the same.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.. Just keep your eyes on me baby..&rdquo; He breathed out as he rubbed his thumb over your bloodied face. &nbsp;&ldquo;I h-had t-to.&rdquo; You hiccupped as you let your head fall. &ldquo;I know. I know.&rdquo; He consoled. He glanced around the room, before pulling his phone out of his back pocket knowing who he needed to call. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phncsq8Orb1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Watching as Namjoon and some of his men pulled up in the driveway, you could tell he was genuinely concerned at your state.

You could see the hurt in his eyes, but you were still too scared.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Just say something. Please. Anything.&rdquo; He let his arms fall to his side in defeat. Watching as you still stood vacant, he sighed and turned around to head for the door.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; You quickly chimed. Even if you didn&rsquo;t want to talk, you still needed him here with you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk.. I&rsquo;ll talk.. Just don&rsquo;t leave me please..&rdquo; You stuttered as your fidgeted with your shirt. </p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave you&hellip;&rdquo; Jungkook responded quickly as he made he was back over towards you. You slowly began to peel your bloody shirt off, but struggled with the cuts on your arms.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Here..&rdquo; Jungkook whispered from behind you as he helped you lift it off with ease. The 2 of you just stood against each other for a moment before Jungkook spoke against your neck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never leave you.. And that&rsquo;s a promise.&rdquo; He spoke muffled into your skin as he left small butterfly kisses along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.. I know you&rsquo;re scared right now. And you think you&rsquo;re some monster..&rdquo; You closed your eyes at his words. It sounded even worse coming from him than it did in your own head. </p><p>&ldquo;But you aren&rsquo;t. You did it to survive Y/N.&rdquo; He turned you around to face him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you told me.. Just because you were dealt some bad cards doesn&rsquo;t mean it defines you.&rdquo; He pulled you into his bare chest, letting his hand rest on the back of your head.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it..&rdquo; You broke down. &ldquo;He was already dead and.. And I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself. I felt as if he would just come back and kill me and..&rdquo; Jungkook pulled your head back to face him and pressed a soft kiss to your lips.&nbsp;</p><p>You froze at the sudden contact, but slowly eased into it before he pulled away. &ldquo;You did what you had to do.. And I&rsquo;m sorry I couldn&rsquo;t have been there sooner.. I went to check the perimeter outside but once I heard your screams..&rdquo; Jungkook closed his eyes as if the memory had pained him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought..&rdquo; He choked up on his own words and you could see tears welling in his eyes. &ldquo;I thought I lost you.. And it would&rsquo;ve been my fault for leaving you there..&rdquo; Jungkook murmured as he pulled you into him once more.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t lose me.. It&rsquo;s okay..&rdquo; You consoled as you rubbed your hands up and down his back. It&rsquo;s usually what you did to calm him down when you two cuddled.&nbsp;</p><p>Slowly letting your arms fall as Jungkook pulled back to cup your face, you looked him in the eyes. &ldquo;You know how much I love you right..?&rdquo; Jungkook sniffled as he softly rubbed his thumb against your cheek once more.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Even like this?&rdquo; You let a small smile break as he had seemingly forgotten about your appearance. <i>&ldquo;Even like this.&rdquo;</i> He leaned down, pressing a kiss to your lips once more. &ldquo;Now how about that shower?&rdquo; He smiled as he pressed one more short kiss to your lips.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phncxfffFu1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Laying back in bed now with a new change of clothes and being ridden of the blood that coated your body, you clung tightly to Jungkook. You rested your head on his chest as his arm snaked around your waist holding you in close.</p><p>&nbsp;You both lied still against one another in the dark, listening in closely to the soft sound of each other&rsquo;s breathing. Listening as your head rose up and down in sync on his chest, you turned over slightly and pressed a small kiss to his chest.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; You mumbled into the fabric of his shirt. &ldquo;So much..&rdquo; You deeply inhaled the scent of him as you began to close your eyes. &ldquo;I love you more.&rdquo; Jungkook chimed back, as he ran his hands through your hair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always be here and I&rsquo;ll always love you no matter what Y/N.&rdquo; He breathed out as exhaustion fully took over and he inevitably drifted to sleep with you alongside him, safe. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phncxv4afq1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Waking up and reading the clock, <i>2:45AM</i>, You figured you better get a move on now. Glancing up from your spot beneath him, you watched as Jungkook slept soundly.&nbsp;</p><p>His lips slightly parted, his hair messy and covering his face, his chest rising and falling in sync. It pained you. It pained you to leave him. You didn&rsquo;t want to. You wanted to stay and be with him for the rest of your life, but you couldn&rsquo;t. </p><p>Slowly unhinging yourself from his arms, you let your feet fall against the carpeted floor and took a deep breath. Grabbing the small suitcase you found in that closet and shoved under the bed the night before, you slowly slid it out, and began to throw in whatever articles of clothing you could.&nbsp;</p><p>Rummaging through the closet as quietly as you could, you came across one of Jungkook&rsquo;s jackets. Slowly pulling it off the hanger, you held it delicately in your hands and pressed it against your face taking in the smell of him.&nbsp;Letting out a shaky breath as you did so.&nbsp;</p><p>You decided you&rsquo;d take it with you. Slipping it on over your frame, you zipped it up to hold it as close to your frame as possible. Something to remind you why you were doing this and that you would come back.</p><p>Zipping up the suitcase and setting it in the hallway, you quietly made your way back into the room with a pad of paper and a pen. Sitting on the floor at the edge of the bed, you began to write.</p><p>Wiping the tears that had began to drip down your face, you carefully rose from the floor and set the pen and paper on the nightstand next to Jungkook&rsquo;s sleeping figure.&nbsp;</p><p>Quickly wiping your tears, you neared the edge of the bed and pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead. <i>&ldquo;I love you so much.</i>&rdquo; You whispered before brushing some of the hair out of his face and backing away.</p><p>Not daring to turn around in fear of breaking down, you quietly and quickly exited the room, grabbing your suitcase and the spare keys to one of the cars in the garage. Making your way down the stairs, you let your eyes glance over at the spot where you had killed the man earlier, forcing yourself to face it to know why you were doing this.</p><p>Slamming the trunk shut as you loaded your suitcase, you walked around the car, climbing into the driver&rsquo;s seat.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking in a deep breath as you started the car, you began to reverse out of the driveway, taking in the house one more time, letting your eyes stop on the bedroom window. You really hoped to come back to him. Just like how things were in the beginning.</p><p>Taking off down the road, the house just became a mere image in the rearview mirror. Recalling the note you wrote to Jungkook, you let the tears freely fall now, as you knew you couldn&rsquo;t come back to him this time.</p><p><i>Dear Jungkook,</i></p><p><i>When you read this you will know I&rsquo;m gone. And I&rsquo;m so deeply sorry. I really am. I wish I could be with you. I wish I could be in your arms once more. I wish there could still be an us. </i></p><p><i>I am writing this to let you know I have left. And I&rsquo;m not quite sure where to, but I know I&rsquo;ll be okay. I am so grateful for everything you&rsquo;ve taught me and the unconditional love you&rsquo;ve shown me. I won&rsquo;t forget it or you. You&rsquo;ve come to be the absolute love of my life despite the situation we were put into. You are the most strongest and beautiful person I know and I&rsquo;m gonna need you to stay that way, okay? So please don&rsquo;t worry about me.. Worry about making things right with Namjoon and Yoongi. Worry about making a future that&rsquo;s safe for you. I know you can do it. I need to take some time to myself and figure out some things. But, I hope that when I return you&rsquo;ll still be there for me with open arms. No matter how long it may take, or how many obstacles I may run into, I will come back to you. You did it for me, as I will for you. I love you so so so much Jeon Jungkook. Thank you for loving me. I hope to see you soon.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>- Love, Y/N</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_phnd015A8L1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>(A/N: woo! it&rsquo;s finally finished! i&rsquo;m def a lot happier about how my writing is coming out since i&rsquo;m spending much more time on it now. also ngl i def cried while writing this lmaooo but i hope you guys like it! let me know if you do pls! i hope u have a great day/night! thanks!)</i></p>",
