This episode opens with those same themes as everyone grieves those lost in the battle and then enjoys a rare moment of community to celebrate life at the feast. </p><p>However, as Season 8 moves from the Long Night to the fight for the throne, the theme of choice comes roaring back with vengeance.</p><p>It starts with Jon\u2019s casual comment about Jorah choosing a way to die.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"160\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"earlingxtad:06JCIZ76vfeKOaZda6gIxA:Za-E3d2i02tvj\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/52e95534651922c1d14b0f61d7d68af4/tumblr_pr2kkmnyJf1wynixbo2_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"160\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><h2><b>JON</b>: I didn&rsquo;t know Ser Jorah well but I know this. If he could have <b>chosen</b> a way to die, it would have been protecting you.</h2><p>It\u2019s a reminder that Jorah chose Dany first. He was her first protector and the founding member of the Daenerys Targaryen fanclub. Later, he became her first true believer and devoted acolyte. When she walked into fire and emerged unscathed with three dragons, he fell to his knees as her first worshipper. He built the Church of Daenerys, he designed her altar, he maintained her shrine. Every one of her subsequent followers fall in line behind his example.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"176\" data-orig-width=\"266\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"mudhu:uqGiWyPDOa_C32efTOXEPg:ZpSWYy2hslTFK\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c4397dd75a6e6b8889a3b21c2f20d26/tumblr_pqptw2qmaG1qzabl1o5_r3_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"176\" data-orig-width=\"266\"/></figure><p>In 3.05 <i>Kissed By Fire,</i> when Ser Barristan asks if he believes in her, Jorah answers by defining the extent of his devotion: \u201cWith my whole heart.\u201d Then Ser Barristan notes that she\u2019ll have to wade through the muck of Westerosi politics if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms. In questioning his loyalty, Jorah offers the following direction:</p><h2><b>JORAH</b>: If we&rsquo;re truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, <b>no matter the cost</b>, no matter our pride.</h2><p>He takes to repeating this again later in 309 and others. The repetition is significant and worth remembering as this episode explores what that phrase may mean in practice.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"rose-tylers:FKGts7D994KSrhDruty5lw:ZCKAYm2i1uOIz\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/26cfc4c965c8c68ff51f910e20631f3b/tumblr_pr48c9iidJ1tlxeufo2_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>In 804, Tyrion uses similar Jorah-like language to describe his choice to support Dany. To Sansa, he says \u201cI believe in her.\u201d He expands on that to Varys.</p><h2><b>TYRION</b>: At a certain point, you <b>choose</b> a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.</h2><p>The question Sansa asks is why? Yes, we read her \u201cWhy her?\u201d as pure jealousy. But with the dragons flying overhead, it\u2019s also an explicit callback to 3 seasons ago when an exiled Tyrion asked the same question to Jorah in 5.06 <i>Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.</i></p><h2><b>TYRION</b>: Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert\u2019s Rebellion.<br/><b>JORAH</b>: Do you <b>believe</b> in anything?<br/><b>TYRION</b>: I <b>believe</b> in lots of things.<br/><b>JORAH</b>: In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The gods, destiny. Do you <b>believe</b> there\u2019s a plan for this world?<br/><b>TYRION</b>: No.<br/><b>JORAH</b>: Neither did I. I was a cynic just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out, I thought I\u2019d find her blackened bones. Instead, I saw her, Daenerys, alive and unhurt, holding her baby <b>dragons</b>. Have you ever heard baby <b>dragons</b> singing?<br/><b>TYRION</b>: No.<br/><b>JORAH</b>: It\u2019s hard to be a cynic after that.<br/><b>TYRION</b>: <b>Doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to be a great queen.</b><br/><b>JORAH</b>: No, it doesn\u2019t.<br/><b>TYRION</b>: The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? <b>Then what? </b>and prosperity?<br/><b>JORAH</b>: First we have to conquer the world.<br/><b>TYRION</b>: We? All right, let\u2019s assume your dreams come true. She\u2019s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies and watch her climb those steps and sit on the Iron Throne. Hurrah. Long live the queen. <b>Then what?</b><br/><b>JORAH</b>: Then she rules.<br/><b>TYRION</b>: So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros?<b> That\u2019s justice?</b><br/><b>JORAH</b>: She\u2019s the rightful heir.<br/><b>TYRION</b>: <b>Why? Because her father, who burned living men for amusement, was the king?</b></h2><p>These questions from way back when reverberate into Season 8 and this episode, where Dany shifts to fighting for the throne. Only it\u2019s not Tyrion asking these questions. It\u2019s Sansa.</p><p>By this point, Dany recognizes Sansa as her strongest dissenter. Dany wants Jon to stay silent about his new-found identity and swear Sam and Bran to secrecy. When Jon says he has to tell his sisters, Dany zeroes in on Sansa in particular. She objects to telling her because she believes that Sansa will want Dany gone and Jon on the throne. Jon remains resolute as she begs him to stay silent. When Jon doesn\u2019t budge, Dany makes a choice and turns her ask into an order.</p><h2><b>JON</b>: We can live together.<br/><b>DANY</b>: We can. I&rsquo;ve just told you how.</h2><p>In the war council, Dany faces two more choices: how and when to attack Cersei. When she expresses a strong preference for a full-strength attack, her advisors present an alternative that would spare the city and she reluctantly agrees.</p><p>However, next, Sansa notes the current state of the men Dany has to fight for her, citing exhaustion with many wounded. She suggests taking time for them to recuperate properly and asking the officers for a more detailed timeframe. This is a perfectly reasonable thought. Yet Dany reacts harshly at the mere mention of postponing, responding as if it\u2019s a personal attack. Sansa presses on.</p><h2><b>SANSA</b>: It&rsquo;s not just our people. It&rsquo;s yours. <b>You want to throw them into a war they&rsquo;re not ready to fight?</b><br/><b>DANY</b>: The longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become.\u00a0</h2><p>And so Dany makes her choice. To march exhausted and wounded men across the country and put them back on a battlefield.</p><p>Of note, Jon reacts to Sansa\u2019s fairly reasonable suggestion with a face that silently screams \u201cshutup\u201d, paired with his best \u201cJoffrey is the one true king\u201d impression. He ends echoing a Jorah-like subservience to Dany.</p><h2><b>JON</b>: What you command, we will obey.</h2><p>So, like Tyrion and Jorah, has Jon made his choice? Is Dany the queen he believes in?</p><p>No. Jon learned from Jorah what Dany valued and uses it as a mask to placate her. Political!Jon has never been more clearly laid out than in this war council scene, but if you\u2019re still questioning it? Just look at his choice.</p><p>Dany asked, begged, and then commanded Jon not to tell Sansa and Arya. But when the Starks stage an intervention, Jon makes his choice to tell them the truth, punctuated by Bran\u2019s words.</p><h2><b>BRAN</b>: It&rsquo;s your <b>choice</b>.</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dothrakidaenerys:yYSnVWdRR5WZdZXTe7j8CQ:ZU2bKk2i0KS_u\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a92af798d19b4bedc8d16c8a47e3684f/tumblr_pr2ghdx6xy1uxb9ydo3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>Jon chooses to defy the Dragon Queen.</p><p>By making this choice, he directly counters his words to her only a minute earlier.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"natalieedormer:TddSTFQBbc9smWezHcFIXA:Zj7X-q2i62Rm-\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7347729583b973b7983a6dea9ad452a/tumblr_praspk6CTJ1sd1t0so1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>Thus, confirming once and for all that his Jorah-like subservience is a mummer\u2019s farce. </p><p>Before Tyrion leaves, he chooses to talk to Sansa. He\u2019s worried about the relationship with the North and asks why Sansa provokes Dany.</p><p>She quickly recognizes what he won\u2019t admit: Tyrion\u2019s afraid of Dany. He tries to justify it as a necessary quality of a ruler, but she sees through it. A beat later, she\u2019s connecting it to Jon, turning to her worry for him going South. She gets more upset when Tyrion notes Jon isn\u2019t a Stark. He tries assuring her with reasons to support his queen.</p><h2><b>TYRION</b>: Her people love her, you&rsquo;ve seen that. You&rsquo;ve seen how they fight for her. She wants to make the world a better place. <b>I believe in her</b>.</h2><p>This is a curious couple of lines. Does he mean \u201cher people\u201d are her soldiers? Because only a couple of scenes earlier, Dany was lamenting to Jon about how no one loves her in Westeros. Regardless, none of that answers why she should rule. None of that answers why Tyrion believes in her.\u00a0</p><p>How did Tyrion change from that cynical questioner in 5.06 to another Jorah-like follower? The moment was so exact, D&amp;D spelled it out for viewers in their comments after the ep: Tyrion watching Dany fly off on a <b>dragon</b> in 5.09 <i>The Dance of Dragons </i>makes him think \u201cshe\u2019s the chosen one\u201d.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"389\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"itstevebucky:J5yIbNOVDlkXXsnlfLqqew:ZYhLgf2i3xBxp\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/32b719be9e957f83b89894d06d656df3/tumblr_pr7ht3fzSU1vi7m2lo8_r1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"389\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>See, the answer \u201cwhy her?\u201d was right above Sansa the entire time. It explains Jorah\u2019s support by his own words. It describes the source of Tyrion\u2019s support, by D&amp;D\u2019s own admission. And, most important to Sansa, it explains Jon\u2019s best Jorah impression. As Arya said at the heart tree, they needed her dragons and the armies that came with them to withstand the Long Night. By Dany\u2019s own admission, they were only there because of Jon. And now that the battle is won, Jon is left dealing with the consequences of a plan with no exit strategy.</p><p>Except one, which he never planned on. Sansa sees it as the one option available to free Jon from Dany\u2019s grasp and makes a choice.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dothrakidaenerys:yYSnVWdRR5WZdZXTe7j8CQ:ZU2bKk2h-w9BQ\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79b0bfd79d816619b8560bce7fbcf71b/tumblr_pr2e4iSOLl1uxb9ydo1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><h2><b>SANSA</b>: What if there&rsquo;s someone else? Someone better?</h2><p>Why does she do this? The answer is simple and she gives it to us earlier.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"400\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/72cef1e90f7430d6ff3142c3a43bbcca/tumblr_prd0qrdLaD1qe4qpe_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"400\"/></figure><p>[Gif <a href=\"https://tiny-little-bird.tumblr.com/post/184689061421/bonus-can-yall-smell-that-thats-right-it\">source</a> by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRP5sFx2owjKPvkSB4YbVpw\">@tiny-little-bird</a> ]</p><p>That\u2019s right. Sansa believes in Jon. What did Tyrion say? \u201cYou choose who to believe in and fight for that person?\u201d Well, this is Sansa fighting for Jon. Jon, who is currently so deeply drowning in the depths of an identity crisis, he says goodbye to his friends and gives away Ghost like he\u2019s marching to his death. If ever there was a time Jon needed someone fighting for him, it\u2019s now.</p><p>From here, things get interesting. Because Tyrion\u2019s been a hard one to pin down lately. He just got done trying to convince Sansa to support his queen and repeats he believes in her. Yet, once he receives information from Sansa about Jon as another choice, he chooses to tell Varys. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"231\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"midqueenally:yPPuGt9xe5CdiwSCgToBsg:Zdk4Gs1nQWrpi\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0dca2282acf99b4f339e01d4378a1bfe/tumblr_nq3tx8GouT1sqtgdgo2_r1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"231\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>Let\u2019s be clear, Tyrion knows full well Varys\u2019 prior objections to Dany\u2019s choices and his true allegiance to the realm. He tells Varys anyway, thus showing that his belief is not as firm as his words.</p><p>Moments later, Team Targ is attacked by the Iron Fleet. Dany loses a dragon, her ships are wrecked, her soldiers are left crawling to shore, and Missandei is in Cersei\u2019s hands.</p><p>Dany made the choice to leave when she did. And this is the result.</p><p>She responds to these consquences by again wanting to destroy King\u2019s Landing in retaliation. Varys, as promised in 7.02 <i>Stormborn,</i> tells her she\u2019s making a mistake.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"gameofthronesdaily:4UWOynN6ov3kMR13mdk3ZA:ZbYfhs2i2GmNf\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa4150b50f4c5cded50a90d8660659b5/tumblr_pr5lik9dOe1s95j2so1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><h2><b>VARYS</b>: Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.</h2><p>In response, Dany chooses what she\u2019s willing to sacrifice to win the throne.</p><h2><b>DANY</b>: Do you believe we&rsquo;re here for a reason, Lord Varys? I&rsquo;m here to free the world from tyrants. That is my <b>destiny</b> and I will serve it, <b>no matter the cost.</b></h2><p>Notice those last four words. They match Jorah\u2019s exactly. In an episode that opens on her grieving Jorah\u2019s death, that\u2019s no accident. His death is the fulfillment of these words as he most likely meant them: putting his life on the line for her. However, it sounds much different when Dany says them. She uses them to justify destroying cities, placing the grievous costs on others, to get what she wants: the throne. It tells us that she has no line. She\u2019s willing to do anything and everything.</p><p>It also however tragically fulfills Jorah\u2019s true legacy as a maker of a tyrant.</p><p>This theme of choices and talk of destiny reminded me of Stannis. Specifically, a conversation in 5.09 <i>The Dance of Dragons (</i>notably<i> </i>also directed by David Nutter).</p><p>Shireen is reading a book on The Dance of Dragons and summarizes what its about to Stannis. He poses a question.</p><h2><b>STANNIS</b>: If you had to <b>choose</b> between Rhaenyra and Aegon who would you have <b>chosen</b>?<br/><b>SHIREEN</b>: I wouldn&rsquo;t have <b>chosen</b> either. It&rsquo;s all the <b>choosing</b> sides that made everything so horrible.<br/><b>STANNIS</b>: Sometimes a person has to <b>choose</b>. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself the <b>choice</b> is no <b>choice</b> at all. He must fulfill his <b>destiny</b> and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.</h2><p>Stannis thought his destiny required him to burn his daughter at the stake to win a crown. He was wrong.</p><p>In Dany\u2019s choice to take the throne, no matter the cost, she\u2019ll be wrong too.</p><p>The question is who will stand by her. And who will stop her.</p><h2><b>VARYS</b>: Each of us has a <b>choice</b> to make. I pray we choose wisely.</h2>",

He was her first protector and the founding member of the Daenerys Targaryen fanclub. Later, he became her first true believer and devoted acolyte. When she walked into fire and emerged unscathed with three dragons, he fell to his knees as her first worshipper. He built the Church of Daenerys, he designed her altar, he maintained her shrine. Every one of her subsequent followers fall in line behind his example.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"176\" data-orig-width=\"266\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"mudhu:uqGiWyPDOa_C32efTOXEPg:ZpSWYy2hslTFK\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c4397dd75a6e6b8889a3b21c2f20d26/tumblr_pqptw2qmaG1qzabl1o5_r3_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"176\" data-orig-width=\"266\"></figure><p>In 3.05 <i>Kissed By Fire,</i> when Ser Barristan asks if he believes in her, Jorah answers by defining the extent of his devotion: \u201cWith my whole heart.\u201d Then Ser Barristan notes that she\u2019ll have to wade through the muck of Westerosi politics if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms. In questioning his loyalty, Jorah offers the following direction:</p><h2><b>JORAH</b>: If we\u2019re truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, <b>no matter the cost</b>, no matter our pride.</h2><p>He takes to repeating this again later in 309 and others. The repetition is significant and worth remembering as this episode explores what that phrase may mean in practice.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"rose-tylers:FKGts7D994KSrhDruty5lw:ZCKAYm2i1uOIz\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/26cfc4c965c8c68ff51f910e20631f3b/tumblr_pr48c9iidJ1tlxeufo2_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>In 804, Tyrion uses similar Jorah-like language to describe his choice to support Dany. To Sansa, he says \u201cI believe in her.\u201d He expands on that to Varys.</p><h2><b>TYRION</b>: At a certain point, you <b>choose</b> a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.</h2><p>The question Sansa asks is why? Yes, we read her \u201cWhy her?\u201d as pure jealousy. But with the dragons flying overhead, it\u2019s also an explicit callback to 3 seasons ago when an exiled Tyrion asked the same question to Jorah in 5.06 <i>Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.</i></p><h2><b>TYRION</b>: Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert\u2019s Rebellion.<br><b>JORAH</b>: Do you <b>believe</b> in anything?<br><b>TYRION</b>: I <b>believe</b> in lots of things.<br><b>JORAH</b>: In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The gods, destiny. Do you <b>believe</b> there\u2019s a plan for this world?<br><b>TYRION</b>: No.<br><b>JORAH</b>: Neither did I. I was a cynic just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out, I thought I\u2019d find her blackened bones. Instead, I saw her, Daenerys, alive and unhurt, holding her baby <b>dragons</b>. Have you ever heard baby <b>dragons</b> singing?<br><b>TYRION</b>: No.<br><b>JORAH</b>: It\u2019s hard to be a cynic after that.<br><b>TYRION</b>: <b>Doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to be a great queen.</b><br><b>JORAH</b>: No, it doesn\u2019t.<br><b>TYRION</b>: The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? <b>Then what? </b>and prosperity?<br><b>JORAH</b>: First we have to conquer the world.<br><b>TYRION</b>: We? All right, let\u2019s assume your dreams come true. She\u2019s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies and watch her climb those steps and sit on the Iron Throne. Hurrah. Long live the queen. <b>Then what?</b><br><b>JORAH</b>: Then she rules.<br><b>TYRION</b>: So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros?<b> That\u2019s justice?</b><br><b>JORAH</b>: She\u2019s the rightful heir.<br><b>TYRION</b>: <b>Why? Because her father, who burned living men for amusement, was the king?</b></h2><p>These questions from way back when reverberate into Season 8 and this episode, where Dany shifts to fighting for the throne. Only it\u2019s not Tyrion asking these questions. It\u2019s Sansa.</p><p>By this point, Dany recognizes Sansa as her strongest dissenter. Dany wants Jon to stay silent about his new-found identity and swear Sam and Bran to secrecy. When Jon says he has to tell his sisters, Dany zeroes in on Sansa in particular. She objects to telling her because she believes that Sansa will want Dany gone and Jon on the throne. Jon remains resolute as she begs him to stay silent. When Jon doesn\u2019t budge, Dany makes a choice and turns her ask into an order.</p><h2><b>JON</b>: We can live together.<br><b>DANY</b>: We can. I\u2019ve just told you how.</h2><p>In the war council, Dany faces two more choices: how and when to attack Cersei. When she expresses a strong preference for a full-strength attack, her advisors present an alternative that would spare the city and she reluctantly agrees.</p><p>However, next, Sansa notes the current state of the men Dany has to fight for her, citing exhaustion with many wounded. She suggests taking time for them to recuperate properly and asking the officers for a more detailed timeframe. This is a perfectly reasonable thought. Yet Dany reacts harshly at the mere mention of postponing, responding as if it\u2019s a personal attack. Sansa presses on.</p><h2><b>SANSA</b>: It\u2019s not just our people. It\u2019s yours. <b>You want to throw them into a war they\u2019re not ready to fight?</b><br><b>DANY</b>: The longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become.\u00a0</h2><p>And so Dany makes her choice. To march exhausted and wounded men across the country and put them back on a battlefield.</p><p>Of note, Jon reacts to Sansa\u2019s fairly reasonable suggestion with a face that silently screams \u201cshutup\u201d, paired with his best \u201cJoffrey is the one true king\u201d impression. He ends echoing a Jorah-like subservience to Dany.</p><h2><b>JON</b>: What you command, we will obey.</h2><p>So, like Tyrion and Jorah, has Jon made his choice? Is Dany the queen he believes in?</p><p>No. Jon learned from Jorah what Dany valued and uses it as a mask to placate her. Political!Jon has never been more clearly laid out than in this war council scene, but if you\u2019re still questioning it? Just look at his choice.</p><p>Dany asked, begged, and then commanded Jon not to tell Sansa and Arya. But when the Starks stage an intervention, Jon makes his choice to tell them the truth, punctuated by Bran\u2019s words.</p><h2><b>BRAN</b>: It\u2019s your <b>choice</b>.</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dothrakidaenerys:yYSnVWdRR5WZdZXTe7j8CQ:ZU2bKk2i0KS_u\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a92af798d19b4bedc8d16c8a47e3684f/tumblr_pr2ghdx6xy1uxb9ydo3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>Jon chooses to defy the Dragon Queen.</p><p>By making this choice, he directly counters his words to her only a minute earlier.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"natalieedormer:TddSTFQBbc9smWezHcFIXA:Zj7X-q2i62Rm-\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7347729583b973b7983a6dea9ad452a/tumblr_praspk6CTJ1sd1t0so1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>Thus, confirming once and for all that his Jorah-like subservience is a mummer\u2019s farce. </p><p>Before Tyrion leaves, he chooses to talk to Sansa. He\u2019s worried about the relationship with the North and asks why Sansa provokes Dany.</p><p>She quickly recognizes what he won\u2019t admit: Tyrion\u2019s afraid of Dany. He tries to justify it as a necessary quality of a ruler, but she sees through it. A beat later, she\u2019s connecting it to Jon, turning to her worry for him going South. She gets more upset when Tyrion notes Jon isn\u2019t a Stark. He tries assuring her with reasons to support his queen.</p><h2><b>TYRION</b>: Her people love her, you\u2019ve seen that. You\u2019ve seen how they fight for her. She wants to make the world a better place. <b>I believe in her</b>.</h2><p>This is a curious couple of lines. Does he mean \u201cher people\u201d are her soldiers? Because only a couple of scenes earlier, Dany was lamenting to Jon about how no one loves her in Westeros. Regardless, none of that answers why she should rule. None of that answers why Tyrion believes in her.\u00a0</p><p>How did Tyrion change from that cynical questioner in 5.06 to another Jorah-like follower? The moment was so exact, D&amp;D spelled it out for viewers in their comments after the ep: Tyrion watching Dany fly off on a <b>dragon</b> in 5.09 <i>The Dance of Dragons </i>makes him think \u201cshe\u2019s the chosen one\u201d.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"389\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"itstevebucky:J5yIbNOVDlkXXsnlfLqqew:ZYhLgf2i3xBxp\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/32b719be9e957f83b89894d06d656df3/tumblr_pr7ht3fzSU1vi7m2lo8_r1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"389\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>See, the answer \u201cwhy her?\u201d was right above Sansa the entire time. It explains Jorah\u2019s support by his own words. It describes the source of Tyrion\u2019s support, by D&amp;D\u2019s own admission. And, most important to Sansa, it explains Jon\u2019s best Jorah impression. As Arya said at the heart tree, they needed her dragons and the armies that came with them to withstand the Long Night. By Dany\u2019s own admission, they were only there because of Jon. And now that the battle is won, Jon is left dealing with the consequences of a plan with no exit strategy.</p><p>Except one, which he never planned on. Sansa sees it as the one option available to free Jon from Dany\u2019s grasp and makes a choice.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dothrakidaenerys:yYSnVWdRR5WZdZXTe7j8CQ:ZU2bKk2h-w9BQ\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79b0bfd79d816619b8560bce7fbcf71b/tumblr_pr2e4iSOLl1uxb9ydo1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><h2><b>SANSA</b>: What if there\u2019s someone else? Someone better?</h2><p>Why does she do this? The answer is simple and she gives it to us earlier.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"400\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/72cef1e90f7430d6ff3142c3a43bbcca/tumblr_prd0qrdLaD1qe4qpe_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"400\"></figure><p>[Gif <a href=\"https://tiny-little-bird.tumblr.com/post/184689061421/bonus-can-yall-smell-that-thats-right-it\">source</a> by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRP5sFx2owjKPvkSB4YbVpw\">@tiny-little-bird</a> ]</p><p>That\u2019s right. Sansa believes in Jon. What did Tyrion say? \u201cYou choose who to believe in and fight for that person?\u201d Well, this is Sansa fighting for Jon. Jon, who is currently so deeply drowning in the depths of an identity crisis, he says goodbye to his friends and gives away Ghost like he\u2019s marching to his death. If ever there was a time Jon needed someone fighting for him, it\u2019s now.</p><p>From here, things get interesting. Because Tyrion\u2019s been a hard one to pin down lately. He just got done trying to convince Sansa to support his queen and repeats he believes in her. Yet, once he receives information from Sansa about Jon as another choice, he chooses to tell Varys. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"231\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"midqueenally:yPPuGt9xe5CdiwSCgToBsg:Zdk4Gs1nQWrpi\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0dca2282acf99b4f339e01d4378a1bfe/tumblr_nq3tx8GouT1sqtgdgo2_r1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"231\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>Let\u2019s be clear, Tyrion knows full well Varys\u2019 prior objections to Dany\u2019s choices and his true allegiance to the realm. He tells Varys anyway, thus showing that his belief is not as firm as his words.</p><p>Moments later, Team Targ is attacked by the Iron Fleet. Dany loses a dragon, her ships are wrecked, her soldiers are left crawling to shore, and Missandei is in Cersei\u2019s hands.</p><p>Dany made the choice to leave when she did. And this is the result.</p><p>She responds to these consquences by again wanting to destroy King\u2019s Landing in retaliation. Varys, as promised in 7.02 <i>Stormborn,</i> tells her she\u2019s making a mistake.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"gameofthronesdaily:4UWOynN6ov3kMR13mdk3ZA:ZbYfhs2i2GmNf\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa4150b50f4c5cded50a90d8660659b5/tumblr_pr5lik9dOe1s95j2so1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><h2><b>VARYS</b>: Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.</h2><p>In response, Dany chooses what she\u2019s willing to sacrifice to win the throne.</p><h2><b>DANY</b>: Do you believe we\u2019re here for a reason, Lord Varys? I\u2019m here to free the world from tyrants. That is my <b>destiny</b> and I will serve it, <b>no matter the cost.</b></h2><p>Notice those last four words. They match Jorah\u2019s exactly. In an episode that opens on her grieving Jorah\u2019s death, that\u2019s no accident. His death is the fulfillment of these words as he most likely meant them: putting his life on the line for her. However, it sounds much different when Dany says them. She uses them to justify destroying cities, placing the grievous costs on others, to get what she wants: the throne. It tells us that she has no line. She\u2019s willing to do anything and everything.</p><p>It also however tragically fulfills Jorah\u2019s true legacy as a maker of a tyrant.</p><p>This theme of choices and talk of destiny reminded me of Stannis. Specifically, a conversation in 5.09 <i>The Dance of Dragons (</i>notably<i> </i>also directed by David Nutter).</p><p>Shireen is reading a book on The Dance of Dragons and summarizes what its about to Stannis. He poses a question.</p><h2><b>STANNIS</b>: If you had to <b>choose</b> between Rhaenyra and Aegon who would you have <b>chosen</b>?<br><b>SHIREEN</b>: I wouldn\u2019t have <b>chosen</b> either. It\u2019s all the <b>choosing</b> sides that made everything so horrible.<br><b>STANNIS</b>: Sometimes a person has to <b>choose</b>. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself the <b>choice</b> is no <b>choice</b> at all. He must fulfill his <b>destiny</b> and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.</h2><p>Stannis thought his destiny required him to burn his daughter at the stake to win a crown. He was wrong.</p><p>In Dany\u2019s choice to take the throne, no matter the cost, she\u2019ll be wrong too.</p><p>The question is who will stand by her. And who will stop her.</p><h2><b>VARYS</b>: Each of us has a <b>choice</b> to make. I pray we choose wisely.</h2></p>",

Have you ever heard baby <b>dragons</b> singing?<br><b>TYRION</b>: No.<br><b>JORAH</b>: It\u2019s hard to be a cynic after that.<br><b>TYRION</b>: <b>Doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to be a great queen.</b><br><b>JORAH</b>: No, it doesn\u2019t.<br><b>TYRION</b>: The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? <b>Then what? </b>and prosperity?<br><b>JORAH</b>: First we have to conquer the world.<br><b>TYRION</b>: We? All right, let\u2019s assume your dreams come true. She\u2019s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies and watch her climb those steps and sit on the Iron Throne. Hurrah. Long live the queen. <b>Then what?</b><br><b>JORAH</b>: Then she rules.<br><b>TYRION</b>: So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros?<b> That\u2019s justice?</b><br><b>JORAH</b>: She\u2019s the rightful heir.<br><b>TYRION</b>: <b>Why? Because her father, who burned living men for amusement, was the king?</b></h2><p>These questions from way back when reverberate into Season 8 and this episode, where Dany shifts to fighting for the throne. Only it\u2019s not Tyrion asking these questions. It\u2019s Sansa.</p><p>By this point, Dany recognizes Sansa as her strongest dissenter. Dany wants Jon to stay silent about his new-found identity and swear Sam and Bran to secrecy. When Jon says he has to tell his sisters, Dany zeroes in on Sansa in particular. She objects to telling her because she believes that Sansa will want Dany gone and Jon on the throne. Jon remains resolute as she begs him to stay silent. When Jon doesn\u2019t budge, Dany makes a choice and turns her ask into an order.</p><h2><b>JON</b>: We can live together.<br><b>DANY</b>: We can. I\u2019ve just told you how.</h2><p>In the war council, Dany faces two more choices: how and when to attack Cersei. When she expresses a strong preference for a full-strength attack, her advisors present an alternative that would spare the city and she reluctantly agrees.</p><p>However, next, Sansa notes the current state of the men Dany has to fight for her, citing exhaustion with many wounded. She suggests taking time for them to recuperate properly and asking the officers for a more detailed timeframe. This is a perfectly reasonable thought. Yet Dany reacts harshly at the mere mention of postponing, responding as if it\u2019s a personal attack. Sansa presses on.</p><h2><b>SANSA</b>: It\u2019s not just our people. It\u2019s yours. <b>You want to throw them into a war they\u2019re not ready to fight?</b><br><b>DANY</b>: The longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become.\u00a0</h2><p>And so Dany makes her choice. To march exhausted and wounded men across the country and put them back on a battlefield.</p><p>Of note, Jon reacts to Sansa\u2019s fairly reasonable suggestion with a face that silently screams \u201cshutup\u201d, paired with his best \u201cJoffrey is the one true king\u201d impression. He ends echoing a Jorah-like subservience to Dany.</p><h2><b>JON</b>: What you command, we will obey.</h2><p>So, like Tyrion and Jorah, has Jon made his choice? Is Dany the queen he believes in?</p><p>No. Jon learned from Jorah what Dany valued and uses it as a mask to placate her. Political!Jon has never been more clearly laid out than in this war council scene, but if you\u2019re still questioning it? Just look at his choice.</p><p>Dany asked, begged, and then commanded Jon not to tell Sansa and Arya. But when the Starks stage an intervention, Jon makes his choice to tell them the truth, punctuated by Bran\u2019s words.</p><h2><b>BRAN</b>: It\u2019s your <b>choice</b>.</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dothrakidaenerys:yYSnVWdRR5WZdZXTe7j8CQ:ZU2bKk2i0KS_u\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a92af798d19b4bedc8d16c8a47e3684f/tumblr_pr2ghdx6xy1uxb9ydo3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>Jon chooses to defy the Dragon Queen.</p><p>By making this choice, he directly counters his words to her only a minute earlier.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"natalieedormer:TddSTFQBbc9smWezHcFIXA:Zj7X-q2i62Rm-\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7347729583b973b7983a6dea9ad452a/tumblr_praspk6CTJ1sd1t0so1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>Thus, confirming once and for all that his Jorah-like subservience is a mummer\u2019s farce. </p><p>Before Tyrion leaves, he chooses to talk to Sansa. He\u2019s worried about the relationship with the North and asks why Sansa provokes Dany.</p><p>She quickly recognizes what he won\u2019t admit: Tyrion\u2019s afraid of Dany. He tries to justify it as a necessary quality of a ruler, but she sees through it. A beat later, she\u2019s connecting it to Jon, turning to her worry for him going South. She gets more upset when Tyrion notes Jon isn\u2019t a Stark. He tries assuring her with reasons to support his queen.</p><h2><b>TYRION</b>: Her people love her, you\u2019ve seen that. You\u2019ve seen how they fight for her. She wants to make the world a better place. <b>I believe in her</b>.</h2><p>This is a curious couple of lines. Does he mean \u201cher people\u201d are her soldiers? Because only a couple of scenes earlier, Dany was lamenting to Jon about how no one loves her in Westeros. Regardless, none of that answers why she should rule. None of that answers why Tyrion believes in her.\u00a0</p><p>How did Tyrion change from that cynical questioner in 5.06 to another Jorah-like follower? The moment was so exact, D&amp;D spelled it out for viewers in their comments after the ep: Tyrion watching Dany fly off on a <b>dragon</b> in 5.09 <i>The Dance of Dragons </i>makes him think \u201cshe\u2019s the chosen one\u201d.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"389\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"itstevebucky:J5yIbNOVDlkXXsnlfLqqew:ZYhLgf2i3xBxp\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/32b719be9e957f83b89894d06d656df3/tumblr_pr7ht3fzSU1vi7m2lo8_r1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"389\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>See, the answer \u201cwhy her?\u201d was right above Sansa the entire time.

And now that the battle is won, Jon is left dealing with the consequences of a plan with no exit strategy.</p><p>Except one, which he never planned on.

                "content": "<p><h2>Character Choices in GOT 804</h2><p>For the buildup to the Long Night, the first half of Season 8 featured themes of unity and togetherness. This episode opens with those same themes as everyone grieves those lost in the battle and then enjoys a rare moment of community to celebrate life at the feast. </p><p>However, as Season 8 moves from the Long Night to the fight for the throne, the theme of choice comes roaring back with vengeance.</p><p>It starts with Jon&rsquo;s casual comment about Jorah choosing a way to die.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2><b>JON</b>: I didn&rsquo;t know Ser Jorah well but I know this. If he could have <b>chosen</b> a way to die, it would have been protecting you.</h2><p>It&rsquo;s a reminder that Jorah chose Dany first. He was her first protector and the founding member of the Daenerys Targaryen fanclub. Later, he became her first true believer and devoted acolyte. When she walked into fire and emerged unscathed with three dragons, he fell to his knees as her first worshipper. He built the Church of Daenerys, he designed her altar, he maintained her shrine. Every one of her subsequent followers fall in line behind his example.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>In 3.05 <i>Kissed By Fire,</i> when Ser Barristan asks if he believes in her, Jorah answers by defining the extent of his devotion: &ldquo;With my whole heart.&rdquo; Then Ser Barristan notes that she&rsquo;ll have to wade through the muck of Westerosi politics if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms. In questioning his loyalty, Jorah offers the following direction:</p><h2><b>JORAH</b>: If we&rsquo;re truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, <b>no matter the cost</b>, no matter our pride.</h2><p>He takes to repeating this again later in 309 and others. The repetition is significant and worth remembering as this episode explores what that phrase may mean in practice.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>In 804, Tyrion uses similar Jorah-like language to describe his choice to support Dany. To Sansa, he says &ldquo;I believe in her.&rdquo; He expands on that to Varys.</p><h2><b>TYRION</b>: At a certain point, you <b>choose</b> a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.</h2><p>The question Sansa asks is why? Yes, we read her &ldquo;Why her?&rdquo; as pure jealousy. But with the dragons flying overhead, it&rsquo;s also an explicit callback to 3 seasons ago when an exiled Tyrion asked the same question to Jorah in 5.06 <i>Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.</i></p><h2><b>TYRION</b>: Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion.<br /><b>JORAH</b>: Do you <b>believe</b> in anything?<br /><b>TYRION</b>: I <b>believe</b> in lots of things.<br /><b>JORAH</b>: In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The gods, destiny. Do you <b>believe</b> there&rsquo;s a plan for this world?<br /><b>TYRION</b>: No.<br /><b>JORAH</b>: Neither did I. I was a cynic just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out, I thought I&rsquo;d find her blackened bones. Instead, I saw her, Daenerys, alive and unhurt, holding her baby <b>dragons</b>. Have you ever heard baby <b>dragons</b> singing?<br /><b>TYRION</b>: No.<br /><b>JORAH</b>: It&rsquo;s hard to be a cynic after that.<br /><b>TYRION</b>: <b>Doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s going to be a great queen.</b><br /><b>JORAH</b>: No, it doesn&rsquo;t.<br /><b>TYRION</b>: The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? <b>Then what? </b>and prosperity?<br /><b>JORAH</b>: First we have to conquer the world.<br /><b>TYRION</b>: We? All right, let&rsquo;s assume your dreams come true.

This the first part of two.)</p><p>*</p><p><i>It&rsquo;s a sunny day despite the freezing air. It isn&rsquo;t snowing. The breath condenses in front of him, a sign that despite everything, he is continuing to breathe. He feels his lungs on fire, as if he&rsquo;s underwater</i>.</p><p><i>The walls are high and thick, with wooden posts built upon the battlements, on which tens of scorpion bolts are placed</i>.</p><p><i>Cersei Lannister is on one of these. She has a smile that drives him to leave the ranks of soldiers and advance towards the closed doors of the city under siege.</i></p><p><i>It spreads\u00a0fear\u00a0and threat of terror. A chilling dread.</i></p><p><i>His worst fear materializes in the glimpse of red hair behind her. He wants to scream. Instead he remains paralyzed with horror, the only noise being the pulsing buzz of blood in his ears.

Gods.</p><p><i>Sansa takes a step forward and from the way she moves no one would guess she is about to die. She will not beg nor she will run away.

He is soaked in cold sweat.</p><p>It was just a dream. A nightmare.</p><p>Sansa is safe, in Winterfell. He made sure for it to happen.</p><p>He closes his eyes and shreds of images run through his mind. No matter how hard he tries, he can&rsquo;t delete them from memory. Deep roots like those of a heart tree are wedged inside him.</p><p>After that night, it becomes a recurring dream. See her die, night after night, again and again.</p><p>Despite his attempts, every time something inside him seems to break and the craving for home becomes agonizing.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;They had to be full of water and instead were empty! How is that possible?&rdquo;</p><p>Of all those present, no one speaks. Tyrion stirs by the queen&rsquo;s side and Varys remains inscrutable. Davos exchanges a look with Gendry and takes a step forward.</p><p>&ldquo;With all due respect, my lord, Gendry and I were in charge of filling them,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We can both confirm that they were full when we delivered them to Gray Worm.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon closes his eyes. His hands are locked around the table on which the map of King&rsquo;s Landing is deployed. His knuckles turn white. When he stares at Gray Worm, he in his usual position, next to Daenerys, with his arms crossed behind his back.</p><p>&ldquo;You ordered them to be emptied,&rdquo; he accuses him, but his voice sounds more tired than really angry. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>Gray Worm doesn&rsquo;t so much as look at him. When he speaks, he turns and looks at the queen, as if the presence and opinion of others are of no relevance to him. &ldquo;That woman is like the Masters and we will treat her the same way.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys doesn&rsquo;t respond, but her face shows the same hardness that she hasn&rsquo;t lost since Missandei&rsquo;s death. She puts her hand on his elbow.</p><p>Jon thinks about Mance Rayder. Burnt alive is something he wouldn&rsquo;t wish to anyone, not even to his worst enemy.</p><p>The plan was to burn a small portion of the Flea Bottom, a displaced area and according to reliable sources now uninhabited, and at the same time to launch with catapults barrels of water to extinguish the flames. A play to show the devastating power of a dragon, the threat behind the warning, and have mercy, give a clear message that they are not the true enemy, but that they could become one.</p><p>To do something, quieting the desire for bloodbath of the Unsellied.</p><p>&ldquo;What about the women and children who could have died?&rdquo;</p><p>Gray Worm doesn&rsquo;t blink. &ldquo;There are always casualties in war.&rdquo; Everyone knows that he is referring to Missandei. </p><p>Out of the corner of his eye he sees Tyrion flinch under Daenerys&rsquo; glare.</p><p>&ldquo;You knew it?&rdquo; He brutally asks her.</p><p>Daenerys&rsquo;s eyes catalyses on him, losing some of her coolness. She hesitates, as if evaluating the options. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Jon nods, trying to mask the relief he is feeling.</p><p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s insubordination,&rdquo; he says gravely. From the way she is staring at him, Jon senses that she has already figured out what this means.</p><p>&ldquo;I respected you as commander, but what you did today was unforgivable. We can&rsquo;t fight a war if we don&rsquo;t trust each other.&rdquo;</p><p>When they are alone, Daenerys&rsquo; fury is incandescent. &ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; There is a ferocity in her eyes, the look of a bear mother to which were killed all her cubs, one after the other. &ldquo;Gray Worm is my commander, a trusted man of the queen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He disobeyed an order! What example would we give to the other commanders if he remains unpunished?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will not punish him just because he sought justice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t justice! It was revenge! If we start acting this way, what makes us better than Cersei Lannister?&rdquo;</p><p>He knows he has convinced her when he sees her shrink under the weight of that umpteenth loss.</p><p>He would like to comfort her, but as a coward he turns his back and leaves.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;My queen, we were willing to follow you and serve you to the ends of the world.&rdquo; Gray Worm is kneeling in front of Daenerys, like a loyal, faithful subject. &ldquo;We did it. I can reach her now. Will you bury us in Naath?&rdquo;</p><p>The queen&rsquo;s eyes are shiny and she is pale as the moon while she nods and promises to fulfill his last wish.</p><p>After Gray Worm dies, Daenerys remains, staring at his lifeless body.</p><p>When Jon approaches, she turns around. Her braids are ruffled by the wind and the hardness has reached her eyes. He immediately realizes that he has lost her fully.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t force a dragon to behave like a sheep,&rdquo; she murmurs and her fury is blinding, mixed with grief. &ldquo;At dawn I will set the city on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Jon enters the queen&rsquo;s tent last. It seems to him that only a few moments have passed since Gray Worm&rsquo;s execution. He tried to talk to Daenerys, but she took off with Drogon. He spent the last few hours among the ranks of soldiers, organizing water supplies with Davos.</p><p>When he enters, silence falls like a sword. Every gaze is fixed on him, every word truncated while it was spoken, each head turns and between them stands out one of a bright red.</p><p>Jon blinks and thinks it&rsquo;s a hallucination, an illusion due to the lack of light in the tent lit by candles. But the head remains red and the face is just that of -</p><p>&ldquo;Tormund? Why are you here? I thought-&rdquo; <i>That we would never see each other again.</i></p><p>Tormund embraces him, a proud and bone-breaking hug. When he lets go, giving him one last pat on the shoulder, Jon notices his grim expression. The smile dies on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t let anyone else tell you.&rdquo; His hand remains firm on his shoulder. Something cold and slimy grabs him by the scruff. &ldquo;We were one day walking towards the North when your beast reached me. He was covered in blood. I went back immediately, but it was too late.&rdquo;</p><p>His mind is a whirlwind of alternatives. Winterfell burned to the ground. Sansa, Arya and Bran killed -</p><p>&ldquo;They took her, boy. Those fucking bastards took your sister.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which of the two?&rdquo; Someone asks.</p><p>He and Tormund snap their heads to their right.</p><p>Tyrion raises his hands, as conciliator as usual. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a legitimate question,&rdquo; he defends himself. &ldquo;Jon has two sisters, Lady Sansa and Lady Arya.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; Tormund replies in a grunt. His grumpy voice seems to come from far away. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the one they took.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa. They took Sansa.</p><p>&ldquo;Why? What do they hope to achieve?&rdquo; asks Davos.</p><p>&ldquo;An interesting question mainly because it provides multiple answers,&rdquo; intervenes Varys. &ldquo;They could use her as a hostage. Or simply exploit her name. Let&rsquo;s not forget that she remains the key to the North.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa has been kidnapped. At this very moment she could be at the mercy of Cersei Lannister. Suddenly his stomach is twisted and his vision blurred.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon-&rdquo; begins Davos.</p><p>&ldquo;He is a bastard,&rdquo; Varys interrupts him without half measures, &ldquo;and unless the queen doesn&rsquo;t legitimize him as she did with the bastard of Robert Baratheon, the only legitimate heir that can continue the lineage are her and Lady Arya.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon forces himself not to think about Sansa, the thousand ways she could be tortured. Her wounded and swollen skin, her piercing screams of pain.</p><p>There is a sudden silence, full of tension. He has recently started breathing again normally when he meets Daenerys&rsquo; gaze. It contain pity, but also something that he cannot define, as if a light illuminates it from within. &ldquo;Family names are handed down from father to son,&rdquo; Daenerys states. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not in Dorne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; Varys contradicts. Daenerys finally looks away from him. &ldquo;There have been cases, your grace, when no male heirs were available. Also in your family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo; Davos questions. &ldquo;Obviously we cannot proceed as originally agreed, not now that we know that Lady Sansa is within the city.&rdquo;</p><p>He is obviously referring to the old plan, the one that provided for localized fires, for closing the access to the sea. To win the war by exhaustion.</p><p>Most of the men are waiting for his word, but he looks at Daenerys, at her lips curved downwards. He&rsquo;s shivering inside.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to change our strategy.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment he is sure he has misunderstood. He must have hear wrong. He realizes\u00a0this isn&rsquo;t the case from Davos&rsquo; obvious discomfort, Gendry&rsquo;s disbelief, Tormund&rsquo;s confusion and the exchange of glances between Tyrion and Varys.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; His voice sounds hoarse and harsh. It&rsquo;s the first time he speaks. Anger blooms in his chest like a flower of fire. Makes him almost feverish. He feels less powerless. &ldquo;If Sansa is in there, is all the more reason not to set the whole city on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys&rsquo;s face doesn&rsquo;t change expression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for your loss, but your sister is brave. I&rsquo;m sure -&rdquo;</p><p>He won&rsquo;t let her finish. He doesn&rsquo;t want to hear. &ldquo;Out.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t scream, but the tone he used doesn&rsquo;t leave other possible interpretations. It is a mandatory, imperative order. &ldquo;All of you. Leave us alone.&rdquo;</p><p>They do as he said and passing by Tyrion stops near him. He seems to want to tell him something, but in the end he closes his mouth and shakes the head.</p><p>Left alone, he turns to her, blinded by a black fury. &ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;ll let you kill my sister-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not your sister.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my family,&rdquo; he growls.</p><p>She raises her chin and there is a quiet determination in her, a plea and a need, something that shakes him deeply when she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your family too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So\u00a0did we get to this point? Do you force me to choose between Sansa&rsquo;s life and you?&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys approaches and when she rests her hands on the sides of his face, he feels the strangest of sensations. They are familiar hands, whose touch he should recognize. It isn&rsquo;t so. &ldquo;I ask you to choose between the future and the past.&rdquo;</p><p>He feels drained, as if he had been deprived of something. He doesn&rsquo;t even know what it is. Only that it is of fundamental importance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong. You can&rsquo;t choose between the two. There&rsquo;s no future without a past.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re choosing her.&rdquo;</p><p>He grabs her wrists and sighs, before gently turning away from her. &ldquo;There are other ways to take the city. Safer ways.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Slower,&rdquo; she replies, frowning.</p><p>Jon can&rsquo;t tell her it&rsquo;s not true. &ldquo;Righteous.&rdquo;</p><p>He has one foot out of the tent when her voice reaches him. &ldquo;Do you think she will be treated with respect? All say the opposite. Even if you could save her, think of the state in which you will find her.&rdquo;</p><p>He squints his eyes painfully. After a moment he leaves.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;We can save her, little crow. Your sister is Ladyluck after all.&rdquo;</p><p>He looks optimistic, but it&rsquo;s a farce.</p><p><i>LadyLuck</i>. He doesn&rsquo;t remember the moment when Tormund started calling Sansa that way. He would like to remember.</p><p>Kissed by fire, he thinks. But that didn&rsquo;t save Ygritte.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to\u00a0throw up, just do it now.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon keeps staring at the fire. &ldquo;Everything I did, I did it for them,&rdquo; he mutters. <i>For her</i>. &ldquo;I said goodbye to my home, to my family to protect them and now-&rdquo; now she will never know why he did it. She will always think that he has turned his back to the North, to her.</p><p>&ldquo;How could this happen?&rdquo; Where was everybody when it happened? </p><p>Here they are again. Disappointment, frustration, disgust,\u00a0outrage. He wants to smash everything to smithereens. He clenches his jaw and throw a log of wood into the fire. There is a high flame before the wood begins to crackle and burn.</p><p>&ldquo;The she-wolf was gone a day after you. I thought I would find her here. The giant woman has disappeared so they must have taken her too.&rdquo;</p><p>Therefore Sansa isn&rsquo;t alone.</p><p>There is still something that is consuming a corner of his mind. &ldquo;Tormund. You said that Ghost reached you. Wasn&rsquo;t he with you?&rdquo;</p><p>He scratches at his beard. &ldquo;He never left the castle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She has a way with words.&rdquo; Tormund shrugs and grins smugly. &ldquo;All she had to do was to shed a few tears from her pretty blue eyes for the damn beast to run into her open arms.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon frowns. Why Sansa should care-</p><p>Tormund knows him well enough to understand what he is thinking. &ldquo;Are you fucking kidding? The girl loves your beast. When you were stuck in the South they were butt buddies. Didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p><p>Something seems to compress in his chest. &ldquo;I asked him to protect her in my place. I had forgotten.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You forgot enough, didn&rsquo;t you? Do you remember who you are?&rdquo;</p><p>Yes, he thinks and it has never been more true.</p>",

Also in your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d Davos questions. \u201cObviously we cannot proceed as originally agreed, not now that we know that Lady Sansa is within the city.\u201d</p><p>He is obviously referring to the old plan, the one that provided for localized fires, for closing the access to the sea. To win the war by exhaustion.</p><p>Most of the men are waiting for his word, but he looks at Daenerys, at her lips curved downwards. He\u2019s shivering inside.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to change our strategy.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he is sure he has misunderstood. He must have hear wrong. He realizes\u00a0this isn\u2019t the case from Davos\u2019 obvious discomfort, Gendry\u2019s disbelief, Tormund\u2019s confusion and the exchange of glances between Tyrion and Varys.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d His voice sounds hoarse and harsh. It\u2019s the first time he speaks. Anger blooms in his chest like a flower of fire. Makes him almost feverish. He feels less powerless. \u201cIf Sansa is in there, is all the more reason not to set the whole city on fire.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys\u2019s face doesn\u2019t change expression. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss, but your sister is brave. I\u2019m sure -\u201d</p><p>He won\u2019t let her finish. He doesn\u2019t want to hear. \u201cOut.\u201d He doesn\u2019t scream, but the tone he used doesn\u2019t leave other possible interpretations. It is a mandatory, imperative order. \u201cAll of you. Leave us alone.\u201d</p><p>They do as he said and passing by Tyrion stops near him. He seems to want to tell him something, but in the end he closes his mouth and shakes the head.</p><p>Left alone, he turns to her, blinded by a black fury. \u201cIf you think I\u2019ll let you kill my sister-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my family,\u201d he growls.</p><p>She raises her chin and there is a quiet determination in her, a plea and a need, something that shakes him deeply when she says, \u201cI\u2019m your family too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u00a0did we get to this point? Do you force me to choose between Sansa\u2019s life and you?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys approaches and when she rests her hands on the sides of his face, he feels the strangest of sensations. They are familiar hands, whose touch he should recognize. It isn\u2019t so. \u201cI ask you to choose between the future and the past.\u201d</p><p>He feels drained, as if he had been deprived of something. He doesn\u2019t even know what it is. Only that it is of fundamental importance. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. You can\u2019t choose between the two. There\u2019s no future without a past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re choosing her.\u201d</p><p>He grabs her wrists and sighs, before gently turning away from her. \u201cThere are other ways to take the city. Safer ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlower,\u201d she replies, frowning.</p><p>Jon can\u2019t tell her it\u2019s not true. \u201cRighteous.\u201d</p><p>He has one foot out of the tent when her voice reaches him. \u201cDo you think she will be treated with respect? All say the opposite. Even if you could save her, think of the state in which you will find her.\u201d</p><p>He squints his eyes painfully. After a moment he leaves.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cWe can save her, little crow. Your sister is Ladyluck after all.\u201d</p><p>He looks optimistic, but it\u2019s a farce.</p><p><i>LadyLuck</i>. He doesn\u2019t remember the moment when Tormund started calling Sansa that way. He would like to remember.</p><p>Kissed by fire, he thinks. But that didn\u2019t save Ygritte.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to\u00a0throw up, just do it now.\u201d</p><p>Jon keeps staring at the fire. \u201cEverything I did, I did it for them,\u201d he mutters. <i>For her</i>. \u201cI said goodbye to my home, to my family to protect them and now-\u201d now she will never know why he did it. She will always think that he has turned his back to the North, to her.</p><p>\u201cHow could this happen?\u201d Where was everybody when it happened? </p><p>Here they are again. Disappointment, frustration, disgust,\u00a0outrage. He wants to smash everything to smithereens. He clenches his jaw and throw a log of wood into the fire. There is a high flame before the wood begins to crackle and burn.</p><p>\u201cThe she-wolf was gone a day after you. I thought I would find her here. The giant woman has disappeared so they must have taken her too.\u201d</p><p>Therefore Sansa isn\u2019t alone.</p><p>There is still something that is consuming a corner of his mind. \u201cTormund. You said that Ghost reached you. Wasn\u2019t he with you?\u201d</p><p>He scratches at his beard. \u201cHe never left the castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a way with words.\u201d Tormund shrugs and grins smugly. \u201cAll she had to do was to shed a few tears from her pretty blue eyes for the damn beast to run into her open arms.\u201d</p><p>Jon frowns. Why Sansa should care-</p><p>Tormund knows him well enough to understand what he is thinking. \u201cAre you fucking kidding? The girl loves your beast. When you were stuck in the South they were butt buddies. Didn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>Something seems to compress in his chest. \u201cI asked him to protect her in my place. I had forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgot enough, didn\u2019t you? Do you remember who you are?\u201d</p><p>Yes, he thinks and it has never been more true.</p>",

This the first part of two.)</p><p>*</p><p><i>It\u2019s a sunny day despite the freezing air. It isn\u2019t snowing. The breath condenses in front of him, a sign that despite everything, he is continuing to breathe. He feels his lungs on fire, as if he\u2019s underwater</i>.</p><p><i>The walls are high and thick, with wooden posts built upon the battlements, on which tens of scorpion bolts are placed</i>.</p><p><i>Cersei Lannister is on one of these. She has a smile that drives him to leave the ranks of soldiers and advance towards the closed doors of the city under siege.</i></p><p><i>It spreads\u00a0fear\u00a0and threat of terror. A chilling dread.</i></p><p><i>His worst fear materializes in the glimpse of red hair behind her. He wants to scream. Instead he remains paralyzed with horror, the only noise being the pulsing buzz of blood in his ears. It\u2019s like Rickon, only a thousand times more devastating</i>.</p><p><i>Jon watches her approaching Sansa, slow and predatory, sharp and calculating. He watches how Cersei caresses her cheek with her nails, then grabs her chin and whispers something into her ear</i>.</p><p><i>Sansa\u2019s face remains expressionless, but her eyes tell another story, betray what she really feels</i>. Gods.</p><p><i>Sansa takes a step forward and from the way she moves no one would guess she is about to die. She will not beg nor she will run away. She has no chains or handcuffs</i>.</p><p><i>Her eyes are incredibly blue, her hair a flaming mass. When she speaks, her voice sounds stentorian across the clearing</i>.</p><p><i>\u201cI will die like my father. I have no regrets except one.\u201d Her gaze finds his, liquid and sad and fierce at the same time. A ferrous taste invades his mouth. He has bitten his lip. \u201cThe north remembers.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The sword swings, the head falls, the body with it. The last spark caught by the sun of copper hair, streams of warm blood, the terrible sound of the thud</i>.</p><p><i>He screams at\u00a0the top of his lungs. And through him so the direwolf and the dragon and</i> -</p><p>He sits up with a start. He\u2019s in his tent. It\u2019s still night. He rubs a hand over his face. He is soaked in cold sweat.</p><p>It was just a dream. A nightmare.</p><p>Sansa is safe, in Winterfell. He made sure for it to happen.</p><p>He closes his eyes and shreds of images run through his mind. No matter how hard he tries, he can\u2019t delete them from memory. Deep roots like those of a heart tree are wedged inside him.</p><p>After that night, it becomes a recurring dream. See her die, night after night, again and again.</p><p>Despite his attempts, every time something inside him seems to break and the craving for home becomes agonizing.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cThey had to be full of water and instead were empty! How is that possible?\u201d</p><p>Of all those present, no one speaks. Tyrion stirs by the queen\u2019s side and Varys remains inscrutable. Davos exchanges a look with Gendry and takes a step forward.</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, my lord, Gendry and I were in charge of filling them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can both confirm that they were full when we delivered them to Gray Worm.\u201d</p><p>Jon closes his eyes. His hands are locked around the table on which the map of King\u2019s Landing is deployed. His knuckles turn white. When he stares at Gray Worm, he in his usual position, next to Daenerys, with his arms crossed behind his back.</p><p>\u201cYou ordered them to be emptied,\u201d he accuses him, but his voice sounds more tired than really angry. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Gray Worm doesn\u2019t so much as look at him. When he speaks, he turns and looks at the queen, as if the presence and opinion of others are of no relevance to him. \u201cThat woman is like the Masters and we will treat her the same way.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys doesn\u2019t respond, but her face shows the same hardness that she hasn\u2019t lost since Missandei\u2019s death. She puts her hand on his elbow.</p><p>Jon thinks about Mance Rayder. Burnt alive is something he wouldn\u2019t wish to anyone, not even to his worst enemy.</p><p>The plan was to burn a small portion of the Flea Bottom, a displaced area and according to reliable sources now uninhabited, and at the same time to launch with catapults barrels of water to extinguish the flames. A play to show the devastating power of a dragon, the threat behind the warning, and have mercy, give a clear message that they are not the true enemy, but that they could become one.</p><p>To do something, quieting the desire for bloodbath of the Unsellied.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the women and children who could have died?\u201d</p><p>Gray Worm doesn\u2019t blink. \u201cThere are always casualties in war.\u201d Everyone knows that he is referring to Missandei. </p><p>Out of the corner of his eye he sees Tyrion flinch under Daenerys\u2019 glare.</p><p>\u201cYou knew it?\u201d He brutally asks her.</p><p>Daenerys\u2019s eyes catalyses on him, losing some of her coolness. She hesitates, as if evaluating the options. \u201cNo,\u201d she says.</p><p>Jon nods, trying to mask the relief he is feeling.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s insubordination,\u201d he says gravely. From the way she is staring at him, Jon senses that she has already figured out what this means.</p><p>\u201cI respected you as commander, but what you did today was unforgivable. We can\u2019t fight a war if we don\u2019t trust each other.\u201d</p><p>When they are alone, Daenerys\u2019 fury is incandescent. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d There is a ferocity in her eyes, the look of a bear mother to which were killed all her cubs, one after the other. \u201cGray Worm is my commander, a trusted man of the queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe disobeyed an order! What example would we give to the other commanders if he remains unpunished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not punish him just because he sought justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t justice! It was revenge! If we start acting this way, what makes us better than Cersei Lannister?\u201d</p><p>He knows he has convinced her when he sees her shrink under the weight of that umpteenth loss.</p><p>He would like to comfort her, but as a coward he turns his back and leaves.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cMy queen, we were willing to follow you and serve you to the ends of the world.\u201d Gray Worm is kneeling in front of Daenerys, like a loyal, faithful subject. \u201cWe did it. I can reach her now. Will you bury us in Naath?\u201d</p><p>The queen\u2019s eyes are shiny and she is pale as the moon while she nods and promises to fulfill his last wish.</p><p>After Gray Worm dies, Daenerys remains, staring at his lifeless body.</p><p>When Jon approaches, she turns around. Her braids are ruffled by the wind and the hardness has reached her eyes. He immediately realizes that he has lost her fully.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t force a dragon to behave like a sheep,\u201d she murmurs and her fury is blinding, mixed with grief. \u201cAt dawn I will set the city on fire.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Jon enters the queen\u2019s tent last. It seems to him that only a few moments have passed since Gray Worm\u2019s execution. He tried to talk to Daenerys, but she took off with Drogon. He spent the last few hours among the ranks of soldiers, organizing water supplies with Davos.</p><p>When he enters, silence falls like a sword. Every gaze is fixed on him, every word truncated while it was spoken, each head turns and between them stands out one of a bright red.</p><p>Jon blinks and thinks it\u2019s a hallucination, an illusion due to the lack of light in the tent lit by candles. But the head remains red and the face is just that of -</p><p>\u201cTormund? Why are you here? I thought-\u201d <i>That we would never see each other again.</i></p><p>Tormund embraces him, a proud and bone-breaking hug. When he lets go, giving him one last pat on the shoulder, Jon notices his grim expression. The smile dies on his lips.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let anyone else tell you.\u201d His hand remains firm on his shoulder. Something cold and slimy grabs him by the scruff. \u201cWe were one day walking towards the North when your beast reached me. He was covered in blood. I went back immediately, but it was too late.\u201d</p><p>His mind is a whirlwind of alternatives. Winterfell burned to the ground. Sansa, Arya and Bran killed -</p><p>\u201cThey took her, boy. Those fucking bastards took your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich of the two?\u201d Someone asks.</p><p>He and Tormund snap their heads to their right.</p><p>Tyrion raises his hands, as conciliator as usual. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate question,\u201d he defends himself. \u201cJon has two sisters, Lady Sansa and Lady Arya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Tormund replies in a grunt. His grumpy voice seems to come from far away. \u201cShe\u2019s the one they took.\u201d</p><p>Sansa. They took Sansa.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What do they hope to achieve?\u201d asks Davos.</p><p>\u201cAn interesting question mainly because it provides multiple answers,\u201d intervenes Varys. \u201cThey could use her as a hostage. Or simply exploit her name. Let\u2019s not forget that she remains the key to the North.\u201d</p><p>Sansa has been kidnapped. At this very moment she could be at the mercy of Cersei Lannister. Suddenly his stomach is twisted and his vision blurred.</p><p>\u201cJon-\u201d begins Davos.</p><p>\u201cHe is a bastard,\u201d Varys interrupts him without half measures, \u201cand unless the queen doesn\u2019t legitimize him as she did with the bastard of Robert Baratheon, the only legitimate heir that can continue the lineage are her and Lady Arya.\u201d</p><p>Jon forces himself not to think about Sansa, the thousand ways she could be tortured. Her wounded and swollen skin, her piercing screams of pain.</p><p>There is a sudden silence, full of tension. He has recently started breathing again normally when he meets Daenerys\u2019 gaze. It contain pity, but also something that he cannot define, as if a light illuminates it from within. \u201cFamily names are handed down from father to son,\u201d Daenerys states. \u201cWe\u2019re not in Dorne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Varys contradicts. Daenerys finally looks away from him. \u201cThere have been cases, your grace, when no male heirs were available. Also in your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d Davos questions. \u201cObviously we cannot proceed as originally agreed, not now that we know that Lady Sansa is within the city.\u201d</p><p>He is obviously referring to the old plan, the one that provided for localized fires, for closing the access to the sea. To win the war by exhaustion.</p><p>Most of the men are waiting for his word, but he looks at Daenerys, at her lips curved downwards. He\u2019s shivering inside.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to change our strategy.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he is sure he has misunderstood. He must have hear wrong. He realizes\u00a0this isn\u2019t the case from Davos\u2019 obvious discomfort, Gendry\u2019s disbelief, Tormund\u2019s confusion and the exchange of glances between Tyrion and Varys.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d His voice sounds hoarse and harsh. It\u2019s the first time he speaks. Anger blooms in his chest like a flower of fire. Makes him almost feverish. He feels less powerless. \u201cIf Sansa is in there, is all the more reason not to set the whole city on fire.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys\u2019s face doesn\u2019t change expression. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss, but your sister is brave. I\u2019m sure -\u201d</p><p>He won\u2019t let her finish. He doesn\u2019t want to hear. \u201cOut.\u201d He doesn\u2019t scream, but the tone he used doesn\u2019t leave other possible interpretations. It is a mandatory, imperative order. \u201cAll of you. Leave us alone.\u201d</p><p>They do as he said and passing by Tyrion stops near him. He seems to want to tell him something, but in the end he closes his mouth and shakes the head.</p><p>Left alone, he turns to her, blinded by a black fury. \u201cIf you think I\u2019ll let you kill my sister-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my family,\u201d he growls.</p><p>She raises her chin and there is a quiet determination in her, a plea and a need, something that shakes him deeply when she says, \u201cI\u2019m your family too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u00a0did we get to this point? Do you force me to choose between Sansa\u2019s life and you?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys approaches and when she rests her hands on the sides of his face, he feels the strangest of sensations. They are familiar hands, whose touch he should recognize. It isn\u2019t so. \u201cI ask you to choose between the future and the past.\u201d</p><p>He feels drained, as if he had been deprived of something. He doesn\u2019t even know what it is. Only that it is of fundamental importance. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. You can\u2019t choose between the two. There\u2019s no future without a past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re choosing her.\u201d</p><p>He grabs her wrists and sighs, before gently turning away from her. \u201cThere are other ways to take the city. Safer ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlower,\u201d she replies, frowning.</p><p>Jon can\u2019t tell her it\u2019s not true. \u201cRighteous.\u201d</p><p>He has one foot out of the tent when her voice reaches him. \u201cDo you think she will be treated with respect? All say the opposite. Even if you could save her, think of the state in which you will find her.\u201d</p><p>He squints his eyes painfully. After a moment he leaves.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cWe can save her, little crow. Your sister is Ladyluck after all.\u201d</p><p>He looks optimistic, but it\u2019s a farce.</p><p><i>LadyLuck</i>. He doesn\u2019t remember the moment when Tormund started calling Sansa that way. He would like to remember.</p><p>Kissed by fire, he thinks. But that didn\u2019t save Ygritte.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to\u00a0throw up, just do it now.\u201d</p><p>Jon keeps staring at the fire. \u201cEverything I did, I did it for them,\u201d he mutters. <i>For her</i>. \u201cI said goodbye to my home, to my family to protect them and now-\u201d now she will never know why he did it.

                "content": "<p><b>The more it takes away (I of II)</b></p><p>(I wanted to finish it before tomorrow&rsquo;s episode. Inspired by old leaks about a possible Sansa&rsquo;s abduction. This the first part of two.)</p><p>*</p><p><i>It&rsquo;s a sunny day despite the freezing air. It isn&rsquo;t snowing. The breath condenses in front of him, a sign that despite everything, he is continuing to breathe. He feels his lungs on fire, as if he&rsquo;s underwater</i>.</p><p><i>The walls are high and thick, with wooden posts built upon the battlements, on which tens of scorpion bolts are placed</i>.</p><p><i>Cersei Lannister is on one of these. She has a smile that drives him to leave the ranks of soldiers and advance towards the closed doors of the city under siege.</i></p><p><i>It spreads&nbsp;fear&nbsp;and threat of terror. A chilling dread.</i></p><p><i>His worst fear materializes in the glimpse of red hair behind her. He wants to scream. Instead he remains paralyzed with horror, the only noise being the pulsing buzz of blood in his ears. It&rsquo;s like Rickon, only a thousand times more devastating</i>.</p><p><i>Jon watches her approaching Sansa, slow and predatory, sharp and calculating. He watches how Cersei caresses her cheek with her nails, then grabs her chin and whispers something into her ear</i>.</p><p><i>Sansa&rsquo;s face remains expressionless, but her eyes tell another story, betray what she really feels</i>. Gods.</p><p><i>Sansa takes a step forward and from the way she moves no one would guess she is about to die. She will not beg nor she will run away. She has no chains or handcuffs</i>.</p><p><i>Her eyes are incredibly blue, her hair a flaming mass. When she speaks, her voice sounds stentorian across the clearing</i>.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I will die like my father. I have no regrets except one.&rdquo; Her gaze finds his, liquid and sad and fierce at the same time. A ferrous taste invades his mouth. He has bitten his lip. &ldquo;The north remembers.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The sword swings, the head falls, the body with it. The last spark caught by the sun of copper hair, streams of warm blood, the terrible sound of the thud</i>.</p><p><i>He screams at&nbsp;the top of his lungs. And through him so the direwolf and the dragon and</i> -</p><p>He sits up with a start. He&rsquo;s in his tent. It&rsquo;s still night. He rubs a hand over his face. He is soaked in cold sweat.</p><p>It was just a dream. A nightmare.</p><p>Sansa is safe, in Winterfell. He made sure for it to happen.</p><p>He closes his eyes and shreds of images run through his mind. No matter how hard he tries, he can&rsquo;t delete them from memory. Deep roots like those of a heart tree are wedged inside him.</p><p>After that night, it becomes a recurring dream. See her die, night after night, again and again.</p><p>Despite his attempts, every time something inside him seems to break and the craving for home becomes agonizing.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;They had to be full of water and instead were empty! How is that possible?&rdquo;</p><p>Of all those present, no one speaks. Tyrion stirs by the queen&rsquo;s side and Varys remains inscrutable. Davos exchanges a look with Gendry and takes a step forward.</p><p>&ldquo;With all due respect, my lord, Gendry and I were in charge of filling them,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We can both confirm that they were full when we delivered them to Gray Worm.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon closes his eyes. His hands are locked around the table on which the map of King&rsquo;s Landing is deployed. His knuckles turn white. When he stares at Gray Worm, he in his usual position, next to Daenerys, with his arms crossed behind his back.</p><p>&ldquo;You ordered them to be emptied,&rdquo; he accuses him, but his voice sounds more tired than really angry. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>Gray Worm doesn&rsquo;t so much as look at him. When he speaks, he turns and looks at the queen, as if the presence and opinion of others are of no relevance to him. &ldquo;That woman is like the Masters and we will treat her the same way.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys doesn&rsquo;t respond, but her face shows the same hardness that she hasn&rsquo;t lost since Missandei&rsquo;s death. She puts her hand on his elbow.</p><p>Jon thinks about Mance Rayder. Burnt alive is something he wouldn&rsquo;t wish to anyone, not even to his worst enemy.</p><p>The plan was to burn a small portion of the Flea Bottom, a displaced area and according to reliable sources now uninhabited, and at the same time to launch with catapults barrels of water to extinguish the flames. A play to show the devastating power of a dragon, the threat behind the warning, and have mercy, give a clear message that they are not the true enemy, but that they could become one.</p><p>To do something, quieting the desire for bloodbath of the Unsellied.</p><p>&ldquo;What about the women and children who could have died?&rdquo;</p><p>Gray Worm doesn&rsquo;t blink. &ldquo;There are always casualties in war.&rdquo; Everyone knows that he is referring to Missandei. </p><p>Out of the corner of his eye he sees Tyrion flinch under Daenerys&rsquo; glare.</p><p>&ldquo;You knew it?&rdquo; He brutally asks her.</p><p>Daenerys&rsquo;s eyes catalyses on him, losing some of her coolness. She hesitates, as if evaluating the options. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Jon nods, trying to mask the relief he is feeling.</p><p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s insubordination,&rdquo; he says gravely. From the way she is staring at him, Jon senses that she has already figured out what this means.</p><p>&ldquo;I respected you as commander, but what you did today was unforgivable. We can&rsquo;t fight a war if we don&rsquo;t trust each other.&rdquo;</p><p>When they are alone, Daenerys&rsquo; fury is incandescent. &ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; There is a ferocity in her eyes, the look of a bear mother to which were killed all her cubs, one after the other. &ldquo;Gray Worm is my commander, a trusted man of the queen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He disobeyed an order! What example would we give to the other commanders if he remains unpunished?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will not punish him just because he sought justice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t justice! It was revenge! If we start acting this way, what makes us better than Cersei Lannister?&rdquo;</p><p>He knows he has convinced her when he sees her shrink under the weight of that umpteenth loss.</p><p>He would like to comfort her, but as a coward he turns his back and leaves.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;My queen, we were willing to follow you and serve you to the ends of the world.&rdquo; Gray Worm is kneeling in front of Daenerys, like a loyal, faithful subject. &ldquo;We did it. I can reach her now. Will you bury us in Naath?&rdquo;</p><p>The queen&rsquo;s eyes are shiny and she is pale as the moon while she nods and promises to fulfill his last wish.</p><p>After Gray Worm dies, Daenerys remains, staring at his lifeless body.</p><p>When Jon approaches, she turns around. Her braids are ruffled by the wind and the hardness has reached her eyes. He immediately realizes that he has lost her fully.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t force a dragon to behave like a sheep,&rdquo; she murmurs and her fury is blinding, mixed with grief. &ldquo;At dawn I will set the city on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Jon enters the queen&rsquo;s tent last. It seems to him that only a few moments have passed since Gray Worm&rsquo;s execution. He tried to talk to Daenerys, but she took off with Drogon. He spent the last few hours among the ranks of soldiers, organizing water supplies with Davos.</p><p>When he enters, silence falls like a sword. Every gaze is fixed on him, every word truncated while it was spoken, each head turns and between them stands out one of a bright red.</p><p>Jon blinks and thinks it&rsquo;s a hallucination, an illusion due to the lack of light in the tent lit by candles. But the head remains red and the face is just that of -</p><p>&ldquo;Tormund? Why are you here? I thought-&rdquo; <i>That we would never see each other again.</i></p><p>Tormund embraces him, a proud and bone-breaking hug. When he lets go, giving him one last pat on the shoulder, Jon notices his grim expression. The smile dies on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t let anyone else tell you.&rdquo; His hand remains firm on his shoulder. Something cold and slimy grabs him by the scruff. &ldquo;We were one day walking towards the North when your beast reached me. He was covered in blood. I went back immediately, but it was too late.&rdquo;</p><p>His mind is a whirlwind of alternatives. Winterfell burned to the ground. Sansa, Arya and Bran killed -</p><p>&ldquo;They took her, boy. Those fucking bastards took your sister.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which of the two?&rdquo; Someone asks.</p><p>He and Tormund snap their heads to their right.</p><p>Tyrion raises his hands, as conciliator as usual. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a legitimate question,&rdquo; he defends himself. &ldquo;Jon has two sisters, Lady Sansa and Lady Arya.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; Tormund replies in a grunt. His grumpy voice seems to come from far away. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the one they took.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa. They took Sansa.</p><p>&ldquo;Why? What do they hope to achieve?&rdquo; asks Davos.</p><p>&ldquo;An interesting question mainly because it provides multiple answers,&rdquo; intervenes Varys. &ldquo;They could use her as a hostage. Or simply exploit her name. Let&rsquo;s not forget that she remains the key to the North.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa has been kidnapped. At this very moment she could be at the mercy of Cersei Lannister. Suddenly his stomach is twisted and his vision blurred.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon-&rdquo; begins Davos.</p><p>&ldquo;He is a bastard,&rdquo; Varys interrupts him without half measures, &ldquo;and unless the queen doesn&rsquo;t legitimize him as she did with the bastard of Robert Baratheon, the only legitimate heir that can continue the lineage are her and Lady Arya.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon forces himself not to think about Sansa, the thousand ways she could be tortured. Her wounded and swollen skin, her piercing screams of pain.</p><p>There is a sudden silence, full of tension. He has recently started breathing again normally when he meets Daenerys&rsquo; gaze. It contain pity, but also something that he cannot define, as if a light illuminates it from within. &ldquo;Family names are handed down from father to son,&rdquo; Daenerys states. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not in Dorne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; Varys contradicts. Daenerys finally looks away from him. &ldquo;There have been cases, your grace, when no male heirs were available. Also in your family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo; Davos questions. &ldquo;Obviously we cannot proceed as originally agreed, not now that we know that Lady Sansa is within the city.&rdquo;</p><p>He is obviously referring to the old plan, the one that provided for localized fires, for closing the access to the sea. To win the war by exhaustion.</p><p>Most of the men are waiting for his word, but he looks at Daenerys, at her lips curved downwards. He&rsquo;s shivering inside.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to change our strategy.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment he is sure he has misunderstood. He must have hear wrong. He realizes&nbsp;this isn&rsquo;t the case from Davos&rsquo; obvious discomfort, Gendry&rsquo;s disbelief, Tormund&rsquo;s confusion and the exchange of glances between Tyrion and Varys.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; His voice sounds hoarse and harsh. It&rsquo;s the first time he speaks. Anger blooms in his chest like a flower of fire. Makes him almost feverish. He feels less powerless. &ldquo;If Sansa is in there, is all the more reason not to set the whole city on fire.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys&rsquo;s face doesn&rsquo;t change expression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for your loss, but your sister is brave. I&rsquo;m sure -&rdquo;</p><p>He won&rsquo;t let her finish. He doesn&rsquo;t want to hear. &ldquo;Out.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t scream, but the tone he used doesn&rsquo;t leave other possible interpretations. It is a mandatory, imperative order. &ldquo;All of you. Leave us alone.&rdquo;</p><p>They do as he said and passing by Tyrion stops near him. He seems to want to tell him something, but in the end he closes his mouth and shakes the head.</p><p>Left alone, he turns to her, blinded by a black fury. &ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;ll let you kill my sister-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not your sister.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my family,&rdquo; he growls.</p><p>She raises her chin and there is a quiet determination in her, a plea and a need, something that shakes him deeply when she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your family too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So&nbsp;did we get to this point? Do you force me to choose between Sansa&rsquo;s life and you?&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys approaches and when she rests her hands on the sides of his face, he feels the strangest of sensations. They are familiar hands, whose touch he should recognize. It isn&rsquo;t so. &ldquo;I ask you to choose between the future and the past.&rdquo;</p><p>He feels drained, as if he had been deprived of something. He doesn&rsquo;t even know what it is. Only that it is of fundamental importance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong. You can&rsquo;t choose between the two. There&rsquo;s no future without a past.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re choosing her.&rdquo;</p><p>He grabs her wrists and sighs, before gently turning away from her. &ldquo;There are other ways to take the city. Safer ways.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Slower,&rdquo; she replies, frowning.</p><p>Jon can&rsquo;t tell her it&rsquo;s not true. &ldquo;Righteous.&rdquo;</p><p>He has one foot out of the tent when her voice reaches him. &ldquo;Do you think she will be treated with respect? All say the opposite. Even if you could save her, think of the state in which you will find her.&rdquo;</p><p>He squints his eyes painfully. After a moment he leaves.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;We can save her, little crow. Your sister is Ladyluck after all.&rdquo;</p><p>He looks optimistic, but it&rsquo;s a farce.</p><p><i>LadyLuck</i>. He doesn&rsquo;t remember the moment when Tormund started calling Sansa that way. He would like to remember.</p><p>Kissed by fire, he thinks. But that didn&rsquo;t save Ygritte.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to&nbsp;throw up, just do it now.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon keeps staring at the fire. &ldquo;Everything I did, I did it for them,&rdquo; he mutters. <i>For her</i>. &ldquo;I said goodbye to my home, to my family to protect them and now-&rdquo; now she will never know why he did it. She will always think that he has turned his back to the North, to her.</p><p>&ldquo;How could this happen?&rdquo; Where was everybody when it happened? </p><p>Here they are again. Disappointment, frustration, disgust,&nbsp;outrage. He wants to smash everything to smithereens. He clenches his jaw and throw a log of wood into the fire.
