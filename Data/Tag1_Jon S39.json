I hope it\u2019s okay! Big hug)</p><p>She wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. And she\nknew it. Dozens of crows with their eyes fixed on her, probably the first woman\nto visit in moons now the wildlings had gone back to the North \u2013 the real\nNorth, as Tormund Giantsbane called it. It occurred to her briefly, as her\nboots avoided a small bud of something, that maybe the Watch wasn\u2019t needed\nanymore. The dead were gone forever. What did they watch over now, then?<br/></p><!-- more --><p>But without a Night\u2019s Watch what would many\nmen do with their lives? Or what would happen to criminals? Well, maybe that\nwas her brother\u2019s problem now, not hers. </p><p>She still had some power here, though. And\nshe intended to use it.</p><p>Many, many, many moons ago she had crossed\nthose gates, freezing and shaking with Lady Brienne by her side. Today the sun\nshone high in the sky, warming her cheeks, and she had ridden there with a few\nman behind her back.</p><p>He was no longer Lord Commander. He couldn\u2019t\nbe. Not after killing the queen. Not after committing treason.</p><p>But he hugged her with the same fierceness\nas he had that other time, a lifetime ago. And she buried her nose in his neck\njust the same way, her arms tight around his shoulders as he lifted her in the\nair and spun her around and mumbled her name in her ear.</p><p>She was queen now. She was the Queen in the\nNorth now, not some frightened little girl escaping her abusing husband.</p><p>And yet she hadn\u2019t felt much queenly when\nhe had run to her arms. And she didn\u2019t feel much queenly now, sitting by the\nfire with a mug of ale in her hands.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t improve a bit.\u201d She curled her\nlip, twirling the mug between her hands. \u201cYour hair is shorter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, the days are warmer now\u201d he said,\ntaking another sip from his drink. </p><p>\u201cIt suits you\u201d she mumbled, taking a large\ngulp. Maybe that would give her the courage.</p><p>He laughed, his hand curling around hers\nover her knee. She felt her cheeks warm, but the fire wasn\u2019t that close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I, hmm-\u201d Jon cleared his throat \u201cI like\nyour dress. Did you make it yourself?\u201d</p><p>She beamed at him before she could avoid\nit. </p><p>\u201cI did! Though it doesn\u2019t have any wolf\nbits, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d </p><p>Jon laughed, and so did she.</p><p>How could she have lived without him for so\nlong? The same day they had crowned her a raven from Castle Black had arrived,\ninforming her her cousin was leaving the Wall to escort the Free Folk back to\ntheir homes. How she hadn\u2019t gone mad with worry until another raven informed of\nhis safe return she didn\u2019t knew.</p><p>At least Arya had the decency to send a\nraven every moon\u2019s turn \u2013 still not enough, by Sansa\u2019s standards. Once she was\nback home Sansa would tell her a thing or two.</p><p>And Sansa\u2019s \u2018little birds\u2019 at King\u2019s\nLanding informed her of Bran\u2019s every step. Or sometimes Bran just warged into\nsomeone from her household and spoke with her himself. That was kind of frightening\nat first. It still was.</p><p>\u201cWell, I like the red leafs\u201d Jon jested, toying\nwith the long sleeves.</p><p>\u201cI wore it the day of the coronation\u201d she\nmumbled, her eyes on her feet.</p><p>Jon sighed, releasing the fabric.</p><p>\u201cIt might have been a great day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t. Not really\u201d Sansa almost scoffed,\nher heart sinking in her chest. \u201cNone of you were there. That\u2019s how she felt\nwhen they crowned her, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, and his jaw stiffened. </p><p>\u201cShe was never crowned. I killed her before\nanyone had the chance.\u201d</p><p>It was Sansa\u2019s turn to clutch his hand, and\ngive it a gentle squeeze.</p><p>He had done the right thing. He had done\nthe right thing and he had been punished and was still punishing himself for\nit. Jaime Lannister had done just the same and they had let him keep his\nposition for years, even under a different king. </p><p>But the world wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>\u201cI meant Cersei. But you did what needed to\nbe done, Jon. She would have murdered thousands, had she lived.\u201d She gulped,\nand so did he. \u201cShe would have killed you.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s eyes were finally on hers.</p><p>\u201cAnd then Arya would have killed her. So\nthe result would have been the same, you see?\u201d Sansa tried to lighten the mood.</p><p>He gave a short laugh, and his eyes were on\nhis lap once more. But his thumb was caressing the back of her hand, almost on\nits own accord. And she wouldn\u2019t release him either. But she had to tell him.\nMaybe he was happy with this life. Maybe he just wanted to spend the rest of\nhis years walking down the Wall and back and forth from the villages of the\nFree Folk and Castle Black, with Ghost by his side.</p><p>But she had to tell him.</p><p>Sansa straightened her shoulders, her mug\nlong forgotten at the table at her left.</p><p>\u201cThe northern lords don\u2019t accept the fate\nthey forced on you\u201d she finally spat out.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not really their business, is\nit?\u201d Jon scoffed, shrugging.</p><p>He release her hand to take another gulp\nfrom his ale. And she felt terribly empty.</p><p>Just as empty as when he rode south. Both\ntimes.</p><p>\u201cNor is it of those who passed your sentence,\nsince they\u2019re not here anymore, are they?\u201d Sansa growled, standing up so fast\nshe almost threw her chair back.</p><p>He stood up almost just as fast.</p><p>\u201cYou were one of those who said you had no\nchoice!\u201d Jon roared, waving his hand towards her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I hadn\u2019t!\u201d she shouted, crossing her\narms over her chest, trying to protect herself. \u201cNot back then, not with an\narmy of Unsullied and Dothraki threatening our family and our home.\u201d</p><p>He was panting, his fists closed tight at\nhis sides, his brow furrowed as he looked away from her.</p><p>She was panting too. </p><p>Why did he never listen to her?</p><p>\u201cSansa, I\u2019ve accepted my punishment. I\u2019m as\nhappy with it as I could be\u201d he muttered between gritted teeth, his jaw tense.</p><p>\u201cJon\u201d she tried, with a calmer tone.</p><p>He was still wheezing, looking at the\nstones under their feet.</p><p>She caught his wrist, forcing him to look\nat her. </p><p>\u201cJon, listen to me.\u201d He sighed again, his\neyes on her hand. \u201cJon, please.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes were on her. But there was a\nsadness there. Such a deep sadness.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t his place. This had never been.\nHe was ready to leave when she finally found him and asked him to fight for her\ncause. <i>Their</i> cause. And he had\nfought, and fought, and fought. The living, the dead. Ice and fire. And what for?\nWhat for, in the end?</p><p><i>What\nfor?</i></p><p>\u201cThe northern lords want you to come back.\nThey want the king they chose for the North to be in the North\u201d she told him,\nand his eyes were blown wide now. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>Jon did, as if he wasn\u2019t in control of his\nown body.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re their queen now. They chose you\u201d\nhe all but whined.</p><p>\u201cThey did and I am\u201d she agreed, nodding. \u201cBut\nthey can\u2019t wrap their heads around the fact that the men that saved their lives\n<i>twice</i> is wasting away at the Wall.\nAnd neither can I.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSansa, that cannot be. Bran passed the sentence-\u201c\n</p><p>\u201cBran isn\u2019t your king\u201d she cut.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s everyone\u2019s king now\u201d Jon said,\nwith a sarcastic smile.</p><p>She wanted to slap him.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she corrected, her hands nicely folded\nin her lap, her back straighter than ever. \u201cThe North didn\u2019t bend the knee to\nhim. You are a northerner, just as much as I am-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI was born at Dorne! Rhaegar Targaryen was\nmy father!\u201d Jon shouted.</p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes.</p><p>It was like he really wanted to be punished\nfor saving everyone\u2019s lives, after all.</p><p>Well, maybe he was just that daft. He had\nmade many mistakes. Maybe this was just another one.</p><p>Maybe he was just stupid. </p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t give up on him just now.</p><p>\u201cLyanna Stark birthed you. And you were raised\nat Winterfell, as a Stark, by Ned Stark. You were always a Stark in everything\nbut name. You once described yourself as a \u2018northern fool\u2019, as I can recall.\u201d</p><p>Jon closed his eyes, taking a long breath.</p><p>\u201cI know you never had a taste for politics,\nbut politics matter. And so do laws and all that stuff you always found boring\u201d\nshe tried to smile, her hand gently caressing his elbow. \u201cBut a \u2018northern fool\u2019\ndoesn\u2019t have to bend to a southern king\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>Still, he said nothing, his knuckles white\non the arms of his chair.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what Lyanna Mormont said\nthe day they made you king?\u201d she asked, and he opened his eyes again, though he\nwas making a point out of not looking at her. \u201cShe said that she knew no king\nbut the King in the North, whose name is Stark. She said the North remembers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p>Ah, there was hope there, now. Hope, in the\neyes who had rode to battle against Ramsay Bolton even though he knew he didn\u2019t\nhave enough man. He had saved her and she had saved him. It was time to do the\nsame again.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean that the North remembered.\nThe North remembered, and they know no king \u2013 or queen \u2013 for the matter, but\nthe Queen in the North. I\u2019m their queen now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. It\u2019s a bit obvious!\u201d he\nrumbled. But she had his attention.</p><p>She huffed. He was making this so much\nharder than it really needed to be.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s so obvious, as Queen in the\nNorth I have the power to release all of my subjects from all charges my people\nfind excessive.\u201d</p><p>Jon shook his head again.</p><p>But she had his ear.</p><p>Sansa caught both his hands, clutching them\ntightly to bring him back to earth.</p><p>\u201cTechnically you are my subject, Jon. Not\nBran\u2019s. So he can\u2019t pass this\u2026 this\u2026 life sentence on you. And doesn\u2019t have the\nauthority to do so.\u201d</p><p>His frown relaxed.</p><p>\u201cYour people want you home, Jon. They want\ntheir saviour to receive his just reward\u201d she told him, her voice calm now. He\nclutched her hands as well, as if he had finally decided to fight. \u201cI want you\nhome. I <i>need</i> you home. <i>Our</i> home.\u201d</p><p>Her voice failed her, and tears filled his\neyes.</p><p>\u201cOur home\u201d he repeated, and leaned forward\nto kiss her forehead, his hand on the back of her head.</p><p>Sansa shivered. But not from the cold.</p><p>He kept his warm lips against her skin for\nwhat felt like an eternity, and still not long enough, his breath ruffling the\nhairs on top of her head.</p><p>She swallowed thickly.</p><p>Jon pulled away instantly, clearing his\nthroat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Sansa\u201d he apologized,\nletting his hands fall back at his sides. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThey want me to marry\u201d she blurted out,\nand Jon shook his head sharply, his brow furrowed again. Sansa cupped his\ncheek, his beard caressing her palm, trying to sooth him. But she was feeling\nnervous too. \u201cThe North needs and heir, but- Please, Jon, I\u2026 Please, I need\nyou.\u201d</p><p>No, not nervous. She was terrified.\nTerrified that someone else was making decisions for her once more.</p><p>It was Jon\u2019s turn to straighten his back,\nhis hand around her wrist so he could kiss her knuckles. Sansa shivered again.</p><p>\u201cI promised I\u2019d protect you\u201d he said, his\nvoice low. \u201cAnd I shall keep my promise. I owe you that much. You won\u2019t have to\nmarry anyone.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her, but it was forced.</p><p>\u201cAnd it will be nice to be home again. It\nwas good being here, with no lords irking me up all the time\u201d he tried to joke,\nbut Sansa\u2019s heart was racing too much for her to laugh. \u201cBut I miss home.\u201d</p><p>Sansa took another long breath.</p><p>It was her only hope. It was her only hope\nand she needed to at least ask him. </p><p>It was madness. He would laugh of her. Or\nhe would rather stay here, and never speak to her ever again. </p><p>But she needed to try.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Jon\u201d she whispered, as if\nshe was afraid he might hear her. \u201cI\u2019ll have to marry, eventually. I won\u2019t\nleave the North unprotected once I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can chose a new king, just like the\nSix Kingdoms will after Bran\u2019s gone\u201d he assured her, brushing her hair from her\nshoulder and then soothing it. \u201cYou\u2019re still young, Sansa, you shouldn\u2019t worry\nabout it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the North doesn\u2019t work like that\u201d\nshe spat, realising too late he was indeed too thick to wrap his head around\nthat simple notion. Maybe his time away from the laws of men had made him\nforget how the world worked. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t not worry about it, Jon. They\u2019re my\npeople, and a queen has a duty to listen to her people. They want someone with\nthe Stark name ruling the North, and they shall have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then make your sister your heir,\nthen\u201d Jon suggested, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, Jon, I want force that responsibility\non her!\u201d she shook her head, and she could feel her eyes almost popping out of\nher face. No. No. She wouldn\u2019t do that. Arya didn\u2019t deserve such weight on her\nshoulders. \u201cEver. You know she doesn\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed, hiding his hands between his\nface, as if defeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d make heirs for you, if I could\u201d He\nwaved his hand around, the other still covering his eyes. \u201cMarry some lady they\nchose for me and you could name our children your heirs, if you wanted to. But\nI don\u2019t have the Stark name.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his shoulder, trying\nboth to get his attention and draw some strength for him.</p><p><i>I\u2019m\nthe blood of Winterfell. Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn\u2019s daughter. </i></p><p><i>As brave\nas Robb.</i></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t. But I do\u201d</p><p>The room fell silent.</p><p>Sansa could hear her heartbeat, loud in her\nears, almost as loud as her own breathing. She heard other voices too, distant.\nMaybe in the courtyard. Man shouting orders. Horses neighing. She heard the\nruffle of Jon\u2019s clothing as he slowly, so slowly, raised his face from his\nhand, and look at her as if she had said the sun rose in the west.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d</p><p>She stuttered with her own words. She had\npracticed the speech a thousand times in her head. And still it made no sense.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a clean solution, if you think about\nit\u201d she tried to use reason. Reason always calmed her nerves, while she\nfidgeted with the sleeves of her dress now. \u201cIt would tie you definitely to the\nNorth, and you\u2019d be home again. No one could ever send you away. Isn\u2019t that\nwhat you wish?\u201d</p><p>He turned his body towards her, and this\ntime there was a full smile on his face. One that wasn\u2019t forced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I do, Sansa. You know that\u2019s all I\u2019ve\never wanted\u201d he assured her. \u201cTo be home, with you. The three of you. I never\nwanted to leave, and you know that. I\u2019ve always fought for the North. That\u2019s\nall I\u2019ve ever wanted\u201d</p><p>He took a long breath.</p><p>\u201cBut Sansa, you\u2019d impose on yourself the\nsame fate you don\u2019t want for your sister\u201d Jon pointed out, and his smile was\nreplaced but by the thick wrinkles of his forehead \u201cYou\u2019d be stuck with someone\nyou don\u2019t love once more.\u201d</p><p>She looked at his hand on her lap.</p><p>It scorched her skin. It scorched her\nheart. </p><p><i>Stupid\ngirl, with stupid dreams.</i></p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he shrieked, taking his hand away as\nif it burned too.</p><p>Sansa gulped.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u201d she repeated, her voice\nsteadier. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be stuck. With someone I don\u2019t love, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa, I\u2019m not talking about that kind of\nlove. I mean, you know what producing an heir actually implies, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that kind of love,\neither.\u201d Sansa doubted he could have heard her.</p><p>Jon run his hand through his hair. </p><p>She should go, now. </p><p>She was asking too much of him, of course.</p><p>Stupid. Stupid girl.</p><p>She had learnt nothing.</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d he asked, and his gaze upon\nher was too much to bare. \u201cSince when, Sansa? Tell me, I deserve to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know. You were my brother, but\nthen again you were never really my brother.\u201d She felt her face burn now, her\nthroat dry. Sansa bit her lip, trying to find the strength to continue. And\nthen she couldn\u2019t help herself anymore \u201cAnd then you came back with\u2026 With her.\nAnd you were in love with her. You really were. And it hurt so much. So much,\nthat you would give our home to her, and follow her. And then you weren\u2019t my\nbrother anymore and I couldn\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>He kissed her, then.</p><p>Not on her forehead, as he seemed to\nprefer, but on her lips. A proper kiss, with a hand at the back of her head,\nthe other at her waist, pulling her to him, his lips moving gently against\nhers, making her gasp in surprise as she tangled her fingers in his hair, glad\nhe didn\u2019t have that small knot anymore.</p><p>That was what a proper kiss felt like,\nthen.</p><p>A sweet tingling, at the back of her head,\nand a warmth all over, with Jon\u2019s arms wrapped around hers, his hard chest\npressed against her, his strong heartbeat just as fast as hers.</p><p>And hope, a stupid hope, bloomed in her\nchest. That he might not love her, but he could learn. Or he might never really\nlove her, but he would be good to her. Maybe she would never have it all, but\nat least she would have this.</p><p>He laughed, when they parted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d she asked, stroking his\nbeard and licking her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I getting everything?\u201d he\nwhispered, running his fingers down her hair and making her shiver. \u201cWhat have\nI done to deserve to return home with the woman I\u2019ve loved for so long?\u201d</p><p>Sansa grinned at him, tears of joy filling\nher eyes as she threw herself in his arms once more, kissing his cheek, his\nnose, his jaw, his neck. Any part of him she could reach, as she cried, and\ncried, and cried, finally letting many unshed tears run down her cheeks when\ntheir lips met once more.</p><p>\u201cThen come home Jon. Come home with me\u201d she\npleaded.</p><p>He rested his forehead against hers,\nlicking his lips.</p><p>\u201cI will, Sansa. We\u2019ll go home\u201d he vowed. \u201cTogether.\u201d</p>",

What did they watch over now, then?<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>But without a Night\u2019s Watch what would many\nmen do with their lives? Or what would happen to criminals? Well, maybe that\nwas her brother\u2019s problem now, not hers. </p><p>She still had some power here, though. And\nshe intended to use it.</p><p>Many, many, many moons ago she had crossed\nthose gates, freezing and shaking with Lady Brienne by her side. Today the sun\nshone high in the sky, warming her cheeks, and she had ridden there with a few\nman behind her back.</p><p>He was no longer Lord Commander. He couldn\u2019t\nbe. Not after killing the queen. Not after committing treason.</p><p>But he hugged her with the same fierceness\nas he had that other time, a lifetime ago. And she buried her nose in his neck\njust the same way, her arms tight around his shoulders as he lifted her in the\nair and spun her around and mumbled her name in her ear.</p><p>She was queen now. She was the Queen in the\nNorth now, not some frightened little girl escaping her abusing husband.</p><p>And yet she hadn\u2019t felt much queenly when\nhe had run to her arms. And she didn\u2019t feel much queenly now, sitting by the\nfire with a mug of ale in her hands.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t improve a bit.\u201d She curled her\nlip, twirling the mug between her hands. \u201cYour hair is shorter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, the days are warmer now\u201d he said,\ntaking another sip from his drink. </p><p>\u201cIt suits you\u201d she mumbled, taking a large\ngulp. Maybe that would give her the courage.</p><p>He laughed, his hand curling around hers\nover her knee. She felt her cheeks warm, but the fire wasn\u2019t that close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I, hmm-\u201d Jon cleared his throat \u201cI like\nyour dress. Did you make it yourself?\u201d</p><p>She beamed at him before she could avoid\nit. </p><p>\u201cI did! Though it doesn\u2019t have any wolf\nbits, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d </p><p>Jon laughed, and so did she.</p><p>How could she have lived without him for so\nlong? The same day they had crowned her a raven from Castle Black had arrived,\ninforming her her cousin was leaving the Wall to escort the Free Folk back to\ntheir homes. How she hadn\u2019t gone mad with worry until another raven informed of\nhis safe return she didn\u2019t knew.</p><p>At least Arya had the decency to send a\nraven every moon\u2019s turn \u2013 still not enough, by Sansa\u2019s standards. Once she was\nback home Sansa would tell her a thing or two.</p><p>And Sansa\u2019s \u2018little birds\u2019 at King\u2019s\nLanding informed her of Bran\u2019s every step. Or sometimes Bran just warged into\nsomeone from her household and spoke with her himself. That was kind of frightening\nat first. It still was.</p><p>\u201cWell, I like the red leafs\u201d Jon jested, toying\nwith the long sleeves.</p><p>\u201cI wore it the day of the coronation\u201d she\nmumbled, her eyes on her feet.</p><p>Jon sighed, releasing the fabric.</p><p>\u201cIt might have been a great day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t. Not really\u201d Sansa almost scoffed,\nher heart sinking in her chest. \u201cNone of you were there. That\u2019s how she felt\nwhen they crowned her, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, and his jaw stiffened. </p><p>\u201cShe was never crowned. I killed her before\nanyone had the chance.\u201d</p><p>It was Sansa\u2019s turn to clutch his hand, and\ngive it a gentle squeeze.</p><p>He had done the right thing. He had done\nthe right thing and he had been punished and was still punishing himself for\nit. Jaime Lannister had done just the same and they had let him keep his\nposition for years, even under a different king. </p><p>But the world wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>\u201cI meant Cersei. But you did what needed to\nbe done, Jon. She would have murdered thousands, had she lived.\u201d She gulped,\nand so did he. \u201cShe would have killed you.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s eyes were finally on hers.</p><p>\u201cAnd then Arya would have killed her. So\nthe result would have been the same, you see?\u201d Sansa tried to lighten the mood.</p><p>He gave a short laugh, and his eyes were on\nhis lap once more. But his thumb was caressing the back of her hand, almost on\nits own accord. And she wouldn\u2019t release him either. But she had to tell him.\nMaybe he was happy with this life. Maybe he just wanted to spend the rest of\nhis years walking down the Wall and back and forth from the villages of the\nFree Folk and Castle Black, with Ghost by his side.</p><p>But she had to tell him.</p><p>Sansa straightened her shoulders, her mug\nlong forgotten at the table at her left.</p><p>\u201cThe northern lords don\u2019t accept the fate\nthey forced on you\u201d she finally spat out.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not really their business, is\nit?\u201d Jon scoffed, shrugging.</p><p>He release her hand to take another gulp\nfrom his ale. And she felt terribly empty.</p><p>Just as empty as when he rode south. Both\ntimes.</p><p>\u201cNor is it of those who passed your sentence,\nsince they\u2019re not here anymore, are they?\u201d Sansa growled, standing up so fast\nshe almost threw her chair back.</p><p>He stood up almost just as fast.</p><p>\u201cYou were one of those who said you had no\nchoice!\u201d Jon roared, waving his hand towards her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I hadn\u2019t!\u201d she shouted, crossing her\narms over her chest, trying to protect herself. \u201cNot back then, not with an\narmy of Unsullied and Dothraki threatening our family and our home.\u201d</p><p>He was panting, his fists closed tight at\nhis sides, his brow furrowed as he looked away from her.</p><p>She was panting too. </p><p>Why did he never listen to her?</p><p>\u201cSansa, I\u2019ve accepted my punishment. I\u2019m as\nhappy with it as I could be\u201d he muttered between gritted teeth, his jaw tense.</p><p>\u201cJon\u201d she tried, with a calmer tone.</p><p>He was still wheezing, looking at the\nstones under their feet.</p><p>She caught his wrist, forcing him to look\nat her. </p><p>\u201cJon, listen to me.\u201d He sighed again, his\neyes on her hand. \u201cJon, please.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes were on her. But there was a\nsadness there. Such a deep sadness.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t his place. This had never been.\nHe was ready to leave when she finally found him and asked him to fight for her\ncause. <i>Their</i> cause. And he had\nfought, and fought, and fought. The living, the dead. Ice and fire. And what for?\nWhat for, in the end?</p><p><i>What\nfor?</i></p><p>\u201cThe northern lords want you to come back.\nThey want the king they chose for the North to be in the North\u201d she told him,\nand his eyes were blown wide now. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>Jon did, as if he wasn\u2019t in control of his\nown body.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re their queen now. They chose you\u201d\nhe all but whined.</p><p>\u201cThey did and I am\u201d she agreed, nodding. \u201cBut\nthey can\u2019t wrap their heads around the fact that the men that saved their lives\n<i>twice</i> is wasting away at the Wall.\nAnd neither can I.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSansa, that cannot be. Bran passed the sentence-\u201c\n</p><p>\u201cBran isn\u2019t your king\u201d she cut.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s everyone\u2019s king now\u201d Jon said,\nwith a sarcastic smile.</p><p>She wanted to slap him.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she corrected, her hands nicely folded\nin her lap, her back straighter than ever. \u201cThe North didn\u2019t bend the knee to\nhim. You are a northerner, just as much as I am-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI was born at Dorne! Rhaegar Targaryen was\nmy father!\u201d Jon shouted.</p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes.</p><p>It was like he really wanted to be punished\nfor saving everyone\u2019s lives, after all.</p><p>Well, maybe he was just that daft. He had\nmade many mistakes. Maybe this was just another one.</p><p>Maybe he was just stupid. </p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t give up on him just now.</p><p>\u201cLyanna Stark birthed you. And you were raised\nat Winterfell, as a Stark, by Ned Stark. You were always a Stark in everything\nbut name. You once described yourself as a \u2018northern fool\u2019, as I can recall.\u201d</p><p>Jon closed his eyes, taking a long breath.</p><p>\u201cI know you never had a taste for politics,\nbut politics matter. And so do laws and all that stuff you always found boring\u201d\nshe tried to smile, her hand gently caressing his elbow. \u201cBut a \u2018northern fool\u2019\ndoesn\u2019t have to bend to a southern king\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>Still, he said nothing, his knuckles white\non the arms of his chair.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what Lyanna Mormont said\nthe day they made you king?\u201d she asked, and he opened his eyes again, though he\nwas making a point out of not looking at her. \u201cShe said that she knew no king\nbut the King in the North, whose name is Stark. She said the North remembers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p>Ah, there was hope there, now. Hope, in the\neyes who had rode to battle against Ramsay Bolton even though he knew he didn\u2019t\nhave enough man. He had saved her and she had saved him. It was time to do the\nsame again.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean that the North remembered.\nThe North remembered, and they know no king \u2013 or queen \u2013 for the matter, but\nthe Queen in the North. I\u2019m their queen now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. It\u2019s a bit obvious!\u201d he\nrumbled. But she had his attention.</p><p>She huffed. He was making this so much\nharder than it really needed to be.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s so obvious, as Queen in the\nNorth I have the power to release all of my subjects from all charges my people\nfind excessive.\u201d</p><p>Jon shook his head again.</p><p>But she had his ear.</p><p>Sansa caught both his hands, clutching them\ntightly to bring him back to earth.</p><p>\u201cTechnically you are my subject, Jon. Not\nBran\u2019s. So he can\u2019t pass this\u2026 this\u2026 life sentence on you. And doesn\u2019t have the\nauthority to do so.\u201d</p><p>His frown relaxed.</p><p>\u201cYour people want you home, Jon. They want\ntheir saviour to receive his just reward\u201d she told him, her voice calm now. He\nclutched her hands as well, as if he had finally decided to fight. \u201cI want you\nhome. I <i>need</i> you home. <i>Our</i> home.\u201d</p><p>Her voice failed her, and tears filled his\neyes.</p><p>\u201cOur home\u201d he repeated, and leaned forward\nto kiss her forehead, his hand on the back of her head.</p><p>Sansa shivered. But not from the cold.</p><p>He kept his warm lips against her skin for\nwhat felt like an eternity, and still not long enough, his breath ruffling the\nhairs on top of her head.</p><p>She swallowed thickly.</p><p>Jon pulled away instantly, clearing his\nthroat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Sansa\u201d he apologized,\nletting his hands fall back at his sides. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThey want me to marry\u201d she blurted out,\nand Jon shook his head sharply, his brow furrowed again. Sansa cupped his\ncheek, his beard caressing her palm, trying to sooth him. But she was feeling\nnervous too. \u201cThe North needs and heir, but- Please, Jon, I\u2026 Please, I need\nyou.\u201d</p><p>No, not nervous. She was terrified.\nTerrified that someone else was making decisions for her once more.</p><p>It was Jon\u2019s turn to straighten his back,\nhis hand around her wrist so he could kiss her knuckles. Sansa shivered again.</p><p>\u201cI promised I\u2019d protect you\u201d he said, his\nvoice low. \u201cAnd I shall keep my promise. I owe you that much. You won\u2019t have to\nmarry anyone.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her, but it was forced.</p><p>\u201cAnd it will be nice to be home again. It\nwas good being here, with no lords irking me up all the time\u201d he tried to joke,\nbut Sansa\u2019s heart was racing too much for her to laugh. \u201cBut I miss home.\u201d</p><p>Sansa took another long breath.</p><p>It was her only hope. It was her only hope\nand she needed to at least ask him. </p><p>It was madness. He would laugh of her. Or\nhe would rather stay here, and never speak to her ever again. </p><p>But she needed to try.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Jon\u201d she whispered, as if\nshe was afraid he might hear her. \u201cI\u2019ll have to marry, eventually. I won\u2019t\nleave the North unprotected once I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can chose a new king, just like the\nSix Kingdoms will after Bran\u2019s gone\u201d he assured her, brushing her hair from her\nshoulder and then soothing it. \u201cYou\u2019re still young, Sansa, you shouldn\u2019t worry\nabout it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the North doesn\u2019t work like that\u201d\nshe spat, realising too late he was indeed too thick to wrap his head around\nthat simple notion. Maybe his time away from the laws of men had made him\nforget how the world worked. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t not worry about it, Jon. They\u2019re my\npeople, and a queen has a duty to listen to her people. They want someone with\nthe Stark name ruling the North, and they shall have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then make your sister your heir,\nthen\u201d Jon suggested, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, Jon, I want force that responsibility\non her!\u201d she shook her head, and she could feel her eyes almost popping out of\nher face. No. No. She wouldn\u2019t do that. Arya didn\u2019t deserve such weight on her\nshoulders. \u201cEver. You know she doesn\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed, hiding his hands between his\nface, as if defeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d make heirs for you, if I could\u201d He\nwaved his hand around, the other still covering his eyes. \u201cMarry some lady they\nchose for me and you could name our children your heirs, if you wanted to. But\nI don\u2019t have the Stark name.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his shoulder, trying\nboth to get his attention and draw some strength for him.</p><p><i>I\u2019m\nthe blood of Winterfell. Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn\u2019s daughter. </i></p><p><i>As brave\nas Robb.</i></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t. But I do\u201d</p><p>The room fell silent.</p><p>Sansa could hear her heartbeat, loud in her\nears, almost as loud as her own breathing. She heard other voices too, distant.\nMaybe in the courtyard. Man shouting orders. Horses neighing. She heard the\nruffle of Jon\u2019s clothing as he slowly, so slowly, raised his face from his\nhand, and look at her as if she had said the sun rose in the west.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d</p><p>She stuttered with her own words. She had\npracticed the speech a thousand times in her head. And still it made no sense.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a clean solution, if you think about\nit\u201d she tried to use reason. Reason always calmed her nerves, while she\nfidgeted with the sleeves of her dress now. \u201cIt would tie you definitely to the\nNorth, and you\u2019d be home again. No one could ever send you away. Isn\u2019t that\nwhat you wish?\u201d</p><p>He turned his body towards her, and this\ntime there was a full smile on his face. One that wasn\u2019t forced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I do, Sansa. You know that\u2019s all I\u2019ve\never wanted\u201d he assured her. \u201cTo be home, with you. The three of you. I never\nwanted to leave, and you know that. I\u2019ve always fought for the North. That\u2019s\nall I\u2019ve ever wanted\u201d</p><p>He took a long breath.</p><p>\u201cBut Sansa, you\u2019d impose on yourself the\nsame fate you don\u2019t want for your sister\u201d Jon pointed out, and his smile was\nreplaced but by the thick wrinkles of his forehead \u201cYou\u2019d be stuck with someone\nyou don\u2019t love once more.\u201d</p><p>She looked at his hand on her lap.</p><p>It scorched her skin. It scorched her\nheart. </p><p><i>Stupid\ngirl, with stupid dreams.</i></p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he shrieked, taking his hand away as\nif it burned too.</p><p>Sansa gulped.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u201d she repeated, her voice\nsteadier. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be stuck. With someone I don\u2019t love, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa, I\u2019m not talking about that kind of\nlove. I mean, you know what producing an heir actually implies, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that kind of love,\neither.\u201d Sansa doubted he could have heard her.</p><p>Jon run his hand through his hair. </p><p>She should go, now. </p><p>She was asking too much of him, of course.</p><p>Stupid. Stupid girl.</p><p>She had learnt nothing.</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d he asked, and his gaze upon\nher was too much to bare. \u201cSince when, Sansa? Tell me, I deserve to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know. You were my brother, but\nthen again you were never really my brother.\u201d She felt her face burn now, her\nthroat dry. Sansa bit her lip, trying to find the strength to continue. And\nthen she couldn\u2019t help herself anymore \u201cAnd then you came back with\u2026 With her.\nAnd you were in love with her. You really were. And it hurt so much. So much,\nthat you would give our home to her, and follow her. And then you weren\u2019t my\nbrother anymore and I couldn\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>He kissed her, then.</p><p>Not on her forehead, as he seemed to\nprefer, but on her lips. A proper kiss, with a hand at the back of her head,\nthe other at her waist, pulling her to him, his lips moving gently against\nhers, making her gasp in surprise as she tangled her fingers in his hair, glad\nhe didn\u2019t have that small knot anymore.</p><p>That was what a proper kiss felt like,\nthen.</p><p>A sweet tingling, at the back of her head,\nand a warmth all over, with Jon\u2019s arms wrapped around hers, his hard chest\npressed against her, his strong heartbeat just as fast as hers.</p><p>And hope, a stupid hope, bloomed in her\nchest. That he might not love her, but he could learn. Or he might never really\nlove her, but he would be good to her. Maybe she would never have it all, but\nat least she would have this.</p><p>He laughed, when they parted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d she asked, stroking his\nbeard and licking her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I getting everything?\u201d he\nwhispered, running his fingers down her hair and making her shiver. \u201cWhat have\nI done to deserve to return home with the woman I\u2019ve loved for so long?\u201d</p><p>Sansa grinned at him, tears of joy filling\nher eyes as she threw herself in his arms once more, kissing his cheek, his\nnose, his jaw, his neck. Any part of him she could reach, as she cried, and\ncried, and cried, finally letting many unshed tears run down her cheeks when\ntheir lips met once more.</p><p>\u201cThen come home Jon. Come home with me\u201d she\npleaded.</p><p>He rested his forehead against hers,\nlicking his lips.</p><p>\u201cI will, Sansa. We\u2019ll go home\u201d he vowed. \u201cTogether.\u201d</p>",

I hope it\u2019s okay! Big hug)</p><p>She wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. And she\nknew it. Dozens of crows with their eyes fixed on her, probably the first woman\nto visit in moons now the wildlings had gone back to the North \u2013 the real\nNorth, as Tormund Giantsbane called it. It occurred to her briefly, as her\nboots avoided a small bud of something, that maybe the Watch wasn\u2019t needed\nanymore. The dead were gone forever. What did they watch over now, then?<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>But without a Night\u2019s Watch what would many\nmen do with their lives? Or what would happen to criminals? Well, maybe that\nwas her brother\u2019s problem now, not hers. </p><p>She still had some power here, though. And\nshe intended to use it.</p><p>Many, many, many moons ago she had crossed\nthose gates, freezing and shaking with Lady Brienne by her side. Today the sun\nshone high in the sky, warming her cheeks, and she had ridden there with a few\nman behind her back.</p><p>He was no longer Lord Commander. He couldn\u2019t\nbe. Not after killing the queen. Not after committing treason.</p><p>But he hugged her with the same fierceness\nas he had that other time, a lifetime ago. And she buried her nose in his neck\njust the same way, her arms tight around his shoulders as he lifted her in the\nair and spun her around and mumbled her name in her ear.</p><p>She was queen now. She was the Queen in the\nNorth now, not some frightened little girl escaping her abusing husband.</p><p>And yet she hadn\u2019t felt much queenly when\nhe had run to her arms. And she didn\u2019t feel much queenly now, sitting by the\nfire with a mug of ale in her hands.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t improve a bit.\u201d She curled her\nlip, twirling the mug between her hands. \u201cYour hair is shorter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, the days are warmer now\u201d he said,\ntaking another sip from his drink. </p><p>\u201cIt suits you\u201d she mumbled, taking a large\ngulp. Maybe that would give her the courage.</p><p>He laughed, his hand curling around hers\nover her knee. She felt her cheeks warm, but the fire wasn\u2019t that close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I, hmm-\u201d Jon cleared his throat \u201cI like\nyour dress. Did you make it yourself?\u201d</p><p>She beamed at him before she could avoid\nit. </p><p>\u201cI did! Though it doesn\u2019t have any wolf\nbits, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d </p><p>Jon laughed, and so did she.</p><p>How could she have lived without him for so\nlong? The same day they had crowned her a raven from Castle Black had arrived,\ninforming her her cousin was leaving the Wall to escort the Free Folk back to\ntheir homes. How she hadn\u2019t gone mad with worry until another raven informed of\nhis safe return she didn\u2019t knew.</p><p>At least Arya had the decency to send a\nraven every moon\u2019s turn \u2013 still not enough, by Sansa\u2019s standards. Once she was\nback home Sansa would tell her a thing or two.</p><p>And Sansa\u2019s \u2018little birds\u2019 at King\u2019s\nLanding informed her of Bran\u2019s every step. Or sometimes Bran just warged into\nsomeone from her household and spoke with her himself. That was kind of frightening\nat first. It still was.</p><p>\u201cWell, I like the red leafs\u201d Jon jested, toying\nwith the long sleeves.</p><p>\u201cI wore it the day of the coronation\u201d she\nmumbled, her eyes on her feet.</p><p>Jon sighed, releasing the fabric.</p><p>\u201cIt might have been a great day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t. Not really\u201d Sansa almost scoffed,\nher heart sinking in her chest. \u201cNone of you were there. That\u2019s how she felt\nwhen they crowned her, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, and his jaw stiffened. </p><p>\u201cShe was never crowned. I killed her before\nanyone had the chance.\u201d</p><p>It was Sansa\u2019s turn to clutch his hand, and\ngive it a gentle squeeze.</p><p>He had done the right thing. He had done\nthe right thing and he had been punished and was still punishing himself for\nit. Jaime Lannister had done just the same and they had let him keep his\nposition for years, even under a different king. </p><p>But the world wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>\u201cI meant Cersei. But you did what needed to\nbe done, Jon. She would have murdered thousands, had she lived.\u201d She gulped,\nand so did he. \u201cShe would have killed you.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s eyes were finally on hers.</p><p>\u201cAnd then Arya would have killed her. So\nthe result would have been the same, you see?\u201d Sansa tried to lighten the mood.</p><p>He gave a short laugh, and his eyes were on\nhis lap once more. But his thumb was caressing the back of her hand, almost on\nits own accord. And she wouldn\u2019t release him either. But she had to tell him.\nMaybe he was happy with this life. Maybe he just wanted to spend the rest of\nhis years walking down the Wall and back and forth from the villages of the\nFree Folk and Castle Black, with Ghost by his side.</p><p>But she had to tell him.</p><p>Sansa straightened her shoulders, her mug\nlong forgotten at the table at her left.</p><p>\u201cThe northern lords don\u2019t accept the fate\nthey forced on you\u201d she finally spat out.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not really their business, is\nit?\u201d Jon scoffed, shrugging.</p><p>He release her hand to take another gulp\nfrom his ale. And she felt terribly empty.</p><p>Just as empty as when he rode south. Both\ntimes.</p><p>\u201cNor is it of those who passed your sentence,\nsince they\u2019re not here anymore, are they?\u201d Sansa growled, standing up so fast\nshe almost threw her chair back.</p><p>He stood up almost just as fast.</p><p>\u201cYou were one of those who said you had no\nchoice!\u201d Jon roared, waving his hand towards her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I hadn\u2019t!\u201d she shouted, crossing her\narms over her chest, trying to protect herself. \u201cNot back then, not with an\narmy of Unsullied and Dothraki threatening our family and our home.\u201d</p><p>He was panting, his fists closed tight at\nhis sides, his brow furrowed as he looked away from her.</p><p>She was panting too. </p><p>Why did he never listen to her?</p><p>\u201cSansa, I\u2019ve accepted my punishment. I\u2019m as\nhappy with it as I could be\u201d he muttered between gritted teeth, his jaw tense.</p><p>\u201cJon\u201d she tried, with a calmer tone.</p><p>He was still wheezing, looking at the\nstones under their feet.</p><p>She caught his wrist, forcing him to look\nat her. </p><p>\u201cJon, listen to me.\u201d He sighed again, his\neyes on her hand. \u201cJon, please.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes were on her. But there was a\nsadness there. Such a deep sadness.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t his place. This had never been.\nHe was ready to leave when she finally found him and asked him to fight for her\ncause. <i>Their</i> cause. And he had\nfought, and fought, and fought. The living, the dead. Ice and fire. And what for?\nWhat for, in the end?</p><p><i>What\nfor?</i></p><p>\u201cThe northern lords want you to come back.\nThey want the king they chose for the North to be in the North\u201d she told him,\nand his eyes were blown wide now. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>Jon did, as if he wasn\u2019t in control of his\nown body.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re their queen now. They chose you\u201d\nhe all but whined.</p><p>\u201cThey did and I am\u201d she agreed, nodding. \u201cBut\nthey can\u2019t wrap their heads around the fact that the men that saved their lives\n<i>twice</i> is wasting away at the Wall.\nAnd neither can I.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSansa, that cannot be. Bran passed the sentence-\u201c\n</p><p>\u201cBran isn\u2019t your king\u201d she cut.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s everyone\u2019s king now\u201d Jon said,\nwith a sarcastic smile.</p><p>She wanted to slap him.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she corrected, her hands nicely folded\nin her lap, her back straighter than ever. \u201cThe North didn\u2019t bend the knee to\nhim. You are a northerner, just as much as I am-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI was born at Dorne! Rhaegar Targaryen was\nmy father!\u201d Jon shouted.</p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes.</p><p>It was like he really wanted to be punished\nfor saving everyone\u2019s lives, after all.</p><p>Well, maybe he was just that daft. He had\nmade many mistakes. Maybe this was just another one.</p><p>Maybe he was just stupid. </p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t give up on him just now.</p><p>\u201cLyanna Stark birthed you. And you were raised\nat Winterfell, as a Stark, by Ned Stark. You were always a Stark in everything\nbut name. You once described yourself as a \u2018northern fool\u2019, as I can recall.\u201d</p><p>Jon closed his eyes, taking a long breath.</p><p>\u201cI know you never had a taste for politics,\nbut politics matter. And so do laws and all that stuff you always found boring\u201d\nshe tried to smile, her hand gently caressing his elbow. \u201cBut a \u2018northern fool\u2019\ndoesn\u2019t have to bend to a southern king\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>Still, he said nothing, his knuckles white\non the arms of his chair.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what Lyanna Mormont said\nthe day they made you king?\u201d she asked, and he opened his eyes again, though he\nwas making a point out of not looking at her. \u201cShe said that she knew no king\nbut the King in the North, whose name is Stark. She said the North remembers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p>Ah, there was hope there, now. Hope, in the\neyes who had rode to battle against Ramsay Bolton even though he knew he didn\u2019t\nhave enough man. He had saved her and she had saved him. It was time to do the\nsame again.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean that the North remembered.\nThe North remembered, and they know no king \u2013 or queen \u2013 for the matter, but\nthe Queen in the North. I\u2019m their queen now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. It\u2019s a bit obvious!\u201d he\nrumbled. But she had his attention.</p><p>She huffed. He was making this so much\nharder than it really needed to be.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s so obvious, as Queen in the\nNorth I have the power to release all of my subjects from all charges my people\nfind excessive.\u201d</p><p>Jon shook his head again.</p><p>But she had his ear.</p><p>Sansa caught both his hands, clutching them\ntightly to bring him back to earth.</p><p>\u201cTechnically you are my subject, Jon. Not\nBran\u2019s. So he can\u2019t pass this\u2026 this\u2026 life sentence on you. And doesn\u2019t have the\nauthority to do so.\u201d</p><p>His frown relaxed.</p><p>\u201cYour people want you home, Jon. They want\ntheir saviour to receive his just reward\u201d she told him, her voice calm now. He\nclutched her hands as well, as if he had finally decided to fight. \u201cI want you\nhome. I <i>need</i> you home. <i>Our</i> home.\u201d</p><p>Her voice failed her, and tears filled his\neyes.</p><p>\u201cOur home\u201d he repeated, and leaned forward\nto kiss her forehead, his hand on the back of her head.</p><p>Sansa shivered. But not from the cold.</p><p>He kept his warm lips against her skin for\nwhat felt like an eternity, and still not long enough, his breath ruffling the\nhairs on top of her head.</p><p>She swallowed thickly.</p><p>Jon pulled away instantly, clearing his\nthroat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Sansa\u201d he apologized,\nletting his hands fall back at his sides. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThey want me to marry\u201d she blurted out,\nand Jon shook his head sharply, his brow furrowed again. Sansa cupped his\ncheek, his beard caressing her palm, trying to sooth him. But she was feeling\nnervous too. \u201cThe North needs and heir, but- Please, Jon, I\u2026 Please, I need\nyou.\u201d</p><p>No, not nervous. She was terrified.\nTerrified that someone else was making decisions for her once more.</p><p>It was Jon\u2019s turn to straighten his back,\nhis hand around her wrist so he could kiss her knuckles.

A proper kiss, with a hand at the back of her head,\nthe other at her waist, pulling her to him, his lips moving gently against\nhers, making her gasp in surprise as she tangled her fingers in his hair, glad\nhe didn\u2019t have that small knot anymore.</p><p>That was what a proper kiss felt like,\nthen.</p><p>A sweet tingling, at the back of her head,\nand a warmth all over, with Jon\u2019s arms wrapped around hers, his hard chest\npressed against her, his strong heartbeat just as fast as hers.</p><p>And hope, a stupid hope, bloomed in her\nchest.

                "content": "<p>(so this is kind of a fix-it fic for <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU-63KWYFUSh3ec1LJyvSLw\">@snowysansastark</a> in which Sansa uses her power to pardon Jon. I hope it&rsquo;s okay! Big hug)</p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be there. And she\nknew it. Dozens of crows with their eyes fixed on her, probably the first woman\nto visit in moons now the wildlings had gone back to the North &ndash; the real\nNorth, as Tormund Giantsbane called it. It occurred to her briefly, as her\nboots avoided a small bud of something, that maybe the Watch wasn&rsquo;t needed\nanymore. The dead were gone forever. What did they watch over now, then?<br /></p><p>But without a Night&rsquo;s Watch what would many\nmen do with their lives? Or what would happen to criminals? Well, maybe that\nwas her brother&rsquo;s problem now, not hers. </p><p>She still had some power here, though. And\nshe intended to use it.</p><p>Many, many, many moons ago she had crossed\nthose gates, freezing and shaking with Lady Brienne by her side. Today the sun\nshone high in the sky, warming her cheeks, and she had ridden there with a few\nman behind her back.</p><p>He was no longer Lord Commander. He couldn&rsquo;t\nbe. Not after killing the queen. Not after committing treason.</p><p>But he hugged her with the same fierceness\nas he had that other time, a lifetime ago. And she buried her nose in his neck\njust the same way, her arms tight around his shoulders as he lifted her in the\nair and spun her around and mumbled her name in her ear.</p><p>She was queen now. She was the Queen in the\nNorth now, not some frightened little girl escaping her abusing husband.</p><p>And yet she hadn&rsquo;t felt much queenly when\nhe had run to her arms. And she didn&rsquo;t feel much queenly now, sitting by the\nfire with a mug of ale in her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t improve a bit.&rdquo; She curled her\nlip, twirling the mug between her hands. &ldquo;Your hair is shorter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, the days are warmer now&rdquo; he said,\ntaking another sip from his drink. </p><p>&ldquo;It suits you&rdquo; she mumbled, taking a large\ngulp. Maybe that would give her the courage.</p><p>He laughed, his hand curling around hers\nover her knee. She felt her cheeks warm, but the fire wasn&rsquo;t that close.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I, hmm-&rdquo; Jon cleared his throat &ldquo;I like\nyour dress. Did you make it yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>She beamed at him before she could avoid\nit. </p><p>&ldquo;I did! Though it doesn&rsquo;t have any wolf\nbits, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo; </p><p>Jon laughed, and so did she.</p><p>How could she have lived without him for so\nlong? The same day they had crowned her a raven from Castle Black had arrived,\ninforming her her cousin was leaving the Wall to escort the Free Folk back to\ntheir homes. How she hadn&rsquo;t gone mad with worry until another raven informed of\nhis safe return she didn&rsquo;t knew.</p><p>At least Arya had the decency to send a\nraven every moon&rsquo;s turn &ndash; still not enough, by Sansa&rsquo;s standards. Once she was\nback home Sansa would tell her a thing or two.</p><p>And Sansa&rsquo;s &lsquo;little birds&rsquo; at King&rsquo;s\nLanding informed her of Bran&rsquo;s every step. Or sometimes Bran just warged into\nsomeone from her household and spoke with her himself. That was kind of frightening\nat first. It still was.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I like the red leafs&rdquo; Jon jested, toying\nwith the long sleeves.</p><p>&ldquo;I wore it the day of the coronation&rdquo; she\nmumbled, her eyes on her feet.</p><p>Jon sighed, releasing the fabric.</p><p>&ldquo;It might have been a great day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t. Not really&rdquo; Sansa almost scoffed,\nher heart sinking in her chest. &ldquo;None of you were there. That&rsquo;s how she felt\nwhen they crowned her, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>He frowned, and his jaw stiffened. </p><p>&ldquo;She was never crowned. I killed her before\nanyone had the chance.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Sansa&rsquo;s turn to clutch his hand, and\ngive it a gentle squeeze.</p><p>He had done the right thing. He had done\nthe right thing and he had been punished and was still punishing himself for\nit. Jaime Lannister had done just the same and they had let him keep his\nposition for years, even under a different king. </p><p>But the world wasn&rsquo;t fair.</p><p>&ldquo;I meant Cersei. But you did what needed to\nbe done, Jon. She would have murdered thousands, had she lived.&rdquo; She gulped,\nand so did he. &ldquo;She would have killed you.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s eyes were finally on hers.</p><p>&ldquo;And then Arya would have killed her. So\nthe result would have been the same, you see?&rdquo; Sansa tried to lighten the mood.</p><p>He gave a short laugh, and his eyes were on\nhis lap once more. But his thumb was caressing the back of her hand, almost on\nits own accord. And she wouldn&rsquo;t release him either. But she had to tell him.\nMaybe he was happy with this life. Maybe he just wanted to spend the rest of\nhis years walking down the Wall and back and forth from the villages of the\nFree Folk and Castle Black, with Ghost by his side.</p><p>But she had to tell him.</p><p>Sansa straightened her shoulders, her mug\nlong forgotten at the table at her left.</p><p>&ldquo;The northern lords don&rsquo;t accept the fate\nthey forced on you&rdquo; she finally spat out.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not really their business, is\nit?&rdquo; Jon scoffed, shrugging.</p><p>He release her hand to take another gulp\nfrom his ale. And she felt terribly empty.</p><p>Just as empty as when he rode south. Both\ntimes.</p><p>&ldquo;Nor is it of those who passed your sentence,\nsince they&rsquo;re not here anymore, are they?&rdquo; Sansa growled, standing up so fast\nshe almost threw her chair back.</p><p>He stood up almost just as fast.</p><p>&ldquo;You were one of those who said you had no\nchoice!&rdquo; Jon roared, waving his hand towards her.</p><p>&ldquo;And I hadn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she shouted, crossing her\narms over her chest, trying to protect herself. &ldquo;Not back then, not with an\narmy of Unsullied and Dothraki threatening our family and our home.&rdquo;</p><p>He was panting, his fists closed tight at\nhis sides, his brow furrowed as he looked away from her.</p><p>She was panting too. </p><p>Why did he never listen to her?</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa, I&rsquo;ve accepted my punishment. I&rsquo;m as\nhappy with it as I could be&rdquo; he muttered between gritted teeth, his jaw tense.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon&rdquo; she tried, with a calmer tone.</p><p>He was still wheezing, looking at the\nstones under their feet.</p><p>She caught his wrist, forcing him to look\nat her. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon, listen to me.&rdquo; He sighed again, his\neyes on her hand. &ldquo;Jon, please.&rdquo;</p><p>His dark eyes were on her. But there was a\nsadness there. Such a deep sadness.</p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t his place. This had never been.\nHe was ready to leave when she finally found him and asked him to fight for her\ncause. <i>Their</i> cause. And he had\nfought, and fought, and fought. The living, the dead. Ice and fire. And what for?\nWhat for, in the end?</p><p><i>What\nfor?</i></p><p>&ldquo;The northern lords want you to come back.\nThey want the king they chose for the North to be in the North&rdquo; she told him,\nand his eyes were blown wide now. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon did, as if he wasn&rsquo;t in control of his\nown body.</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re their queen now. They chose you&rdquo;\nhe all but whined.</p><p>&ldquo;They did and I am&rdquo; she agreed, nodding. &ldquo;But\nthey can&rsquo;t wrap their heads around the fact that the men that saved their lives\n<i>twice</i> is wasting away at the Wall.\nAnd neither can I.&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa, that cannot be. Bran passed the sentence-&ldquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Bran isn&rsquo;t your king&rdquo; she cut.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s king now&rdquo; Jon said,\nwith a sarcastic smile.</p><p>She wanted to slap him.</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; she corrected, her hands nicely folded\nin her lap, her back straighter than ever. &ldquo;The North didn&rsquo;t bend the knee to\nhim. You are a northerner, just as much as I am-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was born at Dorne! Rhaegar Targaryen was\nmy father!&rdquo; Jon shouted.</p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes.</p><p>It was like he really wanted to be punished\nfor saving everyone&rsquo;s lives, after all.</p><p>Well, maybe he was just that daft. He had\nmade many mistakes. Maybe this was just another one.</p><p>Maybe he was just stupid. </p><p>But she wouldn&rsquo;t give up on him just now.</p><p>&ldquo;Lyanna Stark birthed you. And you were raised\nat Winterfell, as a Stark, by Ned Stark. You were always a Stark in everything\nbut name. You once described yourself as a &lsquo;northern fool&rsquo;, as I can recall.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon closed his eyes, taking a long breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you never had a taste for politics,\nbut politics matter. And so do laws and all that stuff you always found boring&rdquo;\nshe tried to smile, her hand gently caressing his elbow. &ldquo;But a &lsquo;northern fool&rsquo;\ndoesn&rsquo;t have to bend to a southern king&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p><p>Still, he said nothing, his knuckles white\non the arms of his chair.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember what Lyanna Mormont said\nthe day they made you king?&rdquo; she asked, and he opened his eyes again, though he\nwas making a point out of not looking at her. &ldquo;She said that she knew no king\nbut the King in the North, whose name is Stark. She said the North remembers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; </p><p>Ah, there was hope there, now. Hope, in the\neyes who had rode to battle against Ramsay Bolton even though he knew he didn&rsquo;t\nhave enough man. He had saved her and she had saved him. It was time to do the\nsame again.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I mean that the North remembered.\nThe North remembered, and they know no king &ndash; or queen &ndash; for the matter, but\nthe Queen in the North. I&rsquo;m their queen now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that. It&rsquo;s a bit obvious!&rdquo; he\nrumbled. But she had his attention.</p><p>She huffed. He was making this so much\nharder than it really needed to be.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s so obvious, as Queen in the\nNorth I have the power to release all of my subjects from all charges my people\nfind excessive.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon shook his head again.</p><p>But she had his ear.</p><p>Sansa caught both his hands, clutching them\ntightly to bring him back to earth.</p><p>&ldquo;Technically you are my subject, Jon. Not\nBran&rsquo;s. So he can&rsquo;t pass this&hellip; this&hellip; life sentence on you. And doesn&rsquo;t have the\nauthority to do so.&rdquo;</p><p>His frown relaxed.</p><p>&ldquo;Your people want you home, Jon. They want\ntheir saviour to receive his just reward&rdquo; she told him, her voice calm now. He\nclutched her hands as well, as if he had finally decided to fight. &ldquo;I want you\nhome. I <i>need</i> you home. <i>Our</i> home.&rdquo;</p><p>Her voice failed her, and tears filled his\neyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Our home&rdquo; he repeated, and leaned forward\nto kiss her forehead, his hand on the back of her head.</p><p>Sansa shivered. But not from the cold.</p><p>He kept his warm lips against her skin for\nwhat felt like an eternity, and still not long enough, his breath ruffling the\nhairs on top of her head.</p><p>She swallowed thickly.</p><p>Jon pulled away instantly, clearing his\nthroat.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry, Sansa&rdquo; he apologized,\nletting his hands fall back at his sides. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They want me to marry&rdquo; she blurted out,\nand Jon shook his head sharply, his brow furrowed again. Sansa cupped his\ncheek, his beard caressing her palm, trying to sooth him. But she was feeling\nnervous too. &ldquo;The North needs and heir, but- Please, Jon, I&hellip; Please, I need\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>No, not nervous. She was terrified.\nTerrified that someone else was making decisions for her once more.</p><p>It was Jon&rsquo;s turn to straighten his back,\nhis hand around her wrist so he could kiss her knuckles. Sansa shivered again.</p><p>&ldquo;I promised I&rsquo;d protect you&rdquo; he said, his\nvoice low. &ldquo;And I shall keep my promise. I owe you that much. You won&rsquo;t have to\nmarry anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled at her, but it was forced.</p><p>&ldquo;And it will be nice to be home again.

This is the tackiest looking display I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d Lorelei sighed at her boss\u2019s outburst, following him around the large room silently as he terrorized the workers that were set with the task of assembling their newest feature on the history of Westeros. She tried her best to apologize silently to each of her coworkers as the pair passed by all the while trying to herd her boss towards his office in hopes he\u2019d storm off to solitude. But Dr. Stroup was all waving arms, wild hair and wide eyes as he made his rounds, pointing out all of the things that he found wrong. \u201cWhat do I even pay any of you for? I should just be doing this myself!\u201d she watched in horror as he climbed up a small, shaky step ladder after someone, grabbing the man\u2019s ankle to try and pull him down so he could secure a house banner himself.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cDr. Stroup, it\u2019s still not finished,\u201d she assured, rushing over to the museum&rsquo;s curator, fully prepared to catch him if he fell. \u201cWe still have until this weekend! I\u2019m sure that everything will come together perfectly by then. We have a great staff, they\u2019ve never let us down before.\u201d she tried to argue, her hands outstretched to make the catch if needed.</p><p>He scoffed loudly, throwing the banner down. \u201cHardly! <i>Be careful with that</i>! It\u2019s centuries old!\u201d he screamed across the room at two men who were carrying a large crossbow to where it would be displayed. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s about time I retire,\u201d he went on, still perched precariously on his step ladder. \u201cThis place will be the end of me. Why I let you talk me into this exhibit I\u2019ll never know.\u201d he threw his arms in the air, the movement making him momentarily lose his balance. Lorelei felt like she might actually have a panic attack if he didn\u2019t come back down soon.</p><p>\u201cBecause, sir, people will love this display. You were even excited yourself to see these artifacts when they arrived, remember?\u201d he was silent, which she knew was because she was right. \u201c<i>Please</i> just get down from there. We need you alive for the opening. Alive and in one piece.\u201d she begged. Lorelei sighed loudly in relief as Dr. Stroup reluctantly stepped down, fixing his suit before glowering at the workers who rushed around him. </p><p>Lorelei had become his assistant four years ago in what had started in an internship. While she would\u2019ve preferred a higher position than just being an assistant, she hoped working so closely with the curator might one day work to her advantage once he retired. However the demanding the work might be. And sometimes it could be <i>extremely</i> demanding. Dr. Stroup was a tall, slender man with white blonde hair that stuck out every which way. He wore a tiny pair of red spectacles and often showed up to work in a silk robe, no matter how much Lorelei begged him not to. Pairing that with an extremely short attention span and thin patience with an overly keen eye for detail, it was a combination that made her feel like she was going to rip her hair out on a regular basis. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI promise, I\u2019ll make sure everything is perfect. Why don\u2019t you go out for lunch? I\u2019m sure by the time you get back I\u2019ll have everything under control.\u201d she gave him what she hoped was a reassuring smile.</p><p>Dr. Stroup was silent for a few passing moments before sighing loudly and a tad dramatically. \u201cWell, <i>alright</i>&hellip;I trust you. Don\u2019t be afraid to bring your fist down if these&hellip;<i>hooligans</i> aren\u2019t doing what you ask,\u201d he jabbed a finger towards some of the workers. \u201cI expect this to be handled with the same attention to detail that I execute, Lorelei.\u201d he looked at her over the tops of his glasses, eyebrows raised. She wasn\u2019t entirely sure what \u2018bringing her fist down\u2019 would mean, but she was at the point that she would agree to almost anything her boss asked of her if it meant getting rid of him for at least an hour. </p><p>She nodded, smiling. \u201cOf course. Nothing will go wrong.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Lorelei was muttering under her breath as she traveled the empty halls from her office towards the entrance of the museum. She was balancing stacks of paperwork that Dr. Stroup was supposed to have finished hours ago, but had instead laid on her desk for her to finish while he was out for the lunch she\u2019d suggested&hellip;a long, <i>long</i> lunch. The museum had closed about two hours ago, and she was sure she was probably the only soul left in the building aside from Henry, the night guard. He was a nice enough man, but in his mid fifties he didn\u2019t exactly make Lorelei feel content with her being under his sole protection. And with the new display, it made her even more nervous to think he was the one there that would be protecting it. </p><p>Heading down a small flight of stairs, Lorelei rounded the corner, taking a shortcut through a curtained off area and found herself back in the museum\u2019s newest display; A Look Into the History of Westeros. They had only just finished putting the collection together a few hours prior to closing, just in time for it\u2019s big opening this coming weekend. There was some relief in the fact that she\u2019d managed to finish before Dr. Stroup could come back and tear more of the display down, but not much. She couldn\u2019t quite place her finger on it, but there was a voice in the back of her mind telling her that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p> It had already been a major feat getting all the artifacts for the museum in itself. There\u2019d been a huge bidding war between a few other museums; a few in England and one in France, even a tacky tourist trap in Florida had shown an interest in the artifacts. But in the end Lorelei had convinced Dr. Stroup that their museum <i>needed</i> the display and that was that. The curator could never allow anyone else to have what he wanted.</p><p>She looked over to the center of the room, catching a glimpse of what was left of the Iron Throne, the seat where countless amount of kings, good and bad, had once sat. Even broken, it was still easy to imagine just how impressive it must have looked all those years ago in it\u2019s home of King\u2019s Landing. </p><p>Surrounding the throne were banners from the many different houses of the time; Lannister, Baratheon, Stark and Targaryen being the main focal points of the display. A gate from the Castle Black sat behind the throne, it\u2019s size greatly towering over the Iron Throne. She had been told it hadn\u2019t looked like much when it was found. The museum\u2019s restoration team had done what they could to repair it, but one of them had informed her that it was almost like it had been crushed at some point. \u00a0</p><p>Weapons, jewels and other artifacts that had been found in a dig only a few months ago sat in glass cases around the room and decorated the walls, even some labeled with whom they\u2019d belonged to. What was maybe her favorite part of the display hung up above her; a life sized replica of a dragon\u2019s skeleton. Even though it wasn\u2019t real (no one could determine whether or not dragon\u2019s <i>truly</i> had existed back then or if the Targaryen\u2019s were all just mad) but the sheer size of the creature had left her in awe of it. </p><p>Lorelei finally willed herself to exit the display and entered the main lobby, smiling politely at at Henry. \u201cFinally heading out for the night?\u201d he asked, setting his newspaper down on his desk. </p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019ll just have to finish all this up at home before I end up falling asleep at my desk,\u201d she said with a small laugh before coming to a halt. \u201cDammit&hellip;I forgot one of the folders in Dr. Stroup\u2019s office,\u201d she huffed, setting the stack of files along with her bag down onto Henry\u2019s desk. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d she called over her shoulder, rushing back towards her office as fast as her heels would allow her. </p><p>She\u2019d made it about half of the way through the Westeros display when the dizziness hit her. Afraid she might pass out, she leaned against a display case, eyes blinking furiously while she tried to make sense of what was happening. The room around her began to become hot, sweat quickly covering her forehead. \u2018<i>What in the hell could this be</i>?\u2019 she wondered. Was exhaustion setting in? Sure, she worked hard, but was it really enough to make her become ill?</p><p> After a few moments she realized it was much more than her being tired. The room was hazy around her. Lorelei wasn\u2019t able to decide if it was just her eyes playing a trick on her, or everything around her really was becoming a blur. And before she could even begin to comprehend what brought on this change, a bright light surrounded her and disappeared almost as quickly as it had come. The room returned to normal, the entire event so quick Lorelei was almost unsure whether she\u2019d imagined it or not. </p><p>\u201cMaybe I should call in sick tomorrow.\u201d she mumbled, shaking her head and slowly regaining her footing. She\u2019d only taken a few steps before she saw something move out of the corner of her eye. And this something had definitely not been there the first time she\u2019d come through the room. </p><p>A man sat in the Iron Throne, looking just as confused as Lorelei felt. Lorelei was frozen in shock as she looked up at him, her jaw dropping as she was at a loss for words. How could he have possibly gotten inside? Surely Henry wasn\u2019t <i>that</i> incompetent at his job.</p><p> The first thing she noticed about him was his cape. It was only fall in New York, and while the air did have a bit of a bite to it she didn\u2019t exactly see many people walking around in fur lined capes&hellip;or rather wearing much of anything the man was wearing. She could almost mistake him for a part of the display she came to realize, and quickly wondered if he was some sort of extremely overzealous history buff. Just what she needed.</p><p>She shook the thoughts from her head, stepping forward and trying to look as intimidating as a woman could look to a man with a sword strapped to him. A sword. Who carried swords? \u00a0\u201cHow in the hell did you get in here?\u201d she asked, immediately growing more irritated when he didn\u2019t respond. \u201cLook, I really don\u2019t want to have to call security\u2026\u201d she began again. The man looked over at her, but only for a moment before looking back at the things surrounding him. He looked down at his seat, jumping up from it as though it had burned him. </p><p>\u201cSeven hells!\u201d he exclaimed, turning his back to Lorelei and ignoring her altogether. He reached forward and slowly touched the broken throne, his eyes wide. \u201c&hellip;Where am I?\u201d Lorelei wasn\u2019t sure if he were asking her or himself, but that didn\u2019t really matter to her. She crossed her arms tightly over her chest, her foot tapping impatiently.</p><p> \u201cYou\u2019re in the Museum of Natural History. New York. Now, <i>how did you get in here</i>?\u201d she demanded. </p><p>He turned to her, really seeing at her for the first time. He looked her up and down slowly, as if he were studying her. Suddenly he stood up straight before bowing before her. Was this guy serious? \u201cMy apologies miss&hellip;I\u2019m actually not entirely sure how I got here,\u201d he began, finally answering her question. \u201cOne minute I was speaking to the Red Woman and now\u2026\u201d he turned away from her once again, looking around him. His eyes landed on the gate behind the throne, taking a step back in shock. \u201cThat gate&hellip;what\u2019s happened to Castle Black?\u201d he asked again to no one in particular. </p><p>Lorelei frowned, moving closer to him. Even though she was sure he was out of his mind, she had to admit he was handsome. Scars included. She could tell that even with the distance between them that he was much taller than she was. And he had this broody, mysterious look about her that had her intrigued. \u2018<i>Maggy was right</i>,\u2019 she thought. \u2018<i>I really do need to date more</i>.\u2019 </p><p>Next she noticed that he was covered in snow. A<i> lot</i> of snow. If she hadn\u2019t known better, she would\u2019ve guessed that he had just walked through a blizzard to get there. \u201cLook&hellip;I don\u2019t have time for this. I don\u2019t even care how you got in here, or why you\u2019re wearing that outfi-\u201d he turned and looked at her again what an amused look. </p><p>\u201c<i>My</i> outfit? Pardon me miss, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a lady dressed like that.\u201d he nodded to her dress. </p><p>Lorelei frowned, looking down at her outfit. \u201c<i>Excuse me</i>?\u201d she was a few seconds from smacking this guy back to whatever planet he came from. </p><p>The man shifted uncomfortably and cleared his throat. \u201cI meant no offense, I\u2019m sorry&hellip;my name is Jon. Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d there he went bowing again. Was this guy serious? Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch? He was a nut alright. But she decided maybe it would be better if she played along. She\u2019d try anything to get him out of her museum, and this seemed easier than trying to pull out a few moves she\u2019d learned at a handful of tai-bo classes</p><p>\u201cUh, Lorelei&hellip;of the Upper East Side&hellip;is this some sort of joke? Am I on one of those hidden camera shows?\u201d Jon\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean&hellip;you said we\u2019re in New York?\u201d she nodded. \u201cWhereabouts is that from the Wall?\u201d boy was he committed. Even his accent didn\u2019t falter. \u2018<i>It </i>is <i>a pretty nice accent</i>\u2026\u2019 she thought briefly before mentally smacking herself back to reality.</p><p>\u201cThe Wall?&hellip;As in Westeros?\u201d she laughed, shaking her head. \u201cNowhere close. Not even the same continent.\u201d the sheer look of surprise on Jon\u2019s face made Lorelei briefly feel like maybe this wasn\u2019t a joke after all. \u201cEr&hellip;this Red Woman you mentioned? What about her exactly?\u201d she asked, trying her very best to stay calm. It had to be a joke. It just had to. She wasn\u2019t really sure she could mentally handle anything past that. </p><p>\u201cMelisandre,\u201d he corrected. \u201cMost call her the Red Woman. She came to Castle Black along with Stannis Baratheon. The last I remember, she told me a group of Wildlings were at the gate, she\u2019d said they wanted a truce between the Wildlings and the Night\u2019s Watch. We both headed down to the gate to meet them, she had insisted on going&hellip;but before I could open it she said I would understand all in due time why she was doing this. I didn\u2019t get a chance to ask what she was talking about, next thing I knew I was here\u2026\u201d Lorelei could feel her stomach drop with each word that left Jon\u2019s lips. Stannis Baratheon? This was almost too insane to be true. \u2018<i>Please, please let this be a dream</i>,\u2019 she thought. \u2018<i>I fell asleep at my desk, that\u2019s all</i>.\u2019</p><p> Jon clenched his hand into a fist and brought it down onto the throne, his jaw clenching. \u201cI need to get home. Now.\u201d He whipped around, taking off almost too fast for Lorelei to follow after. Boy, this guy was a bit dramatic wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cOooh no you don\u2019t!\u201d she said, grabbing him by the arm. Jon glared down at her, but stopped. \u00a0\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to upset you, but I don\u2019t think running out into the streets of Manhattan is gonna help.\u201d she sighed. This was it. She was officially going insane. It would only be a matter of time before she joined Dr. Stroup in screaming at employees.</p><p> \u201cOkay, this is so beyond my better judgement but&hellip;let\u2019s just say that for whatever reason I believe you&hellip;well, I<i> think</i> I do. We can go to my place and sort all of this out, okay?\u201d Jon didn\u2019t seem all too pleased with this idea, but he wasn\u2019t shoving her aside and storming off, which she took as a good sign. \u201cIt\u2019s not too far from here, ten minute walk tops.\u201d she assured him. Her hand slid from his arm down to his wrist, pulling him along behind him. She decided whatever paperwork she had to finish could definitely wait until tomorrow. \u2018<i>It\u2019s because he\u2019s cute</i>.\u2019 a small voice in her mind said. \u2018<i>We\u2019ve been single for so long that we\u2019re willing to bring this nutjob home just because he\u2019s got those puppy dog eyes and a fancy accent</i>.\u2019 </p><p>She\u2019d slap that voice if she could.</p><p>They only made it a few steps when Jon stopped, Lorelei huffing loudly. \u201cWhat is it now? If we don\u2019t leave now Henry will come looking for us and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d even begin to explain this to him.\u201d but Jon was once again too busy looking around him to listen to her. </p><p>\u201c&hellip;You haven\u2019t seen a wolf around here have you?\u201d he asked.</p>",

And with the new display, it made her even more nervous to think he was the one there that would be protecting it. </p><p>Heading down a small flight of stairs, Lorelei rounded the corner, taking a shortcut through a curtained off area and found herself back in the museum\u2019s newest display; A Look Into the History of Westeros. They had only just finished putting the collection together a few hours prior to closing, just in time for it\u2019s big opening this coming weekend. There was some relief in the fact that she\u2019d managed to finish before Dr. Stroup could come back and tear more of the display down, but not much. She couldn\u2019t quite place her finger on it, but there was a voice in the back of her mind telling her that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p> It had already been a major feat getting all the artifacts for the museum in itself. There\u2019d been a huge bidding war between a few other museums; a few in England and one in France, even a tacky tourist trap in Florida had shown an interest in the artifacts. But in the end Lorelei had convinced Dr. Stroup that their museum <i>needed</i> the display and that was that. The curator could never allow anyone else to have what he wanted.</p><p>She looked over to the center of the room, catching a glimpse of what was left of the Iron Throne, the seat where countless amount of kings, good and bad, had once sat. Even broken, it was still easy to imagine just how impressive it must have looked all those years ago in it\u2019s home of King\u2019s Landing. </p><p>Surrounding the throne were banners from the many different houses of the time; Lannister, Baratheon, Stark and Targaryen being the main focal points of the display. A gate from the Castle Black sat behind the throne, it\u2019s size greatly towering over the Iron Throne. She had been told it hadn\u2019t looked like much when it was found. The museum\u2019s restoration team had done what they could to repair it, but one of them had informed her that it was almost like it had been crushed at some point. \u00a0</p><p>Weapons, jewels and other artifacts that had been found in a dig only a few months ago sat in glass cases around the room and decorated the walls, even some labeled with whom they\u2019d belonged to. What was maybe her favorite part of the display hung up above her; a life sized replica of a dragon\u2019s skeleton. Even though it wasn\u2019t real (no one could determine whether or not dragon\u2019s <i>truly</i> had existed back then or if the Targaryen\u2019s were all just mad) but the sheer size of the creature had left her in awe of it. </p><p>Lorelei finally willed herself to exit the display and entered the main lobby, smiling politely at at Henry. \u201cFinally heading out for the night?\u201d he asked, setting his newspaper down on his desk. </p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019ll just have to finish all this up at home before I end up falling asleep at my desk,\u201d she said with a small laugh before coming to a halt. \u201cDammit\u2026I forgot one of the folders in Dr. Stroup\u2019s office,\u201d she huffed, setting the stack of files along with her bag down onto Henry\u2019s desk. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d she called over her shoulder, rushing back towards her office as fast as her heels would allow her. </p><p>She\u2019d made it about half of the way through the Westeros display when the dizziness hit her. Afraid she might pass out, she leaned against a display case, eyes blinking furiously while she tried to make sense of what was happening. The room around her began to become hot, sweat quickly covering her forehead. \u2018<i>What in the hell could this be</i>?\u2019 she wondered. Was exhaustion setting in? Sure, she worked hard, but was it really enough to make her become ill?</p><p> After a few moments she realized it was much more than her being tired. The room was hazy around her. Lorelei wasn\u2019t able to decide if it was just her eyes playing a trick on her, or everything around her really was becoming a blur. And before she could even begin to comprehend what brought on this change, a bright light surrounded her and disappeared almost as quickly as it had come. The room returned to normal, the entire event so quick Lorelei was almost unsure whether she\u2019d imagined it or not. </p><p>\u201cMaybe I should call in sick tomorrow.\u201d she mumbled, shaking her head and slowly regaining her footing. She\u2019d only taken a few steps before she saw something move out of the corner of her eye. And this something had definitely not been there the first time she\u2019d come through the room. </p><p>A man sat in the Iron Throne, looking just as confused as Lorelei felt. Lorelei was frozen in shock as she looked up at him, her jaw dropping as she was at a loss for words. How could he have possibly gotten inside? Surely Henry wasn\u2019t <i>that</i> incompetent at his job.</p><p> The first thing she noticed about him was his cape. It was only fall in New York, and while the air did have a bit of a bite to it she didn\u2019t exactly see many people walking around in fur lined capes\u2026or rather wearing much of anything the man was wearing. She could almost mistake him for a part of the display she came to realize, and quickly wondered if he was some sort of extremely overzealous history buff. Just what she needed.</p><p>She shook the thoughts from her head, stepping forward and trying to look as intimidating as a woman could look to a man with a sword strapped to him. A sword. Who carried swords? \u00a0\u201cHow in the hell did you get in here?\u201d she asked, immediately growing more irritated when he didn\u2019t respond. \u201cLook, I really don\u2019t want to have to call security\u2026\u201d she began again. The man looked over at her, but only for a moment before looking back at the things surrounding him. He looked down at his seat, jumping up from it as though it had burned him. </p><p>\u201cSeven hells!\u201d he exclaimed, turning his back to Lorelei and ignoring her altogether. He reached forward and slowly touched the broken throne, his eyes wide. \u201c\u2026Where am I?\u201d Lorelei wasn\u2019t sure if he were asking her or himself, but that didn\u2019t really matter to her. She crossed her arms tightly over her chest, her foot tapping impatiently.</p><p> \u201cYou\u2019re in the Museum of Natural History. New York. Now, <i>how did you get in here</i>?\u201d she demanded. </p><p>He turned to her, really seeing at her for the first time. He looked her up and down slowly, as if he were studying her. Suddenly he stood up straight before bowing before her. Was this guy serious? \u201cMy apologies miss\u2026I\u2019m actually not entirely sure how I got here,\u201d he began, finally answering her question. \u201cOne minute I was speaking to the Red Woman and now\u2026\u201d he turned away from her once again, looking around him. His eyes landed on the gate behind the throne, taking a step back in shock. \u201cThat gate\u2026what\u2019s happened to Castle Black?\u201d he asked again to no one in particular. </p><p>Lorelei frowned, moving closer to him. Even though she was sure he was out of his mind, she had to admit he was handsome. Scars included. She could tell that even with the distance between them that he was much taller than she was. And he had this broody, mysterious look about her that had her intrigued. \u2018<i>Maggy was right</i>,\u2019 she thought. \u2018<i>I really do need to date more</i>.\u2019 </p><p>Next she noticed that he was covered in snow. A<i> lot</i> of snow. If she hadn\u2019t known better, she would\u2019ve guessed that he had just walked through a blizzard to get there. \u201cLook\u2026I don\u2019t have time for this. I don\u2019t even care how you got in here, or why you\u2019re wearing that outfi-\u201d he turned and looked at her again what an amused look. </p><p>\u201c<i>My</i> outfit? Pardon me miss, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a lady dressed like that.\u201d he nodded to her dress. </p><p>Lorelei frowned, looking down at her outfit. \u201c<i>Excuse me</i>?\u201d she was a few seconds from smacking this guy back to whatever planet he came from. </p><p>The man shifted uncomfortably and cleared his throat. \u201cI meant no offense, I\u2019m sorry\u2026my name is Jon. Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d there he went bowing again. Was this guy serious? Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch? He was a nut alright. But she decided maybe it would be better if she played along. She\u2019d try anything to get him out of her museum, and this seemed easier than trying to pull out a few moves she\u2019d learned at a handful of tai-bo classes</p><p>\u201cUh, Lorelei\u2026of the Upper East Side\u2026is this some sort of joke? Am I on one of those hidden camera shows?\u201d Jon\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean\u2026you said we\u2019re in New York?\u201d she nodded. \u201cWhereabouts is that from the Wall?\u201d boy was he committed. Even his accent didn\u2019t falter. \u2018<i>It </i>is <i>a pretty nice accent</i>\u2026\u2019 she thought briefly before mentally smacking herself back to reality.</p><p>\u201cThe Wall?\u2026As in Westeros?\u201d she laughed, shaking her head. \u201cNowhere close. Not even the same continent.\u201d the sheer look of surprise on Jon\u2019s face made Lorelei briefly feel like maybe this wasn\u2019t a joke after all. \u201cEr\u2026this Red Woman you mentioned? What about her exactly?\u201d she asked, trying her very best to stay calm. It had to be a joke. It just had to. She wasn\u2019t really sure she could mentally handle anything past that. </p><p>\u201cMelisandre,\u201d he corrected. \u201cMost call her the Red Woman. She came to Castle Black along with Stannis Baratheon. The last I remember, she told me a group of Wildlings were at the gate, she\u2019d said they wanted a truce between the Wildlings and the Night\u2019s Watch. We both headed down to the gate to meet them, she had insisted on going\u2026but before I could open it she said I would understand all in due time why she was doing this. I didn\u2019t get a chance to ask what she was talking about, next thing I knew I was here\u2026\u201d Lorelei could feel her stomach drop with each word that left Jon\u2019s lips. Stannis Baratheon? This was almost too insane to be true. \u2018<i>Please, please let this be a dream</i>,\u2019 she thought. \u2018<i>I fell asleep at my desk, that\u2019s all</i>.\u2019</p><p> Jon clenched his hand into a fist and brought it down onto the throne, his jaw clenching. \u201cI need to get home. Now.\u201d He whipped around, taking off almost too fast for Lorelei to follow after. Boy, this guy was a bit dramatic wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cOooh no you don\u2019t!\u201d she said, grabbing him by the arm. Jon glared down at her, but stopped. \u00a0\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to upset you, but I don\u2019t think running out into the streets of Manhattan is gonna help.\u201d she sighed. This was it. She was officially going insane. It would only be a matter of time before she joined Dr. Stroup in screaming at employees.</p><p> \u201cOkay, this is so beyond my better judgement but\u2026let\u2019s just say that for whatever reason I believe you\u2026well, I<i> think</i> I do. We can go to my place and sort all of this out, okay?\u201d Jon didn\u2019t seem all too pleased with this idea, but he wasn\u2019t shoving her aside and storming off, which she took as a good sign. \u201cIt\u2019s not too far from here, ten minute walk tops.\u201d she assured him. Her hand slid from his arm down to his wrist, pulling him along behind him. She decided whatever paperwork she had to finish could definitely wait until tomorrow. \u2018<i>It\u2019s because he\u2019s cute</i>.\u2019 a small voice in her mind said. \u2018<i>We\u2019ve been single for so long that we\u2019re willing to bring this nutjob home just because he\u2019s got those puppy dog eyes and a fancy accent</i>.\u2019 </p><p>She\u2019d slap that voice if she could.</p><p>They only made it a few steps when Jon stopped, Lorelei huffing loudly. \u201cWhat is it now? If we don\u2019t leave now Henry will come looking for us and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d even begin to explain this to him.\u201d but Jon was once again too busy looking around him to listen to her. </p><p>\u201c\u2026You haven\u2019t seen a wolf around here have you?\u201d he asked.</p></p>",

On a night alone, Lorelei comes face to face with a piece of history that is all too real; Jon Snow.\n\n</p><p><b>Pairing</b>: Jon Snow/OC</p><p><b>A/N</b>: So this is a fic I started awhile ago but never finished. I\u2019ve rewritten chapters to fit more with the show\u2019s storyline and I have about eight chapters of it written so far. And hopefully I can get around to the sequel I\u2019ve had planned too.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p><b><br></b>\u201c<i>Please</i> tell me this is some sort of a joke! This is the tackiest looking display I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d Lorelei sighed at her boss\u2019s outburst, following him around the large room silently as he terrorized the workers that were set with the task of assembling their newest feature on the history of Westeros. She tried her best to apologize silently to each of her coworkers as the pair passed by all the while trying to herd her boss towards his office in hopes he\u2019d storm off to solitude. But Dr. Stroup was all waving arms, wild hair and wide eyes as he made his rounds, pointing out all of the things that he found wrong. \u201cWhat do I even pay any of you for? I should just be doing this myself!\u201d she watched in horror as he climbed up a small, shaky step ladder after someone, grabbing the man\u2019s ankle to try and pull him down so he could secure a house banner himself.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cDr. Stroup, it\u2019s still not finished,\u201d she assured, rushing over to the museum\u2019s curator, fully prepared to catch him if he fell. \u201cWe still have until this weekend! I\u2019m sure that everything will come together perfectly by then. We have a great staff, they\u2019ve never let us down before.\u201d she tried to argue, her hands outstretched to make the catch if needed.</p><p>He scoffed loudly, throwing the banner down. \u201cHardly! <i>Be careful with that</i>! It\u2019s centuries old!\u201d he screamed across the room at two men who were carrying a large crossbow to where it would be displayed. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s about time I retire,\u201d he went on, still perched precariously on his step ladder. \u201cThis place will be the end of me. Why I let you talk me into this exhibit I\u2019ll never know.\u201d he threw his arms in the air, the movement making him momentarily lose his balance. Lorelei felt like she might actually have a panic attack if he didn\u2019t come back down soon.</p><p>\u201cBecause, sir, people will love this display. You were even excited yourself to see these artifacts when they arrived, remember?\u201d he was silent, which she knew was because she was right. \u201c<i>Please</i> just get down from there. We need you alive for the opening. Alive and in one piece.\u201d she begged. Lorelei sighed loudly in relief as Dr. Stroup reluctantly stepped down, fixing his suit before glowering at the workers who rushed around him. </p><p>Lorelei had become his assistant four years ago in what had started in an internship. While she would\u2019ve preferred a higher position than just being an assistant, she hoped working so closely with the curator might one day work to her advantage once he retired. However the demanding the work might be. And sometimes it could be <i>extremely</i> demanding. Dr. Stroup was a tall, slender man with white blonde hair that stuck out every which way. He wore a tiny pair of red spectacles and often showed up to work in a silk robe, no matter how much Lorelei begged him not to. Pairing that with an extremely short attention span and thin patience with an overly keen eye for detail, it was a combination that made her feel like she was going to rip her hair out on a regular basis. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI promise, I\u2019ll make sure everything is perfect. Why don\u2019t you go out for lunch? I\u2019m sure by the time you get back I\u2019ll have everything under control.\u201d she gave him what she hoped was a reassuring smile.</p><p>Dr. Stroup was silent for a few passing moments before sighing loudly and a tad dramatically. \u201cWell, <i>alright</i>\u2026I trust you. Don\u2019t be afraid to bring your fist down if these\u2026<i>hooligans</i> aren\u2019t doing what you ask,\u201d he jabbed a finger towards some of the workers. \u201cI expect this to be handled with the same attention to detail that I execute, Lorelei.\u201d he looked at her over the tops of his glasses, eyebrows raised. She wasn\u2019t entirely sure what \u2018bringing her fist down\u2019 would mean, but she was at the point that she would agree to almost anything her boss asked of her if it meant getting rid of him for at least an hour. </p><p>She nodded, smiling. \u201cOf course. Nothing will go wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Lorelei was muttering under her breath as she traveled the empty halls from her office towards the entrance of the museum. She was balancing stacks of paperwork that Dr. Stroup was supposed to have finished hours ago, but had instead laid on her desk for her to finish while he was out for the lunch she\u2019d suggested\u2026a long, <i>long</i> lunch. The museum had closed about two hours ago, and she was sure she was probably the only soul left in the building aside from Henry, the night guard. He was a nice enough man, but in his mid fifties he didn\u2019t exactly make Lorelei feel content with her being under his sole protection. And with the new display, it made her even more nervous to think he was the one there that would be protecting it. </p><p>Heading down a small flight of stairs, Lorelei rounded the corner, taking a shortcut through a curtained off area and found herself back in the museum\u2019s newest display; A Look Into the History of Westeros. They had only just finished putting the collection together a few hours prior to closing, just in time for it\u2019s big opening this coming weekend. There was some relief in the fact that she\u2019d managed to finish before Dr. Stroup could come back and tear more of the display down, but not much. She couldn\u2019t quite place her finger on it, but there was a voice in the back of her mind telling her that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p> It had already been a major feat getting all the artifacts for the museum in itself. There\u2019d been a huge bidding war between a few other museums; a few in England and one in France, even a tacky tourist trap in Florida had shown an interest in the artifacts. But in the end Lorelei had convinced Dr. Stroup that their museum <i>needed</i> the display and that was that. The curator could never allow anyone else to have what he wanted.</p><p>She looked over to the center of the room, catching a glimpse of what was left of the Iron Throne, the seat where countless amount of kings, good and bad, had once sat. Even broken, it was still easy to imagine just how impressive it must have looked all those years ago in it\u2019s home of King\u2019s Landing. </p><p>Surrounding the throne were banners from the many different houses of the time; Lannister, Baratheon, Stark and Targaryen being the main focal points of the display. A gate from the Castle Black sat behind the throne, it\u2019s size greatly towering over the Iron Throne. She had been told it hadn\u2019t looked like much when it was found. The museum\u2019s restoration team had done what they could to repair it, but one of them had informed her that it was almost like it had been crushed at some point. \u00a0</p><p>Weapons, jewels and other artifacts that had been found in a dig only a few months ago sat in glass cases around the room and decorated the walls, even some labeled with whom they\u2019d belonged to. What was maybe her favorite part of the display hung up above her; a life sized replica of a dragon\u2019s skeleton. Even though it wasn\u2019t real (no one could determine whether or not dragon\u2019s <i>truly</i> had existed back then or if the Targaryen\u2019s were all just mad) but the sheer size of the creature had left her in awe of it. </p><p>Lorelei finally willed herself to exit the display and entered the main lobby, smiling politely at at Henry. \u201cFinally heading out for the night?\u201d he asked, setting his newspaper down on his desk. </p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019ll just have to finish all this up at home before I end up falling asleep at my desk,\u201d she said with a small laugh before coming to a halt. \u201cDammit\u2026I forgot one of the folders in Dr. Stroup\u2019s office,\u201d she huffed, setting the stack of files along with her bag down onto Henry\u2019s desk. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d she called over her shoulder, rushing back towards her office as fast as her heels would allow her. </p><p>She\u2019d made it about half of the way through the Westeros display when the dizziness hit her. Afraid she might pass out, she leaned against a display case, eyes blinking furiously while she tried to make sense of what was happening. The room around her began to become hot, sweat quickly covering her forehead. \u2018<i>What in the hell could this be</i>?\u2019 she wondered. Was exhaustion setting in?

The room returned to normal, the entire event so quick Lorelei was almost unsure whether she\u2019d imagined it or not. </p><p>\u201cMaybe I should call in sick tomorrow.\u201d she mumbled, shaking her head and slowly regaining her footing. She\u2019d only taken a few steps before she saw something move out of the corner of her eye. And this something had definitely not been there the first time she\u2019d come through the room. </p><p>A man sat in the Iron Throne, looking just as confused as Lorelei felt. Lorelei was frozen in shock as she looked up at him, her jaw dropping as she was at a loss for words. How could he have possibly gotten inside? Surely Henry wasn\u2019t <i>that</i> incompetent at his job.</p><p> The first thing she noticed about him was his cape. It was only fall in New York, and while the air did have a bit of a bite to it she didn\u2019t exactly see many people walking around in fur lined capes\u2026or rather wearing much of anything the man was wearing. She could almost mistake him for a part of the display she came to realize, and quickly wondered if he was some sort of extremely overzealous history buff. Just what she needed.</p><p>She shook the thoughts from her head, stepping forward and trying to look as intimidating as a woman could look to a man with a sword strapped to him. A sword. Who carried swords? \u00a0\u201cHow in the hell did you get in here?\u201d she asked, immediately growing more irritated when he didn\u2019t respond. \u201cLook, I really don\u2019t want to have to call security\u2026\u201d she began again. The man looked over at her, but only for a moment before looking back at the things surrounding him. He looked down at his seat, jumping up from it as though it had burned him. </p><p>\u201cSeven hells!\u201d he exclaimed, turning his back to Lorelei and ignoring her altogether. He reached forward and slowly touched the broken throne, his eyes wide. \u201c\u2026Where am I?\u201d Lorelei wasn\u2019t sure if he were asking her or himself, but that didn\u2019t really matter to her. She crossed her arms tightly over her chest, her foot tapping impatiently.</p><p> \u201cYou\u2019re in the Museum of Natural History. New York. Now, <i>how did you get in here</i>?\u201d she demanded. </p><p>He turned to her, really seeing at her for the first time. He looked her up and down slowly, as if he were studying her. Suddenly he stood up straight before bowing before her. Was this guy serious? \u201cMy apologies miss\u2026I\u2019m actually not entirely sure how I got here,\u201d he began, finally answering her question. \u201cOne minute I was speaking to the Red Woman and now\u2026\u201d he turned away from her once again, looking around him. His eyes landed on the gate behind the throne, taking a step back in shock. \u201cThat gate\u2026what\u2019s happened to Castle Black?\u201d he asked again to no one in particular. </p><p>Lorelei frowned, moving closer to him. Even though she was sure he was out of his mind, she had to admit he was handsome. Scars included. She could tell that even with the distance between them that he was much taller than she was. And he had this broody, mysterious look about her that had her intrigued. \u2018<i>Maggy was right</i>,\u2019 she thought. \u2018<i>I really do need to date more</i>.\u2019 </p><p>Next she noticed that he was covered in snow. A<i> lot</i> of snow. If she hadn\u2019t known better, she would\u2019ve guessed that he had just walked through a blizzard to get there. \u201cLook\u2026I don\u2019t have time for this. I don\u2019t even care how you got in here, or why you\u2019re wearing that outfi-\u201d he turned and looked at her again what an amused look. </p><p>\u201c<i>My</i> outfit? Pardon me miss, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a lady dressed like that.\u201d he nodded to her dress. </p><p>Lorelei frowned, looking down at her outfit. \u201c<i>Excuse me</i>?\u201d she was a few seconds from smacking this guy back to whatever planet he came from. </p><p>The man shifted uncomfortably and cleared his throat. \u201cI meant no offense, I\u2019m sorry\u2026my name is Jon. Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d there he went bowing again. Was this guy serious? Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch? He was a nut alright. But she decided maybe it would be better if she played along. She\u2019d try anything to get him out of her museum, and this seemed easier than trying to pull out a few moves she\u2019d learned at a handful of tai-bo classes</p><p>\u201cUh, Lorelei\u2026of the Upper East Side\u2026is this some sort of joke? Am I on one of those hidden camera shows?\u201d Jon\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean\u2026you said we\u2019re in New York?\u201d she nodded. \u201cWhereabouts is that from the Wall?\u201d boy was he committed. Even his accent didn\u2019t falter. \u2018<i>It </i>is <i>a pretty nice accent</i>\u2026\u2019 she thought briefly before mentally smacking herself back to reality.</p><p>\u201cThe Wall?\u2026As in Westeros?\u201d she laughed, shaking her head. \u201cNowhere close. Not even the same continent.\u201d the sheer look of surprise on Jon\u2019s face made Lorelei briefly feel like maybe this wasn\u2019t a joke after all. \u201cEr\u2026this Red Woman you mentioned? What about her exactly?\u201d she asked, trying her very best to stay calm. It had to be a joke. It just had to. She wasn\u2019t really sure she could mentally handle anything past that. </p><p>\u201cMelisandre,\u201d he corrected. \u201cMost call her the Red Woman. She came to Castle Black along with Stannis Baratheon. The last I remember, she told me a group of Wildlings were at the gate, she\u2019d said they wanted a truce between the Wildlings and the Night\u2019s Watch. We both headed down to the gate to meet them, she had insisted on going\u2026but before I could open it she said I would understand all in due time why she was doing this. I didn\u2019t get a chance to ask what she was talking about, next thing I knew I was here\u2026\u201d Lorelei could feel her stomach drop with each word that left Jon\u2019s lips. Stannis Baratheon? This was almost too insane to be true. \u2018<i>Please, please let this be a dream</i>,\u2019 she thought. \u2018<i>I fell asleep at my desk, that\u2019s all</i>.\u2019</p><p> Jon clenched his hand into a fist and brought it down onto the throne, his jaw clenching. \u201cI need to get home. Now.\u201d He whipped around, taking off almost too fast for Lorelei to follow after. Boy, this guy was a bit dramatic wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cOooh no you don\u2019t!\u201d she said, grabbing him by the arm. Jon glared down at her, but stopped. \u00a0\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to upset you, but I don\u2019t think running out into the streets of Manhattan is gonna help.\u201d she sighed. This was it. She was officially going insane. It would only be a matter of time before she joined Dr. Stroup in screaming at employees.</p><p> \u201cOkay, this is so beyond my better judgement but\u2026let\u2019s just say that for whatever reason I believe you\u2026well, I<i> think</i> I do. We can go to my place and sort all of this out, okay?\u201d Jon didn\u2019t seem all too pleased with this idea, but he wasn\u2019t shoving her aside and storming off, which she took as a good sign. \u201cIt\u2019s not too far from here, ten minute walk tops.\u201d she assured him. Her hand slid from his arm down to his wrist, pulling him along behind him. She decided whatever paperwork she had to finish could definitely wait until tomorrow. \u2018<i>It\u2019s because he\u2019s cute</i>.\u2019 a small voice in her mind said. \u2018<i>We\u2019ve been single for so long that we\u2019re willing to bring this nutjob home just because he\u2019s got those puppy dog eyes and a fancy accent</i>.\u2019 </p><p>She\u2019d slap that voice if she could.</p><p>They only made it a few steps when Jon stopped, Lorelei huffing loudly. \u201cWhat is it now? If we don\u2019t leave now Henry will come looking for us and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d even begin to explain this to him.\u201d but Jon was once again too busy looking around him to listen to her. </p><p>\u201c\u2026You haven\u2019t seen a wolf around here have you?\u201d he asked.</p></p>",

On a night alone, Lorelei comes face to face with a piece of history that is all too real; Jon Snow.\n\n</p><p><b>Pairing</b>: Jon Snow/OC</p><p><b>A/N</b>: So this is a fic I started awhile ago but never finished. I&rsquo;ve rewritten chapters to fit more with the show&rsquo;s storyline and I have about eight chapters of it written so far. And hopefully I can get around to the sequel I&rsquo;ve had planned too.&nbsp;</p><p><b><br /></b>&ldquo;<i>Please</i> tell me this is some sort of a joke! This is the tackiest looking display I&rsquo;ve ever seen!&rdquo; Lorelei sighed at her boss&rsquo;s outburst, following him around the large room silently as he terrorized the workers that were set with the task of assembling their newest feature on the history of Westeros. She tried her best to apologize silently to each of her coworkers as the pair passed by all the while trying to herd her boss towards his office in hopes he&rsquo;d storm off to solitude. But Dr. Stroup was all waving arms, wild hair and wide eyes as he made his rounds, pointing out all of the things that he found wrong. &ldquo;What do I even pay any of you for? I should just be doing this myself!&rdquo; she watched in horror as he climbed up a small, shaky step ladder after someone, grabbing the man&rsquo;s ankle to try and pull him down so he could secure a house banner himself.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Stroup, it&rsquo;s still not finished,&rdquo; she assured, rushing over to the museum&rsquo;s curator, fully prepared to catch him if he fell. &ldquo;We still have until this weekend! I&rsquo;m sure that everything will come together perfectly by then. We have a great staff, they&rsquo;ve never let us down before.&rdquo; she tried to argue, her hands outstretched to make the catch if needed.</p><p>He scoffed loudly, throwing the banner down. &ldquo;Hardly! <i>Be careful with that</i>! It&rsquo;s centuries old!&rdquo; he screamed across the room at two men who were carrying a large crossbow to where it would be displayed. &ldquo;Honestly, it&rsquo;s about time I retire,&rdquo; he went on, still perched precariously on his step ladder. &ldquo;This place will be the end of me. Why I let you talk me into this exhibit I&rsquo;ll never know.&rdquo; he threw his arms in the air, the movement making him momentarily lose his balance. Lorelei felt like she might actually have a panic attack if he didn&rsquo;t come back down soon.</p><p>&ldquo;Because, sir, people will love this display. You were even excited yourself to see these artifacts when they arrived, remember?&rdquo; he was silent, which she knew was because she was right. &ldquo;<i>Please</i> just get down from there. We need you alive for the opening. Alive and in one piece.&rdquo; she begged. Lorelei sighed loudly in relief as Dr. Stroup reluctantly stepped down, fixing his suit before glowering at the workers who rushed around him. </p><p>Lorelei had become his assistant four years ago in what had started in an internship. While she would&rsquo;ve preferred a higher position than just being an assistant, she hoped working so closely with the curator might one day work to her advantage once he retired. However the demanding the work might be. And sometimes it could be <i>extremely</i> demanding. Dr. Stroup was a tall, slender man with white blonde hair that stuck out every which way. He wore a tiny pair of red spectacles and often showed up to work in a silk robe, no matter how much Lorelei begged him not to. Pairing that with an extremely short attention span and thin patience with an overly keen eye for detail, it was a combination that made her feel like she was going to rip her hair out on a regular basis. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I promise, I&rsquo;ll make sure everything is perfect. Why don&rsquo;t you go out for lunch? I&rsquo;m sure by the time you get back I&rsquo;ll have everything under control.&rdquo; she gave him what she hoped was a reassuring smile.</p><p>Dr. Stroup was silent for a few passing moments before sighing loudly and a tad dramatically. &ldquo;Well, <i>alright</i>&hellip;I trust you. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to bring your fist down if these&hellip;<i>hooligans</i> aren&rsquo;t doing what you ask,&rdquo; he jabbed a finger towards some of the workers. &ldquo;I expect this to be handled with the same attention to detail that I execute, Lorelei.&rdquo; he looked at her over the tops of his glasses, eyebrows raised. She wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure what &lsquo;bringing her fist down&rsquo; would mean, but she was at the point that she would agree to almost anything her boss asked of her if it meant getting rid of him for at least an hour. </p><p>She nodded, smiling. &ldquo;Of course. Nothing will go wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Lorelei was muttering under her breath as she traveled the empty halls from her office towards the entrance of the museum. She was balancing stacks of paperwork that Dr. Stroup was supposed to have finished hours ago, but had instead laid on her desk for her to finish while he was out for the lunch she&rsquo;d suggested&hellip;a long, <i>long</i> lunch. The museum had closed about two hours ago, and she was sure she was probably the only soul left in the building aside from Henry, the night guard. He was a nice enough man, but in his mid fifties he didn&rsquo;t exactly make Lorelei feel content with her being under his sole protection. And with the new display, it made her even more nervous to think he was the one there that would be protecting it. </p><p>Heading down a small flight of stairs, Lorelei rounded the corner, taking a shortcut through a curtained off area and found herself back in the museum&rsquo;s newest display; A Look Into the History of Westeros. They had only just finished putting the collection together a few hours prior to closing, just in time for it&rsquo;s big opening this coming weekend. There was some relief in the fact that she&rsquo;d managed to finish before Dr. Stroup could come back and tear more of the display down, but not much. She couldn&rsquo;t quite place her finger on it, but there was a voice in the back of her mind telling her that something wasn&rsquo;t right.</p><p> It had already been a major feat getting all the artifacts for the museum in itself. There&rsquo;d been a huge bidding war between a few other museums; a few in England and one in France, even a tacky tourist trap in Florida had shown an interest in the artifacts. But in the end Lorelei had convinced Dr. Stroup that their museum <i>needed</i> the display and that was that. The curator could never allow anyone else to have what he wanted.</p><p>She looked over to the center of the room, catching a glimpse of what was left of the Iron Throne, the seat where countless amount of kings, good and bad, had once sat. Even broken, it was still easy to imagine just how impressive it must have looked all those years ago in it&rsquo;s home of King&rsquo;s Landing. </p><p>Surrounding the throne were banners from the many different houses of the time; Lannister, Baratheon, Stark and Targaryen being the main focal points of the display. A gate from the Castle Black sat behind the throne, it&rsquo;s size greatly towering over the Iron Throne. She had been told it hadn&rsquo;t looked like much when it was found. The museum&rsquo;s restoration team had done what they could to repair it, but one of them had informed her that it was almost like it had been crushed at some point. &nbsp;</p><p>Weapons, jewels and other artifacts that had been found in a dig only a few months ago sat in glass cases around the room and decorated the walls, even some labeled with whom they&rsquo;d belonged to. What was maybe her favorite part of the display hung up above her; a life sized replica of a dragon&rsquo;s skeleton. Even though it wasn&rsquo;t real (no one could determine whether or not dragon&rsquo;s <i>truly</i> had existed back then or if the Targaryen&rsquo;s were all just mad) but the sheer size of the creature had left her in awe of it. </p><p>Lorelei finally willed herself to exit the display and entered the main lobby, smiling politely at at Henry. &ldquo;Finally heading out for the night?&rdquo; he asked, setting his newspaper down on his desk. </p><p>&ldquo;Yep, I&rsquo;ll just have to finish all this up at home before I end up falling asleep at my desk,&rdquo; she said with a small laugh before coming to a halt. &ldquo;Dammit&hellip;I forgot one of the folders in Dr. Stroup&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; she huffed, setting the stack of files along with her bag down onto Henry&rsquo;s desk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo; she called over her shoulder, rushing back towards her office as fast as her heels would allow her. </p><p>She&rsquo;d made it about half of the way through the Westeros display when the dizziness hit her. Afraid she might pass out, she leaned against a display case, eyes blinking furiously while she tried to make sense of what was happening. The room around her began to become hot, sweat quickly covering her forehead. &lsquo;<i>What in the hell could this be</i>?&rsquo; she wondered. Was exhaustion setting in? Sure, she worked hard, but was it really enough to make her become ill?</p><p> After a few moments she realized it was much more than her being tired. The room was hazy around her. Lorelei wasn&rsquo;t able to decide if it was just her eyes playing a trick on her, or everything around her really was becoming a blur. And before she could even begin to comprehend what brought on this change, a bright light surrounded her and disappeared almost as quickly as it had come. The room returned to normal, the entire event so quick Lorelei was almost unsure whether she&rsquo;d imagined it or not. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I should call in sick tomorrow.&rdquo; she mumbled, shaking her head and slowly regaining her footing. She&rsquo;d only taken a few steps before she saw something move out of the corner of her eye.

Giving your trust to the wrong leader is deadly, Daenerys.</p>\n\n<p>3. You can seem innocent and nice, but deep inside you desire power, Bran Stark.</p>\n\n<p>4. You can act all tough, but all you really want is to find yourself, Arya.</p>\n\n<p>5. If you desire something so bad, you\u2019ll get it, Sansa.</p>\n\n<p>6. Not everyone gets poetic justice, Cersei.</p>\n\n<p>7. You can commit so many mistakes and be forgiven so many times, Tyrion.</p>\n\n<p>8. You can be the best girlfriend, but your man\u2019s still going to look for a hoe, Brienne.</p>\n\n<p>9. You can have all the right intentions and still look bad, Varys.</p>\n\n<p>10. Sometimes, the only loyal friend you have is your pet, right, Drogon and Ghost?</p>\n\n<p>11. The rich gets richer, Bronn.</p>\n\n<p>12. No, Jaimie, it\u2019s not okay to f*ck your sister. It\u2019s just not. I got nothing for you.</p>\n\n<p>13. Sometimes, your worst enemy is family, Hound.</p>\n\n<p>14.\u00a0Never expect anything from anyone, fans. This is why I have trust issues.</p>\n\n<p>15. It\u2019s not about the destination, it\u2019s the journey, David Benioff and D.B. weiss.</p>\n\n<p>If you think about it, Game of Thrones is real life. Still, that ending, though.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you, Game of Thrones! We will miss you.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. The West is unknown. Westeros is not safe. We might need Jon Snow again, after all.</p>",
