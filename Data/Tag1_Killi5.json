She hated that this guy held any power over her. </p><p>\u201cWhat did you do, Eve?\u201d Villanelle asked, pushing open her own knife and looking at Eve. </p><p>\u201cI was coming to warn you.\u201d Eve could have been terrified, but Villanelle was impressed how well she was holding her composure. \u201cHe knew we were coming.

The door was open just enough for Villanelle to see a sliver of light.</p><p> She opened the door slowly, grabbing the knife from her waistband and smiling. The look of shock on the targets face was one of her favorite parts. </p><p>Villanelle stood in the doorframe and as she took in the sight before her she felt her blood run cold in her veins. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d She whispered, the knife gripped tightly in her left hand. </p><p>\u201cYou must be the one she was waiting for.\u201d The man stood in the middle of the room with a knife to Eve\u2019s neck. \u201cI hope for her sake you\u2019re better at this than she is.\u201d He smiled and Villanelle could see almost every yellow tooth in his head. She hated him, the feeling burned like a furnace in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>\u201cLet her go. I\u2019ll kill you quickly. I promise.\u201d Villanelle knew better than to show her cards. If she let her guard down she was giving this man power. She hated the thought of that. </p><p>Villanelle actually hated that she could feel her heart hammering in her chest as she saw the sharp metal blade so close to Eve\u2019s pulse point. She hated that this guy held any power over her. </p><p>\u201cWhat did you do, Eve?\u201d Villanelle asked, pushing open her own knife and looking at Eve. </p><p>\u201cI was coming to warn you.\u201d Eve could have been terrified, but Villanelle was impressed how well she was holding her composure. \u201cHe knew we were coming. I didn\u2019t..\u201d Eve trailed off and Villanelle cocked her head curiously. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t what?\u201d Villanelle proded, erasing the man from her mind. All she wanted to know was what Eve had been thinking following her here.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to get hurt,\u201d Eve confessed, the quiet tone of her voice having nothing to do with the weapon pressing into her skin. </p><p>Villanelle felt a prickling sensation crawling up her spine. It lingered on the back of her neck and intensified as she looked into Eve\u2019s dark eyes. </p><p>\u201cNot to interrupt this sweet moment, but I\u2019m ready to slit her fucking throat.\u201d The man looked confused by the exchange between the two women. </p><p>\u201cLet me tell you how this will end.\u201d Villanelle was in her element now and she knew it. Her confidence filled like a balloon in her chest, she was not going to let Eve die here. \u201cYou kill her and I make sure they are finding pieces of your body for years.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle saw the familiar flicker of fear in the man\u2019s eyes. It excited her to gain more control from him. </p><p>\u201cIf you let her go I will let you live. You will walk out of this house and go on with whatever shit life you were living. I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he was considering his options. Villanelle was ready to kill him. She was calculating if she could get to him before he slid the knife completely across Eve\u2019s neck. </p><p>\u201cTell you what. I\u2019m not going to kill her.\u201d He removed the knife from Eve\u2019s neck. \u201cBut I am going to slow you down.\u201d </p><p>Without another word Villanelle watched him plunge the knife into Eve\u2019s stomach. Eve immediately crumbled to the ground with a should of pain. </p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Villanelle yelled, rushing over and grabbing Eve and putting her head on her lap. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, you\u2019re fine.\u201d </p><p>Villanelle barely registered the man rushing out of the room. She pulled out her phone and told Carolyn to call an ambulance. </p><p>Eve was shaking in her arms and Villanelle could barely send the message before dropping her phone onto the carpeted ground beneath them. </p><p>\u201cIt hurts.\u201d Eve\u2019s eyes were filled with tears as she looked up at Villanelle. \u201cPlease, make it stop.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle pressed her hand against the wound. The red stain had already spread across Eve\u2019s shirt. Villanelle could see the wound was deep</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You\u2019re fine,\u201d Villanelle kept repeating. \u201cHelp is coming and I\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just-\u201d Eve struggled for breath and Villanelle had push down the instinct to chase the man who had done this to her. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay you don\u2019t have to talk.\u201d Villanelle wasn\u2019t sure what fear felt like, but she imagined it was something like this. She couldn\u2019t handle the idea of the light leaving Eve\u2019s eyes right in front of her. </p><p>Eve shook her head and took in a shallow and shaky breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d </p><p>Villanelle used her free hand to cup Eve\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re so stupid, Eve. So stupid.\u201d She slowly caressed Eve\u2019s cheek with her thumb.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Eve laughed, leaning into Villanelle\u2019s touch. </p><p>Villanelle heard the sirens pulling up in front of the flat.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here. I\u2019ll see you soon\u201d Villanelle stood up and wiped the blood onto her pants. </p><p>Eve looked up at Villanelle complete understanding on her face. \u201cPlease be careful.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to suffer. I\u2019ll meet you at the hospital.\u201d Villanelle grabbed her knife once again and prepared for the hunt.
