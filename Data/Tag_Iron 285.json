Well Harley was 10 at the time of Iron Man 3 which was set in 2013, do some basic math and he is about 16 and up, since we have absolutely no idea what year Avengers 4 is set in. (Harley\u2019s birthday is also not listed anywhere.) Since Rdj\u2019s contract is going to run out after that movie it would be the perfect time to replace Iron Man. Now marvel is smart enough to know that they just can\u2019t replace Rdj, because he basically is Tony Stark, but what if we replace the character but not necessarily the actor? If ya still don\u2019t get it I think Harley will take up the mantle as Iron Man. Now unfortunately Iron Man will not be leading the MCU anymore, nor will he be the face of it. That job goes to Captain Marvel</p>",

I really hope it lives up to whatever you had in mind. </b></p><p>Anthony Stark sat in the dust, his fists clenched and his breathing  heavy and uneven. The only other soul on the entire planet with him was a  cyborg he had never met before today. Tony starred into the distance  blinking quickly, swallowing the growing lump in his throat and trying  to suppress the sobs rising. He pressed a hand to his mouth trying to  quiet the cries, maybe pass it off as a cough. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark?&rdquo; the voice asked from behind him. Tony closed his eyes, trying to steady himself. <i>Mr. Stark I-I don&rsquo;t feel so good.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice cracked. Nebula chose to ignore it. </p><p>&ldquo;Where should we go now? We might be able to track down Thanos,&rdquo;  Nebula said, already trying to formulate a plan. Tony scolded himself  for not keeping up, he had to stay ahead of the purple goon. The goon who just took everything. </p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Tony agreed standing up. &ldquo;We&hellip;We should head back to earth,  some of the avengers must still be alive&hellip;and uh we&rsquo;ll formulate the  rest of the plan with them there.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s mind raced a mile a minute,  trying to block the ache both in his side and chest and the wetness in  his eyes. &ldquo;Your ship! Where&rsquo;s your ship that you used to get here?&rdquo; </p><p><i>Would there be an avengers to return to? </i></p><p>Nebula led Tony, who was limping and stumbling around from his wounds  to the vessel she had used to arrive. When she uncovered it though they  found it to be halfway crushed under the remains of the moon that had  been used in the earlier fight.</p><p>&ldquo;Dammit,&rdquo; Nebula muttered as she pushed the debris off her ship. &ldquo;That purple bastard,&rdquo; \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cTony Stark!\u201d The magician stepped out of his magic portal, solemn and determined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh,&rdquo; Tony stuttered leaning on a piece of rock. &ldquo;I-can-um ah ha!  Yeah okay I can fix this, um I&rsquo;ve got spare parts somewhere in here-\u201d he gestured to his suit \u201cwe  can fix this!&rdquo; </p><p>Nebula stared at the man for a moment before nodding. &ldquo;Yes, let me just finish this. What do you need?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Tony said quickly. &ldquo;I mean-I&rsquo;ll inspect it first then  figure that out.&rdquo; he closed his eyes trying to calm himself down.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sup Mr. Stark,&rdquo; The kid stood over him holding back the oncoming attack. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Kid where you&rsquo;d come from?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A fieldtrip-AH!&rdquo; he started before being thrown into the air. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark why don&rsquo;t you rest for a little bit, I&rsquo;ll start on this.&rdquo; Nebula told him, Tony&rsquo;s eyes shot open. </p><p>&ldquo;What? No, no it&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; Tony reassured her shaking his head. &ldquo;Just  get- just get the rubble off it and I can get to work on getting us back  to earth,&rdquo; </p><p>Nebula resumed her task and the two stood in silence. </p><p><i>&ldquo;And this suit is ridiculously intuitive by the way so if anything  it&rsquo;s kinda your fault that I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Peter stumbled on his words. Tony  looked at him for a moment. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What did you just say?&rdquo; Tony asked. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;-I-I take that back,&rdquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;You were right kid,&rdquo; Tony thought to himself. &ldquo;It was my fault that  you ended up here.&rdquo; He inhaled sharply, closing his eyes and licked his  lips. &ldquo;Dammit I was such a dumbass,&rdquo; </p><p><i>Strange&rsquo;s head was shaking back and forth crazily, Tony ran over  to him grabbing his hand as Stephen fell back to the ground yelling. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back, you&rsquo;re alright,&rdquo; Tony said. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Starlord asked from behind them. Stephen looked at them all with barely controlled panic in his eyes. </i></p><p>Nebula<i> </i>finished moving the rock off of the remains of her ship. Tony walked over and nodded. &ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;ll get to work on this,&rdquo; </p><p>Nebula nodded before walking away, Tony vaguely wondered where she  was going but at the same time didn&rsquo;t care. He had other things to worry  about. Kneeling on the ground he gently pushed wires and scraps of  metal around trying to find out if anything was missing. </p><p>&ldquo;It was the only way,&rdquo; Stephen said quietly. Brown eyes met the the  doctor&rsquo;s, what color were they? Blue or green? Maybe a color all their  own. Before Tony Doctor Strange turned to dust. What was going on?</p><p>Tony quickened his pace, eyes scanning over the wreckage and biting  his lip. The engine was almost completely crushed. He pinched the bridge  of his noes and sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;I can fix this,&rdquo; Tony muttered to himself as he started with the rest of his ship. </p><p>~</p><p>Tony had lost track of time, his eyesight was getting blurry and  Nebula still hadn&rsquo;t returned. But the engine was fixed and the only  thing missing from the ship were the windows. Which Tony didn&rsquo;t think  was needed as Nebula was a cyborg and he had his suit&hellip;at least most of  his suit as he used parts of it to replace the ship. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happening&hellip;&rdquo; Mantis said nervously as she looked  about her, everyone starred at her confused for moment, but as a crack  of thunder rang through the air she turned to dust and was carried away  with the wind. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Quill?&rdquo; Drax asked fearfully looking at his arm.

Tony coughed up blood, but ignored it  as he continued the search for his new comrade. </p><p>He found the  cyborg sitting at the edge of a valley that stretched as far as his  eyes could see. Tony sighed as he walked over to her, trying to shake  off the growing headache. </p><p>&ldquo;Nebula?&rdquo; Tony asked, she quickly turned to face him standing up. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes  sir?&rdquo; she asked standing in perfect uniform with her voice stern, yet  the tear rolling down her face betrayed her. Tony looked at her  crestfallen.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you doing okay?&rdquo; Tony asked worrying about how she was fairing after recent events. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine sir,&rdquo; she nodded. Tony shook his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Kid&hellip;&rdquo;  Tony started, his voice shook a little, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;It&rsquo;s okay, we&rsquo;re-we&rsquo;re  going to go to earth-go to earth and get the avengers-kick Thanos&rsquo;s  ass-kick his ass and everyone will return&hellip;&rdquo; Tony said, he spoke those  words yet in his heart he didn&rsquo;t know if that was true, he didn&rsquo;t know  what was true anymore. </p><p>Nebula nodded. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said  her voice not showing a hint of pain, yet her eyes welled up with tears.  Tony sighed and held out his arms for her, he didn&rsquo;t know her well, but  that didn&rsquo;t stop him from wanting to console her. She hesitated for a  moment, not quite sure of what to do before walking forward and  collapsing in his arms, sobbing. </p><p><i>Tony looked to the  wizard, his oak tree eyes with guilt swirling in them.

Her voice  robotic yet more human than some people Tony had met throughout his  life. Tony wasn&rsquo;t completely sure of who Nebula cried about, his only  guess was <i>Gamora</i>. The person he guardians had been looking for when he met them, the person Quill had attacked Thanos for. </p><p>He wanted to tell her that everything would work out. That they&rsquo;d all  be alright, that people would be waiting for them who could help. But  he couldn&rsquo;t, he wasn&rsquo;t sure of anything anymore.</p><p>Slowly Nebula&rsquo;s  sobs slowed down, until Titan was silent. Nebula backed away and whipped  the tears off her face. &ldquo;We should be going,&rdquo; </p><p>Tony nodded,  he hobbled behind her as they walked back to the ship. Nebula reached  the ship before him and climbed in. Tony hesitated, turning away to  shield his face from her. He wanted to be given time to scream, to cry  to damn his whole life. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Mr. Stark?&rdquo; </i></p><p>But it was time to walk through hell. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel so good,&rdquo; Tony faced Peter, fear etched into the teenager&rsquo;s face. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alright,&rdquo; Tony said trying to quickly comfort his son. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t-I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening-I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Peter rambled  shaking as he fell into Tony&rsquo;s arms. Peter held onto him for life. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to go I don&rsquo;t want to go! Sir please, please. I don&rsquo;t want  go, I don&rsquo;t want to go please!&rdquo; Tony gently layed him on the ground  tears welled up in both of their eyes, they didn&rsquo;t know what was  happening. Peter could feel it, he tried to fight back with every inch  of his being but he could feel himself slipping away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Hell better be prepared because he was prepared to fight the entire universe after what it had done to him. </p>",

The only other soul on the entire planet with him was a  cyborg he had never met before today. Tony starred into the distance  blinking quickly, swallowing the growing lump in his throat and trying  to suppress the sobs rising. He pressed a hand to his mouth trying to  quiet the cries, maybe pass it off as a cough. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d the voice asked from behind him. Tony closed his eyes, trying to steady himself. <i>Mr. Stark I-I don\u2019t feel so good.</i></p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice cracked. Nebula chose to ignore it. </p><p>\u201cWhere should we go now? We might be able to track down Thanos,\u201d  Nebula said, already trying to formulate a plan. Tony scolded himself  for not keeping up, he had to stay ahead of the purple goon. The goon who just took everything. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony agreed standing up. \u201cWe\u2026We should head back to earth,  some of the avengers must still be alive\u2026and uh we\u2019ll formulate the  rest of the plan with them there.\u201d Tony\u2019s mind raced a mile a minute,  trying to block the ache both in his side and chest and the wetness in  his eyes. \u201cYour ship!

Brown eyes met the the  doctor\u2019s, what color were they? Blue or green? Maybe a color all their  own. Before Tony Doctor Strange turned to dust.

But the engine was fixed and the only  thing missing from the ship were the windows. Which Tony didn\u2019t think  was needed as Nebula was a cyborg and he had his suit\u2026at least most of  his suit as he used parts of it to replace the ship. </p><p><i>\u201cSomething\u2019s happening\u2026\u201d Mantis said nervously as she looked  about her, everyone starred at her confused for moment, but as a crack  of thunder rang through the air she turned to dust and was carried away  with the wind. </i></p><p><i>\u201cQuill?\u201d Drax asked fearfully looking at his arm.

Tony looked at her  crestfallen.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing okay?\u201d Tony asked worrying about how she was fairing after recent events. </p><p>\u201cFine sir,\u201d she nodded. Tony shook his head. </p><p>\u201cKid\u2026\u201d  Tony started, his voice shook a little, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026It\u2019s okay, we\u2019re-we\u2019re  going to go to earth-go to earth and get the avengers-kick Thanos\u2019s  ass-kick his ass and everyone will return\u2026\u201d Tony said, he spoke those  words yet in his heart he didn\u2019t know if that was true, he didn\u2019t know  what was true anymore. </p><p>Nebula nodded. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said  her voice not showing a hint of pain, yet her eyes welled up with tears.  Tony sighed and held out his arms for her, he didn\u2019t know her well, but  that didn\u2019t stop him from wanting to console her. She hesitated for a  moment, not quite sure of what to do before walking forward and  collapsing in his arms, sobbing. </p><p><i>Tony looked to the  wizard, his oak tree eyes with guilt swirling in them.

Nebula reached  the ship before him and climbed in. Tony hesitated, turning away to  shield his face from her.

The only other soul on the entire planet with him was a  cyborg he had never met before today. Tony starred into the distance  blinking quickly, swallowing the growing lump in his throat and trying  to suppress the sobs rising. He pressed a hand to his mouth trying to  quiet the cries, maybe pass it off as a cough. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark?&rdquo; the voice asked from behind him. Tony closed his eyes, trying to steady himself. <i>Mr. Stark I-I don&rsquo;t feel so good.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice cracked. Nebula chose to ignore it. </p><p>&ldquo;Where should we go now? We might be able to track down Thanos,&rdquo;  Nebula said, already trying to formulate a plan. Tony scolded himself  for not keeping up, he had to stay ahead of the purple goon. The goon who just took everything. </p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Tony agreed standing up. &ldquo;We&hellip;We should head back to earth,  some of the avengers must still be alive&hellip;and uh we&rsquo;ll formulate the  rest of the plan with them there.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s mind raced a mile a minute,  trying to block the ache both in his side and chest and the wetness in  his eyes. &ldquo;Your ship! Where&rsquo;s your ship that you used to get here?&rdquo; </p><p><i>Would there be an avengers to return to? </i></p><p>Nebula led Tony, who was limping and stumbling around from his wounds  to the vessel she had used to arrive. When she uncovered it though they  found it to be halfway crushed under the remains of the moon that had  been used in the earlier fight.</p><p>&ldquo;Dammit,&rdquo; Nebula muttered as she pushed the debris off her ship. &ldquo;That purple bastard,&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Tony Stark!&rdquo; The magician stepped out of his magic portal, solemn and determined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh,&rdquo; Tony stuttered leaning on a piece of rock. &ldquo;I-can-um ah ha!  Yeah okay I can fix this, um I&rsquo;ve got spare parts somewhere in here-&rdquo; he gestured to his suit &ldquo;we  can fix this!&rdquo; </p><p>Nebula stared at the man for a moment before nodding. &ldquo;Yes, let me just finish this. What do you need?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Tony said quickly. &ldquo;I mean-I&rsquo;ll inspect it first then  figure that out.&rdquo; he closed his eyes trying to calm himself down.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sup Mr. Stark,&rdquo; The kid stood over him holding back the oncoming attack. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Kid where you&rsquo;d come from?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A fieldtrip-AH!&rdquo; he started before being thrown into the air. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark why don&rsquo;t you rest for a little bit, I&rsquo;ll start on this.&rdquo; Nebula told him, Tony&rsquo;s eyes shot open. </p><p>&ldquo;What? No, no it&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; Tony reassured her shaking his head. &ldquo;Just  get- just get the rubble off it and I can get to work on getting us back  to earth,&rdquo; </p><p>Nebula resumed her task and the two stood in silence. </p><p><i>&ldquo;And this suit is ridiculously intuitive by the way so if anything  it&rsquo;s kinda your fault that I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Peter stumbled on his words. Tony  looked at him for a moment. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What did you just say?&rdquo; Tony asked. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;-I-I take that back,&rdquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;You were right kid,&rdquo; Tony thought to himself. &ldquo;It was my fault that  you ended up here.&rdquo; He inhaled sharply, closing his eyes and licked his  lips. &ldquo;Dammit I was such a dumbass,&rdquo; </p><p><i>Strange&rsquo;s head was shaking back and forth crazily, Tony ran over  to him grabbing his hand as Stephen fell back to the ground yelling. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back, you&rsquo;re alright,&rdquo; Tony said. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Starlord asked from behind them. Stephen looked at them all with barely controlled panic in his eyes. </i></p><p>Nebula<i> </i>finished moving the rock off of the remains of her ship. Tony walked over and nodded. &ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;ll get to work on this,&rdquo; </p><p>Nebula nodded before walking away, Tony vaguely wondered where she  was going but at the same time didn&rsquo;t care.
