This is essentially fanfic research, and for that it\u2019s always best to go back to the original source.</p><p>So if this is a Jon and Sansa reread why am I starting with a Bran chapter? Because while on the surface Bran I is about Bran, it\u2019s also equally about introducing the male side of the Starks and so has a lot of valuable insight into Jon\u2019s character. It\u2019s also one of my favorite chapters in the series for just how sparse and laconic Martin\u2019s style is throughout.</p><blockquote><p><i>The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king\u2019s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran\u2019s life.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is such a great hook to open a chapter and the book as a whole with and ticks a lot of important boxes in just a paragraph: the setting, Bran\u2019s age and state of mind, and a good hook. Who is being beheaded? Why is he being beheaded? Why is a child going to go see it? As a writer you almost always want to have an underlying tension or question that the reader wants answered to drive them forwards.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bran\u2019s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \u201cKeep the pony well in hand,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd don\u2019t look away. Father will know if you do.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s interesting Martin has Jon play the role of older brother here rather than Robb. Despite his half-brother bastard status Jon is clearly close with Bran, as we\u2019ll see later when he visits Bran\u2019s bedside after he falls. He doesn\u2019t coddle Bran though; partly this is to emphasize the Stark coldness, but also I think it\u2019s an insight into Jon\u2019s character.</p><p>There\u2019s a recurring thread through these early chapters that Jon doesn\u2019t have quite the same leeway as the true born Starks in Winterfell. He\u2019s probably especially sensitive to disappointing Ned. After all, his existence at all is already an embarrassment and spot on Ned\u2019s honor.</p><!-- more --><blockquote><p><i>Bran\u2019s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father\u2019s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.</i></p></blockquote><p>As Ned\u2019s son Jon does exactly this in ADWD when he has to don his own Lord Commander face. While in this chapter we don\u2019t get to see into Ned\u2019s head, in ASOS and ADWD we\u2019ll see just how much it costs Jon to maintain the cold Lord Stark persona both personally and politically when he makes Gilly touch the fire and give up her child, or forces Sam to travel south, or demands child hostages from the Wildlings to cross the Wall.</p><p>Jon\u2019s cold practically is an aspect of his character that doesn\u2019t really get explored much in fanfic, or even really included at all. There\u2019s a couple reasons for it, I think. First, even if they have read the books, the show\u2019s presentation of Jon tends to be what sticks in most people\u2019s heads, and the show has definite habit of softening and whitewashing Jon\u2019s character so he can be the Hero, not to mention Kit Harington\u2019s constantly plaintive look.</p><p>Second, I think a lot of fic writers prefer to have Sansa be the cold hard one (which is also a show invention, but we\u2019ll get into that later) paired with Jon as the emotionally softer one. Which is fair. I love that contrast and dynamic. But I do wish we got a little more examination and exploration of the parallels between how they both got to their Stark face and how they interact now.</p><blockquote><p><i>The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy\u2019s feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. \u201cAss,\u201d Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\u2019s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. \u201cYou did well,\u201d Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.</i></p></blockquote><p>Just in case you were wondering if Theon was a terrible person or not.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe deserter died bravely,\u201d Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\u2019s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \u201cHe had courage, at the least.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon Snow said quietly. \u201cIt was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.\u201d Jon\u2019s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon calling Robb \u201cStark\u201d here is interesting for a couple reasons. Partly this is just Martin trying to set up really quickly for the reader Jon\u2019s bastard status; even Arya, who Jon is closest to, will in her inner narration call him her half-brother quite a bit. But it also signals a kind of a acknowledged formal space between Jon and the other Starklings, even if it\u2019s one they\u2019re used to.</p><blockquote><p><i>Robb was not impressed. \u201cThe Others take his eyes,\u201d he swore. \u201cHe died well. Race you to the bridge?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDone,\u201d Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.</i></p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s a really chilling kind of casualness to the older boys\u2019 reaction to the execution. Even Jon who treats it more seriously than Theon is still able to shift modes easily. Part of this I think is just <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness\" target=\"_blank\">early installment weirdness</a>, but it also nicely shoves the reader into the medieval mindset of westeros in a way that the show never quite achieves. Though it\u2019s underrated, the underlying medieval mindset is one of the key differences between books and show and causes havoc in later seasons as the showrunners have to adjust and soften character to make them more palatable to a modern audience while not changing the underlying actions themselves. It creates a sort of cognitive dissonance and some of the themes logical coherence slip through the crack.</p><p>The contrast between Robb laughing and Jon silent and intent is a great character detail. Robb isn\u2019t taking this as seriously as Jon, because Jon takes everything seriously. He has to. It\u2019s another way his bastard status influences his personality. Robb can lose and he\u2019ll still be lord of Winterfell one day. Jon? Not so much. So this is how Jon treats everything in his life: seriously. It\u2019s a also a bit of a childhood and teenager thing.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bran thought about it. \u201cCan a man still be brave if he\u2019s afraid?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat is the only time a man can be brave,\u201d his father told him.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the clearest articulations of Martin\u2019s ethos and the theme in all of his work, but especially ASOIAF, of existential heroism. When we talk about Jon as a hero, it\u2019s that which makes him one in the end, not the magical sword or rags to riches; when it comes down to it he does the right thing no matter how much it costs him personally (ASOS) or materially (ADWD). It\u2019s also one of the themes the show completely misses, instead espousing that being honorable makes you stupid.</p><blockquote><p><i>His lord father smiled. \u201cOld Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night\u2019s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran had no answer for that. \u201cKing Robert has a headsman,\u201d he said, uncertainly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe does,\u201d his father admitted. \u201cAs did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man\u2019s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOne day, Bran, you will be Robb\u2019s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>This has been explored more and better in other meta, but the Starks and the north in general has a far more personal view of justice and governing than the south. This isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s better, but it is different. Later as Lord Commander we\u2019ll see just how much of that ethos Jon picked up from Ned: in beheading Janos Slynt, in the mission creep at Hardhome, and in his failure to really use his institutional power to make changes to the Night\u2019s Watch. There\u2019s a strong sense of personal responsibility and connections in northern governance.</p><blockquote><p><i>Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman\u2019s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father\u2019s kennel.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s no freak,\u201d Jon said calmly. \u201cThat\u2019s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Theon Greyjoy said, \u201cThere\u2019s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see one now,\u201d Jon replied.</i></p></blockquote><p>Notice how calm is Jon with Theon here. It\u2019s a bit of a cheap shot at Theon to make us like Jon more as a character, but is also very in line with his character. Very rarely even in later books does Jon react emotionally to things (with a few exceptions like when he tries to murder Alliser Thorne); he tends not to from a place of emotion and almost always takes time to think things through. The reason for this is Jon is calm because he has to be. It\u2019s a result of his marginalized status in the Stark household. There\u2019s no leeway in his bastard position for emotional outbursts: Catelyn isn\u2019t going to put up with that shit, and he\u2019s already enough of an embarrassment to Ned just by existing.</p><p>While we don\u2019t ever really get much thought from either Jon or Theon about their relationship with each other, their interaction in this chapter is I think indicative of it as a whole; slightly adversarial and only cordial because of their mutual friendship with Robb. Theon as a whole is a really interesting foil to Jon; irreverent where Jon is serious, emotional where Jon is calm, dismissive where Jon is willing to learn about others.</p><p>They both have outsider status in the Stark household, but instead of bonding, Theon is significantly closer to Robb. While Jon does have privilege, Theon has more (he is the Greyjoy heir after all) and more importantly, has internalized it far more. It makes sense that aside from just personality differences Theon would think himself above Jon and be drawn to Robb as a source of privilege.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cBorn with the dead,\u201d another man put in. \u201cWorse luck.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo matter,\u201d said Hullen. \u201cThey be dead soon enough too.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe sooner the better,\u201d Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \u201cGive the beast here, Bran.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>In case you had any doubt Theon is in fact the worst, here we have him enthusiastically ready to commit puppy murder.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cLord Stark,\u201d Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. \u201cThere are five pups,\u201d he told Father. \u201cThree male, two female.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat of it, Jon?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou have five trueborn children,\u201d Jon said. \u201cThree sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran saw his father\u2019s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself.

After all, his existence at all is already an embarrassment and spot on Ned\u2019s honor.</p>[[MORE]]<blockquote><p><i>Bran\u2019s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father\u2019s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.</i></p></blockquote><p>As Ned\u2019s son Jon does exactly this in ADWD when he has to don his own Lord Commander face. While in this chapter we don\u2019t get to see into Ned\u2019s head, in ASOS and ADWD we\u2019ll see just how much it costs Jon to maintain the cold Lord Stark persona both personally and politically when he makes Gilly touch the fire and give up her child, or forces Sam to travel south, or demands child hostages from the Wildlings to cross the Wall.</p><p>Jon\u2019s cold practically is an aspect of his character that doesn\u2019t really get explored much in fanfic, or even really included at all. There\u2019s a couple reasons for it, I think. First, even if they have read the books, the show\u2019s presentation of Jon tends to be what sticks in most people\u2019s heads, and the show has definite habit of softening and whitewashing Jon\u2019s character so he can be the Hero, not to mention Kit Harington\u2019s constantly plaintive look.</p><p>Second, I think a lot of fic writers prefer to have Sansa be the cold hard one (which is also a show invention, but we\u2019ll get into that later) paired with Jon as the emotionally softer one. Which is fair. I love that contrast and dynamic. But I do wish we got a little more examination and exploration of the parallels between how they both got to their Stark face and how they interact now.</p><blockquote><p><i>The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy\u2019s feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. \u201cAss,\u201d Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\u2019s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. \u201cYou did well,\u201d Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.</i></p></blockquote><p>Just in case you were wondering if Theon was a terrible person or not.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe deserter died bravely,\u201d Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\u2019s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \u201cHe had courage, at the least.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon Snow said quietly. \u201cIt was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.\u201d Jon\u2019s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon calling Robb \u201cStark\u201d here is interesting for a couple reasons. Partly this is just Martin trying to set up really quickly for the reader Jon\u2019s bastard status; even Arya, who Jon is closest to, will in her inner narration call him her half-brother quite a bit. But it also signals a kind of a acknowledged formal space between Jon and the other Starklings, even if it\u2019s one they\u2019re used to.</p><blockquote><p><i>Robb was not impressed. \u201cThe Others take his eyes,\u201d he swore. \u201cHe died well. Race you to the bridge?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDone,\u201d Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.</i></p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s a really chilling kind of casualness to the older boys\u2019 reaction to the execution. Even Jon who treats it more seriously than Theon is still able to shift modes easily. Part of this I think is just <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness\" target=\"_blank\">early installment weirdness</a>, but it also nicely shoves the reader into the medieval mindset of westeros in a way that the show never quite achieves. Though it\u2019s underrated, the underlying medieval mindset is one of the key differences between books and show and causes havoc in later seasons as the showrunners have to adjust and soften character to make them more palatable to a modern audience while not changing the underlying actions themselves. It creates a sort of cognitive dissonance and some of the themes logical coherence slip through the crack.</p><p>The contrast between Robb laughing and Jon silent and intent is a great character detail. Robb isn\u2019t taking this as seriously as Jon, because Jon takes everything seriously. He has to. It\u2019s another way his bastard status influences his personality. Robb can lose and he\u2019ll still be lord of Winterfell one day. Jon? Not so much. So this is how Jon treats everything in his life: seriously. It\u2019s a also a bit of a childhood and teenager thing.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bran thought about it. \u201cCan a man still be brave if he\u2019s afraid?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat is the only time a man can be brave,\u201d his father told him.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the clearest articulations of Martin\u2019s ethos and the theme in all of his work, but especially ASOIAF, of existential heroism. When we talk about Jon as a hero, it\u2019s that which makes him one in the end, not the magical sword or rags to riches; when it comes down to it he does the right thing no matter how much it costs him personally (ASOS) or materially (ADWD). It\u2019s also one of the themes the show completely misses, instead espousing that being honorable makes you stupid.</p><blockquote><p><i>His lord father smiled. \u201cOld Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night\u2019s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran had no answer for that. \u201cKing Robert has a headsman,\u201d he said, uncertainly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe does,\u201d his father admitted. \u201cAs did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man\u2019s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOne day, Bran, you will be Robb\u2019s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>This has been explored more and better in other meta, but the Starks and the north in general has a far more personal view of justice and governing than the south. This isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s better, but it is different. Later as Lord Commander we\u2019ll see just how much of that ethos Jon picked up from Ned: in beheading Janos Slynt, in the mission creep at Hardhome, and in his failure to really use his institutional power to make changes to the Night\u2019s Watch. There\u2019s a strong sense of personal responsibility and connections in northern governance.</p><blockquote><p><i>Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman\u2019s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father\u2019s kennel.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s no freak,\u201d Jon said calmly. \u201cThat\u2019s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Theon Greyjoy said, \u201cThere\u2019s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see one now,\u201d Jon replied.</i></p></blockquote><p>Notice how calm is Jon with Theon here. It\u2019s a bit of a cheap shot at Theon to make us like Jon more as a character, but is also very in line with his character. Very rarely even in later books does Jon react emotionally to things (with a few exceptions like when he tries to murder Alliser Thorne); he tends not to from a place of emotion and almost always takes time to think things through. The reason for this is Jon is calm because he has to be. It\u2019s a result of his marginalized status in the Stark household. There\u2019s no leeway in his bastard position for emotional outbursts: Catelyn isn\u2019t going to put up with that shit, and he\u2019s already enough of an embarrassment to Ned just by existing.</p><p>While we don\u2019t ever really get much thought from either Jon or Theon about their relationship with each other, their interaction in this chapter is I think indicative of it as a whole; slightly adversarial and only cordial because of their mutual friendship with Robb. Theon as a whole is a really interesting foil to Jon; irreverent where Jon is serious, emotional where Jon is calm, dismissive where Jon is willing to learn about others.</p><p>They both have outsider status in the Stark household, but instead of bonding, Theon is significantly closer to Robb. While Jon does have privilege, Theon has more (he is the Greyjoy heir after all) and more importantly, has internalized it far more. It makes sense that aside from just personality differences Theon would think himself above Jon and be drawn to Robb as a source of privilege.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cBorn with the dead,\u201d another man put in. \u201cWorse luck.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo matter,\u201d said Hullen. \u201cThey be dead soon enough too.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe sooner the better,\u201d Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \u201cGive the beast here, Bran.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>In case you had any doubt Theon is in fact the worst, here we have him enthusiastically ready to commit puppy murder.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cLord Stark,\u201d Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. \u201cThere are five pups,\u201d he told Father. \u201cThree male, two female.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat of it, Jon?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou have five trueborn children,\u201d Jon said. \u201cThree sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran saw his father\u2019s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</i></p><p><i>Their father understood as well. \u201cYou want no pup for yourself, Jon?\u201d he asked softly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\u201d Jon pointed out. \u201cI am no Stark, Father.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>I don\u2019t have a lot to say about this passage, but it\u2019s a good example of Jon choosing to do the right thing despite how it won\u2019t benefit him and also show just how much he loves his siblings that he\u2019s willing to do this for them.</p><blockquote><p><i>Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat is it, Jon?\u201d their lord father asked.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan\u2019t you hear it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere,\u201d Jon said.

This is essentially fanfic research, and for that it\u2019s always best to go back to the original source.</p><p>So if this is a Jon and Sansa reread why am I starting with a Bran chapter? Because while on the surface Bran I is about Bran, it\u2019s also equally about introducing the male side of the Starks and so has a lot of valuable insight into Jon\u2019s character. It\u2019s also one of my favorite chapters in the series for just how sparse and laconic Martin\u2019s style is throughout.</p><blockquote><p><i>The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king\u2019s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran\u2019s life.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is such a great hook to open a chapter and the book as a whole with and ticks a lot of important boxes in just a paragraph: the setting, Bran\u2019s age and state of mind, and a good hook. Who is being beheaded? Why is he being beheaded? Why is a child going to go see it? As a writer you almost always want to have an underlying tension or question that the reader wants answered to drive them forwards.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bran\u2019s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \u201cKeep the pony well in hand,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd don\u2019t look away.

Despite his half-brother bastard status Jon is clearly close with Bran, as we\u2019ll see later when he visits Bran\u2019s bedside after he falls. He doesn\u2019t coddle Bran though; partly this is to emphasize the Stark coldness, but also I think it\u2019s an insight into Jon\u2019s character.</p><p>There\u2019s a recurring thread through these early chapters that Jon doesn\u2019t have quite the same leeway as the true born Starks in Winterfell.

His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father\u2019s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.</i></p></blockquote><p>As Ned\u2019s son Jon does exactly this in ADWD when he has to don his own Lord Commander face. While in this chapter we don\u2019t get to see into Ned\u2019s head, in ASOS and ADWD we\u2019ll see just how much it costs Jon to maintain the cold Lord Stark persona both personally and politically when he makes Gilly touch the fire and give up her child, or forces Sam to travel south, or demands child hostages from the Wildlings to cross the Wall.</p><p>Jon\u2019s cold practically is an aspect of his character that doesn\u2019t really get explored much in fanfic, or even really included at all. There\u2019s a couple reasons for it, I think. First, even if they have read the books, the show\u2019s presentation of Jon tends to be what sticks in most people\u2019s heads, and the show has definite habit of softening and whitewashing Jon\u2019s character so he can be the Hero, not to mention Kit Harington\u2019s constantly plaintive look.</p><p>Second, I think a lot of fic writers prefer to have Sansa be the cold hard one (which is also a show invention, but we\u2019ll get into that later) paired with Jon as the emotionally softer one. Which is fair. I love that contrast and dynamic. But I do wish we got a little more examination and exploration of the parallels between how they both got to their Stark face and how they interact now.</p><blockquote><p><i>The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy\u2019s feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. \u201cAss,\u201d Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\u2019s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. \u201cYou did well,\u201d Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.</i></p></blockquote><p>Just in case you were wondering if Theon was a terrible person or not.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe deserter died bravely,\u201d Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\u2019s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \u201cHe had courage, at the least.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon Snow said quietly. \u201cIt was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.\u201d Jon\u2019s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon calling Robb \u201cStark\u201d here is interesting for a couple reasons. Partly this is just Martin trying to set up really quickly for the reader Jon\u2019s bastard status; even Arya, who Jon is closest to, will in her inner narration call him her half-brother quite a bit. But it also signals a kind of a acknowledged formal space between Jon and the other Starklings, even if it\u2019s one they\u2019re used to.</p><blockquote><p><i>Robb was not impressed. \u201cThe Others take his eyes,\u201d he swore. \u201cHe died well. Race you to the bridge?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDone,\u201d Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.</i></p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s a really chilling kind of casualness to the older boys\u2019 reaction to the execution. Even Jon who treats it more seriously than Theon is still able to shift modes easily. Part of this I think is just <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness\" target=\"_blank\">early installment weirdness</a>, but it also nicely shoves the reader into the medieval mindset of westeros in a way that the show never quite achieves. Though it\u2019s underrated, the underlying medieval mindset is one of the key differences between books and show and causes havoc in later seasons as the showrunners have to adjust and soften character to make them more palatable to a modern audience while not changing the underlying actions themselves. It creates a sort of cognitive dissonance and some of the themes logical coherence slip through the crack.</p><p>The contrast between Robb laughing and Jon silent and intent is a great character detail. Robb isn\u2019t taking this as seriously as Jon, because Jon takes everything seriously. He has to. It\u2019s another way his bastard status influences his personality. Robb can lose and he\u2019ll still be lord of Winterfell one day. Jon? Not so much. So this is how Jon treats everything in his life: seriously. It\u2019s a also a bit of a childhood and teenager thing.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bran thought about it. \u201cCan a man still be brave if he\u2019s afraid?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat is the only time a man can be brave,\u201d his father told him.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the clearest articulations of Martin\u2019s ethos and the theme in all of his work, but especially ASOIAF, of existential heroism. When we talk about Jon as a hero, it\u2019s that which makes him one in the end, not the magical sword or rags to riches; when it comes down to it he does the right thing no matter how much it costs him personally (ASOS) or materially (ADWD). It\u2019s also one of the themes the show completely misses, instead espousing that being honorable makes you stupid.</p><blockquote><p><i>His lord father smiled. \u201cOld Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night\u2019s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran had no answer for that. \u201cKing Robert has a headsman,\u201d he said, uncertainly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe does,\u201d his father admitted. \u201cAs did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man\u2019s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOne day, Bran, you will be Robb\u2019s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>This has been explored more and better in other meta, but the Starks and the north in general has a far more personal view of justice and governing than the south. This isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s better, but it is different. Later as Lord Commander we\u2019ll see just how much of that ethos Jon picked up from Ned: in beheading Janos Slynt, in the mission creep at Hardhome, and in his failure to really use his institutional power to make changes to the Night\u2019s Watch. There\u2019s a strong sense of personal responsibility and connections in northern governance.</p><blockquote><p><i>Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman\u2019s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father\u2019s kennel.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s no freak,\u201d Jon said calmly. \u201cThat\u2019s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Theon Greyjoy said, \u201cThere\u2019s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see one now,\u201d Jon replied.</i></p></blockquote><p>Notice how calm is Jon with Theon here. It\u2019s a bit of a cheap shot at Theon to make us like Jon more as a character, but is also very in line with his character. Very rarely even in later books does Jon react emotionally to things (with a few exceptions like when he tries to murder Alliser Thorne); he tends not to from a place of emotion and almost always takes time to think things through. The reason for this is Jon is calm because he has to be. It\u2019s a result of his marginalized status in the Stark household. There\u2019s no leeway in his bastard position for emotional outbursts: Catelyn isn\u2019t going to put up with that shit, and he\u2019s already enough of an embarrassment to Ned just by existing.</p><p>While we don\u2019t ever really get much thought from either Jon or Theon about their relationship with each other, their interaction in this chapter is I think indicative of it as a whole; slightly adversarial and only cordial because of their mutual friendship with Robb. Theon as a whole is a really interesting foil to Jon; irreverent where Jon is serious, emotional where Jon is calm, dismissive where Jon is willing to learn about others.</p><p>They both have outsider status in the Stark household, but instead of bonding, Theon is significantly closer to Robb. While Jon does have privilege, Theon has more (he is the Greyjoy heir after all) and more importantly, has internalized it far more. It makes sense that aside from just personality differences Theon would think himself above Jon and be drawn to Robb as a source of privilege.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cBorn with the dead,\u201d another man put in. \u201cWorse luck.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo matter,\u201d said Hullen. \u201cThey be dead soon enough too.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe sooner the better,\u201d Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \u201cGive the beast here, Bran.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>In case you had any doubt Theon is in fact the worst, here we have him enthusiastically ready to commit puppy murder.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cLord Stark,\u201d Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. \u201cThere are five pups,\u201d he told Father. \u201cThree male, two female.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat of it, Jon?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou have five trueborn children,\u201d Jon said. \u201cThree sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran saw his father\u2019s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</i></p><p><i>Their father understood as well. \u201cYou want no pup for yourself, Jon?\u201d he asked softly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\u201d Jon pointed out. \u201cI am no Stark, Father.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>I don\u2019t have a lot to say about this passage, but it\u2019s a good example of Jon choosing to do the right thing despite how it won\u2019t benefit him and also show just how much he loves his siblings that he\u2019s willing to do this for them.</p><blockquote><p><i>Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat is it, Jon?\u201d their lord father asked.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan\u2019t you hear it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere,\u201d Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe must have crawled away from the others,\u201d Jon said.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOr been driven away,\u201d their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is such a powerful moment to me. Remember that of all the direwolves Ghost never growls or howls or makes any sound at all. And yet Jon hears him somehow. Even though we just met Jon we understand by this point just how left out Jon feels, and here he has a creature that wants him, needs him, loves him. Later when Jon makes the decision to refuse Stannis\u2019 offer of legitimization we\u2019ll see just how much Ghost means to him.</p><p>(I\u2019m not bitter about how the show forgets about Ghost and all the direwolves for long periods. Really. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s fine.)</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAn albino,\u201d Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. \u201cThis one will die even faster than the others.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon Snow gave his father\u2019s ward a long, chilling look. \u201cI think not, Greyjoy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one belongs to me.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cI think not, Greyjoy\u201d is low-key my favorite line of the series as a whole, and I hate that they cut it from the show. Instead Theon says Ghost is the run of the litter and Jon gives Theon a look that\u2019s neither long nor chilling and actually feels more like he\u2019s slightly annoyed that Theon is right. It goes back to the difference of how the show softens Jon and casts him more as the reluctant and slightly dense Hero instead of sharp and smart and slightly vicious at times.</p><p>That\u2019s largely it for Bran I. Overall it\u2019s a really great insight into Jon\u2019s character and his place in the Stark household while also setting up character threads later chapters will pick up. Speaking of, next up will be Jon I, in which Jon gets drunk and talks with Tyrion.

It&rsquo;s a also a bit of a childhood and teenager thing.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bran thought about it. &ldquo;Can a man still be brave if he&rsquo;s afraid?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That is the only time a man can be brave,&rdquo; his father told him.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the clearest articulations of Martin&rsquo;s ethos and the theme in all of his work, but especially ASOIAF, of existential heroism. When we talk about Jon as a hero, it&rsquo;s that which makes him one in the end, not the magical sword or rags to riches; when it comes down to it he does the right thing no matter how much it costs him personally (ASOS) or materially (ADWD). It&rsquo;s also one of the themes the show completely misses, instead espousing that being honorable makes you stupid.</p><blockquote><p><i>His lord father smiled. &ldquo;Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night&rsquo;s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bran had no answer for that. &ldquo;King Robert has a headsman,&rdquo; he said, uncertainly.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He does,&rdquo; his father admitted. &ldquo;As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man&rsquo;s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;One day, Bran, you will be Robb&rsquo;s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>This has been explored more and better in other meta, but the Starks and the north in general has a far more personal view of justice and governing than the south. This isn&rsquo;t to say it&rsquo;s better, but it is different. Later as Lord Commander we&rsquo;ll see just how much of that ethos Jon picked up from Ned: in beheading Janos Slynt, in the mission creep at Hardhome, and in his failure to really use his institutional power to make changes to the Night&rsquo;s Watch. There&rsquo;s a strong sense of personal responsibility and connections in northern governance.</p><blockquote><p><i>Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman&rsquo;s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father&rsquo;s kennel.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no freak,&rdquo; Jon said calmly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Theon Greyjoy said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I see one now,&rdquo; Jon replied.</i></p></blockquote><p>Notice how calm is Jon with Theon here. It&rsquo;s a bit of a cheap shot at Theon to make us like Jon more as a character, but is also very in line with his character. Very rarely even in later books does Jon react emotionally to things (with a few exceptions like when he tries to murder Alliser Thorne); he tends not to from a place of emotion and almost always takes time to think things through. The reason for this is Jon is calm because he has to be. It&rsquo;s a result of his marginalized status in the Stark household. There&rsquo;s no leeway in his bastard position for emotional outbursts: Catelyn isn&rsquo;t going to put up with that shit, and he&rsquo;s already enough of an embarrassment to Ned just by existing.</p><p>While we don&rsquo;t ever really get much thought from either Jon or Theon about their relationship with each other, their interaction in this chapter is I think indicative of it as a whole; slightly adversarial and only cordial because of their mutual friendship with Robb. Theon as a whole is a really interesting foil to Jon; irreverent where Jon is serious, emotional where Jon is calm, dismissive where Jon is willing to learn about others.</p><p>They both have outsider status in the Stark household, but instead of bonding, Theon is significantly closer to Robb. While Jon does have privilege, Theon has more (he is the Greyjoy heir after all) and more importantly, has internalized it far more. It makes sense that aside from just personality differences Theon would think himself above Jon and be drawn to Robb as a source of privilege.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Born with the dead,&rdquo; another man put in. &ldquo;Worse luck.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said Hullen. &ldquo;They be dead soon enough too.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. &ldquo;Give the beast here, Bran.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>In case you had any doubt Theon is in fact the worst, here we have him enthusiastically ready to commit puppy murder.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Lord Stark,&rdquo; Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. &ldquo;There are five pups,&rdquo; he told Father. &ldquo;Three male, two female.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What of it, Jon?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You have five trueborn children,&rdquo; Jon said. &ldquo;Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bran saw his father&rsquo;s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</i></p><p><i>Their father understood as well. &ldquo;You want no pup for yourself, Jon?&rdquo; he asked softly.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,&rdquo; Jon pointed out. &ldquo;I am no Stark, Father.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t have a lot to say about this passage, but it&rsquo;s a good example of Jon choosing to do the right thing despite how it won&rsquo;t benefit him and also show just how much he loves his siblings that he&rsquo;s willing to do this for them.</p><blockquote><p><i>Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What is it, Jon?&rdquo; their lord father asked.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear it?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He must have crawled away from the others,&rdquo; Jon said.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Or been driven away,&rdquo; their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is such a powerful moment to me. Remember that of all the direwolves Ghost never growls or howls or makes any sound at all. And yet Jon hears him somehow. Even though we just met Jon we understand by this point just how left out Jon feels, and here he has a creature that wants him, needs him, loves him. Later when Jon makes the decision to refuse Stannis&rsquo; offer of legitimization we&rsquo;ll see just how much Ghost means to him.</p><p>(I&rsquo;m not bitter about how the show forgets about Ghost and all the direwolves for long periods. Really. It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m fine. It&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m fine. It&rsquo;s fine.)</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;An albino,&rdquo; Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. &ldquo;This one will die even faster than the others.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Jon Snow gave his father&rsquo;s ward a long, chilling look. &ldquo;I think not, Greyjoy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This one belongs to me.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think not, Greyjoy&rdquo; is low-key my favorite line of the series as a whole, and I hate that they cut it from the show. Instead Theon says Ghost is the run of the litter and Jon gives Theon a look that&rsquo;s neither long nor chilling and actually feels more like he&rsquo;s slightly annoyed that Theon is right. It goes back to the difference of how the show softens Jon and casts him more as the reluctant and slightly dense Hero instead of sharp and smart and slightly vicious at times.</p><p>That&rsquo;s largely it for Bran I. Overall it&rsquo;s a really great insight into Jon&rsquo;s character and his place in the Stark household while also setting up character threads later chapters will pick up. Speaking of, next up will be Jon I, in which Jon gets drunk and talks with Tyrion. I&rsquo;m aiming to try and get one of these rereads out a week, so subscribe <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_uEEXSOo2492Y3vnFg9ASw\" target=\"_blank\">@tacitwhisky</a> if you&rsquo;re interested.</p><p><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Next Chapter (Jon I)</a></p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8512c02f026d70557fb93ef2e5ab96d8/tumblr_inline_ptcl89kI6J1wssxfv_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure>\n<p><i>In which Bran sees an execution, talks to Jon, talks to Ned, and then finds some direwolves.</i><br /></p>\n<p>I always love when other people do rereads, so I&rsquo;m trying my hand at it, with a focus on Jon and Sansa and how Martin writes them. This is essentially fanfic research, and for that it&rsquo;s always best to go back to the original source.</p>\n<p>So if this is a Jon and Sansa reread why am I starting with a Bran chapter? Because while on the surface Bran I is about Bran, it&rsquo;s also equally about introducing the male side of the Starks and so has a lot of valuable insight into Jon&rsquo;s character. It&rsquo;s also one of my favorite chapters in the series for just how sparse and laconic Martin&rsquo;s style is throughout.</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king&rsquo;s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran&rsquo;s life.</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>This is such a great hook to open a chapter and the book as a whole with and ticks a lot of important boxes in just a paragraph: the setting, Bran&rsquo;s age and state of mind, and a good hook. Who is being beheaded? Why is he being beheaded? Why is a child going to go see it? As a writer you almost always want to have an underlying tension or question that the reader wants answered to drive them forwards.</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>Bran&rsquo;s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. &ldquo;Keep the pony well in hand,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t look away. Father will know if you do.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s interesting Martin has Jon play the role of older brother here rather than Robb. Despite his half-brother bastard status Jon is clearly close with Bran, as we&rsquo;ll see later when he visits Bran&rsquo;s bedside after he falls. He doesn&rsquo;t coddle Bran though; partly this is to emphasize the Stark coldness, but also I think it&rsquo;s an insight into Jon&rsquo;s character.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a recurring thread through these early chapters that Jon doesn&rsquo;t have quite the same leeway as the true born Starks in Winterfell. He&rsquo;s probably especially sensitive to disappointing Ned. After all, his existence at all is already an embarrassment and spot on Ned&rsquo;s honor.</p>\n</p>",

Preparations for the Great War seemed to be going well but, deep down you knew that they wouldn\u2019t be enough. Even if every man and woman in the north worked for ten years, they would never be enough, the dead were too numerous, to unfeeling, too unstoppable. In the back of your mind you heard their screams, the thundering of their feet against the cave floor and felt the sense of hopelessness crash over you again. You shivered and tucked your hands into the crook of your elbow, squeezing your body tight. You\u2019d think that having spent so many years in the north, growing up in Winterfell and dragging Bran around beyond the wall would have made you accustomed to the cold but it seemed like, as far as your body was concerned, you\u2019d always be a southerner. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get a lot colder in the next few weeks,\u201d Arya Stark commented, appearing beside you like a ghost. </p><p>You jumped, but gave Arya a tired smile and tightened your grip on your stomach, \u201cWell, luckily for me, I\u2019ll probably be dead by then, and I\u2019ve been lead to believe that the cold doesn\u2019t bother zombies.\u201d </p><p>Arya didn\u2019t exactly smile, but her eyes crinkled up at the sides and the edges of her mouth twitched up. She followed your gaze out across the courtyard to where the red leaves of the godswood were just barely visible and you felt, more than heard, her shift her weight uncomfortably. </p><p>\u201cThe last of the wagons are leaving tomorrow. I\u2019ve asked them to save you a spot on one headed to Highgarden, but you have to decide soon.\u201d she said gently. You swallowed hard but didn\u2019t move to meet Arya\u2019s gaze, keeping your eyes locked on the godswood. She sighed and continued, \u201cIt\u2019s been weeks since Meera left, Y/N. If you\u2019re still conflicted-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking to him about it, Arya,\u201d you interrupted, \u201cI already know what he would say.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cHe sent Meera away without so much as a goodbye!\u201d You reminded her, surprising yourself with the intensity of your frustration, \u201cAfter three years, three years of feeding him and protecting him he just-\u201d you broke off and shook your head, blinking back tears, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could handle him treating me that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not Meera Reed,\u201d Arya insisted, gripping your forearm and forcing you to turn to face her, \u201cyou\u2019re Y/N Y/L/N, you grew up with us, we\u2019ve known you since we were children.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt does!\u201d she corrected, \u201cY/N, Bran-he-\u201d she paused, \u201cnothing is certain right now. As you said, we could all be dead in the next few weeks. You can\u2019t leave without telling Bran, not now. Give him a chance to prove you wrong, or you\u2019ll regret it for the rest of your life.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not Bran anymore, Arya.\u201d you said softly, your voice breaking. </p><p>\u201cYes he is,\u201d she replied gently, \u201cfor you, he is.\u201d </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; </p><p>As you made your way through the courtyard, you tried to pretend that your heart wasn\u2019t pounding in your chest. You felt as though everyone was staring at you, like they knew what you were about to do and thought you were an idiot for even trying. Part of you agreed with them of course. After all, you\u2019d been the one who had to listen to Meera and help her find her way home. </p><p><i>\u201cMeera I\u2019m sure Bran didn\u2019t-\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you, Y/N? He\u2019s not Bran anymore! He\u2019s the three eyed raven, and surprise surprise, the three eyed raven doesn\u2019t give a shitt about you or me.\u201d Meera fumed as she shoved her few possessions into a bag. </i></p><p><i>You pressed your lips together, unsure how to navigate the situation at hand. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe if I just go and talk to him about it-\u201d you tried, your voice fading off as you realised that you had know idea what to do. </i></p><p><i>Meera rolled her eyes but replied, not unkindly, \u201cYou think he loves you, don\u2019t you? Or maybe you hope he does?\u201d You blushed bright red but didn\u2019t contradict her, which Meera took as a sign of agreement, \u201cWell, if he ever loved you back, I think those days are gone Y/N/N. I\u2019m sorry, truly I am, but I can\u2019t stay here.\u201d </i></p><p>You blinked back into reality, the unpleasant memory leaving a bitter taste in your mouth. Meera was your friend, you\u2019d survived so much together and seeing her leave the way she did had broken your heart. You wanted to be angry on her behalf, you really did. You wanted to rage and scream and storm out of Winterfell and never look back. You wanted to make Bran feel the hurt he\u2019d caused her. Or at least you <i>wanted</i> to want that. In reality, you just wanted Bran. </p><p>The smell of smoke from the forges burnt your nose as you inhaled and you were reminded again of how much everything had changed. Winterfell barely resembled the castle you\u2019d grown up in, now everything was harsh and sharp, ready for battle, ready for death. In a morbid sort of way, it was just like you. You suddenly had a sharp pang of longing for your childhood, for the easy days when you and Bran would chase one another through the passageways, play knights and kings in the godswood and clamber up onto the ramparts. Everything had been so beautiful then and, up until now, you\u2019d never truly understood how far behind you those days were, how irretrievable. Bran had known, you thought to yourself, he\u2019d known for years. </p><p><i>The firelight danced off the darkened trees, casting terrifying long shadows that you tried to avoid seeing. Everything beyond the wall felt strange and alien, but some small part of you still thrummed with excitement. No one in your family had ever gone this far north and, no matter what else may happen, you were with Bran. For a rare moment, everything seemed peaceful. Hodor was warming his hands, Meera was out hunting and Jojen seemed to be feeling stronger. Only Bran seemed discontent. He\u2019d been avoiding you for days now, ever since the run in you\u2019d had with a pack of wolves. Summer had scared them off well enough, but not before you\u2019d gotten a nasty scratch and made a fool of yourself by sobbing like a little girl over it. Part of you wondered if you\u2019d simply lost his respect, another part thought that maybe you\u2019d never had it in the first place. Suddenly, Bran looked directly at you and your heart fluttered in your chest as he met your eye, smiled sadly at you from across the fire and gestured for you to join him. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d you asked, trying to hide your excitement and passing him a skin to drink from. </i></p><p><i>Bran was silent for a long moment, giving you time to trace his face with your eyes, drinking in every dip and curve like a person dying of thirst looking at the last river in the world. Something was wrong and you knew it, something was weighing heavily on Bran\u2019s mind. He was beautiful; dark and handsome with a smile that made you feel like your stomach had turned to molten lava whenever it graced his face. But now his face was sad and drawn, as though he\u2019d seen too much which, you supposed, was accurate enough. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI miss home,\u201d Bran finally said, his voice small, \u201cI miss Winterfell.\u201d </i></p><p><i>For a moment he sounded young again, like the boy who had fallen from a high tower, and your heart pinched with concern. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI do too,\u201d you admitted, \u201cbut we\u2019ll see it again someday. Once we\u2019ve found the three eyed raven and fulfilled your destiny, we can go home and start again. We\u2019ll take back Winterfell and reclaim the North, and everything can go back to how it was.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Bran looked at you, something welling in his eyes that hovered between pity and awe. It made your skin tingle, like lightning was about to strike or a storm was about to break. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou really believe that, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, staring like you were a puzzle he enjoyed trying to crack, \u201cYou believe that everything is going to be alright in the end, that we can go back and start over?\u201d </i></p><p><i>The weight of his gaze made you want to look away, but you didn\u2019t. You held your head up and shrugged with one shoulder, answering, \u201cI have to. Every morning that I wake up cold and hungry or afraid, I have to believe that the next morning will be better, that all this suffering isn\u2019t for nothing.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Bran nodded thoughtfully, his eyes becoming sad and pained as he turned back to the fire, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked you to come.\u201d </i></p><p><i> You rolled your eyes affectionately, having had this conversation countless times over the years, \u201cBran-\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI put you in danger Y/N! I put your life at risk all so that -\u201d he broke off quickly. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAll so that what, Bran?\u201d you asked, feeling yourself hit the same wall he threw up every time this fight started, \u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t have been safe at Winterfell, and I begged to be allowed to come with you.\u201d You reminded him. Bran pressed his lips together but didn\u2019t answer. Your chest pinched and you forced down your frustration, leaning forward to hold his forearm and willed him to face you again, \u201cYou really think, after all the years I\u2019ve known you, I would\u2019ve just let you and Rickon disappear into the wilderness without me?\u201d you asked, covering his hand with your own, \u201cOr that Theon would\u2019ve just let me go home after he found out that you\u2019d gotten away? We\u2019ve been over this so many times now Bran, all so <b>what</b>?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cAll so that I wouldn\u2019t have to say goodbye to you!\u201d he blurted out, his dark eyes flicking up to meet yours for a second before flicking back to the ground, \u201cI was being selfish, and now you\u2019re stuck out here, hundreds of miles away from everything you\u2019ve ever known, surrounded by danger with no one but a cripple who can\u2019t even protect himself, let alone protect you.\u201d Bran continued, words pouring from his mouth like an opened floodgate. You felt something bloom in the silence, a kind of tension that made you oddly breathless, He stared down at your hands and slowly swiped his thumb over your fingers, sending a shiver down your spine and igniting a warmth from everywhere your skin touched, \u201cI should be sorry,\u201d he continued softly, his voice barely more than a whisper, \u201cthat\u2019s all I\u2019ve been doing these past few days, trying to be sorry. When I saw you surrounded by those wolves, I was. I would&rsquo;ve given anything to send you far away and know that you were safe, but now,\u201d he said, squeezing your hands in his and shaking his head incredulously, \u201cnow I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re with me.\u201d You swallowed hard and opened your mouth, willing yourself to say something, anything, but nothing came out. This time, when Bran smiled, it was sweet and fond and, when he brought your hands up and brushed his lips against your fingers, he held your gaze, \u201cSee? I told you I was selfish.\u201d</i></p><p>You shook your head and let out a shaky breath, the memory of Bran\u2019s smile swimming before your eyes as you stepped into the godswood. You found him exactly where you thought you would, beneath the sprawling weirwood, staring into the distance. The sight of him still made something in your chest leap and ache, but you pushed it aside. At the end of the day, you were here for a reason. You didn\u2019t announce yourself and he didn\u2019t acknowledge you. </p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cThe night king has made it past the wall,\u201d Bran said, as though he was commenting on the weather, \u201chis army will be here soon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I heard,\u201d you responded. The silence that followed felt, to you, like every single word, every gesture and touch that had ever passed between you and Bran, every lost chance, and it nearly brought you to tears. You sniffed and wiped your face, hardening your resolve and forcing your emotions down. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to see you,\u201d he said pleasantly, \u201cit\u2019s been a long time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been packing,\u201d you explained, \u201cI\u2019m going south. Tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>That got his attention. In no time at all the faraway look vanished from Bran\u2019s face and he met your gaze head on, with more presence than he\u2019d had in weeks. Some small part of you was pleased by his hurt expression, pleased to see any reaction at all really, but it was drowned out by the breaking of your heart because now it was <i>him, Bran Stark</i>, the man you\u2019d been in love with for nearly a decade. He was right there and gods had you missed him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d he asked, shocked. </p><p>\u201cFirst thing tomorrow,\u201d you answered and then, vindictively, \u201cI thought you would have known that already.\u201d. </p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t leave, not now.\u201d Bran replied, his voice coloured by something that felt a lot like hurt, \u201cY/N please-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a reason not to,\u201d you replied, horrified at the note of pleading in your voice, \u201cI don\u2019t want to-\u201d, You swallowed hard, \u201cgive me one good reason and I swear I\u2019ll stay.\u201d </p><p>Bran stammered, his dark eyes wide with shock and pain, \u201cI still need you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d You laughed as you begun to lose your battle with your tears, \u201cstand around like a good little servant while you sit in silence and stare at nothing? Take up space until you send me away like Meera?\u201d </p><p>Bran frowned, \u201cI could <i>never</i> send you away, Y/N, you know that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d you asked desperately, years of emotion coming to a head, \u201cWhy could you never send me away? Why am I still here even though our quest is over? <i>Why</i> were you never sorry? Why me, Bran? Why should I stay here and die with you rather than go south and die with my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you,\u201d he answered, equally passionately, \u201cI love you Y/N and I know, I <i>know</i> you love me too.\u201d </p><p>Whatever shock you may have felt was lost in the veritable tidal wave of conflicting emotions that were tearing you up. You wanted to laugh, to cry, to scream and rage and throw yourself into Bran\u2019s arms. A million thoughts and none at all rushed through your mind but, eventually, all you said was,</p><p>\u201cYou knew. You\u2019ve known this whole time and you never-\u201d you broke off, pressing the heel of your hand to your forehead as a hot tear rolled down your cheek. </p><p>Bran\u2019s eyes widened and he leaned forward, as if to touch you, before realising his mistake and sitting back. </p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d he said quickly, \u201cI only saw it a few months ago. I wanted to say something, I did but-\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d you finished, \u201cit never mattered, you said it yourself. You\u2019re the three eyed raven now, you belong to the realm. Gods, I\u2019m such an idiot\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, I will always love you,\u201d Bran promised, taking your hand in his, \u201cif it was any other time, any other threat I would tell you to go, to find someone who deserves you, but I need you now. I can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d </p><p>You looked away, knowing that his earnest, open look would break you. Everything inside of you felt raw and tender, like an exposed nerve. You felt naked and vulnerable, like Bran could see into your very soul. <i>He loves you</i>, a small voice in the back of your mind whispered,<i> he loves you, he loves you, he loves you.</i> You should\u2019ve been happy. You should\u2019ve been jumping with joy, but instead Bran\u2019s confession did nothing but make you feel even more alone. </p><p>You shook your head, \u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d you said, sadly, \u201cI wish it was. I want it to be a good enough reason, but it isn\u2019t.\u201d You looked back at Bran, hoping he could see the sincerity in your eyes, \u201cCan you promise me, right now, that the night king will win?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he responded, \u201cwe could beat him. I think we will.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen this isn\u2019t the end,\u201d you said, kneeling in front of Bran\u2019s wheelchair, \u201cI love you, Brandon Stark, I really do, I have since we were children, but I can\u2019t spend my life waiting for you to be able to love me back. I don\u2019t know what being the three eyed raven means for you, what you\u2019re capable of doing, of being, but I know that, if I stay here, I\u2019m condemning myself to a life of hoping for a future that may never even be possible.\u201d </p><p>Tears welled up in Bran\u2019s eyes, pouring over his cheeks like liquid diamonds. He squeezed your hand tight, swiping his thumb across your fingers, just like he\u2019d done that night next to the fire. </p><p>\u201cY/N I-\u201d </p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d you said, through your own tears, \u201cI need to say this. I deserve to be happy. I deserve love, and peace and comfort and a man who wants to be with me-\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>I</i> want to be with you,\u201d Bran interrupted, \u201cbut I can\u2019t give you a family, I could never be a true husband, I-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t <i>need</i> children, Bran,\u201d you continued, \u201cwhat I need is a partnership. I need you to be as committed to me as you are to being the three eyed raven and you can\u2019t do that, not now at least.\u201d You explained. You paused, willing him to contradict you, but he didn\u2019t. You sighed inwardly but pressed on, \u201cI need to leave. I need to find out who I am without you but, if we survive, if somehow we defeat the night king and Cersei and whatever else comes up, and find a way to live in peace&hellip;if that happens and you still love me, if that happens and you can be the man I think you still are, come and find me. I\u2019ll be in Highgarden with my family.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re in love with someone else?\u201d Bran asked quietly. </p><p>For the first time you openly traced his face with your eyes, every dip and curve, committing each to memory, as though this was the last time you would ever see them and, slowly, you leant in and pressed your lips to Bran\u2019s. The kiss was sweet and chaste, and filled you with something that felt like sunlight and tasted like spring and you thought, maybe, this could be enough. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be,\u201d You promised when you broke apart. </p><p>Bran looked at you with wonder, his dark eyes heavy with love and loss and pain, but also acceptance. He brought your hand to his lips and kissed your fingers. </p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll be safe,\u201d he eventually said, \u201cso that I can find you when this is over.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d </p><p>Bran nodded and cupped your face with his hand, \u201cI love you Y/N Y/L/N, I always will.\u201d </p><p>You smiled sadly and stood, letting his hand fall back into his lap, \u201cI love you too. Good luck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back for you someday, Y/N. I swear it by the old gods and the new.\u201d </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- </p><p>The days were shorter now, and snow had begun to fall in Highgarden, carpeting the grounds in white as you strolled through the garden. Your family had a new liege lord apparently, Ser Bron, and, according to your father, you had a new king too. You had been home for a few months now and, while the memories of Bran had stopped aching, he was never far from your mind. It had been horrible at first. You\u2019d wept yourself to sleep for weeks, cursing yourself for leaving, cursing him for staying, cursing the gods for making both necessary. Now, though, things were better. The kingdom was finally at peace, the night king was gone and life had regained a tenuous feeling of normality. You were yourself again, without fear or pain for the first time in years and it felt\u2026&hellip;right. \u00a0</p><p>King Brandon, first of his name. You smiled to yourself, it was still so strange to think about. He would be a good king, moderate and calculated, with no desire for power and a real connection with the people of the seven (you mean six) kingdoms. Your heart still ached for him, but you knew you\u2019d made the right decision in the end. If everything really was connected, then your leaving had to happen and, if you could go back, you would do it all again. </p><p>Somewhere nearby, a raven croaked, familiar and calming, and the sound of an opening door and footsteps caught your ear. </p><p>\u201cY/N, come inside!\u201d Your father called. </p><p>You frowned but followed his instructions, shrugging off your thick cloak and brushing the snow from your hair as you made your way to the main hall. </p><p>\u201cFather?\u201d you questioned, \u201cFather, what is it? Is something the matter? I heard the door open, is someone here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust an old friend,\u201d a familiar voice answered from behind you. </p><p>Your heart stopped and, for a long moment, you were too afraid to turn around, in case there was nothing there and you\u2019d simply imagined it all but, eventually you turned, and let out a sound that was halfway between a whimper and a sob. Without a second thought you threw yourself at Bran, collapsing onto your knees ad wrapping your arms around his neck to pull him close. </p><p>He laughed gently into your ear and hugged you back, burying his face in your hair, his lips just barely brushing the skin of your neck. </p><p>\u201cYou came,\u201d you laugh-cried, \u201cyou really came.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d he responded fondly, \u201cI promised you I would.\u201d </p><p>You smiled as you pulled away from the hug, wiping the tears of happiness from your cheeks and standing. </p><p>\u201cWhere are my manners?\u201d you said jokingly, dipping into a deep curtsey, \u201cYour Grace.\u201d </p><p>Bran snorted and smirked back at you, more relaxed and happy than you\u2019d seen him in years. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not used to that,\u201d he admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be used to that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d you assured him, \u201cafter all, you are the king.\u201d </p><p>Bran looked up at you and, for the first time, he looked unsure. </p><p>\u201cCould you love a king?\u201d he asked and, at that moment, you realised what he was asking. </p><p><i>Could you love me like this? Could you love a man who\u2019s married to the realm? Could you love a man who would make you queen, but never give you children? Who hurt you and neglected you out of fear? Who let you walk away? Could you love <b>me</b>? </i>You heard him and you smiled. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you answered honestly, \u201cYes, I rather think I could.\u201d</p>",

As you said, we could all be dead in the next few weeks. You can\u2019t leave without telling Bran, not now. Give him a chance to prove you wrong, or you\u2019ll regret it for the rest of your life.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not Bran anymore, Arya.\u201d you said softly, your voice breaking. </p><p>\u201cYes he is,\u201d she replied gently, \u201cfor you, he is.\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 </p><p>As you made your way through the courtyard, you tried to pretend that your heart wasn\u2019t pounding in your chest. You felt as though everyone was staring at you, like they knew what you were about to do and thought you were an idiot for even trying. Part of you agreed with them of course. After all, you\u2019d been the one who had to listen to Meera and help her find her way home. </p><p><i>\u201cMeera I\u2019m sure Bran didn\u2019t-\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you, Y/N? He\u2019s not Bran anymore! He\u2019s the three eyed raven, and surprise surprise, the three eyed raven doesn\u2019t give a shitt about you or me.\u201d Meera fumed as she shoved her few possessions into a bag. </i></p><p><i>You pressed your lips together, unsure how to navigate the situation at hand. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe if I just go and talk to him about it-\u201d you tried, your voice fading off as you realised that you had know idea what to do. </i></p><p><i>Meera rolled her eyes but replied, not unkindly, \u201cYou think he loves you, don\u2019t you? Or maybe you hope he does?\u201d You blushed bright red but didn\u2019t contradict her, which Meera took as a sign of agreement, \u201cWell, if he ever loved you back, I think those days are gone Y/N/N. I\u2019m sorry, truly I am, but I can\u2019t stay here.\u201d </i></p><p>You blinked back into reality, the unpleasant memory leaving a bitter taste in your mouth. Meera was your friend, you\u2019d survived so much together and seeing her leave the way she did had broken your heart. You wanted to be angry on her behalf, you really did. You wanted to rage and scream and storm out of Winterfell and never look back. You wanted to make Bran feel the hurt he\u2019d caused her. Or at least you <i>wanted</i> to want that. In reality, you just wanted Bran. </p><p>The smell of smoke from the forges burnt your nose as you inhaled and you were reminded again of how much everything had changed. Winterfell barely resembled the castle you\u2019d grown up in, now everything was harsh and sharp, ready for battle, ready for death. In a morbid sort of way, it was just like you. You suddenly had a sharp pang of longing for your childhood, for the easy days when you and Bran would chase one another through the passageways, play knights and kings in the godswood and clamber up onto the ramparts. Everything had been so beautiful then and, up until now, you\u2019d never truly understood how far behind you those days were, how irretrievable. Bran had known, you thought to yourself, he\u2019d known for years. </p><p><i>The firelight danced off the darkened trees, casting terrifying long shadows that you tried to avoid seeing. Everything beyond the wall felt strange and alien, but some small part of you still thrummed with excitement. No one in your family had ever gone this far north and, no matter what else may happen, you were with Bran. For a rare moment, everything seemed peaceful. Hodor was warming his hands, Meera was out hunting and Jojen seemed to be feeling stronger. Only Bran seemed discontent. He\u2019d been avoiding you for days now, ever since the run in you\u2019d had with a pack of wolves. Summer had scared them off well enough, but not before you\u2019d gotten a nasty scratch and made a fool of yourself by sobbing like a little girl over it. Part of you wondered if you\u2019d simply lost his respect, another part thought that maybe you\u2019d never had it in the first place. Suddenly, Bran looked directly at you and your heart fluttered in your chest as he met your eye, smiled sadly at you from across the fire and gestured for you to join him. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d you asked, trying to hide your excitement and passing him a skin to drink from. </i></p><p><i>Bran was silent for a long moment, giving you time to trace his face with your eyes, drinking in every dip and curve like a person dying of thirst looking at the last river in the world. Something was wrong and you knew it, something was weighing heavily on Bran\u2019s mind. He was beautiful; dark and handsome with a smile that made you feel like your stomach had turned to molten lava whenever it graced his face. But now his face was sad and drawn, as though he\u2019d seen too much which, you supposed, was accurate enough. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI miss home,\u201d Bran finally said, his voice small, \u201cI miss Winterfell.\u201d </i></p><p><i>For a moment he sounded young again, like the boy who had fallen from a high tower, and your heart pinched with concern. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI do too,\u201d you admitted, \u201cbut we\u2019ll see it again someday. Once we\u2019ve found the three eyed raven and fulfilled your destiny, we can go home and start again. We\u2019ll take back Winterfell and reclaim the North, and everything can go back to how it was.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Bran looked at you, something welling in his eyes that hovered between pity and awe. It made your skin tingle, like lightning was about to strike or a storm was about to break. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou really believe that, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, staring like you were a puzzle he enjoyed trying to crack, \u201cYou believe that everything is going to be alright in the end, that we can go back and start over?\u201d </i></p><p><i>The weight of his gaze made you want to look away, but you didn\u2019t. You held your head up and shrugged with one shoulder, answering, \u201cI have to. Every morning that I wake up cold and hungry or afraid, I have to believe that the next morning will be better, that all this suffering isn\u2019t for nothing.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Bran nodded thoughtfully, his eyes becoming sad and pained as he turned back to the fire, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked you to come.\u201d </i></p><p><i> You rolled your eyes affectionately, having had this conversation countless times over the years, \u201cBran-\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI put you in danger Y/N! I put your life at risk all so that -\u201d he broke off quickly. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAll so that what, Bran?\u201d you asked, feeling yourself hit the same wall he threw up every time this fight started, \u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t have been safe at Winterfell, and I begged to be allowed to come with you.\u201d You reminded him. Bran pressed his lips together but didn\u2019t answer. Your chest pinched and you forced down your frustration, leaning forward to hold his forearm and willed him to face you again, \u201cYou really think, after all the years I\u2019ve known you, I would\u2019ve just let you and Rickon disappear into the wilderness without me?\u201d you asked, covering his hand with your own, \u201cOr that Theon would\u2019ve just let me go home after he found out that you\u2019d gotten away? We\u2019ve been over this so many times now Bran, all so <b>what</b>?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cAll so that I wouldn\u2019t have to say goodbye to you!\u201d he blurted out, his dark eyes flicking up to meet yours for a second before flicking back to the ground, \u201cI was being selfish, and now you\u2019re stuck out here, hundreds of miles away from everything you\u2019ve ever known, surrounded by danger with no one but a cripple who can\u2019t even protect himself, let alone protect you.\u201d Bran continued, words pouring from his mouth like an opened floodgate. You felt something bloom in the silence, a kind of tension that made you oddly breathless, He stared down at your hands and slowly swiped his thumb over your fingers, sending a shiver down your spine and igniting a warmth from everywhere your skin touched, \u201cI should be sorry,\u201d he continued softly, his voice barely more than a whisper, \u201cthat\u2019s all I\u2019ve been doing these past few days, trying to be sorry. When I saw you surrounded by those wolves, I was. I would\u2019ve given anything to send you far away and know that you were safe, but now,\u201d he said, squeezing your hands in his and shaking his head incredulously, \u201cnow I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re with me.\u201d You swallowed hard and opened your mouth, willing yourself to say something, anything, but nothing came out. This time, when Bran smiled, it was sweet and fond and, when he brought your hands up and brushed his lips against your fingers, he held your gaze, \u201cSee? I told you I was selfish.\u201d</i></p><p>You shook your head and let out a shaky breath, the memory of Bran\u2019s smile swimming before your eyes as you stepped into the godswood. You found him exactly where you thought you would, beneath the sprawling weirwood, staring into the distance. The sight of him still made something in your chest leap and ache, but you pushed it aside. At the end of the day, you were here for a reason. You didn\u2019t announce yourself and he didn\u2019t acknowledge you. </p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cThe night king has made it past the wall,\u201d Bran said, as though he was commenting on the weather, \u201chis army will be here soon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I heard,\u201d you responded. The silence that followed felt, to you, like every single word, every gesture and touch that had ever passed between you and Bran, every lost chance, and it nearly brought you to tears. You sniffed and wiped your face, hardening your resolve and forcing your emotions down. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to see you,\u201d he said pleasantly, \u201cit\u2019s been a long time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been packing,\u201d you explained, \u201cI\u2019m going south. Tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>That got his attention. In no time at all the faraway look vanished from Bran\u2019s face and he met your gaze head on, with more presence than he\u2019d had in weeks. Some small part of you was pleased by his hurt expression, pleased to see any reaction at all really, but it was drowned out by the breaking of your heart because now it was <i>him, Bran Stark</i>, the man you\u2019d been in love with for nearly a decade. He was right there and gods had you missed him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d he asked, shocked. </p><p>\u201cFirst thing tomorrow,\u201d you answered and then, vindictively, \u201cI thought you would have known that already.\u201d. </p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t leave, not now.\u201d Bran replied, his voice coloured by something that felt a lot like hurt, \u201cY/N please-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a reason not to,\u201d you replied, horrified at the note of pleading in your voice, \u201cI don\u2019t want to-\u201d, You swallowed hard, \u201cgive me one good reason and I swear I\u2019ll stay.\u201d </p><p>Bran stammered, his dark eyes wide with shock and pain, \u201cI still need you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d You laughed as you begun to lose your battle with your tears, \u201cstand around like a good little servant while you sit in silence and stare at nothing? Take up space until you send me away like Meera?\u201d </p><p>Bran frowned, \u201cI could <i>never</i> send you away, Y/N, you know that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d you asked desperately, years of emotion coming to a head, \u201cWhy could you never send me away? Why am I still here even though our quest is over? <i>Why</i> were you never sorry? Why me, Bran? Why should I stay here and die with you rather than go south and die with my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you,\u201d he answered, equally passionately, \u201cI love you Y/N and I know, I <i>know</i> you love me too.\u201d </p><p>Whatever shock you may have felt was lost in the veritable tidal wave of conflicting emotions that were tearing you up. You wanted to laugh, to cry, to scream and rage and throw yourself into Bran\u2019s arms. A million thoughts and none at all rushed through your mind but, eventually, all you said was,</p><p>\u201cYou knew. You\u2019ve known this whole time and you never-\u201d you broke off, pressing the heel of your hand to your forehead as a hot tear rolled down your cheek. </p><p>Bran\u2019s eyes widened and he leaned forward, as if to touch you, before realising his mistake and sitting back. </p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d he said quickly, \u201cI only saw it a few months ago. I wanted to say something, I did but-\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d you finished, \u201cit never mattered, you said it yourself. You\u2019re the three eyed raven now, you belong to the realm. Gods, I\u2019m such an idiot\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, I will always love you,\u201d Bran promised, taking your hand in his, \u201cif it was any other time, any other threat I would tell you to go, to find someone who deserves you, but I need you now. I can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d </p><p>You looked away, knowing that his earnest, open look would break you. Everything inside of you felt raw and tender, like an exposed nerve. You felt naked and vulnerable, like Bran could see into your very soul. <i>He loves you</i>, a small voice in the back of your mind whispered,<i> he loves you, he loves you, he loves you.</i> You should\u2019ve been happy. You should\u2019ve been jumping with joy, but instead Bran\u2019s confession did nothing but make you feel even more alone. </p><p>You shook your head, \u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d you said, sadly, \u201cI wish it was. I want it to be a good enough reason, but it isn\u2019t.\u201d You looked back at Bran, hoping he could see the sincerity in your eyes, \u201cCan you promise me, right now, that the night king will win?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he responded, \u201cwe could beat him. I think we will.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen this isn\u2019t the end,\u201d you said, kneeling in front of Bran\u2019s wheelchair, \u201cI love you, Brandon Stark, I really do, I have since we were children, but I can\u2019t spend my life waiting for you to be able to love me back. I don\u2019t know what being the three eyed raven means for you, what you\u2019re capable of doing, of being, but I know that, if I stay here, I\u2019m condemning myself to a life of hoping for a future that may never even be possible.\u201d </p><p>Tears welled up in Bran\u2019s eyes, pouring over his cheeks like liquid diamonds. He squeezed your hand tight, swiping his thumb across your fingers, just like he\u2019d done that night next to the fire. </p><p>\u201cY/N I-\u201d </p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d you said, through your own tears, \u201cI need to say this. I deserve to be happy. I deserve love, and peace and comfort and a man who wants to be with me-\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>I</i> want to be with you,\u201d Bran interrupted, \u201cbut I can\u2019t give you a family, I could never be a true husband, I-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t <i>need</i> children, Bran,\u201d you continued, \u201cwhat I need is a partnership. I need you to be as committed to me as you are to being the three eyed raven and you can\u2019t do that, not now at least.\u201d You explained. You paused, willing him to contradict you, but he didn\u2019t. You sighed inwardly but pressed on, \u201cI need to leave. I need to find out who I am without you but, if we survive, if somehow we defeat the night king and Cersei and whatever else comes up, and find a way to live in peace\u2026if that happens and you still love me, if that happens and you can be the man I think you still are, come and find me. I\u2019ll be in Highgarden with my family.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re in love with someone else?\u201d Bran asked quietly. </p><p>For the first time you openly traced his face with your eyes, every dip and curve, committing each to memory, as though this was the last time you would ever see them and, slowly, you leant in and pressed your lips to Bran\u2019s. The kiss was sweet and chaste, and filled you with something that felt like sunlight and tasted like spring and you thought, maybe, this could be enough. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be,\u201d You promised when you broke apart. </p><p>Bran looked at you with wonder, his dark eyes heavy with love and loss and pain, but also acceptance. He brought your hand to his lips and kissed your fingers. </p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll be safe,\u201d he eventually said, \u201cso that I can find you when this is over.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d </p><p>Bran nodded and cupped your face with his hand, \u201cI love you Y/N Y/L/N, I always will.\u201d </p><p>You smiled sadly and stood, letting his hand fall back into his lap, \u201cI love you too. Good luck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back for you someday, Y/N. I swear it by the old gods and the new.\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- </p><p>The days were shorter now, and snow had begun to fall in Highgarden, carpeting the grounds in white as you strolled through the garden. Your family had a new liege lord apparently, Ser Bron, and, according to your father, you had a new king too. You had been home for a few months now and, while the memories of Bran had stopped aching, he was never far from your mind. It had been horrible at first. You\u2019d wept yourself to sleep for weeks, cursing yourself for leaving, cursing him for staying, cursing the gods for making both necessary. Now, though, things were better. The kingdom was finally at peace, the night king was gone and life had regained a tenuous feeling of normality. You were yourself again, without fear or pain for the first time in years and it felt\u2026\u2026right. \u00a0</p><p>King Brandon, first of his name. You smiled to yourself, it was still so strange to think about. He would be a good king, moderate and calculated, with no desire for power and a real connection with the people of the seven (you mean six) kingdoms. Your heart still ached for him, but you knew you\u2019d made the right decision in the end. If everything really was connected, then your leaving had to happen and, if you could go back, you would do it all again. </p><p>Somewhere nearby, a raven croaked, familiar and calming, and the sound of an opening door and footsteps caught your ear. </p><p>\u201cY/N, come inside!\u201d Your father called. </p><p>You frowned but followed his instructions, shrugging off your thick cloak and brushing the snow from your hair as you made your way to the main hall. </p><p>\u201cFather?\u201d you questioned, \u201cFather, what is it? Is something the matter? I heard the door open, is someone here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust an old friend,\u201d a familiar voice answered from behind you. </p><p>Your heart stopped and, for a long moment, you were too afraid to turn around, in case there was nothing there and you\u2019d simply imagined it all but, eventually you turned, and let out a sound that was halfway between a whimper and a sob. Without a second thought you threw yourself at Bran, collapsing onto your knees ad wrapping your arms around his neck to pull him close. </p><p>He laughed gently into your ear and hugged you back, burying his face in your hair, his lips just barely brushing the skin of your neck. </p><p>\u201cYou came,\u201d you laugh-cried, \u201cyou really came.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d he responded fondly, \u201cI promised you I would.\u201d </p><p>You smiled as you pulled away from the hug, wiping the tears of happiness from your cheeks and standing. </p><p>\u201cWhere are my manners?\u201d you said jokingly, dipping into a deep curtsey, \u201cYour Grace.\u201d </p><p>Bran snorted and smirked back at you, more relaxed and happy than you\u2019d seen him in years. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not used to that,\u201d he admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be used to that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d you assured him, \u201cafter all, you are the king.\u201d </p><p>Bran looked up at you and, for the first time, he looked unsure. </p><p>\u201cCould you love a king?\u201d he asked and, at that moment, you realised what he was asking. </p><p><i>Could you love me like this? Could you love a man who\u2019s married to the realm? Could you love a man who would make you queen, but never give you children? Who hurt you and neglected you out of fear? Who let you walk away? Could you love <b>me</b>? </i>You heard him and you smiled. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you answered honestly, \u201cYes, I rather think I could.\u201d</p></p>",

Preparations for the Great War seemed to be going well but, deep down you knew that they wouldn\u2019t be enough. Even if every man and woman in the north worked for ten years, they would never be enough, the dead were too numerous, to unfeeling, too unstoppable. In the back of your mind you heard their screams, the thundering of their feet against the cave floor and felt the sense of hopelessness crash over you again. You shivered and tucked your hands into the crook of your elbow, squeezing your body tight. You\u2019d think that having spent so many years in the north, growing up in Winterfell and dragging Bran around beyond the wall would have made you accustomed to the cold but it seemed like, as far as your body was concerned, you\u2019d always be a southerner. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get a lot colder in the next few weeks,\u201d Arya Stark commented, appearing beside you like a ghost. </p><p>You jumped, but gave Arya a tired smile and tightened your grip on your stomach, \u201cWell, luckily for me, I\u2019ll probably be dead by then, and I\u2019ve been lead to believe that the cold doesn\u2019t bother zombies.\u201d </p><p>Arya didn\u2019t exactly smile, but her eyes crinkled up at the sides and the edges of her mouth twitched up. She followed your gaze out across the courtyard to where the red leaves of the godswood were just barely visible and you felt, more than heard, her shift her weight uncomfortably. </p><p>\u201cThe last of the wagons are leaving tomorrow. I\u2019ve asked them to save you a spot on one headed to Highgarden, but you have to decide soon.\u201d she said gently. You swallowed hard but didn\u2019t move to meet Arya\u2019s gaze, keeping your eyes locked on the godswood. She sighed and continued, \u201cIt\u2019s been weeks since Meera left, Y/N. If you\u2019re still conflicted-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking to him about it, Arya,\u201d you interrupted, \u201cI already know what he would say.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cHe sent Meera away without so much as a goodbye!\u201d You reminded her, surprising yourself with the intensity of your frustration, \u201cAfter three years, three years of feeding him and protecting him he just-\u201d you broke off and shook your head, blinking back tears, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could handle him treating me that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not Meera Reed,\u201d Arya insisted, gripping your forearm and forcing you to turn to face her, \u201cyou\u2019re Y/N Y/L/N, you grew up with us, we\u2019ve known you since we were children.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt does!\u201d she corrected, \u201cY/N, Bran-he-\u201d she paused, \u201cnothing is certain right now. As you said, we could all be dead in the next few weeks. You can\u2019t leave without telling Bran, not now. Give him a chance to prove you wrong, or you\u2019ll regret it for the rest of your life.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not Bran anymore, Arya.\u201d you said softly, your voice breaking. </p><p>\u201cYes he is,\u201d she replied gently, \u201cfor you, he is.\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 </p><p>As you made your way through the courtyard, you tried to pretend that your heart wasn\u2019t pounding in your chest. You felt as though everyone was staring at you, like they knew what you were about to do and thought you were an idiot for even trying. Part of you agreed with them of course. After all, you\u2019d been the one who had to listen to Meera and help her find her way home. </p><p><i>\u201cMeera I\u2019m sure Bran didn\u2019t-\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you, Y/N? He\u2019s not Bran anymore! He\u2019s the three eyed raven, and surprise surprise, the three eyed raven doesn\u2019t give a shitt about you or me.\u201d Meera fumed as she shoved her few possessions into a bag. </i></p><p><i>You pressed your lips together, unsure how to navigate the situation at hand. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe if I just go and talk to him about it-\u201d you tried, your voice fading off as you realised that you had know idea what to do. </i></p><p><i>Meera rolled her eyes but replied, not unkindly, \u201cYou think he loves you, don\u2019t you? Or maybe you hope he does?\u201d You blushed bright red but didn\u2019t contradict her, which Meera took as a sign of agreement, \u201cWell, if he ever loved you back, I think those days are gone Y/N/N. I\u2019m sorry, truly I am, but I can\u2019t stay here.\u201d </i></p><p>You blinked back into reality, the unpleasant memory leaving a bitter taste in your mouth. Meera was your friend, you\u2019d survived so much together and seeing her leave the way she did had broken your heart. You wanted to be angry on her behalf, you really did. You wanted to rage and scream and storm out of Winterfell and never look back. You wanted to make Bran feel the hurt he\u2019d caused her. Or at least you <i>wanted</i> to want that. In reality, you just wanted Bran. </p><p>The smell of smoke from the forges burnt your nose as you inhaled and you were reminded again of how much everything had changed. Winterfell barely resembled the castle you\u2019d grown up in, now everything was harsh and sharp, ready for battle, ready for death. In a morbid sort of way, it was just like you. You suddenly had a sharp pang of longing for your childhood, for the easy days when you and Bran would chase one another through the passageways, play knights and kings in the godswood and clamber up onto the ramparts. Everything had been so beautiful then and, up until now, you\u2019d never truly understood how far behind you those days were, how irretrievable. Bran had known, you thought to yourself, he\u2019d known for years. </p><p><i>The firelight danced off the darkened trees, casting terrifying long shadows that you tried to avoid seeing. Everything beyond the wall felt strange and alien, but some small part of you still thrummed with excitement. No one in your family had ever gone this far north and, no matter what else may happen, you were with Bran. For a rare moment, everything seemed peaceful. Hodor was warming his hands, Meera was out hunting and Jojen seemed to be feeling stronger. Only Bran seemed discontent. He\u2019d been avoiding you for days now, ever since the run in you\u2019d had with a pack of wolves. Summer had scared them off well enough, but not before you\u2019d gotten a nasty scratch and made a fool of yourself by sobbing like a little girl over it. Part of you wondered if you\u2019d simply lost his respect, another part thought that maybe you\u2019d never had it in the first place. Suddenly, Bran looked directly at you and your heart fluttered in your chest as he met your eye, smiled sadly at you from across the fire and gestured for you to join him. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d you asked, trying to hide your excitement and passing him a skin to drink from. </i></p><p><i>Bran was silent for a long moment, giving you time to trace his face with your eyes, drinking in every dip and curve like a person dying of thirst looking at the last river in the world. Something was wrong and you knew it, something was weighing heavily on Bran\u2019s mind. He was beautiful; dark and handsome with a smile that made you feel like your stomach had turned to molten lava whenever it graced his face. But now his face was sad and drawn, as though he\u2019d seen too much which, you supposed, was accurate enough. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI miss home,\u201d Bran finally said, his voice small, \u201cI miss Winterfell.\u201d </i></p><p><i>For a moment he sounded young again, like the boy who had fallen from a high tower, and your heart pinched with concern. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI do too,\u201d you admitted, \u201cbut we\u2019ll see it again someday. Once we\u2019ve found the three eyed raven and fulfilled your destiny, we can go home and start again. We\u2019ll take back Winterfell and reclaim the North, and everything can go back to how it was.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Bran looked at you, something welling in his eyes that hovered between pity and awe. It made your skin tingle, like lightning was about to strike or a storm was about to break. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou really believe that, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, staring like you were a puzzle he enjoyed trying to crack, \u201cYou believe that everything is going to be alright in the end, that we can go back and start over?\u201d </i></p><p><i>The weight of his gaze made you want to look away, but you didn\u2019t. You held your head up and shrugged with one shoulder, answering, \u201cI have to. Every morning that I wake up cold and hungry or afraid, I have to believe that the next morning will be better, that all this suffering isn\u2019t for nothing.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Bran nodded thoughtfully, his eyes becoming sad and pained as he turned back to the fire, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked you to come.\u201d </i></p><p><i> You rolled your eyes affectionately, having had this conversation countless times over the years, \u201cBran-\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI put you in danger Y/N! I put your life at risk all so that -\u201d he broke off quickly. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAll so that what, Bran?\u201d you asked, feeling yourself hit the same wall he threw up every time this fight started, \u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t have been safe at Winterfell, and I begged to be allowed to come with you.\u201d You reminded him. Bran pressed his lips together but didn\u2019t answer. Your chest pinched and you forced down your frustration, leaning forward to hold his forearm and willed him to face you again, \u201cYou really think, after all the years I\u2019ve known you, I would\u2019ve just let you and Rickon disappear into the wilderness without me?\u201d you asked, covering his hand with your own, \u201cOr that Theon would\u2019ve just let me go home after he found out that you\u2019d gotten away? We\u2019ve been over this so many times now Bran, all so <b>what</b>?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cAll so that I wouldn\u2019t have to say goodbye to you!\u201d he blurted out, his dark eyes flicking up to meet yours for a second before flicking back to the ground, \u201cI was being selfish, and now you\u2019re stuck out here, hundreds of miles away from everything you\u2019ve ever known, surrounded by danger with no one but a cripple who can\u2019t even protect himself, let alone protect you.\u201d Bran continued, words pouring from his mouth like an opened floodgate. You felt something bloom in the silence, a kind of tension that made you oddly breathless, He stared down at your hands and slowly swiped his thumb over your fingers, sending a shiver down your spine and igniting a warmth from everywhere your skin touched, \u201cI should be sorry,\u201d he continued softly, his voice barely more than a whisper, \u201cthat\u2019s all I\u2019ve been doing these past few days, trying to be sorry. When I saw you surrounded by those wolves, I was. I would\u2019ve given anything to send you far away and know that you were safe, but now,\u201d he said, squeezing your hands in his and shaking his head incredulously, \u201cnow I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re with me.\u201d You swallowed hard and opened your mouth, willing yourself to say something, anything, but nothing came out. This time, when Bran smiled, it was sweet and fond and, when he brought your hands up and brushed his lips against your fingers, he held your gaze, \u201cSee? I told you I was selfish.\u201d</i></p><p>You shook your head and let out a shaky breath, the memory of Bran\u2019s smile swimming before your eyes as you stepped into the godswood. You found him exactly where you thought you would, beneath the sprawling weirwood, staring into the distance. The sight of him still made something in your chest leap and ache, but you pushed it aside. At the end of the day, you were here for a reason. You didn\u2019t announce yourself and he didn\u2019t acknowledge you. </p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cThe night king has made it past the wall,\u201d Bran said, as though he was commenting on the weather, \u201chis army will be here soon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I heard,\u201d you responded. The silence that followed felt, to you, like every single word, every gesture and touch that had ever passed between you and Bran, every lost chance, and it nearly brought you to tears. You sniffed and wiped your face, hardening your resolve and forcing your emotions down. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to see you,\u201d he said pleasantly, \u201cit\u2019s been a long time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been packing,\u201d you explained, \u201cI\u2019m going south. Tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>That got his attention. In no time at all the faraway look vanished from Bran\u2019s face and he met your gaze head on, with more presence than he\u2019d had in weeks. Some small part of you was pleased by his hurt expression, pleased to see any reaction at all really, but it was drowned out by the breaking of your heart because now it was <i>him, Bran Stark</i>, the man you\u2019d been in love with for nearly a decade. He was right there and gods had you missed him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d he asked, shocked. </p><p>\u201cFirst thing tomorrow,\u201d you answered and then, vindictively, \u201cI thought you would have known that already.\u201d. </p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t leave, not now.\u201d Bran replied, his voice coloured by something that felt a lot like hurt, \u201cY/N please-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a reason not to,\u201d you replied, horrified at the note of pleading in your voice, \u201cI don\u2019t want to-\u201d, You swallowed hard, \u201cgive me one good reason and I swear I\u2019ll stay.\u201d </p><p>Bran stammered, his dark eyes wide with shock and pain, \u201cI still need you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d You laughed as you begun to lose your battle with your tears, \u201cstand around like a good little servant while you sit in silence and stare at nothing? Take up space until you send me away like Meera?\u201d </p><p>Bran frowned, \u201cI could <i>never</i> send you away, Y/N, you know that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d you asked desperately, years of emotion coming to a head, \u201cWhy could you never send me away? Why am I still here even though our quest is over? <i>Why</i> were you never sorry? Why me, Bran? Why should I stay here and die with you rather than go south and die with my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you,\u201d he answered, equally passionately, \u201cI love you Y/N and I know, I <i>know</i> you love me too.\u201d </p><p>Whatever shock you may have felt was lost in the veritable tidal wave of conflicting emotions that were tearing you up. You wanted to laugh, to cry, to scream and rage and throw yourself into Bran\u2019s arms. A million thoughts and none at all rushed through your mind but, eventually, all you said was,</p><p>\u201cYou knew. You\u2019ve known this whole time and you never-\u201d you broke off, pressing the heel of your hand to your forehead as a hot tear rolled down your cheek. </p><p>Bran\u2019s eyes widened and he leaned forward, as if to touch you, before realising his mistake and sitting back. </p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d he said quickly, \u201cI only saw it a few months ago. I wanted to say something, I did but-\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d you finished, \u201cit never mattered, you said it yourself. You\u2019re the three eyed raven now, you belong to the realm. Gods, I\u2019m such an idiot\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, I will always love you,\u201d Bran promised, taking your hand in his, \u201cif it was any other time, any other threat I would tell you to go, to find someone who deserves you, but I need you now. I can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d </p><p>You looked away, knowing that his earnest, open look would break you. Everything inside of you felt raw and tender, like an exposed nerve. You felt naked and vulnerable, like Bran could see into your very soul. <i>He loves you</i>, a small voice in the back of your mind whispered,<i> he loves you, he loves you, he loves you.</i> You should\u2019ve been happy. You should\u2019ve been jumping with joy, but instead Bran\u2019s confession did nothing but make you feel even more alone. </p><p>You shook your head, \u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d you said, sadly, \u201cI wish it was. I want it to be a good enough reason, but it isn\u2019t.\u201d You looked back at Bran, hoping he could see the sincerity in your eyes, \u201cCan you promise me, right now, that the night king will win?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he responded, \u201cwe could beat him. I think we will.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen this isn\u2019t the end,\u201d you said, kneeling in front of Bran\u2019s wheelchair, \u201cI love you, Brandon Stark, I really do, I have since we were children, but I can\u2019t spend my life waiting for you to be able to love me back. I don\u2019t know what being the three eyed raven means for you, what you\u2019re capable of doing, of being, but I know that, if I stay here, I\u2019m condemning myself to a life of hoping for a future that may never even be possible.\u201d </p><p>Tears welled up in Bran\u2019s eyes, pouring over his cheeks like liquid diamonds. He squeezed your hand tight, swiping his thumb across your fingers, just like he\u2019d done that night next to the fire. </p><p>\u201cY/N I-\u201d </p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d you said, through your own tears, \u201cI need to say this. I deserve to be happy. I deserve love, and peace and comfort and a man who wants to be with me-\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>I</i> want to be with you,\u201d Bran interrupted, \u201cbut I can\u2019t give you a family, I could never be a true husband, I-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t <i>need</i> children, Bran,\u201d you continued, \u201cwhat I need is a partnership. I need you to be as committed to me as you are to being the three eyed raven and you can\u2019t do that, not now at least.\u201d You explained. You paused, willing him to contradict you, but he didn\u2019t. You sighed inwardly but pressed on, \u201cI need to leave. I need to find out who I am without you but, if we survive, if somehow we defeat the night king and Cersei and whatever else comes up, and find a way to live in peace\u2026if that happens and you still love me, if that happens and you can be the man I think you still are, come and find me. I\u2019ll be in Highgarden with my family.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re in love with someone else?\u201d Bran asked quietly. </p><p>For the first time you openly traced his face with your eyes, every dip and curve, committing each to memory, as though this was the last time you would ever see them and, slowly, you leant in and pressed your lips to Bran\u2019s. The kiss was sweet and chaste, and filled you with something that felt like sunlight and tasted like spring and you thought, maybe, this could be enough. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be,\u201d You promised when you broke apart. </p><p>Bran looked at you with wonder, his dark eyes heavy with love and loss and pain, but also acceptance. He brought your hand to his lips and kissed your fingers. </p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll be safe,\u201d he eventually said, \u201cso that I can find you when this is over.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d </p><p>Bran nodded and cupped your face with his hand, \u201cI love you Y/N Y/L/N, I always will.\u201d </p><p>You smiled sadly and stood, letting his hand fall back into his lap, \u201cI love you too. Good luck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back for you someday, Y/N. I swear it by the old gods and the new.\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- </p><p>The days were shorter now, and snow had begun to fall in Highgarden, carpeting the grounds in white as you strolled through the garden. Your family had a new liege lord apparently, Ser Bron, and, according to your father, you had a new king too. You had been home for a few months now and, while the memories of Bran had stopped aching, he was never far from your mind. It had been horrible at first. You\u2019d wept yourself to sleep for weeks, cursing yourself for leaving, cursing him for staying, cursing the gods for making both necessary. Now, though, things were better. The kingdom was finally at peace, the night king was gone and life had regained a tenuous feeling of normality. You were yourself again, without fear or pain for the first time in years and it felt\u2026\u2026right. \u00a0</p><p>King Brandon, first of his name. You smiled to yourself, it was still so strange to think about. He would be a good king, moderate and calculated, with no desire for power and a real connection with the people of the seven (you mean six) kingdoms. Your heart still ached for him, but you knew you\u2019d made the right decision in the end. If everything really was connected, then your leaving had to happen and, if you could go back, you would do it all again. </p><p>Somewhere nearby, a raven croaked, familiar and calming, and the sound of an opening door and footsteps caught your ear. </p><p>\u201cY/N, come inside!\u201d Your father called. </p><p>You frowned but followed his instructions, shrugging off your thick cloak and brushing the snow from your hair as you made your way to the main hall. </p><p>\u201cFather?\u201d you questioned, \u201cFather, what is it? Is something the matter? I heard the door open, is someone here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust an old friend,\u201d a familiar voice answered from behind you. </p><p>Your heart stopped and, for a long moment, you were too afraid to turn around, in case there was nothing there and you\u2019d simply imagined it all but, eventually you turned, and let out a sound that was halfway between a whimper and a sob. Without a second thought you threw yourself at Bran, collapsing onto your knees ad wrapping your arms around his neck to pull him close. </p><p>He laughed gently into your ear and hugged you back, burying his face in your hair, his lips just barely brushing the skin of your neck. </p><p>\u201cYou came,\u201d you laugh-cried, \u201cyou really came.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d he responded fondly, \u201cI promised you I would.\u201d </p><p>You smiled as you pulled away from the hug, wiping the tears of happiness from your cheeks and standing. </p><p>\u201cWhere are my manners?\u201d you said jokingly, dipping into a deep curtsey, \u201cYour Grace.\u201d </p><p>Bran snorted and smirked back at you, more relaxed and happy than you\u2019d seen him in years. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not used to that,\u201d he admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be used to that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d you assured him, \u201cafter all, you are the king.\u201d </p><p>Bran looked up at you and, for the first time, he looked unsure. </p><p>\u201cCould you love a king?\u201d he asked and, at that moment, you realised what he was asking. </p><p><i>Could you love me like this? Could you love a man who\u2019s married to the realm? Could you love a man who would make you queen, but never give you children? Who hurt you and neglected you out of fear? Who let you walk away? Could you love <b>me</b>? </i>You heard him and you smiled. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you answered honestly, \u201cYes, I rather think I could.\u201d</p></p>",

Preparations for the Great War seemed to be going well but, deep down you knew that they wouldn&rsquo;t be enough. Even if every man and woman in the north worked for ten years, they would never be enough, the dead were too numerous, to unfeeling, too unstoppable. In the back of your mind you heard their screams, the thundering of their feet against the cave floor and felt the sense of hopelessness crash over you again. You shivered and tucked your hands into the crook of your elbow, squeezing your body tight. You&rsquo;d think that having spent so many years in the north, growing up in Winterfell and dragging Bran around beyond the wall would have made you accustomed to the cold but it seemed like, as far as your body was concerned, you&rsquo;d always be a southerner. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll get a lot colder in the next few weeks,&rdquo; Arya Stark commented, appearing beside you like a ghost. </p><p>You jumped, but gave Arya a tired smile and tightened your grip on your stomach, &ldquo;Well, luckily for me, I&rsquo;ll probably be dead by then, and I&rsquo;ve been lead to believe that the cold doesn&rsquo;t bother zombies.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya didn&rsquo;t exactly smile, but her eyes crinkled up at the sides and the edges of her mouth twitched up. She followed your gaze out across the courtyard to where the red leaves of the godswood were just barely visible and you felt, more than heard, her shift her weight uncomfortably. </p><p>&ldquo;The last of the wagons are leaving tomorrow. I&rsquo;ve asked them to save you a spot on one headed to Highgarden, but you have to decide soon.&rdquo; she said gently. You swallowed hard but didn&rsquo;t move to meet Arya&rsquo;s gaze, keeping your eyes locked on the godswood. She sighed and continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been weeks since Meera left, Y/N. If you&rsquo;re still conflicted-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking to him about it, Arya,&rdquo; you interrupted, &ldquo;I already know what he would say.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He sent Meera away without so much as a goodbye!&rdquo; You reminded her, surprising yourself with the intensity of your frustration, &ldquo;After three years, three years of feeding him and protecting him he just-&rdquo; you broke off and shook your head, blinking back tears, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I could handle him treating me that way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not Meera Reed,&rdquo; Arya insisted, gripping your forearm and forcing you to turn to face her, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re Y/N Y/L/N, you grew up with us, we&rsquo;ve known you since we were children.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It does!&rdquo; she corrected, &ldquo;Y/N, Bran-he-&rdquo; she paused, &ldquo;nothing is certain right now. As you said, we could all be dead in the next few weeks. You can&rsquo;t leave without telling Bran, not now. Give him a chance to prove you wrong, or you&rsquo;ll regret it for the rest of your life.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not Bran anymore, Arya.&rdquo; you said softly, your voice breaking. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes he is,&rdquo; she replied gently, &ldquo;for you, he is.&rdquo; </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; </p><p>As you made your way through the courtyard, you tried to pretend that your heart wasn&rsquo;t pounding in your chest. You felt as though everyone was staring at you, like they knew what you were about to do and thought you were an idiot for even trying. Part of you agreed with them of course. After all, you&rsquo;d been the one who had to listen to Meera and help her find her way home. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Meera I&rsquo;m sure Bran didn&rsquo;t-&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;How many times do I have to tell you, Y/N? He&rsquo;s not Bran anymore! He&rsquo;s the three eyed raven, and surprise surprise, the three eyed raven doesn&rsquo;t give a shitt about you or me.&rdquo; Meera fumed as she shoved her few possessions into a bag. </i></p><p><i>You pressed your lips together, unsure how to navigate the situation at hand. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Maybe if I just go and talk to him about it-&rdquo; you tried, your voice fading off as you realised that you had know idea what to do. </i></p><p><i>Meera rolled her eyes but replied, not unkindly, &ldquo;You think he loves you, don&rsquo;t you? Or maybe you hope he does?&rdquo; You blushed bright red but didn&rsquo;t contradict her, which Meera took as a sign of agreement, &ldquo;Well, if he ever loved you back, I think those days are gone Y/N/N. I&rsquo;m sorry, truly I am, but I can&rsquo;t stay here.&rdquo; </i></p><p>You blinked back into reality, the unpleasant memory leaving a bitter taste in your mouth. Meera was your friend, you&rsquo;d survived so much together and seeing her leave the way she did had broken your heart. You wanted to be angry on her behalf, you really did. You wanted to rage and scream and storm out of Winterfell and never look back. You wanted to make Bran feel the hurt he&rsquo;d caused her. Or at least you <i>wanted</i> to want that. In reality, you just wanted Bran. </p><p>The smell of smoke from the forges burnt your nose as you inhaled and you were reminded again of how much everything had changed. Winterfell barely resembled the castle you&rsquo;d grown up in, now everything was harsh and sharp, ready for battle, ready for death. In a morbid sort of way, it was just like you. You suddenly had a sharp pang of longing for your childhood, for the easy days when you and Bran would chase one another through the passageways, play knights and kings in the godswood and clamber up onto the ramparts. Everything had been so beautiful then and, up until now, you&rsquo;d never truly understood how far behind you those days were, how irretrievable. Bran had known, you thought to yourself, he&rsquo;d known for years. </p><p><i>The firelight danced off the darkened trees, casting terrifying long shadows that you tried to avoid seeing. Everything beyond the wall felt strange and alien, but some small part of you still thrummed with excitement. No one in your family had ever gone this far north and, no matter what else may happen, you were with Bran. For a rare moment, everything seemed peaceful. Hodor was warming his hands, Meera was out hunting and Jojen seemed to be feeling stronger. Only Bran seemed discontent. He&rsquo;d been avoiding you for days now, ever since the run in you&rsquo;d had with a pack of wolves. Summer had scared them off well enough, but not before you&rsquo;d gotten a nasty scratch and made a fool of yourself by sobbing like a little girl over it. Part of you wondered if you&rsquo;d simply lost his respect, another part thought that maybe you&rsquo;d never had it in the first place. Suddenly, Bran looked directly at you and your heart fluttered in your chest as he met your eye, smiled sadly at you from across the fire and gestured for you to join him. &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; you asked, trying to hide your excitement and passing him a skin to drink from. </i></p><p><i>Bran was silent for a long moment, giving you time to trace his face with your eyes, drinking in every dip and curve like a person dying of thirst looking at the last river in the world. Something was wrong and you knew it, something was weighing heavily on Bran&rsquo;s mind. He was beautiful; dark and handsome with a smile that made you feel like your stomach had turned to molten lava whenever it graced his face. But now his face was sad and drawn, as though he&rsquo;d seen too much which, you supposed, was accurate enough. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I miss home,&rdquo; Bran finally said, his voice small, &ldquo;I miss Winterfell.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>For a moment he sounded young again, like the boy who had fallen from a high tower, and your heart pinched with concern. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I do too,&rdquo; you admitted, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll see it again someday. Once we&rsquo;ve found the three eyed raven and fulfilled your destiny, we can go home and start again. We&rsquo;ll take back Winterfell and reclaim the North, and everything can go back to how it was.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Bran looked at you, something welling in his eyes that hovered between pity and awe. It made your skin tingle, like lightning was about to strike or a storm was about to break. &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You really believe that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked, staring like you were a puzzle he enjoyed trying to crack, &ldquo;You believe that everything is going to be alright in the end, that we can go back and start over?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>The weight of his gaze made you want to look away, but you didn&rsquo;t. You held your head up and shrugged with one shoulder, answering, &ldquo;I have to. Every morning that I wake up cold and hungry or afraid, I have to believe that the next morning will be better, that all this suffering isn&rsquo;t for nothing.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Bran nodded thoughtfully, his eyes becoming sad and pained as he turned back to the fire, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have asked you to come.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i> You rolled your eyes affectionately, having had this conversation countless times over the years, &ldquo;Bran-&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I put you in danger Y/N! I put your life at risk all so that -&rdquo; he broke off quickly. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;All so that what, Bran?&rdquo; you asked, feeling yourself hit the same wall he threw up every time this fight started, &ldquo;You know I wouldn&rsquo;t have been safe at Winterfell, and I begged to be allowed to come with you.&rdquo; You reminded him. Bran pressed his lips together but didn&rsquo;t answer. Your chest pinched and you forced down your frustration, leaning forward to hold his forearm and willed him to face you again, &ldquo;You really think, after all the years I&rsquo;ve known you, I would&rsquo;ve just let you and Rickon disappear into the wilderness without me?&rdquo; you asked, covering his hand with your own, &ldquo;Or that Theon would&rsquo;ve just let me go home after he found out that you&rsquo;d gotten away? We&rsquo;ve been over this so many times now Bran, all so <b>what</b>?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;All so that I wouldn&rsquo;t have to say goodbye to you!&rdquo; he blurted out, his dark eyes flicking up to meet yours for a second before flicking back to the ground, &ldquo;I was being selfish, and now you&rsquo;re stuck out here, hundreds of miles away from everything you&rsquo;ve ever known, surrounded by danger with no one but a cripple who can&rsquo;t even protect himself, let alone protect you.&rdquo; Bran continued, words pouring from his mouth like an opened floodgate. You felt something bloom in the silence, a kind of tension that made you oddly breathless, He stared down at your hands and slowly swiped his thumb over your fingers, sending a shiver down your spine and igniting a warmth from everywhere your skin touched, &ldquo;I should be sorry,&rdquo; he continued softly, his voice barely more than a whisper, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve been doing these past few days, trying to be sorry. When I saw you surrounded by those wolves, I was. I would&rsquo;ve given anything to send you far away and know that you were safe, but now,&rdquo; he said, squeezing your hands in his and shaking his head incredulously, &ldquo;now I&rsquo;m just glad you&rsquo;re with me.&rdquo; You swallowed hard and opened your mouth, willing yourself to say something, anything, but nothing came out. This time, when Bran smiled, it was sweet and fond and, when he brought your hands up and brushed his lips against your fingers, he held your gaze, &ldquo;See? I told you I was selfish.&rdquo;</i></p><p>You shook your head and let out a shaky breath, the memory of Bran&rsquo;s smile swimming before your eyes as you stepped into the godswood. You found him exactly where you thought you would, beneath the sprawling weirwood, staring into the distance. The sight of him still made something in your chest leap and ache, but you pushed it aside. At the end of the day, you were here for a reason. You didn&rsquo;t announce yourself and he didn&rsquo;t acknowledge you. </p><p><b></b></p><p>&ldquo;The night king has made it past the wall,&rdquo; Bran said, as though he was commenting on the weather, &ldquo;his army will be here soon.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard,&rdquo; you responded. The silence that followed felt, to you, like every single word, every gesture and touch that had ever passed between you and Bran, every lost chance, and it nearly brought you to tears. You sniffed and wiped your face, hardening your resolve and forcing your emotions down. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting to see you,&rdquo; he said pleasantly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been a long time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been packing,&rdquo; you explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going south. Tomorrow.&rdquo; </p><p>That got his attention. In no time at all the faraway look vanished from Bran&rsquo;s face and he met your gaze head on, with more presence than he&rsquo;d had in weeks. Some small part of you was pleased by his hurt expression, pleased to see any reaction at all really, but it was drowned out by the breaking of your heart because now it was <i>him, Bran Stark</i>, the man you&rsquo;d been in love with for nearly a decade. He was right there and gods had you missed him. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving?&rdquo; he asked, shocked. </p><p>&ldquo;First thing tomorrow,&rdquo; you answered and then, vindictively, &ldquo;I thought you would have known that already.&rdquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t leave, not now.&rdquo; Bran replied, his voice coloured by something that felt a lot like hurt, &ldquo;Y/N please-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give me a reason not to,&rdquo; you replied, horrified at the note of pleading in your voice, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to-&rdquo;, You swallowed hard, &ldquo;give me one good reason and I swear I&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo; </p><p>Bran stammered, his dark eyes wide with shock and pain, &ldquo;I still need you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;To do what?&rdquo; You laughed as you begun to lose your battle with your tears, &ldquo;stand around like a good little servant while you sit in silence and stare at nothing? Take up space until you send me away like Meera?&rdquo; </p><p>Bran frowned, &ldquo;I could <i>never</i> send you away, Y/N, you know that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; you asked desperately, years of emotion coming to a head, &ldquo;Why could you never send me away? Why am I still here even though our quest is over? <i>Why</i> were you never sorry? Why me, Bran? Why should I stay here and die with you rather than go south and die with my family?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I love you,&rdquo; he answered, equally passionately, &ldquo;I love you Y/N and I know, I <i>know</i> you love me too.&rdquo; </p><p>Whatever shock you may have felt was lost in the veritable tidal wave of conflicting emotions that were tearing you up. You wanted to laugh, to cry, to scream and rage and throw yourself into Bran&rsquo;s arms. A million thoughts and none at all rushed through your mind but, eventually, all you said was,</p><p>&ldquo;You knew. You&rsquo;ve known this whole time and you never-&rdquo; you broke off, pressing the heel of your hand to your forehead as a hot tear rolled down your cheek. </p><p>Bran&rsquo;s eyes widened and he leaned forward, as if to touch you, before realising his mistake and sitting back. </p><p>&ldquo;Not for long,&rdquo; he said quickly, &ldquo;I only saw it a few months ago. I wanted to say something, I did but-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; you finished, &ldquo;it never mattered, you said it yourself. You&rsquo;re the three eyed raven now, you belong to the realm. Gods, I&rsquo;m such an idiot&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I will always love you,&rdquo; Bran promised, taking your hand in his, &ldquo;if it was any other time, any other threat I would tell you to go, to find someone who deserves you, but I need you now. I can&rsquo;t do this alone.&rdquo; </p><p>You looked away, knowing that his earnest, open look would break you. Everything inside of you felt raw and tender, like an exposed nerve. You felt naked and vulnerable, like Bran could see into your very soul. <i>He loves you</i>, a small voice in the back of your mind whispered,<i> he loves you, he loves you, he loves you.</i> You should&rsquo;ve been happy. You should&rsquo;ve been jumping with joy, but instead Bran&rsquo;s confession did nothing but make you feel even more alone. </p><p>You shook your head, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not enough,&rdquo; you said, sadly, &ldquo;I wish it was. I want it to be a good enough reason, but it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; You looked back at Bran, hoping he could see the sincerity in your eyes, &ldquo;Can you promise me, right now, that the night king will win?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;we could beat him. I think we will.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Then this isn&rsquo;t the end,&rdquo; you said, kneeling in front of Bran&rsquo;s wheelchair, &ldquo;I love you, Brandon Stark, I really do, I have since we were children, but I can&rsquo;t spend my life waiting for you to be able to love me back. I don&rsquo;t know what being the three eyed raven means for you, what you&rsquo;re capable of doing, of being, but I know that, if I stay here, I&rsquo;m condemning myself to a life of hoping for a future that may never even be possible.&rdquo; </p><p>Tears welled up in Bran&rsquo;s eyes, pouring over his cheeks like liquid diamonds. He squeezed your hand tight, swiping his thumb across your fingers, just like he&rsquo;d done that night next to the fire. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N I-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Shh,&rdquo; you said, through your own tears, &ldquo;I need to say this. I deserve to be happy. I deserve love, and peace and comfort and a man who wants to be with me-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> want to be with you,&rdquo; Bran interrupted, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t give you a family, I could never be a true husband, I-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>need</i> children, Bran,&rdquo; you continued, &ldquo;what I need is a partnership. I need you to be as committed to me as you are to being the three eyed raven and you can&rsquo;t do that, not now at least.&rdquo; You explained. You paused, willing him to contradict you, but he didn&rsquo;t. You sighed inwardly but pressed on, &ldquo;I need to leave. I need to find out who I am without you but, if we survive, if somehow we defeat the night king and Cersei and whatever else comes up, and find a way to live in peace&hellip;if that happens and you still love me, if that happens and you can be the man I think you still are, come and find me. I&rsquo;ll be in Highgarden with my family.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What if you&rsquo;re in love with someone else?&rdquo; Bran asked quietly. </p><p>For the first time you openly traced his face with your eyes, every dip and curve, committing each to memory, as though this was the last time you would ever see them and, slowly, you leant in and pressed your lips to Bran&rsquo;s. The kiss was sweet and chaste, and filled you with something that felt like sunlight and tasted like spring and you thought, maybe, this could be enough. </p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; You promised when you broke apart. </p><p>Bran looked at you with wonder, his dark eyes heavy with love and loss and pain, but also acceptance. He brought your hand to his lips and kissed your fingers. </p><p>&ldquo;Promise me you&rsquo;ll be safe,&rdquo; he eventually said, &ldquo;so that I can find you when this is over.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo; </p><p>Bran nodded and cupped your face with his hand, &ldquo;I love you Y/N Y/L/N, I always will.&rdquo; </p><p>You smiled sadly and stood, letting his hand fall back into his lap, &ldquo;I love you too. Good luck.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back for you someday, Y/N. I swear it by the old gods and the new.&rdquo; </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- </p><p>The days were shorter now, and snow had begun to fall in Highgarden, carpeting the grounds in white as you strolled through the garden. Your family had a new liege lord apparently, Ser Bron, and, according to your father, you had a new king too. You had been home for a few months now and, while the memories of Bran had stopped aching, he was never far from your mind. It had been horrible at first. You&rsquo;d wept yourself to sleep for weeks, cursing yourself for leaving, cursing him for staying, cursing the gods for making both necessary. Now, though, things were better. The kingdom was finally at peace, the night king was gone and life had regained a tenuous feeling of normality. You were yourself again, without fear or pain for the first time in years and it felt&hellip;&hellip;right. &nbsp;</p><p>King Brandon, first of his name. You smiled to yourself, it was still so strange to think about. He would be a good king, moderate and calculated, with no desire for power and a real connection with the people of the seven (you mean six) kingdoms. Your heart still ached for him, but you knew you&rsquo;d made the right decision in the end. If everything really was connected, then your leaving had to happen and, if you could go back, you would do it all again. </p><p>Somewhere nearby, a raven croaked, familiar and calming, and the sound of an opening door and footsteps caught your ear. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, come inside!&rdquo; Your father called. </p><p>You frowned but followed his instructions, shrugging off your thick cloak and brushing the snow from your hair as you made your way to the main hall. </p><p>&ldquo;Father?&rdquo; you questioned, &ldquo;Father, what is it? Is something the matter? I heard the door open, is someone here?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Just an old friend,&rdquo; a familiar voice answered from behind you. </p><p>Your heart stopped and, for a long moment, you were too afraid to turn around, in case there was nothing there and you&rsquo;d simply imagined it all but, eventually you turned, and let out a sound that was halfway between a whimper and a sob. Without a second thought you threw yourself at Bran, collapsing onto your knees ad wrapping your arms around his neck to pull him close. </p><p>He laughed gently into your ear and hugged you back, burying his face in your hair, his lips just barely brushing the skin of your neck. </p><p>&ldquo;You came,&rdquo; you laugh-cried, &ldquo;you really came.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; he responded fondly, &ldquo;I promised you I would.&rdquo; </p><p>You smiled as you pulled away from the hug, wiping the tears of happiness from your cheeks and standing. </p><p>&ldquo;Where are my manners?&rdquo; you said jokingly, dipping into a deep curtsey, &ldquo;Your Grace.&rdquo; </p><p>Bran snorted and smirked back at you, more relaxed and happy than you&rsquo;d seen him in years. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still not used to that,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever be used to that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; you assured him, &ldquo;after all, you are the king.&rdquo; </p><p>Bran looked up at you and, for the first time, he looked unsure. </p><p>&ldquo;Could you love a king?&rdquo; he asked and, at that moment, you realised what he was asking. </p><p><i>Could you love me like this? Could you love a man who&rsquo;s married to the realm? Could you love a man who would make you queen, but never give you children? Who hurt you and neglected you out of fear? Who let you walk away? Could you love <b>me</b>? </i>You heard him and you smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you answered honestly, &ldquo;Yes, I rather think I could.&rdquo;</p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure>\n<p><b></b></p>\n<p>AN: You&rsquo;ve loved Bran Stark for as long as you could remember, but now everything has changed and you&rsquo;re not sure you can hold on to this fantasy for much longer. <br />Characters: Bran Stark, Meera Reed, Arya Stark. </p>\n<p>Pairing(s): Bran Stark x reader <br />Spoiler(s): plotlines for season eight. <br />Warning(s): Mentions of death. </p>\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Gods above!&rdquo; You cursed as the cold air bit into the parts of your face and hands you hadn&rsquo;t managed to cover. </p>\n<p>You wrapped your thick cloak more tightly around yourself and stared out over the courtyard of Winterfell. Preparations for the Great War seemed to be going well but, deep down you knew that they wouldn&rsquo;t be enough. Even if every man and woman in the north worked for ten years, they would never be enough, the dead were too numerous, to unfeeling, too unstoppable. In the back of your mind you heard their screams, the thundering of their feet against the cave floor and felt the sense of hopelessness crash over you again. You shivered and tucked your hands into the crook of your elbow, squeezing your body tight. You&rsquo;d think that having spent so many years in the north, growing up in Winterfell and dragging Bran around beyond the wall would have made you accustomed to the cold but it seemed like, as far as your body was concerned, you&rsquo;d always be a southerner. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll get a lot colder in the next few weeks,&rdquo; Arya Stark commented, appearing beside you like a ghost. </p>\n<p>You jumped, but gave Arya a tired smile and tightened your grip on your stomach, &ldquo;Well, luckily for me, I&rsquo;ll probably be dead by then, and I&rsquo;ve been lead to believe that the cold doesn&rsquo;t bother zombies.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Arya didn&rsquo;t exactly smile, but her eyes crinkled up at the sides and the edges of her mouth twitched up. She followed your gaze out across the courtyard to where the red leaves of the godswood were just barely visible and you felt, more than heard, her shift her weight uncomfortably. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;The last of the wagons are leaving tomorrow. I&rsquo;ve asked them to save you a spot on one headed to Highgarden, but you have to decide soon.&rdquo; she said gently. You swallowed hard but didn&rsquo;t move to meet Arya&rsquo;s gaze, keeping your eyes locked on the godswood. She sighed and continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been weeks since Meera left, Y/N. If you&rsquo;re still conflicted-&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking to him about it, Arya,&rdquo; you interrupted, &ldquo;I already know what he would say.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p>\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>Okay, so I\u2019ll do this review a little differently for the last season. I will review each episode.</p><!-- more --><p><b>8x01 -</b> So the first one was a bit uneventful regarding the threat and all, but it was very much needed in terms of reunions.</p><p>I loved how Arya was in the crowd at first and how her face changed upon seeing her brother, then the hound, then Gendry. Ha ha. I laughed because I totally forgot she had not only one reunion to have but three.</p><p>Sansa and Daenerys bickering was fun. Especially since Dany\u2019s harsh comments to Sansa made my day. I don\u2019t like Dany much anymore, but still better than Sansa.</p><p>No offence to those who do like her, of course. <br/></p><p>Her comment about dragon eating anything was savage ha ha.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like that Lyana was pulling away from Jon because he left. But I admit he\u2019s not so good at explaining. Although I think he experienced too much disbelief by that point to ever consider displaying the full story.</p><p>Arya meeting with the hound and giving him a death glare and all was priceless. I loved how he complimented and insulted her at the same time ha ha. And she was definitely flirting with Gendry. <br/></p><p>I didn\u2019t really think about this ship before, but it could be cute. <br/></p><p>Can\u2019t wait for him and Jon to see how badass she really is though.</p><p>And of course, that reunion with Jon was utterly adorable. Her chuckling and throwing herself into his arms, running so she could be hugging him faster. And how he saw she still had needle.</p><p>It was adorable how she defended Sansa. And I loved their hug and joy to see each other again. I couldn\u2019t help but notice the way Arya flinched when he asked if she used needle. <br/></p><p>I bet she\u2019s worried about what he\u2019s gonna think if he learns the truth. Him more than others.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t care less about Cersei and her fucking Euron. <br/></p><p>But Yara headbutting her brother for leaving her to potentially die felt great. I hope this is finally the time for him to grow a pair (pun kinda intended, sorry).</p><p>Jon and Dany. I don\u2019t mind but I don\u2019t care much yet. But that scene with Jon flying was great and a bit funny. Him panicking was so precious ha ha. <br/></p><p>The moment where Dany goes to thank Sam for saving Jorah, I was smiling like a dork. I loved how she praised him and all, but when it turned out she burnt his father and brother.</p><p>I totally forgot about that, tbh. It was rough. She wanted to thank him but it went awry. And that urged him to reveal the truth to Jon.</p><p>Well, he asked Bran to do it and Bran said he was not Bran again so he had to. I\u2019m mocking a bit because so far Bran has been staring at people from afar and it has been like that for a while. It\u2019s kind of funny.</p><p>The reveal was great frankly. Jon being distraught over it and Sam being hurt so he\u2019s trying to convince him to take the throne for himself. Ugh. All the emotions. I laughed though that he got everything in the end, BUT the fact he slept with his aunt.</p><p>Can\u2019t wait for what\u2019s next. Oh and I was very happy to see Tormund survive. (The \u201che\u2019s got blue eyes\u201d moment killed me. Those morons, ha ha). And many interactions were interesting. <br/></p><p>Sansa and Tyrion meeting again too. Many possibilities with everyone in the same place. I\u2019m intrigued for the possible pairings. (And I wanna see Arya and Jon fight together frankly). <br/></p><p>We could have had something great from Bran and Jaimie, but of course, he doesn\u2019t care since he\u2019s the Three Eyed Raven now. I\u2019m sorry, i have to roll my eyes at this a bit.</p><p><b>8x02 -</b> Okay, so there is not so much to say about the second episode either, because of course they cut it right before we dive into the big battle. I\u2019m waiting to see what\u2019s next btw, because, even though now the following episode is out, BF and I are planning to buy a new TV with OLED technology, if you know about it. <br/></p><p>And yeah&hellip; I want some dragons in big HD ! So i\u2019m willing to wait.</p><p>Jaime finally coming to Winterfell was great, because I was thrilled last season when he finally left Cersei\u2019s ass. It was about time frankly ! But we got another chapter of Bran staring at people and saying uncomfortable things once more ha ha.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at that \u201cthings we do for love\u201d. Jaime must have thought he was trying to make him feel guilty, when really, he doesn\u2019t give two shits about it. Bran is not Bran anymore, he\u2019ll say it again.</p><p>I loved Arya and Gendry scenes this episode. I didn\u2019t ship it before, but i kind like the idea and mostly, Gendry being all flustered and going to make the weapon right away after Arya showed him her throwing skills.</p><p>God, i love her so much. Seeing her having a sex scene for once was weird, but mostly because it\u2019s never been Arya\u2019s purpose. Aside from that, I didn\u2019t mind it. She\u2019s all grown up.</p><p>And also, I loved how she interrogated him, assassin&rsquo;s style, and then was so bossy. I also love how he was looking at her with such adoration. Yeah, a total badass loves you. <br/></p><p>Also, thank god Tormund came back ! I couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughing though when he mentioned Brienne and I remembered he had a tremendous crush about her ha ha. <br/></p><p>Sorry, but I think she has one on Jaime, not you. <br/></p><p>I also love to see the dynamic between the two Lannister\u2019s brothers back. I loved that Tyrion wasn\u2019t afraid to speak up to him and tell him that he did knew who Cersei was. He was just too infatuated at the time to even think about leaving her.</p><p>Also, i always was fond of the idea of Brienne and Jaime, so seeing him making her a knight had me all kinds of emotional. It was so adorable frankly and everyone chanting and her being so touched. Ugh. Kill me now. They\u2019re cute too.</p><p>I probably rolled my eyes at Dany though. Could you please stop spitting on your Hand ? I mean okay, he makes mistakes, but so do you ! And frankly, she\u2019s annoying me most of the time now. <br/></p><p>Also, I don\u2019t care for her and Jon being together, so there must be that. I don\u2019t like how she\u2019s answering to his revelation. I\u2019m not sure this is gonna end well, and mostly, she never even offered for them to take the throne together. <br/></p><p>I think, even though I don\u2019t care for their relationship, that it could be a great balance somehow. Because Jon is too soft and she\u2019s too harsh sometimes. So both on the throne ? I don\u2019t see why not.</p><p>Also, I bet she\u2019s gonna be mistrustful of him, even though he confessed everything when he could have easily avoid it. He barely gave himself time to think about it before telling her, so&hellip; I feel i\u2019m gonna roll my eyes often. Can we please skip to big battles instead ?</p><p>BUT. Dany and Sansa trying to bond for Jon and ending up being even more at odds made me laugh so hard. I just can\u2019t, it\u2019s ridiculous ha ha.</p><p>I loved seeing Gilly again and how she convinced that kid to go to the crypts to be safe was super sweet really.</p><p>I also love how Sam stood up for himself and told them off about killing a white walker and protecting Gilly and all. And the comment on him stealing a bunch of books. Ha ha. I love you adorable dork who evolved, no matter what people are saying, you\u2019re a gem.</p><p>Honourable mention to that replica by the end though \u201cI was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister\u201d. Ha ha. It killed me.</p><p>Sam giving his family sword to Jorah was inevitable and felt right somehow. <br/></p><p>And now, we\u2019re diving into the biggest battle ever ! I can\u2019t wait to come back from my trip to buy that big ass TV and watch this in awe. Also, it\u2019s weird to think there is only four episodes left.</p><p><b>8x03 -</b> Okay so, obviously I liked the battle very much. It was really beautiful to see with my new TV, I don\u2019t regret waiting.</p><p>But, I have to admit, I was a bit surprised it ended in an episode. So much that I kept waiting for the deads to attack again until the season finale. It never happened, so I wonder why they made such a fuzz for seasons only to resolve this in an hour and a half ? <br/></p><p>I guess I never thought the final boss of GOT would be Cersei. Sure, she was one of the last problems, but I didn\u2019t think she would be it. <br/></p><p>Anyway, it was still a rough battle with many casualties. And even the ones in the crypt got a little action (I think I yelled at Sansa to use that freaking knife, but she ended up safe anyway. I swear, she could at least try a bit. She barely got it out).</p><p>I was scared shitless for Arya a bunch of times. But how great was that she was battling fiercely when older ones stayed hidden ? But the minute the hound sees her, he goes after her to save her.</p><p>I love their dynamic frankly. Weirdest brotp but I dig it. <br/></p><p>I loved those references at old Arya\u00a0 quotes that they made. And how she went to attack the Night King. When he caught her by the throat, I was worried. I thought her dropping the knife was because she was being strangled. <br/></p><p>But then she took it back lower and got him right in the guts. I was cheering like hell. Damn, my girl, you looked hella cool. <br/></p><p>I mean, Arya Stark is the one who put an end to all this. I\u2019m just so proud of her. God. <br/></p><p><b>8x04 - </b>Arya Stark, hero of Winterfell. It has a great ring to it.</p><p>How cute was lovestruck Gendry, searching for Arya ? I was glad Dany told him he was now a lord. But when he went to see Arya and started declaring his love and asking her to be his lady&hellip;</p><p>I knew she was gonna turn him down. And I\u2019m glad they went down that route, because it is true to Arya, imo. She was never a lady. It was not her purpose. So, of course, she loves Gendry.</p><p>But she\u2019s not gonna change who she is because of him. And I love it.</p><p>Brienne, Jaimie and Tyrion in a drinking game felt like the beginning of a joke ha ha. But I was a bit sad when she fled after the statement about her being a virgin. <br/></p><p>Still, it was nice to see Jaimie and her finally acting on that attraction. But I couldn\u2019t help but want to hug Tormund who finally understood he had no chance with her. Ha ha. Poor guy, finally seeing the truth.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care much for Sansa\u2019s scene with the hound. But it\u2019s still an interesting enough dynamic somehow. <br/></p><p>Dany and Jon fighting over whether Jon could tell his secret to his sisters had me rolling my eyes a bit. I mean, you know Jon is not gonna be able to keep anything from Arya.</p><p>Sansa, sure. But Arya ? That girl got skills, she would absolutely figure out something\u2019s up at least.</p><p>But it annoyed me even more to see Sansa being so reluctant to swear before being told. Okay, you\u2019re distrustful of Dany, and I also get why. But, if Jon is asking, why keep fighting it ? <br/></p><p>I was glad Arya promised first though. You know she loves and trusts Jon so much. And she still voiced her concerns to him, which is good.</p><p>I loved that moment of brotp between Tormund and Jon.</p><p>And also, Jon and Sam. They actually said they were best friends. That\u2019s so stupidly adorable. And I was thrilled to see Sam and Gilly having a child.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a boy, we want to name him Jon\u201d \u201cI hope it\u2019s a girl\u201d. Ha ha.<br/></p><p>Also, Arya and the Hound heading to King\u2019s Landing together. Yeah, we all know what unfinished business you mean Arya. Wouldn\u2019t that have to do with a certain list ?</p><p>(Bronn threatening Tyrion and Jaimie was funny enough.)</p><p>But boy, that secret didn\u2019t take long to spread ha ha. Okay, maybe telling Jon in the first place was a bad idea. I don\u2019t feel he\u2019s good at keeping those.</p><p>But it was only logical it would get out this fast. <br/></p><p>And it is true Dany has been taking unnecessary measures for quite a while now. <br/></p><p>I was totally down for them marrying and ruling together, even though I don\u2019t care about the ship in itself. But I felt it was a perfect middle ground.</p><p>Only I knew Dany would never admit such a thing. She\u2019s been wanting that throne for quite a while, and she has done terrible things to get to it (let\u2019s not kid ourselves, she wasn\u2019t always in her right and compassionate mind). Why would she want to share ?</p><p>I was a bit salty they never tried to talk to her about the option though. <br/></p><p>And of course, Cersei had to be a cunt and kill Missandei. I knew she was a goner, but still was sad to see her die.</p><p><b>8x05 -</b> Seeing Daenerys, not eating, not leaving her chambers, and feeling like Jon betrayed her by telling his secret was a bit annoying.</p><p>I feel she\u2019s descending into mad king mode, and it\u2019s a shame frankly. Because we\u2019ve been told for seasons (by none other than her) that she\u2019s not her father. And to state such a thing for so long, only to have her prove everybody else right in the end ? It\u2019s really sad and it feels like it was all for nothing.</p><p>She\u2019s losing it. She\u2019s only seeing her goal and is willing to shed far more blood than she has to. I don\u2019t like what she\u2019s becoming, frankly. I haven\u2019t for a while now.</p><p>But it\u2019s far more advanced as the season is closing.</p><p>I\u2019m still cringing over the fact Jaimie went back to Cersei. I know Tyrion sent him with a plan, but that last scene with Brienne told me he was still hung up on her. But I still hold on to the hope he went there to end it.</p><p>I\u2019m still thinking about the prophecy, so&hellip;</p><p>I liked the beginning of the attack. It was great seeing the Hound finally fighting his brother. And I\u2019m also glad Arya chose to flee and live. She also has to know when it\u2019s time to run.</p><p>And of course, Dany lost it and attacked even though they rang the bells. Great, so I was right. Mad king mode it is. Thanks for that useless circle.</p><p>I was also very disappointed with how Cersei was killed. Where is the prophecy ? Did they consider Jaimie failing to find an exit was him killing her ? Because otherwise, I don\u2019t see it.</p><p>She was like the final antagonist of that show. And they took her out with a building collapsing on her ? Well, I expected more frankly.</p><p>Also, I feared for Arya a bunch of times, but I\u2019m glad her plot armour is still going strong enough. But boy, it reminded me of that time she was chased down by the waif. She had it hard again.<br/></p><p><b>8x06 -</b> I really liked that conversation Jon had with Tyrion. Like he knows deep down what she did wasn\u2019t right at all, but he still loves her so much he\u2019s conflicted. <br/></p><p>Don\u2019t be dumb, Jon. She\u2019s went down the bad road and you know it.</p><p>I loved how they played it even if I wished they never went there in the first place. But since they did, I liked the last interaction they had and how you can slowly see Jon trying to convince her, only to understand more and more how far she is into this.</p><p>And then he killed her.</p><p>The fact Tyrion was forced into being the hand of Bran, chosen king of the seven kingdoms baffles me. I mean, imo, he barely helped and I couldn\u2019t care for his Three Eyed Raven thing, because most of the time, he just seemed MIA.</p><p>But well, why not ? I\u2019m not feeling this ending already anyway.</p><p>Also, Jon Snow being sentenced to be in the Night\u2019s Watch felt very coming into circles again. What\u2019s the point ?</p><p>But Arya going to West of Westeros like she said she would was very satisfying. At least, she got a good ending. I\u2019m still salty about all the rest, but I\u2019m glad my favourite came out the good way.</p><p>(It might have felt a bit easy but I\u2019ll take it)</p><p>The little counsel reunion in the end made me scoff. It was silly and stupid. Those dorks are never gonna work properly together without bickering ha ha.</p><p>Sansa being crowned Queen in the North. Yeah why not, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s anyone else. But she didn\u2019t do much, imo.</p><p>I didn\u2019t really dislike that season. But it didn\u2019t feel like a real ending. I feel they could have cut some things and do so much more. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because it\u2019s a big show, but I expected more.</p><p>Well, anyway, goodbye Game of Thrones. It was still a nice ride.<br/></p>",

            "comment": "<p>Okay, so I\u2019ll do this review a little differently for the last season. I will review each episode.</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>8x01 -</b> So the first one was a bit uneventful regarding the threat and all, but it was very much needed in terms of reunions.</p><p>I loved how Arya was in the crowd at first and how her face changed upon seeing her brother, then the hound, then Gendry. Ha ha. I laughed because I totally forgot she had not only one reunion to have but three.</p><p>Sansa and Daenerys bickering was fun. Especially since Dany\u2019s harsh comments to Sansa made my day. I don\u2019t like Dany much anymore, but still better than Sansa.</p><p>No offence to those who do like her, of course. <br></p><p>Her comment about dragon eating anything was savage ha ha.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like that Lyana was pulling away from Jon because he left. But I admit he\u2019s not so good at explaining. Although I think he experienced too much disbelief by that point to ever consider displaying the full story.</p><p>Arya meeting with the hound and giving him a death glare and all was priceless. I loved how he complimented and insulted her at the same time ha ha. And she was definitely flirting with Gendry. <br></p><p>I didn\u2019t really think about this ship before, but it could be cute. <br></p><p>Can\u2019t wait for him and Jon to see how badass she really is though.</p><p>And of course, that reunion with Jon was utterly adorable. Her chuckling and throwing herself into his arms, running so she could be hugging him faster. And how he saw she still had needle.</p><p>It was adorable how she defended Sansa. And I loved their hug and joy to see each other again. I couldn\u2019t help but notice the way Arya flinched when he asked if she used needle. <br></p><p>I bet she\u2019s worried about what he\u2019s gonna think if he learns the truth. Him more than others.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t care less about Cersei and her fucking Euron. <br></p><p>But Yara headbutting her brother for leaving her to potentially die felt great. I hope this is finally the time for him to grow a pair (pun kinda intended, sorry).</p><p>Jon and Dany. I don\u2019t mind but I don\u2019t care much yet. But that scene with Jon flying was great and a bit funny. Him panicking was so precious ha ha. <br></p><p>The moment where Dany goes to thank Sam for saving Jorah, I was smiling like a dork. I loved how she praised him and all, but when it turned out she burnt his father and brother.</p><p>I totally forgot about that, tbh. It was rough. She wanted to thank him but it went awry. And that urged him to reveal the truth to Jon.</p><p>Well, he asked Bran to do it and Bran said he was not Bran again so he had to. I\u2019m mocking a bit because so far Bran has been staring at people from afar and it has been like that for a while. It\u2019s kind of funny.</p><p>The reveal was great frankly. Jon being distraught over it and Sam being hurt so he\u2019s trying to convince him to take the throne for himself. Ugh. All the emotions. I laughed though that he got everything in the end, BUT the fact he slept with his aunt.</p><p>Can\u2019t wait for what\u2019s next. Oh and I was very happy to see Tormund survive. (The \u201che\u2019s got blue eyes\u201d moment killed me. Those morons, ha ha). And many interactions were interesting. <br></p><p>Sansa and Tyrion meeting again too. Many possibilities with everyone in the same place. I\u2019m intrigued for the possible pairings. (And I wanna see Arya and Jon fight together frankly). <br></p><p>We could have had something great from Bran and Jaimie, but of course, he doesn\u2019t care since he\u2019s the Three Eyed Raven now. I\u2019m sorry, i have to roll my eyes at this a bit.</p><p><b>8x02 -</b> Okay, so there is not so much to say about the second episode either, because of course they cut it right before we dive into the big battle. I\u2019m waiting to see what\u2019s next btw, because, even though now the following episode is out, BF and I are planning to buy a new TV with OLED technology, if you know about it. <br></p><p>And yeah\u2026 I want some dragons in big HD ! So i\u2019m willing to wait.</p><p>Jaime finally coming to Winterfell was great, because I was thrilled last season when he finally left Cersei\u2019s ass. It was about time frankly ! But we got another chapter of Bran staring at people and saying uncomfortable things once more ha ha.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at that \u201cthings we do for love\u201d. Jaime must have thought he was trying to make him feel guilty, when really, he doesn\u2019t give two shits about it. Bran is not Bran anymore, he\u2019ll say it again.</p><p>I loved Arya and Gendry scenes this episode. I didn\u2019t ship it before, but i kind like the idea and mostly, Gendry being all flustered and going to make the weapon right away after Arya showed him her throwing skills.</p><p>God, i love her so much. Seeing her having a sex scene for once was weird, but mostly because it\u2019s never been Arya\u2019s purpose. Aside from that, I didn\u2019t mind it. She\u2019s all grown up.</p><p>And also, I loved how she interrogated him, assassin\u2019s style, and then was so bossy. I also love how he was looking at her with such adoration. Yeah, a total badass loves you. <br></p><p>Also, thank god Tormund came back ! I couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughing though when he mentioned Brienne and I remembered he had a tremendous crush about her ha ha. <br></p><p>Sorry, but I think she has one on Jaime, not you. <br></p><p>I also love to see the dynamic between the two Lannister\u2019s brothers back. I loved that Tyrion wasn\u2019t afraid to speak up to him and tell him that he did knew who Cersei was. He was just too infatuated at the time to even think about leaving her.</p><p>Also, i always was fond of the idea of Brienne and Jaime, so seeing him making her a knight had me all kinds of emotional. It was so adorable frankly and everyone chanting and her being so touched. Ugh. Kill me now. They\u2019re cute too.</p><p>I probably rolled my eyes at Dany though. Could you please stop spitting on your Hand ? I mean okay, he makes mistakes, but so do you ! And frankly, she\u2019s annoying me most of the time now. <br></p><p>Also, I don\u2019t care for her and Jon being together, so there must be that. I don\u2019t like how she\u2019s answering to his revelation. I\u2019m not sure this is gonna end well, and mostly, she never even offered for them to take the throne together. <br></p><p>I think, even though I don\u2019t care for their relationship, that it could be a great balance somehow. Because Jon is too soft and she\u2019s too harsh sometimes. So both on the throne ? I don\u2019t see why not.</p><p>Also, I bet she\u2019s gonna be mistrustful of him, even though he confessed everything when he could have easily avoid it. He barely gave himself time to think about it before telling her, so\u2026 I feel i\u2019m gonna roll my eyes often. Can we please skip to big battles instead ?</p><p>BUT. Dany and Sansa trying to bond for Jon and ending up being even more at odds made me laugh so hard. I just can\u2019t, it\u2019s ridiculous ha ha.</p><p>I loved seeing Gilly again and how she convinced that kid to go to the crypts to be safe was super sweet really.</p><p>I also love how Sam stood up for himself and told them off about killing a white walker and protecting Gilly and all. And the comment on him stealing a bunch of books. Ha ha. I love you adorable dork who evolved, no matter what people are saying, you\u2019re a gem.</p><p>Honourable mention to that replica by the end though \u201cI was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister\u201d. Ha ha. It killed me.</p><p>Sam giving his family sword to Jorah was inevitable and felt right somehow. <br></p><p>And now, we\u2019re diving into the biggest battle ever ! I can\u2019t wait to come back from my trip to buy that big ass TV and watch this in awe. Also, it\u2019s weird to think there is only four episodes left.</p><p><b>8x03 -</b> Okay so, obviously I liked the battle very much. It was really beautiful to see with my new TV, I don\u2019t regret waiting.</p><p>But, I have to admit, I was a bit surprised it ended in an episode. So much that I kept waiting for the deads to attack again until the season finale. It never happened, so I wonder why they made such a fuzz for seasons only to resolve this in an hour and a half ? <br></p><p>I guess I never thought the final boss of GOT would be Cersei. Sure, she was one of the last problems, but I didn\u2019t think she would be it. <br></p><p>Anyway, it was still a rough battle with many casualties. And even the ones in the crypt got a little action (I think I yelled at Sansa to use that freaking knife, but she ended up safe anyway. I swear, she could at least try a bit. She barely got it out).</p><p>I was scared shitless for Arya a bunch of times. But how great was that she was battling fiercely when older ones stayed hidden ? But the minute the hound sees her, he goes after her to save her.</p><p>I love their dynamic frankly. Weirdest brotp but I dig it. <br></p><p>I loved those references at old Arya\u00a0 quotes that they made. And how she went to attack the Night King. When he caught her by the throat, I was worried. I thought her dropping the knife was because she was being strangled. <br></p><p>But then she took it back lower and got him right in the guts. I was cheering like hell. Damn, my girl, you looked hella cool. <br></p><p>I mean, Arya Stark is the one who put an end to all this. I\u2019m just so proud of her. God. <br></p><p><b>8x04 - </b>Arya Stark, hero of Winterfell. It has a great ring to it.</p><p>How cute was lovestruck Gendry, searching for Arya ? I was glad Dany told him he was now a lord. But when he went to see Arya and started declaring his love and asking her to be his lady\u2026</p><p>I knew she was gonna turn him down.

So, of course, she loves Gendry.</p><p>But she\u2019s not gonna change who she is because of him.

I will review each episode.</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>8x01 -</b> So the first one was a bit uneventful regarding the threat and all, but it was very much needed in terms of reunions.</p><p>I loved how Arya was in the crowd at first and how her face changed upon seeing her brother, then the hound, then Gendry. Ha ha. I laughed because I totally forgot she had not only one reunion to have but three.</p><p>Sansa and Daenerys bickering was fun. Especially since Dany\u2019s harsh comments to Sansa made my day. I don\u2019t like Dany much anymore, but still better than Sansa.</p><p>No offence to those who do like her, of course. <br></p><p>Her comment about dragon eating anything was savage ha ha.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like that Lyana was pulling away from Jon because he left. But I admit he\u2019s not so good at explaining. Although I think he experienced too much disbelief by that point to ever consider displaying the full story.</p><p>Arya meeting with the hound and giving him a death glare and all was priceless. I loved how he complimented and insulted her at the same time ha ha. And she was definitely flirting with Gendry. <br></p><p>I didn\u2019t really think about this ship before, but it could be cute. <br></p><p>Can\u2019t wait for him and Jon to see how badass she really is though.</p><p>And of course, that reunion with Jon was utterly adorable. Her chuckling and throwing herself into his arms, running so she could be hugging him faster. And how he saw she still had needle.</p><p>It was adorable how she defended Sansa. And I loved their hug and joy to see each other again. I couldn\u2019t help but notice the way Arya flinched when he asked if she used needle. <br></p><p>I bet she\u2019s worried about what he\u2019s gonna think if he learns the truth. Him more than others.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t care less about Cersei and her fucking Euron. <br></p><p>But Yara headbutting her brother for leaving her to potentially die felt great. I hope this is finally the time for him to grow a pair (pun kinda intended, sorry).</p><p>Jon and Dany. I don\u2019t mind but I don\u2019t care much yet. But that scene with Jon flying was great and a bit funny. Him panicking was so precious ha ha. <br></p><p>The moment where Dany goes to thank Sam for saving Jorah, I was smiling like a dork. I loved how she praised him and all, but when it turned out she burnt his father and brother.</p><p>I totally forgot about that, tbh. It was rough. She wanted to thank him but it went awry. And that urged him to reveal the truth to Jon.</p><p>Well, he asked Bran to do it and Bran said he was not Bran again so he had to. I\u2019m mocking a bit because so far Bran has been staring at people from afar and it has been like that for a while. It\u2019s kind of funny.</p><p>The reveal was great frankly. Jon being distraught over it and Sam being hurt so he\u2019s trying to convince him to take the throne for himself. Ugh. All the emotions. I laughed though that he got everything in the end, BUT the fact he slept with his aunt.</p><p>Can\u2019t wait for what\u2019s next. Oh and I was very happy to see Tormund survive. (The \u201che\u2019s got blue eyes\u201d moment killed me. Those morons, ha ha). And many interactions were interesting. <br></p><p>Sansa and Tyrion meeting again too. Many possibilities with everyone in the same place. I\u2019m intrigued for the possible pairings. (And I wanna see Arya and Jon fight together frankly). <br></p><p>We could have had something great from Bran and Jaimie, but of course, he doesn\u2019t care since he\u2019s the Three Eyed Raven now. I\u2019m sorry, i have to roll my eyes at this a bit.</p><p><b>8x02 -</b> Okay, so there is not so much to say about the second episode either, because of course they cut it right before we dive into the big battle. I\u2019m waiting to see what\u2019s next btw, because, even though now the following episode is out, BF and I are planning to buy a new TV with OLED technology, if you know about it. <br></p><p>And yeah\u2026 I want some dragons in big HD ! So i\u2019m willing to wait.</p><p>Jaime finally coming to Winterfell was great, because I was thrilled last season when he finally left Cersei\u2019s ass. It was about time frankly ! But we got another chapter of Bran staring at people and saying uncomfortable things once more ha ha.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at that \u201cthings we do for love\u201d. Jaime must have thought he was trying to make him feel guilty, when really, he doesn\u2019t give two shits about it. Bran is not Bran anymore, he\u2019ll say it again.</p><p>I loved Arya and Gendry scenes this episode. I didn\u2019t ship it before, but i kind like the idea and mostly, Gendry being all flustered and going to make the weapon right away after Arya showed him her throwing skills.</p><p>God, i love her so much. Seeing her having a sex scene for once was weird, but mostly because it\u2019s never been Arya\u2019s purpose. Aside from that, I didn\u2019t mind it. She\u2019s all grown up.</p><p>And also, I loved how she interrogated him, assassin\u2019s style, and then was so bossy. I also love how he was looking at her with such adoration. Yeah, a total badass loves you. <br></p><p>Also, thank god Tormund came back ! I couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughing though when he mentioned Brienne and I remembered he had a tremendous crush about her ha ha. <br></p><p>Sorry, but I think she has one on Jaime, not you. <br></p><p>I also love to see the dynamic between the two Lannister\u2019s brothers back. I loved that Tyrion wasn\u2019t afraid to speak up to him and tell him that he did knew who Cersei was. He was just too infatuated at the time to even think about leaving her.</p><p>Also, i always was fond of the idea of Brienne and Jaime, so seeing him making her a knight had me all kinds of emotional. It was so adorable frankly and everyone chanting and her being so touched. Ugh. Kill me now. They\u2019re cute too.</p><p>I probably rolled my eyes at Dany though. Could you please stop spitting on your Hand ? I mean okay, he makes mistakes, but so do you ! And frankly, she\u2019s annoying me most of the time now. <br></p><p>Also, I don\u2019t care for her and Jon being together, so there must be that. I don\u2019t like how she\u2019s answering to his revelation. I\u2019m not sure this is gonna end well, and mostly, she never even offered for them to take the throne together. <br></p><p>I think, even though I don\u2019t care for their relationship, that it could be a great balance somehow. Because Jon is too soft and she\u2019s too harsh sometimes. So both on the throne ? I don\u2019t see why not.</p><p>Also, I bet she\u2019s gonna be mistrustful of him, even though he confessed everything when he could have easily avoid it. He barely gave himself time to think about it before telling her, so\u2026 I feel i\u2019m gonna roll my eyes often. Can we please skip to big battles instead ?</p><p>BUT. Dany and Sansa trying to bond for Jon and ending up being even more at odds made me laugh so hard. I just can\u2019t, it\u2019s ridiculous ha ha.</p><p>I loved seeing Gilly again and how she convinced that kid to go to the crypts to be safe was super sweet really.</p><p>I also love how Sam stood up for himself and told them off about killing a white walker and protecting Gilly and all. And the comment on him stealing a bunch of books. Ha ha. I love you adorable dork who evolved, no matter what people are saying, you\u2019re a gem.</p><p>Honourable mention to that replica by the end though \u201cI was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister\u201d. Ha ha. It killed me.</p><p>Sam giving his family sword to Jorah was inevitable and felt right somehow. <br></p><p>And now, we\u2019re diving into the biggest battle ever ! I can\u2019t wait to come back from my trip to buy that big ass TV and watch this in awe. Also, it\u2019s weird to think there is only four episodes left.</p><p><b>8x03 -</b> Okay so, obviously I liked the battle very much. It was really beautiful to see with my new TV, I don\u2019t regret waiting.</p><p>But, I have to admit, I was a bit surprised it ended in an episode. So much that I kept waiting for the deads to attack again until the season finale. It never happened, so I wonder why they made such a fuzz for seasons only to resolve this in an hour and a half ? <br></p><p>I guess I never thought the final boss of GOT would be Cersei. Sure, she was one of the last problems, but I didn\u2019t think she would be it. <br></p><p>Anyway, it was still a rough battle with many casualties. And even the ones in the crypt got a little action (I think I yelled at Sansa to use that freaking knife, but she ended up safe anyway. I swear, she could at least try a bit. She barely got it out).</p><p>I was scared shitless for Arya a bunch of times. But how great was that she was battling fiercely when older ones stayed hidden ? But the minute the hound sees her, he goes after her to save her.</p><p>I love their dynamic frankly. Weirdest brotp but I dig it. <br></p><p>I loved those references at old Arya\u00a0 quotes that they made. And how she went to attack the Night King. When he caught her by the throat, I was worried. I thought her dropping the knife was because she was being strangled. <br></p><p>But then she took it back lower and got him right in the guts. I was cheering like hell. Damn, my girl, you looked hella cool. <br></p><p>I mean, Arya Stark is the one who put an end to all this. I\u2019m just so proud of her. God. <br></p><p><b>8x04 - </b>Arya Stark, hero of Winterfell. It has a great ring to it.</p><p>How cute was lovestruck Gendry, searching for Arya ? I was glad Dany told him he was now a lord. But when he went to see Arya and started declaring his love and asking her to be his lady\u2026</p><p>I knew she was gonna turn him down. And I\u2019m glad they went down that route, because it is true to Arya, imo. She was never a lady. It was not her purpose. So, of course, she loves Gendry.</p><p>But she\u2019s not gonna change who she is because of him. And I love it.</p><p>Brienne, Jaimie and Tyrion in a drinking game felt like the beginning of a joke ha ha. But I was a bit sad when she fled after the statement about her being a virgin. <br></p><p>Still, it was nice to see Jaimie and her finally acting on that attraction. But I couldn\u2019t help but want to hug Tormund who finally understood he had no chance with her. Ha ha. Poor guy, finally seeing the truth.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care much for Sansa\u2019s scene with the hound. But it\u2019s still an interesting enough dynamic somehow. <br></p><p>Dany and Jon fighting over whether Jon could tell his secret to his sisters had me rolling my eyes a bit. I mean, you know Jon is not gonna be able to keep anything from Arya.</p><p>Sansa, sure. But Arya ? That girl got skills, she would absolutely figure out something\u2019s up at least.</p><p>But it annoyed me even more to see Sansa being so reluctant to swear before being told. Okay, you\u2019re distrustful of Dany, and I also get why. But, if Jon is asking, why keep fighting it ? <br></p><p>I was glad Arya promised first though. You know she loves and trusts Jon so much. And she still voiced her concerns to him, which is good.</p><p>I loved that moment of brotp between Tormund and Jon.</p><p>And also, Jon and Sam. They actually said they were best friends. That\u2019s so stupidly adorable. And I was thrilled to see Sam and Gilly having a child.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a boy, we want to name him Jon\u201d \u201cI hope it\u2019s a girl\u201d. Ha ha.<br></p><p>Also, Arya and the Hound heading to King\u2019s Landing together. Yeah, we all know what unfinished business you mean Arya. Wouldn\u2019t that have to do with a certain list ?</p><p>(Bronn threatening Tyrion and Jaimie was funny enough.)</p><p>But boy, that secret didn\u2019t take long to spread ha ha. Okay, maybe telling Jon in the first place was a bad idea. I don\u2019t feel he\u2019s good at keeping those.</p><p>But it was only logical it would get out this fast. <br></p><p>And it is true Dany has been taking unnecessary measures for quite a while now. <br></p><p>I was totally down for them marrying and ruling together, even though I don\u2019t care about the ship in itself. But I felt it was a perfect middle ground.</p><p>Only I knew Dany would never admit such a thing. She\u2019s been wanting that throne for quite a while, and she has done terrible things to get to it (let\u2019s not kid ourselves, she wasn\u2019t always in her right and compassionate mind). Why would she want to share ?</p><p>I was a bit salty they never tried to talk to her about the option though. <br></p><p>And of course, Cersei had to be a cunt and kill Missandei. I knew she was a goner, but still was sad to see her die.</p><p><b>8x05 -</b> Seeing Daenerys, not eating, not leaving her chambers, and feeling like Jon betrayed her by telling his secret was a bit annoying.</p><p>I feel she\u2019s descending into mad king mode, and it\u2019s a shame frankly. Because we\u2019ve been told for seasons (by none other than her) that she\u2019s not her father. And to state such a thing for so long, only to have her prove everybody else right in the end ? It\u2019s really sad and it feels like it was all for nothing.</p><p>She\u2019s losing it. She\u2019s only seeing her goal and is willing to shed far more blood than she has to. I don\u2019t like what she\u2019s becoming, frankly. I haven\u2019t for a while now.</p><p>But it\u2019s far more advanced as the season is closing.</p><p>I\u2019m still cringing over the fact Jaimie went back to Cersei. I know Tyrion sent him with a plan, but that last scene with Brienne told me he was still hung up on her. But I still hold on to the hope he went there to end it.</p><p>I\u2019m still thinking about the prophecy, so\u2026</p><p>I liked the beginning of the attack. It was great seeing the Hound finally fighting his brother. And I\u2019m also glad Arya chose to flee and live. She also has to know when it\u2019s time to run.</p><p>And of course, Dany lost it and attacked even though they rang the bells. Great, so I was right. Mad king mode it is. Thanks for that useless circle.</p><p>I was also very disappointed with how Cersei was killed. Where is the prophecy ? Did they consider Jaimie failing to find an exit was him killing her ? Because otherwise, I don\u2019t see it.</p><p>She was like the final antagonist of that show. And they took her out with a building collapsing on her ? Well, I expected more frankly.</p><p>Also, I feared for Arya a bunch of times, but I\u2019m glad her plot armour is still going strong enough. But boy, it reminded me of that time she was chased down by the waif. She had it hard again.<br></p><p><b>8x06 -</b> I really liked that conversation Jon had with Tyrion. Like he knows deep down what she did wasn\u2019t right at all, but he still loves her so much he\u2019s conflicted. <br></p><p>Don\u2019t be dumb, Jon. She\u2019s went down the bad road and you know it.</p><p>I loved how they played it even if I wished they never went there in the first place. But since they did, I liked the last interaction they had and how you can slowly see Jon trying to convince her, only to understand more and more how far she is into this.</p><p>And then he killed her.</p><p>The fact Tyrion was forced into being the hand of Bran, chosen king of the seven kingdoms baffles me. I mean, imo, he barely helped and I couldn\u2019t care for his Three Eyed Raven thing, because most of the time, he just seemed MIA.</p><p>But well, why not ? I\u2019m not feeling this ending already anyway.</p><p>Also, Jon Snow being sentenced to be in the Night\u2019s Watch felt very coming into circles again. What\u2019s the point ?</p><p>But Arya going to West of Westeros like she said she would was very satisfying. At least, she got a good ending. I\u2019m still salty about all the rest, but I\u2019m glad my favourite came out the good way.</p><p>(It might have felt a bit easy but I\u2019ll take it)</p><p>The little counsel reunion in the end made me scoff. It was silly and stupid. Those dorks are never gonna work properly together without bickering ha ha.</p><p>Sansa being crowned Queen in the North. Yeah why not, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s anyone else. But she didn\u2019t do much, imo.</p><p>I didn\u2019t really dislike that season. But it didn\u2019t feel like a real ending. I feel they could have cut some things and do so much more. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because it\u2019s a big show, but I expected more.</p><p>Well, anyway, goodbye Game of Thrones. It was still a nice ride.<br></p>",

Damn, my girl, you looked hella cool. <br /></p><p>I mean, Arya Stark is the one who put an end to all this. I&rsquo;m just so proud of her. God. <br /></p><p><b>8x04 - </b>Arya Stark, hero of Winterfell. It has a great ring to it.</p><p>How cute was lovestruck Gendry, searching for Arya ? I was glad Dany told him he was now a lord. But when he went to see Arya and started declaring his love and asking her to be his lady&hellip;</p><p>I knew she was gonna turn him down. And I&rsquo;m glad they went down that route, because it is true to Arya, imo. She was never a lady. It was not her purpose. So, of course, she loves Gendry.</p><p>But she&rsquo;s not gonna change who she is because of him. And I love it.</p><p>Brienne, Jaimie and Tyrion in a drinking game felt like the beginning of a joke ha ha. But I was a bit sad when she fled after the statement about her being a virgin. <br /></p><p>Still, it was nice to see Jaimie and her finally acting on that attraction. But I couldn&rsquo;t help but want to hug Tormund who finally understood he had no chance with her. Ha ha. Poor guy, finally seeing the truth.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t care much for Sansa&rsquo;s scene with the hound. But it&rsquo;s still an interesting enough dynamic somehow. <br /></p><p>Dany and Jon fighting over whether Jon could tell his secret to his sisters had me rolling my eyes a bit. I mean, you know Jon is not gonna be able to keep anything from Arya.</p><p>Sansa, sure. But Arya ? That girl got skills, she would absolutely figure out something&rsquo;s up at least.</p><p>But it annoyed me even more to see Sansa being so reluctant to swear before being told. Okay, you&rsquo;re distrustful of Dany, and I also get why. But, if Jon is asking, why keep fighting it ? <br /></p><p>I was glad Arya promised first though. You know she loves and trusts Jon so much. And she still voiced her concerns to him, which is good.</p><p>I loved that moment of brotp between Tormund and Jon.</p><p>And also, Jon and Sam. They actually said they were best friends. That&rsquo;s so stupidly adorable. And I was thrilled to see Sam and Gilly having a child.</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a boy, we want to name him Jon&rdquo; &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s a girl&rdquo;. Ha ha.<br /></p><p>Also, Arya and the Hound heading to King&rsquo;s Landing together. Yeah, we all know what unfinished business you mean Arya. Wouldn&rsquo;t that have to do with a certain list ?</p><p>(Bronn threatening Tyrion and Jaimie was funny enough.)</p><p>But boy, that secret didn&rsquo;t take long to spread ha ha. Okay, maybe telling Jon in the first place was a bad idea. I don&rsquo;t feel he&rsquo;s good at keeping those.</p><p>But it was only logical it would get out this fast. <br /></p><p>And it is true Dany has been taking unnecessary measures for quite a while now. <br /></p><p>I was totally down for them marrying and ruling together, even though I don&rsquo;t care about the ship in itself. But I felt it was a perfect middle ground.</p><p>Only I knew Dany would never admit such a thing. She&rsquo;s been wanting that throne for quite a while, and she has done terrible things to get to it (let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves, she wasn&rsquo;t always in her right and compassionate mind). Why would she want to share ?</p><p>I was a bit salty they never tried to talk to her about the option though. <br /></p><p>And of course, Cersei had to be a cunt and kill Missandei. I knew she was a goner, but still was sad to see her die.</p><p><b>8x05 -</b> Seeing Daenerys, not eating, not leaving her chambers, and feeling like Jon betrayed her by telling his secret was a bit annoying.</p><p>I feel she&rsquo;s descending into mad king mode, and it&rsquo;s a shame frankly. Because we&rsquo;ve been told for seasons (by none other than her) that she&rsquo;s not her father. And to state such a thing for so long, only to have her prove everybody else right in the end ? It&rsquo;s really sad and it feels like it was all for nothing.</p><p>She&rsquo;s losing it. She&rsquo;s only seeing her goal and is willing to shed far more blood than she has to. I don&rsquo;t like what she&rsquo;s becoming, frankly. I haven&rsquo;t for a while now.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s far more advanced as the season is closing.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still cringing over the fact Jaimie went back to Cersei. I know Tyrion sent him with a plan, but that last scene with Brienne told me he was still hung up on her. But I still hold on to the hope he went there to end it.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still thinking about the prophecy, so&hellip;</p><p>I liked the beginning of the attack. It was great seeing the Hound finally fighting his brother. And I&rsquo;m also glad Arya chose to flee and live. She also has to know when it&rsquo;s time to run.</p><p>And of course, Dany lost it and attacked even though they rang the bells. Great, so I was right. Mad king mode it is. Thanks for that useless circle.</p><p>I was also very disappointed with how Cersei was killed. Where is the prophecy ? Did they consider Jaimie failing to find an exit was him killing her ? Because otherwise, I don&rsquo;t see it.</p><p>She was like the final antagonist of that show. And they took her out with a building collapsing on her ? Well, I expected more frankly.</p><p>Also, I feared for Arya a bunch of times, but I&rsquo;m glad her plot armour is still going strong enough. But boy, it reminded me of that time she was chased down by the waif. She had it hard again.<br /></p><p><b>8x06 -</b> I really liked that conversation Jon had with Tyrion. Like he knows deep down what she did wasn&rsquo;t right at all, but he still loves her so much he&rsquo;s conflicted. <br /></p><p>Don&rsquo;t be dumb, Jon. She&rsquo;s went down the bad road and you know it.</p><p>I loved how they played it even if I wished they never went there in the first place. But since they did, I liked the last interaction they had and how you can slowly see Jon trying to convince her, only to understand more and more how far she is into this.</p><p>And then he killed her.</p><p>The fact Tyrion was forced into being the hand of Bran, chosen king of the seven kingdoms baffles me. I mean, imo, he barely helped and I couldn&rsquo;t care for his Three Eyed Raven thing, because most of the time, he just seemed MIA.</p><p>But well, why not ? I&rsquo;m not feeling this ending already anyway.</p><p>Also, Jon Snow being sentenced to be in the Night&rsquo;s Watch felt very coming into circles again. What&rsquo;s the point ?</p><p>But Arya going to West of Westeros like she said she would was very satisfying. At least, she got a good ending. I&rsquo;m still salty about all the rest, but I&rsquo;m glad my favourite came out the good way.</p><p>(It might have felt a bit easy but I&rsquo;ll take it)</p><p>The little counsel reunion in the end made me scoff. It was silly and stupid. Those dorks are never gonna work properly together without bickering ha ha.</p><p>Sansa being crowned Queen in the North. Yeah why not, it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s anyone else. But she didn&rsquo;t do much, imo.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t really dislike that season. But it didn&rsquo;t feel like a real ending. I feel they could have cut some things and do so much more. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a big show, but I expected more.</p><p>Well, anyway, goodbye Game of Thrones. It was still a nice ride.<br /></p>",
