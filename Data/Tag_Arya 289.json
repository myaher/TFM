She has an older sister, Sansa Stark. She also has an older brother, Robb, two younger brothers, Bran and Rickon and a &ldquo;bastard half-brother&rdquo;, Jon Snow.\n\n<b>Arya </b>rejects the notion that she must become a lady and marry for influence and power. Instead, she believes that she can forge her own destiny. She is fascinated by warfare and training in the use of arms, and is bored by embroidery and other &ldquo;lady-like&rdquo; pursuits. She takes after her father and has a quarrelsome relationship with her sister Sansa, due to their contrasting interests and personalities. She is close to her &ldquo;half-brother&rdquo; Jon, who is also something of an outsider.</p><p>After narrowly escaping the persecution of House Stark by House Lannister, <b>Arya </b>is trained as a Faceless Man at the House of Black and White in Braavos, and uses her new skills to bring those who have wronged her family to justice. <br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1810\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img data-orig-height=\"1810\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5ba66a4bc966170fba70e74e066f7f61/tumblr_inline_pewd0cw4Ux1qbv7u8_540.jpg\"/></figure><h2><b><i>Appearance and Personality</i></b></h2><p><b>Arya Stark</b> is a tomboyish girl who likes fighting and exploring, unlike her older sister Sansa Stark. Her fierce temperament is often discouraged by Septa Mordane. She is left-handed, skinny and fast. With her dark hair, grey eyes and long stern face, <b>Arya </b>resembles more of a Stark than a Tully, despite all her siblings. Jon Snow, her half-brother, is the other one of the Stark children who have more of a Stark appearance. The bastard son of her father is also the sibling she likes the most. She is very good at mathematics and horse riding.</p><p>Her behavior and appearance makes people often mistake her for a boy. <b>Arya </b>is wild, adventurous, unpredictable and extremely willful. She absolutely hates the feminine expectations pressed upon her, in which her older sister Sansa absolutely thrives, and neither aspires in needlework or womanly graces as she does. <b>Arya </b>is incredibly spirited and very brave when need be, and completely capable of fighting for herself when she is backed into a corner. She is often quick to anger in some situations, but is also a fast learner in her own right and can quickly adapt to her own situation.</p><p>What largely motivates <b>Arya </b>throughout the War of the Five Kings is vengeance: for her father, for her friend, for the injustices that have befallen her family. <b>Arya </b>has fallen into the obsessive habit of reciting the names of the people she intends to kill before she goes to sleep, and when she encounters certain people she has intended to kill she can often become reckless and frightfully violent, as evidenced by her brutal killing of the Tickler during the brawl at the crossroads inn.</p><p><b>Arya </b>longs to be reunited with her surviving family, and is devastated by all those she loses. She has slowly become withdrawn and very introverted throughout her experiences.</p><p><b>\n\nArya </b>can be a rather cold-blooded, slightly sadistic person at times, especially while confronting and killing those who are on her death list. Though she was initially apathetic but satisfied with killing Meryn Trant and Polliver, she did not attempt to hide her glee over slitting Walder Frey&rsquo;s throat. While she certainly possesses compassion and kindness, her time with The Hound and the Faceless Men have taught her to be ruthless to those who have wronged her and her family and has shown to be willing to use psychological mind games to worsen her enemies fate before killing them. Shown when she repeated every word Polliver said to Lommy before killing him in the same exact way with Needle; gouged the eyes of Ser Meryn before stabbing him repeatedly and butchering Lord Walder&rsquo;s sons before serving their corpses to their father inside of a pie.\u00a0</p><p>That being said, <b>Arya </b>is not completely blinded by hate. After learning that her family has retaken Winterfell, she ultimately chooses reuniting with her loved ones over vengeance against her enemies.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1067\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img data-orig-height=\"1067\" data-orig-width=\"800\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c18d222783434f75625ea1cf73f2811a/tumblr_inline_pewd0yuM141qbv7u8_540.jpg\"/></figure><h2><b><i>Skills</i></b></h2><p>Even before she left Winterfell, <b>Arya </b>showed promising skills in martial pursuits such as archery, being able to hit a target from a long distance. Eventually, after receiving training from Syrio Forel and later from the Faceless Men, <b>Arya </b>increased her skills tremendously, being able to master the water dancing style to such an extent that she was able not only to dodge a punch from a much larger man but also to kill the much older and powerful Waif and fight on equal terms with Brienne of Tarth, one of the best warriors in Westeros.</p><p><b>Arya </b>also possesses a keen analytical mind and good acting skills, being able to perfectly emulate those whose face she is wearing while putting her Faceless Men training into practice.</p><p>In addition, she is proficient in infiltration, capable of sneaking undetected to The Twins Castle and claimed to be able to do the same through Winterfell Castle. This is presumed to be another skill learned through the Faceless Men training, though it was never shown in the show.</p><p><b>Arya </b>is relatively resistant to pain despite her small stature, capable to outrun and later defeat a skilled assassin in spite of severe stab wounds.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"768\"><img data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"768\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/32de7ca5c5e4e5accedb53709f1cd71a/tumblr_inline_pewd1cHMSo1qbv7u8_540.jpg\"/></figure><h2><b><i>Kill List</i></b></h2><ul><li><b>Cersei Lannister</b> - For her role in the execution of her father and the death of Lady.<br/></li><li><b>The Mountain</b> - For leading the brutal torture at Harrenhal.
