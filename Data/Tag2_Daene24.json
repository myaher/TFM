It\u2019s a ceremony they do when a khaleesi is expecting a child. If she eats the whole heart and doesn\u2019t throw any of it up then that means the unborn child is going to be strong. And if she can\u2019t finish it or throws any of it up then it\u2019s a bad sign. And honestly you don\u2019t know how you feel about her having a baby with the khal. You don\u2019t know if this affects anything with you getting the throne. </p><p>You stand and listen to the chanting and listen to Viserys and Ser Jorah having their own conversation on the side. When she finishes the heart you see that she bends down and looks like she\u2019s about to throw it up. You lean in closer watching what was going to go down. Deep down you wish she would throw it up. But when she lifts her head she swallows hard and they start chanting again. You want to feel happy for her but you can\u2019t you don\u2019t. Her having a son means everything. </p><p>\u201cA prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rheago!\u201d Daenerys says as she stands up with pride. </p><p>\u201cRheago! Rheago!\u201d The people chant only causing you to feel some certain way. You look over at Aegon who is already looking at you and he has the same reaction as you. And then you turn to see Viserys who seems to be lost in his own thoughts but by his frown it seems he\u2019s thinking the same thing as you and Aegon. </p><p>\u201cThey love her.\u201d You hear Viserys say beside you. She\u2019s beginning to be a threat not only to Viserys but to Aegon and you. Before you can muster up a fake smile to Daenerys way, you feel yourself getting pulled outside. </p><p>You look to the person who\u2019s pulling you and you weren\u2019t suprised that it was Viserys. You try to pull your arm from his grip but his grip his hard around your arm. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d You yell at him as he drags you. He ignored you and continued walking and you kept struggling to be let go from his grip. \u201cViserys!\u201d You try to get his attention but he still ignores you. It\u2019s not until you get to your shared tent where he lets go and he gets his weapons. He grabs your weapons to and throws them to your feet. \u201cViserys What In seven hells are you doing!!\u201d You yell at him. This time he whips his head to your direction. You notice the look he has in his eyes. It didn\u2019t scare you but it wasn\u2019t a good or happy look.  </p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like im doing we\u2019re leaving!\u201d He yells the anger in his voice very clear. You furrow your eyebrows and walk closer to him. You couldn\u2019t leave not yet you still needed their army even if Daenerys was beginning to be a threat you still needed their army to get back what rightfully belongs to Aegon and you. </p><p>\u201cNo we still need them we can\u2019t leave now!\u201d You argue but he only laughs and walks over to your dragon egg. You walk over to him and pull his arm as he\u2019s about to grab it. \u201cLeave it there!\u201d He turns and grips on to your arm. </p><p>\u201cHow do you think we\u2019re going to get money to buy my army huh? You Martells aren\u2019t the richest in the seven kingdoms and your army is too small to go into war to get the throne! Without money we can\u2019t get an army!\u201d He argues and goes to grab your egg again but you push him down. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you!\u201d You see the anger in his eyes. It was their before but he seemed angrier it was a deadly look. He stands up and grips onto both of your arms. You can feel his nails dig into your skin. But you don\u2019t wince or get scared of the pain. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife! You do what I say when I say it! And if i say we\u2019re leaving that means we\u2019re leaving! Without you then I don\u2019t have the martells on my side.\u201d He yells at you. You swallowed thickly and had determination in your look. You put on a fake smile and he seemed to be confused. With what little motion you have in your hands you grab his wrists and then lift your knee and knee him in the stomach. He groans in pain and bends down wrapping his arms around his stomach. </p><p>\u201cYou little Bitch!\u201d He yells his face was red now but you still weren\u2019t afraid. You stood tall were you were as he glared up at you. He straightened  himself up. He walked over to you but you didn\u2019t leave or move out of his way instead you stayed there and watched as came closer. He had a smirk on his face as his face got closer to yours. \u201cThat was a huge mistake&hellip;. you are lucky that I can\u2019t kill you because I still need you but you just woke the dragon.\u201d He threatens you. He puts his hand on your throat and begins to squeeze it tightly making it hard for you to breathe. With your hands you grip onto his hand that\u2019s around your neck and try to pull it off but it\u2019s harder then you thought. </p><p>\u201cViserys let her go!\u201d You hear Ser Jorah yell. Viserys whips his head to where he stands. Aegon enters behind him and he sees what\u2019s going and his features turn into an angry scowl. He\u2019s about to grab your weapons that are on the ground but Ser Jorah stops him. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He whispers to Aegon. \u201cViserys let her go now!\u201d Viserys has that same stupid grin on his face but you feel him loosen his grip around your neck and then completely lets go making you fall to the ground. Aegon pushes Ser Jorahs hand out of the way and rushes over to where you were. Before he could check if you were alright he stands in front of Viserys in a challenging stance his hand is in a tight fist. </p><p>\u201cAegon don\u2019t. Remember the law you\u2019re not allowed to spill blood in Vaes Dothrak.\u201d  Ser Jorah warns him. Aegon swallows thickly. You know he wants to kill him for what he was doing but he also respects the rules unlike Viserys. He huffs out in defeat and He finally kneels down to where you were on the floor. Your hands around the offended area and trying to grasp for air. You knew their was going to be a bruise there. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright? He do anything else to you?\u201d He asks in a worried tone. You simply nod and he wraps his arm around your shoulders and picks you up to your feet. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them see you carry a sword in Vaes Dothrak you know the law.\u201d Ser Jorah tells Viserys when he sees his sword and dagger on him. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my law.\u201d Viserys says not caring as he  goes back to your egg and picks it up and puts it in his bag. </p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201d Ser Jorah tells him before you could say anything to Viserys. </p><p>\u201cwhatever is hers is also mine.\u201d Viserys says to him. </p><p>\u201cLeave it where it was Viserys.\u201d Aegon threatens. Viserys just glared at Aegon before turning his gaze back at Ser Jorah. </p><p>\u201cIf I sell one egg I have enough for an army and if sell two out of three Daenerys eggs I\u2019ll have enough for a ship and an army.\u201d Viserys spats. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s four.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI need a large army.\u201d Viserys takes a step closer to Ser Jorah. You want to go and snatch your egg from him but you watch carefully. \u201cI\u2019m the last hope for the dynasty Mormont the greatest dynasty the world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was 5 years old and no one has ever given me what they give to her on that tent. Never not a piece of it. Not even my own wife.\u201d He says his voice breaking slightly as he looks over to you quickly but then returns his gaze back at Mormont. \u201cHow can I carry what I need to carry without it hmm? Who can rule without wealth, fear or love?\u201d </p><p>You\u2019re getting imapatient as you see that Viserys doesn\u2019t drop your egg. But you also are getting to trust Ser Jorah and you know he wouldn\u2019t let him walk out with it. Viserys continues to talk to Ser Jorah in a whisper It  was a small space so you could hear what he told to him. Telling him some truths and now that he points them out and hear it aloud you fully see that they\u2019re true.</p><p>\u201cDoes loyalty mean nothing to you?\u201d Viserys asks Ser Jorah. </p><p>\u201cIt means everything to me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd yet here you stand.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd yet here I stand.\u201d </p><p>Viserys looks over at you and then drops the bag and then he stomps out of the tent. Ser Jorah picks up the bag and walks over to you. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d He asks concerned. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright now thank you Ser Jorah.\u201d You tell him because if he hadn\u2019t entered when he had you didn\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened. He hands the bag over to you and Aegon takes it. Ser Jorah does a small bow. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m loyal to you both and Daenerys. And we\u2019re going to need to talk about we needs to happen about Viserys. He\u2019s not fit to rule.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed.\u201d Aegon says. </p><p>\u201cWe also need to talk about other matters but let\u2019s wait for Daenerys to be with us.\u201d He says and aegons gives him a quick nod in agreement before Ser Jorah leaves. Leaving Aegon and you alone. He turns you and cups your cheeks. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re alright?\u201d He asks again. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d You tell him with a smile on your face. </p><p>\u201cYour marriage to him is going to be annulled I don\u2019t care I know our uncle will understand.\u201d He says his face full with worry. \u201cI wanted to kill him and I still do.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot here not yet.\u201d You say to him. </p><p>\u201cI know but i can\u2019t let him hurt you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t not ever again. But please let\u2019s not talk him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d He says with a warm smile as he pulls you in for a kiss. </p><p>- </p><p>Aegon and you make your way over to the tent where they were going to have the feast. You make it inside and theirs people dancing around the fire. Khal Drogo is drinking and talking with his blood riders in one corner and Daenerys is talking with Ser Jorah and Doreah in another. You notice that her eyes instantly land on your brother Aegon as he comes in by your side. She smiles his way but as you turn to see his reaction it seems like he was trying to avoid her gaze. You can\u2019t help but glare her way.   As you feel the jealousy in you rise. She seemed to notice so she turned her attention back to Daenerys. Not seconds later Daenerys sees you and walks over and she stands up her face full with concern. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what happened.\u201d She says as she stands in front of you. You smile and your hand goes up to your neck where the bruise was already showing. </p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t the one that did it.\u201d You reassure her with a smile. </p><p>\u201cBut my brother did and it wasn\u2019t alright that he did that you he could\u2019ve killed you.\u201d It\u2019s actions like these that make you regret what you think of her. She nothing like her brother and she doesn\u2019t deserve what you think of her. But if she\u2019s a threat then the threat can\u2019t live. it\u2019s something that you\u2019ll have to deal with if you like it or not. But maybe it\u2019s like Ser Jorah said we can talk about what needs to happen next and that\u2019s not only including Viserys. </p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t so please don\u2019t feel guilty for his doings because he sure doesn\u2019t&hellip;&hellip;.and please enough of him we\u2019re in a feast it\u2019s time to enjoy it.\u201d She smiles at your last words and she takes you by the hand to where she was. </p><p>It had seemed that being here in the feast made you forget of what had happened earlier that day. You were talking and laughing along with Daenerys and Ser Jorah. Even if Doreah was there and you couldn\u2019t miss the looks she gave your brother you tried your best not to go over there and drag her into the fire by her hair. But like always It was Aegon that mostly kept you calm he always did. And he was one of the only people that could beside your uncles who were on the other side of the sea. </p><p>Your enjoyment didn\u2019t last as long as you wanted to though. It was ruined at the sound of Viserys stumbling into the tent drunk. </p><p>\u201cDaenerys! Where\u2019s my sister! And my wife!\u201d Viserys yelled from entrance of the tent. The sight of him made you roll your eyes. Aegon stood up and was about to walk over but Ser Jorah stopped him. </p><p>\u201cNo my prince you stay here I\u2019ll go.\u201d See Jorah said to him as he had his arm out to stop him from going any further. </p><p>\u201cHe has his weapons on him I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d Aegon argued. </p><p>\u201cMore of the reason you should stay put especially after what happened earlier. Stay here and guard your sister and Daenerys in case he tries anything.\u201d Aegon is hesitant but he doesn\u2019t follow after Ser Jorah. </p><p>\u201cWhere is she! Where\u2019s my sister! Where\u2019s my wife! I\u2019m here for the feast! The whores feast!\u201d Viserys yelled. Ser Jorah grabbed him by the hand but Viserys pushed it off. </p><p>\u201cGet your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!\u201d Viserys spats at Ser Jorah. One of  khal Drogos blood riders says something and khal Drogo laughs causing Viserys to turn his way. </p><p>\u201cKhal Drogo! I\u2019m here for the feast!\u201d Viserys keeps making his way over. Khal Drogo tells him that he belonged outside but Viserys didn\u2019t understand. After all this time here he still hadn\u2019t learned their language which is ridiculous since he wants them to go to war for him. </p><p>\u201cThat is no place for a king.\u201d Viserys tells him. You watch their interaction carefully. </p><p>\u201cYou are no king.\u201d Khal Drogo says in your common tongue suprising you just a bit. Only making Viserys angrier. When Ser Jorah tried pulling him out he pulled his sword out and had it pointing at him threatening him. </p><p>\u201cViserys please.\u201d Daenerys said to him. </p><p>\u201cThere She is.\u201d Viserys turned his head her way. </p><p>\u201cPut the sword down! They\u2019ll kill us all.\u201d Ser Jorah warned him. </p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t kill us. They can\u2019t shed blood in their sacred city.\u201d He got closer to where you all where. His sword out and pointing at anyone in front of him. Aegon pulled Daenerys and you behind him protectively not letting Viserys sword or himself anywhere nearby. </p><p>- </p><p>(Aegon\u2019s P.O.V)</p><p>At the sight of Viserys stumbling in Drunk and angry Aegons enjoyment died down and was replaced with anger. He wanted to kill him for what he did to his sister but he knew that he couldn\u2019t not here anyway. </p><p>He got in front of his sister and Daenerys protectively to keep them both out of Viserys reach. Daenerys tried to push him to the side but he didn\u2019t let her because he knew that he would hurt her and he couldn\u2019t let that happen. Viserys had a smirk on his face as he put the swords end inches from his neck. </p><p>\u201cI want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you but he never payed for you. Tell him I want what was bargained for or I\u2019m taking you back he can keep the baby. I\u2019ll cut it out and leave it for him.\u201d  Viserys says talking directly to Daenerys who was behind Aegon. Aegon heard what Khal Drogo said and he knew what he meant by it. He was going to get his crown but maybe not the way he would like it. </p><p>\u201cHe says yes you shall have a golden crown that men should should tremble to behold.\u201d Daenerys said from behind him only making Viserys smile and lowering his weapon from in front of his neck. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted what what was promised.\u201d Viserys said. He still had his weopon out but he was distracted so Aegon took this as his chance and grabbed his arm and took his sword and threw it to the ground. Aegon pushed Viserys back but it\u2019s like it didn\u2019t bother him he was to occupied with his crown that was promised. Aegon looked over at khal drogos bloodriders giving them a quick nod telling them that it was okay for them to get close. Once they did they broke his arm and Viserys started to panic. Aegon went to stand by his sister who was standing watching carefully. </p><p>\u201cNo! No! You cannot touch me I\u2019m the dragon! I want my crown!\u201d Viserys yelled in anger. Khal Drogo put his golden belt and put it in burning pot. When Viserys saw his eyes went wide and were full of panic and fear the anger not there no more. </p><p>\u201cDanny! Don\u2019t Dany tell them make them make them!\u201d Viserys yelled trying to save himself but Daenerys didn\u2019t say anything. Aegon noticed that Viserys shifted his gaze over to his sister. </p><p>\u201cY/N? Please! I\u2019m sorry! Please!\u201d He kept pleading. His eyes seemed to grow wider at the sight of Khal Drogo picking the pot up. \u201cDany please!\u201d </p><p>Aegon tried to cover the sight of what was going to happen but his sister only moved so she could see. </p><p>\u201cA crown for a king.\u201d Khal Drogo then poured then melted gold onto Viserys head causing him to fall to the ground. The gold making a big thunk noise as his lifeless body fell. Even if Aegon didn\u2019t like him he couldn\u2019t deny that dying that way was horrible. </p><p>Aegon looked back at his sister to see her reaction but she didn\u2019t seem bothered by it. It seemed like she showed no emotion but unlike Daenerys, he saw that his sister had a slight smirk. He knew that she didn\u2019t like him but it\u2019s also a reaction that he didn\u2019t like to see. Her look looked cold and emotionless. Like if what she had seen was normal. He knew that his sister was more tolerable to things like this but getting your head melted off was something different. And he couldn\u2019t help but feel chills at the sight of her smirk. </p><p>. </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p>",

He had a smirk on his face as his face got closer to yours. \u201cThat was a huge mistake\u2026. you are lucky that I can\u2019t kill you because I still need you but you just woke the dragon.\u201d He threatens you. He puts his hand on your throat and begins to squeeze it tightly making it hard for you to breathe. With your hands you grip onto his hand that\u2019s around your neck and try to pull it off but it\u2019s harder then you thought. </p><p>\u201cViserys let her go!\u201d You hear Ser Jorah yell. Viserys whips his head to where he stands. Aegon enters behind him and he sees what\u2019s going and his features turn into an angry scowl. He\u2019s about to grab your weapons that are on the ground but Ser Jorah stops him. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He whispers to Aegon. \u201cViserys let her go now!\u201d Viserys has that same stupid grin on his face but you feel him loosen his grip around your neck and then completely lets go making you fall to the ground. Aegon pushes Ser Jorahs hand out of the way and rushes over to where you were. Before he could check if you were alright he stands in front of Viserys in a challenging stance his hand is in a tight fist. </p><p>\u201cAegon don\u2019t. Remember the law you\u2019re not allowed to spill blood in Vaes Dothrak.\u201d  Ser Jorah warns him. Aegon swallows thickly. You know he wants to kill him for what he was doing but he also respects the rules unlike Viserys. He huffs out in defeat and He finally kneels down to where you were on the floor. Your hands around the offended area and trying to grasp for air. You knew their was going to be a bruise there. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright? He do anything else to you?\u201d He asks in a worried tone. You simply nod and he wraps his arm around your shoulders and picks you up to your feet. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them see you carry a sword in Vaes Dothrak you know the law.\u201d Ser Jorah tells Viserys when he sees his sword and dagger on him. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my law.\u201d Viserys says not caring as he  goes back to your egg and picks it up and puts it in his bag. </p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201d Ser Jorah tells him before you could say anything to Viserys. </p><p>\u201cwhatever is hers is also mine.\u201d Viserys says to him. </p><p>\u201cLeave it where it was Viserys.\u201d Aegon threatens. Viserys just glared at Aegon before turning his gaze back at Ser Jorah. </p><p>\u201cIf I sell one egg I have enough for an army and if sell two out of three Daenerys eggs I\u2019ll have enough for a ship and an army.\u201d Viserys spats. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s four.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI need a large army.\u201d Viserys takes a step closer to Ser Jorah. You want to go and snatch your egg from him but you watch carefully. \u201cI\u2019m the last hope for the dynasty Mormont the greatest dynasty the world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was 5 years old and no one has ever given me what they give to her on that tent. Never not a piece of it. Not even my own wife.\u201d He says his voice breaking slightly as he looks over to you quickly but then returns his gaze back at Mormont. \u201cHow can I carry what I need to carry without it hmm? Who can rule without wealth, fear or love?\u201d </p><p>You\u2019re getting imapatient as you see that Viserys doesn\u2019t drop your egg. But you also are getting to trust Ser Jorah and you know he wouldn\u2019t let him walk out with it. Viserys continues to talk to Ser Jorah in a whisper It  was a small space so you could hear what he told to him. Telling him some truths and now that he points them out and hear it aloud you fully see that they\u2019re true.</p><p>\u201cDoes loyalty mean nothing to you?\u201d Viserys asks Ser Jorah. </p><p>\u201cIt means everything to me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd yet here you stand.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd yet here I stand.\u201d </p><p>Viserys looks over at you and then drops the bag and then he stomps out of the tent. Ser Jorah picks up the bag and walks over to you. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d He asks concerned. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright now thank you Ser Jorah.\u201d You tell him because if he hadn\u2019t entered when he had you didn\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened. He hands the bag over to you and Aegon takes it. Ser Jorah does a small bow. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m loyal to you both and Daenerys. And we\u2019re going to need to talk about we needs to happen about Viserys. He\u2019s not fit to rule.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed.\u201d Aegon says. </p><p>\u201cWe also need to talk about other matters but let\u2019s wait for Daenerys to be with us.\u201d He says and aegons gives him a quick nod in agreement before Ser Jorah leaves. Leaving Aegon and you alone. He turns you and cups your cheeks. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re alright?\u201d He asks again. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d You tell him with a smile on your face. </p><p>\u201cYour marriage to him is going to be annulled I don\u2019t care I know our uncle will understand.\u201d He says his face full with worry. \u201cI wanted to kill him and I still do.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot here not yet.\u201d You say to him. </p><p>\u201cI know but i can\u2019t let him hurt you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t not ever again. But please let\u2019s not talk him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d He says with a warm smile as he pulls you in for a kiss. </p><p>- </p><p>Aegon and you make your way over to the tent where they were going to have the feast. You make it inside and theirs people dancing around the fire. Khal Drogo is drinking and talking with his blood riders in one corner and Daenerys is talking with Ser Jorah and Doreah in another. You notice that her eyes instantly land on your brother Aegon as he comes in by your side. She smiles his way but as you turn to see his reaction it seems like he was trying to avoid her gaze. You can\u2019t help but glare her way.   As you feel the jealousy in you rise. She seemed to notice so she turned her attention back to Daenerys. Not seconds later Daenerys sees you and walks over and she stands up her face full with concern. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what happened.\u201d She says as she stands in front of you. You smile and your hand goes up to your neck where the bruise was already showing. </p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t the one that did it.\u201d You reassure her with a smile. </p><p>\u201cBut my brother did and it wasn\u2019t alright that he did that you he could\u2019ve killed you.\u201d It\u2019s actions like these that make you regret what you think of her. She nothing like her brother and she doesn\u2019t deserve what you think of her. But if she\u2019s a threat then the threat can\u2019t live. it\u2019s something that you\u2019ll have to deal with if you like it or not. But maybe it\u2019s like Ser Jorah said we can talk about what needs to happen next and that\u2019s not only including Viserys. </p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t so please don\u2019t feel guilty for his doings because he sure doesn\u2019t\u2026\u2026.and please enough of him we\u2019re in a feast it\u2019s time to enjoy it.\u201d She smiles at your last words and she takes you by the hand to where she was. </p><p>It had seemed that being here in the feast made you forget of what had happened earlier that day. You were talking and laughing along with Daenerys and Ser Jorah. Even if Doreah was there and you couldn\u2019t miss the looks she gave your brother you tried your best not to go over there and drag her into the fire by her hair. But like always It was Aegon that mostly kept you calm he always did. And he was one of the only people that could beside your uncles who were on the other side of the sea. </p><p>Your enjoyment didn\u2019t last as long as you wanted to though. It was ruined at the sound of Viserys stumbling into the tent drunk. </p><p>\u201cDaenerys! Where\u2019s my sister! And my wife!\u201d Viserys yelled from entrance of the tent. The sight of him made you roll your eyes. Aegon stood up and was about to walk over but Ser Jorah stopped him. </p><p>\u201cNo my prince you stay here I\u2019ll go.\u201d See Jorah said to him as he had his arm out to stop him from going any further. </p><p>\u201cHe has his weapons on him I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d Aegon argued. </p><p>\u201cMore of the reason you should stay put especially after what happened earlier. Stay here and guard your sister and Daenerys in case he tries anything.\u201d Aegon is hesitant but he doesn\u2019t follow after Ser Jorah. </p><p>\u201cWhere is she! Where\u2019s my sister! Where\u2019s my wife! I\u2019m here for the feast! The whores feast!\u201d Viserys yelled. Ser Jorah grabbed him by the hand but Viserys pushed it off. </p><p>\u201cGet your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!\u201d Viserys spats at Ser Jorah. One of  khal Drogos blood riders says something and khal Drogo laughs causing Viserys to turn his way. </p><p>\u201cKhal Drogo! I\u2019m here for the feast!\u201d Viserys keeps making his way over. Khal Drogo tells him that he belonged outside but Viserys didn\u2019t understand. After all this time here he still hadn\u2019t learned their language which is ridiculous since he wants them to go to war for him. </p><p>\u201cThat is no place for a king.\u201d Viserys tells him. You watch their interaction carefully. </p><p>\u201cYou are no king.\u201d Khal Drogo says in your common tongue suprising you just a bit. Only making Viserys angrier. When Ser Jorah tried pulling him out he pulled his sword out and had it pointing at him threatening him. </p><p>\u201cViserys please.\u201d Daenerys said to him. </p><p>\u201cThere She is.\u201d Viserys turned his head her way. </p><p>\u201cPut the sword down! They\u2019ll kill us all.\u201d Ser Jorah warned him. </p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t kill us. They can\u2019t shed blood in their sacred city.\u201d He got closer to where you all where. His sword out and pointing at anyone in front of him. Aegon pulled Daenerys and you behind him protectively not letting Viserys sword or himself anywhere nearby. </p><p>- </p><p>(Aegon\u2019s P.O.V)</p><p>At the sight of Viserys stumbling in Drunk and angry Aegons enjoyment died down and was replaced with anger. He wanted to kill him for what he did to his sister but he knew that he couldn\u2019t not here anyway. </p><p>He got in front of his sister and Daenerys protectively to keep them both out of Viserys reach. Daenerys tried to push him to the side but he didn\u2019t let her because he knew that he would hurt her and he couldn\u2019t let that happen. Viserys had a smirk on his face as he put the swords end inches from his neck. </p><p>\u201cI want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you but he never payed for you. Tell him I want what was bargained for or I\u2019m taking you back he can keep the baby. I\u2019ll cut it out and leave it for him.\u201d  Viserys says talking directly to Daenerys who was behind Aegon. Aegon heard what Khal Drogo said and he knew what he meant by it. He was going to get his crown but maybe not the way he would like it. </p><p>\u201cHe says yes you shall have a golden crown that men should should tremble to behold.\u201d Daenerys said from behind him only making Viserys smile and lowering his weapon from in front of his neck. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted what what was promised.\u201d Viserys said. He still had his weopon out but he was distracted so Aegon took this as his chance and grabbed his arm and took his sword and threw it to the ground. Aegon pushed Viserys back but it\u2019s like it didn\u2019t bother him he was to occupied with his crown that was promised. Aegon looked over at khal drogos bloodriders giving them a quick nod telling them that it was okay for them to get close. Once they did they broke his arm and Viserys started to panic. Aegon went to stand by his sister who was standing watching carefully. </p><p>\u201cNo! No! You cannot touch me I\u2019m the dragon! I want my crown!\u201d Viserys yelled in anger. Khal Drogo put his golden belt and put it in burning pot. When Viserys saw his eyes went wide and were full of panic and fear the anger not there no more. </p><p>\u201cDanny! Don\u2019t Dany tell them make them make them!\u201d Viserys yelled trying to save himself but Daenerys didn\u2019t say anything. Aegon noticed that Viserys shifted his gaze over to his sister. </p><p>\u201cY/N? Please! I\u2019m sorry! Please!\u201d He kept pleading. His eyes seemed to grow wider at the sight of Khal Drogo picking the pot up. \u201cDany please!\u201d </p><p>Aegon tried to cover the sight of what was going to happen but his sister only moved so she could see. </p><p>\u201cA crown for a king.\u201d Khal Drogo then poured then melted gold onto Viserys head causing him to fall to the ground. The gold making a big thunk noise as his lifeless body fell. Even if Aegon didn\u2019t like him he couldn\u2019t deny that dying that way was horrible. </p><p>Aegon looked back at his sister to see her reaction but she didn\u2019t seem bothered by it. It seemed like she showed no emotion but unlike Daenerys, he saw that his sister had a slight smirk. He knew that she didn\u2019t like him but it\u2019s also a reaction that he didn\u2019t like to see. Her look looked cold and emotionless. Like if what she had seen was normal. He knew that his sister was more tolerable to things like this but getting your head melted off was something different. And he couldn\u2019t help but feel chills at the sight of her smirk. </p><p>. </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></p>",

It\u2019s a ceremony they do when a khaleesi is expecting a child. If she eats the whole heart and doesn\u2019t throw any of it up then that means the unborn child is going to be strong. And if she can\u2019t finish it or throws any of it up then it\u2019s a bad sign. And honestly you don\u2019t know how you feel about her having a baby with the khal. You don\u2019t know if this affects anything with you getting the throne. </p><p>You stand and listen to the chanting and listen to Viserys and Ser Jorah having their own conversation on the side. When she finishes the heart you see that she bends down and looks like she\u2019s about to throw it up. You lean in closer watching what was going to go down. Deep down you wish she would throw it up. But when she lifts her head she swallows hard and they start chanting again. You want to feel happy for her but you can\u2019t you don\u2019t. Her having a son means everything. </p><p>\u201cA prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rheago!\u201d Daenerys says as she stands up with pride. </p><p>\u201cRheago! Rheago!\u201d The people chant only causing you to feel some certain way. You look over at Aegon who is already looking at you and he has the same reaction as you. And then you turn to see Viserys who seems to be lost in his own thoughts but by his frown it seems he\u2019s thinking the same thing as you and Aegon. </p><p>\u201cThey love her.\u201d You hear Viserys say beside you. She\u2019s beginning to be a threat not only to Viserys but to Aegon and you. Before you can muster up a fake smile to Daenerys way, you feel yourself getting pulled outside. </p><p>You look to the person who\u2019s pulling you and you weren\u2019t suprised that it was Viserys. You try to pull your arm from his grip but his grip his hard around your arm. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d You yell at him as he drags you. He ignored you and continued walking and you kept struggling to be let go from his grip. \u201cViserys!\u201d You try to get his attention but he still ignores you. It\u2019s not until you get to your shared tent where he lets go and he gets his weapons. He grabs your weapons to and throws them to your feet. \u201cViserys What In seven hells are you doing!!\u201d You yell at him. This time he whips his head to your direction. You notice the look he has in his eyes. It didn\u2019t scare you but it wasn\u2019t a good or happy look.  </p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like im doing we\u2019re leaving!\u201d He yells the anger in his voice very clear. You furrow your eyebrows and walk closer to him. You couldn\u2019t leave not yet you still needed their army even if Daenerys was beginning to be a threat you still needed their army to get back what rightfully belongs to Aegon and you. </p><p>\u201cNo we still need them we can\u2019t leave now!\u201d You argue but he only laughs and walks over to your dragon egg. You walk over to him and pull his arm as he\u2019s about to grab it. \u201cLeave it there!\u201d He turns and grips on to your arm. </p><p>\u201cHow do you think we\u2019re going to get money to buy my army huh? You Martells aren\u2019t the richest in the seven kingdoms and your army is too small to go into war to get the throne! Without money we can\u2019t get an army!\u201d He argues and goes to grab your egg again but you push him down. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you!\u201d You see the anger in his eyes. It was their before but he seemed angrier it was a deadly look. He stands up and grips onto both of your arms. You can feel his nails dig into your skin. But you don\u2019t wince or get scared of the pain. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife! You do what I say when I say it! And if i say we\u2019re leaving that means we\u2019re leaving! Without you then I don\u2019t have the martells on my side.\u201d He yells at you. You swallowed thickly and had determination in your look. You put on a fake smile and he seemed to be confused. With what little motion you have in your hands you grab his wrists and then lift your knee and knee him in the stomach. He groans in pain and bends down wrapping his arms around his stomach. </p><p>\u201cYou little Bitch!\u201d He yells his face was red now but you still weren\u2019t afraid. You stood tall were you were as he glared up at you. He straightened  himself up. He walked over to you but you didn\u2019t leave or move out of his way instead you stayed there and watched as came closer. He had a smirk on his face as his face got closer to yours. \u201cThat was a huge mistake\u2026. you are lucky that I can\u2019t kill you because I still need you but you just woke the dragon.\u201d He threatens you. He puts his hand on your throat and begins to squeeze it tightly making it hard for you to breathe. With your hands you grip onto his hand that\u2019s around your neck and try to pull it off but it\u2019s harder then you thought. </p><p>\u201cViserys let her go!\u201d You hear Ser Jorah yell. Viserys whips his head to where he stands. Aegon enters behind him and he sees what\u2019s going and his features turn into an angry scowl. He\u2019s about to grab your weapons that are on the ground but Ser Jorah stops him. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He whispers to Aegon. \u201cViserys let her go now!\u201d Viserys has that same stupid grin on his face but you feel him loosen his grip around your neck and then completely lets go making you fall to the ground. Aegon pushes Ser Jorahs hand out of the way and rushes over to where you were. Before he could check if you were alright he stands in front of Viserys in a challenging stance his hand is in a tight fist. </p><p>\u201cAegon don\u2019t. Remember the law you\u2019re not allowed to spill blood in Vaes Dothrak.\u201d  Ser Jorah warns him. Aegon swallows thickly. You know he wants to kill him for what he was doing but he also respects the rules unlike Viserys. He huffs out in defeat and He finally kneels down to where you were on the floor. Your hands around the offended area and trying to grasp for air. You knew their was going to be a bruise there. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright? He do anything else to you?\u201d He asks in a worried tone. You simply nod and he wraps his arm around your shoulders and picks you up to your feet. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them see you carry a sword in Vaes Dothrak you know the law.\u201d Ser Jorah tells Viserys when he sees his sword and dagger on him. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my law.\u201d Viserys says not caring as he  goes back to your egg and picks it up and puts it in his bag. </p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201d Ser Jorah tells him before you could say anything to Viserys. </p><p>\u201cwhatever is hers is also mine.\u201d Viserys says to him. </p><p>\u201cLeave it where it was Viserys.\u201d Aegon threatens. Viserys just glared at Aegon before turning his gaze back at Ser Jorah. </p><p>\u201cIf I sell one egg I have enough for an army and if sell two out of three Daenerys eggs I\u2019ll have enough for a ship and an army.\u201d Viserys spats. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s four.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI need a large army.\u201d Viserys takes a step closer to Ser Jorah. You want to go and snatch your egg from him but you watch carefully. \u201cI\u2019m the last hope for the dynasty Mormont the greatest dynasty the world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was 5 years old and no one has ever given me what they give to her on that tent. Never not a piece of it. Not even my own wife.\u201d He says his voice breaking slightly as he looks over to you quickly but then returns his gaze back at Mormont. \u201cHow can I carry what I need to carry without it hmm? Who can rule without wealth, fear or love?\u201d </p><p>You\u2019re getting imapatient as you see that Viserys doesn\u2019t drop your egg. But you also are getting to trust Ser Jorah and you know he wouldn\u2019t let him walk out with it. Viserys continues to talk to Ser Jorah in a whisper It  was a small space so you could hear what he told to him. Telling him some truths and now that he points them out and hear it aloud you fully see that they\u2019re true.</p><p>\u201cDoes loyalty mean nothing to you?\u201d Viserys asks Ser Jorah. </p><p>\u201cIt means everything to me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd yet here you stand.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd yet here I stand.\u201d </p><p>Viserys looks over at you and then drops the bag and then he stomps out of the tent. Ser Jorah picks up the bag and walks over to you. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d He asks concerned. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright now thank you Ser Jorah.\u201d You tell him because if he hadn\u2019t entered when he had you didn\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened. He hands the bag over to you and Aegon takes it. Ser Jorah does a small bow. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m loyal to you both and Daenerys. And we\u2019re going to need to talk about we needs to happen about Viserys. He\u2019s not fit to rule.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed.\u201d Aegon says. </p><p>\u201cWe also need to talk about other matters but let\u2019s wait for Daenerys to be with us.\u201d He says and aegons gives him a quick nod in agreement before Ser Jorah leaves. Leaving Aegon and you alone. He turns you and cups your cheeks. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re alright?\u201d He asks again. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d You tell him with a smile on your face. </p><p>\u201cYour marriage to him is going to be annulled I don\u2019t care I know our uncle will understand.\u201d He says his face full with worry. \u201cI wanted to kill him and I still do.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot here not yet.\u201d You say to him. </p><p>\u201cI know but i can\u2019t let him hurt you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t not ever again. But please let\u2019s not talk him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d He says with a warm smile as he pulls you in for a kiss. </p><p>- </p><p>Aegon and you make your way over to the tent where they were going to have the feast. You make it inside and theirs people dancing around the fire. Khal Drogo is drinking and talking with his blood riders in one corner and Daenerys is talking with Ser Jorah and Doreah in another. You notice that her eyes instantly land on your brother Aegon as he comes in by your side. She smiles his way but as you turn to see his reaction it seems like he was trying to avoid her gaze. You can\u2019t help but glare her way.   As you feel the jealousy in you rise. She seemed to notice so she turned her attention back to Daenerys. Not seconds later Daenerys sees you and walks over and she stands up her face full with concern. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what happened.\u201d She says as she stands in front of you. You smile and your hand goes up to your neck where the bruise was already showing. </p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t the one that did it.\u201d You reassure her with a smile. </p><p>\u201cBut my brother did and it wasn\u2019t alright that he did that you he could\u2019ve killed you.\u201d It\u2019s actions like these that make you regret what you think of her. She nothing like her brother and she doesn\u2019t deserve what you think of her. But if she\u2019s a threat then the threat can\u2019t live. it\u2019s something that you\u2019ll have to deal with if you like it or not. But maybe it\u2019s like Ser Jorah said we can talk about what needs to happen next and that\u2019s not only including Viserys. </p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t so please don\u2019t feel guilty for his doings because he sure doesn\u2019t\u2026\u2026.and please enough of him we\u2019re in a feast it\u2019s time to enjoy it.\u201d She smiles at your last words and she takes you by the hand to where she was. </p><p>It had seemed that being here in the feast made you forget of what had happened earlier that day. You were talking and laughing along with Daenerys and Ser Jorah. Even if Doreah was there and you couldn\u2019t miss the looks she gave your brother you tried your best not to go over there and drag her into the fire by her hair. But like always It was Aegon that mostly kept you calm he always did. And he was one of the only people that could beside your uncles who were on the other side of the sea. </p><p>Your enjoyment didn\u2019t last as long as you wanted to though. It was ruined at the sound of Viserys stumbling into the tent drunk. </p><p>\u201cDaenerys! Where\u2019s my sister! And my wife!\u201d Viserys yelled from entrance of the tent. The sight of him made you roll your eyes. Aegon stood up and was about to walk over but Ser Jorah stopped him. </p><p>\u201cNo my prince you stay here I\u2019ll go.\u201d See Jorah said to him as he had his arm out to stop him from going any further. </p><p>\u201cHe has his weapons on him I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d Aegon argued. </p><p>\u201cMore of the reason you should stay put especially after what happened earlier. Stay here and guard your sister and Daenerys in case he tries anything.\u201d Aegon is hesitant but he doesn\u2019t follow after Ser Jorah. </p><p>\u201cWhere is she! Where\u2019s my sister! Where\u2019s my wife! I\u2019m here for the feast! The whores feast!\u201d Viserys yelled. Ser Jorah grabbed him by the hand but Viserys pushed it off. </p><p>\u201cGet your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!\u201d Viserys spats at Ser Jorah. One of  khal Drogos blood riders says something and khal Drogo laughs causing Viserys to turn his way. </p><p>\u201cKhal Drogo! I\u2019m here for the feast!\u201d Viserys keeps making his way over. Khal Drogo tells him that he belonged outside but Viserys didn\u2019t understand. After all this time here he still hadn\u2019t learned their language which is ridiculous since he wants them to go to war for him. </p><p>\u201cThat is no place for a king.\u201d Viserys tells him. You watch their interaction carefully. </p><p>\u201cYou are no king.\u201d Khal Drogo says in your common tongue suprising you just a bit. Only making Viserys angrier. When Ser Jorah tried pulling him out he pulled his sword out and had it pointing at him threatening him. </p><p>\u201cViserys please.\u201d Daenerys said to him. </p><p>\u201cThere She is.\u201d Viserys turned his head her way. </p><p>\u201cPut the sword down! They\u2019ll kill us all.\u201d Ser Jorah warned him. </p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t kill us. They can\u2019t shed blood in their sacred city.\u201d He got closer to where you all where. His sword out and pointing at anyone in front of him. Aegon pulled Daenerys and you behind him protectively not letting Viserys sword or himself anywhere nearby. </p><p>- </p><p>(Aegon\u2019s P.O.V)</p><p>At the sight of Viserys stumbling in Drunk and angry Aegons enjoyment died down and was replaced with anger. He wanted to kill him for what he did to his sister but he knew that he couldn\u2019t not here anyway. </p><p>He got in front of his sister and Daenerys protectively to keep them both out of Viserys reach. Daenerys tried to push him to the side but he didn\u2019t let her because he knew that he would hurt her and he couldn\u2019t let that happen. Viserys had a smirk on his face as he put the swords end inches from his neck. </p><p>\u201cI want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you but he never payed for you. Tell him I want what was bargained for or I\u2019m taking you back he can keep the baby. I\u2019ll cut it out and leave it for him.\u201d  Viserys says talking directly to Daenerys who was behind Aegon. Aegon heard what Khal Drogo said and he knew what he meant by it. He was going to get his crown but maybe not the way he would like it. </p><p>\u201cHe says yes you shall have a golden crown that men should should tremble to behold.\u201d Daenerys said from behind him only making Viserys smile and lowering his weapon from in front of his neck. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted what what was promised.\u201d Viserys said. He still had his weopon out but he was distracted so Aegon took this as his chance and grabbed his arm and took his sword and threw it to the ground. Aegon pushed Viserys back but it\u2019s like it didn\u2019t bother him he was to occupied with his crown that was promised. Aegon looked over at khal drogos bloodriders giving them a quick nod telling them that it was okay for them to get close. Once they did they broke his arm and Viserys started to panic. Aegon went to stand by his sister who was standing watching carefully. </p><p>\u201cNo! No! You cannot touch me I\u2019m the dragon! I want my crown!\u201d Viserys yelled in anger. Khal Drogo put his golden belt and put it in burning pot. When Viserys saw his eyes went wide and were full of panic and fear the anger not there no more. </p><p>\u201cDanny! Don\u2019t Dany tell them make them make them!\u201d Viserys yelled trying to save himself but Daenerys didn\u2019t say anything. Aegon noticed that Viserys shifted his gaze over to his sister. </p><p>\u201cY/N? Please! I\u2019m sorry! Please!\u201d He kept pleading. His eyes seemed to grow wider at the sight of Khal Drogo picking the pot up. \u201cDany please!\u201d </p><p>Aegon tried to cover the sight of what was going to happen but his sister only moved so she could see. </p><p>\u201cA crown for a king.\u201d Khal Drogo then poured then melted gold onto Viserys head causing him to fall to the ground. The gold making a big thunk noise as his lifeless body fell. Even if Aegon didn\u2019t like him he couldn\u2019t deny that dying that way was horrible. </p><p>Aegon looked back at his sister to see her reaction but she didn\u2019t seem bothered by it. It seemed like she showed no emotion but unlike Daenerys, he saw that his sister had a slight smirk. He knew that she didn\u2019t like him but it\u2019s also a reaction that he didn\u2019t like to see. Her look looked cold and emotionless. Like if what she had seen was normal. He knew that his sister was more tolerable to things like this but getting your head melted off was something different. And he couldn\u2019t help but feel chills at the sight of her smirk. </p><p>. </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></p>",

It&rsquo;s a ceremony they do when a khaleesi is expecting a child. If she eats the whole heart and doesn&rsquo;t throw any of it up then that means the unborn child is going to be strong. And if she can&rsquo;t finish it or throws any of it up then it&rsquo;s a bad sign. And honestly you don&rsquo;t know how you feel about her having a baby with the khal. You don&rsquo;t know if this affects anything with you getting the throne. </p><p>You stand and listen to the chanting and listen to Viserys and Ser Jorah having their own conversation on the side. When she finishes the heart you see that she bends down and looks like she&rsquo;s about to throw it up. You lean in closer watching what was going to go down. Deep down you wish she would throw it up. But when she lifts her head she swallows hard and they start chanting again. You want to feel happy for her but you can&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t. Her having a son means everything. </p><p>&ldquo;A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rheago!&rdquo; Daenerys says as she stands up with pride. </p><p>&ldquo;Rheago! Rheago!&rdquo; The people chant only causing you to feel some certain way. You look over at Aegon who is already looking at you and he has the same reaction as you. And then you turn to see Viserys who seems to be lost in his own thoughts but by his frown it seems he&rsquo;s thinking the same thing as you and Aegon. </p><p>&ldquo;They love her.&rdquo; You hear Viserys say beside you. She&rsquo;s beginning to be a threat not only to Viserys but to Aegon and you. Before you can muster up a fake smile to Daenerys way, you feel yourself getting pulled outside. </p><p>You look to the person who&rsquo;s pulling you and you weren&rsquo;t suprised that it was Viserys. You try to pull your arm from his grip but his grip his hard around your arm. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo; You yell at him as he drags you. He ignored you and continued walking and you kept struggling to be let go from his grip. &ldquo;Viserys!&rdquo; You try to get his attention but he still ignores you. It&rsquo;s not until you get to your shared tent where he lets go and he gets his weapons. He grabs your weapons to and throws them to your feet. &ldquo;Viserys What In seven hells are you doing!!&rdquo; You yell at him. This time he whips his head to your direction. You notice the look he has in his eyes. It didn&rsquo;t scare you but it wasn&rsquo;t a good or happy look.  </p><p>&ldquo;What does it look like im doing we&rsquo;re leaving!&rdquo; He yells the anger in his voice very clear. You furrow your eyebrows and walk closer to him. You couldn&rsquo;t leave not yet you still needed their army even if Daenerys was beginning to be a threat you still needed their army to get back what rightfully belongs to Aegon and you. </p><p>&ldquo;No we still need them we can&rsquo;t leave now!&rdquo; You argue but he only laughs and walks over to your dragon egg. You walk over to him and pull his arm as he&rsquo;s about to grab it. &ldquo;Leave it there!&rdquo; He turns and grips on to your arm. </p><p>&ldquo;How do you think we&rsquo;re going to get money to buy my army huh? You Martells aren&rsquo;t the richest in the seven kingdoms and your army is too small to go into war to get the throne! Without money we can&rsquo;t get an army!&rdquo; He argues and goes to grab your egg again but you push him down. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere with you!&rdquo; You see the anger in his eyes. It was their before but he seemed angrier it was a deadly look. He stands up and grips onto both of your arms. You can feel his nails dig into your skin. But you don&rsquo;t wince or get scared of the pain. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my wife! You do what I say when I say it! And if i say we&rsquo;re leaving that means we&rsquo;re leaving! Without you then I don&rsquo;t have the martells on my side.&rdquo; He yells at you. You swallowed thickly and had determination in your look. You put on a fake smile and he seemed to be confused. With what little motion you have in your hands you grab his wrists and then lift your knee and knee him in the stomach. He groans in pain and bends down wrapping his arms around his stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;You little Bitch!&rdquo; He yells his face was red now but you still weren&rsquo;t afraid. You stood tall were you were as he glared up at you. He straightened  himself up. He walked over to you but you didn&rsquo;t leave or move out of his way instead you stayed there and watched as came closer. He had a smirk on his face as his face got closer to yours. &ldquo;That was a huge mistake&hellip;. you are lucky that I can&rsquo;t kill you because I still need you but you just woke the dragon.&rdquo; He threatens you. He puts his hand on your throat and begins to squeeze it tightly making it hard for you to breathe. With your hands you grip onto his hand that&rsquo;s around your neck and try to pull it off but it&rsquo;s harder then you thought. </p><p>&ldquo;Viserys let her go!&rdquo; You hear Ser Jorah yell. Viserys whips his head to where he stands. Aegon enters behind him and he sees what&rsquo;s going and his features turn into an angry scowl. He&rsquo;s about to grab your weapons that are on the ground but Ser Jorah stops him. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He whispers to Aegon. &ldquo;Viserys let her go now!&rdquo; Viserys has that same stupid grin on his face but you feel him loosen his grip around your neck and then completely lets go making you fall to the ground. Aegon pushes Ser Jorahs hand out of the way and rushes over to where you were. Before he could check if you were alright he stands in front of Viserys in a challenging stance his hand is in a tight fist. </p><p>&ldquo;Aegon don&rsquo;t. Remember the law you&rsquo;re not allowed to spill blood in Vaes Dothrak.&rdquo;  Ser Jorah warns him. Aegon swallows thickly. You know he wants to kill him for what he was doing but he also respects the rules unlike Viserys. He huffs out in defeat and He finally kneels down to where you were on the floor. Your hands around the offended area and trying to grasp for air. You knew their was going to be a bruise there. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright? He do anything else to you?&rdquo; He asks in a worried tone. You simply nod and he wraps his arm around your shoulders and picks you up to your feet. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them see you carry a sword in Vaes Dothrak you know the law.&rdquo; Ser Jorah tells Viserys when he sees his sword and dagger on him. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my law.&rdquo; Viserys says not caring as he  goes back to your egg and picks it up and puts it in his bag. </p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t belong to you.&rdquo; Ser Jorah tells him before you could say anything to Viserys. </p><p>&ldquo;whatever is hers is also mine.&rdquo; Viserys says to him. </p><p>&ldquo;Leave it where it was Viserys.&rdquo; Aegon threatens. Viserys just glared at Aegon before turning his gaze back at Ser Jorah. </p><p>&ldquo;If I sell one egg I have enough for an army and if sell two out of three Daenerys eggs I&rsquo;ll have enough for a ship and an army.&rdquo; Viserys spats. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s four.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I need a large army.&rdquo; Viserys takes a step closer to Ser Jorah. You want to go and snatch your egg from him but you watch carefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the last hope for the dynasty Mormont the greatest dynasty the world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was 5 years old and no one has ever given me what they give to her on that tent. Never not a piece of it. Not even my own wife.&rdquo; He says his voice breaking slightly as he looks over to you quickly but then returns his gaze back at Mormont. &ldquo;How can I carry what I need to carry without it hmm? Who can rule without wealth, fear or love?&rdquo; </p><p>You&rsquo;re getting imapatient as you see that Viserys doesn&rsquo;t drop your egg. But you also are getting to trust Ser Jorah and you know he wouldn&rsquo;t let him walk out with it. Viserys continues to talk to Ser Jorah in a whisper It  was a small space so you could hear what he told to him. Telling him some truths and now that he points them out and hear it aloud you fully see that they&rsquo;re true.</p><p>&ldquo;Does loyalty mean nothing to you?&rdquo; Viserys asks Ser Jorah. </p><p>&ldquo;It means everything to me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And yet here you stand.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And yet here I stand.&rdquo; </p><p>Viserys looks over at you and then drops the bag and then he stomps out of the tent. Ser Jorah picks up the bag and walks over to you. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; He asks concerned. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright now thank you Ser Jorah.&rdquo; You tell him because if he hadn&rsquo;t entered when he had you didn&rsquo;t know what would&rsquo;ve happened. He hands the bag over to you and Aegon takes it. Ser Jorah does a small bow. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m loyal to you both and Daenerys. And we&rsquo;re going to need to talk about we needs to happen about Viserys. He&rsquo;s not fit to rule.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve noticed.&rdquo; Aegon says. </p><p>&ldquo;We also need to talk about other matters but let&rsquo;s wait for Daenerys to be with us.&rdquo; He says and aegons gives him a quick nod in agreement before Ser Jorah leaves. Leaving Aegon and you alone. He turns you and cups your cheeks. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re alright?&rdquo; He asks again. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright.&rdquo; You tell him with a smile on your face. </p><p>&ldquo;Your marriage to him is going to be annulled I don&rsquo;t care I know our uncle will understand.&rdquo; He says his face full with worry. &ldquo;I wanted to kill him and I still do.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not here not yet.&rdquo; You say to him. </p><p>&ldquo;I know but i can&rsquo;t let him hurt you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t not ever again. But please let&rsquo;s not talk him now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo; He says with a warm smile as he pulls you in for a kiss. </p><p>- </p><p>Aegon and you make your way over to the tent where they were going to have the feast. You make it inside and theirs people dancing around the fire. Khal Drogo is drinking and talking with his blood riders in one corner and Daenerys is talking with Ser Jorah and Doreah in another. You notice that her eyes instantly land on your brother Aegon as he comes in by your side. She smiles his way but as you turn to see his reaction it seems like he was trying to avoid her gaze. You can&rsquo;t help but glare her way.   As you feel the jealousy in you rise. She seemed to notice so she turned her attention back to Daenerys. Not seconds later Daenerys sees you and walks over and she stands up her face full with concern. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry for what happened.&rdquo; She says as she stands in front of you. You smile and your hand goes up to your neck where the bruise was already showing. </p><p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t the one that did it.&rdquo; You reassure her with a smile. </p><p>&ldquo;But my brother did and it wasn&rsquo;t alright that he did that you he could&rsquo;ve killed you.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s actions like these that make you regret what you think of her. She nothing like her brother and she doesn&rsquo;t deserve what you think of her. But if she&rsquo;s a threat then the threat can&rsquo;t live. it&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;ll have to deal with if you like it or not. But maybe it&rsquo;s like Ser Jorah said we can talk about what needs to happen next and that&rsquo;s not only including Viserys. </p><p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t so please don&rsquo;t feel guilty for his doings because he sure doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;&hellip;.and please enough of him we&rsquo;re in a feast it&rsquo;s time to enjoy it.&rdquo; She smiles at your last words and she takes you by the hand to where she was. </p><p>It had seemed that being here in the feast made you forget of what had happened earlier that day. You were talking and laughing along with Daenerys and Ser Jorah. Even if Doreah was there and you couldn&rsquo;t miss the looks she gave your brother you tried your best not to go over there and drag her into the fire by her hair. But like always It was Aegon that mostly kept you calm he always did. And he was one of the only people that could beside your uncles who were on the other side of the sea. </p><p>Your enjoyment didn&rsquo;t last as long as you wanted to though. It was ruined at the sound of Viserys stumbling into the tent drunk. </p><p>&ldquo;Daenerys! Where&rsquo;s my sister! And my wife!&rdquo; Viserys yelled from entrance of the tent. The sight of him made you roll your eyes. Aegon stood up and was about to walk over but Ser Jorah stopped him. </p><p>&ldquo;No my prince you stay here I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; See Jorah said to him as he had his arm out to stop him from going any further. </p><p>&ldquo;He has his weapons on him I&rsquo;m going to help you.&rdquo; Aegon argued. </p><p>&ldquo;More of the reason you should stay put especially after what happened earlier. Stay here and guard your sister and Daenerys in case he tries anything.&rdquo; Aegon is hesitant but he doesn&rsquo;t follow after Ser Jorah. </p><p>&ldquo;Where is she! Where&rsquo;s my sister! Where&rsquo;s my wife! I&rsquo;m here for the feast! The whores feast!&rdquo; Viserys yelled. Ser Jorah grabbed him by the hand but Viserys pushed it off. </p><p>&ldquo;Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!&rdquo; Viserys spats at Ser Jorah. One of  khal Drogos blood riders says something and khal Drogo laughs causing Viserys to turn his way. </p><p>&ldquo;Khal Drogo! I&rsquo;m here for the feast!&rdquo; Viserys keeps making his way over. Khal Drogo tells him that he belonged outside but Viserys didn&rsquo;t understand. After all this time here he still hadn&rsquo;t learned their language which is ridiculous since he wants them to go to war for him. </p><p>&ldquo;That is no place for a king.&rdquo; Viserys tells him. You watch their interaction carefully. </p><p>&ldquo;You are no king.&rdquo; Khal Drogo says in your common tongue suprising you just a bit. Only making Viserys angrier. When Ser Jorah tried pulling him out he pulled his sword out and had it pointing at him threatening him. </p><p>&ldquo;Viserys please.&rdquo; Daenerys said to him. </p><p>&ldquo;There She is.&rdquo; Viserys turned his head her way. </p><p>&ldquo;Put the sword down! They&rsquo;ll kill us all.&rdquo; Ser Jorah warned him. </p><p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t kill us. They can&rsquo;t shed blood in their sacred city.&rdquo; He got closer to where you all where. His sword out and pointing at anyone in front of him. Aegon pulled Daenerys and you behind him protectively not letting Viserys sword or himself anywhere nearby. </p><p>- </p><p>(Aegon&rsquo;s P.O.V)</p><p>At the sight of Viserys stumbling in Drunk and angry Aegons enjoyment died down and was replaced with anger. He wanted to kill him for what he did to his sister but he knew that he couldn&rsquo;t not here anyway. </p><p>He got in front of his sister and Daenerys protectively to keep them both out of Viserys reach. Daenerys tried to push him to the side but he didn&rsquo;t let her because he knew that he would hurt her and he couldn&rsquo;t let that happen. Viserys had a smirk on his face as he put the swords end inches from his neck. </p><p>&ldquo;I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you but he never payed for you. Tell him I want what was bargained for or I&rsquo;m taking you back he can keep the baby. I&rsquo;ll cut it out and leave it for him.&rdquo;  Viserys says talking directly to Daenerys who was behind Aegon. Aegon heard what Khal Drogo said and he knew what he meant by it. He was going to get his crown but maybe not the way he would like it. </p><p>&ldquo;He says yes you shall have a golden crown that men should should tremble to behold.&rdquo; Daenerys said from behind him only making Viserys smile and lowering his weapon from in front of his neck. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I wanted what what was promised.&rdquo; Viserys said. He still had his weopon out but he was distracted so Aegon took this as his chance and grabbed his arm and took his sword and threw it to the ground. Aegon pushed Viserys back but it&rsquo;s like it didn&rsquo;t bother him he was to occupied with his crown that was promised. Aegon looked over at khal drogos bloodriders giving them a quick nod telling them that it was okay for them to get close. Once they did they broke his arm and Viserys started to panic. Aegon went to stand by his sister who was standing watching carefully. </p><p>&ldquo;No! No! You cannot touch me I&rsquo;m the dragon! I want my crown!&rdquo; Viserys yelled in anger. Khal Drogo put his golden belt and put it in burning pot. When Viserys saw his eyes went wide and were full of panic and fear the anger not there no more. </p><p>&ldquo;Danny! Don&rsquo;t Dany tell them make them make them!&rdquo; Viserys yelled trying to save himself but Daenerys didn&rsquo;t say anything. Aegon noticed that Viserys shifted his gaze over to his sister. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N? Please! I&rsquo;m sorry! Please!&rdquo; He kept pleading. His eyes seemed to grow wider at the sight of Khal Drogo picking the pot up. &ldquo;Dany please!&rdquo; </p><p>Aegon tried to cover the sight of what was going to happen but his sister only moved so she could see. </p><p>&ldquo;A crown for a king.&rdquo; Khal Drogo then poured then melted gold onto Viserys head causing him to fall to the ground. The gold making a big thunk noise as his lifeless body fell. Even if Aegon didn&rsquo;t like him he couldn&rsquo;t deny that dying that way was horrible. </p><p>Aegon looked back at his sister to see her reaction but she didn&rsquo;t seem bothered by it. It seemed like she showed no emotion but unlike Daenerys, he saw that his sister had a slight smirk. He knew that she didn&rsquo;t like him but it&rsquo;s also a reaction that he didn&rsquo;t like to see. Her look looked cold and emotionless. Like if what she had seen was normal. He knew that his sister was more tolerable to things like this but getting your head melted off was something different. And he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel chills at the sight of her smirk. </p><p>. </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></p>",

        "answer": "<p style=\"\">It\u2019s much better lol.</p><p>I think Eren is <i>how</i> you develop a character who is your protagonist as the villain. You can\u2019t switch coding like that successfully most of the time. Dany being a prime example.</p><p>The reason it works for Eren right now (its ultimate success depends on when we finally get his thoughts, and I will add that the pacing is, as usual, to the story\u2019s detriment) is because there\u2019s a mysterious four-year time gap in which we have&hellip; a lot of questions. We\u2019ve received hints about what is going on, but we don\u2019t have the full story. We just know that he still seems to want to protect people&ndash;consistent as always&ndash;yet is prone to lashing out at people who don\u2019t agree with hm (just like always). There is certainly a leap there to genocide, but we also saw him in the moments before he committed it, empathizing with Reiner and reminding us of who Eren is and giving us hope that he has some kind of plan, even if it\u2019s a disastrous one with a tragic ending. Eren has noble goals. Dany was also kind of portrayed as having good goals (ending slavery) except&hellip; they didn\u2019t at all explain how her actions were remotely connected to ending slavery. It made no sense. <br/></p><p>In SnK, every other character is <i>also</i> spiraling via delving into their worst instincts, so it\u2019s not like Eren is being singled out by the narrative (see: Historia sacrificing herself, Levi resorting to extreme violence and torture, Armin being passive as hell, Mikasa clinging to Eren when something is very wrong). And they\u2019re all suffering for it. Eren just almost got chomped, Mikasa and Armin are locked up and Mikasa\u2019s love told her she was a slave, Historia is pregnant, Levi is half-alive. In GoT, Dany was the <i>only</i> character punished for her actions (Arya anyone? Freaking Cersei, who turned out to have been&hellip; right not to send troops north to fight for the living?) in season 8, which is unsatisfying as hell. <br/></p><p>Eren is framed as having choices&ndash;people are begging him to rely on them, to listen. Dany was not framed as having choices: she was damned if she does and damned if she doesn\u2019t for every single choice this season. Like, her refusing food from Varys was seen as evidence of her madness, yet Varys was also poisoning her food, so&hellip; you\u2019re not paranoid if people <i>are</i> all out to get you. <br/></p><p>And even so, the narrative is empathetic to Eren. I don\u2019t doubt he\u2019ll find humanity and be able to share where he\u2019s coming from with certain key people (Mikasa, maybe more) before the end. We hurt for him and for his loved ones, and we know he could be better than this. Dany was just&hellip; they went so far as to give her Nuremberg imagery to discourage sympathy and had their actors tell the audience they were\u00a0\u201cculpable\u201d in cheering her for doing actions every single other character also did, which is incredibly offensive. They also chalked it up to fate \u201cevery time a Targaryen is born the gods flip a coin\u201d which is generally unsatisfying especially given the weight on choices throughout GOT. <br/></p><p>Sigh. I have thoughts lol. In short: thus far, Eren\u2019s Dark Side twist is working for me. The reveal of his true plans will, of course, dramatically affect this, but I don\u2019t hate it. Dany\u2019s turn made noooo sense whatsoever. <br/></p>",

It made no sense. <br></p><p>In SnK, every other character is <i>also</i> spiraling via delving into their worst instincts, so it\u2019s not like Eren is being singled out by the narrative (see: Historia sacrificing herself, Levi resorting to extreme violence and torture, Armin being passive as hell, Mikasa clinging to Eren when something is very wrong). And they\u2019re all suffering for it. Eren just almost got chomped, Mikasa and Armin are locked up and Mikasa\u2019s love told her she was a slave, Historia is pregnant, Levi is half-alive. In GoT, Dany was the <i>only</i> character punished for her actions (Arya anyone? Freaking Cersei, who turned out to have been\u2026 right not to send troops north to fight for the living?) in season 8, which is unsatisfying as hell. <br></p><p>Eren is framed as having choices\u2013people are begging him to rely on them, to listen. Dany was not framed as having choices: she was damned if she does and damned if she doesn\u2019t for every single choice this season. Like, her refusing food from Varys was seen as evidence of her madness, yet Varys was also poisoning her food, so\u2026 you\u2019re not paranoid if people <i>are</i> all out to get you. <br></p><p>And even so, the narrative is empathetic to Eren. I don\u2019t doubt he\u2019ll find humanity and be able to share where he\u2019s coming from with certain key people (Mikasa, maybe more) before the end. We hurt for him and for his loved ones, and we know he could be better than this. Dany was just\u2026 they went so far as to give her Nuremberg imagery to discourage sympathy and had their actors tell the audience they were\u00a0\u201cculpable\u201d in cheering her for doing actions every single other character also did, which is incredibly offensive. They also chalked it up to fate \u201cevery time a Targaryen is born the gods flip a coin\u201d which is generally unsatisfying especially given the weight on choices throughout GOT. <br></p><p>Sigh. I have thoughts lol. In short: thus far, Eren\u2019s Dark Side twist is working for me. The reveal of his true plans will, of course, dramatically affect this, but I don\u2019t hate it. Dany\u2019s turn made noooo sense whatsoever. <br></p>",
