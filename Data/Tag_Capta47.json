She pulled herself out of the bed in Maria&rsquo;s guest bedroom and drearily walked towards the nursery.</p><p>There, four-month-old Monica Rambeau looked up at her from her crib.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Lieutenant Trouble.&rdquo; Carol cooed as she took the baby in her arms, causing the fussing to cease. &ldquo;You hungry? Let&rsquo;s go get some grub.&rdquo;</p><p>She walked downstairs and into the kitchen, where she started prepping a bottle. As it warmed up in the microwave, Carol walked laps around the tiled floor, gently bouncing Monica in her arms. </p><p>&ldquo;You know, it&rsquo;s your Mom&rsquo;s first official Mother&rsquo;s Day today.&rdquo; She whispered, running her hand fondly through the baby&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;You gonna be extra nice to her today?&rdquo;</p><p>Monica made a noise that was a cross between a yawn and a raspberry.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought.&rdquo; Carol said through a laugh, as she took out the bottle and tested the temperature on her wrist.</p><p>As Monica worked on the bottle, Carol registered the sound of soft footsteps making their way down the stairs and into the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; Maria whispered, smiling when she saw her best friend and daughter together. &ldquo;I was wondering why it was so quiet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry, Monica&rsquo;s keeping a good eye on me.&rdquo; </p><p>The two women laughed as Maria took Monica into her arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for getting her started.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no problem. Thank you for letting me stay here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know my door&rsquo;s always open for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, still, I appreciate it. Things are&hellip;really bad at home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still going, huh? Sorry to hear that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s whatever. I&rsquo;m just glad to have someone like you watching my back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if it means I get an in-home babysitter&hellip;&rdquo; Maria teased, propping the baby up on her shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that reminds me!&rdquo; Carol went over to the kitchen table and grabbed a small box, opening it to reveal a golden necklace with a charm reading &ldquo;Monica.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Happy Mother&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo; She continued with a smile. Maria brought a hand to her mouth as her eyes started to water. She wrapped her free hand around Carol&rsquo;s waist.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, I love it.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol rested her head on Maria&rsquo;s shoulder and reached over to adjust Monica&rsquo;s blankets.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you might.&rdquo;</p></p>",

Her legs trembled where she stood. The spaceship full of Skrull refugees had exploded before she could reach it in time to save them. She was busy trying to help the others escape on another ship set for self-destruction. She couldn&rsquo;t be in two places at once though she wish she could. </p><p><b><i>As long as I keep saving. And I keep fighting. I can do some good.</i></b></p><p>She thought to herself. But that didn&rsquo;t stop the pain erupting in chest. Her heart squeezing and expanding. Her stomach full of knots, the anxiety made her body tense. There&rsquo;s nothing Carol hated more than failing. Especially at being a hero. Lives were at stake. </p><p>The flames rose high into the air, burning bright in the middle of the dark abyss of space. On a planet that was empty with nothing but rocks and stone. Carol turned her head to the other refugees who were silently watching her. Their eyes full of sadness, knowing what she felt. Carol took a deep breath. She had to be strong for them. They probably felt guilt as well. </p><p>&ldquo;The ship will be here soon. You will be given food and water. And a place to rest.&rdquo; She reassured them, her tone strong. Carol was hiding the guilt in her chest. The refugees stared at her in admiration. But Carol didn&rsquo;t feel like she deserved it. </p><p>After getting picked up by the spaceship. Carol retreated to her room. She removed her suit and replaced it with unicorn pajamas and a carebear t-shirt. Her heart and stomach were still twisting inside her. She took deep breaths and went over to her bed. Warm tears trail down from her eyelids, onto her soft cheeks. A choked sob escaped her, she couldn&rsquo;t hold it in. Her voice sounded so small and hurt in contrast to the strength she conveyed to the refugees. She only showed her vulnerability around people she was really close too. People she loves. And more frequently now ever since travelling solo, to herself.</p><p>Or so she thought. </p><p>Goose jumped onto her bed, purring softly and nuzzling her neck. Her whiskers tickled the skin of her neck, softly touching the surface. This made Carol giggle in the midst of a sob. She sniffles and pets Goose&rsquo;s soft orange fur. The flerken rubbed her head on Carol&rsquo;s cheek, making Carol giggle again. Her fur was warm and smooth to the touch. She wrapped an arm around Goose. Her heart no longer heavy, but rather light. &ldquo;I wish I got there in time Goose. I want to be a hero. A good hero.&rdquo; She confessed to the flerken. &ldquo;Sometimes I feel so helpless.&rdquo; Goose meowed softly and layed her warm body near Carol. &ldquo;I know&hellip; I know I can&rsquo;t always save everyone. It just hurts.&rdquo;</p><p>In response to this, Goose suddenly climbed on top of Carol&rsquo;s chest. Offering comfort with affection. Carol smiled at her and lightly pressed their noses together. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my cute little monster. You know that? Who&rsquo;s a cute tentacle kitten hm?&rdquo; She cooed. Goose proudly responded to her with a loud meow, that sounded more like &lsquo;me&rsquo;.</p><p>Carol hugged Goose close, relaxed enough to rest for the time being so she can get back out there. To keep fighting. Her eyelids slowly close and her arms held Goose like a plush. Even the strongest of heroes can feel hurt, and even the strongest can depend on someone or something to help them get by. Goose proudly nuzzled Carol&rsquo;s cheeks while she was asleep. A proud flerken, ready to be there for her Carol whenever she was hurt.</p>",
