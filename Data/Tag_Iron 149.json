Your other one that was the same did send through but I\u2019ll just answer it on this one. </p><h1>Resolved </h1><p>Fandom: Marvel </p><p>Warnings: nope</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Tony was walking down the sidewalk. His hands were in his pockets and he had his sunglasses on even though it was dark out. He had been at a bar and was walking back to his car. As he walked down the empty path, he heard something. Footsteps. He didn\u2019t think too much of it, as they weren\u2019t posing any threat to him. But it did seem weird that they sort of appeared out of no where. They were wearing an oversized trench coat and a jet black fedora. They started to walk quicker, as if they were walking towards Tony. </p><p>Tony didn\u2019t want to die so he made a sharp turn into an alley. This is how he would know if the person was following him or just walking. </p><p>He was being followed. </p><p>Tony turned around and faced the figure. The person took off their jacket, revealing a red suit. </p><p>Oh no.</p><p>They reached up and threw off their hat, revealing their face. </p><p>\u201cI thought you moved to Europe, Iron Man.\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well I thought you were done with me. Clearly you aren\u2019t.\u201d Tony snapped back. Peter looked up to meet his eyes. He had on his spider suit but without the mask. He slowly advanced towards Tony. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Pete. I\u2019m not going to fight you. You\u2019re just a kid! I couldn\u2019t hurt a-\u201c he cut himself off as Peters fist was being thrown at Tony\u2019s face. But, with his reflexes he\u2019s built up over the years, he was able to grab the fist before it punched him in the face. </p><p>\u201cNice try, kiddo. But it\u2019s going to take a lot more than that to-\u201c</p><p>A simple swipe from Peters leg hitting Tony\u2019s legs caused the older man to fall. Peter stood above him and looked down. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving without a fight.\u201d Peter growled but it was hard to take him seriously. He was just a boy. Everything he said was adorable. Tony shrugged. </p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d He grabbed Peter\u2019s leg and pulled him to the ground. He started to stand up but Peter lunged on top of him. Tony was trying to grab his arms as Peter was trying to punch him. Tony pushed the boy over so that he fell down on his back. Peter webbed himself back to his feet, only to be greeted by a standing Tony Stark who knocked him back down. Tony tried to pick the boy up by taking a firm hold on his sides. He stopped due to the words that were spilling out of Peter\u2019s mouth. </p><p>\u201cAck! Noho! Plehease!\u201d Peter giggled, curling in on himself. Tony looked down at the boy in confusion. He did the same thing again and got the same response. </p><p>\u201cNohoho! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d He brought his hands up in defense. He was still laying on the ground, so he held absolutely no power against Tony. </p><p>Tony crouched down to meet the blushing boy. \u201cDon\u2019t do what?\u201d He smirked. Peter, being the innocent kid he his, said the exact answer Tony was looking for. </p><p>\u201cTickle me!\u201d</p><p>Tony smirked. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d He unfolded the Spiderman and collected his wrists. He held them above his head. He started spidering his fingers in the hollows of Peters armpits. The boy kicked, as his legs were still free, but he still couldn\u2019t stop Tony. </p><p>The older of the two drilled his fingers into Peters ribs. Peter practically screamed as he arched his back. Arching his back only exposed his ribs more so he wasn\u2019t really doing himself a favor. Tony walked his fingers down his sides and he swirled his fingers around Peter\u2019s stomach. </p><p>\u201cAre spiders ticklish?\u201d He teased as his fingers circled closer and closer to his belly button. Peter closed his eyes and laughed. He shook his head \u2018no\u2019. This made Tony smile. </p><p>\u201cReally? So you won\u2019t mind if I do this?\u201d He asked as he dipped a finger into Peters navel. Peter yelled and opened his eyes. </p><p>\u201cOh? So spiders ARE ticklish. Hmm, well I think that means you lied to me.\u201d Tony said as he returned his fingers to Peters navel. He dipped a finger in his belly button and wiggled it around. Peter couldn\u2019t do much so he just laughed freely. His legs had stopped flailing because he had become so weak. But Tony wasn\u2019t quite done. </p><p>He kept tickling the kids belly but he moved his face to Peter\u2019s neck. With no words, he blew a raspberry right on the side of his neck. Peter squealed and tried to scrunch up his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cPlehehease!\u201d He yelped out. \u201cPlease what?\u201d Tony asked as he moved his hand down to squeeze Peters knees. The boy bucked. \u201cStohohop tihickling me!\u201d He cried out. Tony was seriously concidering not stopping, but, Peter was just a kid after all. </p><p>He let go of his wrists and removed his hand. Peter lied on the cement, panting and giggling lightly. Tony chuckled. </p><p>\u201cYou did say you wanted a fight. You just never specified what TYPE of fight.\u201d This caused Peter to close his eyes and smile brightly. </p><p>\u201cOh shut up.\u201d</p><p>Peter soon fell asleep. Tony was unsure what to do so he drove him back to his headquarters. He put him in the guest bedroom and left him there to rest. </p><p>Things might finally be resolved between the two. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>I love my ticklish boyyyyyy</p>",

His hands were in his pockets and he had his sunglasses on even though it was dark out. He had been at a bar and was walking back to his car. As he walked down the empty path, he heard something. Footsteps. He didn\u2019t think too much of it, as they weren\u2019t posing any threat to him. But it did seem weird that they sort of appeared out of no where. They were wearing an oversized trench coat and a jet black fedora. They started to walk quicker, as if they were walking towards Tony. </p><p>Tony didn\u2019t want to die so he made a sharp turn into an alley. This is how he would know if the person was following him or just walking. </p><p>He was being followed. </p><p>Tony turned around and faced the figure. The person took off their jacket, revealing a red suit. </p><p>Oh no.</p><p>They reached up and threw off their hat, revealing their face. </p><p>\u201cI thought you moved to Europe, Iron Man.\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well I thought you were done with me. Clearly you aren\u2019t.\u201d Tony snapped back. Peter looked up to meet his eyes. He had on his spider suit but without the mask. He slowly advanced towards Tony. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Pete. I\u2019m not going to fight you. You\u2019re just a kid! I couldn\u2019t hurt a-\u201c he cut himself off as Peters fist was being thrown at Tony\u2019s face. But, with his reflexes he\u2019s built up over the years, he was able to grab the fist before it punched him in the face. </p><p>\u201cNice try, kiddo. But it\u2019s going to take a lot more than that to-\u201c</p><p>A simple swipe from Peters leg hitting Tony\u2019s legs caused the older man to fall. Peter stood above him and looked down. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving without a fight.\u201d Peter growled but it was hard to take him seriously. He was just a boy. Everything he said was adorable. Tony shrugged. </p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d He grabbed Peter\u2019s leg and pulled him to the ground. He started to stand up but Peter lunged on top of him. Tony was trying to grab his arms as Peter was trying to punch him. Tony pushed the boy over so that he fell down on his back. Peter webbed himself back to his feet, only to be greeted by a standing Tony Stark who knocked him back down. Tony tried to pick the boy up by taking a firm hold on his sides. He stopped due to the words that were spilling out of Peter\u2019s mouth. </p><p>\u201cAck! Noho! Plehease!\u201d Peter giggled, curling in on himself. Tony looked down at the boy in confusion. He did the same thing again and got the same response. </p><p>\u201cNohoho! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d He brought his hands up in defense. He was still laying on the ground, so he held absolutely no power against Tony. </p><p>Tony crouched down to meet the blushing boy. \u201cDon\u2019t do what?\u201d He smirked. Peter, being the innocent kid he his, said the exact answer Tony was looking for. </p><p>\u201cTickle me!\u201d</p><p>Tony smirked. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d He unfolded the Spiderman and collected his wrists. He held them above his head. He started spidering his fingers in the hollows of Peters armpits. The boy kicked, as his legs were still free, but he still couldn\u2019t stop Tony. </p><p>The older of the two drilled his fingers into Peters ribs. Peter practically screamed as he arched his back. Arching his back only exposed his ribs more so he wasn\u2019t really doing himself a favor. Tony walked his fingers down his sides and he swirled his fingers around Peter\u2019s stomach. </p><p>\u201cAre spiders ticklish?\u201d He teased as his fingers circled closer and closer to his belly button. Peter closed his eyes and laughed. He shook his head \u2018no\u2019. This made Tony smile. </p><p>\u201cReally? So you won\u2019t mind if I do this?\u201d He asked as he dipped a finger into Peters navel. Peter yelled and opened his eyes. </p><p>\u201cOh? So spiders ARE ticklish. Hmm, well I think that means you lied to me.\u201d Tony said as he returned his fingers to Peters navel. He dipped a finger in his belly button and wiggled it around. Peter couldn\u2019t do much so he just laughed freely. His legs had stopped flailing because he had become so weak. But Tony wasn\u2019t quite done. </p><p>He kept tickling the kids belly but he moved his face to Peter\u2019s neck. With no words, he blew a raspberry right on the side of his neck. Peter squealed and tried to scrunch up his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cPlehehease!\u201d He yelped out. \u201cPlease what?\u201d Tony asked as he moved his hand down to squeeze Peters knees. The boy bucked. \u201cStohohop tihickling me!\u201d He cried out. Tony was seriously concidering not stopping, but, Peter was just a kid after all. </p><p>He let go of his wrists and removed his hand. Peter lied on the cement, panting and giggling lightly. Tony chuckled. </p><p>\u201cYou did say you wanted a fight. You just never specified what TYPE of fight.\u201d This caused Peter to close his eyes and smile brightly. </p><p>\u201cOh shut up.\u201d</p><p>Peter soon fell asleep. Tony was unsure what to do so he drove him back to his headquarters. He put him in the guest bedroom and left him there to rest. </p><p>Things might finally be resolved between the two. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>I love my ticklish boyyyyyy</p>",

Steve had wanted the whole party to be dry, but before he could say that would be too much for his sake, Clint had remarked it for him. </p><p>And now he\u2019s got himself as company, which is just fine. He\u2019s not thinking about how all the people he loves are doing just fine without his input, how it\u2019s probably making their lives better that he\u2019s finally <i>shutting the fuck up. </i></p><p>He\u2019s been annoying them lately, he knows.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s stupid anyway, the stuff he rambles about. He was talking to DUM-E about a new idea and Bruce had asked him to hush. The new coffee had come in and he\u2019d rambled about how nice it was, and he loved it, and Nat had said she couldn\u2019t process that in the morning.</p><p>He knows they love him, doesn\u2019t know how to stop thinking they don\u2019t, knows how weak they\u2019d think he was if they knew the amount of pain it was putting him through at the thought he doesn\u2019t have their approval or affection.</p><p>It\u2019s too much to ask though, that the Merchant of Death could have the kind of love a family brings. He has their tolerance, and he knows that\u2019s lucky. He\u2019s got Steve, for know, a man he\u2019s convinced he\u2019s tricked into loving him, and so he can\u2019t know the way Tony\u2019s mind craves it.</p><p>So he trembles, drinks apple cider and watches on his own, because Steve is busy, and so is everyone else. </p><p>But Steve walks over to him, all old school charm that he doesn\u2019t even knows he has, bashful and beautiful and just a little drunk on Thor\u2019s mead, and smiling at him so bright it just might blind him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Steve says, wrapping his arms around Tony\u2019s waist and blue eyes so warm and fond, faces close like he wants to ask for a kiss but is too shy. 3 months on of loving Tony and he still can\u2019t make himself kiss him without looking like he\u2019s asking for too much. </p><p>But Tony is greedy and Steve is addictive, the feeling of him heady and warm and <i>good </i>and Tony needs good things. He needs Steve in a way it\u2019s embarrassing to admit. </p><p>\u201cHi there gorgeous,\u201d he says, tugging him closer, and Steve preens blushing and his head falling into Tony\u2019s neck, and wow, his boyfriend\u2019s more gone than he thought. </p><p>\u201cMissed you,\u201d and oh, there he is, warm around Tony and pulling him closer because he <i>did, </i>and this confuses things he was thinking of before, because Steve, beautiful, kind, incredible Steve is here loving him, present and good. </p><p>\u201cBeen right here,\u201d he says, letting himself be tender with the man he loves. Steve looks like something plucked from a painting, too good to be real, fondness in everything he does with Tony. It\u2019s almost reverent, the way he touches him, and it\u2019s so unfair, because if one of them is holy, it isn\u2019t Tony.</p><p>\u201cBeen somewhere else,\u201d Steve says, kissing the shell of his ear.</p><p>But he\u2019s not anywhere else right now, not really, when Steve\u2019s so close to him, treats him like he deserves him and more, gives him the best he can.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Steve says, and there is going to be a night where Tony spills how insecure he feels, how his place in this makeshift family always feels like it\u2019s resting on rubble. There\u2019s going to be a day where he breaks open under Steve\u2019s touch like he always was meant to.
