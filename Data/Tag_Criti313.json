        "answer": "<blockquote><p><i>18. things you said when you were scared</i></p></blockquote><p>Beau tries to leave just as Yasha is coming back.</p><p>They run into each other, almost literally, at the entrance to the Leaky Tap. The night outside is dark as ink, the tavern inside empty and still. Yasha looks her up and down, and Beau grits her teeth because she knows how obvious it all looks: travelling cloak crooked over her shoulders, a heavy rucksack slung across her back, eyes rimmed red and wild. Unsteady on her feet and even drunker than she normally would be at this time of night.</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d says Yasha finally.</p><p>\u201cTaking a leaf out of your book,\u201d Beau retorts. \u201cOr a flower, in your case.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Yasha only folds her arms, and just this once Beau wishes she wasn\u2019t so <i>big</i>. She blocks the entire doorway without even trying.</p><p>\u201cI never thought you were the type,\u201d Yasha says lightly. \u201cDoes Jester know?\u201d</p><p>Beau stays silent.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be very upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she snaps, \u201cyou don\u2019t have a fucking monopoly on bailing abruptly in the middle of the night, all right?\u201d</p><p>Yasha doesn\u2019t flinch at her outburst, barely reacts at all. Heat rises in Beau\u2019s neck and she wishes bitterly, wildly, that for <i>once</i> something she did could get a rise out of Yasha, ruffle her even a little bit one way or the other. Instead there she stands like always, right in front of her but completely fucking untouchable.</p><p>Beau\u2019s hands are still shaking. She\u2019s pretty sure she\u2019s not making any sense.</p><p>\u201cI know I don\u2019t,\u201d Yasha is saying, looking straight at her. \u201cBut you just aren\u2019t the type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that already. The type to <i>what?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo leave,\u201d she says, simple as anything.</p><p>Beau snorts. \u201cYou must be worse at reading people than I thought.\u201d</p><p>Yasha doesn\u2019t argue with that. Just keeps standing there with her arms crossed, eyes boring into her.</p><p>She tries to shoulder past her, but Yasha doesn\u2019t budge. Breath hisses through her teeth in frustration. Even so, her next words come out more desperate than angry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll come back, okay?

So please, just&hellip; let me through.&rdquo; Her voice quivers, stumbles over the word <i>please</i>, and she hates it, so much.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever it is,&rdquo; Yasha says, and in that moment Beau also hates Yasha&rsquo;s voice, hates how soft it is, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the group can help you figure it out. You don&rsquo;t have to run, not like this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t fucking get it,&rdquo; she spits. Because Yasha doesn&rsquo;t, she really, really doesn&rsquo;t. Yasha radiates power and rage and determination, and every time she leaves Beau is sure she&rsquo;s running <i>toward</i> something, to something greater. Not like Beau, who has only ever known how to run away.</p><p>Beau reaches blindly into her pocket and flings the crumpled letter at Yasha&rsquo;s chest, the one she didn&rsquo;t even finish reading because its contents don&rsquo;t matter, all that matters is the address on the envelope that tells Beau that he fucking knows where she is. A small part in the rational corner of Beau&rsquo;s mind understands that <i>this</i>, this, sneaking away from the only people who&rsquo;ve ever cared about her in the dead of night, is pretty much the worst response to the situation, but recognizing irrational actions has never stopped her from doing them.</p><p>The last time a letter like this, a letter from her father (and after all this time, she still chokes around that word) found its way into her hands, she ran away from the Cobalt Soul. But she found her way back to them, eventually. She tells herself she&rsquo;ll do the same for the Mighty Nein. For now, though, for now she can hear the thud of her own heartbeat in her ears, her hands still won&rsquo;t stop shaking, and she doesn&rsquo;t want to fucking deal with any of it.</p><p>Yasha doesn&rsquo;t uncross her arms to catch the letter like Beau expected she would. Instead it bounces off of her elbow and drops to the six inches of floor space between their feet. On inexplicable instinct, Beau bends over to try to grab it, only to trip and fall forward because she&rsquo;s even more fucked-up-drunk than she&rsquo;d thought.</p><p>Yasha doesn&rsquo;t catch her. </p><p>For the first time it hits Beau that maybe Yasha is something other than infuriatingly calm tonight.</p><p>Yasha always, always catches her.</p><p>Beau sits dazed on her ass for a good five seconds before Yasha finally unfreezes. She kneels down to Beau&rsquo;s side and touches her shoulder, eyes widening.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; she mutters. &ldquo;Shit, Beau, are you all right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;M fine.&rdquo; The stupid letter lies forgotten somewhere beneath them, turning soggy from the damp floor. &ldquo;Just drunk, is all. Slipped.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve stopped shaking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve started,&rdquo; she points out, because it&rsquo;s true. Yasha&rsquo;s hand is trembling ever so slightly, so subtly that Beau wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed if it wasn&rsquo;t currently pressed against the skin of her shoulder. But she does notice, and it cleaves through some of the raw panic that had been taking root in her gut since she saw her father&rsquo;s handwriting.</p><p>She begins to suspect that Yasha&rsquo;s eerie stillness was never a testament to her composure at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Yasha says quietly, so that Beau almost doesn&rsquo;t hear it.</p><p>Her hand on Beau&rsquo;s shoulder is a hard grip now, tight enough to bruise.</p><p>Beau just blinks. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m being unfair,&rdquo; murmurs Yasha, not looking at her face. &ldquo;I know. But I just&mdash;I think I always assumed that whenever I came back, you would still be here, waiting for me.&rdquo; A tinge of pink touches her cheeks, like a lightning strike, like a revelation.</p><p>Breath and words catch in Beau&rsquo;s throat.</p><p>A charged, unbearable moment, and Yasha adds, lamely, &ldquo;The group, I mean. I thought the group would be here waiting.&rdquo;</p><p>The half-admission hangs fragile in the air between them and just like that, it&rsquo;s as if the woman who&rsquo;s stolen Beau&rsquo;s breath and words and poise away since the moment they met has stolen her fear now, too&mdash;or maybe it would be more accurate to say that Beau is giving it all to her, taking herself slowly apart piece by piece and laying it all ugly and bare at Yasha&rsquo;s feet and into the gaps between the fingers that are still squeezing Beau&rsquo;s shoulder, until all that&rsquo;s left is the steadied thud, thud, thud of her heart and the faint pink in Yasha&rsquo;s face. </p><p>When Yasha finally meets her gaze again, all Beau can do is lift a hand, and squeeze back, and wait.</p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<blockquote><p><i>18. things you said when you were scared</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>Beau tries to leave just as Yasha is coming back.</p>\n<p>They run into each other, almost literally, at the entrance to the Leaky Tap. The night outside is dark as ink, the tavern inside empty and still. Yasha looks her up and down, and Beau grits her teeth because she knows how obvious it all looks: travelling cloak crooked over her shoulders, a heavy rucksack slung across her back, eyes rimmed red and wild. Unsteady on her feet and even drunker than she normally would be at this time of night.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Going somewhere?&rdquo; says Yasha finally.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Taking a leaf out of your book,&rdquo; Beau retorts. &ldquo;Or a flower, in your case.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",

I just started playing D&amp;D 5e last September so next month it\u2019ll officially be one year. That\u2019s nothing compared to the people who\u2019ve played it since the franchise was born, I get that. </p><p>But I started watching CR two months before I started playing. I knew NOTHING about D&amp;D. Absolutey no experience. It took me two months to finish all of campaign 1. I didn\u2019t own the player\u2019s handbook yet but i pretty much knew the rules like the back of my hand by episode 70. It compelled me to take to Reddit and found a group in my area to play a home game. Let me say, I got incredibly lucky with my first group. They\u2019re easily becoming my closest friends and they\u2019re so good at RP. The past two sessions have felt so close to being like CR, I\u2019m being real. One of them actually told me when he introduced his friend to us he asked \u201chow did you meet them again?\u201d And he told him through reddit.
