Podcasts really are popular and almost everyone listens to them. They were amazing on radio. Maybe podcasting can be a new platform for them to explore where they can bring the old fanbase and make new fans who dont really watch youtube. What do you think????",
        "answer": "<p>I think that considering the success they have each had on multiple platforms throughout their careers, they probably have plenty of opportunities available to them should they want to branch out. Given their experience in radio, I think they could be very successful with a podcast. However, especially if they were going to do a podcast together, I think they would have to really change up their dynamic if they wanted to avoid appealing mostly to phannies. I think the biggest thing they each need to do if they ever decide that they want to try to gain back some of the people who outgrew them over the years or appeal to a new audience is to drop the personas. A podcast would be a great medium for that and considering how enjoyable people found Dan\u2019s liveshows, I think it would be a great medium for him in particular. Who knows what he wants at this point though? </p>",

I\u2019d love to see Phil (and Dan, obviously) make a comeback on his channel with something I could genuinely praise, but he has to want that and right now I just don\u2019t see that from him; he seems to just want to cash in on what fame he has left with minimal effort.

This should come as a shock to no one, but I wasn&rsquo;t amused by the spon in the middle of a video that already had multiple ads and was being made because it was one of the only things promised to people paying subscription fees (even though it is also available to people who don&rsquo;t pay, which is one of the reasons why the membership is a rip-off). I&rsquo;m not opposed to spons in general, when they fit with the brand and are done in a way that they add something to the content or at the very least don&rsquo;t interrupt and take away from it. Dan and Phil have both talked at length about the importance of doing spons well over the years and did them well for years, so to see Phil sell out in this way is not something I respect. He&rsquo;s making very sporadic lazy content this year and the fact that he is increasing spons at the same time demonstrates a lack of integrity to me that is very different from how he has behaved in the past. </p><p>As for the video itself, it seemed like something I would have expected to see on YouTube back in 2014. Phil started a few trends in his day and, while I don&rsquo;t think he is the &ldquo;genius&rdquo; some people make him out to be, he is very creative, but every video that has come out this year has been based on recycled ideas or stale trends. Of course I am not shocked that a sponned video contained several mentions of Dan and gave the tinhats &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; fodder for their conspiracy theories, which they ate up eagerly, but to me it just highlighted his absence from the platform, which is the elephant in the room during every AmazingPhil video and, in my opinion, that&rsquo;s a big problem for Phil: it&rsquo;s not his place to address what Dan is doing, but since his channel featured Dan so heavily for so long, not addressing it feels wrong and as if something is missing. I do think that Phil could get past that if he made some really good creative content or did some collabs with other people, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem invested enough to do that at this point and to be blunt, I&rsquo;m not sure how much longer I&rsquo;ll keep watching the kind of content he is putting out now. It&rsquo;s just not good. </p><p>The video was barely ten minutes, less if you take out the advertisement, and most of the questions he answered were boring and curated, rather than being things that gave us new insight into him and his content. A few months ago I would have praised him for his answer to the social anxiety question, like I did when he talked about being comfortable with not having a lot of sexual experience, but I think it&rsquo;s just too little, too late for me at this point. I really hate to see old YouTube go down. I&rsquo;d love to see Phil (and Dan, obviously) make a comeback on his channel with something I could genuinely praise, but he has to want that and right now I just don&rsquo;t see that from him; he seems to just want to cash in on what fame he has left with minimal effort. That&rsquo;s my take. </p></p>",

It was relatively dark out, but thanks to the full moon, there was illumination over the deck that offered enough light for Dan to see the smile spreading over Phil\u2019s face once his torso was exposed.</p><p>Phil offered the same service, though not being so gentle about it, and removed Dan\u2019s shirt as quickly as he possibly could. Once their chests were both naked, they came together without having to think about it, kissing each other deeply. Their lips met and Dan hummed into the kiss, running his hands through Phil\u2019s drooping quiff and giving it a light tug. Phil moaned and pressed his hips to Dan\u2019s, and though it was nice and Dan would have loved to continue that, it wasn\u2019t what they were there for.</p><p>He pulled away and Phil started to chase after his lips, making Dan giggle. Phil pouted, but didn\u2019t protest. They continued under dressing, shorts discarded along with their shirts, and when they slipped into the cool water, it felt a bit like heaven on their hot skin. They both swam around leisurely, careful not to splash or make too much noise. Though they had avoided being caught thus far, neither were eager for their temporary roommates to find them.</p><p>After a little bit, Phil draped himself over the edge of the pool, kicking his legs out to keep himself afloat. Dan swam slowly to him, a predatory smile on his face. When he was close enough, he grabbed the ledge and braced himself around Phil.</p><p>\u201cWater\u2019s nice,\u201d Phil murmured quietly, nosing at the crease of Dan\u2019s neck.</p><p>Dan hummed in response to Phil\u2019s words and to the feeling of feather-light kisses being pressed into one of his most sensitive areas.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss it here.\u201d Phil\u2019s breath blew gently, and Dan felt a shiver run through him. He had barely been touched yet, and he already felt desperate for Phil to touch him more.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Maybe we\u2019ll get a house with a pool someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a garden?\u201d Each word was punctuated with a kiss; to Dan\u2019s neck, his jaw, his cheek, and then a quick one to his lips.</p><p>\u201cAnything you want, darling.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes, but he still had a small smile pulling at his lips. Dan pulled himself a little closer, causing Phil to wrap his long legs around Dan\u2019s waist. The weight made Dan sink a bit, but he just used his newly developed arm muscles to keep them afloat.</p><p>\u201cWant you,\u201d Phil replied, bringing his lips back to Dan\u2019s jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou have me.\u201d</p><p>Phil worked on sucking a mark onto a spot on Dan\u2019s collarbone that could easily be covered with a shirt, and Dan let out a quiet noise at the feeling. He wasn\u2019t 19 anymore, so the action alone didn\u2019t make his cock swell, but Phil reaching between them to wrap his long fingers around him certainly did.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have sex in the pool,\u201d Dan scolded, though the message was rendered a bit useless given the way that he couldn\u2019t stop the groan that left him, and the way he thrusted forward into Phil\u2019s fist.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Phil squeezed gently, smirking at the shaky breath it caused Dan to make. \u201cI\u2019ve got lube that we can use in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, what the -!\u201d Phil removed his hand, the last thing Dan wanted, and covered his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDan! You have to be quiet. I don\u2019t particularly want to have my brother, or his girlfriend, come out here and see me with my hand around my boyfriends dick.\u201d</p><p>Dan licked Phil\u2019s hand, grinning when he jerked his hand away, making a disgusted face.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were into voyeurism?\u201d</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes. \u201cVoyeurism is watching people fuck, <i>exhibitionism</i> is being watched. And I\u2019m not into either.\u201d</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t respond to that, thinking of every time Phil\u2019s hand had worked its way up Dan\u2019s thigh and over his crotch anytime they were in a public place that offered a little bit of coverage. Instead, he pressed Phil closer to the edge of the pool, their bodies pressing tightly together.</p><p>\u201cLube, huh? Is that where you thought this would end up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped.\u201d Phil gave him a cheeky smile and leaned his head back down to resume his work on the mark he had started.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence.\u201d</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t pick up his head, but shrugged his shoulders, like he knew but didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>Dan pushed back a little, floating towards the middle of the pool and leaving Phil pouting on the edge. \u201cWell, come on, then.\u201d</p><p>He made his way to the shallow end of the pool, where their feet could reach the bottom of the pool, though their shoulders still hovered in the water. Phil gave him that smile that made something pull deep in his stomach and moved to be next to Dan.</p><p>When Phil was close enough, Dan pulled him back to him and held him aloft. He leaned in close so that he could whisper into Phil\u2019s ear, grinning at the way it made him tremble. \u201cDo you wanna play?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded eagerly, and moved away to their mound of discarded clothes, rifling around until he produced the bottle of expensive lube they had found in a shop a few days ago. It was oil based and didn\u2019t bother Phil\u2019s sensitive skin, and though it had come with a hefty price, they had bought it with the pool in mind (though Dan liked to pretend this was all Phil\u2019s idea).</p><p>Dan pulled him back into his embrace when Phil was close enough and kissed him soundly. That\u2019s all they did for a while - letting each other explore the other\u2019s mouth and pulling and grabbing at each other, hands growing more frantic with time.</p><p>\u201cTurn around and grab the edge for me,\u201d Dan said, after pulling away from the kiss. He was a bit breathless, but it was the best feeling. Phil could have all of his breath if he would just kiss him like that for the rest of his life.</p><p>That smirk was back on Phil\u2019s face, but he listened. He positioned himself on the edge of the pool, body facing away from Dan and out into the greenery surrounding the house. Dan was sure that there would never be anything as beautiful than Phil, bathed in moonlight and surrounded by warm water, waiting patiently for Dan to ravish him.</p><p>He wasted no time crowding Phil and pressing his naked chest to Phil\u2019s freckled back. A content hum left them at the same time, and Phil giggled a bit, though he kept his position.</p><p>\u201cHands behind your back,\u201d Dan whispered.</p><p>Phil obliged, bringing both arms behind him and clasping his hands together. The way that Phil listened, with no hesitation, just giving Dan what he wanted, made Dan\u2019s heart beat a little harder. Nothing would ever be sexier than the way that Phil trusted him so deeply.</p><p>Dan popped the top of the lube and drizzled a bit on his fingers. He wasn\u2019t sure how well it would work once it hit the water, but was pleasantly surprised when his fingers met the soft skin of Phil\u2019s rim and it was still slippery.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked and waited for Phil\u2019s nod to plunge the first finger in.</p><p>They let out matching huffs of breath at the breach, and Dan grinned into the skin of Phil\u2019s back. He moved his finger in and out slowly, reveling in the breathy moans that left Phil, and the way that his body sucked Dan\u2019s finger in. Sometimes this was all they wanted. Sex wasn\u2019t always about sex - sometimes it was just touching and feeling each other.</p><p>\u201cAnother,\u201d Phil gasped, wiggling his bum a bit.</p><p>\u201cGreedy tonight?\u201d Dan slid another finger in beside the first and felt his cock throb, knowing how warm and tight Phil would be when he finally pressed in.</p><p>\u201cIs there really a time when I\u2019m not?\u201d Phil looked back over his shoulder at Dan, cheeky smile spread out across his face.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t respond, just moved his fingers a little quicker. Phil huffed out a surprised breath and moved back onto Dan\u2019s fingers more. His arms laid unused and still clasped behind his back, not even trying to move them.</p><p>\u201cSuch a good boy,\u201d he whispered against Phil\u2019s neck, watching as goosebumps broke out across his flesh. Though it was Dan that mostly got off on praise, they were both privy to the knowledge that Phil could get just as worked up over a few sweet words uttered into the warmth of his skin.</p><p>\u201cMore, please.\u201d Phil sounded like he was getting desperate, and another wave of arousal coursed through Dan.</p><p>Pulling his fingers out to coat them in more lube, Dan took a second just to admire Phil. There were no words for all the things that Dan felt deep in his chest for this man. He was everything Dan could have ever wanted, and by some miracle, Phil had chosen Dan. He would never be able to articulate how much he loved him, so he tried to show him by attempting to give him even a taste of the pleasure that just having Phil in his life gave him.</p><p>\u201cStop staring at my ass and do it,\u201d Phil whined at him. It made a snort leave Dan and he pressed back in. Leave it to Phil to interrupt his cheesy thoughts because he wanted sex.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I want.\u201d</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t bother replying, just let out a sigh of happiness at the stretch of Dan\u2019s third finger.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Phil to be ready after that. Dan pulled away and poured a liberal amount of lube on his hand, touching his aching dick for the first time. He groaned and bowed his head at the feeling. Phil stuck his ass out, swaying his hips to entice Dan and peeking at him over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Dan stopped stroking himself and lined up with Phil\u2019s rim. He waited until Phil whined high in his throat before he pressed in slowly.</p><p>\u201c<i>Oh!</i>,\u201d Phil breathed, head falling back, eyes rolling a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good,\u201d Dan whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, though it was likely he hadn\u2019t even heard what Dan was saying.</p><p>After a few gentle thrusts, Dan stilled and gripped onto Phil\u2019s shoulders. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded eagerly, and Dan wasted no more time, using his leverage on Phil\u2019s shoulders and thrusting in sharply. The water sloshed around them, creating tiny waves that crashed over the edge of the pool, but neither cared. They were far too lost in the push and pull of their bodies.</p><p>A litany of moans and whines was leaving Phil, too loud for the setting, so Dan moved his hand to where it was gripping onto Phil\u2019s shoulder to instead cover his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be quiet. Don\u2019t want to get caught, right?\u201d</p><p>Exhibitionist or not, Dan knew that the mere mention of getting caught worked Phil up, so he got closer, changing his deep thrusts to grinding little circles, and whispered into Phil\u2019s ear. \u201cWhat if someone were to walk out here right now? Everyone would see how well you take me. How good you make me feel.\u201d</p><p>The whines that left Phil were muffled by Dan\u2019s hand. He murmured something against Dan\u2019s palm, but Dan didn\u2019t need to hear him to know what he was saying. Phil\u2019s hands were gripping onto themselves, knuckles white, his thighs quaking - clear signs that he was close.</p><p>All it took was two more deep thrusts and Phil became rigid, clenching so tight around Dan that he didn\u2019t have any warning before he was coming and filling Phil up.</p><p>They rode out their highs together, slow, sloppy thrusts and heavy breathing. Dan stilled after a moment and gently pulled out. Phil\u2019s arms were drooping, but they remained clasped. He gently undid the grip and wrapped his arms around Phil, face pressed against his back.</p><p>\u201cThat was good,\u201d Phil slurred, body draped over the edge of the pool. Dan suspected if they weren\u2019t in the water, Phil would be in a puddle on the ground.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Neither moved for a while, just choosing to listen to the sounds of the jungle around them, the nighttime sounds soothing.</p><p>\u201cWanna go inside?\u201d</p><p>Phil hummed in response. \u201cIce cream?\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a snort of laughter and let go of Phil, grabbing his hand and steering him towards the pool stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spoiled, you know?\u201d</p><p>Phil pressed a kiss to Dan\u2019s cheek and gave him a pleased smile. \u201cI know, but I\u2019m <i>your</i> spoiled.\u201d</p><p>Instead of pointing out how little sense that made, Dan just lead the way back inside. Phil was right, after all: he was Dan\u2019s, and he didn\u2019t want it any other way.</p>",

Phil stuck his ass out, swaying his hips to entice Dan and peeking at him over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Dan stopped stroking himself and lined up with Phil\u2019s rim. He waited until Phil whined high in his throat before he pressed in slowly.</p><p>\u201c<i>Oh!</i>,\u201d Phil breathed, head falling back, eyes rolling a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good,\u201d Dan whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, though it was likely he hadn\u2019t even heard what Dan was saying.</p><p>After a few gentle thrusts, Dan stilled and gripped onto Phil\u2019s shoulders. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded eagerly, and Dan wasted no more time, using his leverage on Phil\u2019s shoulders and thrusting in sharply. The water sloshed around them, creating tiny waves that crashed over the edge of the pool, but neither cared. They were far too lost in the push and pull of their bodies.</p><p>A litany of moans and whines was leaving Phil, too loud for the setting, so Dan moved his hand to where it was gripping onto Phil\u2019s shoulder to instead cover his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be quiet. Don\u2019t want to get caught, right?\u201d</p><p>Exhibitionist or not, Dan knew that the mere mention of getting caught worked Phil up, so he got closer, changing his deep thrusts to grinding little circles, and whispered into Phil\u2019s ear. \u201cWhat if someone were to walk out here right now? Everyone would see how well you take me. How good you make me feel.\u201d</p><p>The whines that left Phil were muffled by Dan\u2019s hand. He murmured something against Dan\u2019s palm, but Dan didn\u2019t need to hear him to know what he was saying. Phil\u2019s hands were gripping onto themselves, knuckles white, his thighs quaking - clear signs that he was close.</p><p>All it took was two more deep thrusts and Phil became rigid, clenching so tight around Dan that he didn\u2019t have any warning before he was coming and filling Phil up.</p><p>They rode out their highs together, slow, sloppy thrusts and heavy breathing. Dan stilled after a moment and gently pulled out. Phil\u2019s arms were drooping, but they remained clasped. He gently undid the grip and wrapped his arms around Phil, face pressed against his back.</p><p>\u201cThat was good,\u201d Phil slurred, body draped over the edge of the pool. Dan suspected if they weren\u2019t in the water, Phil would be in a puddle on the ground.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Neither moved for a while, just choosing to listen to the sounds of the jungle around them, the nighttime sounds soothing.</p><p>\u201cWanna go inside?\u201d</p><p>Phil hummed in response. \u201cIce cream?\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a snort of laughter and let go of Phil, grabbing his hand and steering him towards the pool stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spoiled, you know?\u201d</p><p>Phil pressed a kiss to Dan\u2019s cheek and gave him a pleased smile. \u201cI know, but I\u2019m <i>your</i> spoiled.\u201d</p><p>Instead of pointing out how little sense that made, Dan just lead the way back inside. Phil was right, after all: he was Dan\u2019s, and he didn\u2019t want it any other way.</p>",

It was relatively dark out, but thanks to the full moon, there was illumination over the deck that offered enough light for Dan to see the smile spreading over Phil\u2019s face once his torso was exposed.</p><p>Phil offered the same service, though not being so gentle about it, and removed Dan\u2019s shirt as quickly as he possibly could. Once their chests were both naked, they came together without having to think about it, kissing each other deeply. Their lips met and Dan hummed into the kiss, running his hands through Phil\u2019s drooping quiff and giving it a light tug. Phil moaned and pressed his hips to Dan\u2019s, and though it was nice and Dan would have loved to continue that, it wasn\u2019t what they were there for.</p><p>He pulled away and Phil started to chase after his lips, making Dan giggle. Phil pouted, but didn\u2019t protest. They continued under dressing, shorts discarded along with their shirts, and when they slipped into the cool water, it felt a bit like heaven on their hot skin. They both swam around leisurely, careful not to splash or make too much noise. Though they had avoided being caught thus far, neither were eager for their temporary roommates to find them.</p><p>After a little bit, Phil draped himself over the edge of the pool, kicking his legs out to keep himself afloat. Dan swam slowly to him, a predatory smile on his face. When he was close enough, he grabbed the ledge and braced himself around Phil.</p><p>\u201cWater\u2019s nice,\u201d Phil murmured quietly, nosing at the crease of Dan\u2019s neck.</p><p>Dan hummed in response to Phil\u2019s words and to the feeling of feather-light kisses being pressed into one of his most sensitive areas.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss it here.\u201d Phil\u2019s breath blew gently, and Dan felt a shiver run through him. He had barely been touched yet, and he already felt desperate for Phil to touch him more.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Maybe we\u2019ll get a house with a pool someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a garden?\u201d Each word was punctuated with a kiss; to Dan\u2019s neck, his jaw, his cheek, and then a quick one to his lips.</p><p>\u201cAnything you want, darling.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes, but he still had a small smile pulling at his lips. Dan pulled himself a little closer, causing Phil to wrap his long legs around Dan\u2019s waist. The weight made Dan sink a bit, but he just used his newly developed arm muscles to keep them afloat.</p><p>\u201cWant you,\u201d Phil replied, bringing his lips back to Dan\u2019s jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou have me.\u201d</p><p>Phil worked on sucking a mark onto a spot on Dan\u2019s collarbone that could easily be covered with a shirt, and Dan let out a quiet noise at the feeling. He wasn\u2019t 19 anymore, so the action alone didn\u2019t make his cock swell, but Phil reaching between them to wrap his long fingers around him certainly did.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have sex in the pool,\u201d Dan scolded, though the message was rendered a bit useless given the way that he couldn\u2019t stop the groan that left him, and the way he thrusted forward into Phil\u2019s fist.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Phil squeezed gently, smirking at the shaky breath it caused Dan to make. \u201cI\u2019ve got lube that we can use in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, what the -!\u201d Phil removed his hand, the last thing Dan wanted, and covered his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDan! You have to be quiet. I don\u2019t particularly want to have my brother, or his girlfriend, come out here and see me with my hand around my boyfriends dick.\u201d</p><p>Dan licked Phil\u2019s hand, grinning when he jerked his hand away, making a disgusted face.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were into voyeurism?\u201d</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes. \u201cVoyeurism is watching people fuck, <i>exhibitionism</i> is being watched. And I\u2019m not into either.\u201d</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t respond to that, thinking of every time Phil\u2019s hand had worked its way up Dan\u2019s thigh and over his crotch anytime they were in a public place that offered a little bit of coverage. Instead, he pressed Phil closer to the edge of the pool, their bodies pressing tightly together.</p><p>\u201cLube, huh? Is that where you thought this would end up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped.\u201d Phil gave him a cheeky smile and leaned his head back down to resume his work on the mark he had started.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence.\u201d</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t pick up his head, but shrugged his shoulders, like he knew but didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>Dan pushed back a little, floating towards the middle of the pool and leaving Phil pouting on the edge. \u201cWell, come on, then.\u201d</p><p>He made his way to the shallow end of the pool, where their feet could reach the bottom of the pool, though their shoulders still hovered in the water. Phil gave him that smile that made something pull deep in his stomach and moved to be next to Dan.</p><p>When Phil was close enough, Dan pulled him back to him and held him aloft. He leaned in close so that he could whisper into Phil\u2019s ear, grinning at the way it made him tremble. \u201cDo you wanna play?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded eagerly, and moved away to their mound of discarded clothes, rifling around until he produced the bottle of expensive lube they had found in a shop a few days ago. It was oil based and didn\u2019t bother Phil\u2019s sensitive skin, and though it had come with a hefty price, they had bought it with the pool in mind (though Dan liked to pretend this was all Phil\u2019s idea).</p><p>Dan pulled him back into his embrace when Phil was close enough and kissed him soundly. That\u2019s all they did for a while - letting each other explore the other\u2019s mouth and pulling and grabbing at each other, hands growing more frantic with time.</p><p>\u201cTurn around and grab the edge for me,\u201d Dan said, after pulling away from the kiss. He was a bit breathless, but it was the best feeling. Phil could have all of his breath if he would just kiss him like that for the rest of his life.</p><p>That smirk was back on Phil\u2019s face, but he listened. He positioned himself on the edge of the pool, body facing away from Dan and out into the greenery surrounding the house. Dan was sure that there would never be anything as beautiful than Phil, bathed in moonlight and surrounded by warm water, waiting patiently for Dan to ravish him.</p><p>He wasted no time crowding Phil and pressing his naked chest to Phil\u2019s freckled back. A content hum left them at the same time, and Phil giggled a bit, though he kept his position.</p><p>\u201cHands behind your back,\u201d Dan whispered.</p><p>Phil obliged, bringing both arms behind him and clasping his hands together. The way that Phil listened, with no hesitation, just giving Dan what he wanted, made Dan\u2019s heart beat a little harder. Nothing would ever be sexier than the way that Phil trusted him so deeply.</p><p>Dan popped the top of the lube and drizzled a bit on his fingers. He wasn\u2019t sure how well it would work once it hit the water, but was pleasantly surprised when his fingers met the soft skin of Phil\u2019s rim and it was still slippery.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked and waited for Phil\u2019s nod to plunge the first finger in.</p><p>They let out matching huffs of breath at the breach, and Dan grinned into the skin of Phil\u2019s back. He moved his finger in and out slowly, reveling in the breathy moans that left Phil, and the way that his body sucked Dan\u2019s finger in. Sometimes this was all they wanted. Sex wasn\u2019t always about sex - sometimes it was just touching and feeling each other.</p><p>\u201cAnother,\u201d Phil gasped, wiggling his bum a bit.</p><p>\u201cGreedy tonight?\u201d Dan slid another finger in beside the first and felt his cock throb, knowing how warm and tight Phil would be when he finally pressed in.</p><p>\u201cIs there really a time when I\u2019m not?\u201d Phil looked back over his shoulder at Dan, cheeky smile spread out across his face.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t respond, just moved his fingers a little quicker. Phil huffed out a surprised breath and moved back onto Dan\u2019s fingers more. His arms laid unused and still clasped behind his back, not even trying to move them.</p><p>\u201cSuch a good boy,\u201d he whispered against Phil\u2019s neck, watching as goosebumps broke out across his flesh. Though it was Dan that mostly got off on praise, they were both privy to the knowledge that Phil could get just as worked up over a few sweet words uttered into the warmth of his skin.</p><p>\u201cMore, please.\u201d Phil sounded like he was getting desperate, and another wave of arousal coursed through Dan.</p><p>Pulling his fingers out to coat them in more lube, Dan took a second just to admire Phil. There were no words for all the things that Dan felt deep in his chest for this man. He was everything Dan could have ever wanted, and by some miracle, Phil had chosen Dan. He would never be able to articulate how much he loved him, so he tried to show him by attempting to give him even a taste of the pleasure that just having Phil in his life gave him.</p><p>\u201cStop staring at my ass and do it,\u201d Phil whined at him. It made a snort leave Dan and he pressed back in. Leave it to Phil to interrupt his cheesy thoughts because he wanted sex.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I want.\u201d</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t bother replying, just let out a sigh of happiness at the stretch of Dan\u2019s third finger.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Phil to be ready after that. Dan pulled away and poured a liberal amount of lube on his hand, touching his aching dick for the first time. He groaned and bowed his head at the feeling.

And I&rsquo;m not into either.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan didn&rsquo;t respond to that, thinking of every time Phil&rsquo;s hand had worked its way up Dan&rsquo;s thigh and over his crotch anytime they were in a public place that offered a little bit of coverage. Instead, he pressed Phil closer to the edge of the pool, their bodies pressing tightly together.</p><p>&ldquo;Lube, huh? Is that where you thought this would end up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hoped.&rdquo; Phil gave him a cheeky smile and leaned his head back down to resume his work on the mark he had started.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bad influence.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil didn&rsquo;t pick up his head, but shrugged his shoulders, like he knew but didn&rsquo;t really care.</p><p>Dan pushed back a little, floating towards the middle of the pool and leaving Phil pouting on the edge. &ldquo;Well, come on, then.&rdquo;</p><p>He made his way to the shallow end of the pool, where their feet could reach the bottom of the pool, though their shoulders still hovered in the water. Phil gave him that smile that made something pull deep in his stomach and moved to be next to Dan.</p><p>When Phil was close enough, Dan pulled him back to him and held him aloft. He leaned in close so that he could whisper into Phil&rsquo;s ear, grinning at the way it made him tremble. &ldquo;Do you wanna play?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nodded eagerly, and moved away to their mound of discarded clothes, rifling around until he produced the bottle of expensive lube they had found in a shop a few days ago. It was oil based and didn&rsquo;t bother Phil&rsquo;s sensitive skin, and though it had come with a hefty price, they had bought it with the pool in mind (though Dan liked to pretend this was all Phil&rsquo;s idea).</p><p>Dan pulled him back into his embrace when Phil was close enough and kissed him soundly. That&rsquo;s all they did for a while - letting each other explore the other&rsquo;s mouth and pulling and grabbing at each other, hands growing more frantic with time.</p><p>&ldquo;Turn around and grab the edge for me,&rdquo; Dan said, after pulling away from the kiss. He was a bit breathless, but it was the best feeling. Phil could have all of his breath if he would just kiss him like that for the rest of his life.</p><p>That smirk was back on Phil&rsquo;s face, but he listened. He positioned himself on the edge of the pool, body facing away from Dan and out into the greenery surrounding the house. Dan was sure that there would never be anything as beautiful than Phil, bathed in moonlight and surrounded by warm water, waiting patiently for Dan to ravish him.</p><p>He wasted no time crowding Phil and pressing his naked chest to Phil&rsquo;s freckled back. A content hum left them at the same time, and Phil giggled a bit, though he kept his position.</p><p>&ldquo;Hands behind your back,&rdquo; Dan whispered.</p><p>Phil obliged, bringing both arms behind him and clasping his hands together. The way that Phil listened, with no hesitation, just giving Dan what he wanted, made Dan&rsquo;s heart beat a little harder. Nothing would ever be sexier than the way that Phil trusted him so deeply.</p><p>Dan popped the top of the lube and drizzled a bit on his fingers. He wasn&rsquo;t sure how well it would work once it hit the water, but was pleasantly surprised when his fingers met the soft skin of Phil&rsquo;s rim and it was still slippery.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; he asked and waited for Phil&rsquo;s nod to plunge the first finger in.</p><p>They let out matching huffs of breath at the breach, and Dan grinned into the skin of Phil&rsquo;s back. He moved his finger in and out slowly, reveling in the breathy moans that left Phil, and the way that his body sucked Dan&rsquo;s finger in. Sometimes this was all they wanted. Sex wasn&rsquo;t always about sex - sometimes it was just touching and feeling each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Another,&rdquo; Phil gasped, wiggling his bum a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Greedy tonight?&rdquo; Dan slid another finger in beside the first and felt his cock throb, knowing how warm and tight Phil would be when he finally pressed in.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there really a time when I&rsquo;m not?&rdquo; Phil looked back over his shoulder at Dan, cheeky smile spread out across his face.</p><p>Dan didn&rsquo;t respond, just moved his fingers a little quicker. Phil huffed out a surprised breath and moved back onto Dan&rsquo;s fingers more. His arms laid unused and still clasped behind his back, not even trying to move them.</p><p>&ldquo;Such a good boy,&rdquo; he whispered against Phil&rsquo;s neck, watching as goosebumps broke out across his flesh. Though it was Dan that mostly got off on praise, they were both privy to the knowledge that Phil could get just as worked up over a few sweet words uttered into the warmth of his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;More, please.&rdquo; Phil sounded like he was getting desperate, and another wave of arousal coursed through Dan.</p><p>Pulling his fingers out to coat them in more lube, Dan took a second just to admire Phil. There were no words for all the things that Dan felt deep in his chest for this man. He was everything Dan could have ever wanted, and by some miracle, Phil had chosen Dan. He would never be able to articulate how much he loved him, so he tried to show him by attempting to give him even a taste of the pleasure that just having Phil in his life gave him.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop staring at my ass and do it,&rdquo; Phil whined at him. It made a snort leave Dan and he pressed back in. Leave it to Phil to interrupt his cheesy thoughts because he wanted sex.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I want.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil didn&rsquo;t bother replying, just let out a sigh of happiness at the stretch of Dan&rsquo;s third finger.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Phil to be ready after that. Dan pulled away and poured a liberal amount of lube on his hand, touching his aching dick for the first time. He groaned and bowed his head at the feeling. Phil stuck his ass out, swaying his hips to entice Dan and peeking at him over his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting.&rdquo;</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Dan stopped stroking himself and lined up with Phil&rsquo;s rim. He waited until Phil whined high in his throat before he pressed in slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Oh!</i>,&rdquo; Phil breathed, head falling back, eyes rolling a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;You feel so good,&rdquo; Dan whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil replied, though it was likely he hadn&rsquo;t even heard what Dan was saying.</p><p>After a few gentle thrusts, Dan stilled and gripped onto Phil&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nodded eagerly, and Dan wasted no more time, using his leverage on Phil&rsquo;s shoulders and thrusting in sharply. The water sloshed around them, creating tiny waves that crashed over the edge of the pool, but neither cared. They were far too lost in the push and pull of their bodies.</p><p>A litany of moans and whines was leaving Phil, too loud for the setting, so Dan moved his hand to where it was gripping onto Phil&rsquo;s shoulder to instead cover his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to be quiet. Don&rsquo;t want to get caught, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Exhibitionist or not, Dan knew that the mere mention of getting caught worked Phil up, so he got closer, changing his deep thrusts to grinding little circles, and whispered into Phil&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;What if someone were to walk out here right now? Everyone would see how well you take me. How good you make me feel.&rdquo;</p><p>The whines that left Phil were muffled by Dan&rsquo;s hand. He murmured something against Dan&rsquo;s palm, but Dan didn&rsquo;t need to hear him to know what he was saying. Phil&rsquo;s hands were gripping onto themselves, knuckles white, his thighs quaking - clear signs that he was close.</p><p>All it took was two more deep thrusts and Phil became rigid, clenching so tight around Dan that he didn&rsquo;t have any warning before he was coming and filling Phil up.</p><p>They rode out their highs together, slow, sloppy thrusts and heavy breathing. Dan stilled after a moment and gently pulled out. Phil&rsquo;s arms were drooping, but they remained clasped. He gently undid the grip and wrapped his arms around Phil, face pressed against his back.</p><p>&ldquo;That was good,&rdquo; Phil slurred, body draped over the edge of the pool. Dan suspected if they weren&rsquo;t in the water, Phil would be in a puddle on the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Neither moved for a while, just choosing to listen to the sounds of the jungle around them, the nighttime sounds soothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna go inside?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil hummed in response. &ldquo;Ice cream?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan let out a snort of laughter and let go of Phil, grabbing his hand and steering him towards the pool stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re spoiled, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil pressed a kiss to Dan&rsquo;s cheek and gave him a pleased smile. &ldquo;I know, but I&rsquo;m <i>your</i> spoiled.&rdquo;</p><p>Instead of pointing out how little sense that made, Dan just lead the way back inside. Phil was right, after all: he was Dan&rsquo;s, and he didn&rsquo;t want it any other way.</p>",

        "body": "<p><b>Summary</b>: Phil Lester was a worker for the BBC in London. Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br/></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 3.4k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing\u00a0</p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit </p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday around 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/44162515\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.w.tt%2FwRz3waENjV&amp;t=NGFjYWY1NzMyNWI3MDZiOGYwM2JiYzVhNzJkZWY4MTliMGUzYWQ5ZCx0a2VnbklQRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aj-hMZ5Lp9HeXbc-IdwveRg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fyiffandquiff.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183680620282%2Fi-want-it-i-got-it-chapter-16&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">WATTPAD</a>**</b></p><p><b>A/N: I\u2019m heading off to see Endgame so you get the chapter 3 hours early! :)\u00a0</b></p><!-- more --><p>Phil didn\u2019t know what sadness truly was until he was walking through London Heathrow airport with his tail between his legs and his bag on his shoulders, dried tears on his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt had been the saddest goodbye he\u2019d ever had to give someone and frankly, he used to say that was definitely when he had left his parent\u2019s home to go to Uni in Manchester.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut he\u2019s hurting and he feels like he left a bit of his heart in Los Angeles with Dan. And as he steps foot into his flat, jet lag kicking his ass, he cries harder than he allowed himself to in LAX after leaving Dan behind.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe feels a bit ashamed about it. He feels like he shouldn\u2019t be crying over leaving Dan in Los Angeles because Dan found out the night before he\u2019ll be in London in a few weeks time for a movie premiere. But as Phil thinks about the way Dan cried at the airport as he said one last goodbye in the car outside, he cries that much harder.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s supposed to go pick up Spike from PJ but he feels lousy and like he needs a day to recuperate. But he also knows that PJ is going to want to hear about Dan and LA and he\u2019s not quite sure if he wants to speak about that yet.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen the last of his tears stop and he texts Dan to tell him he made it back okay, he takes a cool shower to wash off the stench of airplane and then gets dressed and heads out to the nearest tube station to go to PJ\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ answers the door when he gets there and Spike is immediately attacking Phil\u2019s legs, trying to get his attention. Phil didn\u2019t realize how much he missed his energetic pup until he was picking him up and cuddling him against his chest as he squirmed.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow was he?\u201d Phil asked, running his hand through Spike\u2019s fur.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe was great!\u201d PJ said, opening the door wider so Phil could walk inside of his flat. \u201cOnly destroyed one slipper but I got it from Poundland so no harm done.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a snort and let his pup back down on the floor so he could continue to sniff and run around Phil\u2019s legs.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you want any food or a drink?\u201d PJ asks, moving quickly towards the kitchen. \u201cNo offense mate but you look a bit sickly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head and followed PJ to the counter where he sat on one of the stools. PJ passed him a glass of water and Phil picked it up, taking a long sip of it, not realizing how dehydrated he felt. \u201cI\u2019m pretty jet lagged if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d Phil answers finally. \u201cThese time zones are kicking my ass.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow was Dan?\u201d PJ asks, seemingly out of the blue. Phil doesn\u2019t know why it catches him off guard but it does.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI mean, he had a few things he had to go to that I went with him to but other than that, we mostly just stayed in.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAny saucy details?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks up from his glass of water and sees the way PJ is smirking at him. Phil feels his face flush as he thinks about the night before\u2015was it the night before? Time zones are confusing\u2026where he and Dan shared such intimate moments together. His stomach tingled at the thought of having sex with Dan and how glorious it had felt. And they had sex twice. The first time and then another time later that night before they went to sleep. Phil was honestly never forget the sight of Dan coming undone above him as he rode him so well.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not getting into them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo?\u201d PJ picks. \u201cDidn\u2019t go dancing in the sheets?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil blushed and hid his face as he laughed nervously. \u201cPeej!\u201d He cried. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about my sex life.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh!\u201d PJ exclaimed, poking a finger into Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cSo there IS a sex life to be spoken about! How was it? Did you both\u2026rock each others worlds?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil groaned and put his hands back down as he cocked his eyebrow at PJ and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not saying.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut you\u2019re blushing!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMaybe so.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ gave him an all knowing smile and then rested against the counter on his elbows. \u201cI talked with Louise a bit and she was saying how she has some new projects for us to work on when you return back to work.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLike what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ swatted his hand in the air. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026probably some bloody useless thing that Louise is too lazy to do herself.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil groaned again. He wasn\u2019t fully in the mood to go back to work and he wasn\u2019t fully in the mood to deal with anything Louise was going to throw his way. Especially when he\u2019s been struggling a bit with thinking about the BBC in context with his future ever since he had that conversation with Dan. In fact, it\u2019s been gnawing at him a bit.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI really am not ready to go back.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen is your first day?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTomorrow.\u201d Phil answers. \u201cLouise only gave me a week, including traveling. I didn\u2019t get a lot of time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat sucks mate.\u201d PJ says. \u201cSuppose I shouldn\u2019t keep you then so you can go back to your flat and relax for the evening.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded, standing up and pulling down his sweatshirt that had come as he sat. He bent down and picked up Spike in his arms before walking with PJ to grab Spike\u2019s things and put the backpack onto his back.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil took the tube back to his flat and as soon as he walked inside and let Spike go, he clambered over to his couch and laid down, shutting his eyes and falling nearly immediately to sleep.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\tJet lag fucked Phil over.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt fucked Phil over because it was currently 3am and he was sitting wide awake with a mug of coffee in his hand as he scrolled through his social media on his laptop. He\u2019d taken about a six hour snooze that afternoon and was paying the price now as he struggled to fall back asleep. He pretty much gave up a half an hour ago and resided to just staying up.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019d tried texting Dan but he knew he wasn\u2019t going to answer because Dan was currently flying out to New York for the next few days to film one final scene for his movie before it goes into post-production.\u00a0</p><p>\tSo Dan was honestly probably on a plane somewhere else and he wouldn\u2019t get to talk to him until tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>\tFuck, he missed Dan so damn much.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis eyes well up a bit again and he wills for himself to not cry. He\u2019s done enough of that. He\u2019ll be seeing Dan soon. He has to keep reminding himself of that. Dan will be back in London in just a few weeks and they\u2019ll be here, in Phil\u2019s flat. It\u2019ll be okay.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sets down his mug of coffee on his night stand and lays back down in his bed, shutting his laptop screen. He closes his eyes and tries to get himself to maybe get a few more hours.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey don\u2019t ever come before his alarm goes off at seven but he still wished he could have.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe dresses and leaves his flat, giving Spike plenty of hugs and kisses and belly rubs on the way out to make up for not being around much. He manages to get himself onto the tube and then get to the BBC without anything major happening.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe gets let into the building and then on the way up to his office, he finds himself the be the product of stares and even a few glares. He shakes them off and tries to ignore them as he makes his way to his office.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil takes a seat and digs out his laptop and his little keychain that he bought for Darcy and sets them on his desk. When he looks back up, PJ is looking at him with an intense stare that doesn\u2019t quite compute with the same warm greeting he had gotten yesterday at PJ\u2019s flat.\u00a0</p><p>\tTo say he\u2019s confused is an understatement.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy is everyone staring at me today?\u201d Phil finds himself grumbling. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHave you not seen literally all of the stories on social media?\u201d PJ asks, his voice a bit higher in octave.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shakes his head. He honestly hasn\u2019t posted much on social media, nor has he been on it. The last he posted was to say he was posting a new video this week.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMate, your pictures with Dan are literally slapped all over Twitter. Even the tabloids that are hitting the shelves have you as their cover photo.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Phil asks, feeling his stomach twist and knot within him.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe immediately pries open the top of his laptop and opens up Safari. He googles Dan\u2019s name and immediately is bombarded with 50+ search results for stories all about him and Dan\u2019s day out in LA\u2026one of the tabloids even got a photo of them eating alone, in private.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou look pretty cosy with Dan.\u201d PJ says.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Phil asks, feeling his voice rise a bit in tension.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNothing, really but are you and Dan dating?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his skin heat up and his face flush a bit in a mix of anger and also anxiety. \u201cYes.\u201d He says, his voice wavering a bit. \u201cDan\u2019s my boyfriend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIs this just recently or\u2026?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPJ, you know this this. Dan and I just got together when I was in LA.\u201d Phil says, his voice laced with some disbelief. He didn\u2019t even know where this was coming from. \u201cThese pictures, PJ, were taken without Dan and I\u2019s permission. They were taken by some low-life paparazzi\u2019s who want to sell their photos of famous people to tabloids to make money.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPj threw his hands up and sat back in his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get angry.\u201d PJ began. \u201cI just simply wanted to know\u2015friend to friend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his blood cool down a bit as he relaxed back into his own seat and let out a long sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, PJ. That wasn\u2019t fair to snap at you\u2026it\u2019s just, now that I\u2019m beginning to see what Dan goes through each day, it\u2019s hard to not get defensive when something like this happens.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d PJ says. \u201cI also didn\u2019t mean to suddenly get defensive either. I know it\u2019s not my place to know about you and Dan. I honestly just think I\u2019m still a bit shocked at the entire thing if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out an incredulous laugh. \u201cIt is all a bit mental when you think about it. Like who have thought last year at this time that looking forward, I\u2019d be dating the world famous Daniel Howell.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s right crazy.\u201d PJ says. \u201cBut, as long as you\u2019re happy, I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m happy, Peej.\u201d Phil adds. \u201cDan has to come to London in a few weeks for a premiere that he needs to attend. Maybe we can arrange a time for you to come over to my flat and properly meet him? I think you\u2019ll really get along well with him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ smiles at him and nods. \u201cI\u2019m sure Sophie will be excited for that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil forgot how much Sophie fangirled over Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tJust as he opens his mouth to speak something more about it, the door to Louise\u2019s office opens and Phil looks up just in time to see her poke her blonde hair outside of the frame. \u201cLigouri and Lester, come to my office so we can discuss your next projects!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gives a glance to PJ who gives one back and Phil stands up, picking up his laptop and the key chain before he follows PJ to Louise office and they shut the door behind them.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cNew York is cool and all but it\u2019s cold and a bit damp and I really want to be back in the sun.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil chuckles as he reads Dan\u2019s text out loud to himself.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>You\u2019ll never make it in London\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil types back his message and then locks his phone and sets it beside him on the couch. Spike was at his feet, gnawing on a play bone that Phil had gotten him in consolation of leaving him for so long. Phil was supposed to be working on his new project that Louise had given him and PJ. But he honestly felt like he couldn\u2019t be bothered and he didn\u2019t know whether or not that a good thing at the moment.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was busy working on editing his video when his mum called and asked about LA so he told her all about it. And then his brother called right after and he got sidetracked when Dan texted just now.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe had promised his subscribers that he would get out a new video this week with someone special and they already figured out it was Dan and now they\u2019re even more excited for the video. So the pressure on him right now was pretty great.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut he honestly forgets all of that when Dan texts him and it\u2019s like he placed back into an alternate reality.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>guess well just have to live in LA then :(</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>you\u2019re also forgetting that i used to live in wokingham lol\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>i just like the sun of LA</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s heart picked up speed. Did Dan just reference them living together? He felt a bit foolish, getting his hopes up so high when they\u2019ve barely been together. He already can feel that Dan is his person but that still doesn\u2019t help the anxieties that plague his mind.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>Don\u2019t want to move to London and live with the queen?\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>Move to LA and you\u2019ll be with trump?\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>fuck nevermind lol ill move to London\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lets out a snort and rolls onto his side on the couch, Spike\u2019s head picking up a bit as he looked at Phil to see what he was doing. He did feel a bit restless. The jet lag was still sitting heavy behind his eyes. Maybe he\u2019d take Spike to the park.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked down at his pup, who was now rolled onto his back. He bent forward and rubbed Spike\u2019s belly, causing Spike to jerk and look at him. \u201cWant to go to park?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike immediately rolled over and stood up, prancing. Phil chuckled and got up, pushing his phone in his pocket long enough to walk to the closet and grab Spike\u2019s lead.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe bent down and hooked it on him before grabbing the necessary items like a doggy bag and stuffing them into his pocket. He walked out the door with Spike practically dragging him and headed down the street to the park.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe continued to text Dan the entire way, only stopping when Spike nearly pulled him into a light pole. When they got to the park, Phil found an empty bench near an open area of grass, currently unoccupied and let Spike off from his lead to run around a bit. Spike never went far, and if he did, a simple call of his name always brought him back to Phil.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched his carefully and eyed the people around him. He didn\u2019t know why, but he had an uneasy feeling creeping under his skin. He couldn\u2019t quite place in his mind where it was coming from, but the instinct to look behind him overcame his thoughts and he turned his head, only to see no one even around him besides a young couple and their child, walking down the dirt path.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe let himself relax as he enjoyed the slight breeze in the air as Spike eventually ran his energy out and he was back at Phil\u2019s feet, huffing and puffing and whining for a treat. Phil reached in his pocket and pulled one out, sneaking it to Spike. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy, but I need to stop giving you so many treats.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe ruffled Spike\u2019s fur a bit before re-hooking his lead and getting up from the bench. They walked towards the exit of the park and Phil was just deciding he might take Spike to the new pet-friendly cafe just a few blocks away when he heard it.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe click.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe thought he was imagining it at first, his anxiety getting the better of him. But then there was another\u2026and another\u2026and suddenly, he turned around and there was something with a camera, crouched down at the ground, taking photos of him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil panicked. What does he do? Does he say something? This has to be just a paparazzi?\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil Lester!\u201d The man called out, lowering his camera. \u201cDo you mind telling me where Daniel Howell is?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2015.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you and Daniel Howell dating?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil bent down, picked up Spike in his arms, and ran. He doesn\u2019t know how far he ran or where he even went, he just did. And he eventually landed way farther than he had intended with his flat on the complete other side of the park.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe let down Spike, but not before taking a few deep breaths into his fur to calm him down. He still doesn\u2019t know what that was. He doesn\u2019t even know what to do. He feels his chest tighten and he wills himself to stay clam.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was just paparazzi. It was just paparazzi.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe finds himself reaching into his pocket and calling his mum as he takes Spike\u2019s lead in his hand and starts walking him in the correct direction.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cChild!\u201d His mum said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMum, a paparazzi just took photos of me and Spike at the park and he started asking me questions and I didn\u2019t know what I could do so I ran and I don\u2019t even quite know where I am all that I know is\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, honey, calm down. Please take a breath!\u201d His mum soothed. \u201cWhat was the paparazzi asking?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThey were asking about me and Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd did you say anything?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo. I panicked and I just said no to their first question and ran off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI told you we should look into getting someone, Phil. Someone who can help you out.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMum,\u201d Phil finds himself saying. \u201cI don\u2019t think getting someone like that is going to help. I\u2019m not even sure what that was that just happened.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt was a paparazzi trying to get into yours and Dan\u2019s business, sweetheart.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his heart de-flat because he knew that. He wasn\u2019t stupid. But that doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t bother him or it shouldn\u2019t bother him.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut what do I do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHis mum sighed on the other end. \u201cSweetie, I\u2019m not sure I have the answer for that question.\u201d She said gently. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk with Dan about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Dan is who I should be talking to about this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, it\u2019s his lifestyle that you\u2019re getting mixed up in, Philip.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil bit his lip. He didn\u2019t want to get into this right now. He called for advice and a little bit of coddling and he wasn\u2019t ready to get a full conversation handed to him about \u201cDan\u2019s life\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into this right now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t want you hurt, Phil. I really don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know, mum.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe finds himself already at the door of his flat and he sighs in relief as he fishes his keys out of his pocket and pushes himself inside.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe let\u2019s Spike in the flat first and let\u2019s the little pup fly through the flat towards his food and water dishes in the kitchen. He says a quick goodbye to his mum with a promise to call her later and then feels himself fall onto the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\tMaybe watching some TV for a little bit will help him out?\u00a0</p><p>\tHe reaches for the remote to this TV, which he doesn\u2019t use that often, and turns it on, flipping through the channels. He\u2019s about ready to press the Netflix button on his remote when a finds himself on some entertainment news station that he\u2019s never paid any attention to before.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut his mouth drops open and he feels like he\u2019s going to vomit as he watches him and Dan walking together in The Grove on his very screen in front of him. It was when they were walking from the restaurant to the little place where they ate their food. And as if Phil couldn\u2019t feel sick enough, the headline on the bottom read:\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDaniel Howell SPOTTED with His New Beau in Los Angeles!\u201d\u00a0</p>",

And as he steps foot into his flat, jet lag kicking his ass, he cries harder than he allowed himself to in LAX after leaving Dan behind.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe feels a bit ashamed about it. He feels like he shouldn\u2019t be crying over leaving Dan in Los Angeles because Dan found out the night before he\u2019ll be in London in a few weeks time for a movie premiere. But as Phil thinks about the way Dan cried at the airport as he said one last goodbye in the car outside, he cries that much harder.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s supposed to go pick up Spike from PJ but he feels lousy and like he needs a day to recuperate. But he also knows that PJ is going to want to hear about Dan and LA and he\u2019s not quite sure if he wants to speak about that yet.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen the last of his tears stop and he texts Dan to tell him he made it back okay, he takes a cool shower to wash off the stench of airplane and then gets dressed and heads out to the nearest tube station to go to PJ\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ answers the door when he gets there and Spike is immediately attacking Phil\u2019s legs, trying to get his attention. Phil didn\u2019t realize how much he missed his energetic pup until he was picking him up and cuddling him against his chest as he squirmed.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow was he?\u201d Phil asked, running his hand through Spike\u2019s fur.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe was great!\u201d PJ said, opening the door wider so Phil could walk inside of his flat. \u201cOnly destroyed one slipper but I got it from Poundland so no harm done.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a snort and let his pup back down on the floor so he could continue to sniff and run around Phil\u2019s legs.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you want any food or a drink?\u201d PJ asks, moving quickly towards the kitchen. \u201cNo offense mate but you look a bit sickly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head and followed PJ to the counter where he sat on one of the stools. PJ passed him a glass of water and Phil picked it up, taking a long sip of it, not realizing how dehydrated he felt. \u201cI\u2019m pretty jet lagged if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d Phil answers finally. \u201cThese time zones are kicking my ass.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow was Dan?\u201d PJ asks, seemingly out of the blue. Phil doesn\u2019t know why it catches him off guard but it does.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI mean, he had a few things he had to go to that I went with him to but other than that, we mostly just stayed in.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAny saucy details?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks up from his glass of water and sees the way PJ is smirking at him. Phil feels his face flush as he thinks about the night before\u2015was it the night before? Time zones are confusing\u2026where he and Dan shared such intimate moments together. His stomach tingled at the thought of having sex with Dan and how glorious it had felt. And they had sex twice. The first time and then another time later that night before they went to sleep. Phil was honestly never forget the sight of Dan coming undone above him as he rode him so well.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not getting into them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo?\u201d PJ picks. \u201cDidn\u2019t go dancing in the sheets?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil blushed and hid his face as he laughed nervously. \u201cPeej!\u201d He cried. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about my sex life.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh!\u201d PJ exclaimed, poking a finger into Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cSo there IS a sex life to be spoken about! How was it? Did you both\u2026rock each others worlds?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil groaned and put his hands back down as he cocked his eyebrow at PJ and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not saying.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut you\u2019re blushing!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMaybe so.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ gave him an all knowing smile and then rested against the counter on his elbows. \u201cI talked with Louise a bit and she was saying how she has some new projects for us to work on when you return back to work.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLike what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ swatted his hand in the air. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026probably some bloody useless thing that Louise is too lazy to do herself.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil groaned again. He wasn\u2019t fully in the mood to go back to work and he wasn\u2019t fully in the mood to deal with anything Louise was going to throw his way. Especially when he\u2019s been struggling a bit with thinking about the BBC in context with his future ever since he had that conversation with Dan. In fact, it\u2019s been gnawing at him a bit.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI really am not ready to go back.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen is your first day?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTomorrow.\u201d Phil answers. \u201cLouise only gave me a week, including traveling. I didn\u2019t get a lot of time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat sucks mate.\u201d PJ says. \u201cSuppose I shouldn\u2019t keep you then so you can go back to your flat and relax for the evening.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded, standing up and pulling down his sweatshirt that had come as he sat. He bent down and picked up Spike in his arms before walking with PJ to grab Spike\u2019s things and put the backpack onto his back.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil took the tube back to his flat and as soon as he walked inside and let Spike go, he clambered over to his couch and laid down, shutting his eyes and falling nearly immediately to sleep.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\tJet lag fucked Phil over.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt fucked Phil over because it was currently 3am and he was sitting wide awake with a mug of coffee in his hand as he scrolled through his social media on his laptop. He\u2019d taken about a six hour snooze that afternoon and was paying the price now as he struggled to fall back asleep. He pretty much gave up a half an hour ago and resided to just staying up.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019d tried texting Dan but he knew he wasn\u2019t going to answer because Dan was currently flying out to New York for the next few days to film one final scene for his movie before it goes into post-production.\u00a0</p><p>\tSo Dan was honestly probably on a plane somewhere else and he wouldn\u2019t get to talk to him until tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>\tFuck, he missed Dan so damn much.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis eyes well up a bit again and he wills for himself to not cry. He\u2019s done enough of that. He\u2019ll be seeing Dan soon. He has to keep reminding himself of that. Dan will be back in London in just a few weeks and they\u2019ll be here, in Phil\u2019s flat. It\u2019ll be okay.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sets down his mug of coffee on his night stand and lays back down in his bed, shutting his laptop screen. He closes his eyes and tries to get himself to maybe get a few more hours.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey don\u2019t ever come before his alarm goes off at seven but he still wished he could have.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe dresses and leaves his flat, giving Spike plenty of hugs and kisses and belly rubs on the way out to make up for not being around much. He manages to get himself onto the tube and then get to the BBC without anything major happening.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe gets let into the building and then on the way up to his office, he finds himself the be the product of stares and even a few glares. He shakes them off and tries to ignore them as he makes his way to his office.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil takes a seat and digs out his laptop and his little keychain that he bought for Darcy and sets them on his desk. When he looks back up, PJ is looking at him with an intense stare that doesn\u2019t quite compute with the same warm greeting he had gotten yesterday at PJ\u2019s flat.\u00a0</p><p>\tTo say he\u2019s confused is an understatement.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy is everyone staring at me today?\u201d Phil finds himself grumbling. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHave you not seen literally all of the stories on social media?\u201d PJ asks, his voice a bit higher in octave.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shakes his head. He honestly hasn\u2019t posted much on social media, nor has he been on it. The last he posted was to say he was posting a new video this week.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMate, your pictures with Dan are literally slapped all over Twitter. Even the tabloids that are hitting the shelves have you as their cover photo.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Phil asks, feeling his stomach twist and knot within him.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe immediately pries open the top of his laptop and opens up Safari. He googles Dan\u2019s name and immediately is bombarded with 50+ search results for stories all about him and Dan\u2019s day out in LA\u2026one of the tabloids even got a photo of them eating alone, in private.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou look pretty cosy with Dan.\u201d PJ says.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Phil asks, feeling his voice rise a bit in tension.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNothing, really but are you and Dan dating?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his skin heat up and his face flush a bit in a mix of anger and also anxiety. \u201cYes.\u201d He says, his voice wavering a bit. \u201cDan\u2019s my boyfriend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIs this just recently or\u2026?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPJ, you know this this. Dan and I just got together when I was in LA.\u201d Phil says, his voice laced with some disbelief. He didn\u2019t even know where this was coming from. \u201cThese pictures, PJ, were taken without Dan and I\u2019s permission. They were taken by some low-life paparazzi\u2019s who want to sell their photos of famous people to tabloids to make money.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPj threw his hands up and sat back in his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get angry.\u201d PJ began. \u201cI just simply wanted to know\u2015friend to friend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his blood cool down a bit as he relaxed back into his own seat and let out a long sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, PJ. That wasn\u2019t fair to snap at you\u2026it\u2019s just, now that I\u2019m beginning to see what Dan goes through each day, it\u2019s hard to not get defensive when something like this happens.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d PJ says. \u201cI also didn\u2019t mean to suddenly get defensive either. I know it\u2019s not my place to know about you and Dan. I honestly just think I\u2019m still a bit shocked at the entire thing if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out an incredulous laugh. \u201cIt is all a bit mental when you think about it. Like who have thought last year at this time that looking forward, I\u2019d be dating the world famous Daniel Howell.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s right crazy.\u201d PJ says. \u201cBut, as long as you\u2019re happy, I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m happy, Peej.\u201d Phil adds. \u201cDan has to come to London in a few weeks for a premiere that he needs to attend. Maybe we can arrange a time for you to come over to my flat and properly meet him? I think you\u2019ll really get along well with him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ smiles at him and nods. \u201cI\u2019m sure Sophie will be excited for that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil forgot how much Sophie fangirled over Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tJust as he opens his mouth to speak something more about it, the door to Louise\u2019s office opens and Phil looks up just in time to see her poke her blonde hair outside of the frame. \u201cLigouri and Lester, come to my office so we can discuss your next projects!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gives a glance to PJ who gives one back and Phil stands up, picking up his laptop and the key chain before he follows PJ to Louise office and they shut the door behind them.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cNew York is cool and all but it\u2019s cold and a bit damp and I really want to be back in the sun.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil chuckles as he reads Dan\u2019s text out loud to himself.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>You\u2019ll never make it in London\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil types back his message and then locks his phone and sets it beside him on the couch. Spike was at his feet, gnawing on a play bone that Phil had gotten him in consolation of leaving him for so long. Phil was supposed to be working on his new project that Louise had given him and PJ. But he honestly felt like he couldn\u2019t be bothered and he didn\u2019t know whether or not that a good thing at the moment.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was busy working on editing his video when his mum called and asked about LA so he told her all about it. And then his brother called right after and he got sidetracked when Dan texted just now.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe had promised his subscribers that he would get out a new video this week with someone special and they already figured out it was Dan and now they\u2019re even more excited for the video. So the pressure on him right now was pretty great.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut he honestly forgets all of that when Dan texts him and it\u2019s like he placed back into an alternate reality.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>guess well just have to live in LA then :(</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>you\u2019re also forgetting that i used to live in wokingham lol\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>i just like the sun of LA</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s heart picked up speed. Did Dan just reference them living together? He felt a bit foolish, getting his hopes up so high when they\u2019ve barely been together. He already can feel that Dan is his person but that still doesn\u2019t help the anxieties that plague his mind.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>Don\u2019t want to move to London and live with the queen?\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>Move to LA and you\u2019ll be with trump?\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>fuck nevermind lol ill move to London\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lets out a snort and rolls onto his side on the couch, Spike\u2019s head picking up a bit as he looked at Phil to see what he was doing. He did feel a bit restless. The jet lag was still sitting heavy behind his eyes. Maybe he\u2019d take Spike to the park.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked down at his pup, who was now rolled onto his back. He bent forward and rubbed Spike\u2019s belly, causing Spike to jerk and look at him. \u201cWant to go to park?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike immediately rolled over and stood up, prancing. Phil chuckled and got up, pushing his phone in his pocket long enough to walk to the closet and grab Spike\u2019s lead.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe bent down and hooked it on him before grabbing the necessary items like a doggy bag and stuffing them into his pocket. He walked out the door with Spike practically dragging him and headed down the street to the park.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe continued to text Dan the entire way, only stopping when Spike nearly pulled him into a light pole. When they got to the park, Phil found an empty bench near an open area of grass, currently unoccupied and let Spike off from his lead to run around a bit. Spike never went far, and if he did, a simple call of his name always brought him back to Phil.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched his carefully and eyed the people around him. He didn\u2019t know why, but he had an uneasy feeling creeping under his skin. He couldn\u2019t quite place in his mind where it was coming from, but the instinct to look behind him overcame his thoughts and he turned his head, only to see no one even around him besides a young couple and their child, walking down the dirt path.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe let himself relax as he enjoyed the slight breeze in the air as Spike eventually ran his energy out and he was back at Phil\u2019s feet, huffing and puffing and whining for a treat. Phil reached in his pocket and pulled one out, sneaking it to Spike. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy, but I need to stop giving you so many treats.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe ruffled Spike\u2019s fur a bit before re-hooking his lead and getting up from the bench. They walked towards the exit of the park and Phil was just deciding he might take Spike to the new pet-friendly cafe just a few blocks away when he heard it.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe click.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe thought he was imagining it at first, his anxiety getting the better of him. But then there was another\u2026and another\u2026and suddenly, he turned around and there was something with a camera, crouched down at the ground, taking photos of him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil panicked. What does he do? Does he say something? This has to be just a paparazzi?\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil Lester!\u201d The man called out, lowering his camera. \u201cDo you mind telling me where Daniel Howell is?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2015.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you and Daniel Howell dating?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil bent down, picked up Spike in his arms, and ran. He doesn\u2019t know how far he ran or where he even went, he just did. And he eventually landed way farther than he had intended with his flat on the complete other side of the park.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe let down Spike, but not before taking a few deep breaths into his fur to calm him down. He still doesn\u2019t know what that was. He doesn\u2019t even know what to do. He feels his chest tighten and he wills himself to stay clam.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was just paparazzi. It was just paparazzi.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe finds himself reaching into his pocket and calling his mum as he takes Spike\u2019s lead in his hand and starts walking him in the correct direction.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cChild!\u201d His mum said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMum, a paparazzi just took photos of me and Spike at the park and he started asking me questions and I didn\u2019t know what I could do so I ran and I don\u2019t even quite know where I am all that I know is\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, honey, calm down. Please take a breath!\u201d His mum soothed. \u201cWhat was the paparazzi asking?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThey were asking about me and Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd did you say anything?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo. I panicked and I just said no to their first question and ran off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI told you we should look into getting someone, Phil. Someone who can help you out.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMum,\u201d Phil finds himself saying. \u201cI don\u2019t think getting someone like that is going to help. I\u2019m not even sure what that was that just happened.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt was a paparazzi trying to get into yours and Dan\u2019s business, sweetheart.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his heart de-flat because he knew that. He wasn\u2019t stupid. But that doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t bother him or it shouldn\u2019t bother him.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut what do I do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHis mum sighed on the other end. \u201cSweetie, I\u2019m not sure I have the answer for that question.\u201d She said gently. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk with Dan about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Dan is who I should be talking to about this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, it\u2019s his lifestyle that you\u2019re getting mixed up in, Philip.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil bit his lip. He didn\u2019t want to get into this right now. He called for advice and a little bit of coddling and he wasn\u2019t ready to get a full conversation handed to him about \u201cDan\u2019s life\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into this right now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t want you hurt, Phil. I really don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know, mum.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe finds himself already at the door of his flat and he sighs in relief as he fishes his keys out of his pocket and pushes himself inside.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe let\u2019s Spike in the flat first and let\u2019s the little pup fly through the flat towards his food and water dishes in the kitchen. He says a quick goodbye to his mum with a promise to call her later and then feels himself fall onto the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\tMaybe watching some TV for a little bit will help him out?\u00a0</p><p>\tHe reaches for the remote to this TV, which he doesn\u2019t use that often, and turns it on, flipping through the channels. He\u2019s about ready to press the Netflix button on his remote when a finds himself on some entertainment news station that he\u2019s never paid any attention to before.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut his mouth drops open and he feels like he\u2019s going to vomit as he watches him and Dan walking together in The Grove on his very screen in front of him. It was when they were walking from the restaurant to the little place where they ate their food. And as if Phil couldn\u2019t feel sick enough, the headline on the bottom read:\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDaniel Howell SPOTTED with His New Beau in Los Angeles!\u201d\u00a0</p>",

However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star.

And as he steps foot into his flat, jet lag kicking his ass, he cries harder than he allowed himself to in LAX after leaving Dan behind.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe feels a bit ashamed about it. He feels like he shouldn\u2019t be crying over leaving Dan in Los Angeles because Dan found out the night before he\u2019ll be in London in a few weeks time for a movie premiere. But as Phil thinks about the way Dan cried at the airport as he said one last goodbye in the car outside, he cries that much harder.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s supposed to go pick up Spike from PJ but he feels lousy and like he needs a day to recuperate. But he also knows that PJ is going to want to hear about Dan and LA and he\u2019s not quite sure if he wants to speak about that yet.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen the last of his tears stop and he texts Dan to tell him he made it back okay, he takes a cool shower to wash off the stench of airplane and then gets dressed and heads out to the nearest tube station to go to PJ\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ answers the door when he gets there and Spike is immediately attacking Phil\u2019s legs, trying to get his attention. Phil didn\u2019t realize how much he missed his energetic pup until he was picking him up and cuddling him against his chest as he squirmed.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow was he?\u201d Phil asked, running his hand through Spike\u2019s fur.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe was great!\u201d PJ said, opening the door wider so Phil could walk inside of his flat. \u201cOnly destroyed one slipper but I got it from Poundland so no harm done.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a snort and let his pup back down on the floor so he could continue to sniff and run around Phil\u2019s legs.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you want any food or a drink?\u201d PJ asks, moving quickly towards the kitchen. \u201cNo offense mate but you look a bit sickly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head and followed PJ to the counter where he sat on one of the stools. PJ passed him a glass of water and Phil picked it up, taking a long sip of it, not realizing how dehydrated he felt. \u201cI\u2019m pretty jet lagged if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d Phil answers finally. \u201cThese time zones are kicking my ass.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow was Dan?\u201d PJ asks, seemingly out of the blue. Phil doesn\u2019t know why it catches him off guard but it does.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI mean, he had a few things he had to go to that I went with him to but other than that, we mostly just stayed in.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAny saucy details?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks up from his glass of water and sees the way PJ is smirking at him. Phil feels his face flush as he thinks about the night before\u2015was it the night before? Time zones are confusing\u2026where he and Dan shared such intimate moments together. His stomach tingled at the thought of having sex with Dan and how glorious it had felt. And they had sex twice. The first time and then another time later that night before they went to sleep. Phil was honestly never forget the sight of Dan coming undone above him as he rode him so well.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not getting into them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo?\u201d PJ picks. \u201cDidn\u2019t go dancing in the sheets?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil blushed and hid his face as he laughed nervously. \u201cPeej!\u201d He cried. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about my sex life.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh!\u201d PJ exclaimed, poking a finger into Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cSo there IS a sex life to be spoken about! How was it? Did you both\u2026rock each others worlds?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil groaned and put his hands back down as he cocked his eyebrow at PJ and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not saying.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut you\u2019re blushing!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMaybe so.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ gave him an all knowing smile and then rested against the counter on his elbows. \u201cI talked with Louise a bit and she was saying how she has some new projects for us to work on when you return back to work.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLike what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ swatted his hand in the air. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026probably some bloody useless thing that Louise is too lazy to do herself.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil groaned again. He wasn\u2019t fully in the mood to go back to work and he wasn\u2019t fully in the mood to deal with anything Louise was going to throw his way. Especially when he\u2019s been struggling a bit with thinking about the BBC in context with his future ever since he had that conversation with Dan. In fact, it\u2019s been gnawing at him a bit.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI really am not ready to go back.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen is your first day?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cTomorrow.\u201d Phil answers. \u201cLouise only gave me a week, including traveling. I didn\u2019t get a lot of time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat sucks mate.\u201d PJ says. \u201cSuppose I shouldn\u2019t keep you then so you can go back to your flat and relax for the evening.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded, standing up and pulling down his sweatshirt that had come as he sat. He bent down and picked up Spike in his arms before walking with PJ to grab Spike\u2019s things and put the backpack onto his back.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil took the tube back to his flat and as soon as he walked inside and let Spike go, he clambered over to his couch and laid down, shutting his eyes and falling nearly immediately to sleep.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\tJet lag fucked Phil over.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt fucked Phil over because it was currently 3am and he was sitting wide awake with a mug of coffee in his hand as he scrolled through his social media on his laptop. He\u2019d taken about a six hour snooze that afternoon and was paying the price now as he struggled to fall back asleep. He pretty much gave up a half an hour ago and resided to just staying up.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019d tried texting Dan but he knew he wasn\u2019t going to answer because Dan was currently flying out to New York for the next few days to film one final scene for his movie before it goes into post-production.\u00a0</p><p>\tSo Dan was honestly probably on a plane somewhere else and he wouldn\u2019t get to talk to him until tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>\tFuck, he missed Dan so damn much.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis eyes well up a bit again and he wills for himself to not cry. He\u2019s done enough of that. He\u2019ll be seeing Dan soon. He has to keep reminding himself of that. Dan will be back in London in just a few weeks and they\u2019ll be here, in Phil\u2019s flat. It\u2019ll be okay.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sets down his mug of coffee on his night stand and lays back down in his bed, shutting his laptop screen. He closes his eyes and tries to get himself to maybe get a few more hours.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey don\u2019t ever come before his alarm goes off at seven but he still wished he could have.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe dresses and leaves his flat, giving Spike plenty of hugs and kisses and belly rubs on the way out to make up for not being around much. He manages to get himself onto the tube and then get to the BBC without anything major happening.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe gets let into the building and then on the way up to his office, he finds himself the be the product of stares and even a few glares. He shakes them off and tries to ignore them as he makes his way to his office.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil takes a seat and digs out his laptop and his little keychain that he bought for Darcy and sets them on his desk. When he looks back up, PJ is looking at him with an intense stare that doesn\u2019t quite compute with the same warm greeting he had gotten yesterday at PJ\u2019s flat.\u00a0</p><p>\tTo say he\u2019s confused is an understatement.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy is everyone staring at me today?\u201d Phil finds himself grumbling. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHave you not seen literally all of the stories on social media?\u201d PJ asks, his voice a bit higher in octave.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shakes his head. He honestly hasn\u2019t posted much on social media, nor has he been on it. The last he posted was to say he was posting a new video this week.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMate, your pictures with Dan are literally slapped all over Twitter. Even the tabloids that are hitting the shelves have you as their cover photo.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Phil asks, feeling his stomach twist and knot within him.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe immediately pries open the top of his laptop and opens up Safari. He googles Dan\u2019s name and immediately is bombarded with 50+ search results for stories all about him and Dan\u2019s day out in LA\u2026one of the tabloids even got a photo of them eating alone, in private.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou look pretty cosy with Dan.\u201d PJ says.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Phil asks, feeling his voice rise a bit in tension.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNothing, really but are you and Dan dating?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his skin heat up and his face flush a bit in a mix of anger and also anxiety. \u201cYes.\u201d He says, his voice wavering a bit. \u201cDan\u2019s my boyfriend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIs this just recently or\u2026?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPJ, you know this this. Dan and I just got together when I was in LA.\u201d Phil says, his voice laced with some disbelief. He didn\u2019t even know where this was coming from. \u201cThese pictures, PJ, were taken without Dan and I\u2019s permission. They were taken by some low-life paparazzi\u2019s who want to sell their photos of famous people to tabloids to make money.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPj threw his hands up and sat back in his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get angry.\u201d PJ began. \u201cI just simply wanted to know\u2015friend to friend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his blood cool down a bit as he relaxed back into his own seat and let out a long sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, PJ. That wasn\u2019t fair to snap at you\u2026it\u2019s just, now that I\u2019m beginning to see what Dan goes through each day, it\u2019s hard to not get defensive when something like this happens.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d PJ says. \u201cI also didn\u2019t mean to suddenly get defensive either. I know it\u2019s not my place to know about you and Dan. I honestly just think I\u2019m still a bit shocked at the entire thing if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out an incredulous laugh. \u201cIt is all a bit mental when you think about it. Like who have thought last year at this time that looking forward, I\u2019d be dating the world famous Daniel Howell.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s right crazy.\u201d PJ says. \u201cBut, as long as you\u2019re happy, I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m happy, Peej.\u201d Phil adds. \u201cDan has to come to London in a few weeks for a premiere that he needs to attend. Maybe we can arrange a time for you to come over to my flat and properly meet him? I think you\u2019ll really get along well with him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ smiles at him and nods. \u201cI\u2019m sure Sophie will be excited for that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil forgot how much Sophie fangirled over Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tJust as he opens his mouth to speak something more about it, the door to Louise\u2019s office opens and Phil looks up just in time to see her poke her blonde hair outside of the frame. \u201cLigouri and Lester, come to my office so we can discuss your next projects!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gives a glance to PJ who gives one back and Phil stands up, picking up his laptop and the key chain before he follows PJ to Louise office and they shut the door behind them.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cNew York is cool and all but it\u2019s cold and a bit damp and I really want to be back in the sun.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil chuckles as he reads Dan\u2019s text out loud to himself.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>You\u2019ll never make it in London\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil types back his message and then locks his phone and sets it beside him on the couch. Spike was at his feet, gnawing on a play bone that Phil had gotten him in consolation of leaving him for so long. Phil was supposed to be working on his new project that Louise had given him and PJ. But he honestly felt like he couldn\u2019t be bothered and he didn\u2019t know whether or not that a good thing at the moment.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was busy working on editing his video when his mum called and asked about LA so he told her all about it. And then his brother called right after and he got sidetracked when Dan texted just now.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe had promised his subscribers that he would get out a new video this week with someone special and they already figured out it was Dan and now they\u2019re even more excited for the video. So the pressure on him right now was pretty great.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut he honestly forgets all of that when Dan texts him and it\u2019s like he placed back into an alternate reality.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>guess well just have to live in LA then :(</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>you\u2019re also forgetting that i used to live in wokingham lol\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>i just like the sun of LA</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s heart picked up speed. Did Dan just reference them living together? He felt a bit foolish, getting his hopes up so high when they\u2019ve barely been together. He already can feel that Dan is his person but that still doesn\u2019t help the anxieties that plague his mind.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>Don\u2019t want to move to London and live with the queen?\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>Move to LA and you\u2019ll be with trump?\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>fuck nevermind lol ill move to London\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lets out a snort and rolls onto his side on the couch, Spike\u2019s head picking up a bit as he looked at Phil to see what he was doing. He did feel a bit restless. The jet lag was still sitting heavy behind his eyes. Maybe he\u2019d take Spike to the park.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked down at his pup, who was now rolled onto his back. He bent forward and rubbed Spike\u2019s belly, causing Spike to jerk and look at him. \u201cWant to go to park?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike immediately rolled over and stood up, prancing. Phil chuckled and got up, pushing his phone in his pocket long enough to walk to the closet and grab Spike\u2019s lead.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe bent down and hooked it on him before grabbing the necessary items like a doggy bag and stuffing them into his pocket. He walked out the door with Spike practically dragging him and headed down the street to the park.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe continued to text Dan the entire way, only stopping when Spike nearly pulled him into a light pole. When they got to the park, Phil found an empty bench near an open area of grass, currently unoccupied and let Spike off from his lead to run around a bit. Spike never went far, and if he did, a simple call of his name always brought him back to Phil.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched his carefully and eyed the people around him. He didn\u2019t know why, but he had an uneasy feeling creeping under his skin. He couldn\u2019t quite place in his mind where it was coming from, but the instinct to look behind him overcame his thoughts and he turned his head, only to see no one even around him besides a young couple and their child, walking down the dirt path.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe let himself relax as he enjoyed the slight breeze in the air as Spike eventually ran his energy out and he was back at Phil\u2019s feet, huffing and puffing and whining for a treat. Phil reached in his pocket and pulled one out, sneaking it to Spike. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy, but I need to stop giving you so many treats.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe ruffled Spike\u2019s fur a bit before re-hooking his lead and getting up from the bench. They walked towards the exit of the park and Phil was just deciding he might take Spike to the new pet-friendly cafe just a few blocks away when he heard it.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe click.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe thought he was imagining it at first, his anxiety getting the better of him. But then there was another\u2026and another\u2026and suddenly, he turned around and there was something with a camera, crouched down at the ground, taking photos of him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil panicked. What does he do? Does he say something? This has to be just a paparazzi?\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil Lester!\u201d The man called out, lowering his camera. \u201cDo you mind telling me where Daniel Howell is?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2015.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you and Daniel Howell dating?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil bent down, picked up Spike in his arms, and ran. He doesn\u2019t know how far he ran or where he even went, he just did. And he eventually landed way farther than he had intended with his flat on the complete other side of the park.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe let down Spike, but not before taking a few deep breaths into his fur to calm him down. He still doesn\u2019t know what that was. He doesn\u2019t even know what to do. He feels his chest tighten and he wills himself to stay clam.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was just paparazzi. It was just paparazzi.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe finds himself reaching into his pocket and calling his mum as he takes Spike\u2019s lead in his hand and starts walking him in the correct direction.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cChild!\u201d His mum said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMum, a paparazzi just took photos of me and Spike at the park and he started asking me questions and I didn\u2019t know what I could do so I ran and I don\u2019t even quite know where I am all that I know is\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, honey, calm down. Please take a breath!\u201d His mum soothed. \u201cWhat was the paparazzi asking?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThey were asking about me and Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd did you say anything?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo. I panicked and I just said no to their first question and ran off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI told you we should look into getting someone, Phil. Someone who can help you out.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMum,\u201d Phil finds himself saying. \u201cI don\u2019t think getting someone like that is going to help. I\u2019m not even sure what that was that just happened.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt was a paparazzi trying to get into yours and Dan\u2019s business, sweetheart.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his heart de-flat because he knew that. He wasn\u2019t stupid. But that doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t bother him or it shouldn\u2019t bother him.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut what do I do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHis mum sighed on the other end. \u201cSweetie, I\u2019m not sure I have the answer for that question.\u201d She said gently. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk with Dan about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Dan is who I should be talking to about this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, it\u2019s his lifestyle that you\u2019re getting mixed up in, Philip.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil bit his lip. He didn\u2019t want to get into this right now. He called for advice and a little bit of coddling and he wasn\u2019t ready to get a full conversation handed to him about \u201cDan\u2019s life\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into this right now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t want you hurt, Phil. I really don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know, mum.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe finds himself already at the door of his flat and he sighs in relief as he fishes his keys out of his pocket and pushes himself inside.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe let\u2019s Spike in the flat first and let\u2019s the little pup fly through the flat towards his food and water dishes in the kitchen. He says a quick goodbye to his mum with a promise to call her later and then feels himself fall onto the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\tMaybe watching some TV for a little bit will help him out?\u00a0</p><p>\tHe reaches for the remote to this TV, which he doesn\u2019t use that often, and turns it on, flipping through the channels. He\u2019s about ready to press the Netflix button on his remote when a finds himself on some entertainment news station that he\u2019s never paid any attention to before.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut his mouth drops open and he feels like he\u2019s going to vomit as he watches him and Dan walking together in The Grove on his very screen in front of him. It was when they were walking from the restaurant to the little place where they ate their food. And as if Phil couldn\u2019t feel sick enough, the headline on the bottom read:\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDaniel Howell SPOTTED with His New Beau in Los Angeles!\u201d\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Summary</b>: Phil Lester was a worker for the BBC in London. Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood &lsquo;It&rsquo; star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br /></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 3.4k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit </p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday around 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/44162515\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.w.tt%2FwRz3waENjV&amp;t=NGFjYWY1NzMyNWI3MDZiOGYwM2JiYzVhNzJkZWY4MTliMGUzYWQ5ZCx0a2VnbklQRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aj-hMZ5Lp9HeXbc-IdwveRg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fyiffandquiff.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183680620282%2Fi-want-it-i-got-it-chapter-16&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">WATTPAD</a>**</b></p><p><b>A/N: I&rsquo;m heading off to see Endgame so you get the chapter 3 hours early! :)&nbsp;</b></p><p>Phil didn&rsquo;t know what sadness truly was until he was walking through London Heathrow airport with his tail between his legs and his bag on his shoulders, dried tears on his cheeks.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt had been the saddest goodbye he&rsquo;d ever had to give someone and frankly, he used to say that was definitely when he had left his parent&rsquo;s home to go to Uni in Manchester.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut he&rsquo;s hurting and he feels like he left a bit of his heart in Los Angeles with Dan. And as he steps foot into his flat, jet lag kicking his ass, he cries harder than he allowed himself to in LAX after leaving Dan behind.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe feels a bit ashamed about it. He feels like he shouldn&rsquo;t be crying over leaving Dan in Los Angeles because Dan found out the night before he&rsquo;ll be in London in a few weeks time for a movie premiere. But as Phil thinks about the way Dan cried at the airport as he said one last goodbye in the car outside, he cries that much harder.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s supposed to go pick up Spike from PJ but he feels lousy and like he needs a day to recuperate. But he also knows that PJ is going to want to hear about Dan and LA and he&rsquo;s not quite sure if he wants to speak about that yet.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhen the last of his tears stop and he texts Dan to tell him he made it back okay, he takes a cool shower to wash off the stench of airplane and then gets dressed and heads out to the nearest tube station to go to PJ&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ answers the door when he gets there and Spike is immediately attacking Phil&rsquo;s legs, trying to get his attention. Phil didn&rsquo;t realize how much he missed his energetic pup until he was picking him up and cuddling him against his chest as he squirmed.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;How was he?&rdquo; Phil asked, running his hand through Spike&rsquo;s fur.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;He was great!&rdquo; PJ said, opening the door wider so Phil could walk inside of his flat. &ldquo;Only destroyed one slipper but I got it from Poundland so no harm done.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil let out a snort and let his pup back down on the floor so he could continue to sniff and run around Phil&rsquo;s legs.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Do you want any food or a drink?&rdquo; PJ asks, moving quickly towards the kitchen. &ldquo;No offense mate but you look a bit sickly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shook his head and followed PJ to the counter where he sat on one of the stools. PJ passed him a glass of water and Phil picked it up, taking a long sip of it, not realizing how dehydrated he felt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty jet lagged if I&rsquo;m being honest.&rdquo; Phil answers finally. &ldquo;These time zones are kicking my ass.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;How was Dan?&rdquo; PJ asks, seemingly out of the blue. Phil doesn&rsquo;t know why it catches him off guard but it does.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I mean, he had a few things he had to go to that I went with him to but other than that, we mostly just stayed in.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Any saucy details?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looks up from his glass of water and sees the way PJ is smirking at him. Phil feels his face flush as he thinks about the night before&#8213;was it the night before? Time zones are confusing&hellip;where he and Dan shared such intimate moments together. His stomach tingled at the thought of having sex with Dan and how glorious it had felt. And they had sex twice. The first time and then another time later that night before they went to sleep. Phil was honestly never forget the sight of Dan coming undone above him as he rode him so well.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not getting into them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No?&rdquo; PJ picks. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t go dancing in the sheets?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil blushed and hid his face as he laughed nervously. &ldquo;Peej!&rdquo; He cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about my sex life.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; PJ exclaimed, poking a finger into Phil&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;So there IS a sex life to be spoken about! How was it? Did you both&hellip;rock each others worlds?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil groaned and put his hands back down as he cocked his eyebrow at PJ and shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re blushing!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Maybe so.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ gave him an all knowing smile and then rested against the counter on his elbows. &ldquo;I talked with Louise a bit and she was saying how she has some new projects for us to work on when you return back to work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ swatted his hand in the air. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;probably some bloody useless thing that Louise is too lazy to do herself.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil groaned again. He wasn&rsquo;t fully in the mood to go back to work and he wasn&rsquo;t fully in the mood to deal with anything Louise was going to throw his way. Especially when he&rsquo;s been struggling a bit with thinking about the BBC in context with his future ever since he had that conversation with Dan. In fact, it&rsquo;s been gnawing at him a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I really am not ready to go back.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;When is your first day?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo; Phil answers. &ldquo;Louise only gave me a week, including traveling. I didn&rsquo;t get a lot of time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;That sucks mate.&rdquo; PJ says. &ldquo;Suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t keep you then so you can go back to your flat and relax for the evening.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nodded, standing up and pulling down his sweatshirt that had come as he sat. He bent down and picked up Spike in his arms before walking with PJ to grab Spike&rsquo;s things and put the backpack onto his back.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil took the tube back to his flat and as soon as he walked inside and let Spike go, he clambered over to his couch and laid down, shutting his eyes and falling nearly immediately to sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\tJet lag fucked Phil over.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt fucked Phil over because it was currently 3am and he was sitting wide awake with a mug of coffee in his hand as he scrolled through his social media on his laptop. He&rsquo;d taken about a six hour snooze that afternoon and was paying the price now as he struggled to fall back asleep. He pretty much gave up a half an hour ago and resided to just staying up.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;d tried texting Dan but he knew he wasn&rsquo;t going to answer because Dan was currently flying out to New York for the next few days to film one final scene for his movie before it goes into post-production.&nbsp;</p><p>\tSo Dan was honestly probably on a plane somewhere else and he wouldn&rsquo;t get to talk to him until tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>\tFuck, he missed Dan so damn much.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHis eyes well up a bit again and he wills for himself to not cry. He&rsquo;s done enough of that. He&rsquo;ll be seeing Dan soon. He has to keep reminding himself of that. Dan will be back in London in just a few weeks and they&rsquo;ll be here, in Phil&rsquo;s flat. It&rsquo;ll be okay.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe sets down his mug of coffee on his night stand and lays back down in his bed, shutting his laptop screen. He closes his eyes and tries to get himself to maybe get a few more hours.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThey don&rsquo;t ever come before his alarm goes off at seven but he still wished he could have.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe dresses and leaves his flat, giving Spike plenty of hugs and kisses and belly rubs on the way out to make up for not being around much. He manages to get himself onto the tube and then get to the BBC without anything major happening.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe gets let into the building and then on the way up to his office, he finds himself the be the product of stares and even a few glares. He shakes them off and tries to ignore them as he makes his way to his office.&nbsp;\t</p><p>\tPhil takes a seat and digs out his laptop and his little keychain that he bought for Darcy and sets them on his desk. When he looks back up, PJ is looking at him with an intense stare that doesn&rsquo;t quite compute with the same warm greeting he had gotten yesterday at PJ&rsquo;s flat.&nbsp;</p><p>\tTo say he&rsquo;s confused is an understatement.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Why is everyone staring at me today?&rdquo; Phil finds himself grumbling. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Have you not seen literally all of the stories on social media?&rdquo; PJ asks, his voice a bit higher in octave.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shakes his head. He honestly hasn&rsquo;t posted much on social media, nor has he been on it. The last he posted was to say he was posting a new video this week.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Mate, your pictures with Dan are literally slapped all over Twitter. Even the tabloids that are hitting the shelves have you as their cover photo.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; Phil asks, feeling his stomach twist and knot within him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe immediately pries open the top of his laptop and opens up Safari. He googles Dan&rsquo;s name and immediately is bombarded with 50+ search results for stories all about him and Dan&rsquo;s day out in LA&hellip;one of the tabloids even got a photo of them eating alone, in private.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You look pretty cosy with Dan.&rdquo; PJ says.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; Phil asks, feeling his voice rise a bit in tension.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Nothing, really but are you and Dan dating?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil felt his skin heat up and his face flush a bit in a mix of anger and also anxiety. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He says, his voice wavering a bit. &ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s my boyfriend.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Is this just recently or&hellip;?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;PJ, you know this this. Dan and I just got together when I was in LA.&rdquo; Phil says, his voice laced with some disbelief. He didn&rsquo;t even know where this was coming from. &ldquo;These pictures, PJ, were taken without Dan and I&rsquo;s permission. They were taken by some low-life paparazzi&rsquo;s who want to sell their photos of famous people to tabloids to make money.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPj threw his hands up and sat back in his chair. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to get angry.&rdquo; PJ began. &ldquo;I just simply wanted to know&#8213;friend to friend.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil felt his blood cool down a bit as he relaxed back into his own seat and let out a long sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, PJ. That wasn&rsquo;t fair to snap at you&hellip;it&rsquo;s just, now that I&rsquo;m beginning to see what Dan goes through each day, it&rsquo;s hard to not get defensive when something like this happens.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; PJ says. &ldquo;I also didn&rsquo;t mean to suddenly get defensive either. I know it&rsquo;s not my place to know about you and Dan. I honestly just think I&rsquo;m still a bit shocked at the entire thing if I&rsquo;m being honest.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil let out an incredulous laugh. &ldquo;It is all a bit mental when you think about it. Like who have thought last year at this time that looking forward, I&rsquo;d be dating the world famous Daniel Howell.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right crazy.&rdquo; PJ says. &ldquo;But, as long as you&rsquo;re happy, I&rsquo;ll be happy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy, Peej.&rdquo; Phil adds. &ldquo;Dan has to come to London in a few weeks for a premiere that he needs to attend. Maybe we can arrange a time for you to come over to my flat and properly meet him? I think you&rsquo;ll really get along well with him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ smiles at him and nods. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Sophie will be excited for that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil forgot how much Sophie fangirled over Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\tJust as he opens his mouth to speak something more about it, the door to Louise&rsquo;s office opens and Phil looks up just in time to see her poke her blonde hair outside of the frame. &ldquo;Ligouri and Lester, come to my office so we can discuss your next projects!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil gives a glance to PJ who gives one back and Phil stands up, picking up his laptop and the key chain before he follows PJ to Louise office and they shut the door behind them.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\t&ldquo;New York is cool and all but it&rsquo;s cold and a bit damp and I really want to be back in the sun.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil chuckles as he reads Dan&rsquo;s text out loud to himself.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>You&rsquo;ll never make it in London&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil types back his message and then locks his phone and sets it beside him on the couch. Spike was at his feet, gnawing on a play bone that Phil had gotten him in consolation of leaving him for so long. Phil was supposed to be working on his new project that Louise had given him and PJ. But he honestly felt like he couldn&rsquo;t be bothered and he didn&rsquo;t know whether or not that a good thing at the moment.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe was busy working on editing his video when his mum called and asked about LA so he told her all about it. And then his brother called right after and he got sidetracked when Dan texted just now.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe had promised his subscribers that he would get out a new video this week with someone special and they already figured out it was Dan and now they&rsquo;re even more excited for the video. So the pressure on him right now was pretty great.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut he honestly forgets all of that when Dan texts him and it&rsquo;s like he placed back into an alternate reality.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>guess well just have to live in LA then :(</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>you&rsquo;re also forgetting that i used to live in wokingham lol&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>i just like the sun of LA</p><p>\tPhil&rsquo;s heart picked up speed. Did Dan just reference them living together? He felt a bit foolish, getting his hopes up so high when they&rsquo;ve barely been together. He already can feel that Dan is his person but that still doesn&rsquo;t help the anxieties that plague his mind.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>Don&rsquo;t want to move to London and live with the queen?&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>Move to LA and you&rsquo;ll be with trump?&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>fuck nevermind lol ill move to London&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil lets out a snort and rolls onto his side on the couch, Spike&rsquo;s head picking up a bit as he looked at Phil to see what he was doing. He did feel a bit restless. The jet lag was still sitting heavy behind his eyes. Maybe he&rsquo;d take Spike to the park.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looked down at his pup, who was now rolled onto his back. He bent forward and rubbed Spike&rsquo;s belly, causing Spike to jerk and look at him. &ldquo;Want to go to park?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tSpike immediately rolled over and stood up, prancing. Phil chuckled and got up, pushing his phone in his pocket long enough to walk to the closet and grab Spike&rsquo;s lead.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe bent down and hooked it on him before grabbing the necessary items like a doggy bag and stuffing them into his pocket. He walked out the door with Spike practically dragging him and headed down the street to the park.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe continued to text Dan the entire way, only stopping when Spike nearly pulled him into a light pole. When they got to the park, Phil found an empty bench near an open area of grass, currently unoccupied and let Spike off from his lead to run around a bit. Spike never went far, and if he did, a simple call of his name always brought him back to Phil.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil watched his carefully and eyed the people around him. He didn&rsquo;t know why, but he had an uneasy feeling creeping under his skin. He couldn&rsquo;t quite place in his mind where it was coming from, but the instinct to look behind him overcame his thoughts and he turned his head, only to see no one even around him besides a young couple and their child, walking down the dirt path.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe let himself relax as he enjoyed the slight breeze in the air as Spike eventually ran his energy out and he was back at Phil&rsquo;s feet, huffing and puffing and whining for a treat. Phil reached in his pocket and pulled one out, sneaking it to Spike. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good boy, but I need to stop giving you so many treats.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe ruffled Spike&rsquo;s fur a bit before re-hooking his lead and getting up from the bench. They walked towards the exit of the park and Phil was just deciding he might take Spike to the new pet-friendly cafe just a few blocks away when he heard it.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe click.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe thought he was imagining it at first, his anxiety getting the better of him. But then there was another&hellip;and another&hellip;and suddenly, he turned around and there was something with a camera, crouched down at the ground, taking photos of him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil panicked. What does he do? Does he say something? This has to be just a paparazzi?&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil Lester!&rdquo; The man called out, lowering his camera. &ldquo;Do you mind telling me where Daniel Howell is?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil quickly shook his head. &ldquo;No. I&#8213;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you and Daniel Howell dating?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil bent down, picked up Spike in his arms, and ran. He doesn&rsquo;t know how far he ran or where he even went, he just did. And he eventually landed way farther than he had intended with his flat on the complete other side of the park.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe let down Spike, but not before taking a few deep breaths into his fur to calm him down. He still doesn&rsquo;t know what that was. He doesn&rsquo;t even know what to do. He feels his chest tighten and he wills himself to stay clam.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt was just paparazzi. It was just paparazzi.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe finds himself reaching into his pocket and calling his mum as he takes Spike&rsquo;s lead in his hand and starts walking him in the correct direction.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Child!&rdquo; His mum said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Mum, a paparazzi just took photos of me and Spike at the park and he started asking me questions and I didn&rsquo;t know what I could do so I ran and I don&rsquo;t even quite know where I am all that I know is&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil, honey, calm down. Please take a breath!&rdquo; His mum soothed. &ldquo;What was the paparazzi asking?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;They were asking about me and Dan.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And did you say anything?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. &ldquo;No. I panicked and I just said no to their first question and ran off.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I told you we should look into getting someone, Phil. Someone who can help you out.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Mum,&rdquo; Phil finds himself saying. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think getting someone like that is going to help. I&rsquo;m not even sure what that was that just happened.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It was a paparazzi trying to get into yours and Dan&rsquo;s business, sweetheart.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil felt his heart de-flat because he knew that. He wasn&rsquo;t stupid. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it didn&rsquo;t bother him or it shouldn&rsquo;t bother him.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;But what do I do?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHis mum sighed on the other end. &ldquo;Sweetie, I&rsquo;m not sure I have the answer for that question.&rdquo; She said gently. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you talk with Dan about it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil sighed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if Dan is who I should be talking to about this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s his lifestyle that you&rsquo;re getting mixed up in, Philip.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil bit his lip. He didn&rsquo;t want to get into this right now. He called for advice and a little bit of coddling and he wasn&rsquo;t ready to get a full conversation handed to him about &ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s life&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get into this right now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know, but I don&rsquo;t want you hurt, Phil. I really don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know, mum.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe finds himself already at the door of his flat and he sighs in relief as he fishes his keys out of his pocket and pushes himself inside.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe let&rsquo;s Spike in the flat first and let&rsquo;s the little pup fly through the flat towards his food and water dishes in the kitchen. He says a quick goodbye to his mum with a promise to call her later and then feels himself fall onto the couch.&nbsp;</p><p>\tMaybe watching some TV for a little bit will help him out?&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe reaches for the remote to this TV, which he doesn&rsquo;t use that often, and turns it on, flipping through the channels. He&rsquo;s about ready to press the Netflix button on his remote when a finds himself on some entertainment news station that he&rsquo;s never paid any attention to before.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut his mouth drops open and he feels like he&rsquo;s going to vomit as he watches him and Dan walking together in The Grove on his very screen in front of him. It was when they were walking from the restaurant to the little place where they ate their food. And as if Phil couldn&rsquo;t feel sick enough, the headline on the bottom read:&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Daniel Howell SPOTTED with His New Beau in Los Angeles!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>",
