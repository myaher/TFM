                "content": "<p><b>Request - \nCan I please request a Tony x reader and the reader is all shy and calm \ncompared to Tony and he teases her about it because he loves when she&rsquo;s \nlittle pouty baby (bonus points if the reader calls Tony daddy (also, it\n doesn&rsquo;t have to be a smut)) \n\n</b><br /></p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Hey, Tony.&rdquo; She pushed open the door to the lab to find Tony\nsitting in front of a desk, hunched over. His hair was a little\nmussed like his fingers had run through it more than once. She didn&rsquo;t\nfail to notice that he had stripped down to a white vest either. One\nthat showed off his arms. \n</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want me for?&rdquo; \n</p><p>He leapt up, excitable for some reason. She really didn&rsquo;t want\nto know the details. \n</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here. Great! Come over here for me.&rdquo; \n</p><p>He caught her by the arms, guiding her over to a machine by his\ndesk. He put her in position in the centre of a glass cylinder. She\nlooked up, confused, suspecting it was some kind of scanner. Then\nagain she didn&rsquo;t pretend to understand half of his inventions.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&hellip;&rdquo; \n</p><p>&ldquo;Just stand there,&rdquo; he ordered and she immediately froze.\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo; \n</p><p>He darted back to the desk, tapped at some buttons and the scanner\nmoved smoothly down, a light gliding over her body and then back up. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Umm, Tony?&rdquo; She wasn&rsquo;t sure what had just happened. \n</p><p>He turned to her, eyes shining and a grin on his face. The kind\nshe found irresistibly charming even though she knew she should know\nbetter. Had already made that mistake more than once. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; He held out a hand for her, helping her out\nof the scanner even though it really required no help. He didn&rsquo;t\nlet go even when she was out. &ldquo;I just needed a female body.&rdquo; \n</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t think of anything else to say. She never\ncould when he spoke to her. It was baffling how they had ever even\ngotten this far. Probably because working in Stark Tower for the\nAvengers forced her to be around him and for whatever reason he\nseemed to find her awkwardness cute. At least, he seemed to enjoy\nmaking her feel as awkward as possible so he could tease her about\nit.</p><p>His eyes turned downward, taking a long, indulgent look over her\nbody. His hands fell to her hips, barely gripping with his fingertips\nand yet still making her stomach flip. \n</p><p>&ldquo;And you do have a very nice body.&rdquo; \n</p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; she reprimanded without much feeling. Her cheeks\nflushed pink. \n</p><p>He stepped right up close to her, his voice rough like fingers\ntrailing down her back and making her shiver. &ldquo;Although you look\neven better when I can see everything.&rdquo; \n</p><p>Something about how he dragged out that last word sent a shot of\npleasure straight to her centre. Flustered, she raised her hands\nimpulsively to touch his chest, arms, who knew. Somehow controlling\nherself she put her hands lightly against his chest, fingers curled. \n</p><p>He pulled her somehow closer, bodies flush, his forehead almost\nresting against hers as she refused to look at him. &ldquo;How about you\nbe a nice girl and let me see again?&rdquo; \n</p><p>She faintly tried to pull away even knowing he wasn&rsquo;t going to\nlet her go. They had been through this before and she always gave in\nthough it never went any further after. She wasn&rsquo;t sure she wanted\nit to. Maybe because the nights they spent together were so amazing.\nThey were literally the best sex she had ever had but after she\nalways made sure to disappear. And Tony never made a fuss over it. \n</p><p>Maybe because he knew he could always get her back. It was like he\nknew she opened up and did things with him she had never done before.</p><p>&ldquo;T-Tony, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he teased, nuzzling against her neck and making her\nbreath hitch. His lips glided across her skin, barely touching. &ldquo;Oh,\nI think you can.&rdquo;</p><p>She licked her lips, breathless already. Her eyes went to the\nwindow. Anyone walking past would see them. She couldn't&hellip; didn&rsquo;t\nknow how to explain this if they were caught. God it was hard to\nbreathe.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to take you right here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; she squeaked, making him laugh just a little. He\npulled back to look at her, cupping her face with one hand. It was\nembarrassing how easily it made her soft and pliant. \n</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he teased. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me to ravish you\nright here on my desk?&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes darted to the door again. &ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; she whined. &ldquo;Stop\nit.&rdquo;</p><p>Fingers clutching in his shirt she tried to steady herself as he\nwatched her, eyes eating up every little detail. She felt like she\nwas under a microscope when his full attention was on her and it was\noverwhelming.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY,&rdquo; he said without looking away, &ldquo;lock the door and\nshut the blinds.&rdquo;</p><p>She knew there was no resisting it then and as the blinds slid\ndown, hiding them from view, he turned to press her up against the\ndesk. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so mean,&rdquo; she pouted.</p><p>Another throaty chuckle. &ldquo;How am I mean, little one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always teasing me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re so cute when you&rsquo;re shy.&rdquo;</p><p>He leant in before she could give any more weak complaints,\nkissing her pouting lips.

Normal people would be too short on breath to even talk, Steve is singing. The chorus of Beyonce\u2019s hit Single Ladies fills Tony\u2019s ears as it leaves the speakers on his phone.
