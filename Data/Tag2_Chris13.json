\u00a0We can talk some more\nif you\u2019d like? \u00a0Maybe go have some\nlunch?\u201d</p><p>After giving Chris your phone number, you walked him to the\ndoor and gave him a tight lipped smile. \nLocking up your apartment you crashed onto your bed and fell asleep\nalmost instantly. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>There was a constant knocking on your door, startling you\naway. \u00a0Your head was pounding as you\nangrily tore the covers off your body and made your way to the door. \u00a0\u201cI will kill whoever is on the other side of\nthis door,\u201d you angrily shouted as you looked into the peep hole. \u00a0\u201cOf course,\u201d you shook your head as you saw\nwho it was. \u00a0</p><p>Opening the door, you saw Sebastian standing there with a\ncoffee carrier and a bag from your favorite donut shop; but his scowl was more\nevident. \u00a0You let him enter your apartment\nand braced for the impact. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlmost your whole life you knew Chris and you never\nbothered to tell me?\u201d Sebastian snapped as he set down the coffee and donuts on\nthe table in the living room. \u00a0You\ngreedily grabbed the coffee, taking a long sip, humming in satisfaction at the\ntaste. \u00a0\u201cI thought we were best friends\nJessica. \u00a0How could you not tell me\nthat?\u201d</p><p>Setting the cup down you turned to Sebastian. \u00a0Your heart hurt looking at him; it was a\ndifferent kind of hurt from the way it felt to look at Chris. \u00a0This time it was your own guilt. \u00a0</p><p>You ended up telling Sebastian the whole story. \u00a0How you became his neighbor when you were\nonly five, to spending nearly every day with him up until graduation, and how\nyou had hopelessly fell in love with him. \nThen you talked about how he moved away and slowly stopped responding to\nyour texts and calls; you even threw in Chris\u2019 story that he told you last\nnight. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Sebastian said, taking a bite of his donut. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d came your quick response. \u00a0</p><p>The two of you were quiet as you ate your breakfast and\ndrank your coffee, letting everything sink in from the last 12 hours. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do Seb,\u201d you finally spoke\nup. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, do I forgive him? \nDo I just pretend nothing happened and go back to being normal? \u00a0Or do I hold a grudge and let him know how it\nfeels? \u00a0Ugh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian chuckled, earning a glare from you. \u00a0\u201cYou are still in love with him,\u201d he spoke\nwith a smile. \u00a0\u201cYou sit here and tell me\nthat you had moved on from him and you don\u2019t have those feelings anymore, but\nit\u2019s obvious you still love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always love him Sebastian. \u00a0I\u2019m just not in love with him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit and you know it Jess. \u00a0I\u2019ve known you for the last ten years. \u00a0When was the last time you even dated\nsomeone? \u00a0Hell when was the last time you\ngot laid?\u201d</p><p>You blushed at his remark, knowing the truth. \u00a0You had tried to date a few people here and\nthere, but you always ended up comparing them to Chris. \u00a0As for getting laid? \u00a0Yeah that had been quite a few years\nago. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook, just go back home to Sudbury next week, get the house\nin order to sell, and while you are there, just talk to him,\u201d Sebastian\noffered. \u00a0</p><p>Leaning your head on his shoulder, you let out a deep\nsigh. \u00a0At first you were excited to go\nback to where you grew up, get the house sold, and be done with it all. \u00a0But knowing Chris was going to be next door\nagain, you were unsure of how to feel. \u00a0</p><p>Tag List: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZLgH1Zo9er5MzyXXohQBA\">@chrisevansfanfic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-PbYdDc36pCNDKtqt2H32A\">@jinoraskies</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRk-wkBYlRixBAo8hWCkjg\">@brastrangled</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv8r6fJX_2qORMc07jo2VQ\">@miss-cap21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUq3sPk9lcgG_jXUp6RsRIQ\">@remember-that-one-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLEN1bSPv7F2jO2qK-XqfvQ\">@white-chocolate-mocha-fan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moH2485CD_OzLSWhAudQMjA\">@the-real-kellymonster</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-B6U87jynWLd9naB5G_dEw\">@pumbibaby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVvyPBlJuKY24WaTnPPnhQ\">@zohoffman</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gP0gKLqbIcrjDz0T37bBg\">@sincerelyfan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfGDFCWQwdHP6h2bfQLKLqA\">@hispeculiartreasure</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvcg66HgRTM7-gI4qWvFvQ\">@libbitinasdeath</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0E2wFcz7-jjpygcaO4nuSw\">@projectxhappiness</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRHJPQOLxmyZlKUa6rlO2A\">@sfreeborn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpmGAEwKsOKtyIgI-c5Ttqg\">@jjlevin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXFYeI57g9SMd7qt-SB_oAg\">@poerebel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoHONrlb9zzqCPyqVY9YZA\">@crushed-pink-petals</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifWDZ6NIu_ob1sV8Fw0dWQ\">@laochbaineann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmToUcLU1n388gzQ38anXog\">@esoltis280</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a> @3dsaunt</p>",

\u00a0We can talk some more\nif you\u2019d like? \u00a0Maybe go have some\nlunch?\u201d</p><p>After giving Chris your phone number, you walked him to the\ndoor and gave him a tight lipped smile. \nLocking up your apartment you crashed onto your bed and fell asleep\nalmost instantly. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>There was a constant knocking on your door, startling you\naway. \u00a0Your head was pounding as you\nangrily tore the covers off your body and made your way to the door. \u00a0\u201cI will kill whoever is on the other side of\nthis door,\u201d you angrily shouted as you looked into the peep hole. \u00a0\u201cOf course,\u201d you shook your head as you saw\nwho it was. \u00a0</p><p>Opening the door, you saw Sebastian standing there with a\ncoffee carrier and a bag from your favorite donut shop; but his scowl was more\nevident. \u00a0You let him enter your apartment\nand braced for the impact. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlmost your whole life you knew Chris and you never\nbothered to tell me?\u201d Sebastian snapped as he set down the coffee and donuts on\nthe table in the living room. \u00a0You\ngreedily grabbed the coffee, taking a long sip, humming in satisfaction at the\ntaste. \u00a0\u201cI thought we were best friends\nJessica. \u00a0How could you not tell me\nthat?\u201d</p><p>Setting the cup down you turned to Sebastian. \u00a0Your heart hurt looking at him; it was a\ndifferent kind of hurt from the way it felt to look at Chris. \u00a0This time it was your own guilt. \u00a0</p><p>You ended up telling Sebastian the whole story. \u00a0How you became his neighbor when you were\nonly five, to spending nearly every day with him up until graduation, and how\nyou had hopelessly fell in love with him. \nThen you talked about how he moved away and slowly stopped responding to\nyour texts and calls; you even threw in Chris\u2019 story that he told you last\nnight. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Sebastian said, taking a bite of his donut. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d came your quick response. \u00a0</p><p>The two of you were quiet as you ate your breakfast and\ndrank your coffee, letting everything sink in from the last 12 hours. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do Seb,\u201d you finally spoke\nup. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, do I forgive him? \nDo I just pretend nothing happened and go back to being normal? \u00a0Or do I hold a grudge and let him know how it\nfeels? \u00a0Ugh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian chuckled, earning a glare from you. \u00a0\u201cYou are still in love with him,\u201d he spoke\nwith a smile. \u00a0\u201cYou sit here and tell me\nthat you had moved on from him and you don\u2019t have those feelings anymore, but\nit\u2019s obvious you still love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always love him Sebastian. \u00a0I\u2019m just not in love with him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit and you know it Jess. \u00a0I\u2019ve known you for the last ten years. \u00a0When was the last time you even dated\nsomeone? \u00a0Hell when was the last time you\ngot laid?\u201d</p><p>You blushed at his remark, knowing the truth. \u00a0You had tried to date a few people here and\nthere, but you always ended up comparing them to Chris. \u00a0As for getting laid? \u00a0Yeah that had been quite a few years\nago. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook, just go back home to Sudbury next week, get the house\nin order to sell, and while you are there, just talk to him,\u201d Sebastian\noffered. \u00a0</p><p>Leaning your head on his shoulder, you let out a deep\nsigh. \u00a0At first you were excited to go\nback to where you grew up, get the house sold, and be done with it all. \u00a0But knowing Chris was going to be next door\nagain, you were unsure of how to feel. \u00a0</p><p>Tag List: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZLgH1Zo9er5MzyXXohQBA\">@chrisevansfanfic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-PbYdDc36pCNDKtqt2H32A\">@jinoraskies</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRk-wkBYlRixBAo8hWCkjg\">@brastrangled</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv8r6fJX_2qORMc07jo2VQ\">@miss-cap21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUq3sPk9lcgG_jXUp6RsRIQ\">@remember-that-one-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLEN1bSPv7F2jO2qK-XqfvQ\">@white-chocolate-mocha-fan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moH2485CD_OzLSWhAudQMjA\">@the-real-kellymonster</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-B6U87jynWLd9naB5G_dEw\">@pumbibaby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVvyPBlJuKY24WaTnPPnhQ\">@zohoffman</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gP0gKLqbIcrjDz0T37bBg\">@sincerelyfan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfGDFCWQwdHP6h2bfQLKLqA\">@hispeculiartreasure</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvcg66HgRTM7-gI4qWvFvQ\">@libbitinasdeath</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0E2wFcz7-jjpygcaO4nuSw\">@projectxhappiness</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRHJPQOLxmyZlKUa6rlO2A\">@sfreeborn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpmGAEwKsOKtyIgI-c5Ttqg\">@jjlevin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXFYeI57g9SMd7qt-SB_oAg\">@poerebel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoHONrlb9zzqCPyqVY9YZA\">@crushed-pink-petals</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifWDZ6NIu_ob1sV8Fw0dWQ\">@laochbaineann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmToUcLU1n388gzQ38anXog\">@esoltis280</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a> @3dsaunt</p></p>",
