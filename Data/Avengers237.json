        "body": "<p>Here we are at the second-to-last chapter. It hurts me. This was the first fic I started, and it\u2019s almost over.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m living for Steve giving the reader the nickname that just sort of slipped into this chapter.</p><p>Also, I\u2019m really sorry about the cliffhanger. It\u2019s the most regret I\u2019ve ever had for where a chapter has to end.</p><p><b>Word count: </b>1505</p><p><b>Warnings: </b>If you have heart problems, read this on Oct. 3 when I\u2019ve posted the last chapter. There\u2019s also some strongly implied smut, but let\u2019s be honest, I\u2019ve had that before, and there is absolutely nothing explicit here.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>You found your boyfriend in your shared bedroom studying the\nfiles laid out in front him; his hair fell down over his forehead and his brow\nscrunched up as he pieced the information together. Man, he looked hot when\nconcentrating like that. You studied him from the doorway for a few minutes\nbefore finally entering.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe.\u201d</p><p>A smile lit Steve\u2019s face as your arms wrapped around his\nshoulders from behind. \u201cHey, Y/N. What have you been up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust looking for my man.\u201d You nuzzled your face into the\ncrook of his neck and breathed in deeply, nibbling lightly behind his ear and\nsmiling as his breath hitched. You had been rather clingy the past few weeks.\nSteve didn\u2019t need to know it was partly because of Tony\u2019s plan.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I like where this could go,\u201d his voice was low\nand rough, \u201cI have a mission briefing in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm\u2026 twenty minutes is an awfully long time,\u201d you purred,\nplacing a few kisses along his neck and the back of his jawline.</p><p>\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Steve was five minutes late to his briefing. You tagged\nalong, refusing to let go of his hand and waggling your eyebrows at the knowing\nsmirks from the team when the two of you showed up, hair and clothes in\ndisarray. Your boyfriend blushed deeply, a sight you would never tire of,\nbefore starting the briefing.</p><p>You had never been to a mission briefing before, so you paid\nextra close attention. Tony caught your eye and winked, a signal you returned.\nToday was the day.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re all here and ready to go. Everyone on board the\njet,\u201d Steve barked as today\u2019s crew of Tony, Nat, and Sam gathered around him.</p><p>\u201cWell, not quite all of us,\u201d Tony replied.</p><p>The Captain knit his brows together. \u201cWho are we missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s talking about me.\u201d</p><p>Steve turned and froze, mouth gaping open. There you stood\nin the gear you and Tony had designed, the headband now part of a helmet and\nthe gloves part of a full suit. You had EMP directional ports on your feet and\nchest for additional combat points, and you were pretty sure if you focused\nhard enough you could produce EMPs strong enough to get yourself temporarily\nairborne (as long as the ground wasn\u2019t too soft, that is). The whole suit was\nin the Captain America color scheme of red, white, and blue, and even without\nSteve\u2019s reaction you knew you looked good.</p><p>\u201cY/N, what are you \u2013 where did you get \u2013 what \u2013\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but laugh at his flustered reaction. \u201cTony\nand I have been working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about damn time,\u201d Nat cut in. \u201cWelcome to the team,\nY/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait a minute.\u201d Steve had found his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nnever been in the field before. You\u2019re not ready for something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks pretty ready to me,\u201d Sam shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d you assured him, \u201cI\u2019ve been training with Nat and I\ncan hold my own now, I have the same enhanced strength and stamina that you\nhave, and I can neutralize whatever technology they throw at me. I\u2019m as ready\nas I can be, and I\u2019ll have a team to work with. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing this\nalone.\u201d</p><p>He cupped your jaw in his hand. \u201cWe\u2019re going against a HYDRA\nfacility,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThere might be someone there who had something to do\nwith what happened to you. Are you sure you\u2019re up for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He heard the conviction in your voice. \u201cI\u2019ve thought\nabout it a lot, Steve. My life is different now but I still need it to have a\npurpose.\u201d You lightly patted his shoulder. \u201cMaking sure you don\u2019t get your dumb\nass killed in the field seems like a good enough purpose to me.\u201d</p><p>Steve laughed and Tony crossed his arms. </p><p>\u201cIf the two of you are done, we do have someplace to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Steve pointed at Tony. \u201cYou and I are going to have\na talk later. Everyone on board the jet.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>The world slowly faded back into view. Why did your head\nhurt so badly? Where were you? What happened?</p><p>You remembered arriving at the compound. You remembered\njoking with Tony about how you could power your own suit but he needed a\nreactor for his. You remembered Steve yelling something and\u2026 an explosion? Yes,\nyou were pretty sure there had been an explosion.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back, Ms. Y/L/N. So good of you to join us again.\u201d</p><p>The familiar voice sent a chill down your spine as you\nstruggled to focus your eyes. Doctor Leid stood over you, studying your prone\nfigure that was once again strapped to a table. You jerked at the restraints,\nrealizing they had adjusted for your new strength. Your helmet and gloves were\non a table to your left, and you panicked. Without them, you couldn\u2019t defend\nyourself. You were back under this woman\u2019s thumb, and there was nothing you\ncould do about it.</p><p>\u201cIt was really quite inconvenient, the time at which you\nleft us,\u201d the doctor said, lazily moving about the room, prepping syringes.\n\u201cCaused a lot of damage, too. I lost some good assistants and some even better\nlab equipment.\u201d She fixed you with her cold gaze. \u201cLet\u2019s pick up where we left\noff, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Your mouth was too dry to form words, but she didn\u2019t seem to\nmind. She seemed to be taking pleasure in drawing out the torturous\nanticipation.</p><p>\u201cThere were three phases planned. I barely had time to start\nphase 2.\u201d Leid picked up yet another medicine vial of a glowing liquid and\nfilled two more syringes. \u201cYour EMPs were supposed to be much stronger. You\nmight call them,\u201d she paused and smiled, \u201cheart-stopping.</p><p>\u201cOf course, that was just phase two. Phase three is my\npersonal favorite.\u201d She brought a syringe over to you and injected it directly\ninto your brain stem, cocking her head as you gasped and tried to pull away\nfrom the pain, but your head was strapped down as well. \u201cPhase three is where we\ntake all that energy you\u2019ll be able to produce and set it off in the middle of\nAvengers Tower. You may or may not survive it, depending on how resistant to\nelectricity your body becomes, but the rest of the team, well, let\u2019s just say\nyou\u2019ll be \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeart-stopping,\u201d you whispered, cold realization sweeping\nover you. HYDRA never intended to give you superpowers. They intended to make\nyou strong so you could be a human bomb.</p><p>No. No, you wouldn\u2019t do that to Steve, to your friends. You\nthrashed wildly, Doctor Leid laughing at your failing attempts to escape.</p><p><i>Steve is coming</i>,\nyou told yourself, <i>but will he be in\ntime?</i></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cWhere is she? I swear to God, Tony, if this little plan the\ntwo of you cooked up costs me her life I\u2019ll never forgive you. Y/N, baby girl,\nwhere are you? Talk to me honey.\u201d</p><p>Steve was in a full-blown panic as your comms remained\nsilent. You had gone missing after the bomb went off and the team couldn\u2019t find\nyou. HYDRA had you again\u2026 heads were going to roll as soon as he found them.</p><p>The facility was an empty diversion, meant only to draw you\nin. There had been an energy signature coming from inside that they had been\nsure you could shut down, which was why Tony chose that mission to be your\nfirst. But the explosion had happened before any of you could get inside,\nknocking nearly everyone out and providing the cover HYDRA needed to take you\u2026\nsomewhere. Damn it, if Steve knew where you were, he\u2019d be there already.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s hard, Steve, but we have to look at this\nlogically,\u201d Sam spoke from his view overhead. \u201cThe blast didn\u2019t knock us all\nout, so they only had a limited window to grab her under cover of the debris.\nThey have to be close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorthwest corner! F.R.I.D.A.Y. is picking up a slight\ndifference in the wall at panels five and six,\u201d Tony called, diving toward the\nbuilding. </p><p>Natasha beat him there and had the hidden door open in\nseconds.

There you stood\nin the gear you and Tony had designed, the headband now part of a helmet and\nthe gloves part of a full suit. You had EMP directional ports on your feet and\nchest for additional combat points, and you were pretty sure if you focused\nhard enough you could produce EMPs strong enough to get yourself temporarily\nairborne (as long as the ground wasn\u2019t too soft, that is).

You\u2019re not ready for something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks pretty ready to me,\u201d Sam shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d you assured him, \u201cI\u2019ve been training with Nat and I\ncan hold my own now, I have the same enhanced strength and stamina that you\nhave, and I can neutralize whatever technology they throw at me. I\u2019m as ready\nas I can be, and I\u2019ll have a team to work with. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing this\nalone.\u201d</p><p>He cupped your jaw in his hand. \u201cWe\u2019re going against a HYDRA\nfacility,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThere might be someone there who had something to do\nwith what happened to you. Are you sure you\u2019re up for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He heard the conviction in your voice. \u201cI\u2019ve thought\nabout it a lot, Steve. My life is different now but I still need it to have a\npurpose.\u201d You lightly patted his shoulder. \u201cMaking sure you don\u2019t get your dumb\nass killed in the field seems like a good enough purpose to me.\u201d</p><p>Steve laughed and Tony crossed his arms. </p><p>\u201cIf the two of you are done, we do have someplace to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Steve pointed at Tony. \u201cYou and I are going to have\na talk later. Everyone on board the jet.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>The world slowly faded back into view. Why did your head\nhurt so badly? Where were you? What happened?</p><p>You remembered arriving at the compound. You remembered\njoking with Tony about how you could power your own suit but he needed a\nreactor for his. You remembered Steve yelling something and\u2026 an explosion? Yes,\nyou were pretty sure there had been an explosion.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back, Ms. Y/L/N. So good of you to join us again.\u201d</p><p>The familiar voice sent a chill down your spine as you\nstruggled to focus your eyes. Doctor Leid stood over you, studying your prone\nfigure that was once again strapped to a table. You jerked at the restraints,\nrealizing they had adjusted for your new strength. Your helmet and gloves were\non a table to your left, and you panicked. Without them, you couldn\u2019t defend\nyourself. You were back under this woman\u2019s thumb, and there was nothing you\ncould do about it.</p><p>\u201cIt was really quite inconvenient, the time at which you\nleft us,\u201d the doctor said, lazily moving about the room, prepping syringes.\n\u201cCaused a lot of damage, too. I lost some good assistants and some even better\nlab equipment.\u201d She fixed you with her cold gaze. \u201cLet\u2019s pick up where we left\noff, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Your mouth was too dry to form words, but she didn\u2019t seem to\nmind. She seemed to be taking pleasure in drawing out the torturous\nanticipation.</p><p>\u201cThere were three phases planned. I barely had time to start\nphase 2.\u201d Leid picked up yet another medicine vial of a glowing liquid and\nfilled two more syringes. \u201cYour EMPs were supposed to be much stronger. You\nmight call them,\u201d she paused and smiled, \u201cheart-stopping.</p><p>\u201cOf course, that was just phase two. Phase three is my\npersonal favorite.\u201d She brought a syringe over to you and injected it directly\ninto your brain stem, cocking her head as you gasped and tried to pull away\nfrom the pain, but your head was strapped down as well. \u201cPhase three is where we\ntake all that energy you\u2019ll be able to produce and set it off in the middle of\nAvengers Tower. You may or may not survive it, depending on how resistant to\nelectricity your body becomes, but the rest of the team, well, let\u2019s just say\nyou\u2019ll be \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeart-stopping,\u201d you whispered, cold realization sweeping\nover you. HYDRA never intended to give you superpowers. They intended to make\nyou strong so you could be a human bomb.</p><p>No. No, you wouldn\u2019t do that to Steve, to your friends. You\nthrashed wildly, Doctor Leid laughing at your failing attempts to escape.</p><p><i>Steve is coming</i>,\nyou told yourself, <i>but will he be in\ntime?</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cWhere is she? I swear to God, Tony, if this little plan the\ntwo of you cooked up costs me her life I\u2019ll never forgive you. Y/N, baby girl,\nwhere are you? Talk to me honey.\u201d</p><p>Steve was in a full-blown panic as your comms remained\nsilent. You had gone missing after the bomb went off and the team couldn\u2019t find\nyou. HYDRA had you again\u2026 heads were going to roll as soon as he found them.</p><p>The facility was an empty diversion, meant only to draw you\nin. There had been an energy signature coming from inside that they had been\nsure you could shut down, which was why Tony chose that mission to be your\nfirst. But the explosion had happened before any of you could get inside,\nknocking nearly everyone out and providing the cover HYDRA needed to take you\u2026\nsomewhere. Damn it, if Steve knew where you were, he\u2019d be there already.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s hard, Steve, but we have to look at this\nlogically,\u201d Sam spoke from his view overhead. \u201cThe blast didn\u2019t knock us all\nout, so they only had a limited window to grab her under cover of the debris.\nThey have to be close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorthwest corner! F.R.I.D.A.Y. is picking up a slight\ndifference in the wall at panels five and six,\u201d Tony called, diving toward the\nbuilding. </p><p>Natasha beat him there and had the hidden door open in\nseconds. There was a lab below the compound, empty except for you and the\nmaniacal doctor standing over you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too late!\u201d Doctor Leid screeched as your teammates\npoured in. \u201cI\u2019ve finished.

What have you been up to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just looking for my man.&rdquo; You nuzzled your face into the\ncrook of his neck and breathed in deeply, nibbling lightly behind his ear and\nsmiling as his breath hitched. You had been rather clingy the past few weeks.\nSteve didn&rsquo;t need to know it was partly because of Tony&rsquo;s plan.</p><p>&ldquo;As much as I like where this could go,&rdquo; his voice was low\nand rough, &ldquo;I have a mission briefing in twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmmm&hellip; twenty minutes is an awfully long time,&rdquo; you purred,\nplacing a few kisses along his neck and the back of his jawline.</p><p>&ldquo;It is, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve was five minutes late to his briefing. You tagged\nalong, refusing to let go of his hand and waggling your eyebrows at the knowing\nsmirks from the team when the two of you showed up, hair and clothes in\ndisarray. Your boyfriend blushed deeply, a sight you would never tire of,\nbefore starting the briefing.</p><p>You had never been to a mission briefing before, so you paid\nextra close attention. Tony caught your eye and winked, a signal you returned.\nToday was the day.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, we&rsquo;re all here and ready to go. Everyone on board the\njet,&rdquo; Steve barked as today&rsquo;s crew of Tony, Nat, and Sam gathered around him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, not quite all of us,&rdquo; Tony replied.</p><p>The Captain knit his brows together. &ldquo;Who are we missing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s talking about me.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve turned and froze, mouth gaping open. There you stood\nin the gear you and Tony had designed, the headband now part of a helmet and\nthe gloves part of a full suit. You had EMP directional ports on your feet and\nchest for additional combat points, and you were pretty sure if you focused\nhard enough you could produce EMPs strong enough to get yourself temporarily\nairborne (as long as the ground wasn&rsquo;t too soft, that is). The whole suit was\nin the Captain America color scheme of red, white, and blue, and even without\nSteve&rsquo;s reaction you knew you looked good.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, what are you &ndash; where did you get &ndash; what &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at his flustered reaction. &ldquo;Tony\nand I have been working on it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about damn time,&rdquo; Nat cut in. &ldquo;Welcome to the team,\nY/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now wait a minute.&rdquo; Steve had found his voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve\nnever been in the field before. You&rsquo;re not ready for something like this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She looks pretty ready to me,&rdquo; Sam shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; you assured him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been training with Nat and I\ncan hold my own now, I have the same enhanced strength and stamina that you\nhave, and I can neutralize whatever technology they throw at me. I&rsquo;m as ready\nas I can be, and I&rsquo;ll have a team to work with. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m doing this\nalone.&rdquo;</p><p>He cupped your jaw in his hand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going against a HYDRA\nfacility,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;There might be someone there who had something to do\nwith what happened to you. Are you sure you&rsquo;re up for this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He heard the conviction in your voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought\nabout it a lot, Steve. My life is different now but I still need it to have a\npurpose.&rdquo; You lightly patted his shoulder. &ldquo;Making sure you don&rsquo;t get your dumb\nass killed in the field seems like a good enough purpose to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve laughed and Tony crossed his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;If the two of you are done, we do have someplace to be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Steve pointed at Tony. &ldquo;You and I are going to have\na talk later. Everyone on board the jet.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>The world slowly faded back into view. Why did your head\nhurt so badly? Where were you? What happened?</p><p>You remembered arriving at the compound. You remembered\njoking with Tony about how you could power your own suit but he needed a\nreactor for his. You remembered Steve yelling something and&hellip; an explosion? Yes,\nyou were pretty sure there had been an explosion.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome back, Ms. Y/L/N. So good of you to join us again.&rdquo;</p><p>The familiar voice sent a chill down your spine as you\nstruggled to focus your eyes. Doctor Leid stood over you, studying your prone\nfigure that was once again strapped to a table. You jerked at the restraints,\nrealizing they had adjusted for your new strength. Your helmet and gloves were\non a table to your left, and you panicked. Without them, you couldn&rsquo;t defend\nyourself. You were back under this woman&rsquo;s thumb, and there was nothing you\ncould do about it.</p><p>&ldquo;It was really quite inconvenient, the time at which you\nleft us,&rdquo; the doctor said, lazily moving about the room, prepping syringes.\n&ldquo;Caused a lot of damage, too. I lost some good assistants and some even better\nlab equipment.&rdquo; She fixed you with her cold gaze. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pick up where we left\noff, shall we?&rdquo;</p><p>Your mouth was too dry to form words, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to\nmind. She seemed to be taking pleasure in drawing out the torturous\nanticipation.</p><p>&ldquo;There were three phases planned. I barely had time to start\nphase 2.&rdquo; Leid picked up yet another medicine vial of a glowing liquid and\nfilled two more syringes. &ldquo;Your EMPs were supposed to be much stronger. You\nmight call them,&rdquo; she paused and smiled, &ldquo;heart-stopping.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, that was just phase two. Phase three is my\npersonal favorite.&rdquo; She brought a syringe over to you and injected it directly\ninto your brain stem, cocking her head as you gasped and tried to pull away\nfrom the pain, but your head was strapped down as well. &ldquo;Phase three is where we\ntake all that energy you&rsquo;ll be able to produce and set it off in the middle of\nAvengers Tower. You may or may not survive it, depending on how resistant to\nelectricity your body becomes, but the rest of the team, well, let&rsquo;s just say\nyou&rsquo;ll be &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heart-stopping,&rdquo; you whispered, cold realization sweeping\nover you.

Nothing has been forgotten. Revenge is here.</p><p><b>Word count:</b>\u00a01376</p><p><b>Warnings:</b>\u00a0If you have a severe fear of spiders and hearing them described scares you, don\u2019t read past\u00a0\u201cuntil neither of you could breathe.\u201d (There\u2019s a line break after those words.) You\u2019ll also need to skip the first section of the next chapter when it comes out. Also, I\u2019m drifting more and more into the common level of casual swearing the more I write, so if you like how dramatically clean my language is in TCD&hellip;stick with TCD and my one-shots. Sorry. If it\u2019s any consolation, my mother is disappointed in me.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Bucky woke slowly with a dull ache in his left shoulder and\na set of timpani beating wildly in his head. Nat stood over him with an amused\nlook on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Bucky demanded as he lifted himself off the\nfloor. \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill that stupid archer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really rather you didn\u2019t, babe.\u201d Your voice came from\nbehind him.</p><p>He turned to face you and his breath caught in his throat.\nThere you were, standing in the doorway to the common room, metal hanging at\nyour side where you had been missing an arm. It was beautiful, rose gold with\nsilver accents, styled the same as his, somehow completely feminine and\ncompletely you. Bucky couldn\u2019t take his eyes off it.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d you asked shyly.</p><p>He slowly walked over and reached out to run his flesh hand\nup and down the metal.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cLike it?\u201d he whispered meeting your eyes, his voice an\noctave lower than normal. \u201cDoll, I may not be able to keep my hands off you\nanymore. This is the sexiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>You beamed at him even as a blush spread across your cheeks.\n\u201cNow you know how I feel about yours,\u201d you teased.</p><p>Bucky shook his head. \u201cMine is a weapon. Yours is a work of\nart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours is as beautiful as the man attached to it, and that\nmakes it pretty damn attractive.\u201d</p><p>It was Bucky\u2019s turn to blush. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to\nkeep eye contact, so he turned his attention back to your new arm.</p><p>\u201cDoes this one work the same as mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you smiled, wiggling your new fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna\ntake me a while to get used to having feeling on that side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat took me some time to adjust to, too,\u201d Bucky admitted.\n\u201cMy old arm didn\u2019t have that feature, and my brain wasn\u2019t sure how to react to\nreceiving sensory input from that side again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, that would be the week I felt jumpy every\nfifteen minutes,\u201d you grinned. Bucky grimaced.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize,\u201d you assured him. \u201cI\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ll have to deal with the same thing from me for the next few weeks. But\nfirst, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to do.\u201d</p><p>With that, you wrapped both your arms around him in the\nfirst full hug you had ever given anyone. He returned your embrace and the two\nof you stood in each other\u2019s arms far longer than necessary, never noticing\nthat Nat had long since slipped out of the room.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not quite fighting like Nat anymore,\u201d Bucky chuckled\nas he held out his hand to help you up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with this arm! I\u2019ve never had to\nuse it before when fighting.\u201d You took his offered hand and he hauled you off\nthe mat.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat makes it a weakness. You\u2019re good at using\nthe rest of your limbs, but as soon as you don\u2019t know what to do with a second\narm, it becomes a tool for your opponent to use against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew telling Tony yes would mean having to relearn how to\nfunction,\u201d you sighed. \u201cHow can your brain and body give me the ability to use\nthis arm but not the muscle memory for how to fight with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working on finding the answer to that,\u201d Bruce\ncommented from the edge of the ring. \u201cKeep it up, guys. We\u2019re getting some\ngreat readings.\u201d</p><p>Bucky nodded and took his stance. \u201cRemember what I showed\nyou. Let\u2019s run it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d You scratched at the sensor stuck to the left side\nof your neck and mimicked his position. \u201cCome at me, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your soulmate, Barnes,\u201d Tony laughed. \u201cI\u2019m rooting\nfor her to beat your ass.\u201d</p><p>Tony and Bruce had set up monitors around the sparring ring\nin the gym and stuck twenty adhesive sensors all over your body so they could\nstudy how you were physically reacting to your new arm. F.R.I.D.A.Y. was\nmonitoring and recording your movements, and they needed you to work your arm\nin a variety of motions. Bucky had taken the whole thing as an opportunity to\nteach you how to fight with two-armed combat. He insisted you were doing well,\nbut after years of training you felt like a beginner again and were not\nenjoying it.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d You hit the mat again. \u201cCan I just stay here, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the movement down,\u201d Bucky assured you, \u201cyou just\nhaven\u2019t gotten it up to speed yet.\u201d</p><p>Propping yourself up on your elbows, you shot him a glare.\n\u201cI could have gotten up to speed with a punching bag.

We\u2019ve got all the readings\nwe need for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Y/N,\u201d Bruce added as he tried to pack up his gear.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let you know what we find out.\u201d The last part of his sentence was\nswallowed by the door as Tony practically dragged him out of the gym.</p><p>Bucky rolled off of you and turned his face to meet your\neyes. \u201cThey forgot their sensors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d you replied drolly, pulling off the one that\nhad been itching. \u201cI\u2019m not giving them back, though. These things can burn in\nhell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Tony has more.\u201d Bucky laughed at your annoyed\nexpression.</p><p>\u201cRemind me again how I ended up their science experiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said yes to this beautiful thing,\u201d he replied, grabbing\nyour metal hand and pressing a kiss to the palm. His voice dropped an octave as\nhe continued, \u201cI hope you know what it does to me?\u201d</p><p>You scooted closer and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cI hope it\nhelps you realize even though the reason you have yours is ugly, your arm is\nstill beautiful. You are not what was done to you, no matter how much your\nemotions lie about that.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as you rested your foreheads together. \u201cWhat did I\never do to deserve someone like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did nothing to not deserve me,\u201d you whispered. \u201cI could\nask you the same question, you know. The person you\u2019ve become despite all you\nwent through is remarkable, and I\u2019ll be forever in awe of how kind and caring\nyou are.\u201d</p><p>The two of you stayed on the floor of the gym much longer\nthan you had intended, your mouths expressing your love for each other without\nwords until neither of you could breathe.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you can carry that box knowing what\u2019s in\nit. Where did you even get that thing?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged, a motion Bucky caught from his safe distance\nof almost fifty feet behind you. \u201cTony found it somewhere. All I had to do was\nmention Clint and payback, and he was all in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d Bucky said, \u201cyou found out from\nan \u2018unnamed source\u2019 that Clint was responsible for my spider problem, and this\nwas the first thing you came up with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically, yeah.\u201d You placed the carrier just inside\nClint\u2019s room and opened the lid before closing the door tightly. \u201cIt seemed\nlike an appropriate response.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me to never get in a prank war with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh,\u201d you winced, \u201cyeah, that would escalate too quickly\nfor sure.\u201d</p><p>It took two hours, but you were both rewarded with the\nsatisfying sounds of Clint\u2019s screams echoing through the whole tower. He\nstormed into the common room where the two of you were curled up on the couch,\nwatching a movie. You looked up at him and attempted to appear innocent, but\nyou were pretty sure you were failing.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong, Barton?\u201d</p><p>Clint crossed his arms and affixed you with a pointed glare.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did you even <i>get</i> a bird-eating spider?\u201d</p>",

But\nfirst, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to do.\u201d</p><p>With that, you wrapped both your arms around him in the\nfirst full hug you had ever given anyone.

I\u2019ve never had to\nuse it before when fighting.\u201d You took his offered hand and he hauled you off\nthe mat.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat makes it a weakness. You\u2019re good at using\nthe rest of your limbs, but as soon as you don\u2019t know what to do with a second\narm, it becomes a tool for your opponent to use against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew telling Tony yes would mean having to relearn how to\nfunction,\u201d you sighed. \u201cHow can your brain and body give me the ability to use\nthis arm but not the muscle memory for how to fight with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working on finding the answer to that,\u201d Bruce\ncommented from the edge of the ring. \u201cKeep it up, guys. We\u2019re getting some\ngreat readings.\u201d</p><p>Bucky nodded and took his stance. \u201cRemember what I showed\nyou. Let\u2019s run it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d You scratched at the sensor stuck to the left side\nof your neck and mimicked his position. \u201cCome at me, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your soulmate, Barnes,\u201d Tony laughed. \u201cI\u2019m rooting\nfor her to beat your ass.\u201d</p><p>Tony and Bruce had set up monitors around the sparring ring\nin the gym and stuck twenty adhesive sensors all over your body so they could\nstudy how you were physically reacting to your new arm. F.R.I.D.A.Y. was\nmonitoring and recording your movements, and they needed you to work your arm\nin a variety of motions. Bucky had taken the whole thing as an opportunity to\nteach you how to fight with two-armed combat. He insisted you were doing well,\nbut after years of training you felt like a beginner again and were not\nenjoying it.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d You hit the mat again. \u201cCan I just stay here, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the movement down,\u201d Bucky assured you, \u201cyou just\nhaven\u2019t gotten it up to speed yet.\u201d</p><p>Propping yourself up on your elbows, you shot him a glare.\n\u201cI could have gotten up to speed with a punching bag.

You\u2019re good at using\nthe rest of your limbs, but as soon as you don\u2019t know what to do with a second\narm, it becomes a tool for your opponent to use against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew telling Tony yes would mean having to relearn how to\nfunction,\u201d you sighed. \u201cHow can your brain and body give me the ability to use\nthis arm but not the muscle memory for how to fight with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working on finding the answer to that,\u201d Bruce\ncommented from the edge of the ring. \u201cKeep it up, guys. We\u2019re getting some\ngreat readings.\u201d</p><p>Bucky nodded and took his stance. \u201cRemember what I showed\nyou. Let\u2019s run it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d You scratched at the sensor stuck to the left side\nof your neck and mimicked his position. \u201cCome at me, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your soulmate, Barnes,\u201d Tony laughed. \u201cI\u2019m rooting\nfor her to beat your ass.\u201d</p><p>Tony and Bruce had set up monitors around the sparring ring\nin the gym and stuck twenty adhesive sensors all over your body so they could\nstudy how you were physically reacting to your new arm. F.R.I.D.A.Y. was\nmonitoring and recording your movements, and they needed you to work your arm\nin a variety of motions. Bucky had taken the whole thing as an opportunity to\nteach you how to fight with two-armed combat. He insisted you were doing well,\nbut after years of training you felt like a beginner again and were not\nenjoying it.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d You hit the mat again. \u201cCan I just stay here, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the movement down,\u201d Bucky assured you, \u201cyou just\nhaven\u2019t gotten it up to speed yet.\u201d</p><p>Propping yourself up on your elbows, you shot him a glare.\n\u201cI could have gotten up to speed with a punching bag. You just wanted revenge\nfor Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, every time you hit the mat I feel it too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel this.\u201d You took his offered hand and jerked, pulling\nhim down on top of you. </p><p>\u201cYou realize,\u201d he laughed, lying on top of you, \u201cwe both had\nto feel me falling on you and you being landed on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you winced, \u201cI didn\u2019t really think that through, did\nI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you two look like you\u2019re about to go all lovey-dovey\non us,\u201d Tony interrupted, \u201cBruce and I are gonna go. We\u2019ve got all the readings\nwe need for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Y/N,\u201d Bruce added as he tried to pack up his gear.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let you know what we find out.\u201d The last part of his sentence was\nswallowed by the door as Tony practically dragged him out of the gym.</p><p>Bucky rolled off of you and turned his face to meet your\neyes. \u201cThey forgot their sensors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d you replied drolly, pulling off the one that\nhad been itching. \u201cI\u2019m not giving them back, though. These things can burn in\nhell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Tony has more.\u201d Bucky laughed at your annoyed\nexpression.</p><p>\u201cRemind me again how I ended up their science experiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said yes to this beautiful thing,\u201d he replied, grabbing\nyour metal hand and pressing a kiss to the palm. His voice dropped an octave as\nhe continued, \u201cI hope you know what it does to me?\u201d</p><p>You scooted closer and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cI hope it\nhelps you realize even though the reason you have yours is ugly, your arm is\nstill beautiful. You are not what was done to you, no matter how much your\nemotions lie about that.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as you rested your foreheads together. \u201cWhat did I\never do to deserve someone like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did nothing to not deserve me,\u201d you whispered. \u201cI could\nask you the same question, you know. The person you\u2019ve become despite all you\nwent through is remarkable, and I\u2019ll be forever in awe of how kind and caring\nyou are.\u201d</p><p>The two of you stayed on the floor of the gym much longer\nthan you had intended, your mouths expressing your love for each other without\nwords until neither of you could breathe.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you can carry that box knowing what\u2019s in\nit. Where did you even get that thing?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged, a motion Bucky caught from his safe distance\nof almost fifty feet behind you. \u201cTony found it somewhere. All I had to do was\nmention Clint and payback, and he was all in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d Bucky said, \u201cyou found out from\nan \u2018unnamed source\u2019 that Clint was responsible for my spider problem, and this\nwas the first thing you came up with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically, yeah.\u201d You placed the carrier just inside\nClint\u2019s room and opened the lid before closing the door tightly. \u201cIt seemed\nlike an appropriate response.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me to never get in a prank war with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh,\u201d you winced, \u201cyeah, that would escalate too quickly\nfor sure.\u201d</p><p>It took two hours, but you were both rewarded with the\nsatisfying sounds of Clint\u2019s screams echoing through the whole tower. He\nstormed into the common room where the two of you were curled up on the couch,\nwatching a movie. You looked up at him and attempted to appear innocent, but\nyou were pretty sure you were failing.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong, Barton?\u201d</p><p>Clint crossed his arms and affixed you with a pointed glare.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did you even <i>get</i> a bird-eating spider?\u201d</p>",

Just say no to Oscorp. I never got the memo but needed the money\u2026 loans don\u2019t pay themselves you know. Anyway I\u2019m currently stuck with Shield see that bold and underline not working for Shield stuck with them. Apparently I need to be observed for my powers. I already told them I wouldn\u2019t use them and it\u2019s not even my fault\u2026well maybe a little I did take the job at Oscorp. Lesson learned never work for Oscorp. Am I making it that clear for everyone? Ok then. Um anyway I use to be research/supervisor veterinarian at the place that should not be mentioned(basically made sure animals were treated as humanely as possible while doing some research on the side). Had fun did my work just got curious tried to stand up for what I believe and now I\u2019m stuck at Shield. Powers you say, well I\u2019m still working on it but so far I can make fire and walk through walls. Have no clue on how I\u2019m doing it so learning a bit. I know what you\u2019re thinking right now if you can walk through walls why not escape. I could but I\u2019m hoping for good behavior with Shield doubt it though since they are scarier than the CIA times 10. Anyway they allowed me to make this Tumblr as long as no classified info gets loose. Anyway that\u2019s about it, oh wait a min I should have probably mention this early my name is Rachel Lewis nice to meet you all.\n\n\nOOC: Hey dudes this is my first Tumblr so I guess it\u2019s my first tumbles. Anyway still learning the ropes so don\u2019t get mad if I do an obvious mistake.

So, I thought why not celebrate this season with our lovable sarcastic scientist Bruce Banner and he\u2019s equally lovable mean green machine Hulk.</p><p>So, what does that mean for you? Well it means you can submit any original fanart, fanfic, fan videos, fan playlist, moodboards etc. as long as it\u2019s related content to this blog. Anything at all relating to Bruce Banner or Hulk mix with an autumn theme. However, if your work is going to deal with nsfw content please tag appropriately. Also, the tag for this event will be #autumnbruce. However, you may also send your fanwork to the submit box or message with a link to your post, so we can reblog from the source. The point of this prompt week is to have fun and spread the love of Bruce Banner and Hulk.</p><h2><b>Where:</b> All posts will be submitted and shown on this blog\u00a0<a href=\"https://brucebannerdrabbles.tumblr.com/\">https://brucebannerdrabbles.tumblr.com/</a></h2><h2><b>When to submit:</b> Oct 1st-Nov 4th\u00a0\u00a0</h2><h2><b>But you said it was a week????</b></h2><p>The last week of October is the main prompt week while the whole month of October has daily prompts. I\u2019ve noticed that giving daily prompts might overwhelm some but for others the challenge is enjoyable. While week-long prompts can stress some but be a fuel for others. So, to please both groups.
