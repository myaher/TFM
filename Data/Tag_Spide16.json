Stop laughing at me mom!&rdquo;</p><p>-he has a rude awakening when his dad abandons his family</p><p>-he gets angry and resentful about the whole concept of soulmates because how could someone just leave the person they&rsquo;re destined to be with</p><p>-he&rsquo;s still an angry kid when Tony Stark breaks into his garage</p><p>-while Tony&rsquo;s there, Tony talks nonstop about his soulmate Pepper, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just so amazingly brilliant and I need to get back to her!&rdquo;</p><p>-it makes Harley realize that maybe not all soulmates are like his mom and dad were and maybe he can be happy with his</p><p>-when Tony leaves he promises to keep in contact with Harley and starts calling weekly without fail</p><p>-he even visits Harley when he has the time and by the time Harley is 13 they&rsquo;ve built the first working Ironlad suit</p><p>-(the actual first one didn&rsquo;t work because Harley tried to do it alone and when Tony saw it he decided to scrap the whole thing and help make him one that will be better)</p><p>-by the time Civil War rolls around Harley&rsquo;s been training to be Ironlad for 2 years and is basically a master with the armor</p><p>-Tony asks him to help out with the fight  in Germany since he doesn&rsquo;t think his former teammates will actually go as far as to seriously hurt anyone</p><p>-Harley obviously agrees cause it&rsquo;ll be his first real fight and he&rsquo;s been wanting to punch Captain America ever since he saw his first PSA</p><p>-Tony tells him that the team will consist of him, Ironlad, War Machine, Vision, Black Widow, the king of Wakanda (who is apparently some type of superhero??), and a new superhero called Spider-Man</p><p>-as soon as Harley sees his first video of Spider-Man something inside of him clicks and he realizes Spider-Mans symbol is his soulmark</p><p>-he comes to the conclusion that Spider-Man is his soulmate and gets super nervous and excited for Germany</p><p>-after all, he&rsquo;s gonna meet his soulmate soon and his soulmate is apparently young and strong enough to lift cars!</p><p>-(Harley falls in love just a bit when he hears about Spider-Man developing his own web fluid)</p><p>-meanwhile Peter is freaking out, cause Tony fucking Stark just asked him to go to Germany and help him beat up Captain America</p><p>-He&rsquo;ll be forced to spend time around the 2 people (that he knows of) that have an arc reactor</p><p>-he&rsquo;s super scared about one of them finding out about his soulmark and either A) one of them being a match or B) having it be an unrequited mark </p><p>-at this point he doesn&rsquo;t know which one is worse</p><p>-when he gets to Germany he doesn&rsquo;t  have time to worry because as soon as he lands he&rsquo;s being whisked off to fight the rouge Avengers</p><p>-when the fight starts he can barely focus on the things going on around him because apparently there&rsquo;s 3 people with Iron Man armor now</p><p>-the person inside the new armor sounds young and Peter can hear Tony call him Ironlad over the comms </p><p>-when Peter starts making pop culture references while fighting Ironlad understands them and actively responds</p><p>-when the rouges surrender and the fight is over (team Ironman won in this due to Harley&rsquo;s help) the Ironlad armor opens and out of it comes a boy Peters age</p><p>-oh no he&rsquo;s hot</p><p>-and he&rsquo;s heading right towards Peter</p><p>-while Peters having a inner freak out Harley gets to Peter and of since he&rsquo;s a disaster of a human the first words out of his mouth are &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Harely Keener and I think you might be my soulmate&rdquo;</p><p>- Peter is S T U N N E D</p><p>-this cute boy in front of him just said that he thinks they&rsquo;re soulmates???</p><p>-at first Peter doesn&rsquo;t believe him because there&rsquo;s no way this gorgeous boy could be his soulmate, Parker luck wouldn&rsquo;t allow it</p><p>-after Peter thinks about it for a bit he realizes that it&rsquo;s probably true since the boy was wearing Iron Man armor which has an arc reactor in the exact location Peters soulmark is</p><p>-plus if the boy had come to the conclusion that they&rsquo;re soulmates the boys soulmark probably has something to do with Spider-Man </p><p>-Peter agrees to compare soulmark once they get back to the hotel to make sure they&rsquo;re a match</p><p>-low and behold, turns out they are a match!</p><p>-Peters never been happier, he lived his entire life thinking he&rsquo;d be stuck with some dude three times his age and it turns out his soulmark is a hot dude that&rsquo;s only a year older than him</p><p>-He&rsquo;s so happy that in that moment he knows that everything will be fine</p><p>I might turn this into a full fic if I have enough motivation, for now I just had to get my ideas down.
