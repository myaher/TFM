From then forward, I kind of appreciate your music and the charm you all induce. I was too poor to go to one of your concerts, but the one song I would have loved to see live was \"Diana\". \n\nThis account is dedicated to you lads, for bringing up my spirits whenever I was down through the video diaries, songs or interviews. \n\nYou have all went your separate ways and I am proud of you lads. Im glad to see Liam and Louis still buddying it up. Im glad to see Niall playing golf and having his album released last October. Im glad Harry came out (finally) as bisexual and his solo debut was golden! I'm glad Zayn and Gigi are living a grand life and Zayn is still pursuing music.\n\nThis is for the 1000 days of memories. And more. Thank you boys for being a part of my generation of growing up\n\n- Sincerely, Kansas",
