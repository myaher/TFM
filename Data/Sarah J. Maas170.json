I&rsquo;m just glad I managed to reach 10 with the help of a few novellas. Plus, now I&rsquo;ve written my own book. That should count for something!</p><p>Bold titles have reviews, click the ratings to check them out!</p><ol><li><b><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33590260-kingdom-of-ash\">Kingdom of Ash by Sarah J.

As I&rsquo;ve grown with these books, so has my reading tastes, but I still have a special place in my heart for Throne of Glass. I know it&rsquo;s controversial, and has some problematic elements, but it still is special to me.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30238172-now-a-major-motion-picture\">Now a Major Motion Picture</a><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30238172-now-a-major-motion-picture\"> by Cori McCarthy</a> || 3/5 Stars<br />This book was just meh.

Since then, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to continue the series but I&rsquo;ve been putting it off.

The people are calling them out of this world!!!!literally).</p><p>So they stay in their house, and they tell them all about their world and why exactly was Aelin hurled literally through worlds, also they tell them about the horrors and the things they\u2019ve endured and in return Rhys starts to tell them about what they had to endure, and how he and his family have found each other, and how he found Feyre, who is the light of his life, and just basically retelling they\u2019re life stories.</p><p>So in the end Rhys would want to introduce these new friends to his family, and Cassian and Aedion got really really competitive with each other(but they secretly like each other) and Cassian staied up all night and got pissy with Aedion and they swapped war stories, and how they honourly defend their home, like for hours, and Cassian bragged about how he has 7 siphons to hold back his power but Aedion only said that in a hand to hand combat Aedion would nail Cassian, so they decided to fight-drunkenly May I add- which Aelin at that point called them territorial fae bastards ,so they ended up laughing and decided that they\u2019re both equally strong*wink wink*.</p><p>As for Mor she connected to Fenrys, and he was flirting the hell outat first, until She told him that she was not interested, so he decided to be friends with her, and boy their friendship was dirty as hell, they constantly made dirty comments about everyone and about each other and they adviced everyone on how to dress better(which they\u2019ve decided that they\u2019re the only worthy people to decide who wears what and what\u2019s best for everyone).</p><p>Also did I tell you that Lysandra and Azriel became the bestest of friends? Yeah , Azriel really loved Lysandra\u2018 many skins and was just fascinated with how fast she can change from one form to another, also she was at aww with Azriel\u2019s bats and she tried to transform and make bats of her own, which she ended up successfully doing and everyone marvelled over how beautiful and accurate they are.</p><p>Also I don\u2019t need to tell you how much Sass was going around from Aelin and Rhys, these two became the fastest friends, and they pissed each other off easily (from who has a better style to who has a better world ,of course after 10-20 years of rebuilding), and Feyre and Rowan sat aside and just watched their dork mates be idiots and just loved their life.</p><p>In the end when it\u2019s time to leave, everyone is so bummed out that they had to leave, and Cass would not admit it, but he shed a tear secretly! also Mor had so much gifts for them it was unbelievable, but as a special gift Aelin gave them a little bit of her fire, a small dosage that will burn forever as a sign of her gratitude, for someone who helped out a stranger go home when they were lost the most. Also Feyre as their parting gift gave them a canvas that had a scenery of what she imagined their world looked like, velaris and a portal between these two worlds,to remind them that they\u2019re not alone, and that they survived the war and are now living a happy beautiful life with their loved ones. </p><p>So they said their goodbyes and Aelin hugged Rhys tightly and told him thank you, and Feyre hugged Aelin, and told her that they have a second home here in velaris and that they should visit whenever, and she also promised them that they\u2019d visit Terrsan(but since they don\u2019t know how to open portals of course either Aelin or Rowan would come and get them;)), also Aedion hugged Cassian tightly and told him that hes stronger in his ear at which Cassian laughed and slapped his arm and told him it was very nice knowing him, also Lysandra said goodbyes to Azriel and transformed one last time for him. As for Fenrys and Mor they sobbed in each other\u2019s arm and just made promises that they\u2019ll visit and they\u2019ll try their best to keep their court In style and that they\u2019ll always remember this trip and that it was like a dream. So without turning around everyone went through the portal and went home to Terssan, and everyone knew that for however long they lived they\u2019ll always have a home in velaris and will always remember a stranger\u2019s hand that guided them and their queen through the dark.</p><p>The end.</p>",
