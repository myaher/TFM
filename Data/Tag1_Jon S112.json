She didn\u2019t bother to look at the trees, where Robb always liked to hide; Jon liked his feet planted on solid ground, and Winterfell\u2019s swordsmaster had spent years training that flatfootedness out of him. Instead, she looked at the shadows.</p><p>And there he was: Jon, curled into a ball that made him look smaller than his gangly years; hidden in the dark curve of a sycamore overlooking the pools.</p><p>Carefully, Catelyn picked her path through the snow and leaves, until she was close enough to feel the heat of the pools\u2019 steam\u00a0on her frozen fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never hated you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve never hated you?\u201d was the immediate response.<br/></p><p>That stung. Catelyn hadn\u2019t ever been so close to Jon, that was true enough; but she\u2019d never hated him either. To think that he had wasn\u2019t a pleasant thought.</p><p><i>He\u2019s a child.</i></p><p>\u201cThis is about your mother,\u201d she said, instead, keeping her voice soothing.<br/></p><p>\u201cEverything is about her,\u201d Jon replied bitterly, after a long pause.\u00a0\u201cEveryone else knows, though, and it was staring at me all along. You-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cEveryone knows?\u201d Catelyn demanded.\u00a0Adrenaline jolted through her, but she forced herself to stay calm.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you know her?\u201d Jon asked flatly, head poking out of the shadows to level a look almost exactly like Ned\u2019s at her. He sounded more hesitant than angry now, and Catelyn thought she could all but taste the desire soaking through his voice. <i>Yes, </i>she decided. <i>Ned was wrong to keep this from him.</i> \u201cWas she- how was she?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cShe was very pretty,\u201d Catelyn said slowly. She\u2019d met Lyanna Stark for all of a few minutes at Harrenhal\u2019s Tourney before the girl had run off; what she\u2019d heard of her since hadn\u2019t been very complimentary.<br/></p><p>But Ned had loved her- still loved her- and Jon was her only child. Catelyn wouldn\u2019t taint those memories with her own suspicions.</p><p>\u201cPretty, and bright. She could wield a sword better than half the men her age, and if her father had allowed it, she\u2019d likely have entered all the tourneys in the world. And when you\u2019re as small as she was- it\u2019s courage and brains that won her battles, until the last. Ned tells me you get that from her.\u201d<br/></p><p><i>Lyanna\u2019s brains, </i>had been his actual words, <i>and not an ounce of her ambition. He\u2019d disappear for the Wall if I allowed it, accept the black and the oaths without a second glance.</i></p><p><i>Sounds like her brother, </i>Catelyn had replied, just as Jon disarmed Robb with a flick of his sword that looked impressive even to her. Ned had looked so surprised, and Catelyn had smiled, slow and wide. <i>He is your son as well, Ned, now. And just because he holds his words important doesn\u2019t make him a fool. Or have you forgotten who challenged Theon Greyjoy to a duel of honor when he was not but ten?</i></p><p>\u201cWhat did she- look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong hair,\u201d Catelyn murmured, eyes closing.\u00a0\u201cDark as yours. You\u2019ve her eyes, as well, the shape and the size- though the color\u2019s all Ned\u2019s. Arya\u2019s, as well. Your grandmother\u2019s, apparently.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying to me!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Catelyn jerked away, nearly losing her balance on the leaf-strewn ground. When she straightened, Jon\u2019s hands were fisted at his sides and he looked mulishly stubborn. Like Ned had looked, back when Catelyn first pushed him- irritated; somber; regretful but not repenting.</p><p>\u201cHer eyes were <i>purple,\u201d </i>said Jon, and the disgust seemed to swallow him whole.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what that Dornish ambassador said! Her eyes were purple, and she killed herself, and-\u201d<br/></p><p>She twisted to fully meet Jon, face to face, and asked sharply, \u201cWho did you think your mother was, Jon?\u201d<br/></p><p>He shrank back, just a little, at Catelyn\u2019s face, before straightening defiantly.\u00a0\u201cAshara,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cAshara Dayne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Surprise left Catelyn faint. She considered letting Jon keep believing in the lie- it was easier, all truth told- but unfair, in the end, to Ashara Dayne\u2019s memory, to Ned\u2019s own honor, and to this little boy standing in front of her.\u00a0\u201cI see why you\u2019d believe that.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t true,\u201d Jon said, defeated.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Catelyn gently. She reached forward and wrapped her hand over Jon\u2019s shoulder, using the leverage to sink to her knees in front of him.\u00a0\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t true. But it is past time you knew, I think.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, body like stone under her fingers. His eyes- so similar to Ned\u2019s; so dissimilar, too: more hurting, more angry, more bitter- didn\u2019t look away from her.</p><p>\u201cNed didn\u2019t tell you at first because it was dangerous,\u201d Catelyn explained. Better Jon understood this before it was overshadowed by the revelation. If Jon were to spill even a hint of it to anyone- the consequences could be disastrous.\u00a0\u201cChildren have loose lips; and if news reached the King, there might not have been much left of us Starks by the time he was done with us. Better you remain ignorant and loved and safe, Ned thought, even if it was all a lie.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cFather&hellip; committed treason?\u201d Jon whispered.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAt the end of Robert\u2019s Rebellion, he went to Dorne to find his sister, Lyanna. He found her at the Tower of Joy and slew Arthur Dayne, two others of the Kingsguard- and he entered the tower to find her on a bed of roses and blood.\u201d Oh, how Catelyn had had nightmares after Ned had told her! How cruel the world had been to Lyanna Stark, to Ned, to all those Ned had once named family!\u00a0\u201cShe did not live to see dusk, but she was not alone in the tower. For beside her was a babe, just a few days old.\u201d<br/></p><p>Jon frowned.\u00a0\u201cA babe?\u201d Then, realizing:\u00a0<i>\u201cMe.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d affirmed Catelyn.\u00a0\u201cYou.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut then- my father wasn\u2019t- isn\u2019t-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLyanna was stolen away by a man,\u201d said Catelyn, watching Jon sadly.\u00a0\u201cDo you remember who?\u201d<br/></p><p>He looked numb. Shell-shocked.</p><p>\u201cRhaegar Targaryen.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd a son of Rhaegar Targaryen would be&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cA prince.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNot a prince,\u201d corrected Catelyn.\u00a0\u201cThe crown prince. And with Rhaegar dead? He\u2019d be king.\u201d<br/></p><p>Jon shook his head.\u00a0\u201cNobody\u2019s going to ride to give me a- a- throne. <i>Nobody.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cAnd that matters little.\u201d Catelyn cupped his jaw and brushed a lock of hair from Jon\u2019s forehead.\u00a0\u201cThe things Robert Baratheon is known for- restraint is not one of them. He attacks threats with his hammer, and beats them until their blood turns rivers red.\u201d A gruesome picture- she did regret how Jon turned white and strained- but also necessary. Better he be wary now than careless. And if he remembered how Rhaegar died, all to the better.\u00a0\u201cDo you see why we wished to keep it silent?\u201d<br/></p><p><i>Understand. Understand that there are no easy choices in this. Understand that we have done the best we can.</i></p><p>Slowly, Jon nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered.\u00a0\u201cI do.\u201d<br/></p><p>Catelyn let her hand drop, and bowed her head. Jon left, but Catelyn remained, silent, shrouded in shadows, under trees that left her shivering and frightened. Finally, she rose and almost walked away, but then paused at the edge to the godswood.</p><p><i>The best we can, </i>she thought, remembering rumors from the south that Robert would ride north soon. <i>Let us pray it will be enough.</i></p>",

Like Ned had looked, back when Catelyn first pushed him- irritated; somber; regretful but not repenting.</p><p>\u201cHer eyes were <i>purple,\u201d </i>said Jon, and the disgust seemed to swallow him whole.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what that Dornish ambassador said! Her eyes were purple, and she killed herself, and-\u201d<br></p><p>She twisted to fully meet Jon, face to face, and asked sharply, \u201cWho did you think your mother was, Jon?\u201d<br></p><p>He shrank back, just a little, at Catelyn\u2019s face, before straightening defiantly.\u00a0\u201cAshara,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cAshara Dayne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Surprise left Catelyn faint. She considered letting Jon keep believing in the lie- it was easier, all truth told- but unfair, in the end, to Ashara Dayne\u2019s memory, to Ned\u2019s own honor, and to this little boy standing in front of her.\u00a0\u201cI see why you\u2019d believe that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t true,\u201d Jon said, defeated.<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Catelyn gently. She reached forward and wrapped her hand over Jon\u2019s shoulder, using the leverage to sink to her knees in front of him.\u00a0\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t true. But it is past time you knew, I think.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, body like stone under her fingers. His eyes- so similar to Ned\u2019s; so dissimilar, too: more hurting, more angry, more bitter- didn\u2019t look away from her.</p><p>\u201cNed didn\u2019t tell you at first because it was dangerous,\u201d Catelyn explained. Better Jon understood this before it was overshadowed by the revelation. If Jon were to spill even a hint of it to anyone- the consequences could be disastrous.\u00a0\u201cChildren have loose lips; and if news reached the King, there might not have been much left of us Starks by the time he was done with us. Better you remain ignorant and loved and safe, Ned thought, even if it was all a lie.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFather\u2026 committed treason?\u201d Jon whispered.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAt the end of Robert\u2019s Rebellion, he went to Dorne to find his sister, Lyanna. He found her at the Tower of Joy and slew Arthur Dayne, two others of the Kingsguard- and he entered the tower to find her on a bed of roses and blood.\u201d Oh, how Catelyn had had nightmares after Ned had told her! How cruel the world had been to Lyanna Stark, to Ned, to all those Ned had once named family!\u00a0\u201cShe did not live to see dusk, but she was not alone in the tower. For beside her was a babe, just a few days old.\u201d<br></p><p>Jon frowned.\u00a0\u201cA babe?\u201d Then, realizing:\u00a0<i>\u201cMe.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d affirmed Catelyn.\u00a0\u201cYou.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut then- my father wasn\u2019t- isn\u2019t-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLyanna was stolen away by a man,\u201d said Catelyn, watching Jon sadly.\u00a0\u201cDo you remember who?\u201d<br></p><p>He looked numb. Shell-shocked.</p><p>\u201cRhaegar Targaryen.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd a son of Rhaegar Targaryen would be\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cA prince.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot a prince,\u201d corrected Catelyn.\u00a0\u201cThe crown prince. And with Rhaegar dead? He\u2019d be king.\u201d<br></p><p>Jon shook his head.\u00a0\u201cNobody\u2019s going to ride to give me a- a- throne. <i>Nobody.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cAnd that matters little.\u201d Catelyn cupped his jaw and brushed a lock of hair from Jon\u2019s forehead.\u00a0\u201cThe things Robert Baratheon is known for- restraint is not one of them. He attacks threats with his hammer, and beats them until their blood turns rivers red.\u201d A gruesome picture- she did regret how Jon turned white and strained- but also necessary. Better he be wary now than careless. And if he remembered how Rhaegar died, all to the better.\u00a0\u201cDo you see why we wished to keep it silent?\u201d<br></p><p><i>Understand. Understand that there are no easy choices in this. Understand that we have done the best we can.</i></p><p>Slowly, Jon nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered.\u00a0\u201cI do.\u201d<br></p><p>Catelyn let her hand drop, and bowed her head. Jon left, but Catelyn remained, silent, shrouded in shadows, under trees that left her shivering and frightened. Finally, she rose and almost walked away, but then paused at the edge to the godswood.</p><p><i>The best we can, </i>she thought, remembering rumors from the south that Robert would ride north soon. <i>Let us pray it will be enough.</i></p>",

She considered letting Jon keep believing in the lie- it was easier, all truth told- but unfair, in the end, to Ashara Dayne&rsquo;s memory, to Ned&rsquo;s own honor, and to this little boy standing in front of her.&nbsp;&ldquo;I see why you&rsquo;d believe that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; Jon said, defeated.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Catelyn gently. She reached forward and wrapped her hand over Jon&rsquo;s shoulder, using the leverage to sink to her knees in front of him.&nbsp;&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t true. But it is past time you knew, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>He stilled, body like stone under her fingers. His eyes- so similar to Ned&rsquo;s; so dissimilar, too: more hurting, more angry, more bitter- didn&rsquo;t look away from her.</p><p>&ldquo;Ned didn&rsquo;t tell you at first because it was dangerous,&rdquo; Catelyn explained. Better Jon understood this before it was overshadowed by the revelation. If Jon were to spill even a hint of it to anyone- the consequences could be disastrous.&nbsp;&ldquo;Children have loose lips; and if news reached the King, there might not have been much left of us Starks by the time he was done with us. Better you remain ignorant and loved and safe, Ned thought, even if it was all a lie.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Father&hellip; committed treason?&rdquo; Jon whispered.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;At the end of Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion, he went to Dorne to find his sister, Lyanna. He found her at the Tower of Joy and slew Arthur Dayne, two others of the Kingsguard- and he entered the tower to find her on a bed of roses and blood.&rdquo; Oh, how Catelyn had had nightmares after Ned had told her! How cruel the world had been to Lyanna Stark, to Ned, to all those Ned had once named family!&nbsp;&ldquo;She did not live to see dusk, but she was not alone in the tower. For beside her was a babe, just a few days old.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jon frowned.&nbsp;&ldquo;A babe?&rdquo; Then, realizing:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Me.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; affirmed Catelyn.&nbsp;&ldquo;You.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But then- my father wasn&rsquo;t- isn&rsquo;t-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Lyanna was stolen away by a man,&rdquo; said Catelyn, watching Jon sadly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you remember who?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He looked numb. Shell-shocked.</p><p>&ldquo;Rhaegar Targaryen.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And a son of Rhaegar Targaryen would be&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A prince.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not a prince,&rdquo; corrected Catelyn.&nbsp;&ldquo;The crown prince. And with Rhaegar dead? He&rsquo;d be king.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jon shook his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s going to ride to give me a- a- throne. <i>Nobody.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;And that matters little.&rdquo; Catelyn cupped his jaw and brushed a lock of hair from Jon&rsquo;s forehead.&nbsp;&ldquo;The things Robert Baratheon is known for- restraint is not one of them. He attacks threats with his hammer, and beats them until their blood turns rivers red.&rdquo; A gruesome picture- she did regret how Jon turned white and strained- but also necessary. Better he be wary now than careless. And if he remembered how Rhaegar died, all to the better.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you see why we wished to keep it silent?&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>Understand. Understand that there are no easy choices in this. Understand that we have done the best we can.</i></p><p>Slowly, Jon nodded.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he whispered.&nbsp;&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Catelyn let her hand drop, and bowed her head. Jon left, but Catelyn remained, silent, shrouded in shadows, under trees that left her shivering and frightened. Finally, she rose and almost walked away, but then paused at the edge to the godswood.</p><p><i>The best we can, </i>she thought, remembering rumors from the south that Robert would ride north soon. <i>Let us pray it will be enough.</i></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>In honor of the trailer, which we have waited for for far too long! Another ridiculous take on Jon assuming his parenthood, though this is&hellip; less humorous?

Jon was a better kid than Robb- easier, at least, being both quieter and less temperamental all at once. But when he got angry he tended to stay angry, and he also had a terrible habit of running into the woods when he felt like being alone.</p>\n<p>With Ned off to Castle Cerwyn for a week with delegations from all seven kingdoms, and Jon having apparently been in such a bad mood as to snap at Arya and make her cry- Arya, <i>crying, </i>over something unrelated to chores!- Catelyn had confronted him, and the boy had shouted for well over a quarter hour before fleeing. But now she had a good idea of what was bothering him, and Catelyn didn&rsquo;t feel remotely ready to deal with it.</p>\n<p>Though- staying silent would likely be crueler than telling the truth.</p>\n<p>Jon deserved the truth.</p>\n<p>She&rsquo;d fought over that very point with Ned, before he left. Jon hadn&rsquo;t been so suspicious of his mother&rsquo;s personality then, though, and <i>yes, </i>if Catelyn told him the truth there would likely be a moon&rsquo;s turn of irritated looks from her husband to deal with, not to mention a cold bed.</p>\n<p>And yet.</p>\n<p>Jon deserved the truth.</p>\n</p>",

Copy his expression. How does it feel? The way he holds his mouth, the tension in his chin\u2026 Honestly, it\u2019s not easy reading facial expressions when it\u2019s this dark and the quality is so bad (and he\u2019s out of focus too) so I\u2019m probably a bit off. But I feel like he\u2019s incredibly upset and holding back his anger and frustration and <i>resentment</i>. I think that\u2019s the feeling I\u2019m looking for. Not purely. He\u2019s sad too and almost a bit despondent, but there\u2019s resentment there, something he can\u2019t let her see, and so he can\u2019t even let his lip twitch the way it does when he\u2019s trying to control his anger.</p><p>And considering how not welcoming he is to her, how he doesn\u2019t reach out, doesn\u2019t start turning his face toward her until she\u2019s really close, and his expression doesn\u2019t change\u2026 His reason for being upset has to do with her in some capacity\u2013and she knows it. This isn\u2019t a normal thing for her to do, to reach out like this, so softly and tentatively.</p><h2>So what can it be?</h2><ul><li><b>The Dothraki have raided a settlement</b>\u00a0- I find this less likely, tbh. My gut says it\u2019s dragon related. But what does my gut know?<br/><br/></li><li><b>They\u2019ve learned about Wightserion and the Wall</b> - while I think this could be very possible looking at Jon\u2019s reaction (because he\u2019d be angry at both himself and her, he\u2019d feel guilty, question himself and his decisions etc) D\u00e6nerys\u2019 behavior doesn\u2019t seem fitting. Would she be this calm in this situation? Would she be understanding and soft? Or would she blame Jon? This is personal for her. And if he distances himself from her or they have a\u00a0\u201cyou just had to have your bleeding truce\u201d kind of fight, wouldn\u2019t she be annoyed with him and feel like he\u2019s disrespectful?<br/><br/></li><li><b>He\u2019s learned about the Tarlys</b> - Jon\u2019s reaction fits. Not only will he have upset bannermen on his hands and be worried she\u2019ll do something like that again, but he\u2019s also not seen Sam in years and now they\u2019re finally reunited and he brings with him the woman who murdered Sam\u2019s father and brother. And it can definitely make Jon question his decisions.\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> wondered whether it\u2019s Torrhen Stark\u2019s statue he visits, and perhaps it is.

But I feel like he\u2019s incredibly upset and holding back his anger and frustration and <i>resentment</i>. I think that\u2019s the feeling I\u2019m looking for. Not purely. He\u2019s sad too and almost a bit despondent, but there\u2019s resentment there, something he can\u2019t let her see, and so he can\u2019t even let his lip twitch the way it does when he\u2019s trying to control his anger.</p><p>And considering how not welcoming he is to her, how he doesn\u2019t reach out, doesn\u2019t start turning his face toward her until she\u2019s really close, and his expression doesn\u2019t change\u2026 His reason for being upset has to do with her in some capacity\u2013and she knows it.

Rhaena\nTargaryen started it in 36 AC: </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was Princess Rhaena, legend says, who\nput a dragons&rsquo; egg in Princess Alysanne&rsquo;s cradle, just as she had for Prince Jaehaerys\ntwo years earlier.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><i>Fire and Blood</i>, The Sons of\nthe Dragon</p><p>This seems to be more a family tradition\nthen something that is actually necessary to bond with a dragon. The Targaryens\nmounted dragons for hundreds of years on Dragonstone before the egg in the\ncradle became a thing. </p><p>So judging by the lore evidence, yes, it is\npossible for Jon to quickly bond and ride Rhaegal during S8. Then again, the\ntrailer can be a massive misdirect and Jon has no plans to mount a dragon. We\nwill find out in six weeks! </p>",

Davos on the battlements; ser Jorah and the Dothraki; Grey Worm, Missandei, and the Unsullied; Brienne, Podrick, and the KotV etc. They all seem to be taking place before the battle, though, as they prepare themselves to fight. And the orange shots seem to be on the battlements while the battle is raging on. The Jon shot, however, is probably outside the walls of Winterfell, so I don\u2019t find it odd.</p><p>The first thing that popped into my head when I saw this snippet was a scene in s2 of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>. She\u2019s lured away by an enemy and realizes a little too late that it\u2019s only a distraction to get her out of the way so they could get to her friends. And so she just <i>legs it </i>to get back to them&ndash;and of course arrives too late. Her friends have already been attacked and one of them died. It\u2019s one of those scenes that sticks with you. All these years later, even though I don\u2019t really remember much of the actual episode anymore, I still remember how engrossed I was and that growing sense of dread and panic as you watch her running even though it\u2019s pointless. So, yeah, that\u2019s where my mind went.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible that they\u2019re fighting the army of the dead on the fields outside, only for Jon to realize Winterfell itself is under attack (either by more dead or the GC) and he rushes there instantly.
