        "answer": "<p>fuck fuck fuck, you called my bluff\u2014now I have to <i>pick</i>.\u00a0</p><p>+Bonus for all of their smaller moments. For all the awkward hugs. For the moments before they were really close that hinted at their solidarity to come. Caleb constantly making sure they <i>both</i> had light. Caleb calling Beau a nerd. Beau letting Caleb use her to steady himself when he goes into Frumpkin-vision. Sharing berries and whiskey and talking about the afterlife. Leaning against each other after a hard fight. Just&hellip;every single littler interaction they ever have together.</p><p>5. Okay, look, Bowlgate was a legitimately fascinating character moment between the two of them, and revealed a lot about where both Caleb and Beau are coming from. We learned a lot about the kinds of things Caleb <i>will</i>\u00a0go into a moral panic over, and the types of things that push Beau\u2019s specific buttons. This moment\u2014perhaps more so than even Caleb\u2019s backstory reveal\u2014was also a crucial turning point in their relationship with each other. Their relationship is so much of a push-pull. They\u2019re never immediately on the same page, and this <i>huge, glaring</i>\u00a0moment of them being not only on utterly different pages, but also in wildly different <i>books</i>\u00a0provided the perfect opportunity for the two of them to work out how to bridge that gap of difference between them. Especially because they really are quite similar to each other.\u00a0</p><p>4. We haven\u2019t necessarily gotten a specific callback to it in a while, but the pact that Beau and Caleb made to keep each other on track was a very important moment in the two of them really dedicating themselves their odd little fledgling friendship. And even if they don\u2019t cite the pact they made, it\u2019s there in so many of their interactions\u2014especially more recent ones. Caleb is constantly appealing to Beau for her support on his plan to bring down the Assembly in no small part, I think, because they\u2019ve already established this link together. He doesn\u2019t really specifically appeal to the others to back his plays in this same way that he does with Beau. The two of them both struggle\u2014in different ways\u2014with how to\u00a0\u201cbe people.\u201d And while they have the others to ask for advice, they get a lot of their practical application of said advice, with each other. They\u2019ve both learned a lot from each other through the act of pushing one another.</p><p>3. Beau softly, gently, without comment, resting her hand on Caleb\u2019s shoulder as he shares his backstory in episode 49. Caleb desperately reaching out for Beau. Beau resting her hand back on top of his. Just&hellip;there\u2019s so much tenderness between them. Hard won in so many different ways. And in that moment she is just completely, and unequivocally <i>there</i> for him. And all of that immediately coming on the heels of&hellip;</p><p>2. Their argument in episode 48 It was so exemplary of all the things that are perfect and hard about their dynamic. Beau doesn\u2019t quite understand enough what Caleb\u2019s anxieties and triggers are regarding Yussah, but she thinks she\u2019s done this really nice thing for him, and is so, so disappointed and confused when instead of being met with excitement, she is rebuffed. Beau misinterpreting Caleb\u2019s fears and thinking that he doubts the Nein\u2019s likeliness to go to bat for him when, in fact, that\u2019s <i>exactly what he\u2019s afraid of</i>. He literally just had a mage that reminds him of Trent tell him to use his friends to save his own hide and not a few hours later Beau offers up <i>that very thing</i>. Caleb muttering\u00a0\u201cthe problem with friends is that you have to care for them.\u201d Caleb <i>admitting</i>\u00a0to caring about her and the Nein! Calling them friends! Sure, he walks away right after, but that\u2019s still so big, for him to actually vocalize that sentiment. Beau yelling after him.\u00a0\u201cYOU\u2019RE COOL, CALEB. SEE! JESTER THINKS YOU\u2019RE FUCKING COOL! BECAUSE SHE\u2019S YOUR <i>FUCKING FRIEND</i>!\u201d Caleb yelling at a tree. Honestly every about that scene was delightful.</p><p>1. Their conversation in episode 57. Caleb telling Beau, directly, that he <i>needs</i>\u00a0her to be his friend. Just&hellip;Caleb reaching out and recognizing that, yeah, these people really do care about him, and that he\u2019s come to rely on it to some extent. Beau telling him that her being his friend <i>has never been in question</i>. Telling him that what\u2019s always been unclear to her, even now, is whether or not Caleb understands that. It\u2019s not even that Beau is exactly unclear that Caleb returns the sentiment. It\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t know if Caleb really understands that he has people to support him, and who have his back, and she\u2019s <i>scared</i>\u00a0about what it might mean if he doesn\u2019t realize that, at this point. Beau telling Caleb that\u00a0\u201cdoing good\u201d is the best retribution for him (and the fact that she knows not to frame it as\u00a0\u201credemption\u201d). Beau asking Caleb to trust himself. Caleb saying he\u2019s <i>trying</i>\u00a0(like, that is SO HUGE, that is so much bigger a step in moving forward than we\u2019d really seen up to this point). Their hug!! At the end!! Which was only, like 20% awkward. Just!!! God!! More Team Human cuddles immediately, please. And, of course: <i>Hollaaaaa</i></p>",
