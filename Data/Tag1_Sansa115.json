People think that it's the leader of the GC and Sansa, confirming kidnap plot, but it's hard to tell because it's dark and pixelized. While I think the kidnap plot/Cersei vs Sansa confrontation is going to happen, it might be a bit too early for Sansa to be in KL in this trailer and from what I can tell, the person on the right looks a bit too relaxed to be kidnapped.

        "answer": "<p>(Sorry for taking so long to reply to you, anon).\u00a0</p><p>Sansa and Arya have similar journey since Ned\u2019s death. While both are displaced from their home and both desire to go back, they also are must survive the cruelty of their environment using the tools/ the identity that they know how to wear best. While Arya must let got of her nobility, of her femininity, and play the role of a simple\u00a0\u201cnobody,\u201d of a dirty\u00a0\u201cboy,\u201d Sansa accentuated her femaleness and made her Lady appearance her armor.</p><p>For example, this is Arya\u2019s appearance in ACOK:</p><blockquote><p><b>Arya looked down at her ragged clothes and bare feet, all cracked and callused. She saw the dirt uner her nails, the scabs on her elbows, the scratches on her hands.</b> Septa Mordane wouldn\u2019t even know me, I bet. Sansa might, but she\u2019d pretend not to. \u201cMy mother\u2019s a lady, and my sister, but I never was.\u201d - Arya V\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This appearance allowed Arya to blend in, to be among her company, to hide herself from those who chase after her. She becomes a nobody, a\u00a0\u2018no one.\u2019 The thing is, Arya didn\u2019t just suddenly learn how to be\u00a0\u201cnobody.\u201d She has always been like this. Not being lady-like, playing with ordinary folks, associating herself with people below her status. She always has a way to blend in with the commoners, so to speak. It\u2019s her distinctive characteristic. And this characteristic became her advantage, it became her weapon.\u00a0</p><p>In contrast to Sansa,</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>Knowing that Joffrey would require her to attend the tourney in his honor, Sansa had taken special care with her face and clothes. She wore a gown of pale purple sild and moonstone haire net that had been a gift from Joffrey. The gown had long sleeves to hide the bruises of her arms.</b> Those were Joffrey\u2019s gifts as well. When they told him that Robb had been proclaimed the King in the North, his rage had been fearsome thing and had sent Ser Boros to beat her.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>This is Sansa\u2019s asset; it\u2019s her distinctive characteristic.\u00a0I think at this point of the story, Sansa is beginning to realize that in order for her to survive the court drama, she has to be convincing in her role as a docile lady. Not only she knows that this is what\u2019s expected from her, but that there is a certain anonymity in normality, in passivity. If you don\u2019t stand out, if you play the role expected from you, you may be able to find freedom to navigate through the court politics. As Arya finally realizes that shedding any trace of her nobility and femininity is her ticket to survival, Sansa also met a similar reckoning.</p><p>So Sansa plays her role:</p><blockquote><p>The king settled back in his seat and took Sansa\u2019s hand. Once that would have set her heart to pounding but that was before he had answered her plea for mercy by presenting her with her father\u2019s head. <b>His touch filled her with revulsion now, but she knew better than to show it. She made herself sit very still</b>.\u00a0</p><p><b>\u201cMy father was a traitor,\u201d Sansa said at once. \u201cAnd my brother and lady mother are traitors as well.\u201d That reflex she had learned quickly. \u201cI am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.\u201c\u00a0</b><br/></p></blockquote><p>And lest we forget, she is doing this <i>out of her own agency. </i>As she kept repeating:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cCourtesy is a lady\u2019s armor,\u201d Sansa said. Her septa had always told her that. - </b>Sansa III, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>So, at the end of the day, while Arya is being groomed to be assassin, Sansa is also being groomed, or more importantly, is grooming herself to be a spy.\u00a0</p><p>Do I think Sansa will create her own spy network? No. I believe that was not the intention. I think as the tv show indicated, Arya\u2019s particular strength complements Sansa\u2019s own, and together they would be able to root out oppositions amongst their own people (like how they did Baelish). What I\u2019m looking forward to is how this will play out in the books, how they will finally meet each other and realize that they will work wonders as tandem: as the Spy and the Assassin.\u00a0</p>",

And this characteristic became her advantage, it became her weapon.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast to Sansa,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<b>Knowing that Joffrey would require her to attend the tourney in his honor, Sansa had taken special care with her face and clothes. She wore a gown of pale purple sild and moonstone haire net that had been a gift from Joffrey. The gown had long sleeves to hide the bruises of her arms.</b> Those were Joffrey&rsquo;s gifts as well. When they told him that Robb had been proclaimed the King in the North, his rage had been fearsome thing and had sent Ser Boros to beat her.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>This is Sansa&rsquo;s asset; it&rsquo;s her distinctive characteristic.&nbsp;I think at this point of the story, Sansa is beginning to realize that in order for her to survive the court drama, she has to be convincing in her role as a docile lady. Not only she knows that this is what&rsquo;s expected from her, but that there is a certain anonymity in normality, in passivity. If you don&rsquo;t stand out, if you play the role expected from you, you may be able to find freedom to navigate through the court politics. As Arya finally realizes that shedding any trace of her nobility and femininity is her ticket to survival, Sansa also met a similar reckoning.</p><p>So Sansa plays her role:</p><blockquote><p>The king settled back in his seat and took Sansa&rsquo;s hand. Once that would have set her heart to pounding but that was before he had answered her plea for mercy by presenting her with her father&rsquo;s head. <b>His touch filled her with revulsion now, but she knew better than to show it. She made herself sit very still</b>.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&ldquo;My father was a traitor,&rdquo; Sansa said at once. &ldquo;And my brother and lady mother are traitors as well.&rdquo; That reflex she had learned quickly. &ldquo;I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.&ldquo;&nbsp;</b><br /></p></blockquote><p>And lest we forget, she is doing this <i>out of her own agency. </i>As she kept repeating:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;Courtesy is a lady&rsquo;s armor,&rdquo; Sansa said. Her septa had always told her that. - </b>Sansa III, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>So, at the end of the day, while Arya is being groomed to be assassin, Sansa is also being groomed, or more importantly, is grooming herself to be a spy.&nbsp;</p><p>Do I think Sansa will create her own spy network? No. I believe that was not the intention. I think as the tv show indicated, Arya&rsquo;s particular strength complements Sansa&rsquo;s own, and together they would be able to root out oppositions amongst their own people (like how they did Baelish). What I&rsquo;m looking forward to is how this will play out in the books, how they will finally meet each other and realize that they will work wonders as tandem: as the Spy and the Assassin.&nbsp;</p>",
