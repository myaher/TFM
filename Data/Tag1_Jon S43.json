So, first, I\u2019m already a huge fan of Demi Lovato and this song was in my daily Spotify playlist. However, it wasn\u2019t until that I heard it after episode 4, that I realized that this song fits perfectly for how Dany feels about Jon. Now, here me out. Dany hasn\u2019t felt this type of love that Jon is showing her in a long time and it truly hurts her when Jon is hesitant or doesn\u2019t reciprocate those feelings. Now, Jon does love this woman, but he is really conflicted because of what they are to each other (you know the whole incest thing). Literally all Dany wants from Jon is for him to tell her that he loves her, and he really hasn\u2019t (step up your game man). I also think that Dany can see that Jon has the potential to really ground her tendencies and that he is a vital part of who she is (not who she is becoming, let\u2019s get that clear. Not to mention, you didn\u2019t do your job boo, she went cra cra, okay!?). This song, for Dany, is a way of convincing herslef that everything will be okay in the long run and that he will lover no matter what she does (think again, honey). Anyway, my take on this song and why I chose it.

So, first, I\u2019m already a huge fan of Demi Lovato and this song was in my daily Spotify playlist. However, it wasn\u2019t until that I heard it after episode 4, that I realized that this song fits perfectly for how Dany feels about Jon. Now, here me out. Dany hasn\u2019t felt this type of love that Jon is showing her in a long time and it truly hurts her when Jon is hesitant or doesn\u2019t reciprocate those feelings. Now, Jon does love this woman, but he is really conflicted because of what they are to each other (you know the whole incest thing). Literally all Dany wants from Jon is for him to tell her that he loves her, and he really hasn\u2019t (step up your game man). I also think that Dany can see that Jon has the potential to really ground her tendencies and that he is a vital part of who she is (not who she is becoming, let\u2019s get that clear. Not to mention, you didn\u2019t do your job boo, she went cra cra, okay!?). This song, for Dany, is a way of convincing herslef that everything will be okay in the long run and that he will lover no matter what she does (think again, honey). Anyway, my take on this song and why I chose it.

Both of them are literally willing to kill and die for another if they have to,,,and all of THAT its reduced to complete indifference???? Doesnt any of that mean anything???Like all D&amp;D have done so far is remind the audience that their relationship is supposed to be special in interviews once or twice,,,and that\u2019s it. Literally.</p><p>Like I said, I know most people in the fandom dont seem to care about Jon and Arya\u2019s bond or Arya or even Jon to point this out but it\u2019s truly tragic how they swept this meaningful relationship under the rug.</p>",

Half of the Unsullied. Jon did the same, taking a handful of pieces</p><p>\u201cHalf the northmen as well.\u201d</p><p>You only picked up one piece from the eight that stood for your men. They all looked at you quizzically. \u201cAn eighth. I only lost an eighth of my men.\u201d You confirmed, looking at the Lannister lion that was painted, ever so carefully on the wooden piece.</p><!-- more --><p>Varys slapped down a round piece, three white skulls with a gold field.</p><p>\u201cAnd the golden company has arrived in King\u2019s Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet. The balance has grown distressingly even.\u201d</p><p>You nodded to yourself. Lucia had followed you and Jon around the past few weeks. The cuts were healing. The one on her arm would turn into a particularly nasty scar. You had all asked what had happened to her in there, and she only shook her head. But when Tommen had recovered her dragon glass blade from behind the statue where she had dropped it, it became very clear what happened.</p><p>But she sat, content on the edge of the table with her wooden rose, who\u2019s paint had completely chipped off after years of being played with. </p><p>\u201cWhen the people find out what we have done for them, that we saved them-\u201c Missandei was cut off.</p><p>\u201cCersei will make sure they don\u2019t believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Lucia who looked at you horrified. She knew her grandmother\u2019s name. And if Lucia could remember Sansa, she could remember the strong relationship she had with her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cCan we not speak so harshly? A child is here, a child who\u2019s grandmother you are talking about.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys only looked at the child, a small smirk on her face. \u201cEventually, she\u2019ll have to learn the ways of the world.\u201d </p><p>You glared at the silver haired woman, you hated her. For how she looked at Lucia and how she spoke of your family.</p><p>\u201cThe objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King\u2019s Landing.\u201d</p><p>No matter how much you hated King\u2019s Landing, it had been your home. The smelll of ocean water mixed with the awful stench that wafted into the palace from the streets. You\u2019d grown to miss the squeaking door of your chambers. Wait, no. You take that back, that was the most irritating part. Home. Did you even have a home now? A personalized room with plenty of clothing strewn about? Did you have a place you felt safe going out in wearing your favorite dress?</p><p>No, you supposed not. The streets of King\u2019s Landing you knew well. Barristan and your father used to guide you through them every week. Sometimes you were accompanied by Sandor, who kept an eye on your brother, who usually acted like a kind brother in those instances, hooking arms with you and over looking Blackwater Bay while Jaime grabbed a pastry from a local baker. You remembered eating sweet bread or even a small slice of pie while you stood watching the ships. </p><p>You always knew he hated it. But you never did figure out why he followed you out. It was one of your founder memories of the sadistic little shit you called a brother.</p><p>\u201cThankfully, she\u2019s losing allies by the day. Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands in her queen\u2019s name. The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.\u201d Varys said pointing out Dorne and the Iron Islands on the map. As if you couldn\u2019t find them on your own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d Lucia whispered to you. </p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart. I\u2019ll get you fed soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter how many lord turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, She can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>You closed your eyes tightly for a moment. But you felt a small reassuring hand against your balled up fist that was resting on the top of the table. She really was what kept you sane.</p><p>\u201cWe need the capital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N and I watched the people of King\u2019s Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.\u201d</p><p>You knew the common people better than most here. Except for maybe Varys. You both knew them very well. You were in the streets with them before. You spoke with them, bargained. They rebelled not only cause they were hungry, but because Joffrey had started a war. By beheading Ned Stark. That war sent them into starvation. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll surround the city. If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them. If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, We\u2019ll defeat them in the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cannot starve them. I\u2019ve seen it, I will not let it happen again. A riot broke loose because people were hungry. A sept\u2019s arm was torn off that day. People will starve. Mothers, Fathers, Children. I don\u2019t think it will be a wise decision to burn food for the common people.\u201d You replied to Jon. \u201cThey will grow a high distain for you, if you do.\u201d You said to Daenerys. </p><p>You understood the suggestion. You did. But you would not standby as innocents starved because of another war for that damn throne. </p><p>\u201cOnce the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllright.\u201d </p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>You were to go to White Harbor, and sail to Dragonstone with a small force. To gain force against the opposing Lannister troops. Your own, had been given different armor. Northmen armor. So they wouldn\u2019t be confused with the enemy. </p><p>Jon\u2019s journey was a bit more complicated. And your father was to stay here, with everyone else, and watch over Lucia with Sansa. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d </p><p>You smiled slightly at Lucia as she held her rose in her hands, sitting tall on your bed as you packed a few things.</p><p>You were wearing a gold dress, something you hadn\u2019t worn in years. And a crown of sorts, it was down played, but it was of the sort was in your hair. Small, simple waves engraved into the gold. A ring was placed on your right hand ring finger. Your Lannister necklace, shortened into a choker. And you had practically forgotten how it felt to wear earnings. But the antler like earrings hung at your jaw. And the bar in your ear had two small roses placed on the ends.</p><p>You wore a black, leather support corset on the outside of your dress. All to support your stomach which was larger than you expected at this point. And a black vest that went over your shoulder, with a small strap the connected them on each side of your body. </p><p>Lucia now wore blue, with gold embroidery all over. You could make out roses and a few other things. But it ended at her shins and she wore breeches underneath, a deep dark gold to match. Her black coat and silver pelt on her shoulders as she held out another thing for you to pack. </p><p>\u201cI will be back, now, we won\u2019t get into trouble with your aunt or your grandfather will you?\u201d You questioned.</p><p>He shook her head with a smile. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t want to have to knock some sense into you when I get back.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>You kissed him goodbye. A passionate kiss that you didn\u2019t mean to go on for so long. He rested his hands on your stomach for what felt like the millionth time since he found it had grown to accommodate the growing child inside your body.</p><p>\u201cBe safe.\u201d He said to you, a smile on his face. </p><p>\u201cI will, Tommen will be with me. He\u2019ll help protect me.\u201d You joked, looking over to the fourteen year old boy who was already on his horse, holding the reins of your white one tightly as well. </p><p>Jon laughed slightly. \u201cYou\u2019ll protect each other. I know that. And when I see you again, you\u2019ll be even larger.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and kissed his cheek, \u201cWe\u2019ll never be those kids again.\u201d You said to him.</p><p>\u201cNo. We won\u2019t. Back then I wanted to go off and join an ancient organization. You wanted nothing more than to just be. Now, I want nothing more than to marry the woman in front of me and have a dozen more children.\u201d</p><p>You laughed and shook your head. \u201cA dozen won\u2019t happen.\u201d You said to him \u201cI\u2019m standing in the ashes of who I used to be.\u201d You admitted \u201cAfter Ned&hellip; I became a new person.\u201d You said. You wanted to go back to being that girl who could still see the good in people. But after all you\u2019d seen&hellip; You couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Lion, my love. Regal, and you command respect.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head slightly, looking into his deep brown eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever commanded anything in my life that was large. And yet, respect. From my men. From your men. From all the northmen here and the southerners who follow me. From the Reach, the Westerlands. Only a few year ago I was cowering in my room holding a new born baby, who I didn\u2019t know would live to be where she is now. Not with my brother. Once we see each other again at Dragon Stone, we\u2019ll decide something. Wether you will take the crown or you will let Daenerys take it.\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed, looking down. \u201cEveryone\u2019s telling me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours, Jon. It\u2019s been yours since the day you were born. I\u2019m perfectly content with never being a queen. I\u2019m fine with just being a lady of Casterly Rock and High Garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wardeness of the south, Lady Paramount of the Reach and the Westerlands. I would gladly share warden of the North with you.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at him a bit, brushing back a few of the stray hairs that rested around his face. He was always so caring for you. Always offering things to keep you both equal </p><p>\u201cThat would make me in charge of three different kingdoms. Three down, four to go.\u201d You joked to him, he laughed too, but he also gave you that look. A look of deep thought. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head \u201cI\u2019ll tell you in Dragon Stone. We can discuss it there, Go. He looks impatient.\u201d He ushered, looking past you and to the dirty blond haired boy, who sure enough, looked ready to go already. </p><p>You nodded, pulling away and smiling at Jon, going to the large white horse, pulling yourself onto his back. You looked to Jon, a smile on your face as your eyes landed on the sword that was attached to the horse. You tapped the ruby that was in the center \u201cWhat should I name it?\u201d You questioned teasingly. \u2018Widows Wail\u2019 he always was a horrid thing wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it already have a name?\u201d Jon asked as Lucia ran over to his side, tucking herself into his coat. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it. It sounds like a rotten child\u2019s sword.\u201d</p><p>Jon laughed at you, you even got a little snicker from Tommen beside you, Sansa walked after Lucia, a small smile on her face as well. </p><p>\u201cLion\u2019s Blood!\u201d Lucia suggested</p><p>\u201cAntler.\u201d Sansa suggested.</p><p>Jon only shrugged, but the onslaught of Lucia\u2019s became overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cLion\u2019s bite.\u201d Tommen suggested quietly from beside you. </p><p>You turned to see his head down, looking at the back of the horse\u2019s neck. He had mustered up the courage to speak. You\u2019ve seen that look before. The nervous tears biting at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d You responded. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Grace. I shouldn\u2019t be crying.\u201d He said wiping a tear away on the side of his face that you couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cIts okay to cry. It makes you human.\u201d You said before turning to your family, standing there, looking on at you. \u201cLion\u2019s Bite.\u201d You confirmed, nodding again. \u201cNot bad.\u201d You added, blowing a kiss to Lucia as you gently dug your heel into the horse\u2019s side to get going.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"

Half of the Unsullied. Jon did the same, taking a handful of pieces</p><p>\u201cHalf the northmen as well.\u201d</p><p>You only picked up one piece from the eight that stood for your men. They all looked at you quizzically. \u201cAn eighth. I only lost an eighth of my men.\u201d You confirmed, looking at the Lannister lion that was painted, ever so carefully on the wooden piece.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Varys slapped down a round piece, three white skulls with a gold field.</p><p>\u201cAnd the golden company has arrived in King\u2019s Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet. The balance has grown distressingly even.\u201d</p><p>You nodded to yourself. Lucia had followed you and Jon around the past few weeks. The cuts were healing. The one on her arm would turn into a particularly nasty scar. You had all asked what had happened to her in there, and she only shook her head. But when Tommen had recovered her dragon glass blade from behind the statue where she had dropped it, it became very clear what happened.</p><p>But she sat, content on the edge of the table with her wooden rose, who\u2019s paint had completely chipped off after years of being played with. </p><p>\u201cWhen the people find out what we have done for them, that we saved them-\u201c Missandei was cut off.</p><p>\u201cCersei will make sure they don\u2019t believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Lucia who looked at you horrified. She knew her grandmother\u2019s name. And if Lucia could remember Sansa, she could remember the strong relationship she had with her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cCan we not speak so harshly? A child is here, a child who\u2019s grandmother you are talking about.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys only looked at the child, a small smirk on her face. \u201cEventually, she\u2019ll have to learn the ways of the world.\u201d </p><p>You glared at the silver haired woman, you hated her. For how she looked at Lucia and how she spoke of your family.</p><p>\u201cThe objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King\u2019s Landing.\u201d</p><p>No matter how much you hated King\u2019s Landing, it had been your home. The smelll of ocean water mixed with the awful stench that wafted into the palace from the streets. You\u2019d grown to miss the squeaking door of your chambers. Wait, no. You take that back, that was the most irritating part. Home. Did you even have a home now? A personalized room with plenty of clothing strewn about? Did you have a place you felt safe going out in wearing your favorite dress?</p><p>No, you supposed not. The streets of King\u2019s Landing you knew well. Barristan and your father used to guide you through them every week. Sometimes you were accompanied by Sandor, who kept an eye on your brother, who usually acted like a kind brother in those instances, hooking arms with you and over looking Blackwater Bay while Jaime grabbed a pastry from a local baker. You remembered eating sweet bread or even a small slice of pie while you stood watching the ships. </p><p>You always knew he hated it. But you never did figure out why he followed you out. It was one of your founder memories of the sadistic little shit you called a brother.</p><p>\u201cThankfully, she\u2019s losing allies by the day. Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands in her queen\u2019s name. The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.\u201d Varys said pointing out Dorne and the Iron Islands on the map. As if you couldn\u2019t find them on your own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d Lucia whispered to you. </p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart. I\u2019ll get you fed soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter how many lord turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, She can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>You closed your eyes tightly for a moment. But you felt a small reassuring hand against your balled up fist that was resting on the top of the table. She really was what kept you sane.</p><p>\u201cWe need the capital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N and I watched the people of King\u2019s Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.\u201d</p><p>You knew the common people better than most here. Except for maybe Varys. You both knew them very well. You were in the streets with them before. You spoke with them, bargained. They rebelled not only cause they were hungry, but because Joffrey had started a war. By beheading Ned Stark. That war sent them into starvation. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll surround the city. If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them. If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, We\u2019ll defeat them in the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cannot starve them. I\u2019ve seen it, I will not let it happen again. A riot broke loose because people were hungry. A sept\u2019s arm was torn off that day. People will starve. Mothers, Fathers, Children. I don\u2019t think it will be a wise decision to burn food for the common people.\u201d You replied to Jon. \u201cThey will grow a high distain for you, if you do.\u201d You said to Daenerys. </p><p>You understood the suggestion. You did. But you would not standby as innocents starved because of another war for that damn throne. </p><p>\u201cOnce the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllright.\u201d </p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You were to go to White Harbor, and sail to Dragonstone with a small force. To gain force against the opposing Lannister troops. Your own, had been given different armor. Northmen armor. So they wouldn\u2019t be confused with the enemy. </p><p>Jon\u2019s journey was a bit more complicated. And your father was to stay here, with everyone else, and watch over Lucia with Sansa. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d </p><p>You smiled slightly at Lucia as she held her rose in her hands, sitting tall on your bed as you packed a few things.</p><p>You were wearing a gold dress, something you hadn\u2019t worn in years. And a crown of sorts, it was down played, but it was of the sort was in your hair. Small, simple waves engraved into the gold. A ring was placed on your right hand ring finger. Your Lannister necklace, shortened into a choker. And you had practically forgotten how it felt to wear earnings. But the antler like earrings hung at your jaw. And the bar in your ear had two small roses placed on the ends.</p><p>You wore a black, leather support corset on the outside of your dress. All to support your stomach which was larger than you expected at this point. And a black vest that went over your shoulder, with a small strap the connected them on each side of your body. </p><p>Lucia now wore blue, with gold embroidery all over. You could make out roses and a few other things. But it ended at her shins and she wore breeches underneath, a deep dark gold to match. Her black coat and silver pelt on her shoulders as she held out another thing for you to pack. </p><p>\u201cI will be back, now, we won\u2019t get into trouble with your aunt or your grandfather will you?\u201d You questioned.</p><p>He shook her head with a smile. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t want to have to knock some sense into you when I get back.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You kissed him goodbye. A passionate kiss that you didn\u2019t mean to go on for so long. He rested his hands on your stomach for what felt like the millionth time since he found it had grown to accommodate the growing child inside your body.</p><p>\u201cBe safe.\u201d He said to you, a smile on his face. </p><p>\u201cI will, Tommen will be with me. He\u2019ll help protect me.\u201d You joked, looking over to the fourteen year old boy who was already on his horse, holding the reins of your white one tightly as well. </p><p>Jon laughed slightly. \u201cYou\u2019ll protect each other. I know that. And when I see you again, you\u2019ll be even larger.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and kissed his cheek, \u201cWe\u2019ll never be those kids again.\u201d You said to him.</p><p>\u201cNo. We won\u2019t. Back then I wanted to go off and join an ancient organization. You wanted nothing more than to just be. Now, I want nothing more than to marry the woman in front of me and have a dozen more children.\u201d</p><p>You laughed and shook your head. \u201cA dozen won\u2019t happen.\u201d You said to him \u201cI\u2019m standing in the ashes of who I used to be.\u201d You admitted \u201cAfter Ned\u2026 I became a new person.\u201d You said. You wanted to go back to being that girl who could still see the good in people. But after all you\u2019d seen\u2026 You couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Lion, my love. Regal, and you command respect.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head slightly, looking into his deep brown eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever commanded anything in my life that was large. And yet, respect. From my men. From your men. From all the northmen here and the southerners who follow me. From the Reach, the Westerlands. Only a few year ago I was cowering in my room holding a new born baby, who I didn\u2019t know would live to be where she is now. Not with my brother. Once we see each other again at Dragon Stone, we\u2019ll decide something. Wether you will take the crown or you will let Daenerys take it.\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed, looking down. \u201cEveryone\u2019s telling me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours, Jon. It\u2019s been yours since the day you were born. I\u2019m perfectly content with never being a queen. I\u2019m fine with just being a lady of Casterly Rock and High Garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wardeness of the south, Lady Paramount of the Reach and the Westerlands. I would gladly share warden of the North with you.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at him a bit, brushing back a few of the stray hairs that rested around his face. He was always so caring for you. Always offering things to keep you both equal </p><p>\u201cThat would make me in charge of three different kingdoms. Three down, four to go.\u201d You joked to him, he laughed too, but he also gave you that look. A look of deep thought. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head \u201cI\u2019ll tell you in Dragon Stone. We can discuss it there, Go. He looks impatient.\u201d He ushered, looking past you and to the dirty blond haired boy, who sure enough, looked ready to go already. </p><p>You nodded, pulling away and smiling at Jon, going to the large white horse, pulling yourself onto his back. You looked to Jon, a smile on your face as your eyes landed on the sword that was attached to the horse. You tapped the ruby that was in the center \u201cWhat should I name it?\u201d You questioned teasingly. \u2018Widows Wail\u2019 he always was a horrid thing wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it already have a name?\u201d Jon asked as Lucia ran over to his side, tucking herself into his coat. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it. It sounds like a rotten child\u2019s sword.\u201d</p><p>Jon laughed at you, you even got a little snicker from Tommen beside you, Sansa walked after Lucia, a small smile on her face as well. </p><p>\u201cLion\u2019s Blood!\u201d Lucia suggested</p><p>\u201cAntler.\u201d Sansa suggested.</p><p>Jon only shrugged, but the onslaught of Lucia\u2019s became overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cLion\u2019s bite.\u201d Tommen suggested quietly from beside you. </p><p>You turned to see his head down, looking at the back of the horse\u2019s neck. He had mustered up the courage to speak. You\u2019ve seen that look before. The nervous tears biting at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d You responded. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Grace. I shouldn\u2019t be crying.\u201d He said wiping a tear away on the side of his face that you couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cIts okay to cry. It makes you human.\u201d You said before turning to your family, standing there, looking on at you. \u201cLion\u2019s Bite.\u201d You confirmed, nodding again. \u201cNot bad.\u201d You added, blowing a kiss to Lucia as you gently dug your heel into the horse\u2019s side to get going.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"

Half of the Unsullied. Jon did the same, taking a handful of pieces</p><p>\u201cHalf the northmen as well.\u201d</p><p>You only picked up one piece from the eight that stood for your men. They all looked at you quizzically. \u201cAn eighth. I only lost an eighth of my men.\u201d You confirmed, looking at the Lannister lion that was painted, ever so carefully on the wooden piece.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Varys slapped down a round piece, three white skulls with a gold field.</p><p>\u201cAnd the golden company has arrived in King\u2019s Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet. The balance has grown distressingly even.\u201d</p><p>You nodded to yourself. Lucia had followed you and Jon around the past few weeks. The cuts were healing. The one on her arm would turn into a particularly nasty scar. You had all asked what had happened to her in there, and she only shook her head. But when Tommen had recovered her dragon glass blade from behind the statue where she had dropped it, it became very clear what happened.</p><p>But she sat, content on the edge of the table with her wooden rose, who\u2019s paint had completely chipped off after years of being played with. </p><p>\u201cWhen the people find out what we have done for them, that we saved them-\u201c Missandei was cut off.</p><p>\u201cCersei will make sure they don\u2019t believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Lucia who looked at you horrified. She knew her grandmother\u2019s name. And if Lucia could remember Sansa, she could remember the strong relationship she had with her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cCan we not speak so harshly? A child is here, a child who\u2019s grandmother you are talking about.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys only looked at the child, a small smirk on her face. \u201cEventually, she\u2019ll have to learn the ways of the world.\u201d </p><p>You glared at the silver haired woman, you hated her. For how she looked at Lucia and how she spoke of your family.</p><p>\u201cThe objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King\u2019s Landing.\u201d</p><p>No matter how much you hated King\u2019s Landing, it had been your home. The smelll of ocean water mixed with the awful stench that wafted into the palace from the streets. You\u2019d grown to miss the squeaking door of your chambers. Wait, no. You take that back, that was the most irritating part. Home. Did you even have a home now? A personalized room with plenty of clothing strewn about? Did you have a place you felt safe going out in wearing your favorite dress?</p><p>No, you supposed not. The streets of King\u2019s Landing you knew well. Barristan and your father used to guide you through them every week. Sometimes you were accompanied by Sandor, who kept an eye on your brother, who usually acted like a kind brother in those instances, hooking arms with you and over looking Blackwater Bay while Jaime grabbed a pastry from a local baker. You remembered eating sweet bread or even a small slice of pie while you stood watching the ships. </p><p>You always knew he hated it. But you never did figure out why he followed you out. It was one of your founder memories of the sadistic little shit you called a brother.</p><p>\u201cThankfully, she\u2019s losing allies by the day. Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands in her queen\u2019s name. The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.\u201d Varys said pointing out Dorne and the Iron Islands on the map. As if you couldn\u2019t find them on your own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d Lucia whispered to you. </p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart. I\u2019ll get you fed soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter how many lord turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, She can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>You closed your eyes tightly for a moment. But you felt a small reassuring hand against your balled up fist that was resting on the top of the table. She really was what kept you sane.</p><p>\u201cWe need the capital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N and I watched the people of King\u2019s Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.\u201d</p><p>You knew the common people better than most here. Except for maybe Varys. You both knew them very well. You were in the streets with them before. You spoke with them, bargained. They rebelled not only cause they were hungry, but because Joffrey had started a war. By beheading Ned Stark. That war sent them into starvation. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll surround the city. If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them. If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, We\u2019ll defeat them in the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cannot starve them. I\u2019ve seen it, I will not let it happen again. A riot broke loose because people were hungry. A sept\u2019s arm was torn off that day. People will starve. Mothers, Fathers, Children. I don\u2019t think it will be a wise decision to burn food for the common people.\u201d You replied to Jon. \u201cThey will grow a high distain for you, if you do.\u201d You said to Daenerys. </p><p>You understood the suggestion. You did. But you would not standby as innocents starved because of another war for that damn throne. </p><p>\u201cOnce the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllright.\u201d </p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You were to go to White Harbor, and sail to Dragonstone with a small force. To gain force against the opposing Lannister troops. Your own, had been given different armor. Northmen armor. So they wouldn\u2019t be confused with the enemy. </p><p>Jon\u2019s journey was a bit more complicated. And your father was to stay here, with everyone else, and watch over Lucia with Sansa. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d </p><p>You smiled slightly at Lucia as she held her rose in her hands, sitting tall on your bed as you packed a few things.</p><p>You were wearing a gold dress, something you hadn\u2019t worn in years. And a crown of sorts, it was down played, but it was of the sort was in your hair. Small, simple waves engraved into the gold. A ring was placed on your right hand ring finger. Your Lannister necklace, shortened into a choker. And you had practically forgotten how it felt to wear earnings. But the antler like earrings hung at your jaw. And the bar in your ear had two small roses placed on the ends.</p><p>You wore a black, leather support corset on the outside of your dress. All to support your stomach which was larger than you expected at this point. And a black vest that went over your shoulder, with a small strap the connected them on each side of your body. </p><p>Lucia now wore blue, with gold embroidery all over. You could make out roses and a few other things. But it ended at her shins and she wore breeches underneath, a deep dark gold to match. Her black coat and silver pelt on her shoulders as she held out another thing for you to pack. </p><p>\u201cI will be back, now, we won\u2019t get into trouble with your aunt or your grandfather will you?\u201d You questioned.</p><p>He shook her head with a smile. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t want to have to knock some sense into you when I get back.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You kissed him goodbye. A passionate kiss that you didn\u2019t mean to go on for so long. He rested his hands on your stomach for what felt like the millionth time since he found it had grown to accommodate the growing child inside your body.</p><p>\u201cBe safe.\u201d He said to you, a smile on his face. </p><p>\u201cI will, Tommen will be with me. He\u2019ll help protect me.\u201d You joked, looking over to the fourteen year old boy who was already on his horse, holding the reins of your white one tightly as well. </p><p>Jon laughed slightly. \u201cYou\u2019ll protect each other. I know that. And when I see you again, you\u2019ll be even larger.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and kissed his cheek, \u201cWe\u2019ll never be those kids again.\u201d You said to him.</p><p>\u201cNo. We won\u2019t. Back then I wanted to go off and join an ancient organization. You wanted nothing more than to just be. Now, I want nothing more than to marry the woman in front of me and have a dozen more children.\u201d</p><p>You laughed and shook your head. \u201cA dozen won\u2019t happen.\u201d You said to him \u201cI\u2019m standing in the ashes of who I used to be.\u201d You admitted \u201cAfter Ned\u2026 I became a new person.\u201d You said. You wanted to go back to being that girl who could still see the good in people. But after all you\u2019d seen\u2026 You couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Lion, my love. Regal, and you command respect.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head slightly, looking into his deep brown eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever commanded anything in my life that was large. And yet, respect. From my men. From your men. From all the northmen here and the southerners who follow me. From the Reach, the Westerlands. Only a few year ago I was cowering in my room holding a new born baby, who I didn\u2019t know would live to be where she is now. Not with my brother. Once we see each other again at Dragon Stone, we\u2019ll decide something. Wether you will take the crown or you will let Daenerys take it.\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed, looking down. \u201cEveryone\u2019s telling me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours, Jon. It\u2019s been yours since the day you were born. I\u2019m perfectly content with never being a queen. I\u2019m fine with just being a lady of Casterly Rock and High Garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wardeness of the south, Lady Paramount of the Reach and the Westerlands. I would gladly share warden of the North with you.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at him a bit, brushing back a few of the stray hairs that rested around his face. He was always so caring for you. Always offering things to keep you both equal </p><p>\u201cThat would make me in charge of three different kingdoms. Three down, four to go.\u201d You joked to him, he laughed too, but he also gave you that look. A look of deep thought. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head \u201cI\u2019ll tell you in Dragon Stone. We can discuss it there, Go.

Half of the Unsullied. Jon did the same, taking a handful of pieces</p><p>&ldquo;Half the northmen as well.&rdquo;</p><p>You only picked up one piece from the eight that stood for your men. They all looked at you quizzically. &ldquo;An eighth. I only lost an eighth of my men.&rdquo; You confirmed, looking at the Lannister lion that was painted, ever so carefully on the wooden piece.</p><p>Varys slapped down a round piece, three white skulls with a gold field.</p><p>&ldquo;And the golden company has arrived in King&rsquo;s Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet. The balance has grown distressingly even.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded to yourself. Lucia had followed you and Jon around the past few weeks. The cuts were healing. The one on her arm would turn into a particularly nasty scar. You had all asked what had happened to her in there, and she only shook her head. But when Tommen had recovered her dragon glass blade from behind the statue where she had dropped it, it became very clear what happened.</p><p>But she sat, content on the edge of the table with her wooden rose, who&rsquo;s paint had completely chipped off after years of being played with. </p><p>&ldquo;When the people find out what we have done for them, that we saved them-&ldquo; Missandei was cut off.</p><p>&ldquo;Cersei will make sure they don&rsquo;t believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at Lucia who looked at you horrified. She knew her grandmother&rsquo;s name. And if Lucia could remember Sansa, she could remember the strong relationship she had with her grandmother.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we not speak so harshly? A child is here, a child who&rsquo;s grandmother you are talking about.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys only looked at the child, a small smirk on her face. &ldquo;Eventually, she&rsquo;ll have to learn the ways of the world.&rdquo; </p><p>You glared at the silver haired woman, you hated her. For how she looked at Lucia and how she spoke of your family.</p><p>&ldquo;The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King&rsquo;s Landing.&rdquo;</p><p>No matter how much you hated King&rsquo;s Landing, it had been your home. The smelll of ocean water mixed with the awful stench that wafted into the palace from the streets. You&rsquo;d grown to miss the squeaking door of your chambers. Wait, no. You take that back, that was the most irritating part. Home. Did you even have a home now? A personalized room with plenty of clothing strewn about? Did you have a place you felt safe going out in wearing your favorite dress?</p><p>No, you supposed not. The streets of King&rsquo;s Landing you knew well. Barristan and your father used to guide you through them every week. Sometimes you were accompanied by Sandor, who kept an eye on your brother, who usually acted like a kind brother in those instances, hooking arms with you and over looking Blackwater Bay while Jaime grabbed a pastry from a local baker. You remembered eating sweet bread or even a small slice of pie while you stood watching the ships. </p><p>You always knew he hated it. But you never did figure out why he followed you out. It was one of your founder memories of the sadistic little shit you called a brother.</p><p>&ldquo;Thankfully, she&rsquo;s losing allies by the day. Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands in her queen&rsquo;s name. The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.&rdquo; Varys said pointing out Dorne and the Iron Islands on the map. As if you couldn&rsquo;t find them on your own.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo; Lucia whispered to you. </p><p>&ldquo;I know, sweetheart. I&rsquo;ll get you fed soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No matter how many lord turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, She can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.&rdquo;</p><p>You closed your eyes tightly for a moment. But you felt a small reassuring hand against your balled up fist that was resting on the top of the table. She really was what kept you sane.</p><p>&ldquo;We need the capital.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N and I watched the people of King&rsquo;s Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.&rdquo;</p><p>You knew the common people better than most here. Except for maybe Varys. You both knew them very well. You were in the streets with them before. You spoke with them, bargained. They rebelled not only cause they were hungry, but because Joffrey had started a war. By beheading Ned Stark. That war sent them into starvation. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll surround the city. If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them. If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, We&rsquo;ll defeat them in the field.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We cannot starve them. I&rsquo;ve seen it, I will not let it happen again. A riot broke loose because people were hungry. A sept&rsquo;s arm was torn off that day. People will starve. Mothers, Fathers, Children. I don&rsquo;t think it will be a wise decision to burn food for the common people.&rdquo; You replied to Jon. &ldquo;They will grow a high distain for you, if you do.&rdquo; You said to Daenerys. </p><p>You understood the suggestion. You did. But you would not standby as innocents starved because of another war for that damn throne. </p><p>&ldquo;Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Allright.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>You were to go to White Harbor, and sail to Dragonstone with a small force. To gain force against the opposing Lannister troops. Your own, had been given different armor. Northmen armor. So they wouldn&rsquo;t be confused with the enemy. </p><p>Jon&rsquo;s journey was a bit more complicated. And your father was to stay here, with everyone else, and watch over Lucia with Sansa. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to go.&rdquo; </p><p>You smiled slightly at Lucia as she held her rose in her hands, sitting tall on your bed as you packed a few things.</p><p>You were wearing a gold dress, something you hadn&rsquo;t worn in years. And a crown of sorts, it was down played, but it was of the sort was in your hair. Small, simple waves engraved into the gold. A ring was placed on your right hand ring finger. Your Lannister necklace, shortened into a choker. And you had practically forgotten how it felt to wear earnings. But the antler like earrings hung at your jaw. And the bar in your ear had two small roses placed on the ends.</p><p>You wore a black, leather support corset on the outside of your dress. All to support your stomach which was larger than you expected at this point. And a black vest that went over your shoulder, with a small strap the connected them on each side of your body. </p><p>Lucia now wore blue, with gold embroidery all over. You could make out roses and a few other things. But it ended at her shins and she wore breeches underneath, a deep dark gold to match. Her black coat and silver pelt on her shoulders as she held out another thing for you to pack. </p><p>&ldquo;I will be back, now, we won&rsquo;t get into trouble with your aunt or your grandfather will you?&rdquo; You questioned.</p><p>He shook her head with a smile. &ldquo;Good. I don&rsquo;t want to have to knock some sense into you when I get back.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>You kissed him goodbye. A passionate kiss that you didn&rsquo;t mean to go on for so long. He rested his hands on your stomach for what felt like the millionth time since he found it had grown to accommodate the growing child inside your body.</p><p>&ldquo;Be safe.&rdquo; He said to you, a smile on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;I will, Tommen will be with me. He&rsquo;ll help protect me.&rdquo; You joked, looking over to the fourteen year old boy who was already on his horse, holding the reins of your white one tightly as well. </p><p>Jon laughed slightly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll protect each other. I know that. And when I see you again, you&rsquo;ll be even larger.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled and kissed his cheek, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never be those kids again.&rdquo; You said to him.</p><p>&ldquo;No. We won&rsquo;t. Back then I wanted to go off and join an ancient organization. You wanted nothing more than to just be. Now, I want nothing more than to marry the woman in front of me and have a dozen more children.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed and shook your head. &ldquo;A dozen won&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo; You said to him &ldquo;I&rsquo;m standing in the ashes of who I used to be.&rdquo; You admitted &ldquo;After Ned&hellip; I became a new person.&rdquo; You said. You wanted to go back to being that girl who could still see the good in people. But after all you&rsquo;d seen&hellip; You couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Lion, my love. Regal, and you command respect.&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head slightly, looking into his deep brown eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever commanded anything in my life that was large. And yet, respect. From my men. From your men. From all the northmen here and the southerners who follow me. From the Reach, the Westerlands. Only a few year ago I was cowering in my room holding a new born baby, who I didn&rsquo;t know would live to be where she is now. Not with my brother. Once we see each other again at Dragon Stone, we&rsquo;ll decide something. Wether you will take the crown or you will let Daenerys take it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon sighed, looking down. &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s telling me that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours, Jon. It&rsquo;s been yours since the day you were born. I&rsquo;m perfectly content with never being a queen. I&rsquo;m fine with just being a lady of Casterly Rock and High Garden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wardeness of the south, Lady Paramount of the Reach and the Westerlands. I would gladly share warden of the North with you.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled at him a bit, brushing back a few of the stray hairs that rested around his face. He was always so caring for you. Always offering things to keep you both equal </p><p>&ldquo;That would make me in charge of three different kingdoms. Three down, four to go.&rdquo; You joked to him, he laughed too, but he also gave you that look. A look of deep thought. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you in Dragon Stone. We can discuss it there, Go. He looks impatient.&rdquo; He ushered, looking past you and to the dirty blond haired boy, who sure enough, looked ready to go already. </p><p>You nodded, pulling away and smiling at Jon, going to the large white horse, pulling yourself onto his back. You looked to Jon, a smile on your face as your eyes landed on the sword that was attached to the horse. You tapped the ruby that was in the center &ldquo;What should I name it?&rdquo; You questioned teasingly. &lsquo;Widows Wail&rsquo; he always was a horrid thing wasn&rsquo;t he?</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it already have a name?&rdquo; Jon asked as Lucia ran over to his side, tucking herself into his coat. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. It sounds like a rotten child&rsquo;s sword.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon laughed at you, you even got a little snicker from Tommen beside you, Sansa walked after Lucia, a small smile on her face as well. </p><p>&ldquo;Lion&rsquo;s Blood!&rdquo; Lucia suggested</p><p>&ldquo;Antler.&rdquo; Sansa suggested.</p><p>Jon only shrugged, but the onslaught of Lucia&rsquo;s became overwhelming.</p><p>&ldquo;Lion&rsquo;s bite.&rdquo; Tommen suggested quietly from beside you. </p><p>You turned to see his head down, looking at the back of the horse&rsquo;s neck. He had mustered up the courage to speak. You&rsquo;ve seen that look before. The nervous tears biting at his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I like it.&rdquo; You responded. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Your Grace. I shouldn&rsquo;t be crying.&rdquo; He said wiping a tear away on the side of his face that you couldn&rsquo;t see.</p><p>&ldquo;Its okay to cry. It makes you human.&rdquo; You said before turning to your family, standing there, looking on at you. &ldquo;Lion&rsquo;s Bite.&rdquo; You confirmed, nodding again. &ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo; You added, blowing a kiss to Lucia as you gently dug your heel into the horse&rsquo;s side to get going.</p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\"
