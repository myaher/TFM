I imagine you will discover it for yourself, soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wanda was confused.</p><p>\u201cYour powers have a very similar energy signature to my own.

And, the idea of flying was quite appealing. Pietro had said that being at speed felt almost like flying. She supposed it had, though that she had only experienced second-hand, and not fully.

Up.</p><p>Wait a minute. She was getting rather high now. Very, very high. And Wanda had let herself get so excited about her new ability that she hadn\u2019t thought too much about getting down again.</p><p>Wanda panicked, and panicking meant losing focus. The energy driving her upward climb faded, and Wanda felt herself plummet downwards.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Whether it was due to their currently co-habitating, the connection of the Mind Stone to her abilities, or some other reason altogether, Vision had found himself becoming very in-tune with the emotions of Wanda Maximoff.</p><p>Her joy felt like sunshine, bursting through the dark clouds of her brother\u2019s death. But when that joy turned so suddenly to blind panic, Vision felt it too. He dropped the dish he had been washing, following Wanda\u2019s feelings, needing to stop whatever was making her so afraid. He hovered above The Avengers compound, his eyes frantically searching. A tiny figure was plummeting, screaming.</p><p>Vision zoomed upward.</p><p>Wanda tumbled toward Earth.

A well balanced diet is one of the best ways to help keep your body healthy. The food pyramid will help you find the balance.\u201d</i></p><!-- more --><p>Peter sat in the bleachers, staring opened mouthed at the TV screen. Captain America, the Captain America, had filmed \u2018life lessons\u2019 for his high school gym class. The Captain that saved him from Doctor Doom. The Steve Rogers that helped him with his history homework. The Steve that can\u2019t operate his smartphone without asking one of the other Avengers for help.</p><p><i>The other Avengers. Do they know? </i>Peter thought. He pulled out his phone while his teacher was busy looking at his clipboard and started recording. He couldn\u2019t wait to see Mr. Stark after school today.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>As soon as the final bell rang, Peter raced out of the building. He rushed to the Jaguar parked outside his school, nearly slamming into the side of the car in his excitement. When he opened the door, Peter started talking immediately.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, Mr. Stark, you\u2019re not going to believe what happened in gym class today. We were shown this video-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in the front seat?\u201d</p><p>Peter turned to see Happy sitting in the driver\u2019s seat instead of Mr. Stark.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark usually lets me sit in the front seat. But anyways, there\u2019s this video of Mr. Rogers and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the backseat, kid.\u201d Peter climbs into the backseat and starts talking again. Happy rolls up the partition and begins driving.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\tWhen Peter arrived at the Avengers Compound he went straight to Mr. Stark\u2019s lab. He burst in through the door, threw his backpack onto his workbench and rushed over to Mr. Stark.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, first of all, what did I tell you about throwing your backpack around in the lab? Second, why are you-?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI know, I know, but this is important.\u201d Peter said as he fumbled for his phone.</p><p>\t\u201cMore important than lab safety protocol?\u201d Tony asked. Peter said nothing as he handed his phone to Tony and watched his face as the video played.</p><p>\tTony\u2019s eyes widened while a smile grew from ear to ear. He looked at Peter and said, \u201cThis day just went from good to great.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWell, it\u2019s about to get better.\u201d Peter said. After a dramatic pause he whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cKid, I\u2019m gonna need those files.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes gleamed, borderline manic. \u201cThe compound is about to educated by our lovely Cap.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\tThe next morning was a rare occasion when everyone was awake early enough to see Peter off to school. The only person missing was the kid himself. At five minutes before Peter would normally leave, he came running through the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI am so gunna be late,\u201d Peter said as he grabbed a piece of bread and shoved it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo no breakfast today?\u201d Nat asked. Peter shook his head as he made for the door. Tony saw his chance and took it.</p><p>\u201cWait, Peter!\u201d Tony called out. Peter stopped before the elevator and looked at Tony. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave without a lunch. You know,\u201d he paused, looked at Cap then said, \u201cA hot lunch is key to a well balanced diet and a healthy body.\u201d</p><p>Clint snorted into his coffee and Peter struggled to keep the smile off his face as he ran out the door. </p><p>Bruce turned away from the fridge, carton in hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were the healthy type, Tony.\u201d</p><p>Clint clapped the doctor on the shoulder, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got something you need to see.\u201d </p><p>Steve\u2019s face was still frozen in a mask of confusion as he turned away from where Peter disappeared. He turned to Tony, glare already in place but he was met with Stark\u2019s poor attempt at a face of innocence.</p><p>\u201cTony, you know you can\u2019t hide when you\u2019re doing something you shouldn\u2019t be doing,\u201d Steve said.</p><p>\tBefore Tony could reply the alarm sounded to assemble.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\tThey were called to an explosion at a warehouse that turned out to be one of Hyrda\u2019s bases.

Nat and Clint were watching a movie about ninjas. Tony was helping Peter practice for the decathlon. Wanda was helping Vision improve his cooking skills. Steve was catching up on his reading with Harry Potter.</p><p>\u201cAlright, kid, break time. Go grab us some chips and dip,\u201d Tony said. He looked over at Cap at just the right moment and saw him scratch his head. Tony was about to say something when Vision spoke up from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Captain. Don\u2019t be afraid,\u201d Everyone looked at Vision in confusion before he continued, \u201cStand up, keep your head held high, and be a hero.\u201d</p><p>Wanda dropped the jar of spice she held in her hand as she fell to the floor laughing. Steve slammed his book shut as he stood to face the room.</p><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough. Someone tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d Steve demanded angrily.</p><p>Thor walked into the room as he heard Cap shout. He walked over to his friend, clapped him on the shoulder and said in a serious tone, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Steve. Your body is going through some changes so your hormones will be out of sorts. It\u2019s okay to feel angry sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Peter wheezed next to Wanda on the floor, chips and dip forgotten. Clint shoved his face into the couch cushions and Natasha hid her smile behind her fist. Tony sat at the table with the biggest smile on his face and got up to hug Vision, who returned it with some confusion.</p><p>Steve brushed off Thor\u2019s hand and glared at each person in the room before stomping down the hallway.</p><p>Clint emerged from the cushions, \u201cDid you see his face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knew our Captain could get that angry,\u201d Tony replied as he went to pick up the chips from the floor.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>\tThe next day everyone was in the war room waiting to be briefed on their next long term assignments. The Avengers could feel the tension in the air as Steve pouted in his chair and refused to make eye contact with anyone.</p><p>\tNatasha, Bruce and Tony stood next to the coffee machine in the corner of the room. They watched as Cap leafed through the briefing packet. Each flick of the page slightly more forceful than the last.</p><p>\t\u201cAs fun as teasing Steve is, we should probably lay off for a few days,\u201d Natasha whispered to them.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not happening,\u201d Tony said as he sipped his coffee.</p><p>\t\u201cCome on, Tony, Cap is really angry,\u201d Bruce whispered.</p><p>\tTony looked at Bruce and sighed. \u201cFine, we\u2019ll give Capsicle a break.\u201d</p><p>\tNick Fury walked into the room followed by another agent. He went to the head of the table and said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get this started. This is Agent Rovelle who will be partnered with some of you on your individual missions.\u201d</p><p>\tSteve gave Fury a concerned look as he said, \u201cHopefully you mean she won\u2019t be out in the field since she is,\u201d he paused as he continued quietly, \u201cPregnant.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be operating strictly from within the compound,\u201d the agent replied. Steve gave an approving nod.</p><p>\t\u201cSteve, I\u2019m not so cruel as to make one of my own agent\u2019s go out into the field while she is,\u201d Fury paused as he looked Steve in the eye with his own before he continued. \u201cStill in the process of human reproduction activities.\u201d</p><p>\tTony\u2019s jaw dropped and he flung himself back with laughter. Clint snickered and Natasha slapped upside the back of his head. Bruce coughed to cover his laugh. Wanda was curled into Vision as she giggled. Rhodey and Sam smirked at each other. Peter\u2019s face was bright red as he remembered the exact video they were referencing from his health class. Bucky tried to fight the smile as he glanced at Steve.</p><p>\tSteve\u2019s mouth hung open and he quickly snapped it shut. He glared at Fury and swept his gaze around the room. \u201cUntil one of you steps up and tells me what the hell is going on, I will not be a part of any of these assignments.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhy, Mr. Rogers,\u201d Tony said with feigned shock, \u201cDo you kiss your mother with that mouth? Such language.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>\tThe group stood in Tony\u2019s workshop going over the new weapons that he just upgraded. Natasha twirled her new knives around her fingers as Clint adjusted his bow. Sam just put on his new pack when Steve walked in. Tony looked up from the holoscreen and smirked. </p><p>\u201cHey, Cap, I got your new armor right here,\u201d Tony gestured. Steve patted Sam on the shoulder and walked over to Tony.</p><p>He shrugged it on and wondered at the weightlessness of the armor. Rhodey watched from the couch and caught Tony\u2019s eye. \u201cYou know, from one soldier to another, Rogers,\u201d Rhodey started, \u201cYou know what the most important weapon is that we can have?\u201d</p><p>Steve looked up with eager eyes. Bucky sat down next to Rhodey and answered, \u201cMath.\u201d</p><p>\tTony let the holoscreen fall from his hand to the table as he bent forward and cackled. Steve glared at Tony as he shucked off the new armor and dropped it to the floor. As he walked out of the room he shouted over his shoulder. \u201cLet me know when you all want to stop behaving like the three-year-olds that you are.\u201d</p><p>\tThe glass door slid closed and not a beat later, Bruce didn\u2019t even look up from the files he was reading. \u201cBut you know what\u2019s better?\u201d He paused. \u201cReading.\u201d</p><p>\tBucky and Rhody nearly slid off the couch as their laughter rose in pitch.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>\tThe Avengers were gathered in the common room after a rough mission.

He turned to look at him to find he was already staring at him with a wide smile on his face. Before Sam had a chance to deliver his joke, Steve stood up in front of the TV with his arms crossed and said, \u201cFriday, mute the TV.\u201d He glared at the Avengers.</p><p>\tThe rest of them started to shout and talk over each other for Steve to sit back down. Peter fidgeted on the couch and stood up. \u201cUh, Mr. Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\tEveryone stopped talking as they watched the kid shuffled back and forth on his feet. Steve raised his eyebrow at him and waited for him to continue.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, so, um, you know how everyone has been, uh, laughing at\u2026\u201d Peter looked up at Steve then back at his feet. He took a big breath and said all at once, \u201cWell, it\u2019s because, I showed Mr. Stark the videos of you that you made for school.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHuh?\u201d Steve said.</p><p>\t\u201cYou know, those educational videos?\u201d Peter said, hesitantly.</p><p>\t\u201cEducational-\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI can show the Captain what you are talking about, Mr. Parker,\u201d Friday said. The TV behind Steve lit up with red, white and blue colors as a band fanfare played over the speakers.

Captain America, the Captain America, had filmed \u2018life lessons\u2019 for his high school gym class. The Captain that saved him from Doctor Doom. The Steve Rogers that helped him with his history homework. The Steve that can\u2019t operate his smartphone without asking one of the other Avengers for help.</p><p><i>The other Avengers. Do they know? </i>Peter thought. He pulled out his phone while his teacher was busy looking at his clipboard and started recording. He couldn\u2019t wait to see Mr. Stark after school today.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>As soon as the final bell rang, Peter raced out of the building. He rushed to the Jaguar parked outside his school, nearly slamming into the side of the car in his excitement. When he opened the door, Peter started talking immediately.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, Mr. Stark, you\u2019re not going to believe what happened in gym class today. We were shown this video-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in the front seat?\u201d</p><p>Peter turned to see Happy sitting in the driver\u2019s seat instead of Mr. Stark.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark usually lets me sit in the front seat. But anyways, there\u2019s this video of Mr. Rogers and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the backseat, kid.\u201d Peter climbs into the backseat and starts talking again. Happy rolls up the partition and begins driving.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\tWhen Peter arrived at the Avengers Compound he went straight to Mr. Stark\u2019s lab. He burst in through the door, threw his backpack onto his workbench and rushed over to Mr. Stark.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, first of all, what did I tell you about throwing your backpack around in the lab? Second, why are you-?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI know, I know, but this is important.\u201d Peter said as he fumbled for his phone.</p><p>\t\u201cMore important than lab safety protocol?\u201d Tony asked. Peter said nothing as he handed his phone to Tony and watched his face as the video played.</p><p>\tTony\u2019s eyes widened while a smile grew from ear to ear. He looked at Peter and said, \u201cThis day just went from good to great.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWell, it\u2019s about to get better.\u201d Peter said. After a dramatic pause he whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cKid, I\u2019m gonna need those files.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes gleamed, borderline manic. \u201cThe compound is about to educated by our lovely Cap.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\tThe next morning was a rare occasion when everyone was awake early enough to see Peter off to school. The only person missing was the kid himself. At five minutes before Peter would normally leave, he came running through the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI am so gunna be late,\u201d Peter said as he grabbed a piece of bread and shoved it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo no breakfast today?\u201d Nat asked. Peter shook his head as he made for the door. Tony saw his chance and took it.</p><p>\u201cWait, Peter!\u201d Tony called out. Peter stopped before the elevator and looked at Tony. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave without a lunch. You know,\u201d he paused, looked at Cap then said, \u201cA hot lunch is key to a well balanced diet and a healthy body.\u201d</p><p>Clint snorted into his coffee and Peter struggled to keep the smile off his face as he ran out the door. </p><p>Bruce turned away from the fridge, carton in hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were the healthy type, Tony.\u201d</p><p>Clint clapped the doctor on the shoulder, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got something you need to see.\u201d </p><p>Steve\u2019s face was still frozen in a mask of confusion as he turned away from where Peter disappeared. He turned to Tony, glare already in place but he was met with Stark\u2019s poor attempt at a face of innocence.</p><p>\u201cTony, you know you can\u2019t hide when you\u2019re doing something you shouldn\u2019t be doing,\u201d Steve said.</p><p>\tBefore Tony could reply the alarm sounded to assemble.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\tThey were called to an explosion at a warehouse that turned out to be one of Hyrda\u2019s bases.

Captain America, the Captain America, had filmed \u2018life lessons\u2019 for his high school gym class. The Captain that saved him from Doctor Doom. The Steve Rogers that helped him with his history homework. The Steve that can\u2019t operate his smartphone without asking one of the other Avengers for help.</p><p><i>The other Avengers. Do they know? </i>Peter thought. He pulled out his phone while his teacher was busy looking at his clipboard and started recording.

He rushed to the Jaguar parked outside his school, nearly slamming into the side of the car in his excitement. When he opened the door, Peter started talking immediately.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, Mr. Stark, you\u2019re not going to believe what happened in gym class today. We were shown this video-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in the front seat?\u201d</p><p>Peter turned to see Happy sitting in the driver\u2019s seat instead of Mr. Stark.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark usually lets me sit in the front seat. But anyways, there\u2019s this video of Mr. Rogers and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the backseat, kid.\u201d Peter climbs into the backseat and starts talking again.

He burst in through the door, threw his backpack onto his workbench and rushed over to Mr. Stark.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, first of all, what did I tell you about throwing your backpack around in the lab? Second, why are you-?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI know, I know, but this is important.\u201d Peter said as he fumbled for his phone.</p><p>\t\u201cMore important than lab safety protocol?\u201d Tony asked. Peter said nothing as he handed his phone to Tony and watched his face as the video played.</p><p>\tTony\u2019s eyes widened while a smile grew from ear to ear. He looked at Peter and said, \u201cThis day just went from good to great.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWell, it\u2019s about to get better.\u201d Peter said. After a dramatic pause he whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cKid, I\u2019m gonna need those files.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes gleamed, borderline manic. \u201cThe compound is about to educated by our lovely Cap.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\tThe next morning was a rare occasion when everyone was awake early enough to see Peter off to school.

At five minutes before Peter would normally leave, he came running through the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI am so gunna be late,\u201d Peter said as he grabbed a piece of bread and shoved it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo no breakfast today?\u201d Nat asked. Peter shook his head as he made for the door. Tony saw his chance and took it.</p><p>\u201cWait, Peter!\u201d Tony called out. Peter stopped before the elevator and looked at Tony. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave without a lunch. You know,\u201d he paused, looked at Cap then said, \u201cA hot lunch is key to a well balanced diet and a healthy body.\u201d</p><p>Clint snorted into his coffee and Peter struggled to keep the smile off his face as he ran out the door. </p><p>Bruce turned away from the fridge, carton in hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were the healthy type, Tony.\u201d</p><p>Clint clapped the doctor on the shoulder, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got something you need to see.\u201d </p><p>Steve\u2019s face was still frozen in a mask of confusion as he turned away from where Peter disappeared. He turned to Tony, glare already in place but he was met with Stark\u2019s poor attempt at a face of innocence.</p><p>\u201cTony, you know you can\u2019t hide when you\u2019re doing something you shouldn\u2019t be doing,\u201d Steve said.</p><p>\tBefore Tony could reply the alarm sounded to assemble.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\tThey were called to an explosion at a warehouse that turned out to be one of Hyrda\u2019s bases.

Nat and Clint were watching a movie about ninjas. Tony was helping Peter practice for the decathlon. Wanda was helping Vision improve his cooking skills. Steve was catching up on his reading with Harry Potter.</p><p>\u201cAlright, kid, break time. Go grab us some chips and dip,\u201d Tony said. He looked over at Cap at just the right moment and saw him scratch his head. Tony was about to say something when Vision spoke up from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Captain. Don\u2019t be afraid,\u201d Everyone looked at Vision in confusion before he continued, \u201cStand up, keep your head held high, and be a hero.\u201d</p><p>Wanda dropped the jar of spice she held in her hand as she fell to the floor laughing. Steve slammed his book shut as he stood to face the room.</p><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough. Someone tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d Steve demanded angrily.</p><p>Thor walked into the room as he heard Cap shout. He walked over to his friend, clapped him on the shoulder and said in a serious tone, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Steve. Your body is going through some changes so your hormones will be out of sorts. It\u2019s okay to feel angry sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Peter wheezed next to Wanda on the floor, chips and dip forgotten. Clint shoved his face into the couch cushions and Natasha hid her smile behind her fist. Tony sat at the table with the biggest smile on his face and got up to hug Vision, who returned it with some confusion.</p><p>Steve brushed off Thor\u2019s hand and glared at each person in the room before stomping down the hallway.</p><p>Clint emerged from the cushions, \u201cDid you see his face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knew our Captain could get that angry,\u201d Tony replied as he went to pick up the chips from the floor.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>\tThe next day everyone was in the war room waiting to be briefed on their next long term assignments. The Avengers could feel the tension in the air as Steve pouted in his chair and refused to make eye contact with anyone.</p><p>\tNatasha, Bruce and Tony stood next to the coffee machine in the corner of the room. They watched as Cap leafed through the briefing packet. Each flick of the page slightly more forceful than the last.</p><p>\t\u201cAs fun as teasing Steve is, we should probably lay off for a few days,\u201d Natasha whispered to them.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not happening,\u201d Tony said as he sipped his coffee.</p><p>\t\u201cCome on, Tony, Cap is really angry,\u201d Bruce whispered.</p><p>\tTony looked at Bruce and sighed. \u201cFine, we\u2019ll give Capsicle a break.\u201d</p><p>\tNick Fury walked into the room followed by another agent. He went to the head of the table and said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get this started. This is Agent Rovelle who will be partnered with some of you on your individual missions.\u201d</p><p>\tSteve gave Fury a concerned look as he said, \u201cHopefully you mean she won\u2019t be out in the field since she is,\u201d he paused as he continued quietly, \u201cPregnant.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be operating strictly from within the compound,\u201d the agent replied. Steve gave an approving nod.</p><p>\t\u201cSteve, I\u2019m not so cruel as to make one of my own agent\u2019s go out into the field while she is,\u201d Fury paused as he looked Steve in the eye with his own before he continued. \u201cStill in the process of human reproduction activities.\u201d</p><p>\tTony\u2019s jaw dropped and he flung himself back with laughter. Clint snickered and Natasha slapped upside the back of his head. Bruce coughed to cover his laugh. Wanda was curled into Vision as she giggled. Rhodey and Sam smirked at each other. Peter\u2019s face was bright red as he remembered the exact video they were referencing from his health class. Bucky tried to fight the smile as he glanced at Steve.</p><p>\tSteve\u2019s mouth hung open and he quickly snapped it shut. He glared at Fury and swept his gaze around the room. \u201cUntil one of you steps up and tells me what the hell is going on, I will not be a part of any of these assignments.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhy, Mr. Rogers,\u201d Tony said with feigned shock, \u201cDo you kiss your mother with that mouth? Such language.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>\tThe group stood in Tony\u2019s workshop going over the new weapons that he just upgraded. Natasha twirled her new knives around her fingers as Clint adjusted his bow. Sam just put on his new pack when Steve walked in. Tony looked up from the holoscreen and smirked. </p><p>\u201cHey, Cap, I got your new armor right here,\u201d Tony gestured. Steve patted Sam on the shoulder and walked over to Tony.</p><p>He shrugged it on and wondered at the weightlessness of the armor. Rhodey watched from the couch and caught Tony\u2019s eye. \u201cYou know, from one soldier to another, Rogers,\u201d Rhodey started, \u201cYou know what the most important weapon is that we can have?\u201d</p><p>Steve looked up with eager eyes. Bucky sat down next to Rhodey and answered, \u201cMath.\u201d</p><p>\tTony let the holoscreen fall from his hand to the table as he bent forward and cackled. Steve glared at Tony as he shucked off the new armor and dropped it to the floor. As he walked out of the room he shouted over his shoulder. \u201cLet me know when you all want to stop behaving like the three-year-olds that you are.\u201d</p><p>\tThe glass door slid closed and not a beat later, Bruce didn\u2019t even look up from the files he was reading. \u201cBut you know what\u2019s better?\u201d He paused. \u201cReading.\u201d</p><p>\tBucky and Rhody nearly slid off the couch as their laughter rose in pitch.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\tThe Avengers were gathered in the common room after a rough mission. Everyone sat scattered across the couches and floor with some bad spy movie playing. The hero was just about to head into his enemy\u2019s lair when he turned to his sidekick and said, \u201cThis just might be the toughest enemy we\u2019ve ever had to face\u2026\u201d</p><p>\tSteve heard Sam snicker beside him. He turned to look at him to find he was already staring at him with a wide smile on his face. Before Sam had a chance to deliver his joke, Steve stood up in front of the TV with his arms crossed and said, \u201cFriday, mute the TV.\u201d He glared at the Avengers.</p><p>\tThe rest of them started to shout and talk over each other for Steve to sit back down. Peter fidgeted on the couch and stood up. \u201cUh, Mr. Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\tEveryone stopped talking as they watched the kid shuffled back and forth on his feet. Steve raised his eyebrow at him and waited for him to continue.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, so, um, you know how everyone has been, uh, laughing at\u2026\u201d Peter looked up at Steve then back at his feet. He took a big breath and said all at once, \u201cWell, it\u2019s because, I showed Mr. Stark the videos of you that you made for school.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHuh?\u201d Steve said.</p><p>\t\u201cYou know, those educational videos?\u201d Peter said, hesitantly.</p><p>\t\u201cEducational-\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI can show the Captain what you are talking about, Mr. Parker,\u201d Friday said. The TV behind Steve lit up with red, white and blue colors as a band fanfare played over the speakers. Peter stared wide eyed at the screen as Steve slowly turned around to watch the screen.</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be injected with a super secret government serum to have strong muscles and bones. A well balanced diet is one of the best ways to-\u201d</p><p>\tSteve walked out of the room as the rest of the Avengers devolved into manic laughter.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\tEveryone was seated eating breakfast. Tony poured Bruce another cup of coffee when Steve came strolling in after his morning run, Sam not far behind him. The two sat down at the table. Clint shoved some plates of food towards them and reached for the box of Poptarts Thor hugged to his chest. The god offered one up and just before Clint took a bite, Bucky piped up from sink, \u201cWatch out for that tooth decay.\u201d</p><p>Snickers and giggles rippled through the kitchen. Steve set his head down on the table and groaned.</p>",

He glared at Fury and swept his gaze around the room. &ldquo;Until one of you steps up and tells me what the hell is going on, I will not be a part of any of these assignments.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Why, Mr. Rogers,&rdquo; Tony said with feigned shock, &ldquo;Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Such language.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>\tThe group stood in Tony&rsquo;s workshop going over the new weapons that he just upgraded. Natasha twirled her new knives around her fingers as Clint adjusted his bow. Sam just put on his new pack when Steve walked in. Tony looked up from the holoscreen and smirked. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Cap, I got your new armor right here,&rdquo; Tony gestured. Steve patted Sam on the shoulder and walked over to Tony.</p><p>He shrugged it on and wondered at the weightlessness of the armor. Rhodey watched from the couch and caught Tony&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;You know, from one soldier to another, Rogers,&rdquo; Rhodey started, &ldquo;You know what the most important weapon is that we can have?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve looked up with eager eyes. Bucky sat down next to Rhodey and answered, &ldquo;Math.&rdquo;</p><p>\tTony let the holoscreen fall from his hand to the table as he bent forward and cackled. Steve glared at Tony as he shucked off the new armor and dropped it to the floor. As he walked out of the room he shouted over his shoulder. &ldquo;Let me know when you all want to stop behaving like the three-year-olds that you are.&rdquo;</p><p>\tThe glass door slid closed and not a beat later, Bruce didn&rsquo;t even look up from the files he was reading. &ldquo;But you know what&rsquo;s better?&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;Reading.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBucky and Rhody nearly slid off the couch as their laughter rose in pitch.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>\tThe Avengers were gathered in the common room after a rough mission. Everyone sat scattered across the couches and floor with some bad spy movie playing. The hero was just about to head into his enemy&rsquo;s lair when he turned to his sidekick and said, &ldquo;This just might be the toughest enemy we&rsquo;ve ever had to face&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\tSteve heard Sam snicker beside him. He turned to look at him to find he was already staring at him with a wide smile on his face. Before Sam had a chance to deliver his joke, Steve stood up in front of the TV with his arms crossed and said, &ldquo;Friday, mute the TV.&rdquo; He glared at the Avengers.</p><p>\tThe rest of them started to shout and talk over each other for Steve to sit back down. Peter fidgeted on the couch and stood up. &ldquo;Uh, Mr. Rogers.&rdquo;</p><p>\tEveryone stopped talking as they watched the kid shuffled back and forth on his feet. Steve raised his eyebrow at him and waited for him to continue.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay, so, um, you know how everyone has been, uh, laughing at&hellip;&rdquo; Peter looked up at Steve then back at his feet. He took a big breath and said all at once, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s because, I showed Mr. Stark the videos of you that you made for school.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Steve said.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You know, those educational videos?&rdquo; Peter said, hesitantly.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Educational-&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I can show the Captain what you are talking about, Mr. Parker,&rdquo; Friday said. The TV behind Steve lit up with red, white and blue colors as a band fanfare played over the speakers. Peter stared wide eyed at the screen as Steve slowly turned around to watch the screen.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be injected with a super secret government serum to have strong muscles and bones. A well balanced diet is one of the best ways to-&rdquo;</p><p>\tSteve walked out of the room as the rest of the Avengers devolved into manic laughter.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>\tEveryone was seated eating breakfast. Tony poured Bruce another cup of coffee when Steve came strolling in after his morning run, Sam not far behind him. The two sat down at the table. Clint shoved some plates of food towards them and reached for the box of Poptarts Thor hugged to his chest. The god offered one up and just before Clint took a bite, Bucky piped up from sink, &ldquo;Watch out for that tooth decay.&rdquo;</p><p>Snickers and giggles rippled through the kitchen. Steve set his head down on the table and groaned.</p>",
