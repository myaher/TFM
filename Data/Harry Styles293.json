This chapter is a bit shorter than the rest, and so is Chapter Nine, so if you all show me the love today with this chapter, I promise to post the next chapter later today. Thank you for reading and much love to you all! xo</b></i></p><p><i><b>Shelli</b></i></p><p><i>*******************************</i></p><p>You couldn\u2019t believe your grand opening was finally happening!</p><p>After all of the months of work, and all of the shit you had gone through to get there, it was finally time to open your business to the public. Your paintings and creations were placed around the entire building, as art aficionados and those in the business walked around, taking it all in while enjoying a flute of champagne.</p><p>Harry looked to where you were standing in front of one of your pieces, discussing it with another artist. He was so proud of you, documenting it for you as he took photos of the event. He planned to advertise your business on his social media soon, but not wanting to create a frenzy at the grand opening, he chose to wait until after everyone left, wanting a photo of the two of you in front of one of your creations.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAre you having a good time, love?\u201d Harry smiled as he placed his arm around your waist.</p><p>\u201cSuch a great time!\u201d you beamed, more happy than you could remember being in a long time. \u201cA lot of people showed up, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been ass to ass in here since we opened the door!\u201d Harry laughed as you smiled and giggled. \u201cThere are people all over the pavement outside and cars congested in the street. It\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>You smiled, accepting his kiss to your cheek, then walked away with someone who had a question. Harry watched around the building, speaking with those he knew, always training his eye to follow where you were. As he glanced toward the door, Harry felt his stomach drop, as he noticed Michael, making his way to where you were in the next room.</p><p>Harry quickly walked through a different doorway, seeing where you were, and barging his way through the crowd of people, barely getting to you before Michael did. You felt \u00a0a quick grab of your arm, spinning you slightly, as you looked at Harry questioningly.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d you asked, seeing the look on his face, then hearing what he was looking at and turning.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get my invitation to your grand opening, sweetheart,\u201d Michael said with a smile. \u201cYou promised me an invitation the day we met and you bought this building from me.\u201d</p><p>Your heart sped, feeling as if it were in your throat, looking around at the hundreds of guests unaware of the imminent scene that could easily happen.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t welcome here,\u201d Harry told Michael quietly, trying not to bring attention, as Harry signaled to the security he had waiting nearby. Michael turned and saw the large men in black clothing coming closer to where they were.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m not here to cause trouble,\u201d Michael said with earnest inflection. \u201cI only wanted to come congratulate you for all of your hard work and dedication. This is amazing, sweetheart!\u201d</p><p>Michael felt the hands of the guards on his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI\u2019ll go. I\u2019m not one for large crowds anyway. I just wanted you to know I am supporting you in this, and I wish you nothing but the best.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t acknowledge anything he said to you, merely looked down facing Harry, as he slipped his arm around you, leading you away from where Michael and the guards were walking away. Guiding you into a small area in the back, Harry cupped his hand around your jaw, feeling you trembling slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, love?\u201d he asked quietly in case there were others around who could hear. He saw you nod your head then look up at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m okay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, you accepted the long hug from your best friend. The comfort you felt when Harry held you was like no other sense of security and gentleness you had known. It made you wish you could stay in his arms all the time, missing what you once had with him. Pulling slowly away from him, you grinned lovingly to him, feeling Harry tenderly kiss your face, then felt his hand take yours as he led you back into the party. You smiled at people as you greeted them once again, discussing your art, with Harry not leaving your side the remainder of the event.</p><p>As the opening dwindled, with only a few people still looking around, Harry saw how ready you appeared for some relaxation. Following the last few people to the door, he thanked them and locked the door behind them. Walking back to where you stood in the next room, looking around at everything, Harry smiled at you, handing you a fresh flute of champagne and clinking your glass.</p><p>\u201cTo the birth of an amazing art gallery,\u201d Harry said. \u201cMay it be everything you want it to be, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you smiled, sipping from the glass.</p><p>\u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d Harry grinned, taking your hand and walking you to the workshop in the back of the building. As you stepped through the doorway, you saw a blanket spread across the floor, food adorning it, as Harry walked you toward it. \u201cI think today was a huge success. So we are going to celebrate with an amazing dinner I had sent from our favorite restaurant and strategically had sneaked through the backdoor. The doors are all locked and it\u2019s only us. No one else I would rather be with at this moment than you.\u201d</p><p>You felt Harry lean to you, a sweet kiss placed lightly on your lips, he holding your hand as you sat on the large blanket. As you watched Harry pull the food out, you debated in your mind over something you had been thinking about, feeling it was now the right time to share it with him.</p><p>\u201cMay I tell you something?\u201d you asked, as he glanced to you with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou can always tell me anything, you know that,\u201d he said sweetly, glancing over the food then to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to tell you this for a while,\u201d you said slowly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I should. But now\u2026I know I want to, regardless of what you think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be fine,\u201d Harry chuckled and smiled. \u201cTell me, go on now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in the hospital,\u201d you started. \u201cWhen I had the panic attack and fainted and you took me, and I was so sick\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Harry said, looking at you tenderly.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream,\u201d you spoke. \u201cI know I wasn\u2019t really in my head most of the time. It was very strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAt least we know why now.\u201d</p><p>You nodded then continued.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream,\u201d you repeated, Harry listening closely as you told your thoughts. \u201cIn the dream\u2026you told me\u2026you were still in love with me. That you never stopped loving me after we broke up.\u201d</p><p>You watched as his smile fell into a concentrated look.</p><p>\u201cYou said that you wished I wasn\u2019t with Michael,\u201d you continued, thinking. \u201cThat you wished the two of us were together again, like before. I didn\u2019t want to tell you, because I didn\u2019t want to make you feel uncomfortable about it, especially since I was still dating Michael. But\u2026with everything I\u2019ve been dealing with, and most recently beginning to realize\u2026my life could be at risk now\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry swallowed hard at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI decided,\u201d you said, looking at him intensely. \u201cI decided I want to be honest with you about my feelings, whether you feel the same or not. I hate the thought of something happening to me and you never knowing how I truly feel about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about something happening to you, babe,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine now. You\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you nodded, smiling softly to him. \u201cAnd I thank you for that.\u201d</p><p>You looked at him another moment and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI know it was only a dream,\u201d you said. \u201cBut\u2026I never\u2026fell out of love with you. I started dating Michael, hoping it would help me to get over you. I think that\u2019s why I could never let myself get close to him. I do still love you, as more than just best friends, and I want you to know that, in case something would happen to me. I know you\u2019ve moved on, and\u2026that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just so thankful we\u2019re still best friends.\u201d</p><p>Seeing the uncertainty in your eyes, wondering how he would react to what you had admitted, Harry moved closely to you and held your hand in his.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIn the hospital, you didn\u2019t dream it. I really said it to you, love. You hadn\u2019t woken yet, but I couldn\u2019t keep my secret from you anymore. I had to tell you, even if you couldn\u2019t hear me, or\u2026at least, I thought you couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want you to hate me because I said it and you were still with Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never hate you, Harry\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am still so in love with you, baby,\u201d Harry said, as his eyes began to glisten. \u201cI\u2019ve never fallen out of love with you. I just wanted to respect your relationship you were in. I\u2019ve never stopped loving you.\u201d</p><p>Seeing a tear slowly slide down your cheek, Harry leaned closely to you, holding your face in his hand, pressing his lips gently to yours, tasting you once again after such a long time away from that level of intimacy with you. Pulling away slightly again, Harry looked at you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so in love with you, baby,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Kissing you passionately, Harry held you, wanting to keep you in his arms forever. Leaning away from you slightly, Harry kept you in his hold, as you both looked into each other\u2019s tear-filled eyes. No words needed spoken. You both knew. Everything was finally going to be as it should be again.</p><p>Harry\u2019s mouth on your neck was even more comforting than you remembered it feeling, as he left soft kisses along your jaw, leaning you backward on the blanket, he looking down over you as a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he whispered, kissing you softly again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you\u2026so much,\u201d you returned, leaning up to nibble at his jaw, as you sucked a gentle kiss to his neck, hearing him groan softly.</p><p>Feeling his hand move from your waist, slowly down your hip, his mouth searching yours again, he grasped your thigh in his wide-spread fingers, pulling your leg up to rest on his thigh. A kiss never felt so good, Harry moaning as your hand moved over the front of his trousers, caressing him firmly through the fabric. His nibbles tugging at your bottom lip revealed the craving he had for you, begging for another kiss. His arms pulling tightly around your body, Harry clutched onto you as if he was afraid of you slipping away and never feeling that again with you.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m never letting you go again,\u201d Harry sputtered in an excited whisper, as he slid his hand back up your body, it disappearing inside your dress as it clutched your breast. Pulling his head back, the look on Harry\u2019s face said everything the two of you were feeling in that moment. It was the same look you remembered seeing when you were together. The look of complete love and adoration, of two hearts and souls knowing they were with their soulmate once again. It was a feeling which went beyond explanation, but not needing explained, both of you feeling it.</p><p>The two of you became lost in a muddle of strewn clothing, eager groans, and wet kisses. The feel of his erect dick and heavy sac pressing against your pelvic bone caused a tingling to shoot through your body at the anticipation of what was happening between you, a feeling you had wondered if you would ever experience with Harry again. You closed your eyes at the feel of his tongue flicking against your nipple as he turned it into a hard pebble between his lips. As the heat of his breath traveled to your other eager nipple, his hand stealthily slid between your legs, a groan releasing from his throat as he felt the wet heat, his fingers sliding slowly back and forth along your lips, his fingertips becoming wet with your juices.</p><p>Harry lightly touched the tip of his tongue against your hard nipple again as he looked to your face. Your eyes were focused on him, lips parted slightly as you felt one of his fingers slide inside of you, your moan failing to be suppressed. \u00a0Harry\u2019s heavy breath scattered kisses across your chest, a passionate bite to your collarbone, as another finger slid into you. His breathing coming in quicker spurts along with yours, your body was ready to explode, wanting Harry inside of you. Holding your hands on either side of his face, you gently pulled him to kiss you once again. Your kisses were more desperate, the passion growing inside each of you.</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d you whispered. \u201cPlease\u2026I need you\u2026need to feel you again\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry moved quickly between your thighs, guiding his cock to align with your center, the smooth skin of his tip sliding along your wet lips, coating it perfectly as he parted them. His eyes looked intensely into yours, attempting to convince himself that this wasn\u2019t just another of his many dreams of being with you again, that it truly was happening.</p><p>You kissed his lips as you watched each other, feeling him slide slowly inside of you, your feet wrapping around him as he drove himself as deeply into you as possible, both of you moaning at the amazing feeling. For a brief moment, Harry held himself deeply inside of you, not moving, as the two of you kissed passionately, a mumbled \u2018fuck\u2019 slipping from his lips at how wonderful the feeling of being inside of you again was. </p><p>Harry slowly began thrusting, kissing you tenderly, as his hands roamed you. You felt his face bury into your neck as you heard another moan from his throat.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d he whispered, his mind floating from the immense pleasure he hadn\u2019t felt with you in so long. He was full and thick inside of you and he knew he was, your tightness nearly sending his mind into a state of euphoria he could only experience with you. \u201cFuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>His mouth sloppily stumbling to find yours, his mind being lost in his elation, he kissed you desperately once again, gentle nibbles, licks, and kisses left on skin, both of you whispering sentiments of love and sinful promises in your long-awaited reunion of needy bodies and intimate thoughts.</p><p>\u201cFuck, kitten,\u201d Harry panted heavily as you sucked a delightfully painful love bite to his neck, his hand fisting a large handful of your hair backward as you released him, his mouth quickly finding yours, battering your lips into swollen, raspberry-tinted pillows.</p><p>Pulling one of his arms behind your head as a pillow, his other arm quickly pulled your thigh higher on his hip, allowing him to rut deeper into you still as he picked up his pace, his breathing becoming more ragged and loud.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2026\u201d you panted, begging him to not hold back, his position shifting just right, causing you to gasp as he drove deeply into you. Harry felt your walls, hot and slick, allowing him to slide in and out of you easily. His tongue dove between your lips, eager to taste every part of you it hadn\u2019t tasted in so long. Harry\u2019s name rushed from your throat as you panted near his ear. His dick began to pulse against your tightening walls, groaning lightly at how wonderful it felt.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI love you so much. Always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you panted faster, your eyes beginning to flutter as you squeezed them shut, a deep breath taken in as your body was completely at Harry\u2019s mercy. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry felt you clamping around him like a vice, your back arching away from the blanket-covered floor as he hit just the right spot to make you quake in spasms underneath him. You moaned loudly as you orgasmed, your body clutching around him as he pumped his seed deeply into you\u2026thick, heavy ribbons shooting into your core. He released a loud groan against your face, kissing your cheek as he tried to remember to breath, stars popping in his vision as he squeezed his eyes closed tightly, releasing his load inside of you, a slight ache in his jaw from clenching it so tightly. </p><p>Both of you panting against each other\u2019s skin, still feeling the spasms continue sporadically in both of you, you felt Harry place kisses randomly around your face and neck and chest. Breathing slowly becoming controlled again, Harry kissed your face, holding the other side of it firmly so that you couldn\u2019t pull away from the love he needed to show you.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I was afraid of never feeling that with you again,\u201d Harry spoke quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted that for so long, ever since I left on tour, when we spent our last night together.\u201d Harry looked at your face, slowly tracing your lips with his thumb. \u201cI\u2019m never, never letting you go again. Never. We\u2019ll make it work with our careers. I promise.\u201d</p><p>The two of you took pleasure in becoming intimately reacquainted on the blanket-covered stone floor in the workshop of your gallery. Food long forgotten and champagne unknowingly spilled nearby, nothing else in the world mattered. You and Harry had found your way back to each other. No matter what happened past that point, you would get through everything\u2026together. </p><p>Eventually redressing as Harry requested taking your lovemaking reunion back to his home to continue, you quickly cleaned the mess around the area. Walking out into the bit of sunlight that was just beginning to rise, Harry joked that the two of you had just christened the proverbial ship of your building, laughing as you went back to Harry\u2019s house, holding to those sinful promises from before.</p><p>*</p><p>Harry woke, smiling as he remembered the hours before, making love with you as you reunited as lovers. Looking to the side of his bed you were still sleeping in, Harry turned over to face you, wrapping his arms around you and pulling you flush against his body, flowering kisses across your back and shoulders. Hearing you breath in more deeply, he felt you turn in his arms and face him, opening your eyes and smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he grinned to you as you smiled. \u201cEven first thing of a morning, so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid I would wake and find this had all been a dream,\u201d you grinned honestly. \u201cI\u2019m so happy it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever letting you go again, baby,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve been thinking about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Harry grinned to you, kissing you lightly and readjusting his arm around you.</p><p>\u201cHad things gone differently,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we hadn\u2019t split up, or\u2026you had come with me on tour maybe\u2026had things been different in our careers\u2026I would have asked you by now to live with me.\u201d</p><p>Harry watched as you processed what he was saying, seeing your lips form a smile as he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019ve only gotten back together now, but,\u201d Harry started. \u201cI\u2019d like\u2026for you to live with me, move into my home. No more apartment. I want you here, with me. I would have asked you had we stayed together, and especially now with all that\u2019s happened\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026want me to live with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than fucking anything, babe,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI was going to ask you anyway, as best friends and with the security issues. But especially now that we\u2019re together again. I want it more than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>You saw the watering in his eyes as he smiled and chuckled at your smiling silence.</p><p>\u201cI want you here with me, all the time,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI want to be able to come home to you after work. I want your clothes hanging in the closet next to mine, mixed together in the laundry with mine. And your toothbrush with mine at the sink, your things next to mine in the shower or on the dresser. I want us to share\u2026everything.\u201d</p><p>Harry saw a tear fall from your eye to the pillow under your face, as you laughed gently.</p><p>\u201cI want everything with you,\u201d Harry said. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d</p><p>Unable to speak in your happiness, you released a giggling sob, nodding your head, wrapping your arms around him as he laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be amazing, baby,\u201d Harry smiled. \u201cAbsolutely amazing.\u201d</p><p>* </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last one,\u201d Harry said, as he brought a box in from the other room. You looked around the tiny apartment as he walked to you, holding his arms around your shoulders from behind and kissing the side of your face. \u201cAre you going to miss living here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d you laughed. \u201cFuck, no.\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed as you smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the first time you stayed the night here with me?\u201d you asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cThat little matchbox of a bed you had then,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cMy fuckin\u2019 legs hung over the end by nearly a foot!\u201d</p><p>You both laughed, looking around the little room.</p><p>\u201cNot like we slept or anything that night,\u201d you teased.</p><p>\u201cFuck right we didn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Harry said, kissing your neck, nibbling at your earlobe. \u201cFor two full fucking days\u2026\u201d</p><p>You turned to face him, as he kissed you deeply, then left three or four smaller kisses gently to your lips with a smile.</p><p>\u201cCome on, love,\u201d Harry said. \u201cOne last time before we go?\u201d</p><p>You giggled as Harry grabbed your hand, laughing all the way into the bedroom. In time, the moving van arrived and you and Harry packed everything inside of it, taking your things back to Harry\u2019s home\u2026your new home with Harry. You were beyond happy.</p><p>*</p><p>For weeks you hadn\u2019t heard anything out of Michael and you hoped he was done harassing you. You obviously hadn\u2019t told him you moved from the apartment, but believing that your intruder was most likely him, his key would no longer work so you assumed he would figure it out eventually.</p><p>As you stepped out of the passenger side of the vehicle, Harry quickly made his way around the car, standing next to you and grabbing your hand as he walked you to the front door of the gallery. Your business was doing very well, you and Harry were beyond happy together, and you felt like you were finally almost yourself again. You still worked with Dr. Glen, but felt healthy again, even though you still knew your mind was a work in progress.</p><p>\u201cEverything looks good here,\u201d Harry said, handing you your coffee cup. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to get to my meeting, then I\u2019m going to do some writing this afternoon. You have anything on your agenda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a ten o\u2019clock sculpting class,\u201d you grinned. \u201cThen I\u2019m hoping this afternoon I can work in the workshop for a while since Katie seems to be working out really well in here with the daily stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she seems nice,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAll right, love, I\u2019m going to get on then. Call if you need me. Nothing major for me today anyway. I\u2019ll bring us lunch in later before I go off to write, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds wonderful,\u201d you said, accepting his kiss and long hug. \u201cThat feels so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond good,\u201d he said, holding you a moment longer. \u201cI\u2019ll be here around one?\u201d</p><p><br/>\nYou nodded and smiled as he kissed you quickly again, then hearing the front door and seeing Katie walk inside.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d Harry said to her then turned again. \u201cSee you in a few hours, baby. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>Thankful. That\u2019s all you could say about your life finally becoming calm and more normal again. You were thankful to Dr. Glen for helping you work through the pieces of your mind that Michael had twisted into a knot of confusion and disorientation. You were forever thankful to Harry for staying by your side, being the perfect definition of what a best friend should really be. And you were thankful that Michael appeared to have finally given up on you and was leaving you alone. The restraining order Harry acquired to protect you may have helped with that, too, but still, you were thankful Michael was abiding by it. You didn\u2019t know where Michael had gone or what he was doing, and you didn\u2019t care, as long as he continued to stay far away from you and Harry. </p><p>You still struggled with thoughts in your mind about Michael. Thoughts that you worked on in every session with Dr. Glen. You understood now that Michael had said and done many things with the intent of manipulating you. But it was still difficult for you to see the depth of his deceit sometimes. You thought he must either be an amazing actor, or maybe some of his feelings for you were sincere. Although you knew you never loved him, you really had liked him as a person until things become too much. But\u2026he did do things to you that proved it was not a healthy relationship, things that had put a fear in you toward him, and Dr. Glen and Harry both worked with you to help you see those things more clearly, helping you to find yourself again. Retraining your mind\u2026that\u2019s what you were doing with their help, and you were extremely thankful Michael had apparently removed himself from the situation all together.</p><p>Having taught your only class scheduled that day, you cleaned the area again, then prepared your mind for the tasks of your afternoon. It was exciting to have been commissioned for a piece of art by another London gallery, known for showcasing other local artists. It was a badge of acceptance in your eyes that you were asked, and you wanted to make sure it was a perfect example of your work.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I leave a few minutes early for lunch? I have a lunch date,\u201d Katie smiled.</p><p>\u201cMmmm, same guy?\u201d you giggled.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she grinned. \u201cSeems to be a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d you smiled. \u201cGo ahead, it\u2019s fine. Harry should be here any minute with lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cSee you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>You turned back around and looked through a couple of drawers, trying to find the tools you would need for the commission work you would begin on that afternoon. Hearing the door open, you hollered into the gallery.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the workshop, Harry!\u201d</p><p>You heard the footsteps walking through the gallery, across the stone floors, then walking behind you.</p><p>\u201cJust in time,\u201d you said, pushing the drawer closed again. \u201cKatie just left for lunch, too.\u201d</p><p>Hearing only footsteps, you turned as your smile dropped from your face, seeing Michael continuing his path toward you. Out of instinct you reached to the counter next to you, grabbing the sharp carving blade in your hand and holding it straight out in front of you, causing Michael to stop in his steps a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart,\u201d Michael smiled gently. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen you. I just came to see how you\u2019re doing, see how the gallery is doing.\u201d</p><p>You saw how badly you were shaking, barely seeming a threat, but you knew the knife in your hand was sharp enough to leave a deep slice in anything it touched.</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave,\u201d you stated firmly. \u201cI have security cameras everywhere, recording you being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m doing nothing wrong. I\u2019m not hurting you. You\u2019re the only one who\u2019s threatening right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you too well,\u201d you spoke. \u201cNow leave, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI came here to see you, and I\u2019m going to. Now stop with this and put that away.\u201d</p><p>He began to step closer as you shakily held the blade closer to him, he retracting his step back again.</p><p>\u201cI have a restraining order on you,\u201d you announced. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking the law by being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry you felt you needed one against me,\u201d he saddened. \u201cI would never intentionally hurt you, sweetheart. This has all become such a mess. There\u2019s so much you don\u2019t know. I just want time to explain everything to you, so you don\u2019t hate me. I know you live with Harry now, I\u2019ve seen you together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life is none of your business,\u201d you spoke more sternly, your eyes burning from the tears you were holding back, perspiration beginning to form on your brow and upper lip from your fear. </p><p>\u201cOh, my love\u2026your life will always be my business,\u201d he swooned. \u201cI know you\u2019re in love with Harry, probably always have been. It explains a lot, honestly. But that doesn\u2019t change how I feel about you. I love you, probably too much, and I know if you would just give me a chance, you could love me, too. But even if you\u2019re with Harry, I\u2019ll always be around somewhere. That\u2019s how much I love you. You may not see me, or hear me, or even know I\u2019m there, but I will be, have to be\u2026just like in your apartment. I was always there. Even the nights Harry was there with you.\u201d</p><p>You panted in your growing fear, holding the sharp chisel high at his throat-level, but not backing down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you thrown in jail,\u201d you said more loudly as your voice wavered slightly. \u201cI know everything you did to me when we were dating. All of the mind tricks you played on me, making me think I was losing my mind. What kind of a person does that?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI can explain all of that, I swear. It wasn\u2019t my fault, I had to. You just don\u2019t understand. It wasn\u2019t\u2026me\u2026I mean, it was, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was you!\u201d you yelled shakily.</p><p>Harry heard your voice as he walked into the gallery, hearing the fear and strain in it, as he quietly closed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cIt was you! I know everything that you\u2019ve done to me!\u201d you cried, your arm shaking terribly toward him, nearly nicking him with the sharp cutting edge.</p><p>Harry quietly stepped through the gallery toward the workshop, peeking inside the doorway and seeing you holding the knife out in front of you, shaking terribly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never hurt you,\u201d Michael said calmly. \u201cEven the day you broke your arm. It wasn\u2019t\u2026I mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026you were here?\u201d you questioned, Harry seeing the look of confusion slowly overcoming your face, but keeping the knife toward Michael.</p><p>\u201cI just need to explain\u2026tell you everything,\u201d Michael said, seeing you slowly letting down your guard. \u201cI never wanted you to get hurt\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d you said, shaking your head and holding the tool high. \u201cI remember now. You <i>were</i> here. You\u2026you tried to force me to leave with you. But I\u2026I fought you\u2026and\u2026threatened to yell to anyone who could hear that you were kidnapping me\u2026\u201d</p><p>You gasped as you suddenly saw Harry attack Michael from behind.</p><p>\u201cYou stay the fuck away from her!\u201d Harry yelled, as the two men fought.</p><p>Losing the shock of what you were seeing, you reached for the silent alarm button under the cabinet ledge and backed into the corner. You saw Michael kick at Harry, trying to separate himself from him, pulling on the leg of a nearby stool and toppling it onto Harry. Feeling the release of Harry\u2019s hands on him, Michael ran for the door.</p><p>Harry quickly got to his feet, running to the doorway but seeing Michael had already disappeared out the front door of the building. Looking back to where you were standing, white as a ghost and still shaking, Harry ran to you. Pulling you into his arms, kissing your face over and over, he held you tightly.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right? Did he hurt you?\u201d Harry asked, looking over your body for signs of blood or trauma.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d you said, clutching him tightly. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolice!\u201d you both heard from the other room.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in here!\u201d Harry shouted back, as you saw them walk into the room.</p><p>You and Harry described everything that happened, Harry requesting enforcement of the restraining order. Deciding there had been enough excitement for the day, Harry called Katie, giving her the rest of the day off, feeling it best he should take you home. He walked to where you were, sitting down next to you and pulling your hand into his, kissing it.</p><p>\u201cI remembered,\u201d you said quietly, as he looked to you, knowing you were pleased. Something that had happened to you made sense, and you had remembered what had happened.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry grinned lightly. \u201cYou did well, baby.\u201d</p>",

This chapter is a bit shorter than the rest, and so is Chapter Nine, so if you all show me the love today with this chapter, I promise to post the next chapter later today. Thank you for reading and much love to you all! xo</b></i></p><p><i><b>Shelli</b></i></p><p><i>*******************************</i></p><p>You couldn\u2019t believe your grand opening was finally happening!</p><p>After all of the months of work, and all of the shit you had gone through to get there, it was finally time to open your business to the public. Your paintings and creations were placed around the entire building, as art aficionados and those in the business walked around, taking it all in while enjoying a flute of champagne.</p><p>Harry looked to where you were standing in front of one of your pieces, discussing it with another artist. He was so proud of you, documenting it for you as he took photos of the event. He planned to advertise your business on his social media soon, but not wanting to create a frenzy at the grand opening, he chose to wait until after everyone left, wanting a photo of the two of you in front of one of your creations.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cAre you having a good time, love?\u201d Harry smiled as he placed his arm around your waist.</p><p>\u201cSuch a great time!\u201d you beamed, more happy than you could remember being in a long time. \u201cA lot of people showed up, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been ass to ass in here since we opened the door!\u201d Harry laughed as you smiled and giggled. \u201cThere are people all over the pavement outside and cars congested in the street. It\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>You smiled, accepting his kiss to your cheek, then walked away with someone who had a question. Harry watched around the building, speaking with those he knew, always training his eye to follow where you were. As he glanced toward the door, Harry felt his stomach drop, as he noticed Michael, making his way to where you were in the next room.</p><p>Harry quickly walked through a different doorway, seeing where you were, and barging his way through the crowd of people, barely getting to you before Michael did. You felt \u00a0a quick grab of your arm, spinning you slightly, as you looked at Harry questioningly.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d you asked, seeing the look on his face, then hearing what he was looking at and turning.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get my invitation to your grand opening, sweetheart,\u201d Michael said with a smile. \u201cYou promised me an invitation the day we met and you bought this building from me.\u201d</p><p>Your heart sped, feeling as if it were in your throat, looking around at the hundreds of guests unaware of the imminent scene that could easily happen.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t welcome here,\u201d Harry told Michael quietly, trying not to bring attention, as Harry signaled to the security he had waiting nearby. Michael turned and saw the large men in black clothing coming closer to where they were.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m not here to cause trouble,\u201d Michael said with earnest inflection. \u201cI only wanted to come congratulate you for all of your hard work and dedication. This is amazing, sweetheart!\u201d</p><p>Michael felt the hands of the guards on his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI\u2019ll go. I\u2019m not one for large crowds anyway. I just wanted you to know I am supporting you in this, and I wish you nothing but the best.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t acknowledge anything he said to you, merely looked down facing Harry, as he slipped his arm around you, leading you away from where Michael and the guards were walking away. Guiding you into a small area in the back, Harry cupped his hand around your jaw, feeling you trembling slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, love?\u201d he asked quietly in case there were others around who could hear. He saw you nod your head then look up at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m okay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, you accepted the long hug from your best friend. The comfort you felt when Harry held you was like no other sense of security and gentleness you had known. It made you wish you could stay in his arms all the time, missing what you once had with him. Pulling slowly away from him, you grinned lovingly to him, feeling Harry tenderly kiss your face, then felt his hand take yours as he led you back into the party. You smiled at people as you greeted them once again, discussing your art, with Harry not leaving your side the remainder of the event.</p><p>As the opening dwindled, with only a few people still looking around, Harry saw how ready you appeared for some relaxation. Following the last few people to the door, he thanked them and locked the door behind them. Walking back to where you stood in the next room, looking around at everything, Harry smiled at you, handing you a fresh flute of champagne and clinking your glass.</p><p>\u201cTo the birth of an amazing art gallery,\u201d Harry said. \u201cMay it be everything you want it to be, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you smiled, sipping from the glass.</p><p>\u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d Harry grinned, taking your hand and walking you to the workshop in the back of the building. As you stepped through the doorway, you saw a blanket spread across the floor, food adorning it, as Harry walked you toward it. \u201cI think today was a huge success. So we are going to celebrate with an amazing dinner I had sent from our favorite restaurant and strategically had sneaked through the backdoor. The doors are all locked and it\u2019s only us. No one else I would rather be with at this moment than you.\u201d</p><p>You felt Harry lean to you, a sweet kiss placed lightly on your lips, he holding your hand as you sat on the large blanket. As you watched Harry pull the food out, you debated in your mind over something you had been thinking about, feeling it was now the right time to share it with him.</p><p>\u201cMay I tell you something?\u201d you asked, as he glanced to you with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou can always tell me anything, you know that,\u201d he said sweetly, glancing over the food then to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to tell you this for a while,\u201d you said slowly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I should. But now\u2026I know I want to, regardless of what you think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be fine,\u201d Harry chuckled and smiled. \u201cTell me, go on now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in the hospital,\u201d you started. \u201cWhen I had the panic attack and fainted and you took me, and I was so sick\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Harry said, looking at you tenderly.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream,\u201d you spoke. \u201cI know I wasn\u2019t really in my head most of the time. It was very strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAt least we know why now.\u201d</p><p>You nodded then continued.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream,\u201d you repeated, Harry listening closely as you told your thoughts. \u201cIn the dream\u2026you told me\u2026you were still in love with me. That you never stopped loving me after we broke up.\u201d</p><p>You watched as his smile fell into a concentrated look.</p><p>\u201cYou said that you wished I wasn\u2019t with Michael,\u201d you continued, thinking. \u201cThat you wished the two of us were together again, like before. I didn\u2019t want to tell you, because I didn\u2019t want to make you feel uncomfortable about it, especially since I was still dating Michael. But\u2026with everything I\u2019ve been dealing with, and most recently beginning to realize\u2026my life could be at risk now\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry swallowed hard at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI decided,\u201d you said, looking at him intensely. \u201cI decided I want to be honest with you about my feelings, whether you feel the same or not. I hate the thought of something happening to me and you never knowing how I truly feel about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about something happening to you, babe,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine now. You\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you nodded, smiling softly to him. \u201cAnd I thank you for that.\u201d</p><p>You looked at him another moment and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI know it was only a dream,\u201d you said. \u201cBut\u2026I never\u2026fell out of love with you. I started dating Michael, hoping it would help me to get over you. I think that\u2019s why I could never let myself get close to him. I do still love you, as more than just best friends, and I want you to know that, in case something would happen to me. I know you\u2019ve moved on, and\u2026that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just so thankful we\u2019re still best friends.\u201d</p><p>Seeing the uncertainty in your eyes, wondering how he would react to what you had admitted, Harry moved closely to you and held your hand in his.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIn the hospital, you didn\u2019t dream it. I really said it to you, love. You hadn\u2019t woken yet, but I couldn\u2019t keep my secret from you anymore. I had to tell you, even if you couldn\u2019t hear me, or\u2026at least, I thought you couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want you to hate me because I said it and you were still with Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never hate you, Harry\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am still so in love with you, baby,\u201d Harry said, as his eyes began to glisten. \u201cI\u2019ve never fallen out of love with you. I just wanted to respect your relationship you were in. I\u2019ve never stopped loving you.\u201d</p><p>Seeing a tear slowly slide down your cheek, Harry leaned closely to you, holding your face in his hand, pressing his lips gently to yours, tasting you once again after such a long time away from that level of intimacy with you. Pulling away slightly again, Harry looked at you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so in love with you, baby,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Kissing you passionately, Harry held you, wanting to keep you in his arms forever. Leaning away from you slightly, Harry kept you in his hold, as you both looked into each other\u2019s tear-filled eyes. No words needed spoken. You both knew. Everything was finally going to be as it should be again.</p><p>Harry\u2019s mouth on your neck was even more comforting than you remembered it feeling, as he left soft kisses along your jaw, leaning you backward on the blanket, he looking down over you as a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he whispered, kissing you softly again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you\u2026so much,\u201d you returned, leaning up to nibble at his jaw, as you sucked a gentle kiss to his neck, hearing him groan softly.</p><p>Feeling his hand move from your waist, slowly down your hip, his mouth searching yours again, he grasped your thigh in his wide-spread fingers, pulling your leg up to rest on his thigh. A kiss never felt so good, Harry moaning as your hand moved over the front of his trousers, caressing him firmly through the fabric. His nibbles tugging at your bottom lip revealed the craving he had for you, begging for another kiss. His arms pulling tightly around your body, Harry clutched onto you as if he was afraid of you slipping away and never feeling that again with you.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m never letting you go again,\u201d Harry sputtered in an excited whisper, as he slid his hand back up your body, it disappearing inside your dress as it clutched your breast. Pulling his head back, the look on Harry\u2019s face said everything the two of you were feeling in that moment. It was the same look you remembered seeing when you were together. The look of complete love and adoration, of two hearts and souls knowing they were with their soulmate once again. It was a feeling which went beyond explanation, but not needing explained, both of you feeling it.</p><p>The two of you became lost in a muddle of strewn clothing, eager groans, and wet kisses. The feel of his erect dick and heavy sac pressing against your pelvic bone caused a tingling to shoot through your body at the anticipation of what was happening between you, a feeling you had wondered if you would ever experience with Harry again. You closed your eyes at the feel of his tongue flicking against your nipple as he turned it into a hard pebble between his lips. As the heat of his breath traveled to your other eager nipple, his hand stealthily slid between your legs, a groan releasing from his throat as he felt the wet heat, his fingers sliding slowly back and forth along your lips, his fingertips becoming wet with your juices.</p><p>Harry lightly touched the tip of his tongue against your hard nipple again as he looked to your face. Your eyes were focused on him, lips parted slightly as you felt one of his fingers slide inside of you, your moan failing to be suppressed. \u00a0Harry\u2019s heavy breath scattered kisses across your chest, a passionate bite to your collarbone, as another finger slid into you. His breathing coming in quicker spurts along with yours, your body was ready to explode, wanting Harry inside of you. Holding your hands on either side of his face, you gently pulled him to kiss you once again. Your kisses were more desperate, the passion growing inside each of you.</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d you whispered. \u201cPlease\u2026I need you\u2026need to feel you again\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry moved quickly between your thighs, guiding his cock to align with your center, the smooth skin of his tip sliding along your wet lips, coating it perfectly as he parted them. His eyes looked intensely into yours, attempting to convince himself that this wasn\u2019t just another of his many dreams of being with you again, that it truly was happening.</p><p>You kissed his lips as you watched each other, feeling him slide slowly inside of you, your feet wrapping around him as he drove himself as deeply into you as possible, both of you moaning at the amazing feeling. For a brief moment, Harry held himself deeply inside of you, not moving, as the two of you kissed passionately, a mumbled \u2018fuck\u2019 slipping from his lips at how wonderful the feeling of being inside of you again was. </p><p>Harry slowly began thrusting, kissing you tenderly, as his hands roamed you. You felt his face bury into your neck as you heard another moan from his throat.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d he whispered, his mind floating from the immense pleasure he hadn\u2019t felt with you in so long. He was full and thick inside of you and he knew he was, your tightness nearly sending his mind into a state of euphoria he could only experience with you. \u201cFuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>His mouth sloppily stumbling to find yours, his mind being lost in his elation, he kissed you desperately once again, gentle nibbles, licks, and kisses left on skin, both of you whispering sentiments of love and sinful promises in your long-awaited reunion of needy bodies and intimate thoughts.</p><p>\u201cFuck, kitten,\u201d Harry panted heavily as you sucked a delightfully painful love bite to his neck, his hand fisting a large handful of your hair backward as you released him, his mouth quickly finding yours, battering your lips into swollen, raspberry-tinted pillows.</p><p>Pulling one of his arms behind your head as a pillow, his other arm quickly pulled your thigh higher on his hip, allowing him to rut deeper into you still as he picked up his pace, his breathing becoming more ragged and loud.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2026\u201d you panted, begging him to not hold back, his position shifting just right, causing you to gasp as he drove deeply into you. Harry felt your walls, hot and slick, allowing him to slide in and out of you easily. His tongue dove between your lips, eager to taste every part of you it hadn\u2019t tasted in so long. Harry\u2019s name rushed from your throat as you panted near his ear. His dick began to pulse against your tightening walls, groaning lightly at how wonderful it felt.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI love you so much. Always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you panted faster, your eyes beginning to flutter as you squeezed them shut, a deep breath taken in as your body was completely at Harry\u2019s mercy. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry felt you clamping around him like a vice, your back arching away from the blanket-covered floor as he hit just the right spot to make you quake in spasms underneath him. You moaned loudly as you orgasmed, your body clutching around him as he pumped his seed deeply into you\u2026thick, heavy ribbons shooting into your core. He released a loud groan against your face, kissing your cheek as he tried to remember to breath, stars popping in his vision as he squeezed his eyes closed tightly, releasing his load inside of you, a slight ache in his jaw from clenching it so tightly. </p><p>Both of you panting against each other\u2019s skin, still feeling the spasms continue sporadically in both of you, you felt Harry place kisses randomly around your face and neck and chest. Breathing slowly becoming controlled again, Harry kissed your face, holding the other side of it firmly so that you couldn\u2019t pull away from the love he needed to show you.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I was afraid of never feeling that with you again,\u201d Harry spoke quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted that for so long, ever since I left on tour, when we spent our last night together.\u201d Harry looked at your face, slowly tracing your lips with his thumb. \u201cI\u2019m never, never letting you go again. Never. We\u2019ll make it work with our careers. I promise.\u201d</p><p>The two of you took pleasure in becoming intimately reacquainted on the blanket-covered stone floor in the workshop of your gallery. Food long forgotten and champagne unknowingly spilled nearby, nothing else in the world mattered. You and Harry had found your way back to each other. No matter what happened past that point, you would get through everything\u2026together. </p><p>Eventually redressing as Harry requested taking your lovemaking reunion back to his home to continue, you quickly cleaned the mess around the area. Walking out into the bit of sunlight that was just beginning to rise, Harry joked that the two of you had just christened the proverbial ship of your building, laughing as you went back to Harry\u2019s house, holding to those sinful promises from before.</p><p>*</p><p>Harry woke, smiling as he remembered the hours before, making love with you as you reunited as lovers. Looking to the side of his bed you were still sleeping in, Harry turned over to face you, wrapping his arms around you and pulling you flush against his body, flowering kisses across your back and shoulders. Hearing you breath in more deeply, he felt you turn in his arms and face him, opening your eyes and smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he grinned to you as you smiled. \u201cEven first thing of a morning, so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid I would wake and find this had all been a dream,\u201d you grinned honestly. \u201cI\u2019m so happy it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever letting you go again, baby,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve been thinking about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Harry grinned to you, kissing you lightly and readjusting his arm around you.</p><p>\u201cHad things gone differently,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we hadn\u2019t split up, or\u2026you had come with me on tour maybe\u2026had things been different in our careers\u2026I would have asked you by now to live with me.\u201d</p><p>Harry watched as you processed what he was saying, seeing your lips form a smile as he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019ve only gotten back together now, but,\u201d Harry started. \u201cI\u2019d like\u2026for you to live with me, move into my home. No more apartment. I want you here, with me. I would have asked you had we stayed together, and especially now with all that\u2019s happened\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026want me to live with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than fucking anything, babe,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI was going to ask you anyway, as best friends and with the security issues. But especially now that we\u2019re together again. I want it more than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>You saw the watering in his eyes as he smiled and chuckled at your smiling silence.</p><p>\u201cI want you here with me, all the time,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI want to be able to come home to you after work. I want your clothes hanging in the closet next to mine, mixed together in the laundry with mine. And your toothbrush with mine at the sink, your things next to mine in the shower or on the dresser. I want us to share\u2026everything.\u201d</p><p>Harry saw a tear fall from your eye to the pillow under your face, as you laughed gently.</p><p>\u201cI want everything with you,\u201d Harry said. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d</p><p>Unable to speak in your happiness, you released a giggling sob, nodding your head, wrapping your arms around him as he laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be amazing, baby,\u201d Harry smiled. \u201cAbsolutely amazing.\u201d</p><p>* </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last one,\u201d Harry said, as he brought a box in from the other room. You looked around the tiny apartment as he walked to you, holding his arms around your shoulders from behind and kissing the side of your face. \u201cAre you going to miss living here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d you laughed. \u201cFuck, no.\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed as you smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the first time you stayed the night here with me?\u201d you asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cThat little matchbox of a bed you had then,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cMy fuckin\u2019 legs hung over the end by nearly a foot!\u201d</p><p>You both laughed, looking around the little room.</p><p>\u201cNot like we slept or anything that night,\u201d you teased.</p><p>\u201cFuck right we didn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Harry said, kissing your neck, nibbling at your earlobe. \u201cFor two full fucking days\u2026\u201d</p><p>You turned to face him, as he kissed you deeply, then left three or four smaller kisses gently to your lips with a smile.</p><p>\u201cCome on, love,\u201d Harry said. \u201cOne last time before we go?\u201d</p><p>You giggled as Harry grabbed your hand, laughing all the way into the bedroom. In time, the moving van arrived and you and Harry packed everything inside of it, taking your things back to Harry\u2019s home\u2026your new home with Harry. You were beyond happy.</p><p>*</p><p>For weeks you hadn\u2019t heard anything out of Michael and you hoped he was done harassing you. You obviously hadn\u2019t told him you moved from the apartment, but believing that your intruder was most likely him, his key would no longer work so you assumed he would figure it out eventually.</p><p>As you stepped out of the passenger side of the vehicle, Harry quickly made his way around the car, standing next to you and grabbing your hand as he walked you to the front door of the gallery. Your business was doing very well, you and Harry were beyond happy together, and you felt like you were finally almost yourself again. You still worked with Dr. Glen, but felt healthy again, even though you still knew your mind was a work in progress.</p><p>\u201cEverything looks good here,\u201d Harry said, handing you your coffee cup. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to get to my meeting, then I\u2019m going to do some writing this afternoon. You have anything on your agenda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a ten o\u2019clock sculpting class,\u201d you grinned. \u201cThen I\u2019m hoping this afternoon I can work in the workshop for a while since Katie seems to be working out really well in here with the daily stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she seems nice,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAll right, love, I\u2019m going to get on then. Call if you need me. Nothing major for me today anyway. I\u2019ll bring us lunch in later before I go off to write, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds wonderful,\u201d you said, accepting his kiss and long hug. \u201cThat feels so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond good,\u201d he said, holding you a moment longer. \u201cI\u2019ll be here around one?\u201d</p><p><br>\nYou nodded and smiled as he kissed you quickly again, then hearing the front door and seeing Katie walk inside.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d Harry said to her then turned again. \u201cSee you in a few hours, baby. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>Thankful. That\u2019s all you could say about your life finally becoming calm and more normal again. You were thankful to Dr. Glen for helping you work through the pieces of your mind that Michael had twisted into a knot of confusion and disorientation. You were forever thankful to Harry for staying by your side, being the perfect definition of what a best friend should really be. And you were thankful that Michael appeared to have finally given up on you and was leaving you alone. The restraining order Harry acquired to protect you may have helped with that, too, but still, you were thankful Michael was abiding by it. You didn\u2019t know where Michael had gone or what he was doing, and you didn\u2019t care, as long as he continued to stay far away from you and Harry. </p><p>You still struggled with thoughts in your mind about Michael. Thoughts that you worked on in every session with Dr. Glen. You understood now that Michael had said and done many things with the intent of manipulating you. But it was still difficult for you to see the depth of his deceit sometimes. You thought he must either be an amazing actor, or maybe some of his feelings for you were sincere. Although you knew you never loved him, you really had liked him as a person until things become too much. But\u2026he did do things to you that proved it was not a healthy relationship, things that had put a fear in you toward him, and Dr. Glen and Harry both worked with you to help you see those things more clearly, helping you to find yourself again. Retraining your mind\u2026that\u2019s what you were doing with their help, and you were extremely thankful Michael had apparently removed himself from the situation all together.</p><p>Having taught your only class scheduled that day, you cleaned the area again, then prepared your mind for the tasks of your afternoon. It was exciting to have been commissioned for a piece of art by another London gallery, known for showcasing other local artists. It was a badge of acceptance in your eyes that you were asked, and you wanted to make sure it was a perfect example of your work.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I leave a few minutes early for lunch? I have a lunch date,\u201d Katie smiled.</p><p>\u201cMmmm, same guy?\u201d you giggled.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she grinned. \u201cSeems to be a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d you smiled. \u201cGo ahead, it\u2019s fine. Harry should be here any minute with lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cSee you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>You turned back around and looked through a couple of drawers, trying to find the tools you would need for the commission work you would begin on that afternoon. Hearing the door open, you hollered into the gallery.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the workshop, Harry!\u201d</p><p>You heard the footsteps walking through the gallery, across the stone floors, then walking behind you.</p><p>\u201cJust in time,\u201d you said, pushing the drawer closed again. \u201cKatie just left for lunch, too.\u201d</p><p>Hearing only footsteps, you turned as your smile dropped from your face, seeing Michael continuing his path toward you. Out of instinct you reached to the counter next to you, grabbing the sharp carving blade in your hand and holding it straight out in front of you, causing Michael to stop in his steps a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart,\u201d Michael smiled gently. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen you. I just came to see how you\u2019re doing, see how the gallery is doing.\u201d</p><p>You saw how badly you were shaking, barely seeming a threat, but you knew the knife in your hand was sharp enough to leave a deep slice in anything it touched.</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave,\u201d you stated firmly. \u201cI have security cameras everywhere, recording you being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m doing nothing wrong. I\u2019m not hurting you. You\u2019re the only one who\u2019s threatening right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you too well,\u201d you spoke. \u201cNow leave, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI came here to see you, and I\u2019m going to. Now stop with this and put that away.\u201d</p><p>He began to step closer as you shakily held the blade closer to him, he retracting his step back again.</p><p>\u201cI have a restraining order on you,\u201d you announced. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking the law by being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry you felt you needed one against me,\u201d he saddened. \u201cI would never intentionally hurt you, sweetheart. This has all become such a mess. There\u2019s so much you don\u2019t know. I just want time to explain everything to you, so you don\u2019t hate me. I know you live with Harry now, I\u2019ve seen you together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life is none of your business,\u201d you spoke more sternly, your eyes burning from the tears you were holding back, perspiration beginning to form on your brow and upper lip from your fear. </p><p>\u201cOh, my love\u2026your life will always be my business,\u201d he swooned. \u201cI know you\u2019re in love with Harry, probably always have been. It explains a lot, honestly. But that doesn\u2019t change how I feel about you. I love you, probably too much, and I know if you would just give me a chance, you could love me, too. But even if you\u2019re with Harry, I\u2019ll always be around somewhere. That\u2019s how much I love you. You may not see me, or hear me, or even know I\u2019m there, but I will be, have to be\u2026just like in your apartment. I was always there. Even the nights Harry was there with you.\u201d</p><p>You panted in your growing fear, holding the sharp chisel high at his throat-level, but not backing down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you thrown in jail,\u201d you said more loudly as your voice wavered slightly. \u201cI know everything you did to me when we were dating. All of the mind tricks you played on me, making me think I was losing my mind. What kind of a person does that?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI can explain all of that, I swear. It wasn\u2019t my fault, I had to. You just don\u2019t understand. It wasn\u2019t\u2026me\u2026I mean, it was, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was you!\u201d you yelled shakily.</p><p>Harry heard your voice as he walked into the gallery, hearing the fear and strain in it, as he quietly closed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cIt was you! I know everything that you\u2019ve done to me!\u201d you cried, your arm shaking terribly toward him, nearly nicking him with the sharp cutting edge.</p><p>Harry quietly stepped through the gallery toward the workshop, peeking inside the doorway and seeing you holding the knife out in front of you, shaking terribly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never hurt you,\u201d Michael said calmly. \u201cEven the day you broke your arm. It wasn\u2019t\u2026I mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026you were here?\u201d you questioned, Harry seeing the look of confusion slowly overcoming your face, but keeping the knife toward Michael.</p><p>\u201cI just need to explain\u2026tell you everything,\u201d Michael said, seeing you slowly letting down your guard. \u201cI never wanted you to get hurt\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d you said, shaking your head and holding the tool high. \u201cI remember now. You <i>were</i> here. You\u2026you tried to force me to leave with you. But I\u2026I fought you\u2026and\u2026threatened to yell to anyone who could hear that you were kidnapping me\u2026\u201d</p><p>You gasped as you suddenly saw Harry attack Michael from behind.</p><p>\u201cYou stay the fuck away from her!\u201d Harry yelled, as the two men fought.</p><p>Losing the shock of what you were seeing, you reached for the silent alarm button under the cabinet ledge and backed into the corner. You saw Michael kick at Harry, trying to separate himself from him, pulling on the leg of a nearby stool and toppling it onto Harry. Feeling the release of Harry\u2019s hands on him, Michael ran for the door.</p><p>Harry quickly got to his feet, running to the doorway but seeing Michael had already disappeared out the front door of the building. Looking back to where you were standing, white as a ghost and still shaking, Harry ran to you. Pulling you into his arms, kissing your face over and over, he held you tightly.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right? Did he hurt you?\u201d Harry asked, looking over your body for signs of blood or trauma.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d you said, clutching him tightly. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolice!\u201d you both heard from the other room.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in here!\u201d Harry shouted back, as you saw them walk into the room.</p><p>You and Harry described everything that happened, Harry requesting enforcement of the restraining order. Deciding there had been enough excitement for the day, Harry called Katie, giving her the rest of the day off, feeling it best he should take you home. He walked to where you were, sitting down next to you and pulling your hand into his, kissing it.</p><p>\u201cI remembered,\u201d you said quietly, as he looked to you, knowing you were pleased. Something that had happened to you made sense, and you had remembered what had happened.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry grinned lightly. \u201cYou did well, baby.\u201d</p>",

This chapter is a bit shorter than the rest, and so is Chapter Nine, so if you all show me the love today with this chapter, I promise to post the next chapter later today. Thank you for reading and much love to you all! xo</b></i></p><p><i><b>Shelli</b></i></p><p><i>*******************************</i></p><p>You couldn\u2019t believe your grand opening was finally happening!</p><p>After all of the months of work, and all of the shit you had gone through to get there, it was finally time to open your business to the public. Your paintings and creations were placed around the entire building, as art aficionados and those in the business walked around, taking it all in while enjoying a flute of champagne.</p><p>Harry looked to where you were standing in front of one of your pieces, discussing it with another artist. He was so proud of you, documenting it for you as he took photos of the event. He planned to advertise your business on his social media soon, but not wanting to create a frenzy at the grand opening, he chose to wait until after everyone left, wanting a photo of the two of you in front of one of your creations.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cAre you having a good time, love?\u201d Harry smiled as he placed his arm around your waist.</p><p>\u201cSuch a great time!\u201d you beamed, more happy than you could remember being in a long time. \u201cA lot of people showed up, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been ass to ass in here since we opened the door!\u201d Harry laughed as you smiled and giggled. \u201cThere are people all over the pavement outside and cars congested in the street. It\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>You smiled, accepting his kiss to your cheek, then walked away with someone who had a question. Harry watched around the building, speaking with those he knew, always training his eye to follow where you were. As he glanced toward the door, Harry felt his stomach drop, as he noticed Michael, making his way to where you were in the next room.</p><p>Harry quickly walked through a different doorway, seeing where you were, and barging his way through the crowd of people, barely getting to you before Michael did. You felt \u00a0a quick grab of your arm, spinning you slightly, as you looked at Harry questioningly.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d you asked, seeing the look on his face, then hearing what he was looking at and turning.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get my invitation to your grand opening, sweetheart,\u201d Michael said with a smile. \u201cYou promised me an invitation the day we met and you bought this building from me.\u201d</p><p>Your heart sped, feeling as if it were in your throat, looking around at the hundreds of guests unaware of the imminent scene that could easily happen.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t welcome here,\u201d Harry told Michael quietly, trying not to bring attention, as Harry signaled to the security he had waiting nearby. Michael turned and saw the large men in black clothing coming closer to where they were.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m not here to cause trouble,\u201d Michael said with earnest inflection. \u201cI only wanted to come congratulate you for all of your hard work and dedication. This is amazing, sweetheart!\u201d</p><p>Michael felt the hands of the guards on his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI\u2019ll go. I\u2019m not one for large crowds anyway. I just wanted you to know I am supporting you in this, and I wish you nothing but the best.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t acknowledge anything he said to you, merely looked down facing Harry, as he slipped his arm around you, leading you away from where Michael and the guards were walking away. Guiding you into a small area in the back, Harry cupped his hand around your jaw, feeling you trembling slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, love?\u201d he asked quietly in case there were others around who could hear. He saw you nod your head then look up at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m okay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, you accepted the long hug from your best friend. The comfort you felt when Harry held you was like no other sense of security and gentleness you had known. It made you wish you could stay in his arms all the time, missing what you once had with him. Pulling slowly away from him, you grinned lovingly to him, feeling Harry tenderly kiss your face, then felt his hand take yours as he led you back into the party. You smiled at people as you greeted them once again, discussing your art, with Harry not leaving your side the remainder of the event.</p><p>As the opening dwindled, with only a few people still looking around, Harry saw how ready you appeared for some relaxation. Following the last few people to the door, he thanked them and locked the door behind them. Walking back to where you stood in the next room, looking around at everything, Harry smiled at you, handing you a fresh flute of champagne and clinking your glass.</p><p>\u201cTo the birth of an amazing art gallery,\u201d Harry said. \u201cMay it be everything you want it to be, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you smiled, sipping from the glass.</p><p>\u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d Harry grinned, taking your hand and walking you to the workshop in the back of the building. As you stepped through the doorway, you saw a blanket spread across the floor, food adorning it, as Harry walked you toward it. \u201cI think today was a huge success. So we are going to celebrate with an amazing dinner I had sent from our favorite restaurant and strategically had sneaked through the backdoor. The doors are all locked and it\u2019s only us. No one else I would rather be with at this moment than you.\u201d</p><p>You felt Harry lean to you, a sweet kiss placed lightly on your lips, he holding your hand as you sat on the large blanket. As you watched Harry pull the food out, you debated in your mind over something you had been thinking about, feeling it was now the right time to share it with him.</p><p>\u201cMay I tell you something?\u201d you asked, as he glanced to you with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou can always tell me anything, you know that,\u201d he said sweetly, glancing over the food then to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to tell you this for a while,\u201d you said slowly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I should. But now\u2026I know I want to, regardless of what you think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be fine,\u201d Harry chuckled and smiled. \u201cTell me, go on now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in the hospital,\u201d you started. \u201cWhen I had the panic attack and fainted and you took me, and I was so sick\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Harry said, looking at you tenderly.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream,\u201d you spoke. \u201cI know I wasn\u2019t really in my head most of the time. It was very strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAt least we know why now.\u201d</p><p>You nodded then continued.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream,\u201d you repeated, Harry listening closely as you told your thoughts. \u201cIn the dream\u2026you told me\u2026you were still in love with me. That you never stopped loving me after we broke up.\u201d</p><p>You watched as his smile fell into a concentrated look.</p><p>\u201cYou said that you wished I wasn\u2019t with Michael,\u201d you continued, thinking. \u201cThat you wished the two of us were together again, like before. I didn\u2019t want to tell you, because I didn\u2019t want to make you feel uncomfortable about it, especially since I was still dating Michael. But\u2026with everything I\u2019ve been dealing with, and most recently beginning to realize\u2026my life could be at risk now\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry swallowed hard at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI decided,\u201d you said, looking at him intensely. \u201cI decided I want to be honest with you about my feelings, whether you feel the same or not. I hate the thought of something happening to me and you never knowing how I truly feel about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about something happening to you, babe,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine now. You\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you nodded, smiling softly to him. \u201cAnd I thank you for that.\u201d</p><p>You looked at him another moment and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI know it was only a dream,\u201d you said. \u201cBut\u2026I never\u2026fell out of love with you. I started dating Michael, hoping it would help me to get over you. I think that\u2019s why I could never let myself get close to him. I do still love you, as more than just best friends, and I want you to know that, in case something would happen to me. I know you\u2019ve moved on, and\u2026that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just so thankful we\u2019re still best friends.\u201d</p><p>Seeing the uncertainty in your eyes, wondering how he would react to what you had admitted, Harry moved closely to you and held your hand in his.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIn the hospital, you didn\u2019t dream it. I really said it to you, love. You hadn\u2019t woken yet, but I couldn\u2019t keep my secret from you anymore. I had to tell you, even if you couldn\u2019t hear me, or\u2026at least, I thought you couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want you to hate me because I said it and you were still with Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never hate you, Harry\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am still so in love with you, baby,\u201d Harry said, as his eyes began to glisten. \u201cI\u2019ve never fallen out of love with you. I just wanted to respect your relationship you were in. I\u2019ve never stopped loving you.\u201d</p><p>Seeing a tear slowly slide down your cheek, Harry leaned closely to you, holding your face in his hand, pressing his lips gently to yours, tasting you once again after such a long time away from that level of intimacy with you. Pulling away slightly again, Harry looked at you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so in love with you, baby,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Kissing you passionately, Harry held you, wanting to keep you in his arms forever. Leaning away from you slightly, Harry kept you in his hold, as you both looked into each other\u2019s tear-filled eyes. No words needed spoken. You both knew. Everything was finally going to be as it should be again.</p><p>Harry\u2019s mouth on your neck was even more comforting than you remembered it feeling, as he left soft kisses along your jaw, leaning you backward on the blanket, he looking down over you as a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he whispered, kissing you softly again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you\u2026so much,\u201d you returned, leaning up to nibble at his jaw, as you sucked a gentle kiss to his neck, hearing him groan softly.</p><p>Feeling his hand move from your waist, slowly down your hip, his mouth searching yours again, he grasped your thigh in his wide-spread fingers, pulling your leg up to rest on his thigh. A kiss never felt so good, Harry moaning as your hand moved over the front of his trousers, caressing him firmly through the fabric. His nibbles tugging at your bottom lip revealed the craving he had for you, begging for another kiss. His arms pulling tightly around your body, Harry clutched onto you as if he was afraid of you slipping away and never feeling that again with you.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m never letting you go again,\u201d Harry sputtered in an excited whisper, as he slid his hand back up your body, it disappearing inside your dress as it clutched your breast. Pulling his head back, the look on Harry\u2019s face said everything the two of you were feeling in that moment. It was the same look you remembered seeing when you were together. The look of complete love and adoration, of two hearts and souls knowing they were with their soulmate once again. It was a feeling which went beyond explanation, but not needing explained, both of you feeling it.</p><p>The two of you became lost in a muddle of strewn clothing, eager groans, and wet kisses. The feel of his erect dick and heavy sac pressing against your pelvic bone caused a tingling to shoot through your body at the anticipation of what was happening between you, a feeling you had wondered if you would ever experience with Harry again. You closed your eyes at the feel of his tongue flicking against your nipple as he turned it into a hard pebble between his lips. As the heat of his breath traveled to your other eager nipple, his hand stealthily slid between your legs, a groan releasing from his throat as he felt the wet heat, his fingers sliding slowly back and forth along your lips, his fingertips becoming wet with your juices.</p><p>Harry lightly touched the tip of his tongue against your hard nipple again as he looked to your face. Your eyes were focused on him, lips parted slightly as you felt one of his fingers slide inside of you, your moan failing to be suppressed. \u00a0Harry\u2019s heavy breath scattered kisses across your chest, a passionate bite to your collarbone, as another finger slid into you. His breathing coming in quicker spurts along with yours, your body was ready to explode, wanting Harry inside of you. Holding your hands on either side of his face, you gently pulled him to kiss you once again. Your kisses were more desperate, the passion growing inside each of you.</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d you whispered. \u201cPlease\u2026I need you\u2026need to feel you again\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry moved quickly between your thighs, guiding his cock to align with your center, the smooth skin of his tip sliding along your wet lips, coating it perfectly as he parted them. His eyes looked intensely into yours, attempting to convince himself that this wasn\u2019t just another of his many dreams of being with you again, that it truly was happening.</p><p>You kissed his lips as you watched each other, feeling him slide slowly inside of you, your feet wrapping around him as he drove himself as deeply into you as possible, both of you moaning at the amazing feeling. For a brief moment, Harry held himself deeply inside of you, not moving, as the two of you kissed passionately, a mumbled \u2018fuck\u2019 slipping from his lips at how wonderful the feeling of being inside of you again was. </p><p>Harry slowly began thrusting, kissing you tenderly, as his hands roamed you. You felt his face bury into your neck as you heard another moan from his throat.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d he whispered, his mind floating from the immense pleasure he hadn\u2019t felt with you in so long. He was full and thick inside of you and he knew he was, your tightness nearly sending his mind into a state of euphoria he could only experience with you. \u201cFuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>His mouth sloppily stumbling to find yours, his mind being lost in his elation, he kissed you desperately once again, gentle nibbles, licks, and kisses left on skin, both of you whispering sentiments of love and sinful promises in your long-awaited reunion of needy bodies and intimate thoughts.</p><p>\u201cFuck, kitten,\u201d Harry panted heavily as you sucked a delightfully painful love bite to his neck, his hand fisting a large handful of your hair backward as you released him, his mouth quickly finding yours, battering your lips into swollen, raspberry-tinted pillows.</p><p>Pulling one of his arms behind your head as a pillow, his other arm quickly pulled your thigh higher on his hip, allowing him to rut deeper into you still as he picked up his pace, his breathing becoming more ragged and loud.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2026\u201d you panted, begging him to not hold back, his position shifting just right, causing you to gasp as he drove deeply into you. Harry felt your walls, hot and slick, allowing him to slide in and out of you easily. His tongue dove between your lips, eager to taste every part of you it hadn\u2019t tasted in so long. Harry\u2019s name rushed from your throat as you panted near his ear. His dick began to pulse against your tightening walls, groaning lightly at how wonderful it felt.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI love you so much. Always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you panted faster, your eyes beginning to flutter as you squeezed them shut, a deep breath taken in as your body was completely at Harry\u2019s mercy. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry felt you clamping around him like a vice, your back arching away from the blanket-covered floor as he hit just the right spot to make you quake in spasms underneath him. You moaned loudly as you orgasmed, your body clutching around him as he pumped his seed deeply into you\u2026thick, heavy ribbons shooting into your core. He released a loud groan against your face, kissing your cheek as he tried to remember to breath, stars popping in his vision as he squeezed his eyes closed tightly, releasing his load inside of you, a slight ache in his jaw from clenching it so tightly. </p><p>Both of you panting against each other\u2019s skin, still feeling the spasms continue sporadically in both of you, you felt Harry place kisses randomly around your face and neck and chest. Breathing slowly becoming controlled again, Harry kissed your face, holding the other side of it firmly so that you couldn\u2019t pull away from the love he needed to show you.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I was afraid of never feeling that with you again,\u201d Harry spoke quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted that for so long, ever since I left on tour, when we spent our last night together.\u201d Harry looked at your face, slowly tracing your lips with his thumb. \u201cI\u2019m never, never letting you go again. Never. We\u2019ll make it work with our careers. I promise.\u201d</p><p>The two of you took pleasure in becoming intimately reacquainted on the blanket-covered stone floor in the workshop of your gallery. Food long forgotten and champagne unknowingly spilled nearby, nothing else in the world mattered. You and Harry had found your way back to each other. No matter what happened past that point, you would get through everything\u2026together. </p><p>Eventually redressing as Harry requested taking your lovemaking reunion back to his home to continue, you quickly cleaned the mess around the area. Walking out into the bit of sunlight that was just beginning to rise, Harry joked that the two of you had just christened the proverbial ship of your building, laughing as you went back to Harry\u2019s house, holding to those sinful promises from before.</p><p>*</p><p>Harry woke, smiling as he remembered the hours before, making love with you as you reunited as lovers. Looking to the side of his bed you were still sleeping in, Harry turned over to face you, wrapping his arms around you and pulling you flush against his body, flowering kisses across your back and shoulders. Hearing you breath in more deeply, he felt you turn in his arms and face him, opening your eyes and smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he grinned to you as you smiled. \u201cEven first thing of a morning, so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid I would wake and find this had all been a dream,\u201d you grinned honestly. \u201cI\u2019m so happy it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever letting you go again, baby,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve been thinking about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Harry grinned to you, kissing you lightly and readjusting his arm around you.</p><p>\u201cHad things gone differently,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we hadn\u2019t split up, or\u2026you had come with me on tour maybe\u2026had things been different in our careers\u2026I would have asked you by now to live with me.\u201d</p><p>Harry watched as you processed what he was saying, seeing your lips form a smile as he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019ve only gotten back together now, but,\u201d Harry started. \u201cI\u2019d like\u2026for you to live with me, move into my home. No more apartment. I want you here, with me. I would have asked you had we stayed together, and especially now with all that\u2019s happened\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026want me to live with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than fucking anything, babe,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI was going to ask you anyway, as best friends and with the security issues. But especially now that we\u2019re together again. I want it more than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>You saw the watering in his eyes as he smiled and chuckled at your smiling silence.</p><p>\u201cI want you here with me, all the time,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI want to be able to come home to you after work. I want your clothes hanging in the closet next to mine, mixed together in the laundry with mine. And your toothbrush with mine at the sink, your things next to mine in the shower or on the dresser. I want us to share\u2026everything.\u201d</p><p>Harry saw a tear fall from your eye to the pillow under your face, as you laughed gently.</p><p>\u201cI want everything with you,\u201d Harry said. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d</p><p>Unable to speak in your happiness, you released a giggling sob, nodding your head, wrapping your arms around him as he laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be amazing, baby,\u201d Harry smiled. \u201cAbsolutely amazing.\u201d</p><p>* </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last one,\u201d Harry said, as he brought a box in from the other room. You looked around the tiny apartment as he walked to you, holding his arms around your shoulders from behind and kissing the side of your face. \u201cAre you going to miss living here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d you laughed. \u201cFuck, no.\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed as you smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the first time you stayed the night here with me?\u201d you asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cThat little matchbox of a bed you had then,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cMy fuckin\u2019 legs hung over the end by nearly a foot!\u201d</p><p>You both laughed, looking around the little room.</p><p>\u201cNot like we slept or anything that night,\u201d you teased.</p><p>\u201cFuck right we didn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Harry said, kissing your neck, nibbling at your earlobe. \u201cFor two full fucking days\u2026\u201d</p><p>You turned to face him, as he kissed you deeply, then left three or four smaller kisses gently to your lips with a smile.</p><p>\u201cCome on, love,\u201d Harry said. \u201cOne last time before we go?\u201d</p><p>You giggled as Harry grabbed your hand, laughing all the way into the bedroom. In time, the moving van arrived and you and Harry packed everything inside of it, taking your things back to Harry\u2019s home\u2026your new home with Harry. You were beyond happy.</p><p>*</p><p>For weeks you hadn\u2019t heard anything out of Michael and you hoped he was done harassing you. You obviously hadn\u2019t told him you moved from the apartment, but believing that your intruder was most likely him, his key would no longer work so you assumed he would figure it out eventually.</p><p>As you stepped out of the passenger side of the vehicle, Harry quickly made his way around the car, standing next to you and grabbing your hand as he walked you to the front door of the gallery. Your business was doing very well, you and Harry were beyond happy together, and you felt like you were finally almost yourself again. You still worked with Dr. Glen, but felt healthy again, even though you still knew your mind was a work in progress.</p><p>\u201cEverything looks good here,\u201d Harry said, handing you your coffee cup. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to get to my meeting, then I\u2019m going to do some writing this afternoon. You have anything on your agenda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a ten o\u2019clock sculpting class,\u201d you grinned. \u201cThen I\u2019m hoping this afternoon I can work in the workshop for a while since Katie seems to be working out really well in here with the daily stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she seems nice,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAll right, love, I\u2019m going to get on then. Call if you need me. Nothing major for me today anyway. I\u2019ll bring us lunch in later before I go off to write, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds wonderful,\u201d you said, accepting his kiss and long hug. \u201cThat feels so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond good,\u201d he said, holding you a moment longer. \u201cI\u2019ll be here around one?\u201d</p><p><br>\nYou nodded and smiled as he kissed you quickly again, then hearing the front door and seeing Katie walk inside.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d Harry said to her then turned again. \u201cSee you in a few hours, baby. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>Thankful. That\u2019s all you could say about your life finally becoming calm and more normal again. You were thankful to Dr. Glen for helping you work through the pieces of your mind that Michael had twisted into a knot of confusion and disorientation. You were forever thankful to Harry for staying by your side, being the perfect definition of what a best friend should really be. And you were thankful that Michael appeared to have finally given up on you and was leaving you alone. The restraining order Harry acquired to protect you may have helped with that, too, but still, you were thankful Michael was abiding by it. You didn\u2019t know where Michael had gone or what he was doing, and you didn\u2019t care, as long as he continued to stay far away from you and Harry. </p><p>You still struggled with thoughts in your mind about Michael. Thoughts that you worked on in every session with Dr. Glen. You understood now that Michael had said and done many things with the intent of manipulating you. But it was still difficult for you to see the depth of his deceit sometimes. You thought he must either be an amazing actor, or maybe some of his feelings for you were sincere. Although you knew you never loved him, you really had liked him as a person until things become too much. But\u2026he did do things to you that proved it was not a healthy relationship, things that had put a fear in you toward him, and Dr. Glen and Harry both worked with you to help you see those things more clearly, helping you to find yourself again. Retraining your mind\u2026that\u2019s what you were doing with their help, and you were extremely thankful Michael had apparently removed himself from the situation all together.</p><p>Having taught your only class scheduled that day, you cleaned the area again, then prepared your mind for the tasks of your afternoon. It was exciting to have been commissioned for a piece of art by another London gallery, known for showcasing other local artists. It was a badge of acceptance in your eyes that you were asked, and you wanted to make sure it was a perfect example of your work.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I leave a few minutes early for lunch? I have a lunch date,\u201d Katie smiled.</p><p>\u201cMmmm, same guy?\u201d you giggled.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she grinned. \u201cSeems to be a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d you smiled. \u201cGo ahead, it\u2019s fine. Harry should be here any minute with lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cSee you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>You turned back around and looked through a couple of drawers, trying to find the tools you would need for the commission work you would begin on that afternoon. Hearing the door open, you hollered into the gallery.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the workshop, Harry!\u201d</p><p>You heard the footsteps walking through the gallery, across the stone floors, then walking behind you.</p><p>\u201cJust in time,\u201d you said, pushing the drawer closed again. \u201cKatie just left for lunch, too.\u201d</p><p>Hearing only footsteps, you turned as your smile dropped from your face, seeing Michael continuing his path toward you. Out of instinct you reached to the counter next to you, grabbing the sharp carving blade in your hand and holding it straight out in front of you, causing Michael to stop in his steps a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart,\u201d Michael smiled gently. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen you. I just came to see how you\u2019re doing, see how the gallery is doing.\u201d</p><p>You saw how badly you were shaking, barely seeming a threat, but you knew the knife in your hand was sharp enough to leave a deep slice in anything it touched.</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave,\u201d you stated firmly. \u201cI have security cameras everywhere, recording you being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m doing nothing wrong. I\u2019m not hurting you. You\u2019re the only one who\u2019s threatening right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you too well,\u201d you spoke. \u201cNow leave, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI came here to see you, and I\u2019m going to. Now stop with this and put that away.\u201d</p><p>He began to step closer as you shakily held the blade closer to him, he retracting his step back again.</p><p>\u201cI have a restraining order on you,\u201d you announced. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking the law by being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry you felt you needed one against me,\u201d he saddened. \u201cI would never intentionally hurt you, sweetheart. This has all become such a mess. There\u2019s so much you don\u2019t know. I just want time to explain everything to you, so you don\u2019t hate me. I know you live with Harry now, I\u2019ve seen you together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life is none of your business,\u201d you spoke more sternly, your eyes burning from the tears you were holding back, perspiration beginning to form on your brow and upper lip from your fear. </p><p>\u201cOh, my love\u2026your life will always be my business,\u201d he swooned. \u201cI know you\u2019re in love with Harry, probably always have been. It explains a lot, honestly. But that doesn\u2019t change how I feel about you. I love you, probably too much, and I know if you would just give me a chance, you could love me, too. But even if you\u2019re with Harry, I\u2019ll always be around somewhere. That\u2019s how much I love you. You may not see me, or hear me, or even know I\u2019m there, but I will be, have to be\u2026just like in your apartment. I was always there. Even the nights Harry was there with you.\u201d</p><p>You panted in your growing fear, holding the sharp chisel high at his throat-level, but not backing down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you thrown in jail,\u201d you said more loudly as your voice wavered slightly. \u201cI know everything you did to me when we were dating. All of the mind tricks you played on me, making me think I was losing my mind. What kind of a person does that?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI can explain all of that, I swear. It wasn\u2019t my fault, I had to. You just don\u2019t understand. It wasn\u2019t\u2026me\u2026I mean, it was, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was you!\u201d you yelled shakily.</p><p>Harry heard your voice as he walked into the gallery, hearing the fear and strain in it, as he quietly closed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cIt was you! I know everything that you\u2019ve done to me!\u201d you cried, your arm shaking terribly toward him, nearly nicking him with the sharp cutting edge.</p><p>Harry quietly stepped through the gallery toward the workshop, peeking inside the doorway and seeing you holding the knife out in front of you, shaking terribly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never hurt you,\u201d Michael said calmly. \u201cEven the day you broke your arm. It wasn\u2019t\u2026I mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026you were here?\u201d you questioned, Harry seeing the look of confusion slowly overcoming your face, but keeping the knife toward Michael.</p><p>\u201cI just need to explain\u2026tell you everything,\u201d Michael said, seeing you slowly letting down your guard. \u201cI never wanted you to get hurt\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d you said, shaking your head and holding the tool high. \u201cI remember now. You <i>were</i> here. You\u2026you tried to force me to leave with you. But I\u2026I fought you\u2026and\u2026threatened to yell to anyone who could hear that you were kidnapping me\u2026\u201d</p><p>You gasped as you suddenly saw Harry attack Michael from behind.</p><p>\u201cYou stay the fuck away from her!\u201d Harry yelled, as the two men fought.</p><p>Losing the shock of what you were seeing, you reached for the silent alarm button under the cabinet ledge and backed into the corner. You saw Michael kick at Harry, trying to separate himself from him, pulling on the leg of a nearby stool and toppling it onto Harry. Feeling the release of Harry\u2019s hands on him, Michael ran for the door.</p><p>Harry quickly got to his feet, running to the doorway but seeing Michael had already disappeared out the front door of the building. Looking back to where you were standing, white as a ghost and still shaking, Harry ran to you. Pulling you into his arms, kissing your face over and over, he held you tightly.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right? Did he hurt you?\u201d Harry asked, looking over your body for signs of blood or trauma.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d you said, clutching him tightly. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolice!\u201d you both heard from the other room.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in here!\u201d Harry shouted back, as you saw them walk into the room.</p><p>You and Harry described everything that happened, Harry requesting enforcement of the restraining order. Deciding there had been enough excitement for the day, Harry called Katie, giving her the rest of the day off, feeling it best he should take you home. He walked to where you were, sitting down next to you and pulling your hand into his, kissing it.</p><p>\u201cI remembered,\u201d you said quietly, as he looked to you, knowing you were pleased. Something that had happened to you made sense, and you had remembered what had happened.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry grinned lightly. \u201cYou did well, baby.\u201d</p>",

This chapter is a bit shorter than the rest, and so is Chapter Nine, so if you all show me the love today with this chapter, I promise to post the next chapter later today. Thank you for reading and much love to you all! xo</b></i></p><p><i><b>Shelli</b></i></p><p><i>*******************************</i></p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t believe your grand opening was finally happening!</p><p>After all of the months of work, and all of the shit you had gone through to get there, it was finally time to open your business to the public. Your paintings and creations were placed around the entire building, as art aficionados and those in the business walked around, taking it all in while enjoying a flute of champagne.</p><p>Harry looked to where you were standing in front of one of your pieces, discussing it with another artist. He was so proud of you, documenting it for you as he took photos of the event. He planned to advertise your business on his social media soon, but not wanting to create a frenzy at the grand opening, he chose to wait until after everyone left, wanting a photo of the two of you in front of one of your creations.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you having a good time, love?&rdquo; Harry smiled as he placed his arm around your waist.</p><p>&ldquo;Such a great time!&rdquo; you beamed, more happy than you could remember being in a long time. &ldquo;A lot of people showed up, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been ass to ass in here since we opened the door!&rdquo; Harry laughed as you smiled and giggled. &ldquo;There are people all over the pavement outside and cars congested in the street. It&rsquo;s amazing!&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled, accepting his kiss to your cheek, then walked away with someone who had a question. Harry watched around the building, speaking with those he knew, always training his eye to follow where you were. As he glanced toward the door, Harry felt his stomach drop, as he noticed Michael, making his way to where you were in the next room.</p><p>Harry quickly walked through a different doorway, seeing where you were, and barging his way through the crowd of people, barely getting to you before Michael did. You felt &nbsp;a quick grab of your arm, spinning you slightly, as you looked at Harry questioningly.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything all right?&rdquo; you asked, seeing the look on his face, then hearing what he was looking at and turning.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get my invitation to your grand opening, sweetheart,&rdquo; Michael said with a smile. &ldquo;You promised me an invitation the day we met and you bought this building from me.&rdquo;</p><p>Your heart sped, feeling as if it were in your throat, looking around at the hundreds of guests unaware of the imminent scene that could easily happen.</p><p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t welcome here,&rdquo; Harry told Michael quietly, trying not to bring attention, as Harry signaled to the security he had waiting nearby. Michael turned and saw the large men in black clothing coming closer to where they were.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;m not here to cause trouble,&rdquo; Michael said with earnest inflection. &ldquo;I only wanted to come congratulate you for all of your hard work and dedication. This is amazing, sweetheart!&rdquo;</p><p>Michael felt the hands of the guards on his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go. I&rsquo;m not one for large crowds anyway. I just wanted you to know I am supporting you in this, and I wish you nothing but the best.&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t acknowledge anything he said to you, merely looked down facing Harry, as he slipped his arm around you, leading you away from where Michael and the guards were walking away. Guiding you into a small area in the back, Harry cupped his hand around your jaw, feeling you trembling slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;You all right, love?&rdquo; he asked quietly in case there were others around who could hear. He saw you nod your head then look up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m&hellip;I&rsquo;m okay. Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>Taking a deep breath, you accepted the long hug from your best friend. The comfort you felt when Harry held you was like no other sense of security and gentleness you had known. It made you wish you could stay in his arms all the time, missing what you once had with him. Pulling slowly away from him, you grinned lovingly to him, feeling Harry tenderly kiss your face, then felt his hand take yours as he led you back into the party. You smiled at people as you greeted them once again, discussing your art, with Harry not leaving your side the remainder of the event.</p><p>As the opening dwindled, with only a few people still looking around, Harry saw how ready you appeared for some relaxation. Following the last few people to the door, he thanked them and locked the door behind them. Walking back to where you stood in the next room, looking around at everything, Harry smiled at you, handing you a fresh flute of champagne and clinking your glass.</p><p>&ldquo;To the birth of an amazing art gallery,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;May it be everything you want it to be, love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you smiled, sipping from the glass.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a surprise for you,&rdquo; Harry grinned, taking your hand and walking you to the workshop in the back of the building. As you stepped through the doorway, you saw a blanket spread across the floor, food adorning it, as Harry walked you toward it. &ldquo;I think today was a huge success. So we are going to celebrate with an amazing dinner I had sent from our favorite restaurant and strategically had sneaked through the backdoor. The doors are all locked and it&rsquo;s only us. No one else I would rather be with at this moment than you.&rdquo;</p><p>You felt Harry lean to you, a sweet kiss placed lightly on your lips, he holding your hand as you sat on the large blanket. As you watched Harry pull the food out, you debated in your mind over something you had been thinking about, feeling it was now the right time to share it with him.</p><p>&ldquo;May I tell you something?&rdquo; you asked, as he glanced to you with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;You can always tell me anything, you know that,&rdquo; he said sweetly, glancing over the food then to you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting to tell you this for a while,&rdquo; you said slowly. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should. But now&hellip;I know I want to, regardless of what you think about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it will be fine,&rdquo; Harry chuckled and smiled. &ldquo;Tell me, go on now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I was in the hospital,&rdquo; you started. &ldquo;When I had the panic attack and fainted and you took me, and I was so sick&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Harry said, looking at you tenderly.</p><p>&ldquo;I had a dream,&rdquo; you spoke. &ldquo;I know I wasn&rsquo;t really in my head most of the time. It was very strange.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;At least we know why now.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded then continued.</p><p>&ldquo;I had a dream,&rdquo; you repeated, Harry listening closely as you told your thoughts. &ldquo;In the dream&hellip;you told me&hellip;you were still in love with me. That you never stopped loving me after we broke up.&rdquo;</p><p>You watched as his smile fell into a concentrated look.</p><p>&ldquo;You said that you wished I wasn&rsquo;t with Michael,&rdquo; you continued, thinking. &ldquo;That you wished the two of us were together again, like before. I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you, because I didn&rsquo;t want to make you feel uncomfortable about it, especially since I was still dating Michael. But&hellip;with everything I&rsquo;ve been dealing with, and most recently beginning to realize&hellip;my life could be at risk now&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Harry swallowed hard at the thought.</p><p>&ldquo;I decided,&rdquo; you said, looking at him intensely. &ldquo;I decided I want to be honest with you about my feelings, whether you feel the same or not. I hate the thought of something happening to me and you never knowing how I truly feel about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to think about something happening to you, babe,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be fine now. You&rsquo;ll be safe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; you nodded, smiling softly to him. &ldquo;And I thank you for that.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at him another moment and took a deep breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I know it was only a dream,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;But&hellip;I never&hellip;fell out of love with you. I started dating Michael, hoping it would help me to get over you. I think that&rsquo;s why I could never let myself get close to him. I do still love you, as more than just best friends, and I want you to know that, in case something would happen to me. I know you&rsquo;ve moved on, and&hellip;that&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m just so thankful we&rsquo;re still best friends.&rdquo;</p><p>Seeing the uncertainty in your eyes, wondering how he would react to what you had admitted, Harry moved closely to you and held your hand in his.</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a dream,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;In the hospital, you didn&rsquo;t dream it. I really said it to you, love. You hadn&rsquo;t woken yet, but I couldn&rsquo;t keep my secret from you anymore. I had to tell you, even if you couldn&rsquo;t hear me, or&hellip;at least, I thought you couldn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t want you to hate me because I said it and you were still with Michael.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could never hate you, Harry&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am still so in love with you, baby,&rdquo; Harry said, as his eyes began to glisten. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never fallen out of love with you. I just wanted to respect your relationship you were in. I&rsquo;ve never stopped loving you.&rdquo;</p><p>Seeing a tear slowly slide down your cheek, Harry leaned closely to you, holding your face in his hand, pressing his lips gently to yours, tasting you once again after such a long time away from that level of intimacy with you. Pulling away slightly again, Harry looked at you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so in love with you, baby,&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>Kissing you passionately, Harry held you, wanting to keep you in his arms forever. Leaning away from you slightly, Harry kept you in his hold, as you both looked into each other&rsquo;s tear-filled eyes. No words needed spoken. You both knew. Everything was finally going to be as it should be again.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s mouth on your neck was even more comforting than you remembered it feeling, as he left soft kisses along your jaw, leaning you backward on the blanket, he looking down over you as a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you,&rdquo; he whispered, kissing you softly again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you&hellip;so much,&rdquo; you returned, leaning up to nibble at his jaw, as you sucked a gentle kiss to his neck, hearing him groan softly.</p><p>Feeling his hand move from your waist, slowly down your hip, his mouth searching yours again, he grasped your thigh in his wide-spread fingers, pulling your leg up to rest on his thigh. A kiss never felt so good, Harry moaning as your hand moved over the front of his trousers, caressing him firmly through the fabric. His nibbles tugging at your bottom lip revealed the craving he had for you, begging for another kiss. His arms pulling tightly around your body, Harry clutched onto you as if he was afraid of you slipping away and never feeling that again with you.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, I&rsquo;m never letting you go again,&rdquo; Harry sputtered in an excited whisper, as he slid his hand back up your body, it disappearing inside your dress as it clutched your breast. Pulling his head back, the look on Harry&rsquo;s face said everything the two of you were feeling in that moment. It was the same look you remembered seeing when you were together. The look of complete love and adoration, of two hearts and souls knowing they were with their soulmate once again. It was a feeling which went beyond explanation, but not needing explained, both of you feeling it.</p><p>The two of you became lost in a muddle of strewn clothing, eager groans, and wet kisses. The feel of his erect dick and heavy sac pressing against your pelvic bone caused a tingling to shoot through your body at the anticipation of what was happening between you, a feeling you had wondered if you would ever experience with Harry again. You closed your eyes at the feel of his tongue flicking against your nipple as he turned it into a hard pebble between his lips. As the heat of his breath traveled to your other eager nipple, his hand stealthily slid between your legs, a groan releasing from his throat as he felt the wet heat, his fingers sliding slowly back and forth along your lips, his fingertips becoming wet with your juices.</p><p>Harry lightly touched the tip of his tongue against your hard nipple again as he looked to your face. Your eyes were focused on him, lips parted slightly as you felt one of his fingers slide inside of you, your moan failing to be suppressed. &nbsp;Harry&rsquo;s heavy breath scattered kisses across your chest, a passionate bite to your collarbone, as another finger slid into you. His breathing coming in quicker spurts along with yours, your body was ready to explode, wanting Harry inside of you. Holding your hands on either side of his face, you gently pulled him to kiss you once again. Your kisses were more desperate, the passion growing inside each of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo; you whispered. &ldquo;Please&hellip;I need you&hellip;need to feel you again&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Harry moved quickly between your thighs, guiding his cock to align with your center, the smooth skin of his tip sliding along your wet lips, coating it perfectly as he parted them. His eyes looked intensely into yours, attempting to convince himself that this wasn&rsquo;t just another of his many dreams of being with you again, that it truly was happening.</p><p>You kissed his lips as you watched each other, feeling him slide slowly inside of you, your feet wrapping around him as he drove himself as deeply into you as possible, both of you moaning at the amazing feeling. For a brief moment, Harry held himself deeply inside of you, not moving, as the two of you kissed passionately, a mumbled &lsquo;fuck&rsquo; slipping from his lips at how wonderful the feeling of being inside of you again was. </p><p>Harry slowly began thrusting, kissing you tenderly, as his hands roamed you. You felt his face bury into your neck as you heard another moan from his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&hellip;&rdquo; he whispered, his mind floating from the immense pleasure he hadn&rsquo;t felt with you in so long. He was full and thick inside of you and he knew he was, your tightness nearly sending his mind into a state of euphoria he could only experience with you. &ldquo;Fuck&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>His mouth sloppily stumbling to find yours, his mind being lost in his elation, he kissed you desperately once again, gentle nibbles, licks, and kisses left on skin, both of you whispering sentiments of love and sinful promises in your long-awaited reunion of needy bodies and intimate thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, kitten,&rdquo; Harry panted heavily as you sucked a delightfully painful love bite to his neck, his hand fisting a large handful of your hair backward as you released him, his mouth quickly finding yours, battering your lips into swollen, raspberry-tinted pillows.</p><p>Pulling one of his arms behind your head as a pillow, his other arm quickly pulled your thigh higher on his hip, allowing him to rut deeper into you still as he picked up his pace, his breathing becoming more ragged and loud.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry&hellip;&rdquo; you panted, begging him to not hold back, his position shifting just right, causing you to gasp as he drove deeply into you. Harry felt your walls, hot and slick, allowing him to slide in and out of you easily. His tongue dove between your lips, eager to taste every part of you it hadn&rsquo;t tasted in so long. Harry&rsquo;s name rushed from your throat as you panted near his ear. His dick began to pulse against your tightening walls, groaning lightly at how wonderful it felt.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, baby,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I love you so much. Always have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; you panted faster, your eyes beginning to flutter as you squeezed them shut, a deep breath taken in as your body was completely at Harry&rsquo;s mercy. &ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Harry felt you clamping around him like a vice, your back arching away from the blanket-covered floor as he hit just the right spot to make you quake in spasms underneath him. You moaned loudly as you orgasmed, your body clutching around him as he pumped his seed deeply into you&hellip;thick, heavy ribbons shooting into your core. He released a loud groan against your face, kissing your cheek as he tried to remember to breath, stars popping in his vision as he squeezed his eyes closed tightly, releasing his load inside of you, a slight ache in his jaw from clenching it so tightly. </p><p>Both of you panting against each other&rsquo;s skin, still feeling the spasms continue sporadically in both of you, you felt Harry place kisses randomly around your face and neck and chest. Breathing slowly becoming controlled again, Harry kissed your face, holding the other side of it firmly so that you couldn&rsquo;t pull away from the love he needed to show you.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, I was afraid of never feeling that with you again,&rdquo; Harry spoke quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted that for so long, ever since I left on tour, when we spent our last night together.&rdquo; Harry looked at your face, slowly tracing your lips with his thumb. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never, never letting you go again. Never. We&rsquo;ll make it work with our careers. I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>The two of you took pleasure in becoming intimately reacquainted on the blanket-covered stone floor in the workshop of your gallery. Food long forgotten and champagne unknowingly spilled nearby, nothing else in the world mattered. You and Harry had found your way back to each other. No matter what happened past that point, you would get through everything&hellip;together. </p><p>Eventually redressing as Harry requested taking your lovemaking reunion back to his home to continue, you quickly cleaned the mess around the area. Walking out into the bit of sunlight that was just beginning to rise, Harry joked that the two of you had just christened the proverbial ship of your building, laughing as you went back to Harry&rsquo;s house, holding to those sinful promises from before.</p><p>*</p><p>Harry woke, smiling as he remembered the hours before, making love with you as you reunited as lovers. Looking to the side of his bed you were still sleeping in, Harry turned over to face you, wrapping his arms around you and pulling you flush against his body, flowering kisses across your back and shoulders. Hearing you breath in more deeply, he felt you turn in his arms and face him, opening your eyes and smiling at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, you&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; he grinned to you as you smiled. &ldquo;Even first thing of a morning, so beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was afraid I would wake and find this had all been a dream,&rdquo; you grinned honestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never letting you go again, baby,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry grinned to you, kissing you lightly and readjusting his arm around you.</p><p>&ldquo;Had things gone differently,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And we hadn&rsquo;t split up, or&hellip;you had come with me on tour maybe&hellip;had things been different in our careers&hellip;I would have asked you by now to live with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry watched as you processed what he was saying, seeing your lips form a smile as he chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;I know we&rsquo;ve only gotten back together now, but,&rdquo; Harry started. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like&hellip;for you to live with me, move into my home. No more apartment. I want you here, with me. I would have asked you had we stayed together, and especially now with all that&rsquo;s happened&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip;want me to live with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More than fucking anything, babe,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;I was going to ask you anyway, as best friends and with the security issues. But especially now that we&rsquo;re together again. I want it more than you can imagine.&rdquo;</p><p>You saw the watering in his eyes as he smiled and chuckled at your smiling silence.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you here with me, all the time,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;I want to be able to come home to you after work. I want your clothes hanging in the closet next to mine, mixed together in the laundry with mine. And your toothbrush with mine at the sink, your things next to mine in the shower or on the dresser. I want us to share&hellip;everything.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry saw a tear fall from your eye to the pillow under your face, as you laughed gently.</p><p>&ldquo;I want everything with you,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Unable to speak in your happiness, you released a giggling sob, nodding your head, wrapping your arms around him as he laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be amazing, baby,&rdquo; Harry smiled. &ldquo;Absolutely amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>* </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last one,&rdquo; Harry said, as he brought a box in from the other room. You looked around the tiny apartment as he walked to you, holding his arms around your shoulders from behind and kissing the side of your face. &ldquo;Are you going to miss living here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; you laughed. &ldquo;Fuck, no.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry laughed as you smiled at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember the first time you stayed the night here with me?&rdquo; you asked with a grin.</p><p>&ldquo;That little matchbox of a bed you had then,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;My fuckin&rsquo; legs hung over the end by nearly a foot!&rdquo;</p><p>You both laughed, looking around the little room.</p><p>&ldquo;Not like we slept or anything that night,&rdquo; you teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck right we didn&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; Harry said, kissing your neck, nibbling at your earlobe. &ldquo;For two full fucking days&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You turned to face him, as he kissed you deeply, then left three or four smaller kisses gently to your lips with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, love,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;One last time before we go?&rdquo;</p><p>You giggled as Harry grabbed your hand, laughing all the way into the bedroom. In time, the moving van arrived and you and Harry packed everything inside of it, taking your things back to Harry&rsquo;s home&hellip;your new home with Harry. You were beyond happy.</p><p>*</p><p>For weeks you hadn&rsquo;t heard anything out of Michael and you hoped he was done harassing you. You obviously hadn&rsquo;t told him you moved from the apartment, but believing that your intruder was most likely him, his key would no longer work so you assumed he would figure it out eventually.</p><p>As you stepped out of the passenger side of the vehicle, Harry quickly made his way around the car, standing next to you and grabbing your hand as he walked you to the front door of the gallery. Your business was doing very well, you and Harry were beyond happy together, and you felt like you were finally almost yourself again. You still worked with Dr. Glen, but felt healthy again, even though you still knew your mind was a work in progress.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything looks good here,&rdquo; Harry said, handing you your coffee cup. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m going to get to my meeting, then I&rsquo;m going to do some writing this afternoon. You have anything on your agenda?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a ten o&rsquo;clock sculpting class,&rdquo; you grinned. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m hoping this afternoon I can work in the workshop for a while since Katie seems to be working out really well in here with the daily stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, she seems nice,&rdquo; Harry said. &ldquo;All right, love, I&rsquo;m going to get on then. Call if you need me. Nothing major for me today anyway. I&rsquo;ll bring us lunch in later before I go off to write, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds wonderful,&rdquo; you said, accepting his kiss and long hug. &ldquo;That feels so good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beyond good,&rdquo; he said, holding you a moment longer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here around one?&rdquo;</p><p><br />\nYou nodded and smiled as he kissed you quickly again, then hearing the front door and seeing Katie walk inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Harry said to her then turned again. &ldquo;See you in a few hours, baby. Love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Thankful. That&rsquo;s all you could say about your life finally becoming calm and more normal again. You were thankful to Dr. Glen for helping you work through the pieces of your mind that Michael had twisted into a knot of confusion and disorientation. You were forever thankful to Harry for staying by your side, being the perfect definition of what a best friend should really be. And you were thankful that Michael appeared to have finally given up on you and was leaving you alone. The restraining order Harry acquired to protect you may have helped with that, too, but still, you were thankful Michael was abiding by it. You didn&rsquo;t know where Michael had gone or what he was doing, and you didn&rsquo;t care, as long as he continued to stay far away from you and Harry. </p><p>You still struggled with thoughts in your mind about Michael. Thoughts that you worked on in every session with Dr. Glen. You understood now that Michael had said and done many things with the intent of manipulating you. But it was still difficult for you to see the depth of his deceit sometimes. You thought he must either be an amazing actor, or maybe some of his feelings for you were sincere. Although you knew you never loved him, you really had liked him as a person until things become too much. But&hellip;he did do things to you that proved it was not a healthy relationship, things that had put a fear in you toward him, and Dr. Glen and Harry both worked with you to help you see those things more clearly, helping you to find yourself again. Retraining your mind&hellip;that&rsquo;s what you were doing with their help, and you were extremely thankful Michael had apparently removed himself from the situation all together.</p><p>Having taught your only class scheduled that day, you cleaned the area again, then prepared your mind for the tasks of your afternoon. It was exciting to have been commissioned for a piece of art by another London gallery, known for showcasing other local artists. It was a badge of acceptance in your eyes that you were asked, and you wanted to make sure it was a perfect example of your work.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you mind if I leave a few minutes early for lunch? I have a lunch date,&rdquo; Katie smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmmm, same guy?&rdquo; you giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she grinned. &ldquo;Seems to be a good guy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; you smiled. &ldquo;Go ahead, it&rsquo;s fine. Harry should be here any minute with lunch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;See you in a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>You turned back around and looked through a couple of drawers, trying to find the tools you would need for the commission work you would begin on that afternoon. Hearing the door open, you hollered into the gallery.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the workshop, Harry!&rdquo;</p><p>You heard the footsteps walking through the gallery, across the stone floors, then walking behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Just in time,&rdquo; you said, pushing the drawer closed again. &ldquo;Katie just left for lunch, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing only footsteps, you turned as your smile dropped from your face, seeing Michael continuing his path toward you. Out of instinct you reached to the counter next to you, grabbing the sharp carving blade in your hand and holding it straight out in front of you, causing Michael to stop in his steps a few feet away.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, sweetheart,&rdquo; Michael smiled gently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve seen you. I just came to see how you&rsquo;re doing, see how the gallery is doing.&rdquo;</p><p>You saw how badly you were shaking, barely seeming a threat, but you knew the knife in your hand was sharp enough to leave a deep slice in anything it touched.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to leave,&rdquo; you stated firmly. &ldquo;I have security cameras everywhere, recording you being here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing nothing wrong. I&rsquo;m not hurting you. You&rsquo;re the only one who&rsquo;s threatening right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I know you too well,&rdquo; you spoke. &ldquo;Now leave, Michael.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I came here to see you, and I&rsquo;m going to. Now stop with this and put that away.&rdquo;</p><p>He began to step closer as you shakily held the blade closer to him, he retracting his step back again.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a restraining order on you,&rdquo; you announced. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re breaking the law by being here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, and I&rsquo;m sorry you felt you needed one against me,&rdquo; he saddened. &ldquo;I would never intentionally hurt you, sweetheart. This has all become such a mess. There&rsquo;s so much you don&rsquo;t know. I just want time to explain everything to you, so you don&rsquo;t hate me. I know you live with Harry now, I&rsquo;ve seen you together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My life is none of your business,&rdquo; you spoke more sternly, your eyes burning from the tears you were holding back, perspiration beginning to form on your brow and upper lip from your fear. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, my love&hellip;your life will always be my business,&rdquo; he swooned. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re in love with Harry, probably always have been. It explains a lot, honestly. But that doesn&rsquo;t change how I feel about you. I love you, probably too much, and I know if you would just give me a chance, you could love me, too. But even if you&rsquo;re with Harry, I&rsquo;ll always be around somewhere. That&rsquo;s how much I love you. You may not see me, or hear me, or even know I&rsquo;m there, but I will be, have to be&hellip;just like in your apartment. I was always there. Even the nights Harry was there with you.&rdquo;</p><p>You panted in your growing fear, holding the sharp chisel high at his throat-level, but not backing down.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you thrown in jail,&rdquo; you said more loudly as your voice wavered slightly. &ldquo;I know everything you did to me when we were dating. All of the mind tricks you played on me, making me think I was losing my mind. What kind of a person does that?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I can explain all of that, I swear. It wasn&rsquo;t my fault, I had to. You just don&rsquo;t understand. It wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;me&hellip;I mean, it was, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was you!&rdquo; you yelled shakily.</p><p>Harry heard your voice as he walked into the gallery, hearing the fear and strain in it, as he quietly closed the door behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;It was you! I know everything that you&rsquo;ve done to me!&rdquo; you cried, your arm shaking terribly toward him, nearly nicking him with the sharp cutting edge.</p><p>Harry quietly stepped through the gallery toward the workshop, peeking inside the doorway and seeing you holding the knife out in front of you, shaking terribly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never hurt you,&rdquo; Michael said calmly. &ldquo;Even the day you broke your arm. It wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;I mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip;you were here?&rdquo; you questioned, Harry seeing the look of confusion slowly overcoming your face, but keeping the knife toward Michael.</p><p>&ldquo;I just need to explain&hellip;tell you everything,&rdquo; Michael said, seeing you slowly letting down your guard. &ldquo;I never wanted you to get hurt&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; you said, shaking your head and holding the tool high. &ldquo;I remember now. You <i>were</i> here. You&hellip;you tried to force me to leave with you. But I&hellip;I fought you&hellip;and&hellip;threatened to yell to anyone who could hear that you were kidnapping me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You gasped as you suddenly saw Harry attack Michael from behind.</p><p>&ldquo;You stay the fuck away from her!&rdquo; Harry yelled, as the two men fought.</p><p>Losing the shock of what you were seeing, you reached for the silent alarm button under the cabinet ledge and backed into the corner. You saw Michael kick at Harry, trying to separate himself from him, pulling on the leg of a nearby stool and toppling it onto Harry. Feeling the release of Harry&rsquo;s hands on him, Michael ran for the door.</p><p>Harry quickly got to his feet, running to the doorway but seeing Michael had already disappeared out the front door of the building. Looking back to where you were standing, white as a ghost and still shaking, Harry ran to you. Pulling you into his arms, kissing your face over and over, he held you tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you all right? Did he hurt you?&rdquo; Harry asked, looking over your body for signs of blood or trauma.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; you said, clutching him tightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Police!&rdquo; you both heard from the other room.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in here!&rdquo; Harry shouted back, as you saw them walk into the room.</p><p>You and Harry described everything that happened, Harry requesting enforcement of the restraining order. Deciding there had been enough excitement for the day, Harry called Katie, giving her the rest of the day off, feeling it best he should take you home. He walked to where you were, sitting down next to you and pulling your hand into his, kissing it.</p><p>&ldquo;I remembered,&rdquo; you said quietly, as he looked to you, knowing you were pleased. Something that had happened to you made sense, and you had remembered what had happened.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Harry grinned lightly. &ldquo;You did well, baby.&rdquo;</p>",

She would even go as far as consider Anne a good friend. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that they are filthy rich and Violet virtually has nothing.</p><p>Really, it\u2019s not that Violet thinks they\u2019re stuck up. They are possibly the nicest people on Earth from what she\u2019s gathered. It\u2019s just&hellip;they seem to be in a different world than she\u2019s in. It\u2019s not like Violet didn\u2019t take notice of the different variations of Prada bags Anne owned. Or the fact that her trainers were Gucci. It\u2019s just very hard for her <i>not</i> to notice these things and Violet doesn\u2019t want to go to their probably lavish house looking&hellip;poor.</p><!-- more --><p>She slams her head down on her textbook with a groan. She can\u2019t focus. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that Probability and Statistics is the most useless subject. Both are likely.</p><p>\u201cHoney, is that a new way of taking in knowledge? Man, how the times have changed.\u201d</p><p>Violet turns her face towards the door where her father stood. She shot him a weak smile and he chucked before coming into her room and lying across her bed. She wishes she could do that, but she genuinely needs to stay at this desk until she finishes these questions.</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d</p><p>Violet picks her head up and rests it on her hand, her elbow supporting the weight. Her dad smiles at her and says, \u201cthat\u2019d be pretty cool, to be frank.\u201d She chuckles at him. Her dad is so&hellip;cool? Is that the word? She isn\u2019t sure. But she does know that he gets her better than anyone.</p><p>Violet heard a soft knock on her room door and turns to find her mum. She makes her way into the room to the lie against her husband. Violet can\u2019t help but admire her parents&rsquo; relationship. They met after university and if she recalls the story correctly her father was with someone else at the time. Her dad was just starting up and photocopying business and her mom was new to Cheshire.</p><p>They quite literally ran into each other with their trolleys at the Sainsbury\u2019s midtown. After a few awkward apologies, the pair realised how funny the situation was. They traded numbers soon after that. It wasn\u2019t long after meeting her mom that her father left his previous girlfriend. After spending so much time with her, showing her around town, and taking her for some burgers at Jamie Oliver\u2019s in nearby Manchester, he just knew he had to be with her forever.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look so worried, hon?\u201d</p><p>Violet wants to cry hearing her mums soft tone. Being at university away from her parents is truly a blessing and she is grateful for it, the privacy and the peace and the freedom, but it will never fill her heart the way being home does. To have these two people who love and care for her unconditionally is really what she needed right now. Especially with her final exams creeping up on her.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cJust really tired of bloody maths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a break. You\u2019ve been in here since you got back from work,\u201d her father suggests.</p><p>She shakes her head in disagreement. \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got dinner at&hellip;a friends house tonight and I need to finish now so I can spend tomorrow studying for my Anatomy and Physiology exam.\u201d</p><p>Her parents hum in understanding. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave then and let you work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She coughs in embarrassment at her outburst. \u201cPlease stay. I haven\u2019t seen you two in so long.\u201d</p><p>Violet\u2019s mum smiles. \u201cWhose house are you having dinner at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Dad chimes in with, \u201cthe lady who always comes in the shop. Her kid\u2019s famous, innit? Singer, actor something like that.\u201d</p><p>Violet nods. \u201c&hellip;something like that.\u201d</p><p>This sets some kind of signal off in Violet\u2019s mum. \u201cWhat are you gonna wear? Is it a fancy dinner or just casual? What time are you going over? It\u2019s supposed to shower tonight? Let me check your suitcase.\u201d</p><p>Violet doesn\u2019t respond to any of her mums questions. She just looks at her dad with an amused expression and he responds with a shrug before whipping his ringing phone from his trousers.</p><p>\u201cIs the boy going to be there?\u201d She nods at her mums question. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to dress you up real nice.\u201d</p><p>Violet slouches in her chair. \u201cNo, mum. I\u2019m not trying to wow anyone. I don\u2019t really wanna go anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why not?\u201d Violet looks around the room before focusing in on the string coming from her trackie bottoms. She shrugs. \u201cIs it because&hellip;because of the m\u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie. I understand that.\u201d Her mum rubs her shoulder and she nods timidly. \u201cBut that\u2019s not an excuse not to go.\u201d And then she\u2019s digging away in Violet\u2019s luggage again.\u00a0</p><hr><p>When Violet said lavish house she didn\u2019t expect it to be parked up in a gated community. She had to give her driver&rsquo;s identification card to security so they could cross reference her name with the guest list. It was all quite odd. She\u2019s beginning to second question this whole ordeal.</p><p>Is she even dressed for the occasion?</p><p>\u00a0Some jeans, a tube top, and a cardigan. That should be good enough, right?</p><p>When she and her parents (who insisted on dropping her off) got to the house, they were gobsmacked. The front garden was riddled with the most beautiful arrangement of flowers, benches, and ferns. Their house was three stories and though it was large it still looked like&hellip;a home.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cJeffery!\u201d Violet\u2019s mum scolded. Violet laughed and opened her door. \u201cCall us when you\u2019re ready for us to come to get you.\u201d</p><p>She nods silently and exits the vehicle. As soon as she puts her foot down the front porch lights up. Anne steps out of the house with a smile and she sends a wave to the little family.</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in!\u201d</p><p>Violet hears the car turn off and she begins to panic. \u201cOh, they were just dropping me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense! Come on in!\u201d</p><p>Violet really hates this.</p><p>She\u2019s not embarrassed of her parents by any means. They hold the highest pedestal in her life. But she is constantly embarrassed <i>by</i> her parents, which is what she\u2019s worried about. Her dad is gonna tell that stupid nappy story again, she can sense it. And her mum is gonna compliment everything in sight. This is what they do. Thank goodness this wasn\u2019t happening at their house. Her father would literally show guests where Violet peed on the carpet when she was three.</p><p>\u201cLovely garden you have, Anne.\u201d</p><p>And so it begins.</p><p>Harry and Violet were across from each other at the massive table. Beside her was her mum and then on the other side was her dad. Beside Harry sat Anne.</p><p>Besides the scraping of utensils against glass and Violet\u2019s mum&rsquo;s occasional compliment, there wasn\u2019t much noise. Violet begins to wonder how Anne could possibly live here all by herself.</p><p>\u201cWow, and Violet you plan on studying for your postgraduate the fall after next?\u201d She nods at Anne. \u201cAmazing. This one here didn\u2019t even attempt his A-levels.\u201d</p><p>Violet smiles at Harry and when he returned it, her heart flipped. \u201cTrust me, you didn\u2019t miss anything,\u201d she says.</p><p>The conversation continued, her dad told the nappy story not once but twice. He even decided to mix it up and tell the story of how their first guinea pig peed on her. However, Violet is grateful that Anne is spitting out funny stories about Harry as well.</p><p>\u201cYou covered you mum in frogs because you thought it would help?\u201d Violet snorts out a laugh.</p><p>\u201cOkay, look. It was only three frogs and I thought if she saw how cool they were she wouldn\u2019t be scared of them anymore!\u201d</p><p>Violet laughs. \u201cWhere is the logic in that?\u201d</p><p>Harry just laughed and shook his head down at his plate. She kind of wants to see that smile forever.</p><hr><p>As Violet is digging into her pasta she feels a soft shove against her foot. She looks under the table just as Harry\u2019s foot stopped under his seat. When she glanced up at him he had a small smile on his face. He cocks his head towards the door. Violet smiles with a nod.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Right mum. We\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>Conversation abruptly came to a halt and all eyes are on the two. Anne wipes her mouth with a napkin. \u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFront room. I want Violet to review my album since she\u2019s never heard my music before.\u201d Harry addressed the situation in a mocking tone and Violet couldn\u2019t help but roll her eyes.</p><p>Anne smiled at the two. \u201cOkay then. Have fun. Sweet Creature is my favourite.\u201d</p><p>Violet nods and follows Harry away from the table and to the kitchen. A silence washes over them as they scrap leftovers from their plates into the bin. Violet watches his every move. She felt like she was on the verge of breaking something every two minutes, so maybe if she followed him around she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>As the pair were maneuvering around the small (large?) space, she couldn\u2019t help but notice the stark differences between their homes. Violet\u2019s parents\u2019 kitchen had a small bay window over the split sink. Her mum had these tiny teal coloured curtains up for privacy and a tomato planter that had been on the windowpane for the past four years that Violet\u2019s dad refuses to trash. They had an average white fridge, a dish drying rack on the side and a tiny two stool island in the centre. It was a very average kitchen. Chestnut cupboards and white laminate flooring. Violet liked their kitchen. But this kitchen\u2026Violet loved this kitchen.</p><p>The dim ceiling lights gave off a soft, golden glow that complemented the modern palm leaf wallpaper covering half of the kitchen. She noticed that the knobs on the hob, the cupboard handles, and even the silverware have gold bits in them. <i>It\u2019s probably real. </i>There were <i>two</i> iceboxes, both of them larger than Harry, had the same wood detail that was on the cupboards making them blend into the aesthetic of the room effortlessly. The second fridge, however, was see through and <i>only contained drinks</i>. Violet couldn\u2019t help but look around the room in wonder. It was insane how beautiful just a kitchen could be.</p><p>\u201cYou comin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Violet hears the amusement in Harry\u2019s voice before she sees it in his face. She could feel her cheeks heat. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He turns and she follows him, doing her best to avoid looking at anything except his back. She felt like it\u2019s almost a bit disrespectful to peep around anymore. Even though she had been invited over, she felt that he\u2019d had enough people trying to invade his life and she didn\u2019t want to be one of them.</p><p>Harry snagged his laptop from the couch in the centre of the second family room before sitting in that same spot. He patted the cushion next to him and sent Violet a grin. \u201cAlright, since everyone is so up my arse, you\u2019ll be the judge of my music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally, someone with taste,\u201d Violet huffs before flopping down in the spot beside him. He lets out one loud laugh while clicking around on his MacBook.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, glancing at her briefly before looking back at his laptop, \u201cthe first song I\u2019m gonna play for you here is Only Angel. It\u2019s one of my favourites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmkay.\u201d Violet watches as he sticks a headphone splitter into the laptop. He hands her a pair of headphones and she pushes them into her ears. She genuinely hopes his music is good because she can\u2019t fathom telling The Harry Styles his music is shit. Surely it isn\u2019t though. He\u2019s right, he has could a couple hundred thousand, probably a couple million, that love his voice so it can\u2019t be a fluke.</p><p>The song starts and instantly Violet feels transcended. Was this a choir, was this him? Was this God? Okay, that\u2019s a stretch, she knows, but already this piece sounded heavenly. Literally. There was such an ethereal, soft feel. Then,</p><p><i>Hey, hey!</i></p><p>Violet\u2019s eyes widen in surprise and she leaned back in the couch a bit shocked. The song bursts into a very heavy 70s rock-influenced track. She did not see that coming. Harry was eating it up. Someone outside of his family, producers, and bandmates is listening to his music and is going to give him actual feedback.</p><p><i>Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door </i></p><p><i>I got splinters in my knuckles crawling \u2018cross the floor </i></p><p><i>Couldn\u2019t take you home to mother in a skirt that short</i></p><p><i>But I think that\u2019s what I like about it</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>She\u2019s an angel.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Violet found herself almost frozen. This song was so\u2026sensual. It sounded like Harry was no stranger to the casual one-night stand. Violet wouldn\u2019t know, but from the way he\u2019s singing about it, it sounds like a divine and celestial experience.</p><p>When the song finished Violet let out a huff of air. She was taken aback. She wasn\u2019t expecting that. The Harry she listened to was maybe sixteen, seventeen and sang about first kisses. Because she hadn\u2019t kept up with him like everyone else in their little village, she didn\u2019t realise how much he\u2019d grown up.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he drags out. He\u2019s been waiting for a response for a minute or two. He won\u2019t admit it, but he hopes she likes it. Harry, since he first met her, found himself wanting to empress her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d she breaths heavily out of her mouth before turning to look Harry in the eye, \u201c\u2026yeah.\u201d</p><p>Harry frowns. \u201cNot your cup \u2018o tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she shouts, \u201cI mean, yeah. It\u2019s great. Its\u2026it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m just a bit shocked. This is the first time I\u2019ve heard, like, any of your music since, what was that album, Midnight Memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you like it.\u201d He says it as a statement and he\u2019s grinning now. She\u2019s kind of glad she was able to do that. \u201cRecorded it in one take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Harry. It\u2019s great. The contrast was amazing.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a bit of a giggle and Violet\u2019s heart swells. As he\u2019s pulling up the next song, Violet is studying him. He\u2019s got a mole by his lip and she reckons it\u2019s the cutest thing she\u2019s ever seen; besides the way he\u2019s pinching his bottom lip in concentration. She shouldn\u2019t be looking at him like this. Hasn\u2019t he got some supermodel girlfriend?</p><p>\u201cThis next one, it means a lot to me. It took me a while to finish it, but I think I like it.\u201d</p><p>Violet closes her eyes and lets her body relax into the sofa as the folk-rock tune surrounded her. Halfway through the song, she recognises that despite the upbeat tune, the lyrics are melancholy. She could sense some sort of disconnect and inability to move on.</p><p><i>Almost over, had enough from you</i></p><p><i>And I\u2019ve been prayin\u2019, I never did before </i></p><p><i>Understand I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to the walls</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ve been prayin\u2019 ever since New York. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Violet finds herself tearing up. She knows exactly who this is about.</p><p>She finds herself pulling the headphones off. She begins to wipe her eyes with the sleeve of her graphic t-shirt. Harry clicks pause and pulls his headphones out too.</p><p>\u201c\u2019S about Robin, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Harry has a sharp intake of air before nodding and looking down at the screen. He suddenly wishes he didn\u2019t play this song. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, the first part, really, but the second confirmed it. Sounds like you\u2019re talking to doctors or summat.\u201d He looks at her with wonder in his eyes. She continues. \u201c<i>Tell me something, you don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 just pretend you do,</i>\u201d she reads from the computer screen. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re talkin\u2019 to doctors. And then <i>choose your words cause there\u2019s no antidote for this curse, oh, what\u2019s it waiting for. Must this hurt you just before you go?</i>\u201d There\u2019s a silence. The kind where they can hear each other breathing. \u201cI just remember them coming in the shop all the time. Robin and your mum. Then they stopped coming. And then it was only her. Took a couple weeks, but she told me. I\u2026I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>Harry nods sending her a small smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she retaliates, \u201cfor trusting me. And not think it\u2019s weird that I know all the television shows you watched as a tot.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckles. \u201cReckon that\u2019s mums fault there.\u201d They laugh together.</p><p>Violet\u2019s never felt like this before. This feeling of peace in someone\u2019s presence that she hardly knew. She liked Harry. Maybe more than she should but that doesn\u2019t matter right now. What matters now is the gold flakes sparkling in his eyes and the way his lips looked like her favourite watermelon candy floss. She wonders if his lips taste like watermelon candy floss too.</p><p>\u201cCan I have yeh number?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She doesn\u2019t hesitate when she takes her mobile out her back pocket. This causes her to shuffle a bit closer to him, their knees now touching. She lays it softly in his hand and he gives her his. Even their phones are different. The iPhone X felt so luxurious in her. She can only guess what he\u2019s thinking about her 5S.</p><p>\u201cViolet, honey,\u201d Violet\u2019s mum rounds the corner with her dad and Anne, \u201cit\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Violet stands and hands Harry his phone back and vice versa. \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas nice meeting you too. Hopefully, I\u2019ll see you again soon.\u201d</p><p>Her heart flutters for the umpteenth time that night. She knows he knows what he\u2019s doing to her surly. She decides to be cheeky and responds with, \u201cyou will.\u201d</p><p>Anne and Harry see the family of three off and when Violet gets home she bids her parents good night and jogs to her room. She felt a smile on her face as she clambered into bed. And just as her head hit her pillow, just as her eyes shut and her breathing slowed, her phone buzzed. She picked it up, flinching at the harsh light. A smile stretched across her face when she read the text. She didn\u2019t know where this was going, but she didn\u2019t mind where it was at now.</p><p><b>Rockstar H: </b>lunch tomorrow? :)</p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>Keep up with the series <a href=\"https://tpwkwrites.tumblr.com/post/176417292295/new-series\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</i></b></p><p><b><i>Masterlist <a href=\"https://tpwkwrites.tumblr.com/post/176087154090/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</i></b></p>",

After spending so much time with her, showing her around town, and taking her for some burgers at Jamie Oliver\u2019s in nearby Manchester, he just knew he had to be with her forever.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look so worried, hon?\u201d</p><p>Violet wants to cry hearing her mums soft tone. Being at university away from her parents is truly a blessing and she is grateful for it, the privacy and the peace and the freedom, but it will never fill her heart the way being home does. To have these two people who love and care for her unconditionally is really what she needed right now. Especially with her final exams creeping up on her.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cJust really tired of bloody maths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a break. You\u2019ve been in here since you got back from work,\u201d her father suggests.</p><p>She shakes her head in disagreement. \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got dinner at\u2026a friends house tonight and I need to finish now so I can spend tomorrow studying for my Anatomy and Physiology exam.\u201d</p><p>Her parents hum in understanding. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave then and let you work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She coughs in embarrassment at her outburst. \u201cPlease stay. I haven\u2019t seen you two in so long.\u201d</p><p>Violet\u2019s mum smiles. \u201cWhose house are you having dinner at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Dad chimes in with, \u201cthe lady who always comes in the shop. Her kid\u2019s famous, innit? Singer, actor something like that.\u201d</p><p>Violet nods. \u201c\u2026something like that.\u201d</p><p>This sets some kind of signal off in Violet\u2019s mum. \u201cWhat are you gonna wear? Is it a fancy dinner or just casual? What time are you going over? It\u2019s supposed to shower tonight? Let me check your suitcase.\u201d</p><p>Violet doesn\u2019t respond to any of her mums questions. She just looks at her dad with an amused expression and he responds with a shrug before whipping his ringing phone from his trousers.</p><p>\u201cIs the boy going to be there?\u201d She nods at her mums question. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to dress you up real nice.\u201d</p><p>Violet slouches in her chair. \u201cNo, mum. I\u2019m not trying to wow anyone. I don\u2019t really wanna go anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why not?\u201d Violet looks around the room before focusing in on the string coming from her trackie bottoms. She shrugs. \u201cIs it because\u2026because of the m\u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie. I understand that.\u201d Her mum rubs her shoulder and she nods timidly. \u201cBut that\u2019s not an excuse not to go.\u201d And then she\u2019s digging away in Violet\u2019s luggage again.\u00a0</p><hr><p>When Violet said lavish house she didn\u2019t expect it to be parked up in a gated community. She had to give her driver\u2019s identification card to security so they could cross reference her name with the guest list. It was all quite odd. She\u2019s beginning to second question this whole ordeal.</p><p>Is she even dressed for the occasion?</p><p>\u00a0Some jeans, a tube top, and a cardigan. That should be good enough, right?</p><p>When she and her parents (who insisted on dropping her off) got to the house, they were gobsmacked. The front garden was riddled with the most beautiful arrangement of flowers, benches, and ferns. Their house was three stories and though it was large it still looked like\u2026a home.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cJeffery!\u201d Violet\u2019s mum scolded. Violet laughed and opened her door. \u201cCall us when you\u2019re ready for us to come to get you.\u201d</p><p>She nods silently and exits the vehicle. As soon as she puts her foot down the front porch lights up. Anne steps out of the house with a smile and she sends a wave to the little family.</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in!\u201d</p><p>Violet hears the car turn off and she begins to panic. \u201cOh, they were just dropping me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense! Come on in!\u201d</p><p>Violet really hates this.</p><p>She\u2019s not embarrassed of her parents by any means. They hold the highest pedestal in her life. But she is constantly embarrassed <i>by</i> her parents, which is what she\u2019s worried about. Her dad is gonna tell that stupid nappy story again, she can sense it. And her mum is gonna compliment everything in sight. This is what they do. Thank goodness this wasn\u2019t happening at their house. Her father would literally show guests where Violet peed on the carpet when she was three.</p><p>\u201cLovely garden you have, Anne.\u201d</p><p>And so it begins.</p><p>Harry and Violet were across from each other at the massive table. Beside her was her mum and then on the other side was her dad. Beside Harry sat Anne.</p><p>Besides the scraping of utensils against glass and Violet\u2019s mum\u2019s occasional compliment, there wasn\u2019t much noise. Violet begins to wonder how Anne could possibly live here all by herself.</p><p>\u201cWow, and Violet you plan on studying for your postgraduate the fall after next?\u201d She nods at Anne. \u201cAmazing. This one here didn\u2019t even attempt his A-levels.\u201d</p><p>Violet smiles at Harry and when he returned it, her heart flipped. \u201cTrust me, you didn\u2019t miss anything,\u201d she says.</p><p>The conversation continued, her dad told the nappy story not once but twice. He even decided to mix it up and tell the story of how their first guinea pig peed on her. However, Violet is grateful that Anne is spitting out funny stories about Harry as well.</p><p>\u201cYou covered you mum in frogs because you thought it would help?\u201d Violet snorts out a laugh.</p><p>\u201cOkay, look. It was only three frogs and I thought if she saw how cool they were she wouldn\u2019t be scared of them anymore!\u201d</p><p>Violet laughs. \u201cWhere is the logic in that?\u201d</p><p>Harry just laughed and shook his head down at his plate. She kind of wants to see that smile forever.</p><hr><p>As Violet is digging into her pasta she feels a soft shove against her foot. She looks under the table just as Harry\u2019s foot stopped under his seat. When she glanced up at him he had a small smile on his face. He cocks his head towards the door. Violet smiles with a nod.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Right mum. We\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>Conversation abruptly came to a halt and all eyes are on the two. Anne wipes her mouth with a napkin. \u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFront room. I want Violet to review my album since she\u2019s never heard my music before.\u201d Harry addressed the situation in a mocking tone and Violet couldn\u2019t help but roll her eyes.</p><p>Anne smiled at the two. \u201cOkay then. Have fun. Sweet Creature is my favourite.\u201d</p><p>Violet nods and follows Harry away from the table and to the kitchen. A silence washes over them as they scrap leftovers from their plates into the bin. Violet watches his every move. She felt like she was on the verge of breaking something every two minutes, so maybe if she followed him around she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>As the pair were maneuvering around the small (large?) space, she couldn\u2019t help but notice the stark differences between their homes. Violet\u2019s parents\u2019 kitchen had a small bay window over the split sink. Her mum had these tiny teal coloured curtains up for privacy and a tomato planter that had been on the windowpane for the past four years that Violet\u2019s dad refuses to trash. They had an average white fridge, a dish drying rack on the side and a tiny two stool island in the centre. It was a very average kitchen. Chestnut cupboards and white laminate flooring. Violet liked their kitchen. But this kitchen\u2026Violet loved this kitchen.</p><p>The dim ceiling lights gave off a soft, golden glow that complemented the modern palm leaf wallpaper covering half of the kitchen. She noticed that the knobs on the hob, the cupboard handles, and even the silverware have gold bits in them. <i>It\u2019s probably real. </i>There were <i>two</i> iceboxes, both of them larger than Harry, had the same wood detail that was on the cupboards making them blend into the aesthetic of the room effortlessly. The second fridge, however, was see through and <i>only contained drinks</i>. Violet couldn\u2019t help but look around the room in wonder. It was insane how beautiful just a kitchen could be.</p><p>\u201cYou comin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Violet hears the amusement in Harry\u2019s voice before she sees it in his face. She could feel her cheeks heat. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He turns and she follows him, doing her best to avoid looking at anything except his back. She felt like it\u2019s almost a bit disrespectful to peep around anymore. Even though she had been invited over, she felt that he\u2019d had enough people trying to invade his life and she didn\u2019t want to be one of them.</p><p>Harry snagged his laptop from the couch in the centre of the second family room before sitting in that same spot. He patted the cushion next to him and sent Violet a grin. \u201cAlright, since everyone is so up my arse, you\u2019ll be the judge of my music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally, someone with taste,\u201d Violet huffs before flopping down in the spot beside him. He lets out one loud laugh while clicking around on his MacBook.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, glancing at her briefly before looking back at his laptop, \u201cthe first song I\u2019m gonna play for you here is Only Angel. It\u2019s one of my favourites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmkay.\u201d Violet watches as he sticks a headphone splitter into the laptop. He hands her a pair of headphones and she pushes them into her ears. She genuinely hopes his music is good because she can\u2019t fathom telling The Harry Styles his music is shit. Surely it isn\u2019t though. He\u2019s right, he has could a couple hundred thousand, probably a couple million, that love his voice so it can\u2019t be a fluke.</p><p>The song starts and instantly Violet feels transcended. Was this a choir, was this him? Was this God? Okay, that\u2019s a stretch, she knows, but already this piece sounded heavenly. Literally. There was such an ethereal, soft feel. Then,</p><p><i>Hey, hey!</i></p><p>Violet\u2019s eyes widen in surprise and she leaned back in the couch a bit shocked. The song bursts into a very heavy 70s rock-influenced track. She did not see that coming. Harry was eating it up. Someone outside of his family, producers, and bandmates is listening to his music and is going to give him actual feedback.</p><p><i>Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door </i></p><p><i>I got splinters in my knuckles crawling \u2018cross the floor </i></p><p><i>Couldn\u2019t take you home to mother in a skirt that short</i></p><p><i>But I think that\u2019s what I like about it</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>She\u2019s an angel.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Violet found herself almost frozen. This song was so\u2026sensual. It sounded like Harry was no stranger to the casual one-night stand. Violet wouldn\u2019t know, but from the way he\u2019s singing about it, it sounds like a divine and celestial experience.</p><p>When the song finished Violet let out a huff of air. She was taken aback. She wasn\u2019t expecting that. The Harry she listened to was maybe sixteen, seventeen and sang about first kisses. Because she hadn\u2019t kept up with him like everyone else in their little village, she didn\u2019t realise how much he\u2019d grown up.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he drags out. He\u2019s been waiting for a response for a minute or two. He won\u2019t admit it, but he hopes she likes it. Harry, since he first met her, found himself wanting to empress her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d she breaths heavily out of her mouth before turning to look Harry in the eye, \u201c\u2026yeah.\u201d</p><p>Harry frowns. \u201cNot your cup \u2018o tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she shouts, \u201cI mean, yeah. It\u2019s great. Its\u2026it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m just a bit shocked. This is the first time I\u2019ve heard, like, any of your music since, what was that album, Midnight Memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you like it.\u201d He says it as a statement and he\u2019s grinning now. She\u2019s kind of glad she was able to do that. \u201cRecorded it in one take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Harry. It\u2019s great. The contrast was amazing.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a bit of a giggle and Violet\u2019s heart swells. As he\u2019s pulling up the next song, Violet is studying him. He\u2019s got a mole by his lip and she reckons it\u2019s the cutest thing she\u2019s ever seen; besides the way he\u2019s pinching his bottom lip in concentration. She shouldn\u2019t be looking at him like this. Hasn\u2019t he got some supermodel girlfriend?</p><p>\u201cThis next one, it means a lot to me. It took me a while to finish it, but I think I like it.\u201d</p><p>Violet closes her eyes and lets her body relax into the sofa as the folk-rock tune surrounded her. Halfway through the song, she recognises that despite the upbeat tune, the lyrics are melancholy. She could sense some sort of disconnect and inability to move on.</p><p><i>Almost over, had enough from you</i></p><p><i>And I\u2019ve been prayin\u2019, I never did before </i></p><p><i>Understand I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to the walls</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ve been prayin\u2019 ever since New York. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Violet finds herself tearing up. She knows exactly who this is about.</p><p>She finds herself pulling the headphones off. She begins to wipe her eyes with the sleeve of her graphic t-shirt. Harry clicks pause and pulls his headphones out too.</p><p>\u201c\u2019S about Robin, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Harry has a sharp intake of air before nodding and looking down at the screen. He suddenly wishes he didn\u2019t play this song. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, the first part, really, but the second confirmed it. Sounds like you\u2019re talking to doctors or summat.\u201d He looks at her with wonder in his eyes. She continues. \u201c<i>Tell me something, you don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 just pretend you do,</i>\u201d she reads from the computer screen. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re talkin\u2019 to doctors. And then <i>choose your words cause there\u2019s no antidote for this curse, oh, what\u2019s it waiting for. Must this hurt you just before you go?</i>\u201d There\u2019s a silence. The kind where they can hear each other breathing. \u201cI just remember them coming in the shop all the time. Robin and your mum. Then they stopped coming. And then it was only her. Took a couple weeks, but she told me. I\u2026I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>Harry nods sending her a small smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she retaliates, \u201cfor trusting me. And not think it\u2019s weird that I know all the television shows you watched as a tot.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckles. \u201cReckon that\u2019s mums fault there.\u201d They laugh together.</p><p>Violet\u2019s never felt like this before. This feeling of peace in someone\u2019s presence that she hardly knew. She liked Harry. Maybe more than she should but that doesn\u2019t matter right now. What matters now is the gold flakes sparkling in his eyes and the way his lips looked like her favourite watermelon candy floss. She wonders if his lips taste like watermelon candy floss too.</p><p>\u201cCan I have yeh number?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She doesn\u2019t hesitate when she takes her mobile out her back pocket. This causes her to shuffle a bit closer to him, their knees now touching. She lays it softly in his hand and he gives her his. Even their phones are different. The iPhone X felt so luxurious in her. She can only guess what he\u2019s thinking about her 5S.</p><p>\u201cViolet, honey,\u201d Violet\u2019s mum rounds the corner with her dad and Anne, \u201cit\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Violet stands and hands Harry his phone back and vice versa. \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas nice meeting you too. Hopefully, I\u2019ll see you again soon.\u201d</p><p>Her heart flutters for the umpteenth time that night. She knows he knows what he\u2019s doing to her surly. She decides to be cheeky and responds with, \u201cyou will.\u201d</p><p>Anne and Harry see the family of three off and when Violet gets home she bids her parents good night and jogs to her room. She felt a smile on her face as she clambered into bed. And just as her head hit her pillow, just as her eyes shut and her breathing slowed, her phone buzzed. She picked it up, flinching at the harsh light. A smile stretched across her face when she read the text. She didn\u2019t know where this was going, but she didn\u2019t mind where it was at now.</p><p><b>Rockstar H: </b>lunch tomorrow? :)</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>Keep up with the series <a href=\"https://tpwkwrites.tumblr.com/post/176417292295/new-series\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</i></b></p><p><b><i>Masterlist <a href=\"https://tpwkwrites.tumblr.com/post/176087154090/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</i></b></p>",

She would even go as far as consider Anne a good friend. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that they are filthy rich and Violet virtually has nothing.</p><p>Really, it\u2019s not that Violet thinks they\u2019re stuck up. They are possibly the nicest people on Earth from what she\u2019s gathered. It\u2019s just\u2026they seem to be in a different world than she\u2019s in. It\u2019s not like Violet didn\u2019t take notice of the different variations of Prada bags Anne owned. Or the fact that her trainers were Gucci. It\u2019s just very hard for her <i>not</i> to notice these things and Violet doesn\u2019t want to go to their probably lavish house looking\u2026poor.</p>[[MORE]]<p>She slams her head down on her textbook with a groan. She can\u2019t focus. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that Probability and Statistics is the most useless subject. Both are likely.</p><p>\u201cHoney, is that a new way of taking in knowledge? Man, how the times have changed.\u201d</p><p>Violet turns her face towards the door where her father stood. She shot him a weak smile and he chucked before coming into her room and lying across her bed. She wishes she could do that, but she genuinely needs to stay at this desk until she finishes these questions.</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d</p><p>Violet picks her head up and rests it on her hand, her elbow supporting the weight. Her dad smiles at her and says, \u201cthat\u2019d be pretty cool, to be frank.\u201d She chuckles at him. Her dad is so\u2026cool? Is that the word? She isn\u2019t sure. But she does know that he gets her better than anyone.</p><p>Violet heard a soft knock on her room door and turns to find her mum. She makes her way into the room to the lie against her husband. Violet can\u2019t help but admire her parents\u2019 relationship. They met after university and if she recalls the story correctly her father was with someone else at the time. Her dad was just starting up and photocopying business and her mom was new to Cheshire.</p><p>They quite literally ran into each other with their trolleys at the Sainsbury\u2019s midtown. After a few awkward apologies, the pair realised how funny the situation was. They traded numbers soon after that. It wasn\u2019t long after meeting her mom that her father left his previous girlfriend. After spending so much time with her, showing her around town, and taking her for some burgers at Jamie Oliver\u2019s in nearby Manchester, he just knew he had to be with her forever.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look so worried, hon?\u201d</p><p>Violet wants to cry hearing her mums soft tone. Being at university away from her parents is truly a blessing and she is grateful for it, the privacy and the peace and the freedom, but it will never fill her heart the way being home does. To have these two people who love and care for her unconditionally is really what she needed right now. Especially with her final exams creeping up on her.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cJust really tired of bloody maths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a break. You\u2019ve been in here since you got back from work,\u201d her father suggests.</p><p>She shakes her head in disagreement. \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got dinner at\u2026a friends house tonight and I need to finish now so I can spend tomorrow studying for my Anatomy and Physiology exam.\u201d</p><p>Her parents hum in understanding. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave then and let you work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She coughs in embarrassment at her outburst. \u201cPlease stay. I haven\u2019t seen you two in so long.\u201d</p><p>Violet\u2019s mum smiles. \u201cWhose house are you having dinner at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Dad chimes in with, \u201cthe lady who always comes in the shop. Her kid\u2019s famous, innit? Singer, actor something like that.\u201d</p><p>Violet nods. \u201c\u2026something like that.\u201d</p><p>This sets some kind of signal off in Violet\u2019s mum. \u201cWhat are you gonna wear? Is it a fancy dinner or just casual? What time are you going over? It\u2019s supposed to shower tonight? Let me check your suitcase.\u201d</p><p>Violet doesn\u2019t respond to any of her mums questions. She just looks at her dad with an amused expression and he responds with a shrug before whipping his ringing phone from his trousers.</p><p>\u201cIs the boy going to be there?\u201d She nods at her mums question. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to dress you up real nice.\u201d</p><p>Violet slouches in her chair. \u201cNo, mum. I\u2019m not trying to wow anyone. I don\u2019t really wanna go anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why not?\u201d Violet looks around the room before focusing in on the string coming from her trackie bottoms. She shrugs. \u201cIs it because\u2026because of the m\u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie. I understand that.\u201d Her mum rubs her shoulder and she nods timidly. \u201cBut that\u2019s not an excuse not to go.\u201d And then she\u2019s digging away in Violet\u2019s luggage again.\u00a0</p><hr><p>When Violet said lavish house she didn\u2019t expect it to be parked up in a gated community. She had to give her driver\u2019s identification card to security so they could cross reference her name with the guest list. It was all quite odd. She\u2019s beginning to second question this whole ordeal.</p><p>Is she even dressed for the occasion?</p><p>\u00a0Some jeans, a tube top, and a cardigan. That should be good enough, right?</p><p>When she and her parents (who insisted on dropping her off) got to the house, they were gobsmacked. The front garden was riddled with the most beautiful arrangement of flowers, benches, and ferns. Their house was three stories and though it was large it still looked like\u2026a home.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cJeffery!\u201d Violet\u2019s mum scolded. Violet laughed and opened her door. \u201cCall us when you\u2019re ready for us to come to get you.\u201d</p><p>She nods silently and exits the vehicle. As soon as she puts her foot down the front porch lights up. Anne steps out of the house with a smile and she sends a wave to the little family.</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in!\u201d</p><p>Violet hears the car turn off and she begins to panic. \u201cOh, they were just dropping me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense! Come on in!\u201d</p><p>Violet really hates this.</p><p>She\u2019s not embarrassed of her parents by any means. They hold the highest pedestal in her life. But she is constantly embarrassed <i>by</i> her parents, which is what she\u2019s worried about. Her dad is gonna tell that stupid nappy story again, she can sense it. And her mum is gonna compliment everything in sight. This is what they do. Thank goodness this wasn\u2019t happening at their house. Her father would literally show guests where Violet peed on the carpet when she was three.</p><p>\u201cLovely garden you have, Anne.\u201d</p><p>And so it begins.</p><p>Harry and Violet were across from each other at the massive table. Beside her was her mum and then on the other side was her dad. Beside Harry sat Anne.</p><p>Besides the scraping of utensils against glass and Violet\u2019s mum\u2019s occasional compliment, there wasn\u2019t much noise. Violet begins to wonder how Anne could possibly live here all by herself.</p><p>\u201cWow, and Violet you plan on studying for your postgraduate the fall after next?\u201d She nods at Anne. \u201cAmazing. This one here didn\u2019t even attempt his A-levels.\u201d</p><p>Violet smiles at Harry and when he returned it, her heart flipped. \u201cTrust me, you didn\u2019t miss anything,\u201d she says.</p><p>The conversation continued, her dad told the nappy story not once but twice. He even decided to mix it up and tell the story of how their first guinea pig peed on her. However, Violet is grateful that Anne is spitting out funny stories about Harry as well.</p><p>\u201cYou covered you mum in frogs because you thought it would help?\u201d Violet snorts out a laugh.</p><p>\u201cOkay, look. It was only three frogs and I thought if she saw how cool they were she wouldn\u2019t be scared of them anymore!\u201d</p><p>Violet laughs. \u201cWhere is the logic in that?\u201d</p><p>Harry just laughed and shook his head down at his plate. She kind of wants to see that smile forever.</p><hr><p>As Violet is digging into her pasta she feels a soft shove against her foot. She looks under the table just as Harry\u2019s foot stopped under his seat. When she glanced up at him he had a small smile on his face. He cocks his head towards the door. Violet smiles with a nod.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Right mum. We\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>Conversation abruptly came to a halt and all eyes are on the two. Anne wipes her mouth with a napkin. \u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFront room. I want Violet to review my album since she\u2019s never heard my music before.\u201d Harry addressed the situation in a mocking tone and Violet couldn\u2019t help but roll her eyes.</p><p>Anne smiled at the two. \u201cOkay then. Have fun. Sweet Creature is my favourite.\u201d</p><p>Violet nods and follows Harry away from the table and to the kitchen. A silence washes over them as they scrap leftovers from their plates into the bin. Violet watches his every move. She felt like she was on the verge of breaking something every two minutes, so maybe if she followed him around she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>As the pair were maneuvering around the small (large?) space, she couldn\u2019t help but notice the stark differences between their homes. Violet\u2019s parents\u2019 kitchen had a small bay window over the split sink. Her mum had these tiny teal coloured curtains up for privacy and a tomato planter that had been on the windowpane for the past four years that Violet\u2019s dad refuses to trash. They had an average white fridge, a dish drying rack on the side and a tiny two stool island in the centre. It was a very average kitchen. Chestnut cupboards and white laminate flooring. Violet liked their kitchen. But this kitchen\u2026Violet loved this kitchen.</p><p>The dim ceiling lights gave off a soft, golden glow that complemented the modern palm leaf wallpaper covering half of the kitchen. She noticed that the knobs on the hob, the cupboard handles, and even the silverware have gold bits in them. <i>It\u2019s probably real. </i>There were <i>two</i> iceboxes, both of them larger than Harry, had the same wood detail that was on the cupboards making them blend into the aesthetic of the room effortlessly. The second fridge, however, was see through and <i>only contained drinks</i>. Violet couldn\u2019t help but look around the room in wonder. It was insane how beautiful just a kitchen could be.</p><p>\u201cYou comin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Violet hears the amusement in Harry\u2019s voice before she sees it in his face. She could feel her cheeks heat. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He turns and she follows him, doing her best to avoid looking at anything except his back. She felt like it\u2019s almost a bit disrespectful to peep around anymore. Even though she had been invited over, she felt that he\u2019d had enough people trying to invade his life and she didn\u2019t want to be one of them.</p><p>Harry snagged his laptop from the couch in the centre of the second family room before sitting in that same spot. He patted the cushion next to him and sent Violet a grin. \u201cAlright, since everyone is so up my arse, you\u2019ll be the judge of my music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally, someone with taste,\u201d Violet huffs before flopping down in the spot beside him. He lets out one loud laugh while clicking around on his MacBook.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, glancing at her briefly before looking back at his laptop, \u201cthe first song I\u2019m gonna play for you here is Only Angel. It\u2019s one of my favourites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmkay.\u201d Violet watches as he sticks a headphone splitter into the laptop. He hands her a pair of headphones and she pushes them into her ears. She genuinely hopes his music is good because she can\u2019t fathom telling The Harry Styles his music is shit. Surely it isn\u2019t though. He\u2019s right, he has could a couple hundred thousand, probably a couple million, that love his voice so it can\u2019t be a fluke.</p><p>The song starts and instantly Violet feels transcended. Was this a choir, was this him? Was this God? Okay, that\u2019s a stretch, she knows, but already this piece sounded heavenly. Literally. There was such an ethereal, soft feel. Then,</p><p><i>Hey, hey!</i></p><p>Violet\u2019s eyes widen in surprise and she leaned back in the couch a bit shocked. The song bursts into a very heavy 70s rock-influenced track. She did not see that coming. Harry was eating it up. Someone outside of his family, producers, and bandmates is listening to his music and is going to give him actual feedback.</p><p><i>Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door </i></p><p><i>I got splinters in my knuckles crawling \u2018cross the floor </i></p><p><i>Couldn\u2019t take you home to mother in a skirt that short</i></p><p><i>But I think that\u2019s what I like about it</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>She\u2019s an angel.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Violet found herself almost frozen. This song was so\u2026sensual. It sounded like Harry was no stranger to the casual one-night stand. Violet wouldn\u2019t know, but from the way he\u2019s singing about it, it sounds like a divine and celestial experience.</p><p>When the song finished Violet let out a huff of air. She was taken aback. She wasn\u2019t expecting that. The Harry she listened to was maybe sixteen, seventeen and sang about first kisses. Because she hadn\u2019t kept up with him like everyone else in their little village, she didn\u2019t realise how much he\u2019d grown up.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he drags out. He\u2019s been waiting for a response for a minute or two. He won\u2019t admit it, but he hopes she likes it. Harry, since he first met her, found himself wanting to empress her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d she breaths heavily out of her mouth before turning to look Harry in the eye, \u201c\u2026yeah.\u201d</p><p>Harry frowns. \u201cNot your cup \u2018o tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she shouts, \u201cI mean, yeah. It\u2019s great. Its\u2026it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m just a bit shocked. This is the first time I\u2019ve heard, like, any of your music since, what was that album, Midnight Memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you like it.\u201d He says it as a statement and he\u2019s grinning now. She\u2019s kind of glad she was able to do that. \u201cRecorded it in one take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Harry. It\u2019s great. The contrast was amazing.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a bit of a giggle and Violet\u2019s heart swells. As he\u2019s pulling up the next song, Violet is studying him. He\u2019s got a mole by his lip and she reckons it\u2019s the cutest thing she\u2019s ever seen; besides the way he\u2019s pinching his bottom lip in concentration. She shouldn\u2019t be looking at him like this. Hasn\u2019t he got some supermodel girlfriend?</p><p>\u201cThis next one, it means a lot to me. It took me a while to finish it, but I think I like it.\u201d</p><p>Violet closes her eyes and lets her body relax into the sofa as the folk-rock tune surrounded her. Halfway through the song, she recognises that despite the upbeat tune, the lyrics are melancholy. She could sense some sort of disconnect and inability to move on.</p><p><i>Almost over, had enough from you</i></p><p><i>And I\u2019ve been prayin\u2019, I never did before </i></p><p><i>Understand I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to the walls</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ve been prayin\u2019 ever since New York. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Violet finds herself tearing up. She knows exactly who this is about.</p><p>She finds herself pulling the headphones off. She begins to wipe her eyes with the sleeve of her graphic t-shirt. Harry clicks pause and pulls his headphones out too.</p><p>\u201c\u2019S about Robin, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Harry has a sharp intake of air before nodding and looking down at the screen. He suddenly wishes he didn\u2019t play this song. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, the first part, really, but the second confirmed it. Sounds like you\u2019re talking to doctors or summat.\u201d He looks at her with wonder in his eyes. She continues. \u201c<i>Tell me something, you don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 just pretend you do,</i>\u201d she reads from the computer screen. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re talkin\u2019 to doctors. And then <i>choose your words cause there\u2019s no antidote for this curse, oh, what\u2019s it waiting for. Must this hurt you just before you go?</i>\u201d There\u2019s a silence. The kind where they can hear each other breathing. \u201cI just remember them coming in the shop all the time. Robin and your mum. Then they stopped coming. And then it was only her. Took a couple weeks, but she told me. I\u2026I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>Harry nods sending her a small smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she retaliates, \u201cfor trusting me. And not think it\u2019s weird that I know all the television shows you watched as a tot.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckles. \u201cReckon that\u2019s mums fault there.\u201d They laugh together.</p><p>Violet\u2019s never felt like this before. This feeling of peace in someone\u2019s presence that she hardly knew. She liked Harry. Maybe more than she should but that doesn\u2019t matter right now. What matters now is the gold flakes sparkling in his eyes and the way his lips looked like her favourite watermelon candy floss. She wonders if his lips taste like watermelon candy floss too.</p><p>\u201cCan I have yeh number?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She doesn\u2019t hesitate when she takes her mobile out her back pocket. This causes her to shuffle a bit closer to him, their knees now touching. She lays it softly in his hand and he gives her his. Even their phones are different. The iPhone X felt so luxurious in her. She can only guess what he\u2019s thinking about her 5S.</p><p>\u201cViolet, honey,\u201d Violet\u2019s mum rounds the corner with her dad and Anne, \u201cit\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Violet stands and hands Harry his phone back and vice versa. \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas nice meeting you too. Hopefully, I\u2019ll see you again soon.\u201d</p><p>Her heart flutters for the umpteenth time that night. She knows he knows what he\u2019s doing to her surly. She decides to be cheeky and responds with, \u201cyou will.\u201d</p><p>Anne and Harry see the family of three off and when Violet gets home she bids her parents good night and jogs to her room. She felt a smile on her face as she clambered into bed. And just as her head hit her pillow, just as her eyes shut and her breathing slowed, her phone buzzed. She picked it up, flinching at the harsh light. A smile stretched across her face when she read the text. She didn\u2019t know where this was going, but she didn\u2019t mind where it was at now.</p><p><b>Rockstar H: </b>lunch tomorrow? :)</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>Keep up with the series <a href=\"https://tpwkwrites.tumblr.com/post/176417292295/new-series\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</i></b></p><p><b><i>Masterlist <a href=\"https://tpwkwrites.tumblr.com/post/176087154090/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</i></b></p>",

She would even go as far as consider Anne a good friend. But that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that they are filthy rich and Violet virtually has nothing.</p><p>Really, it&rsquo;s not that Violet thinks they&rsquo;re stuck up. They are possibly the nicest people on Earth from what she&rsquo;s gathered. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;they seem to be in a different world than she&rsquo;s in. It&rsquo;s not like Violet didn&rsquo;t take notice of the different variations of Prada bags Anne owned. Or the fact that her trainers were Gucci. It&rsquo;s just very hard for her <i>not</i> to notice these things and Violet doesn&rsquo;t want to go to their probably lavish house looking&hellip;poor.</p><p>She slams her head down on her textbook with a groan. She can&rsquo;t focus. Or maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that Probability and Statistics is the most useless subject. Both are likely.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, is that a new way of taking in knowledge? Man, how the times have changed.&rdquo;</p><p>Violet turns her face towards the door where her father stood. She shot him a weak smile and he chucked before coming into her room and lying across her bed. She wishes she could do that, but she genuinely needs to stay at this desk until she finishes these questions.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish.&rdquo;</p><p>Violet picks her head up and rests it on her hand, her elbow supporting the weight. Her dad smiles at her and says, &ldquo;that&rsquo;d be pretty cool, to be frank.&rdquo; She chuckles at him. Her dad is so&hellip;cool? Is that the word? She isn&rsquo;t sure. But she does know that he gets her better than anyone.</p><p>Violet heard a soft knock on her room door and turns to find her mum. She makes her way into the room to the lie against her husband. Violet can&rsquo;t help but admire her parents&rsquo; relationship. They met after university and if she recalls the story correctly her father was with someone else at the time. Her dad was just starting up and photocopying business and her mom was new to Cheshire.</p><p>They quite literally ran into each other with their trolleys at the Sainsbury&rsquo;s midtown. After a few awkward apologies, the pair realised how funny the situation was. They traded numbers soon after that. It wasn&rsquo;t long after meeting her mom that her father left his previous girlfriend. After spending so much time with her, showing her around town, and taking her for some burgers at Jamie Oliver&rsquo;s in nearby Manchester, he just knew he had to be with her forever.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you look so worried, hon?&rdquo;</p><p>Violet wants to cry hearing her mums soft tone. Being at university away from her parents is truly a blessing and she is grateful for it, the privacy and the peace and the freedom, but it will never fill her heart the way being home does. To have these two people who love and care for her unconditionally is really what she needed right now. Especially with her final exams creeping up on her.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Just really tired of bloody maths.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take a break. You&rsquo;ve been in here since you got back from work,&rdquo; her father suggests.</p><p>She shakes her head in disagreement. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve got dinner at&hellip;a friends house tonight and I need to finish now so I can spend tomorrow studying for my Anatomy and Physiology exam.&rdquo;</p><p>Her parents hum in understanding. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave then and let you work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; She coughs in embarrassment at her outburst. &ldquo;Please stay. I haven&rsquo;t seen you two in so long.&rdquo;</p><p>Violet&rsquo;s mum smiles. &ldquo;Whose house are you having dinner at?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anne&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>Dad chimes in with, &ldquo;the lady who always comes in the shop. Her kid&rsquo;s famous, innit? Singer, actor something like that.&rdquo;</p><p>Violet nods. &ldquo;&hellip;something like that.&rdquo;</p><p>This sets some kind of signal off in Violet&rsquo;s mum. &ldquo;What are you gonna wear? Is it a fancy dinner or just casual? What time are you going over? It&rsquo;s supposed to shower tonight? Let me check your suitcase.&rdquo;</p><p>Violet doesn&rsquo;t respond to any of her mums questions. She just looks at her dad with an amused expression and he responds with a shrug before whipping his ringing phone from his trousers.</p><p>&ldquo;Is the boy going to be there?&rdquo; She nods at her mums question. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to dress you up real nice.&rdquo;</p><p>Violet slouches in her chair. &ldquo;No, mum. I&rsquo;m not trying to wow anyone. I don&rsquo;t really wanna go anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; Violet looks around the room before focusing in on the string coming from her trackie bottoms. She shrugs. &ldquo;Is it because&hellip;because of the m&ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, mum.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, sweetie.

She felt like she was on the verge of breaking something every two minutes, so maybe if she followed him around she wouldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>As the pair were maneuvering around the small (large?) space, she couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the stark differences between their homes. Violet&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; kitchen had a small bay window over the split sink. Her mum had these tiny teal coloured curtains up for privacy and a tomato planter that had been on the windowpane for the past four years that Violet&rsquo;s dad refuses to trash. They had an average white fridge, a dish drying rack on the side and a tiny two stool island in the centre. It was a very average kitchen. Chestnut cupboards and white laminate flooring. Violet liked their kitchen. But this kitchen&hellip;Violet loved this kitchen.</p><p>The dim ceiling lights gave off a soft, golden glow that complemented the modern palm leaf wallpaper covering half of the kitchen. She noticed that the knobs on the hob, the cupboard handles, and even the silverware have gold bits in them. <i>It&rsquo;s probably real. </i>There were <i>two</i> iceboxes, both of them larger than Harry, had the same wood detail that was on the cupboards making them blend into the aesthetic of the room effortlessly. The second fridge, however, was see through and <i>only contained drinks</i>. Violet couldn&rsquo;t help but look around the room in wonder. It was insane how beautiful just a kitchen could be.</p><p>&ldquo;You comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>Violet hears the amusement in Harry&rsquo;s voice before she sees it in his face. She could feel her cheeks heat. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>He turns and she follows him, doing her best to avoid looking at anything except his back. She felt like it&rsquo;s almost a bit disrespectful to peep around anymore. Even though she had been invited over, she felt that he&rsquo;d had enough people trying to invade his life and she didn&rsquo;t want to be one of them.</p><p>Harry snagged his laptop from the couch in the centre of the second family room before sitting in that same spot. He patted the cushion next to him and sent Violet a grin. &ldquo;Alright, since everyone is so up my arse, you&rsquo;ll be the judge of my music.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Finally, someone with taste,&rdquo; Violet huffs before flopping down in the spot beside him. He lets out one loud laugh while clicking around on his MacBook.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he says, glancing at her briefly before looking back at his laptop, &ldquo;the first song I&rsquo;m gonna play for you here is Only Angel. It&rsquo;s one of my favourites.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmkay.&rdquo; Violet watches as he sticks a headphone splitter into the laptop. He hands her a pair of headphones and she pushes them into her ears. She genuinely hopes his music is good because she can&rsquo;t fathom telling The Harry Styles his music is shit. Surely it isn&rsquo;t though. He&rsquo;s right, he has could a couple hundred thousand, probably a couple million, that love his voice so it can&rsquo;t be a fluke.</p><p>The song starts and instantly Violet feels transcended. Was this a choir, was this him? Was this God? Okay, that&rsquo;s a stretch, she knows, but already this piece sounded heavenly. Literally. There was such an ethereal, soft feel. Then,</p><p><i>Hey, hey!</i></p><p>Violet&rsquo;s eyes widen in surprise and she leaned back in the couch a bit shocked. The song bursts into a very heavy 70s rock-influenced track. She did not see that coming. Harry was eating it up. Someone outside of his family, producers, and bandmates is listening to his music and is going to give him actual feedback.</p><p><i>Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door </i></p><p><i>I got splinters in my knuckles crawling &lsquo;cross the floor </i></p><p><i>Couldn&rsquo;t take you home to mother in a skirt that short</i></p><p><i>But I think that&rsquo;s what I like about it</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>She&rsquo;s an angel.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Violet found herself almost frozen. This song was so&hellip;sensual. It sounded like Harry was no stranger to the casual one-night stand. Violet wouldn&rsquo;t know, but from the way he&rsquo;s singing about it, it sounds like a divine and celestial experience.</p><p>When the song finished Violet let out a huff of air. She was taken aback. She wasn&rsquo;t expecting that. The Harry she listened to was maybe sixteen, seventeen and sang about first kisses. Because she hadn&rsquo;t kept up with him like everyone else in their little village, she didn&rsquo;t realise how much he&rsquo;d grown up.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he drags out. He&rsquo;s been waiting for a response for a minute or two. He won&rsquo;t admit it, but he hopes she likes it. Harry, since he first met her, found himself wanting to empress her.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; she breaths heavily out of her mouth before turning to look Harry in the eye, &ldquo;&hellip;yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry frowns. &ldquo;Not your cup &lsquo;o tea?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she shouts, &ldquo;I mean, yeah. It&rsquo;s great. Its&hellip;it&rsquo;s amazing. I&rsquo;m just a bit shocked. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve heard, like, any of your music since, what was that album, Midnight Memories.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, you like it.&rdquo; He says it as a statement and he&rsquo;s grinning now. She&rsquo;s kind of glad she was able to do that. &ldquo;Recorded it in one take.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Harry. It&rsquo;s great. The contrast was amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>He lets out a bit of a giggle and Violet&rsquo;s heart swells. As he&rsquo;s pulling up the next song, Violet is studying him. He&rsquo;s got a mole by his lip and she reckons it&rsquo;s the cutest thing she&rsquo;s ever seen; besides the way he&rsquo;s pinching his bottom lip in concentration. She shouldn&rsquo;t be looking at him like this. Hasn&rsquo;t he got some supermodel girlfriend?</p><p>&ldquo;This next one, it means a lot to me. It took me a while to finish it, but I think I like it.&rdquo;</p><p>Violet closes her eyes and lets her body relax into the sofa as the folk-rock tune surrounded her. Halfway through the song, she recognises that despite the upbeat tune, the lyrics are melancholy. She could sense some sort of disconnect and inability to move on.</p><p><i>Almost over, had enough from you</i></p><p><i>And I&rsquo;ve been prayin&rsquo;, I never did before </i></p><p><i>Understand I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; to the walls</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;ve been prayin&rsquo; ever since New York. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Violet finds herself tearing up. She knows exactly who this is about.</p><p>She finds herself pulling the headphones off. She begins to wipe her eyes with the sleeve of her graphic t-shirt. Harry clicks pause and pulls his headphones out too.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;S about Robin, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry has a sharp intake of air before nodding and looking down at the screen. He suddenly wishes he didn&rsquo;t play this song. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, the first part, really, but the second confirmed it. Sounds like you&rsquo;re talking to doctors or summat.&rdquo; He looks at her with wonder in his eyes. She continues. &ldquo;<i>Tell me something, you don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; just pretend you do,</i>&rdquo; she reads from the computer screen. &ldquo;Sounds like you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; to doctors. And then <i>choose your words cause there&rsquo;s no antidote for this curse, oh, what&rsquo;s it waiting for. Must this hurt you just before you go?</i>&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a silence. The kind where they can hear each other breathing. &ldquo;I just remember them coming in the shop all the time. Robin and your mum. Then they stopped coming. And then it was only her. Took a couple weeks, but she told me. I&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry for your loss.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry nods sending her a small smile. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she retaliates, &ldquo;for trusting me. And not think it&rsquo;s weird that I know all the television shows you watched as a tot.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry chuckles. &ldquo;Reckon that&rsquo;s mums fault there.&rdquo; They laugh together.</p><p>Violet&rsquo;s never felt like this before. This feeling of peace in someone&rsquo;s presence that she hardly knew. She liked Harry. Maybe more than she should but that doesn&rsquo;t matter right now. What matters now is the gold flakes sparkling in his eyes and the way his lips looked like her favourite watermelon candy floss. She wonders if his lips taste like watermelon candy floss too.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I have yeh number?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t hesitate when she takes her mobile out her back pocket. This causes her to shuffle a bit closer to him, their knees now touching. She lays it softly in his hand and he gives her his. Even their phones are different. The iPhone X felt so luxurious in her. She can only guess what he&rsquo;s thinking about her 5S.</p><p>&ldquo;Violet, honey,&rdquo; Violet&rsquo;s mum rounds the corner with her dad and Anne, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Violet stands and hands Harry his phone back and vice versa. &ldquo;It was nice meeting you, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was nice meeting you too. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll see you again soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Her heart flutters for the umpteenth time that night. She knows he knows what he&rsquo;s doing to her surly. She decides to be cheeky and responds with, &ldquo;you will.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne and Harry see the family of three off and when Violet gets home she bids her parents good night and jogs to her room. She felt a smile on her face as she clambered into bed. And just as her head hit her pillow, just as her eyes shut and her breathing slowed, her phone buzzed. She picked it up, flinching at the harsh light. A smile stretched across her face when she read the text. She didn&rsquo;t know where this was going, but she didn&rsquo;t mind where it was at now.</p><p><b>Rockstar H: </b>lunch tomorrow? :)</p><p><br /></p><p><b><i>Keep up with the series <a href=\"https://tpwkwrites.tumblr.com/post/176417292295/new-series\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</i></b></p><p><b><i>Masterlist <a href=\"https://tpwkwrites.tumblr.com/post/176087154090/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</i></b></p>",

Bom, (antes de qualquer coisa, quero dizer que meu pedido foi inspirado no relacionamento da personagem Sophia de &ldquo;GIRLBOSS&rdquo;). Eu gostaria que voc\u00ea fizesse um com o H, que ele e a S/N tem um relacionamento &lsquo;casual&rsquo;, s\u00f3 que pra ela nunca foi t\u00e3o 'casual&rsquo; assim. Dai, ela vai at\u00e9 a gravadora, onde ele tava gravando, encontrar com ele, s\u00f3 que se depara com a seguinte situa\u00e7\u00e3o: uma das integrante da banda do H, est\u00e1 'chupando ele&rsquo;. Ela termina com ele. Se voc\u00ea j\u00e1 tiver assistido &ldquo;girlboss&rdquo; acredito que vai ser f\u00e1cil, caso nunca assistiu, assista o ep 12, vai te ajudar. Desculpa se ficou confuso.

A quem eu quero enganar, eu sabia que era tempo suficiente para perder todas as pessoas poss\u00edveis, mas n\u00e3o pensei que eu fosse perd\u00ea-lo. N\u00e3o, definitivamente quem me perdeu foi ele.</i></p><p><i>No momento que eu tive certeza do que meus olhos viam, eu lentamente levei minha m\u00e3o ao bolso traseiro da minha cal\u00e7a - t\u00e3o devagar quanto eu pude, talvez com medo deles notarem a minha presen\u00e7a a qualquer movimento brusco - desbloqueei a tela e meu dedo de forma \u00e1gil clicou sobre o aplicativo de c\u00e2mera. Eu iria film\u00e1-los, os pervertidos de plant\u00e3o me agradeceriam por um porn\u00f4 t\u00e3o safado e natural, eles devem adorar uma vadia caindo de boca em um traidor.</i></p><p><i>Antes mesmo de come\u00e7ar a filmar, a maldita consci\u00eancia me fez congelar, eu n\u00e3o podia fazer isso, mesmo que o sangue ferva em minhas veias e o sabor da vingan\u00e7a me deixe com \u00e1gua na boca, eu estaria sendo mais baixa do que aquele traidor e a vadia ajoelhada na frente dele. Engolindo o \u00f3dio crescendo no meu peito, eu apenas guardei o celular no bolso e dei as costas saindo daquele lugar antes que eu vomitasse.</i></p><p><i>Se querem um conselho, tomem cuidado com quem dorme ao seu lado. Ele ou ela, pode est\u00e1 te apunhalando pelas costas sem o menor remorso, digo isso porque o safado traidor est\u00e1 agora do meu lado roncando na minha cama.</i></p><p>Depois de clicar no enviar e esperar a postagem carregar no blog, eu fecho o meu notebook o deixando de lado sobre a minha escrivaninha, mais uma vez me viro para olhar Harry esparramado na minha cama e a imagem dele com a cabe\u00e7a jogada para tr\u00e1s gemendo enquanto a vadia chupava o pau dele ate engasgar voltou a minha mente. Eu juro que estou lutando contra a vontade de pegar o travesseiro e mat\u00e1-lo asfixiado.</p><p>Eu achei que o que t\u00ednhamos era mais forte do que uma vadia qualquer, eu estou errada em cham\u00e1-la de vadia, ela n\u00e3o me devia nada enquanto ele me devia pelo menos considera\u00e7\u00e3o, v\u00ea-lo dormir ao meu lado tranquilamente s\u00f3 me mostra que ele n\u00e3o tem um pingo de remorso.</p><p>No \u00faltimo m\u00eas eu passei completamente devotada a escrever o meu livro, estava empenhada a realizar o meu sonho de ter um conto completo escrito por mim e talvez at\u00e9 public\u00e1-lo caso alguma editora goste, Harry sabia o qu\u00e3o importante era eu ter esse tempo s\u00f3 para mim, ele me apoiou, disse que me entendia perfeitamente porque ele sentia a mesma coisa pela m\u00fasica dele. Mentiroso, ele n\u00e3o me entendia coisa nenhuma.</p><p>Eu compreendi as noites que ele passou no est\u00fadio gravando o \u00e1lbum dele, eu dormi sozinha, o liguei toda noite para desejar boa noite e o recebia quando ele chegava. Na minha vez, quando eu ficava escrevendo no terra\u00e7o do pr\u00e9dio at\u00e9 de madrugada e s\u00f3 ia para cama quando eu literalmente dormia sentada na frente do notebook, ele ainda tentava me fazer aceitar fazer sexo, talvez seja por isso que ele estava adorando aquela vadia, eu n\u00e3o estava dando o que ele queria.</p><p>A pergunta que n\u00e3o quer calar&hellip; Ele estava mesmo gravando o \u00e1lbum todas as noites que ficou fora? Antes eu n\u00e3o tinha d\u00favida, agora eu n\u00e3o coloco minha m\u00e3o no fogo por ele.</p><p>\u2014 Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o vai dormir? \u2014 a voz rouca entrou em meus ouvidos e s\u00f3 ent\u00e3o percebi que eu estava o encarando igual uma psicopata.</p><p>\u2014 Estou sem sono&hellip; Muito caf\u00e9. \u2014 ou talvez sua imagem sendo chupado esteja me atormentando.</p><p>\u2014 Deite aqui, viciada. \u2014 ele bateu de leve no travesseiro ao seu lado. \u00a0O sorriso pregui\u00e7oso em seu rosto em outros tempos me faria sorrir tamb\u00e9m, mas no momento apenas n\u00e3o sei o que sentir ent\u00e3o me deitei ao lado dele deixando que me cobrisse com a coberta felpuda.</p><p>\u2014 Voc\u00ea quer me contar o que fez hoje? Qual o progresso do seu livro? \u2014 seu corpo pr\u00f3ximo ao meu me deixa ainda mais irritada, a m\u00e1goa crescendo por ele ser um mentiroso.</p><p>\u2014 Bloqueio criativo. \u2014 respondi simplesmente, se eu mantivesse minha boca aberta por tempo demais eu jogarei tudo na cara dele.</p><p>\u2014 Voc\u00ea est\u00e1 t\u00e3o calada, geralmente voc\u00ea fala pelos cotovelos sobre o seu livro. \u2014 ele riu baixo.</p><p>\u2014 E voc\u00ea? O que fez hoje? Se divertiu no est\u00fadio? Eu aposto que sim. \u2014 direcionei meu olhar em dire\u00e7\u00e3o aos seus olhos e vi que ele ficou desconfort\u00e1vel.</p><p>\u2014 Nada demais, estamos compondo m\u00fasicas novas.</p><p>\u2014 Geralmente voc\u00ea fala pelos cotovelos sobre seu trabalho no est\u00fadio. \u2014 ok, eu estou fazendo joguinho, mas em minha defesa, eu s\u00f3 quero que ele me diga a verdade.</p><p>\u2014 Voc\u00ea est\u00e1 estranha hoje&hellip;</p><p>\u2014 N\u00e3o \u00e9 nada&hellip; S\u00f3 estava andando por a\u00ed e dei de cara com um porn\u00f4 vagabundo, daqueles mal feito e bem amador.</p><p>\u2014 N\u00e3o sabia que voc\u00ea assistia esse tipo de coisa&hellip; \u2014 ele se mexeu e deitou de barriga para cima olhando para o teto.</p><p>\u2014 Eu n\u00e3o assisto, pode ter certeza, mas eu queria ver o qu\u00e3o fundo a vadia conseguia enfiar o pau do safado. Ela parecia ser t\u00e3o experiente. \u2014 olhei bem fixamente seu rosto mudar de express\u00e3o.</p><p>\u2014 Precisa mesmo dar detalhes? \u2014 ele me olhou, sobrancelhas franzidas.</p><p>\u2014 Eu nem disse ainda que o cen\u00e1rio era um est\u00fadio e que eu assisti ao vivo. \u2014 eu assistir seu rosto mudar de cor, ele realmente n\u00e3o esperava por essa.</p><p>\u2014 Voc\u00ea viu aquilo? (Seu nome), eu posso explicar! \u2014 ele se sentou de frente para mim t\u00e3o r\u00e1pido quanto falou a frase.</p><p>\u2014 Explicar? Eu n\u00e3o quero uma explica\u00e7\u00e3o. \u2014 bati em sua m\u00e3o quando ele tentou me tocar e me sentei na cama.</p><p>\u2014 N\u00e3o \u00e9 nada do que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 pensando, aconteceu s\u00f3 essa vez. \u2014 quando eu ia me levantar da cama Harry segurou minha m\u00e3o entre as suas \u2014 Por favor me escuta!</p><p>\u2014 Que diferen\u00e7a faz ser uma ou duas vezes? \u2014 olho seu rosto e n\u00e3o posso deixar de rir quando percebo que ele realmente acha que faz diferen\u00e7a \u2014 Eu poderia pensar no seu caso se voc\u00ea tivesse chegado nervoso me contando o que tinha feito.

A quem eu quero enganar, eu sabia que era tempo suficiente para perder todas as pessoas poss\u00edveis, mas n\u00e3o pensei que eu fosse perd\u00ea-lo. N\u00e3o, definitivamente quem me perdeu foi ele.</i></p><p><i>No momento que eu tive certeza do que meus olhos viam, eu lentamente levei minha m\u00e3o ao bolso traseiro da minha cal\u00e7a - t\u00e3o devagar quanto eu pude, talvez com medo deles notarem a minha presen\u00e7a a qualquer movimento brusco - desbloqueei a tela e meu dedo de forma \u00e1gil clicou sobre o aplicativo de c\u00e2mera. Eu iria film\u00e1-los, os pervertidos de plant\u00e3o me agradeceriam por um porn\u00f4 t\u00e3o safado e natural, eles devem adorar uma vadia caindo de boca em um traidor.</i></p><p><i>Antes mesmo de come\u00e7ar a filmar, a maldita consci\u00eancia me fez congelar, eu n\u00e3o podia fazer isso, mesmo que o sangue ferva em minhas veias e o sabor da vingan\u00e7a me deixe com \u00e1gua na boca, eu estaria sendo mais baixa do que aquele traidor e a vadia ajoelhada na frente dele. Engolindo o \u00f3dio crescendo no meu peito, eu apenas guardei o celular no bolso e dei as costas saindo daquele lugar antes que eu vomitasse.</i></p><p><i>Se querem um conselho, tomem cuidado com quem dorme ao seu lado. Ele ou ela, pode est\u00e1 te apunhalando pelas costas sem o menor remorso, digo isso porque o safado traidor est\u00e1 agora do meu lado roncando na minha cama.</i></p><p>Depois de clicar no enviar e esperar a postagem carregar no blog, eu fecho o meu notebook o deixando de lado sobre a minha escrivaninha, mais uma vez me viro para olhar Harry esparramado na minha cama e a imagem dele com a cabe\u00e7a jogada para tr\u00e1s gemendo enquanto a vadia chupava o pau dele ate engasgar voltou a minha mente. Eu juro que estou lutando contra a vontade de pegar o travesseiro e mat\u00e1-lo asfixiado.</p><p>Eu achei que o que t\u00ednhamos era mais forte do que uma vadia qualquer, eu estou errada em cham\u00e1-la de vadia, ela n\u00e3o me devia nada enquanto ele me devia pelo menos considera\u00e7\u00e3o, v\u00ea-lo dormir ao meu lado tranquilamente s\u00f3 me mostra que ele n\u00e3o tem um pingo de remorso.</p><p>No \u00faltimo m\u00eas eu passei completamente devotada a escrever o meu livro, estava empenhada a realizar o meu sonho de ter um conto completo escrito por mim e talvez at\u00e9 public\u00e1-lo caso alguma editora goste, Harry sabia o qu\u00e3o importante era eu ter esse tempo s\u00f3 para mim, ele me apoiou, disse que me entendia perfeitamente porque ele sentia a mesma coisa pela m\u00fasica dele. Mentiroso, ele n\u00e3o me entendia coisa nenhuma.</p><p>Eu compreendi as noites que ele passou no est\u00fadio gravando o \u00e1lbum dele, eu dormi sozinha, o liguei toda noite para desejar boa noite e o recebia quando ele chegava. Na minha vez, quando eu ficava escrevendo no terra\u00e7o do pr\u00e9dio at\u00e9 de madrugada e s\u00f3 ia para cama quando eu literalmente dormia sentada na frente do notebook, ele ainda tentava me fazer aceitar fazer sexo, talvez seja por isso que ele estava adorando aquela vadia, eu n\u00e3o estava dando o que ele queria.</p><p>A pergunta que n\u00e3o quer calar\u2026 Ele estava mesmo gravando o \u00e1lbum todas as noites que ficou fora? Antes eu n\u00e3o tinha d\u00favida, agora eu n\u00e3o coloco minha m\u00e3o no fogo por ele.</p><p>\u2014 Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o vai dormir? \u2014 a voz rouca entrou em meus ouvidos e s\u00f3 ent\u00e3o percebi que eu estava o encarando igual uma psicopata.</p><p>\u2014 Estou sem sono\u2026 Muito caf\u00e9. \u2014 ou talvez sua imagem sendo chupado esteja me atormentando.</p><p>\u2014 Deite aqui, viciada. \u2014 ele bateu de leve no travesseiro ao seu lado. \u00a0O sorriso pregui\u00e7oso em seu rosto em outros tempos me faria sorrir tamb\u00e9m, mas no momento apenas n\u00e3o sei o que sentir ent\u00e3o me deitei ao lado dele deixando que me cobrisse com a coberta felpuda.</p><p>\u2014 Voc\u00ea quer me contar o que fez hoje? Qual o progresso do seu livro? \u2014 seu corpo pr\u00f3ximo ao meu me deixa ainda mais irritada, a m\u00e1goa crescendo por ele ser um mentiroso.</p><p>\u2014 Bloqueio criativo. \u2014 respondi simplesmente, se eu mantivesse minha boca aberta por tempo demais eu jogarei tudo na cara dele.</p><p>\u2014 Voc\u00ea est\u00e1 t\u00e3o calada, geralmente voc\u00ea fala pelos cotovelos sobre o seu livro. \u2014 ele riu baixo.</p><p>\u2014 E voc\u00ea? O que fez hoje? Se divertiu no est\u00fadio? Eu aposto que sim. \u2014 direcionei meu olhar em dire\u00e7\u00e3o aos seus olhos e vi que ele ficou desconfort\u00e1vel.</p><p>\u2014 Nada demais, estamos compondo m\u00fasicas novas.</p><p>\u2014 Geralmente voc\u00ea fala pelos cotovelos sobre seu trabalho no est\u00fadio. \u2014 ok, eu estou fazendo joguinho, mas em minha defesa, eu s\u00f3 quero que ele me diga a verdade.</p><p>\u2014 Voc\u00ea est\u00e1 estranha hoje\u2026</p><p>\u2014 N\u00e3o \u00e9 nada\u2026 S\u00f3 estava andando por a\u00ed e dei de cara com um porn\u00f4 vagabundo, daqueles mal feito e bem amador.</p><p>\u2014 N\u00e3o sabia que voc\u00ea assistia esse tipo de coisa\u2026 \u2014 ele se mexeu e deitou de barriga para cima olhando para o teto.</p><p>\u2014 Eu n\u00e3o assisto, pode ter certeza, mas eu queria ver o qu\u00e3o fundo a vadia conseguia enfiar o pau do safado. Ela parecia ser t\u00e3o experiente. \u2014 olhei bem fixamente seu rosto mudar de express\u00e3o.</p><p>\u2014 Precisa mesmo dar detalhes? \u2014 ele me olhou, sobrancelhas franzidas.</p><p>\u2014 Eu nem disse ainda que o cen\u00e1rio era um est\u00fadio e que eu assisti ao vivo. \u2014 eu assistir seu rosto mudar de cor, ele realmente n\u00e3o esperava por essa.</p><p>\u2014 Voc\u00ea viu aquilo? (Seu nome), eu posso explicar! \u2014 ele se sentou de frente para mim t\u00e3o r\u00e1pido quanto falou a frase.</p><p>\u2014 Explicar? Eu n\u00e3o quero uma explica\u00e7\u00e3o. \u2014 bati em sua m\u00e3o quando ele tentou me tocar e me sentei na cama.</p><p>\u2014 N\u00e3o \u00e9 nada do que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 pensando, aconteceu s\u00f3 essa vez. \u2014 quando eu ia me levantar da cama Harry segurou minha m\u00e3o entre as suas \u2014 Por favor me escuta!</p><p>\u2014 Que diferen\u00e7a faz ser uma ou duas vezes? \u2014 olho seu rosto e n\u00e3o posso deixar de rir quando percebo que ele realmente acha que faz diferen\u00e7a \u2014 Eu poderia pensar no seu caso se voc\u00ea tivesse chegado nervoso me contando o que tinha feito. Voc\u00ea escondeu, ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o pretendia me contar.</p><p>\u2014 Eu tive medo! \u2014 soltei minha m\u00e3o das suas e ele levou-as at\u00e9 seu cabelo rec\u00e9m cortado \u2014 Eu gosto tanto de voc\u00ea, (seu nome).</p><p>\u2014 N\u00e3o o suficiente para manter o p\u00eanis dentro da cal\u00e7a. \u2014 finalmente me levantei da cama e apontei para a porta do quarto \u2014 V\u00e1 embora! </p><p>\u2014 (Seu nome)\u2026</p><p>\u2014 V\u00e1, Harry! \u2014 isso j\u00e1 estava me irritando \u2014 N\u00e3o torne as coisas piores, n\u00e3o fa\u00e7a eu detestar voc\u00ea.
