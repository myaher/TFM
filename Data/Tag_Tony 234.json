You rolled your eyes, taking a seat in the rusty police car. </p><p>The ride to the police station was long and annoying. Growing up in a small town, you knew almost everyone who lived there and everyone knew you. At least they thought they did. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this, Y/N!\u201d Your gaze moved from the car window to the review mirror, your eyes locking with the ones of the man driving the car. \u201cI understand you\u2019re going through stuff. But come on, ever since Lucy died, you\u2019ve been acting like you just left the jungle. It\u2019s time for you to start acting a bit more mature!\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes, tired of your mother popping up in every other conversation you led. Ever since she died, it felt like everyone was pitying you. You didn\u2019t know why though, it\u2019s not like their pity would change anything.</p><p>After her death, you started living with your aunt, since your mother never bothered to tell anyone who your father was. You didn\u2019t mind, though. You could get by on your own, but apparently, you had to be older than 18 to do so.</p><p>Entering the small cell, you turned around letting the policeman take your handkerchiefs off. \u201cThanks, Tim.\u201d you said, turning towards the little wooden bench before taking a seat there. After a while, you got real bored and lost track of time, tempted to find a sharp item to carve something stupid like \u201cY/N WAS HERE.\u201d on the walls or the floor. Or both. Maybe even the ugly bench you were sat on. On the second thought, the whole place smelled like Dave, the local drunk who got arrested every night for almost cracking someone\u2019s skull open when things escalate at the bar.  You sighed, leaning your head against the cold wall behind you.</p><p>Maybe you fell asleep, because the next thing you heard was Tim\u2019s voice. \u201cY/N, don\u2019t freak out.\u201d You arched an eyebrow at him, suppressing a yawn. \u201cYour father will be the one to bail you out.\u201d Eyebrows furrowing closer together, you started laughing hysterically. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d he continued, trying to be louder than your outburst. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here any minute now.\u201d You stopped laughing. \u201cHow the hell did you find him now? Where the fuck was he for the past 16 years?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You can ask him yourself. I just found a letter from a social worker, saying your mother left a note with his information around the time you were born, in case something happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need some drunk with no self respect, who missed out on my whole life, to just march in and rescue me from Dave\u2019s second home.\u201d you scoffed. \u201cJust call my aunt to pick me up and I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo can do, Y/N. Give the man a chance.\u201d He left, leaving you alone to roll your eyes at the thought of the incoming encounter. You didn\u2019t need him to wander in here and save you like a damsel in distress. What happened with the past 16 years? This isn\u2019t the first time you got in trouble.</p><p>You heard the door open and Tim talk to someone. Raising an eyebrow in their direction, you tried to eavesdrop but failed. Next thing you know, the cell door is opening and Tim is standing there staring at you. \u201cHe signed the release forms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all this time, you\u2019re just gonna let some stranger take me? What if he\u2019s like a serial killer? What if I <i>never get to tell you I told you so </i>after he kills me?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes holding the door open for you. You entered the room and saw the last person you expected sitting by the desk. \u201cOh this is some kind of a joke.\u201d, you scoffed. </p><p>Tony froze, his heart beating so fast like it was trying to escape his chest. First impressions matter after all \u201cYou must be Y/N. Hi, I\u2019m Tony.\u201d</p><p>Tim took a plastic bag and emptied the containing items on the table. \u201cAnd here\u2019s your stuff Y/N, you are free to go.\u201d </p><p>You shot a sharpe glance in the direction of the man behind the table. \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know you\u2019re only doing things because you\u2019re sick of me.\u201d </p><p>You unexpectedly strolled out the place, causing Tony to slightly run beside you. \u201cHey, Y/N!\u201d he called, causing you to turn around.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked frowning.</p><p>\u201cC-can you come with me please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d he said, holding his car door open. Your rolled your eyes, and entered the vehicle slamming the door shut. Tony frowned, but still felt a huge weight fall off his shoulders. He ran around the car and quickly entered his side.</p><p>Another boring drive from your boring home town to wherever the hell he was leading you. You kept your eyes on the road the whole time, not allowing yourself to look in his direction. Catching glimpse of a watch, you realised the two of you were driving for almost three hours. Finally, you broke the heavy silence. \u201cSo you\u2019re not even close as talkative as you are on TV.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, feeling the tension build up in his shoulders. He didn\u2019t want to mess this up. When he got the call few hours ago, he thought it was a prank or something. Now, you looked at him with a dead stare, bored out of your mind. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t mess this up.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, I don\u2019t know, maybe something like Hey, Y/N! Long time, no see man, how\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at this. \u201cTom called your-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTim.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight. Sorry. Tim called your aunt to let her know that you\u2019ll be staying with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you even know my mother was telling the truth? Maybe she just decided to wing it and slam your name on the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne way to find out.\u201d he said, hitting the breaks. You hadn\u2019t even noticed the car had entered a garage. You released your seatbelt. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d You looked around, following him as he entered an elevator. A voice spoke and took you by surprise. \u201cWelcome back Mr Stark. Captain Rogers asked me to alert you about your meeting tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him to bugger off.\u201d he muttered and turned to face you, feeling your confused gaze on him. \u201cIt\u2019s Friday. H-her name is Friday, she\u2019s my computer.\u201d</p><p>You tapped him on the shoulder, strolling in through the door. Looking around you, you found yourself in a lab filled with all sorts of buttons you were tempted to push. Looking out the big window, you realised it was already morning. Must\u2019ve fallen asleep in the car, you thought. Catching a glimpse of a short man with glasses and a lab coat heading your way, you turned around. \u201cTony, I gotta talk to you about these calculations for the project alpha. How do you read your own handwriting?\u201d he looked up from the paper, only to see you. \u201cYou\u2019re not Tony.\u201d</p><p>You stretched your lips as far as you could. \u201cI\u2019m not Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was just in the elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Tony called, carrying something in his hands. \u201cI see you\u2019ve met Y/N.\u201d You chuckled, waving your hand in the man\u2019s direction. \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility she could be my daughter, so&hellip;\u201d he took out a little plastic bag and quickly pulled out a strand of your hair before you could object, handing it to the man in the lab coat. \u201c&hellip;do your magic.\u201d</p><p>Bruce\u2019s jaw flew open as took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes before taking the bag. He handed the papers in his hand to Tony. \u201cDecipher this. I\u2019ll let you know once I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>You raised yourself on your toes, peeking to the papers over Tony\u2019s arm. \u201cDear lord, how do you read your own handwriting?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHilarious.\u201d he commented, throwing them away in the trash can. \u201cWanna eat something?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging your shoulders, you replied \u201cWouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>The kitchen was a large room, obviously built for the whole team to fit in. You made yourself cereal and sat down on one of the bar stools at the counter, Tony leaning against the fridge across from you.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked, your mouth full.</p><p>He snapped out of his little chain of thought. He shook his head and went over to the couch.</p><p>It\u2019s not that he was afraid of talking to you, he was afraid that you didn\u2019t like him already. He had missed out on your entire life, and even if he is your biological father he\u2019s still a stranger. He couldn\u2019t live with himself if he had harmed you more than his absence already has, so he decided to keep his distance.</p><p>You two were in the middle of a movie in the common room, which you had suggested to avoid breaking the ice, when the elevator arrived, followed by Bruce\u2019s footsteps over the room. \u201cTones, I got the results.\u201d He handed an envelope to him, before gently patting him on the shoulder and leaving. \u201cThanks buddy.\u201d Tony muttered. \u201cShould I have the honours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust open it.\u201d you said, clenching the remote control as hard as you could. He did as you said, his eyes rapidly flying over the papers. His eyes widened, and he swallowed a thick nothing. \u201cIt\u2019s positive.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://marvelstcrk.tumblr.com/post/180002116324/bailing-out\"><b>CHAPTER II</b></a></p>",

He ran around the car and quickly entered his side.</p><p>Another boring drive from your boring home town to wherever the hell he was leading you. You kept your eyes on the road the whole time, not allowing yourself to look in his direction. Catching glimpse of a watch, you realised the two of you were driving for almost three hours. Finally, you broke the heavy silence. \u201cSo you\u2019re not even close as talkative as you are on TV.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, feeling the tension build up in his shoulders. He didn\u2019t want to mess this up. When he got the call few hours ago, he thought it was a prank or something. Now, you looked at him with a dead stare, bored out of your mind. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t mess this up.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, I don\u2019t know, maybe something like Hey, Y/N! Long time, no see man, how\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at this. \u201cTom called your-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTim.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight. Sorry. Tim called your aunt to let her know that you\u2019ll be staying with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you even know my mother was telling the truth? Maybe she just decided to wing it and slam your name on the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne way to find out.\u201d he said, hitting the breaks. You hadn\u2019t even noticed the car had entered a garage. You released your seatbelt. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d You looked around, following him as he entered an elevator. A voice spoke and took you by surprise. \u201cWelcome back Mr Stark. Captain Rogers asked me to alert you about your meeting tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him to bugger off.\u201d he muttered and turned to face you, feeling your confused gaze on him. \u201cIt\u2019s Friday. H-her name is Friday, she\u2019s my computer.\u201d</p><p>You tapped him on the shoulder, strolling in through the door. Looking around you, you found yourself in a lab filled with all sorts of buttons you were tempted to push. Looking out the big window, you realised it was already morning. Must\u2019ve fallen asleep in the car, you thought. Catching a glimpse of a short man with glasses and a lab coat heading your way, you turned around. \u201cTony, I gotta talk to you about these calculations for the project alpha. How do you read your own handwriting?\u201d he looked up from the paper, only to see you. \u201cYou\u2019re not Tony.\u201d</p><p>You stretched your lips as far as you could. \u201cI\u2019m not Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was just in the elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Tony called, carrying something in his hands. \u201cI see you\u2019ve met Y/N.\u201d You chuckled, waving your hand in the man\u2019s direction. \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility she could be my daughter, so\u2026\u201d he took out a little plastic bag and quickly pulled out a strand of your hair before you could object, handing it to the man in the lab coat. \u201c\u2026do your magic.\u201d</p><p>Bruce\u2019s jaw flew open as took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes before taking the bag. He handed the papers in his hand to Tony. \u201cDecipher this. I\u2019ll let you know once I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>You raised yourself on your toes, peeking to the papers over Tony\u2019s arm. \u201cDear lord, how do you read your own handwriting?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHilarious.\u201d he commented, throwing them away in the trash can. \u201cWanna eat something?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging your shoulders, you replied \u201cWouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>The kitchen was a large room, obviously built for the whole team to fit in. You made yourself cereal and sat down on one of the bar stools at the counter, Tony leaning against the fridge across from you.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked, your mouth full.</p><p>He snapped out of his little chain of thought. He shook his head and went over to the couch.</p><p>It\u2019s not that he was afraid of talking to you, he was afraid that you didn\u2019t like him already. He had missed out on your entire life, and even if he is your biological father he\u2019s still a stranger. He couldn\u2019t live with himself if he had harmed you more than his absence already has, so he decided to keep his distance.</p><p>You two were in the middle of a movie in the common room, which you had suggested to avoid breaking the ice, when the elevator arrived, followed by Bruce\u2019s footsteps over the room. \u201cTones, I got the results.\u201d He handed an envelope to him, before gently patting him on the shoulder and leaving. \u201cThanks buddy.\u201d Tony muttered. \u201cShould I have the honours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust open it.\u201d you said, clenching the remote control as hard as you could. He did as you said, his eyes rapidly flying over the papers. His eyes widened, and he swallowed a thick nothing. \u201cIt\u2019s positive.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://marvelstcrk.tumblr.com/post/180002116324/bailing-out\"><b>CHAPTER II</b></a></p></p>",

You rolled your eyes, taking a seat in the rusty police car. </p><p>The ride to the police station was long and annoying. Growing up in a small town, you knew almost everyone who lived there and everyone knew you. At least they thought they did. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this, Y/N!\u201d Your gaze moved from the car window to the review mirror, your eyes locking with the ones of the man driving the car. \u201cI understand you\u2019re going through stuff. But come on, ever since Lucy died, you\u2019ve been acting like you just left the jungle. It\u2019s time for you to start acting a bit more mature!\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes, tired of your mother popping up in every other conversation you led. Ever since she died, it felt like everyone was pitying you. You didn\u2019t know why though, it\u2019s not like their pity would change anything.</p><p>After her death, you started living with your aunt, since your mother never bothered to tell anyone who your father was. You didn\u2019t mind, though. You could get by on your own, but apparently, you had to be older than 18 to do so.</p><p>Entering the small cell, you turned around letting the policeman take your handkerchiefs off. \u201cThanks, Tim.\u201d you said, turning towards the little wooden bench before taking a seat there. After a while, you got real bored and lost track of time, tempted to find a sharp item to carve something stupid like \u201cY/N WAS HERE.\u201d on the walls or the floor. Or both. Maybe even the ugly bench you were sat on. On the second thought, the whole place smelled like Dave, the local drunk who got arrested every night for almost cracking someone\u2019s skull open when things escalate at the bar.  You sighed, leaning your head against the cold wall behind you.</p><p>Maybe you fell asleep, because the next thing you heard was Tim\u2019s voice. \u201cY/N, don\u2019t freak out.\u201d You arched an eyebrow at him, suppressing a yawn. \u201cYour father will be the one to bail you out.\u201d Eyebrows furrowing closer together, you started laughing hysterically. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d he continued, trying to be louder than your outburst. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here any minute now.\u201d You stopped laughing. \u201cHow the hell did you find him now? Where the fuck was he for the past 16 years?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You can ask him yourself. I just found a letter from a social worker, saying your mother left a note with his information around the time you were born, in case something happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need some drunk with no self respect, who missed out on my whole life, to just march in and rescue me from Dave\u2019s second home.\u201d you scoffed. \u201cJust call my aunt to pick me up and I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo can do, Y/N. Give the man a chance.\u201d He left, leaving you alone to roll your eyes at the thought of the incoming encounter. You didn\u2019t need him to wander in here and save you like a damsel in distress. What happened with the past 16 years? This isn\u2019t the first time you got in trouble.</p><p>You heard the door open and Tim talk to someone. Raising an eyebrow in their direction, you tried to eavesdrop but failed. Next thing you know, the cell door is opening and Tim is standing there staring at you. \u201cHe signed the release forms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all this time, you\u2019re just gonna let some stranger take me? What if he\u2019s like a serial killer? What if I <i>never get to tell you I told you so </i>after he kills me?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes holding the door open for you. You entered the room and saw the last person you expected sitting by the desk. \u201cOh this is some kind of a joke.\u201d, you scoffed. </p><p>Tony froze, his heart beating so fast like it was trying to escape his chest. First impressions matter after all \u201cYou must be Y/N. Hi, I\u2019m Tony.\u201d</p><p>Tim took a plastic bag and emptied the containing items on the table. \u201cAnd here\u2019s your stuff Y/N, you are free to go.\u201d </p><p>You shot a sharpe glance in the direction of the man behind the table. \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know you\u2019re only doing things because you\u2019re sick of me.\u201d </p><p>You unexpectedly strolled out the place, causing Tony to slightly run beside you. \u201cHey, Y/N!\u201d he called, causing you to turn around.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked frowning.</p><p>\u201cC-can you come with me please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d he said, holding his car door open.

You didn&rsquo;t need him to wander in here and save you like a damsel in distress. What happened with the past 16 years? This isn&rsquo;t the first time you got in trouble.</p><p>You heard the door open and Tim talk to someone. Raising an eyebrow in their direction, you tried to eavesdrop but failed. Next thing you know, the cell door is opening and Tim is standing there staring at you. &ldquo;He signed the release forms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After all this time, you&rsquo;re just gonna let some stranger take me? What if he&rsquo;s like a serial killer? What if I <i>never get to tell you I told you so </i>after he kills me?&rdquo;</p><p>He rolled his eyes holding the door open for you. You entered the room and saw the last person you expected sitting by the desk. &ldquo;Oh this is some kind of a joke.&rdquo;, you scoffed. </p><p>Tony froze, his heart beating so fast like it was trying to escape his chest. First impressions matter after all &ldquo;You must be Y/N. Hi, I&rsquo;m Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>Tim took a plastic bag and emptied the containing items on the table. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s your stuff Y/N, you are free to go.&rdquo; </p><p>You shot a sharpe glance in the direction of the man behind the table. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re only doing things because you&rsquo;re sick of me.&rdquo; </p><p>You unexpectedly strolled out the place, causing Tony to slightly run beside you. &ldquo;Hey, Y/N!&rdquo; he called, causing you to turn around.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; you asked frowning.</p><p>&ldquo;C-can you come with me please?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; he said, holding his car door open. Your rolled your eyes, and entered the vehicle slamming the door shut. Tony frowned, but still felt a huge weight fall off his shoulders. He ran around the car and quickly entered his side.</p><p>Another boring drive from your boring home town to wherever the hell he was leading you. You kept your eyes on the road the whole time, not allowing yourself to look in his direction. Catching glimpse of a watch, you realised the two of you were driving for almost three hours. Finally, you broke the heavy silence. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not even close as talkative as you are on TV.&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head, feeling the tension build up in his shoulders. He didn&rsquo;t want to mess this up. When he got the call few hours ago, he thought it was a prank or something. Now, you looked at him with a dead stare, bored out of your mind. </p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t mess this up.</p><p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gee, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe something like Hey, Y/N! Long time, no see man, how&rsquo;ve you been?&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed at this. &ldquo;Tom called your-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tim.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Right. Sorry. Tim called your aunt to let her know that you&rsquo;ll be staying with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you even know my mother was telling the truth? Maybe she just decided to wing it and slam your name on the papers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One way to find out.&rdquo; he said, hitting the breaks. You hadn&rsquo;t even noticed the car had entered a garage. You released your seatbelt. &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; You looked around, following him as he entered an elevator. A voice spoke and took you by surprise. &ldquo;Welcome back Mr Stark. Captain Rogers asked me to alert you about your meeting tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell him to bugger off.&rdquo; he muttered and turned to face you, feeling your confused gaze on him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Friday. H-her name is Friday, she&rsquo;s my computer.&rdquo;</p><p>You tapped him on the shoulder, strolling in through the door. Looking around you, you found yourself in a lab filled with all sorts of buttons you were tempted to push. Looking out the big window, you realised it was already morning. Must&rsquo;ve fallen asleep in the car, you thought. Catching a glimpse of a short man with glasses and a lab coat heading your way, you turned around. &ldquo;Tony, I gotta talk to you about these calculations for the project alpha. How do you read your own handwriting?&rdquo; he looked up from the paper, only to see you. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>You stretched your lips as far as you could. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Tony.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was just in the elevator.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; Tony called, carrying something in his hands. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve met Y/N.&rdquo; You chuckled, waving your hand in the man&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a possibility she could be my daughter, so&hellip;&rdquo; he took out a little plastic bag and quickly pulled out a strand of your hair before you could object, handing it to the man in the lab coat. &ldquo;&hellip;do your magic.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce&rsquo;s jaw flew open as took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes before taking the bag. He handed the papers in his hand to Tony. &ldquo;Decipher this. I&rsquo;ll let you know once I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</p><p>You raised yourself on your toes, peeking to the papers over Tony&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Dear lord, how do you read your own handwriting?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hilarious.&rdquo; he commented, throwing them away in the trash can. &ldquo;Wanna eat something?&rdquo;</p><p>Shrugging your shoulders, you replied &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>The kitchen was a large room, obviously built for the whole team to fit in. You made yourself cereal and sat down on one of the bar stools at the counter, Tony leaning against the fridge across from you.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; you asked, your mouth full.</p><p>He snapped out of his little chain of thought. He shook his head and went over to the couch.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not that he was afraid of talking to you, he was afraid that you didn&rsquo;t like him already. He had missed out on your entire life, and even if he is your biological father he&rsquo;s still a stranger. He couldn&rsquo;t live with himself if he had harmed you more than his absence already has, so he decided to keep his distance.</p><p>You two were in the middle of a movie in the common room, which you had suggested to avoid breaking the ice, when the elevator arrived, followed by Bruce&rsquo;s footsteps over the room. &ldquo;Tones, I got the results.&rdquo; He handed an envelope to him, before gently patting him on the shoulder and leaving. &ldquo;Thanks buddy.&rdquo; Tony muttered. &ldquo;Should I have the honours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just open it.&rdquo; you said, clenching the remote control as hard as you could. He did as you said, his eyes rapidly flying over the papers. His eyes widened, and he swallowed a thick nothing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s positive.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://marvelstcrk.tumblr.com/post/180002116324/bailing-out\"><b>CHAPTER II</b></a></p></p>",
