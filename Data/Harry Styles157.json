        "body": "<p>I love and respect the boys more than anything in the world.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The music they have decided to publish is absolutely amazing and I understand their need for a break after 5 years of very hard work. I couldn&rsquo;t be more <b>proud</b> of them.</p><p>But there won&rsquo;t go a day where I will not miss them being together. Being<b> One Direction</b>. </p><p>Those months where they were on tour and we would have new pictures and videos of them every night from the shows doing what they loved to do and then some. They would tweet random things to us or each other and post lots of pictures. And when the tour was over, we would find it stressful to keep track of everyone. All the awards they or we won for them and their speeches always thanking the fans. <br/>I remember all the funny post people made when new music videos came out and we would try to break the Vevo record for the boys. <i>#refreshnotreplay.</i> I remember when the Best Song Ever music video came out. There were probably a thousand fanfics and imagines written about Marcel Styles and you know you read them. I remember This Is Us being released and how proud we were of the boys for making a movie. Talking about movies, but more so acting. The one Icarly episode that will forever be <i>iconic</i>. And what about 1D Day. They promised us 7 hours of content and boy did we get it. From the interviews to the world records and ninjas, modelling, wrestling and so much more. It was chaotic but we were used to chaos. The Talk Dirty to Me and Workout video that killed us all. Meanwhile, everyone had to pretend that it was the first time we had listen to Midnight Memories. We really did leak everything. And even though some were okay with it and so were not, <i>we still got the boys to the top of the charts and supported them</i>. And they always knew. They were always so thankful and stayed their polite and grounded selves. They made the concerts unique and danced, jumped and fell while eating various things, some thrown on stage. We had our beautiful moments when the boys would let us sing Little Things for them. And when the sound of our voices would sing as loud as we could making sure everyone outside the stadium could hear us clearly. We loved and still love our boys.\u00a0</p><p>We would be the best to make fun of them and drag them for whatever reason but we would always be there to defend them when others thought they needed to insert themselves. And we always knew we weren&rsquo;t the most loved fandom but nobody wanted to fuck with us and our boys. We ended somebodies career and we stood up for the boys when the media got too much. But they had out back too. They knew us as we knew them though we still blew them away with our amazing fan projects. They would defend us as we defended them. It was &ldquo;a teamwork between us and them&rdquo;. We had an amazing time. We made sure they were on the top of the world always. And we made sure the world also knew by trending whatever we wanted on Twitter, which we by the way ruled. <br/> And they made sure to take care of us when we had the worst day of our life and 5 became 4.

I couldn\u2019t be more <b>proud</b> of them.</p><p>But there won\u2019t go a day where I will not miss them being together. Being<b> One Direction</b>. </p><p>Those months where they were on tour and we would have new pictures and videos of them every night from the shows doing what they loved to do and then some. They would tweet random things to us or each other and post lots of pictures. And when the tour was over, we would find it stressful to keep track of everyone. All the awards they or we won for them and their speeches always thanking the fans. <br>I remember all the funny post people made when new music videos came out and we would try to break the Vevo record for the boys. <i>#refreshnotreplay.</i> I remember when the Best Song Ever music video came out. There were probably a thousand fanfics and imagines written about Marcel Styles and you know you read them. I remember This Is Us being released and how proud we were of the boys for making a movie. Talking about movies, but more so acting. The one Icarly episode that will forever be <i>iconic</i>. And what about 1D Day. They promised us 7 hours of content and boy did we get it. From the interviews to the world records and ninjas, modelling, wrestling and so much more. It was chaotic but we were used to chaos. The Talk Dirty to Me and Workout video that killed us all. Meanwhile, everyone had to pretend that it was the first time we had listen to Midnight Memories. We really did leak everything. And even though some were okay with it and so were not, <i>we still got the boys to the top of the charts and supported them</i>. And they always knew. They were always so thankful and stayed their polite and grounded selves. They made the concerts unique and danced, jumped and fell while eating various things, some thrown on stage. We had our beautiful moments when the boys would let us sing Little Things for them. And when the sound of our voices would sing as loud as we could making sure everyone outside the stadium could hear us clearly. We loved and still love our boys.\u00a0</p><p>We would be the best to make fun of them and drag them for whatever reason but we would always be there to defend them when others thought they needed to insert themselves. And we always knew we weren\u2019t the most loved fandom but nobody wanted to fuck with us and our boys. We ended somebodies career and we stood up for the boys when the media got too much. But they had out back too. They knew us as we knew them though we still blew them away with our amazing fan projects. They would defend us as we defended them.
