The door that was once open and welcoming is now locked and disinviting\u2026\u201d Tony muttered, his lips trembling as he looked away from the team-afraid that they might see his tears even with the sunglasses he wore. She left him-them, and now he was alone.</p><p>Natasha stood quietly, Clint and Wanda beside her-the latter in tears as the archer just stopped his own waterworks. Laura stood beside her husband, soothe him as she made sure the guy wasn\u2019t drowning in his thoughts again, the team already lost their captain-he was far gone in his mind, enough for him not to attend today\u2019s events. The team was even shocked when they saw Tony who just showed up today after being gone for two weeks. Tony came back, Just for the ceremony, Eve\u2019s formal funeral.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"280\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"xxvampirediaries:Gk8auFPhy3LCrjYjD1YOkw:ZJ5x-h23qTU7y\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/09ee0ca9a8b431b2b92514c36cf088c0/tumblr_o4hnycv81c1v7ivruo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"280\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Stark, that was beautiful. Now may we call on, Mr. Sam Wilson.\u201d The emcee called, Sam sauntering his way as Tony sat beside Nat again.</p><p>\u201cStill no Steve?\u201d Tony asked, not bothering on looking at Nat who stayed quiet and just shook her head-listening intently to Sam\u2019s words. After a few minutes, Scott was called along with the other members. Wanda and Natasha didn\u2019t talk. They just let the minister proceed as the man called out to Nick and Agent Hill, to say a few words before she finally gets buried.</p><p>\u201cMaria let\u2019s go.\u201d Nick whispered, nudging the agent at his side but the latter just ignored him. \u00a0\u201cHill.\u201d But before the director can continue, Maria glared at him and hissed \u201cNo offense director, but please-leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>As Nick roll his eye, left his seat and walked to the podium- Maria started crying.</p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cDirector. Are we sure about this?\u201d Maria gasped, her eyes gazing back at Helen who stayed in front of her- trying to ignore the folder placed right in front of them. \u201cI think you\u2019re being cruel on this one Nick.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI am.\u201d Fury blatantly muttered, not minding the two ladies in front of him- the doctor weeping and the other one, trying her best to not let the tears do its job. \u201cI need my team, Maria.

Two years-Two years of mourning and weeping over nothing! And then another year grieving about the fact that we were lied to in front of our faces! Just because they were too careless, too emotional and that they became irrational freaks who let their hearts won over the matter! And that Maria, that caused us our jobs-their missions! Innocent people\u2019s lives and the whole universe safety for that matter!\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them, Nick! They loved her with all their hearts!

Steve knew that. It snatched where it could, taking people who were far too young, far too good. It didn&rsquo;t pretend to care, it didn&rsquo;t pretend to distinguish. The hooded vale of death had hung over the world for a long time, always threatening. It had always touched Steve quite so close. Death had ripped away a part of him, a part of him that he loved the most. Now Steve would sit staring for hours. His face sunken and haunted, his mind cold and empty. The more the months went on, the more his team seemed to become like him. One was snatched away, and those that were left would wish it was them. The world had gone cold, because of the plague that was death.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"276\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thedailybrainwave:BOvZwMGmsdE7Y7-oepb_3Q:Zk_AEw2Sv05DO\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed77323416919b0ea4aadb90913b9e8c/tumblr_p0r7hkwvc81r9g4mlo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"276\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>\u201cYou missed her funeral, Steve.\u201d</p><p>Steve looked down, his fist clenching as he harshly placed his glass of scotch down, smashing it into pieces. \u201cWe waited you know?

We honor her, We say our final thanks, we apologize for letting her down and we bid our good-\u201c But before Natasha can finish, she was pinned onto the wall- Steve\u2019s heavy breathing near her and his empty eyes covered in rage and sadness.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead Natasha! How can you even say that? Those awful lies! You know in your heart that she\u2019s not dead Nat, She\u2019s not. Nick is playing with us. S.H.I.E.L.D is playing with us, Nat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the files, Steve! The news! They saw her body! She was burned alive! She\u2019s dead and I know that hurts, but you need to accept that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no body Natasha! You buried an empty coffin and you know that! What?! That\u2019s how S.H.I.E.L.D works now?That when someone is missing for four years you go look for a burnt body and identify it as the missing person?! What happened to our high-tech gears and gadgets? What happened to Stark\u2019s devices that can easily identify if that dead body was even Eviana nor even someone we know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was burned alive Steve! There was no DNA to track, no fingerprint to identify-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThen how can you surely say that that dead girl is Eve?Huh?!\u201d</p><p>Natasha stayed quiet, her eyes glazed with tears as Steve stood tall in front of her. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired, Steve? She\u2019s been missing for four years. Four fucking years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThor saw her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was hallucinating Steve! We talked about this already! She\u2019s dead okay? She\u2019s gone! And you, You\u2019re alive. We all are. And maybe that sucks but what can we do?! Sulk and drink even though you know you cannot even get drunk?! There are millions of people that needs us Steve, they need you. We need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need her to Nat. I need her.\u201d Natasha was ready to retort back, answer back to Steve and maybe knock some senses to him. But when Steve screamed, his shoulders trembling as a whimper made its way out of his lips- Natasha looked at him helplessly, immediately calling Bucky and Sam for help.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"245\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"your-kylie-me:5vlf489eeolsvUJG9uebKg:ZAcNKo23D9SHT\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/067aad931ce4602739252afb83c9a857/tumblr_o3wg9gP2NI1tte2x2o1_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"245\" data-orig-width=\"245\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/08b52298cf60dbe90c9883b80f24cff6/tumblr_inline_p9y35zuVCn1taxtjs_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>\u201cMama!\u201d A little blonde boy called, his eyes filled with wonder and happiness-giggling as he handed a small butterfly made of paper to a young lady he called his mother. \u201cLook what Papa gave me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my, that\u2019s lovely sweetheart.

The door that was once open and welcoming is now locked and disinviting\u2026\u201d Tony muttered, his lips trembling as he looked away from the team-afraid that they might see his tears even with the sunglasses he wore. She left him-them, and now he was alone.</p><p>Natasha stood quietly, Clint and Wanda beside her-the latter in tears as the archer just stopped his own waterworks. Laura stood beside her husband, soothe him as she made sure the guy wasn\u2019t drowning in his thoughts again, the team already lost their captain-he was far gone in his mind, enough for him not to attend today\u2019s events. The team was even shocked when they saw Tony who just showed up today after being gone for two weeks. Tony came back, Just for the ceremony, Eve\u2019s formal funeral.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"280\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"xxvampirediaries:Gk8auFPhy3LCrjYjD1YOkw:ZJ5x-h23qTU7y\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/09ee0ca9a8b431b2b92514c36cf088c0/tumblr_o4hnycv81c1v7ivruo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"280\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Stark, that was beautiful. Now may we call on, Mr. Sam Wilson.\u201d The emcee called, Sam sauntering his way as Tony sat beside Nat again.</p><p>\u201cStill no Steve?\u201d Tony asked, not bothering on looking at Nat who stayed quiet and just shook her head-listening intently to Sam\u2019s words. After a few minutes, Scott was called along with the other members. Wanda and Natasha didn\u2019t talk. They just let the minister proceed as the man called out to Nick and Agent Hill, to say a few words before she finally gets buried.</p><p>\u201cMaria let\u2019s go.\u201d Nick whispered, nudging the agent at his side but the latter just ignored him. \u00a0\u201cHill.\u201d But before the director can continue, Maria glared at him and hissed \u201cNo offense director, but please-leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>As Nick roll his eye, left his seat and walked to the podium- Maria started crying.</p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cDirector. Are we sure about this?\u201d Maria gasped, her eyes gazing back at Helen who stayed in front of her- trying to ignore the folder placed right in front of them. \u201cI think you\u2019re being cruel on this one Nick.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI am.\u201d Fury blatantly muttered, not minding the two ladies in front of him- the doctor weeping and the other one, trying her best to not let the tears do its job. \u201cI need my team, Maria. The world needs the Avengers back.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut this is too much Nick! This is brutal-\u201c</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know what too much is?! Two years-Two years of mourning and weeping over nothing! And then another year grieving about the fact that we were lied to in front of our faces! Just because they were too careless, too emotional and that they became irrational freaks who let their hearts won over the matter! And that Maria, that caused us our jobs-their missions! Innocent people\u2019s lives and the whole universe safety for that matter!\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them, Nick! They loved her with all their hearts! She\u2019s not someone you can just forget Director.\u201d Maria whimpered, letting her Director see her at her worst. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI know that Hill.\u201d Fury mumbled, his eyes glazed with tears as well. </i></p><p><i>\u201cSo why? Why?! Why are you telling them that she\u2019s\u2026dead?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cBecause the world, the world needs them again.

Steve knew that. It snatched where it could, taking people who were far too young, far too good. It didn\u2019t pretend to care, it didn\u2019t pretend to distinguish. The hooded vale of death had hung over the world for a long time, always threatening. It had always touched Steve quite so close. Death had ripped away a part of him, a part of him that he loved the most. Now Steve would sit staring for hours. His face sunken and haunted, his mind cold and empty. The more the months went on, the more his team seemed to become like him. One was snatched away, and those that were left would wish it was them. The world had gone cold, because of the plague that was death.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"276\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thedailybrainwave:BOvZwMGmsdE7Y7-oepb_3Q:Zk_AEw2Sv05DO\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed77323416919b0ea4aadb90913b9e8c/tumblr_p0r7hkwvc81r9g4mlo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"276\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>\u201cYou missed her funeral, Steve.\u201d</p><p>Steve looked down, his fist clenching as he harshly placed his glass of scotch down, smashing it into pieces. \u201cWe waited you know? Wanda even asked the pastor to wait for ten minutes, she thought you\u2019ll be the great captain you are and maybe show up. Just respect for the dead, you know? We honor her, We say our final thanks, we apologize for letting her down and we bid our good-\u201c But before Natasha can finish, she was pinned onto the wall- Steve\u2019s heavy breathing near her and his empty eyes covered in rage and sadness.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead Natasha! How can you even say that? Those awful lies! You know in your heart that she\u2019s not dead Nat, She\u2019s not. Nick is playing with us. S.H.I.E.L.D is playing with us, Nat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the files, Steve! The news! They saw her body! She was burned alive! She\u2019s dead and I know that hurts, but you need to accept that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no body Natasha! You buried an empty coffin and you know that! What?! That\u2019s how S.H.I.E.L.D works now?That when someone is missing for four years you go look for a burnt body and identify it as the missing person?! What happened to our high-tech gears and gadgets? What happened to Stark\u2019s devices that can easily identify if that dead body was even Eviana nor even someone we know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was burned alive Steve! There was no DNA to track, no fingerprint to identify-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThen how can you surely say that that dead girl is Eve?Huh?!\u201d</p><p>Natasha stayed quiet, her eyes glazed with tears as Steve stood tall in front of her. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired, Steve? She\u2019s been missing for four years. Four fucking years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThor saw her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was hallucinating Steve! We talked about this already! She\u2019s dead okay? She\u2019s gone! And you, You\u2019re alive. We all are. And maybe that sucks but what can we do?! Sulk and drink even though you know you cannot even get drunk?! There are millions of people that needs us Steve, they need you. We need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need her to Nat. I need her.\u201d Natasha was ready to retort back, answer back to Steve and maybe knock some senses to him. But when Steve screamed, his shoulders trembling as a whimper made its way out of his lips- Natasha looked at him helplessly, immediately calling Bucky and Sam for help.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"245\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"your-kylie-me:5vlf489eeolsvUJG9uebKg:ZAcNKo23D9SHT\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/067aad931ce4602739252afb83c9a857/tumblr_o3wg9gP2NI1tte2x2o1_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"245\" data-orig-width=\"245\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/08b52298cf60dbe90c9883b80f24cff6/tumblr_inline_p9y35zuVCn1taxtjs_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>\u201cMama!\u201d A little blonde boy called, his eyes filled with wonder and happiness-giggling as he handed a small butterfly made of paper to a young lady he called his mother. \u201cLook what Papa gave me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my, that\u2019s lovely sweetheart.

The hooded vale of death had hung over the world for a long time, always threatening. It had always touched Steve quite so close. Death had ripped away a part of him, a part of him that he loved the most. Now Steve would sit staring for hours. His face sunken and haunted, his mind cold and empty. The more the months went on, the more his team seemed to become like him. One was snatched away, and those that were left would wish it was them. The world had gone cold, because of the plague that was death.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"276\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thedailybrainwave:BOvZwMGmsdE7Y7-oepb_3Q:Zk_AEw2Sv05DO\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed77323416919b0ea4aadb90913b9e8c/tumblr_p0r7hkwvc81r9g4mlo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"276\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>\u201cYou missed her funeral, Steve.\u201d</p><p>Steve looked down, his fist clenching as he harshly placed his glass of scotch down, smashing it into pieces. \u201cWe waited you know?

We honor her, We say our final thanks, we apologize for letting her down and we bid our good-\u201c But before Natasha can finish, she was pinned onto the wall- Steve\u2019s heavy breathing near her and his empty eyes covered in rage and sadness.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead Natasha! How can you even say that? Those awful lies! You know in your heart that she\u2019s not dead Nat, She\u2019s not. Nick is playing with us. S.H.I.E.L.D is playing with us, Nat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the files, Steve! The news! They saw her body! She was burned alive! She\u2019s dead and I know that hurts, but you need to accept that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no body Natasha! You buried an empty coffin and you know that! What?! That\u2019s how S.H.I.E.L.D works now?That when someone is missing for four years you go look for a burnt body and identify it as the missing person?! What happened to our high-tech gears and gadgets? What happened to Stark\u2019s devices that can easily identify if that dead body was even Eviana nor even someone we know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was burned alive Steve! There was no DNA to track, no fingerprint to identify-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThen how can you surely say that that dead girl is Eve?Huh?!\u201d</p><p>Natasha stayed quiet, her eyes glazed with tears as Steve stood tall in front of her. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired, Steve?

There are millions of people that needs us Steve, they need you. We need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need her to Nat. I need her.\u201d Natasha was ready to retort back, answer back to Steve and maybe knock some senses to him. But when Steve screamed, his shoulders trembling as a whimper made its way out of his lips- Natasha looked at him helplessly, immediately calling Bucky and Sam for help.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"245\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"your-kylie-me:5vlf489eeolsvUJG9uebKg:ZAcNKo23D9SHT\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/067aad931ce4602739252afb83c9a857/tumblr_o3wg9gP2NI1tte2x2o1_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"245\" data-orig-width=\"245\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/08b52298cf60dbe90c9883b80f24cff6/tumblr_inline_p9y35zuVCn1taxtjs_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"275\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>\u201cMama!\u201d A little blonde boy called, his eyes filled with wonder and happiness-giggling as he handed a small butterfly made of paper to a young lady he called his mother. \u201cLook what Papa gave me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my, that\u2019s lovely sweetheart.

Just like the way I spoil you.\u201d Michael, the father-chirped, kissing the young lady\u2019s forehead as they watch their son play in the large garden. \u201cYour personal servant talked to me-\u201c</p><p>\u201cShe has a name Michael. Her name is Violet.\u201d The young lady rolled her eyes and slightly pinched the guy-Annoyed at his manners.</p><p>\u201cEh.Whatever, She talked to me- told me you asked for more painkillers? Are you feeling alright?\u201d \u00a0She frowned, circling her fingers as she tried soothing the numbing pain in her head once again. \u201cDarling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m-I\u2019m feeling this headache again \u2018Kael.

I think so.\u201d She winced.Feeling another throbbing pain kicking in her head, it was as if there was something blocking her mind,hurting hr and that her nervous system is trying it\u2019s best to fight it back-but it was just backfiring for them. This isn\u2019t new to her, it always happened to her and knew that a visit to her own specialist, the one that Michael hired just for her would always soothe her and she\u2019ll wake up feeling refreshed and much better.But it happened frequently that she became curious onto why and what was happening to her, she didn\u2019t want to be sick-she had a son and is now expecting her second child.But her doctor would always say that she didn\u2019t have to worry and that it was just stress, after all-she had a kingdom to rule.And so she tried neglecting the pain, but it became severe every day that she couldn\u2019t stand it and would always go back to the doctor, and now that Sequioa was three- the little boy would now start asking random questions, and when his mama was feeling ill, the boy would always cry; afraid that she was hurting badly.</p><p>Michael assisted her on seating down on one of the pew, called one of the servants that stood far from them and whispered, \u201cCall Dr. Doom- Tell him that Queen Carina needs his help again.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"245\" data-orig-width=\"245\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/114a920d957b51e25f159197b45a3bf0/tumblr_inline_p9y360wbDH1taxtjs_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"245\" data-orig-width=\"245\"></figure><p>\u201cSequioa is asleep, He instantly fell asleep even when I was only at the first three pages of The Very Hungry Caterpillar.\u201d Michael chuckled, throwing his robe on the floor as he sat down on their shared bed. \u201cHow are you feeling my queen?\u201d He mumbled, scooting closer to her as he placed another kiss on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cMuch better \u2018Kael. Doctor Doom really knows how to soothe that one hell of a headache.\u201d Queen Carina chirped, placed her book down as she moved closer to her husband, the two of them sharing an intimate kiss.</p><p><i>\u201cEviana.

She arched her back, the pain was rushing through her body like an igniting fire. Squeezing her eyes shut as her face contorted. Never had she experienced such pain in her life. Another pang of pain in her head as she felt the world spin ultimately, falling onto the floor as her jaw clenched, grabbing a fistful of her black locks and pulling on it trying to ease the pain.</p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re saving the world again Eve.

You need to remember that she\u2019s a growing powerful mutant, she can manipulate her supernatural cells-tell it what to do, what to fight back and what to not.

A very powerful one.\u201d</p><p>The King-dressed in gold and platinum, soon started to glow in red and gold- the electrifying spark frightened the doctor, but Victor stood still. \u201cJust accept it Korvac.

Death had ripped away a part of him, a part of him that he loved the most. Now Steve would sit staring for hours. His face sunken and haunted, his mind cold and empty. The more the months went on, the more his team seemed to become like him. One was snatched away, and those that were left would wish it was them. The world had gone cold, because of the plague that was death.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"3\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&ldquo;You missed her funeral, Steve.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve looked down, his fist clenching as he harshly placed his glass of scotch down, smashing it into pieces. &ldquo;We waited you know? Wanda even asked the pastor to wait for ten minutes, she thought you&rsquo;ll be the great captain you are and maybe show up. Just respect for the dead, you know? We honor her, We say our final thanks, we apologize for letting her down and we bid our good-&ldquo; But before Natasha can finish, she was pinned onto the wall- Steve&rsquo;s heavy breathing near her and his empty eyes covered in rage and sadness.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not dead Natasha! How can you even say that? Those awful lies! You know in your heart that she&rsquo;s not dead Nat, She&rsquo;s not. Nick is playing with us. S.H.I.E.L.D is playing with us, Nat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You saw the files, Steve! The news! They saw her body! She was burned alive! She&rsquo;s dead and I know that hurts, but you need to accept that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There was no body Natasha! You buried an empty coffin and you know that! What?! That&rsquo;s how S.H.I.E.L.D works now?That when someone is missing for four years you go look for a burnt body and identify it as the missing person?! What happened to our high-tech gears and gadgets? What happened to Stark&rsquo;s devices that can easily identify if that dead body was even Eviana nor even someone we know!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was burned alive Steve! There was no DNA to track, no fingerprint to identify-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then how can you surely say that that dead girl is Eve?Huh?!&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha stayed quiet, her eyes glazed with tears as Steve stood tall in front of her. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you tired, Steve? She&rsquo;s been missing for four years. Four fucking years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thor saw her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was hallucinating Steve! We talked about this already! She&rsquo;s dead okay? She&rsquo;s gone! And you, You&rsquo;re alive. We all are. And maybe that sucks but what can we do?! Sulk and drink even though you know you cannot even get drunk?! There are millions of people that needs us Steve, they need you. We need you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need her to Nat. I need her.&rdquo; Natasha was ready to retort back, answer back to Steve and maybe knock some senses to him. But when Steve screamed, his shoulders trembling as a whimper made its way out of his lips- Natasha looked at him helplessly, immediately calling Bucky and Sam for help.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"4\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/08b52298cf60dbe90c9883b80f24cff6/tumblr_inline_p9y35zuVCn1taxtjs_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Mama!&rdquo; A little blonde boy called, his eyes filled with wonder and happiness-giggling as he handed a small butterfly made of paper to a young lady he called his mother. &ldquo;Look what Papa gave me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my, that&rsquo;s lovely sweetheart. Do you know what they call this in French?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Papillon!&rdquo; He exclaimed, giggling as he placed it on his mother&rsquo;s ear- his accent, thick and smooth. &ldquo;Mama I want a real one!&rdquo; The young lady smiled, her black wavy hair stopping right at her back when she stooped down-just to caress her son&rsquo;s cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure honey let&rsquo;s try catching one next time we go back to the forest okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But maybe Papa can get me a real one mama!&rdquo; The young boy cheered-his soft blonde curls bouncing as he took the paper, playing with it once again-the young lady frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;Sequioa, I have another present for you.&rdquo; A voice echoed in the halls of the palace, the mother and son immediately looking at the far end of the hall. There, A tall man stood- a large container in his hand where a blue and yellow colored butterfly flew around.</p><p>&ldquo;Mama!Look! A papillon!&rdquo;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re spoiling him again Michael.&rdquo; The young lady smiled, smirking as Sequioa played with the butterfly-dropping the paper one. &ldquo;We talked about this &lsquo;<i>Kael</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know my queen, but he is my son- I can and I will always spoil him. Just like the way I spoil you.&rdquo; Michael, the father-chirped, kissing the young lady&rsquo;s forehead as they watch their son play in the large garden. &ldquo;Your personal servant talked to me-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She has a name Michael. Her name is Violet.&rdquo; The young lady rolled her eyes and slightly pinched the guy-Annoyed at his manners.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh.Whatever, She talked to me- told me you asked for more painkillers? Are you feeling alright?&rdquo; &nbsp;She frowned, circling her fingers as she tried soothing the numbing pain in her head once again. &ldquo;Darling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m feeling this headache again &lsquo;Kael. The one that I always feel, remember?&rdquo;</p><p>Michael stood straight, a scowl on his face as he looked down at his aching wife. &ldquo;Maybe you need to get checked up again by the specialist my queen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. I think so.&rdquo; She winced.Feeling another throbbing pain kicking in her head, it was as if there was something blocking her mind,hurting hr and that her nervous system is trying it&rsquo;s best to fight it back-but it was just backfiring for them. This isn&rsquo;t new to her, it always happened to her and knew that a visit to her own specialist, the one that Michael hired just for her would always soothe her and she&rsquo;ll wake up feeling refreshed and much better.But it happened frequently that she became curious onto why and what was happening to her, she didn&rsquo;t want to be sick-she had a son and is now expecting her second child.But her doctor would always say that she didn&rsquo;t have to worry and that it was just stress, after all-she had a kingdom to rule.And so she tried neglecting the pain, but it became severe every day that she couldn&rsquo;t stand it and would always go back to the doctor, and now that Sequioa was three- the little boy would now start asking random questions, and when his mama was feeling ill, the boy would always cry; afraid that she was hurting badly.</p><p>Michael assisted her on seating down on one of the pew, called one of the servants that stood far from them and whispered, &ldquo;Call Dr. Doom- Tell him that Queen Carina needs his help again.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/114a920d957b51e25f159197b45a3bf0/tumblr_inline_p9y360wbDH1taxtjs_250.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Sequioa is asleep, He instantly fell asleep even when I was only at the first three pages of The Very Hungry Caterpillar.&rdquo; Michael chuckled, throwing his robe on the floor as he sat down on their shared bed. &ldquo;How are you feeling my queen?&rdquo; He mumbled, scooting closer to her as he placed another kiss on her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Much better &lsquo;Kael. Doctor Doom really knows how to soothe that one hell of a headache.&rdquo; Queen Carina chirped, placed her book down as she moved closer to her husband, the two of them sharing an intimate kiss.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Eviana.

Her body felt as if it had been bruised in every corner. Her legs felt shaky and could not support her body anymore as her head felt heavier. She arched her back, the pain was rushing through her body like an igniting fire. Squeezing her eyes shut as her face contorted. Never had she experienced such pain in her life. Another pang of pain in her head as she felt the world spin ultimately, falling onto the floor as her jaw clenched, grabbing a fistful of her black locks and pulling on it trying to ease the pain.</p><p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re saving the world again Eve.

You need to remember that she&rsquo;s a growing powerful mutant, she can manipulate her supernatural cells-tell it what to do, what to fight back and what to not.

A very powerful one.&rdquo;</p><p>The King-dressed in gold and platinum, soon started to glow in red and gold- the electrifying spark frightened the doctor, but Victor stood still. &ldquo;Just accept it Korvac.
