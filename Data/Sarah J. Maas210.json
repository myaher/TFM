Reviewing <i>Kingdom of Ash</i> is more like me trying to describe my reaction to words on pages that I loved even as they ripped my heart to shreds and stitched it back together. From the moment I met infamous assassin Celaena Sardothien as she swaggered blindfolded through the halls of Endovier, this story reeled me in, but I could have never imagined the epic journey it would become. <i>Kingdom of Ash</i> was a glorious, heart-rending story of these people I have come to love fighting for a Better World.<br/></p><p><i>Kingdom of Ash</i> is the last stand of our <i>Throne of Glass</i> heroes against Erawan, his plan for the domination of Erilea and beyond finally unfolding, as he seeks destruction and oblivion for all who oppose him, and against Maeve, her true form revealed, her insidious plan manifesting as she fights gain control of Aelin to use her as she would for her own selfish ends. It is epic fantasy but compared to other books in that genre, it\u2019s not as much a marathon as it is emotional sprint after sprint. It\u2019s staggering and dramatic and alive and passionate. <b>It doesn\u2019t allow you a single second to catch your breath, not for all of its nearly-1000 pages. </b></p><p>With old debts called in and all cards on the table, this book takes so many characters we\u2019ve come to know over the series and shows how their lives are threads woven together like a tapestry, and now we are pulling back to see the entire picture and how it will all end. I couldn\u2019t even binge-read this book \u2013 I had to keep setting it down and taking time to process it all every few chapters just from the magnitude and the weight of the story. With all of its intense moments, it also had so many moments that made me laugh, and it held love (which SJM writes so perfectly) that made me just SIGH with happiness. The characters of this series are so real to me, their heartbreak and grief is painful, I celebrate their joys and triumphs, I love with them and I definitely cried with them.</p><p>I\u2019ve been teary when I\u2019ve read books before. I\u2019ve been misty-eyed, I\u2019ve had one dramatic Frodo-crying-for-Gandalf tear, I\u2019ve maybe cried more once or twice ever from a book. This book had me crying multiple times (I went back and counted - six different scenes). At the end, I was weeping, like tear after tear and and shaky breathing and my husband giving me very concerned looks while I waved him away and trying to hold my heart together crying as I finished this series. I have no idea how Sarah J. Maas was able to wrap up this long story so well, and put this many emotions and heavy scene after scene onto paper. Did she just sob all day for the months it took her to write this? </p><p><b>But the <i>Throne of Glass</i> series has always been about getting up and about fighting for a Better World. It\u2019s about hope in times of despair, and strength in the face of adversity.</b> And the series is about amazing women who are badasses, who fight for what they believe in, who pursue what they want, who love fiercely, who use whatever strengths they have for themselves and for those they love, who lift each other up and refuse to settle. <b>If I didn\u2019t already love this series for the story with its twists that leave me gasping, I would love it for the women whose stories it tells.</b> Aelin, Manon, Lysandra, Elide, Yrene, Nehemia, Asterin and the Thirteen, Evangeline, Ansel, Kaltain. They are passionate and they are ferocious and they love fiercely and they fight for what they believe in. </p><p>\n\nThe bottom line is that I loved this book. Loved it. Easily and instantly, <i>Kingdom of Ash</i> has become one of my all-time favorites. Thank you, Sarah, for these books and characters (and even thank you for all of my emotions right now, wrecked as I am).

Maas for creating this world, for pursuing her dream of seeing the books published and finally for them coming to us the fans, to me as a human being. It was a long journey, but it was so extraordinary an meaningful (even when painful and in a way precisely because of that) that honestly I\u2019m sad it came to an end, but all things do both good and bad. For me the last book couldn\u2019t have been more perfect. I try to keep this post spoiler free, but the arcs of all of the characters were amazing. My favorite, ever since we first met her in HoF is Manon Blackbeak and her development especially in this final book undid me. I\u2019m so proud and happy with what she became, who she became in this book that I have no words to express it. Every page of this book has been a delight. Every book in this and the ACOTAR series an inspiration, to keep moving forward, to keep fighting, to keep healing. Thank you Sarah for giving the world all of this. To the Author who listened and gave us hope for a better world. </p></p>",
