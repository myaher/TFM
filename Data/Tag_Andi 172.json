Jo creia que, amb sort, hi trobaria un parell de castellans i ja! </p><p>I haven&rsquo;t! I found out about the show because it was trending on here due to the S3 promo. But here&rsquo;s an unnecessarily long review anyways. </p><p>If columpios (that&rsquo;s Spanish for swings, for those who didn&rsquo;t know) is used where TJ says underdog, I totally get it. I mean, I&rsquo;ve tried searching on the internet what underdog means, and I still don&rsquo;t think I totally get it; there&rsquo;s probably no direct translation for that word.</p><p>And Columpios is a really nice nickname!! It references a really important symbol for their relationship and, at least in Spanish, has this cute, childish energy that you would expect for a first crush. Aside from that, there&rsquo;s also these two scenarios based on my own experience that are worth mentioning (not really, but idc):</p><ul><li>There&rsquo;s my family (especially my uncles that live in Chile), who practically forget about real names and only use nicknames (my grandma was called Vieja Xexa asdfgh and they tried to call me Rorro) and Columpios would fit just fine in that context. </li><li>I had a phase where I would give everyone nicknames.
