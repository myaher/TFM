Unless you meant she marries Bran who\u2019ll become king which is a different thing because she\u2019ll be a consort, not the leader of the North. Secondly, book Alys married a wildling. Bran is a main character despite all the butchering of his personality and importance. There\u2019s no way they are going to marry him to a character who\u2019s already married to someone else in the books. That\u2019s a huge disservice to his character.

        "body": "<p>I thought I\u2019d take the time to discuss my favourite Stark sibling relationship. While the two of them weren\u2019t as close as Arya and Jon or Jon and Robb, they have a positive relationship despite having different interests. Out of all the Stark children, Sansa and Bran are noted to have enjoyed songs though Bran did not like the romantic ones Sansa enjoyed.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nLord Wyman&rsquo;s musicians played bravely and well, but harp and fiddle and horn were soon drowned beneath a tide of talk and laughter, the clash of cup and plate, and the snarling of hounds fighting for table scraps. The singer sang good songs, &ldquo;Iron Lances&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Burning of the Ships&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Bear and the Maiden Fair,&rdquo; but only Hodor seemed to be listening. He stood beside the piper, hopping from one foot to the other.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>In fact songs and stories play an important role in Bran\u2019s story especially when he meets the Children. Bran wanted to become a knight just as much as Sansa wanted to attend tourneys.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nBran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old Nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another&rsquo;s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\n She pulled a chair close to the hearth, took down one of her favorite books, and lost herself in the stories of Florian and Jonquil, of Lady Shella and the Rainbow Knight, of valiant Prince Aemon and his doomed love for his brother&rsquo;s queen.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\n&ldquo;Prince Aemon the Dragonknight cried the day Princess Naerys wed his brother Aegon,&rdquo; Sansa Stark said, &ldquo;and the twins Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk died with tears on their cheeks after each had given the other a mortal wound.&quot;\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Like Sansa, Bran was excited to go South.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nFor days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own, not a pony but a real horse. His father would be the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the red castle at King&rsquo;s Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, and dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. It gave Bran a shiver just to think of it, but he was not afraid. How could he be afraid? His father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn swords.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>An opinion that Sansa no doubt shared. Unfortunately Bran was almost killed and he had to remain in the North. We know Bran\u2019s fall devastated Sansa</p><blockquote><p>\n\nShe ought to be crying too, she thought, but the tears would not come. Perhaps she had used up all her tears for Lady and Bran.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>and we know Lady\u2019s death hurt Bran.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nBran felt all cold inside. &quot;She lost her wolf,&rdquo; he said, weakly, remembering the day when four of his father&rsquo;s guardsmen had returned from the south with Lady&rsquo;s bones. Summer and Grey Wind and Shaggydog had begun to howl before they crossed the drawbridge, in voices drawn and desolate. Beneath the shadow of the First Keep was an ancient lichyard, its headstones spotted with pale lichen, where the old Kings of Winter had laid their faithful servants. It was there they buried Lady, while her brothers stalked between the graves like restless shadows. She had gone south, and only her bones had returned.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>It was the only time that anyone shows any pain on Sansa\u2019s behalf after Lady dies (with the exception of Ned\u2019s anger whenever he remembered killing Lady). That\u2019s what I love most about the relationship, they can\u2019t see each other but they feel for the other as much as possible. I think this is the most uncomplicated relationship that Sansa has. She likes being a lady and that involves a lot of time in doors but besides the remark about kissing songs, Bran has no problem with what Sansa enjoys. He even remembered the feast they held in Robert\u2019s in honor in which he noted how Sansa was listening intently to the singers without making a disparaging remark, something other characters find difficult. Sansa and Bran\u2019s arcs contain a lot of trauma, something uncomplicated as their love for one another is sweet and will probably go a long way in healing them when they meet again.</p><!-- more --><p>The other thing that I love most about the two of them is how their arcs mirror each other. One could argue that all the remaining Stark siblings have similar journeys but I think Sansa and Bran\u2019s resemble each other closely. In book one, Ned arranges Sansa\u2019s betrothal so he\u2019d have a cover to investigate the Lannisters and wants to use Bran to bridge the gap between Robb and Joffrey. However, their dreams unravel pretty quickly. Bran is disabled and Sansa\u2019s court life meets one set back after another. As a disabled person, I am hesitant to compare the two situations but seeing as the Trident incident laid the foundation for a future of abuse, I\u2019m going to continue. Both Bran and Sansa try to deal with their circumstances, the only difference is that Sansa\u2019s coping mechanism means that she pretends everything is fine.\u00a0</p><p>In A Clash of Kings, both of them find themselves thrust in new situations. While Bran is the second son, he was only 8 when he acted as Lord of Winterfell and he was 7 when Ned was still teaching him, Robb is now King and he only has Luwin and Rodrick as advisors.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\n&ldquo;You are the lord in Winterfell now,&rdquo; Robb told him. He was mounted on a shaggy grey stallion, his shield hung from the horse&rsquo;s side; wood banded with iron, white and grey, and on it the snarling face of a direwolf. His brother wore grey chainmail over bleached leathers, sword and dagger at his waist, a fur-trimmed cloak across his shoulders. &ldquo;You must take my place, as I took Father&rsquo;s, until we come home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Bran replied miserably. He had never felt so little or alone or scared. He did not know how to be a lord.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Sansa is a prisoner of war still betrothed to Joffrey and she has to find a way to survive on her own, something she hasn\u2019t been taught fully.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>The balcony was deserted save for Sansa. She stood with her head bowed, fighting to hold back her tears, while below Joffrey sat on his Iron Throne and dispensed what it pleased him to call justice. Nine cases out of ten seemed to bore him; those he allowed his council to handle, squirming restlessly while Lord Baelish, Grand Maester Pycelle, or Queen Cersei resolved the matter. When he did choose to make a ruling, though, not even his queen mother could sway him.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you with child as soon as you&rsquo;re able,&rdquo; Joffrey said as he escorted her across the practice yard. &ldquo;If the first one is stupid, I&rsquo;ll chop off your head and find a smarter wife&hellip;</p></blockquote><p>Interestingly, they both of the engage in diplomacy (though it\u2019s called courtesy in Sansa\u2019s chapters). The both of them have to bite their tongue often, in Bran\u2019s case usually when he faces ableism or whenever he needs to make a ruling and in Sansa\u2019s case, whenever her family is insulted or when she\u2019s being abused. While they\u2019re unhappy due to the war, the death of their father, the separation of their family, it should be noted that they\u2019re good at their tasks and they survive the book. By the end of A Clash of Kings, their situations grew more bleak. Stannis lost and the Lannisters gained a powerful ally while Winterfell burned. The last few lines of Bran\u2019s last ACoK apply to him and the Starks as whole.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe stone is strong, Bran told himself, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. So long as those remained, Winterfell remained. It was not dead, just broken. Like me, he thought. I&rsquo;m not dead either.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Despite everything, they\u2019re still alive, they still have a fighting chance. In ASoS, Bran and Sansa are focused on one goal each: finding the three eyed crow and escaping King\u2019s Landing (while Sansa has been looking for a way out, the situation became dire enough that merely surviving was not enough, she had to become proactive). Their arcs in the book are filled with hope that either fell through (Willas) or they let go (Jon). Eventually they reach their destinations and meet the men who have affected their lives so completely. For Bran it\u2019s Brynden Rivers, one of the most powerful beings in the world who has been searching for a successor in the war against the Others and for Sansa it\u2019s Littlefinger who caused the War of the Five Kings. Both Bran and Sansa have to go into hiding, Bran in the cave beyond the Wall and Sansa by hiding her identity. It\u2019s important for them to learn from these men despite how morally reprehensible they both are. Neither of them are particularly happy but it\u2019s important for their arc. Many dark elements are either introduced or continued- cannibalism, sexual abuse, human sacrifice, war mongering, etc. Unlike many people in the fandom, I think both Sansa and Bran will react with horror when they learn the full extent of what their mentors are doing and in TWoW, they\u2019ll both reject their mentors and escape them one way or the other.</p><p>When Sansa and Bran meet again, it\u2019s bound to be emotional and loving.

While the two of them weren\u2019t as close as Arya and Jon or Jon and Robb, they have a positive relationship despite having different interests.

The singer sang good songs, \u201cIron Lances\u201d and \u201cThe Burning of the Ships\u201d and \u201cThe Bear and the Maiden Fair,\u201d but only Hodor seemed to be listening. He stood beside the piper, hopping from one foot to the other.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>In fact songs and stories play an important role in Bran\u2019s story especially when he meets the Children. Bran wanted to become a knight just as much as Sansa wanted to attend tourneys.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nBran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old Nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another\u2019s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\n She pulled a chair close to the hearth, took down one of her favorite books, and lost herself in the stories of Florian and Jonquil, of Lady Shella and the Rainbow Knight, of valiant Prince Aemon and his doomed love for his brother\u2019s queen.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\n\u201cPrince Aemon the Dragonknight cried the day Princess Naerys wed his brother Aegon,\u201d Sansa Stark said, \u201cand the twins Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk died with tears on their cheeks after each had given the other a mortal wound.\"\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Like Sansa, Bran was excited to go South.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nFor days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own, not a pony but a real horse. His father would be the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the red castle at King\u2019s Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, and dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. It gave Bran a shiver just to think of it, but he was not afraid. How could he be afraid? His father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn swords.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>An opinion that Sansa no doubt shared. Unfortunately Bran was almost killed and he had to remain in the North. We know Bran\u2019s fall devastated Sansa</p><blockquote><p>\n\nShe ought to be crying too, she thought, but the tears would not come. Perhaps she had used up all her tears for Lady and Bran.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>and we know Lady\u2019s death hurt Bran.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nBran felt all cold inside. \"She lost her wolf,\u201d he said, weakly, remembering the day when four of his father\u2019s guardsmen had returned from the south with Lady\u2019s bones. Summer and Grey Wind and Shaggydog had begun to howl before they crossed the drawbridge, in voices drawn and desolate. Beneath the shadow of the First Keep was an ancient lichyard, its headstones spotted with pale lichen, where the old Kings of Winter had laid their faithful servants. It was there they buried Lady, while her brothers stalked between the graves like restless shadows. She had gone south, and only her bones had returned.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>It was the only time that anyone shows any pain on Sansa\u2019s behalf after Lady dies (with the exception of Ned\u2019s anger whenever he remembered killing Lady). That\u2019s what I love most about the relationship, they can\u2019t see each other but they feel for the other as much as possible. I think this is the most uncomplicated relationship that Sansa has. She likes being a lady and that involves a lot of time in doors but besides the remark about kissing songs, Bran has no problem with what Sansa enjoys. He even remembered the feast they held in Robert\u2019s in honor in which he noted how Sansa was listening intently to the singers without making a disparaging remark, something other characters find difficult. Sansa and Bran\u2019s arcs contain a lot of trauma, something uncomplicated as their love for one another is sweet and will probably go a long way in healing them when they meet again.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The other thing that I love most about the two of them is how their arcs mirror each other. One could argue that all the remaining Stark siblings have similar journeys but I think Sansa and Bran\u2019s resemble each other closely. In book one, Ned arranges Sansa\u2019s betrothal so he\u2019d have a cover to investigate the Lannisters and wants to use Bran to bridge the gap between Robb and Joffrey. However, their dreams unravel pretty quickly. Bran is disabled and Sansa\u2019s court life meets one set back after another. As a disabled person, I am hesitant to compare the two situations but seeing as the Trident incident laid the foundation for a future of abuse, I\u2019m going to continue. Both Bran and Sansa try to deal with their circumstances, the only difference is that Sansa\u2019s coping mechanism means that she pretends everything is fine.\u00a0</p><p>In A Clash of Kings, both of them find themselves thrust in new situations. While Bran is the second son, he was only 8 when he acted as Lord of Winterfell and he was 7 when Ned was still teaching him, Robb is now King and he only has Luwin and Rodrick as advisors.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\u201cYou are the lord in Winterfell now,\u201d Robb told him. He was mounted on a shaggy grey stallion, his shield hung from the horse\u2019s side; wood banded with iron, white and grey, and on it the snarling face of a direwolf. His brother wore grey chainmail over bleached leathers, sword and dagger at his waist, a fur-trimmed cloak across his shoulders. \u201cYou must take my place, as I took Father\u2019s, until we come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Bran replied miserably. He had never felt so little or alone or scared. He did not know how to be a lord.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Sansa is a prisoner of war still betrothed to Joffrey and she has to find a way to survive on her own, something she hasn\u2019t been taught fully.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>The balcony was deserted save for Sansa. She stood with her head bowed, fighting to hold back her tears, while below Joffrey sat on his Iron Throne and dispensed what it pleased him to call justice. Nine cases out of ten seemed to bore him; those he allowed his council to handle, squirming restlessly while Lord Baelish, Grand Maester Pycelle, or Queen Cersei resolved the matter. When he did choose to make a ruling, though, not even his queen mother could sway him.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you with child as soon as you\u2019re able,\u201d Joffrey said as he escorted her across the practice yard. \u201cIf the first one is stupid, I\u2019ll chop off your head and find a smarter wife\u2026</p></blockquote><p>Interestingly, they both of the engage in diplomacy (though it\u2019s called courtesy in Sansa\u2019s chapters). The both of them have to bite their tongue often, in Bran\u2019s case usually when he faces ableism or whenever he needs to make a ruling and in Sansa\u2019s case, whenever her family is insulted or when she\u2019s being abused. While they\u2019re unhappy due to the war, the death of their father, the separation of their family, it should be noted that they\u2019re good at their tasks and they survive the book. By the end of A Clash of Kings, their situations grew more bleak. Stannis lost and the Lannisters gained a powerful ally while Winterfell burned. The last few lines of Bran\u2019s last ACoK apply to him and the Starks as whole.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe stone is strong, Bran told himself, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. So long as those remained, Winterfell remained. It was not dead, just broken. Like me, he thought. I\u2019m not dead either.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Despite everything, they\u2019re still alive, they still have a fighting chance. In ASoS, Bran and Sansa are focused on one goal each: finding the three eyed crow and escaping King\u2019s Landing (while Sansa has been looking for a way out, the situation became dire enough that merely surviving was not enough, she had to become proactive). Their arcs in the book are filled with hope that either fell through (Willas) or they let go (Jon). Eventually they reach their destinations and meet the men who have affected their lives so completely. For Bran it\u2019s Brynden Rivers, one of the most powerful beings in the world who has been searching for a successor in the war against the Others and for Sansa it\u2019s Littlefinger who caused the War of the Five Kings. Both Bran and Sansa have to go into hiding, Bran in the cave beyond the Wall and Sansa by hiding her identity. It\u2019s important for them to learn from these men despite how morally reprehensible they both are. Neither of them are particularly happy but it\u2019s important for their arc. Many dark elements are either introduced or continued- cannibalism, sexual abuse, human sacrifice, war mongering, etc. Unlike many people in the fandom, I think both Sansa and Bran will react with horror when they learn the full extent of what their mentors are doing and in TWoW, they\u2019ll both reject their mentors and escape them one way or the other.</p><p>When Sansa and Bran meet again, it\u2019s bound to be emotional and loving. They have both gone through hell and have been changed by it but deep down they\u2019re still the same compassionate people they always were. As far as the Stark succession crisis, whether the Girl in Grey theory or the Sansa comes North with the Vale Army theory is true, I\u2019m certain Sansa will support Bran\u2019s claim. Regardless of what happens I\u2019m looking forward to them meeting again.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"280\" data-orig-width=\"270\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"lyannas:WzjBYV7zrAORzQc-9cGo2g:ZAFJes2OedKM_\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d3d0043b52219bdf1b79a17fecae4030/tumblr_ouan9aN5oh1s9bcqro4_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"280\" data-orig-width=\"270\"></figure></p>",

I think this is the most uncomplicated relationship that Sansa has. She likes being a lady and that involves a lot of time in doors but besides the remark about kissing songs, Bran has no problem with what Sansa enjoys. He even remembered the feast they held in Robert&rsquo;s in honor in which he noted how Sansa was listening intently to the singers without making a disparaging remark, something other characters find difficult. Sansa and Bran&rsquo;s arcs contain a lot of trauma, something uncomplicated as their love for one another is sweet and will probably go a long way in healing them when they meet again.</p>\n</p>",

You don\u2019t throw nukes at climate change to make it better. That only makes it worse (like giving the NK a dragon). The clear answer to that problem is the person with nature magic (Bran) the only question left will be to see how he does it.",
        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>I\u2019m not sure GRRM ever said that the white walkers and winter is coming are connected to climate change. That seems to be a parallel fans and, in particular, the media have drawn. What he\u2019s said is that he was inspired by\u00a0 real life in building the Lannister vs. Stark conflict while simultaneously adding the distant threat of the White Walkers and D*ny and her dragons by our society\u2019s inability to take climate change seriously and focus on preparing for that threat. So instead of the WW being a representation of climate change per se, GRRM\u2019s commentary is based on the characters\u2019 dismissal of their existence in the same way factions in our own society try to dismiss climate change as an actual, life-threatening problem.\u00a0</p><p>But yes, I agree, the dragons and the WWs are both representatives of extremes and are equally destructive just that in opposite ways (WW with ice; Dragons with fire). In that sense, they represent GRRM\u2019s interpretation of Frost\u2019s poem:\u00a0</p><p>\n\nSome say the world will end in fire,<br/>Some say in ice.<br/>From what I\u2019ve tasted of desire<br/>I hold with those who favor fire.<br/>But if it had to perish twice,<br/>I think I know enough of hate<br/>To say that for destruction ice<br/>Is also great<br/>And would suffice.\n\n<br/></p><p>GRRM has admitted that he was inspired by this poem in naming his series: A song of ice and fire and I\u2019m pretty sure that the portrayal of the WWs and Dragons in his books also hankers back to this poem.
