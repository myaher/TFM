Winterfell was buzzing in preparation for Lord Robb and Lady (YN)\u2019s wedding. It was only going to be a relatively small affair for the future Lord and Lady of the North, being at such short notice not many guests would get all the way to Winterfell in time. Still, the King and his family were there along with a few other houses that still remained from the King\u2019s feast and a small number of other houses were due to arrive before the big day. During those days (YN) wasn\u2019t expected to do anything and it was a strange feeling to her, with such a small household staff back home at Mountainbreak she was used to getting in and doing things. Lady Neasa was the first born child to the chieftain of mountain clan \u2018Hardy\u2019 and she knew the importance of a girl being able to look after herself. With all her family now gone from harsh winters or wildling and Ironborn raids, she knew too well how one can be left alone in the world and she made sure her daughter would not be left helpless, should the same happen to her. So growing up Lady (YN) was given all the lessons she needed to be a proper Lady, however, her parents also made sure she was given all the knowledge and skills she needed to look after herself if the need ever arose. So all this free time was something new to her, the most she had done in preparation for the wedding was to\u00a0try on her dress. Just two days ago her mother had presented her with the very same dress she had worn on her wedding day. (YN) remembered seeing it as a young girl and thinking it was the most beautiful thing she had seen and looking at it now was no different. \u201cMother are you sure you want me to wear it?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Lady Neasa\u2019s eyes began to water, \u201cOf course I do, I didn\u2019t bring it along for me, I\u2019m not planning on getting married again\u201d. Placing her hand over her daughter\u2019s she smiled, \u201cI knew when we left Mountainbreak that we would soon find you a good match. And look, here we are on the first stop of our trip and you\u2019re betrothed the very next day.\u201d Giving her mother a kiss on her cheek (YN) got up to try the dress on.</p><p>\u201cMother it\u2019s perfect\u201d, and it was. Soft snow coloured fabric with dark accents made to look like the markings of their snowy owl sigil. It had a high neck and fitted sleeves right down to the wrists. The waist tapered in before subtly fanning out to the ground. Over the top of the dress was a very warm but delicately fashioned shawl, made to look as though it was created from soft\u00a0pearlescent feathers. Standing there looking at her reflection, her mother came up behind her, \u201cYou look much more beautiful in it than I ever did\u201d, after drying her eyes Neasa tried distracting herself by adjusting the dress on (YN)\u2019s frame, \u201cThe waist will need to be brought in a bit and the hem taken up at the bottom slightly, Lady Sansa has offered to do any alterations, well she actually insisted on doing them\u201d.</p><p>As (YN) stood there listening to her mother, the reality of all the changes this wedding would bring, came flooding into her mind like the rain of a soaking wet day. Her life as she had always known it, was never going to be the same. It saddened her and excited her equally, never again would her parents just be there when she needed them, she would miss horse rides with her brother, helping in the Mountainbreak kitchens, there was so much she would miss about that place. But waiting in front of her in just a couple of days\u2019 time stood a whole new life, new people, new adventures and Robb. \u201cI really wish Angus could be here with us, I am going to miss you all so much\u201d.</p><p>Neasa tried to not let the tears fall again, \u201cyour brother really would have loved to be here, but he understands that Mountainbreak always needs its Lord at its hearth\u201d.</p><p>(YN) knew her mother was right, Mountainbreak was too isolated and unpredictable to run itself and this was the perfect opportunity for Angus to test the knowledge and skills he gained from father and mother. Tears began to gather at the corner of (YN)\u2019s eyes and as she wiped them away she was thankful to hear a knock at the door. Both herself and her mother were in desperate need of a distraction, before their tears really gathered momentum. Neasa opened the door and found Sansa standing there rather impatiently. All (YN) could hear were Sansa\u2019s excited words, \u201cLady Neasa, does she have the dress on yet?\u201d</p><p>Neasa opened the door fully, letting Sansa though and when she saw the dress she almost squealed. \u201cThat dress looks absolutely stunning on you Lady (YN). Robb is going to have a hard time remembering what to do when he sees you\u201d. Walking over to (YN) Sansa gave a closer inspection, taking note of the alterations she will need to make. \u201cLady Neasa this dress really is something special, did you make it yourself?\u201d</p><p>(YN) was glad Sansa was preoccupied with the dress because she felt rather flustered at her comment and didn\u2019t know what to do or say.\u00a0 Neasa laughed\u00a0loudly at Sansa\u2019s question. \u201cNo definitely not, needlework is in no way a talent of mine. My mother use to pull her hair out trying to teach me, I just didn\u2019t have the patience\u201d. Neasa walked over to her daughter and started fussing with her hair, probably to see what styles would suit the dress, \u201c(YN) is very good though, I had to get a lady in from the village to teach her.\u201d</p><p>Sansa stood up straight taking a step back to admire the dress again, \u201cI hope I will look this beautiful when I wed Prince Joffrey\u201d.</p><p>(YN) found it hard to think of this sweet and naive young girl marrying the Prince, she did not like the boy. He was rude and obnoxious to his family and their household and when she was around him there was a steady feeling of unease in the pit of her stomach. Sansa however, felt no such feelings and constantly talked about how wonderful and charming he was. For Sansa\u2019s sake (YN) prayed she was wrong about him, \u201cOf course you will be beautiful, just look at you, Prince Joffrey must consider himself very lucky.\u201d</p><p>Sansa seemed pleased with (YN)\u2019s reply smiling as she finished pinning up the dress, \u201cI think that should do it, it won\u2019t take me long to make the adjustments, I\u2019ll bring it back tomorrow for you to try it on again\u201d.</p><p>That night (YN) couldn\u2019t sleep, tossing and turning in her big cosy bed for what felt like hours, her brain just wouldn\u2019t shut down. Kicking off the furs she moved around her chambers trying to expel some energy. Being awake for so long now she was getting hungry again, silently cursing herself for not eating enough at dinner. Hearing her stomach talking, she looked over to the small table in the corner and found only fruit there. \u2018That\u2019s not going to help\u2019 she thought to herself, but she wasn\u2019t about to wake her chambermaid to go fetch her some food. Deciding she was too awake and too hungry to sleep, she looked down at herself in her nightgown and thought it best to quickly change, not knowing if there would be anyone still up. Making her way quietly out of her chambers she headed towards the kitchens. The hallways were very different this late at night, much more peaceful, the flickering glow of light from the torches hitting the stone walls was comforting. (YN) almost felt as if she was back home at Mountainbreak. Passing a few King\u2019s guards along the way, she greeted them silently with a nod of her head until she passed \u2018The Hound\u2019. Since her arrival at Winterfell, she had only seen him from a distance and she had to admit he was an imposing and intimidating figure. Looking at him now though, with only a short distance between them she could tell he was a gruff man, but there was goodness in his eyes. As she neared him she spoke while looking directly into them, \u201cGood evening Lord Clegane\u201d. Sandor was surprised by Lady (YN)\u2019s greeting, normally people rush past him without even a sideways glance. But here she was looking right at him with no hint of unease, carrying a friendly smile on her lips.</p><p>Sandor replied in his usual grumpy manner, \u201cIsn&rsquo;t it too late to be wanderin&rsquo; round by yourself? You should be sleepin\u201d.</p><p>(YN) inwardly laughed at his surely tone, \u201cProbably, but my stomach has other ideas, it&rsquo;s not going to let me rest until I&rsquo;ve fed it, would you like me to bring you something back?\u201d</p><p>While considering her words, Sandor realised this girl was not like other Lady&rsquo;s, she was different, why didn&rsquo;t she shy away from him? Like everyone else. \u201cNah, I better wait til I&rsquo;m done here&quot;, (YN) only nodded her head and continued on down the hall, when she heard him say, \u201cOn second thoughts maybe I&rsquo;ll have a chicken if there&rsquo;s any left\u201d.</p><p>Turning around she chuckled quietly and nodded her head again, \u201cI&rsquo;ll see what I can do, Lord Clegane\u201d.</p><p>Knowing her way around Winterfell quite well now, she could see the kitchen doorway ahead of her, a soft glowing light coming from inside. Nearing the entrance (YN) saw a dark headed figure sitting by a large wooden table in the centre. When she realised it was Jon Snow her feet staggered slightly and she contemplated whether to head back to her chambers, for she really didn&rsquo;t know him very well. Having only being introduced to him by Robb that one time, he always seemed to keep his distance. It was too late now though Jon was already looking at her, his eyes wide. Saying the first thing that sprung to mind she felt as though she was babbling, \u201cI hope I&rsquo;m not disturbing you Lord Snow, but I feel so hungry that it&rsquo;s keeping me awake. I need to eat something now or I&rsquo;ll never sleep\u201d. It must have sounded amusing because he gave a soft warm laugh, making her exhale and smile.</p><p>As he heard footsteps reaching the doorway, Jon looked up wondering who it could possibly be at this time of night. \u00a0When his eyes landed on a small figure, he quietly sighed, \u2018of all the people it had to be her, Lady (YN)\u2019. \u00a0Finding her standing shyly in the doorway, he realised he was staring, but he couldn\u2019t find any words. \u00a0When she spoke, it made him laugh, putting her at ease as she made her way into the kitchen. \u00a0Coming into better view as the candle\u2019s bathed her in a soft yellow light, Jon noticed how she tried to tame her messy (H/C) hair and smooth out her crumpled dress. Even in her tousled state, Jon found her adorable and captivating, finally admitting to himself that he had never seen a more beautiful girl. \u00a0Jon stood as she walked in and sat down on the opposite side of the table, \u201cAre you having the same trouble Lord Snow?\u201d</p><p>Sitting back down Jon smiled, to his side was a large plate of bread, cheese and leftover roast meat which he had been picking at for the past hour. \u00a0Sliding it over to (YN), he gestured for her to help herself. \u00a0\u201cAye I am, you know you can just call me Jon, I\u2019m not a Lord\u201d. \u00a0There was no malice to his tone, he was simply pointing out the fact. \u00a0</p><p>Grabbing some bread and slicing some cheese she replied, \u201cI know, but I didn\u2019t want to seem impolite\u201d. Taking a bite, (YN) was grateful to finally have some food in her belly and the chance to speak to her soon to be \u2018brother by law\u2019. \u00a0Glancing back up at him, while taking another bite she noticed him staring off into the darkness as if in deep thought and she was right. \u00a0Jon was having a hard time deciding whether to leave or not, he knew he should, but he just couldn\u2019t do it. \u00a0In the end he decided to stay, telling himself that it wouldn\u2019t be right to leave a Lady alone at night in a strange castle.</p><p>Trying to think of something to say, he turned his head towards her and said the first thing that came to mind, \u201cYou\u2019re very good with the bow and arrow, easily the best I\u2019ve seen. Arya can\u2019t stop talking about you, you\u2019ve made quite an impression\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThank you Jon\u201d, was all (YN) could think to say, his compliment took her off guard and the embarrassment was clear on her face. \u00a0Even in the low candlelight, Jon could see her cheeks grow red and he fought the urge to reach out and touch them. \u00a0Instead, he turned to the bench behind him, grabbing another glass to offer her refreshment.</p><p>Holding the glass between them, he asked her whether she wanted any wine or ale, \u201cwine please, with any luck it will help me grow tired, it usually does. \u00a0I should have had some at dinner and then maybe I would have fallen asleep hours ago\u201d. \u00a0Wondering why she was babbling again and putting it down to her lack of sleep (YN) asked Jon a question, in hopes it would stop her from talking so much drivel. \u201cRobb tells me that you\u2019re leaving for the Night\u2019s Watch soon, why?\u201d</p><p>Handing over the glass of wine, her fingers brushed the side of his as she took it from his hands and the warmth of the contact travelled throughout his whole body. \u00a0Trying to ignore the sensation he moved his hands away quickly and placed them under the table. \u00a0\u201cAye, I\u2019ve wanted to join for as long as I can remember, I\u2019ll be leaving the same day as father and my sisters\u201d. \u00a0Looking at her face he could tell she wasn\u2019t satisfied by the answer and was waiting for more, her (E/C) eyes looking at his with curiosity. \u201cThere is not very much I can really offer anyone here, at least at the Night\u2019s Watch I can do something useful\u201d. The curiosity in her eyes transformed to something else, was it empathy? Or maybe compassion? He wasn\u2019t sure, but he felt like she understood a lot more from his words than he intended.</p><p>Hearing his words made (YN) feel heavy-hearted, she didn\u2019t know him very well at all, but from what she gathered his family loved him very much. \u00a0Well, Lady Catelyn being the exception, (YN) could see she barely tolerated him and that her opinions had rubbed off on Sansa somewhat. \u00a0However, sitting across from him now, barely at an arm\u2019s length she could tell he was good and kind. \u00a0Surely he didn\u2019t believe there was no use or need for him here amongst his family. \u00a0Feeling as though she wanted to tell him he was wrong and knowing that she shouldn\u2019t (YN) instead replied, \u201cI\u2019m sure you will do very well for yourself at the Night\u2019s Watch, from what I\u2019ve seen in the training yard you\u2019re very good with a sword. And I\u2019m sure they are always happy to have a Stark amongst their ranks\u201d.</p><p>Her words felt very kind and genuine, stirring up strange feelings, but they were untrue, \u201cI\u2019m not a Stark though, I\u2019m a bastard\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t know how or why she almost looked offended by what he said, but she did. \u00a0Giving a little sigh (YN) took a breath, \u201cJon, you have just as much Stark blood running through your veins as your siblings, you are a Stark, it doesn\u2019t matter how you spell your last name. \u00a0Just as I am as much a Hardy, as I am a (YLN)\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Not knowing what to say, Jon just sat there, his eyes staring at the cup of ale in his hands. \u00a0After a long moment of silence (YN) continued and he lifted his gaze to meet hers. \u201cMy mother and I are the last of our line, my grandfather was the Chieftain for Clan Hardy, his father and grandfather\u2019s before him stretched back thousands of years to the first men\u201d. \u00a0Taking a moment before continuing, her face filled with conviction, \u201cHis line finished with the death of his sons, now Clan Hardy has a new line of chieftains, but that does not erase who I am. \u00a0And I will make sure any children I am blessed with, know who their ancestors are, regardless of whether they come from a great house, clan or otherwise\u201d. \u00a0Jon just sat there not knowing what to say, why did her words affect him like this? It was clear she held no prejudice towards bastards and for some reason it meant the world to him. \u00a0\u201cSorry Jon, normally I don\u2019t talk this much, it must be my lack of sleep\u201d.</p><p>Taking a sip from the cup of ale he still held, Jon shook his head, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to apologise, but can I ask you a question?\u201d (YN) only nodded her head in reply, wisps of hair falling into her beautiful face. \u00a0\u201cIs your brother not your mother\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>Spinning the sharp knife between her fingers she stopped to cut herself some more cheese, \u201cAngus was born a Snow like you, just after my father returned from King Robert\u2019s rebellion. Father didn\u2019t know of his existence until the mother died a few months later\u201d.\u00a0 As she looked out into the darkness of the kitchen Jon could see a fond smile appear on her lips, \u201cby the time Angus arrived at Mountainbreak, mother and father were already married and expecting me\u201d.</p><p>Jon now understood why (YN) spoke the way she did when he called himself a bastard, \u2018her brother was born one and she loved him anyway\u2019. \u00a0Nodding his head in understanding Jon gave a small smile and exhaled, \u201cand your father, when did he legitimize Lord Angus?\u201d</p><p>(YN) answered straight away without hesitation, \u201cbefore I was born, at my mother\u2019s insistence. \u00a0She loved him from the day he arrived, like he was her own\u201d. \u00a0Jon was surprised by what (YN) was telling him, it made for a very different story to his, \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter to her whether I had been born a boy or girl. Angus was fathers first born son, bastard or not.\u201d</p><p>Without Jon even speaking she knew what he was thinking, he was comparing Lady Catelyn to her mother and it upset (YN) to think he didn\u2019t have the same loving childhood as Angus. \u00a0\u201cYour mother sounds like a pretty amazing lady\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is\u201d picking up a piece of bread (YN) took a small bite as if to distract herself. \u00a0It was obvious to Jon she was thinking about her parents impending departure, not wanting to see her this way Jon changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cI know you and Robb haven\u2019t known each other very long, but I can tell he thinks the world of you\u201d. \u00a0There was the smile he wanted to see, it was only a small smile but somehow it reached her eyes which were now full of life. He was glad to see she had genuine feelings for his brother, even if it did break his heart a little. \u00a0\u201cHe is a good brother and a good man, I know he will be a good husband\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think he will and I hope I can make him a good wife\u201d. \u00a0Before Jon had a chance to reply (YN)\u2019s cheeks dimpled with a cheeky smile, \u201che tells me he has a surprise for me tomorrow, a chance for us to spend some time alone before we marry, do you know what he is planning? He refuses to tell me\u201d.</p><p>Jon laughed at her expression, it was pleading and hopeful and if he knew what Robb had planned he would have found it difficult to not tell her. \u00a0\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know\u201d, she tilted her head to the side and raised her eyebrows, as if she didn\u2019t believe him. \u00a0Putting his hands palms up in front of himself, he laughed again, \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t\u201d. \u00a0Seeming satisfied with his answer, she put her hand loosely over her mouth and gave the most unladylike yawn he had ever seen and he found it absolutely endearing.</p><p>Rubbing her eyes, (YN) stood, \u201cI think I\u2019m finally ready for bed, thank you for your company Jon, it was nice to finally get the chance to speak to you\u201d. \u00a0Standing up Jon wished he could escort her back to her chambers, but knew there were too many guards along the way. \u00a0It would not be good for her reputation if they thought she was running around at night with the bastard of Winterfell. \u00a0Instead, he bid her a simple goodnight as she excused herself from the kitchen, but she turned around before she even reached the door. \u00a0\u201cOh, I almost forgot, do you mind if I take some of the food, I promised Lord Clegane a plate. \u00a0I\u2019m sure a man that size must require constant sustenance\u201d.</p><p>Why was he not surprised by this thoughtful gesture, no one can even look at \u2018The Hound\u2019 and here she was offering him food. \u00a0Shaking his head fondly Jon gently pushed the plate across the table, \u201cof course, take it. Goodnight Lady (YN)\u201d. \u00a0Once she had left the kitchen he blew out the candles and made his way to his own chambers, knowing that this beautiful girl, whether he liked it or not, had found a permanent place in his heart.</p><p>It was a rather cold and frosty morning, the sun was nowhere in sight and thick, heavy clouds filled the sky, casting a dreary grey light across Winterfell. \u00a0Not that (YN) and Robb noticed, they were absorbed in their own little world filled with blue skies and wispy white clouds. \u00a0Walking hand in hand, (YN) looked up at Robb and for the third time asked, \u201cplease tell me where we are going\u201d.</p><p>Laughing at her impatience he looked at her and smiled, then standing still he spoke, \u201cI don\u2019t need to, we\u2019re here\u201d. \u00a0They were standing in front of the stables, when (YN) peered inside she saw two horses saddled and ready to go. \u00a0\u201cYou have spoken so fondly of going horse riding with your brother and I know I\u2019m not Lord Angus, but I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll do until you see him next.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The look on Robb\u2019s face was so anxious and sweet (YN) thought her heart would melt. \u00a0Turning to face him completely, she reached up on to her toes and placed the softest kiss on his cheek, feeling the soft stubble of his short beard under her lips. \u00a0\u201cOf course you will do, a ride sounds absolutely wonderful\u201d. \u00a0Holding her hand gently behind him, Robb pulled her through the stable door. \u00a0Letting go, (YN) moved towards the horses and stood between them, giving them both a pat on their necks. \u00a0\u201cWhich one will I be riding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhichever one you want, they are both good horses and easy to ride\u201d. \u00a0Robb watched her as she rubbed the snout of the chestnut mare and turning to Hodor with a joyful expression, she thanked him for preparing the horses. By the time Robb had made his way over to help her up, she was already sitting in the saddle and ready to go. \u00a0Quietly impressed he mounted his horse, \u201cWell, let\u2019s get going then\u201d. \u00a0Once they moved past Winter Town, they were able to ride more freely and Robb couldn\u2019t believe how well she rode and how graceful she looked doing it. \u00a0But it was the look on her face that had him mesmerized, looking so free and happy, without a worry in the world, he hoped he would see that same look every day from then on. \u00a0By evening tomorrow, he would be able to call this brilliant girl his wife and he just couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off his face thinking about it.</p><p>(YN) stopped a moment to tidy up her hair, all the riding had caused it to become a terrible mess, quietly she cursed herself for not being able to do her own braids, \u2018I should have gotten Tess to braid it for me this morning\u2019. \u00a0By this time Robb had pulled his horse to a stop beside her. \u00a0They had been riding for most of the morning and Robb was enjoying himself so much he almost forgot about the special lunch he had planned. \u00a0\u201cWe should probably head back now, for the next part of your surprise\u201d.</p><p>(YN) stopped trying to tie her hair up, it was a waste of time anyway and with a shocked look on her face she said, \u201cyou mean to tell me there\u2019s more\u201d.</p><p>Leaning over towards her with both hands still on the reigns, he gave her a quick kiss on her soft lips. \u00a0\u201cAye\u201d, was all he said, before his face washed over with a look of pure mischief. Racing off ahead of her, he turned his head around, \u201cI\u2019ll race you back to Winter Town\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Without hesitation (YN) set off after him laughing, \u201cRobb Stark, you cheat\u201d. \u00a0Leaning down over her horse\u2019s mane she whispered, \u201ccome on girl let\u2019s catch these boy\u2019s\u201d and off they went picking up speed and gaining ground. \u00a0Feeling her mare hold back a little, (YN) gave it another gentle squeeze with her legs and before she knew it, she was right on their tale, \u201cyou better not let me win Stark, I want to win this fair and square.\u201d</p><p>Robb was shocked at how quickly (YN) had caught up. \u00a0One second she was trailing behind him, the next she was in his ear warning him to not take it easy on her. \u00a0Soon she had started inching ahead, her long (H/C) hair trailing behind her. \u00a0Giving his horse a little kick, he tried to keep up but it was pointless, every time he picked up speed she almost doubled it. \u00a0Reaching the perimeters of Winter Town (YN) slowed down and Robb soon caught up, \u201cPlease remind me to never, ever challenge you to a race again my lady\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>A little out of breath she rubbed the length of the mare\u2019s neck, \u201cbeautiful girl\u201d she said before turning her attention to Robb, \u201cmaybe next time you should give me a slower horse\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>This was a side of (YN) he hadn\u2019t seen yet and he loved it. Normally she was always so quiet and humble and sweet and he absolutely adored her for it. \u00a0But right now with her hair windswept and falling down around her face and her cheeks flushed from riding, her eyes and words were filled with a playful smugness leaving him breathless. \u00a0Clearing his throat and looking a little sheepish Robb admitted, \u201cThat mare there, is the slowest of the two\u201d.</p><p>Biting her bottom lip and smiling at the same time she replied light-heartedly, \u201cthen maybe next time you should give me a donkey\u201d.</p><p>Robb couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her teasing words, loving that she seemed more relaxed, like she was really beginning to be herself around him and if he thought he was smitten before, he now knew for sure. \u00a0\u201cWell then, let\u2019s get these horses back to the stables, I think your mare has earnt a good rest\u201d.</p><p>(YN) looked up at Robb as he guided her through the Godswood, a peaceful and contented look on his face, \u201cThank you, Robb, for taking me riding, I had the most wonderful time\u201d.</p><p>Squeezing her hand gently, he let it go and replied, \u201cAnytime\u201d, he continued walking while he carefully removed a leaf from her hair, \u201ctell me how did you learn to ride like that?\u201d</p><p>All signs of her playful smugness gone, (YN) gave a small shrug of her shoulders, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess it\u2019s just because I love riding so much and I use to do it all the time.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Stopping in front of a large stone wall at the edge of the Godswood, Robb gestured towards an archway, \u201cFor the life of me, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t bring you here when I showed you around the other day\u201d. \u00a0When he looked at her, (YN) noticed how his cheeks blushed in the slightest way, \u201cthe Gods know how hard I tried to stretch out our time together\u201d.</p><p>Walking through the archway (YN) saw the most magnificent glass garden, so much more impressive than the one back at Mountainbreak. \u00a0It was enormous, with a high pitched roof and gables everywhere, looking as though there was a small forest inside. \u00a0As Robb opened the door for her, he soaked in the look of wonder on her features and lead her in with a hand on her lower back. Once inside (YN) felt her mouth drop open, up the back it was just like any other glass garden, growing various fruit and vegetables, but up the front it took on a whole new life. \u00a0Filled with beautiful exotic trees and colourful flowers everywhere, it was like nothing she had ever seen before. \u00a0Now realising where all the pretty flowers in her chambers came from, (YN) silently laughed at herself for not figuring it out sooner. Set in the middle of the garden was a large fur, upon it lay a basket overflowing with food and refreshment. Coming up behind her, Robb began to gently rub her upper arms and (YN) spun around to face him, \u201cWhen did you organise all this?</p><p>Taking one of her hands, he walked over to the fur and they sat down together, \u201cI planned it all out yesterday, well it was all my idea, but Sansa and one of the kitchen hands organised everything\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Feeling warm in the glass garden (YN) moved to take off her cloak, placing it behind her, \u201cWell it looks lovely and this is such a perfect setting, we have nothing like this back home\u201d. \u00a0Robb a little surprised, asked whether Mountainbreak had a glass garden to which she replied with a smile, \u201cOf course we have one, we couldn\u2019t survive without it. \u00a0We just don\u2019t grow any flowers or ornamental trees, all the space is used for growing food\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAye, that makes sense. \u00a0Actually, that\u2019s one of the reasons I wanted to bring you here\u201d, picking a perfectly formed snow white rose, he placed it in her hand. \u201cFather tells me this whole section of the garden will be gone soon, that we will need all the available space to grow food for the oncoming long winter\u201d.</p><p>Lifting the rose to her nose (YN) took in a deep breath, smiling at the sweet fragrance, nodding her head she spoke, \u201cYes father thinks there is a long winter coming, far longer than one I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Even with all the talk of winter, Robb felt hot, his cloak too heavy for the warmth of the glass garden. \u00a0Removing his cloak and putting it aside, he reached over and grabbed the basket, \u201cWell, let\u2019s enjoy the garden while we have it\u201d. \u00a0Sitting there, they ate, chatted and laughed, talking about many things, stories of their families, their childhood, their favourite foods and pastimes. \u00a0Both of them relishing in the chance to get to know one another. \u00a0Feeling more and more content in each other\u2019s company, (YN) lay there resting her head in Robb\u2019s lap. \u00a0Lifting his hand from her soft hair he traced over the line of her collarbone, the feel of her skin like silk under his fingertips. \u00a0After a long and comfortable moment of silence, Robb picked up and studied the pendants hanging from the chain around her neck, \u201cYou always wear this don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Sitting up (YN) turned to face him, now holding the pendants between her fingers. \u00a0One was a Snowy Owl, her father\u2019s sigil and the other her mother\u2019s, an Ironwood tree for Clan Hardy. \u00a0\u201cYes, my parents gave them to me on my last nameday, I like to always have them with me\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Leaning over to his cloak, Robb reached in and pulled out a small box, with a nervous bite of his bottom lip he placed it in her hands. \u00a0\u201cI was going to give this to you tomorrow after we marry, but I\u2019ve decided I cannot wait\u201d. \u00a0Looking down at the box, (YN) took a breath and looked back up at Robb who gave her a nod of encouragement, \u201cgo on, open it\u201d. \u00a0When she did, she was overcome, sitting inside was a small pendant of a Direwolf, not knowing what to say she looked at Robb again, emotion clear in her eyes. \u00a0\u201cI was hoping you might like to add it to your other pendants\u201d. \u00a0Placing a hand on the side of her face he leaned over, tenderly connecting his lips with hers. \u00a0It was their longest kiss yet and both of them felt its intensity soar, neither one wanting to stop. \u00a0Robb reluctantly pulled away, taking a deep breath to calm down his racing heart. \u00a0Biting his bottom lip again he looked at (YN), finding her gazing back with the shyest smile and rosy red cheeks, it made him want to reach out and kiss her again.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Robb, I love it, it\u2019s beautiful\u201d. \u00a0Holding the pendant between her fingers, she gave him a hug and laid back down to rest her head in his lap. \u00a0It really did mean the world to her, it made her feel like she belonged. \u00a0A symbol from Robb to show her she was part of his family. \u00a0And as he sat there running his fingers through her hair, she knew she would add it to her chain tomorrow and never take it off.</p><p>\u00a0<b>TAGS : <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muxxAdObOV7oiq-55ffCLWQ\">@tessimagines</a> @heyohheyitsgabi <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mv9SWQpRHeTbpskIckhot1Q\">@maiabiovillage</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOn4_RynNhEwwfPbfuqPKOw\">@majlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvyss4GQOII-MZ90CPN5PhA\">@givemeanorigami</a></b></p>",

Winterfell was buzzing in preparation for Lord Robb and Lady (YN)\u2019s wedding. It was only going to be a relatively small affair for the future Lord and Lady of the North, being at such short notice not many guests would get all the way to Winterfell in time.

Lady Neasa was the first born child to the chieftain of mountain clan \u2018Hardy\u2019 and she knew the importance of a girl being able to look after herself.

So all this free time was something new to her, the most she had done in preparation for the wedding was to\u00a0try on her dress. Just two days ago her mother had presented her with the very same dress she had worn on her wedding day. (YN) remembered seeing it as a young girl and thinking it was the most beautiful thing she had seen and looking at it now was no different. \u201cMother are you sure you want me to wear it?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Lady Neasa\u2019s eyes began to water, \u201cOf course I do, I didn\u2019t bring it along for me, I\u2019m not planning on getting married again\u201d. Placing her hand over her daughter\u2019s she smiled, \u201cI knew when we left Mountainbreak that we would soon find you a good match. And look, here we are on the first stop of our trip and you\u2019re betrothed the very next day.\u201d Giving her mother a kiss on her cheek (YN) got up to try the dress on.</p><p>\u201cMother it\u2019s perfect\u201d, and it was. Soft snow coloured fabric with dark accents made to look like the markings of their snowy owl sigil. It had a high neck and fitted sleeves right down to the wrists. The waist tapered in before subtly fanning out to the ground. Over the top of the dress was a very warm but delicately fashioned shawl, made to look as though it was created from soft\u00a0pearlescent feathers. Standing there looking at her reflection, her mother came up behind her, \u201cYou look much more beautiful in it than I ever did\u201d, after drying her eyes Neasa tried distracting herself by adjusting the dress on (YN)\u2019s frame, \u201cThe waist will need to be brought in a bit and the hem taken up at the bottom slightly, Lady Sansa has offered to do any alterations, well she actually insisted on doing them\u201d.</p><p>As (YN) stood there listening to her mother, the reality of all the changes this wedding would bring, came flooding into her mind like the rain of a soaking wet day. Her life as she had always known it, was never going to be the same. It saddened her and excited her equally, never again would her parents just be there when she needed them, she would miss horse rides with her brother, helping in the Mountainbreak kitchens, there was so much she would miss about that place. But waiting in front of her in just a couple of days\u2019 time stood a whole new life, new people, new adventures and Robb. \u201cI really wish Angus could be here with us, I am going to miss you all so much\u201d.</p><p>Neasa tried to not let the tears fall again, \u201cyour brother really would have loved to be here, but he understands that Mountainbreak always needs its Lord at its hearth\u201d.</p><p>(YN) knew her mother was right, Mountainbreak was too isolated and unpredictable to run itself and this was the perfect opportunity for Angus to test the knowledge and skills he gained from father and mother. Tears began to gather at the corner of (YN)\u2019s eyes and as she wiped them away she was thankful to hear a knock at the door. Both herself and her mother were in desperate need of a distraction, before their tears really gathered momentum. Neasa opened the door and found Sansa standing there rather impatiently. All (YN) could hear were Sansa\u2019s excited words, \u201cLady Neasa, does she have the dress on yet?\u201d</p><p>Neasa opened the door fully, letting Sansa though and when she saw the dress she almost squealed. \u201cThat dress looks absolutely stunning on you Lady (YN). Robb is going to have a hard time remembering what to do when he sees you\u201d. Walking over to (YN) Sansa gave a closer inspection, taking note of the alterations she will need to make. \u201cLady Neasa this dress really is something special, did you make it yourself?\u201d</p><p>(YN) was glad Sansa was preoccupied with the dress because she felt rather flustered at her comment and didn\u2019t know what to do or say.\u00a0 Neasa laughed\u00a0loudly at Sansa\u2019s question. \u201cNo definitely not, needlework is in no way a talent of mine. My mother use to pull her hair out trying to teach me, I just didn\u2019t have the patience\u201d. Neasa walked over to her daughter and started fussing with her hair, probably to see what styles would suit the dress, \u201c(YN) is very good though, I had to get a lady in from the village to teach her.\u201d</p><p>Sansa stood up straight taking a step back to admire the dress again, \u201cI hope I will look this beautiful when I wed Prince Joffrey\u201d.</p><p>(YN) found it hard to think of this sweet and naive young girl marrying the Prince, she did not like the boy. He was rude and obnoxious to his family and their household and when she was around him there was a steady feeling of unease in the pit of her stomach. Sansa however, felt no such feelings and constantly talked about how wonderful and charming he was. For Sansa\u2019s sake (YN) prayed she was wrong about him, \u201cOf course you will be beautiful, just look at you, Prince Joffrey must consider himself very lucky.\u201d</p><p>Sansa seemed pleased with (YN)\u2019s reply smiling as she finished pinning up the dress, \u201cI think that should do it, it won\u2019t take me long to make the adjustments, I\u2019ll bring it back tomorrow for you to try it on again\u201d.</p><p>That night (YN) couldn\u2019t sleep, tossing and turning in her big cosy bed for what felt like hours, her brain just wouldn\u2019t shut down. Kicking off the furs she moved around her chambers trying to expel some energy. Being awake for so long now she was getting hungry again, silently cursing herself for not eating enough at dinner. Hearing her stomach talking, she looked over to the small table in the corner and found only fruit there. \u2018That\u2019s not going to help\u2019 she thought to herself, but she wasn\u2019t about to wake her chambermaid to go fetch her some food. Deciding she was too awake and too hungry to sleep, she looked down at herself in her nightgown and thought it best to quickly change, not knowing if there would be anyone still up. Making her way quietly out of her chambers she headed towards the kitchens. The hallways were very different this late at night, much more peaceful, the flickering glow of light from the torches hitting the stone walls was comforting. (YN) almost felt as if she was back home at Mountainbreak. Passing a few King\u2019s guards along the way, she greeted them silently with a nod of her head until she passed \u2018The Hound\u2019. Since her arrival at Winterfell, she had only seen him from a distance and she had to admit he was an imposing and intimidating figure. Looking at him now though, with only a short distance between them she could tell he was a gruff man, but there was goodness in his eyes. As she neared him she spoke while looking directly into them, \u201cGood evening Lord Clegane\u201d. Sandor was surprised by Lady (YN)\u2019s greeting, normally people rush past him without even a sideways glance. But here she was looking right at him with no hint of unease, carrying a friendly smile on her lips.</p><p>Sandor replied in his usual grumpy manner, \u201cIsn\u2019t it too late to be wanderin\u2019 round by yourself? You should be sleepin\u201d.</p><p>(YN) inwardly laughed at his surely tone, \u201cProbably, but my stomach has other ideas, it\u2019s not going to let me rest until I\u2019ve fed it, would you like me to bring you something back?\u201d</p><p>While considering her words, Sandor realised this girl was not like other Lady\u2019s, she was different, why didn\u2019t she shy away from him? Like everyone else. \u201cNah, I better wait til I\u2019m done here\", (YN) only nodded her head and continued on down the hall, when she heard him say, \u201cOn second thoughts maybe I\u2019ll have a chicken if there\u2019s any left\u201d.</p><p>Turning around she chuckled quietly and nodded her head again, \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do, Lord Clegane\u201d.</p><p>Knowing her way around Winterfell quite well now, she could see the kitchen doorway ahead of her, a soft glowing light coming from inside. Nearing the entrance (YN) saw a dark headed figure sitting by a large wooden table in the centre. When she realised it was Jon Snow her feet staggered slightly and she contemplated whether to head back to her chambers, for she really didn\u2019t know him very well. Having only being introduced to him by Robb that one time, he always seemed to keep his distance. It was too late now though Jon was already looking at her, his eyes wide. Saying the first thing that sprung to mind she felt as though she was babbling, \u201cI hope I\u2019m not disturbing you Lord Snow, but I feel so hungry that it\u2019s keeping me awake. I need to eat something now or I\u2019ll never sleep\u201d. It must have sounded amusing because he gave a soft warm laugh, making her exhale and smile.</p><p>As he heard footsteps reaching the doorway, Jon looked up wondering who it could possibly be at this time of night. \u00a0When his eyes landed on a small figure, he quietly sighed, \u2018of all the people it had to be her, Lady (YN)\u2019. \u00a0Finding her standing shyly in the doorway, he realised he was staring, but he couldn\u2019t find any words. \u00a0When she spoke, it made him laugh, putting her at ease as she made her way into the kitchen. \u00a0Coming into better view as the candle\u2019s bathed her in a soft yellow light, Jon noticed how she tried to tame her messy (H/C) hair and smooth out her crumpled dress. Even in her tousled state, Jon found her adorable and captivating, finally admitting to himself that he had never seen a more beautiful girl. \u00a0Jon stood as she walked in and sat down on the opposite side of the table, \u201cAre you having the same trouble Lord Snow?\u201d</p><p>Sitting back down Jon smiled, to his side was a large plate of bread, cheese and leftover roast meat which he had been picking at for the past hour. \u00a0Sliding it over to (YN), he gestured for her to help herself. \u00a0\u201cAye I am, you know you can just call me Jon, I\u2019m not a Lord\u201d. \u00a0There was no malice to his tone, he was simply pointing out the fact. \u00a0</p><p>Grabbing some bread and slicing some cheese she replied, \u201cI know, but I didn\u2019t want to seem impolite\u201d. Taking a bite, (YN) was grateful to finally have some food in her belly and the chance to speak to her soon to be \u2018brother by law\u2019. \u00a0Glancing back up at him, while taking another bite she noticed him staring off into the darkness as if in deep thought and she was right. \u00a0Jon was having a hard time deciding whether to leave or not, he knew he should, but he just couldn\u2019t do it. \u00a0In the end he decided to stay, telling himself that it wouldn\u2019t be right to leave a Lady alone at night in a strange castle.</p><p>Trying to think of something to say, he turned his head towards her and said the first thing that came to mind, \u201cYou\u2019re very good with the bow and arrow, easily the best I\u2019ve seen. Arya can\u2019t stop talking about you, you\u2019ve made quite an impression\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThank you Jon\u201d, was all (YN) could think to say, his compliment took her off guard and the embarrassment was clear on her face. \u00a0Even in the low candlelight, Jon could see her cheeks grow red and he fought the urge to reach out and touch them. \u00a0Instead, he turned to the bench behind him, grabbing another glass to offer her refreshment.</p><p>Holding the glass between them, he asked her whether she wanted any wine or ale, \u201cwine please, with any luck it will help me grow tired, it usually does. \u00a0I should have had some at dinner and then maybe I would have fallen asleep hours ago\u201d. \u00a0Wondering why she was babbling again and putting it down to her lack of sleep (YN) asked Jon a question, in hopes it would stop her from talking so much drivel. \u201cRobb tells me that you\u2019re leaving for the Night\u2019s Watch soon, why?\u201d</p><p>Handing over the glass of wine, her fingers brushed the side of his as she took it from his hands and the warmth of the contact travelled throughout his whole body. \u00a0Trying to ignore the sensation he moved his hands away quickly and placed them under the table. \u00a0\u201cAye, I\u2019ve wanted to join for as long as I can remember, I\u2019ll be leaving the same day as father and my sisters\u201d. \u00a0Looking at her face he could tell she wasn\u2019t satisfied by the answer and was waiting for more, her (E/C) eyes looking at his with curiosity. \u201cThere is not very much I can really offer anyone here, at least at the Night\u2019s Watch I can do something useful\u201d. The curiosity in her eyes transformed to something else, was it empathy? Or maybe compassion? He wasn\u2019t sure, but he felt like she understood a lot more from his words than he intended.</p><p>Hearing his words made (YN) feel heavy-hearted, she didn\u2019t know him very well at all, but from what she gathered his family loved him very much. \u00a0Well, Lady Catelyn being the exception, (YN) could see she barely tolerated him and that her opinions had rubbed off on Sansa somewhat. \u00a0However, sitting across from him now, barely at an arm\u2019s length she could tell he was good and kind. \u00a0Surely he didn\u2019t believe there was no use or need for him here amongst his family. \u00a0Feeling as though she wanted to tell him he was wrong and knowing that she shouldn\u2019t (YN) instead replied, \u201cI\u2019m sure you will do very well for yourself at the Night\u2019s Watch, from what I\u2019ve seen in the training yard you\u2019re very good with a sword. And I\u2019m sure they are always happy to have a Stark amongst their ranks\u201d.</p><p>Her words felt very kind and genuine, stirring up strange feelings, but they were untrue, \u201cI\u2019m not a Stark though, I\u2019m a bastard\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t know how or why she almost looked offended by what he said, but she did. \u00a0Giving a little sigh (YN) took a breath, \u201cJon, you have just as much Stark blood running through your veins as your siblings, you are a Stark, it doesn\u2019t matter how you spell your last name. \u00a0Just as I am as much a Hardy, as I am a (YLN)\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Not knowing what to say, Jon just sat there, his eyes staring at the cup of ale in his hands. \u00a0After a long moment of silence (YN) continued and he lifted his gaze to meet hers. \u201cMy mother and I are the last of our line, my grandfather was the Chieftain for Clan Hardy, his father and grandfather\u2019s before him stretched back thousands of years to the first men\u201d. \u00a0Taking a moment before continuing, her face filled with conviction, \u201cHis line finished with the death of his sons, now Clan Hardy has a new line of chieftains, but that does not erase who I am. \u00a0And I will make sure any children I am blessed with, know who their ancestors are, regardless of whether they come from a great house, clan or otherwise\u201d. \u00a0Jon just sat there not knowing what to say, why did her words affect him like this? It was clear she held no prejudice towards bastards and for some reason it meant the world to him. \u00a0\u201cSorry Jon, normally I don\u2019t talk this much, it must be my lack of sleep\u201d.</p><p>Taking a sip from the cup of ale he still held, Jon shook his head, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to apologise, but can I ask you a question?\u201d (YN) only nodded her head in reply, wisps of hair falling into her beautiful face. \u00a0\u201cIs your brother not your mother\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>Spinning the sharp knife between her fingers she stopped to cut herself some more cheese, \u201cAngus was born a Snow like you, just after my father returned from King Robert\u2019s rebellion. Father didn\u2019t know of his existence until the mother died a few months later\u201d.\u00a0 As she looked out into the darkness of the kitchen Jon could see a fond smile appear on her lips, \u201cby the time Angus arrived at Mountainbreak, mother and father were already married and expecting me\u201d.</p><p>Jon now understood why (YN) spoke the way she did when he called himself a bastard, \u2018her brother was born one and she loved him anyway\u2019. \u00a0Nodding his head in understanding Jon gave a small smile and exhaled, \u201cand your father, when did he legitimize Lord Angus?\u201d</p><p>(YN) answered straight away without hesitation, \u201cbefore I was born, at my mother\u2019s insistence. \u00a0She loved him from the day he arrived, like he was her own\u201d. \u00a0Jon was surprised by what (YN) was telling him, it made for a very different story to his, \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter to her whether I had been born a boy or girl. Angus was fathers first born son, bastard or not.\u201d</p><p>Without Jon even speaking she knew what he was thinking, he was comparing Lady Catelyn to her mother and it upset (YN) to think he didn\u2019t have the same loving childhood as Angus. \u00a0\u201cYour mother sounds like a pretty amazing lady\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is\u201d picking up a piece of bread (YN) took a small bite as if to distract herself. \u00a0It was obvious to Jon she was thinking about her parents impending departure, not wanting to see her this way Jon changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cI know you and Robb haven\u2019t known each other very long, but I can tell he thinks the world of you\u201d. \u00a0There was the smile he wanted to see, it was only a small smile but somehow it reached her eyes which were now full of life. He was glad to see she had genuine feelings for his brother, even if it did break his heart a little. \u00a0\u201cHe is a good brother and a good man, I know he will be a good husband\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think he will and I hope I can make him a good wife\u201d. \u00a0Before Jon had a chance to reply (YN)\u2019s cheeks dimpled with a cheeky smile, \u201che tells me he has a surprise for me tomorrow, a chance for us to spend some time alone before we marry, do you know what he is planning? He refuses to tell me\u201d.</p><p>Jon laughed at her expression, it was pleading and hopeful and if he knew what Robb had planned he would have found it difficult to not tell her. \u00a0\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know\u201d, she tilted her head to the side and raised her eyebrows, as if she didn\u2019t believe him. \u00a0Putting his hands palms up in front of himself, he laughed again, \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t\u201d. \u00a0Seeming satisfied with his answer, she put her hand loosely over her mouth and gave the most unladylike yawn he had ever seen and he found it absolutely endearing.</p><p>Rubbing her eyes, (YN) stood, \u201cI think I\u2019m finally ready for bed, thank you for your company Jon, it was nice to finally get the chance to speak to you\u201d. \u00a0Standing up Jon wished he could escort her back to her chambers, but knew there were too many guards along the way. \u00a0It would not be good for her reputation if they thought she was running around at night with the bastard of Winterfell. \u00a0Instead, he bid her a simple goodnight as she excused herself from the kitchen, but she turned around before she even reached the door. \u00a0\u201cOh, I almost forgot, do you mind if I take some of the food, I promised Lord Clegane a plate. \u00a0I\u2019m sure a man that size must require constant sustenance\u201d.</p><p>Why was he not surprised by this thoughtful gesture, no one can even look at \u2018The Hound\u2019 and here she was offering him food. \u00a0Shaking his head fondly Jon gently pushed the plate across the table, \u201cof course, take it. Goodnight Lady (YN)\u201d. \u00a0Once she had left the kitchen he blew out the candles and made his way to his own chambers, knowing that this beautiful girl, whether he liked it or not, had found a permanent place in his heart.</p><p>It was a rather cold and frosty morning, the sun was nowhere in sight and thick, heavy clouds filled the sky, casting a dreary grey light across Winterfell. \u00a0Not that (YN) and Robb noticed, they were absorbed in their own little world filled with blue skies and wispy white clouds. \u00a0Walking hand in hand, (YN) looked up at Robb and for the third time asked, \u201cplease tell me where we are going\u201d.</p><p>Laughing at her impatience he looked at her and smiled, then standing still he spoke, \u201cI don\u2019t need to, we\u2019re here\u201d. \u00a0They were standing in front of the stables, when (YN) peered inside she saw two horses saddled and ready to go. \u00a0\u201cYou have spoken so fondly of going horse riding with your brother and I know I\u2019m not Lord Angus, but I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll do until you see him next.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The look on Robb\u2019s face was so anxious and sweet (YN) thought her heart would melt. \u00a0Turning to face him completely, she reached up on to her toes and placed the softest kiss on his cheek, feeling the soft stubble of his short beard under her lips. \u00a0\u201cOf course you will do, a ride sounds absolutely wonderful\u201d. \u00a0Holding her hand gently behind him, Robb pulled her through the stable door. \u00a0Letting go, (YN) moved towards the horses and stood between them, giving them both a pat on their necks. \u00a0\u201cWhich one will I be riding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhichever one you want, they are both good horses and easy to ride\u201d. \u00a0Robb watched her as she rubbed the snout of the chestnut mare and turning to Hodor with a joyful expression, she thanked him for preparing the horses. By the time Robb had made his way over to help her up, she was already sitting in the saddle and ready to go. \u00a0Quietly impressed he mounted his horse, \u201cWell, let\u2019s get going then\u201d. \u00a0Once they moved past Winter Town, they were able to ride more freely and Robb couldn\u2019t believe how well she rode and how graceful she looked doing it. \u00a0But it was the look on her face that had him mesmerized, looking so free and happy, without a worry in the world, he hoped he would see that same look every day from then on. \u00a0By evening tomorrow, he would be able to call this brilliant girl his wife and he just couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off his face thinking about it.</p><p>(YN) stopped a moment to tidy up her hair, all the riding had caused it to become a terrible mess, quietly she cursed herself for not being able to do her own braids, \u2018I should have gotten Tess to braid it for me this morning\u2019. \u00a0By this time Robb had pulled his horse to a stop beside her. \u00a0They had been riding for most of the morning and Robb was enjoying himself so much he almost forgot about the special lunch he had planned. \u00a0\u201cWe should probably head back now, for the next part of your surprise\u201d.</p><p>(YN) stopped trying to tie her hair up, it was a waste of time anyway and with a shocked look on her face she said, \u201cyou mean to tell me there\u2019s more\u201d.</p><p>Leaning over towards her with both hands still on the reigns, he gave her a quick kiss on her soft lips. \u00a0\u201cAye\u201d, was all he said, before his face washed over with a look of pure mischief. Racing off ahead of her, he turned his head around, \u201cI\u2019ll race you back to Winter Town\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Without hesitation (YN) set off after him laughing, \u201cRobb Stark, you cheat\u201d. \u00a0Leaning down over her horse\u2019s mane she whispered, \u201ccome on girl let\u2019s catch these boy\u2019s\u201d and off they went picking up speed and gaining ground. \u00a0Feeling her mare hold back a little, (YN) gave it another gentle squeeze with her legs and before she knew it, she was right on their tale, \u201cyou better not let me win Stark, I want to win this fair and square.\u201d</p><p>Robb was shocked at how quickly (YN) had caught up. \u00a0One second she was trailing behind him, the next she was in his ear warning him to not take it easy on her. \u00a0Soon she had started inching ahead, her long (H/C) hair trailing behind her. \u00a0Giving his horse a little kick, he tried to keep up but it was pointless, every time he picked up speed she almost doubled it. \u00a0Reaching the perimeters of Winter Town (YN) slowed down and Robb soon caught up, \u201cPlease remind me to never, ever challenge you to a race again my lady\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>A little out of breath she rubbed the length of the mare\u2019s neck, \u201cbeautiful girl\u201d she said before turning her attention to Robb, \u201cmaybe next time you should give me a slower horse\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>This was a side of (YN) he hadn\u2019t seen yet and he loved it. Normally she was always so quiet and humble and sweet and he absolutely adored her for it. \u00a0But right now with her hair windswept and falling down around her face and her cheeks flushed from riding, her eyes and words were filled with a playful smugness leaving him breathless. \u00a0Clearing his throat and looking a little sheepish Robb admitted, \u201cThat mare there, is the slowest of the two\u201d.</p><p>Biting her bottom lip and smiling at the same time she replied light-heartedly, \u201cthen maybe next time you should give me a donkey\u201d.</p><p>Robb couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her teasing words, loving that she seemed more relaxed, like she was really beginning to be herself around him and if he thought he was smitten before, he now knew for sure. \u00a0\u201cWell then, let\u2019s get these horses back to the stables, I think your mare has earnt a good rest\u201d.</p><p>(YN) looked up at Robb as he guided her through the Godswood, a peaceful and contented look on his face, \u201cThank you, Robb, for taking me riding, I had the most wonderful time\u201d.</p><p>Squeezing her hand gently, he let it go and replied, \u201cAnytime\u201d, he continued walking while he carefully removed a leaf from her hair, \u201ctell me how did you learn to ride like that?\u201d</p><p>All signs of her playful smugness gone, (YN) gave a small shrug of her shoulders, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess it\u2019s just because I love riding so much and I use to do it all the time.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Stopping in front of a large stone wall at the edge of the Godswood, Robb gestured towards an archway, \u201cFor the life of me, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t bring you here when I showed you around the other day\u201d. \u00a0When he looked at her, (YN) noticed how his cheeks blushed in the slightest way, \u201cthe Gods know how hard I tried to stretch out our time together\u201d.</p><p>Walking through the archway (YN) saw the most magnificent glass garden, so much more impressive than the one back at Mountainbreak. \u00a0It was enormous, with a high pitched roof and gables everywhere, looking as though there was a small forest inside. \u00a0As Robb opened the door for her, he soaked in the look of wonder on her features and lead her in with a hand on her lower back. Once inside (YN) felt her mouth drop open, up the back it was just like any other glass garden, growing various fruit and vegetables, but up the front it took on a whole new life. \u00a0Filled with beautiful exotic trees and colourful flowers everywhere, it was like nothing she had ever seen before. \u00a0Now realising where all the pretty flowers in her chambers came from, (YN) silently laughed at herself for not figuring it out sooner. Set in the middle of the garden was a large fur, upon it lay a basket overflowing with food and refreshment. Coming up behind her, Robb began to gently rub her upper arms and (YN) spun around to face him, \u201cWhen did you organise all this?</p><p>Taking one of her hands, he walked over to the fur and they sat down together, \u201cI planned it all out yesterday, well it was all my idea, but Sansa and one of the kitchen hands organised everything\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Feeling warm in the glass garden (YN) moved to take off her cloak, placing it behind her, \u201cWell it looks lovely and this is such a perfect setting, we have nothing like this back home\u201d. \u00a0Robb a little surprised, asked whether Mountainbreak had a glass garden to which she replied with a smile, \u201cOf course we have one, we couldn\u2019t survive without it. \u00a0We just don\u2019t grow any flowers or ornamental trees, all the space is used for growing food\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAye, that makes sense. \u00a0Actually, that\u2019s one of the reasons I wanted to bring you here\u201d, picking a perfectly formed snow white rose, he placed it in her hand. \u201cFather tells me this whole section of the garden will be gone soon, that we will need all the available space to grow food for the oncoming long winter\u201d.</p><p>Lifting the rose to her nose (YN) took in a deep breath, smiling at the sweet fragrance, nodding her head she spoke, \u201cYes father thinks there is a long winter coming, far longer than one I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Even with all the talk of winter, Robb felt hot, his cloak too heavy for the warmth of the glass garden. \u00a0Removing his cloak and putting it aside, he reached over and grabbed the basket, \u201cWell, let\u2019s enjoy the garden while we have it\u201d. \u00a0Sitting there, they ate, chatted and laughed, talking about many things, stories of their families, their childhood, their favourite foods and pastimes. \u00a0Both of them relishing in the chance to get to know one another. \u00a0Feeling more and more content in each other\u2019s company, (YN) lay there resting her head in Robb\u2019s lap. \u00a0Lifting his hand from her soft hair he traced over the line of her collarbone, the feel of her skin like silk under his fingertips. \u00a0After a long and comfortable moment of silence, Robb picked up and studied the pendants hanging from the chain around her neck, \u201cYou always wear this don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Sitting up (YN) turned to face him, now holding the pendants between her fingers. \u00a0One was a Snowy Owl, her father\u2019s sigil and the other her mother\u2019s, an Ironwood tree for Clan Hardy. \u00a0\u201cYes, my parents gave them to me on my last nameday, I like to always have them with me\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Leaning over to his cloak, Robb reached in and pulled out a small box, with a nervous bite of his bottom lip he placed it in her hands. \u00a0\u201cI was going to give this to you tomorrow after we marry, but I\u2019ve decided I cannot wait\u201d. \u00a0Looking down at the box, (YN) took a breath and looked back up at Robb who gave her a nod of encouragement, \u201cgo on, open it\u201d. \u00a0When she did, she was overcome, sitting inside was a small pendant of a Direwolf, not knowing what to say she looked at Robb again, emotion clear in her eyes. \u00a0\u201cI was hoping you might like to add it to your other pendants\u201d. \u00a0Placing a hand on the side of her face he leaned over, tenderly connecting his lips with hers. \u00a0It was their longest kiss yet and both of them felt its intensity soar, neither one wanting to stop. \u00a0Robb reluctantly pulled away, taking a deep breath to calm down his racing heart. \u00a0Biting his bottom lip again he looked at (YN), finding her gazing back with the shyest smile and rosy red cheeks, it made him want to reach out and kiss her again.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Robb, I love it, it\u2019s beautiful\u201d. \u00a0Holding the pendant between her fingers, she gave him a hug and laid back down to rest her head in his lap. \u00a0It really did mean the world to her, it made her feel like she belonged. \u00a0A symbol from Robb to show her she was part of his family. \u00a0And as he sat there running his fingers through her hair, she knew she would add it to her chain tomorrow and never take it off.</p><p>\u00a0<b>TAGS : <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muxxAdObOV7oiq-55ffCLWQ\">@tessimagines</a> @heyohheyitsgabi <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mv9SWQpRHeTbpskIckhot1Q\">@maiabiovillage</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOn4_RynNhEwwfPbfuqPKOw\">@majlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvyss4GQOII-MZ90CPN5PhA\">@givemeanorigami</a></b></p></p>",

Winterfell was buzzing in preparation for Lord Robb and Lady (YN)\u2019s wedding. It was only going to be a relatively small affair for the future Lord and Lady of the North, being at such short notice not many guests would get all the way to Winterfell in time. Still, the King and his family were there along with a few other houses that still remained from the King\u2019s feast and a small number of other houses were due to arrive before the big day. During those days (YN) wasn\u2019t expected to do anything and it was a strange feeling to her, with such a small household staff back home at Mountainbreak she was used to getting in and doing things. Lady Neasa was the first born child to the chieftain of mountain clan \u2018Hardy\u2019 and she knew the importance of a girl being able to look after herself. With all her family now gone from harsh winters or wildling and Ironborn raids, she knew too well how one can be left alone in the world and she made sure her daughter would not be left helpless, should the same happen to her. So growing up Lady (YN) was given all the lessons she needed to be a proper Lady, however, her parents also made sure she was given all the knowledge and skills she needed to look after herself if the need ever arose. So all this free time was something new to her, the most she had done in preparation for the wedding was to\u00a0try on her dress. Just two days ago her mother had presented her with the very same dress she had worn on her wedding day. (YN) remembered seeing it as a young girl and thinking it was the most beautiful thing she had seen and looking at it now was no different. \u201cMother are you sure you want me to wear it?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Lady Neasa\u2019s eyes began to water, \u201cOf course I do, I didn\u2019t bring it along for me, I\u2019m not planning on getting married again\u201d. Placing her hand over her daughter\u2019s she smiled, \u201cI knew when we left Mountainbreak that we would soon find you a good match. And look, here we are on the first stop of our trip and you\u2019re betrothed the very next day.\u201d Giving her mother a kiss on her cheek (YN) got up to try the dress on.</p><p>\u201cMother it\u2019s perfect\u201d, and it was. Soft snow coloured fabric with dark accents made to look like the markings of their snowy owl sigil. It had a high neck and fitted sleeves right down to the wrists. The waist tapered in before subtly fanning out to the ground. Over the top of the dress was a very warm but delicately fashioned shawl, made to look as though it was created from soft\u00a0pearlescent feathers. Standing there looking at her reflection, her mother came up behind her, \u201cYou look much more beautiful in it than I ever did\u201d, after drying her eyes Neasa tried distracting herself by adjusting the dress on (YN)\u2019s frame, \u201cThe waist will need to be brought in a bit and the hem taken up at the bottom slightly, Lady Sansa has offered to do any alterations, well she actually insisted on doing them\u201d.</p><p>As (YN) stood there listening to her mother, the reality of all the changes this wedding would bring, came flooding into her mind like the rain of a soaking wet day. Her life as she had always known it, was never going to be the same. It saddened her and excited her equally, never again would her parents just be there when she needed them, she would miss horse rides with her brother, helping in the Mountainbreak kitchens, there was so much she would miss about that place. But waiting in front of her in just a couple of days\u2019 time stood a whole new life, new people, new adventures and Robb. \u201cI really wish Angus could be here with us, I am going to miss you all so much\u201d.</p><p>Neasa tried to not let the tears fall again, \u201cyour brother really would have loved to be here, but he understands that Mountainbreak always needs its Lord at its hearth\u201d.</p><p>(YN) knew her mother was right, Mountainbreak was too isolated and unpredictable to run itself and this was the perfect opportunity for Angus to test the knowledge and skills he gained from father and mother. Tears began to gather at the corner of (YN)\u2019s eyes and as she wiped them away she was thankful to hear a knock at the door. Both herself and her mother were in desperate need of a distraction, before their tears really gathered momentum. Neasa opened the door and found Sansa standing there rather impatiently. All (YN) could hear were Sansa\u2019s excited words, \u201cLady Neasa, does she have the dress on yet?\u201d</p><p>Neasa opened the door fully, letting Sansa though and when she saw the dress she almost squealed. \u201cThat dress looks absolutely stunning on you Lady (YN). Robb is going to have a hard time remembering what to do when he sees you\u201d. Walking over to (YN) Sansa gave a closer inspection, taking note of the alterations she will need to make. \u201cLady Neasa this dress really is something special, did you make it yourself?\u201d</p><p>(YN) was glad Sansa was preoccupied with the dress because she felt rather flustered at her comment and didn\u2019t know what to do or say.\u00a0 Neasa laughed\u00a0loudly at Sansa\u2019s question. \u201cNo definitely not, needlework is in no way a talent of mine. My mother use to pull her hair out trying to teach me, I just didn\u2019t have the patience\u201d. Neasa walked over to her daughter and started fussing with her hair, probably to see what styles would suit the dress, \u201c(YN) is very good though, I had to get a lady in from the village to teach her.\u201d</p><p>Sansa stood up straight taking a step back to admire the dress again, \u201cI hope I will look this beautiful when I wed Prince Joffrey\u201d.</p><p>(YN) found it hard to think of this sweet and naive young girl marrying the Prince, she did not like the boy. He was rude and obnoxious to his family and their household and when she was around him there was a steady feeling of unease in the pit of her stomach. Sansa however, felt no such feelings and constantly talked about how wonderful and charming he was. For Sansa\u2019s sake (YN) prayed she was wrong about him, \u201cOf course you will be beautiful, just look at you, Prince Joffrey must consider himself very lucky.\u201d</p><p>Sansa seemed pleased with (YN)\u2019s reply smiling as she finished pinning up the dress, \u201cI think that should do it, it won\u2019t take me long to make the adjustments, I\u2019ll bring it back tomorrow for you to try it on again\u201d.</p><p>That night (YN) couldn\u2019t sleep, tossing and turning in her big cosy bed for what felt like hours, her brain just wouldn\u2019t shut down. Kicking off the furs she moved around her chambers trying to expel some energy. Being awake for so long now she was getting hungry again, silently cursing herself for not eating enough at dinner. Hearing her stomach talking, she looked over to the small table in the corner and found only fruit there. \u2018That\u2019s not going to help\u2019 she thought to herself, but she wasn\u2019t about to wake her chambermaid to go fetch her some food. Deciding she was too awake and too hungry to sleep, she looked down at herself in her nightgown and thought it best to quickly change, not knowing if there would be anyone still up. Making her way quietly out of her chambers she headed towards the kitchens. The hallways were very different this late at night, much more peaceful, the flickering glow of light from the torches hitting the stone walls was comforting. (YN) almost felt as if she was back home at Mountainbreak. Passing a few King\u2019s guards along the way, she greeted them silently with a nod of her head until she passed \u2018The Hound\u2019. Since her arrival at Winterfell, she had only seen him from a distance and she had to admit he was an imposing and intimidating figure. Looking at him now though, with only a short distance between them she could tell he was a gruff man, but there was goodness in his eyes. As she neared him she spoke while looking directly into them, \u201cGood evening Lord Clegane\u201d. Sandor was surprised by Lady (YN)\u2019s greeting, normally people rush past him without even a sideways glance. But here she was looking right at him with no hint of unease, carrying a friendly smile on her lips.</p><p>Sandor replied in his usual grumpy manner, \u201cIsn\u2019t it too late to be wanderin\u2019 round by yourself? You should be sleepin\u201d.</p><p>(YN) inwardly laughed at his surely tone, \u201cProbably, but my stomach has other ideas, it\u2019s not going to let me rest until I\u2019ve fed it, would you like me to bring you something back?\u201d</p><p>While considering her words, Sandor realised this girl was not like other Lady\u2019s, she was different, why didn\u2019t she shy away from him? Like everyone else. \u201cNah, I better wait til I\u2019m done here\", (YN) only nodded her head and continued on down the hall, when she heard him say, \u201cOn second thoughts maybe I\u2019ll have a chicken if there\u2019s any left\u201d.</p><p>Turning around she chuckled quietly and nodded her head again, \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do, Lord Clegane\u201d.</p><p>Knowing her way around Winterfell quite well now, she could see the kitchen doorway ahead of her, a soft glowing light coming from inside. Nearing the entrance (YN) saw a dark headed figure sitting by a large wooden table in the centre. When she realised it was Jon Snow her feet staggered slightly and she contemplated whether to head back to her chambers, for she really didn\u2019t know him very well. Having only being introduced to him by Robb that one time, he always seemed to keep his distance. It was too late now though Jon was already looking at her, his eyes wide. Saying the first thing that sprung to mind she felt as though she was babbling, \u201cI hope I\u2019m not disturbing you Lord Snow, but I feel so hungry that it\u2019s keeping me awake. I need to eat something now or I\u2019ll never sleep\u201d. It must have sounded amusing because he gave a soft warm laugh, making her exhale and smile.</p><p>As he heard footsteps reaching the doorway, Jon looked up wondering who it could possibly be at this time of night. \u00a0When his eyes landed on a small figure, he quietly sighed, \u2018of all the people it had to be her, Lady (YN)\u2019. \u00a0Finding her standing shyly in the doorway, he realised he was staring, but he couldn\u2019t find any words. \u00a0When she spoke, it made him laugh, putting her at ease as she made her way into the kitchen. \u00a0Coming into better view as the candle\u2019s bathed her in a soft yellow light, Jon noticed how she tried to tame her messy (H/C) hair and smooth out her crumpled dress. Even in her tousled state, Jon found her adorable and captivating, finally admitting to himself that he had never seen a more beautiful girl. \u00a0Jon stood as she walked in and sat down on the opposite side of the table, \u201cAre you having the same trouble Lord Snow?\u201d</p><p>Sitting back down Jon smiled, to his side was a large plate of bread, cheese and leftover roast meat which he had been picking at for the past hour. \u00a0Sliding it over to (YN), he gestured for her to help herself. \u00a0\u201cAye I am, you know you can just call me Jon, I\u2019m not a Lord\u201d. \u00a0There was no malice to his tone, he was simply pointing out the fact. \u00a0</p><p>Grabbing some bread and slicing some cheese she replied, \u201cI know, but I didn\u2019t want to seem impolite\u201d. Taking a bite, (YN) was grateful to finally have some food in her belly and the chance to speak to her soon to be \u2018brother by law\u2019. \u00a0Glancing back up at him, while taking another bite she noticed him staring off into the darkness as if in deep thought and she was right. \u00a0Jon was having a hard time deciding whether to leave or not, he knew he should, but he just couldn\u2019t do it. \u00a0In the end he decided to stay, telling himself that it wouldn\u2019t be right to leave a Lady alone at night in a strange castle.</p><p>Trying to think of something to say, he turned his head towards her and said the first thing that came to mind, \u201cYou\u2019re very good with the bow and arrow, easily the best I\u2019ve seen. Arya can\u2019t stop talking about you, you\u2019ve made quite an impression\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThank you Jon\u201d, was all (YN) could think to say, his compliment took her off guard and the embarrassment was clear on her face. \u00a0Even in the low candlelight, Jon could see her cheeks grow red and he fought the urge to reach out and touch them. \u00a0Instead, he turned to the bench behind him, grabbing another glass to offer her refreshment.</p><p>Holding the glass between them, he asked her whether she wanted any wine or ale, \u201cwine please, with any luck it will help me grow tired, it usually does. \u00a0I should have had some at dinner and then maybe I would have fallen asleep hours ago\u201d. \u00a0Wondering why she was babbling again and putting it down to her lack of sleep (YN) asked Jon a question, in hopes it would stop her from talking so much drivel. \u201cRobb tells me that you\u2019re leaving for the Night\u2019s Watch soon, why?\u201d</p><p>Handing over the glass of wine, her fingers brushed the side of his as she took it from his hands and the warmth of the contact travelled throughout his whole body. \u00a0Trying to ignore the sensation he moved his hands away quickly and placed them under the table. \u00a0\u201cAye, I\u2019ve wanted to join for as long as I can remember, I\u2019ll be leaving the same day as father and my sisters\u201d. \u00a0Looking at her face he could tell she wasn\u2019t satisfied by the answer and was waiting for more, her (E/C) eyes looking at his with curiosity. \u201cThere is not very much I can really offer anyone here, at least at the Night\u2019s Watch I can do something useful\u201d. The curiosity in her eyes transformed to something else, was it empathy? Or maybe compassion? He wasn\u2019t sure, but he felt like she understood a lot more from his words than he intended.</p><p>Hearing his words made (YN) feel heavy-hearted, she didn\u2019t know him very well at all, but from what she gathered his family loved him very much. \u00a0Well, Lady Catelyn being the exception, (YN) could see she barely tolerated him and that her opinions had rubbed off on Sansa somewhat. \u00a0However, sitting across from him now, barely at an arm\u2019s length she could tell he was good and kind. \u00a0Surely he didn\u2019t believe there was no use or need for him here amongst his family. \u00a0Feeling as though she wanted to tell him he was wrong and knowing that she shouldn\u2019t (YN) instead replied, \u201cI\u2019m sure you will do very well for yourself at the Night\u2019s Watch, from what I\u2019ve seen in the training yard you\u2019re very good with a sword. And I\u2019m sure they are always happy to have a Stark amongst their ranks\u201d.</p><p>Her words felt very kind and genuine, stirring up strange feelings, but they were untrue, \u201cI\u2019m not a Stark though, I\u2019m a bastard\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t know how or why she almost looked offended by what he said, but she did. \u00a0Giving a little sigh (YN) took a breath, \u201cJon, you have just as much Stark blood running through your veins as your siblings, you are a Stark, it doesn\u2019t matter how you spell your last name. \u00a0Just as I am as much a Hardy, as I am a (YLN)\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Not knowing what to say, Jon just sat there, his eyes staring at the cup of ale in his hands. \u00a0After a long moment of silence (YN) continued and he lifted his gaze to meet hers. \u201cMy mother and I are the last of our line, my grandfather was the Chieftain for Clan Hardy, his father and grandfather\u2019s before him stretched back thousands of years to the first men\u201d. \u00a0Taking a moment before continuing, her face filled with conviction, \u201cHis line finished with the death of his sons, now Clan Hardy has a new line of chieftains, but that does not erase who I am. \u00a0And I will make sure any children I am blessed with, know who their ancestors are, regardless of whether they come from a great house, clan or otherwise\u201d. \u00a0Jon just sat there not knowing what to say, why did her words affect him like this? It was clear she held no prejudice towards bastards and for some reason it meant the world to him. \u00a0\u201cSorry Jon, normally I don\u2019t talk this much, it must be my lack of sleep\u201d.</p><p>Taking a sip from the cup of ale he still held, Jon shook his head, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to apologise, but can I ask you a question?\u201d (YN) only nodded her head in reply, wisps of hair falling into her beautiful face. \u00a0\u201cIs your brother not your mother\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>Spinning the sharp knife between her fingers she stopped to cut herself some more cheese, \u201cAngus was born a Snow like you, just after my father returned from King Robert\u2019s rebellion. Father didn\u2019t know of his existence until the mother died a few months later\u201d.\u00a0 As she looked out into the darkness of the kitchen Jon could see a fond smile appear on her lips, \u201cby the time Angus arrived at Mountainbreak, mother and father were already married and expecting me\u201d.</p><p>Jon now understood why (YN) spoke the way she did when he called himself a bastard, \u2018her brother was born one and she loved him anyway\u2019. \u00a0Nodding his head in understanding Jon gave a small smile and exhaled, \u201cand your father, when did he legitimize Lord Angus?\u201d</p><p>(YN) answered straight away without hesitation, \u201cbefore I was born, at my mother\u2019s insistence. \u00a0She loved him from the day he arrived, like he was her own\u201d. \u00a0Jon was surprised by what (YN) was telling him, it made for a very different story to his, \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter to her whether I had been born a boy or girl. Angus was fathers first born son, bastard or not.\u201d</p><p>Without Jon even speaking she knew what he was thinking, he was comparing Lady Catelyn to her mother and it upset (YN) to think he didn\u2019t have the same loving childhood as Angus. \u00a0\u201cYour mother sounds like a pretty amazing lady\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is\u201d picking up a piece of bread (YN) took a small bite as if to distract herself. \u00a0It was obvious to Jon she was thinking about her parents impending departure, not wanting to see her this way Jon changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cI know you and Robb haven\u2019t known each other very long, but I can tell he thinks the world of you\u201d. \u00a0There was the smile he wanted to see, it was only a small smile but somehow it reached her eyes which were now full of life. He was glad to see she had genuine feelings for his brother, even if it did break his heart a little. \u00a0\u201cHe is a good brother and a good man, I know he will be a good husband\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think he will and I hope I can make him a good wife\u201d. \u00a0Before Jon had a chance to reply (YN)\u2019s cheeks dimpled with a cheeky smile, \u201che tells me he has a surprise for me tomorrow, a chance for us to spend some time alone before we marry, do you know what he is planning? He refuses to tell me\u201d.</p><p>Jon laughed at her expression, it was pleading and hopeful and if he knew what Robb had planned he would have found it difficult to not tell her. \u00a0\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know\u201d, she tilted her head to the side and raised her eyebrows, as if she didn\u2019t believe him. \u00a0Putting his hands palms up in front of himself, he laughed again, \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t\u201d. \u00a0Seeming satisfied with his answer, she put her hand loosely over her mouth and gave the most unladylike yawn he had ever seen and he found it absolutely endearing.</p><p>Rubbing her eyes, (YN) stood, \u201cI think I\u2019m finally ready for bed, thank you for your company Jon, it was nice to finally get the chance to speak to you\u201d. \u00a0Standing up Jon wished he could escort her back to her chambers, but knew there were too many guards along the way. \u00a0It would not be good for her reputation if they thought she was running around at night with the bastard of Winterfell. \u00a0Instead, he bid her a simple goodnight as she excused herself from the kitchen, but she turned around before she even reached the door. \u00a0\u201cOh, I almost forgot, do you mind if I take some of the food, I promised Lord Clegane a plate. \u00a0I\u2019m sure a man that size must require constant sustenance\u201d.</p><p>Why was he not surprised by this thoughtful gesture, no one can even look at \u2018The Hound\u2019 and here she was offering him food. \u00a0Shaking his head fondly Jon gently pushed the plate across the table, \u201cof course, take it. Goodnight Lady (YN)\u201d. \u00a0Once she had left the kitchen he blew out the candles and made his way to his own chambers, knowing that this beautiful girl, whether he liked it or not, had found a permanent place in his heart.</p><p>It was a rather cold and frosty morning, the sun was nowhere in sight and thick, heavy clouds filled the sky, casting a dreary grey light across Winterfell. \u00a0Not that (YN) and Robb noticed, they were absorbed in their own little world filled with blue skies and wispy white clouds. \u00a0Walking hand in hand, (YN) looked up at Robb and for the third time asked, \u201cplease tell me where we are going\u201d.</p><p>Laughing at her impatience he looked at her and smiled, then standing still he spoke, \u201cI don\u2019t need to, we\u2019re here\u201d. \u00a0They were standing in front of the stables, when (YN) peered inside she saw two horses saddled and ready to go. \u00a0\u201cYou have spoken so fondly of going horse riding with your brother and I know I\u2019m not Lord Angus, but I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll do until you see him next.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The look on Robb\u2019s face was so anxious and sweet (YN) thought her heart would melt. \u00a0Turning to face him completely, she reached up on to her toes and placed the softest kiss on his cheek, feeling the soft stubble of his short beard under her lips. \u00a0\u201cOf course you will do, a ride sounds absolutely wonderful\u201d. \u00a0Holding her hand gently behind him, Robb pulled her through the stable door. \u00a0Letting go, (YN) moved towards the horses and stood between them, giving them both a pat on their necks. \u00a0\u201cWhich one will I be riding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhichever one you want, they are both good horses and easy to ride\u201d. \u00a0Robb watched her as she rubbed the snout of the chestnut mare and turning to Hodor with a joyful expression, she thanked him for preparing the horses. By the time Robb had made his way over to help her up, she was already sitting in the saddle and ready to go. \u00a0Quietly impressed he mounted his horse, \u201cWell, let\u2019s get going then\u201d. \u00a0Once they moved past Winter Town, they were able to ride more freely and Robb couldn\u2019t believe how well she rode and how graceful she looked doing it. \u00a0But it was the look on her face that had him mesmerized, looking so free and happy, without a worry in the world, he hoped he would see that same look every day from then on. \u00a0By evening tomorrow, he would be able to call this brilliant girl his wife and he just couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off his face thinking about it.</p><p>(YN) stopped a moment to tidy up her hair, all the riding had caused it to become a terrible mess, quietly she cursed herself for not being able to do her own braids, \u2018I should have gotten Tess to braid it for me this morning\u2019. \u00a0By this time Robb had pulled his horse to a stop beside her. \u00a0They had been riding for most of the morning and Robb was enjoying himself so much he almost forgot about the special lunch he had planned. \u00a0\u201cWe should probably head back now, for the next part of your surprise\u201d.</p><p>(YN) stopped trying to tie her hair up, it was a waste of time anyway and with a shocked look on her face she said, \u201cyou mean to tell me there\u2019s more\u201d.</p><p>Leaning over towards her with both hands still on the reigns, he gave her a quick kiss on her soft lips. \u00a0\u201cAye\u201d, was all he said, before his face washed over with a look of pure mischief. Racing off ahead of her, he turned his head around, \u201cI\u2019ll race you back to Winter Town\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Without hesitation (YN) set off after him laughing, \u201cRobb Stark, you cheat\u201d. \u00a0Leaning down over her horse\u2019s mane she whispered, \u201ccome on girl let\u2019s catch these boy\u2019s\u201d and off they went picking up speed and gaining ground. \u00a0Feeling her mare hold back a little, (YN) gave it another gentle squeeze with her legs and before she knew it, she was right on their tale, \u201cyou better not let me win Stark, I want to win this fair and square.\u201d</p><p>Robb was shocked at how quickly (YN) had caught up. \u00a0One second she was trailing behind him, the next she was in his ear warning him to not take it easy on her. \u00a0Soon she had started inching ahead, her long (H/C) hair trailing behind her. \u00a0Giving his horse a little kick, he tried to keep up but it was pointless, every time he picked up speed she almost doubled it. \u00a0Reaching the perimeters of Winter Town (YN) slowed down and Robb soon caught up, \u201cPlease remind me to never, ever challenge you to a race again my lady\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>A little out of breath she rubbed the length of the mare\u2019s neck, \u201cbeautiful girl\u201d she said before turning her attention to Robb, \u201cmaybe next time you should give me a slower horse\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>This was a side of (YN) he hadn\u2019t seen yet and he loved it. Normally she was always so quiet and humble and sweet and he absolutely adored her for it. \u00a0But right now with her hair windswept and falling down around her face and her cheeks flushed from riding, her eyes and words were filled with a playful smugness leaving him breathless. \u00a0Clearing his throat and looking a little sheepish Robb admitted, \u201cThat mare there, is the slowest of the two\u201d.</p><p>Biting her bottom lip and smiling at the same time she replied light-heartedly, \u201cthen maybe next time you should give me a donkey\u201d.</p><p>Robb couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her teasing words, loving that she seemed more relaxed, like she was really beginning to be herself around him and if he thought he was smitten before, he now knew for sure. \u00a0\u201cWell then, let\u2019s get these horses back to the stables, I think your mare has earnt a good rest\u201d.</p><p>(YN) looked up at Robb as he guided her through the Godswood, a peaceful and contented look on his face, \u201cThank you, Robb, for taking me riding, I had the most wonderful time\u201d.</p><p>Squeezing her hand gently, he let it go and replied, \u201cAnytime\u201d, he continued walking while he carefully removed a leaf from her hair, \u201ctell me how did you learn to ride like that?\u201d</p><p>All signs of her playful smugness gone, (YN) gave a small shrug of her shoulders, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess it\u2019s just because I love riding so much and I use to do it all the time.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Stopping in front of a large stone wall at the edge of the Godswood, Robb gestured towards an archway, \u201cFor the life of me, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t bring you here when I showed you around the other day\u201d. \u00a0When he looked at her, (YN) noticed how his cheeks blushed in the slightest way, \u201cthe Gods know how hard I tried to stretch out our time together\u201d.</p><p>Walking through the archway (YN) saw the most magnificent glass garden, so much more impressive than the one back at Mountainbreak. \u00a0It was enormous, with a high pitched roof and gables everywhere, looking as though there was a small forest inside. \u00a0As Robb opened the door for her, he soaked in the look of wonder on her features and lead her in with a hand on her lower back. Once inside (YN) felt her mouth drop open, up the back it was just like any other glass garden, growing various fruit and vegetables, but up the front it took on a whole new life. \u00a0Filled with beautiful exotic trees and colourful flowers everywhere, it was like nothing she had ever seen before. \u00a0Now realising where all the pretty flowers in her chambers came from, (YN) silently laughed at herself for not figuring it out sooner. Set in the middle of the garden was a large fur, upon it lay a basket overflowing with food and refreshment. Coming up behind her, Robb began to gently rub her upper arms and (YN) spun around to face him, \u201cWhen did you organise all this?</p><p>Taking one of her hands, he walked over to the fur and they sat down together, \u201cI planned it all out yesterday, well it was all my idea, but Sansa and one of the kitchen hands organised everything\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Feeling warm in the glass garden (YN) moved to take off her cloak, placing it behind her, \u201cWell it looks lovely and this is such a perfect setting, we have nothing like this back home\u201d. \u00a0Robb a little surprised, asked whether Mountainbreak had a glass garden to which she replied with a smile, \u201cOf course we have one, we couldn\u2019t survive without it. \u00a0We just don\u2019t grow any flowers or ornamental trees, all the space is used for growing food\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAye, that makes sense. \u00a0Actually, that\u2019s one of the reasons I wanted to bring you here\u201d, picking a perfectly formed snow white rose, he placed it in her hand. \u201cFather tells me this whole section of the garden will be gone soon, that we will need all the available space to grow food for the oncoming long winter\u201d.</p><p>Lifting the rose to her nose (YN) took in a deep breath, smiling at the sweet fragrance, nodding her head she spoke, \u201cYes father thinks there is a long winter coming, far longer than one I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Even with all the talk of winter, Robb felt hot, his cloak too heavy for the warmth of the glass garden. \u00a0Removing his cloak and putting it aside, he reached over and grabbed the basket, \u201cWell, let\u2019s enjoy the garden while we have it\u201d. \u00a0Sitting there, they ate, chatted and laughed, talking about many things, stories of their families, their childhood, their favourite foods and pastimes. \u00a0Both of them relishing in the chance to get to know one another. \u00a0Feeling more and more content in each other\u2019s company, (YN) lay there resting her head in Robb\u2019s lap. \u00a0Lifting his hand from her soft hair he traced over the line of her collarbone, the feel of her skin like silk under his fingertips. \u00a0After a long and comfortable moment of silence, Robb picked up and studied the pendants hanging from the chain around her neck, \u201cYou always wear this don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Sitting up (YN) turned to face him, now holding the pendants between her fingers. \u00a0One was a Snowy Owl, her father\u2019s sigil and the other her mother\u2019s, an Ironwood tree for Clan Hardy. \u00a0\u201cYes, my parents gave them to me on my last nameday, I like to always have them with me\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>Leaning over to his cloak, Robb reached in and pulled out a small box, with a nervous bite of his bottom lip he placed it in her hands. \u00a0\u201cI was going to give this to you tomorrow after we marry, but I\u2019ve decided I cannot wait\u201d. \u00a0Looking down at the box, (YN) took a breath and looked back up at Robb who gave her a nod of encouragement, \u201cgo on, open it\u201d. \u00a0When she did, she was overcome, sitting inside was a small pendant of a Direwolf, not knowing what to say she looked at Robb again, emotion clear in her eyes. \u00a0\u201cI was hoping you might like to add it to your other pendants\u201d. \u00a0Placing a hand on the side of her face he leaned over, tenderly connecting his lips with hers. \u00a0It was their longest kiss yet and both of them felt its intensity soar, neither one wanting to stop. \u00a0Robb reluctantly pulled away, taking a deep breath to calm down his racing heart. \u00a0Biting his bottom lip again he looked at (YN), finding her gazing back with the shyest smile and rosy red cheeks, it made him want to reach out and kiss her again.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Robb, I love it, it\u2019s beautiful\u201d. \u00a0Holding the pendant between her fingers, she gave him a hug and laid back down to rest her head in his lap. \u00a0It really did mean the world to her, it made her feel like she belonged. \u00a0A symbol from Robb to show her she was part of his family. \u00a0And as he sat there running his fingers through her hair, she knew she would add it to her chain tomorrow and never take it off.</p><p>\u00a0<b>TAGS : <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muxxAdObOV7oiq-55ffCLWQ\">@tessimagines</a> @heyohheyitsgabi <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mv9SWQpRHeTbpskIckhot1Q\">@maiabiovillage</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOn4_RynNhEwwfPbfuqPKOw\">@majlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvyss4GQOII-MZ90CPN5PhA\">@givemeanorigami</a></b></p></p>",

Winterfell was buzzing in preparation for Lord Robb and Lady (YN)&rsquo;s wedding. It was only going to be a relatively small affair for the future Lord and Lady of the North, being at such short notice not many guests would get all the way to Winterfell in time. Still, the King and his family were there along with a few other houses that still remained from the King&rsquo;s feast and a small number of other houses were due to arrive before the big day. During those days (YN) wasn&rsquo;t expected to do anything and it was a strange feeling to her, with such a small household staff back home at Mountainbreak she was used to getting in and doing things. Lady Neasa was the first born child to the chieftain of mountain clan &lsquo;Hardy&rsquo; and she knew the importance of a girl being able to look after herself. With all her family now gone from harsh winters or wildling and Ironborn raids, she knew too well how one can be left alone in the world and she made sure her daughter would not be left helpless, should the same happen to her. So growing up Lady (YN) was given all the lessons she needed to be a proper Lady, however, her parents also made sure she was given all the knowledge and skills she needed to look after herself if the need ever arose. So all this free time was something new to her, the most she had done in preparation for the wedding was to&nbsp;try on her dress. Just two days ago her mother had presented her with the very same dress she had worn on her wedding day. (YN) remembered seeing it as a young girl and thinking it was the most beautiful thing she had seen and looking at it now was no different. &ldquo;Mother are you sure you want me to wear it?&rdquo;</p><p>Lady Neasa&rsquo;s eyes began to water, &ldquo;Of course I do, I didn&rsquo;t bring it along for me, I&rsquo;m not planning on getting married again&rdquo;. Placing her hand over her daughter&rsquo;s she smiled, &ldquo;I knew when we left Mountainbreak that we would soon find you a good match. And look, here we are on the first stop of our trip and you&rsquo;re betrothed the very next day.&rdquo; Giving her mother a kiss on her cheek (YN) got up to try the dress on.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother it&rsquo;s perfect&rdquo;, and it was. Soft snow coloured fabric with dark accents made to look like the markings of their snowy owl sigil. It had a high neck and fitted sleeves right down to the wrists. The waist tapered in before subtly fanning out to the ground. Over the top of the dress was a very warm but delicately fashioned shawl, made to look as though it was created from soft&nbsp;pearlescent feathers. Standing there looking at her reflection, her mother came up behind her, &ldquo;You look much more beautiful in it than I ever did&rdquo;, after drying her eyes Neasa tried distracting herself by adjusting the dress on (YN)&rsquo;s frame, &ldquo;The waist will need to be brought in a bit and the hem taken up at the bottom slightly, Lady Sansa has offered to do any alterations, well she actually insisted on doing them&rdquo;.</p><p>As (YN) stood there listening to her mother, the reality of all the changes this wedding would bring, came flooding into her mind like the rain of a soaking wet day. Her life as she had always known it, was never going to be the same. It saddened her and excited her equally, never again would her parents just be there when she needed them, she would miss horse rides with her brother, helping in the Mountainbreak kitchens, there was so much she would miss about that place. But waiting in front of her in just a couple of days&rsquo; time stood a whole new life, new people, new adventures and Robb. &ldquo;I really wish Angus could be here with us, I am going to miss you all so much&rdquo;.</p><p>Neasa tried to not let the tears fall again, &ldquo;your brother really would have loved to be here, but he understands that Mountainbreak always needs its Lord at its hearth&rdquo;.</p><p>(YN) knew her mother was right, Mountainbreak was too isolated and unpredictable to run itself and this was the perfect opportunity for Angus to test the knowledge and skills he gained from father and mother. Tears began to gather at the corner of (YN)&rsquo;s eyes and as she wiped them away she was thankful to hear a knock at the door. Both herself and her mother were in desperate need of a distraction, before their tears really gathered momentum. Neasa opened the door and found Sansa standing there rather impatiently. All (YN) could hear were Sansa&rsquo;s excited words, &ldquo;Lady Neasa, does she have the dress on yet?&rdquo;</p><p>Neasa opened the door fully, letting Sansa though and when she saw the dress she almost squealed. &ldquo;That dress looks absolutely stunning on you Lady (YN). Robb is going to have a hard time remembering what to do when he sees you&rdquo;. Walking over to (YN) Sansa gave a closer inspection, taking note of the alterations she will need to make. &ldquo;Lady Neasa this dress really is something special, did you make it yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>(YN) was glad Sansa was preoccupied with the dress because she felt rather flustered at her comment and didn&rsquo;t know what to do or say.&nbsp; Neasa laughed&nbsp;loudly at Sansa&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;No definitely not, needlework is in no way a talent of mine. My mother use to pull her hair out trying to teach me, I just didn&rsquo;t have the patience&rdquo;. Neasa walked over to her daughter and started fussing with her hair, probably to see what styles would suit the dress, &ldquo;(YN) is very good though, I had to get a lady in from the village to teach her.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa stood up straight taking a step back to admire the dress again, &ldquo;I hope I will look this beautiful when I wed Prince Joffrey&rdquo;.</p><p>(YN) found it hard to think of this sweet and naive young girl marrying the Prince, she did not like the boy. He was rude and obnoxious to his family and their household and when she was around him there was a steady feeling of unease in the pit of her stomach. Sansa however, felt no such feelings and constantly talked about how wonderful and charming he was. For Sansa&rsquo;s sake (YN) prayed she was wrong about him, &ldquo;Of course you will be beautiful, just look at you, Prince Joffrey must consider himself very lucky.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa seemed pleased with (YN)&rsquo;s reply smiling as she finished pinning up the dress, &ldquo;I think that should do it, it won&rsquo;t take me long to make the adjustments, I&rsquo;ll bring it back tomorrow for you to try it on again&rdquo;.</p><p>That night (YN) couldn&rsquo;t sleep, tossing and turning in her big cosy bed for what felt like hours, her brain just wouldn&rsquo;t shut down. Kicking off the furs she moved around her chambers trying to expel some energy. Being awake for so long now she was getting hungry again, silently cursing herself for not eating enough at dinner. Hearing her stomach talking, she looked over to the small table in the corner and found only fruit there. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not going to help&rsquo; she thought to herself, but she wasn&rsquo;t about to wake her chambermaid to go fetch her some food. Deciding she was too awake and too hungry to sleep, she looked down at herself in her nightgown and thought it best to quickly change, not knowing if there would be anyone still up. Making her way quietly out of her chambers she headed towards the kitchens. The hallways were very different this late at night, much more peaceful, the flickering glow of light from the torches hitting the stone walls was comforting. (YN) almost felt as if she was back home at Mountainbreak. Passing a few King&rsquo;s guards along the way, she greeted them silently with a nod of her head until she passed &lsquo;The Hound&rsquo;. Since her arrival at Winterfell, she had only seen him from a distance and she had to admit he was an imposing and intimidating figure. Looking at him now though, with only a short distance between them she could tell he was a gruff man, but there was goodness in his eyes. As she neared him she spoke while looking directly into them, &ldquo;Good evening Lord Clegane&rdquo;. Sandor was surprised by Lady (YN)&rsquo;s greeting, normally people rush past him without even a sideways glance. But here she was looking right at him with no hint of unease, carrying a friendly smile on her lips.</p><p>Sandor replied in his usual grumpy manner, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it too late to be wanderin&rsquo; round by yourself? You should be sleepin&rdquo;.</p><p>(YN) inwardly laughed at his surely tone, &ldquo;Probably, but my stomach has other ideas, it&rsquo;s not going to let me rest until I&rsquo;ve fed it, would you like me to bring you something back?&rdquo;</p><p>While considering her words, Sandor realised this girl was not like other Lady&rsquo;s, she was different, why didn&rsquo;t she shy away from him? Like everyone else. &ldquo;Nah, I better wait til I&rsquo;m done here\", (YN) only nodded her head and continued on down the hall, when she heard him say, &ldquo;On second thoughts maybe I&rsquo;ll have a chicken if there&rsquo;s any left&rdquo;.</p><p>Turning around she chuckled quietly and nodded her head again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do, Lord Clegane&rdquo;.</p><p>Knowing her way around Winterfell quite well now, she could see the kitchen doorway ahead of her, a soft glowing light coming from inside. Nearing the entrance (YN) saw a dark headed figure sitting by a large wooden table in the centre. When she realised it was Jon Snow her feet staggered slightly and she contemplated whether to head back to her chambers, for she really didn&rsquo;t know him very well. Having only being introduced to him by Robb that one time, he always seemed to keep his distance. It was too late now though Jon was already looking at her, his eyes wide. Saying the first thing that sprung to mind she felt as though she was babbling, &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m not disturbing you Lord Snow, but I feel so hungry that it&rsquo;s keeping me awake. I need to eat something now or I&rsquo;ll never sleep&rdquo;. It must have sounded amusing because he gave a soft warm laugh, making her exhale and smile.</p><p>As he heard footsteps reaching the doorway, Jon looked up wondering who it could possibly be at this time of night. &nbsp;When his eyes landed on a small figure, he quietly sighed, &lsquo;of all the people it had to be her, Lady (YN)&rsquo;. &nbsp;Finding her standing shyly in the doorway, he realised he was staring, but he couldn&rsquo;t find any words. &nbsp;When she spoke, it made him laugh, putting her at ease as she made her way into the kitchen. &nbsp;Coming into better view as the candle&rsquo;s bathed her in a soft yellow light, Jon noticed how she tried to tame her messy (H/C) hair and smooth out her crumpled dress. Even in her tousled state, Jon found her adorable and captivating, finally admitting to himself that he had never seen a more beautiful girl. &nbsp;Jon stood as she walked in and sat down on the opposite side of the table, &ldquo;Are you having the same trouble Lord Snow?&rdquo;</p><p>Sitting back down Jon smiled, to his side was a large plate of bread, cheese and leftover roast meat which he had been picking at for the past hour. &nbsp;Sliding it over to (YN), he gestured for her to help herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;Aye I am, you know you can just call me Jon, I&rsquo;m not a Lord&rdquo;. &nbsp;There was no malice to his tone, he was simply pointing out the fact. &nbsp;</p><p>Grabbing some bread and slicing some cheese she replied, &ldquo;I know, but I didn&rsquo;t want to seem impolite&rdquo;. Taking a bite, (YN) was grateful to finally have some food in her belly and the chance to speak to her soon to be &lsquo;brother by law&rsquo;. &nbsp;Glancing back up at him, while taking another bite she noticed him staring off into the darkness as if in deep thought and she was right. &nbsp;Jon was having a hard time deciding whether to leave or not, he knew he should, but he just couldn&rsquo;t do it. &nbsp;In the end he decided to stay, telling himself that it wouldn&rsquo;t be right to leave a Lady alone at night in a strange castle.</p><p>Trying to think of something to say, he turned his head towards her and said the first thing that came to mind, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very good with the bow and arrow, easily the best I&rsquo;ve seen. Arya can&rsquo;t stop talking about you, you&rsquo;ve made quite an impression&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Jon&rdquo;, was all (YN) could think to say, his compliment took her off guard and the embarrassment was clear on her face. &nbsp;Even in the low candlelight, Jon could see her cheeks grow red and he fought the urge to reach out and touch them. &nbsp;Instead, he turned to the bench behind him, grabbing another glass to offer her refreshment.</p><p>Holding the glass between them, he asked her whether she wanted any wine or ale, &ldquo;wine please, with any luck it will help me grow tired, it usually does. &nbsp;I should have had some at dinner and then maybe I would have fallen asleep hours ago&rdquo;. &nbsp;Wondering why she was babbling again and putting it down to her lack of sleep (YN) asked Jon a question, in hopes it would stop her from talking so much drivel. &ldquo;Robb tells me that you&rsquo;re leaving for the Night&rsquo;s Watch soon, why?&rdquo;</p><p>Handing over the glass of wine, her fingers brushed the side of his as she took it from his hands and the warmth of the contact travelled throughout his whole body. &nbsp;Trying to ignore the sensation he moved his hands away quickly and placed them under the table. &nbsp;&ldquo;Aye, I&rsquo;ve wanted to join for as long as I can remember, I&rsquo;ll be leaving the same day as father and my sisters&rdquo;. &nbsp;Looking at her face he could tell she wasn&rsquo;t satisfied by the answer and was waiting for more, her (E/C) eyes looking at his with curiosity. &ldquo;There is not very much I can really offer anyone here, at least at the Night&rsquo;s Watch I can do something useful&rdquo;. The curiosity in her eyes transformed to something else, was it empathy? Or maybe compassion? He wasn&rsquo;t sure, but he felt like she understood a lot more from his words than he intended.</p><p>Hearing his words made (YN) feel heavy-hearted, she didn&rsquo;t know him very well at all, but from what she gathered his family loved him very much. &nbsp;Well, Lady Catelyn being the exception, (YN) could see she barely tolerated him and that her opinions had rubbed off on Sansa somewhat. &nbsp;However, sitting across from him now, barely at an arm&rsquo;s length she could tell he was good and kind. &nbsp;Surely he didn&rsquo;t believe there was no use or need for him here amongst his family. &nbsp;Feeling as though she wanted to tell him he was wrong and knowing that she shouldn&rsquo;t (YN) instead replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you will do very well for yourself at the Night&rsquo;s Watch, from what I&rsquo;ve seen in the training yard you&rsquo;re very good with a sword. And I&rsquo;m sure they are always happy to have a Stark amongst their ranks&rdquo;.</p><p>Her words felt very kind and genuine, stirring up strange feelings, but they were untrue, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Stark though, I&rsquo;m a bastard&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p><p>Jon didn&rsquo;t know how or why she almost looked offended by what he said, but she did. &nbsp;Giving a little sigh (YN) took a breath, &ldquo;Jon, you have just as much Stark blood running through your veins as your siblings, you are a Stark, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how you spell your last name. &nbsp;Just as I am as much a Hardy, as I am a (YLN)&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p><p>Not knowing what to say, Jon just sat there, his eyes staring at the cup of ale in his hands. &nbsp;After a long moment of silence (YN) continued and he lifted his gaze to meet hers. &ldquo;My mother and I are the last of our line, my grandfather was the Chieftain for Clan Hardy, his father and grandfather&rsquo;s before him stretched back thousands of years to the first men&rdquo;. &nbsp;Taking a moment before continuing, her face filled with conviction, &ldquo;His line finished with the death of his sons, now Clan Hardy has a new line of chieftains, but that does not erase who I am. &nbsp;And I will make sure any children I am blessed with, know who their ancestors are, regardless of whether they come from a great house, clan or otherwise&rdquo;. &nbsp;Jon just sat there not knowing what to say, why did her words affect him like this? It was clear she held no prejudice towards bastards and for some reason it meant the world to him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry Jon, normally I don&rsquo;t talk this much, it must be my lack of sleep&rdquo;.</p><p>Taking a sip from the cup of ale he still held, Jon shook his head, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no need to apologise, but can I ask you a question?&rdquo; (YN) only nodded her head in reply, wisps of hair falling into her beautiful face. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is your brother not your mother&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;</p><p>Spinning the sharp knife between her fingers she stopped to cut herself some more cheese, &ldquo;Angus was born a Snow like you, just after my father returned from King Robert&rsquo;s rebellion. Father didn&rsquo;t know of his existence until the mother died a few months later&rdquo;.&nbsp; As she looked out into the darkness of the kitchen Jon could see a fond smile appear on her lips, &ldquo;by the time Angus arrived at Mountainbreak, mother and father were already married and expecting me&rdquo;.</p><p>Jon now understood why (YN) spoke the way she did when he called himself a bastard, &lsquo;her brother was born one and she loved him anyway&rsquo;. &nbsp;Nodding his head in understanding Jon gave a small smile and exhaled, &ldquo;and your father, when did he legitimize Lord Angus?&rdquo;</p><p>(YN) answered straight away without hesitation, &ldquo;before I was born, at my mother&rsquo;s insistence. &nbsp;She loved him from the day he arrived, like he was her own&rdquo;. &nbsp;Jon was surprised by what (YN) was telling him, it made for a very different story to his, &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t matter to her whether I had been born a boy or girl. Angus was fathers first born son, bastard or not.&rdquo;</p><p>Without Jon even speaking she knew what he was thinking, he was comparing Lady Catelyn to her mother and it upset (YN) to think he didn&rsquo;t have the same loving childhood as Angus. &nbsp;&ldquo;Your mother sounds like a pretty amazing lady&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, she is&rdquo; picking up a piece of bread (YN) took a small bite as if to distract herself. &nbsp;It was obvious to Jon she was thinking about her parents impending departure, not wanting to see her this way Jon changed the subject.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you and Robb haven&rsquo;t known each other very long, but I can tell he thinks the world of you&rdquo;. &nbsp;There was the smile he wanted to see, it was only a small smile but somehow it reached her eyes which were now full of life. He was glad to see she had genuine feelings for his brother, even if it did break his heart a little. &nbsp;&ldquo;He is a good brother and a good man, I know he will be a good husband&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I think he will and I hope I can make him a good wife&rdquo;. &nbsp;Before Jon had a chance to reply (YN)&rsquo;s cheeks dimpled with a cheeky smile, &ldquo;he tells me he has a surprise for me tomorrow, a chance for us to spend some time alone before we marry, do you know what he is planning? He refuses to tell me&rdquo;.</p><p>Jon laughed at her expression, it was pleading and hopeful and if he knew what Robb had planned he would have found it difficult to not tell her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry, I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;, she tilted her head to the side and raised her eyebrows, as if she didn&rsquo;t believe him. &nbsp;Putting his hands palms up in front of himself, he laughed again, &ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t&rdquo;. &nbsp;Seeming satisfied with his answer, she put her hand loosely over her mouth and gave the most unladylike yawn he had ever seen and he found it absolutely endearing.</p><p>Rubbing her eyes, (YN) stood, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m finally ready for bed, thank you for your company Jon, it was nice to finally get the chance to speak to you&rdquo;. &nbsp;Standing up Jon wished he could escort her back to her chambers, but knew there were too many guards along the way. &nbsp;It would not be good for her reputation if they thought she was running around at night with the bastard of Winterfell. &nbsp;Instead, he bid her a simple goodnight as she excused herself from the kitchen, but she turned around before she even reached the door. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, I almost forgot, do you mind if I take some of the food, I promised Lord Clegane a plate. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure a man that size must require constant sustenance&rdquo;.</p><p>Why was he not surprised by this thoughtful gesture, no one can even look at &lsquo;The Hound&rsquo; and here she was offering him food. &nbsp;Shaking his head fondly Jon gently pushed the plate across the table, &ldquo;of course, take it. Goodnight Lady (YN)&rdquo;. &nbsp;Once she had left the kitchen he blew out the candles and made his way to his own chambers, knowing that this beautiful girl, whether he liked it or not, had found a permanent place in his heart.</p><p>It was a rather cold and frosty morning, the sun was nowhere in sight and thick, heavy clouds filled the sky, casting a dreary grey light across Winterfell. &nbsp;Not that (YN) and Robb noticed, they were absorbed in their own little world filled with blue skies and wispy white clouds. &nbsp;Walking hand in hand, (YN) looked up at Robb and for the third time asked, &ldquo;please tell me where we are going&rdquo;.</p><p>Laughing at her impatience he looked at her and smiled, then standing still he spoke, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to, we&rsquo;re here&rdquo;. &nbsp;They were standing in front of the stables, when (YN) peered inside she saw two horses saddled and ready to go. &nbsp;&ldquo;You have spoken so fondly of going horse riding with your brother and I know I&rsquo;m not Lord Angus, but I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;ll do until you see him next.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>The look on Robb&rsquo;s face was so anxious and sweet (YN) thought her heart would melt. &nbsp;Turning to face him completely, she reached up on to her toes and placed the softest kiss on his cheek, feeling the soft stubble of his short beard under her lips. &nbsp;&ldquo;Of course you will do, a ride sounds absolutely wonderful&rdquo;. &nbsp;Holding her hand gently behind him, Robb pulled her through the stable door. &nbsp;Letting go, (YN) moved towards the horses and stood between them, giving them both a pat on their necks. &nbsp;&ldquo;Which one will I be riding?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whichever one you want, they are both good horses and easy to ride&rdquo;. &nbsp;Robb watched her as she rubbed the snout of the chestnut mare and turning to Hodor with a joyful expression, she thanked him for preparing the horses. By the time Robb had made his way over to help her up, she was already sitting in the saddle and ready to go. &nbsp;Quietly impressed he mounted his horse, &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get going then&rdquo;. &nbsp;Once they moved past Winter Town, they were able to ride more freely and Robb couldn&rsquo;t believe how well she rode and how graceful she looked doing it. &nbsp;But it was the look on her face that had him mesmerized, looking so free and happy, without a worry in the world, he hoped he would see that same look every day from then on. &nbsp;By evening tomorrow, he would be able to call this brilliant girl his wife and he just couldn&rsquo;t wipe the smile off his face thinking about it.</p><p>(YN) stopped a moment to tidy up her hair, all the riding had caused it to become a terrible mess, quietly she cursed herself for not being able to do her own braids, &lsquo;I should have gotten Tess to braid it for me this morning&rsquo;. &nbsp;By this time Robb had pulled his horse to a stop beside her. &nbsp;They had been riding for most of the morning and Robb was enjoying himself so much he almost forgot about the special lunch he had planned. &nbsp;&ldquo;We should probably head back now, for the next part of your surprise&rdquo;.</p><p>(YN) stopped trying to tie her hair up, it was a waste of time anyway and with a shocked look on her face she said, &ldquo;you mean to tell me there&rsquo;s more&rdquo;.</p><p>Leaning over towards her with both hands still on the reigns, he gave her a quick kiss on her soft lips. &nbsp;&ldquo;Aye&rdquo;, was all he said, before his face washed over with a look of pure mischief. Racing off ahead of her, he turned his head around, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll race you back to Winter Town&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p><p>Without hesitation (YN) set off after him laughing, &ldquo;Robb Stark, you cheat&rdquo;. &nbsp;Leaning down over her horse&rsquo;s mane she whispered, &ldquo;come on girl let&rsquo;s catch these boy&rsquo;s&rdquo; and off they went picking up speed and gaining ground. &nbsp;Feeling her mare hold back a little, (YN) gave it another gentle squeeze with her legs and before she knew it, she was right on their tale, &ldquo;you better not let me win Stark, I want to win this fair and square.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb was shocked at how quickly (YN) had caught up. &nbsp;One second she was trailing behind him, the next she was in his ear warning him to not take it easy on her. &nbsp;Soon she had started inching ahead, her long (H/C) hair trailing behind her. &nbsp;Giving his horse a little kick, he tried to keep up but it was pointless, every time he picked up speed she almost doubled it. &nbsp;Reaching the perimeters of Winter Town (YN) slowed down and Robb soon caught up, &ldquo;Please remind me to never, ever challenge you to a race again my lady&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p><p>A little out of breath she rubbed the length of the mare&rsquo;s neck, &ldquo;beautiful girl&rdquo; she said before turning her attention to Robb, &ldquo;maybe next time you should give me a slower horse&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p><p>This was a side of (YN) he hadn&rsquo;t seen yet and he loved it. Normally she was always so quiet and humble and sweet and he absolutely adored her for it. &nbsp;But right now with her hair windswept and falling down around her face and her cheeks flushed from riding, her eyes and words were filled with a playful smugness leaving him breathless. &nbsp;Clearing his throat and looking a little sheepish Robb admitted, &ldquo;That mare there, is the slowest of the two&rdquo;.</p><p>Biting her bottom lip and smiling at the same time she replied light-heartedly, &ldquo;then maybe next time you should give me a donkey&rdquo;.</p><p>Robb couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at her teasing words, loving that she seemed more relaxed, like she was really beginning to be herself around him and if he thought he was smitten before, he now knew for sure. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s get these horses back to the stables, I think your mare has earnt a good rest&rdquo;.</p><p>(YN) looked up at Robb as he guided her through the Godswood, a peaceful and contented look on his face, &ldquo;Thank you, Robb, for taking me riding, I had the most wonderful time&rdquo;.</p><p>Squeezing her hand gently, he let it go and replied, &ldquo;Anytime&rdquo;, he continued walking while he carefully removed a leaf from her hair, &ldquo;tell me how did you learn to ride like that?&rdquo;</p><p>All signs of her playful smugness gone, (YN) gave a small shrug of her shoulders, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I guess it&rsquo;s just because I love riding so much and I use to do it all the time.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Stopping in front of a large stone wall at the edge of the Godswood, Robb gestured towards an archway, &ldquo;For the life of me, I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t bring you here when I showed you around the other day&rdquo;. &nbsp;When he looked at her, (YN) noticed how his cheeks blushed in the slightest way, &ldquo;the Gods know how hard I tried to stretch out our time together&rdquo;.</p><p>Walking through the archway (YN) saw the most magnificent glass garden, so much more impressive than the one back at Mountainbreak. &nbsp;It was enormous, with a high pitched roof and gables everywhere, looking as though there was a small forest inside. &nbsp;As Robb opened the door for her, he soaked in the look of wonder on her features and lead her in with a hand on her lower back. Once inside (YN) felt her mouth drop open, up the back it was just like any other glass garden, growing various fruit and vegetables, but up the front it took on a whole new life. &nbsp;Filled with beautiful exotic trees and colourful flowers everywhere, it was like nothing she had ever seen before. &nbsp;Now realising where all the pretty flowers in her chambers came from, (YN) silently laughed at herself for not figuring it out sooner. Set in the middle of the garden was a large fur, upon it lay a basket overflowing with food and refreshment. Coming up behind her, Robb began to gently rub her upper arms and (YN) spun around to face him, &ldquo;When did you organise all this?</p><p>Taking one of her hands, he walked over to the fur and they sat down together, &ldquo;I planned it all out yesterday, well it was all my idea, but Sansa and one of the kitchen hands organised everything&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p><p>Feeling warm in the glass garden (YN) moved to take off her cloak, placing it behind her, &ldquo;Well it looks lovely and this is such a perfect setting, we have nothing like this back home&rdquo;. &nbsp;Robb a little surprised, asked whether Mountainbreak had a glass garden to which she replied with a smile, &ldquo;Of course we have one, we couldn&rsquo;t survive without it. &nbsp;We just don&rsquo;t grow any flowers or ornamental trees, all the space is used for growing food&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, that makes sense. &nbsp;Actually, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons I wanted to bring you here&rdquo;, picking a perfectly formed snow white rose, he placed it in her hand. &ldquo;Father tells me this whole section of the garden will be gone soon, that we will need all the available space to grow food for the oncoming long winter&rdquo;.</p><p>Lifting the rose to her nose (YN) took in a deep breath, smiling at the sweet fragrance, nodding her head she spoke, &ldquo;Yes father thinks there is a long winter coming, far longer than one I&rsquo;ve ever seen&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p><p>Even with all the talk of winter, Robb felt hot, his cloak too heavy for the warmth of the glass garden. &nbsp;Removing his cloak and putting it aside, he reached over and grabbed the basket, &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s enjoy the garden while we have it&rdquo;. &nbsp;Sitting there, they ate, chatted and laughed, talking about many things, stories of their families, their childhood, their favourite foods and pastimes. &nbsp;Both of them relishing in the chance to get to know one another. &nbsp;Feeling more and more content in each other&rsquo;s company, (YN) lay there resting her head in Robb&rsquo;s lap. &nbsp;Lifting his hand from her soft hair he traced over the line of her collarbone, the feel of her skin like silk under his fingertips. &nbsp;After a long and comfortable moment of silence, Robb picked up and studied the pendants hanging from the chain around her neck, &ldquo;You always wear this don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>Sitting up (YN) turned to face him, now holding the pendants between her fingers. &nbsp;One was a Snowy Owl, her father&rsquo;s sigil and the other her mother&rsquo;s, an Ironwood tree for Clan Hardy. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, my parents gave them to me on my last nameday, I like to always have them with me&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p><p>Leaning over to his cloak, Robb reached in and pulled out a small box, with a nervous bite of his bottom lip he placed it in her hands. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was going to give this to you tomorrow after we marry, but I&rsquo;ve decided I cannot wait&rdquo;. &nbsp;Looking down at the box, (YN) took a breath and looked back up at Robb who gave her a nod of encouragement, &ldquo;go on, open it&rdquo;. &nbsp;When she did, she was overcome, sitting inside was a small pendant of a Direwolf, not knowing what to say she looked at Robb again, emotion clear in her eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was hoping you might like to add it to your other pendants&rdquo;. &nbsp;Placing a hand on the side of her face he leaned over, tenderly connecting his lips with hers. &nbsp;It was their longest kiss yet and both of them felt its intensity soar, neither one wanting to stop. &nbsp;Robb reluctantly pulled away, taking a deep breath to calm down his racing heart. &nbsp;Biting his bottom lip again he looked at (YN), finding her gazing back with the shyest smile and rosy red cheeks, it made him want to reach out and kiss her again.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Robb, I love it, it&rsquo;s beautiful&rdquo;. &nbsp;Holding the pendant between her fingers, she gave him a hug and laid back down to rest her head in his lap. &nbsp;It really did mean the world to her, it made her feel like she belonged. &nbsp;A symbol from Robb to show her she was part of his family. &nbsp;And as he sat there running his fingers through her hair, she knew she would add it to her chain tomorrow and never take it off.</p><p>&nbsp;<b>TAGS : <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muxxAdObOV7oiq-55ffCLWQ\">@tessimagines</a> @heyohheyitsgabi <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mv9SWQpRHeTbpskIckhot1Q\">@maiabiovillage</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOn4_RynNhEwwfPbfuqPKOw\">@majlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvyss4GQOII-MZ90CPN5PhA\">@givemeanorigami</a></b></p></p>",

Winterfell was buzzing in preparation for Lord Robb and Lady (YN)&rsquo;s wedding. It was only going to be a relatively small affair for the future Lord and Lady of the North, being at such short notice not many guests would get all the way to Winterfell in time. Still, the King and his family were there along with a few other houses that still remained from the King&rsquo;s feast and a small number of other houses were due to arrive before the big day. During those days (YN) wasn&rsquo;t expected to do anything and it was a strange feeling to her, with such a small household staff back home at Mountainbreak she was used to getting in and doing things. Lady Neasa was the first born child to the chieftain of mountain clan &lsquo;Hardy&rsquo; and she knew the importance of a girl being able to look after herself. With all her family now gone from harsh winters or wildling and Ironborn raids, she knew too well how one can be left alone in the world and she made sure her daughter would not be left helpless, should the same happen to her. So growing up Lady (YN) was given all the lessons she needed to be a proper Lady, however, her parents also made sure she was given all the knowledge and skills she needed to look after herself if the need ever arose. So all this free time was something new to her, the most she had done in preparation for the wedding was to&nbsp;try on her dress. Just two days ago her mother had presented her with the very same dress she had worn on her wedding day. (YN) remembered seeing it as a young girl and thinking it was the most beautiful thing she had seen and looking at it now was no different. &ldquo;Mother are you sure you want me to wear it?&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
