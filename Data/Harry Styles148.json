He was standing on the ice, holding onto the barrier as he tried to coax the nurse to skate with him, at least once.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on duty,&rdquo; She said, rolling her eyes. The smile that was clear on her face, however, just egged him on to continue.</p><p>He let out a dramatic sigh, his teeth finding his lips as he thought about his next move.

What kind of doctor would I be?&rdquo; She asked him, the smile not leaving her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that a challenge?&rdquo; He asked, raising his right eyebrow as he stared the woman in front of him down.</p><p>&ldquo;Not, just a fact.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, you twat!&rdquo; They both turned to look at the female voice that called.

His face dropped, having too little time to respond as his sister dragged him away.</p><p>Harry did skate with his mum and the doctor couldn&rsquo;t help but watch them, which caused her to be teased by the one nurse and two trainees that accompanied her to the event. She flipped them all off before excusing herself to the bathroom, trudging away in her skates.</p><p>One her way returning she saw Harry, no longer skating with his mum, but rather a small girl.

The doctor was relieved.</p><p>&ldquo;How about you, Harry?&rdquo; The doctor asked, coming to a halt near him.</p><p>&ldquo;My arm hurts,&rdquo; He pouted.

His eyes screwed shut and she took it as a sign to hold still.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him, just check on the girl,&rdquo; She instructed the trainee- who only nodded before skating away.</p><p>&ldquo;I think my arm&rsquo;s broken,&rdquo; Harry said, slowly opening his eyes. The doctor couldn&rsquo;t help the quick breath intake at the sight of his eyes. They were absolutely beautiful, sparkling bright green eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, let&rsquo;s go treat you then,&rdquo; The doctor smiled moving to his right side and slinging his arm around her neck.</p><p>She assisted him to the nursing station before sitting him down in one of the chairs. She carefully took off his coat, then unbuttoned his right sleeve. She tried to move his wrist, which made him wince.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; She said- a blush on her cheeks at the warmness of his hand.</p><p>She decided to unbutton his shirt, which caused him to blush when her fingertips brushed against his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;A moth?&rdquo; She asked confused, referring to the big tattoo on his stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;A butterfly,&rdquo; He corrected, &ldquo;Supposed to represent what you do to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a flirt,&rdquo; She told him, pushing the shirt over his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Says the woman who&rsquo;s undressing me,&rdquo; He said, smiling cheekily at her.

He was standing on the ice, holding onto the barrier as he tried to coax the nurse to skate with him, at least once.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on duty,\u201d She said, rolling her eyes. The smile that was clear on her face, however, just egged him on to continue.</p><p>He let out a dramatic sigh, his teeth finding his lips as he thought about his next move. She wasn\u2019t even looking at him, her eyes were looking at the rink- waiting for any possible injuries. </p><p>\u201cNot even as a Christmas present? I mean it is Christmas,\u201d He tried again.</p><p>\u201cWhat if someone gets hurt while I\u2019m skating circles around you? What kind of doctor would I be?\u201d She asked him, the smile not leaving her lips.</p><p>\u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d He asked, raising his right eyebrow as he stared the woman in front of him down.</p><p>\u201cNot, just a fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, you twat!\u201d They both turned to look at the female voice that called. The doctor laughed as the splitting image of Harry came skating towards them- the doctor presumed that the woman was Harry\u2019s sister. \u201cYou promised to skate with mum, it\u2019s been nearly two hours and you didn\u2019t yet!\u201d She scolded, the man\u2019s cheeks heated up, colouring a rosy colour.</p><p>He turned back to the woman, smirking and- purposely- popping his dimple out. \u201cWhen does your shift end?\u201d he asked her, to which she just shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhen the rink closes,\u201d She shrugged. His face dropped, having too little time to respond as his sister dragged him away.</p><p>Harry did skate with his mum and the doctor couldn\u2019t help but watch them, which caused her to be teased by the one nurse and two trainees that accompanied her to the event. She flipped them all off before excusing herself to the bathroom, trudging away in her skates.</p><p>One her way returning she saw Harry, no longer skating with his mum, but rather a small girl. He was holding her hand and when she wanted to skate on her own, he\u2019d do all sorts of tricks. Prancing around the rink until she asked for his helping hand once more.</p><p>By the time she got back to the nursing station, he was picking her up and twirling her around as he spinned in a circle. He put her down, only to be asked to be picked up again. The doctor stood by the barrier\u2019s gate, preparing for anything to go wrong because this couldn\u2019t possibly go right.</p><p>And she was right, while Harry was spinning the girl, a boy accidentally skated into his front- sending him flying backwards.</p><p>Luckily, he gripped the girl to his chest and the boy had moved away from him just in time to not be hurt.</p><p>The doctor quickly skated towards the man, dodging the other skaters as effectively as possible.</p><p>As she got closer she heard Harry asking the girl if she was okay, to which she replied that she was uninjured. The doctor was relieved.</p><p>\u201cHow about you, Harry?\u201d The doctor asked, coming to a halt near him.</p><p>\u201cMy arm hurts,\u201d He pouted. The doctor nodded before helping the little girl off of his chest. Harry\u2019s sister had come to the scene and took the girl from the doctor.</p><p>One of the trainees had come to help, the doctor warned about the arm before they both pulled Harry to his feet.</p><p>The doctor gripped him tightly as he was bound to have some blood rushing to his head. His eyes screwed shut and she took it as a sign to hold still.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him, just check on the girl,\u201d She instructed the trainee- who only nodded before skating away.</p><p>\u201cI think my arm\u2019s broken,\u201d Harry said, slowly opening his eyes. The doctor couldn\u2019t help the quick breath intake at the sight of his eyes. They were absolutely beautiful, sparkling bright green eyes.</p><p>\u201cRight, let\u2019s go treat you then,\u201d The doctor smiled moving to his right side and slinging his arm around her neck.</p><p>She assisted him to the nursing station before sitting him down in one of the chairs. She carefully took off his coat, then unbuttoned his right sleeve. She tried to move his wrist, which made him wince.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d She said- a blush on her cheeks at the warmness of his hand.</p><p>She decided to unbutton his shirt, which caused him to blush when her fingertips brushed against his skin.</p><p>\u201cA moth?\u201d She asked confused, referring to the big tattoo on his stomach.</p><p>\u201cA butterfly,\u201d He corrected, \u201cSupposed to represent what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a flirt,\u201d She told him, pushing the shirt over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSays the woman who\u2019s undressing me,\u201d He said, smiling cheekily at her. She stopped her actions, looking at him before rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI need to remove your sleeve, and this looks expensive so I don\u2019t really want to cut it, so I\u2019m sorry if I hurt you,\u201d She explained, to which he only nodded- preparing to assist her a little.</p><p>They both successfully removed his arm, only having a few winces of pain. She did the necessary injury assessing before she put his arm in a cast. All while talking to the ridiculously handsome man.</p><p>She giggled at the joke he made as she finished buttoning his shirt back.</p><p>\u201cThe agency is going to be pissed,\u201d Harry sighed, not moving from the chair.</p><p>\u201cThe agency?\u201d The doctor asked, packing everything she used away.</p><p>\u201cYeah- I\u2019m in a band,\u201d He said, she could see the narcissistic glint in his eyes- he was probably really proud of it.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah- maybe you\u2019d like to come to the studio sometime?\u201d He asked, cheeks glowing again.</p><p>\u201cNormally I\u2019d say no, but I think I\u2019ll make an exception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d His eyes and smile widened.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why not? You obviously need someone to keep you upright- don\u2019t you prancer?\u201d She asked, joking with him.</p><p>\u201cPrancer,\u201d He snorted, seeing his mum and sister walking towards him.</p></p>",
