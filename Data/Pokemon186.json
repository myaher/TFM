She watched as he crouched down to\neye level with Igneel, directing him and telling him where to stand and\nprobably giving them some idea of a strategy.

She shook\nher head, let\u2019s just hope this works in their favor she thought to herself as\nput her chin in her cupped hands ignoring her first thought. </p><p>Wendell took out a small Pokeball\nfrom his pocket, pressed the white button so it would grow into the palm of his\nhand, </p><p>\u201cAlright, now it\u2019s time for the fun\nto begin,\u201d his grin reached the corners of his face as tossed the Pokeball into\nthe air. </p><p>\u201cGo Weedle! <a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>From the Pokeball came out a\nreddish-brown and yellow larva. Weedle was tinier than Igneel with beady black\ndots for eyes, a big red and pinkish nose and large spike on the top of its\nhead and a small one on the end of it like a tail. It made a noise like an\nangry groan as it came out of its Pokeball its beady black eyes narrowed and\nlooked like it was to poke its opponent with its head spike.</p><p>Alex smirked and almost burst out\nlaughing at Wendell\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon. This was going to be his opponent against his\nCharmander. This was going to be an easy first match. \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d\nBethany asked from the edge of the clearing, smiling and hoping her charm would\nget him to say yes let\u2019s leave now.</p><p>But Alex wasn\u2019t listening anymore.\nThe thrill of his first battle was the only thing on his mind now. He ignored\nher words, \u201cGo, Igneel!\u201d </p><p>The small golden lizard looked up\ntowards his trainer, realized he needed to get into the position they had\npracticed and ran over to the spot. Igneel roared as menacingly as he could. </p><p>\u201cGo ahead and start whenever you\u2019re\nready,\u201d Wendell said his arms open and a large creepy grin across his face, his\neyes also intensely looking at the battle.</p><p>Alex inhaled, he had this. He had\nthe type advantage. Plus, a Charmander\u2019s stats were much higher than a small\nlittle bug. Wendell had no chance of beating him. He shivered, the thrill of\nthis battle felt so different from simulations, he couldn\u2019t wait to get\nstarted.</p><p>He pointed his finger towards the\nWeedle, \u201cIgneel use scratch!\u201d </p><p>After briefly looking at his\ntrainer, the Charmander turned back towards the battle and rushed forward\ntowards the Weedle. Igneel opened its hands and his three fingered claws\nextended and glowed white. When he reached Weedle he slashed, but the Weedle\nhad jumped back to avoid it. All part of the plan, Alex thought.</p><p>Remembering what Bethany said about\nreal life battles not being like a Battle Simulator and not having to wait turn\nfor turn, </p><p>\u201cNow use ember!\u201d he yelled </p><p>Igneel switched and flicked its\ntail forward and small embers shot out and hit the larva. It hissed in pain,\nsmall burns over some parts of its body but it still stood, its eyes narrowed\nand glaring at Igneel. </p><p>\u201cIgneel again, use scratch!\u201d</p><p>As the Charmander rushed forward\nWendell issued his first attack, \u201cWeedle, string shot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIgneel, dodge!\u201d </p><p>Also remembering Bethany telling\nhim that you can dodge attacks even if in the simulation the moves have 100% accuracy,\nIgneel jumped sideways to avoid the oncoming attack, but Weedle turned its head\nin the opposite direction making Alex confused. Instead of launching an attack\nat Igneel, the small larva had shot it\u2019s a blast of web towards one the trees\naround the clearing. Suddenly the Weedle sucked in and was propelled towards\nthe tree and disappeared from Alex and Igneel\u2019s line of sight. Not good he\nthought to himself.</p><p>Alex and Igneel started looking\naround. Where did the Weedle go? </p><p>\u201cIgneel, stay sharp,\u201d he told him\nas the Pok\u00e9mon extended its white claws out. </p><p>Igneel started watching the tree\nline, Alex could tell the small golden lizard was scared and confused as well.</p><p>Wendell smirked as though he had\nalready won, \u201cWeedle, string shot.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly from the opposite side of\nwhere the Weedle had flown to, a line of web stuck itself to Igneel\u2019s hand and\nwent taut. Igneel tried to pull but it couldn\u2019t pull his hand out free. </p><p>\u201cAgain quickly!\u201d Wendell shouted. </p><p>Another web shot out, this time in\nthe direction they had seen the Weedle had disappeared from. It grabbed the\nsmall golden lizard\u2019s other hand before he could cut himself free with the free\nhand. Before Alex could issue any commands the Weedle had begun its work, it\ncontinually shot webs from every direction, moving so fast through the tree\nlines until eventually, the small golden lizard was the center of a giant web\nand was trapped inside. He pulled and tried to burn the webs with its tail, but\nthey were too thick. </p><p>Wendell grinned, and his left eye\nstarted to twitch, \u201cNow the fun begins! Weedle use Poison Sting!\u201d</p><p>Now, instead of web, small purple\nstingers started coming out the trees and pelting Igneel. The Charmander roared\nin pain as they stuck into his body, his face now flush with purple.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s poisoned,\u201d Alex said aloud.</p><p>Wendell\u2019s smile grew larger and he\nbegan to laugh, \u201cYES! Weedle, keep using Poison Sting!\u201d </p><p>More and more purple needles pelted\nIgneel in all different directions, and Alex couldn\u2019t tell where the Weedle\never was. The small lizard cried out in pain. Not only is he dealing with the\ndamage from the Weedle, Alex thought, he is also dealing poison damage, this is\nbad. Really bad. Alex began to panic, what was he going to do?</p><p>Meanwhile as the battle continued,\nBethany was getting worried. Clearly the battle was over, Igneel had clearly\nlost and was starting pass out but Wendell didn\u2019t look like he was going to\nstop. Why? She then remembered something she read on the school reports when\nshe got here earlier. Oh no. \u201cThis is getting out of hand, I need to do\nsomething,\u201d she whispered to herself. She quietly left the clearing, so nobody would\nhear her leave. </p><p>Alex was starting to get worried\nnow. Igneel was screaming in pain and the poison seemed to be taking its toll. </p><p>Fear was rising inside Alex but he\nwas able to say what needed to be said, \u201cOkay Wendell, I surrender, you win.\u201d </p><p>Wendell had been looking down since\nhe yelled for Weedle to keep attacking as if he was listening to the sound of\nthe battle rather than needing to see, but suddenly his arms dropped, and he\nlooked up at Alex, his pupils fully dilated, one eye twitching and his grin\nwide, </p><p>\u201cBut we aren\u2019t done yet. Not yet.\nWeedle!\u201d</p><p>Before Alex could even react,\nsomething whooshed through the trees behind him and impaled his Charmander.\nAlex\u2019s eyes widened and he realized it was Weedle and it had impaled Igneel\nwith the large spike coming from its head. Charmander choked from screaming, red\nblood coming out of the lizard\u2019s mouth and oozing down its back from where\nWeedle had stabbed it. The small larva took its tail spike and jammed it down\non Igneel\u2019s tail. Alex watched in horror as the flame on Igneel\u2019s tail started\nto flicker and start to fade. That was it.</p><p>\u201cI said that\u2019s enough Wendell!\u201d and\nbefore he could wait for a reply he started to rush forward to rip Weedle off\nhis Pok\u00e9mon. </p><p>However, before he could do that he\ncrashed into an invisible wall.

It hissed in pain,\nsmall burns over some parts of its body but it still stood, its eyes narrowed\nand glaring at Igneel. </p><p>\u201cIgneel again, use scratch!\u201d</p><p>As the Charmander rushed forward\nWendell issued his first attack, \u201cWeedle, string shot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIgneel, dodge!\u201d </p><p>Also remembering Bethany telling\nhim that you can dodge attacks even if in the simulation the moves have 100% accuracy,\nIgneel jumped sideways to avoid the oncoming attack, but Weedle turned its head\nin the opposite direction making Alex confused. Instead of launching an attack\nat Igneel, the small larva had shot it\u2019s a blast of web towards one the trees\naround the clearing. Suddenly the Weedle sucked in and was propelled towards\nthe tree and disappeared from Alex and Igneel\u2019s line of sight. Not good he\nthought to himself.</p><p>Alex and Igneel started looking\naround. Where did the Weedle go? </p><p>\u201cIgneel, stay sharp,\u201d he told him\nas the Pok\u00e9mon extended its white claws out. </p><p>Igneel started watching the tree\nline, Alex could tell the small golden lizard was scared and confused as well.</p><p>Wendell smirked as though he had\nalready won, \u201cWeedle, string shot.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly from the opposite side of\nwhere the Weedle had flown to, a line of web stuck itself to Igneel\u2019s hand and\nwent taut. Igneel tried to pull but it couldn\u2019t pull his hand out free. </p><p>\u201cAgain quickly!\u201d Wendell shouted. </p><p>Another web shot out, this time in\nthe direction they had seen the Weedle had disappeared from. It grabbed the\nsmall golden lizard\u2019s other hand before he could cut himself free with the free\nhand. Before Alex could issue any commands the Weedle had begun its work, it\ncontinually shot webs from every direction, moving so fast through the tree\nlines until eventually, the small golden lizard was the center of a giant web\nand was trapped inside. He pulled and tried to burn the webs with its tail, but\nthey were too thick. </p><p>Wendell grinned, and his left eye\nstarted to twitch, \u201cNow the fun begins! Weedle use Poison Sting!\u201d</p><p>Now, instead of web, small purple\nstingers started coming out the trees and pelting Igneel. The Charmander roared\nin pain as they stuck into his body, his face now flush with purple.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s poisoned,\u201d Alex said aloud.</p><p>Wendell\u2019s smile grew larger and he\nbegan to laugh, \u201cYES! Weedle, keep using Poison Sting!\u201d </p><p>More and more purple needles pelted\nIgneel in all different directions, and Alex couldn\u2019t tell where the Weedle\never was. The small lizard cried out in pain. Not only is he dealing with the\ndamage from the Weedle, Alex thought, he is also dealing poison damage, this is\nbad. Really bad. Alex began to panic, what was he going to do?</p><p>Meanwhile as the battle continued,\nBethany was getting worried. Clearly the battle was over, Igneel had clearly\nlost and was starting pass out but Wendell didn\u2019t look like he was going to\nstop. Why? She then remembered something she read on the school reports when\nshe got here earlier. Oh no. \u201cThis is getting out of hand, I need to do\nsomething,\u201d she whispered to herself. She quietly left the clearing, so nobody would\nhear her leave. </p><p>Alex was starting to get worried\nnow. Igneel was screaming in pain and the poison seemed to be taking its toll. </p><p>Fear was rising inside Alex but he\nwas able to say what needed to be said, \u201cOkay Wendell, I surrender, you win.\u201d </p><p>Wendell had been looking down since\nhe yelled for Weedle to keep attacking as if he was listening to the sound of\nthe battle rather than needing to see, but suddenly his arms dropped, and he\nlooked up at Alex, his pupils fully dilated, one eye twitching and his grin\nwide, </p><p>\u201cBut we aren\u2019t done yet. Not yet.\nWeedle!\u201d</p><p>Before Alex could even react,\nsomething whooshed through the trees behind him and impaled his Charmander.\nAlex\u2019s eyes widened and he realized it was Weedle and it had impaled Igneel\nwith the large spike coming from its head. Charmander choked from screaming, red\nblood coming out of the lizard\u2019s mouth and oozing down its back from where\nWeedle had stabbed it. The small larva took its tail spike and jammed it down\non Igneel\u2019s tail. Alex watched in horror as the flame on Igneel\u2019s tail started\nto flicker and start to fade. That was it.</p><p>\u201cI said that\u2019s enough Wendell!\u201d and\nbefore he could wait for a reply he started to rush forward to rip Weedle off\nhis Pok\u00e9mon. </p><p>However, before he could do that he\ncrashed into an invisible wall. A wall? \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\nWeedle, the Hairy Bug Pok\u00e9mon. Weedle is a Bug/Poison type Pok\u00e9mon. Often found\nin forests and grasslands.

                "content": "<p>Bethany sat on the side of the\nclearing as the two moved far enough apart to start their battle. For once\nsince they started this walk, Bethany noticed that the small golden lizard\nwasn&rsquo;t wandering around and not listening to Alex, but instead actually\nlistening and getting ready for the battle. She watched as he crouched down to\neye level with Igneel, directing him and telling him where to stand and\nprobably giving them some idea of a strategy. She smiled, they were kind of\ncute together. Wait, she thought to herself, did I just think that? She shook\nher head, let&rsquo;s just hope this works in their favor she thought to herself as\nput her chin in her cupped hands ignoring her first thought. </p><p>Wendell took out a small Pokeball\nfrom his pocket, pressed the white button so it would grow into the palm of his\nhand, </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, now it&rsquo;s time for the fun\nto begin,&rdquo; his grin reached the corners of his face as tossed the Pokeball into\nthe air. </p><p>&ldquo;Go Weedle! <a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>From the Pokeball came out a\nreddish-brown and yellow larva. Weedle was tinier than Igneel with beady black\ndots for eyes, a big red and pinkish nose and large spike on the top of its\nhead and a small one on the end of it like a tail. It made a noise like an\nangry groan as it came out of its Pokeball its beady black eyes narrowed and\nlooked like it was to poke its opponent with its head spike.</p><p>Alex smirked and almost burst out\nlaughing at Wendell&rsquo;s Pok&eacute;mon. This was going to be his opponent against his\nCharmander. This was going to be an easy first match. &nbsp; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want to do this?&rdquo;\nBethany asked from the edge of the clearing, smiling and hoping her charm would\nget him to say yes let&rsquo;s leave now.</p><p>But Alex wasn&rsquo;t listening anymore.\nThe thrill of his first battle was the only thing on his mind now. He ignored\nher words, &ldquo;Go, Igneel!&rdquo; </p><p>The small golden lizard looked up\ntowards his trainer, realized he needed to get into the position they had\npracticed and ran over to the spot. Igneel roared as menacingly as he could. </p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead and start whenever you&rsquo;re\nready,&rdquo; Wendell said his arms open and a large creepy grin across his face, his\neyes also intensely looking at the battle.</p><p>Alex inhaled, he had this. He had\nthe type advantage. Plus, a Charmander&rsquo;s stats were much higher than a small\nlittle bug. Wendell had no chance of beating him. He shivered, the thrill of\nthis battle felt so different from simulations, he couldn&rsquo;t wait to get\nstarted.</p><p>He pointed his finger towards the\nWeedle, &ldquo;Igneel use scratch!&rdquo; </p><p>After briefly looking at his\ntrainer, the Charmander turned back towards the battle and rushed forward\ntowards the Weedle. Igneel opened its hands and his three fingered claws\nextended and glowed white. When he reached Weedle he slashed, but the Weedle\nhad jumped back to avoid it.
