I accept submitted posts and will post anything that is not derogatory or rude. Please keep it civil, we are here to talk not belittle each other. Attackers will be blocked.NEW: I will now be cutting off or removing submissions that are just repeating discussions that have already taken place. Please read back if you have a question, chances are it's been answered. As an added note, we are aware that not all Harries are angry people but we sometimes generalize due to character limits, apologies in advance but we know there are many lovely, kind, friendly Harries out there and we don't mean to offend you. <!-- Start of StatCounter Code for Tumblr -->\n \n \n \n<!-- End of StatCounter Code for Tumblr -->",

It said that the interview is ready to be published, but you can go through it until today midnight and then they will publish it the next day. It contained a link to the video of the interview.<br/></p><p>You saw \u201cBillboard\u201d written on the black background then it said \u201cBillboard Exclusives: y/n y/l/n\u201d and under that \u201cSony Management.\u201d</p><p>Then it showed a few seconds intro where you said: \u201cMy name is y/n y/l/n, and this is my first Billboard Magazine interview.\u201d And you smiled in the camera.</p><p>\u201cWelcome in your first ever interview!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for having me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo first, tell me about yourself. Where are you coming from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born in Manchester. Then my family moved to Wales, but we moved back when I was five and we moved to Cornwall, where I met my best friend, who I am living with in London now. \u201c</p><p>\u201cIsn&rsquo;t she jealous that you&rsquo;re touring the world now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe&rsquo;s the best support I can have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s really good. But I&rsquo;m sure everyone is interested in your job right now. You became quite famous, because of it. What did it feel like being in the spotlight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was weird, but I handled it quite well. Harry, who&rsquo;s had a lot of spotlights, helped me a lot. He practically is my boss and he taught me a lot of things during our time together. Also, my other bosses from Sony and Jeff Azoff, Harry&rsquo;s manager, who is teaching me so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. I\u2019m learning a lot I\u2019m an apprentice, but maybe I can be a manager on my own in the future or have my own management company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be a dream and I think you\u2019d do a great job of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut being a PA wasn&rsquo;t unfamiliar to you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I worked for a BBC Radio 1 manager as a personal assistant for four years. She retired at the beginning of this year and I became unemployed. I enjoyed a little free time alone when I got a call the there\u2019s a PA wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t know it\u2018s Harry Styles when you applied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t told and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about who it could be. I was nervous because I got questions like \u201cDo you mind traveling a lot? Or being in the spotlight?\u201d And I was like \u201cOh God! Who\u2019s it gonna be?\u201d But it was a nice surprise when I finally met the mysterious man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know him before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, I was in the music industry in some way, so I obviously knew about him, but it was just that he\u2019s one-fifth of One Direction, currently on a solo tour. I knew his music, I love it. But we\u2019ve never met before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like, meeting him for the first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a life experience. We sat on a couch, he made me tea and offered me some cake that his mum made. It wasn\u2019t even a job interview. We had a friendly conversation. I was nervous in the beginning, but he made it smooth. He\u2019s just a genuine person who cares about anyone who he is talking to. He made me feel I was important. He asked me a lot of questions, but not like \u201cWhat was your first job? What languages do you speak?\u201d He asked me what my favorite place is and why, or If I could live in any other time, when would I? These were questions you don\u2019t get on a job interview and it made me feel safe about this job. I knew I want to work with him because he\u2019s kind and caring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! Almost shed a tear. It\u2019s a so beautiful story. No wonder you accepted the job. What is it like now?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just got better. First, it was overwhelming, but I got better in it, I got a lot of help. Harry and I became close friends and it just makes it easier to work with him. I have to be available 24/7, but it\u2019s not a weight on my shoulders, it\u2019s only caring about my friend, and when you have a friend like him, it\u2019s really easy to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true. And what about the crew and the band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhh, they really became my family. I&rsquo;m close with the band members and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who is the official photographer for the whole tour. The crew is amazing, they&rsquo;re all hard working and fun people. We have some inner jokes which make work a lot better.\u201c</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s so much funnier. What will you do when your contract ends in July?\u201c</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t exactly know, there are opportunities and I&rsquo;ll take the one that is best for me. I enjoy this job and after these months I don&rsquo;t know if I would do anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still something to figure out then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just leave out that you are rumored to be in a closer relationship with Harry. More than just friends.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful person and it\u2019s a pleasure to know him personally and even be best friends with him. I wouldn\u2019t change it at all.\u201c</p><p>\u201cNow we have time for a game. I\u2019ll ask some questions from this box, the box of interesting questions, and you have to give answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fun.\u201c</p><p>\u201cOkay, let&rsquo;s start.\u201c</p><p>\u201cWho was the last person you hugged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitch Rowland,\u201d you chuckled.</p><p>\u201cFavorite t.v. show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 It\u2019s so hard. Poldark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFavorite song from Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven harder\u2026 Sweet Creature\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could travel anywhere, where would you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrazil, because I was there recently and it was the best time of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFavorite smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanilla\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is something that not a lot of people know about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 I have food allergies\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you miss anyone?\u201d</p><p>Lottie, my best friend\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat skill would you like to master?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSinging\u201d you looked at Harry with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat pets did you have while you were growing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dog and two cats\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your go-to band or artist when you can\u2019t decide on something to listen to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Harry. 30 seconds to Mars. But Harry is second and very close.\u201d You and the interviewer laughed looking at Harry.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s something you like to do the old-fashioned way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDating\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite genre of book or movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomantic dramas\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you relax after a hard day of work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m constantly at work\u201d you chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the most annoying question that people ask you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m in a relationship\u201d she looked down because she asked this before. But she wasn&rsquo;t apologetic, it was just awkward for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s something you\u2019ve been meaning to try but just haven\u2019t gotten around to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cuhm\u2026\u201d you grinned looking at Harry who smirked back.</p><p>\u201cYou looked at Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no, I&rsquo;m just\u2026 let&rsquo;s say I want to try a lot of things.\u201d You blushed.</p><p>\u201cBig spoon or little spoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle spoon, but I was told I&rsquo;m a good big spoon too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s all. Thank you, y/n for doing this interview in your very strict schedule. Good luck with your future plans and we hope to hear from you soon.\u201d She smiled. You smiled into the camera too and it was over.</p><p>When you finished watching it, you were satisfied with the video itself. But it hurt seeing that not so long ago you were so happy around Harry. You sent the reply and waited for it to shake the internet. You knew you have a lot of fans and that they know a lot about your secret relationship with Harry and that you probably broke up. They followed your actions and you followed them.</p>",

It said that the interview is ready to be published, but you can go through it until today midnight and then they will publish it the next day.

Where are you coming from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born in Manchester. Then my family moved to Wales, but we moved back when I was five and we moved to Cornwall, where I met my best friend, who I am living with in London now. \u201c</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she jealous that you\u2019re touring the world now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the best support I can have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really good. But I\u2019m sure everyone is interested in your job right now. You became quite famous, because of it. What did it feel like being in the spotlight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was weird, but I handled it quite well. Harry, who\u2019s had a lot of spotlights, helped me a lot. He practically is my boss and he taught me a lot of things during our time together. Also, my other bosses from Sony and Jeff Azoff, Harry\u2019s manager, who is teaching me so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. I\u2019m learning a lot I\u2019m an apprentice, but maybe I can be a manager on my own in the future or have my own management company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be a dream and I think you\u2019d do a great job of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut being a PA wasn\u2019t unfamiliar to you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I worked for a BBC Radio 1 manager as a personal assistant for four years. She retired at the beginning of this year and I became unemployed. I enjoyed a little free time alone when I got a call the there\u2019s a PA wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t know it\u2018s Harry Styles when you applied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t told and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about who it could be. I was nervous because I got questions like \u201cDo you mind traveling a lot? Or being in the spotlight?\u201d And I was like \u201cOh God! Who\u2019s it gonna be?\u201d But it was a nice surprise when I finally met the mysterious man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know him before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, I was in the music industry in some way, so I obviously knew about him, but it was just that he\u2019s one-fifth of One Direction, currently on a solo tour. I knew his music, I love it. But we\u2019ve never met before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like, meeting him for the first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a life experience. We sat on a couch, he made me tea and offered me some cake that his mum made. It wasn\u2019t even a job interview. We had a friendly conversation. I was nervous in the beginning, but he made it smooth. He\u2019s just a genuine person who cares about anyone who he is talking to. He made me feel I was important. He asked me a lot of questions, but not like \u201cWhat was your first job? What languages do you speak?\u201d He asked me what my favorite place is and why, or If I could live in any other time, when would I? These were questions you don\u2019t get on a job interview and it made me feel safe about this job. I knew I want to work with him because he\u2019s kind and caring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! Almost shed a tear. It\u2019s a so beautiful story. No wonder you accepted the job. What is it like now?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just got better. First, it was overwhelming, but I got better in it, I got a lot of help. Harry and I became close friends and it just makes it easier to work with him. I have to be available 24/7, but it\u2019s not a weight on my shoulders, it\u2019s only caring about my friend, and when you have a friend like him, it\u2019s really easy to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true. And what about the crew and the band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhh, they really became my family. I\u2019m close with the band members and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who is the official photographer for the whole tour. The crew is amazing, they\u2019re all hard working and fun people. We have some inner jokes which make work a lot better.\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s so much funnier. What will you do when your contract ends in July?\u201c</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly know, there are opportunities and I\u2019ll take the one that is best for me. I enjoy this job and after these months I don\u2019t know if I would do anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still something to figure out then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just leave out that you are rumored to be in a closer relationship with Harry. More than just friends.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful person and it\u2019s a pleasure to know him personally and even be best friends with him. I wouldn\u2019t change it at all.\u201c</p><p>\u201cNow we have time for a game. I\u2019ll ask some questions from this box, the box of interesting questions, and you have to give answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fun.\u201c</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s start.\u201c</p><p>\u201cWho was the last person you hugged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitch Rowland,\u201d you chuckled.</p><p>\u201cFavorite t.v. show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 It\u2019s so hard.

But Harry is second and very close.\u201d You and the interviewer laughed looking at Harry.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s something you like to do the old-fashioned way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDating\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite genre of book or movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomantic dramas\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you relax after a hard day of work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m constantly at work\u201d you chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the most annoying question that people ask you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m in a relationship\u201d she looked down because she asked this before. But she wasn\u2019t apologetic, it was just awkward for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s something you\u2019ve been meaning to try but just haven\u2019t gotten around to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cuhm\u2026\u201d you grinned looking at Harry who smirked back.</p><p>\u201cYou looked at Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no, I\u2019m just\u2026 let\u2019s say I want to try a lot of things.\u201d You blushed.</p><p>\u201cBig spoon or little spoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle spoon, but I was told I\u2019m a good big spoon too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all. Thank you, y/n for doing this interview in your very strict schedule. Good luck with your future plans and we hope to hear from you soon.\u201d She smiled.

It said that the interview is ready to be published, but you can go through it until today midnight and then they will publish it the next day. It contained a link to the video of the interview.<br /></p><p>You saw &ldquo;Billboard&rdquo; written on the black background then it said &ldquo;Billboard Exclusives: y/n y/l/n&rdquo; and under that &ldquo;Sony Management.&rdquo;</p><p>Then it showed a few seconds intro where you said: &ldquo;My name is y/n y/l/n, and this is my first Billboard Magazine interview.&rdquo; And you smiled in the camera.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome in your first ever interview!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for having me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So first, tell me about yourself. Where are you coming from?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was born in Manchester. Then my family moved to Wales, but we moved back when I was five and we moved to Cornwall, where I met my best friend, who I am living with in London now. &ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she jealous that you&rsquo;re touring the world now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the best support I can have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really good. But I&rsquo;m sure everyone is interested in your job right now. You became quite famous, because of it. What did it feel like being in the spotlight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was weird, but I handled it quite well. Harry, who&rsquo;s had a lot of spotlights, helped me a lot. He practically is my boss and he taught me a lot of things during our time together. Also, my other bosses from Sony and Jeff Azoff, Harry&rsquo;s manager, who is teaching me so well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. I&rsquo;m learning a lot I&rsquo;m an apprentice, but maybe I can be a manager on my own in the future or have my own management company.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be a dream and I think you&rsquo;d do a great job of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But being a PA wasn&rsquo;t unfamiliar to you, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I worked for a BBC Radio 1 manager as a personal assistant for four years. She retired at the beginning of this year and I became unemployed. I enjoyed a little free time alone when I got a call the there&rsquo;s a PA wanted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t know it&lsquo;s Harry Styles when you applied.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. I wasn&rsquo;t told and I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about who it could be. I was nervous because I got questions like &ldquo;Do you mind traveling a lot? Or being in the spotlight?&rdquo; And I was like &ldquo;Oh God! Who&rsquo;s it gonna be?&rdquo; But it was a nice surprise when I finally met the mysterious man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you know him before?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I mean, I was in the music industry in some way, so I obviously knew about him, but it was just that he&rsquo;s one-fifth of One Direction, currently on a solo tour. I knew his music, I love it. But we&rsquo;ve never met before that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What was it like, meeting him for the first time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a life experience. We sat on a couch, he made me tea and offered me some cake that his mum made. It wasn&rsquo;t even a job interview. We had a friendly conversation. I was nervous in the beginning, but he made it smooth. He&rsquo;s just a genuine person who cares about anyone who he is talking to. He made me feel I was important. He asked me a lot of questions, but not like &ldquo;What was your first job? What languages do you speak?&rdquo; He asked me what my favorite place is and why, or If I could live in any other time, when would I? These were questions you don&rsquo;t get on a job interview and it made me feel safe about this job. I knew I want to work with him because he&rsquo;s kind and caring.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow! Almost shed a tear. It&rsquo;s a so beautiful story. No wonder you accepted the job. What is it like now?</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just got better. First, it was overwhelming, but I got better in it, I got a lot of help. Harry and I became close friends and it just makes it easier to work with him. I have to be available 24/7, but it&rsquo;s not a weight on my shoulders, it&rsquo;s only caring about my friend, and when you have a friend like him, it&rsquo;s really easy to do so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. And what about the crew and the band?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ohh, they really became my family. I&rsquo;m close with the band members and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, who is the official photographer for the whole tour. The crew is amazing, they&rsquo;re all hard working and fun people. We have some inner jokes which make work a lot better.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s so much funnier. What will you do when your contract ends in July?&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know, there are opportunities and I&rsquo;ll take the one that is best for me. I enjoy this job and after these months I don&rsquo;t know if I would do anything else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still something to figure out then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just leave out that you are rumored to be in a closer relationship with Harry. More than just friends.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a wonderful person and it&rsquo;s a pleasure to know him personally and even be best friends with him. I wouldn&rsquo;t change it at all.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now we have time for a game. I&rsquo;ll ask some questions from this box, the box of interesting questions, and you have to give answers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds fun.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s start.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who was the last person you hugged?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mitch Rowland,&rdquo; you chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Favorite t.v. show?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip; It&rsquo;s so hard. Poldark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Favorite song from Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even harder&hellip; Sweet Creature&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you could travel anywhere, where would you go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Brazil, because I was there recently and it was the best time of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Favorite smell?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Vanilla&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is something that not a lot of people know about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip; I have food allergies&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you miss anyone?&rdquo;</p><p>Lottie, my best friend&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What skill would you like to master?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Singing&rdquo; you looked at Harry with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your favorite drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tea&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What pets did you have while you were growing up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A dog and two cats&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your go-to band or artist when you can&rsquo;t decide on something to listen to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Harry. 30 seconds to Mars. But Harry is second and very close.&rdquo; You and the interviewer laughed looking at Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s something you like to do the old-fashioned way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dating&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your favorite genre of book or movie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Romantic dramas&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you relax after a hard day of work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m constantly at work&rdquo; you chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the most annoying question that people ask you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m in a relationship&rdquo; she looked down because she asked this before. But she wasn&rsquo;t apologetic, it was just awkward for her.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve been meaning to try but just haven&rsquo;t gotten around to it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;uhm&hellip;&rdquo; you grinned looking at Harry who smirked back.</p><p>&ldquo;You looked at Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, no, I&rsquo;m just&hellip; let&rsquo;s say I want to try a lot of things.&rdquo; You blushed.</p><p>&ldquo;Big spoon or little spoon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Little spoon, but I was told I&rsquo;m a good big spoon too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. Thank you, y/n for doing this interview in your very strict schedule. Good luck with your future plans and we hope to hear from you soon.&rdquo; She smiled. You smiled into the camera too and it was over.</p><p>When you finished watching it, you were satisfied with the video itself. But it hurt seeing that not so long ago you were so happy around Harry. You sent the reply and waited for it to shake the internet. You knew you have a lot of fans and that they know a lot about your secret relationship with Harry and that you probably broke up. They followed your actions and you followed them.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>It\u2019s actually a little bit of all of that. Anne and Gemma swoop in, buying as many newborn diapers as they can find, some baby shampoo and body wash, the grooming kits, clothes \u2013 everything. The missus does still have some of Love\u2019s baby things, but most of it she gave away for some extra money. They have to go out and get a crib, a bassinet, bottles, baby monitors, burp clothes, cartseat, breast pump\u2026 the list goes on and on. They are very overwhelmed, and it doesn\u2019t help that they have to all of this by the time she is due to leave the hospital, but they have a newborn baby now and aren\u2019t mentally prepared in the slightest. A lot of their friends and family go out and get them these things, just so they don\u2019t have to stress themselves out any more than they are. And Oliver does wear some of Love\u2019s old onesies, lmao. The ones with her name on it, the missus couldn\u2019t find it in her to give those away. She said if she ever had another girl, it would be perfect for her. Except she didn\u2019t know she would be having a son\u2026and he would be the one wearing them when he runs out of clean newborn clothes. </p><p>Honestly, Anne is their savior. She helped immensely, and had some of her friends too. Nearly everything they got in the first week, was from her. Harry ended up buying a lot of other things online and had it delivered to the house, but the important things like the carseat, diapers, bassinet, bottles, etc. was all her. And they are forever in debt.<br/></p>",
