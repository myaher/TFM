Even Remus insists that Harry has &ldquo;<i>inherited an old prejudice.</i>&rdquo; Which would imply that it\u2019s Harry\u2019s responsibility to try and see another side of Snape. Even though Snape has never shown another side to him. People act like it was a rivalry, similar to Harry and Draco. Like there were faults on both sides. But that simply isn\u2019t true. Harry&rsquo;s hatred of Snape developed over time, as a result of how he was treated. Snape&rsquo;s hatred of Harry was completely unwarranted. A result of his complicated feelings toward the son of his true love and worst enemy.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I realize that meeting Harry can\u2019t have been easy.</h2><p>For all we know, it might have been extremely uncomfortable for Snape to meet the child of Lily and James. I understand the position he was in. But even so,\u00a0 that&rsquo;s not Harry&rsquo;s fault. Snape is the adult in this situation, he can sort through that emotional baggage on his own time. Harry and James are not the same person, even if they look alike, and there&rsquo;s no excuse for projecting unresolved anger onto a child. Harry and Snape&rsquo;s &ldquo;animosity&rdquo; only began because Snape couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to treat Harry with the faintest semblance of decency. Like I said, I know Snape had plenty of reason to feel awkward around Harry. But he could have done better than treating Harry like trash. Yet he doesn&rsquo;t even try. Right from the start, he bullies and emotionally abuses an eleven year old that he doesn\u2019t even know.</p><p><br/></p><h2>\u00a0And nobody does anything about it, either.</h2><p>Snape&rsquo;s behavior would, in any other situation, be disciplined. But here, <b>Harry</b> is the one asked to be the bigger person. He&rsquo;s just expected to grit his teeth. Which, by the way, he <b>does.</b> In most of their conversations, Harry responds to Snape&rsquo;s open insults by at least pretending to show respect. Usually because Snape could punish him if he doesn&rsquo;t. Which is another reason this &ldquo;rivalry&rdquo; was uneven - Snape held a position of power over Harry. Power that he would happily abuse - insulting Harry, and then giving him detention for not taking the insults lying down. Snape was left unregulated to treat his students however he pleased, and he treated them like dirt. It wasn\u2019t just Harry, either. <b>If a teacher in real life treated students the way Neville and Hermione were treated in Snape\u2019s class, I am fairly certain that teacher would be fired.</b><br/><br/>Now, I\u2019ve seen people express the same sentiments as Dumbledore. That Snape&rsquo;s behavior toward Harry is regrettable, but that Harry is equally responsible for how things turned out, being biased against Snape and always hating him. That his refusing to trust Snape was his own mistake. That Snape was always fighting to protect him and help Dumbledore, and Harry was bratty toward him. Even if we want to say Harry&rsquo;s at fault for not keeping an open mind about Snape (<i>despite not having any reason to</i>) I do have to ask - Harry always hated Snape? Really?\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><h2>Because Harry was remarkably tolerant of Snape\u2019s behavior, for quite a while.</h2><p>Probably used to such treatment thanks to the Dursleys, Harry really doesn&rsquo;t express any venom toward Snape in the first two books. Apart from suspecting him of being after the Philosopher\u2019s Stone (<i>which was because of Snape\u2019s injured leg, not personal bias</i>)\u00a0 Harry merely calls Snape his least favorite teacher, and laments that Snape hates him so much. Harry is nothing but respectful in the face of all the bullying. So, when does he crack? In the third book, when it gets personal. Snape is viciously insulting Harry&rsquo;s father, not for the first time, and only then does Harry finally tell him to back off. Tells him &ldquo;<i>Shut up!</i>&rdquo; Which, sure, isn&rsquo;t something a student should say to a teacher. Out of context, it is kinda bratty. But the thing is, we <b>have</b> context.\u00a0This teacher has spent the last three years mistreating him. This teacher was <i>insulting an orphan\u2019s dead parents.</i> Harry had every right to get angry.<br/><br/></p><h2>The second time in POA that Harry blows up at Snape, comes in the Shrieking Shack.\u00a0</h2><p>Between stealing Harry&rsquo;s cloak, insulting Hermione without provocation (again) and attempting to drag Sirius and Remus to the dementors, Harry loses his patience. And really, who can blame him? He&rsquo;s begun to realize that Sirius might actually be innocent, and Remus&hellip;literally hasn&rsquo;t done anything at all. Snape is <i><b>way</b></i> too eager to subject them to the Dementor&rsquo;s Kiss. I know, I know they have history. I know that Sirius nearly killed Snape before. But that isn&rsquo;t an excuse to look the other way when there\u2019s potential evidence of Sirius&rsquo; innocence. And it&rsquo;s definitely not an excuse to let the Dementors perform the kiss on Remus. ((<i>This was based on <b>what</b>, exactly? Suspicion? Snape had no proof that Remus had been helping Sirius - because he hadn\u2019t been.</i>))<br/><br/>Yet still, even as the Trio attempts to stop him from essentially murdering two people, Snape refuses to listen. Shouts insults at Hermione when she (<i>very politely</i>) suggests they listen to what Sirius has to say. (<i>Later on, he attempts to discredit the trio&rsquo;s testimony, just to make sure he gets what he wants</i>.) So Harry calls him pathetic, and attempts to disarm him.\u00a0<br/></p><h2><br/>And, honestly? Snape is pathetic.\u00a0</h2><p>He might be clever. He might be talented. He might be brave. The bravest man Harry ever knew. I&rsquo;m not going to argue that he was brave. I&rsquo;m not going to deny his talents - he was the greatest Occlumens and Potions Master of the entire series. But he was still pathetic. An adult who bullies a child to take petty revenge on his own childhood bully (<i>who is <b>long dead</b></i>) can be described no other way. Outing a Werewolf and potentially ruining his life, all because of bitterness, is the definition of pathetic. After POA, Harry finally seems to actively hate Snape. But after three years of emotional abuse at the hands of his own teacher, over something that literally had nothing to do with him (<i>James</i>) Don&rsquo;t you think he earned that?<br/><br/>Whenever people give Harry grief for being so suspicious of Snape in HBP, or try to hold Harry accountable for the failure of the Occlumency lessons, or for snooping in Snape&rsquo;s Memories&hellip;it frustrates me. <b>Snape has his talents, but teaching is simply not one of them.</b> Harry has no reason to respect or trust Snape at all. Dumbledore insists that Snape is on their side, but won&rsquo;t tell Harry why. ((<i>Dumbledore is arguably worse than Snape, particularly since he enabled all this&hellip;but that&rsquo;s a post for another day.</i>) Snape never makes any attempt to perceive Harry as anything but James 2.0, and never fails to punish him for James&rsquo; actions. Please, tell me <i>why</i> Harry should keep an open mind about him, or give him the time of day. Tell me why there are faults on <i>both</i> sides. Harry was a child when they met, and he never did <b>anything</b> to Snape. On the other hand, Snape took it upon himself to decide that Harry and James were &ldquo;the same&rdquo; and then went out of his way to make Harry, and all of Harry&rsquo;s friends, miserable.
