I go by Jackie or Dude because that's what Taylor Swift called me when I met her on June 1st, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois.\nTaylor followed 8/15/15 and liked 1x a photo of me and my best friend just chilling and a photo of me and the love of my life on New Years day and I haven't recovered since. She also told me she saw my tour outfits and thought I was really dedicated so she saved them and had someone come find me so she could meet me!!!!!\n Feeling 23 and blessed, living in a big ol' (windy) city.\nfollow my insta account @ YourQueenB\nTaylor Swift enthusiast since 2008.

I now have a different answer to Dr. Marzoni\u2019s question about things that stand out in the video as odd. The most peculiar detail is how many girls are singing along to the lyrics. At twenty seconds into the video, Chris already calls the audience insincere, but starts singing about a girl in the second, and turns the artificiality into that of unfaithfulness. Theoretically, he could be addressing all cheaters, and is simply doing so from the perspective of a guy, but Carrabba\u2019s lyrics as they are sung can only be interpreted as addressing a female.
