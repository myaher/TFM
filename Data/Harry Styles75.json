It was completely empty, but that was no surprise as you were travelling this late, so there were only a few people on the train anyway. <br/></p><p>You huffed as you slumped in your seat next to Harry. \u201cI mean I really like Rosy, but damn, does she always have to talk that much?\u201d, you said, finally having Harry all to yourself again. He immediately pulled you into his chest. <br/>\u201cI guess you do have a point, love\u201d, he said, enjoying this comfortable silence, too. None of you said anything for a while, you just listened to the sound of the train moving and quietly enjoying each others company.</p><p>Harry started to play with your hair as you continued to cuddle, and soon, you found yourself tracing the tattoos on his arm, inching higher and higher until you reached his collarbone. You could feel his breath hitching for a moment, until he continued to breathe in a quicker pace. You smirked as you looked up to your boyfriend, whose cheeks were now tinted in a delicate blush. Yes, maybe you two had some catching up to do, since you couldn\u2019t even share a single kiss today because Rosy just kept talking and talking&hellip; <br/></p><p>Harry\u2019s lips curved into your favourite dimpled smile, before you coud feel them on the side of your neck. Harry placed some feathery kisses here and there, until he brushed his lips over the one spot that drove you mad every. damn. time. And this little shit here did it on purpose. He kissed it even harder and started to suck on the skin, making sure there\u2019d be a mark. <br/></p><p>You moved your hands to the back of his neck, reaching for his curls and slightly tugging on them. He groaned slightly, making you chuckle.</p><p>Harry pulled away from your neck, now reaching for your waist so he could pull you into his lap. You happily obliged, giggling when Harry cupped your bum in his large hands. You leant your forehead against his, your breath mingling in such a delicate way. <br/></p><p>\u201cMissed you all day, darlin\u2019\u201c, Harry whispered.</p><p>You smiled before you slowly closed the distance between your lips. You enjoyed the feeling of his soft, plumb lips on yours, and you could still taste a little hint of the coffee you had at Glenn\u2019s shortly before you had left. <br/></p><p>At first, the kiss was very lazy, as the two of you were savoring it. It was only when Harry squeezed your bum a little and caused you to gasp that he slipped his tongue inside of your mouth. The kiss immediately became more heated, as the two of you explored each others mouths. Of course, after all those kisses that you had shared, you were completely familiar with each other, but that didn\u2019t make this any less interesting. For a little while, all that could be heard in the compartment was the sound of your lips against his and your breathing, which became faster the longer you kissed. <br/></p><p>\u201cHhhmmm\u201d, you hummed, \u201cI wan\u2019 you so bad righ\u2019 now.\u201d <br/></p><p>Harry chuckled, the sound muffled against your lip. <br/></p><p>\u201cY\u2019 know I\u2019d be down to it, but I don\u2019 know if we should do it righ\u2019 here\u201d, he said after pulling away. <br/></p><p>\u201cSuch a pity\u201d, you pouted.</p><p>\u201cBut you know, it\u2019s such a long ride, I think I might need a wee righ\u2019 now\u201d, he said, a mischievous grin spreading across his features. <br/></p><p>You slowly mounted down from his lap, sitting back onto the bench next to him. <br/></p><p>\u201cWell maybe you should go then\u201d, you said in a teasing manner.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could come check on me in a few minutes? I\u2019d probably need a hand\u201d, he whispered before he got up and went out of the compartment. Your gaze followed him down the aisle, where you supposed the toilets were.After a minute or two, you followed him down the aisle, gently knocking on the door of the toilet. <br/></p><p>Immediately, the door was unlocked and you sneaked in. It wasn\u2019t very roomy in there, especially when it wasn\u2019t made for two people, so you found yourself pushed against Harry in an instant. You could feel a bulge forming in his pants when Harry embraced you, reconnecting your lips. This time, the kiss was tongue, more lips, and a bit of moaning. <br/></p><p>\u201cShh, keep quiet for me, will ya, love?\u201d, Harry said. \u201cDon\u2019 wanna get caught, do we?\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but smirk at the thought of that. You\u2019d never been intimate in public before, but if you were honest, it turned you on a little bit. <br/></p><p>You quickly kissed Harry again, who now pressed you against the door of the small cabin. Harry quickly pulled out the condom that he had snuck into the cabin in his back pocket, before your hands wandered down his abdomen and started to fumble with his belt, finally opening his jeans so they could fall down to the floor along with his boxers. You fought back a moan at the sight of his member. While Harry started to undress you, you quickly took the condom from him and put it onto him, pumping his lenght up and down a few times until he finally got rid of your pants and knickers. Harry reached down to touch you a few times, too, rubbing your clit at first and then quickly pumping two fingers in and out of you.</p><p>\u201cSo wet already fo\u2019 me, love\u201d, he whispered into your ear as he took the fingers to his mouth and licked your juices off.</p><p>You had been placing soft kisses on the side of his neck as he said \u201cJump\u201d in that raspy, deep voice of his that drove you mad. <br/></p><p>Of course, you happily obliged, wrapping your legs around his waist. You already felt his cock at your entrance, but since Harry was holding you up with both his hands, it was you who guided his length into you. He was very careful, as always, letting you adjust to him before he slowly started to move. <br/></p><p>\u201c\u2018s tha\u2019 okay, baby?\u201d, he asked.</p><p>You nodded. \u201cYou feel so good, H\u201d, you whispered. You closed the distance between your lips again, so you wouldn\u2019t have to fight back your moans so hard. <br/></p><p>You both were so worked up already from having to wait for this all day, so it took Harry only a few well-practiced thrusts to have you both on the verge of cumming.</p><p>\u201cShit, \u2018m close, Harry\u201d, you whispered against his hips. <br/></p><p>\u201cMe too\u201d, he said. After two more of those deep thrusts of him, you rolled your eyes back in pleasure. You could feel Harry\u2019s cock twitch inside of you two.<br/>This time it was Harry who had to fight back moans, because the feeling of having you clench around him was just a little bit too much to handle for now. Before any sound could escape his lips however, you kissed him again, lazy this time. The only thing audible was your heavy breathing.\u00a0</p><p>As you recollected yourself, Harry gently pulled out of you and set you down onto your own feet. He disposed of the condom while you cleaned yourself up a bit. <br/></p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have an encore at home\u201d, he said as the two of you got dressed. <br/></p><p>\u201cDefinitely\u201d, you answered and smiled into the kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d, Harry asked as he smoothed down the last few strands of your hair that had gotten a little bit out of place.</p><p>As you nodded, he opened the lock of the toilet door and peeked down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon\u201d, he whispered and took your hand in his as you made your way down to your compartment, the blush on your faces and the marks on your neck giving you away.</p><hr><p>Really hope you liked it!

For a little while, all that could be heard in the compartment was the sound of your lips against his and your breathing, which became faster the longer you kissed. <br></p><p>\u201cHhhmmm\u201d, you hummed, \u201cI wan\u2019 you so bad righ\u2019 now.\u201d <br></p><p>Harry chuckled, the sound muffled against your lip. <br></p><p>\u201cY\u2019 know I\u2019d be down to it, but I don\u2019 know if we should do it righ\u2019 here\u201d, he said after pulling away. <br></p><p>\u201cSuch a pity\u201d, you pouted.</p><p>\u201cBut you know, it\u2019s such a long ride, I think I might need a wee righ\u2019 now\u201d, he said, a mischievous grin spreading across his features. <br></p><p>You slowly mounted down from his lap, sitting back onto the bench next to him. <br></p><p>\u201cWell maybe you should go then\u201d, you said in a teasing manner.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could come check on me in a few minutes? I\u2019d probably need a hand\u201d, he whispered before he got up and went out of the compartment. Your gaze followed him down the aisle, where you supposed the toilets were.After a minute or two, you followed him down the aisle, gently knocking on the door of the toilet. <br></p><p>Immediately, the door was unlocked and you sneaked in. It wasn\u2019t very roomy in there, especially when it wasn\u2019t made for two people, so you found yourself pushed against Harry in an instant. You could feel a bulge forming in his pants when Harry embraced you, reconnecting your lips. This time, the kiss was tongue, more lips, and a bit of moaning. <br></p><p>\u201cShh, keep quiet for me, will ya, love?\u201d, Harry said. \u201cDon\u2019 wanna get caught, do we?\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but smirk at the thought of that. You\u2019d never been intimate in public before, but if you were honest, it turned you on a little bit. <br></p><p>You quickly kissed Harry again, who now pressed you against the door of the small cabin. Harry quickly pulled out the condom that he had snuck into the cabin in his back pocket, before your hands wandered down his abdomen and started to fumble with his belt, finally opening his jeans so they could fall down to the floor along with his boxers. You fought back a moan at the sight of his member. While Harry started to undress you, you quickly took the condom from him and put it onto him, pumping his lenght up and down a few times until he finally got rid of your pants and knickers. Harry reached down to touch you a few times, too, rubbing your clit at first and then quickly pumping two fingers in and out of you.</p><p>\u201cSo wet already fo\u2019 me, love\u201d, he whispered into your ear as he took the fingers to his mouth and licked your juices off.</p><p>You had been placing soft kisses on the side of his neck as he said \u201cJump\u201d in that raspy, deep voice of his that drove you mad. <br></p><p>Of course, you happily obliged, wrapping your legs around his waist. You already felt his cock at your entrance, but since Harry was holding you up with both his hands, it was you who guided his length into you. He was very careful, as always, letting you adjust to him before he slowly started to move. <br></p><p>\u201c\u2018s tha\u2019 okay, baby?\u201d, he asked.</p><p>You nodded. \u201cYou feel so good, H\u201d, you whispered. You closed the distance between your lips again, so you wouldn\u2019t have to fight back your moans so hard. <br></p><p>You both were so worked up already from having to wait for this all day, so it took Harry only a few well-practiced thrusts to have you both on the verge of cumming.</p><p>\u201cShit, \u2018m close, Harry\u201d, you whispered against his hips. <br></p><p>\u201cMe too\u201d, he said. After two more of those deep thrusts of him, you rolled your eyes back in pleasure. You could feel Harry\u2019s cock twitch inside of you two.<br>This time it was Harry who had to fight back moans, because the feeling of having you clench around him was just a little bit too much to handle for now. Before any sound could escape his lips however, you kissed him again, lazy this time. The only thing audible was your heavy breathing.\u00a0</p><p>As you recollected yourself, Harry gently pulled out of you and set you down onto your own feet. He disposed of the condom while you cleaned yourself up a bit. <br></p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have an encore at home\u201d, he said as the two of you got dressed. <br></p><p>\u201cDefinitely\u201d, you answered and smiled into the kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d, Harry asked as he smoothed down the last few strands of your hair that had gotten a little bit out of place.</p><p>As you nodded, he opened the lock of the toilet door and peeked down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon\u201d, he whispered and took your hand in his as you made your way down to your compartment, the blush on your faces and the marks on your neck giving you away.</p><hr><p>Really hope you liked it!

It was completely empty, but that was no surprise as you were travelling this late, so there were only a few people on the train anyway. <br></p><p>You huffed as you slumped in your seat next to Harry. \u201cI mean I really like Rosy, but damn, does she always have to talk that much?\u201d, you said, finally having Harry all to yourself again. He immediately pulled you into his chest. <br>\u201cI guess you do have a point, love\u201d, he said, enjoying this comfortable silence, too. None of you said anything for a while, you just listened to the sound of the train moving and quietly enjoying each others company.</p><p>Harry started to play with your hair as you continued to cuddle, and soon, you found yourself tracing the tattoos on his arm, inching higher and higher until you reached his collarbone. You could feel his breath hitching for a moment, until he continued to breathe in a quicker pace. You smirked as you looked up to your boyfriend, whose cheeks were now tinted in a delicate blush. Yes, maybe you two had some catching up to do, since you couldn\u2019t even share a single kiss today because Rosy just kept talking and talking\u2026 <br></p><p>Harry\u2019s lips curved into your favourite dimpled smile, before you coud feel them on the side of your neck. Harry placed some feathery kisses here and there, until he brushed his lips over the one spot that drove you mad every. damn. time. And this little shit here did it on purpose. He kissed it even harder and started to suck on the skin, making sure there\u2019d be a mark. <br></p><p>You moved your hands to the back of his neck, reaching for his curls and slightly tugging on them. He groaned slightly, making you chuckle.</p><p>Harry pulled away from your neck, now reaching for your waist so he could pull you into his lap. You happily obliged, giggling when Harry cupped your bum in his large hands. You leant your forehead against his, your breath mingling in such a delicate way. <br></p><p>\u201cMissed you all day, darlin\u2019\u201c, Harry whispered.</p><p>You smiled before you slowly closed the distance between your lips. You enjoyed the feeling of his soft, plumb lips on yours, and you could still taste a little hint of the coffee you had at Glenn\u2019s shortly before you had left. <br></p><p>At first, the kiss was very lazy, as the two of you were savoring it. It was only when Harry squeezed your bum a little and caused you to gasp that he slipped his tongue inside of your mouth. The kiss immediately became more heated, as the two of you explored each others mouths.

        "answer": "<p>\u201cY/N!\u201d You hear, followed by what seems to be the sound of a moan. </p><p>You shake your head, wondering what exactly it is that your boyfriend could possibly be doing. He had always been such a clutz - knocking things over, somehow managing to get hit in the head by various falling objects; always, always tripping over whatever ended up underfoot. </p><p>What you didn\u2019t expect was to enter your shared bedroom to find him lost in deep concentration, entertaining himself. Hand connected to himself in the most loving of manners, panting, with your name slipping from his parted lips at semi-regular intervals.</p><p>You felt odd watching him, but everything about him in that moment showcased his utter beauty. Pulling you into the moment alongside him - even though you were merely watching.  </p><p>After several more moments, your panties starting to dampen, you were no longer able to contain yourself. You needed him, and he was clearly in need of you. </p><p>Carefully making your way to the bed, you did your best not to startle him - not wanting to cause him any unfortunate discomfort. </p><p>Delicately kissing his parted lips, you smiled as his eyes sprung open, love and neediness staring up at you. \u201cHey, heard you moan my name. Need a hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom you? Is that even a question?\u201d </p><p>His voice is low, deep and sexy; drawing you to him. </p><p>Without another word, you plant your lips to his, kissing him as though your life is dependent on it - for all you knew it was. </p><p>Moving down to his exposed stomach, you lick a strip up from his navel, losing yourself in the taste of the salty sweat already glistening over his tanned skin. </p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d his response is guttural, his body twitching beneath you. All need and completely at your mercy.</p><p>Your teeth gently graze his hip, his hands now lost in your hair as he tries to pull you closer. Both of you now longing to merge, to become linked through the only manner humanly possible. </p><p>\u201cN-need,\u201d he stutters, hands swiftly disposing of shorts. Before you can protest your undies have been pushed aside, making room for much practiced fingers to find their home inside. </p><p>Returning your lips to his, you moan into his mouth; keeping perfect timing to the carefully practiced pace of talented fingers. </p><p>\u201cLike that, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d You can feel yourself start to verge on flooding, desperate pleas falling from your now chapped lips as you yearn for more; ache for it even. </p><p>Needing to grant unrestricted access to your fleshy parts, you reach down, making it clear that freedom is in order. You want your love to flow from your body to his, a form of osmosis that can only happen during sex. </p><p>No spoken words are needed as his arms are flung around you, your saturation allowing him to easily slip inside. Your moans telling him all he needs to know as he starts to move, kisses being plastered along every inch of reachable skin; so lost in one another that neither of you flinch when him rolling you over leads to landing on the floor. </p><p>With a slight grunt from him followed by a giggle from you, rythym is promptly resumed. Nothing able to halt the flow of love coming from the two of you. </p><p>\u201cSo &hellip; So, close.\u201d He\u2019s panting now, your own breath coming in spasmodic bouts as your need to burst grows more and more consuming. </p><p>Biting your bottom lip you nod, hands yanking at unruly curls as he seems to hit harder and deeper with each movement. \u201cB-baby, C-can\u2019t&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Voice a soft hiss, he lines his lips up with your ear, hand not supporting his weight easily finding its way to your clit, rubbing circles that make your whole body arch up from the ground. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>Teeth biting down harder, a hint of blood awakening your taste buds, you revel in the moment; the two of you losing yourself within seconds of one another. </p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he pants, body resting on top of your own spent one. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Tiredness overtaking you, you kiss his shoulder, muttering your own \u2018love you\u2019 before closing your eyes and just breathing in the scent left behind on sweat soaked skin. </p><p>*** </p>",
