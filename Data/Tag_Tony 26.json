Nothing happened, until in his frustration, frost started to form over the chair on which his other hand rested. He pushed it away in disgust.</p><p>Tony traced the patterns. \u201cI know this wasn\u2019t what you\u2019re going for, but I still think it\u2019s awesome. But for now, let\u2019s go upstairs and watch a movie, order pizza in, how about that?\u201d He patted Loki\u2019s shoulder, and Loki resisted the urge to lean into that touch, because he was not a pathetic, touch starved wretch.</p><p>Only perhaps he was, he thought, as he followed Tony into the elevator and up to the film room, listening to him chat non-stop, a fond smile fighting its way onto his lips. Or perhaps he was Tony-starved. For the gentle, simple affection that Tony handed out at every opportunity. For the bright, joyful smiles that accompanied success, and the swear words when he failed, for the mental leaps and the sparking of intellect, ideas linking across a void that no other would consider crossing.</p><p>He had not known it could <i>be</i> like this, that friendship, that <i>people</i> could be so wonderful. He had never wanted to be with anyone so much as he wanted to be with Tony, every moment of the day.</p><p>He rubbed his sternum over the top of the thin cotton fabric that Tony had bought for him when he first arrived weeks ago. Tony was generous, affectionate, kind, fantastically intelligent - and not even just <i>for a mortal</i>, but for any being. He was also the most beautiful sight Loki had ever seen.</p><p>He was nothing like the men and women Loki had been attracted to before - he was honestly nothing like any men on Asgard. He was small, his head would have fitted perfectly beneath Loki\u2019s chin should they embrace as lovers. His hair, dark brown and silvering at the temples, was coarser than his own, holding its shape when Tony ran his fingers through it, spiking it up in all directions, making Loki long to smooth it down, or even mess it up himself. His eyes were a deep, rich brown that invited Loki to stare into them, to lose himself, to test the limits of their gentle acceptance.</p><p>And his hands\u2026 Loki could watch him work all day if given the chance, watch the powerful muscles tense and bunch under the short sleeved vests he wore in the lab, in contrast to Loki\u2019s need to cover himself. His arms were sinewy and brown, pocked with small welding scars, and scars from many other terrible things as well. But his hands! Loki could be satisfied for a lifetime just watching the nimble fingers coax life out of electronics and breathe magic into circuitry.</p><p>Once, Tony had brushed his calloused fingers through Loki\u2019s hair, pushing it back behind his ear, and Loki had almost whimpered from the perfection, the need he\u2019d felt to press his cheek closer to Tony\u2019s palm, press kisses, breathe wonder and gratitude and\u2026 and maybe something more into his skin, fall to his knees and beg him to accept him.</p><p>But that was just it, wasn\u2019t it? Loki was\u2026 unacceptable. Loki was a Frost Giant. He told Tony - tried to convince himself - that it was a mistake, that he just needed to find himself a cure, and he\u2019d be back in his own body, his true, Aesir body. But he was beginning to realise that it was never going to happen. This body\u2026 this hated, hated flesh, it fit him. And Loki wanted to weep with it, to howl and break everything around him, because it felt so right. While his heart rebelled, recoiled at the disgusting blue skin, his very blood and guts knew it to be true.</p><p>Loki was a Frost Giant. And that meant that he was lucky to have anyone willing to be in the same room as him, let alone Tony\u2019s kindness, his wonderful friendship. The thought of demanding more of Tony, pushing him beyond the limits of his generosity, beyond the limits of his ability to look past his hideousness, was terrifying.</p><p>Sometimes he woke from dreams of his body pressed against Tony, arms wrapped around his back, or kisses pressed to his neck, tilting his chin to feel the beautiful tendons there against his lips. Sometimes he imagined fingers intertwined, imagined stroking through his hair, tracing the line of his beard with one fingertip, touching Tony\u2019s lips, or the delicate skin of his eyelids, while Tony tilted his face up in trust.</p><p>And then he remembered that his fingers were blue and cold, and tipped with knife-sharp, metal-strong black nails. And he dug those nails into the palms of his hated hands, because they were not made for touching something so precious as Tony Stark\u2019s perfect face.</p><p>\u201cLokes? You OK?\u201d Tony asked, looking over at him.</p><p>He blinked up at him and dropped his hands to his side, flickering a half smile. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Tony cocked his head on one side, a sadness drifting across his face. \u201cOK. Hey, uh\u2026 I had an idea, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d be up for it, but\u2026 you know I fell asleep on you the last time?\u201d</p><p>How could he forget? A smile grew over his lips unbidden. \u201cI remember waking you up because you were shivering from the cold,\u201d Loki said.</p><p>Tony chuckled. \u201cYeah, so\u2026 hence this.\u201d He held up a blanket, raising his eyebrows. \u201cDo you think you\u2019d be OK with me sticking a blanket around you so I can lean on you? I mean\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 heh, it\u2019s kinda dumb, never mind, I\u2019m not good with boundaries, sorry, it\u2019s&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent idea.\u201d Loki took it and draped it over his shoulders, his heart thundering. Tony\u2019s face lit up in a smile and he practically jumped onto the sofa next to Loki, snuggling right up to his shoulder. Loki\u2019s breath almost stopped. This was\u2026 this was so much. This was so close, so perfect. He closed his eyes in the beautiful, wonderful pain of having him so close. He could turn his face just the tiniest bit to the left and it would be pressed into Tony\u2019s hair. He could smell the warm, engine oil, work-sweat, aftershave scent of him and it seemed to work into his lungs and spread meltwater through his every vein. This would be the death of him, and he would be glad of it.</p><p><i>Tagging anyone who interacted with the last chapter - thank you! <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5TuWtAMbS2Cm_atvcT303w\">@friggvsxn</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjNKCZp8i5i9qVG6Rxsid2Q\">@livevilokikol</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxMvChqxOfxjDvNn62lC1yQ\">@workingai</a>, @numb-angel08, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVcxTi_wzXtTCRLFA_lunBQ\">@aformingsiren</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0LAxIAvSz0tag7znSMwVGA\">@deyoza</a>, @jacksnowsb, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mctcfsck03U1Le1yg8Hy_lA\">@senpaiweird</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXmiDAWzEdlexipT1XuilA\">@saturnjuice</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxaPcjMFT40D-ekeWQe1n8w\">@victoriagreenleaf</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEgLSeLMLZpEmNUx35CErtw\">@bblgumbby</a></i></p>",

Nothing happened, until in his frustration, frost started to form over the chair on which his other hand rested. He pushed it away in disgust.</p><p>Tony traced the patterns. \u201cI know this wasn\u2019t what you\u2019re going for, but I still think it\u2019s awesome. But for now, let\u2019s go upstairs and watch a movie, order pizza in, how about that?\u201d He patted Loki\u2019s shoulder, and Loki resisted the urge to lean into that touch, because he was not a pathetic, touch starved wretch.</p><p>Only perhaps he was, he thought, as he followed Tony into the elevator and up to the film room, listening to him chat non-stop, a fond smile fighting its way onto his lips. Or perhaps he was Tony-starved. For the gentle, simple affection that Tony handed out at every opportunity. For the bright, joyful smiles that accompanied success, and the swear words when he failed, for the mental leaps and the sparking of intellect, ideas linking across a void that no other would consider crossing.</p><p>He had not known it could <i>be</i> like this, that friendship, that <i>people</i> could be so wonderful. He had never wanted to be with anyone so much as he wanted to be with Tony, every moment of the day.</p><p>He rubbed his sternum over the top of the thin cotton fabric that Tony had bought for him when he first arrived weeks ago. Tony was generous, affectionate, kind, fantastically intelligent - and not even just <i>for a mortal</i>, but for any being. He was also the most beautiful sight Loki had ever seen.</p><p>He was nothing like the men and women Loki had been attracted to before - he was honestly nothing like any men on Asgard. He was small, his head would have fitted perfectly beneath Loki\u2019s chin should they embrace as lovers. His hair, dark brown and silvering at the temples, was coarser than his own, holding its shape when Tony ran his fingers through it, spiking it up in all directions, making Loki long to smooth it down, or even mess it up himself. His eyes were a deep, rich brown that invited Loki to stare into them, to lose himself, to test the limits of their gentle acceptance.</p><p>And his hands\u2026 Loki could watch him work all day if given the chance, watch the powerful muscles tense and bunch under the short sleeved vests he wore in the lab, in contrast to Loki\u2019s need to cover himself. His arms were sinewy and brown, pocked with small welding scars, and scars from many other terrible things as well. But his hands! Loki could be satisfied for a lifetime just watching the nimble fingers coax life out of electronics and breathe magic into circuitry.</p><p>Once, Tony had brushed his calloused fingers through Loki\u2019s hair, pushing it back behind his ear, and Loki had almost whimpered from the perfection, the need he\u2019d felt to press his cheek closer to Tony\u2019s palm, press kisses, breathe wonder and gratitude and\u2026 and maybe something more into his skin, fall to his knees and beg him to accept him.</p><p>But that was just it, wasn\u2019t it? Loki was\u2026 unacceptable. Loki was a Frost Giant. He told Tony - tried to convince himself - that it was a mistake, that he just needed to find himself a cure, and he\u2019d be back in his own body, his true, Aesir body. But he was beginning to realise that it was never going to happen. This body\u2026 this hated, hated flesh, it fit him. And Loki wanted to weep with it, to howl and break everything around him, because it felt so right. While his heart rebelled, recoiled at the disgusting blue skin, his very blood and guts knew it to be true.</p><p>Loki was a Frost Giant. And that meant that he was lucky to have anyone willing to be in the same room as him, let alone Tony\u2019s kindness, his wonderful friendship. The thought of demanding more of Tony, pushing him beyond the limits of his generosity, beyond the limits of his ability to look past his hideousness, was terrifying.</p><p>Sometimes he woke from dreams of his body pressed against Tony, arms wrapped around his back, or kisses pressed to his neck, tilting his chin to feel the beautiful tendons there against his lips. Sometimes he imagined fingers intertwined, imagined stroking through his hair, tracing the line of his beard with one fingertip, touching Tony\u2019s lips, or the delicate skin of his eyelids, while Tony tilted his face up in trust.</p><p>And then he remembered that his fingers were blue and cold, and tipped with knife-sharp, metal-strong black nails. And he dug those nails into the palms of his hated hands, because they were not made for touching something so precious as Tony Stark\u2019s perfect face.</p><p>\u201cLokes? You OK?\u201d Tony asked, looking over at him.</p><p>He blinked up at him and dropped his hands to his side, flickering a half smile. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Tony cocked his head on one side, a sadness drifting across his face. \u201cOK. Hey, uh\u2026 I had an idea, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d be up for it, but\u2026 you know I fell asleep on you the last time?\u201d</p><p>How could he forget? A smile grew over his lips unbidden. \u201cI remember waking you up because you were shivering from the cold,\u201d Loki said.</p><p>Tony chuckled. \u201cYeah, so\u2026 hence this.\u201d He held up a blanket, raising his eyebrows. \u201cDo you think you\u2019d be OK with me sticking a blanket around you so I can lean on you? I mean\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 heh, it\u2019s kinda dumb, never mind, I\u2019m not good with boundaries, sorry, it\u2019s\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent idea.\u201d Loki took it and draped it over his shoulders, his heart thundering. Tony\u2019s face lit up in a smile and he practically jumped onto the sofa next to Loki, snuggling right up to his shoulder. Loki\u2019s breath almost stopped. This was\u2026 this was so much. This was so close, so perfect. He closed his eyes in the beautiful, wonderful pain of having him so close. He could turn his face just the tiniest bit to the left and it would be pressed into Tony\u2019s hair. He could smell the warm, engine oil, work-sweat, aftershave scent of him and it seemed to work into his lungs and spread meltwater through his every vein. This would be the death of him, and he would be glad of it.</p><p><i>Tagging anyone who interacted with the last chapter - thank you! <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5TuWtAMbS2Cm_atvcT303w\">@friggvsxn</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjNKCZp8i5i9qVG6Rxsid2Q\">@livevilokikol</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxMvChqxOfxjDvNn62lC1yQ\">@workingai</a>, @numb-angel08, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVcxTi_wzXtTCRLFA_lunBQ\">@aformingsiren</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0LAxIAvSz0tag7znSMwVGA\">@deyoza</a>, @jacksnowsb, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mctcfsck03U1Le1yg8Hy_lA\">@senpaiweird</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXmiDAWzEdlexipT1XuilA\">@saturnjuice</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxaPcjMFT40D-ekeWQe1n8w\">@victoriagreenleaf</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEgLSeLMLZpEmNUx35CErtw\">@bblgumbby</a></i></p>",

Because making me watch a film about Peter Parker and his feelings about Tony\u2019s death? No. I just&hellip; nope.\u00a0</p><p>But more than that, there\u2019s going to be this pressure on the character to live up to Tony\u2019s memory/expectations and not only is that deeply unfair, it\u2019s not possible and here is why I thought it was foolish to kill Tony Stark.\u00a0</p><p>Tony was the only character (aside from T\u2019challa, who heroes as part of reigning. but that\u2019s a whole different relationship with superheroing) who contributes so much outside of his hero role. While trying to think of other superheroes giving back in ways that don\u2019t feature powers it\u2019s always just a moment between adventures or a reference to a hobby they may have. The MCU gives people what they want, costumed heroes saving the world, but Tony Stark was the only one doing more without the suit on. The others are only there to save the world. They\u2019re not improving it while the suits are off.\u00a0</p><p>Not to say Steve isn\u2019t helping old ladies cross the road. And Sam was one character I considered as a social contributor when pondering it, until I realised we haven\u2019t really heard much of his therapy work since he got the wings on again. Nat did some of her best work once half humanity was dead in her super-management role. But in the MCU, Tony Stark is basically their worldbuilder. Everyone knows who he is for the things he\u2019d made and even if he\u2019d never admitted to being Iron Man, they would know him and his other contributions anyway.</p><p>No other character in the MCU has been given this. Any one of them can capably step into Iron Man\u2019s shoes and save the world, but we haven\u2019t been given any sign that someone can step into Tony Stark\u2019s shoes and continue impacting the world (for better or worse) once the monthly threat to world peace is over. The time for Tony to train such a successor would have been in movies prior to Endgame, where the Russos thought that making people feel really sad was a good stand-in for nuanced story-telling.\u00a0</p>",
