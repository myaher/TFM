        "answer": "<p>That\u2019s a really good question, my friend! Personally, the answer is yes, but at the same time, I also have a habit of being hard on myself. When I look at old stories and re-read old works, I usually do cringe and see parts that I could have structured better, sentences I should have re-phrased, sections that, honestly, make me embarrassed that I wrote them.\u00a0</p><p>However, I think it\u2019s also very important to remember that the reason why you feel this way is because you\u2019ve grown as a writer in the time that\u2019s passed. I say now that\u00a0\u201cI could have done better,\u201d but at the time, I was as proud as I could be of the work I did. Stories like <i>In the Moments </i>and <i>Rogue, </i>even the first 10 chapters of\u00a0<i>Something New,</i>\u00a0are over half a year old now, and I can\u2019t really look at them anymore without thinking\u00a0\u201coh man, I <i>really </i>gotta re-write this.\u201d But they are also pieces I worked incredibly hard on, and poured a lot of my soul into, and that I still care deeply about. The fact that I cringe when I read them, only means I\u2019ve grown up more as an author. I\u2019m afraid some people will think my skill level is lower than it is, solely because they are reading old works. But what you should try to remember, and what I always believe, is that more importantly than anything, what you did in the past is only a <i>piece </i>of what you can do. And the inspiration and progress and lessons you\u2019ve earned today all come from old things that might be\u00a0\u201cembarrassing,\u201d but are really just stepping stones and marks of accomplishment that you\u2019ve made in your journey to become a skilled writer and an incredible storyteller!</p>",

And that&rsquo;s always worth something.</p><p>&ldquo;You could say that,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p><p>He smiles. He&rsquo;s an orc, Nott thinks, or a half-orc, or some other big scary race that could crush her between his fingers without batting an eye, but she&rsquo;s not scared of him. Not really. Then again, her throat is still warm from the last drops of liquor she drained only a few minutes back, and the ocean of it she poured out for herself earlier on in the day crashes sluggishly in her stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sea man,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;All sea men have had some experience with drowning before.&rdquo;</p><p>Nott giggles.

I don&rsquo;t see&ndash; oh.&rdquo; He makes a face as the joke sets in, and Nott can&rsquo;t help but laugh. He&rsquo;s a nice man, this sea man. Shame it&rsquo;ll be him who brings her to her second doom.</p><p>The man, as if hearing her thoughts, abruptly leans in, and Nott&rsquo;s laugh hitches in her throat. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he says, and his voice is even, measured out in coffee spoons, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what your business was near these here ships, but&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was hungry,&rdquo; Nott interrupts, and it&rsquo;s not a lie, not completely. &ldquo;I was ever so hungry, and there was nothing to eat, and no one would give me some coin, and I thought maybe your ship would have some sort of&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>The man holds up a finger, and she falls silent. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t done,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Now, while I don&rsquo;t know what your business was near these here ships when I caught you&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>(She wanted to leave.

But from the moment the law doesn&rsquo;t respect us&hellip; well, then we get to uproot it and sow a new law to respect. Laws are for people, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nott croaks. The law was actually never for people like her, but she can&rsquo;t tell him that. Especially not now. </p><p>He nods, pleased at her response. &ldquo;Right. Laws are for people. People aren&rsquo;t for laws. It&rsquo;s up to us to decide if the law is fair and serving us well, and if it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s up to us to change it.&rdquo;</p><p>He leans in again, and his eyes are so bright and earnest it makes Nott&rsquo;s heart pang. She knows that look. She knows it well. It&rsquo;s the look of people still trusting in the future, the look of people who still think the world is theirs to shape. Her husband wore that look sometimes when it was late at night and he was finally reaching a breakthrough in his work. </p><p>&ldquo;And frankly, miss, any law that&rsquo;ll have your head in its name is a law I reckon needs amending.&rdquo;</p><p>Nott wants to tell him that every law wants her head in its name, and that frankly she doesn&rsquo;t even blame it, but she bites her tongue. This is an gateway. This is a way out. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she says. The words taste like ash on her lips. &ldquo;So\u2026 you&rsquo;ll talk to them, then? Your crew?\u201d</p><p>He winces. \u201cWell\u2026 they&rsquo;re not my crew. Not exactly. I just work for them. Move luggage and the likes.\u201d</p><p>Nott eyes his clothes, worn down and ragged. She eyes his hair, tousled with water and sea salt. She eyes his lips, pressed together firmly. And she knows he&rsquo;s not lying, but he&rsquo;s definitely not telling the truth either.</p><p>She lets it drop.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat are you going to do, then?\u201d</p><p>The man sighs. \u201cThat&rsquo;s a damn fine question. For now, I think I&rsquo;ll introduce myself.\u201d</p><p>He extends a hand, and Nott instinctively flinches back before she realizes it&rsquo;s just a handshake. His hand is bigger than her face. Way bigger. She has to use both her hands to shake it.</p><p>He smiles at her. He has a nice smile. Small. \u201cFjord,\u201d he says. </p><p>\u201cNott,\u201d she replies. \u201cNott the Brave. No comma.\u201d</p><p>He stands up, and Nott&rsquo;s eyes follow him as he strides to the door of the cabin she&rsquo;s locked in, places his hand on the handle and mumbles something under his breath. The door clicks open, and her heart catches in her chest.</p><p>\u201cMagic,\u201d she blurts. \u201cYou&rsquo;re magic?\u201d</p><p>He gives her a curious look, but doesn&rsquo;t answer. \u201cKeep your eyes peeled, Nott the Brave,\u201d he says. \u201cTonight&rsquo;s the night we break you out.\u201d</p><p>Nott nods. Her eyes are still fixed on the handle, on that stupid lock she&rsquo;d tried to pick dozens of times before Fjord showed up but that he managed to unlock with a single word. Magic. He&rsquo;s magic.</p><p>And he&rsquo;s on her side.</p><p>The door closes, and Nott slumps against the chair she&rsquo;s sitting on, grimacing a bit as she hits wood.</p><p>She&rsquo;s not an optimist. Not really. But as she looks around at the four blank walls confining her, and tries not to think of the ocean rocking beneath her feet, she can&rsquo;t help but feel, if for a moment, a prick of something she hasn&rsquo;t felt in a very long time.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>Maybe, she thinks, she can leave the water with at least one good memory fastened to its waves.</p><p>Maybe she can almost pretend someone cares.</p>",

Nott laughs if she thinks about it too much. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to drown me,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make me\u2013 what\u2019s the name\u2013 walk the plank.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a guess, but the man across from her instantly winces, and she knows she\u2019s right. She doesn\u2019t panic. She laughs, and goes to take a swig from her flask\u2013 then laughs some more when she remembers it\u2019s empty.</p><p>\u201cThis is fine,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is absolutely great, actually, this is lovely, drowning is one of my favorite things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad much experience with it?\u201d the man asks. It\u2019s a feeble attempt at humor, soured if Nott thinks about it too much, but she latches onto it anyway. He\u2019s trying, at least. And that\u2019s always worth something.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d she says. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>He smiles. He\u2019s an orc, Nott thinks, or a half-orc, or some other big scary race that could crush her between his fingers without batting an eye, but she\u2019s not scared of him. Not really. Then again, her throat is still warm from the last drops of liquor she drained only a few minutes back, and the ocean of it she poured out for herself earlier on in the day crashes sluggishly in her stomach. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sea man,\u201d he says. \u201cAll sea men have had some experience with drowning before.\u201d</p><p>Nott giggles. It\u2019s a little hysteric. \u201cA sea man? You\u2019re a sea man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He\u2019s defensive now, eyes narrowing as he tries to figure out what\u2019s so funny. \u201cBeen a sea man a good while now. I don\u2019t see\u2013 oh.\u201d He makes a face as the joke sets in, and Nott can\u2019t help but laugh. He\u2019s a nice man, this sea man. Shame it\u2019ll be him who brings her to her second doom.</p><p>The man, as if hearing her thoughts, abruptly leans in, and Nott\u2019s laugh hitches in her throat. \u201cLook,\u201d he says, and his voice is even, measured out in coffee spoons, \u201cI don\u2019t know what your business was near these here ships, but\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hungry,\u201d Nott interrupts, and it\u2019s not a lie, not completely. \u201cI was ever so hungry, and there was nothing to eat, and no one would give me some coin, and I thought maybe your ship would have some sort of\u2013\u201d</p><p>The man holds up a finger, and she falls silent. \u201cI wasn\u2019t done,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, while I don\u2019t know what your business was near these here ships when I caught you\u2013\u201d</p><p>(She wanted to leave. She wanted to leave, and punish herself in the worst way while doing so. Normal people, good people, leave by carriage or cart or train. People like Nott leave by ship.)</p><p>\u201c\u2013and while I definitely disapprove of you rooting through our ship\u2019s supplies, as they aren\u2019t yours to root through\u2013\u201d</p><p>(She was thirsty. Thirsty, and hungry, and jittery. She thought she could kill two birds with one stone: get the liquor, and get onboard for free. She didn\u2019t know just how harsh the law of the sea could be.)</p><p>\u201c\u2013I also don\u2019t think you deserve to die for it.\u201d</p><p>(What?)</p><p>She blinks at him, and he sighs, like he too can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s saying. \u201cThe law\u2019s the law,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we need to respect the law. But from the moment the law doesn\u2019t respect us\u2026 well, then we get to uproot it and sow a new law to respect. Laws are for people, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nott croaks. The law was actually never for people like her, but she can\u2019t tell him that. Especially not now. </p><p>He nods, pleased at her response. \u201cRight. Laws are for people. People aren\u2019t for laws. It\u2019s up to us to decide if the law is fair and serving us well, and if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s up to us to change it.\u201d</p><p>He leans in again, and his eyes are so bright and earnest it makes Nott\u2019s heart pang. She knows that look. She knows it well. It\u2019s the look of people still trusting in the future, the look of people who still think the world is theirs to shape. Her husband wore that look sometimes when it was late at night and he was finally reaching a breakthrough in his work. </p><p>\u201cAnd frankly, miss, any law that\u2019ll have your head in its name is a law I reckon needs amending.\u201d</p><p>Nott wants to tell him that every law wants her head in its name, and that frankly she doesn\u2019t even blame it, but she bites her tongue.

If you could&hellip;.\u201d She shuffled her hands over themselves, as if momentarily tempted to head out there herself, but then she looked back down at Caleb and her posture softened, and Caduceus knew there was no way she was going to leave her boy alone. She had a good heart. \u201cLook, here\u2019s some gold, could you go see if they\u2019ve got any books Caleb would want?\u201d</p><p>Caduceus took the bag of coins Nott gave him. It felt heavy. <br/></p><p>Heading out of the inn with a wave to Fjord and Jester and a sideways word to Beau, just to let her know where he was going, Caduceus stepped onto the street of the hamlet and made his way across the crossroad intersection to the small bookshop. <br/></p><p>It was a lovely quaint little place, and when Caduceus stepped inside he could feel the smell of old book pages, dust, musk, aged leather, and petunias, all wafting over him. There were bundles of the flowers hanging from baskets, all dotted around the shop. He had to stoop underneath them to avoid accidentally knocking his head on them, although he apologised in advance just in case he did make a mistake. He waved in polite greeting to the aged gnome man sat behind the counter, before starting to make a scan of the bookshop.</p><p>There were a lot of books, mostly on things Caduceus didn\u2019t know about. He pulled out books with flowers, mushrooms, crystals, graveyards on the cover. But Caleb didn\u2019t like flowers or mushrooms or graves, he liked other things. Caduceus had seen that in the avid reading he did in inn rooms, hidden in tavern booths, or sat on the back of the cart. He preferred books of a wide variety, discussions of the arcane or books with people kissing on the cover. Well, Caduceus knew which one <i>he\u2019d</i> prefer, even if he didn\u2019t understand it too well. <br/></p><p>He searched, and he flicked books over to examine the cover before putting them back, and he placed one into the crook of his arm. Appeased with his careful selection, Caduceus returned to the bookshop keeper and placed the books down on the counter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be all?\u201d, the gnome asked him.</p><p>\u201cI believe so\u201d, Caduceus replied. He could always come back later, but he wasn\u2019t quite sure. The gnome examined the slelcted book, his eyebrows slowly going higher.</p><p>\u201cSo&hellip;.you interested in arcana and romantic novels? It\u2019s an interesting combination, not a lot of readers out there for that niche\u201d, the gnome asked. <br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Oh no, you misunderstand. I have a friend who is looking for this book and I want to surprise them</i>\u201d, Caduceus said quickly. Well, Caleb wasn\u2019t really looking for this exact book, but he was looking for arcane and romantic books. This seemed to tick both boxes. The gnome seemed impressed as well, and a little more than that too. <br/></p><p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s what tickles his, her, or their fancy\u201d, he said. \u201cFive gold please.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus handed over the bag. The gnome stared at it before reaching in and withdrawing five gold pieces. Caduceus took the rest of the bag back.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou absolutely sure you don\u2019t want more books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite positively. Have a nice day.\u201d Waving politely to the gnome and the petunias, Caduceus crossed back over the street to the general store. Sadly, there was no ginger to be found. There were however a few sprigs of mint growing in the shade next to the store, and so Caduceus plucked those up for Caleb. Ginger and mint could be equally beneficial in soothing a cold.</p><p>Returning to Caleb\u2019s room found Nott asleep on Caleb\u2019s legs and the wizard vaguely coherent, eyes blinking over towards movement at the door. Caduceus set a mug of steaming tea, firmly flavoured with the mint leaves, and the purchased book down beside him on the bedside table. <br/></p><p>\u201cEnjoy them both\u201d, he told Caleb. \u201cAnd take your time to rest up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not like I have the ability to do much else\u201d, Caleb replied, and Caduceus had to slowly nod his agreement.

There were bundles of the flowers hanging from baskets, all dotted around the shop. He had to stoop underneath them to avoid accidentally knocking his head on them, although he apologised in advance just in case he did make a mistake. He waved in polite greeting to the aged gnome man sat behind the counter, before starting to make a scan of the bookshop.</p><p>There were a lot of books, mostly on things Caduceus didn&rsquo;t know about. He pulled out books with flowers, mushrooms, crystals, graveyards on the cover. But Caleb didn&rsquo;t like flowers or mushrooms or graves, he liked other things. Caduceus had seen that in the avid reading he did in inn rooms, hidden in tavern booths, or sat on the back of the cart. He preferred books of a wide variety, discussions of the arcane or books with people kissing on the cover. Well, Caduceus knew which one <i>he&rsquo;d</i> prefer, even if he didn&rsquo;t understand it too well. <br /></p><p>He searched, and he flicked books over to examine the cover before putting them back, and he placed one into the crook of his arm. Appeased with his careful selection, Caduceus returned to the bookshop keeper and placed the books down on the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be all?&rdquo;, the gnome asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe so&rdquo;, Caduceus replied. He could always come back later, but he wasn&rsquo;t quite sure. The gnome examined the slelcted book, his eyebrows slowly going higher.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;.you interested in arcana and romantic novels? It&rsquo;s an interesting combination, not a lot of readers out there for that niche&rdquo;, the gnome asked. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Oh no, you misunderstand. I have a friend who is looking for this book and I want to surprise them</i>&rdquo;, Caduceus said quickly. Well, Caleb wasn&rsquo;t really looking for this exact book, but he was looking for arcane and romantic books. This seemed to tick both boxes. The gnome seemed impressed as well, and a little more than that too. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s what tickles his, her, or their fancy&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;Five gold please.&rdquo;</p><p>Caduceus handed over the bag. The gnome stared at it before reaching in and withdrawing five gold pieces. Caduceus took the rest of the bag back.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You absolutely sure you don&rsquo;t want more books.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Quite positively. Have a nice day.&rdquo; Waving politely to the gnome and the petunias, Caduceus crossed back over the street to the general store. Sadly, there was no ginger to be found. There were however a few sprigs of mint growing in the shade next to the store, and so Caduceus plucked those up for Caleb. Ginger and mint could be equally beneficial in soothing a cold.</p><p>Returning to Caleb&rsquo;s room found Nott asleep on Caleb&rsquo;s legs and the wizard vaguely coherent, eyes blinking over towards movement at the door. Caduceus set a mug of steaming tea, firmly flavoured with the mint leaves, and the purchased book down beside him on the bedside table. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Enjoy them both&rdquo;, he told Caleb. &ldquo;And take your time to rest up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is not like I have the ability to do much else&rdquo;, Caleb replied, and Caduceus had to slowly nod his agreement. Touching his shoulder, a small motion of comfort, and Caduceus left the inn room to the privacy of mother and son. <br /></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWNcva_WxV8bo6UWs_VOGfw\">@criticalprompts</a> <br /></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Tyrwinden was an excellent little hamlet for travelers to stop into on the way to their next destination - caught at the centre of a crossroads and yet remaining amicably small, beyond an inn, a general goods store, and a bookshop.</p>\n<p>It was a perfect little place for an avid reader and wizard.</p>\n<p>Such a shame then, Caduceus thought to himself as he lifted the prone body out of the cart, that Caleb had been absolutely flattened by a common cold. He&rsquo;d managed to catch it after a prank went wrong next to a river, and he still hadn&rsquo;t progressed much beyond shivering, high temperature and constant sneezing. No wonder it&rsquo;d been unanimously agreed for him to take bed rest until he recovered.</p>\n<p>Once Fjord had booked them rooms at the inn, amongst a background of well-mannered chatter, Caduceus carried Caleb upstairs to one of the rooms and set him out on the bed. Nott was close by, always close by, she&rsquo;d been keeping him warm and sipping on a waterskein throughout this whole business. Either this had happened before with the two of them or Nott was quite used to looking after people with colds. Neither option would&rsquo;ve particularly surprised Caduceus by this point.</p>\n</p>",

        "excerpt": "Critical Role is a live Dungeons & Dragons show featuring Dungeon Master Matthew Mercer and his troupe of fellow voice actors. Catch them every Thursday night at 7:00 PM PT on the Geek & Sundry Twitch channel and on Alpha. Episode 44, \"The Diver's Grave,\" gave Critters one of the best surprises of this Critical Role campaign with a brand new animated opening! The anime-inspired opening credits featured a brand new song, jaw-dropping character and background design, and more hidden details than you might expect. Kami Areopagita, whom you may remember us chatting with earlier this year about the unforgettable D&D Beyond animated ad, is graciously back again to share some of those details you may have missed even in your repeat viewings. The song is written and performed by your favorite nerdy-ass voice actors. Sam Riegel wrote the lyrics (have you memorized them yet?), and you'll hear Sam and Travis Willingham as background vocals in the first moments of the opening. Most",
