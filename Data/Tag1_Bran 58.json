The scenery and the battle and the picture and music in this episode was excellent. Now into the feelings</p><p>- First the ending : Did I expected the Night King to be killed into this episode. Honestly no I thought that the war between the living and the dead to last two episode but I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed because this ending though !!! My girl Arya did it !!!!!! I didn\u2019t expected that she would be the one to kill the Night King. But when I think about it it\u2019s totally logical I mean she\u2019s a trained assassin she was one of the people who had a chance to do it and seeing her winning the war, killing the enemy that we know and fear for 8 seasons was great. Her character growth is one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen or read and it was great. Her scenes in the library, her chase in Winterfell, the fact that the Hound saved her. And Melisandre prophecy when they meet again and the tribute to Sirio</p><p>- Sansa and Tyrion in the crypts: let\u2019s be honest we all see coming the fact that choosing a place with dead people to hide the people of Winterfell when the enemy can bring back the dead wasn\u2019t the best idea. Anyway. I honestly didn\u2019t saw coming the talk between Tyrion and Sansa, I mean it had a particular vibe about it I didn&rsquo;t expected between them. Side thing : I actually appreciated Missandei coming at Sansa when she talked about Daenerys, in the aspect that it\u2019s true she came with two dragons and two armies. But I\u2019m not one of those persons who wants to confronts them to each other I simply liked the show of friendship and loyalty Missandei show toward Dany. I think that Sansa was actually brace to stay in the crypt, she knows she\u2019s not a fighter, that she may have a chance to help her people in the crypt but not in the battlefield and her will to pick up the knife that Arya gave her to kill the Wrights that were here was also quite brave.\u00a0</p><p>- Dany and Jon : They fight Targaryen style with their dragons and some of the amazing shots came from these scenes in my opinion. They help a lot. I mean they burn thousands of Wrights and they give us light and they fight the Night King, who with Viseryon was kind of hard to fight for other soldiers. I also loved that this episode show the side of Dany and Jon we\u2019ve seen in previous seasons. John is this hero who wants to fight everyone at the same time and who is sometimes a bit reckless. And Dany is the fair queen we\u2019ve seen when she was at Esso. She wants to ride Dragon as soon as she sees that the Dothraki are losing, in part to venge them I believe. Her armies are in fact in the first line. She doesn\u2019t try to kill Jon during the battle or even left him to die or anything she actually save him. To be honest I was a bit afraid that she would hesitate but I\u2019m more than happy to see they didn\u2019t get through that road. She picks up a sword even if she doesn\u2019t know how to fight and I love a queen without survival instinct and a warrior spirit. I stan a couple that fight a war together</p><p>- Now the deaths\u00a0</p><p>I cried for Jorah and Lyanna : Jorah has been with us since the beginning and with Dany. He was loyal to no end and was also kind of the king of the friendzone but he was a likable character, wise and with a positive influence over Dany. I love Lyanna because she was badass, she wasn\u2019t afraid to say what she was thinking and she was a warrior, she fought side by side with her army and her last act was to take down a freaking giant. We stan</p><p>Beric and Ed were also heartbreaking : Beric because we learn that he was brought back to live time and time again so he could save Arya during this battle. Ed was part of the Night Watch, he\u2019s been friends with John and Sam forever and seeing him die during this episode was heartbreaking.</p><p>I was actually sad for Melisandre, she was awful but let\u2019s be honest she save them during the battle with her magic and same with been with her for so long\u00a0</p><p>Edit : Theon my boy !!!!

Sure\u00a0</p><p>This episode didn\u2019t disappointed me at all. The scenery and the battle and the picture and music in this episode was excellent. Now into the feelings</p><p>- First the ending : Did I expected the Night King to be killed into this episode. Honestly no I thought that the war between the living and the dead to last two episode but I wasn\u2019t disappointed because this ending though !!! My girl Arya did it !!!!!! I didn\u2019t expected that she would be the one to kill the Night King. But when I think about it it\u2019s totally logical I mean she\u2019s a trained assassin she was one of the people who had a chance to do it and seeing her winning the war, killing the enemy that we know and fear for 8 seasons was great. Her character growth is one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen or read and it was great. Her scenes in the library, her chase in Winterfell, the fact that the Hound saved her. And Melisandre prophecy when they meet again and the tribute to Sirio</p><p>- Sansa and Tyrion in the crypts: let\u2019s be honest we all see coming the fact that choosing a place with dead people to hide the people of Winterfell when the enemy can bring back the dead wasn\u2019t the best idea. Anyway. I honestly didn\u2019t saw coming the talk between Tyrion and Sansa, I mean it had a particular vibe about it I didn\u2019t expected between them. Side thing : I actually appreciated Missandei coming at Sansa when she talked about Daenerys, in the aspect that it\u2019s true she came with two dragons and two armies. But I\u2019m not one of those persons who wants to confronts them to each other I simply liked the show of friendship and loyalty Missandei show toward Dany. I think that Sansa was actually brace to stay in the crypt, she knows she\u2019s not a fighter, that she may have a chance to help her people in the crypt but not in the battlefield and her will to pick up the knife that Arya gave her to kill the Wrights that were here was also quite brave.\u00a0</p><p>- Dany and Jon : They fight Targaryen style with their dragons and some of the amazing shots came from these scenes in my opinion. They help a lot. I mean they burn thousands of Wrights and they give us light and they fight the Night King, who with Viseryon was kind of hard to fight for other soldiers. I also loved that this episode show the side of Dany and Jon we\u2019ve seen in previous seasons. John is this hero who wants to fight everyone at the same time and who is sometimes a bit reckless. And Dany is the fair queen we\u2019ve seen when she was at Esso. She wants to ride Dragon as soon as she sees that the Dothraki are losing, in part to venge them I believe. Her armies are in fact in the first line. She doesn\u2019t try to kill Jon during the battle or even left him to die or anything she actually save him. To be honest I was a bit afraid that she would hesitate but I\u2019m more than happy to see they didn\u2019t get through that road. She picks up a sword even if she doesn\u2019t know how to fight and I love a queen without survival instinct and a warrior spirit. I stan a couple that fight a war together</p><p>- Now the deaths\u00a0</p><p>I cried for Jorah and Lyanna : Jorah has been with us since the beginning and with Dany. He was loyal to no end and was also kind of the king of the friendzone but he was a likable character, wise and with a positive influence over Dany. I love Lyanna because she was badass, she wasn\u2019t afraid to say what she was thinking and she was a warrior, she fought side by side with her army and her last act was to take down a freaking giant. We stan</p><p>Beric and Ed were also heartbreaking : Beric because we learn that he was brought back to live time and time again so he could save Arya during this battle. Ed was part of the Night Watch, he\u2019s been friends with John and Sam forever and seeing him die during this episode was heartbreaking.</p><p>I was actually sad for Melisandre, she was awful but let\u2019s be honest she save them during the battle with her magic and same with been with her for so long\u00a0</p><p>Edit : Theon my boy !!!!

It&rsquo;s in this exact moment&nbsp; that the Night King realizes that the wights are unable to make it over Winterfell&rsquo;s walls due to the fiery trenches, so the Night King remedies this by making some wights fall onto the fire to make bridges for other wights to cross over.</p><p>The important detail here is that Bran&rsquo;s ravens surround the Night King, <b>and the NK does not seem bothered at all by their presence</b>, coupled with the fact that the NK only gets his solution for the wights to cross over the trenches <b>after </b>Bran&rsquo;s ravens surround him.&nbsp;</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s go back to episode 5 of season 7, Eastwatch:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/55b72a140322beb92b4331d8af4b0b0c/tumblr_inline_pqu4qepzwH1qh4qwy_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ba3aba96c1117f450ee4d7cc217e774/tumblr_inline_pqu4pwvWdZ1qh4qwy_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0fd25c94f647e88b19728f35db776d1/tumblr_inline_pqu4tcgetE1qh4qwy_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Bran Wargs into the ravens and fly north of the Wall.

Instead, they simply fly towards him and he suddenly raises his hand to make the wights start invading Winterfell.</p><h2><b>Why does the Night King stop Bran&rsquo;s ravens in season 7, episode 5&hellip;. but not during the most important fight of the Night King&rsquo;s existence?&nbsp;</b></h2><p>Surely if Bran was doing that to spy on the Night King and then tell the others where he was, the Night King would have stopped Bran. But he doesn&rsquo;t. Instead, we see the Night King suddenly intervene with the defense of Winterfell after ignoring Bran&rsquo;s ravens.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve said it once, and I&rsquo;ll say it again&hellip; <b>something is not right</b>.</p>",
