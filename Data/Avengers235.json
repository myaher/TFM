You did that. You travelled\nto a different universe and helped superheroes. You were definitely getting a\nlot better, and with the next movies making their appearances, Infinity War\nstarting to approach, you decided to pay a visit- not because of a fight, but\nmore of to just say hello.</p><!-- more --><p>However, this time you didn\u2019t have an exact reason for\nwanting to go, and therefore the spell refused to work, so you just started\nmuttering random desires you would like to do at the wall in Latin, pushing,\nand hoping to not literally hit a brick wall. </p><p>Stealing the Shield didn\u2019t work. </p><p>Neither did getting knighted as an Avenger\u2026 to be fair, Tony\nprobably wouldn\u2019t knight you after your run in. So you decided to try something\nstupid. </p><p><i>\u201cI want to get Bucky\nand Wanda together.\u201d </i>You admitted to the wall in your attic, and pushed,\nnearly tumbling forward as the wall disappeared. You squeezed your eyes shut,\npractically tripping all the way through the portal till you reached the other\nside, and falling over. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that worked out of all the requests\u2026\u201d\nYou muttered, getting up and dusting your knees off, until you heard something\u2026\nturning on\u2026 probably a weapon\u2026 turning your head to the side and looking up,\nyou saw Shuri pointing one of her gauntlets at you, and you realised where you\nwere. </p><p>\u201cWho are you, and how did you do that?\u201d She asked you,\nnodding her head to the now bare wall. You raised your hands in surrender. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I\u2019m a witch and Steve and Bucky know me. I helped\nthem escape.\u201d You explained quickly. The names of the superheroes made her back\naway a little, giving you a little space. </p><p>\u201cYou are to stay there with your hands were I can see them\nwhile I call my brother.\u201d She ordered, rushing over to her desk. It wasn\u2019t long\ntill the Dora Milaje came rushing down with T\u2019Challa. He of course recognised\nyou as the kid who was at the airport who disappeared with Bucky and Steve, and\nhe gestured to his side. The Dora Milaje parted, and Steve came though,\nsurprised to see you, and you gave a cheeky smile. </p><p>\u201cHey Steve.\u201d You greeted. Steve looked back at the king,\nbefore looking back at you, motioning you to stand up. You did as told, and he\ntook your arm, guiding you away. \u201cSorry for causing a bit of a scene, but I\ndon\u2019t really have control over where the spell decides to drop me.\u201d You\napologised to him, surprised at the little chuckle you got from him in\nresponse. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry kid. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay. I think Bucky\nwill be to when he sees you. After you paralysed Tony you vanished and Tony\nsaid you went through some sort of panel, and we didn\u2019t know what happened to\nyou after that.\u201d He explained. It was understandable they\u2019d be worried about\nyou- you helped them without them actually knowing you and then disappeared.\nYou knew you should have explained to them better that you\u2019d have to go home at\nsome point, and paralysing Tony and then disappearing before he could actually\nkick your skull in was your plan. </p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t really much I could have helped with past that\npoint and\u2026 I had school the next day.\u201d You admitted, which only made him\nchuckle more. \u201c\u2026Was everything okay after I left?\u201d You asked. You worried that\nyou\u2019d messed up their universe too much and you\u2019d actually damaged beyond\nrepair, but that thought was always pushed to the side. But now if you had\nmessed up, you were about to face the music. </p><p>\u201cActually\u2026 things are pretty good. Tony\u2019s doesn\u2019t contact us\na lot, but Rhodey somehow didn\u2019t lose his ability to walk\u2026 guess that has\nsomething to do with you?\u201d Your proud smile answered his question. \u201cAnd things\nare pretty calm now\u2026 but with you here I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve come to warn us or\nsomething?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cActually no. It\u2019s summer break and one of the big movies is\ncoming up and\u2026 I just wanted to say hi really. Check how you guys are\u2026 How\u2019s\nWanda?\u201d You asked, remembering the request of the spell, knowing the spell\nwon\u2019t work till it was accomplished\u2026 and you were starting to realise how big a\ntask it actually was. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine\u2026 Her and Vision aren\u2019t seeing each other\nanymore, it wasn\u2019t working but they\u2019re friends still. She\u2019s settled in pretty\nwell here with me, Buck and Nat.\u201d He told you, and he saw the smile on your\nface. \u201cOkay, why are you really here?\u201d He asked, stopping you in the hallway. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 well I did want to check on you guys and to just say\nhello, but since the spell doesn\u2019t work without a proper reason, I was just saying\nstuff and now it probably won\u2019t let me back till I complete said task and- I\nmay have set the task to get Bucky and Wanda together.\u201d You explained quickly\nto him, seeing the shock set in his face, and then turn into pleasant humour. </p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ve gotten you a head start- I\u2019ve been busy trying\nto patch things up with Tony and Nat\u2019s been coming along, so they\u2019ve been alone\nfor a lot and have been getting on pretty well.\u201d He told you. </p><p>Steve led you out the building and through the bustling city\nwhile you caught up on anything you missed out on between movies as you headed\nto a more desolate location till you could see a small home, and a familiar man\nworking outside it, conversing with another familiar face. Both soon heard you\napproaching, and turned to see you, looking surprised at the appearance of you.</p><p>\u201cY/N? What are you doing here?\u201d Wanda asked. </p><p>\u201cJust came to say hi and to let you guys know I\u2019m okay and\nto make sure you\u2019re doing okay\u2026 don\u2019t worry, I haven\u2019t come to warn you about\nsomething\u2026 yet.\u201d You assured her, offering a hug that she accepted, before\nturning to Bucky, who seemed genuinely happy to see you, with a smile and a hug\nas a greeting. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay kid. I owe you for helping me.\u201d Bucky\ntold you, keeping his hand on your shoulder. You shrugged him off. </p><p>\u201cI wanted to help, don\u2019t worry about it Buck.\u201d You assured.\n\u201cAnyway, is this where you live now?\u201d You asked, peeking behind him at the hut.\nHe nodded, motioning you to follow him, leaving Wanda and Steve behind.\nPerfect. He led you into the hut, showing you the interior. \u201cSo\u2026 making\nfriends?\u201d You asked him. </p><p>\u201cYeah. T\u2019Challa ain\u2019t trying to kill me anymore, as you can\ntell since he\u2019s given me residency and protection. Nat and I have been getting\na long- she\u2019s been kind of a spokesperson for me when talking to Tony since I\ncan\u2019t be in a room with him yet without him trying to kill me\u2026 and Wanda and I\nare getting a long pretty well.\u201d He informed you, and you smirked. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPretty well you say?\u201d You hinted. You turned to look at you\nwith a small grin on his face, before turning around again, but you saw that\ntoothy smile. \u201cYou like her?\u201d You asked, inching closer. He nudged you, but you\nonly gasped and got closer. \u201cYou so like her!\u201d </p><p>\u201cShush, she\u2019ll hear you!\u201d Bucky shushed you, but he couldn\u2019t\nget rid of that grin on his face. \u201cAnd anyway, what does it matter?\u201d He asked.\nYou smirked, going in your bag and pulling out the infamous book, flicking\nthrough the pages. </p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the spell to get here. I need a reason to want to\ntravel universes, and it just so happened that the spell allowed \u2018getting Bucky\nand Wanda together\u2019 as a reason. So, looks like I\u2019m playing cupid.\u201d You\nsmirked, seeing the horror rise in his face. </p><p>\u201cY/N, you better not do any love spells-\u201c </p><p>\u201cEw, no! I checked and double checked the rules of this\nspell and while I can do spells to influence things, I can\u2019t do spells to\n\u2018cheat\u2019, aka force love. However\u2026 I can use a harmless spell that lets me get\nher mind\u2019s opinion on one thing. She won\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening. I can see\nif she likes you back\u2026 and if she does, then you have to ask her out, okay?\u201d\nYou bargained with him. </p><p>\u201cSteve won\u2019t like this.\u201d Bucky said. </p><p>\u201cSteve also wants you to get together, he does like this.\u201d\nThat caused a groan from him and a laugh from you as you started skimming the\nbook for that spell. </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

You were definitely getting a\nlot better, and with the next movies making their appearances, Infinity War\nstarting to approach, you decided to pay a visit- not because of a fight, but\nmore of to just say hello.</p>[[MORE]]<p>However, this time you didn\u2019t have an exact reason for\nwanting to go, and therefore the spell refused to work, so you just started\nmuttering random desires you would like to do at the wall in Latin, pushing,\nand hoping to not literally hit a brick wall. </p><p>Stealing the Shield didn\u2019t work. </p><p>Neither did getting knighted as an Avenger\u2026 to be fair, Tony\nprobably wouldn\u2019t knight you after your run in. So you decided to try something\nstupid. </p><p><i>\u201cI want to get Bucky\nand Wanda together.\u201d </i>You admitted to the wall in your attic, and pushed,\nnearly tumbling forward as the wall disappeared. You squeezed your eyes shut,\npractically tripping all the way through the portal till you reached the other\nside, and falling over. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that worked out of all the requests\u2026\u201d\nYou muttered, getting up and dusting your knees off, until you heard something\u2026\nturning on\u2026 probably a weapon\u2026 turning your head to the side and looking up,\nyou saw Shuri pointing one of her gauntlets at you, and you realised where you\nwere. </p><p>\u201cWho are you, and how did you do that?\u201d She asked you,\nnodding her head to the now bare wall. You raised your hands in surrender. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I\u2019m a witch and Steve and Bucky know me. I helped\nthem escape.\u201d You explained quickly. The names of the superheroes made her back\naway a little, giving you a little space. </p><p>\u201cYou are to stay there with your hands were I can see them\nwhile I call my brother.\u201d She ordered, rushing over to her desk. It wasn\u2019t long\ntill the Dora Milaje came rushing down with T\u2019Challa. He of course recognised\nyou as the kid who was at the airport who disappeared with Bucky and Steve, and\nhe gestured to his side. The Dora Milaje parted, and Steve came though,\nsurprised to see you, and you gave a cheeky smile. </p><p>\u201cHey Steve.\u201d You greeted. Steve looked back at the king,\nbefore looking back at you, motioning you to stand up. You did as told, and he\ntook your arm, guiding you away. \u201cSorry for causing a bit of a scene, but I\ndon\u2019t really have control over where the spell decides to drop me.\u201d You\napologised to him, surprised at the little chuckle you got from him in\nresponse. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry kid. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay. I think Bucky\nwill be to when he sees you. After you paralysed Tony you vanished and Tony\nsaid you went through some sort of panel, and we didn\u2019t know what happened to\nyou after that.\u201d He explained. It was understandable they\u2019d be worried about\nyou- you helped them without them actually knowing you and then disappeared.\nYou knew you should have explained to them better that you\u2019d have to go home at\nsome point, and paralysing Tony and then disappearing before he could actually\nkick your skull in was your plan. </p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t really much I could have helped with past that\npoint and\u2026 I had school the next day.\u201d You admitted, which only made him\nchuckle more. \u201c\u2026Was everything okay after I left?\u201d You asked. You worried that\nyou\u2019d messed up their universe too much and you\u2019d actually damaged beyond\nrepair, but that thought was always pushed to the side. But now if you had\nmessed up, you were about to face the music. </p><p>\u201cActually\u2026 things are pretty good. Tony\u2019s doesn\u2019t contact us\na lot, but Rhodey somehow didn\u2019t lose his ability to walk\u2026 guess that has\nsomething to do with you?\u201d Your proud smile answered his question. \u201cAnd things\nare pretty calm now\u2026 but with you here I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve come to warn us or\nsomething?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cActually no. It\u2019s summer break and one of the big movies is\ncoming up and\u2026 I just wanted to say hi really. Check how you guys are\u2026 How\u2019s\nWanda?\u201d You asked, remembering the request of the spell, knowing the spell\nwon\u2019t work till it was accomplished\u2026 and you were starting to realise how big a\ntask it actually was. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine\u2026 Her and Vision aren\u2019t seeing each other\nanymore, it wasn\u2019t working but they\u2019re friends still.

You did that. You travelled\nto a different universe and helped superheroes. You were definitely getting a\nlot better, and with the next movies making their appearances, Infinity War\nstarting to approach, you decided to pay a visit- not because of a fight, but\nmore of to just say hello.</p>[[MORE]]<p>However, this time you didn\u2019t have an exact reason for\nwanting to go, and therefore the spell refused to work, so you just started\nmuttering random desires you would like to do at the wall in Latin, pushing,\nand hoping to not literally hit a brick wall. </p><p>Stealing the Shield didn\u2019t work. </p><p>Neither did getting knighted as an Avenger\u2026 to be fair, Tony\nprobably wouldn\u2019t knight you after your run in. So you decided to try something\nstupid. </p><p><i>\u201cI want to get Bucky\nand Wanda together.\u201d </i>You admitted to the wall in your attic, and pushed,\nnearly tumbling forward as the wall disappeared. You squeezed your eyes shut,\npractically tripping all the way through the portal till you reached the other\nside, and falling over. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that worked out of all the requests\u2026\u201d\nYou muttered, getting up and dusting your knees off, until you heard something\u2026\nturning on\u2026 probably a weapon\u2026 turning your head to the side and looking up,\nyou saw Shuri pointing one of her gauntlets at you, and you realised where you\nwere. </p><p>\u201cWho are you, and how did you do that?\u201d She asked you,\nnodding her head to the now bare wall. You raised your hands in surrender. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I\u2019m a witch and Steve and Bucky know me. I helped\nthem escape.\u201d You explained quickly. The names of the superheroes made her back\naway a little, giving you a little space. </p><p>\u201cYou are to stay there with your hands were I can see them\nwhile I call my brother.\u201d She ordered, rushing over to her desk. It wasn\u2019t long\ntill the Dora Milaje came rushing down with T\u2019Challa. He of course recognised\nyou as the kid who was at the airport who disappeared with Bucky and Steve, and\nhe gestured to his side. The Dora Milaje parted, and Steve came though,\nsurprised to see you, and you gave a cheeky smile. </p><p>\u201cHey Steve.\u201d You greeted. Steve looked back at the king,\nbefore looking back at you, motioning you to stand up. You did as told, and he\ntook your arm, guiding you away. \u201cSorry for causing a bit of a scene, but I\ndon\u2019t really have control over where the spell decides to drop me.\u201d You\napologised to him, surprised at the little chuckle you got from him in\nresponse. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry kid. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay. I think Bucky\nwill be to when he sees you. After you paralysed Tony you vanished and Tony\nsaid you went through some sort of panel, and we didn\u2019t know what happened to\nyou after that.\u201d He explained. It was understandable they\u2019d be worried about\nyou- you helped them without them actually knowing you and then disappeared.\nYou knew you should have explained to them better that you\u2019d have to go home at\nsome point, and paralysing Tony and then disappearing before he could actually\nkick your skull in was your plan. </p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t really much I could have helped with past that\npoint and\u2026 I had school the next day.\u201d You admitted, which only made him\nchuckle more. \u201c\u2026Was everything okay after I left?\u201d You asked. You worried that\nyou\u2019d messed up their universe too much and you\u2019d actually damaged beyond\nrepair, but that thought was always pushed to the side. But now if you had\nmessed up, you were about to face the music. </p><p>\u201cActually\u2026 things are pretty good. Tony\u2019s doesn\u2019t contact us\na lot, but Rhodey somehow didn\u2019t lose his ability to walk\u2026 guess that has\nsomething to do with you?\u201d Your proud smile answered his question. \u201cAnd things\nare pretty calm now\u2026 but with you here I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve come to warn us or\nsomething?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cActually no. It\u2019s summer break and one of the big movies is\ncoming up and\u2026 I just wanted to say hi really. Check how you guys are\u2026 How\u2019s\nWanda?\u201d You asked, remembering the request of the spell, knowing the spell\nwon\u2019t work till it was accomplished\u2026 and you were starting to realise how big a\ntask it actually was. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine\u2026 Her and Vision aren\u2019t seeing each other\nanymore, it wasn\u2019t working but they\u2019re friends still. She\u2019s settled in pretty\nwell here with me, Buck and Nat.\u201d He told you, and he saw the smile on your\nface. \u201cOkay, why are you really here?\u201d He asked, stopping you in the hallway. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 well I did want to check on you guys and to just say\nhello, but since the spell doesn\u2019t work without a proper reason, I was just saying\nstuff and now it probably won\u2019t let me back till I complete said task and- I\nmay have set the task to get Bucky and Wanda together.\u201d You explained quickly\nto him, seeing the shock set in his face, and then turn into pleasant humour. </p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ve gotten you a head start- I\u2019ve been busy trying\nto patch things up with Tony and Nat\u2019s been coming along, so they\u2019ve been alone\nfor a lot and have been getting on pretty well.\u201d He told you. </p><p>Steve led you out the building and through the bustling city\nwhile you caught up on anything you missed out on between movies as you headed\nto a more desolate location till you could see a small home, and a familiar man\nworking outside it, conversing with another familiar face. Both soon heard you\napproaching, and turned to see you, looking surprised at the appearance of you.</p><p>\u201cY/N? What are you doing here?\u201d Wanda asked. </p><p>\u201cJust came to say hi and to let you guys know I\u2019m okay and\nto make sure you\u2019re doing okay\u2026 don\u2019t worry, I haven\u2019t come to warn you about\nsomething\u2026 yet.\u201d You assured her, offering a hug that she accepted, before\nturning to Bucky, who seemed genuinely happy to see you, with a smile and a hug\nas a greeting. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay kid. I owe you for helping me.\u201d Bucky\ntold you, keeping his hand on your shoulder. You shrugged him off. </p><p>\u201cI wanted to help, don\u2019t worry about it Buck.\u201d You assured.\n\u201cAnyway, is this where you live now?\u201d You asked, peeking behind him at the hut.\nHe nodded, motioning you to follow him, leaving Wanda and Steve behind.\nPerfect. He led you into the hut, showing you the interior. \u201cSo\u2026 making\nfriends?\u201d You asked him. </p><p>\u201cYeah. T\u2019Challa ain\u2019t trying to kill me anymore, as you can\ntell since he\u2019s given me residency and protection. Nat and I have been getting\na long- she\u2019s been kind of a spokesperson for me when talking to Tony since I\ncan\u2019t be in a room with him yet without him trying to kill me\u2026 and Wanda and I\nare getting a long pretty well.\u201d He informed you, and you smirked. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPretty well you say?\u201d You hinted. You turned to look at you\nwith a small grin on his face, before turning around again, but you saw that\ntoothy smile. \u201cYou like her?\u201d You asked, inching closer. He nudged you, but you\nonly gasped and got closer. \u201cYou so like her!\u201d </p><p>\u201cShush, she\u2019ll hear you!\u201d Bucky shushed you, but he couldn\u2019t\nget rid of that grin on his face. \u201cAnd anyway, what does it matter?\u201d He asked.\nYou smirked, going in your bag and pulling out the infamous book, flicking\nthrough the pages. </p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the spell to get here. I need a reason to want to\ntravel universes, and it just so happened that the spell allowed \u2018getting Bucky\nand Wanda together\u2019 as a reason. So, looks like I\u2019m playing cupid.\u201d You\nsmirked, seeing the horror rise in his face. </p><p>\u201cY/N, you better not do any love spells-\u201c </p><p>\u201cEw, no! I checked and double checked the rules of this\nspell and while I can do spells to influence things, I can\u2019t do spells to\n\u2018cheat\u2019, aka force love. However\u2026 I can use a harmless spell that lets me get\nher mind\u2019s opinion on one thing. She won\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening. I can see\nif she likes you back\u2026 and if she does, then you have to ask her out, okay?\u201d\nYou bargained with him. </p><p>\u201cSteve won\u2019t like this.\u201d Bucky said. </p><p>\u201cSteve also wants you to get together, he does like this.\u201d\nThat caused a groan from him and a laugh from you as you started skimming the\nbook for that spell. </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

Come on.</li><li><b>Loki had completed his journey and then some.</b> His arc was completed in The Dark World, and then in Ragnarok he got to continue and actually live his dream of ruling Asgard (and then intended to do it again on Sakaar, showing that Loki is stuck in his own cycle, even though his \u201credemption\u201d was completed in the previous movie). It was shown that although he longed to rule, he wasn\u2019t particularly suited for it and therefore added more justification to the fact that Thor/The Avengers kept stopping him from reaching that power. Even after proving that he isn\u2019t fit to rule and is much more suited as a luxurious <i>[slutty]</i> right - hand - man to whoever actually is in charge, he still acts as though he is the saviour of the Sakaar and Asgardian refugees, although we know that Thor will eventually be the king once the immediate battle is over. Basically Ragnarok just proves that Loki is forever stuck in his own cycle of bad decisions for selfish reasons, but that <i>he isn\u2019t truly evil</i>. He\u2019s just the God of Mischief. He\u2019s got the mischief part down, but without being a king, he\u2019s somewhat lost on the whole \u201cgod\u201d part, and will forever be trying to find it.</li><li><b>Loki dying in Infinity War reiterates what Ragnarok confirmed and what has always been hinted at throughout all of his appearances in the MCU - that Loki is <i>not evil</i>.</b> Now that Thor has accepted his place as King of Asgard, and that they are returning to Earth, where Loki is surely not welcome, if Loki were to continue in the series, he wouldn\u2019t really have anywhere to go as a character. They\u2019d have to start a new arc with him, which is fine, but when the last arc took 3 Thor films and 2 Avengers films to complete, I just don\u2019t see Marvel committing to that new arc for who knows how many future movies. Loki dying in Infinity War completed his personal 5 movie arc in a valiant way and I think that it\u2019s what Loki deserved - to die on the side of good, next to his brother Thor, but his death comes as a repercussion of his past crimes (the Battle of New York and losing the Infinity Stones).</li><li><b>Loki\u2019s death in Infinity War isn\u2019t the sole reason for Thor\u2019s journey in that movie.</b> Thor is doing what he\u2019s doing because it\u2019s what he has to do, it\u2019s the RIGHT thing to do, and he is a hero and a king. Thor just lost his father, had to kill his sister whom he only just learnt existed at all, his homeland was entirely destroyed, half of his people murdered, one of his longest and best friends murdered (Heimdall), and then finally, Loki is killed. Sure Loki\u2019s death helps propel Thor\u2019s story a bit, but it serves more as a reminder of all that Thor\u2019s been through, rather than an inciting incident for Thor\u2019s decision to go after Thanos. Not Fridging. Not purely to propel Thor forward. We don\u2019t mourn Loki because Thor\u2019s mourning him, we mourn him because it\u2019s <i>Loki</i>.

Gotta help that color last as long as possible.\u201d</p><p>Sam shot a look at Riley. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by crazies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just polish,\u201d Bucky scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like having colorful toenails puts your manhood in jeopardy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could learn a thing or two from us,\u201d Clint said with a nod. \u201cWe have attractive women fussing over our feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about people seeing the color, I have some nearly invisible sheer polish you\u2019re welcome to use,\u201d Nat informed them, finishing the basecoat on Bucky\u2019s second foot. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have a girly name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShine makes your nails look healthier,\u201d Steve teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, really,\u201d Sam insisted with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cSame,\u201d Riley agreed.</p><p>The two of them passed around sodas and slices of pizza to those who were stuck in place while their toenails dried. By the time the ball dropped on TV, everyone\u2019s polish was dry and people had resituated themselves around the room.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we\u2019re in New York,\u201d Steve remarked dryly. \u201cWe could\u2019ve gone to see the ball drop in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the apartment is warmer,\u201d Clint pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>The singles in the room cheered as the ball dropped, while the two couples kissed.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Baby,\u201d Riley whispered.</p><p>You smiled back. \u201cHappy New Year.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\u00a0</p><p>Well, that could have gone worse, Clint told himself as he lay in bed, the party long over. He\u2019d gotten an hour with you and Natasha without Riley around kissing you every few minutes. He\u2019d had to glue his eyes to the TV for your New Year\u2019s kiss, but as hard as it had been to see you happy with someone else, he did like to see you happy. Maybe if he hadn\u2019t been a coward through high school, you\u2019d be happy with him instead.</p><p>He rolled over and curled himself around his extra pillow. As he slept, thoughts of you kept drifting through his head. Your smile, your laugh, the way you lit up at his stupid jokes\u2026.</p><p>Yeah, he definitely had it bad.</p>",

Gotta help that color last as long as possible.\u201d</p><p>Sam shot a look at Riley. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by crazies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just polish,\u201d Bucky scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like having colorful toenails puts your manhood in jeopardy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could learn a thing or two from us,\u201d Clint said with a nod. \u201cWe have attractive women fussing over our feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about people seeing the color, I have some nearly invisible sheer polish you\u2019re welcome to use,\u201d Nat informed them, finishing the basecoat on Bucky\u2019s second foot. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have a girly name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShine makes your nails look healthier,\u201d Steve teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, really,\u201d Sam insisted with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cSame,\u201d Riley agreed.</p><p>The two of them passed around sodas and slices of pizza to those who were stuck in place while their toenails dried. By the time the ball dropped on TV, everyone\u2019s polish was dry and people had resituated themselves around the room.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we\u2019re in New York,\u201d Steve remarked dryly. \u201cWe could\u2019ve gone to see the ball drop in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the apartment is warmer,\u201d Clint pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>The singles in the room cheered as the ball dropped, while the two couples kissed.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Baby,\u201d Riley whispered.</p><p>You smiled back. \u201cHappy New Year.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>Well, that could have gone worse, Clint told himself as he lay in bed, the party long over. He\u2019d gotten an hour with you and Natasha without Riley around kissing you every few minutes. He\u2019d had to glue his eyes to the TV for your New Year\u2019s kiss, but as hard as it had been to see you happy with someone else, he did like to see you happy. Maybe if he hadn\u2019t been a coward through high school, you\u2019d be happy with him instead.</p><p>He rolled over and curled himself around his extra pillow. As he slept, thoughts of you kept drifting through his head. Your smile, your laugh, the way you lit up at his stupid jokes\u2026.</p><p>Yeah, he definitely had it bad.</p>",

Your girl\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>Your boyfriend, Sam\u2019s roommate Riley, emerged from around the corner.</p><p>\u201cHey baby,\u201d he greeted you, leaning in to give you a kiss and taking the grocery bags from your hand. \u201cWhat did you bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree bags each of nacho cheese and cool ranch Doritos for us normal people,\u201d you grinned, pulling out a yellow bag. \u201cAnd, of course, one bag of plain Doritos for the weirdo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Clint said, swooping in from somewhere to grab them from you. \u201cI\u2019d be mad, but I\u2019ve been seriously craving nachos all day. Thanks, Y/N.\u201d He shoved a few dollar bills in your hand and bolted for the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cY/N, can you make sure he doesn\u2019t light our new microwave on fire?\u201d Nat called to you from living room. \u201cHe forgot to take the plastic off one of them last time.\u201d</p><p>You winced and called back your agreement, giving Riley a peck on the cheek before following Clint.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you can actually crave nachos with a recipe like that,\u201d you teased Clint as you entered the kitchen.</p><p>He looked up at you from where he was peeling the plastic off squares of American cheese. \u201cSays the lactose intolerant chic who wouldn\u2019t know good nachos if they did the salsa in front of her. I don\u2019t know how you stand that vegan cheese stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m not dropping sandwich squares of cheap cheese on a plate of boring chips,\u201d you shot back. \u201cHave you ever considered, I don\u2019t know, adding something with flavor? Taco meat, or salsa, or something? Heck, even flavored Doritos would make that stuff better.\u201d</p><p>Clint dropped his plate in the microwave and shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with simple. Besides, I\u2019m in college; I\u2019m taking advantage of the expectation I won\u2019t know how to cook. I have to learn enough stuff in class already, so no way am I trying to cram more kitchen info into my brain when I can survive just fine on this stuff.\u201d</p><p>You sighed and shook your head. \u201cYou\u2019re hopeless, Barton, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you love me anyway,\u201d he grinned, dropping an arm around your shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhatever lets you sleep at night,\u201d you laughed, shrugging off his shoulder and wandering back out to the party.</p><p>Clint watched you leave and sighed. Having you and your boyfriend hanging off each other in his apartment was going to test his self-control all night. This was going to be a long party.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>You settled in next to Nat, who was curled up in her boyfriend Bucky\u2019s lap. He was talking to Sam and Riley, leaving her free to converse with you.</p><p>\u201cHow are you two enjoying the new apartment so far?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice being off-campus,\u201d she admitted. \u201cClint\u2019s a great roommate, too, when he\u2019s not melting plastic in the microwave. Are you enjoying living alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh, yes,\u201d you sighed, \u201cit\u2019s perfect. No one leaves dishes in the sink overnight or their coat on the couch.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and shook her head. \u201cYou always were a bit of a neat freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Nat?\u201d Bucky shot you a look of apology as he cut into your conversation. \u201cCan I get up, doll? I\u2019d like to go with the guys who are picking up some pizza.\u201d</p><p>Nat pouted at him, but you could see the smile she was trying to hide. \u201cBut I\u2019m comfy,\u201d she whined.</p><p>\u201cIf all the guys all go, we\u2019ll get a few minutes of girl time,\u201d you offered. </p><p>Bucky gave you a grateful smile when Natasha sighed and stood up. He, Sam, and Riley gathered their coats as Steve came up with his car keys.</p><p>\u201cHey, Barton, wanna join us?\u201d Sam called. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go get pizzas and drinks. The girls are staying here to do who knows what girly stuff. We\u2019ve got one more seat in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Clint said as he came around the corner, nachos in hand. \u201cI\u2019m gonna stay and finish these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s practically one of the girls anyway,\u201d Nat teased. \u201cIt can still be a girl\u2019s night.\u201d</p><p>Riley leaned over and kissed you on the cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in an hour, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d you smiled up at him, \u201csee you then.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>At Sam\u2019s exclamation, the three of you looked up at the guys who had just tromped in with the pizzas and a few cases of soda.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Clint asked innocently.</p><p>You and Natasha were seated on the floor facing each other, painting each other\u2019s toenails. Clint\u2019s were already finished; he was leaning his back against the couch and reading an article from the latest issue of Us Weekly aloud as they dried.</p><p>Sam gave his feet a pointed look. \u201cYour toenails are hot pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe color,\u201d Clint informed him, \u201cis called Bachelorette Bash. Nat\u2019s are Russian Roulette and Y/N\u2019s are Loot the Booty.\u201d</p><p>Riley made a choking sound. You shot him a glare.</p><p>\u201cPirate booty, Babe. Treasure. Get your mind out of the gutter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d Sam shook his head, \u201cyou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you he was practically one of us,\u201d Nat laughed.</p><p>You grinned up at your boyfriend. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to do yours next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll pass,\u201d he said with a smile, bending over to kiss you on the top of your head. \u201cMaybe Sam\u2019ll take you up on the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell I will,\u201d Sam muttered, drawing a laugh from his roommate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take mine in mint green,\u201d Bucky announced, flopping down on the couch.</p><p>Nat blew on your toes as she finished the last one and reached for a bottle of base coat. \u201cDo you mean Chillato, Mint Candy Apple, or Bon Boy-age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDibs on\u2026\u201d Steve scooped up a bottle and read the color title, \u201cLeggy Legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoes and socks off,\u201d you laughed as you took the bottle from him. \u201cDo you want base and top coat too, or just the polish?\u201d</p><p>He looked at you like you were crazy. \u201cDuh, base and top coat too! Gotta help that color last as long as possible.\u201d</p><p>Sam shot a look at Riley. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by crazies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just polish,\u201d Bucky scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like having colorful toenails puts your manhood in jeopardy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could learn a thing or two from us,\u201d Clint said with a nod. \u201cWe have attractive women fussing over our feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about people seeing the color, I have some nearly invisible sheer polish you\u2019re welcome to use,\u201d Nat informed them, finishing the basecoat on Bucky\u2019s second foot. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have a girly name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShine makes your nails look healthier,\u201d Steve teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, really,\u201d Sam insisted with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cSame,\u201d Riley agreed.</p><p>The two of them passed around sodas and slices of pizza to those who were stuck in place while their toenails dried.

We&rsquo;ve got one more seat in the car.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; Clint said as he came around the corner, nachos in hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna stay and finish these.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s practically one of the girls anyway,&rdquo; Nat teased. &ldquo;It can still be a girl&rsquo;s night.&rdquo;</p><p>Riley leaned over and kissed you on the cheek. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back in an hour, baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; you smiled up at him, &ldquo;see you then.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo;</p><p>At Sam&rsquo;s exclamation, the three of you looked up at the guys who had just tromped in with the pizzas and a few cases of soda.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Clint asked innocently.</p><p>You and Natasha were seated on the floor facing each other, painting each other&rsquo;s toenails. Clint&rsquo;s were already finished; he was leaning his back against the couch and reading an article from the latest issue of Us Weekly aloud as they dried.</p><p>Sam gave his feet a pointed look. &ldquo;Your toenails are hot pink.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The color,&rdquo; Clint informed him, &ldquo;is called Bachelorette Bash. Nat&rsquo;s are Russian Roulette and Y/N&rsquo;s are Loot the Booty.&rdquo;</p><p>Riley made a choking sound. You shot him a glare.</p><p>&ldquo;Pirate booty, Babe. Treasure. Get your mind out of the gutter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; Sam shook his head, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Told you he was practically one of us,&rdquo; Nat laughed.</p><p>You grinned up at your boyfriend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be happy to do yours next.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll pass,&rdquo; he said with a smile, bending over to kiss you on the top of your head. &ldquo;Maybe Sam&rsquo;ll take you up on the offer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like hell I will,&rdquo; Sam muttered, drawing a laugh from his roommate.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take mine in mint green,&rdquo; Bucky announced, flopping down on the couch.</p><p>Nat blew on your toes as she finished the last one and reached for a bottle of base coat. &ldquo;Do you mean Chillato, Mint Candy Apple, or Bon Boy-age?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The first one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dibs on&hellip;&rdquo; Steve scooped up a bottle and read the color title, &ldquo;Leggy Legend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shoes and socks off,&rdquo; you laughed as you took the bottle from him. &ldquo;Do you want base and top coat too, or just the polish?&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at you like you were crazy. &ldquo;Duh, base and top coat too! Gotta help that color last as long as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam shot a look at Riley. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re surrounded by crazies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just polish,&rdquo; Bucky scoffed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like having colorful toenails puts your manhood in jeopardy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could learn a thing or two from us,&rdquo; Clint said with a nod. &ldquo;We have attractive women fussing over our feet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re concerned about people seeing the color, I have some nearly invisible sheer polish you&rsquo;re welcome to use,&rdquo; Nat informed them, finishing the basecoat on Bucky&rsquo;s second foot. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t even have a girly name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shine makes your nails look healthier,&rdquo; Steve teased.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good, really,&rdquo; Sam insisted with a shake of his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Same,&rdquo; Riley agreed.</p><p>The two of them passed around sodas and slices of pizza to those who were stuck in place while their toenails dried. By the time the ball dropped on TV, everyone&rsquo;s polish was dry and people had resituated themselves around the room.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, we&rsquo;re in New York,&rdquo; Steve remarked dryly. &ldquo;We could&rsquo;ve gone to see the ball drop in person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but the apartment is warmer,&rdquo; Clint pointed out.</p><p>&ldquo;Touch&eacute;.&rdquo;</p><p>The singles in the room cheered as the ball dropped, while the two couples kissed.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy New Year, Baby,&rdquo; Riley whispered.</p><p>You smiled back. &ldquo;Happy New Year.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&nbsp;</p><p>Well, that could have gone worse, Clint told himself as he lay in bed, the party long over. He&rsquo;d gotten an hour with you and Natasha without Riley around kissing you every few minutes. He&rsquo;d had to glue his eyes to the TV for your New Year&rsquo;s kiss, but as hard as it had been to see you happy with someone else, he did like to see you happy. Maybe if he hadn&rsquo;t been a coward through high school, you&rsquo;d be happy with him instead.</p><p>He rolled over and curled himself around his extra pillow. As he slept, thoughts of you kept drifting through his head. Your smile, your laugh, the way you lit up at his stupid jokes&hellip;.</p><p>Yeah, he definitely had it bad.</p>",

They had used Christmas break to move into their off-campus apartment and had invited your core friend group over for a New Year&rsquo;s Eve bash.</p>\n<p>The three of you had grown up together, and although your friend group had expanded once you were in college, you were still each other&rsquo;s best friends. They had invited you to join them when the apartment hunt had started, but you&rsquo;d just been upgraded to a solo apartment at your residence hall and were looking forward to not having roommates for once in your life.</p>\n</p>",
