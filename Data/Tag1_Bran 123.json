The wall may have first been built by the children of the forest or the others and not men as it is told in stories. (Generally the legends may be exaggerated and untrue). The Night\u2019s Watch may have been originally an allied Others and First Men group under the Night\u2019s King (human and a Stark probably) and his queen (other).\u00a0</p><p>9. The Others reasons for rising and attacking may be that some form of the alliance or agreement was broken. It could be the return of Daenerys and dragon/magic, the widespread religion of R\u2019hollo, Summerhall, Aegon\u2019s conquest, or the long night\u2019s return, etc. etc.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>This post and its collective comments were written 4 years ago, so we have much more of the show to add to these original theories. Of course, D&amp;D may have strayed from what GRRM will do, but they know the ultimate ending. It\u2019s safe to assume we are headed toward the general right path.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>There\u2019s speculation that Jon as the balance between ice and fire will become the King at the Wall and take an Other as a bride. Some believe that Val from the books could be this bride or that Ygritte could be raised from the dead to become the bride. Either way, it seems likely if this kind of marriage alliance were endgame, then the bride to be would appear in the show before season 8. It\u2019s also fair to point out that Jon\u2019s marriage to any one - an Other, Dany, even Sansa, would be an imbalance of ice and fire. His blood is equally ice and fire, and any kind of child he would have with another woman would not share that same equalness.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Some telling things have occurred in the show so far&hellip;\u00a0</p><ul><li>heavy foreshadowing of a Dany/Jon baby &amp; the boatsex scene\u00a0</li><li>Melisandre interchanging the prince/princess who was promised with Azor Ahai\u00a0</li><li>R+L=J confirmed\u00a0</li><li>Bran returning to winterfell as the Three Eyed Raven\u00a0</li><li>The Night King killing a dragon &amp; resurrecting it for his army\u00a0</li><li>The Wall coming down via the Night King\u2019s dragon &amp; also the Night King riding a dragon\u00a0</li><li>lots of hints at a dark!dany plot and\u00a0\u201cfire and blood\u201d mentality\u00a0</li><li>building up Jon and Sansa\u2019s relationship and specifically her ability to lead and be a queen/lady\u00a0</li><li>the remaining Starks returning and reuniting at Winterfell\u00a0</li><li>the Children of the Forest created the first Other from a First Man with dragon glass to help them in the war against the First Men (or that\u2019s what they told/showed Bran)\u00a0</li><li>the Children of the Forest helped Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven, while the wights and Others attacked them\u00a0</li><li>Craster offers baby boys up as sacrifices to the Others and in return they allow him to live peacefully\u00a0</li><li>Jon becoming Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch by being elected by his men and then becoming King in the North at the request of the northern houses\u00a0</li><li>Jon believes they need the dragons to defeat the White Walkers\u00a0</li><li>There has been no attempt at peace or diplomacy\u00a0</li><li>The White Walkers attacked Hardhome a settlement North of the Wall\u00a0</li><li>The Night King can see Bran even when he wargs &amp; he can touch him even though he\u2019s the Three-Eyed Raven\u00a0</li><li>The Night King also seems to have a large interest in Jon\u00a0</li><li>The Night King and his officers do not seem to be able to burn instead they create frost/cold as they walk\u00a0</li><li>When a White Walker is killed, all the wights it created are killed as well\u00a0</li><li>R\u2019hollo is seen as the Lord of Light and in many ways life as well as flames obviously but shadows too. There is another god who may contrast him: Death. These seem to be two popular religions in Essos. While the Seven are still most popular in Westeros (especially by the Andals), and only the First Men, Children of the Forest worship the old gods.\u00a0</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>So&hellip; if Jon and Dany have a baby&hellip; will it be sacrificed? This would be pretty dark and possibly hard to do believably bc like Jon wouldn\u2019t just hand it over and also why would it be near the war?\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>If there is to a marriage alliance, it might make the most sense to join ice and fire - the Night King and Dany. Or to go with the old legends where a Stark married an Other. It may be Sansa who is married off to the Night King. It could also very well be that Jon ends up marrying an Other and becoming the King on the Wall, which would seem fitting. Again, though, this wouldn\u2019t bring a sense of balance in my opinion.\u00a0I don\u2019t see Dany making it out of season 8 alive, and if she does, I see it as some sort of alliance like this one.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Perhaps there could also be an ending where Dany is defeated after she probably backs out on the deal with Jon and goes to take down Cersei. I imagine she would burn the Red Keep to the ground and at some point the Iron Throne itself would melt. (Although I always liked the idea of Sansa or Jaime ultimately taking Cersei down&hellip;) A deal is made with the Others, and they retreat. A Stark rules in Winterfell as King in the North/The King of Winter, and perhaps the Night\u2019s Watch is abandoned or changed entirely. If it was part of the old treaty, it obviously ended up backfiring. (Also, in this scenario perhaps Sansa and Jon can be together because tbh that\u2019s what I truly want). Maybe there is independence and Westeros becomes Seven Kingdoms who work together again, and this may be led by Tyrion who is a great politician but not a true leader or King of all Seven realms.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>I think that Arya\u2019s fate is the only Stark I am truly worried about&hellip; if Jon dies, I know it will be at the pinnacle hero moment which will ultimately make it worth it. He will have died/sacrificed himself because he\u2019s the only one who could do it or something like that. Similarly, if Sansa were to die or be married off to an Other or something similar, I feel it would be her duty and in some way so befitting of a queen to sacrifice for her people. Arya on the other hand, her death would have less plot meaning. I think in general her arc has the least amount of plot meaning and endgame potential, so I worry she will die in battle. I\u2019m sure it would be a lovely scene, but it wouldn\u2019t probably have lasting impacts the same way Jon or Sansa\u2019s (or also Dany\u2019s) would. Bran I don\u2019t think will die because he is the Three-Eyed Raven UNLESS it is important that the Three-Eyed Raven die in order to defeat the Night King/come to an agreement/etc. We still don\u2019t know the full extent of his powers or his purpose yet, so a lot is up in the air for Bran. We just know he\u2019s important.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>I want to add quickly that Melisandre said she has to die in this strange country. I wonder if perhaps there is some of agreement/coupling or something that she as a Red Priestess will be involved in. She obviously still has a part to play, and seeing as I imagine that the second she arrives she\u2019ll be marked for death, she will likely show up at a very pivotal moment. I don\u2019t imagine her just popping in to give Jon some advice at a vision in the flames. It will be more than that and likely it will be magical.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>The teaser of the map where ice and fire meet and almost form some kind of wall or mountain&hellip; it has always made me think that perhaps a new wall is formed at the end of this to replace the current wall?\u00a0</p>",

Some believe that Val from the books could be this bride or that Ygritte could be raised from the dead to become the bride. Either way, it seems likely if this kind of marriage alliance were endgame, then the bride to be would appear in the show before season 8. It\u2019s also fair to point out that Jon\u2019s marriage to any one - an Other, Dany, even Sansa, would be an imbalance of ice and fire. His blood is equally ice and fire, and any kind of child he would have with another woman would not share that same equalness.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Some telling things have occurred in the show so far\u2026\u00a0</p><ul><li>heavy foreshadowing of a Dany/Jon baby &amp; the boatsex scene\u00a0</li><li>Melisandre interchanging the prince/princess who was promised with Azor Ahai\u00a0</li><li>R+L=J confirmed\u00a0</li><li>Bran returning to winterfell as the Three Eyed Raven\u00a0</li><li>The Night King killing a dragon &amp; resurrecting it for his army\u00a0</li><li>The Wall coming down via the Night King\u2019s dragon &amp; also the Night King riding a dragon\u00a0</li><li>lots of hints at a dark!dany plot and\u00a0\u201cfire and blood\u201d mentality\u00a0</li><li>building up Jon and Sansa\u2019s relationship and specifically her ability to lead and be a queen/lady\u00a0</li><li>the remaining Starks returning and reuniting at Winterfell\u00a0</li><li>the Children of the Forest created the first Other from a First Man with dragon glass to help them in the war against the First Men (or that\u2019s what they told/showed Bran)\u00a0</li><li>the Children of the Forest helped Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven, while the wights and Others attacked them\u00a0</li><li>Craster offers baby boys up as sacrifices to the Others and in return they allow him to live peacefully\u00a0</li><li>Jon becoming Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch by being elected by his men and then becoming King in the North at the request of the northern houses\u00a0</li><li>Jon believes they need the dragons to defeat the White Walkers\u00a0</li><li>There has been no attempt at peace or diplomacy\u00a0</li><li>The White Walkers attacked Hardhome a settlement North of the Wall\u00a0</li><li>The Night King can see Bran even when he wargs &amp; he can touch him even though he\u2019s the Three-Eyed Raven\u00a0</li><li>The Night King also seems to have a large interest in Jon\u00a0</li><li>The Night King and his officers do not seem to be able to burn instead they create frost/cold as they walk\u00a0</li><li>When a White Walker is killed, all the wights it created are killed as well\u00a0</li><li>R\u2019hollo is seen as the Lord of Light and in many ways life as well as flames obviously but shadows too.

While the Seven are still most popular in Westeros (especially by the Andals), and only the First Men, Children of the Forest worship the old gods.\u00a0</li></ul><p><br></p><p>So\u2026 if Jon and Dany have a baby\u2026 will it be sacrificed? This would be pretty dark and possibly hard to do believably bc like Jon wouldn\u2019t just hand it over and also why would it be near the war?\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>If there is to a marriage alliance, it might make the most sense to join ice and fire - the Night King and Dany. Or to go with the old legends where a Stark married an Other. It may be Sansa who is married off to the Night King. It could also very well be that Jon ends up marrying an Other and becoming the King on the Wall, which would seem fitting. Again, though, this wouldn\u2019t bring a sense of balance in my opinion.\u00a0I don\u2019t see Dany making it out of season 8 alive, and if she does, I see it as some sort of alliance like this one.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps there could also be an ending where Dany is defeated after she probably backs out on the deal with Jon and goes to take down Cersei. I imagine she would burn the Red Keep to the ground and at some point the Iron Throne itself would melt. (Although I always liked the idea of Sansa or Jaime ultimately taking Cersei down\u2026) A deal is made with the Others, and they retreat. A Stark rules in Winterfell as King in the North/The King of Winter, and perhaps the Night\u2019s Watch is abandoned or changed entirely. If it was part of the old treaty, it obviously ended up backfiring. (Also, in this scenario perhaps Sansa and Jon can be together because tbh that\u2019s what I truly want). Maybe there is independence and Westeros becomes Seven Kingdoms who work together again, and this may be led by Tyrion who is a great politician but not a true leader or King of all Seven realms.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>I think that Arya\u2019s fate is the only Stark I am truly worried about\u2026 if Jon dies, I know it will be at the pinnacle hero moment which will ultimately make it worth it. He will have died/sacrificed himself because he\u2019s the only one who could do it or something like that. Similarly, if Sansa were to die or be married off to an Other or something similar, I feel it would be her duty and in some way so befitting of a queen to sacrifice for her people. Arya on the other hand, her death would have less plot meaning. I think in general her arc has the least amount of plot meaning and endgame potential, so I worry she will die in battle. I\u2019m sure it would be a lovely scene, but it wouldn\u2019t probably have lasting impacts the same way Jon or Sansa\u2019s (or also Dany\u2019s) would. Bran I don\u2019t think will die because he is the Three-Eyed Raven UNLESS it is important that the Three-Eyed Raven die in order to defeat the Night King/come to an agreement/etc. We still don\u2019t know the full extent of his powers or his purpose yet, so a lot is up in the air for Bran. We just know he\u2019s important.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>I want to add quickly that Melisandre said she has to die in this strange country. I wonder if perhaps there is some of agreement/coupling or something that she as a Red Priestess will be involved in. She obviously still has a part to play, and seeing as I imagine that the second she arrives she\u2019ll be marked for death, she will likely show up at a very pivotal moment. I don\u2019t imagine her just popping in to give Jon some advice at a vision in the flames. It will be more than that and likely it will be magical.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The teaser of the map where ice and fire meet and almost form some kind of wall or mountain\u2026 it has always made me think that perhaps a new wall is formed at the end of this to replace the current wall?\u00a0</p>",

Some believe that Val from the books could be this bride or that Ygritte could be raised from the dead to become the bride. Either way, it seems likely if this kind of marriage alliance were endgame, then the bride to be would appear in the show before season 8. It&rsquo;s also fair to point out that Jon&rsquo;s marriage to any one - an Other, Dany, even Sansa, would be an imbalance of ice and fire. His blood is equally ice and fire, and any kind of child he would have with another woman would not share that same equalness.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Some telling things have occurred in the show so far&hellip;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>heavy foreshadowing of a Dany/Jon baby &amp; the boatsex scene&nbsp;</li><li>Melisandre interchanging the prince/princess who was promised with Azor Ahai&nbsp;</li><li>R+L=J confirmed&nbsp;</li><li>Bran returning to winterfell as the Three Eyed Raven&nbsp;</li><li>The Night King killing a dragon &amp; resurrecting it for his army&nbsp;</li><li>The Wall coming down via the Night King&rsquo;s dragon &amp; also the Night King riding a dragon&nbsp;</li><li>lots of hints at a dark!dany plot and&nbsp;&ldquo;fire and blood&rdquo; mentality&nbsp;</li><li>building up Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s relationship and specifically her ability to lead and be a queen/lady&nbsp;</li><li>the remaining Starks returning and reuniting at Winterfell&nbsp;</li><li>the Children of the Forest created the first Other from a First Man with dragon glass to help them in the war against the First Men (or that&rsquo;s what they told/showed Bran)&nbsp;</li><li>the Children of the Forest helped Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven, while the wights and Others attacked them&nbsp;</li><li>Craster offers baby boys up as sacrifices to the Others and in return they allow him to live peacefully&nbsp;</li><li>Jon becoming Lord Commander of the Night&rsquo;s Watch by being elected by his men and then becoming King in the North at the request of the northern houses&nbsp;</li><li>Jon believes they need the dragons to defeat the White Walkers&nbsp;</li><li>There has been no attempt at peace or diplomacy&nbsp;</li><li>The White Walkers attacked Hardhome a settlement North of the Wall&nbsp;</li><li>The Night King can see Bran even when he wargs &amp; he can touch him even though he&rsquo;s the Three-Eyed Raven&nbsp;</li><li>The Night King also seems to have a large interest in Jon&nbsp;</li><li>The Night King and his officers do not seem to be able to burn instead they create frost/cold as they walk&nbsp;</li><li>When a White Walker is killed, all the wights it created are killed as well&nbsp;</li><li>R&rsquo;hollo is seen as the Lord of Light and in many ways life as well as flames obviously but shadows too.

This would be pretty dark and possibly hard to do believably bc like Jon wouldn&rsquo;t just hand it over and also why would it be near the war?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>If there is to a marriage alliance, it might make the most sense to join ice and fire - the Night King and Dany. Or to go with the old legends where a Stark married an Other. It may be Sansa who is married off to the Night King. It could also very well be that Jon ends up marrying an Other and becoming the King on the Wall, which would seem fitting. Again, though, this wouldn&rsquo;t bring a sense of balance in my opinion.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t see Dany making it out of season 8 alive, and if she does, I see it as some sort of alliance like this one.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Perhaps there could also be an ending where Dany is defeated after she probably backs out on the deal with Jon and goes to take down Cersei. I imagine she would burn the Red Keep to the ground and at some point the Iron Throne itself would melt. (Although I always liked the idea of Sansa or Jaime ultimately taking Cersei down&hellip;) A deal is made with the Others, and they retreat. A Stark rules in Winterfell as King in the North/The King of Winter, and perhaps the Night&rsquo;s Watch is abandoned or changed entirely. If it was part of the old treaty, it obviously ended up backfiring. (Also, in this scenario perhaps Sansa and Jon can be together because tbh that&rsquo;s what I truly want). Maybe there is independence and Westeros becomes Seven Kingdoms who work together again, and this may be led by Tyrion who is a great politician but not a true leader or King of all Seven realms.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I think that Arya&rsquo;s fate is the only Stark I am truly worried about&hellip; if Jon dies, I know it will be at the pinnacle hero moment which will ultimately make it worth it. He will have died/sacrificed himself because he&rsquo;s the only one who could do it or something like that. Similarly, if Sansa were to die or be married off to an Other or something similar, I feel it would be her duty and in some way so befitting of a queen to sacrifice for her people. Arya on the other hand, her death would have less plot meaning. I think in general her arc has the least amount of plot meaning and endgame potential, so I worry she will die in battle. I&rsquo;m sure it would be a lovely scene, but it wouldn&rsquo;t probably have lasting impacts the same way Jon or Sansa&rsquo;s (or also Dany&rsquo;s) would. Bran I don&rsquo;t think will die because he is the Three-Eyed Raven UNLESS it is important that the Three-Eyed Raven die in order to defeat the Night King/come to an agreement/etc. We still don&rsquo;t know the full extent of his powers or his purpose yet, so a lot is up in the air for Bran. We just know he&rsquo;s important.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I want to add quickly that Melisandre said she has to die in this strange country. I wonder if perhaps there is some of agreement/coupling or something that she as a Red Priestess will be involved in. She obviously still has a part to play, and seeing as I imagine that the second she arrives she&rsquo;ll be marked for death, she will likely show up at a very pivotal moment. I don&rsquo;t imagine her just popping in to give Jon some advice at a vision in the flames. It will be more than that and likely it will be magical.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The teaser of the map where ice and fire meet and almost form some kind of wall or mountain&hellip; it has always made me think that perhaps a new wall is formed at the end of this to replace the current wall?&nbsp;</p>",

The Others aren&rsquo;t pure evil &amp; actually have a reason for rallying and coming South. They are the heroes of their story just as they appear to be the villains to us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. The Starks have a long history with the Others and the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Somehow their story is tied up in the Night&rsquo;s King, the first Lord Commanders, The Kings of Winter, and the Kings Beyond the Wall. Their words&nbsp;&ldquo;Winter is Coming&rdquo; are derived from this connection, and may not just be a warning of hard times but also a brag of their own such as&nbsp;&ldquo;Hear Me Roar&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;Growing Strong&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Therefore, the Starks have a large role to play in the conflict with the Others, and that conflict will likely result in diplomacy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. The ultimate resolution will be about restoring balance to the world. Right now, there are extremely long winters and extremely long summers. The seasons are out of whack, and there is some kind of ancient magical reason for this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. Dany is Azor Ahai, and ultimately she will become dark!dany or more of a villain character.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6. The ice and fire threats are the Others and the dragons/those of dragonblood. But there is also the R&rsquo;hollo to consider as well as some type of ancient ice god/force.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7. Jon is the song of ice and fire, and as such he will likely play a large role in negotiations with the Others and potentially Dany.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8. The wall may have first been built by the children of the forest or the others and not men as it is told in stories. (Generally the legends may be exaggerated and untrue). The Night&rsquo;s Watch may have been originally an allied Others and First Men group under the Night&rsquo;s King (human and a Stark probably) and his queen (other).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9. The Others reasons for rising and attacking may be that some form of the alliance or agreement was broken. It could be the return of Daenerys and dragon/magic, the widespread religion of R&rsquo;hollo, Summerhall, Aegon&rsquo;s conquest, or the long night&rsquo;s return, etc. etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>This post and its collective comments were written 4 years ago, so we have much more of the show to add to these original theories.
