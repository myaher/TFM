You never know what you\u2019ll get when it comes to life in reality. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll know exactly what you want to do with your life before life has the chance to royally fuck you up. However, most aren\u2019t that lucky. Most are the indecisive people who just are going through this roller coaster with blindfolds, with no idea what\u2019s coming next. Yet, a roller coaster isn\u2019t the correct this type of life. In more ways, it feels as though life is just a foggy black and white haze until something adds color.</p><p>Perhaps that\u2019s why so many people prefer books and stories of fiction, it\u2019s a way to escape the uncertainty of life itself, a way to pretend that everything is actually indeed \u2018fine\u2019. At least that\u2019s how Aurora felt about it at least. Her books and music were her safe haven. With a good book in hand and her music playing, the world would just pause, even if it was for only thirty minutes, it was an escape. Perhaps it was the flow of the words that caused the young adult to feel free. Or perhaps it had to do with the fact that each character had a unique story and lesson to share. No matter the reasoning, the brunette nearly always had a book on her. Of course, she couldn\u2019t always carry a physical book on her person, but who needed to when smartphones could give you everything you could ever need.</p><p>Although books provide the girl with a blissful escape, it was also those same books that had made her content with the lack of social life since she had moved to the wet nation known as Britain. Being an American, she had very little knowledge of what to expect. After all, most of her knowledge of the country came from the television show Skins along with the Harry Potter series. But, with her very stubborn and rather particular grandmother\u2019s passing, the young twenty-one-year-old had been gifted not only the full inheritance, but her grandmother\u2019s cottage of sorts however to receive both items the girl would have to move to England. Sure, the older woman had adored her granddaughter, however Aurora suspected the will was just a final lesson, that Catherine could give her children on her death bed, what way could she punish money hungry children besides not giving them more than a final word of advice and a dime for the amount of times that they had tried to reach out in her old age. Compared to her bright-eyed granddaughter who tried to call every other week just to speak of schooling or of a novel she was reading. Although, being a college student was not easy by any means yet it was no one\u2019s fault but her own for changing her major twice. Her mess, her responsibility; how could she expect anyone to clean up her mess? Therefore, she had been balancing working part-time with being a full-time student. Her grandmother\u2019s final gift to the young woman was something that Aurora had never anticipated; a chance to start over. With the home and money all put into her name, her family was not thrilled whatsoever, yet Aurora knew that she couldn\u2019t disappoint the one person who listened about the stories she had been reading. So, the girl moved from the small town she was raised in and essentially moved crossed the world. Fully knowing from that moment her family could potentially outcast her.</p><p>Holmes Chapel, the town in which the well known Harry Styles grew up. The town isn\u2019t necessarily smaller or bigger than the small town Aurora grew up in back in America, yet there was something about the British people that made this place feel so much more knitted together. At least in the neighborhood, her grandmother had lived in seemed so close to give the illusion that each person in some way or another were like family to one another. It\u2019s no secret back home that if a young university student had moved into a residential neighborhood, some residents would complain and assume their nice quiet neighborhood would be turned into a loud obnoxious party house lowering their property values; yet here not even an hour after her cab had dropped her off at the royal blue medium sized home with the white wrap around porch that the swing next to the dark wooden door, a few neighbors had greeted her an apologized for her loss. It felt bewildering to the girl, who was always taught that it was best to keep some distance between yourself and neighbors. It simply was the way to resume privacy, but in more ways than one it was a form of isolation and nothing more. It was a way that helped build rumors, cliques, and forms judgment precursors that overtime cause unnecessary tensions over a shrub or a little fence. Looking back at the do\u2019s and don\u2019t of the pompous life that her family had created seemed rather ridiculous now. If one were to hide away in a house with no communication with neighbors, your just another robot living the social media life, everything looks perfect on the outside, while behind closed doors everything is falling to pieces with a blood-curdling scream. Besides, if no one is allowed or good enough to be in your life, what\u2019s the point of human contact? Perhaps, that is why so many people are always so miserable, it would be exhausting to constantly be something you weren\u2019t. Aurora knew that all too well for her young age, but as much as she hated to admit it, she almost did not know not how to \u2018fake it until she made it\u2019. After all that was a concept that she had learned from such a young age, girls were to smile and to be what was expected of them. Yet, with a sense of the rest button being hit in her life, the brunette finally could be who she had always wanted, and no one could force her to be anything else different.</p><p>By the exterior of the home, the house appeared to be well kept and with perfect order. Some of the plants were overgrown and dead, yet with the winter chill and slight dusting coat of snow, the demise of the plants made sense truly. It still appeared to look perfectly in order. Even when you initially enter the home everything looks as if it has a particular order. The walls are coated in what looks to be fresh grey paint and select a few picture frames to decorate the home as though only a few of the innocent moments in deserved to be relived. A black fireplace captured the living room with one swallow, with no television, and all the soft white fabric sofas angling around the fire provided a feeling of close intimacy to those who had been welcomed into the humble abode. Along the entryway of the home remained to be one of the things Aurora had always wanted in a home, a window seat, or as she called it, \u2018the most profit spot to read as it rained outside\u2019. As she stood smiling at the cushioned window, the girl could almost already hear the rain pelting against the glass cooling the world around her down as she melted away into a fantasy. Pulling herself out of her daydream, the women tossed her jean jacket on to the rocking chair closest to the black marble fireplace, while her luggage remained by the front door. Although she had sworn to break her bad habits, Aurora knew all too well she probably wouldn\u2019t unpack right away. But, how could she unpack when she still had to explore the large house?</p><p>For what felt like hours the five foot and three inches female wandered the home, first she had discovered the kitchen, arguably the most important room of the whole house. It was brighter than the living room, and somewhat expectedly the room was coated in a ray of soft sunshine yellow and the white marble had such a large contrast to the living room that she truly did not know what to expect. She could remember her grandmother telling her that one should not decorate to please people, but decorated from to please soul because if one did this then you\u2019d always feel at home no matter who is around. As she roamed further into the home she had found the half bath, guest bathroom, and guest room which were all various shades of creams to grey. Each room regardless of the paint of the walls had a bright burst of color which shouted at life and yet had something relaxing laced together with it as well.</p><p>Her soft white shocks made no noise as she took slow and gentle steps towards the final door, which the girl presumed to be the master bedroom. Taking in a large intake of hair, the girl with the messy brown hair rested her forehead against the white door. Finding some courage, her hand grasped the doorknob before carefully pushing the door into the room. Her caramel brown eyes grew to the size of saucers at the sight before her. This was nothing that she had expected for the room to look like, after all the last time she had FaceTime with her grandmother, this room had been painted a shade of bright red and covered with lace. Now, however, the walls were white as snow. The fan that used to be over the bed was now replaced with a glass chandler. In the corner next to the walking closet was a black chair swing, the walk-in closet had been replaced by full-length mirrors, a lovely black vanity with royal blue fuzzy rug remained near the window. In the center of it all had been a king size bed, with royal blue and black silk bedding, as if her grandmother had remembered exactly what colors had been her favorites. One of the most eye-catching parts of the room at to be the secret draws within the bed frame perfect for storing her books. Along the side of the bed on both sides remained two nightstands with silver lamps to back the glass table decor. Tip-Toeing to the master bathroom, Aurora held her breath fearing that she\u2019d wake up and this would all be a dream.</p><p>The master bathroom seemingly matched perfectly to the bedroom\u2019s aesthetic. The walls remained white with black and silver accents along with each piece of furniture, The royal blue was not forgotten as it was the exact shade of the towels and rugs. There was something about the color scheme that gave the women a sense of elegance laced together with relaxation. The cool ceramic flooring cooled the bottom of her feet through her socks as she took in each aspect of the large bathroom. The home was a true dream, and something gave off a feeling she could not quite describe. If she hadn\u2019t known any better, she would have said the home had been completely decorated to meet her preference. However, if this truly was the case, why had she been lead to believe that her grandmother had passed away in a freak accident? There had been so many unknowns regarding the whole situation, for example, why had her grandmother\u2019s medical file been sealed? What type of family secrets was lingering within the family still?</p><p>Starring lazily at the empty black bath, the girl vividly recalled the funeral two weeks prior, and how strange everyone had been acting. From the moment that the family had been alerted of Catherine\u2019s death, so many peculiar behaviors started popping up. It all had started with how her parents demanded that she come home while they had to start planning on how to get her from England back to the United States of America. During a family death, perhaps it was normal to have the whole family come home, however that implied that she had a normal family. But, she didn\u2019t, her family were the type of people who would miss birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries. Nothing was sacred and if there was an opportunity to further the depth of one\u2019s pockets, typically that route would have been taken. There were so many times that she could vividly recall family dinners and parties being canceled, due to someone needing to go prep for another surgery or court case. So, having everyone and the same household until the funeral was beyond strange. Perhaps, thinking that they were all grieving of shorts, the brunette packed her bag and drove the five hours along the interstate to come home to the small town that had the house on the hill.</p><p>Upon her arrival home, Aurora noted the large rain clouds threatening to unleash the built up rain. The clean air had been a smell that she had missed dearly, seeing as in the city in which she now lived in smelt of car\u2019s exhaust, but at the family manner, the scent of pine trees and the lake filled the atmosphere. With the impending rain clouds, the air slowly started to have a more of a lake scent than normal, which signaled that the storm would be one what would be one of destruction. The large unwelcoming brown door of the castle-like home remained unchanged from what she had remembered. Building up her courage, the college student chewed on her lip, before grabbing her phone and backpack.</p><p>Knots formed heavily within her stomach with each step towards the large unwelcoming door frame. Her long brown curly hair blew back in the stormy wind, sending a chill through her spine. Pulling her black cardigan over her black skinny jeans and Aerosmith faded concert t-shirt, the girl pushed the door open fully knowing that she would fully be ridiculed for her choice in clothing regardless of the lack of people in the home. Entering the threshold once again was exactly what Aurora had expected. The home still was uncannily cold and the overpowering scent of the lilacs that undoubtedly decorated every corner of the manor. The old aged rugs remained over the wooden floors as if they truly prevented the original wood floors from harsh bursts of the seasonal weather. Yet, it is nearly impossible to break the family out of its traditional ways. Perhaps that was why Catherine had disappeared off the face of the earth for a full year only to find out she was living a new life across the pond as if the life surrounded by statuses whom only cared about how many green faces lined their Gucci suits. At least, that was what Aurora suspected, and for that, she couldn\u2019t fault her Grandmother. To spend so many years with the heartlessness and cold atmosphere, one still craving life and hope desperately would want to be freed from that prison.</p><p>Right on cue, the sounds of bickering filled the long dreary hall. Exhaling her final piece of peace, the girl dropped her bag down next to the long extravagant staircase. Tucking her hair behind her ears Aurora began her way towards the loud voices whining and complaining down the house. By the sound of the voices, she had been able to pick out her father\u2019s and Uncle Jon\u2019s voice, along with Alana, Jon\u2019s gold-digging wife. Although she could not identify any other voices, Aurora knew all too well that this world war three most likely had a few unsettling viewers. Turning the corner, the small crowd came into focus. Mentally, she had patted herself on the back for correctly identifying her uncle, aunt, and father, yet it was seeing the \u2018family disappointment \u2018 her father\u2019s sister and her small family did confuse her completely. She could have never expected to see her aunt Scarlett, who was nearly blacklisted from every family event due to her decision of leaving the family practice of lawyers and doctors to open up a little cafe with her secret girlfriend and her eighteen-year-old son. Jon and her father swore that Scarlett\u2019s sexuality had nothing to do with the lack of appearances at family functions, yet Scarlett hadn\u2019t come out until midway through the ten years of Catherine\u2019s leave. Suddenly after, her aunt seemingly was removed from any pictures and no longer attended any type of holiday. For a group of Christians and Catholics who claim to believe in God\u2019s love, they sure did like to criticize different people and place themselves above others\u2026 It truly made no sense to Aurora, weren\u2019t they suppose to love everyone?</p><p>With a relieved smile, the youngest female approached her favorite aunt, \u201cI\u2019ve really missed you,\u201d she whispered while engulfing her into an enduring hug full of honesty. From her aunt to Susan and Brandon, Scarlett\u2019s now wife and adopted son, welcoming them with a warm hug knowing well that Alana was continuing to scoff and make remarks regarding the will.</p><p>\u201cAurora, why are you wearing such hideous clothes? You have a much suitable wardrobe to wear, especially seeing as your grandmother\u2019s lawyer is on the way, perhaps you should change, \u201c the nasal sounding woman suggested only gaining an eye roll from Susan.</p><p>\u201cAlana, I\u2019m so glad I was able to take a microbiology final, and then drive three hours to not only deal with my grandmother\u2019s death but to be graced with your not wanted opinion. This may surprise you, but some people don\u2019t automatically think about a will when they get a phone call of a family member\u2019s death. Some us need time to digest the information and remember the individual, but apparently, most of this family disagrees and thinks that if we wait a week that all the money will be gone,\u201d Aurora commented rather hastily bitterly due to the situation of events. For a second, the girl regretted her harsh words, yet she acted it down with the rest of her emotions. After all, if you showed weakness around a pack of wolves, you wouldn\u2019t see the light of day ever again. It was the situations like this, it always was best to wear defensive comments like armor. It was something that she had hated most about this place, she hated having to walk around on thin ice waiting for an argument. At least at school, one wouldn\u2019t have to worry about appearances as much or being treated as an object rather than a person. Back on campus, Aurora could recall several times seeing students in pajamas, or even professors only wearing jeans and the university sweatshirt. The university campus was judgment-free and she deeply missed it. But, there was nothing she could do about that now, she was officially in the wolves den full of wolves waiting and hoping to take a large chunk of the estates and money. Little did anyone realize, by rushing this reading of the will everyone\u2019s lives were about to be changed.</p><p>It was the faint knocking sound that had pulled Aurora out of her trance-like state. Blinking away all the thoughts and memories haunting her large caramel brown eyes, the woman eyes snapped and looked directly into the mirror above the marble sink. She had to admit, she did look fairly rough considering for the last two weeks she had been wearing full face makeup, but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean she looked terrible considering the situation. Her hair was slightly messy from having the windows down the cab, but she had straightened the curly hair before the flight so she wouldn\u2019t look like a complete mess if she fell asleep on the plane, her eyebrows held their natural shape without the colored filler, her eyes had been bloodshot and sad, her olive skin showed it\u2019s imperfections yet it had a healthy glow from being moisturized daily along with being washed. Her black tank top matched with her comfortable Addis joggers, but that was just it, she didn\u2019t stick out. Yes, she did have nice curves, but she wasn\u2019t necessarily anything more than average. She definitely wasn\u2019t beyond beautiful in her book. She wasn\u2019t taller than 5\u20193, she didn\u2019t have sapphires for eyes, her teeth weren\u2019t perfectly white, and she wasn\u2019t a blonde. She was only Aurora Elizabeth Wilde, she was average and came from old money, that was how she had been described since puberty, but that hadn\u2019t meant that it couldn\u2019t change now that she had moved so far away. Perhaps here she could be an actual person rather than someone who comes from money. Once again, the knocking filled the house. Realizing that she had temporarily forgotten about the door, the girl spun on her heels and quickly sprinted towards the front door knowing that the weather app had called for rain in the evening.</p><p>Being as clumsy as she was it didn\u2019t take long for the brunette to accidentally shoulder check the corner wall closet to the front down. \u201cFor fuck sake Rori,\u201d she muttered grumpily as a strong shot of pain radiated from her shoulder and seeing as it was her own fault she couldn\u2019t be mad at anyone but herself. Rubbing circles around her potentially bruised flesh. Not bothering to look through the peephole, the girl swung the door open realizing that she probably shouldn\u2019t just open the door so quickly to strangers, but she felt as though she had been shot, therefore logic was not present at the moment. With furrowed brows, she looked at the people before her. One of the ladies looked maybe in her late forties with the kindest smile and eyes she had ever seen with a nice sundress and her hair pulled up. The other woman had similar bright eyes, dark eyes and had been wearing an old concert t-shirt and jeans. By the looks of it, she had a strong feeling that they were, in fact, mother and daughter, but there was. Something about the duo that caused the woman to sense that she had known them from somewhere.</p><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m Anne and this is my daughter Gemma. We just wanted to introduce ourselves, I live right across the street,\u201d the first woman explained sensing Aurora\u2019s curiosity, \u201cGem had noticed the master bedroom\u2019s light on and we wanted to finally see the face of whom Catherine often spoke of.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to be rude, Aurora kept eye contact with the older woman as Anne spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you both, I\u2019m Aurora,\u201d she responded shaking their hands politely. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a bother, do you mind suggesting some places that have good food around here? Earlier when I was exploring the house I was struggling to find food to cook, it was weird, I fully expected to find an unworldly amount of pasta noodles and sauce to make,\u201d she had commented with a soft laugh while rubbing the back of her neck awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cCatherine always did put things in strange places if you\u2019d like me to show you? One of the last times I was over here we helped her cook, and just everything was in strange places,\u201d Gemma offered.</p><p>\u201cI would really appreciate that, if you don\u2019t mind, of course,\u201d the American commented as she moved over allowing the women into her new home of sorts. In which the girl around her age entered in the house.</p><p>\u201cSilly me, I forgot the spare key and plant I was meaning on bringing over here! I\u2019ll be right back ladies, Gemma message me if you need anything from home.\u201d With the final comment from Anne, the older woman turned rather swiftly and made her way a crossed the street to the house Aurora assumed was hers.</p><p>Softly the brunette shut the front door and followed Gemma towards the kitchen. \u201cDid you grow up here,\u201d Aurora questioned attempting to create small talk between the two of them.</p><p>\u201cYeah, my mum, my brother and I just about all grew up here. It\u2019s not the biggest town, but I personally love it here. But, I might be a little bias, London is nice as well. I live there now, but nowhere is like home, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never left the states besides this, so I kind of get it. I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s a lot different here compared to there. But, I&rsquo;m definitely loving Holmes Chapel\u2019s charm. Everyone I\u2019ve met so far is super kind,\u201d Aurora confessed trying not to flat out say she was glad to be away from her spiteful family for good.</p><p>Reaching the colorful kitchen, Aurora kept close to Gemma as if she feared that the ingredients were in plain sight, in which she would already appear to be a proper idiot. Crouching down next to the stove, Gemma\u2019s soft brown eyes met Aurora\u2019s and a small smile crept along with the British\u2019s facial features. Opening the cabinet\u2019s door, her eyes remained on Aurora before she giggled and spoke, \u201cwho puts bloody pasta noodles by the stove? There should be some jarred pasta sauce on the other side of the stove.\u201d</p><p>Moving to the instructed location Aurora\u2019s eyebrows went up quizzically, but opening it nonetheless opened the cabinet door and took a peak in. Sure enough, there was the pasta sauce and random bottles of wine. With a small shake of the head Aurora muttered in a playful tone, \u201cshe must have been madder than I remember.\u201d Standing back up with the sauce and a bottle of wine, she sat the items on the countertop. \u201cIf you and your mom don\u2019t have dinner plans, you\u2019d be more than welcomed to join me. I haven\u2019t cooked for only myself in what feels like ages, and maybe you can help me find whatever else that crazy American hid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to just let me tell my mom to bring over the pie as well,\u201d Gemma had responded while pulling out her phone sending a quick little message to her mom. \u201cNow, where do you reckon she put the pots and wine glasses?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Laughs echoed off of the walls of the living room, where the three women sat drinking their fair share of wine. Although Aurora had genuinely been nervous to really have the company so soon, she was glad she had opened the front door. Dinner had gone so smoothly, that it had seemed as though they had all knew each other for several years, or as if Aurora had been apart of the family for several years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying Aurora should spend some time in London too, especially if she\u2019s going back to school mum, I didn\u2019t say I was going to kidnap her and never share her with you,\u201d Gemma retorted trying to withhold a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou better not even try it, Gemma, she is my new child who just happens to live only a road away. I am not losing all my children to London,\u201d the mother spoke before sending a small wink to both of the girls.</p><p>Taking another sip of the white wine, Aurora simply surpassed the smile on her face. \u201cYou two are officially my favorite people in the world,\u201d she stated truthfully before speaking again before the others could, \u201cbut on a serious note, I think maybe I\u2019ll stay in Holmes Chapel until I\u2019m settled in and comfortable with my surroundings. Then from there I\u2019ll get a flat out in London for school, and come here for breaks and the weekends. I\u2019m not too sure what the plan will be just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does sound like a good plan, love. London is quite big,\u201d Anne had replied softly.</p><p>Hearing the supportiveness within Anne\u2019s tone had Aurora feeling slightly envious. Was this the supportiveness she had been missing nearly her whole life? Was this what having a mother figure like? Were all mother\u2019s like this? So many questioned clashed within her head as she processed how genuinely kind these people were.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, a black shine had caught Aurora\u2019s attention. Slowly climbing off of the plush sofa, the girl sat her wine glass down on the side table before crawling over to what appeared to be a large box next to a record player. \u201cWoah,\u201d she murmured softly as she got close. Sitting in front of the record player the brunette began to pull out the records. \u201cI had no idea my grandmother had all these,\u201d Aurora trailed off feeling the eyes on her back.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d Gemma had started gaining a small peak over the shoulder from Aurora, who then continued to go through the records in a daze, \u201cthey used to be my brother\u2019s. Near the end, Cat knew how bad her medical condition was getting. Since she had known that she had wanted you to have the house, she started getting the house ready for you. She had my brother and I help plan the new color scheme. She wanted you to feel comfortable and happy. Anyways, one day we were talking about music because Cat kept saying that you needed to have a way to listen to music as you read or cooked. I had suggested a wireless speaker, but he went a little deeper with the question, and had asked what type of music you liked,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember her calling me to ask what music I like, she sounded rushed, but I thought she was having a weird grandma moment that she just wanted to know how I was feeling,\u201d Aurora elaborated slightly while looking up from the records.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I got back with the speaker, Harry had brought over his collection,\u201d Gemma added.</p><p>\u201cTell your brother he has great taste in music, way better than most, but if he wants this all back, my feelings wouldn\u2019t be hurt. I have no idea how he can part from Stevie Nicks, Aerosmith, or the Eagles,\u201d Aurora said referencing some of the albums that she had already pulled out. With a small yawn, the girl slowly removed a vinyl from its case and carefully placed it on to a record player.</p><p>\u201cGem, we should go home, Aurora must be getting tired from her long day, and we are waking her up early tomorrow so we can all go to the bakery in the morning,\u201d Anne commented softly while rising from her spot on the sofa.</p><p>Once she had gotten up from her spot, Anne encouragingly helped Gemma off the lazy boy before planting a friendly kiss on American\u2019s forehead, \u201cwe\u2019ll see you in the morning, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret saying you wanted to get breakfast when she wakes you up tomorrow, so try to get some rest,\u201d Gemma instructed giving the sitting girl a hug.</p><p>By the time that both women had exited the house, Stevie\u2019s legendary voice filled the house. Aurora had managed to force herself off of the floor to the lock the door. It wasn\u2019t until she waved goodnight to her new neighbors that Aurora realized whom she had just spent the evening with. How had it been that she hadn\u2019t made the connection sooner? It hadn\u2019t changed her opinion on the women at all, and yet her younger directioner self was incredibly disappointed that she had met Harry Styles\u2019 family and didn\u2019t realize it. But, in more ways than one, she felt relieved that she hadn\u2019t until their departure if she had then she may have felt the need to act more reserved than normal. At least they had met the real her as she had with them.</p><p>Yet, subconsciously she was trying hard to keep her cool, she had Harry Styles\u2019 private vinyl collection. Was this actually real?</p>",

You never know what you\u2019ll get when it comes to life in reality. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll know exactly what you want to do with your life before life has the chance to royally fuck you up. However, most aren\u2019t that lucky. Most are the indecisive people who just are going through this roller coaster with blindfolds, with no idea what\u2019s coming next. Yet, a roller coaster isn\u2019t the correct this type of life. In more ways, it feels as though life is just a foggy black and white haze until something adds color.</p><p>Perhaps that\u2019s why so many people prefer books and stories of fiction, it\u2019s a way to escape the uncertainty of life itself, a way to pretend that everything is actually indeed \u2018fine\u2019. At least that\u2019s how Aurora felt about it at least. Her books and music were her safe haven. With a good book in hand and her music playing, the world would just pause, even if it was for only thirty minutes, it was an escape. Perhaps it was the flow of the words that caused the young adult to feel free. Or perhaps it had to do with the fact that each character had a unique story and lesson to share. No matter the reasoning, the brunette nearly always had a book on her. Of course, she couldn\u2019t always carry a physical book on her person, but who needed to when smartphones could give you everything you could ever need.</p><p>Although books provide the girl with a blissful escape, it was also those same books that had made her content with the lack of social life since she had moved to the wet nation known as Britain. Being an American, she had very little knowledge of what to expect. After all, most of her knowledge of the country came from the television show Skins along with the Harry Potter series. But, with her very stubborn and rather particular grandmother\u2019s passing, the young twenty-one-year-old had been gifted not only the full inheritance, but her grandmother\u2019s cottage of sorts however to receive both items the girl would have to move to England. Sure, the older woman had adored her granddaughter, however Aurora suspected the will was just a final lesson, that Catherine could give her children on her death bed, what way could she punish money hungry children besides not giving them more than a final word of advice and a dime for the amount of times that they had tried to reach out in her old age. Compared to her bright-eyed granddaughter who tried to call every other week just to speak of schooling or of a novel she was reading. Although, being a college student was not easy by any means yet it was no one\u2019s fault but her own for changing her major twice. Her mess, her responsibility; how could she expect anyone to clean up her mess? Therefore, she had been balancing working part-time with being a full-time student. Her grandmother\u2019s final gift to the young woman was something that Aurora had never anticipated; a chance to start over. With the home and money all put into her name, her family was not thrilled whatsoever, yet Aurora knew that she couldn\u2019t disappoint the one person who listened about the stories she had been reading. So, the girl moved from the small town she was raised in and essentially moved crossed the world. Fully knowing from that moment her family could potentially outcast her.</p><p>Holmes Chapel, the town in which the well known Harry Styles grew up. The town isn\u2019t necessarily smaller or bigger than the small town Aurora grew up in back in America, yet there was something about the British people that made this place feel so much more knitted together. At least in the neighborhood, her grandmother had lived in seemed so close to give the illusion that each person in some way or another were like family to one another. It\u2019s no secret back home that if a young university student had moved into a residential neighborhood, some residents would complain and assume their nice quiet neighborhood would be turned into a loud obnoxious party house lowering their property values; yet here not even an hour after her cab had dropped her off at the royal blue medium sized home with the white wrap around porch that the swing next to the dark wooden door, a few neighbors had greeted her an apologized for her loss. It felt bewildering to the girl, who was always taught that it was best to keep some distance between yourself and neighbors. It simply was the way to resume privacy, but in more ways than one it was a form of isolation and nothing more. It was a way that helped build rumors, cliques, and forms judgment precursors that overtime cause unnecessary tensions over a shrub or a little fence. Looking back at the do\u2019s and don\u2019t of the pompous life that her family had created seemed rather ridiculous now. If one were to hide away in a house with no communication with neighbors, your just another robot living the social media life, everything looks perfect on the outside, while behind closed doors everything is falling to pieces with a blood-curdling scream. Besides, if no one is allowed or good enough to be in your life, what\u2019s the point of human contact? Perhaps, that is why so many people are always so miserable, it would be exhausting to constantly be something you weren\u2019t. Aurora knew that all too well for her young age, but as much as she hated to admit it, she almost did not know not how to \u2018fake it until she made it\u2019. After all that was a concept that she had learned from such a young age, girls were to smile and to be what was expected of them. Yet, with a sense of the rest button being hit in her life, the brunette finally could be who she had always wanted, and no one could force her to be anything else different.</p><p>By the exterior of the home, the house appeared to be well kept and with perfect order. Some of the plants were overgrown and dead, yet with the winter chill and slight dusting coat of snow, the demise of the plants made sense truly. It still appeared to look perfectly in order. Even when you initially enter the home everything looks as if it has a particular order. The walls are coated in what looks to be fresh grey paint and select a few picture frames to decorate the home as though only a few of the innocent moments in deserved to be relived. A black fireplace captured the living room with one swallow, with no television, and all the soft white fabric sofas angling around the fire provided a feeling of close intimacy to those who had been welcomed into the humble abode. Along the entryway of the home remained to be one of the things Aurora had always wanted in a home, a window seat, or as she called it, \u2018the most profit spot to read as it rained outside\u2019. As she stood smiling at the cushioned window, the girl could almost already hear the rain pelting against the glass cooling the world around her down as she melted away into a fantasy. Pulling herself out of her daydream, the women tossed her jean jacket on to the rocking chair closest to the black marble fireplace, while her luggage remained by the front door. Although she had sworn to break her bad habits, Aurora knew all too well she probably wouldn\u2019t unpack right away. But, how could she unpack when she still had to explore the large house?</p><p>For what felt like hours the five foot and three inches female wandered the home, first she had discovered the kitchen, arguably the most important room of the whole house. It was brighter than the living room, and somewhat expectedly the room was coated in a ray of soft sunshine yellow and the white marble had such a large contrast to the living room that she truly did not know what to expect. She could remember her grandmother telling her that one should not decorate to please people, but decorated from to please soul because if one did this then you\u2019d always feel at home no matter who is around. As she roamed further into the home she had found the half bath, guest bathroom, and guest room which were all various shades of creams to grey. Each room regardless of the paint of the walls had a bright burst of color which shouted at life and yet had something relaxing laced together with it as well.</p><p>Her soft white shocks made no noise as she took slow and gentle steps towards the final door, which the girl presumed to be the master bedroom. Taking in a large intake of hair, the girl with the messy brown hair rested her forehead against the white door. Finding some courage, her hand grasped the doorknob before carefully pushing the door into the room. Her caramel brown eyes grew to the size of saucers at the sight before her. This was nothing that she had expected for the room to look like, after all the last time she had FaceTime with her grandmother, this room had been painted a shade of bright red and covered with lace. Now, however, the walls were white as snow. The fan that used to be over the bed was now replaced with a glass chandler. In the corner next to the walking closet was a black chair swing, the walk-in closet had been replaced by full-length mirrors, a lovely black vanity with royal blue fuzzy rug remained near the window. In the center of it all had been a king size bed, with royal blue and black silk bedding, as if her grandmother had remembered exactly what colors had been her favorites. One of the most eye-catching parts of the room at to be the secret draws within the bed frame perfect for storing her books. Along the side of the bed on both sides remained two nightstands with silver lamps to back the glass table decor. Tip-Toeing to the master bathroom, Aurora held her breath fearing that she\u2019d wake up and this would all be a dream.</p><p>The master bathroom seemingly matched perfectly to the bedroom\u2019s aesthetic. The walls remained white with black and silver accents along with each piece of furniture, The royal blue was not forgotten as it was the exact shade of the towels and rugs. There was something about the color scheme that gave the women a sense of elegance laced together with relaxation. The cool ceramic flooring cooled the bottom of her feet through her socks as she took in each aspect of the large bathroom. The home was a true dream, and something gave off a feeling she could not quite describe. If she hadn\u2019t known any better, she would have said the home had been completely decorated to meet her preference. However, if this truly was the case, why had she been lead to believe that her grandmother had passed away in a freak accident? There had been so many unknowns regarding the whole situation, for example, why had her grandmother\u2019s medical file been sealed? What type of family secrets was lingering within the family still?</p><p>Starring lazily at the empty black bath, the girl vividly recalled the funeral two weeks prior, and how strange everyone had been acting. From the moment that the family had been alerted of Catherine\u2019s death, so many peculiar behaviors started popping up. It all had started with how her parents demanded that she come home while they had to start planning on how to get her from England back to the United States of America. During a family death, perhaps it was normal to have the whole family come home, however that implied that she had a normal family. But, she didn\u2019t, her family were the type of people who would miss birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries. Nothing was sacred and if there was an opportunity to further the depth of one\u2019s pockets, typically that route would have been taken. There were so many times that she could vividly recall family dinners and parties being canceled, due to someone needing to go prep for another surgery or court case. So, having everyone and the same household until the funeral was beyond strange. Perhaps, thinking that they were all grieving of shorts, the brunette packed her bag and drove the five hours along the interstate to come home to the small town that had the house on the hill.</p><p>Upon her arrival home, Aurora noted the large rain clouds threatening to unleash the built up rain. The clean air had been a smell that she had missed dearly, seeing as in the city in which she now lived in smelt of car\u2019s exhaust, but at the family manner, the scent of pine trees and the lake filled the atmosphere. With the impending rain clouds, the air slowly started to have a more of a lake scent than normal, which signaled that the storm would be one what would be one of destruction. The large unwelcoming brown door of the castle-like home remained unchanged from what she had remembered. Building up her courage, the college student chewed on her lip, before grabbing her phone and backpack.</p><p>Knots formed heavily within her stomach with each step towards the large unwelcoming door frame. Her long brown curly hair blew back in the stormy wind, sending a chill through her spine. Pulling her black cardigan over her black skinny jeans and Aerosmith faded concert t-shirt, the girl pushed the door open fully knowing that she would fully be ridiculed for her choice in clothing regardless of the lack of people in the home. Entering the threshold once again was exactly what Aurora had expected. The home still was uncannily cold and the overpowering scent of the lilacs that undoubtedly decorated every corner of the manor. The old aged rugs remained over the wooden floors as if they truly prevented the original wood floors from harsh bursts of the seasonal weather. Yet, it is nearly impossible to break the family out of its traditional ways. Perhaps that was why Catherine had disappeared off the face of the earth for a full year only to find out she was living a new life across the pond as if the life surrounded by statuses whom only cared about how many green faces lined their Gucci suits. At least, that was what Aurora suspected, and for that, she couldn\u2019t fault her Grandmother. To spend so many years with the heartlessness and cold atmosphere, one still craving life and hope desperately would want to be freed from that prison.</p><p>Right on cue, the sounds of bickering filled the long dreary hall. Exhaling her final piece of peace, the girl dropped her bag down next to the long extravagant staircase. Tucking her hair behind her ears Aurora began her way towards the loud voices whining and complaining down the house. By the sound of the voices, she had been able to pick out her father\u2019s and Uncle Jon\u2019s voice, along with Alana, Jon\u2019s gold-digging wife. Although she could not identify any other voices, Aurora knew all too well that this world war three most likely had a few unsettling viewers. Turning the corner, the small crowd came into focus. Mentally, she had patted herself on the back for correctly identifying her uncle, aunt, and father, yet it was seeing the \u2018family disappointment \u2018 her father\u2019s sister and her small family did confuse her completely. She could have never expected to see her aunt Scarlett, who was nearly blacklisted from every family event due to her decision of leaving the family practice of lawyers and doctors to open up a little cafe with her secret girlfriend and her eighteen-year-old son. Jon and her father swore that Scarlett\u2019s sexuality had nothing to do with the lack of appearances at family functions, yet Scarlett hadn\u2019t come out until midway through the ten years of Catherine\u2019s leave. Suddenly after, her aunt seemingly was removed from any pictures and no longer attended any type of holiday. For a group of Christians and Catholics who claim to believe in God\u2019s love, they sure did like to criticize different people and place themselves above others\u2026 It truly made no sense to Aurora, weren\u2019t they suppose to love everyone?</p><p>With a relieved smile, the youngest female approached her favorite aunt, \u201cI\u2019ve really missed you,\u201d she whispered while engulfing her into an enduring hug full of honesty. From her aunt to Susan and Brandon, Scarlett\u2019s now wife and adopted son, welcoming them with a warm hug knowing well that Alana was continuing to scoff and make remarks regarding the will.</p><p>\u201cAurora, why are you wearing such hideous clothes? You have a much suitable wardrobe to wear, especially seeing as your grandmother\u2019s lawyer is on the way, perhaps you should change, \u201c the nasal sounding woman suggested only gaining an eye roll from Susan.</p><p>\u201cAlana, I\u2019m so glad I was able to take a microbiology final, and then drive three hours to not only deal with my grandmother\u2019s death but to be graced with your not wanted opinion. This may surprise you, but some people don\u2019t automatically think about a will when they get a phone call of a family member\u2019s death. Some us need time to digest the information and remember the individual, but apparently, most of this family disagrees and thinks that if we wait a week that all the money will be gone,\u201d Aurora commented rather hastily bitterly due to the situation of events. For a second, the girl regretted her harsh words, yet she acted it down with the rest of her emotions. After all, if you showed weakness around a pack of wolves, you wouldn\u2019t see the light of day ever again. It was the situations like this, it always was best to wear defensive comments like armor. It was something that she had hated most about this place, she hated having to walk around on thin ice waiting for an argument. At least at school, one wouldn\u2019t have to worry about appearances as much or being treated as an object rather than a person. Back on campus, Aurora could recall several times seeing students in pajamas, or even professors only wearing jeans and the university sweatshirt. The university campus was judgment-free and she deeply missed it. But, there was nothing she could do about that now, she was officially in the wolves den full of wolves waiting and hoping to take a large chunk of the estates and money. Little did anyone realize, by rushing this reading of the will everyone\u2019s lives were about to be changed.</p><p>It was the faint knocking sound that had pulled Aurora out of her trance-like state. Blinking away all the thoughts and memories haunting her large caramel brown eyes, the woman eyes snapped and looked directly into the mirror above the marble sink. She had to admit, she did look fairly rough considering for the last two weeks she had been wearing full face makeup, but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean she looked terrible considering the situation. Her hair was slightly messy from having the windows down the cab, but she had straightened the curly hair before the flight so she wouldn\u2019t look like a complete mess if she fell asleep on the plane, her eyebrows held their natural shape without the colored filler, her eyes had been bloodshot and sad, her olive skin showed it\u2019s imperfections yet it had a healthy glow from being moisturized daily along with being washed. Her black tank top matched with her comfortable Addis joggers, but that was just it, she didn\u2019t stick out. Yes, she did have nice curves, but she wasn\u2019t necessarily anything more than average. She definitely wasn\u2019t beyond beautiful in her book. She wasn\u2019t taller than 5\u20193, she didn\u2019t have sapphires for eyes, her teeth weren\u2019t perfectly white, and she wasn\u2019t a blonde. She was only Aurora Elizabeth Wilde, she was average and came from old money, that was how she had been described since puberty, but that hadn\u2019t meant that it couldn\u2019t change now that she had moved so far away. Perhaps here she could be an actual person rather than someone who comes from money. Once again, the knocking filled the house. Realizing that she had temporarily forgotten about the door, the girl spun on her heels and quickly sprinted towards the front door knowing that the weather app had called for rain in the evening.</p><p>Being as clumsy as she was it didn\u2019t take long for the brunette to accidentally shoulder check the corner wall closet to the front down. \u201cFor fuck sake Rori,\u201d she muttered grumpily as a strong shot of pain radiated from her shoulder and seeing as it was her own fault she couldn\u2019t be mad at anyone but herself. Rubbing circles around her potentially bruised flesh. Not bothering to look through the peephole, the girl swung the door open realizing that she probably shouldn\u2019t just open the door so quickly to strangers, but she felt as though she had been shot, therefore logic was not present at the moment. With furrowed brows, she looked at the people before her. One of the ladies looked maybe in her late forties with the kindest smile and eyes she had ever seen with a nice sundress and her hair pulled up. The other woman had similar bright eyes, dark eyes and had been wearing an old concert t-shirt and jeans. By the looks of it, she had a strong feeling that they were, in fact, mother and daughter, but there was. Something about the duo that caused the woman to sense that she had known them from somewhere.</p><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m Anne and this is my daughter Gemma. We just wanted to introduce ourselves, I live right across the street,\u201d the first woman explained sensing Aurora\u2019s curiosity, \u201cGem had noticed the master bedroom\u2019s light on and we wanted to finally see the face of whom Catherine often spoke of.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to be rude, Aurora kept eye contact with the older woman as Anne spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you both, I\u2019m Aurora,\u201d she responded shaking their hands politely. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a bother, do you mind suggesting some places that have good food around here? Earlier when I was exploring the house I was struggling to find food to cook, it was weird, I fully expected to find an unworldly amount of pasta noodles and sauce to make,\u201d she had commented with a soft laugh while rubbing the back of her neck awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cCatherine always did put things in strange places if you\u2019d like me to show you? One of the last times I was over here we helped her cook, and just everything was in strange places,\u201d Gemma offered.</p><p>\u201cI would really appreciate that, if you don\u2019t mind, of course,\u201d the American commented as she moved over allowing the women into her new home of sorts. In which the girl around her age entered in the house.</p><p>\u201cSilly me, I forgot the spare key and plant I was meaning on bringing over here! I\u2019ll be right back ladies, Gemma message me if you need anything from home.\u201d With the final comment from Anne, the older woman turned rather swiftly and made her way a crossed the street to the house Aurora assumed was hers.</p><p>Softly the brunette shut the front door and followed Gemma towards the kitchen. \u201cDid you grow up here,\u201d Aurora questioned attempting to create small talk between the two of them.</p><p>\u201cYeah, my mum, my brother and I just about all grew up here. It\u2019s not the biggest town, but I personally love it here. But, I might be a little bias, London is nice as well. I live there now, but nowhere is like home, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never left the states besides this, so I kind of get it. I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s a lot different here compared to there. But, I\u2019m definitely loving Holmes Chapel\u2019s charm. Everyone I\u2019ve met so far is super kind,\u201d Aurora confessed trying not to flat out say she was glad to be away from her spiteful family for good.</p><p>Reaching the colorful kitchen, Aurora kept close to Gemma as if she feared that the ingredients were in plain sight, in which she would already appear to be a proper idiot. Crouching down next to the stove, Gemma\u2019s soft brown eyes met Aurora\u2019s and a small smile crept along with the British\u2019s facial features. Opening the cabinet\u2019s door, her eyes remained on Aurora before she giggled and spoke, \u201cwho puts bloody pasta noodles by the stove? There should be some jarred pasta sauce on the other side of the stove.\u201d</p><p>Moving to the instructed location Aurora\u2019s eyebrows went up quizzically, but opening it nonetheless opened the cabinet door and took a peak in. Sure enough, there was the pasta sauce and random bottles of wine. With a small shake of the head Aurora muttered in a playful tone, \u201cshe must have been madder than I remember.\u201d Standing back up with the sauce and a bottle of wine, she sat the items on the countertop. \u201cIf you and your mom don\u2019t have dinner plans, you\u2019d be more than welcomed to join me. I haven\u2019t cooked for only myself in what feels like ages, and maybe you can help me find whatever else that crazy American hid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to just let me tell my mom to bring over the pie as well,\u201d Gemma had responded while pulling out her phone sending a quick little message to her mom. \u201cNow, where do you reckon she put the pots and wine glasses?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Laughs echoed off of the walls of the living room, where the three women sat drinking their fair share of wine. Although Aurora had genuinely been nervous to really have the company so soon, she was glad she had opened the front door. Dinner had gone so smoothly, that it had seemed as though they had all knew each other for several years, or as if Aurora had been apart of the family for several years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying Aurora should spend some time in London too, especially if she\u2019s going back to school mum, I didn\u2019t say I was going to kidnap her and never share her with you,\u201d Gemma retorted trying to withhold a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou better not even try it, Gemma, she is my new child who just happens to live only a road away. I am not losing all my children to London,\u201d the mother spoke before sending a small wink to both of the girls.</p><p>Taking another sip of the white wine, Aurora simply surpassed the smile on her face. \u201cYou two are officially my favorite people in the world,\u201d she stated truthfully before speaking again before the others could, \u201cbut on a serious note, I think maybe I\u2019ll stay in Holmes Chapel until I\u2019m settled in and comfortable with my surroundings. Then from there I\u2019ll get a flat out in London for school, and come here for breaks and the weekends. I\u2019m not too sure what the plan will be just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does sound like a good plan, love. London is quite big,\u201d Anne had replied softly.</p><p>Hearing the supportiveness within Anne\u2019s tone had Aurora feeling slightly envious. Was this the supportiveness she had been missing nearly her whole life? Was this what having a mother figure like? Were all mother\u2019s like this? So many questioned clashed within her head as she processed how genuinely kind these people were.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, a black shine had caught Aurora\u2019s attention. Slowly climbing off of the plush sofa, the girl sat her wine glass down on the side table before crawling over to what appeared to be a large box next to a record player. \u201cWoah,\u201d she murmured softly as she got close. Sitting in front of the record player the brunette began to pull out the records. \u201cI had no idea my grandmother had all these,\u201d Aurora trailed off feeling the eyes on her back.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d Gemma had started gaining a small peak over the shoulder from Aurora, who then continued to go through the records in a daze, \u201cthey used to be my brother\u2019s. Near the end, Cat knew how bad her medical condition was getting. Since she had known that she had wanted you to have the house, she started getting the house ready for you. She had my brother and I help plan the new color scheme. She wanted you to feel comfortable and happy. Anyways, one day we were talking about music because Cat kept saying that you needed to have a way to listen to music as you read or cooked. I had suggested a wireless speaker, but he went a little deeper with the question, and had asked what type of music you liked,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember her calling me to ask what music I like, she sounded rushed, but I thought she was having a weird grandma moment that she just wanted to know how I was feeling,\u201d Aurora elaborated slightly while looking up from the records.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I got back with the speaker, Harry had brought over his collection,\u201d Gemma added.</p><p>\u201cTell your brother he has great taste in music, way better than most, but if he wants this all back, my feelings wouldn\u2019t be hurt. I have no idea how he can part from Stevie Nicks, Aerosmith, or the Eagles,\u201d Aurora said referencing some of the albums that she had already pulled out. With a small yawn, the girl slowly removed a vinyl from its case and carefully placed it on to a record player.</p><p>\u201cGem, we should go home, Aurora must be getting tired from her long day, and we are waking her up early tomorrow so we can all go to the bakery in the morning,\u201d Anne commented softly while rising from her spot on the sofa.</p><p>Once she had gotten up from her spot, Anne encouragingly helped Gemma off the lazy boy before planting a friendly kiss on American\u2019s forehead, \u201cwe\u2019ll see you in the morning, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret saying you wanted to get breakfast when she wakes you up tomorrow, so try to get some rest,\u201d Gemma instructed giving the sitting girl a hug.</p><p>By the time that both women had exited the house, Stevie\u2019s legendary voice filled the house. Aurora had managed to force herself off of the floor to the lock the door. It wasn\u2019t until she waved goodnight to her new neighbors that Aurora realized whom she had just spent the evening with. How had it been that she hadn\u2019t made the connection sooner? It hadn\u2019t changed her opinion on the women at all, and yet her younger directioner self was incredibly disappointed that she had met Harry Styles\u2019 family and didn\u2019t realize it. But, in more ways than one, she felt relieved that she hadn\u2019t until their departure if she had then she may have felt the need to act more reserved than normal. At least they had met the real her as she had with them.</p><p>Yet, subconsciously she was trying hard to keep her cool, she had Harry Styles\u2019 private vinyl collection. Was this actually real?</p>",

You never know what you\u2019ll get when it comes to life in reality. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll know exactly what you want to do with your life before life has the chance to royally fuck you up. However, most aren\u2019t that lucky. Most are the indecisive people who just are going through this roller coaster with blindfolds, with no idea what\u2019s coming next. Yet, a roller coaster isn\u2019t the correct this type of life. In more ways, it feels as though life is just a foggy black and white haze until something adds color.</p><p>Perhaps that\u2019s why so many people prefer books and stories of fiction, it\u2019s a way to escape the uncertainty of life itself, a way to pretend that everything is actually indeed \u2018fine\u2019. At least that\u2019s how Aurora felt about it at least. Her books and music were her safe haven. With a good book in hand and her music playing, the world would just pause, even if it was for only thirty minutes, it was an escape. Perhaps it was the flow of the words that caused the young adult to feel free. Or perhaps it had to do with the fact that each character had a unique story and lesson to share. No matter the reasoning, the brunette nearly always had a book on her. Of course, she couldn\u2019t always carry a physical book on her person, but who needed to when smartphones could give you everything you could ever need.</p><p>Although books provide the girl with a blissful escape, it was also those same books that had made her content with the lack of social life since she had moved to the wet nation known as Britain. Being an American, she had very little knowledge of what to expect. After all, most of her knowledge of the country came from the television show Skins along with the Harry Potter series. But, with her very stubborn and rather particular grandmother\u2019s passing, the young twenty-one-year-old had been gifted not only the full inheritance, but her grandmother\u2019s cottage of sorts however to receive both items the girl would have to move to England. Sure, the older woman had adored her granddaughter, however Aurora suspected the will was just a final lesson, that Catherine could give her children on her death bed, what way could she punish money hungry children besides not giving them more than a final word of advice and a dime for the amount of times that they had tried to reach out in her old age. Compared to her bright-eyed granddaughter who tried to call every other week just to speak of schooling or of a novel she was reading. Although, being a college student was not easy by any means yet it was no one\u2019s fault but her own for changing her major twice. Her mess, her responsibility; how could she expect anyone to clean up her mess? Therefore, she had been balancing working part-time with being a full-time student. Her grandmother\u2019s final gift to the young woman was something that Aurora had never anticipated; a chance to start over. With the home and money all put into her name, her family was not thrilled whatsoever, yet Aurora knew that she couldn\u2019t disappoint the one person who listened about the stories she had been reading. So, the girl moved from the small town she was raised in and essentially moved crossed the world. Fully knowing from that moment her family could potentially outcast her.</p><p>Holmes Chapel, the town in which the well known Harry Styles grew up. The town isn\u2019t necessarily smaller or bigger than the small town Aurora grew up in back in America, yet there was something about the British people that made this place feel so much more knitted together. At least in the neighborhood, her grandmother had lived in seemed so close to give the illusion that each person in some way or another were like family to one another. It\u2019s no secret back home that if a young university student had moved into a residential neighborhood, some residents would complain and assume their nice quiet neighborhood would be turned into a loud obnoxious party house lowering their property values; yet here not even an hour after her cab had dropped her off at the royal blue medium sized home with the white wrap around porch that the swing next to the dark wooden door, a few neighbors had greeted her an apologized for her loss. It felt bewildering to the girl, who was always taught that it was best to keep some distance between yourself and neighbors. It simply was the way to resume privacy, but in more ways than one it was a form of isolation and nothing more. It was a way that helped build rumors, cliques, and forms judgment precursors that overtime cause unnecessary tensions over a shrub or a little fence. Looking back at the do\u2019s and don\u2019t of the pompous life that her family had created seemed rather ridiculous now. If one were to hide away in a house with no communication with neighbors, your just another robot living the social media life, everything looks perfect on the outside, while behind closed doors everything is falling to pieces with a blood-curdling scream. Besides, if no one is allowed or good enough to be in your life, what\u2019s the point of human contact? Perhaps, that is why so many people are always so miserable, it would be exhausting to constantly be something you weren\u2019t. Aurora knew that all too well for her young age, but as much as she hated to admit it, she almost did not know not how to \u2018fake it until she made it\u2019. After all that was a concept that she had learned from such a young age, girls were to smile and to be what was expected of them. Yet, with a sense of the rest button being hit in her life, the brunette finally could be who she had always wanted, and no one could force her to be anything else different.</p><p>By the exterior of the home, the house appeared to be well kept and with perfect order. Some of the plants were overgrown and dead, yet with the winter chill and slight dusting coat of snow, the demise of the plants made sense truly. It still appeared to look perfectly in order. Even when you initially enter the home everything looks as if it has a particular order. The walls are coated in what looks to be fresh grey paint and select a few picture frames to decorate the home as though only a few of the innocent moments in deserved to be relived. A black fireplace captured the living room with one swallow, with no television, and all the soft white fabric sofas angling around the fire provided a feeling of close intimacy to those who had been welcomed into the humble abode. Along the entryway of the home remained to be one of the things Aurora had always wanted in a home, a window seat, or as she called it, \u2018the most profit spot to read as it rained outside\u2019. As she stood smiling at the cushioned window, the girl could almost already hear the rain pelting against the glass cooling the world around her down as she melted away into a fantasy. Pulling herself out of her daydream, the women tossed her jean jacket on to the rocking chair closest to the black marble fireplace, while her luggage remained by the front door. Although she had sworn to break her bad habits, Aurora knew all too well she probably wouldn\u2019t unpack right away. But, how could she unpack when she still had to explore the large house?</p><p>For what felt like hours the five foot and three inches female wandered the home, first she had discovered the kitchen, arguably the most important room of the whole house. It was brighter than the living room, and somewhat expectedly the room was coated in a ray of soft sunshine yellow and the white marble had such a large contrast to the living room that she truly did not know what to expect. She could remember her grandmother telling her that one should not decorate to please people, but decorated from to please soul because if one did this then you\u2019d always feel at home no matter who is around. As she roamed further into the home she had found the half bath, guest bathroom, and guest room which were all various shades of creams to grey. Each room regardless of the paint of the walls had a bright burst of color which shouted at life and yet had something relaxing laced together with it as well.</p><p>Her soft white shocks made no noise as she took slow and gentle steps towards the final door, which the girl presumed to be the master bedroom. Taking in a large intake of hair, the girl with the messy brown hair rested her forehead against the white door. Finding some courage, her hand grasped the doorknob before carefully pushing the door into the room. Her caramel brown eyes grew to the size of saucers at the sight before her. This was nothing that she had expected for the room to look like, after all the last time she had FaceTime with her grandmother, this room had been painted a shade of bright red and covered with lace. Now, however, the walls were white as snow. The fan that used to be over the bed was now replaced with a glass chandler. In the corner next to the walking closet was a black chair swing, the walk-in closet had been replaced by full-length mirrors, a lovely black vanity with royal blue fuzzy rug remained near the window. In the center of it all had been a king size bed, with royal blue and black silk bedding, as if her grandmother had remembered exactly what colors had been her favorites. One of the most eye-catching parts of the room at to be the secret draws within the bed frame perfect for storing her books. Along the side of the bed on both sides remained two nightstands with silver lamps to back the glass table decor. Tip-Toeing to the master bathroom, Aurora held her breath fearing that she\u2019d wake up and this would all be a dream.</p><p>The master bathroom seemingly matched perfectly to the bedroom\u2019s aesthetic. The walls remained white with black and silver accents along with each piece of furniture, The royal blue was not forgotten as it was the exact shade of the towels and rugs. There was something about the color scheme that gave the women a sense of elegance laced together with relaxation. The cool ceramic flooring cooled the bottom of her feet through her socks as she took in each aspect of the large bathroom. The home was a true dream, and something gave off a feeling she could not quite describe. If she hadn\u2019t known any better, she would have said the home had been completely decorated to meet her preference. However, if this truly was the case, why had she been lead to believe that her grandmother had passed away in a freak accident? There had been so many unknowns regarding the whole situation, for example, why had her grandmother\u2019s medical file been sealed? What type of family secrets was lingering within the family still?</p><p>Starring lazily at the empty black bath, the girl vividly recalled the funeral two weeks prior, and how strange everyone had been acting. From the moment that the family had been alerted of Catherine\u2019s death, so many peculiar behaviors started popping up. It all had started with how her parents demanded that she come home while they had to start planning on how to get her from England back to the United States of America. During a family death, perhaps it was normal to have the whole family come home, however that implied that she had a normal family. But, she didn\u2019t, her family were the type of people who would miss birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries. Nothing was sacred and if there was an opportunity to further the depth of one\u2019s pockets, typically that route would have been taken. There were so many times that she could vividly recall family dinners and parties being canceled, due to someone needing to go prep for another surgery or court case. So, having everyone and the same household until the funeral was beyond strange. Perhaps, thinking that they were all grieving of shorts, the brunette packed her bag and drove the five hours along the interstate to come home to the small town that had the house on the hill.</p><p>Upon her arrival home, Aurora noted the large rain clouds threatening to unleash the built up rain. The clean air had been a smell that she had missed dearly, seeing as in the city in which she now lived in smelt of car\u2019s exhaust, but at the family manner, the scent of pine trees and the lake filled the atmosphere. With the impending rain clouds, the air slowly started to have a more of a lake scent than normal, which signaled that the storm would be one what would be one of destruction. The large unwelcoming brown door of the castle-like home remained unchanged from what she had remembered. Building up her courage, the college student chewed on her lip, before grabbing her phone and backpack.</p><p>Knots formed heavily within her stomach with each step towards the large unwelcoming door frame. Her long brown curly hair blew back in the stormy wind, sending a chill through her spine. Pulling her black cardigan over her black skinny jeans and Aerosmith faded concert t-shirt, the girl pushed the door open fully knowing that she would fully be ridiculed for her choice in clothing regardless of the lack of people in the home. Entering the threshold once again was exactly what Aurora had expected. The home still was uncannily cold and the overpowering scent of the lilacs that undoubtedly decorated every corner of the manor. The old aged rugs remained over the wooden floors as if they truly prevented the original wood floors from harsh bursts of the seasonal weather. Yet, it is nearly impossible to break the family out of its traditional ways. Perhaps that was why Catherine had disappeared off the face of the earth for a full year only to find out she was living a new life across the pond as if the life surrounded by statuses whom only cared about how many green faces lined their Gucci suits. At least, that was what Aurora suspected, and for that, she couldn\u2019t fault her Grandmother. To spend so many years with the heartlessness and cold atmosphere, one still craving life and hope desperately would want to be freed from that prison.</p><p>Right on cue, the sounds of bickering filled the long dreary hall. Exhaling her final piece of peace, the girl dropped her bag down next to the long extravagant staircase. Tucking her hair behind her ears Aurora began her way towards the loud voices whining and complaining down the house. By the sound of the voices, she had been able to pick out her father\u2019s and Uncle Jon\u2019s voice, along with Alana, Jon\u2019s gold-digging wife. Although she could not identify any other voices, Aurora knew all too well that this world war three most likely had a few unsettling viewers. Turning the corner, the small crowd came into focus. Mentally, she had patted herself on the back for correctly identifying her uncle, aunt, and father, yet it was seeing the \u2018family disappointment \u2018 her father\u2019s sister and her small family did confuse her completely. She could have never expected to see her aunt Scarlett, who was nearly blacklisted from every family event due to her decision of leaving the family practice of lawyers and doctors to open up a little cafe with her secret girlfriend and her eighteen-year-old son. Jon and her father swore that Scarlett\u2019s sexuality had nothing to do with the lack of appearances at family functions, yet Scarlett hadn\u2019t come out until midway through the ten years of Catherine\u2019s leave. Suddenly after, her aunt seemingly was removed from any pictures and no longer attended any type of holiday. For a group of Christians and Catholics who claim to believe in God\u2019s love, they sure did like to criticize different people and place themselves above others\u2026 It truly made no sense to Aurora, weren\u2019t they suppose to love everyone?</p><p>With a relieved smile, the youngest female approached her favorite aunt, \u201cI\u2019ve really missed you,\u201d she whispered while engulfing her into an enduring hug full of honesty. From her aunt to Susan and Brandon, Scarlett\u2019s now wife and adopted son, welcoming them with a warm hug knowing well that Alana was continuing to scoff and make remarks regarding the will.</p><p>\u201cAurora, why are you wearing such hideous clothes? You have a much suitable wardrobe to wear, especially seeing as your grandmother\u2019s lawyer is on the way, perhaps you should change, \u201c the nasal sounding woman suggested only gaining an eye roll from Susan.</p><p>\u201cAlana, I\u2019m so glad I was able to take a microbiology final, and then drive three hours to not only deal with my grandmother\u2019s death but to be graced with your not wanted opinion. This may surprise you, but some people don\u2019t automatically think about a will when they get a phone call of a family member\u2019s death. Some us need time to digest the information and remember the individual, but apparently, most of this family disagrees and thinks that if we wait a week that all the money will be gone,\u201d Aurora commented rather hastily bitterly due to the situation of events. For a second, the girl regretted her harsh words, yet she acted it down with the rest of her emotions. After all, if you showed weakness around a pack of wolves, you wouldn\u2019t see the light of day ever again. It was the situations like this, it always was best to wear defensive comments like armor. It was something that she had hated most about this place, she hated having to walk around on thin ice waiting for an argument. At least at school, one wouldn\u2019t have to worry about appearances as much or being treated as an object rather than a person. Back on campus, Aurora could recall several times seeing students in pajamas, or even professors only wearing jeans and the university sweatshirt. The university campus was judgment-free and she deeply missed it. But, there was nothing she could do about that now, she was officially in the wolves den full of wolves waiting and hoping to take a large chunk of the estates and money. Little did anyone realize, by rushing this reading of the will everyone\u2019s lives were about to be changed.</p><p>It was the faint knocking sound that had pulled Aurora out of her trance-like state. Blinking away all the thoughts and memories haunting her large caramel brown eyes, the woman eyes snapped and looked directly into the mirror above the marble sink. She had to admit, she did look fairly rough considering for the last two weeks she had been wearing full face makeup, but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean she looked terrible considering the situation. Her hair was slightly messy from having the windows down the cab, but she had straightened the curly hair before the flight so she wouldn\u2019t look like a complete mess if she fell asleep on the plane, her eyebrows held their natural shape without the colored filler, her eyes had been bloodshot and sad, her olive skin showed it\u2019s imperfections yet it had a healthy glow from being moisturized daily along with being washed. Her black tank top matched with her comfortable Addis joggers, but that was just it, she didn\u2019t stick out. Yes, she did have nice curves, but she wasn\u2019t necessarily anything more than average. She definitely wasn\u2019t beyond beautiful in her book. She wasn\u2019t taller than 5\u20193, she didn\u2019t have sapphires for eyes, her teeth weren\u2019t perfectly white, and she wasn\u2019t a blonde. She was only Aurora Elizabeth Wilde, she was average and came from old money, that was how she had been described since puberty, but that hadn\u2019t meant that it couldn\u2019t change now that she had moved so far away. Perhaps here she could be an actual person rather than someone who comes from money. Once again, the knocking filled the house. Realizing that she had temporarily forgotten about the door, the girl spun on her heels and quickly sprinted towards the front door knowing that the weather app had called for rain in the evening.</p><p>Being as clumsy as she was it didn\u2019t take long for the brunette to accidentally shoulder check the corner wall closet to the front down. \u201cFor fuck sake Rori,\u201d she muttered grumpily as a strong shot of pain radiated from her shoulder and seeing as it was her own fault she couldn\u2019t be mad at anyone but herself. Rubbing circles around her potentially bruised flesh. Not bothering to look through the peephole, the girl swung the door open realizing that she probably shouldn\u2019t just open the door so quickly to strangers, but she felt as though she had been shot, therefore logic was not present at the moment. With furrowed brows, she looked at the people before her. One of the ladies looked maybe in her late forties with the kindest smile and eyes she had ever seen with a nice sundress and her hair pulled up. The other woman had similar bright eyes, dark eyes and had been wearing an old concert t-shirt and jeans. By the looks of it, she had a strong feeling that they were, in fact, mother and daughter, but there was. Something about the duo that caused the woman to sense that she had known them from somewhere.</p><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m Anne and this is my daughter Gemma. We just wanted to introduce ourselves, I live right across the street,\u201d the first woman explained sensing Aurora\u2019s curiosity, \u201cGem had noticed the master bedroom\u2019s light on and we wanted to finally see the face of whom Catherine often spoke of.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to be rude, Aurora kept eye contact with the older woman as Anne spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you both, I\u2019m Aurora,\u201d she responded shaking their hands politely. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a bother, do you mind suggesting some places that have good food around here? Earlier when I was exploring the house I was struggling to find food to cook, it was weird, I fully expected to find an unworldly amount of pasta noodles and sauce to make,\u201d she had commented with a soft laugh while rubbing the back of her neck awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cCatherine always did put things in strange places if you\u2019d like me to show you? One of the last times I was over here we helped her cook, and just everything was in strange places,\u201d Gemma offered.</p><p>\u201cI would really appreciate that, if you don\u2019t mind, of course,\u201d the American commented as she moved over allowing the women into her new home of sorts. In which the girl around her age entered in the house.</p><p>\u201cSilly me, I forgot the spare key and plant I was meaning on bringing over here! I\u2019ll be right back ladies, Gemma message me if you need anything from home.\u201d With the final comment from Anne, the older woman turned rather swiftly and made her way a crossed the street to the house Aurora assumed was hers.</p><p>Softly the brunette shut the front door and followed Gemma towards the kitchen. \u201cDid you grow up here,\u201d Aurora questioned attempting to create small talk between the two of them.</p><p>\u201cYeah, my mum, my brother and I just about all grew up here. It\u2019s not the biggest town, but I personally love it here. But, I might be a little bias, London is nice as well. I live there now, but nowhere is like home, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never left the states besides this, so I kind of get it. I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s a lot different here compared to there. But, I\u2019m definitely loving Holmes Chapel\u2019s charm. Everyone I\u2019ve met so far is super kind,\u201d Aurora confessed trying not to flat out say she was glad to be away from her spiteful family for good.</p><p>Reaching the colorful kitchen, Aurora kept close to Gemma as if she feared that the ingredients were in plain sight, in which she would already appear to be a proper idiot. Crouching down next to the stove, Gemma\u2019s soft brown eyes met Aurora\u2019s and a small smile crept along with the British\u2019s facial features. Opening the cabinet\u2019s door, her eyes remained on Aurora before she giggled and spoke, \u201cwho puts bloody pasta noodles by the stove? There should be some jarred pasta sauce on the other side of the stove.\u201d</p><p>Moving to the instructed location Aurora\u2019s eyebrows went up quizzically, but opening it nonetheless opened the cabinet door and took a peak in. Sure enough, there was the pasta sauce and random bottles of wine. With a small shake of the head Aurora muttered in a playful tone, \u201cshe must have been madder than I remember.\u201d Standing back up with the sauce and a bottle of wine, she sat the items on the countertop. \u201cIf you and your mom don\u2019t have dinner plans, you\u2019d be more than welcomed to join me. I haven\u2019t cooked for only myself in what feels like ages, and maybe you can help me find whatever else that crazy American hid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to just let me tell my mom to bring over the pie as well,\u201d Gemma had responded while pulling out her phone sending a quick little message to her mom. \u201cNow, where do you reckon she put the pots and wine glasses?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Laughs echoed off of the walls of the living room, where the three women sat drinking their fair share of wine. Although Aurora had genuinely been nervous to really have the company so soon, she was glad she had opened the front door. Dinner had gone so smoothly, that it had seemed as though they had all knew each other for several years, or as if Aurora had been apart of the family for several years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying Aurora should spend some time in London too, especially if she\u2019s going back to school mum, I didn\u2019t say I was going to kidnap her and never share her with you,\u201d Gemma retorted trying to withhold a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou better not even try it, Gemma, she is my new child who just happens to live only a road away. I am not losing all my children to London,\u201d the mother spoke before sending a small wink to both of the girls.</p><p>Taking another sip of the white wine, Aurora simply surpassed the smile on her face. \u201cYou two are officially my favorite people in the world,\u201d she stated truthfully before speaking again before the others could, \u201cbut on a serious note, I think maybe I\u2019ll stay in Holmes Chapel until I\u2019m settled in and comfortable with my surroundings. Then from there I\u2019ll get a flat out in London for school, and come here for breaks and the weekends. I\u2019m not too sure what the plan will be just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does sound like a good plan, love. London is quite big,\u201d Anne had replied softly.</p><p>Hearing the supportiveness within Anne\u2019s tone had Aurora feeling slightly envious. Was this the supportiveness she had been missing nearly her whole life? Was this what having a mother figure like? Were all mother\u2019s like this? So many questioned clashed within her head as she processed how genuinely kind these people were.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, a black shine had caught Aurora\u2019s attention. Slowly climbing off of the plush sofa, the girl sat her wine glass down on the side table before crawling over to what appeared to be a large box next to a record player. \u201cWoah,\u201d she murmured softly as she got close. Sitting in front of the record player the brunette began to pull out the records. \u201cI had no idea my grandmother had all these,\u201d Aurora trailed off feeling the eyes on her back.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d Gemma had started gaining a small peak over the shoulder from Aurora, who then continued to go through the records in a daze, \u201cthey used to be my brother\u2019s. Near the end, Cat knew how bad her medical condition was getting. Since she had known that she had wanted you to have the house, she started getting the house ready for you. She had my brother and I help plan the new color scheme. She wanted you to feel comfortable and happy. Anyways, one day we were talking about music because Cat kept saying that you needed to have a way to listen to music as you read or cooked. I had suggested a wireless speaker, but he went a little deeper with the question, and had asked what type of music you liked,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember her calling me to ask what music I like, she sounded rushed, but I thought she was having a weird grandma moment that she just wanted to know how I was feeling,\u201d Aurora elaborated slightly while looking up from the records.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I got back with the speaker, Harry had brought over his collection,\u201d Gemma added.</p><p>\u201cTell your brother he has great taste in music, way better than most, but if he wants this all back, my feelings wouldn\u2019t be hurt. I have no idea how he can part from Stevie Nicks, Aerosmith, or the Eagles,\u201d Aurora said referencing some of the albums that she had already pulled out. With a small yawn, the girl slowly removed a vinyl from its case and carefully placed it on to a record player.</p><p>\u201cGem, we should go home, Aurora must be getting tired from her long day, and we are waking her up early tomorrow so we can all go to the bakery in the morning,\u201d Anne commented softly while rising from her spot on the sofa.</p><p>Once she had gotten up from her spot, Anne encouragingly helped Gemma off the lazy boy before planting a friendly kiss on American\u2019s forehead, \u201cwe\u2019ll see you in the morning, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret saying you wanted to get breakfast when she wakes you up tomorrow, so try to get some rest,\u201d Gemma instructed giving the sitting girl a hug.</p><p>By the time that both women had exited the house, Stevie\u2019s legendary voice filled the house. Aurora had managed to force herself off of the floor to the lock the door. It wasn\u2019t until she waved goodnight to her new neighbors that Aurora realized whom she had just spent the evening with. How had it been that she hadn\u2019t made the connection sooner? It hadn\u2019t changed her opinion on the women at all, and yet her younger directioner self was incredibly disappointed that she had met Harry Styles\u2019 family and didn\u2019t realize it. But, in more ways than one, she felt relieved that she hadn\u2019t until their departure if she had then she may have felt the need to act more reserved than normal. At least they had met the real her as she had with them.</p><p>Yet, subconsciously she was trying hard to keep her cool, she had Harry Styles\u2019 private vinyl collection. Was this actually real?</p>",

I think that&rsquo;s it!</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><br />Life is always a mystery. You never know what you&rsquo;ll get when it comes to life in reality. If you&rsquo;re lucky, you&rsquo;ll know exactly what you want to do with your life before life has the chance to royally fuck you up. However, most aren&rsquo;t that lucky. Most are the indecisive people who just are going through this roller coaster with blindfolds, with no idea what&rsquo;s coming next. Yet, a roller coaster isn&rsquo;t the correct this type of life. In more ways, it feels as though life is just a foggy black and white haze until something adds color.</p><p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s why so many people prefer books and stories of fiction, it&rsquo;s a way to escape the uncertainty of life itself, a way to pretend that everything is actually indeed &lsquo;fine&rsquo;. At least that&rsquo;s how Aurora felt about it at least. Her books and music were her safe haven. With a good book in hand and her music playing, the world would just pause, even if it was for only thirty minutes, it was an escape. Perhaps it was the flow of the words that caused the young adult to feel free. Or perhaps it had to do with the fact that each character had a unique story and lesson to share. No matter the reasoning, the brunette nearly always had a book on her. Of course, she couldn&rsquo;t always carry a physical book on her person, but who needed to when smartphones could give you everything you could ever need.</p><p>Although books provide the girl with a blissful escape, it was also those same books that had made her content with the lack of social life since she had moved to the wet nation known as Britain. Being an American, she had very little knowledge of what to expect. After all, most of her knowledge of the country came from the television show Skins along with the Harry Potter series. But, with her very stubborn and rather particular grandmother&rsquo;s passing, the young twenty-one-year-old had been gifted not only the full inheritance, but her grandmother&rsquo;s cottage of sorts however to receive both items the girl would have to move to England. Sure, the older woman had adored her granddaughter, however Aurora suspected the will was just a final lesson, that Catherine could give her children on her death bed, what way could she punish money hungry children besides not giving them more than a final word of advice and a dime for the amount of times that they had tried to reach out in her old age. Compared to her bright-eyed granddaughter who tried to call every other week just to speak of schooling or of a novel she was reading. Although, being a college student was not easy by any means yet it was no one&rsquo;s fault but her own for changing her major twice. Her mess, her responsibility; how could she expect anyone to clean up her mess? Therefore, she had been balancing working part-time with being a full-time student. Her grandmother&rsquo;s final gift to the young woman was something that Aurora had never anticipated; a chance to start over. With the home and money all put into her name, her family was not thrilled whatsoever, yet Aurora knew that she couldn&rsquo;t disappoint the one person who listened about the stories she had been reading. So, the girl moved from the small town she was raised in and essentially moved crossed the world. Fully knowing from that moment her family could potentially outcast her.</p><p>Holmes Chapel, the town in which the well known Harry Styles grew up. The town isn&rsquo;t necessarily smaller or bigger than the small town Aurora grew up in back in America, yet there was something about the British people that made this place feel so much more knitted together. At least in the neighborhood, her grandmother had lived in seemed so close to give the illusion that each person in some way or another were like family to one another. It&rsquo;s no secret back home that if a young university student had moved into a residential neighborhood, some residents would complain and assume their nice quiet neighborhood would be turned into a loud obnoxious party house lowering their property values; yet here not even an hour after her cab had dropped her off at the royal blue medium sized home with the white wrap around porch that the swing next to the dark wooden door, a few neighbors had greeted her an apologized for her loss. It felt bewildering to the girl, who was always taught that it was best to keep some distance between yourself and neighbors. It simply was the way to resume privacy, but in more ways than one it was a form of isolation and nothing more. It was a way that helped build rumors, cliques, and forms judgment precursors that overtime cause unnecessary tensions over a shrub or a little fence. Looking back at the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t of the pompous life that her family had created seemed rather ridiculous now. If one were to hide away in a house with no communication with neighbors, your just another robot living the social media life, everything looks perfect on the outside, while behind closed doors everything is falling to pieces with a blood-curdling scream. Besides, if no one is allowed or good enough to be in your life, what&rsquo;s the point of human contact? Perhaps, that is why so many people are always so miserable, it would be exhausting to constantly be something you weren&rsquo;t. Aurora knew that all too well for her young age, but as much as she hated to admit it, she almost did not know not how to &lsquo;fake it until she made it&rsquo;. After all that was a concept that she had learned from such a young age, girls were to smile and to be what was expected of them. Yet, with a sense of the rest button being hit in her life, the brunette finally could be who she had always wanted, and no one could force her to be anything else different.</p><p>By the exterior of the home, the house appeared to be well kept and with perfect order. Some of the plants were overgrown and dead, yet with the winter chill and slight dusting coat of snow, the demise of the plants made sense truly. It still appeared to look perfectly in order. Even when you initially enter the home everything looks as if it has a particular order. The walls are coated in what looks to be fresh grey paint and select a few picture frames to decorate the home as though only a few of the innocent moments in deserved to be relived. A black fireplace captured the living room with one swallow, with no television, and all the soft white fabric sofas angling around the fire provided a feeling of close intimacy to those who had been welcomed into the humble abode. Along the entryway of the home remained to be one of the things Aurora had always wanted in a home, a window seat, or as she called it, &lsquo;the most profit spot to read as it rained outside&rsquo;. As she stood smiling at the cushioned window, the girl could almost already hear the rain pelting against the glass cooling the world around her down as she melted away into a fantasy. Pulling herself out of her daydream, the women tossed her jean jacket on to the rocking chair closest to the black marble fireplace, while her luggage remained by the front door. Although she had sworn to break her bad habits, Aurora knew all too well she probably wouldn&rsquo;t unpack right away. But, how could she unpack when she still had to explore the large house?</p><p>For what felt like hours the five foot and three inches female wandered the home, first she had discovered the kitchen, arguably the most important room of the whole house. It was brighter than the living room, and somewhat expectedly the room was coated in a ray of soft sunshine yellow and the white marble had such a large contrast to the living room that she truly did not know what to expect. She could remember her grandmother telling her that one should not decorate to please people, but decorated from to please soul because if one did this then you&rsquo;d always feel at home no matter who is around. As she roamed further into the home she had found the half bath, guest bathroom, and guest room which were all various shades of creams to grey. Each room regardless of the paint of the walls had a bright burst of color which shouted at life and yet had something relaxing laced together with it as well.</p><p>Her soft white shocks made no noise as she took slow and gentle steps towards the final door, which the girl presumed to be the master bedroom. Taking in a large intake of hair, the girl with the messy brown hair rested her forehead against the white door. Finding some courage, her hand grasped the doorknob before carefully pushing the door into the room. Her caramel brown eyes grew to the size of saucers at the sight before her. This was nothing that she had expected for the room to look like, after all the last time she had FaceTime with her grandmother, this room had been painted a shade of bright red and covered with lace. Now, however, the walls were white as snow. The fan that used to be over the bed was now replaced with a glass chandler. In the corner next to the walking closet was a black chair swing, the walk-in closet had been replaced by full-length mirrors, a lovely black vanity with royal blue fuzzy rug remained near the window. In the center of it all had been a king size bed, with royal blue and black silk bedding, as if her grandmother had remembered exactly what colors had been her favorites. One of the most eye-catching parts of the room at to be the secret draws within the bed frame perfect for storing her books. Along the side of the bed on both sides remained two nightstands with silver lamps to back the glass table decor. Tip-Toeing to the master bathroom, Aurora held her breath fearing that she&rsquo;d wake up and this would all be a dream.</p><p>The master bathroom seemingly matched perfectly to the bedroom&rsquo;s aesthetic. The walls remained white with black and silver accents along with each piece of furniture, The royal blue was not forgotten as it was the exact shade of the towels and rugs. There was something about the color scheme that gave the women a sense of elegance laced together with relaxation. The cool ceramic flooring cooled the bottom of her feet through her socks as she took in each aspect of the large bathroom. The home was a true dream, and something gave off a feeling she could not quite describe. If she hadn&rsquo;t known any better, she would have said the home had been completely decorated to meet her preference. However, if this truly was the case, why had she been lead to believe that her grandmother had passed away in a freak accident? There had been so many unknowns regarding the whole situation, for example, why had her grandmother&rsquo;s medical file been sealed? What type of family secrets was lingering within the family still?</p><p>Starring lazily at the empty black bath, the girl vividly recalled the funeral two weeks prior, and how strange everyone had been acting. From the moment that the family had been alerted of Catherine&rsquo;s death, so many peculiar behaviors started popping up. It all had started with how her parents demanded that she come home while they had to start planning on how to get her from England back to the United States of America. During a family death, perhaps it was normal to have the whole family come home, however that implied that she had a normal family. But, she didn&rsquo;t, her family were the type of people who would miss birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries. Nothing was sacred and if there was an opportunity to further the depth of one&rsquo;s pockets, typically that route would have been taken. There were so many times that she could vividly recall family dinners and parties being canceled, due to someone needing to go prep for another surgery or court case. So, having everyone and the same household until the funeral was beyond strange. Perhaps, thinking that they were all grieving of shorts, the brunette packed her bag and drove the five hours along the interstate to come home to the small town that had the house on the hill.</p><p>Upon her arrival home, Aurora noted the large rain clouds threatening to unleash the built up rain. The clean air had been a smell that she had missed dearly, seeing as in the city in which she now lived in smelt of car&rsquo;s exhaust, but at the family manner, the scent of pine trees and the lake filled the atmosphere. With the impending rain clouds, the air slowly started to have a more of a lake scent than normal, which signaled that the storm would be one what would be one of destruction. The large unwelcoming brown door of the castle-like home remained unchanged from what she had remembered. Building up her courage, the college student chewed on her lip, before grabbing her phone and backpack.</p><p>Knots formed heavily within her stomach with each step towards the large unwelcoming door frame. Her long brown curly hair blew back in the stormy wind, sending a chill through her spine. Pulling her black cardigan over her black skinny jeans and Aerosmith faded concert t-shirt, the girl pushed the door open fully knowing that she would fully be ridiculed for her choice in clothing regardless of the lack of people in the home. Entering the threshold once again was exactly what Aurora had expected. The home still was uncannily cold and the overpowering scent of the lilacs that undoubtedly decorated every corner of the manor. The old aged rugs remained over the wooden floors as if they truly prevented the original wood floors from harsh bursts of the seasonal weather. Yet, it is nearly impossible to break the family out of its traditional ways. Perhaps that was why Catherine had disappeared off the face of the earth for a full year only to find out she was living a new life across the pond as if the life surrounded by statuses whom only cared about how many green faces lined their Gucci suits. At least, that was what Aurora suspected, and for that, she couldn&rsquo;t fault her Grandmother. To spend so many years with the heartlessness and cold atmosphere, one still craving life and hope desperately would want to be freed from that prison.</p><p>Right on cue, the sounds of bickering filled the long dreary hall. Exhaling her final piece of peace, the girl dropped her bag down next to the long extravagant staircase. Tucking her hair behind her ears Aurora began her way towards the loud voices whining and complaining down the house. By the sound of the voices, she had been able to pick out her father&rsquo;s and Uncle Jon&rsquo;s voice, along with Alana, Jon&rsquo;s gold-digging wife. Although she could not identify any other voices, Aurora knew all too well that this world war three most likely had a few unsettling viewers. Turning the corner, the small crowd came into focus. Mentally, she had patted herself on the back for correctly identifying her uncle, aunt, and father, yet it was seeing the &lsquo;family disappointment &lsquo; her father&rsquo;s sister and her small family did confuse her completely. She could have never expected to see her aunt Scarlett, who was nearly blacklisted from every family event due to her decision of leaving the family practice of lawyers and doctors to open up a little cafe with her secret girlfriend and her eighteen-year-old son. Jon and her father swore that Scarlett&rsquo;s sexuality had nothing to do with the lack of appearances at family functions, yet Scarlett hadn&rsquo;t come out until midway through the ten years of Catherine&rsquo;s leave. Suddenly after, her aunt seemingly was removed from any pictures and no longer attended any type of holiday. For a group of Christians and Catholics who claim to believe in God&rsquo;s love, they sure did like to criticize different people and place themselves above others&hellip; It truly made no sense to Aurora, weren&rsquo;t they suppose to love everyone?</p><p>With a relieved smile, the youngest female approached her favorite aunt, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve really missed you,&rdquo; she whispered while engulfing her into an enduring hug full of honesty. From her aunt to Susan and Brandon, Scarlett&rsquo;s now wife and adopted son, welcoming them with a warm hug knowing well that Alana was continuing to scoff and make remarks regarding the will.</p><p>&ldquo;Aurora, why are you wearing such hideous clothes? You have a much suitable wardrobe to wear, especially seeing as your grandmother&rsquo;s lawyer is on the way, perhaps you should change, &ldquo; the nasal sounding woman suggested only gaining an eye roll from Susan.</p><p>&ldquo;Alana, I&rsquo;m so glad I was able to take a microbiology final, and then drive three hours to not only deal with my grandmother&rsquo;s death but to be graced with your not wanted opinion. This may surprise you, but some people don&rsquo;t automatically think about a will when they get a phone call of a family member&rsquo;s death. Some us need time to digest the information and remember the individual, but apparently, most of this family disagrees and thinks that if we wait a week that all the money will be gone,&rdquo; Aurora commented rather hastily bitterly due to the situation of events. For a second, the girl regretted her harsh words, yet she acted it down with the rest of her emotions. After all, if you showed weakness around a pack of wolves, you wouldn&rsquo;t see the light of day ever again. It was the situations like this, it always was best to wear defensive comments like armor. It was something that she had hated most about this place, she hated having to walk around on thin ice waiting for an argument. At least at school, one wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about appearances as much or being treated as an object rather than a person. Back on campus, Aurora could recall several times seeing students in pajamas, or even professors only wearing jeans and the university sweatshirt. The university campus was judgment-free and she deeply missed it. But, there was nothing she could do about that now, she was officially in the wolves den full of wolves waiting and hoping to take a large chunk of the estates and money. Little did anyone realize, by rushing this reading of the will everyone&rsquo;s lives were about to be changed.</p><p>It was the faint knocking sound that had pulled Aurora out of her trance-like state. Blinking away all the thoughts and memories haunting her large caramel brown eyes, the woman eyes snapped and looked directly into the mirror above the marble sink. She had to admit, she did look fairly rough considering for the last two weeks she had been wearing full face makeup, but that didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean she looked terrible considering the situation. Her hair was slightly messy from having the windows down the cab, but she had straightened the curly hair before the flight so she wouldn&rsquo;t look like a complete mess if she fell asleep on the plane, her eyebrows held their natural shape without the colored filler, her eyes had been bloodshot and sad, her olive skin showed it&rsquo;s imperfections yet it had a healthy glow from being moisturized daily along with being washed. Her black tank top matched with her comfortable Addis joggers, but that was just it, she didn&rsquo;t stick out. Yes, she did have nice curves, but she wasn&rsquo;t necessarily anything more than average. She definitely wasn&rsquo;t beyond beautiful in her book. She wasn&rsquo;t taller than 5&rsquo;3, she didn&rsquo;t have sapphires for eyes, her teeth weren&rsquo;t perfectly white, and she wasn&rsquo;t a blonde. She was only Aurora Elizabeth Wilde, she was average and came from old money, that was how she had been described since puberty, but that hadn&rsquo;t meant that it couldn&rsquo;t change now that she had moved so far away. Perhaps here she could be an actual person rather than someone who comes from money. Once again, the knocking filled the house. Realizing that she had temporarily forgotten about the door, the girl spun on her heels and quickly sprinted towards the front door knowing that the weather app had called for rain in the evening.</p><p>Being as clumsy as she was it didn&rsquo;t take long for the brunette to accidentally shoulder check the corner wall closet to the front down. &ldquo;For fuck sake Rori,&rdquo; she muttered grumpily as a strong shot of pain radiated from her shoulder and seeing as it was her own fault she couldn&rsquo;t be mad at anyone but herself. Rubbing circles around her potentially bruised flesh. Not bothering to look through the peephole, the girl swung the door open realizing that she probably shouldn&rsquo;t just open the door so quickly to strangers, but she felt as though she had been shot, therefore logic was not present at the moment. With furrowed brows, she looked at the people before her. One of the ladies looked maybe in her late forties with the kindest smile and eyes she had ever seen with a nice sundress and her hair pulled up. The other woman had similar bright eyes, dark eyes and had been wearing an old concert t-shirt and jeans. By the looks of it, she had a strong feeling that they were, in fact, mother and daughter, but there was. Something about the duo that caused the woman to sense that she had known them from somewhere.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, I&rsquo;m Anne and this is my daughter Gemma. We just wanted to introduce ourselves, I live right across the street,&rdquo; the first woman explained sensing Aurora&rsquo;s curiosity, &ldquo;Gem had noticed the master bedroom&rsquo;s light on and we wanted to finally see the face of whom Catherine often spoke of.&rdquo;</p><p>Not wanting to be rude, Aurora kept eye contact with the older woman as Anne spoke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you both, I&rsquo;m Aurora,&rdquo; she responded shaking their hands politely. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not a bother, do you mind suggesting some places that have good food around here? Earlier when I was exploring the house I was struggling to find food to cook, it was weird, I fully expected to find an unworldly amount of pasta noodles and sauce to make,&rdquo; she had commented with a soft laugh while rubbing the back of her neck awkwardly.</p><p>&ldquo;Catherine always did put things in strange places if you&rsquo;d like me to show you? One of the last times I was over here we helped her cook, and just everything was in strange places,&rdquo; Gemma offered.</p><p>&ldquo;I would really appreciate that, if you don&rsquo;t mind, of course,&rdquo; the American commented as she moved over allowing the women into her new home of sorts. In which the girl around her age entered in the house.</p><p>&ldquo;Silly me, I forgot the spare key and plant I was meaning on bringing over here! I&rsquo;ll be right back ladies, Gemma message me if you need anything from home.&rdquo; With the final comment from Anne, the older woman turned rather swiftly and made her way a crossed the street to the house Aurora assumed was hers.</p><p>Softly the brunette shut the front door and followed Gemma towards the kitchen. &ldquo;Did you grow up here,&rdquo; Aurora questioned attempting to create small talk between the two of them.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, my mum, my brother and I just about all grew up here. It&rsquo;s not the biggest town, but I personally love it here. But, I might be a little bias, London is nice as well. I live there now, but nowhere is like home, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never left the states besides this, so I kind of get it. I&rsquo;m not going to lie, it&rsquo;s a lot different here compared to there. But, I&rsquo;m definitely loving Holmes Chapel&rsquo;s charm. Everyone I&rsquo;ve met so far is super kind,&rdquo; Aurora confessed trying not to flat out say she was glad to be away from her spiteful family for good.</p><p>Reaching the colorful kitchen, Aurora kept close to Gemma as if she feared that the ingredients were in plain sight, in which she would already appear to be a proper idiot. Crouching down next to the stove, Gemma&rsquo;s soft brown eyes met Aurora&rsquo;s and a small smile crept along with the British&rsquo;s facial features. Opening the cabinet&rsquo;s door, her eyes remained on Aurora before she giggled and spoke, &ldquo;who puts bloody pasta noodles by the stove? There should be some jarred pasta sauce on the other side of the stove.&rdquo;</p><p>Moving to the instructed location Aurora&rsquo;s eyebrows went up quizzically, but opening it nonetheless opened the cabinet door and took a peak in. Sure enough, there was the pasta sauce and random bottles of wine. With a small shake of the head Aurora muttered in a playful tone, &ldquo;she must have been madder than I remember.&rdquo; Standing back up with the sauce and a bottle of wine, she sat the items on the countertop. &ldquo;If you and your mom don&rsquo;t have dinner plans, you&rsquo;d be more than welcomed to join me. I haven&rsquo;t cooked for only myself in what feels like ages, and maybe you can help me find whatever else that crazy American hid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to just let me tell my mom to bring over the pie as well,&rdquo; Gemma had responded while pulling out her phone sending a quick little message to her mom. &ldquo;Now, where do you reckon she put the pots and wine glasses?&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>Laughs echoed off of the walls of the living room, where the three women sat drinking their fair share of wine. Although Aurora had genuinely been nervous to really have the company so soon, she was glad she had opened the front door. Dinner had gone so smoothly, that it had seemed as though they had all knew each other for several years, or as if Aurora had been apart of the family for several years.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying Aurora should spend some time in London too, especially if she&rsquo;s going back to school mum, I didn&rsquo;t say I was going to kidnap her and never share her with you,&rdquo; Gemma retorted trying to withhold a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;You better not even try it, Gemma, she is my new child who just happens to live only a road away. I am not losing all my children to London,&rdquo; the mother spoke before sending a small wink to both of the girls.</p><p>Taking another sip of the white wine, Aurora simply surpassed the smile on her face. &ldquo;You two are officially my favorite people in the world,&rdquo; she stated truthfully before speaking again before the others could, &ldquo;but on a serious note, I think maybe I&rsquo;ll stay in Holmes Chapel until I&rsquo;m settled in and comfortable with my surroundings. Then from there I&rsquo;ll get a flat out in London for school, and come here for breaks and the weekends. I&rsquo;m not too sure what the plan will be just yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That does sound like a good plan, love. London is quite big,&rdquo; Anne had replied softly.</p><p>Hearing the supportiveness within Anne&rsquo;s tone had Aurora feeling slightly envious. Was this the supportiveness she had been missing nearly her whole life? Was this what having a mother figure like? Were all mother&rsquo;s like this? So many questioned clashed within her head as she processed how genuinely kind these people were.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, a black shine had caught Aurora&rsquo;s attention. Slowly climbing off of the plush sofa, the girl sat her wine glass down on the side table before crawling over to what appeared to be a large box next to a record player. &ldquo;Woah,&rdquo; she murmured softly as she got close. Sitting in front of the record player the brunette began to pull out the records. &ldquo;I had no idea my grandmother had all these,&rdquo; Aurora trailed off feeling the eyes on her back.</p><p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Gemma had started gaining a small peak over the shoulder from Aurora, who then continued to go through the records in a daze, &ldquo;they used to be my brother&rsquo;s. Near the end, Cat knew how bad her medical condition was getting. Since she had known that she had wanted you to have the house, she started getting the house ready for you. She had my brother and I help plan the new color scheme. She wanted you to feel comfortable and happy. Anyways, one day we were talking about music because Cat kept saying that you needed to have a way to listen to music as you read or cooked. I had suggested a wireless speaker, but he went a little deeper with the question, and had asked what type of music you liked,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I remember her calling me to ask what music I like, she sounded rushed, but I thought she was having a weird grandma moment that she just wanted to know how I was feeling,&rdquo; Aurora elaborated slightly while looking up from the records.</p><p>&ldquo;By the time I got back with the speaker, Harry had brought over his collection,&rdquo; Gemma added.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell your brother he has great taste in music, way better than most, but if he wants this all back, my feelings wouldn&rsquo;t be hurt. I have no idea how he can part from Stevie Nicks, Aerosmith, or the Eagles,&rdquo; Aurora said referencing some of the albums that she had already pulled out. With a small yawn, the girl slowly removed a vinyl from its case and carefully placed it on to a record player.</p><p>&ldquo;Gem, we should go home, Aurora must be getting tired from her long day, and we are waking her up early tomorrow so we can all go to the bakery in the morning,&rdquo; Anne commented softly while rising from her spot on the sofa.</p><p>Once she had gotten up from her spot, Anne encouragingly helped Gemma off the lazy boy before planting a friendly kiss on American&rsquo;s forehead, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see you in the morning, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to regret saying you wanted to get breakfast when she wakes you up tomorrow, so try to get some rest,&rdquo; Gemma instructed giving the sitting girl a hug.</p><p>By the time that both women had exited the house, Stevie&rsquo;s legendary voice filled the house. Aurora had managed to force herself off of the floor to the lock the door. It wasn&rsquo;t until she waved goodnight to her new neighbors that Aurora realized whom she had just spent the evening with. How had it been that she hadn&rsquo;t made the connection sooner? It hadn&rsquo;t changed her opinion on the women at all, and yet her younger directioner self was incredibly disappointed that she had met Harry Styles&rsquo; family and didn&rsquo;t realize it. But, in more ways than one, she felt relieved that she hadn&rsquo;t until their departure if she had then she may have felt the need to act more reserved than normal. At least they had met the real her as she had with them.</p><p>Yet, subconsciously she was trying hard to keep her cool, she had Harry Styles&rsquo; private vinyl collection. Was this actually real?</p>",

Underneath the dress, you wore a little black thong and a lace, see through bra. A tiny bow was placed in your hair. Harry sat in the nearby chair in a full suit reading the newspaper. Occasionally his eyes would peer up over the edge of the page to look at you.</p><p>You were bending over in order dust the coffee table in front of him. Your whole ass was there, on display, right in front of him. His cock began to get hard in his dress pants. He gripped onto the thin newspaper a little tighter, then finally set it aside after realizing he no longer held any interest.</p><p>You stood up and looked to him. Once facing him, he got a view of your breasts that were pushed so tightly into your uniform. Your makeup was done too. You held the feathered duster in your hand, the feathers brushed against your leg. Your thigh high socks could be seen.  </p><p>\u201cCome here, let\u2019s do what I like.\u201d Harry suggested, you knew exactly what he meant. Standing in front of him, you lifted your foot onto the seat. Your skirt was now lifted a little, he could see your pussy through your lace panties. Your foot rested right next to his leg, your pussy was close to his face. You lightly brushed the duster over your core, feeling it getting wet and warm. Harry took it from you and set it to the side.</p><p>Then, you put your foot back on the ground and rubbed your hands over your thighs. Harry watched slowly as your fingers hooked into your panties and slowly slid them down. Wetness made streaks on the inside of your thigh. He took your panties from out of your hand, then lifted them to his nose. His tongue lightly licked over the part that was once against your heat, tasting you from your panties.</p><p>Then, he took a handkerchief from the breast pocket of his suit. His hands gripped your hips and turned you around, now your ass faced him. He lightly rubbed the handkerchief over your skin, teasing you. You gasped out when it suddenly was placed between your legs. </p><p>\u201cLooks like you need some cleaning here&hellip;\u201d He moved the handkerchief in small circular motions. You bent over, revealing more of your pussy to him from behind. One of his hands held onto your ass cheek, another rubbed the handkerchief slowly over your pussy, watching as you loved every touch. Suddenly he swiped the tip of his tongue up your pussy lips.</p><p>You moaned out slightly as his tongue rolled along the folds of your pussy. You stayed bent over as he continued to lick and suck your pussy that was so wet for him. He leaned back as you stood up. Turning around to face him, you kept eye contact as you slowly removed your maid uniform. </p><p>First, you unzipped the back until the shoulders slooped down your arms. Then, you hooked your fingers around the neckline and lowered it to your waist, revealing your breasts that bounced free for him. You lowered your hand under your skirt, swiping your pussy then bringing your fingers to your mouth. With closed eyes. You slowly sucked the wetness off your as you pulled your dress down your legs. Now you were totally naked in front of him.</p><p>Harry now had his pants unbuckled, his member in his hand. He slowly stroked himself up and down as he watched you. His finger swiped over his head and then slowly went down his long shaft. You couldn\u2019t wait to have his pink cock in your mouth. Your hand reached up to the lacy white choker around your neck, you lightly pulled it off. Then, you slowly dragged it down your body, between your breasts, down your stomach, and then between your legs. </p><p>You lifted a leg onto the chair Harry sat on, then reached a hand behind your ass while you slowly slid the lace choker back and forth on your pussy. Holding it up afterwards, Harry\u2019s tongue licked along the choker.  His teeth bit the lace as he took it from your hand with his mouth. You slowly began straddling his lap, then took the choker from out of his mouth.</p><p>Both of you kissed passionately, then you slowly began lowering yourself onto his cock. His face became flushed as you squeezed him inside of you. After you adjusted, you slowly began to move with him inside. You slowly rode his cock as both of your bodies kept pushing together. Your pussy pulsed around his cock as he fucked you. Your arms were wrapped around his neck, he\u2019d occasionally bring his hands to your breasts. You both froze as you felt his warm fill inside of you, then him sit back. </p><p>Lifting yourself off of him, you stood up from the seat and then kneeled in front of Harry on the floor. His head was leaned to the side, resting on the chair. His eyes were shut as he relaxed from his orgasm. You slowly licked his cock that you took in your hand and sucked it as he relaxed. After licking his balls, you got up and sat in his lap again. Resting your head on his shoulder, you took his handkerchief and placed it between your legs before going to sleep. </p>",

Underneath the dress, you wore a little black thong and a lace, see through bra. A tiny bow was placed in your hair. Harry sat in the nearby chair in a full suit reading the newspaper. Occasionally his eyes would peer up over the edge of the page to look at you.</p><p>You were bending over in order dust the coffee table in front of him. Your whole ass was there, on display, right in front of him. His cock began to get hard in his dress pants. He gripped onto the thin newspaper a little tighter, then finally set it aside after realizing he no longer held any interest.</p><p>You stood up and looked to him. Once facing him, he got a view of your breasts that were pushed so tightly into your uniform. Your makeup was done too. You held the feathered duster in your hand, the feathers brushed against your leg. Your thigh high socks could be seen.  </p><p>\u201cCome here, let\u2019s do what I like.\u201d Harry suggested, you knew exactly what he meant. Standing in front of him, you lifted your foot onto the seat. Your skirt was now lifted a little, he could see your pussy through your lace panties. Your foot rested right next to his leg, your pussy was close to his face. You lightly brushed the duster over your core, feeling it getting wet and warm. Harry took it from you and set it to the side.</p><p>Then, you put your foot back on the ground and rubbed your hands over your thighs. Harry watched slowly as your fingers hooked into your panties and slowly slid them down. Wetness made streaks on the inside of your thigh. He took your panties from out of your hand, then lifted them to his nose. His tongue lightly licked over the part that was once against your heat, tasting you from your panties.</p><p>Then, he took a handkerchief from the breast pocket of his suit. His hands gripped your hips and turned you around, now your ass faced him. He lightly rubbed the handkerchief over your skin, teasing you. You gasped out when it suddenly was placed between your legs. </p><p>\u201cLooks like you need some cleaning here\u2026\u201d He moved the handkerchief in small circular motions. You bent over, revealing more of your pussy to him from behind. One of his hands held onto your ass cheek, another rubbed the handkerchief slowly over your pussy, watching as you loved every touch. Suddenly he swiped the tip of his tongue up your pussy lips.</p><p>You moaned out slightly as his tongue rolled along the folds of your pussy. You stayed bent over as he continued to lick and suck your pussy that was so wet for him. He leaned back as you stood up. Turning around to face him, you kept eye contact as you slowly removed your maid uniform. </p><p>First, you unzipped the back until the shoulders slooped down your arms. Then, you hooked your fingers around the neckline and lowered it to your waist, revealing your breasts that bounced free for him. You lowered your hand under your skirt, swiping your pussy then bringing your fingers to your mouth. With closed eyes. You slowly sucked the wetness off your as you pulled your dress down your legs. Now you were totally naked in front of him.</p><p>Harry now had his pants unbuckled, his member in his hand. He slowly stroked himself up and down as he watched you. His finger swiped over his head and then slowly went down his long shaft. You couldn\u2019t wait to have his pink cock in your mouth. Your hand reached up to the lacy white choker around your neck, you lightly pulled it off. Then, you slowly dragged it down your body, between your breasts, down your stomach, and then between your legs. </p><p>You lifted a leg onto the chair Harry sat on, then reached a hand behind your ass while you slowly slid the lace choker back and forth on your pussy. Holding it up afterwards, Harry\u2019s tongue licked along the choker.  His teeth bit the lace as he took it from your hand with his mouth. You slowly began straddling his lap, then took the choker from out of his mouth.</p><p>Both of you kissed passionately, then you slowly began lowering yourself onto his cock. His face became flushed as you squeezed him inside of you. After you adjusted, you slowly began to move with him inside. You slowly rode his cock as both of your bodies kept pushing together. Your pussy pulsed around his cock as he fucked you. Your arms were wrapped around his neck, he\u2019d occasionally bring his hands to your breasts. You both froze as you felt his warm fill inside of you, then him sit back. </p><p>Lifting yourself off of him, you stood up from the seat and then kneeled in front of Harry on the floor. His head was leaned to the side, resting on the chair. His eyes were shut as he relaxed from his orgasm. You slowly licked his cock that you took in your hand and sucked it as he relaxed. After licking his balls, you got up and sat in his lap again. Resting your head on his shoulder, you took his handkerchief and placed it between your legs before going to sleep. </p></p>",
