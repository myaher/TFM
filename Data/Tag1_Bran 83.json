        "answer": "<p>Lol I wish we&rsquo;d get the real Bran back. I have no idea what he&rsquo;s going to be doing because he&rsquo;s got these amazing magical skills and those have to be essential to defeating the WW BUT the production doesn&rsquo;t appear to get that. Or care. Because so far they&rsquo;ve literally just used him for flashbacks (and there&rsquo;s fans trying to construe that this is because R+L=J must be like essential to the endgame when it&rsquo;s really not it&rsquo;s just something D&amp;D fixate on and for whatever reason they didn&rsquo;t want Bran doing his own thing, maybe it had to do with the budget or it would add &ldquo;too much confusion&rdquo;). The scene when he&rsquo;s shown the apparent origins of the NK is literally the only time they&rsquo;ve gotten close to his real mission. I believe they&rsquo;ll throw in something for him to do magically during the battle but it&rsquo;s not going to make a ton of sense or be as important as whatever book!bran is going to do. But mostly he&rsquo;ll be relegated to the background and only brought forward to talk about R+L or to creep someone out. Isaac has said he&rsquo;ll be a little more of a person this year but I 1) don&rsquo;t trust Isaac, 2) don&rsquo;t trust the show (ex he could have been in a bunch of humanizing and interesting scenes that will have been cut like that one time he was plot relevant last season that got cut).</p><p>I know I&rsquo;m being a pessimist but this is the only way I can deal with the show.</p><p><i>Thanks for talking to me!</i></p>",

It was interesting how the wall of earth magic he and Jon\nhad built around his mind had changed the dragon. His contained fire was less\ndangerous, more focussed than Drogon\u2019s, but it was still fire. <i>Fire made flesh.</i> Bran briefly touched\nJon\u2019s mind reassuringly.

Bran could feel the tiny, tiny fleck of a being close to\nher heart, and he brushed his nephew ever so lightly. Olyvar Frey was at\nSansa\u2019s side, his eyes restive and Ghost flanked her on the other side. Bran\ncould feel that Sansa was frightened, but he was sure nobody would realise\nthat. She calmly managed the constant stream of people. </i></b></p><p>It was time\nnow. The enemy was closing in, claiming the castle.

He stamped on his worry for Arya. He had\nseen that she had a decent chance of survival after all.</p><p><b><i>Sansa led the living\ndeeper and deeper into the tunnels. Brienne and Jaime were at the end of the\ncolumn. Tyrion chose this moment to finally unburden his conscience. He had\nbeen in the middle of the column, but now he ran back and looked for his\nbrother, his stride was unsteady. He must have drunk many tankards to be that\naffected. </i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cJaime,\u201d he called,\n\u201cJaime.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>His brother barely\nmanaged to save him from being killed by a White Walker when he buried his\nValyrian sword in the White Walker mere moments before he touched Tyrion.</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat are you doing\nhere?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Bran\nwaited. He should call the Kings of Winter now and he could feel the Children\npressuring him. He stood his ground.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t want them to die. I don\u2019t want anyone\nto die. Go, now, leave this room, he tried to tell them.</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cSansa, I think she is\nin danger.\u201d Tyrion blurted out. There were tears in his eyes. \u201cI should have\ntold you earlier. I think Daenerys might have bribed someone to kill her.\u201d </i></b></p><p><b><i>Jaime pushed his\nbrother. \u201cGet yourself to safety. And don\u2019t you worry. Olyvar is with Sansa.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cBut he must be the\none she bribed. She said something about \u2018Once a traitor always a traitor\u2019.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>Brienne barked a\nlaugh. \u201cAs if Olyvar would betray the woman who saved him. Believe me, Sansa is\nsafe with him. He told us all about it and he played along.\u201d </i></b></p><p><b><i>Bran pressed a hand to\nhis head. The pressure was getting worse.</i></b></p><p><b><i>Tyrion looked at\nBrienne, understanding dawning on him. \u201cYou knew?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI am the Commander of\nthe Queensguard, of course I knew.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>Jaime pushed his\nbrother again. \u201cNow, please, look after yourself. I have to fight.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>Wights were coming at\nthem, but Tyrion did not see them. Maybe he was too drunk.</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cJaime,\u201d Tyrion\nwailed. \u201cI failed you. You protected King\u2019s Landing, but I did not manage to do\nwhat you did.

Jaime skipped a beat and\nBrienne barely managed to keep him from getting butchered. </i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI suspected as much,\nTyrion, and now, by all the Gods, get your arse out of here.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Bran would\nhave to risk it. Tyrion had distracted him, the chance for him running back had\nnot been that high, and he had lost contact to Arya. He hoped that she was\ndeeper in the crypts. He called upon the Kings of Winter like he had already\ndone once before. He was in awe that it was so much easier now, he felt the\nstrength of Winterfell\u2019s magic deep in his bones. The Children were satisfied.</p><p>The statues\nmoved and protected the crypts to where the living had fled. </p><p>Bran opened\nhis eyes and looked at the sky that was tinged with a silver lining that\nforebode the dawn. A time of change, this was the right moment, between night\nand day, time for decisions.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll\nspring the trap now,\u201d he told Theon.</p>",

He concentrated on\nthe plan to trap the White Walkers. He dared not think beyond that. They did\nnot understand that he would think about his family, not when they were so\nclose to the thin veil that separated them from the access to their magic.

Bran\ndoubted he could hide anything from them if he opened his thoughts again to the\nweirwood. He had not even dared to take the arrows from the tree. The children\nhad reached out and hid Bran and Theon from the White Walkers. The enemy would\nnot sense them, not as long as there was a feast of living souls they could expect\nto drain as soon as they had won the castle. </p><p>Bran let\nhis mind wander, seeing, but not acting. The time for action would come later, for\nnow the pieces were all set. He wondered if his siblings would think him cold.\nA part of him knew that they would not appreciate to be moved like pieces on a\ncyvasse board, but that was as far as his understanding went.

Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/43444991\">AO3</a>.</p>\n<p>Bran could\nhear their voices all the time now. It made it difficult to concentrate on what\npeople said. The voices of the children drowned everything out. Their voices\nwere the pulse of the earth in autumn, a slight breeze in summer, the steady\ndropping of a spring rain. They were insistent, urging him. He concentrated on\nthe plan to trap the White Walkers. He dared not think beyond that. They did\nnot understand that he would think about his family, not when they were so\nclose to the thin veil that separated them from the access to their magic. He\ncould hide his thoughts behind his worry for his family. In a way it was an\nadvantage that they were all in danger.</p>\n</p>",
