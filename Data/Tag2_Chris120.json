He came with wine and a box of cookies with chocolate chips.</p><p>Harper and Chris had totally different nights. While she was laughing and having fun with Sebastian, he was listening to his friend&rsquo;s thoughts about his blooming relationship. It was not nice. His head was hurting and he feels like picking the first plane to Boston so he could talk with his mother. It\u2019s immature of him, but he can\u2019t think about a way out of this mess. His friends are convinced Harper only wants him for his fame, but that\u2019s not what he feels when they\u2019re together. On the other hand, the guys had never acted like that, so they must be really concerned and based on facts. The only thing he didn\u2019t know is that the guys are only worried cause Adam told them a bunch of lies.</p><p>After dinner, Sebastian helps Harper washing the dishes and they sit at the couch to eat the cookies and talk more. Harper tells him about her work and what she was doing with this new band here in NY, he tells her he\u2019s not doing much in the next couple of weeks since he\u2019s been working non-stop and needs some rest.</p><p>\u201cThis is really good, where did you buy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great baking shop around the corner, they have the best cookies!

How was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of work&hellip;but it\u2019s nice to be recording. I think we\u2019ll be able to finish some tracks this week. They only have three weeks to do it all so I can\u2019t really try to fix every little thing, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah..but you\u2019ll do great. I wanted to see you in my bed. Is your cousin\u2019s flat okay? Do you have anything you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you know what? It\u2019s in Sebastian\u2019s building!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was leaving to work and he entered the elevator, do you believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited him and Emmy to dinner tonight, but she couldn\u2019t come&hellip;It was nice anyway, he\u2019s so sweet\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you were here, it was nice&hellip;I had a lot of fun\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did.

Bring Emmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c Tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. 704. Let me give you my number\u201d she says holding her hand out to take his phone to enter her number. After this, they get to the ground floor and says goodbye, going their own ways.</p><p>With the band, things were a bit more stressful today, since the guitarist didn\u2019t practice any of the things she had told him to do yesterday. It took forever for her to be satisfied with the sound they were creating but eventually, she calls it a day and send them on their way.</p><p>She\u2019s back at the building entering Jared\u2019s studio when she gets a text from Chris.</p><p><i>This mountain hates me.</i></p><p><i>Why?</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s way harder than Park City.</i></p><p><i>Have fun ;)</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ll go to the bar with the guys and call you before going to sleep.</i></p><p><i>Ok. Bye.</i></p><p>After organizing everything she needs to do the salmon risotto she likes, she looks at the phone and there\u2019s a text from Sebastian.</p><p><i>Hey, still up for tonight?</i></p><p><i>Sure. I\u2019m cooking, are you home? Is Emmy with you?</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m home. She\u2019s not coming, she already had plans.</i></p><p><i>Ok, well, you can come up and help me then.</i></p><p>It took a minute for him to knock on the door. He came with wine and a box of cookies with chocolate chips.</p><p>Harper and Chris had totally different nights. While she was laughing and having fun with Sebastian, he was listening to his friend\u2019s thoughts about his blooming relationship. It was not nice. His head was hurting and he feels like picking the first plane to Boston so he could talk with his mother. It\u2019s immature of him, but he can\u2019t think about a way out of this mess. His friends are convinced Harper only wants him for his fame, but that\u2019s not what he feels when they\u2019re together. On the other hand, the guys had never acted like that, so they must be really concerned and based on facts. The only thing he didn\u2019t know is that the guys are only worried cause Adam told them a bunch of lies.</p><p>After dinner, Sebastian helps Harper washing the dishes and they sit at the couch to eat the cookies and talk more. Harper tells him about her work and what she was doing with this new band here in NY, he tells her he\u2019s not doing much in the next couple of weeks since he\u2019s been working non-stop and needs some rest.</p><p>\u201cThis is really good, where did you buy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great baking shop around the corner, they have the best cookies! I should not be having this much, though, I\u2019ll have to stay an extra hour at the gym tomorrow to burn this\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about finding a gym, is yours close by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and the owner is a friend of mine, if you want to come with me I can get you a free month..\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only staying for a month\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he doesn\u2019t need to know that.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and agrees. Seb stands saying he needs to go and she walks him to the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you for dinner, Harper, it was truly delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the company, Seb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGym at 7?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have to make sure I have clothes to work out\u2026but yes, I\u2019ll text you if I have some change of plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk. See you tomorrow.\u201d he kisses her cheek and goes away.</p><p>Harper was already in bed when Chris starts a facetime with her.</p><p>\u201cHey handsome, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything hurts. I\u2019m old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not old. I promise you lots of massage when you get back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, babe. How was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of work\u2026but it\u2019s nice to be recording. I think we\u2019ll be able to finish some tracks this week. They only have three weeks to do it all so I can\u2019t really try to fix every little thing, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah..but you\u2019ll do great. I wanted to see you in my bed. Is your cousin\u2019s flat okay? Do you have anything you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you know what? It\u2019s in Sebastian\u2019s building!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was leaving to work and he entered the elevator, do you believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited him and Emmy to dinner tonight, but she couldn\u2019t come\u2026It was nice anyway, he\u2019s so sweet\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you were here, it was nice\u2026I had a lot of fun\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did. Well, I have to go, I\u2019ll take some pain killer and try to sleep, talk to you in the morning..\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, good night, sugar, nice dreams\u201d</p><p>After hanging up with Harper, Chris puts his head under the pillow. He wants to yell and cry and throw things, but all he does is take big breathes. Maybe Adam is right. Maybe she\u2019s not what he thought. He wants to call her back but he didn\u2019t know what to say, what to ask\u2026maybe meeting someone so soon was a mistake after all.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHPHqRE0Z92Ed5hlLvX6vA\">@xceafh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vV9Tri3x7cdvHjM9IL-5w\">@mackevanstanfan80</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a></p></p>",

The place is a little studio with a tiny kitchen and fewer windows than she likes, but well, it&rsquo;s not like she has many choices. She&rsquo;s not going to stay in Chris&rsquo; place alone, it feels wrong. Everything feels kind of wrong today.</p><p>Leaving to work, she&rsquo;s in the elevator when it stops at the 5th floor. When the doors open, Sebastian was there. &ldquo;Harper?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey. Hi.&rdquo; They hug and he kisses her cheek. &ldquo;What you&rsquo;re doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I live here.
