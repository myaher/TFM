        "answer": "<p>Based on their initial interactions in\u00a0\u201cFriends Like These\u201d and the basketball game in \u201cThe Snorpion\u201d, it\u2019s made pretty clear that TJ is overcompensating because he doesn\u2019t want to be beaten/upstaged by a girl.\u00a0</p><p>If you want a more psychological breakdown, my best theory would be something along these lines: Prior to ever meeting Buffy, TJ has created this persona at school in which he is the tough guy, and people buy into it. When you are treated like you\u2019re famous, or infamous, it goes to your head and you play it up more and more. So by that point in time, he is already convinced he is untouchable and he plays up that persona even more when his friends from the basketball team are around.\u00a0</p><p>I am also willing to bet that by this point, he has internally latched onto this idea that basketball is <i>the</i>\u00a0thing he is good at. Like he may struggle in school and no tutor can handle him and he may have a lot of\u00a0\u201cstuff\u201d, but as long as he is still a top athlete he has something going for him, that kind of thing. So he overcompensates to protect that idea for himself.\u00a0</p><p>What\u2019s interesting is when we see him later in\u00a0\u201cThe Snorpion\u201d, where he and Buffy talk outside of the record shop\u2026 when she first approaches him, he isn\u2019t actually mean to her. He seems to be caught off guard, but he says hey and then listens to what she has to say. Implying that much of the jerk-vibes he let off in their earlier scenes together were because his hype men were around. She asks what she can do to make him not hate her, and he answers honestly. He wanted her to switch to a girls\u2019 team, which only reinforces the idea that he is overcompensating because he doesn\u2019t want her to upstage him. This could be based in the insecurities he has about how other people view him, but also how he views himself.\u00a0</p><p>Throughout the learning disability storyline, I think he still struggles with caring what other people think about him - but I think the struggle for him is more how he thinks about himself. Like when he starts to feel insecure, he seems to just shut down. When he runs out on Buffy before going to the swing set, I don\u2019t think he actually cared whether or not she thought he was stupid, he just didn\u2019t want to <i>feel\u00a0</i>stupid. And usually, being around Buffy made him feel poorly about himself in general, because she was good in school and sports and friends. He didn\u2019t know how to deal with his own self-loathing around someone like that.\u00a0</p><p>But I think throughout the rest of season two, there is a shift in which it becomes clear that TJ isn\u2019t being a jerk on purpose. It\u2019s just all he knows how to do. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t really like watering his self-improvement down to being <i>for\u00a0</i>Cyrus. It\u2019s more than that. As he tries to better himself, there\u2019s a genuine struggle to do so. He didn\u2019t tell the coach that Buffy did his homework to get her in trouble, he did it because he was trying to be honest. But when Buffy accused him of doing it to spite her, when she said that everything he says is a lie, he agrees with her because it\u2019s easier to keep being the bad guy than to keep showing his vulnerability in trying to become a better person.\u00a0</p><p>From their earliest interactions, in my opinion, you can see that his problem is not with Buffy, but with himself.\u00a0</p>",

Like he may struggle in school and no tutor can handle him and he may have a lot of&nbsp;&ldquo;stuff&rdquo;, but as long as he is still a top athlete he has something going for him, that kind of thing. So he overcompensates to protect that idea for himself.&nbsp;</p><p>What&rsquo;s interesting is when we see him later in&nbsp;&ldquo;The Snorpion&rdquo;, where he and Buffy talk outside of the record shop&hellip; when she first approaches him, he isn&rsquo;t actually mean to her. He seems to be caught off guard, but he says hey and then listens to what she has to say. Implying that much of the jerk-vibes he let off in their earlier scenes together were because his hype men were around. She asks what she can do to make him not hate her, and he answers honestly. He wanted her to switch to a girls&rsquo; team, which only reinforces the idea that he is overcompensating because he doesn&rsquo;t want her to upstage him. This could be based in the insecurities he has about how other people view him, but also how he views himself.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the learning disability storyline, I think he still struggles with caring what other people think about him - but I think the struggle for him is more how he thinks about himself. Like when he starts to feel insecure, he seems to just shut down. When he runs out on Buffy before going to the swing set, I don&rsquo;t think he actually cared whether or not she thought he was stupid, he just didn&rsquo;t want to <i>feel&nbsp;</i>stupid. And usually, being around Buffy made him feel poorly about himself in general, because she was good in school and sports and friends. He didn&rsquo;t know how to deal with his own self-loathing around someone like that.&nbsp;</p><p>But I think throughout the rest of season two, there is a shift in which it becomes clear that TJ isn&rsquo;t being a jerk on purpose. It&rsquo;s just all he knows how to do. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t really like watering his self-improvement down to being <i>for&nbsp;</i>Cyrus. It&rsquo;s more than that. As he tries to better himself, there&rsquo;s a genuine struggle to do so. He didn&rsquo;t tell the coach that Buffy did his homework to get her in trouble, he did it because he was trying to be honest. But when Buffy accused him of doing it to spite her, when she said that everything he says is a lie, he agrees with her because it&rsquo;s easier to keep being the bad guy than to keep showing his vulnerability in trying to become a better person.&nbsp;</p><p>From their earliest interactions, in my opinion, you can see that his problem is not with Buffy, but with himself.&nbsp;</p>",
