Evil.</p><p>Aziraphale would love collecting all those ancient artifacts and lost books, and would convince Gunther to go on vacation to the desert just so he can roam freely through the museum.</p><p>Crowley would <b>love </b>the sauna, with its tropical garden upper floor, and would stay there for hours, just barely making it to Az&rsquo;s farmhouse (since his cabin is too far away and all the good stuff is at Aziraphale&rsquo;s, who has a <b><span style=\"color: #000000\">cellar</span></b><span style=\"color: #000000\">!!)</span></p><p>Also their greenhouse would have plenty of fruit trees and just the one apple tree right in the middle.</p><p>Since each farm can fit up to 4 people, we&rsquo;d still have room for 2 more! All those great dynamics!!!</p><p>Like, one is Pollution and spends the day fishing and the other one is Brian and spends all the day foraging and cleaning the forest.</p><p>Or Gabriel and Beelzebub, they build a coop each, side by side, and fight to see who gets better produce from the animals under their <strike>care</strike> command.</p><p>Or Beel and Dagon who just stay in their cabin minding their own business</p><p>Or Hastur &amp; Ligur who spend days lurking around Pelican Town {they have the &ldquo;not fainting at 2am&rdquo; mod active}</p><p>Or Sable who is trying to buy Gus out of business, while Pollution does their thing and floods the streets with trash</p><p>You could also have Anathema and Madame Tracy, because they&rsquo;re the ones who know how to do shit around the farm, and they&rsquo;d eventually befriend the wizard and witch. Anathema would totally manage several Slime farms and some rabbits and ducks, for their feathers and amulets.</p><p>And Shadwell and Newt would be ALL about completing the Community Center just to cach a glimpse of the Junimos and learn more about them/count their nipples and exorcise them if necessary.</p><p>Michael, Uriel and Sandalphon are too good to dirty their hands with all this nonsense.

                "content": "<p>&ldquo;You like me, right?&rdquo; Aziraphale asked, while he sceptically eyed a plate of dinner he would usually have devoured by now. Not that Crowley would ever call it &lsquo;devouring&rsquo; to the angel&rsquo;s face. Right now, however, he looked demotivated at best and downright depressed at worst, and then there was this question.</p><p>&ldquo;Would I have chased after you for the last six thousand years if I didn&rsquo;t like you?&rdquo; he asked back. Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t meet his eyes and Crowley hated that. </p><p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; he replied quietly and chewed &ndash; <i>chewed</i> &ndash; on a spoonful of mashed potatoes. &ldquo;But do you actually like <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley swallowed down the impulse to ask him if he knew how absolutely daft he was being, and instead, gently took the cutlery from between Aziraphale&rsquo;s fingers and grasped his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; he asked, internally triumphant at how\tcalm it sounded.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you attracted to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What have I ever done, that led you to believe otherwise?&rdquo; He looked into Aziraphale&rsquo;s eyes and encountered an insecurity he had seen before, but he still didn&rsquo;t know where it stemmed from.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Aziraphale admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I meant physically. Are you physically attracted to me?&rdquo; Aziraphale asked and looked at the wall somewhere behind Crowley. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; Crowley said and didn&rsquo;t dare ask further questions. He just sat still and held Aziraphale&rsquo;s hands between his own, while he waited for Aziraphale to direct the conversation further.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not &ndash; you like me, even though I&rsquo;m a bit pudgy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why ever wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Crowley asked. He couldn&rsquo;t believe Aziraphale was doubting himself over something like this.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Aziraphale said, looking small and fragile suddenly. Crowley leaned forward, across the corner of the table and pressed a gentle kiss against the corner of Aziraphale&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, angel. I&rsquo;d feel the same for you, in any shape you could possibly have. But the one you do have is just perfect and I wouldn&rsquo;t change it for the world.&rdquo;</p><p>There were tears in the angel&rsquo;s eyes, which Crowley decided to ignore, squeezing Aziraphale&rsquo;s hands, before letting go.
