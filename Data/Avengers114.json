His throat was\nragged, and there was that distinct metallic, coppery taste in his\nmouth that he hated. His neck and shoulders were sore, the kinds of\naches that threatened to become part of his body. He leaned against\nthe side wall of the elevator and jabbed blindly at the button for\nhis floor. He could feel the blood on his hands. He\u2019d cleaned up on\nthe jet, of course, but&hellip;the blood was still there. He could feel it\nburning into his skin. It\u2019d never not be there. He finally gave in\nto his body\u2019s primary demand: he let his eyelids droop closed, in\nsome feeble attempt to shut out the broken, teeming world that he had\nto see every day.</p><p><br/></p><p>He didn\u2019t even\nreally open his eyes when the elevator stopped and the doors slid\nopen; he just readjusted his bag on his shoulder and took a step out.\nSome time to himself, that\u2019d be good. Some time to exist in his own\nspace, in his own past.</p><!-- more --><p>If he wasn\u2019t so\nwrapped up in his own mind, he would have noticed faster. Tonight,\nthough, he didn\u2019t. The elevator hadn\u2019t taken him to his own\nfloor. It had dropped him off right in the middle of one of the\ncommon floors. If he\u2019d been paying attention, he would have noticed\nright away that the room sounded wrong, that it smelled wrong, that\nit was the wrong temperature. As it was, he got one full step out of\nthe elevator before things clicked. And that was enough.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHey, stranger.\u201d\nIt was you. Of course it was you. He could see the side of your head,\njust barely popping up over the back of the couch. He knew without\nlooking that you had wedged yourself into the corner with your legs\nstretched out on the cushions in front of you. There was probably a\nbook in your lap. No, there was almost definitely a book in your lap.</p><p><br/></p><p>He wanted to turn on\nthe ball of his foot and stalk right back into the elevator, but now\nhe couldn\u2019t. It was all too easy to imagine the expression that\nwould contort the lovely features of your face. Worry, of course, and\nmaybe a little sadness, but definitely the worry. Any time that he\u2019d\never hurt you because of any of his bullshit baggage, that was what\nyou looked like. That always made it worse. You never yelled at him\nlike he deserved for hurting you. Instead, you were concerned about\nhim, always convinced that there was something bad going on inside\nhis head that was causing these issues. It was one of the many things\nthat made it easy for him to love you.</p><p><br/></p><p>But it also made it\nreal damn hard to lock himself away from you.</p><p><br/></p><p>He let his bag swing\ndown off of his shoulder, dumping it rather unceremoniously on the\nground before taking a step toward you. \u201cHiya, kid.\u201d He wasn\u2019t\nsure he was fit for anything more affectionate than that, but\nsomething inside him was warming at just the sight of you. You looked\nup to meet his gaze and gave him that smile he loved: that wide,\nsunny smile that lit up your whole face. The first time you\u2019d\nsmiled at him like that, he almost couldn\u2019t believe it. Someone\nlike you, looking at someone like him like <i>that</i>. It was the\nbeginning of the end for him. Now, even after all this time, that\nsmile was still all it took to strike him dumb. His hand twitched at\nhis side, aching to reach up to caress your cheek, but he refrained.\nCouldn\u2019t help but smile back at you, though.</p><p>And that\u2019s when he\nnoticed, really noticed it: You were wearing his sweatshirt.</p><p><br/></p><p>He loved seeing you\nin his clothes. That was probably standard, really, but it didn\u2019t\nchange how he felt about it. He pretended to be annoyed whenever one\nof his shirts went missing, only to reappear on you, but&hellip;he wasn\u2019t.\nEvery time he saw you swathed in the same material that had once\nrested against his own skin, the same little thrill rushed through\nhim. He especially loved pressing his nose to your neck and breathing\nin the scent of you, the both of you\u2014your skin and his co-mingling.\nThere was something about it that made him feel like he was allowed\nto be there, that he was&hellip;permitted. If someone like you could let\nhim, in, surely that had to mean something. He took a few more steps\ntoward you, around the couch.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou cold?\u201d His\nvoice sounded rusty as he gestured toward your choice of outfit. If\nhis stunted fucking awkwardness ever put you off, you\u2019d never given\nany sign of it. True to form, you merely closed your book and let it\nrest on your legs.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\nwas.\u201d You tilted your head back to get a better look at him. \u201cI\u2019m\nnot now.\u201d Despite\nyour sweetness and light, there was still a guardedness in your face\nwhen you looked at him sometimes. To be honest, it made him feel\nbetter. It told him that you didn\u2019t enjoy spending time with him\nsimply because you were naive and over-trusting. You knew what he\nwas, what a relationship with the Winter Soldier could\nentail. Tonight, despite everything else he was feeling, he was\nstruck with the urge to kneel at\nyour feet and try to kiss\naway that little crease between your eyebrows. \u201cHow\u2019re you\ndoing?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBeen\nbetter.\u201d He didn\u2019t like lying to you. Sometimes the honesty made\nhim nervous, like eventually he\u2019d just be Too Much and you\u2019d have\nto leave, but the alternative was unthinkable. He rubbed the back of\nhis neck, mostly as an excuse to look away. \u201cThings went\nbad.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAre\nyou hurt?\u201d He felt, more than saw, your eyes travel the length of\nhis body, looking for signs of injury. He dropped his arm and shook\nhis head. He wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d gotten hurt. Killing was what\nhe was built for, after all. The silence thickened between you, a\nclear sign that you understood what he was telling you. \u201cYou&hellip;want\nto join me, or\u2026?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>You\nknew. Warmth flooded through his body\u2014he could actually feel some\nof the tension leave his muscles. You knew how he dealt with missions\nlike these, and you were giving him an out. Only moment ago, he\u2019d\nwanted to retreat into the elevator and hide himself in his own room,\nbut now that you were telling him he could go, he wanted nothing more\nthan to stay here. With\nyou. He nodded, just once, but it was enough. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>You\nslid one leg off of the couch, probably trying to readjust your\nposition, but he moved before you could finish. He knelt between your\nlegs and stretched out on top of you, burying his face in your neck.\nHe\u2019d been gone long enough that his sweatshirt now smelled mostly\nlike you, but he was glad to\nbreathe you in. You\ntightened your arms around him, and suddenly, for the first time in\nweeks, he felt grounded. How did you do that? \n</p><p><br/></p><p>He\nlifted his head just enough to press his lips against the skin of\nyour neck. In response, you made that sound he loved\u2014that\nhalf-sigh, half-whimper that you only ever made for him. He slipped\nhis gloved\nhand beneath you, splaying his fingers out against your back as he\nheld your body closer to his. You\nwriggled beneath him, adjusting your position so you were lying down\nmore than sitting, and the movement made his hoodie ride up. He\npressed his free hand against the skin of your belly. You were always\nso warm. He traced abstract patterns against your tender skin until\nyou stilled his fingers with your hand.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt\ntickles,\u201d you whispered, and your voice held just a trace of\nself-consciousness. He smiled to himself and kissed your neck again.</p><p><br/></p><p>But\nit was hard to stop touching you. He\u2019d been by himself for weeks\nnow, thinking about you the way a thirsty man thinks\nabout water. He put a little more weight into his touch and lifted\nhis head to check on you. You were already looking at him with a\ncertain kind of haziness in your gaze. It warmed him. He knew he had\nto look the same. You bit your lower lip and nodded, somehow knowing\nwhat he was looking for, and then let your head drop back against the\narm of the couch.</p><p><br/></p><p>God,\nit could be hard to look at you like this sometimes. Spread out\nunderneath him, so vulnerable and yet so open. On really bad nights,\nhe couldn\u2019t shake the intrusive thoughts that crept in like poison:\nhow easy it would be to wrap his fist around your throat, or to slide\nthe dagger out of his boot. But tonight, it was easier to push them\naway. You both knew what he was. You both knew that, theoretically,\nit could be very easy for him to hurt you right now. But more\nimportantly, you both knew that that would never happen. So you let\nyourself be soft and warm beneath him, and he let himself enjoy it.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nlook&hellip;\u201d He swallowed thickly. \u201c&hellip;real nice in my clothes.\u201d It\nwas hard to get\nhis mind around how you did it so easily: wrapped his scent around\nyou like it was something to be proud of, especially in common areas\nof the tower like this. You weren\u2019t afraid of people seeing you.\nGranted, the people who would see you were more or less his friends,\nbut it still seemed like such a Statement to him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt\nmakes it easier when you\u2019re not home.\u201d You reached up to gently\ntug his hair out of the tie he used to keep it out of his face, then\nworked your fingers through his hair. Fuck, you felt good.\nHe hadn\u2019t even realized how much tension there was in his scalp\nuntil you came along to work it out. \u201cMakes me feel like you\u2019re\nhere. I missed you.\u201d You kept your voice soft, like maybe you were\nafraid to say anything at all. Before this was a common thing, the\ndarkness in his mind might have convinced him that you didn\u2019t want\nto admit it. Now that he knew you, however, he knew that you just\ndidn\u2019t want to make him feel bad for leaving. The warmth that he\nwas feeling shifted, then, became something a little sharper and more\npressing. He let his fingers dip beneath the waistband of your pajama\npants.</p><p><br/></p><p>He\nheard you draw in a breath\u2014something quick, something soft\u2014and\ndrank in the way you arched into his touch. \u201cI\nmissed you too.\u201d He lowered his mouth to taste your\nskin. He could feel your\npulse quicken as he dipped his hand lower, as he ghosted his fingers\nalong your outer lips. You sighed that sigh again, but it was a\nlittle sharper this time, a little more insistent. Any other night he\nmight have drawn it out, teased you a while. He loved hearing you\nplead with him even though you both knew he\u2019d never leave you\nunsatisfied.\n\n</p><p><br/></p><p>Tonight,\nthough, he wanted the\nconnection. He needed to feel you. He bit down gently as he parted\nyou, as he drew lazy circles around your clit. You were already wet,\nhe realized with a rush. Not dripping or anything ridiculous, but wet\nenough to coat his fingers right away. Just from lying here with him?\nJust from feeling him? He felt a moan rumble through his chest, and\nyou echoed the sentiment.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\n<i>really</i> missed you,\u201d\nyou whispered again. He could hear the sheepish smile that curled\nyour lips, but he closed his mouth over yours without looking. You\nopened to him immediately, letting your tongue slide against his even\nas his fingers moved against you. He shifted to press his erection\nagainst your thigh. He\u2019d always felt a little silly doing that,\nlike some schoolboy rutting against his first sweetheart, but you\nalways seemed to like it. Sure\nenough, you whimpered and tightened your fingers in his hair. He\ncouldn\u2019t keep from smiling.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\nmissed you too,\u201d he said when you finally broke the kiss to\nbreathe. He rubbed his nose against the soft skin just behind your\near. How was it possible for someone to smell so good? He readjusted\nhis hand so he could press his fingers inside you and stroke you with\nhis thumb. You matched his thrusts effortlessly, rolling your hips to\ngrind yourself against his hand. Times like these, he knew you were\nhis. Something in his chest called out to you. He knew he was yours,\ntoo.\n\u201cYou gonna come? Gonna come right here for me?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>The\nonly response you could manage was still another whimper and the\nbarest hint of a nod. Even that was a gift to him. That you let him\nsee you like this: wordless, desperate. Some nights, that was why he\ndrew it out so long. Tonight, he slanted his mouth over yours again.\nYou\u2019d been apart too long. He needed to feel you coming. He didn\u2019t\nslow down as he felt your muscles tensing, didn\u2019t pull back to\ntease you. Instead, he felt his own breath catch in his throat as\nyour pleasure swelled, crested, broke. You moaned into his mouth and\nhe drank the sound hungrily, kissing you deeply as you writhed\nagainst him. He didn\u2019t stop\ntouching you. He knew your body\nwell enough to know that he could work you through several more\nlittle aftershocks before you\u2019d try to push him away. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>You\nshivered in his arms despite the heat that was pouring off of your\nskin. <i>That\u2019s my girl.</i>\nThe words sprang into his mind, but he didn\u2019t say them out loud. A\ndifferent time. A different night. Tonight he let his fingers go\nstill and rested his forehead against yours. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>He\ncould kill people. He did kill people\u2014regularly and often without a\nsecond thought. His hands had been the end for any number of people,\nand he couldn\u2019t know how many more such deaths awaited people in\nthe future. But his hands could also do that to you: make you go all\nwarm and writhing and make you hold on to him like he was the one\nthing that held you to this earth. Maybe it was selfish to treasure\nyour climaxes like that, but he did it anyway.</p><p><br/></p><p>Before\nlong, he heard you swallow, felt you arch into him again. \u201cI need\nyou.\u201d Your voice was soft, like it\u2019d been all night, but he\ndidn\u2019t hear any more self-consciousness in it. He\ncould listen to that all night. You\ntugged gently on his hair again, like you were trying to make\nsure he\u2019d heard you. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>He\nsmiled despite himself and pulled himself up so he was kneeling\nbetween your legs again. It didn\u2019t feel like the right time to make\na stupid joke about it being his pleasure, or doing whatever it took\nto please his girl. He worked the fly on his pants to free his\nerection even as you tugged your pajamas down just far enough. You\nboth had beds, and private bedrooms, only a short elevator\ntrip away, but the urgency in\nyour voice and in his body made that irrelevant. He positioned\nhimself at your entrance and watched, transfixed, as he rubbed\nhimself against you. You sighed, almost with relief.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\npretty sure Stark\u2019s got cameras rigged up everywhere,\u201d he warned.\n</p><p><br/></p><p>You\nscoffed. \u201cLet him watch. Just <i>fuck</i>\nme, Buck.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>That\nwas all it took to push aside any of his lingering doubts. He\nstretched back out over you, bracing himself against the couch with\none arm and pulling you closer to him with the other. As he did, he\npushed his way inside you. You were so fucking <i>hot</i>.\nThe warmth seemed to spread through his body, soothing him in ways\nthat nothing else could. It was hard to think. He moved slowly, not\nin any particular hurry for this to be over.\nYou\nwere stretched so tight around him that he worried about hurting you,\nbut there was no sign of pain in your movements or your voice. You\nbreathed his name as he moved inside you, dug your fingers into his\nback. God, he\u2019d missed\nthis. He could feel your muscles clenching around him, sometimes\nalmost tightly enough to hold him in place. He buried his face in\nyour neck again and sucked a mark into your skin. It was stupid. You\nwere both grown adults with no need for hickeys, but he loved marking\nyou up. He liked\nknowing that he could leave marks that weren\u2019t scars. He loved\nseeing them on you the next day. It was like how you wore his clothes\nin public, but so much more intimate. You shuddered beneath him.\nHe\nfelt your nails scraping his skin.\n<i>Fuck</i>.</p><p><br/></p><p>His\nwhole world became the rhythm and the feel of you and the way you\nsaid his name. Everyone else\nin the Tower could have come parading through the room and he\nwouldn\u2019t have noticed. Or cared. Your\nbodies moved together, practically as one, arching together, then\nseparating only as far as was absolutely necessary. He felt, more\nthan heard, a sob wrack through you and he faltered, alarmed, as he\nstudied your face. You must have known what he was thinking, because\nyou opened your eyes and managed a smile.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIs\nthis okay?\u201d Stopping at this point could well and truly destroy\nhim, but he\u2019d rather die than hurt you. A quick laugh bubbled out\nof you, much as that sob had, and you nodded vehemently.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nfeel so <i>good</i>.\u201d Your\nvoice was a whine. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>He\ncould swear that he felt his heart swell. Maybe\nhe knew what you meant. There wasn\u2019t much else he could do right\nnow to deal with all this fucking <i>love</i>\nhe felt. Whether he deserved all this or not, it was here. You were\nhere. He pressed his forehead to yours again. \u201cJust keep doing what\nyou\u2019re doing, baby.\u201d You felt so <i>good</i>\nwrapped around him like this, but he couldn\u2019t quite summon the\ncourage to speak those words out loud.</p><p><br/></p><p>He\nwas getting close. His muscles were tensing. He was throbbing inside\nyou, which only served to make each thrust feel even better. It took\nevery ounce of self-control to keep from suddenly letting loose, to\nkeep from readjusting his position so he could fuck you into the\ncouch. That wasn\u2019t what this was about. That wasn\u2019t really what\neither of you needed. Instead, he maintained the same slow, steady,\n<i>tortuous</i> pace and\npulled your earlobe between his teeth. You were close too. He could\nhear it in your breathing. He growled softly in your ear the way he\nknew you liked, telling you how beautiful you were, how good,\nhow much he fucking loved you.</p><p><br/></p><p>It\nmust have done the trick. He felt you clamp down around him, felt the\nfluttery spasms in your muscles that told him you were coming. That\nwas all he needed. He came too: hard, and buried deep inside you. You\nwere all he could think about. You. The scent of you. The way you\nfelt. The sounds you made. The things you did to him. If he held you\ntoo tightly, you gave no sign of it.</p><p><br/></p><p>When\nhis body came back to normal, he opened his eyes. You were stroking\ngentle fingers through his hair.\nWhen he looked at you, you were already looking at him. Your eyes\nwere soft, and you smiled at him. What could he ever possibly have\ndone to deserve any fraction of you? He\nmight have mused on that a while, spinning out into who knows what\nkind of self-loathing tangents, but just then, you yawned. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Somewhat\nreluctantly, he untangled himself from you and sat up. Exhaustion had\nstolen through his body and replaced all his tension with sheer\nleaden weight, but he found it in himself to fasten his pants and\nhelp you tug your pajamas back into place. He forced himself to his\nfeet and offered you his hand. \u201cTake me to bed?\u201d He flashed what\nhe hoped was a charming smile. You let him help you to your feet.\nYour hand felt small in his; he raised it to his lips to kiss your\nknuckles.</p><p><br/></p><p>Whatever\nhe\u2019d done to deserve all this, he thought to himself even as you\ntugged him gently towards the elevator, he wanted to keep doing it\nfor the rest of his life.</p>",

Some time to exist in his own\nspace, in his own past.</p>[[MORE]]<p>If he wasn\u2019t so\nwrapped up in his own mind, he would have noticed faster. Tonight,\nthough, he didn\u2019t. The elevator hadn\u2019t taken him to his own\nfloor. It had dropped him off right in the middle of one of the\ncommon floors. If he\u2019d been paying attention, he would have noticed\nright away that the room sounded wrong, that it smelled wrong, that\nit was the wrong temperature. As it was, he got one full step out of\nthe elevator before things clicked. And that was enough.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey, stranger.\u201d\nIt was you. Of course it was you. He could see the side of your head,\njust barely popping up over the back of the couch. He knew without\nlooking that you had wedged yourself into the corner with your legs\nstretched out on the cushions in front of you. There was probably a\nbook in your lap. No, there was almost definitely a book in your lap.</p><p><br></p><p>He wanted to turn on\nthe ball of his foot and stalk right back into the elevator, but now\nhe couldn\u2019t. It was all too easy to imagine the expression that\nwould contort the lovely features of your face. Worry, of course, and\nmaybe a little sadness, but definitely the worry. Any time that he\u2019d\never hurt you because of any of his bullshit baggage, that was what\nyou looked like. That always made it worse. You never yelled at him\nlike he deserved for hurting you. Instead, you were concerned about\nhim, always convinced that there was something bad going on inside\nhis head that was causing these issues. It was one of the many things\nthat made it easy for him to love you.</p><p><br></p><p>But it also made it\nreal damn hard to lock himself away from you.</p><p><br></p><p>He let his bag swing\ndown off of his shoulder, dumping it rather unceremoniously on the\nground before taking a step toward you. \u201cHiya, kid.\u201d He wasn\u2019t\nsure he was fit for anything more affectionate than that, but\nsomething inside him was warming at just the sight of you. You looked\nup to meet his gaze and gave him that smile he loved: that wide,\nsunny smile that lit up your whole face. The first time you\u2019d\nsmiled at him like that, he almost couldn\u2019t believe it. Someone\nlike you, looking at someone like him like <i>that</i>. It was the\nbeginning of the end for him. Now, even after all this time, that\nsmile was still all it took to strike him dumb. His hand twitched at\nhis side, aching to reach up to caress your cheek, but he refrained.\nCouldn\u2019t help but smile back at you, though.</p><p>And that\u2019s when he\nnoticed, really noticed it: You were wearing his sweatshirt.</p><p><br></p><p>He loved seeing you\nin his clothes. That was probably standard, really, but it didn\u2019t\nchange how he felt about it. He pretended to be annoyed whenever one\nof his shirts went missing, only to reappear on you, but\u2026he wasn\u2019t.\nEvery time he saw you swathed in the same material that had once\nrested against his own skin, the same little thrill rushed through\nhim. He especially loved pressing his nose to your neck and breathing\nin the scent of you, the both of you\u2014your skin and his co-mingling.\nThere was something about it that made him feel like he was allowed\nto be there, that he was\u2026permitted. If someone like you could let\nhim, in, surely that had to mean something. He took a few more steps\ntoward you, around the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou cold?\u201d His\nvoice sounded rusty as he gestured toward your choice of outfit. If\nhis stunted fucking awkwardness ever put you off, you\u2019d never given\nany sign of it. True to form, you merely closed your book and let it\nrest on your legs.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nwas.\u201d You tilted your head back to get a better look at him. \u201cI\u2019m\nnot now.\u201d Despite\nyour sweetness and light, there was still a guardedness in your face\nwhen you looked at him sometimes. To be honest, it made him feel\nbetter. It told him that you didn\u2019t enjoy spending time with him\nsimply because you were naive and over-trusting. You knew what he\nwas, what a relationship with the Winter Soldier could\nentail. Tonight, despite everything else he was feeling, he was\nstruck with the urge to kneel at\nyour feet and try to kiss\naway that little crease between your eyebrows. \u201cHow\u2019re you\ndoing?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBeen\nbetter.\u201d He didn\u2019t like lying to you. Sometimes the honesty made\nhim nervous, like eventually he\u2019d just be Too Much and you\u2019d have\nto leave, but the alternative was unthinkable. He rubbed the back of\nhis neck, mostly as an excuse to look away. \u201cThings went\nbad.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAre\nyou hurt?\u201d He felt, more than saw, your eyes travel the length of\nhis body, looking for signs of injury. He dropped his arm and shook\nhis head. He wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d gotten hurt. Killing was what\nhe was built for, after all. The silence thickened between you, a\nclear sign that you understood what he was telling you. \u201cYou\u2026want\nto join me, or\u2026?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You\nknew. Warmth flooded through his body\u2014he could actually feel some\nof the tension leave his muscles. You knew how he dealt with missions\nlike these, and you were giving him an out. Only moment ago, he\u2019d\nwanted to retreat into the elevator and hide himself in his own room,\nbut now that you were telling him he could go, he wanted nothing more\nthan to stay here. With\nyou. He nodded, just once, but it was enough. \n</p><p><br></p><p>You\nslid one leg off of the couch, probably trying to readjust your\nposition, but he moved before you could finish. He knelt between your\nlegs and stretched out on top of you, burying his face in your neck.\nHe\u2019d been gone long enough that his sweatshirt now smelled mostly\nlike you, but he was glad to\nbreathe you in. You\ntightened your arms around him, and suddenly, for the first time in\nweeks, he felt grounded. How did you do that? \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nlifted his head just enough to press his lips against the skin of\nyour neck. In response, you made that sound he loved\u2014that\nhalf-sigh, half-whimper that you only ever made for him. He slipped\nhis gloved\nhand beneath you, splaying his fingers out against your back as he\nheld your body closer to his. You\nwriggled beneath him, adjusting your position so you were lying down\nmore than sitting, and the movement made his hoodie ride up. He\npressed his free hand against the skin of your belly. You were always\nso warm. He traced abstract patterns against your tender skin until\nyou stilled his fingers with your hand.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\ntickles,\u201d you whispered, and your voice held just a trace of\nself-consciousness. He smiled to himself and kissed your neck again.</p><p><br></p><p>But\nit was hard to stop touching you. He\u2019d been by himself for weeks\nnow, thinking about you the way a thirsty man thinks\nabout water. He put a little more weight into his touch and lifted\nhis head to check on you. You were already looking at him with a\ncertain kind of haziness in your gaze. It warmed him. He knew he had\nto look the same. You bit your lower lip and nodded, somehow knowing\nwhat he was looking for, and then let your head drop back against the\narm of the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>God,\nit could be hard to look at you like this sometimes. Spread out\nunderneath him, so vulnerable and yet so open. On really bad nights,\nhe couldn\u2019t shake the intrusive thoughts that crept in like poison:\nhow easy it would be to wrap his fist around your throat, or to slide\nthe dagger out of his boot. But tonight, it was easier to push them\naway. You both knew what he was. You both knew that, theoretically,\nit could be very easy for him to hurt you right now. But more\nimportantly, you both knew that that would never happen. So you let\nyourself be soft and warm beneath him, and he let himself enjoy it.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\nlook\u2026\u201d He swallowed thickly. \u201c\u2026real nice in my clothes.\u201d It\nwas hard to get\nhis mind around how you did it so easily: wrapped his scent around\nyou like it was something to be proud of, especially in common areas\nof the tower like this. You weren\u2019t afraid of people seeing you.\nGranted, the people who would see you were more or less his friends,\nbut it still seemed like such a Statement to him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\nmakes it easier when you\u2019re not home.\u201d You reached up to gently\ntug his hair out of the tie he used to keep it out of his face, then\nworked your fingers through his hair. Fuck, you felt good.\nHe hadn\u2019t even realized how much tension there was in his scalp\nuntil you came along to work it out. \u201cMakes me feel like you\u2019re\nhere. I missed you.\u201d You kept your voice soft, like maybe you were\nafraid to say anything at all. Before this was a common thing, the\ndarkness in his mind might have convinced him that you didn\u2019t want\nto admit it. Now that he knew you, however, he knew that you just\ndidn\u2019t want to make him feel bad for leaving. The warmth that he\nwas feeling shifted, then, became something a little sharper and more\npressing. He let his fingers dip beneath the waistband of your pajama\npants.</p><p><br></p><p>He\nheard you draw in a breath\u2014something quick, something soft\u2014and\ndrank in the way you arched into his touch. \u201cI\nmissed you too.\u201d He lowered his mouth to taste your\nskin. He could feel your\npulse quicken as he dipped his hand lower, as he ghosted his fingers\nalong your outer lips. You sighed that sigh again, but it was a\nlittle sharper this time, a little more insistent. Any other night he\nmight have drawn it out, teased you a while. He loved hearing you\nplead with him even though you both knew he\u2019d never leave you\nunsatisfied.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>Tonight,\nthough, he wanted the\nconnection. He needed to feel you. He bit down gently as he parted\nyou, as he drew lazy circles around your clit. You were already wet,\nhe realized with a rush. Not dripping or anything ridiculous, but wet\nenough to coat his fingers right away. Just from lying here with him?\nJust from feeling him? He felt a moan rumble through his chest, and\nyou echoed the sentiment.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\n<i>really</i> missed you,\u201d\nyou whispered again. He could hear the sheepish smile that curled\nyour lips, but he closed his mouth over yours without looking. You\nopened to him immediately, letting your tongue slide against his even\nas his fingers moved against you. He shifted to press his erection\nagainst your thigh. He\u2019d always felt a little silly doing that,\nlike some schoolboy rutting against his first sweetheart, but you\nalways seemed to like it. Sure\nenough, you whimpered and tightened your fingers in his hair. He\ncouldn\u2019t keep from smiling.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nmissed you too,\u201d he said when you finally broke the kiss to\nbreathe. He rubbed his nose against the soft skin just behind your\near. How was it possible for someone to smell so good? He readjusted\nhis hand so he could press his fingers inside you and stroke you with\nhis thumb. You matched his thrusts effortlessly, rolling your hips to\ngrind yourself against his hand. Times like these, he knew you were\nhis. Something in his chest called out to you. He knew he was yours,\ntoo.\n\u201cYou gonna come? Gonna come right here for me?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The\nonly response you could manage was still another whimper and the\nbarest hint of a nod. Even that was a gift to him. That you let him\nsee you like this: wordless, desperate. Some nights, that was why he\ndrew it out so long. Tonight, he slanted his mouth over yours again.\nYou\u2019d been apart too long. He needed to feel you coming. He didn\u2019t\nslow down as he felt your muscles tensing, didn\u2019t pull back to\ntease you. Instead, he felt his own breath catch in his throat as\nyour pleasure swelled, crested, broke. You moaned into his mouth and\nhe drank the sound hungrily, kissing you deeply as you writhed\nagainst him. He didn\u2019t stop\ntouching you. He knew your body\nwell enough to know that he could work you through several more\nlittle aftershocks before you\u2019d try to push him away. \n</p><p><br></p><p>You\nshivered in his arms despite the heat that was pouring off of your\nskin. <i>That\u2019s my girl.</i>\nThe words sprang into his mind, but he didn\u2019t say them out loud. A\ndifferent time. A different night. Tonight he let his fingers go\nstill and rested his forehead against yours. \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\ncould kill people. He did kill people\u2014regularly and often without a\nsecond thought. His hands had been the end for any number of people,\nand he couldn\u2019t know how many more such deaths awaited people in\nthe future. But his hands could also do that to you: make you go all\nwarm and writhing and make you hold on to him like he was the one\nthing that held you to this earth. Maybe it was selfish to treasure\nyour climaxes like that, but he did it anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>Before\nlong, he heard you swallow, felt you arch into him again. \u201cI need\nyou.\u201d Your voice was soft, like it\u2019d been all night, but he\ndidn\u2019t hear any more self-consciousness in it. He\ncould listen to that all night. You\ntugged gently on his hair again, like you were trying to make\nsure he\u2019d heard you. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He\nsmiled despite himself and pulled himself up so he was kneeling\nbetween your legs again. It didn\u2019t feel like the right time to make\na stupid joke about it being his pleasure, or doing whatever it took\nto please his girl. He worked the fly on his pants to free his\nerection even as you tugged your pajamas down just far enough. You\nboth had beds, and private bedrooms, only a short elevator\ntrip away, but the urgency in\nyour voice and in his body made that irrelevant. He positioned\nhimself at your entrance and watched, transfixed, as he rubbed\nhimself against you. You sighed, almost with relief.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\npretty sure Stark\u2019s got cameras rigged up everywhere,\u201d he warned.\n</p><p><br></p><p>You\nscoffed. \u201cLet him watch. Just <i>fuck</i>\nme, Buck.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>That\nwas all it took to push aside any of his lingering doubts. He\nstretched back out over you, bracing himself against the couch with\none arm and pulling you closer to him with the other. As he did, he\npushed his way inside you. You were so fucking <i>hot</i>.\nThe warmth seemed to spread through his body, soothing him in ways\nthat nothing else could. It was hard to think. He moved slowly, not\nin any particular hurry for this to be over.\nYou\nwere stretched so tight around him that he worried about hurting you,\nbut there was no sign of pain in your movements or your voice. You\nbreathed his name as he moved inside you, dug your fingers into his\nback. God, he\u2019d missed\nthis. He could feel your muscles clenching around him, sometimes\nalmost tightly enough to hold him in place. He buried his face in\nyour neck again and sucked a mark into your skin. It was stupid. You\nwere both grown adults with no need for hickeys, but he loved marking\nyou up. He liked\nknowing that he could leave marks that weren\u2019t scars. He loved\nseeing them on you the next day. It was like how you wore his clothes\nin public, but so much more intimate. You shuddered beneath him.\nHe\nfelt your nails scraping his skin.\n<i>Fuck</i>.</p><p><br></p><p>His\nwhole world became the rhythm and the feel of you and the way you\nsaid his name. Everyone else\nin the Tower could have come parading through the room and he\nwouldn\u2019t have noticed. Or cared. Your\nbodies moved together, practically as one, arching together, then\nseparating only as far as was absolutely necessary. He felt, more\nthan heard, a sob wrack through you and he faltered, alarmed, as he\nstudied your face. You must have known what he was thinking, because\nyou opened your eyes and managed a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs\nthis okay?\u201d Stopping at this point could well and truly destroy\nhim, but he\u2019d rather die than hurt you. A quick laugh bubbled out\nof you, much as that sob had, and you nodded vehemently.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\nfeel so <i>good</i>.\u201d Your\nvoice was a whine. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He\ncould swear that he felt his heart swell. Maybe\nhe knew what you meant. There wasn\u2019t much else he could do right\nnow to deal with all this fucking <i>love</i>\nhe felt. Whether he deserved all this or not, it was here. You were\nhere. He pressed his forehead to yours again. \u201cJust keep doing what\nyou\u2019re doing, baby.\u201d You felt so <i>good</i>\nwrapped around him like this, but he couldn\u2019t quite summon the\ncourage to speak those words out loud.</p><p><br></p><p>He\nwas getting close. His muscles were tensing. He was throbbing inside\nyou, which only served to make each thrust feel even better. It took\nevery ounce of self-control to keep from suddenly letting loose, to\nkeep from readjusting his position so he could fuck you into the\ncouch. That wasn\u2019t what this was about. That wasn\u2019t really what\neither of you needed. Instead, he maintained the same slow, steady,\n<i>tortuous</i> pace and\npulled your earlobe between his teeth. You were close too. He could\nhear it in your breathing. He growled softly in your ear the way he\nknew you liked, telling you how beautiful you were, how good,\nhow much he fucking loved you.</p><p><br></p><p>It\nmust have done the trick. He felt you clamp down around him, felt the\nfluttery spasms in your muscles that told him you were coming. That\nwas all he needed. He came too: hard, and buried deep inside you. You\nwere all he could think about. You. The scent of you. The way you\nfelt. The sounds you made. The things you did to him. If he held you\ntoo tightly, you gave no sign of it.</p><p><br></p><p>When\nhis body came back to normal, he opened his eyes. You were stroking\ngentle fingers through his hair.\nWhen he looked at you, you were already looking at him. Your eyes\nwere soft, and you smiled at him. What could he ever possibly have\ndone to deserve any fraction of you? He\nmight have mused on that a while, spinning out into who knows what\nkind of self-loathing tangents, but just then, you yawned. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Somewhat\nreluctantly, he untangled himself from you and sat up. Exhaustion had\nstolen through his body and replaced all his tension with sheer\nleaden weight, but he found it in himself to fasten his pants and\nhelp you tug your pajamas back into place. He forced himself to his\nfeet and offered you his hand. \u201cTake me to bed?\u201d He flashed what\nhe hoped was a charming smile. You let him help you to your feet.\nYour hand felt small in his; he raised it to his lips to kiss your\nknuckles.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever\nhe\u2019d done to deserve all this, he thought to himself even as you\ntugged him gently towards the elevator, he wanted to keep doing it\nfor the rest of his life.</p>",

His throat was\nragged, and there was that distinct metallic, coppery taste in his\nmouth that he hated. His neck and shoulders were sore, the kinds of\naches that threatened to become part of his body. He leaned against\nthe side wall of the elevator and jabbed blindly at the button for\nhis floor. He could feel the blood on his hands. He\u2019d cleaned up on\nthe jet, of course, but\u2026the blood was still there. He could feel it\nburning into his skin. It\u2019d never not be there. He finally gave in\nto his body\u2019s primary demand: he let his eyelids droop closed, in\nsome feeble attempt to shut out the broken, teeming world that he had\nto see every day.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn\u2019t even\nreally open his eyes when the elevator stopped and the doors slid\nopen; he just readjusted his bag on his shoulder and took a step out.\nSome time to himself, that\u2019d be good. Some time to exist in his own\nspace, in his own past.</p>[[MORE]]<p>If he wasn\u2019t so\nwrapped up in his own mind, he would have noticed faster. Tonight,\nthough, he didn\u2019t. The elevator hadn\u2019t taken him to his own\nfloor. It had dropped him off right in the middle of one of the\ncommon floors. If he\u2019d been paying attention, he would have noticed\nright away that the room sounded wrong, that it smelled wrong, that\nit was the wrong temperature. As it was, he got one full step out of\nthe elevator before things clicked. And that was enough.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey, stranger.\u201d\nIt was you. Of course it was you. He could see the side of your head,\njust barely popping up over the back of the couch. He knew without\nlooking that you had wedged yourself into the corner with your legs\nstretched out on the cushions in front of you. There was probably a\nbook in your lap. No, there was almost definitely a book in your lap.</p><p><br></p><p>He wanted to turn on\nthe ball of his foot and stalk right back into the elevator, but now\nhe couldn\u2019t. It was all too easy to imagine the expression that\nwould contort the lovely features of your face. Worry, of course, and\nmaybe a little sadness, but definitely the worry. Any time that he\u2019d\never hurt you because of any of his bullshit baggage, that was what\nyou looked like. That always made it worse. You never yelled at him\nlike he deserved for hurting you. Instead, you were concerned about\nhim, always convinced that there was something bad going on inside\nhis head that was causing these issues. It was one of the many things\nthat made it easy for him to love you.</p><p><br></p><p>But it also made it\nreal damn hard to lock himself away from you.</p><p><br></p><p>He let his bag swing\ndown off of his shoulder, dumping it rather unceremoniously on the\nground before taking a step toward you. \u201cHiya, kid.\u201d He wasn\u2019t\nsure he was fit for anything more affectionate than that, but\nsomething inside him was warming at just the sight of you. You looked\nup to meet his gaze and gave him that smile he loved: that wide,\nsunny smile that lit up your whole face. The first time you\u2019d\nsmiled at him like that, he almost couldn\u2019t believe it. Someone\nlike you, looking at someone like him like <i>that</i>. It was the\nbeginning of the end for him. Now, even after all this time, that\nsmile was still all it took to strike him dumb. His hand twitched at\nhis side, aching to reach up to caress your cheek, but he refrained.\nCouldn\u2019t help but smile back at you, though.</p><p>And that\u2019s when he\nnoticed, really noticed it: You were wearing his sweatshirt.</p><p><br></p><p>He loved seeing you\nin his clothes. That was probably standard, really, but it didn\u2019t\nchange how he felt about it. He pretended to be annoyed whenever one\nof his shirts went missing, only to reappear on you, but\u2026he wasn\u2019t.\nEvery time he saw you swathed in the same material that had once\nrested against his own skin, the same little thrill rushed through\nhim. He especially loved pressing his nose to your neck and breathing\nin the scent of you, the both of you\u2014your skin and his co-mingling.\nThere was something about it that made him feel like he was allowed\nto be there, that he was\u2026permitted. If someone like you could let\nhim, in, surely that had to mean something. He took a few more steps\ntoward you, around the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou cold?\u201d His\nvoice sounded rusty as he gestured toward your choice of outfit. If\nhis stunted fucking awkwardness ever put you off, you\u2019d never given\nany sign of it. True to form, you merely closed your book and let it\nrest on your legs.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nwas.\u201d You tilted your head back to get a better look at him. \u201cI\u2019m\nnot now.\u201d Despite\nyour sweetness and light, there was still a guardedness in your face\nwhen you looked at him sometimes. To be honest, it made him feel\nbetter. It told him that you didn\u2019t enjoy spending time with him\nsimply because you were naive and over-trusting. You knew what he\nwas, what a relationship with the Winter Soldier could\nentail. Tonight, despite everything else he was feeling, he was\nstruck with the urge to kneel at\nyour feet and try to kiss\naway that little crease between your eyebrows. \u201cHow\u2019re you\ndoing?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBeen\nbetter.\u201d He didn\u2019t like lying to you. Sometimes the honesty made\nhim nervous, like eventually he\u2019d just be Too Much and you\u2019d have\nto leave, but the alternative was unthinkable. He rubbed the back of\nhis neck, mostly as an excuse to look away. \u201cThings went\nbad.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAre\nyou hurt?\u201d He felt, more than saw, your eyes travel the length of\nhis body, looking for signs of injury. He dropped his arm and shook\nhis head. He wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d gotten hurt. Killing was what\nhe was built for, after all. The silence thickened between you, a\nclear sign that you understood what he was telling you. \u201cYou\u2026want\nto join me, or\u2026?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You\nknew. Warmth flooded through his body\u2014he could actually feel some\nof the tension leave his muscles. You knew how he dealt with missions\nlike these, and you were giving him an out. Only moment ago, he\u2019d\nwanted to retreat into the elevator and hide himself in his own room,\nbut now that you were telling him he could go, he wanted nothing more\nthan to stay here. With\nyou. He nodded, just once, but it was enough. \n</p><p><br></p><p>You\nslid one leg off of the couch, probably trying to readjust your\nposition, but he moved before you could finish. He knelt between your\nlegs and stretched out on top of you, burying his face in your neck.\nHe\u2019d been gone long enough that his sweatshirt now smelled mostly\nlike you, but he was glad to\nbreathe you in. You\ntightened your arms around him, and suddenly, for the first time in\nweeks, he felt grounded. How did you do that? \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nlifted his head just enough to press his lips against the skin of\nyour neck. In response, you made that sound he loved\u2014that\nhalf-sigh, half-whimper that you only ever made for him. He slipped\nhis gloved\nhand beneath you, splaying his fingers out against your back as he\nheld your body closer to his. You\nwriggled beneath him, adjusting your position so you were lying down\nmore than sitting, and the movement made his hoodie ride up. He\npressed his free hand against the skin of your belly. You were always\nso warm. He traced abstract patterns against your tender skin until\nyou stilled his fingers with your hand.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\ntickles,\u201d you whispered, and your voice held just a trace of\nself-consciousness. He smiled to himself and kissed your neck again.</p><p><br></p><p>But\nit was hard to stop touching you. He\u2019d been by himself for weeks\nnow, thinking about you the way a thirsty man thinks\nabout water. He put a little more weight into his touch and lifted\nhis head to check on you. You were already looking at him with a\ncertain kind of haziness in your gaze. It warmed him. He knew he had\nto look the same. You bit your lower lip and nodded, somehow knowing\nwhat he was looking for, and then let your head drop back against the\narm of the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>God,\nit could be hard to look at you like this sometimes. Spread out\nunderneath him, so vulnerable and yet so open. On really bad nights,\nhe couldn\u2019t shake the intrusive thoughts that crept in like poison:\nhow easy it would be to wrap his fist around your throat, or to slide\nthe dagger out of his boot. But tonight, it was easier to push them\naway. You both knew what he was. You both knew that, theoretically,\nit could be very easy for him to hurt you right now. But more\nimportantly, you both knew that that would never happen. So you let\nyourself be soft and warm beneath him, and he let himself enjoy it.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\nlook\u2026\u201d He swallowed thickly. \u201c\u2026real nice in my clothes.\u201d It\nwas hard to get\nhis mind around how you did it so easily: wrapped his scent around\nyou like it was something to be proud of, especially in common areas\nof the tower like this. You weren\u2019t afraid of people seeing you.\nGranted, the people who would see you were more or less his friends,\nbut it still seemed like such a Statement to him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\nmakes it easier when you\u2019re not home.\u201d You reached up to gently\ntug his hair out of the tie he used to keep it out of his face, then\nworked your fingers through his hair. Fuck, you felt good.\nHe hadn\u2019t even realized how much tension there was in his scalp\nuntil you came along to work it out. \u201cMakes me feel like you\u2019re\nhere. I missed you.\u201d You kept your voice soft, like maybe you were\nafraid to say anything at all. Before this was a common thing, the\ndarkness in his mind might have convinced him that you didn\u2019t want\nto admit it. Now that he knew you, however, he knew that you just\ndidn\u2019t want to make him feel bad for leaving. The warmth that he\nwas feeling shifted, then, became something a little sharper and more\npressing. He let his fingers dip beneath the waistband of your pajama\npants.</p><p><br></p><p>He\nheard you draw in a breath\u2014something quick, something soft\u2014and\ndrank in the way you arched into his touch. \u201cI\nmissed you too.\u201d He lowered his mouth to taste your\nskin. He could feel your\npulse quicken as he dipped his hand lower, as he ghosted his fingers\nalong your outer lips. You sighed that sigh again, but it was a\nlittle sharper this time, a little more insistent. Any other night he\nmight have drawn it out, teased you a while. He loved hearing you\nplead with him even though you both knew he\u2019d never leave you\nunsatisfied.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>Tonight,\nthough, he wanted the\nconnection. He needed to feel you. He bit down gently as he parted\nyou, as he drew lazy circles around your clit. You were already wet,\nhe realized with a rush. Not dripping or anything ridiculous, but wet\nenough to coat his fingers right away. Just from lying here with him?\nJust from feeling him? He felt a moan rumble through his chest, and\nyou echoed the sentiment.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\n<i>really</i> missed you,\u201d\nyou whispered again. He could hear the sheepish smile that curled\nyour lips, but he closed his mouth over yours without looking. You\nopened to him immediately, letting your tongue slide against his even\nas his fingers moved against you. He shifted to press his erection\nagainst your thigh. He\u2019d always felt a little silly doing that,\nlike some schoolboy rutting against his first sweetheart, but you\nalways seemed to like it. Sure\nenough, you whimpered and tightened your fingers in his hair. He\ncouldn\u2019t keep from smiling.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nmissed you too,\u201d he said when you finally broke the kiss to\nbreathe. He rubbed his nose against the soft skin just behind your\near. How was it possible for someone to smell so good? He readjusted\nhis hand so he could press his fingers inside you and stroke you with\nhis thumb. You matched his thrusts effortlessly, rolling your hips to\ngrind yourself against his hand. Times like these, he knew you were\nhis. Something in his chest called out to you. He knew he was yours,\ntoo.\n\u201cYou gonna come? Gonna come right here for me?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The\nonly response you could manage was still another whimper and the\nbarest hint of a nod. Even that was a gift to him. That you let him\nsee you like this: wordless, desperate. Some nights, that was why he\ndrew it out so long. Tonight, he slanted his mouth over yours again.\nYou\u2019d been apart too long. He needed to feel you coming. He didn\u2019t\nslow down as he felt your muscles tensing, didn\u2019t pull back to\ntease you. Instead, he felt his own breath catch in his throat as\nyour pleasure swelled, crested, broke. You moaned into his mouth and\nhe drank the sound hungrily, kissing you deeply as you writhed\nagainst him. He didn\u2019t stop\ntouching you. He knew your body\nwell enough to know that he could work you through several more\nlittle aftershocks before you\u2019d try to push him away. \n</p><p><br></p><p>You\nshivered in his arms despite the heat that was pouring off of your\nskin. <i>That\u2019s my girl.</i>\nThe words sprang into his mind, but he didn\u2019t say them out loud. A\ndifferent time. A different night. Tonight he let his fingers go\nstill and rested his forehead against yours. \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\ncould kill people. He did kill people\u2014regularly and often without a\nsecond thought. His hands had been the end for any number of people,\nand he couldn\u2019t know how many more such deaths awaited people in\nthe future. But his hands could also do that to you: make you go all\nwarm and writhing and make you hold on to him like he was the one\nthing that held you to this earth. Maybe it was selfish to treasure\nyour climaxes like that, but he did it anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>Before\nlong, he heard you swallow, felt you arch into him again. \u201cI need\nyou.\u201d Your voice was soft, like it\u2019d been all night, but he\ndidn\u2019t hear any more self-consciousness in it. He\ncould listen to that all night. You\ntugged gently on his hair again, like you were trying to make\nsure he\u2019d heard you. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He\nsmiled despite himself and pulled himself up so he was kneeling\nbetween your legs again. It didn\u2019t feel like the right time to make\na stupid joke about it being his pleasure, or doing whatever it took\nto please his girl. He worked the fly on his pants to free his\nerection even as you tugged your pajamas down just far enough. You\nboth had beds, and private bedrooms, only a short elevator\ntrip away, but the urgency in\nyour voice and in his body made that irrelevant. He positioned\nhimself at your entrance and watched, transfixed, as he rubbed\nhimself against you. You sighed, almost with relief.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\npretty sure Stark\u2019s got cameras rigged up everywhere,\u201d he warned.\n</p><p><br></p><p>You\nscoffed. \u201cLet him watch. Just <i>fuck</i>\nme, Buck.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>That\nwas all it took to push aside any of his lingering doubts. He\nstretched back out over you, bracing himself against the couch with\none arm and pulling you closer to him with the other. As he did, he\npushed his way inside you. You were so fucking <i>hot</i>.\nThe warmth seemed to spread through his body, soothing him in ways\nthat nothing else could. It was hard to think. He moved slowly, not\nin any particular hurry for this to be over.\nYou\nwere stretched so tight around him that he worried about hurting you,\nbut there was no sign of pain in your movements or your voice. You\nbreathed his name as he moved inside you, dug your fingers into his\nback. God, he\u2019d missed\nthis. He could feel your muscles clenching around him, sometimes\nalmost tightly enough to hold him in place. He buried his face in\nyour neck again and sucked a mark into your skin. It was stupid. You\nwere both grown adults with no need for hickeys, but he loved marking\nyou up. He liked\nknowing that he could leave marks that weren\u2019t scars. He loved\nseeing them on you the next day. It was like how you wore his clothes\nin public, but so much more intimate. You shuddered beneath him.\nHe\nfelt your nails scraping his skin.\n<i>Fuck</i>.</p><p><br></p><p>His\nwhole world became the rhythm and the feel of you and the way you\nsaid his name. Everyone else\nin the Tower could have come parading through the room and he\nwouldn\u2019t have noticed. Or cared. Your\nbodies moved together, practically as one, arching together, then\nseparating only as far as was absolutely necessary. He felt, more\nthan heard, a sob wrack through you and he faltered, alarmed, as he\nstudied your face. You must have known what he was thinking, because\nyou opened your eyes and managed a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs\nthis okay?\u201d Stopping at this point could well and truly destroy\nhim, but he\u2019d rather die than hurt you. A quick laugh bubbled out\nof you, much as that sob had, and you nodded vehemently.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\nfeel so <i>good</i>.\u201d Your\nvoice was a whine. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He\ncould swear that he felt his heart swell. Maybe\nhe knew what you meant. There wasn\u2019t much else he could do right\nnow to deal with all this fucking <i>love</i>\nhe felt. Whether he deserved all this or not, it was here. You were\nhere. He pressed his forehead to yours again. \u201cJust keep doing what\nyou\u2019re doing, baby.\u201d You felt so <i>good</i>\nwrapped around him like this, but he couldn\u2019t quite summon the\ncourage to speak those words out loud.</p><p><br></p><p>He\nwas getting close. His muscles were tensing. He was throbbing inside\nyou, which only served to make each thrust feel even better. It took\nevery ounce of self-control to keep from suddenly letting loose, to\nkeep from readjusting his position so he could fuck you into the\ncouch. That wasn\u2019t what this was about. That wasn\u2019t really what\neither of you needed. Instead, he maintained the same slow, steady,\n<i>tortuous</i> pace and\npulled your earlobe between his teeth. You were close too. He could\nhear it in your breathing. He growled softly in your ear the way he\nknew you liked, telling you how beautiful you were, how good,\nhow much he fucking loved you.</p><p><br></p><p>It\nmust have done the trick. He felt you clamp down around him, felt the\nfluttery spasms in your muscles that told him you were coming. That\nwas all he needed. He came too: hard, and buried deep inside you. You\nwere all he could think about. You. The scent of you. The way you\nfelt. The sounds you made. The things you did to him. If he held you\ntoo tightly, you gave no sign of it.</p><p><br></p><p>When\nhis body came back to normal, he opened his eyes. You were stroking\ngentle fingers through his hair.\nWhen he looked at you, you were already looking at him. Your eyes\nwere soft, and you smiled at him. What could he ever possibly have\ndone to deserve any fraction of you? He\nmight have mused on that a while, spinning out into who knows what\nkind of self-loathing tangents, but just then, you yawned. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Somewhat\nreluctantly, he untangled himself from you and sat up. Exhaustion had\nstolen through his body and replaced all his tension with sheer\nleaden weight, but he found it in himself to fasten his pants and\nhelp you tug your pajamas back into place. He forced himself to his\nfeet and offered you his hand. \u201cTake me to bed?\u201d He flashed what\nhe hoped was a charming smile. You let him help you to your feet.\nYour hand felt small in his; he raised it to his lips to kiss your\nknuckles.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever\nhe\u2019d done to deserve all this, he thought to himself even as you\ntugged him gently towards the elevator, he wanted to keep doing it\nfor the rest of his life.</p>",

He took a few more steps\ntoward you, around the couch.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You cold?&rdquo; His\nvoice sounded rusty as he gestured toward your choice of outfit. If\nhis stunted fucking awkwardness ever put you off, you&rsquo;d never given\nany sign of it. True to form, you merely closed your book and let it\nrest on your legs.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nwas.&rdquo; You tilted your head back to get a better look at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nnot now.&rdquo; Despite\nyour sweetness and light, there was still a guardedness in your face\nwhen you looked at him sometimes. To be honest, it made him feel\nbetter. It told him that you didn&rsquo;t enjoy spending time with him\nsimply because you were naive and over-trusting. You knew what he\nwas, what a relationship with the Winter Soldier could\nentail. Tonight, despite everything else he was feeling, he was\nstruck with the urge to kneel at\nyour feet and try to kiss\naway that little crease between your eyebrows. &ldquo;How&rsquo;re you\ndoing?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Been\nbetter.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t like lying to you. Sometimes the honesty made\nhim nervous, like eventually he&rsquo;d just be Too Much and you&rsquo;d have\nto leave, but the alternative was unthinkable. He rubbed the back of\nhis neck, mostly as an excuse to look away. &ldquo;Things went\nbad.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are\nyou hurt?&rdquo; He felt, more than saw, your eyes travel the length of\nhis body, looking for signs of injury. He dropped his arm and shook\nhis head. He wasn&rsquo;t the one who&rsquo;d gotten hurt. Killing was what\nhe was built for, after all. The silence thickened between you, a\nclear sign that you understood what he was telling you. &ldquo;You&hellip;want\nto join me, or&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>You\nknew. Warmth flooded through his body&mdash;he could actually feel some\nof the tension leave his muscles. You knew how he dealt with missions\nlike these, and you were giving him an out. Only moment ago, he&rsquo;d\nwanted to retreat into the elevator and hide himself in his own room,\nbut now that you were telling him he could go, he wanted nothing more\nthan to stay here. With\nyou. He nodded, just once, but it was enough. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>You\nslid one leg off of the couch, probably trying to readjust your\nposition, but he moved before you could finish. He knelt between your\nlegs and stretched out on top of you, burying his face in your neck.\nHe&rsquo;d been gone long enough that his sweatshirt now smelled mostly\nlike you, but he was glad to\nbreathe you in. You\ntightened your arms around him, and suddenly, for the first time in\nweeks, he felt grounded. How did you do that? \n</p><p><br /></p><p>He\nlifted his head just enough to press his lips against the skin of\nyour neck. In response, you made that sound he loved&mdash;that\nhalf-sigh, half-whimper that you only ever made for him. He slipped\nhis gloved\nhand beneath you, splaying his fingers out against your back as he\nheld your body closer to his. You\nwriggled beneath him, adjusting your position so you were lying down\nmore than sitting, and the movement made his hoodie ride up. He\npressed his free hand against the skin of your belly. You were always\nso warm. He traced abstract patterns against your tender skin until\nyou stilled his fingers with your hand.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It\ntickles,&rdquo; you whispered, and your voice held just a trace of\nself-consciousness. He smiled to himself and kissed your neck again.</p><p><br /></p><p>But\nit was hard to stop touching you. He&rsquo;d been by himself for weeks\nnow, thinking about you the way a thirsty man thinks\nabout water. He put a little more weight into his touch and lifted\nhis head to check on you. You were already looking at him with a\ncertain kind of haziness in your gaze. It warmed him. He knew he had\nto look the same. You bit your lower lip and nodded, somehow knowing\nwhat he was looking for, and then let your head drop back against the\narm of the couch.</p><p><br /></p><p>God,\nit could be hard to look at you like this sometimes. Spread out\nunderneath him, so vulnerable and yet so open. On really bad nights,\nhe couldn&rsquo;t shake the intrusive thoughts that crept in like poison:\nhow easy it would be to wrap his fist around your throat, or to slide\nthe dagger out of his boot. But tonight, it was easier to push them\naway. You both knew what he was. You both knew that, theoretically,\nit could be very easy for him to hurt you right now. But more\nimportantly, you both knew that that would never happen. So you let\nyourself be soft and warm beneath him, and he let himself enjoy it.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nlook&hellip;&rdquo; He swallowed thickly. &ldquo;&hellip;real nice in my clothes.&rdquo; It\nwas hard to get\nhis mind around how you did it so easily: wrapped his scent around\nyou like it was something to be proud of, especially in common areas\nof the tower like this. You weren&rsquo;t afraid of people seeing you.\nGranted, the people who would see you were more or less his friends,\nbut it still seemed like such a Statement to him.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It\nmakes it easier when you&rsquo;re not home.&rdquo; You reached up to gently\ntug his hair out of the tie he used to keep it out of his face, then\nworked your fingers through his hair. Fuck, you felt good.\nHe hadn&rsquo;t even realized how much tension there was in his scalp\nuntil you came along to work it out. &ldquo;Makes me feel like you&rsquo;re\nhere. I missed you.&rdquo; You kept your voice soft, like maybe you were\nafraid to say anything at all. Before this was a common thing, the\ndarkness in his mind might have convinced him that you didn&rsquo;t want\nto admit it. Now that he knew you, however, he knew that you just\ndidn&rsquo;t want to make him feel bad for leaving. The warmth that he\nwas feeling shifted, then, became something a little sharper and more\npressing. He let his fingers dip beneath the waistband of your pajama\npants.</p><p><br /></p><p>He\nheard you draw in a breath&mdash;something quick, something soft&mdash;and\ndrank in the way you arched into his touch. &ldquo;I\nmissed you too.&rdquo; He lowered his mouth to taste your\nskin. He could feel your\npulse quicken as he dipped his hand lower, as he ghosted his fingers\nalong your outer lips. You sighed that sigh again, but it was a\nlittle sharper this time, a little more insistent. Any other night he\nmight have drawn it out, teased you a while. He loved hearing you\nplead with him even though you both knew he&rsquo;d never leave you\nunsatisfied.\n\n</p><p><br /></p><p>Tonight,\nthough, he wanted the\nconnection. He needed to feel you. He bit down gently as he parted\nyou, as he drew lazy circles around your clit. You were already wet,\nhe realized with a rush. Not dripping or anything ridiculous, but wet\nenough to coat his fingers right away. Just from lying here with him?\nJust from feeling him? He felt a moan rumble through his chest, and\nyou echoed the sentiment.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\n<i>really</i> missed you,&rdquo;\nyou whispered again. He could hear the sheepish smile that curled\nyour lips, but he closed his mouth over yours without looking. You\nopened to him immediately, letting your tongue slide against his even\nas his fingers moved against you. He shifted to press his erection\nagainst your thigh. He&rsquo;d always felt a little silly doing that,\nlike some schoolboy rutting against his first sweetheart, but you\nalways seemed to like it. Sure\nenough, you whimpered and tightened your fingers in his hair. He\ncouldn&rsquo;t keep from smiling.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nmissed you too,&rdquo; he said when you finally broke the kiss to\nbreathe. He rubbed his nose against the soft skin just behind your\near. How was it possible for someone to smell so good? He readjusted\nhis hand so he could press his fingers inside you and stroke you with\nhis thumb. You matched his thrusts effortlessly, rolling your hips to\ngrind yourself against his hand. Times like these, he knew you were\nhis. Something in his chest called out to you. He knew he was yours,\ntoo.\n&ldquo;You gonna come? Gonna come right here for me?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>The\nonly response you could manage was still another whimper and the\nbarest hint of a nod. Even that was a gift to him. That you let him\nsee you like this: wordless, desperate. Some nights, that was why he\ndrew it out so long. Tonight, he slanted his mouth over yours again.\nYou&rsquo;d been apart too long. He needed to feel you coming. He didn&rsquo;t\nslow down as he felt your muscles tensing, didn&rsquo;t pull back to\ntease you. Instead, he felt his own breath catch in his throat as\nyour pleasure swelled, crested, broke. You moaned into his mouth and\nhe drank the sound hungrily, kissing you deeply as you writhed\nagainst him. He didn&rsquo;t stop\ntouching you. He knew your body\nwell enough to know that he could work you through several more\nlittle aftershocks before you&rsquo;d try to push him away. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>You\nshivered in his arms despite the heat that was pouring off of your\nskin. <i>That&rsquo;s my girl.</i>\nThe words sprang into his mind, but he didn&rsquo;t say them out loud. A\ndifferent time. A different night. Tonight he let his fingers go\nstill and rested his forehead against yours. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>He\ncould kill people. He did kill people&mdash;regularly and often without a\nsecond thought. His hands had been the end for any number of people,\nand he couldn&rsquo;t know how many more such deaths awaited people in\nthe future. But his hands could also do that to you: make you go all\nwarm and writhing and make you hold on to him like he was the one\nthing that held you to this earth. Maybe it was selfish to treasure\nyour climaxes like that, but he did it anyway.</p><p><br /></p><p>Before\nlong, he heard you swallow, felt you arch into him again. &ldquo;I need\nyou.&rdquo; Your voice was soft, like it&rsquo;d been all night, but he\ndidn&rsquo;t hear any more self-consciousness in it. He\ncould listen to that all night. You\ntugged gently on his hair again, like you were trying to make\nsure he&rsquo;d heard you. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>He\nsmiled despite himself and pulled himself up so he was kneeling\nbetween your legs again. It didn&rsquo;t feel like the right time to make\na stupid joke about it being his pleasure, or doing whatever it took\nto please his girl. He worked the fly on his pants to free his\nerection even as you tugged your pajamas down just far enough. You\nboth had beds, and private bedrooms, only a short elevator\ntrip away, but the urgency in\nyour voice and in his body made that irrelevant. He positioned\nhimself at your entrance and watched, transfixed, as he rubbed\nhimself against you. You sighed, almost with relief.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\npretty sure Stark&rsquo;s got cameras rigged up everywhere,&rdquo; he warned.\n</p><p><br /></p><p>You\nscoffed. &ldquo;Let him watch. Just <i>fuck</i>\nme, Buck.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>That\nwas all it took to push aside any of his lingering doubts. He\nstretched back out over you, bracing himself against the couch with\none arm and pulling you closer to him with the other. As he did, he\npushed his way inside you. You were so fucking <i>hot</i>.\nThe warmth seemed to spread through his body, soothing him in ways\nthat nothing else could. It was hard to think. He moved slowly, not\nin any particular hurry for this to be over.\nYou\nwere stretched so tight around him that he worried about hurting you,\nbut there was no sign of pain in your movements or your voice. You\nbreathed his name as he moved inside you, dug your fingers into his\nback. God, he&rsquo;d missed\nthis. He could feel your muscles clenching around him, sometimes\nalmost tightly enough to hold him in place. He buried his face in\nyour neck again and sucked a mark into your skin. It was stupid. You\nwere both grown adults with no need for hickeys, but he loved marking\nyou up. He liked\nknowing that he could leave marks that weren&rsquo;t scars. He loved\nseeing them on you the next day. It was like how you wore his clothes\nin public, but so much more intimate. You shuddered beneath him.\nHe\nfelt your nails scraping his skin.\n<i>Fuck</i>.</p><p><br /></p><p>His\nwhole world became the rhythm and the feel of you and the way you\nsaid his name. Everyone else\nin the Tower could have come parading through the room and he\nwouldn&rsquo;t have noticed. Or cared. Your\nbodies moved together, practically as one, arching together, then\nseparating only as far as was absolutely necessary. He felt, more\nthan heard, a sob wrack through you and he faltered, alarmed, as he\nstudied your face. You must have known what he was thinking, because\nyou opened your eyes and managed a smile.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is\nthis okay?&rdquo; Stopping at this point could well and truly destroy\nhim, but he&rsquo;d rather die than hurt you. A quick laugh bubbled out\nof you, much as that sob had, and you nodded vehemently.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nfeel so <i>good</i>.&rdquo; Your\nvoice was a whine. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>He\ncould swear that he felt his heart swell. Maybe\nhe knew what you meant. There wasn&rsquo;t much else he could do right\nnow to deal with all this fucking <i>love</i>\nhe felt. Whether he deserved all this or not, it was here. You were\nhere. He pressed his forehead to yours again. &ldquo;Just keep doing what\nyou&rsquo;re doing, baby.&rdquo; You felt so <i>good</i>\nwrapped around him like this, but he couldn&rsquo;t quite summon the\ncourage to speak those words out loud.</p><p><br /></p><p>He\nwas getting close. His muscles were tensing. He was throbbing inside\nyou, which only served to make each thrust feel even better. It took\nevery ounce of self-control to keep from suddenly letting loose, to\nkeep from readjusting his position so he could fuck you into the\ncouch. That wasn&rsquo;t what this was about. That wasn&rsquo;t really what\neither of you needed. Instead, he maintained the same slow, steady,\n<i>tortuous</i> pace and\npulled your earlobe between his teeth. You were close too. He could\nhear it in your breathing. He growled softly in your ear the way he\nknew you liked, telling you how beautiful you were, how good,\nhow much he fucking loved you.</p><p><br /></p><p>It\nmust have done the trick. He felt you clamp down around him, felt the\nfluttery spasms in your muscles that told him you were coming. That\nwas all he needed. He came too: hard, and buried deep inside you. You\nwere all he could think about. You. The scent of you. The way you\nfelt. The sounds you made. The things you did to him. If he held you\ntoo tightly, you gave no sign of it.</p><p><br /></p><p>When\nhis body came back to normal, he opened his eyes. You were stroking\ngentle fingers through his hair.\nWhen he looked at you, you were already looking at him. Your eyes\nwere soft, and you smiled at him. What could he ever possibly have\ndone to deserve any fraction of you? He\nmight have mused on that a while, spinning out into who knows what\nkind of self-loathing tangents, but just then, you yawned. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Somewhat\nreluctantly, he untangled himself from you and sat up. Exhaustion had\nstolen through his body and replaced all his tension with sheer\nleaden weight, but he found it in himself to fasten his pants and\nhelp you tug your pajamas back into place. He forced himself to his\nfeet and offered you his hand. &ldquo;Take me to bed?&rdquo; He flashed what\nhe hoped was a charming smile. You let him help you to your feet.\nYour hand felt small in his; he raised it to his lips to kiss your\nknuckles.</p><p><br /></p><p>Whatever\nhe&rsquo;d done to deserve all this, he thought to himself even as you\ntugged him gently towards the elevator, he wanted to keep doing it\nfor the rest of his life.</p>",

His throat was\nragged, and there was that distinct metallic, coppery taste in his\nmouth that he hated. His neck and shoulders were sore, the kinds of\naches that threatened to become part of his body. He leaned against\nthe side wall of the elevator and jabbed blindly at the button for\nhis floor. He could feel the blood on his hands. He&rsquo;d cleaned up on\nthe jet, of course, but&hellip;the blood was still there. He could feel it\nburning into his skin. It&rsquo;d never not be there.
