Where the sea, sparkling in the sun, earns it the name \u201cJewel of the Antilles.\u201d An island where the poorest of peasants labor and the wealthiest of Sacred Bone play. Two different worlds on one island! The Sacred Bone, with their pale skins and their American ways, owners of the land and masters of their own fates. And the peasants, tan as sand and black as night, eternally at the mercy of the wind and the sea&hellip;Who pray constantly&hellip; to the gods.</p><p>On this new day, they said the usual prayers of a villager, \u201cRos\u00e9, grow me a garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease Kibum, don\u2019t flood my garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJiminie, who will my love be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeongyeon, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> come around me!\u201d</p><p>An older but spry older woman laughed and grabbed a visitor\u2019s hand, \u201cAh ha ha ha! Such powerful, such temperamental gods rule our island!\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>A woman with raspberry colored hair grabbed a table cloth and wrapped it around her waist, \u201cRos\u00e9, Mother of the Earth.\u201d and wrapped it around her waist.</p><p>\u201cKibum, God of Water!\u201d A man with a beautiful face and blue pants, a fisherman, put on a wave printed top. </p><p>A blonde boy with squishy cheeks, pushed down a short haired girl and placed a mosquito net around his shoulders like a shawl, \u201cJimin, beautiful God of Love.\u201d</p><p>The girl then stood up and slit a juicy pomegranate and let the juice run down her wrist, \u201cAnd Jeongyeon, sly Demon of Death.\u201d She laughed and pointed the knife at Jimin.</p><p>\u201cRos\u00e9, grow me a garden.\u201d They all echoed. \u201cPlease Kibum, don\u2019t flood my garden. Jiminie, who will my love be?\u201d A flower was placed in her lap. \u201cJeongyeon, don&rsquo;t come around me! Please, Kibum, don&rsquo;t flood my garden. Ros\u00e9, grow me a garden.\u201d</p><p>A villager with red hair and a wide smile picked up a small girl and swung her around while singing, \u201cWe dance~\u201d</p><p>To which the others repeated in a similar tune, \u201cWe dance~to the music of the gods.\u201d </p><p>The girl was set down and danced on her own now while the villagers began to sing, \u201cThe music of the breezes through the green plantain. The murmur of the river and the roar of rain and if the gods decide to send a hur-ri-cane\u2026\u201d A loud thump of a drum accented each syllable. \u201cWe dance~ to their everchanging moods.\u201d</p><p>Ros\u00e9 fanned herself and the little girl, \u201cWe know the gods are happy when the green things grow.\u201d</p><p>Key got her attention and added, \u201cThey\u2019re angry when the river starts to overflow.\u201d</p><p>The performers shook their hips and hands, \u201cAnd since we never know which way their winds will blow~We dance to the earth. We dance to the water. The gods awake and we take no chance.\u201d A small upbeat tune played and they continued. \u201cOur hearts hear the song. Our feet move along. And to the music of the gods, we dance!\u201d</p><p>Jimin guided the small girl and pointed to a place where the villagers mimicked proper posture, \u201cOn the other side of this island, safe behind high walls and iron gates, the Sacred Bone dance to a different tune.\u201d</p><p>The lighter skinned members served face and sung, \u201cLa la la la la la la la!\u201d</p><p>Water god Key folded his arms, \u201cThey drink champagne, entertain tourists at their fine hotels, and tell their servants\u2026\u201d</p><p>A taller man with broad shoulders clapped his hands together and spoke to a darker skinned man, \u201cPolish up the Mercedes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa la la la la la la la!\u201d</p><p>Taking the girl\u2019s dolls from her hands, Jeongyeon spread her arms wide, \u201cTwo different worlds, never meant to meet.\u201d</p><p>Feminine death looked at the girl and spoke with a man, \u201cThe peasants labor\u2014\u201d and then looked at the boy, speaking with a woman with long red hair, \u201cThe Sacred Bone eat!\u201d</p><p>The Sacred Bone paraded around saying, \u201cHow fine our clothes are! How fast we drive! We dance at parties&ndash;\u201d</p><p>Peasants interrupted, \u201cWhile we are dancing just to stay alive!\u201d The crescendo built and then softened.</p><p>\u201cWe dance~\u201d Said the women.</p><p>\u201cWe dance~\u201d Repeated the men.</p><p>Together, they asked, \u201cWhat else is there to do\u2026\u201d</p><p>The peasant men then acted out what they did, \u201cBut plant the seed and pull the weed and chop the cane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd bear the child and bear the load and bear the pain.\u201d The women did the same.</p><p>Then they sung together once again, \u201cAnd as the rich go racing to their own refrain, we dance to the earth, we dance to the water. The gods awake and we take no chance. Our hearts hear the song. Our feet move along. And to the music of the gods~\u201d</p><p>People clapped to the rhythm while others lifted their skirts to dance and even got visitors to move and groove along with them.</p><p>\u201cWe dance to the earth. We dance to the water. The gods awake and we take no chance\u2026\u201d</p><p>An older man seemingly married to the woman from before said, \u201cTwo different worlds, never meant to meet.\u201d</p><p>The music stopped and all heads turned towards the older woman who guided her there in the first place, \u201cBut if the gods move our feet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe daaaaance! We daaaaaance! We daaaaaannnnnnce!\u201d</p><p>With everything now settled, eyes settled on the one in the center who spoke:</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Our story begins on the night of a flood. Many huts washed away, many peasants drowned by Kibum\u2019s angry waters.</p><p>I was a child, walking home from the store in my hand me down red dress. The basket I was carrying was heavy enough to make my small body lean back in order to keep the groceries off the ground. Still, a lose grape fell onto the sandy dirt. I set the basket down to chase after it, and a small wave of water brought it back to me. Strange, I thought as I picked up the purple orb, water wasn\u2019t usually this close to the market. There was a lot more and coming right at me!</p><p>I rushed back to the basket, but before I knew it, my body had been swept up by the waves and my foods taken hostage by the misplaced sea. My mother had been in front of me with her own basket, calling my name. Now she screamed it as I was taken way too far away for me to ever here it being called again. Villagers of all sorts hurriedly packed up and grabbed their own children, racing for higher ground. Some sort of safety.</p><p>A panel of roofing came my way, and I grabbed it. When I was knocked off of it, I felt as though an orphan plucked from the flood by Kibum, sheltered in a tree by Ros\u00e9. And little did I know I\u2019d be sent on a journey by the gods. A journey that would test the strength of love against the power of <b>death</b>. On this island of two different worlds!</p><p>The story of (Y/N)!</p><p>I was just one small girl in a tree, torn from her mother. Crying in fright. One small girl tossed by sea and left to face the stormy night. I was one small girl. Holding tight&hellip;At last, the storm subsided and the morning sun glowed when two old peasants came cautiously down the road.</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon and Appa Shindong.</p><p>Taeyeon picked up a flower and tucked it in her hair, \u201cRos\u00e9 is smiling again, Shindong.\u201d</p><p>He was being grumpy, \u201cThis morning, she smiles. Last night, she tried to blow our heads off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHahahaha! Ah, Julian, just listen to those birds!\u201d</p><p>Coo coo coo coo coo. Coo coo coo coo coo.</p><p><i>Waah!!!</i> Sounded from up in a tree.<br/><br/>\u201cWhat kind of bird is that?\u201d Shindong asked.</p><p>His wife pointed to the tree, at me, \u201cLook! There! One small face, two small knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d When I gave no reply, she looked to her husband. \u201cThe girl can\u2019t speak.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the skies, \u201cAnd they\u2019re to blame. Kibum probably meant to kill her!\u201d</p><p>Taeyeon rolled her eyes, \u201cThen she\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible he forgot.\u201d</p><p>She looked around frightened the gods might be listening, \u201cShh! The gods don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they had some reason to spare her life. It\u2019s best that we don\u2019t know what.\u201d</p><p>His wife agreed even though she looked back at the child, \u201cOne small girl&hellip;better not.\u201d</p><p>They shook their heads and started to go, but then something magical came over them. That child needed someplace to live.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re too old for children.\u201d He tried to reason to himself.</p><p>She did the same, \u201cAnd we have no room and no food.\u201d</p><p>But I&ndash;the quiet girl in the tree&ndash;or something else, touched them deep inside. So not knowing quite why, they followed their hearts back to the tree, gently lifted the terrified child down\u2026</p><p>I screamed, \u201cNOOOOO!!!!\u201d</p><p><br/>And discovered I could speak after all. Now I had become one small girl in the way.Constantly hungry. They said I was learning too quick! Maybe because I was only about 6 when I learned how to climb to the top of the tallest palm tree without any help.</p><p>\u201cShe makes me smile.\u201d Appa Shindong said when he saw where I was and pointed it out to Eomma.</p><p>\u201cShe scares me sick!\u201d and she went pale at the sight of me so high. She clutched her heart and ordered the coconut gatherers to help me down.</p><p>But I lept right into my mother\u2019s arms from what didn\u2019t seem like a fifteen foot tree at the time. So they scolded and teased and held me. Ad mended the clothes I tore. The hut was crowded, and food was scarce. Yet somehow, their lives held more. They had one small girl to live for.</p><p>Because I had no idea of what my life was like or what my name was before the flood, they named me \u201cDesire\u0301e Dieu-Donne\u0301,\u201d or \u201cGod-Given Desire.\u201d But in their affection, they called me simply (Y/N).</p><p>I recall a time when I was around the age of 8 and my curious nature came into play, so I asked, \u201cWhat does (Y/N) mean, Eomma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means Little Orphan.\u201d She tapped my nose. \u201cYou\u2019re our sweet little orphan. We found you, and now your life is forever in our care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Appa answered, \u201cBecause the gods willed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>My mother shrugged, \u201cPerhaps they saved you for something special.\u201d</p><p>That simple answer made my eyes light up and I jumped up and down, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), if we knew why the gods did the things they do, we would be gods ourselves!\u201d</p><p>I puffed up my cheeks cutely, \u201cSomeday I\u2019m going to ask them, Eomma!\u201d</p><p>Both my parents giggled, and she ruffled my hair, \u201cFoolish girl! Run and hide!\u201d</p><p>Growing up, I was called both sweet as a eucalyptus and terrible as a tempest while I was banging a drum and humming a tune. I was (Y/N) and did what children did. Falling and running and calling and growing&hellip;and growing and growing and growing up too soon.</p><p>Ten years had passed and I had grown into a beautiful young woman. Sturdy from living a peasant\u2019s life and yet gentle with innocence claiming my heart. I folded the now dried blanket after taking it off the line, but soon slipped away to sit in a tree, allowing my mind to wander.<br/><br/>I was now one small girl that wasn\u2019t so small. Lost in my daydreams day after day.</p><p>\u201cCall her name.\u201d Appa Shindong said.</p><p>But Eomma Taeyeon replied, \u201cNo, don\u2019t call. Her ears don\u2019t hear, she\u2019s far away.\u201d</p><p>My parents watched from the distance, talking among themselves after my mother finished my folding for me.</p><p>He agreed, \u201cAnd I know that she\u2019s getting older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that it&rsquo;s meant to be.\u201d</p><p>Their arms couldn&rsquo;t hold me and keep me small, but all l that their hearts could see was one small girl. One small girl. Just one small girl in a tree.</p><p>The two then grabbed a few things before going to market. On their way, a car was speeding past and almost ran them over. No honking either, to warn pedestrians to get out of the way. The life of privilege wreaked of the silver mercedes. A few yelps of terror turned my attention to a stranger in white in a car. Going somewhere. Going far.</p><p>I wondered what it would be like to have a life like his.</p><p><i>How it must feel to go racing wherever you please, flying as free as a bird with his tail in the breeze.</i> I thought even the fish in the sea must be longing to fly after catching a glimpse of a stranger in white racing by.<br/><br/>\u201cOh, gods. Oh, gods, are you there?\u201d You asked aloud. \u201cWhat can I do to get you to look down and give in? Oh, gods. Oh, gods, hear my prayer!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m here in the field with my feet on the ground and my fate in the air waiting for life to begin! I knew that Eomma&rsquo;s contented and Appa accepts what he gets. They were happy for tea in their cups and no holes in their nets. Happy to have what they have and to stay where they are, they never even looked up at the sound of a car.</p><p>A stranger racing down the beach. Racing to places I was meant to reach! My imagination took a step further and imagined him there in the middle of the drum circle. I joined him and swung my hips to the rhythm. Then I imagined his car would stop and in I\u2019d hop and off we\u2019d drive!</p><p>We\u2019ll drive~! I turned around and he was gone.</p><p>I sighed and saw the setting sun. Had it already gotten this late? It was about time to go home. Before I did, I called for the Gods like I had been taught since I was little. I used my whole heart and my entire body.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods. Oh, gods. Please be there. Don\u2019t you remember your little (Y/N) from the tree?\u201d I even tried commanding them to see if I would get a sign. \u201cWake up! Look down! Hear my prayer! Don\u2019t single me out And then forget me! Oh, gods. Oh, gods, let me fly!\u201d I spread my arms like wings. \u201cSend me to places where no one before me has been. You spared my life; show me why. You get me to rise like a fish to the bait then tell me to wait. Well, I\u2019m waiting!\u201d I called to the heavens.</p><p>Waiting for life to begin!</p><hr><p><i>And the gods heard her prayer.</i> Had a good laugh about it too.<br/></p><p>Ros\u00e9 fanned herself, \u201cThe peasant girl wants a grand homme to carry her away! I should find a tree all covered with mangos&ndash;juicy mangos, fat and well-fed. Pick a mango\u2014\u201d She took the one she just made from the tree.</p><p>Kibum took it from her, \u201cA juicy mango.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lovely mango.\u201d Jimin added before the mango was taken from him.</p><p>It was by Jeongyeon who said, \u201cA poison mango\u2014\u201d</p><p>But everyone scowled at her. She just shrugged it away. As a demon of death, it was her job to kill people. Poison did that. Anyways, Ros\u00e9 dropped the mango. It made a whistling sound as it fell from the heavens. Then boom!</p><p>\u201cTo knock some sense in her head!\u201d</p><p>They laughed and repeated, \u201cKnock some sense in her head!\u201d</p><p>Kibum offered to, \u201cSplash her with a wave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cScare her half to death!\u201d Jeongyeon lurched forward.</p><p>But Jimin saw how honest her prayer was, so he said, \u201cGive her what she wants!\u201d</p><p>Ros\u00e9, Kibum, and Jeongyeon looked at him, confused, \u201cGive her what she&hellip;?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cGive her what she wants. Love has many powers. If the love is true, It can cross the earth, and withstand the storm. It can conquer&ndash;\u201d Jimin poked in Jeongyeon\u2019s direction. \u201cEven you.\u201d</p><p>The gods of earth and water decided to walk away and give the two their space to talk, mostly because neither of them wanted to be put at odds with Death herself.</p><p>She scoffed, \u201cLove conquer death? Why, I could stop her heart like that!\u201d She snapped her fingers with a quickness.</p><p>Jimin smirked, \u201cStop her heart from beating, yes. But not from loving. Not if love is what she chooses.\u201d</p><p>Jeongyeon shook her head dismissively, \u201cRidiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting!\u201d Key piped up.</p><p>Ros\u00e9 nodded, \u201cMore amusing than mangos!\u201d</p><p>They came to a decision, \u201cA journey!\u201d</p><p>Jimin reached out to (Y/N), \u201cI will give her strength when the time is right.\u201d</p><p>Mother nature followed suit, \u201cI will guide her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will make her choose!\u201d A wicked grin spread across Death\u2019s face.</p><p>Kibum, already flowing down to Earth, said, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll provide the place where two different worlds will meet tonight!\u201d</p><p>Tonight!<br/><br/>God of water Kibum smeared his arm across the sky, \u201cLet there be no moon. Let the clouds race by. Where the road meets the sea, let the tide be high.\u201d And his head turned as he saw the girl about to return home. \u201cLet there be a girl\u2026\u201d He drew her back to the beach. \u201cWalking by the sea, and let there be rain!\u201d</p><p>A small trickle began as Key continued to command his part of nature, \u201cListen to her prayers, full of hope and pain as she stares down the road in the pouring rain.\u201d It quickly picked up.</p><p>She should\u2019ve been home by now or trying to get there more quickly, but instead she stood transfixed in the middle of the empty road. There was rain on the road. Rain on her face. Rain makes a road such a dangerous place.</p><p>He smiled to himself as the other player came near, \u201cLet there be a car racing through the night where the road meets the sea. Let her wait where the road meets the sea. Let him spin where the road meets the sea. Let their fate begin~ in the&hellip;Raaaaaiiiinnnin!\u201d He bellowed and thunder clapped.</p><p>Kibum was gone as soon as he came, leaving an unsupervised driver swerve when he saw big brown eyes and a red dress in the middle of the street. He quickly ran into a tree which Ros\u00e9 made sure was unharmed in all of this.</p><hr><p>I heard the screech of wheels and metal bending. Saw lights brighter than the moon and then nothing. I went to him and screamed at the top of my lungs.</p><p>\u201cHelp! Someone! Come quickly! A car has crashed!\u201d I held him in my arms. \u201cA boy is hurt! Help me, someone! Where is everyone?\u201d</p><p>Not a soul was coming near. It was if we weren\u2019t on the sandy beach at all, but somewhere else where only the two of us existed.</p><p>\u201cHello? Can you hear me?\u201d I asked.</p><p><i>His skin is so pale</i>, I think.</p><p>\u201cCan you see me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened for a moment. They were eyes from another world. Gray as the sky.</p><p>I spoke to whoever heard, \u201cOh, gods. Oh, gods, you saved my life for a reason. And now, I think I know why!\u201d</p><p>A man\u2019s voice made me jump, \u201cHe roared down the road like the devil himself\u2026\u201d</p><p>More people started to gather.</p><p>\u201cGoing too fast around the curves!\u201d A thick woman added.</p><p>\u201cSent us scrambling off the road like chickens\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has what he deserves!\u201d</p><p>No, what? He didn\u2019t deserve this! He was too kind.</p><p>A beautiful woman squaked, \u201cJeongyeon wants him\u2026\u201d</p><p>The man she was with finished, \u201cAnd Jeongyeon will have him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy is dying before our eyes!\u201d one of the men before spoke up again.</p><p>\u201cHelp him!\u201d Mom said.</p><p>\u201cHide him!\u201d One of her friends said right after.</p><p>Appa interrupted, \u201cNoooo! Don\u2019t touch him! Better leave him where he lies. Even a wealthy man sometimes dies.\u201d</p><p>How could he? I spoke up, \u201cPlease! He needs help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this boy dies in our hands, the rich will send police.\u201d He stated.</p><p>\u201cHe needs care!\u201d</p><p>Eomma agreed, \u201cAnd if he lives, oh, how angry the gods will be!\u201d</p><p>Everyone around me seemed to have the same idea, \u201cThe only thing that will save the boy\u2019s life is to send him back to his world!\u201d</p><p>I knew I was being stubborn, but I had to be, \u201cThe only thing that will save the boy\u2019s life&hellip; is me!\u201d</p><p>All the villagers stared in disbelief, finally silent and still even as rain covered us head to toe.</p><p>So I continued, \u201cI have prayed to the gods and at last they\u2019ve answered. They saved my life so that I could save his. My heart knows this.\u201d My eyes looked at my father. \u201cPlease, Appa.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cI will find where he comes from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShindong! No!\u201d Eomma Taeyeon held his arm tightly.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI will find who he is, and soon! But \u2019til I return, you care for him, (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>And, after he bid his wife and daughter goodbye, Shindong set off down the road, toward the Black Mountains. The peasants carried the boy to the village, and laid him on my mat. And so my long vigil began\u2026</p><p>One day gone by like it was nothing, just making sure he was dried off as much as possible with rain pelting the windows. And two days gone by without him opening his eyes at all. People would stop by just to whisper about the whole situation.</p><p>They would say things such as, \u201cThe boy has the will of the devil himself, clinging to life by one small thread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Julian\u2019s daughter, he\u2019d certainly be dead!\u201d</p><p>Even when I was just doing the most simple of things to make sure he was being taken care of properly, they\u2019d whisper and gossip as if they weren\u2019t standing outside of my hut. As if I couldn\u2019t hear them. I did, but I was too focused on trying to save this boy\u2019s life to care about any of it.</p><p>It was two women chirping back and forth, \u201cLook how she bathes him&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd touches and protects him.\u201d</p><p>Two men were by their sides, \u201cShe binds his wounds and she rubs his chest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if the girl\u2019s possessed!\u201d</p><p>My mother worried for me as I looked through every book and was alarmed by every cough, \u201cYou need food. You need sleep. You just can\u2019t go on without any sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEomma, sssh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave some tea.\u201d She offered.</p><p>I felt his arm, \u201cHis skin is hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a rest.\u201d She had even set out another mat for me in the corner.</p><p>\u201cHe needs me here.\u201d</p><p>I was tired of her trying to convince me away from him, so I went to yell at her but we ended up talking over each other, \u201cCan\u2019t you see how much this matters to me? I know what\u2019s best!\u201d</p><p>Eomma was shocked at my words, but that didn\u2019t stop her from sticking around me as I tried a new healing techniques. Now the sky was growing dim and the clouds are racing by. The gods are looking down at a boy they meant to die and a girl who placed herself in their way\u2026 So they prayed.</p><p>Three days gone by and my stomach was still empty other than what slithered down when I chewed up herbs and leaves and turned them into a fine paste. And four days gone by without one wink of sleep. I don\u2019t know if I even blinked when keeping my eye on him.</p><p>Two brothers and their sister came to watch me work today.</p><p>The oldest spoke first, \u201cI fear for the girl and her mother, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing but trouble looms ahead.\u201d Their sister agreed.</p><p>\u201cMister Shindong could be deep in danger.\u201d The youngest spoke.</p><p>Their sister spoke again, \u201cArrested, lost or dead!\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>In the forest on the edge of the mountains, Shindong held a lit lamp and looked around with worry in his heart. He paused for a second and got on his knees.</p><p>\u201cRos\u00e9, mother of the earth, guide the feet of this poor peasant man. Hear my prayer. Which way there&hellip;and which way home?\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>I called to my mom, \u201cI need herbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father gone&ndash;\u201d She replied.</p><p>\u201cEomma, herbs!\u201d I didn\u2019t have time for her nagging.</p><p>My mother was upset, \u201cAnd you don\u2019t care. Oh, my god what has this boy done to you?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her hands, \u201cMam&hellip;sssh!\u201d and went back to the boy. \u201cHe needs rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour appa lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs care\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pointed in my direction, \u201cBecause of <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>We spoke over each other once more, \u201cCan\u2019t you see that he\u2019s in terrible danger? What must I do?\u201d</p><p>Now the sky is turning dark, and the wind is turning chill. The gods are out for blood. They\u2019ve been cheated of their kill by a girl without the sense to obey&hellip;so they prayed. They moved their feet together in order to ward off evil because once it got in it probably wouldn\u2019t leave with just a single casualty.</p><p>Everytime death came near, I\u2019d use water and flame. Herbs and prayer to keep him alive. I didn\u2019t even know his name, but I went without sleeping for many days to have the hope of knowing it from his own lips.<br/><br/>\u201cYeobo! Where is my yeobo! Bring my Shindong home!\u201d Taeyeon wailed.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>At that same time, Shindong had made it to the gates but was confronted by the gatekeepers. He begged for entry.</p><p>\u201cYou want what?\u201d The keeper scoffed.</p><p>The chubby man replied, \u201cI\u2019ve come so far and I need&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some news for Kim-nim&ndash;\u201d</p><p>The guard warned again, \u201c<i>Get back!</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cMin Seonsaeng-nim has a&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeasant pig!\u201d He slapped the man for his insolence.</p><p>Now on the ground, Appa Shindong said, \u201cPlease, I beg!\u201d</p><p>The guard was surprised, \u201cYou must be mad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must see Seonsaeng-nim&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cMin Seonsaeng-nim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have come so far&ndash;\u201d He tried to get up but was stopped by the barrel of a gun.</p><p>\u201cSo far to die!\u201d</p><p>His eyes caught a missing poster with the image of the boy from the crash and pointed desperately, \u201cI have found his son!\u201d</p><p>That caught their attention and so the guard helped him up, a bit suspicious but he wasn\u2019t the one with a life to lose if this man was lying.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Now the sky has turned to black and the wind is like a knife. Jeongyeon is coming back for the boy who clings to life and the girl will have the gods to repay\u2026</p><p>They prayed with their whole bodies, \u201cJeongyeon, don\u2019t come around me! Jeongyeon, don\u2019t come around me! Jeongyeon, don\u2019t come around me! Jeongyeon, don\u2019t come around me!\u201d</p><p>Some say it was the worst storm the Gods had ever sent. Peasants prayed that they\u2019d live to see the morning, but what of (Y/N)? </p><p>What of me? Well, some say I had gone without sleep for so long that my mind wandered further into my dreams. I had no wind nor rain, only my beating heart of this pale dying boy.</p><p>I even sang to him as comfort, \u201cSure as a wave needs to be near the shore. You are the one I was intended for. Deep in your eyes, I saw the gods\u2019 design. Now my life is forever yours.\u201d I smiled. \u201cAnd you are mine.\u201d</p><p>I changed his bandages and sang, \u201cI am a tree holding away the storm. Here in my arms, I\u2019ll keep you safe and warm. Even the gods won\u2019t dare to cross this line where my life is forever yours, and you are mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are mine,\u201d came his voice from the doorway.</p><p>I knew he\u2019d be ok because of me!</p><p>Our hearts sang together, \u201cMine\u2026We\u2019ll race away in a car as silver as the moon, and the storm will turn to sun on an island where the earth and sea are one. Sure as this night leads to a sky of blue. Sure as my heart led me to be with you.\u201d He leaned his forehead on my own. \u201cSurely the gods meant this to be a sign that my life is forever yours and you are&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiiiiiine! MIIIINNEE!\u201d It was, Jeongyeon. There was no mistaking it.</p><p>Where was my boy?</p><p>She stood above him and grinned the darkest grin I had ever seen, \u201cArrogant fool. Think you can hold back death?\u201d</p><p>Death herself came before me, but I wouldn\u2019t let her ruin this, \u201cStay away!\u201d I was shaking but stood firm.</p><p>Jeongyeon shoved me back without even touching me, \u201cThis boy is mine. I am his dying breath!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you have him!\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cSure as the grave, you must accept what is! Now his life is forever mine~\u201d</p><p>It was if death was pulling his soul from out of his body. It raised with her motion. I had to do something! Something now!</p><p>\u201cTake mine for his!\u201d I blurted.</p><p>She looked at me with shock, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>With more conviction, I repeated, \u201cTake my life. My soul&hellip; for his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the road leading to no return.\u201d Jeongyeon warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d I glared at her.</p><p>She returned it tenfold, \u201cSecret of life nobody wants to learn\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would die for him!\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>\u201cI am the car racing toward distant shores.\u201d</p><p>My eyes were on him, not death, \u201cNow his life is forever mine\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jeongyeon pulled my attention back and pulled my soul into her grasp as well, \u201cYour life is forever mine\u2026\u201d</p><p>It was excruciatingly painful, but as soon as it was over, I looked back at the boy whose life I was saving, \u201cAnd I am yours\u2026\u201d</p><p>Our fates were sealed. Death left humming to herself followed by a laugh like the cracking of bones.</p><hr><p>The next day I realized I had finally gone to sleep after staying up to protect my boy. I don\u2019t know how long but I awoke to pale muscles holding me as they took him away! They gave me to my worried parents as they took him to a truck and laid him in the back still on top of my mat!<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, stop!\u201d I called. \u201cYou can\u2019t take him! Give him back!\u201d My arms flailed and failed to reach his still unconscious form.</p><p>He was getting better! The Gods&ndash;why was he taken from me?</p><p>My father\u2019s grip was firm, \u201cNow the Gods are happy! He is there in his world and you are here in ours! Everything is as it should be (Y/N)!\u201d he looked me dead in the eyes. \u201cThere can never be anything between a peasant and a Sacred Bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppa, he needs me!\u201d My gaze held strong. \u201cWithout me&hellip;he\u2019ll die!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet the Gods decide his fate!\u201d My mother said. \u201cWhat can a peasant like you do for someone like him but shine his shoes?!\u201d</p><p>I went to her and held her hands, \u201cHis ancestors one loved a peasant girl.\u201d</p><p>I had heard the villagers gossiping about his heritage all while I did my best to heal him. His family cursed to stay on this island while their hearts forever yearned for their homeland.</p><p>\u201cThis time a Sacred Bone will marry one. I know it!\u201d I made eye contact with both my parents. The ones who raised me. \u201cI am in his blood and he is in mine.\u201d</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon\u2019s face fell, crumbled, \u201cMarry you?\u201d She held my face in her hands. \u201cYou are mad. He will not marry you, (Y/N)!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must go to him.\u201d I said, not a shred of doubt in my heart. </p><p>I took Eomma\u2019s hands from my face and backed away from her. How could they not believe me? It wasn\u2019t as if it were some random thing! It was my hearts! It was the Gods! I loved him and we were meant to be together!</p><p>\u201cI must go to him! His heart beats for me like a drum. The gods are dancing for me, Eomma!\u201d I said. \u201cPlease, Eomma. Please, Appa.\u201d I begged them with my whole heart. \u201cGive me your blessing and let me go.\u201d</p><p>They said nothing with their mouths, but spoke to one another with their eyes. I knew my answer! Why didn\u2019t they know theirs?</p><p>Stubborn words came out of my mouth, \u201c I will go!\u201d</p><p>My mom sighed and tucked her hair behind her ear, \u201cWhat can I say to stop you now now that you\u2019ve heard your drums and seen your dancers? Now that you think your heart has all the answers?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were filled with sorrow as she looked at me, \u201cWho knows how high those mountains climb? Who knows how deep those rivers flow? Who knows how wrong a dream can go, (Y/N)?\u201d</p><p>Appa Shindong gently touched my arm, \u201cI won\u2019t be there to guide your way\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo braid your hair or dry your tears\u2026\u201d Eomma added. \u201cAs we have done these many years, (Y/N). (Y/N)\u2026\u201d</p><p>My father had me sit, \u201cWhat you are, we made you. What we gave, you took. Now you run without one backward look.\u201d</p><p>Mother smoothed my hair, \u201cYou\u2019ll find some other boy to save. Some other life that you can share. Your heart is young; new dreams are everywhere. Choose your dreams with care, (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I <i>have </i>chosen. And my dreams are there, down <i>that </i>road!\u201d I stood and pointed out the window.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a child, (Y/N)!\u201d Appa bellowed. \u201cThe road is hard and dangerous. The city is miles away. And even if you get there, even if you get to the Hotel Holly, you will never get through the gate!\u201d</p><p>His voice was anger and confusion and heavy with pleading. Why was he so worried? </p><p>\u201cI will get there, Appa. I will get through the gate. I\u2019m not a child any longer!\u201d I knew their words but felt so different about them. \u201cWhat I am, you made me. What you gave, I owe. But if I look back, I\u2019ll never go. Who knows how high those mountains climb?\u201d</p><p>I gazed out the window, \u201cWho knows how deep those rivers flow?\u201d and then turned my attention back to them. \u201cI know he\u2019s there. That\u2019s all I need to know\u2026\u201d</p><p>As they always did when things were rough, they hid their tears even though their aged faces showed everything they were feeling. I couldn\u2019t just give up, though. He was my fate! Us being together was destiny. I didn\u2019t argue with it, so why&ndash;</p><p>\u201cGo and find your love.\u201d Appa Shindong said.</p><p>Eomma nodded and placed her necklace around my neck, \u201cGo and swim the sea.\u201d</p><p>Together, they assured me, \u201cYou know where we\u2019ll be\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways there with me\u2026\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026\u201d they hugged me tightly.</p><p>So I set off into the world with everything looking so bright and new! It was scary&hellip;just a little bit. Ok, maybe a lot of bit. I had nowhere&hellip;no idea where I was going. But on this island, the earth sings as soon as the storm ends. And as my feet set out, I realized I was walking with old friends.</p><p>The birds&hellip;The trees&hellip;The frogs&hellip;And the breezes\u2026 That\u2019s when I lost all my fear. I knew Ros\u00e9 was near! She appeared out of nowhere and had a huge smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been away from the sea, child. You\u2019re gonna need a helping hand. A fish has got to learn to swim on land!\u201d She motioned me towards her. \u201cWalk with me, little girl. Don\u2019t you be afraid. Follow me, little girl, let me be your guide. A pretty thing like you will need a thing or two\u201d</p><p>She booped my nose and I giggled.</p><p>\u201cAnd whatever you need. Mama will provide. Ohhhhh! Down the road, little girl, you may lose your way. All alone in a world that may seem too wide.\u201d</p><p>The red haired goddess sat on an upturned boat and tapped her skirt to motion for me to place myself there, \u201cBut sit on mama\u2019s lap, and I will draw a map, and whatever you need Mama will provide!\u201d</p><p>She sat up and twirled me in all sorts of ways. It was as if the earth itself was speaking to me and bending to her will.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll provide you moss to soften the road! Rocks to sit on! Trees to sleep underneath! Sand, fun for your toes! Plantain to fill up your belly!\u201d And the wind danced through my hair as she sang to me. \u201cBreeze to fan your face! Grass for making your bed!\u201d</p><p>I pointed at a blood sucking little fella that kept buzzing around me, \u201cMosquitoes?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cHa!\u201d</p><p>I tried to clap it between my hands, but it must\u2019ve flown away as my hands were free of any squashed bug bits.</p><p>\u201cBugs will bite, little girl and the night will fall. All alone in the dark, you\u2019ll be terrified. But you will make it through \u2018cause I am liking you!\u201d She spun me around once more. \u201cAnd whatever you need Mama will provide!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama will provide\u2026Mama will provide\u2026Mama will provide\u2026\u201d The forest sang as my footsteps became more sure.</p><p>Ros\u00e9 belted into my ear, \u201cOh\u2026!\u201d and giggled at my startled reaction. \u201cWalk with me, little girl and I\u2019ll take you far! \u2018Round each bend, little friend, I\u2019ll be by your side. That\u2019s what Mama\u2019s worth, to give her child the earth, and whatever you need, mama will\u2026\u201d She took a deep breath as the plants twirled and prepared themselves for another belting moment. \u201cPROVIIIIIIIIIDDEEE!\u201d</p><p>I embraced her and with a wave of Ros\u00e9\u2019s fan, a clear path came before me. She motioned me on and off I went.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Some say&hellip;How you began your long journey toward the city! Some say your feet were bare and the road was long and cruel Some say you got a ride from a vendor and his mule. Some say the gods pulled up in a car and drove you all the way. Well, no one knows how the real truth goes, but that\u2019s what some say!</p><p>Some might wonder how far did she travel. The answer is as far as they suppose. And how long did it take you? Much longer than their nose! And were you ever frightened or was your love too strong? And did you know she\u2019d end up in a story and a song?</p><p>What happened when (Y/N) finally reached the city? Some say they laughed at you for your peasant feet were bare. Some say that vendor man gave you shoes too small to wear. Some say&hellip;the gods said, \u201cPut on the shoes! It\u2019s the price you have to pay!\u201d</p><p>The shoes were tight, but you said, \u201cAlright!\u201d</p><p>Well, that&rsquo;s what some say! Some say that at last (still wearing her painful new city shoes) you arrived at the gates of the Hotel Holly. But the fierce guard saw you had nothing to sell to the tourists.</p><p>\u201cSTOP!\u201d They yelled.</p><p>But you must have smiled your most beautiful smile. And Jimin must have touched the fierce guard on the shoulder, for he nodded and some say the gate swung open and you entered and went in search of your Yoongi. Some say you scrubbed the floors \u2018til you learned where he was kept. Some say you climbed a vine to the window where he slept. While some say the gods just lifted you up and placed you where he lay.</p><p>Well, no one knows how the real truth goes. It all depends what you hear from friends. It\u2019s no surprise, if it\u2019s all just lies, but that\u2019s what some say&hellip;<br/></p><hr><p>I waited until I saw him struggle to get into his bed with his crutches that I came to help him. His eyes opened wide as he put his hand up to stop me and he backed up, frightened.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in here? It isn\u2019t allowed!\u201d</p><p>I spoke up, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember me? It\u2019s (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out before I call a guard.\u201d He hissed.</p><p>My body moved on its own, closer to him, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me? I saved your life.\u201d</p><p>He scuffed, \u201c<i>You </i>saved my life? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Did he really not recall? But the Gods\u2026</p><p>I stood back at the foot of his bed, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi answered with a quick, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me as I swayed nervously. I had come all this way to be with him. I pressed on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who found you crushed inside your car.\u201d My words were gentle but firm. \u201cI watched over you when you nearly died. I bathed you and gave you my mat to lie on.\u201d It was nowhere to be found.</p><p>My dark brown hands smoothed his expensive white bed sheets as they recalled how they cared for his unconscious body for days on end. Still no recollection was to be found behind his coconut colored eyes illuminated by the bedside lamp.</p><p>So I approached him, \u201cI have seen the scar on your chest. It\u2019s like a half moon.\u201d I cupped my hand to match its shape and placed it near his heart where I knew the scar was. \u201cHere~\u201d</p><p>Yoongi blinked, a pout on his lips but finally a memory breaking through, \u201cSo, it was you?\u201d</p><p>I smiled and felt his head though he flinched at my touch, \u201cYes! You\u2019re very ill. You burn like fire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy leg won\u2019t heal.\u201d He motioned to his bandaged calf.</p><p>\u201cThe Gods sent me to make you well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think your peasant superstitions can do what doctors can\u2019t?\u201d He squinted his eyes. \u201cYou, little girl?\u201d</p><p>I took on a semi-scolding tone, \u201cI kept you alive in the face of death! Anyone in my village would tell you so, and I can heal you. Now.\u201d</p><p>Was he really going to keep doubting someone sent by the Gods after defying one of them? His future wife?</p><p>\u201cYou should go home.\u201d Yoongi said.</p><p>I knelt at the side of his bed, our hands only inches apart.</p><p>\u201cBut I came all the way to be with you! Let me stay.\u201d</p><p>He stuck out his chin, \u201cOh? So you can tell me more stories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am telling the truth.\u201d I said simply.</p><p>The black haired man scoffed, \u201cA pretty thing&ndash;what&ndash;sent by the \u2018gods\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I looked into his eyes, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Min Yoongi just stared at me, slightly taken aback by how serious I was. How could I not be serious when he doubted my very reality so? My people\u2019s song came in on the wind. He seemed to have recalled something else. A puzzled look came across his face.</p><p>Another glance at me, \u201cAlright then&hellip;What harm can it do?\u201d He did a sloppy hand flourish towards his leg. \u201cHow me your powers. I\u2019ll pretend to believe them.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me as I sat now on the edge of his bed smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cPerhaps maybe the Gods did send me a gift after all.\u201d</p><p>So I began to work on his ailing parts. I felt a presence but it didn\u2019t interrupt, simply watched as I took care of my soulmate.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Jimin watched from the window, making sure he was known just enough but did not interfere. He wanted to help&hellip;move things along since you had worked so hard to get here. His song was like a spell nudging your hearts closer together.</p><p>\u201cOoh, ooh. The courage of a dreamer&hellip;The innocence of youth&hellip;The failures and the foolishness&hellip;That lead us to the truth.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he noticed how happy you were just to be near Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cThe hopes that make us happy. The hopes that don\u2019t come true. And all the love there ever was: I see this all in you.\u201d Because he believed that \u201cYou are part~Part of the human heart.\u201d</p><p>Yes, the way you looked at him and took care of him. There was no doubt in Jimin\u2019s mind that you were part of the human heart. You were part of all who took the journey.</p><p>\u201cAnd managed to endure. The ones who knew such tenderness. The ones who felt so sure. The ones who came before you. The others yet to come, and those who you will teach it to.\u201d His gaze reached to comfort Eomma Taeyeon and Appa Shindong. \u201cAnd those you learned it from.\u201d</p><p>The blonde beauty recognized the change in Yoongi\u2019s eyes as he saw how you worked and got him to hold your hand to bring you closer to him. He continued to work his magic and almost giggled at how shocked you were.</p><p>\u201cYou are part~Part of the human heart. You are part&hellip;This is the gift I give through your love you\u2019ll live forever&hellip;Forever~ Forever.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi caressed your hair all the way down your cheek and to your chin. You couldn\u2019t help but stare at his chin. Jimin made sure your love\u2019s hand was firmly around your waist.</p><p>\u201cYou are part&hellip;Tonight~Tonight~Part of the human heart~~~~\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>And he kissed me. I kissed him back of course. My heart was pounding inside my chest. I knew that he\u2019d love me once he knew the truth, once he accepted it. I could hear the wedding bells already.</p><p>And the night became day. Still Yoongi kept the gentle (Y/N) beside him! The day became a week and still you slept in his room. After two weeks, the gossip began spreading through the walls of the Hotel Holly&ndash;even into the city&ndash;until everyone had heard that the ailing Min Yoongi had chosen a peasant as a lover. And little~by little~ you were \u201chealing him\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNow, what can he want with a woman like her?\u201d A man asked as he walked with a friend and two women.</p><p>\u201cBlacker than coal and low as dirt!\u201d The woman on his arm added.</p><p>Her friend agreed, \u201cHe could have the world but takes a peasant!\u201d</p><p>The other man smacked his own head, \u201cPerhaps his brain was hurt!\u201d</p><p>Even the servants whispered, \u201cLook how she holds him and touches and attends him. The boy believes she can make him well&hellip;and she has him in a spell.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi had been laying with his head on my lap while I caressed his pale face. I tapped his shoulder so that he would stand. I did as well, fiddling with the locket Eomma had given me when I left the village.</p><p>\u201cI have a gift for you.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi grinned, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d tucking his shirt into his pants.</p><p>\u201cA charm.\u201d I kneeled on his bed and took it off. \u201cIf you wear it next to your heart, it will make you whole again.\u201d</p><p>I clasped it around his neck and let my arms rest on his shoulders. He beamed at me with sunlight and affection in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou are my charm.\u201d My love kissed my cheek. \u201cWithout you, I could never be whole again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never leave you, Yoongi.\u201d</p><p>Two women, overdressed for any occasion, commented on the relationship as well.</p><p>The one in green asked, \u201cNow, what do you make of a peasant like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPutting on airs without a doubt!\u201d Her friend in a lighter green replied.</p><p>A man passing by inserted himself in the conversation, \u201cWhen the boy is well and does not need her\u2014\u201d</p><p>The two women joined him in completing his thought, \u201c\u2014How soon he\u2019ll throw her out!\u201d</p><p>Lifting his crutch off the ground, Yoongi spun in a circle, \u201cSoon, I\u2019ll be dancing again!\u201d</p><p>I smiled and caught him before he fell and waited for his crutch to touch the floor once more, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll dance with you! But for now, walk slowly, Yoongi.\u201d</p><p>A spark came alive in his eyes, \u201cThen you must walk even more slowly~\u201d</p><p>With a giggle, I asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can <i>catch </i>you!\u201d He began to playfully chase me with a slight limp ang giggling, so I ran just fast enough to stay out of his grasp.</p><p>His father called out to him, \u201cYoongi-ah!\u201d a paduk board in his grasp.</p><p>He stopped in his tracks, \u201cAbeoji.\u201d</p><p>His cold eyes glared at me, so I made my way back to my love\u2019s room. Part of me was afraid Min Appa would hit me across the head with that board. The other guests turned their heads whenever I met their eyes. Nothing mattered as long as Yoongi love me, which he did.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think you\u2019ll be playing this game?\u201d The older man asked.</p><p>His son shook his head, \u201cThis is no game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you can\u2019t believe it\u2019s real?\u201d He scoffed.</p><p>Yoongi nodded, \u201cI\u2019m in love with (Y/N)!\u201d</p><p>Min Abeoji replied sternly, \u201cYou are not the first to want a peasant. I, too, know their appeal&hellip;But you are my son. You\u2019ll do what must be done <i>no matter what you feel</i>!\u201d</p><p>He left his son with sadness in his heart. Yoongi began to go in the direction his love had gone while the guests snickered behind his back. The trio from earlier had seen everything but pretended like they had not by hiding behind fans and newspapers.</p><p>\u201cI know what he sees in a peasant like her\u2026\u201d The man said coming from behind his paper.</p><p>\u201cProbably makes him rise like yeast!\u201d the light green clothed woman commented.</p><p>Servants continued to gossip, \u201cWell, the girl may think she\u2019s very clever. The boy may keep her here forever.\u201d</p><p>However, sacred bone and servants alike agreed, \u201cBut I can tell you this: They\u2019ll never stand before a priest!\u201d</p><p>As Yoongi finished getting ready, I explained how our lives would be once we were a happily married couple. Every day with him would be happy because we were in love. We were together just as the Gods had willed. Just like we would be until we died.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;and we\u2019ll have a little house with pink walls and a blue roof. And a tree in a garden just like the one that used to shelter me as a child. Then you and I can lie under the shade of the tree~\u201d I sprawled across the fine bedclothes.</p><p>My love Yoongi moved to sit, so I rolled on my side.</p><p>\u201cAnd then our children will climb it.\u201d</p><p>He stood with a start and looked at me. Maybe he hadn\u2019t thought that far, but it would happen. We\u2019d have children. I\u2019d bear as many as he wanted.</p><p>\u201cAnd it will be ours, forever.\u201d I looked at him with wide and innocent eyes.</p><p>He gave me a sweet smirk and moved to a mirror to tie his cream colored bowtie. Yoongi began to talk about how he loved me. I folded my legs and kicked them out to lie on the bed once more.</p><p>=================<br/></p><p>I, Min Yoongi, son of a well known sacred bone, making me a sacred bone as well, continued to get ready for tonight\u2019s ball, \u201cSome girls take hours to paint every perfect nail&hellip;Fragrant as flowers all powdered and prim and pale; but you are as wild as that wind-blown tree. As dark and as deep as the midnight sea. While they\u2019re busy dressing, you lie here warm and bold~\u201d</p><p>This girl who had shown up out of nowhere claiming to have healed my body </p><p>I said as I finished doing his tie and moving on to fixing my color and suspenders. \u201cSome girls you picture. Some you hold.\u201d</p><p>You looked at me him still in awe, innocence in your loving gaze. I thought about what my father said and continued, \u201cSome girls take courses at all the best schools in France; riding their horses and learning their modern dance. They\u2019re clever and cultured and worldly-wise, but you see the world through a child\u2019s wide eyes.\u201d</p><p>I used hair wax to make my black strands stay in place. \u201cWhile their dreams are grand ones. You want what\u2019s just in reach.\u201d Jamie wanted so much. Everything material, expensive, wanted what her parents raised her to want.</p><p>My smile couldn\u2019t be contained as I wiped my hands on a towel, \u201cSome girls you learn from. Some you teach. You are not small talk or shiny cars or mirrors or French cologne.\u201d I sprayed a bit on myself since it had become routine for me, and you didn\u2019t seem to hate it.</p><p>\u201cYou are the river, the moon, the stars: You\u2019re no one else I\u2019ve known\u2026\u201d</p><p>You tilted your head to get me to tell you more.</p><p>I replied, \u201cSome girls take pleasure in buying a fine trousseau. Counting each treasure and tying each tiny bow. They fold up their futures with perfumed hands while you face the future with no demands. Some girls expect things others think nothing of.\u201d</p><p>Then I turned to look at the door knowing my fiancee was just down the hall, \u201cSome girls you marry.\u201d Because there was no other choice. My eyes met yours, \u201cSome you love~\u201d</p><p>I loved you. Ever since you came into my room telling stories that I still wasn\u2019t sure were true, but I didn\u2019t care because my heart wanted you. (Y/N) was my happiness. You could never betray me for riches because you didn\u2019t want anything but me.</p><hr><p>Beautiful light music filled the grand hall as Yoongi greeted guests who congratulated him on his upcoming wedding with Jamie but whispered about him once he was gone. Large crystal chandeliers lit up the dance floor and the candlelit tables were attended by servants in the hotel uniforms. Flower petals cascaded from the ceiling and onto the floor. Laughter echoed off the walls.<br/></p><p>The Sacred Bones at the Hotel Holly, dancing to their own little tune. Waiting to see&hellip; (Y/N)!</p><p>Jamie in her golden dress approached her husband to be who was probably on the lookout for his mistress. Jamie had not the&hellip;pleasure of seeing her. Yoongi spent all his hours with her other than the times she was sleeping and he had to to talk to her about their upcoming wedding.</p><p>\u201cSome girls are saying she\u2019s simple as any child.\u201d She said with her arms folded.</p><p>He sighed, \u201cPlease, Jamie\u2026\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop talking about the rumors, \u201cBarefoot and praying and running the halls quite wild!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is she as pretty as we\u2019ve all heard? Your own pretty&hellip;Well, what\u2019s the word?\u201d</p><p>They noticed all the heads turning to see a girl with a red hibiscus flower crown and an extravagant red dress to match. It was me. I approached Yoongi eagerly and relieved to see him looking at me, completely smitten with me.</p><p>\u201cYoongi~!\u201d I slowed when I saw him beside another woman.</p><p>\u201cSo this is your (Y/N). How beautiful she is.\u201d She looked at me.</p><p>My love introduced us, \u201c(Y/N), this is Gongju-nim Jamie. Jamie, this is (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>A woman I did not know bowed to me, \u201cI\u2019m so happy to meet you, my dear lady. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re a healer and a dancer, as well. Won\u2019t you dance for us now? Won\u2019t you give us a show?<br/>Please, dear girl&hellip;Don\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Yoongi who held my hands, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, (Y/N). Dance as you always do\u2026 Just for me.\u201d</p><p>I stood in the center of the room and began the dance I had known since I was a child. My feet nearly came from under me since I was not accustomed to dancing with shoes on my feet. So I took them off, but the familiar looking servants refused to take them from me. Hiding their faces and moving away. Then a man approached and took the bejeweled slippers from me.</p><p>Then I returned to my spot and felt the eyes on my. Looking around, it seemed as though I held the attention of the whole room.</p><p>In a tune that felt like home, one of the serving woman sang, \u201cWe dance~\u201d</p><p>As if by magic, the song came into my heart, \u201cWe dance~\u201d</p><p>WE DANCE!</p><p>My feet began to move to the music played by dark faces. I had danced as I always did to a song that I hadn\u2019t heard in what felt like years. My skirt fanned out around me with every spin, and I noticed the pale pink of a hotel maid twirling next to mine. She must\u2019ve gotten permission from her bosses. Eventually emerald green flew in rhythm with the legs of tailored suits.</p><p>The island blood could be hidden with powders and creams but it pulsed nonetheless. Guests clapped and cheered along to the tune as our reet moved to the rapid drums. Even my Yoongi joined in for the last bit. I really had taught him well. All the air in my lungs had gone through my feet, so I was panting hard once the song ended. My love held my hands for a moment before I went to retrieve my shoes but was stopped by an important looking man.</p><p>=================</p><p>Jamie was upset as she pulled Yoongi to the side. Everyone was back in their places. Their roles&hellip;except (Y/N) and Jamie\u2019s husband to be who had let this go on long enough.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s very clear. She\u2019s in love with you. Yoongi, if you care, if you care at all, you must tell her.\u201d</p><p>You came back to your Min Yoongi with a large dazzling smile on your face, \u201cYoongi! Oh, the Ambassador said I was beautiful!!\u201d</p><p>=================</p><p>I was giddy and joyful after dancing in front of so many people and getting so many compliments afterwards. I forgot about my shoes and went to tell the man who loved me.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is so happy that I\u2019m here with you!\u201d</p><p>Something was off.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I searched Jamie\u2019s and Yoongi\u2019s faces for an answer.</p><p>She waited for him to speak, but was the one to talk when he didn\u2019t. Jamie held my hands with affectionate concern.</p><p>Jamie, with her dazzling gold crown to match her dress spoke firmly, \u201cMy dear dear girl, I have something to say. Something I fear was left unsaid. Many thanks for all you\u2019ve given Yoongi, but do not be misled. My dear Mademoiselle, you dance so very well. I pray you\u2019ll dance for Yoongi and for me when we are wed\u2026\u201d She let go at my shocked expression. \u201c(Y/N), Yoongi and I\u2026\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and at him. Wed? Her? Jamie was to wed my&hellip;my Yoongi? I felt my heart sink.</p><p>He tried to explain, \u201cJamie and I have been promised to each other since we were children. This is how things are done, (Y/N). It\u2019s expected.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to cry, \u201cYoongi-ah, please\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will always be a place for you here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jamie decided it was best to give us space and left to talk with guests.</p><p>But our dream. \u201cWe&rsquo;ll race away in a car\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t change who I am or where I\u2019m from.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014 As silver as the moon\u2026\u201d</p><p>Yoongi shook his head, \u201cI wish it could be so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will live beside the sea. We\u2019ll have children, a garden, and a tree\u2026\u201d I held him tightly.</p><p>He held me away from him, \u201cI thought you understood. We could never marry.\u201d</p><p>We could&hellip;never? Yoongi took off the necklace I had given him and placed it in my hands. Then he went back to the main room to continue being a part of the party. I was on the balcony, alone with my broken heart.</p><p>I called out to the gods once again with my whole heart, \u201cOh, gods. Oh, gods, Are you there? Are you there&hellip;?\u201d</p><p>All the whispers from before and even after travelling to be with him swarmed in my head. \u201cBlacker than coal and low as dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has that boy done to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what he sees in a woman like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook how she bathes him and touches and protects him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to have the gods to repay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gods to repay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gods to repay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Gods to repay!!\u201d</p><p>The Gods to repay!<br/></p><p>Jeongyeon appeared before me and everything went dead silent. She smirked at my current state of weakness. It\u2019s as if the rattle of a snake was inside of me as Death slithered closer to me.</p><p>\u201cThere were promises made in the darkness; promises made in your sleep; promises the gods demand you keep!\u201d She darted at me but I moved out of the way, \u201cYou gave him love. Love he would soon betray!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave him life. I am the price you\u2019ll pay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure as the grave. You must accept what is&hellip;Now your life is forever mine\u2026\u201d Death held a knife to my throat.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to die! \u201cPlease, DON\u2019T!!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrade yours for his&hellip;\u201d Jeongyeon said, removing the knife from my throat.</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved him. You loved him. And he betrayed you. Why should you die for him now?\u201d \u201cKill him, (Y/N). Kill the love~ you feel for him. Prove that <b><i>death is stronger than love</i></b> and you can have your own life again. Just as if you had never loved at all.\u201d She handed me the blade. </p><p>Death pulled him closer to me, \u201cI am the road leading to no return\u2026\u201d</p><p>A song that I had heard before was sung between her words, but it was so quiet in comparison, <i>\u201cThe courage of a dreamer\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cSecret of life finally his to learn&hellip;\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYou are part\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>I had to choose. I could kill him. Easily. He wasn\u2019t even looking. No one noticed the dagger in my hand as I approached him from behind. Things could go back to normal. I\u2019d return to my own life just as Jeongyeon had promised. Just as if I had never loved at all.</p><p>\u201cI am the car racing toward distant shores\u2026\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d be able to <i>step </i>get rid of the pain <i>step </i>that HE caused! <i>Step</i></p><p><i>\u201cPart of the human heart\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>He was right there. Yoongi hadn\u2019t noticed me yet. I had to do it now.</p><p>\u201cNow his life is forever mine\u2026\u201d</p><p>I raised the knife to sink between his shoulder blades.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>And I dropped it, \u201c<i>I can\u2019t!</i>\u201d</p><p>People gasped and Yoongi turned with wide eyes to see me kneeling on the floor with tears streaming down my face. He stared at the knife. No matter how much he had hurt me by keeping the truth about his marriage a secret\u2026</p><p>\u201cYoongi&hellip;I <i>love </i>you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cYou tried to <i>kill </i>me!\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>And so you were cast out of the Hotel Holly, your dress and chest being thrown into the sandy dirt. The gates slammed shut behind you.</p><p>Your eyes saw a couple on the other side you called out to them, \u201cI am Miss (Y/N). I am the Mistress of Min Yoongi!\u201d</p><p>If that was the only thing you could be to him, then you\u2019d wear the title. As long as you could be near him. The couple ignored you. A man passed by who recognized you.</p><p>He held your hand through the iron bars as you said, \u201cI was the one who danced at the ball!\u201d</p><p>You wore a beautiful (and clean) dress.</p><p>\u201cThe people applauded!<i> All eyes were on me!!!!</i>\u201d</p><p>He ran off at your outburst. Another Sacred Bone came passed.</p><p>\u201cThe Gods sent me! They sent me be with him!\u201d</p><p>And another.</p><p>\u201cYoongi needs me! He loves me!\u201d</p><p>It was his father who scoffed.</p><p>\u201cWithout me, he\u2019ll die!\u201d You spouted old phrases, ones you had used to get here in the first place.</p><p>It was still the truth still! Right? Even though you had healed him. Almost tried to kill him by literally stabbing him in the back.</p><p>\u201cSurely&hellip;surely there has been a terrible mistake.\u201d You said to yourself as the sun started to tint the sky pink. \u201cHe must be wondering where I am.\u201d</p><p>Fruitlessly, you called to the couple you saw before as they were now returning to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cTell him&hellip;tell him I am here. Tell him (Y/N) is waiting for him at the gate!\u201d</p><p>And so you did. For two weeks you did wait at the gate. Not sleeping. Not eating. Only waiting. Only watching as the grounds were made even more beautiful in preparation for the wedding. Even as Yoongi as Jamie were getting married.</p><p>As superstition dictated, they came to the gates of the Hotel to throw coins to the peasants thus assuring that their own fortunes would multiply. He was there with her dressed in white. You tried reaching out and waving to him, but he did not see.</p><p>Until you called his name, throat dry from having no water for a while, \u201cYoongi!\u201d</p><p>His eyes finally met yours as Jamie walked away. Yoongi approached you and held your hands. Through the gate, he gave you coins since you had none. You hadn\u2019t tried to get any. There was forgiveness in his eyes. He still loved you? But you didn\u2019t want coins. You wanted him! Your beautiful love kissed the tops of both your hands.</p><p>\u201cYoongi~?\u201d Jamie called from a distance, not knowing when he left her side.</p><p>He gave you one more look and then went back to his wife. You let the gold coin fall, heart completely broken. You laid on the ground and died. Your mother finding you too late. She had come just to try and pay you a visit.</p><p>Eomma Taeyong held your body and mourned, \u201cOh, (Y/N). Oh, (Y/N). You will always be a part of us. Oh, (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>Your father and the towns people took your body home as your soul rose out of it. Everyone mourned the loss of the girl with big dreams. Who they had raised. Who they had loved and still did to be honest.</p><p>\u201cYou will always be a part of us. Oh, (Y/N)\u2026Oooh\u2026\u201d They hummed as they set you down and buried your body.</p><p>And the gods began to cry tears of compassion for the orphan (Y/N) who proved that love could withstand the storm and cross the earth and survive even in the face of death. Jimin took you by the hand and led you to the sea where Key wrapped you in a wave and laid you to your rest. Jeongyeon was gentle as she carried you to shore, and Ros\u00e9 accepted you and held you to her breast.</p><p>And then, the gods blessed you, and transformed you into\u2026A tree!</p><p>A tree that sprang up and cracked the walls of the Hotel Holly, so that its gates could never close again. A tree that lived forever, sheltering peasants and Sacred Bone alike. A tree that watched over Yoongi for his lifetime&hellip;in which his children played.</p><p>And one day, as Yoongi\u2019s young son sat in the shade of the tree, he noticed a beautiful young peasant girl high in its branches, looking out at the world. And the spirit of (Y/N) touched their hearts and set them free&hellip;to love!</p><p>People sang about your legacy.</p><p>A man with strong arms touched the tree to feel your spirit, \u201cAnd she stands against the lightning and the thunder. And she shelters and protects us from above.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she fills us with the power and the wonder.\u201d Said a Sacred Bone who had come to visit.</p><p>\u201cOf her love\u2026\u201d Yoongi\u2019s son with a bunny smile commented while holding his crush\u2019s hand.</p><p>And this is why we tell the story. Why we tell the story. Why we tell the story.</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon touched the tree, \u201cIf you listen very hard you\u2019ll hear her call us\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo come share with her our laughter and our tears.\u201d Appa Shindong put his arm around her.</p><p>And as mysteries and miracles befall us through the years, we tell the story! We tell the story!</p><p>\u201cLife is why we tell the story!\u201d Ros\u00e9 said.</p><p>\u201cPain is why we tell the story!\u201d Jeongyeon added holding her hand.</p><p>\u201cLove is why we tell the story!\u201d Jimin claimed.</p><p>\u201cGrief is why we tell the story!\u201d Key suggested while messing up Jimin\u2019s hair.</p><p>A villager with a pink tank top agreed, but also said, \u201cHope is why we tell the story!\u201d</p><p>Another with wide hips added, \u201cFaith is why we tell the story!\u201d</p><p>Then everyone looked at the little girl, \u201cYou are whyyyyyy Why we tell the story. Why-y we tell the story~Why we tell the story. Why-y we tell the story!\u201d While dancing a new dance.<br/><br/>Jimin tapped the little girl\u2019s nose, \u201cSo I hope that you will tell this tale tomorrow. It will help your heart remember and relive.\u201d</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon grinned, \u201cIt will help you feel the anger and the sorrow\u2026\u201d and turned the girl towards the tree.</p><p>Where you floated down from the branches, \u201cAnd forgive\u2026\u201d</p><p>You kissed her forehead and pet her head while everyone including you sand, \u201cFor out of what we live and we believe, our lives become the stories that we weave.\u201d</p><p>Everyone got around the girl who began to speak and you returned to your tree, \u201cThere is an island where rivers run deep&hellip; Where the sea sparkling in the sun earns it the name \u2018Jewel of the Antilles\u2019 An island where the poorest of peasants labor&hellip; And the wealthiest of Sacred Bone play.

We daaaaaance! We daaaaaannnnnnce!\u201d</p><p>With everything now settled, eyes settled on the one in the center who spoke:</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Our story begins on the night of a flood. Many huts washed away, many peasants drowned by Kibum\u2019s angry waters.</p><p>I was a child, walking home from the store in my hand me down red dress. The basket I was carrying was heavy enough to make my small body lean back in order to keep the groceries off the ground. Still, a lose grape fell onto the sandy dirt. I set the basket down to chase after it, and a small wave of water brought it back to me. Strange, I thought as I picked up the purple orb, water wasn\u2019t usually this close to the market. There was a lot more and coming right at me!</p><p>I rushed back to the basket, but before I knew it, my body had been swept up by the waves and my foods taken hostage by the misplaced sea. My mother had been in front of me with her own basket, calling my name. Now she screamed it as I was taken way too far away for me to ever here it being called again. Villagers of all sorts hurriedly packed up and grabbed their own children, racing for higher ground. Some sort of safety.</p><p>A panel of roofing came my way, and I grabbed it. When I was knocked off of it, I felt as though an orphan plucked from the flood by Kibum, sheltered in a tree by Ros\u00e9. And little did I know I\u2019d be sent on a journey by the gods. A journey that would test the strength of love against the power of <b>death</b>. On this island of two different worlds!</p><p>The story of (Y/N)!</p><p>I was just one small girl in a tree, torn from her mother. Crying in fright. One small girl tossed by sea and left to face the stormy night. I was one small girl. Holding tight\u2026At last, the storm subsided and the morning sun glowed when two old peasants came cautiously down the road.</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon and Appa Shindong.</p><p>Taeyeon picked up a flower and tucked it in her hair, \u201cRos\u00e9 is smiling again, Shindong.\u201d</p><p>He was being grumpy, \u201cThis morning, she smiles. Last night, she tried to blow our heads off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHahahaha! Ah, Julian, just listen to those birds!\u201d</p><p>Coo coo coo coo coo. Coo coo coo coo coo.</p><p><i>Waah!!!</i> Sounded from up in a tree.<br><br>\u201cWhat kind of bird is that?\u201d Shindong asked.</p><p>His wife pointed to the tree, at me, \u201cLook! There! One small face, two small knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d When I gave no reply, she looked to her husband. \u201cThe girl can\u2019t speak.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the skies, \u201cAnd they\u2019re to blame. Kibum probably meant to kill her!\u201d</p><p>Taeyeon rolled her eyes, \u201cThen she\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible he forgot.\u201d</p><p>She looked around frightened the gods might be listening, \u201cShh! The gods don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they had some reason to spare her life. It\u2019s best that we don\u2019t know what.\u201d</p><p>His wife agreed even though she looked back at the child, \u201cOne small girl\u2026better not.\u201d</p><p>They shook their heads and started to go, but then something magical came over them. That child needed someplace to live.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re too old for children.\u201d He tried to reason to himself.</p><p>She did the same, \u201cAnd we have no room and no food.\u201d</p><p>But I\u2013the quiet girl in the tree\u2013or something else, touched them deep inside. So not knowing quite why, they followed their hearts back to the tree, gently lifted the terrified child down\u2026</p><p>I screamed, \u201cNOOOOO!!!!\u201d</p><p><br>And discovered I could speak after all. Now I had become one small girl in the way.Constantly hungry. They said I was learning too quick! Maybe because I was only about 6 when I learned how to climb to the top of the tallest palm tree without any help.</p><p>\u201cShe makes me smile.\u201d Appa Shindong said when he saw where I was and pointed it out to Eomma.</p><p>\u201cShe scares me sick!\u201d and she went pale at the sight of me so high. She clutched her heart and ordered the coconut gatherers to help me down.</p><p>But I lept right into my mother\u2019s arms from what didn\u2019t seem like a fifteen foot tree at the time. So they scolded and teased and held me. Ad mended the clothes I tore. The hut was crowded, and food was scarce. Yet somehow, their lives held more. They had one small girl to live for.</p><p>Because I had no idea of what my life was like or what my name was before the flood, they named me \u201cDesire\u0301e Dieu-Donne\u0301,\u201d or \u201cGod-Given Desire.\u201d But in their affection, they called me simply (Y/N).</p><p>I recall a time when I was around the age of 8 and my curious nature came into play, so I asked, \u201cWhat does (Y/N) mean, Eomma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means Little Orphan.\u201d She tapped my nose. \u201cYou\u2019re our sweet little orphan. We found you, and now your life is forever in our care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Appa answered, \u201cBecause the gods willed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>My mother shrugged, \u201cPerhaps they saved you for something special.\u201d</p><p>That simple answer made my eyes light up and I jumped up and down, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), if we knew why the gods did the things they do, we would be gods ourselves!\u201d</p><p>I puffed up my cheeks cutely, \u201cSomeday I\u2019m going to ask them, Eomma!\u201d</p><p>Both my parents giggled, and she ruffled my hair, \u201cFoolish girl! Run and hide!\u201d</p><p>Growing up, I was called both sweet as a eucalyptus and terrible as a tempest while I was banging a drum and humming a tune. I was (Y/N) and did what children did. Falling and running and calling and growing\u2026and growing and growing and growing up too soon.</p><p>Ten years had passed and I had grown into a beautiful young woman. Sturdy from living a peasant\u2019s life and yet gentle with innocence claiming my heart. I folded the now dried blanket after taking it off the line, but soon slipped away to sit in a tree, allowing my mind to wander.<br><br>I was now one small girl that wasn\u2019t so small. Lost in my daydreams day after day.</p><p>\u201cCall her name.\u201d Appa Shindong said.</p><p>But Eomma Taeyeon replied, \u201cNo, don\u2019t call. Her ears don\u2019t hear, she\u2019s far away.\u201d</p><p>My parents watched from the distance, talking among themselves after my mother finished my folding for me.</p><p>He agreed, \u201cAnd I know that she\u2019s getting older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that it\u2019s meant to be.\u201d</p><p>Their arms couldn\u2019t hold me and keep me small, but all l that their hearts could see was one small girl. One small girl. Just one small girl in a tree.</p><p>The two then grabbed a few things before going to market. On their way, a car was speeding past and almost ran them over. No honking either, to warn pedestrians to get out of the way. The life of privilege wreaked of the silver mercedes. A few yelps of terror turned my attention to a stranger in white in a car. Going somewhere. Going far.</p><p>I wondered what it would be like to have a life like his.</p><p><i>How it must feel to go racing wherever you please, flying as free as a bird with his tail in the breeze.</i> I thought even the fish in the sea must be longing to fly after catching a glimpse of a stranger in white racing by.<br><br>\u201cOh, gods. Oh, gods, are you there?\u201d You asked aloud. \u201cWhat can I do to get you to look down and give in? Oh, gods. Oh, gods, hear my prayer!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m here in the field with my feet on the ground and my fate in the air waiting for life to begin! I knew that Eomma\u2019s contented and Appa accepts what he gets. They were happy for tea in their cups and no holes in their nets. Happy to have what they have and to stay where they are, they never even looked up at the sound of a car.</p><p>A stranger racing down the beach. Racing to places I was meant to reach! My imagination took a step further and imagined him there in the middle of the drum circle. I joined him and swung my hips to the rhythm. Then I imagined his car would stop and in I\u2019d hop and off we\u2019d drive!</p><p>We\u2019ll drive~! I turned around and he was gone.</p><p>I sighed and saw the setting sun. Had it already gotten this late? It was about time to go home. Before I did, I called for the Gods like I had been taught since I was little. I used my whole heart and my entire body.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods. Oh, gods. Please be there. Don\u2019t you remember your little (Y/N) from the tree?\u201d I even tried commanding them to see if I would get a sign. \u201cWake up! Look down! Hear my prayer! Don\u2019t single me out And then forget me! Oh, gods. Oh, gods, let me fly!\u201d I spread my arms like wings. \u201cSend me to places where no one before me has been. You spared my life; show me why. You get me to rise like a fish to the bait then tell me to wait. Well, I\u2019m waiting!\u201d I called to the heavens.</p><p>Waiting for life to begin!</p><hr><p><i>And the gods heard her prayer.</i> Had a good laugh about it too.<br></p><p>Ros\u00e9 fanned herself, \u201cThe peasant girl wants a grand homme to carry her away! I should find a tree all covered with mangos\u2013juicy mangos, fat and well-fed. Pick a mango\u2014\u201d She took the one she just made from the tree.</p><p>Kibum took it from her, \u201cA juicy mango.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lovely mango.\u201d Jimin added before the mango was taken from him.</p><p>It was by Jeongyeon who said, \u201cA poison mango\u2014\u201d</p><p>But everyone scowled at her. She just shrugged it away. As a demon of death, it was her job to kill people. Poison did that. Anyways, Ros\u00e9 dropped the mango. It made a whistling sound as it fell from the heavens. Then boom!</p><p>\u201cTo knock some sense in her head!\u201d</p><p>They laughed and repeated, \u201cKnock some sense in her head!\u201d</p><p>Kibum offered to, \u201cSplash her with a wave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cScare her half to death!\u201d Jeongyeon lurched forward.</p><p>But Jimin saw how honest her prayer was, so he said, \u201cGive her what she wants!\u201d</p><p>Ros\u00e9, Kibum, and Jeongyeon looked at him, confused, \u201cGive her what she\u2026?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cGive her what she wants. Love has many powers. If the love is true, It can cross the earth, and withstand the storm. It can conquer\u2013\u201d Jimin poked in Jeongyeon\u2019s direction. \u201cEven you.\u201d</p><p>The gods of earth and water decided to walk away and give the two their space to talk, mostly because neither of them wanted to be put at odds with Death herself.</p><p>She scoffed, \u201cLove conquer death? Why, I could stop her heart like that!\u201d She snapped her fingers with a quickness.</p><p>Jimin smirked, \u201cStop her heart from beating, yes. But not from loving. Not if love is what she chooses.\u201d</p><p>Jeongyeon shook her head dismissively, \u201cRidiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting!\u201d Key piped up.</p><p>Ros\u00e9 nodded, \u201cMore amusing than mangos!\u201d</p><p>They came to a decision, \u201cA journey!\u201d</p><p>Jimin reached out to (Y/N), \u201cI will give her strength when the time is right.\u201d</p><p>Mother nature followed suit, \u201cI will guide her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will make her choose!\u201d A wicked grin spread across Death\u2019s face.</p><p>Kibum, already flowing down to Earth, said, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll provide the place where two different worlds will meet tonight!\u201d</p><p>Tonight!<br><br>God of water Kibum smeared his arm across the sky, \u201cLet there be no moon. Let the clouds race by. Where the road meets the sea, let the tide be high.\u201d And his head turned as he saw the girl about to return home. \u201cLet there be a girl\u2026\u201d He drew her back to the beach. \u201cWalking by the sea, and let there be rain!\u201d</p><p>A small trickle began as Key continued to command his part of nature, \u201cListen to her prayers, full of hope and pain as she stares down the road in the pouring rain.\u201d It quickly picked up.</p><p>She should\u2019ve been home by now or trying to get there more quickly, but instead she stood transfixed in the middle of the empty road. There was rain on the road. Rain on her face. Rain makes a road such a dangerous place.</p><p>He smiled to himself as the other player came near, \u201cLet there be a car racing through the night where the road meets the sea. Let her wait where the road meets the sea. Let him spin where the road meets the sea. Let their fate begin~ in the\u2026Raaaaaiiiinnnin!\u201d He bellowed and thunder clapped.</p><p>Kibum was gone as soon as he came, leaving an unsupervised driver swerve when he saw big brown eyes and a red dress in the middle of the street. He quickly ran into a tree which Ros\u00e9 made sure was unharmed in all of this.</p><hr><p>I heard the screech of wheels and metal bending. Saw lights brighter than the moon and then nothing. I went to him and screamed at the top of my lungs.</p><p>\u201cHelp! Someone! Come quickly! A car has crashed!\u201d I held him in my arms. \u201cA boy is hurt! Help me, someone! Where is everyone?\u201d</p><p>Not a soul was coming near. It was if we weren\u2019t on the sandy beach at all, but somewhere else where only the two of us existed.</p><p>\u201cHello? Can you hear me?\u201d I asked.</p><p><i>His skin is so pale</i>, I think.</p><p>\u201cCan you see me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened for a moment. They were eyes from another world. Gray as the sky.</p><p>I spoke to whoever heard, \u201cOh, gods. Oh, gods, you saved my life for a reason. And now, I think I know why!\u201d</p><p>A man\u2019s voice made me jump, \u201cHe roared down the road like the devil himself\u2026\u201d</p><p>More people started to gather.</p><p>\u201cGoing too fast around the curves!\u201d A thick woman added.</p><p>\u201cSent us scrambling off the road like chickens\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has what he deserves!\u201d</p><p>No, what? He didn\u2019t deserve this! He was too kind.</p><p>A beautiful woman squaked, \u201cJeongyeon wants him\u2026\u201d</p><p>The man she was with finished, \u201cAnd Jeongyeon will have him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy is dying before our eyes!\u201d one of the men before spoke up again.</p><p>\u201cHelp him!\u201d Mom said.</p><p>\u201cHide him!\u201d One of her friends said right after.</p><p>Appa interrupted, \u201cNoooo! Don\u2019t touch him! Better leave him where he lies. Even a wealthy man sometimes dies.\u201d</p><p>How could he? I spoke up, \u201cPlease! He needs help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this boy dies in our hands, the rich will send police.\u201d He stated.</p><p>\u201cHe needs care!\u201d</p><p>Eomma agreed, \u201cAnd if he lives, oh, how angry the gods will be!\u201d</p><p>Everyone around me seemed to have the same idea, \u201cThe only thing that will save the boy\u2019s life is to send him back to his world!\u201d</p><p>I knew I was being stubborn, but I had to be, \u201cThe only thing that will save the boy\u2019s life\u2026 is me!\u201d</p><p>All the villagers stared in disbelief, finally silent and still even as rain covered us head to toe.</p><p>So I continued, \u201cI have prayed to the gods and at last they\u2019ve answered. They saved my life so that I could save his. My heart knows this.\u201d My eyes looked at my father. \u201cPlease, Appa.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cI will find where he comes from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShindong! No!\u201d Eomma Taeyeon held his arm tightly.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI will find who he is, and soon! But \u2019til I return, you care for him, (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>And, after he bid his wife and daughter goodbye, Shindong set off down the road, toward the Black Mountains. The peasants carried the boy to the village, and laid him on my mat. And so my long vigil began\u2026</p><p>One day gone by like it was nothing, just making sure he was dried off as much as possible with rain pelting the windows. And two days gone by without him opening his eyes at all. People would stop by just to whisper about the whole situation.</p><p>They would say things such as, \u201cThe boy has the will of the devil himself, clinging to life by one small thread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Julian\u2019s daughter, he\u2019d certainly be dead!\u201d</p><p>Even when I was just doing the most simple of things to make sure he was being taken care of properly, they\u2019d whisper and gossip as if they weren\u2019t standing outside of my hut. As if I couldn\u2019t hear them. I did, but I was too focused on trying to save this boy\u2019s life to care about any of it.</p><p>It was two women chirping back and forth, \u201cLook how she bathes him\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd touches and protects him.\u201d</p><p>Two men were by their sides, \u201cShe binds his wounds and she rubs his chest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if the girl\u2019s possessed!\u201d</p><p>My mother worried for me as I looked through every book and was alarmed by every cough, \u201cYou need food. You need sleep. You just can\u2019t go on without any sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEomma, sssh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave some tea.\u201d She offered.</p><p>I felt his arm, \u201cHis skin is hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a rest.\u201d She had even set out another mat for me in the corner.</p><p>\u201cHe needs me here.\u201d</p><p>I was tired of her trying to convince me away from him, so I went to yell at her but we ended up talking over each other, \u201cCan\u2019t you see how much this matters to me? I know what\u2019s best!\u201d</p><p>Eomma was shocked at my words, but that didn\u2019t stop her from sticking around me as I tried a new healing techniques. Now the sky was growing dim and the clouds are racing by. The gods are looking down at a boy they meant to die and a girl who placed herself in their way\u2026 So they prayed.</p><p>Three days gone by and my stomach was still empty other than what slithered down when I chewed up herbs and leaves and turned them into a fine paste. And four days gone by without one wink of sleep. I don\u2019t know if I even blinked when keeping my eye on him.</p><p>Two brothers and their sister came to watch me work today.</p><p>The oldest spoke first, \u201cI fear for the girl and her mother, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing but trouble looms ahead.\u201d Their sister agreed.</p><p>\u201cMister Shindong could be deep in danger.\u201d The youngest spoke.</p><p>Their sister spoke again, \u201cArrested, lost or dead!\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>In the forest on the edge of the mountains, Shindong held a lit lamp and looked around with worry in his heart. He paused for a second and got on his knees.</p><p>\u201cRos\u00e9, mother of the earth, guide the feet of this poor peasant man. Hear my prayer. Which way there\u2026and which way home?\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>I called to my mom, \u201cI need herbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father gone\u2013\u201d She replied.</p><p>\u201cEomma, herbs!\u201d I didn\u2019t have time for her nagging.</p><p>My mother was upset, \u201cAnd you don\u2019t care. Oh, my god what has this boy done to you?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her hands, \u201cMam\u2026sssh!\u201d and went back to the boy. \u201cHe needs rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour appa lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs care\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pointed in my direction, \u201cBecause of <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>We spoke over each other once more, \u201cCan\u2019t you see that he\u2019s in terrible danger? What must I do?\u201d</p><p>Now the sky is turning dark, and the wind is turning chill. The gods are out for blood. They\u2019ve been cheated of their kill by a girl without the sense to obey\u2026so they prayed. They moved their feet together in order to ward off evil because once it got in it probably wouldn\u2019t leave with just a single casualty.</p><p>Everytime death came near, I\u2019d use water and flame. Herbs and prayer to keep him alive. I didn\u2019t even know his name, but I went without sleeping for many days to have the hope of knowing it from his own lips.<br><br>\u201cYeobo! Where is my yeobo! Bring my Shindong home!\u201d Taeyeon wailed.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>At that same time, Shindong had made it to the gates but was confronted by the gatekeepers. He begged for entry.</p><p>\u201cYou want what?\u201d The keeper scoffed.</p><p>The chubby man replied, \u201cI\u2019ve come so far and I need\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some news for Kim-nim\u2013\u201d</p><p>The guard warned again, \u201c<i>Get back!</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cMin Seonsaeng-nim has a\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeasant pig!\u201d He slapped the man for his insolence.</p><p>Now on the ground, Appa Shindong said, \u201cPlease, I beg!\u201d</p><p>The guard was surprised, \u201cYou must be mad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must see Seonsaeng-nim\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cMin Seonsaeng-nim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have come so far\u2013\u201d He tried to get up but was stopped by the barrel of a gun.</p><p>\u201cSo far to die!\u201d</p><p>His eyes caught a missing poster with the image of the boy from the crash and pointed desperately, \u201cI have found his son!\u201d</p><p>That caught their attention and so the guard helped him up, a bit suspicious but he wasn\u2019t the one with a life to lose if this man was lying.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Now the sky has turned to black and the wind is like a knife. Jeongyeon is coming back for the boy who clings to life and the girl will have the gods to repay\u2026</p><p>They prayed with their whole bodies, \u201cJeongyeon, don\u2019t come around me! Jeongyeon, don\u2019t come around me! Jeongyeon, don\u2019t come around me! Jeongyeon, don\u2019t come around me!\u201d</p><p>Some say it was the worst storm the Gods had ever sent. Peasants prayed that they\u2019d live to see the morning, but what of (Y/N)? </p><p>What of me? Well, some say I had gone without sleep for so long that my mind wandered further into my dreams. I had no wind nor rain, only my beating heart of this pale dying boy.</p><p>I even sang to him as comfort, \u201cSure as a wave needs to be near the shore. You are the one I was intended for. Deep in your eyes, I saw the gods\u2019 design. Now my life is forever yours.\u201d I smiled. \u201cAnd you are mine.\u201d</p><p>I changed his bandages and sang, \u201cI am a tree holding away the storm. Here in my arms, I\u2019ll keep you safe and warm. Even the gods won\u2019t dare to cross this line where my life is forever yours, and you are mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are mine,\u201d came his voice from the doorway.</p><p>I knew he\u2019d be ok because of me!</p><p>Our hearts sang together, \u201cMine\u2026We\u2019ll race away in a car as silver as the moon, and the storm will turn to sun on an island where the earth and sea are one. Sure as this night leads to a sky of blue. Sure as my heart led me to be with you.\u201d He leaned his forehead on my own. \u201cSurely the gods meant this to be a sign that my life is forever yours and you are\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiiiiiine! MIIIINNEE!\u201d It was, Jeongyeon. There was no mistaking it.</p><p>Where was my boy?</p><p>She stood above him and grinned the darkest grin I had ever seen, \u201cArrogant fool. Think you can hold back death?\u201d</p><p>Death herself came before me, but I wouldn\u2019t let her ruin this, \u201cStay away!\u201d I was shaking but stood firm.</p><p>Jeongyeon shoved me back without even touching me, \u201cThis boy is mine. I am his dying breath!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you have him!\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cSure as the grave, you must accept what is! Now his life is forever mine~\u201d</p><p>It was if death was pulling his soul from out of his body. It raised with her motion. I had to do something! Something now!</p><p>\u201cTake mine for his!\u201d I blurted.</p><p>She looked at me with shock, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>With more conviction, I repeated, \u201cTake my life. My soul\u2026 for his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the road leading to no return.\u201d Jeongyeon warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d I glared at her.</p><p>She returned it tenfold, \u201cSecret of life nobody wants to learn\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would die for him!\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>\u201cI am the car racing toward distant shores.\u201d</p><p>My eyes were on him, not death, \u201cNow his life is forever mine\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jeongyeon pulled my attention back and pulled my soul into her grasp as well, \u201cYour life is forever mine\u2026\u201d</p><p>It was excruciatingly painful, but as soon as it was over, I looked back at the boy whose life I was saving, \u201cAnd I am yours\u2026\u201d</p><p>Our fates were sealed. Death left humming to herself followed by a laugh like the cracking of bones.</p><hr><p>The next day I realized I had finally gone to sleep after staying up to protect my boy. I don\u2019t know how long but I awoke to pale muscles holding me as they took him away! They gave me to my worried parents as they took him to a truck and laid him in the back still on top of my mat!<br></p><p>\u201cNo, stop!\u201d I called. \u201cYou can\u2019t take him! Give him back!\u201d My arms flailed and failed to reach his still unconscious form.</p><p>He was getting better! The Gods\u2013why was he taken from me?</p><p>My father\u2019s grip was firm, \u201cNow the Gods are happy! He is there in his world and you are here in ours! Everything is as it should be (Y/N)!\u201d he looked me dead in the eyes. \u201cThere can never be anything between a peasant and a Sacred Bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppa, he needs me!\u201d My gaze held strong. \u201cWithout me\u2026he\u2019ll die!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet the Gods decide his fate!\u201d My mother said. \u201cWhat can a peasant like you do for someone like him but shine his shoes?!\u201d</p><p>I went to her and held her hands, \u201cHis ancestors one loved a peasant girl.\u201d</p><p>I had heard the villagers gossiping about his heritage all while I did my best to heal him. His family cursed to stay on this island while their hearts forever yearned for their homeland.</p><p>\u201cThis time a Sacred Bone will marry one. I know it!\u201d I made eye contact with both my parents. The ones who raised me. \u201cI am in his blood and he is in mine.\u201d</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon\u2019s face fell, crumbled, \u201cMarry you?\u201d She held my face in her hands. \u201cYou are mad. He will not marry you, (Y/N)!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must go to him.\u201d I said, not a shred of doubt in my heart. </p><p>I took Eomma\u2019s hands from my face and backed away from her. How could they not believe me? It wasn\u2019t as if it were some random thing! It was my hearts! It was the Gods! I loved him and we were meant to be together!</p><p>\u201cI must go to him! His heart beats for me like a drum. The gods are dancing for me, Eomma!\u201d I said. \u201cPlease, Eomma. Please, Appa.\u201d I begged them with my whole heart. \u201cGive me your blessing and let me go.\u201d</p><p>They said nothing with their mouths, but spoke to one another with their eyes. I knew my answer! Why didn\u2019t they know theirs?</p><p>Stubborn words came out of my mouth, \u201c I will go!\u201d</p><p>My mom sighed and tucked her hair behind her ear, \u201cWhat can I say to stop you now now that you\u2019ve heard your drums and seen your dancers? Now that you think your heart has all the answers?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were filled with sorrow as she looked at me, \u201cWho knows how high those mountains climb? Who knows how deep those rivers flow? Who knows how wrong a dream can go, (Y/N)?\u201d</p><p>Appa Shindong gently touched my arm, \u201cI won\u2019t be there to guide your way\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo braid your hair or dry your tears\u2026\u201d Eomma added. \u201cAs we have done these many years, (Y/N). (Y/N)\u2026\u201d</p><p>My father had me sit, \u201cWhat you are, we made you. What we gave, you took. Now you run without one backward look.\u201d</p><p>Mother smoothed my hair, \u201cYou\u2019ll find some other boy to save. Some other life that you can share. Your heart is young; new dreams are everywhere. Choose your dreams with care, (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I <i>have </i>chosen. And my dreams are there, down <i>that </i>road!\u201d I stood and pointed out the window.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a child, (Y/N)!\u201d Appa bellowed. \u201cThe road is hard and dangerous. The city is miles away. And even if you get there, even if you get to the Hotel Holly, you will never get through the gate!\u201d</p><p>His voice was anger and confusion and heavy with pleading. Why was he so worried? </p><p>\u201cI will get there, Appa. I will get through the gate. I\u2019m not a child any longer!\u201d I knew their words but felt so different about them. \u201cWhat I am, you made me. What you gave, I owe. But if I look back, I\u2019ll never go. Who knows how high those mountains climb?\u201d</p><p>I gazed out the window, \u201cWho knows how deep those rivers flow?\u201d and then turned my attention back to them. \u201cI know he\u2019s there. That\u2019s all I need to know\u2026\u201d</p><p>As they always did when things were rough, they hid their tears even though their aged faces showed everything they were feeling. I couldn\u2019t just give up, though. He was my fate! Us being together was destiny. I didn\u2019t argue with it, so why\u2013</p><p>\u201cGo and find your love.\u201d Appa Shindong said.</p><p>Eomma nodded and placed her necklace around my neck, \u201cGo and swim the sea.\u201d</p><p>Together, they assured me, \u201cYou know where we\u2019ll be\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways there with me\u2026\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026\u201d they hugged me tightly.</p><p>So I set off into the world with everything looking so bright and new! It was scary\u2026just a little bit. Ok, maybe a lot of bit. I had nowhere\u2026no idea where I was going. But on this island, the earth sings as soon as the storm ends. And as my feet set out, I realized I was walking with old friends.</p><p>The birds\u2026The trees\u2026The frogs\u2026And the breezes\u2026 That\u2019s when I lost all my fear. I knew Ros\u00e9 was near! She appeared out of nowhere and had a huge smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been away from the sea, child. You\u2019re gonna need a helping hand. A fish has got to learn to swim on land!\u201d She motioned me towards her. \u201cWalk with me, little girl. Don\u2019t you be afraid. Follow me, little girl, let me be your guide. A pretty thing like you will need a thing or two\u201d</p><p>She booped my nose and I giggled.</p><p>\u201cAnd whatever you need. Mama will provide. Ohhhhh! Down the road, little girl, you may lose your way. All alone in a world that may seem too wide.\u201d</p><p>The red haired goddess sat on an upturned boat and tapped her skirt to motion for me to place myself there, \u201cBut sit on mama\u2019s lap, and I will draw a map, and whatever you need Mama will provide!\u201d</p><p>She sat up and twirled me in all sorts of ways. It was as if the earth itself was speaking to me and bending to her will.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll provide you moss to soften the road! Rocks to sit on! Trees to sleep underneath! Sand, fun for your toes! Plantain to fill up your belly!\u201d And the wind danced through my hair as she sang to me. \u201cBreeze to fan your face! Grass for making your bed!\u201d</p><p>I pointed at a blood sucking little fella that kept buzzing around me, \u201cMosquitoes?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cHa!\u201d</p><p>I tried to clap it between my hands, but it must\u2019ve flown away as my hands were free of any squashed bug bits.</p><p>\u201cBugs will bite, little girl and the night will fall. All alone in the dark, you\u2019ll be terrified. But you will make it through \u2018cause I am liking you!\u201d She spun me around once more. \u201cAnd whatever you need Mama will provide!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama will provide\u2026Mama will provide\u2026Mama will provide\u2026\u201d The forest sang as my footsteps became more sure.</p><p>Ros\u00e9 belted into my ear, \u201cOh\u2026!\u201d and giggled at my startled reaction. \u201cWalk with me, little girl and I\u2019ll take you far! \u2018Round each bend, little friend, I\u2019ll be by your side. That\u2019s what Mama\u2019s worth, to give her child the earth, and whatever you need, mama will\u2026\u201d She took a deep breath as the plants twirled and prepared themselves for another belting moment. \u201cPROVIIIIIIIIIDDEEE!\u201d</p><p>I embraced her and with a wave of Ros\u00e9\u2019s fan, a clear path came before me. She motioned me on and off I went.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Some say\u2026How you began your long journey toward the city! Some say your feet were bare and the road was long and cruel Some say you got a ride from a vendor and his mule. Some say the gods pulled up in a car and drove you all the way. Well, no one knows how the real truth goes, but that\u2019s what some say!</p><p>Some might wonder how far did she travel. The answer is as far as they suppose. And how long did it take you? Much longer than their nose! And were you ever frightened or was your love too strong? And did you know she\u2019d end up in a story and a song?</p><p>What happened when (Y/N) finally reached the city? Some say they laughed at you for your peasant feet were bare. Some say that vendor man gave you shoes too small to wear. Some say\u2026the gods said, \u201cPut on the shoes! It\u2019s the price you have to pay!\u201d</p><p>The shoes were tight, but you said, \u201cAlright!\u201d</p><p>Well, that\u2019s what some say! Some say that at last (still wearing her painful new city shoes) you arrived at the gates of the Hotel Holly. But the fierce guard saw you had nothing to sell to the tourists.</p><p>\u201cSTOP!\u201d They yelled.</p><p>But you must have smiled your most beautiful smile. And Jimin must have touched the fierce guard on the shoulder, for he nodded and some say the gate swung open and you entered and went in search of your Yoongi. Some say you scrubbed the floors \u2018til you learned where he was kept. Some say you climbed a vine to the window where he slept. While some say the gods just lifted you up and placed you where he lay.</p><p>Well, no one knows how the real truth goes. It all depends what you hear from friends. It\u2019s no surprise, if it\u2019s all just lies, but that\u2019s what some say\u2026<br></p><hr><p>I waited until I saw him struggle to get into his bed with his crutches that I came to help him. His eyes opened wide as he put his hand up to stop me and he backed up, frightened.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in here? It isn\u2019t allowed!\u201d</p><p>I spoke up, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember me? It\u2019s (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out before I call a guard.\u201d He hissed.</p><p>My body moved on its own, closer to him, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me? I saved your life.\u201d</p><p>He scuffed, \u201c<i>You </i>saved my life? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Did he really not recall? But the Gods\u2026</p><p>I stood back at the foot of his bed, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi answered with a quick, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me as I swayed nervously. I had come all this way to be with him. I pressed on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who found you crushed inside your car.\u201d My words were gentle but firm. \u201cI watched over you when you nearly died. I bathed you and gave you my mat to lie on.\u201d It was nowhere to be found.</p><p>My dark brown hands smoothed his expensive white bed sheets as they recalled how they cared for his unconscious body for days on end. Still no recollection was to be found behind his coconut colored eyes illuminated by the bedside lamp.</p><p>So I approached him, \u201cI have seen the scar on your chest. It\u2019s like a half moon.\u201d I cupped my hand to match its shape and placed it near his heart where I knew the scar was. \u201cHere~\u201d</p><p>Yoongi blinked, a pout on his lips but finally a memory breaking through, \u201cSo, it was you?\u201d</p><p>I smiled and felt his head though he flinched at my touch, \u201cYes! You\u2019re very ill. You burn like fire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy leg won\u2019t heal.\u201d He motioned to his bandaged calf.</p><p>\u201cThe Gods sent me to make you well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think your peasant superstitions can do what doctors can\u2019t?\u201d He squinted his eyes. \u201cYou, little girl?\u201d</p><p>I took on a semi-scolding tone, \u201cI kept you alive in the face of death! Anyone in my village would tell you so, and I can heal you. Now.\u201d</p><p>Was he really going to keep doubting someone sent by the Gods after defying one of them? His future wife?</p><p>\u201cYou should go home.\u201d Yoongi said.</p><p>I knelt at the side of his bed, our hands only inches apart.</p><p>\u201cBut I came all the way to be with you! Let me stay.\u201d</p><p>He stuck out his chin, \u201cOh? So you can tell me more stories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am telling the truth.\u201d I said simply.</p><p>The black haired man scoffed, \u201cA pretty thing\u2013what\u2013sent by the \u2018gods\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I looked into his eyes, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Min Yoongi just stared at me, slightly taken aback by how serious I was. How could I not be serious when he doubted my very reality so? My people\u2019s song came in on the wind. He seemed to have recalled something else. A puzzled look came across his face.</p><p>Another glance at me, \u201cAlright then\u2026What harm can it do?\u201d He did a sloppy hand flourish towards his leg. \u201cHow me your powers. I\u2019ll pretend to believe them.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me as I sat now on the edge of his bed smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cPerhaps maybe the Gods did send me a gift after all.\u201d</p><p>So I began to work on his ailing parts. I felt a presence but it didn\u2019t interrupt, simply watched as I took care of my soulmate.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Jimin watched from the window, making sure he was known just enough but did not interfere. He wanted to help\u2026move things along since you had worked so hard to get here. His song was like a spell nudging your hearts closer together.</p><p>\u201cOoh, ooh. The courage of a dreamer\u2026The innocence of youth\u2026The failures and the foolishness\u2026That lead us to the truth.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he noticed how happy you were just to be near Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cThe hopes that make us happy. The hopes that don\u2019t come true. And all the love there ever was: I see this all in you.\u201d Because he believed that \u201cYou are part~Part of the human heart.\u201d</p><p>Yes, the way you looked at him and took care of him. There was no doubt in Jimin\u2019s mind that you were part of the human heart. You were part of all who took the journey.</p><p>\u201cAnd managed to endure. The ones who knew such tenderness. The ones who felt so sure. The ones who came before you. The others yet to come, and those who you will teach it to.\u201d His gaze reached to comfort Eomma Taeyeon and Appa Shindong. \u201cAnd those you learned it from.\u201d</p><p>The blonde beauty recognized the change in Yoongi\u2019s eyes as he saw how you worked and got him to hold your hand to bring you closer to him. He continued to work his magic and almost giggled at how shocked you were.</p><p>\u201cYou are part~Part of the human heart. You are part\u2026This is the gift I give through your love you\u2019ll live forever\u2026Forever~ Forever.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi caressed your hair all the way down your cheek and to your chin. You couldn\u2019t help but stare at his chin. Jimin made sure your love\u2019s hand was firmly around your waist.</p><p>\u201cYou are part\u2026Tonight~Tonight~Part of the human heart~~~~\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>And he kissed me. I kissed him back of course. My heart was pounding inside my chest. I knew that he\u2019d love me once he knew the truth, once he accepted it. I could hear the wedding bells already.</p><p>And the night became day. Still Yoongi kept the gentle (Y/N) beside him! The day became a week and still you slept in his room. After two weeks, the gossip began spreading through the walls of the Hotel Holly\u2013even into the city\u2013until everyone had heard that the ailing Min Yoongi had chosen a peasant as a lover. And little~by little~ you were \u201chealing him\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNow, what can he want with a woman like her?\u201d A man asked as he walked with a friend and two women.</p><p>\u201cBlacker than coal and low as dirt!\u201d The woman on his arm added.</p><p>Her friend agreed, \u201cHe could have the world but takes a peasant!\u201d</p><p>The other man smacked his own head, \u201cPerhaps his brain was hurt!\u201d</p><p>Even the servants whispered, \u201cLook how she holds him and touches and attends him. The boy believes she can make him well\u2026and she has him in a spell.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi had been laying with his head on my lap while I caressed his pale face. I tapped his shoulder so that he would stand. I did as well, fiddling with the locket Eomma had given me when I left the village.</p><p>\u201cI have a gift for you.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi grinned, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d tucking his shirt into his pants.</p><p>\u201cA charm.\u201d I kneeled on his bed and took it off. \u201cIf you wear it next to your heart, it will make you whole again.\u201d</p><p>I clasped it around his neck and let my arms rest on his shoulders. He beamed at me with sunlight and affection in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou are my charm.\u201d My love kissed my cheek. \u201cWithout you, I could never be whole again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never leave you, Yoongi.\u201d</p><p>Two women, overdressed for any occasion, commented on the relationship as well.</p><p>The one in green asked, \u201cNow, what do you make of a peasant like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPutting on airs without a doubt!\u201d Her friend in a lighter green replied.</p><p>A man passing by inserted himself in the conversation, \u201cWhen the boy is well and does not need her\u2014\u201d</p><p>The two women joined him in completing his thought, \u201c\u2014How soon he\u2019ll throw her out!\u201d</p><p>Lifting his crutch off the ground, Yoongi spun in a circle, \u201cSoon, I\u2019ll be dancing again!\u201d</p><p>I smiled and caught him before he fell and waited for his crutch to touch the floor once more, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll dance with you! But for now, walk slowly, Yoongi.\u201d</p><p>A spark came alive in his eyes, \u201cThen you must walk even more slowly~\u201d</p><p>With a giggle, I asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can <i>catch </i>you!\u201d He began to playfully chase me with a slight limp ang giggling, so I ran just fast enough to stay out of his grasp.</p><p>His father called out to him, \u201cYoongi-ah!\u201d a paduk board in his grasp.</p><p>He stopped in his tracks, \u201cAbeoji.\u201d</p><p>His cold eyes glared at me, so I made my way back to my love\u2019s room. Part of me was afraid Min Appa would hit me across the head with that board. The other guests turned their heads whenever I met their eyes. Nothing mattered as long as Yoongi love me, which he did.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think you\u2019ll be playing this game?\u201d The older man asked.</p><p>His son shook his head, \u201cThis is no game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you can\u2019t believe it\u2019s real?\u201d He scoffed.</p><p>Yoongi nodded, \u201cI\u2019m in love with (Y/N)!\u201d</p><p>Min Abeoji replied sternly, \u201cYou are not the first to want a peasant. I, too, know their appeal\u2026But you are my son. You\u2019ll do what must be done <i>no matter what you feel</i>!\u201d</p><p>He left his son with sadness in his heart. Yoongi began to go in the direction his love had gone while the guests snickered behind his back. The trio from earlier had seen everything but pretended like they had not by hiding behind fans and newspapers.</p><p>\u201cI know what he sees in a peasant like her\u2026\u201d The man said coming from behind his paper.</p><p>\u201cProbably makes him rise like yeast!\u201d the light green clothed woman commented.</p><p>Servants continued to gossip, \u201cWell, the girl may think she\u2019s very clever. The boy may keep her here forever.\u201d</p><p>However, sacred bone and servants alike agreed, \u201cBut I can tell you this: They\u2019ll never stand before a priest!\u201d</p><p>As Yoongi finished getting ready, I explained how our lives would be once we were a happily married couple. Every day with him would be happy because we were in love. We were together just as the Gods had willed. Just like we would be until we died.</p><p>\u201c\u2026and we\u2019ll have a little house with pink walls and a blue roof. And a tree in a garden just like the one that used to shelter me as a child. Then you and I can lie under the shade of the tree~\u201d I sprawled across the fine bedclothes.</p><p>My love Yoongi moved to sit, so I rolled on my side.</p><p>\u201cAnd then our children will climb it.\u201d</p><p>He stood with a start and looked at me. Maybe he hadn\u2019t thought that far, but it would happen. We\u2019d have children. I\u2019d bear as many as he wanted.</p><p>\u201cAnd it will be ours, forever.\u201d I looked at him with wide and innocent eyes.</p><p>He gave me a sweet smirk and moved to a mirror to tie his cream colored bowtie. Yoongi began to talk about how he loved me. I folded my legs and kicked them out to lie on the bed once more.</p><p>=================<br></p><p>I, Min Yoongi, son of a well known sacred bone, making me a sacred bone as well, continued to get ready for tonight\u2019s ball, \u201cSome girls take hours to paint every perfect nail\u2026Fragrant as flowers all powdered and prim and pale; but you are as wild as that wind-blown tree. As dark and as deep as the midnight sea. While they\u2019re busy dressing, you lie here warm and bold~\u201d</p><p>This girl who had shown up out of nowhere claiming to have healed my body </p><p>I said as I finished doing his tie and moving on to fixing my color and suspenders. \u201cSome girls you picture. Some you hold.\u201d</p><p>You looked at me him still in awe, innocence in your loving gaze. I thought about what my father said and continued, \u201cSome girls take courses at all the best schools in France; riding their horses and learning their modern dance. They\u2019re clever and cultured and worldly-wise, but you see the world through a child\u2019s wide eyes.\u201d</p><p>I used hair wax to make my black strands stay in place. \u201cWhile their dreams are grand ones. You want what\u2019s just in reach.\u201d Jamie wanted so much. Everything material, expensive, wanted what her parents raised her to want.</p><p>My smile couldn\u2019t be contained as I wiped my hands on a towel, \u201cSome girls you learn from. Some you teach. You are not small talk or shiny cars or mirrors or French cologne.\u201d I sprayed a bit on myself since it had become routine for me, and you didn\u2019t seem to hate it.</p><p>\u201cYou are the river, the moon, the stars: You\u2019re no one else I\u2019ve known\u2026\u201d</p><p>You tilted your head to get me to tell you more.</p><p>I replied, \u201cSome girls take pleasure in buying a fine trousseau. Counting each treasure and tying each tiny bow. They fold up their futures with perfumed hands while you face the future with no demands. Some girls expect things others think nothing of.\u201d</p><p>Then I turned to look at the door knowing my fiancee was just down the hall, \u201cSome girls you marry.\u201d Because there was no other choice. My eyes met yours, \u201cSome you love~\u201d</p><p>I loved you. Ever since you came into my room telling stories that I still wasn\u2019t sure were true, but I didn\u2019t care because my heart wanted you. (Y/N) was my happiness. You could never betray me for riches because you didn\u2019t want anything but me.</p><hr><p>Beautiful light music filled the grand hall as Yoongi greeted guests who congratulated him on his upcoming wedding with Jamie but whispered about him once he was gone. Large crystal chandeliers lit up the dance floor and the candlelit tables were attended by servants in the hotel uniforms. Flower petals cascaded from the ceiling and onto the floor. Laughter echoed off the walls.<br></p><p>The Sacred Bones at the Hotel Holly, dancing to their own little tune. Waiting to see\u2026 (Y/N)!</p><p>Jamie in her golden dress approached her husband to be who was probably on the lookout for his mistress. Jamie had not the\u2026pleasure of seeing her. Yoongi spent all his hours with her other than the times she was sleeping and he had to to talk to her about their upcoming wedding.</p><p>\u201cSome girls are saying she\u2019s simple as any child.\u201d She said with her arms folded.</p><p>He sighed, \u201cPlease, Jamie\u2026\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop talking about the rumors, \u201cBarefoot and praying and running the halls quite wild!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is she as pretty as we\u2019ve all heard? Your own pretty\u2026Well, what\u2019s the word?\u201d</p><p>They noticed all the heads turning to see a girl with a red hibiscus flower crown and an extravagant red dress to match. It was me. I approached Yoongi eagerly and relieved to see him looking at me, completely smitten with me.</p><p>\u201cYoongi~!\u201d I slowed when I saw him beside another woman.</p><p>\u201cSo this is your (Y/N). How beautiful she is.\u201d She looked at me.</p><p>My love introduced us, \u201c(Y/N), this is Gongju-nim Jamie. Jamie, this is (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>A woman I did not know bowed to me, \u201cI\u2019m so happy to meet you, my dear lady. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re a healer and a dancer, as well. Won\u2019t you dance for us now? Won\u2019t you give us a show?<br>Please, dear girl\u2026Don\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Yoongi who held my hands, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, (Y/N). Dance as you always do\u2026 Just for me.\u201d</p><p>I stood in the center of the room and began the dance I had known since I was a child. My feet nearly came from under me since I was not accustomed to dancing with shoes on my feet. So I took them off, but the familiar looking servants refused to take them from me. Hiding their faces and moving away. Then a man approached and took the bejeweled slippers from me.</p><p>Then I returned to my spot and felt the eyes on my. Looking around, it seemed as though I held the attention of the whole room.</p><p>In a tune that felt like home, one of the serving woman sang, \u201cWe dance~\u201d</p><p>As if by magic, the song came into my heart, \u201cWe dance~\u201d</p><p>WE DANCE!</p><p>My feet began to move to the music played by dark faces. I had danced as I always did to a song that I hadn\u2019t heard in what felt like years. My skirt fanned out around me with every spin, and I noticed the pale pink of a hotel maid twirling next to mine. She must\u2019ve gotten permission from her bosses. Eventually emerald green flew in rhythm with the legs of tailored suits.</p><p>The island blood could be hidden with powders and creams but it pulsed nonetheless. Guests clapped and cheered along to the tune as our reet moved to the rapid drums. Even my Yoongi joined in for the last bit. I really had taught him well. All the air in my lungs had gone through my feet, so I was panting hard once the song ended. My love held my hands for a moment before I went to retrieve my shoes but was stopped by an important looking man.</p><p>=================</p><p>Jamie was upset as she pulled Yoongi to the side. Everyone was back in their places. Their roles\u2026except (Y/N) and Jamie\u2019s husband to be who had let this go on long enough.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s very clear. She\u2019s in love with you. Yoongi, if you care, if you care at all, you must tell her.\u201d</p><p>You came back to your Min Yoongi with a large dazzling smile on your face, \u201cYoongi! Oh, the Ambassador said I was beautiful!!\u201d</p><p>=================</p><p>I was giddy and joyful after dancing in front of so many people and getting so many compliments afterwards. I forgot about my shoes and went to tell the man who loved me.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is so happy that I\u2019m here with you!\u201d</p><p>Something was off.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I searched Jamie\u2019s and Yoongi\u2019s faces for an answer.</p><p>She waited for him to speak, but was the one to talk when he didn\u2019t. Jamie held my hands with affectionate concern.</p><p>Jamie, with her dazzling gold crown to match her dress spoke firmly, \u201cMy dear dear girl, I have something to say. Something I fear was left unsaid. Many thanks for all you\u2019ve given Yoongi, but do not be misled. My dear Mademoiselle, you dance so very well. I pray you\u2019ll dance for Yoongi and for me when we are wed\u2026\u201d She let go at my shocked expression. \u201c(Y/N), Yoongi and I\u2026\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and at him. Wed? Her? Jamie was to wed my\u2026my Yoongi? I felt my heart sink.</p><p>He tried to explain, \u201cJamie and I have been promised to each other since we were children. This is how things are done, (Y/N). It\u2019s expected.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to cry, \u201cYoongi-ah, please\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will always be a place for you here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jamie decided it was best to give us space and left to talk with guests.</p><p>But our dream. \u201cWe\u2019ll race away in a car\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t change who I am or where I\u2019m from.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014 As silver as the moon\u2026\u201d</p><p>Yoongi shook his head, \u201cI wish it could be so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will live beside the sea. We\u2019ll have children, a garden, and a tree\u2026\u201d I held him tightly.</p><p>He held me away from him, \u201cI thought you understood. We could never marry.\u201d</p><p>We could\u2026never? Yoongi took off the necklace I had given him and placed it in my hands. Then he went back to the main room to continue being a part of the party. I was on the balcony, alone with my broken heart.</p><p>I called out to the gods once again with my whole heart, \u201cOh, gods. Oh, gods, Are you there? Are you there\u2026?\u201d</p><p>All the whispers from before and even after travelling to be with him swarmed in my head. \u201cBlacker than coal and low as dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has that boy done to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what he sees in a woman like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook how she bathes him and touches and protects him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to have the gods to repay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gods to repay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gods to repay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Gods to repay!!\u201d</p><p>The Gods to repay!<br></p><p>Jeongyeon appeared before me and everything went dead silent. She smirked at my current state of weakness. It\u2019s as if the rattle of a snake was inside of me as Death slithered closer to me.</p><p>\u201cThere were promises made in the darkness; promises made in your sleep; promises the gods demand you keep!\u201d She darted at me but I moved out of the way, \u201cYou gave him love. Love he would soon betray!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave him life. I am the price you\u2019ll pay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure as the grave. You must accept what is\u2026Now your life is forever mine\u2026\u201d Death held a knife to my throat.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to die! \u201cPlease, DON\u2019T!!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrade yours for his\u2026\u201d Jeongyeon said, removing the knife from my throat.</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved him. You loved him. And he betrayed you. Why should you die for him now?\u201d \u201cKill him, (Y/N). Kill the love~ you feel for him. Prove that <b><i>death is stronger than love</i></b> and you can have your own life again. Just as if you had never loved at all.\u201d She handed me the blade. </p><p>Death pulled him closer to me, \u201cI am the road leading to no return\u2026\u201d</p><p>A song that I had heard before was sung between her words, but it was so quiet in comparison, <i>\u201cThe courage of a dreamer\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cSecret of life finally his to learn\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYou are part\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>I had to choose. I could kill him. Easily. He wasn\u2019t even looking. No one noticed the dagger in my hand as I approached him from behind. Things could go back to normal. I\u2019d return to my own life just as Jeongyeon had promised. Just as if I had never loved at all.</p><p>\u201cI am the car racing toward distant shores\u2026\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d be able to <i>step </i>get rid of the pain <i>step </i>that HE caused! <i>Step</i></p><p><i>\u201cPart of the human heart\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>He was right there. Yoongi hadn\u2019t noticed me yet. I had to do it now.</p><p>\u201cNow his life is forever mine\u2026\u201d</p><p>I raised the knife to sink between his shoulder blades.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>And I dropped it, \u201c<i>I can\u2019t!</i>\u201d</p><p>People gasped and Yoongi turned with wide eyes to see me kneeling on the floor with tears streaming down my face. He stared at the knife. No matter how much he had hurt me by keeping the truth about his marriage a secret\u2026</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u2026I <i>love </i>you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cYou tried to <i>kill </i>me!\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>And so you were cast out of the Hotel Holly, your dress and chest being thrown into the sandy dirt. The gates slammed shut behind you.</p><p>Your eyes saw a couple on the other side you called out to them, \u201cI am Miss (Y/N). I am the Mistress of Min Yoongi!\u201d</p><p>If that was the only thing you could be to him, then you\u2019d wear the title. As long as you could be near him. The couple ignored you. A man passed by who recognized you.</p><p>He held your hand through the iron bars as you said, \u201cI was the one who danced at the ball!\u201d</p><p>You wore a beautiful (and clean) dress.</p><p>\u201cThe people applauded!<i> All eyes were on me!!!!</i>\u201d</p><p>He ran off at your outburst. Another Sacred Bone came passed.</p><p>\u201cThe Gods sent me! They sent me be with him!\u201d</p><p>And another.</p><p>\u201cYoongi needs me! He loves me!\u201d</p><p>It was his father who scoffed.</p><p>\u201cWithout me, he\u2019ll die!\u201d You spouted old phrases, ones you had used to get here in the first place.</p><p>It was still the truth still! Right? Even though you had healed him. Almost tried to kill him by literally stabbing him in the back.</p><p>\u201cSurely\u2026surely there has been a terrible mistake.\u201d You said to yourself as the sun started to tint the sky pink. \u201cHe must be wondering where I am.\u201d</p><p>Fruitlessly, you called to the couple you saw before as they were now returning to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cTell him\u2026tell him I am here. Tell him (Y/N) is waiting for him at the gate!\u201d</p><p>And so you did. For two weeks you did wait at the gate. Not sleeping. Not eating. Only waiting. Only watching as the grounds were made even more beautiful in preparation for the wedding. Even as Yoongi as Jamie were getting married.</p><p>As superstition dictated, they came to the gates of the Hotel to throw coins to the peasants thus assuring that their own fortunes would multiply. He was there with her dressed in white. You tried reaching out and waving to him, but he did not see.</p><p>Until you called his name, throat dry from having no water for a while, \u201cYoongi!\u201d</p><p>His eyes finally met yours as Jamie walked away. Yoongi approached you and held your hands. Through the gate, he gave you coins since you had none. You hadn\u2019t tried to get any. There was forgiveness in his eyes. He still loved you? But you didn\u2019t want coins. You wanted him! Your beautiful love kissed the tops of both your hands.</p><p>\u201cYoongi~?\u201d Jamie called from a distance, not knowing when he left her side.</p><p>He gave you one more look and then went back to his wife. You let the gold coin fall, heart completely broken. You laid on the ground and died. Your mother finding you too late. She had come just to try and pay you a visit.</p><p>Eomma Taeyong held your body and mourned, \u201cOh, (Y/N). Oh, (Y/N). You will always be a part of us. Oh, (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>Your father and the towns people took your body home as your soul rose out of it. Everyone mourned the loss of the girl with big dreams. Who they had raised. Who they had loved and still did to be honest.</p><p>\u201cYou will always be a part of us. Oh, (Y/N)\u2026Oooh\u2026\u201d They hummed as they set you down and buried your body.</p><p>And the gods began to cry tears of compassion for the orphan (Y/N) who proved that love could withstand the storm and cross the earth and survive even in the face of death. Jimin took you by the hand and led you to the sea where Key wrapped you in a wave and laid you to your rest. Jeongyeon was gentle as she carried you to shore, and Ros\u00e9 accepted you and held you to her breast.</p><p>And then, the gods blessed you, and transformed you into\u2026A tree!</p><p>A tree that sprang up and cracked the walls of the Hotel Holly, so that its gates could never close again. A tree that lived forever, sheltering peasants and Sacred Bone alike. A tree that watched over Yoongi for his lifetime\u2026in which his children played.</p><p>And one day, as Yoongi\u2019s young son sat in the shade of the tree, he noticed a beautiful young peasant girl high in its branches, looking out at the world. And the spirit of (Y/N) touched their hearts and set them free\u2026to love!</p><p>People sang about your legacy.</p><p>A man with strong arms touched the tree to feel your spirit, \u201cAnd she stands against the lightning and the thunder. And she shelters and protects us from above.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she fills us with the power and the wonder.\u201d Said a Sacred Bone who had come to visit.</p><p>\u201cOf her love\u2026\u201d Yoongi\u2019s son with a bunny smile commented while holding his crush\u2019s hand.</p><p>And this is why we tell the story. Why we tell the story. Why we tell the story.</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon touched the tree, \u201cIf you listen very hard you\u2019ll hear her call us\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo come share with her our laughter and our tears.\u201d Appa Shindong put his arm around her.</p><p>And as mysteries and miracles befall us through the years, we tell the story! We tell the story!</p><p>\u201cLife is why we tell the story!\u201d Ros\u00e9 said.</p><p>\u201cPain is why we tell the story!\u201d Jeongyeon added holding her hand.</p><p>\u201cLove is why we tell the story!\u201d Jimin claimed.</p><p>\u201cGrief is why we tell the story!\u201d Key suggested while messing up Jimin\u2019s hair.</p><p>A villager with a pink tank top agreed, but also said, \u201cHope is why we tell the story!\u201d</p><p>Another with wide hips added, \u201cFaith is why we tell the story!\u201d</p><p>Then everyone looked at the little girl, \u201cYou are whyyyyyy Why we tell the story. Why-y we tell the story~Why we tell the story. Why-y we tell the story!\u201d While dancing a new dance.<br><br>Jimin tapped the little girl\u2019s nose, \u201cSo I hope that you will tell this tale tomorrow. It will help your heart remember and relive.\u201d</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon grinned, \u201cIt will help you feel the anger and the sorrow\u2026\u201d and turned the girl towards the tree.</p><p>Where you floated down from the branches, \u201cAnd forgive\u2026\u201d</p><p>You kissed her forehead and pet her head while everyone including you sand, \u201cFor out of what we live and we believe, our lives become the stories that we weave.\u201d</p><p>Everyone got around the girl who began to speak and you returned to your tree, \u201cThere is an island where rivers run deep\u2026 Where the sea sparkling in the sun earns it the name \u2018Jewel of the Antilles\u2019 An island where the poorest of peasants labor\u2026 And the wealthiest of Sacred Bone play. And on this island, we tell the story!\u201d</p><p>We told the story~<br></p><hr><p>Thank you for reading! What musical would you like to see k-popified next?</p>",

Two different worlds on one island! The Sacred Bone, with their pale skins and their American ways, owners of the land and masters of their own fates. And the peasants, tan as sand and black as night, eternally at the mercy of the wind and the sea\u2026Who pray constantly\u2026 to the gods.</p><p>On this new day, they said the usual prayers of a villager, \u201cRos\u00e9, grow me a garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease Kibum, don\u2019t flood my garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJiminie, who will my love be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeongyeon, <i>don\u2019t</i> come around me!\u201d</p><p>An older but spry older woman laughed and grabbed a visitor\u2019s hand, \u201cAh ha ha ha!

Many huts washed away, many peasants drowned by Kibum\u2019s angry waters.</p><p>I was a child, walking home from the store in my hand me down red dress. The basket I was carrying was heavy enough to make my small body lean back in order to keep the groceries off the ground. Still, a lose grape fell onto the sandy dirt. I set the basket down to chase after it, and a small wave of water brought it back to me. Strange, I thought as I picked up the purple orb, water wasn\u2019t usually this close to the market. There was a lot more and coming right at me!</p><p>I rushed back to the basket, but before I knew it, my body had been swept up by the waves and my foods taken hostage by the misplaced sea. My mother had been in front of me with her own basket, calling my name. Now she screamed it as I was taken way too far away for me to ever here it being called again. Villagers of all sorts hurriedly packed up and grabbed their own children, racing for higher ground. Some sort of safety.</p><p>A panel of roofing came my way, and I grabbed it. When I was knocked off of it, I felt as though an orphan plucked from the flood by Kibum, sheltered in a tree by Ros\u00e9. And little did I know I\u2019d be sent on a journey by the gods. A journey that would test the strength of love against the power of <b>death</b>. On this island of two different worlds!</p><p>The story of (Y/N)!</p><p>I was just one small girl in a tree, torn from her mother. Crying in fright. One small girl tossed by sea and left to face the stormy night. I was one small girl. Holding tight\u2026At last, the storm subsided and the morning sun glowed when two old peasants came cautiously down the road.</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon and Appa Shindong.</p><p>Taeyeon picked up a flower and tucked it in her hair, \u201cRos\u00e9 is smiling again, Shindong.\u201d</p><p>He was being grumpy, \u201cThis morning, she smiles. Last night, she tried to blow our heads off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHahahaha! Ah, Julian, just listen to those birds!\u201d</p><p>Coo coo coo coo coo. Coo coo coo coo coo.</p><p><i>Waah!!!</i> Sounded from up in a tree.<br><br>\u201cWhat kind of bird is that?\u201d Shindong asked.</p><p>His wife pointed to the tree, at me, \u201cLook! There! One small face, two small knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d When I gave no reply, she looked to her husband. \u201cThe girl can\u2019t speak.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the skies, \u201cAnd they\u2019re to blame. Kibum probably meant to kill her!\u201d</p><p>Taeyeon rolled her eyes, \u201cThen she\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible he forgot.\u201d</p><p>She looked around frightened the gods might be listening, \u201cShh! The gods don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they had some reason to spare her life. It\u2019s best that we don\u2019t know what.\u201d</p><p>His wife agreed even though she looked back at the child, \u201cOne small girl\u2026better not.\u201d</p><p>They shook their heads and started to go, but then something magical came over them. That child needed someplace to live.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re too old for children.\u201d He tried to reason to himself.</p><p>She did the same, \u201cAnd we have no room and no food.\u201d</p><p>But I\u2013the quiet girl in the tree\u2013or something else, touched them deep inside. So not knowing quite why, they followed their hearts back to the tree, gently lifted the terrified child down\u2026</p><p>I screamed, \u201cNOOOOO!!!!\u201d</p><p><br>And discovered I could speak after all. Now I had become one small girl in the way.Constantly hungry. They said I was learning too quick! Maybe because I was only about 6 when I learned how to climb to the top of the tallest palm tree without any help.</p><p>\u201cShe makes me smile.\u201d Appa Shindong said when he saw where I was and pointed it out to Eomma.</p><p>\u201cShe scares me sick!\u201d and she went pale at the sight of me so high. She clutched her heart and ordered the coconut gatherers to help me down.</p><p>But I lept right into my mother\u2019s arms from what didn\u2019t seem like a fifteen foot tree at the time. So they scolded and teased and held me. Ad mended the clothes I tore. The hut was crowded, and food was scarce. Yet somehow, their lives held more. They had one small girl to live for.</p><p>Because I had no idea of what my life was like or what my name was before the flood, they named me \u201cDesire\u0301e Dieu-Donne\u0301,\u201d or \u201cGod-Given Desire.\u201d But in their affection, they called me simply (Y/N).</p><p>I recall a time when I was around the age of 8 and my curious nature came into play, so I asked, \u201cWhat does (Y/N) mean, Eomma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means Little Orphan.\u201d She tapped my nose. \u201cYou\u2019re our sweet little orphan. We found you, and now your life is forever in our care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Appa answered, \u201cBecause the gods willed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>My mother shrugged, \u201cPerhaps they saved you for something special.\u201d</p><p>That simple answer made my eyes light up and I jumped up and down, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), if we knew why the gods did the things they do, we would be gods ourselves!\u201d</p><p>I puffed up my cheeks cutely, \u201cSomeday I\u2019m going to ask them, Eomma!\u201d</p><p>Both my parents giggled, and she ruffled my hair, \u201cFoolish girl! Run and hide!\u201d</p><p>Growing up, I was called both sweet as a eucalyptus and terrible as a tempest while I was banging a drum and humming a tune. I was (Y/N) and did what children did. Falling and running and calling and growing\u2026and growing and growing and growing up too soon.</p><p>Ten years had passed and I had grown into a beautiful young woman. Sturdy from living a peasant\u2019s life and yet gentle with innocence claiming my heart. I folded the now dried blanket after taking it off the line, but soon slipped away to sit in a tree, allowing my mind to wander.<br><br>I was now one small girl that wasn\u2019t so small. Lost in my daydreams day after day.</p><p>\u201cCall her name.\u201d Appa Shindong said.</p><p>But Eomma Taeyeon replied, \u201cNo, don\u2019t call. Her ears don\u2019t hear, she\u2019s far away.\u201d</p><p>My parents watched from the distance, talking among themselves after my mother finished my folding for me.</p><p>He agreed, \u201cAnd I know that she\u2019s getting older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that it\u2019s meant to be.\u201d</p><p>Their arms couldn\u2019t hold me and keep me small, but all l that their hearts could see was one small girl. One small girl. Just one small girl in a tree.</p><p>The two then grabbed a few things before going to market. On their way, a car was speeding past and almost ran them over. No honking either, to warn pedestrians to get out of the way. The life of privilege wreaked of the silver mercedes. A few yelps of terror turned my attention to a stranger in white in a car. Going somewhere. Going far.</p><p>I wondered what it would be like to have a life like his.</p><p><i>How it must feel to go racing wherever you please, flying as free as a bird with his tail in the breeze.</i> I thought even the fish in the sea must be longing to fly after catching a glimpse of a stranger in white racing by.<br><br>\u201cOh, gods. Oh, gods, are you there?\u201d You asked aloud. \u201cWhat can I do to get you to look down and give in? Oh, gods. Oh, gods, hear my prayer!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m here in the field with my feet on the ground and my fate in the air waiting for life to begin! I knew that Eomma\u2019s contented and Appa accepts what he gets. They were happy for tea in their cups and no holes in their nets. Happy to have what they have and to stay where they are, they never even looked up at the sound of a car.</p><p>A stranger racing down the beach. Racing to places I was meant to reach! My imagination took a step further and imagined him there in the middle of the drum circle. I joined him and swung my hips to the rhythm. Then I imagined his car would stop and in I\u2019d hop and off we\u2019d drive!</p><p>We\u2019ll drive~! I turned around and he was gone.</p><p>I sighed and saw the setting sun. Had it already gotten this late? It was about time to go home. Before I did, I called for the Gods like I had been taught since I was little. I used my whole heart and my entire body.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods. Oh, gods. Please be there. Don\u2019t you remember your little (Y/N) from the tree?\u201d I even tried commanding them to see if I would get a sign. \u201cWake up! Look down! Hear my prayer! Don\u2019t single me out And then forget me! Oh, gods. Oh, gods, let me fly!\u201d I spread my arms like wings. \u201cSend me to places where no one before me has been. You spared my life; show me why. You get me to rise like a fish to the bait then tell me to wait. Well, I\u2019m waiting!\u201d I called to the heavens.</p><p>Waiting for life to begin!</p><hr><p><i>And the gods heard her prayer.</i> Had a good laugh about it too.<br></p><p>Ros\u00e9 fanned herself, \u201cThe peasant girl wants a grand homme to carry her away! I should find a tree all covered with mangos\u2013juicy mangos, fat and well-fed. Pick a mango\u2014\u201d She took the one she just made from the tree.</p><p>Kibum took it from her, \u201cA juicy mango.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lovely mango.\u201d Jimin added before the mango was taken from him.</p><p>It was by Jeongyeon who said, \u201cA poison mango\u2014\u201d</p><p>But everyone scowled at her. She just shrugged it away. As a demon of death, it was her job to kill people. Poison did that. Anyways, Ros\u00e9 dropped the mango. It made a whistling sound as it fell from the heavens. Then boom!</p><p>\u201cTo knock some sense in her head!\u201d</p><p>They laughed and repeated, \u201cKnock some sense in her head!\u201d</p><p>Kibum offered to, \u201cSplash her with a wave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cScare her half to death!\u201d Jeongyeon lurched forward.</p><p>But Jimin saw how honest her prayer was, so he said, \u201cGive her what she wants!\u201d</p><p>Ros\u00e9, Kibum, and Jeongyeon looked at him, confused, \u201cGive her what she\u2026?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cGive her what she wants. Love has many powers. If the love is true, It can cross the earth, and withstand the storm. It can conquer\u2013\u201d Jimin poked in Jeongyeon\u2019s direction. \u201cEven you.\u201d</p><p>The gods of earth and water decided to walk away and give the two their space to talk, mostly because neither of them wanted to be put at odds with Death herself.</p><p>She scoffed, \u201cLove conquer death? Why, I could stop her heart like that!\u201d She snapped her fingers with a quickness.</p><p>Jimin smirked, \u201cStop her heart from beating, yes. But not from loving. Not if love is what she chooses.\u201d</p><p>Jeongyeon shook her head dismissively, \u201cRidiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting!\u201d Key piped up.</p><p>Ros\u00e9 nodded, \u201cMore amusing than mangos!\u201d</p><p>They came to a decision, \u201cA journey!\u201d</p><p>Jimin reached out to (Y/N), \u201cI will give her strength when the time is right.\u201d</p><p>Mother nature followed suit, \u201cI will guide her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will make her choose!\u201d A wicked grin spread across Death\u2019s face.</p><p>Kibum, already flowing down to Earth, said, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll provide the place where two different worlds will meet tonight!\u201d</p><p>Tonight!<br><br>God of water Kibum smeared his arm across the sky, \u201cLet there be no moon. Let the clouds race by. Where the road meets the sea, let the tide be high.\u201d And his head turned as he saw the girl about to return home. \u201cLet there be a girl\u2026\u201d He drew her back to the beach. \u201cWalking by the sea, and let there be rain!\u201d</p><p>A small trickle began as Key continued to command his part of nature, \u201cListen to her prayers, full of hope and pain as she stares down the road in the pouring rain.\u201d It quickly picked up.</p><p>She should\u2019ve been home by now or trying to get there more quickly, but instead she stood transfixed in the middle of the empty road. There was rain on the road. Rain on her face. Rain makes a road such a dangerous place.</p><p>He smiled to himself as the other player came near, \u201cLet there be a car racing through the night where the road meets the sea. Let her wait where the road meets the sea. Let him spin where the road meets the sea. Let their fate begin~ in the\u2026Raaaaaiiiinnnin!\u201d He bellowed and thunder clapped.</p><p>Kibum was gone as soon as he came, leaving an unsupervised driver swerve when he saw big brown eyes and a red dress in the middle of the street. He quickly ran into a tree which Ros\u00e9 made sure was unharmed in all of this.</p><hr><p>I heard the screech of wheels and metal bending. Saw lights brighter than the moon and then nothing. I went to him and screamed at the top of my lungs.</p><p>\u201cHelp! Someone! Come quickly! A car has crashed!\u201d I held him in my arms. \u201cA boy is hurt! Help me, someone! Where is everyone?\u201d</p><p>Not a soul was coming near. It was if we weren\u2019t on the sandy beach at all, but somewhere else where only the two of us existed.</p><p>\u201cHello? Can you hear me?\u201d I asked.</p><p><i>His skin is so pale</i>, I think.</p><p>\u201cCan you see me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened for a moment. They were eyes from another world. Gray as the sky.</p><p>I spoke to whoever heard, \u201cOh, gods. Oh, gods, you saved my life for a reason. And now, I think I know why!\u201d</p><p>A man\u2019s voice made me jump, \u201cHe roared down the road like the devil himself\u2026\u201d</p><p>More people started to gather.</p><p>\u201cGoing too fast around the curves!\u201d A thick woman added.</p><p>\u201cSent us scrambling off the road like chickens\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has what he deserves!\u201d</p><p>No, what? He didn\u2019t deserve this! He was too kind.</p><p>A beautiful woman squaked, \u201cJeongyeon wants him\u2026\u201d</p><p>The man she was with finished, \u201cAnd Jeongyeon will have him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy is dying before our eyes!\u201d one of the men before spoke up again.</p><p>\u201cHelp him!\u201d Mom said.</p><p>\u201cHide him!\u201d One of her friends said right after.</p><p>Appa interrupted, \u201cNoooo! Don\u2019t touch him! Better leave him where he lies. Even a wealthy man sometimes dies.\u201d</p><p>How could he? I spoke up, \u201cPlease! He needs help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this boy dies in our hands, the rich will send police.\u201d He stated.</p><p>\u201cHe needs care!\u201d</p><p>Eomma agreed, \u201cAnd if he lives, oh, how angry the gods will be!\u201d</p><p>Everyone around me seemed to have the same idea, \u201cThe only thing that will save the boy\u2019s life is to send him back to his world!\u201d</p><p>I knew I was being stubborn, but I had to be, \u201cThe only thing that will save the boy\u2019s life\u2026 is me!\u201d</p><p>All the villagers stared in disbelief, finally silent and still even as rain covered us head to toe.</p><p>So I continued, \u201cI have prayed to the gods and at last they\u2019ve answered. They saved my life so that I could save his. My heart knows this.\u201d My eyes looked at my father. \u201cPlease, Appa.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cI will find where he comes from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShindong! No!\u201d Eomma Taeyeon held his arm tightly.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI will find who he is, and soon! But \u2019til I return, you care for him, (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>And, after he bid his wife and daughter goodbye, Shindong set off down the road, toward the Black Mountains. The peasants carried the boy to the village, and laid him on my mat. And so my long vigil began\u2026</p><p>One day gone by like it was nothing, just making sure he was dried off as much as possible with rain pelting the windows. And two days gone by without him opening his eyes at all. People would stop by just to whisper about the whole situation.</p><p>They would say things such as, \u201cThe boy has the will of the devil himself, clinging to life by one small thread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Julian\u2019s daughter, he\u2019d certainly be dead!\u201d</p><p>Even when I was just doing the most simple of things to make sure he was being taken care of properly, they\u2019d whisper and gossip as if they weren\u2019t standing outside of my hut. As if I couldn\u2019t hear them. I did, but I was too focused on trying to save this boy\u2019s life to care about any of it.</p><p>It was two women chirping back and forth, \u201cLook how she bathes him\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd touches and protects him.\u201d</p><p>Two men were by their sides, \u201cShe binds his wounds and she rubs his chest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if the girl\u2019s possessed!\u201d</p><p>My mother worried for me as I looked through every book and was alarmed by every cough, \u201cYou need food. You need sleep. You just can\u2019t go on without any sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEomma, sssh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave some tea.\u201d She offered.</p><p>I felt his arm, \u201cHis skin is hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a rest.\u201d She had even set out another mat for me in the corner.</p><p>\u201cHe needs me here.\u201d</p><p>I was tired of her trying to convince me away from him, so I went to yell at her but we ended up talking over each other, \u201cCan\u2019t you see how much this matters to me? I know what\u2019s best!\u201d</p><p>Eomma was shocked at my words, but that didn\u2019t stop her from sticking around me as I tried a new healing techniques. Now the sky was growing dim and the clouds are racing by. The gods are looking down at a boy they meant to die and a girl who placed herself in their way\u2026 So they prayed.</p><p>Three days gone by and my stomach was still empty other than what slithered down when I chewed up herbs and leaves and turned them into a fine paste. And four days gone by without one wink of sleep. I don\u2019t know if I even blinked when keeping my eye on him.</p><p>Two brothers and their sister came to watch me work today.</p><p>The oldest spoke first, \u201cI fear for the girl and her mother, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing but trouble looms ahead.\u201d Their sister agreed.</p><p>\u201cMister Shindong could be deep in danger.\u201d The youngest spoke.</p><p>Their sister spoke again, \u201cArrested, lost or dead!\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>In the forest on the edge of the mountains, Shindong held a lit lamp and looked around with worry in his heart. He paused for a second and got on his knees.</p><p>\u201cRos\u00e9, mother of the earth, guide the feet of this poor peasant man. Hear my prayer. Which way there\u2026and which way home?\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>I called to my mom, \u201cI need herbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father gone\u2013\u201d She replied.</p><p>\u201cEomma, herbs!\u201d I didn\u2019t have time for her nagging.</p><p>My mother was upset, \u201cAnd you don\u2019t care. Oh, my god what has this boy done to you?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her hands, \u201cMam\u2026sssh!\u201d and went back to the boy. \u201cHe needs rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour appa lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs care\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pointed in my direction, \u201cBecause of <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>We spoke over each other once more, \u201cCan\u2019t you see that he\u2019s in terrible danger? What must I do?\u201d</p><p>Now the sky is turning dark, and the wind is turning chill. The gods are out for blood. They\u2019ve been cheated of their kill by a girl without the sense to obey\u2026so they prayed. They moved their feet together in order to ward off evil because once it got in it probably wouldn\u2019t leave with just a single casualty.</p><p>Everytime death came near, I\u2019d use water and flame. Herbs and prayer to keep him alive. I didn\u2019t even know his name, but I went without sleeping for many days to have the hope of knowing it from his own lips.<br><br>\u201cYeobo! Where is my yeobo! Bring my Shindong home!\u201d Taeyeon wailed.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>At that same time, Shindong had made it to the gates but was confronted by the gatekeepers. He begged for entry.</p><p>\u201cYou want what?\u201d The keeper scoffed.</p><p>The chubby man replied, \u201cI\u2019ve come so far and I need\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some news for Kim-nim\u2013\u201d</p><p>The guard warned again, \u201c<i>Get back!</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cMin Seonsaeng-nim has a\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeasant pig!\u201d He slapped the man for his insolence.</p><p>Now on the ground, Appa Shindong said, \u201cPlease, I beg!\u201d</p><p>The guard was surprised, \u201cYou must be mad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must see Seonsaeng-nim\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cMin Seonsaeng-nim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have come so far\u2013\u201d He tried to get up but was stopped by the barrel of a gun.</p><p>\u201cSo far to die!\u201d</p><p>His eyes caught a missing poster with the image of the boy from the crash and pointed desperately, \u201cI have found his son!\u201d</p><p>That caught their attention and so the guard helped him up, a bit suspicious but he wasn\u2019t the one with a life to lose if this man was lying.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Now the sky has turned to black and the wind is like a knife. Jeongyeon is coming back for the boy who clings to life and the girl will have the gods to repay\u2026</p><p>They prayed with their whole bodies, \u201cJeongyeon, don\u2019t come around me! Jeongyeon, don\u2019t come around me! Jeongyeon, don\u2019t come around me! Jeongyeon, don\u2019t come around me!\u201d</p><p>Some say it was the worst storm the Gods had ever sent. Peasants prayed that they\u2019d live to see the morning, but what of (Y/N)? </p><p>What of me? Well, some say I had gone without sleep for so long that my mind wandered further into my dreams. I had no wind nor rain, only my beating heart of this pale dying boy.</p><p>I even sang to him as comfort, \u201cSure as a wave needs to be near the shore. You are the one I was intended for. Deep in your eyes, I saw the gods\u2019 design. Now my life is forever yours.\u201d I smiled. \u201cAnd you are mine.\u201d</p><p>I changed his bandages and sang, \u201cI am a tree holding away the storm. Here in my arms, I\u2019ll keep you safe and warm. Even the gods won\u2019t dare to cross this line where my life is forever yours, and you are mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are mine,\u201d came his voice from the doorway.</p><p>I knew he\u2019d be ok because of me!</p><p>Our hearts sang together, \u201cMine\u2026We\u2019ll race away in a car as silver as the moon, and the storm will turn to sun on an island where the earth and sea are one. Sure as this night leads to a sky of blue. Sure as my heart led me to be with you.\u201d He leaned his forehead on my own. \u201cSurely the gods meant this to be a sign that my life is forever yours and you are\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiiiiiine! MIIIINNEE!\u201d It was, Jeongyeon. There was no mistaking it.</p><p>Where was my boy?</p><p>She stood above him and grinned the darkest grin I had ever seen, \u201cArrogant fool. Think you can hold back death?\u201d</p><p>Death herself came before me, but I wouldn\u2019t let her ruin this, \u201cStay away!\u201d I was shaking but stood firm.</p><p>Jeongyeon shoved me back without even touching me, \u201cThis boy is mine. I am his dying breath!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you have him!\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cSure as the grave, you must accept what is! Now his life is forever mine~\u201d</p><p>It was if death was pulling his soul from out of his body. It raised with her motion. I had to do something! Something now!</p><p>\u201cTake mine for his!\u201d I blurted.</p><p>She looked at me with shock, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>With more conviction, I repeated, \u201cTake my life. My soul\u2026 for his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the road leading to no return.\u201d Jeongyeon warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d I glared at her.</p><p>She returned it tenfold, \u201cSecret of life nobody wants to learn\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would die for him!\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>\u201cI am the car racing toward distant shores.\u201d</p><p>My eyes were on him, not death, \u201cNow his life is forever mine\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jeongyeon pulled my attention back and pulled my soul into her grasp as well, \u201cYour life is forever mine\u2026\u201d</p><p>It was excruciatingly painful, but as soon as it was over, I looked back at the boy whose life I was saving, \u201cAnd I am yours\u2026\u201d</p><p>Our fates were sealed. Death left humming to herself followed by a laugh like the cracking of bones.</p><hr><p>The next day I realized I had finally gone to sleep after staying up to protect my boy. I don\u2019t know how long but I awoke to pale muscles holding me as they took him away! They gave me to my worried parents as they took him to a truck and laid him in the back still on top of my mat!<br></p><p>\u201cNo, stop!\u201d I called. \u201cYou can\u2019t take him! Give him back!\u201d My arms flailed and failed to reach his still unconscious form.</p><p>He was getting better! The Gods\u2013why was he taken from me?</p><p>My father\u2019s grip was firm, \u201cNow the Gods are happy! He is there in his world and you are here in ours! Everything is as it should be (Y/N)!\u201d he looked me dead in the eyes. \u201cThere can never be anything between a peasant and a Sacred Bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppa, he needs me!\u201d My gaze held strong. \u201cWithout me\u2026he\u2019ll die!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet the Gods decide his fate!\u201d My mother said. \u201cWhat can a peasant like you do for someone like him but shine his shoes?!\u201d</p><p>I went to her and held her hands, \u201cHis ancestors one loved a peasant girl.\u201d</p><p>I had heard the villagers gossiping about his heritage all while I did my best to heal him. His family cursed to stay on this island while their hearts forever yearned for their homeland.</p><p>\u201cThis time a Sacred Bone will marry one. I know it!\u201d I made eye contact with both my parents. The ones who raised me. \u201cI am in his blood and he is in mine.\u201d</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon\u2019s face fell, crumbled, \u201cMarry you?\u201d She held my face in her hands. \u201cYou are mad. He will not marry you, (Y/N)!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must go to him.\u201d I said, not a shred of doubt in my heart. </p><p>I took Eomma\u2019s hands from my face and backed away from her. How could they not believe me? It wasn\u2019t as if it were some random thing! It was my hearts! It was the Gods! I loved him and we were meant to be together!</p><p>\u201cI must go to him! His heart beats for me like a drum. The gods are dancing for me, Eomma!\u201d I said. \u201cPlease, Eomma. Please, Appa.\u201d I begged them with my whole heart. \u201cGive me your blessing and let me go.\u201d</p><p>They said nothing with their mouths, but spoke to one another with their eyes. I knew my answer! Why didn\u2019t they know theirs?</p><p>Stubborn words came out of my mouth, \u201c I will go!\u201d</p><p>My mom sighed and tucked her hair behind her ear, \u201cWhat can I say to stop you now now that you\u2019ve heard your drums and seen your dancers? Now that you think your heart has all the answers?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were filled with sorrow as she looked at me, \u201cWho knows how high those mountains climb? Who knows how deep those rivers flow? Who knows how wrong a dream can go, (Y/N)?\u201d</p><p>Appa Shindong gently touched my arm, \u201cI won\u2019t be there to guide your way\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo braid your hair or dry your tears\u2026\u201d Eomma added. \u201cAs we have done these many years, (Y/N). (Y/N)\u2026\u201d</p><p>My father had me sit, \u201cWhat you are, we made you. What we gave, you took. Now you run without one backward look.\u201d</p><p>Mother smoothed my hair, \u201cYou\u2019ll find some other boy to save. Some other life that you can share. Your heart is young; new dreams are everywhere. Choose your dreams with care, (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I <i>have </i>chosen. And my dreams are there, down <i>that </i>road!\u201d I stood and pointed out the window.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a child, (Y/N)!\u201d Appa bellowed. \u201cThe road is hard and dangerous. The city is miles away. And even if you get there, even if you get to the Hotel Holly, you will never get through the gate!\u201d</p><p>His voice was anger and confusion and heavy with pleading. Why was he so worried? </p><p>\u201cI will get there, Appa. I will get through the gate. I\u2019m not a child any longer!\u201d I knew their words but felt so different about them. \u201cWhat I am, you made me. What you gave, I owe. But if I look back, I\u2019ll never go. Who knows how high those mountains climb?\u201d</p><p>I gazed out the window, \u201cWho knows how deep those rivers flow?\u201d and then turned my attention back to them. \u201cI know he\u2019s there. That\u2019s all I need to know\u2026\u201d</p><p>As they always did when things were rough, they hid their tears even though their aged faces showed everything they were feeling. I couldn\u2019t just give up, though. He was my fate! Us being together was destiny. I didn\u2019t argue with it, so why\u2013</p><p>\u201cGo and find your love.\u201d Appa Shindong said.</p><p>Eomma nodded and placed her necklace around my neck, \u201cGo and swim the sea.\u201d</p><p>Together, they assured me, \u201cYou know where we\u2019ll be\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways there with me\u2026\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026\u201d they hugged me tightly.</p><p>So I set off into the world with everything looking so bright and new! It was scary\u2026just a little bit. Ok, maybe a lot of bit. I had nowhere\u2026no idea where I was going. But on this island, the earth sings as soon as the storm ends. And as my feet set out, I realized I was walking with old friends.</p><p>The birds\u2026The trees\u2026The frogs\u2026And the breezes\u2026 That\u2019s when I lost all my fear. I knew Ros\u00e9 was near! She appeared out of nowhere and had a huge smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been away from the sea, child. You\u2019re gonna need a helping hand. A fish has got to learn to swim on land!\u201d She motioned me towards her. \u201cWalk with me, little girl. Don\u2019t you be afraid. Follow me, little girl, let me be your guide. A pretty thing like you will need a thing or two\u201d</p><p>She booped my nose and I giggled.</p><p>\u201cAnd whatever you need. Mama will provide. Ohhhhh! Down the road, little girl, you may lose your way. All alone in a world that may seem too wide.\u201d</p><p>The red haired goddess sat on an upturned boat and tapped her skirt to motion for me to place myself there, \u201cBut sit on mama\u2019s lap, and I will draw a map, and whatever you need Mama will provide!\u201d</p><p>She sat up and twirled me in all sorts of ways. It was as if the earth itself was speaking to me and bending to her will.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll provide you moss to soften the road! Rocks to sit on! Trees to sleep underneath! Sand, fun for your toes! Plantain to fill up your belly!\u201d And the wind danced through my hair as she sang to me. \u201cBreeze to fan your face! Grass for making your bed!\u201d</p><p>I pointed at a blood sucking little fella that kept buzzing around me, \u201cMosquitoes?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cHa!\u201d</p><p>I tried to clap it between my hands, but it must\u2019ve flown away as my hands were free of any squashed bug bits.</p><p>\u201cBugs will bite, little girl and the night will fall. All alone in the dark, you\u2019ll be terrified. But you will make it through \u2018cause I am liking you!\u201d She spun me around once more. \u201cAnd whatever you need Mama will provide!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama will provide\u2026Mama will provide\u2026Mama will provide\u2026\u201d The forest sang as my footsteps became more sure.</p><p>Ros\u00e9 belted into my ear, \u201cOh\u2026!\u201d and giggled at my startled reaction. \u201cWalk with me, little girl and I\u2019ll take you far! \u2018Round each bend, little friend, I\u2019ll be by your side. That\u2019s what Mama\u2019s worth, to give her child the earth, and whatever you need, mama will\u2026\u201d She took a deep breath as the plants twirled and prepared themselves for another belting moment. \u201cPROVIIIIIIIIIDDEEE!\u201d</p><p>I embraced her and with a wave of Ros\u00e9\u2019s fan, a clear path came before me. She motioned me on and off I went.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Some say\u2026How you began your long journey toward the city! Some say your feet were bare and the road was long and cruel Some say you got a ride from a vendor and his mule. Some say the gods pulled up in a car and drove you all the way. Well, no one knows how the real truth goes, but that\u2019s what some say!</p><p>Some might wonder how far did she travel. The answer is as far as they suppose. And how long did it take you? Much longer than their nose! And were you ever frightened or was your love too strong? And did you know she\u2019d end up in a story and a song?</p><p>What happened when (Y/N) finally reached the city? Some say they laughed at you for your peasant feet were bare. Some say that vendor man gave you shoes too small to wear. Some say\u2026the gods said, \u201cPut on the shoes! It\u2019s the price you have to pay!\u201d</p><p>The shoes were tight, but you said, \u201cAlright!\u201d</p><p>Well, that\u2019s what some say! Some say that at last (still wearing her painful new city shoes) you arrived at the gates of the Hotel Holly. But the fierce guard saw you had nothing to sell to the tourists.</p><p>\u201cSTOP!\u201d They yelled.</p><p>But you must have smiled your most beautiful smile. And Jimin must have touched the fierce guard on the shoulder, for he nodded and some say the gate swung open and you entered and went in search of your Yoongi. Some say you scrubbed the floors \u2018til you learned where he was kept. Some say you climbed a vine to the window where he slept. While some say the gods just lifted you up and placed you where he lay.</p><p>Well, no one knows how the real truth goes. It all depends what you hear from friends. It\u2019s no surprise, if it\u2019s all just lies, but that\u2019s what some say\u2026<br></p><hr><p>I waited until I saw him struggle to get into his bed with his crutches that I came to help him. His eyes opened wide as he put his hand up to stop me and he backed up, frightened.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in here? It isn\u2019t allowed!\u201d</p><p>I spoke up, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember me? It\u2019s (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out before I call a guard.\u201d He hissed.</p><p>My body moved on its own, closer to him, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me? I saved your life.\u201d</p><p>He scuffed, \u201c<i>You </i>saved my life? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Did he really not recall? But the Gods\u2026</p><p>I stood back at the foot of his bed, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi answered with a quick, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me as I swayed nervously. I had come all this way to be with him. I pressed on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who found you crushed inside your car.\u201d My words were gentle but firm. \u201cI watched over you when you nearly died. I bathed you and gave you my mat to lie on.\u201d It was nowhere to be found.</p><p>My dark brown hands smoothed his expensive white bed sheets as they recalled how they cared for his unconscious body for days on end. Still no recollection was to be found behind his coconut colored eyes illuminated by the bedside lamp.</p><p>So I approached him, \u201cI have seen the scar on your chest. It\u2019s like a half moon.\u201d I cupped my hand to match its shape and placed it near his heart where I knew the scar was. \u201cHere~\u201d</p><p>Yoongi blinked, a pout on his lips but finally a memory breaking through, \u201cSo, it was you?\u201d</p><p>I smiled and felt his head though he flinched at my touch, \u201cYes! You\u2019re very ill. You burn like fire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy leg won\u2019t heal.\u201d He motioned to his bandaged calf.</p><p>\u201cThe Gods sent me to make you well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think your peasant superstitions can do what doctors can\u2019t?\u201d He squinted his eyes. \u201cYou, little girl?\u201d</p><p>I took on a semi-scolding tone, \u201cI kept you alive in the face of death! Anyone in my village would tell you so, and I can heal you. Now.\u201d</p><p>Was he really going to keep doubting someone sent by the Gods after defying one of them? His future wife?</p><p>\u201cYou should go home.\u201d Yoongi said.</p><p>I knelt at the side of his bed, our hands only inches apart.</p><p>\u201cBut I came all the way to be with you! Let me stay.\u201d</p><p>He stuck out his chin, \u201cOh? So you can tell me more stories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am telling the truth.\u201d I said simply.</p><p>The black haired man scoffed, \u201cA pretty thing\u2013what\u2013sent by the \u2018gods\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I looked into his eyes, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Min Yoongi just stared at me, slightly taken aback by how serious I was. How could I not be serious when he doubted my very reality so? My people\u2019s song came in on the wind. He seemed to have recalled something else. A puzzled look came across his face.</p><p>Another glance at me, \u201cAlright then\u2026What harm can it do?\u201d He did a sloppy hand flourish towards his leg. \u201cHow me your powers. I\u2019ll pretend to believe them.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me as I sat now on the edge of his bed smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cPerhaps maybe the Gods did send me a gift after all.\u201d</p><p>So I began to work on his ailing parts. I felt a presence but it didn\u2019t interrupt, simply watched as I took care of my soulmate.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Jimin watched from the window, making sure he was known just enough but did not interfere. He wanted to help\u2026move things along since you had worked so hard to get here. His song was like a spell nudging your hearts closer together.</p><p>\u201cOoh, ooh. The courage of a dreamer\u2026The innocence of youth\u2026The failures and the foolishness\u2026That lead us to the truth.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he noticed how happy you were just to be near Yoongi.</p><p>\u201cThe hopes that make us happy. The hopes that don\u2019t come true. And all the love there ever was: I see this all in you.\u201d Because he believed that \u201cYou are part~Part of the human heart.\u201d</p><p>Yes, the way you looked at him and took care of him. There was no doubt in Jimin\u2019s mind that you were part of the human heart. You were part of all who took the journey.</p><p>\u201cAnd managed to endure. The ones who knew such tenderness. The ones who felt so sure. The ones who came before you. The others yet to come, and those who you will teach it to.\u201d His gaze reached to comfort Eomma Taeyeon and Appa Shindong. \u201cAnd those you learned it from.\u201d</p><p>The blonde beauty recognized the change in Yoongi\u2019s eyes as he saw how you worked and got him to hold your hand to bring you closer to him. He continued to work his magic and almost giggled at how shocked you were.</p><p>\u201cYou are part~Part of the human heart. You are part\u2026This is the gift I give through your love you\u2019ll live forever\u2026Forever~ Forever.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi caressed your hair all the way down your cheek and to your chin. You couldn\u2019t help but stare at his chin. Jimin made sure your love\u2019s hand was firmly around your waist.</p><p>\u201cYou are part\u2026Tonight~Tonight~Part of the human heart~~~~\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>And he kissed me. I kissed him back of course. My heart was pounding inside my chest. I knew that he\u2019d love me once he knew the truth, once he accepted it. I could hear the wedding bells already.</p><p>And the night became day. Still Yoongi kept the gentle (Y/N) beside him! The day became a week and still you slept in his room. After two weeks, the gossip began spreading through the walls of the Hotel Holly\u2013even into the city\u2013until everyone had heard that the ailing Min Yoongi had chosen a peasant as a lover. And little~by little~ you were \u201chealing him\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNow, what can he want with a woman like her?\u201d A man asked as he walked with a friend and two women.</p><p>\u201cBlacker than coal and low as dirt!\u201d The woman on his arm added.</p><p>Her friend agreed, \u201cHe could have the world but takes a peasant!\u201d</p><p>The other man smacked his own head, \u201cPerhaps his brain was hurt!\u201d</p><p>Even the servants whispered, \u201cLook how she holds him and touches and attends him. The boy believes she can make him well\u2026and she has him in a spell.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi had been laying with his head on my lap while I caressed his pale face. I tapped his shoulder so that he would stand. I did as well, fiddling with the locket Eomma had given me when I left the village.</p><p>\u201cI have a gift for you.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi grinned, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d tucking his shirt into his pants.</p><p>\u201cA charm.\u201d I kneeled on his bed and took it off. \u201cIf you wear it next to your heart, it will make you whole again.\u201d</p><p>I clasped it around his neck and let my arms rest on his shoulders. He beamed at me with sunlight and affection in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou are my charm.\u201d My love kissed my cheek. \u201cWithout you, I could never be whole again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never leave you, Yoongi.\u201d</p><p>Two women, overdressed for any occasion, commented on the relationship as well.</p><p>The one in green asked, \u201cNow, what do you make of a peasant like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPutting on airs without a doubt!\u201d Her friend in a lighter green replied.</p><p>A man passing by inserted himself in the conversation, \u201cWhen the boy is well and does not need her\u2014\u201d</p><p>The two women joined him in completing his thought, \u201c\u2014How soon he\u2019ll throw her out!\u201d</p><p>Lifting his crutch off the ground, Yoongi spun in a circle, \u201cSoon, I\u2019ll be dancing again!\u201d</p><p>I smiled and caught him before he fell and waited for his crutch to touch the floor once more, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll dance with you! But for now, walk slowly, Yoongi.\u201d</p><p>A spark came alive in his eyes, \u201cThen you must walk even more slowly~\u201d</p><p>With a giggle, I asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can <i>catch </i>you!\u201d He began to playfully chase me with a slight limp ang giggling, so I ran just fast enough to stay out of his grasp.</p><p>His father called out to him, \u201cYoongi-ah!\u201d a paduk board in his grasp.</p><p>He stopped in his tracks, \u201cAbeoji.\u201d</p><p>His cold eyes glared at me, so I made my way back to my love\u2019s room. Part of me was afraid Min Appa would hit me across the head with that board. The other guests turned their heads whenever I met their eyes. Nothing mattered as long as Yoongi love me, which he did.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think you\u2019ll be playing this game?\u201d The older man asked.</p><p>His son shook his head, \u201cThis is no game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you can\u2019t believe it\u2019s real?\u201d He scoffed.</p><p>Yoongi nodded, \u201cI\u2019m in love with (Y/N)!\u201d</p><p>Min Abeoji replied sternly, \u201cYou are not the first to want a peasant. I, too, know their appeal\u2026But you are my son. You\u2019ll do what must be done <i>no matter what you feel</i>!\u201d</p><p>He left his son with sadness in his heart. Yoongi began to go in the direction his love had gone while the guests snickered behind his back. The trio from earlier had seen everything but pretended like they had not by hiding behind fans and newspapers.</p><p>\u201cI know what he sees in a peasant like her\u2026\u201d The man said coming from behind his paper.</p><p>\u201cProbably makes him rise like yeast!\u201d the light green clothed woman commented.</p><p>Servants continued to gossip, \u201cWell, the girl may think she\u2019s very clever. The boy may keep her here forever.\u201d</p><p>However, sacred bone and servants alike agreed, \u201cBut I can tell you this: They\u2019ll never stand before a priest!\u201d</p><p>As Yoongi finished getting ready, I explained how our lives would be once we were a happily married couple. Every day with him would be happy because we were in love. We were together just as the Gods had willed. Just like we would be until we died.</p><p>\u201c\u2026and we\u2019ll have a little house with pink walls and a blue roof. And a tree in a garden just like the one that used to shelter me as a child. Then you and I can lie under the shade of the tree~\u201d I sprawled across the fine bedclothes.</p><p>My love Yoongi moved to sit, so I rolled on my side.</p><p>\u201cAnd then our children will climb it.\u201d</p><p>He stood with a start and looked at me. Maybe he hadn\u2019t thought that far, but it would happen. We\u2019d have children. I\u2019d bear as many as he wanted.</p><p>\u201cAnd it will be ours, forever.\u201d I looked at him with wide and innocent eyes.</p><p>He gave me a sweet smirk and moved to a mirror to tie his cream colored bowtie. Yoongi began to talk about how he loved me. I folded my legs and kicked them out to lie on the bed once more.</p><p>=================<br></p><p>I, Min Yoongi, son of a well known sacred bone, making me a sacred bone as well, continued to get ready for tonight\u2019s ball, \u201cSome girls take hours to paint every perfect nail\u2026Fragrant as flowers all powdered and prim and pale; but you are as wild as that wind-blown tree. As dark and as deep as the midnight sea. While they\u2019re busy dressing, you lie here warm and bold~\u201d</p><p>This girl who had shown up out of nowhere claiming to have healed my body </p><p>I said as I finished doing his tie and moving on to fixing my color and suspenders. \u201cSome girls you picture. Some you hold.\u201d</p><p>You looked at me him still in awe, innocence in your loving gaze. I thought about what my father said and continued, \u201cSome girls take courses at all the best schools in France; riding their horses and learning their modern dance. They\u2019re clever and cultured and worldly-wise, but you see the world through a child\u2019s wide eyes.\u201d</p><p>I used hair wax to make my black strands stay in place. \u201cWhile their dreams are grand ones. You want what\u2019s just in reach.\u201d Jamie wanted so much. Everything material, expensive, wanted what her parents raised her to want.</p><p>My smile couldn\u2019t be contained as I wiped my hands on a towel, \u201cSome girls you learn from. Some you teach. You are not small talk or shiny cars or mirrors or French cologne.\u201d I sprayed a bit on myself since it had become routine for me, and you didn\u2019t seem to hate it.</p><p>\u201cYou are the river, the moon, the stars: You\u2019re no one else I\u2019ve known\u2026\u201d</p><p>You tilted your head to get me to tell you more.</p><p>I replied, \u201cSome girls take pleasure in buying a fine trousseau. Counting each treasure and tying each tiny bow. They fold up their futures with perfumed hands while you face the future with no demands. Some girls expect things others think nothing of.\u201d</p><p>Then I turned to look at the door knowing my fiancee was just down the hall, \u201cSome girls you marry.\u201d Because there was no other choice. My eyes met yours, \u201cSome you love~\u201d</p><p>I loved you. Ever since you came into my room telling stories that I still wasn\u2019t sure were true, but I didn\u2019t care because my heart wanted you. (Y/N) was my happiness. You could never betray me for riches because you didn\u2019t want anything but me.</p><hr><p>Beautiful light music filled the grand hall as Yoongi greeted guests who congratulated him on his upcoming wedding with Jamie but whispered about him once he was gone. Large crystal chandeliers lit up the dance floor and the candlelit tables were attended by servants in the hotel uniforms. Flower petals cascaded from the ceiling and onto the floor. Laughter echoed off the walls.<br></p><p>The Sacred Bones at the Hotel Holly, dancing to their own little tune. Waiting to see\u2026 (Y/N)!</p><p>Jamie in her golden dress approached her husband to be who was probably on the lookout for his mistress. Jamie had not the\u2026pleasure of seeing her. Yoongi spent all his hours with her other than the times she was sleeping and he had to to talk to her about their upcoming wedding.</p><p>\u201cSome girls are saying she\u2019s simple as any child.\u201d She said with her arms folded.</p><p>He sighed, \u201cPlease, Jamie\u2026\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop talking about the rumors, \u201cBarefoot and praying and running the halls quite wild!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is she as pretty as we\u2019ve all heard? Your own pretty\u2026Well, what\u2019s the word?\u201d</p><p>They noticed all the heads turning to see a girl with a red hibiscus flower crown and an extravagant red dress to match. It was me. I approached Yoongi eagerly and relieved to see him looking at me, completely smitten with me.</p><p>\u201cYoongi~!\u201d I slowed when I saw him beside another woman.</p><p>\u201cSo this is your (Y/N). How beautiful she is.\u201d She looked at me.</p><p>My love introduced us, \u201c(Y/N), this is Gongju-nim Jamie. Jamie, this is (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>A woman I did not know bowed to me, \u201cI\u2019m so happy to meet you, my dear lady. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re a healer and a dancer, as well. Won\u2019t you dance for us now? Won\u2019t you give us a show?<br>Please, dear girl\u2026Don\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Yoongi who held my hands, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, (Y/N). Dance as you always do\u2026 Just for me.\u201d</p><p>I stood in the center of the room and began the dance I had known since I was a child. My feet nearly came from under me since I was not accustomed to dancing with shoes on my feet. So I took them off, but the familiar looking servants refused to take them from me. Hiding their faces and moving away. Then a man approached and took the bejeweled slippers from me.</p><p>Then I returned to my spot and felt the eyes on my. Looking around, it seemed as though I held the attention of the whole room.</p><p>In a tune that felt like home, one of the serving woman sang, \u201cWe dance~\u201d</p><p>As if by magic, the song came into my heart, \u201cWe dance~\u201d</p><p>WE DANCE!</p><p>My feet began to move to the music played by dark faces. I had danced as I always did to a song that I hadn\u2019t heard in what felt like years. My skirt fanned out around me with every spin, and I noticed the pale pink of a hotel maid twirling next to mine. She must\u2019ve gotten permission from her bosses. Eventually emerald green flew in rhythm with the legs of tailored suits.</p><p>The island blood could be hidden with powders and creams but it pulsed nonetheless. Guests clapped and cheered along to the tune as our reet moved to the rapid drums. Even my Yoongi joined in for the last bit. I really had taught him well. All the air in my lungs had gone through my feet, so I was panting hard once the song ended. My love held my hands for a moment before I went to retrieve my shoes but was stopped by an important looking man.</p><p>=================</p><p>Jamie was upset as she pulled Yoongi to the side. Everyone was back in their places. Their roles\u2026except (Y/N) and Jamie\u2019s husband to be who had let this go on long enough.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s very clear. She\u2019s in love with you. Yoongi, if you care, if you care at all, you must tell her.\u201d</p><p>You came back to your Min Yoongi with a large dazzling smile on your face, \u201cYoongi! Oh, the Ambassador said I was beautiful!!\u201d</p><p>=================</p><p>I was giddy and joyful after dancing in front of so many people and getting so many compliments afterwards. I forgot about my shoes and went to tell the man who loved me.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is so happy that I\u2019m here with you!\u201d</p><p>Something was off.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I searched Jamie\u2019s and Yoongi\u2019s faces for an answer.</p><p>She waited for him to speak, but was the one to talk when he didn\u2019t. Jamie held my hands with affectionate concern.</p><p>Jamie, with her dazzling gold crown to match her dress spoke firmly, \u201cMy dear dear girl, I have something to say. Something I fear was left unsaid. Many thanks for all you\u2019ve given Yoongi, but do not be misled. My dear Mademoiselle, you dance so very well. I pray you\u2019ll dance for Yoongi and for me when we are wed\u2026\u201d She let go at my shocked expression. \u201c(Y/N), Yoongi and I\u2026\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and at him. Wed? Her? Jamie was to wed my\u2026my Yoongi? I felt my heart sink.</p><p>He tried to explain, \u201cJamie and I have been promised to each other since we were children. This is how things are done, (Y/N). It\u2019s expected.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to cry, \u201cYoongi-ah, please\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will always be a place for you here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jamie decided it was best to give us space and left to talk with guests.</p><p>But our dream. \u201cWe\u2019ll race away in a car\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t change who I am or where I\u2019m from.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014 As silver as the moon\u2026\u201d</p><p>Yoongi shook his head, \u201cI wish it could be so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will live beside the sea. We\u2019ll have children, a garden, and a tree\u2026\u201d I held him tightly.</p><p>He held me away from him, \u201cI thought you understood. We could never marry.\u201d</p><p>We could\u2026never? Yoongi took off the necklace I had given him and placed it in my hands. Then he went back to the main room to continue being a part of the party. I was on the balcony, alone with my broken heart.</p><p>I called out to the gods once again with my whole heart, \u201cOh, gods. Oh, gods, Are you there? Are you there\u2026?\u201d</p><p>All the whispers from before and even after travelling to be with him swarmed in my head. \u201cBlacker than coal and low as dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has that boy done to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what he sees in a woman like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook how she bathes him and touches and protects him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to have the gods to repay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gods to repay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gods to repay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Gods to repay!!\u201d</p><p>The Gods to repay!<br></p><p>Jeongyeon appeared before me and everything went dead silent. She smirked at my current state of weakness. It\u2019s as if the rattle of a snake was inside of me as Death slithered closer to me.</p><p>\u201cThere were promises made in the darkness; promises made in your sleep; promises the gods demand you keep!\u201d She darted at me but I moved out of the way, \u201cYou gave him love. Love he would soon betray!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave him life. I am the price you\u2019ll pay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure as the grave. You must accept what is\u2026Now your life is forever mine\u2026\u201d Death held a knife to my throat.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to die! \u201cPlease, DON\u2019T!!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrade yours for his\u2026\u201d Jeongyeon said, removing the knife from my throat.</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved him. You loved him. And he betrayed you. Why should you die for him now?\u201d \u201cKill him, (Y/N). Kill the love~ you feel for him. Prove that <b><i>death is stronger than love</i></b> and you can have your own life again. Just as if you had never loved at all.\u201d She handed me the blade. </p><p>Death pulled him closer to me, \u201cI am the road leading to no return\u2026\u201d</p><p>A song that I had heard before was sung between her words, but it was so quiet in comparison, <i>\u201cThe courage of a dreamer\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cSecret of life finally his to learn\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYou are part\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>I had to choose. I could kill him. Easily. He wasn\u2019t even looking. No one noticed the dagger in my hand as I approached him from behind. Things could go back to normal. I\u2019d return to my own life just as Jeongyeon had promised. Just as if I had never loved at all.</p><p>\u201cI am the car racing toward distant shores\u2026\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d be able to <i>step </i>get rid of the pain <i>step </i>that HE caused! <i>Step</i></p><p><i>\u201cPart of the human heart\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>He was right there. Yoongi hadn\u2019t noticed me yet. I had to do it now.</p><p>\u201cNow his life is forever mine\u2026\u201d</p><p>I raised the knife to sink between his shoulder blades.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>And I dropped it, \u201c<i>I can\u2019t!</i>\u201d</p><p>People gasped and Yoongi turned with wide eyes to see me kneeling on the floor with tears streaming down my face. He stared at the knife. No matter how much he had hurt me by keeping the truth about his marriage a secret\u2026</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u2026I <i>love </i>you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cYou tried to <i>kill </i>me!\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>And so you were cast out of the Hotel Holly, your dress and chest being thrown into the sandy dirt. The gates slammed shut behind you.</p><p>Your eyes saw a couple on the other side you called out to them, \u201cI am Miss (Y/N). I am the Mistress of Min Yoongi!\u201d</p><p>If that was the only thing you could be to him, then you\u2019d wear the title. As long as you could be near him. The couple ignored you. A man passed by who recognized you.</p><p>He held your hand through the iron bars as you said, \u201cI was the one who danced at the ball!\u201d</p><p>You wore a beautiful (and clean) dress.</p><p>\u201cThe people applauded!<i> All eyes were on me!!!!</i>\u201d</p><p>He ran off at your outburst. Another Sacred Bone came passed.</p><p>\u201cThe Gods sent me! They sent me be with him!\u201d</p><p>And another.</p><p>\u201cYoongi needs me! He loves me!\u201d</p><p>It was his father who scoffed.</p><p>\u201cWithout me, he\u2019ll die!\u201d You spouted old phrases, ones you had used to get here in the first place.</p><p>It was still the truth still! Right? Even though you had healed him. Almost tried to kill him by literally stabbing him in the back.</p><p>\u201cSurely\u2026surely there has been a terrible mistake.\u201d You said to yourself as the sun started to tint the sky pink. \u201cHe must be wondering where I am.\u201d</p><p>Fruitlessly, you called to the couple you saw before as they were now returning to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cTell him\u2026tell him I am here. Tell him (Y/N) is waiting for him at the gate!\u201d</p><p>And so you did. For two weeks you did wait at the gate. Not sleeping. Not eating. Only waiting. Only watching as the grounds were made even more beautiful in preparation for the wedding. Even as Yoongi as Jamie were getting married.</p><p>As superstition dictated, they came to the gates of the Hotel to throw coins to the peasants thus assuring that their own fortunes would multiply. He was there with her dressed in white. You tried reaching out and waving to him, but he did not see.</p><p>Until you called his name, throat dry from having no water for a while, \u201cYoongi!\u201d</p><p>His eyes finally met yours as Jamie walked away. Yoongi approached you and held your hands. Through the gate, he gave you coins since you had none. You hadn\u2019t tried to get any. There was forgiveness in his eyes. He still loved you? But you didn\u2019t want coins. You wanted him! Your beautiful love kissed the tops of both your hands.</p><p>\u201cYoongi~?\u201d Jamie called from a distance, not knowing when he left her side.</p><p>He gave you one more look and then went back to his wife. You let the gold coin fall, heart completely broken. You laid on the ground and died. Your mother finding you too late. She had come just to try and pay you a visit.</p><p>Eomma Taeyong held your body and mourned, \u201cOh, (Y/N). Oh, (Y/N). You will always be a part of us. Oh, (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>Your father and the towns people took your body home as your soul rose out of it. Everyone mourned the loss of the girl with big dreams. Who they had raised. Who they had loved and still did to be honest.</p><p>\u201cYou will always be a part of us. Oh, (Y/N)\u2026Oooh\u2026\u201d They hummed as they set you down and buried your body.</p><p>And the gods began to cry tears of compassion for the orphan (Y/N) who proved that love could withstand the storm and cross the earth and survive even in the face of death. Jimin took you by the hand and led you to the sea where Key wrapped you in a wave and laid you to your rest. Jeongyeon was gentle as she carried you to shore, and Ros\u00e9 accepted you and held you to her breast.</p><p>And then, the gods blessed you, and transformed you into\u2026A tree!</p><p>A tree that sprang up and cracked the walls of the Hotel Holly, so that its gates could never close again. A tree that lived forever, sheltering peasants and Sacred Bone alike. A tree that watched over Yoongi for his lifetime\u2026in which his children played.</p><p>And one day, as Yoongi\u2019s young son sat in the shade of the tree, he noticed a beautiful young peasant girl high in its branches, looking out at the world. And the spirit of (Y/N) touched their hearts and set them free\u2026to love!</p><p>People sang about your legacy.</p><p>A man with strong arms touched the tree to feel your spirit, \u201cAnd she stands against the lightning and the thunder. And she shelters and protects us from above.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she fills us with the power and the wonder.\u201d Said a Sacred Bone who had come to visit.</p><p>\u201cOf her love\u2026\u201d Yoongi\u2019s son with a bunny smile commented while holding his crush\u2019s hand.</p><p>And this is why we tell the story. Why we tell the story. Why we tell the story.</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon touched the tree, \u201cIf you listen very hard you\u2019ll hear her call us\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo come share with her our laughter and our tears.\u201d Appa Shindong put his arm around her.</p><p>And as mysteries and miracles befall us through the years, we tell the story! We tell the story!</p><p>\u201cLife is why we tell the story!\u201d Ros\u00e9 said.</p><p>\u201cPain is why we tell the story!\u201d Jeongyeon added holding her hand.</p><p>\u201cLove is why we tell the story!\u201d Jimin claimed.</p><p>\u201cGrief is why we tell the story!\u201d Key suggested while messing up Jimin\u2019s hair.</p><p>A villager with a pink tank top agreed, but also said, \u201cHope is why we tell the story!\u201d</p><p>Another with wide hips added, \u201cFaith is why we tell the story!\u201d</p><p>Then everyone looked at the little girl, \u201cYou are whyyyyyy Why we tell the story. Why-y we tell the story~Why we tell the story. Why-y we tell the story!\u201d While dancing a new dance.<br><br>Jimin tapped the little girl\u2019s nose, \u201cSo I hope that you will tell this tale tomorrow. It will help your heart remember and relive.\u201d</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon grinned, \u201cIt will help you feel the anger and the sorrow\u2026\u201d and turned the girl towards the tree.</p><p>Where you floated down from the branches, \u201cAnd forgive\u2026\u201d</p><p>You kissed her forehead and pet her head while everyone including you sand, \u201cFor out of what we live and we believe, our lives become the stories that we weave.\u201d</p><p>Everyone got around the girl who began to speak and you returned to your tree, \u201cThere is an island where rivers run deep\u2026 Where the sea sparkling in the sun earns it the name \u2018Jewel of the Antilles\u2019 An island where the poorest of peasants labor\u2026 And the wealthiest of Sacred Bone play.

Where the sea, sparkling in the sun, earns it the name &ldquo;Jewel of the Antilles.&rdquo; An island where the poorest of peasants labor and the wealthiest of Sacred Bone play. Two different worlds on one island! The Sacred Bone, with their pale skins and their American ways, owners of the land and masters of their own fates. And the peasants, tan as sand and black as night, eternally at the mercy of the wind and the sea&hellip;Who pray constantly&hellip; to the gods.</p><p>On this new day, they said the usual prayers of a villager, &ldquo;Ros&eacute;, grow me a garden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please Kibum, don&rsquo;t flood my garden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jiminie, who will my love be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jeongyeon, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> come around me!&rdquo;</p><p>An older but spry older woman laughed and grabbed a visitor&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;Ah ha ha ha! Such powerful, such temperamental gods rule our island!&rdquo;</p><p>A woman with raspberry colored hair grabbed a table cloth and wrapped it around her waist, &ldquo;Ros&eacute;, Mother of the Earth.&rdquo; and wrapped it around her waist.</p><p>&ldquo;Kibum, God of Water!&rdquo; A man with a beautiful face and blue pants, a fisherman, put on a wave printed top. </p><p>A blonde boy with squishy cheeks, pushed down a short haired girl and placed a mosquito net around his shoulders like a shawl, &ldquo;Jimin, beautiful God of Love.&rdquo;</p><p>The girl then stood up and slit a juicy pomegranate and let the juice run down her wrist, &ldquo;And Jeongyeon, sly Demon of Death.&rdquo; She laughed and pointed the knife at Jimin.</p><p>&ldquo;Ros&eacute;, grow me a garden.&rdquo; They all echoed. &ldquo;Please Kibum, don&rsquo;t flood my garden. Jiminie, who will my love be?&rdquo; A flower was placed in her lap. &ldquo;Jeongyeon, don&rsquo;t come around me! Please, Kibum, don&rsquo;t flood my garden. Ros&eacute;, grow me a garden.&rdquo;</p><p>A villager with red hair and a wide smile picked up a small girl and swung her around while singing, &ldquo;We dance~&rdquo;</p><p>To which the others repeated in a similar tune, &ldquo;We dance~to the music of the gods.&rdquo; </p><p>The girl was set down and danced on her own now while the villagers began to sing, &ldquo;The music of the breezes through the green plantain. The murmur of the river and the roar of rain and if the gods decide to send a hur-ri-cane&hellip;&rdquo; A loud thump of a drum accented each syllable. &ldquo;We dance~ to their everchanging moods.&rdquo;</p><p>Ros&eacute; fanned herself and the little girl, &ldquo;We know the gods are happy when the green things grow.&rdquo;</p><p>Key got her attention and added, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re angry when the river starts to overflow.&rdquo;</p><p>The performers shook their hips and hands, &ldquo;And since we never know which way their winds will blow~We dance to the earth. We dance to the water. The gods awake and we take no chance.&rdquo; A small upbeat tune played and they continued. &ldquo;Our hearts hear the song. Our feet move along. And to the music of the gods, we dance!&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin guided the small girl and pointed to a place where the villagers mimicked proper posture, &ldquo;On the other side of this island, safe behind high walls and iron gates, the Sacred Bone dance to a different tune.&rdquo;</p><p>The lighter skinned members served face and sung, &ldquo;La la la la la la la la!&rdquo;</p><p>Water god Key folded his arms, &ldquo;They drink champagne, entertain tourists at their fine hotels, and tell their servants&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>A taller man with broad shoulders clapped his hands together and spoke to a darker skinned man, &ldquo;Polish up the Mercedes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;La la la la la la la la!&rdquo;</p><p>Taking the girl&rsquo;s dolls from her hands, Jeongyeon spread her arms wide, &ldquo;Two different worlds, never meant to meet.&rdquo;</p><p>Feminine death looked at the girl and spoke with a man, &ldquo;The peasants labor&mdash;&rdquo; and then looked at the boy, speaking with a woman with long red hair, &ldquo;The Sacred Bone eat!&rdquo;</p><p>The Sacred Bone paraded around saying, &ldquo;How fine our clothes are! How fast we drive! We dance at parties&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Peasants interrupted, &ldquo;While we are dancing just to stay alive!&rdquo; The crescendo built and then softened.</p><p>&ldquo;We dance~&rdquo; Said the women.</p><p>&ldquo;We dance~&rdquo; Repeated the men.</p><p>Together, they asked, &ldquo;What else is there to do&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The peasant men then acted out what they did, &ldquo;But plant the seed and pull the weed and chop the cane.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And bear the child and bear the load and bear the pain.&rdquo; The women did the same.</p><p>Then they sung together once again, &ldquo;And as the rich go racing to their own refrain, we dance to the earth, we dance to the water. The gods awake and we take no chance. Our hearts hear the song. Our feet move along. And to the music of the gods~&rdquo;</p><p>People clapped to the rhythm while others lifted their skirts to dance and even got visitors to move and groove along with them.</p><p>&ldquo;We dance to the earth. We dance to the water. The gods awake and we take no chance&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>An older man seemingly married to the woman from before said, &ldquo;Two different worlds, never meant to meet.&rdquo;</p><p>The music stopped and all heads turned towards the older woman who guided her there in the first place, &ldquo;But if the gods move our feet!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We daaaaance! We daaaaaance! We daaaaaannnnnnce!&rdquo;</p><p>With everything now settled, eyes settled on the one in the center who spoke:</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Our story begins on the night of a flood. Many huts washed away, many peasants drowned by Kibum&rsquo;s angry waters.</p><p>I was a child, walking home from the store in my hand me down red dress. The basket I was carrying was heavy enough to make my small body lean back in order to keep the groceries off the ground. Still, a lose grape fell onto the sandy dirt. I set the basket down to chase after it, and a small wave of water brought it back to me. Strange, I thought as I picked up the purple orb, water wasn&rsquo;t usually this close to the market. There was a lot more and coming right at me!</p><p>I rushed back to the basket, but before I knew it, my body had been swept up by the waves and my foods taken hostage by the misplaced sea. My mother had been in front of me with her own basket, calling my name. Now she screamed it as I was taken way too far away for me to ever here it being called again. Villagers of all sorts hurriedly packed up and grabbed their own children, racing for higher ground. Some sort of safety.</p><p>A panel of roofing came my way, and I grabbed it. When I was knocked off of it, I felt as though an orphan plucked from the flood by Kibum, sheltered in a tree by Ros&eacute;. And little did I know I&rsquo;d be sent on a journey by the gods. A journey that would test the strength of love against the power of <b>death</b>. On this island of two different worlds!</p><p>The story of (Y/N)!</p><p>I was just one small girl in a tree, torn from her mother. Crying in fright. One small girl tossed by sea and left to face the stormy night. I was one small girl. Holding tight&hellip;At last, the storm subsided and the morning sun glowed when two old peasants came cautiously down the road.</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon and Appa Shindong.</p><p>Taeyeon picked up a flower and tucked it in her hair, &ldquo;Ros&eacute; is smiling again, Shindong.&rdquo;</p><p>He was being grumpy, &ldquo;This morning, she smiles. Last night, she tried to blow our heads off!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hahahaha! Ah, Julian, just listen to those birds!&rdquo;</p><p>Coo coo coo coo coo. Coo coo coo coo coo.</p><p><i>Waah!!!</i> Sounded from up in a tree.<br /><br />&ldquo;What kind of bird is that?&rdquo; Shindong asked.</p><p>His wife pointed to the tree, at me, &ldquo;Look! There! One small face, two small knees.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you up there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; When I gave no reply, she looked to her husband. &ldquo;The girl can&rsquo;t speak.&rdquo;</p><p>He pointed to the skies, &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re to blame. Kibum probably meant to kill her!&rdquo;</p><p>Taeyeon rolled her eyes, &ldquo;Then she&rsquo;d be dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible he forgot.&rdquo;</p><p>She looked around frightened the gods might be listening, &ldquo;Shh! The gods don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then they had some reason to spare her life. It&rsquo;s best that we don&rsquo;t know what.&rdquo;</p><p>His wife agreed even though she looked back at the child, &ldquo;One small girl&hellip;better not.&rdquo;</p><p>They shook their heads and started to go, but then something magical came over them. That child needed someplace to live.</p><p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re too old for children.&rdquo; He tried to reason to himself.</p><p>She did the same, &ldquo;And we have no room and no food.&rdquo;</p><p>But I&ndash;the quiet girl in the tree&ndash;or something else, touched them deep inside. So not knowing quite why, they followed their hearts back to the tree, gently lifted the terrified child down&hellip;</p><p>I screamed, &ldquo;NOOOOO!!!!&rdquo;</p><p><br />And discovered I could speak after all. Now I had become one small girl in the way.Constantly hungry. They said I was learning too quick! Maybe because I was only about 6 when I learned how to climb to the top of the tallest palm tree without any help.</p><p>&ldquo;She makes me smile.&rdquo; Appa Shindong said when he saw where I was and pointed it out to Eomma.</p><p>&ldquo;She scares me sick!&rdquo; and she went pale at the sight of me so high. She clutched her heart and ordered the coconut gatherers to help me down.</p><p>But I lept right into my mother&rsquo;s arms from what didn&rsquo;t seem like a fifteen foot tree at the time. So they scolded and teased and held me. Ad mended the clothes I tore. The hut was crowded, and food was scarce. Yet somehow, their lives held more. They had one small girl to live for.</p><p>Because I had no idea of what my life was like or what my name was before the flood, they named me &ldquo;Desire&#769;e Dieu-Donne&#769;,&rdquo; or &ldquo;God-Given Desire.&rdquo; But in their affection, they called me simply (Y/N).</p><p>I recall a time when I was around the age of 8 and my curious nature came into play, so I asked, &ldquo;What does (Y/N) mean, Eomma?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It means Little Orphan.&rdquo; She tapped my nose. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re our sweet little orphan. We found you, and now your life is forever in our care.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>Appa answered, &ldquo;Because the gods willed it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>My mother shrugged, &ldquo;Perhaps they saved you for something special.&rdquo;</p><p>That simple answer made my eyes light up and I jumped up and down, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N), if we knew why the gods did the things they do, we would be gods ourselves!&rdquo;</p><p>I puffed up my cheeks cutely, &ldquo;Someday I&rsquo;m going to ask them, Eomma!&rdquo;</p><p>Both my parents giggled, and she ruffled my hair, &ldquo;Foolish girl! Run and hide!&rdquo;</p><p>Growing up, I was called both sweet as a eucalyptus and terrible as a tempest while I was banging a drum and humming a tune. I was (Y/N) and did what children did. Falling and running and calling and growing&hellip;and growing and growing and growing up too soon.</p><p>Ten years had passed and I had grown into a beautiful young woman. Sturdy from living a peasant&rsquo;s life and yet gentle with innocence claiming my heart. I folded the now dried blanket after taking it off the line, but soon slipped away to sit in a tree, allowing my mind to wander.<br /><br />I was now one small girl that wasn&rsquo;t so small. Lost in my daydreams day after day.</p><p>&ldquo;Call her name.&rdquo; Appa Shindong said.</p><p>But Eomma Taeyeon replied, &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t call. Her ears don&rsquo;t hear, she&rsquo;s far away.&rdquo;</p><p>My parents watched from the distance, talking among themselves after my mother finished my folding for me.</p><p>He agreed, &ldquo;And I know that she&rsquo;s getting older.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that it&rsquo;s meant to be.&rdquo;</p><p>Their arms couldn&rsquo;t hold me and keep me small, but all l that their hearts could see was one small girl. One small girl. Just one small girl in a tree.</p><p>The two then grabbed a few things before going to market. On their way, a car was speeding past and almost ran them over. No honking either, to warn pedestrians to get out of the way. The life of privilege wreaked of the silver mercedes. A few yelps of terror turned my attention to a stranger in white in a car. Going somewhere. Going far.</p><p>I wondered what it would be like to have a life like his.</p><p><i>How it must feel to go racing wherever you please, flying as free as a bird with his tail in the breeze.</i> I thought even the fish in the sea must be longing to fly after catching a glimpse of a stranger in white racing by.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh, gods. Oh, gods, are you there?&rdquo; You asked aloud. &ldquo;What can I do to get you to look down and give in? Oh, gods. Oh, gods, hear my prayer!&rdquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;m here in the field with my feet on the ground and my fate in the air waiting for life to begin! I knew that Eomma&rsquo;s contented and Appa accepts what he gets. They were happy for tea in their cups and no holes in their nets. Happy to have what they have and to stay where they are, they never even looked up at the sound of a car.</p><p>A stranger racing down the beach. Racing to places I was meant to reach! My imagination took a step further and imagined him there in the middle of the drum circle. I joined him and swung my hips to the rhythm. Then I imagined his car would stop and in I&rsquo;d hop and off we&rsquo;d drive!</p><p>We&rsquo;ll drive~! I turned around and he was gone.</p><p>I sighed and saw the setting sun. Had it already gotten this late? It was about time to go home. Before I did, I called for the Gods like I had been taught since I was little. I used my whole heart and my entire body.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, gods. Oh, gods. Please be there. Don&rsquo;t you remember your little (Y/N) from the tree?&rdquo; I even tried commanding them to see if I would get a sign. &ldquo;Wake up! Look down! Hear my prayer! Don&rsquo;t single me out And then forget me! Oh, gods. Oh, gods, let me fly!&rdquo; I spread my arms like wings. &ldquo;Send me to places where no one before me has been. You spared my life; show me why. You get me to rise like a fish to the bait then tell me to wait. Well, I&rsquo;m waiting!&rdquo; I called to the heavens.</p><p>Waiting for life to begin!</p><hr /><p><i>And the gods heard her prayer.</i> Had a good laugh about it too.<br /></p><p>Ros&eacute; fanned herself, &ldquo;The peasant girl wants a grand homme to carry her away! I should find a tree all covered with mangos&ndash;juicy mangos, fat and well-fed. Pick a mango&mdash;&rdquo; She took the one she just made from the tree.</p><p>Kibum took it from her, &ldquo;A juicy mango.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A lovely mango.&rdquo; Jimin added before the mango was taken from him.</p><p>It was by Jeongyeon who said, &ldquo;A poison mango&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>But everyone scowled at her. She just shrugged it away. As a demon of death, it was her job to kill people. Poison did that. Anyways, Ros&eacute; dropped the mango. It made a whistling sound as it fell from the heavens. Then boom!</p><p>&ldquo;To knock some sense in her head!&rdquo;</p><p>They laughed and repeated, &ldquo;Knock some sense in her head!&rdquo;</p><p>Kibum offered to, &ldquo;Splash her with a wave!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Scare her half to death!&rdquo; Jeongyeon lurched forward.</p><p>But Jimin saw how honest her prayer was, so he said, &ldquo;Give her what she wants!&rdquo;</p><p>Ros&eacute;, Kibum, and Jeongyeon looked at him, confused, &ldquo;Give her what she&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, &ldquo;Give her what she wants. Love has many powers. If the love is true, It can cross the earth, and withstand the storm. It can conquer&ndash;&rdquo; Jimin poked in Jeongyeon&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;Even you.&rdquo;</p><p>The gods of earth and water decided to walk away and give the two their space to talk, mostly because neither of them wanted to be put at odds with Death herself.</p><p>She scoffed, &ldquo;Love conquer death? Why, I could stop her heart like that!&rdquo; She snapped her fingers with a quickness.</p><p>Jimin smirked, &ldquo;Stop her heart from beating, yes. But not from loving. Not if love is what she chooses.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeongyeon shook her head dismissively, &ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Interesting!&rdquo; Key piped up.</p><p>Ros&eacute; nodded, &ldquo;More amusing than mangos!&rdquo;</p><p>They came to a decision, &ldquo;A journey!&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin reached out to (Y/N), &ldquo;I will give her strength when the time is right.&rdquo;</p><p>Mother nature followed suit, &ldquo;I will guide her way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will make her choose!&rdquo; A wicked grin spread across Death&rsquo;s face.</p><p>Kibum, already flowing down to Earth, said, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll provide the place where two different worlds will meet tonight!&rdquo;</p><p>Tonight!<br /><br />God of water Kibum smeared his arm across the sky, &ldquo;Let there be no moon. Let the clouds race by. Where the road meets the sea, let the tide be high.&rdquo; And his head turned as he saw the girl about to return home. &ldquo;Let there be a girl&hellip;&rdquo; He drew her back to the beach. &ldquo;Walking by the sea, and let there be rain!&rdquo;</p><p>A small trickle began as Key continued to command his part of nature, &ldquo;Listen to her prayers, full of hope and pain as she stares down the road in the pouring rain.&rdquo; It quickly picked up.</p><p>She should&rsquo;ve been home by now or trying to get there more quickly, but instead she stood transfixed in the middle of the empty road. There was rain on the road. Rain on her face. Rain makes a road such a dangerous place.</p><p>He smiled to himself as the other player came near, &ldquo;Let there be a car racing through the night where the road meets the sea. Let her wait where the road meets the sea. Let him spin where the road meets the sea. Let their fate begin~ in the&hellip;Raaaaaiiiinnnin!&rdquo; He bellowed and thunder clapped.</p><p>Kibum was gone as soon as he came, leaving an unsupervised driver swerve when he saw big brown eyes and a red dress in the middle of the street. He quickly ran into a tree which Ros&eacute; made sure was unharmed in all of this.</p><hr /><p>I heard the screech of wheels and metal bending. Saw lights brighter than the moon and then nothing. I went to him and screamed at the top of my lungs.</p><p>&ldquo;Help! Someone! Come quickly! A car has crashed!&rdquo; I held him in my arms. &ldquo;A boy is hurt! Help me, someone! Where is everyone?&rdquo;</p><p>Not a soul was coming near. It was if we weren&rsquo;t on the sandy beach at all, but somewhere else where only the two of us existed.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello? Can you hear me?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p><i>His skin is so pale</i>, I think.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you see me?&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes opened for a moment. They were eyes from another world. Gray as the sky.</p><p>I spoke to whoever heard, &ldquo;Oh, gods. Oh, gods, you saved my life for a reason. And now, I think I know why!&rdquo;</p><p>A man&rsquo;s voice made me jump, &ldquo;He roared down the road like the devil himself&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>More people started to gather.</p><p>&ldquo;Going too fast around the curves!&rdquo; A thick woman added.</p><p>&ldquo;Sent us scrambling off the road like chickens&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He has what he deserves!&rdquo;</p><p>No, what? He didn&rsquo;t deserve this! He was too kind.</p><p>A beautiful woman squaked, &ldquo;Jeongyeon wants him&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The man she was with finished, &ldquo;And Jeongyeon will have him!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The boy is dying before our eyes!&rdquo; one of the men before spoke up again.</p><p>&ldquo;Help him!&rdquo; Mom said.</p><p>&ldquo;Hide him!&rdquo; One of her friends said right after.</p><p>Appa interrupted, &ldquo;Noooo! Don&rsquo;t touch him! Better leave him where he lies. Even a wealthy man sometimes dies.&rdquo;</p><p>How could he? I spoke up, &ldquo;Please! He needs help!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If this boy dies in our hands, the rich will send police.&rdquo; He stated.</p><p>&ldquo;He needs care!&rdquo;</p><p>Eomma agreed, &ldquo;And if he lives, oh, how angry the gods will be!&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone around me seemed to have the same idea, &ldquo;The only thing that will save the boy&rsquo;s life is to send him back to his world!&rdquo;</p><p>I knew I was being stubborn, but I had to be, &ldquo;The only thing that will save the boy&rsquo;s life&hellip; is me!&rdquo;</p><p>All the villagers stared in disbelief, finally silent and still even as rain covered us head to toe.</p><p>So I continued, &ldquo;I have prayed to the gods and at last they&rsquo;ve answered. They saved my life so that I could save his. My heart knows this.&rdquo; My eyes looked at my father. &ldquo;Please, Appa.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed, &ldquo;I will find where he comes from.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shindong! No!&rdquo; Eomma Taeyeon held his arm tightly.</p><p>He nodded, &ldquo;I will find who he is, and soon! But &rsquo;til I return, you care for him, (Y/N).&rdquo;</p><p>And, after he bid his wife and daughter goodbye, Shindong set off down the road, toward the Black Mountains. The peasants carried the boy to the village, and laid him on my mat. And so my long vigil began&hellip;</p><p>One day gone by like it was nothing, just making sure he was dried off as much as possible with rain pelting the windows. And two days gone by without him opening his eyes at all. People would stop by just to whisper about the whole situation.</p><p>They would say things such as, &ldquo;The boy has the will of the devil himself, clinging to life by one small thread.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Julian&rsquo;s daughter, he&rsquo;d certainly be dead!&rdquo;</p><p>Even when I was just doing the most simple of things to make sure he was being taken care of properly, they&rsquo;d whisper and gossip as if they weren&rsquo;t standing outside of my hut. As if I couldn&rsquo;t hear them. I did, but I was too focused on trying to save this boy&rsquo;s life to care about any of it.</p><p>It was two women chirping back and forth, &ldquo;Look how she bathes him&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And touches and protects him.&rdquo;</p><p>Two men were by their sides, &ldquo;She binds his wounds and she rubs his chest&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if the girl&rsquo;s possessed!&rdquo;</p><p>My mother worried for me as I looked through every book and was alarmed by every cough, &ldquo;You need food. You need sleep. You just can&rsquo;t go on without any sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eomma, sssh!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have some tea.&rdquo; She offered.</p><p>I felt his arm, &ldquo;His skin is hot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have a rest.&rdquo; She had even set out another mat for me in the corner.</p><p>&ldquo;He needs me here.&rdquo;</p><p>I was tired of her trying to convince me away from him, so I went to yell at her but we ended up talking over each other, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see how much this matters to me? I know what&rsquo;s best!&rdquo;</p><p>Eomma was shocked at my words, but that didn&rsquo;t stop her from sticking around me as I tried a new healing techniques. Now the sky was growing dim and the clouds are racing by. The gods are looking down at a boy they meant to die and a girl who placed herself in their way&hellip; So they prayed.</p><p>Three days gone by and my stomach was still empty other than what slithered down when I chewed up herbs and leaves and turned them into a fine paste. And four days gone by without one wink of sleep. I don&rsquo;t know if I even blinked when keeping my eye on him.</p><p>Two brothers and their sister came to watch me work today.</p><p>The oldest spoke first, &ldquo;I fear for the girl and her mother, as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing but trouble looms ahead.&rdquo; Their sister agreed.</p><p>&ldquo;Mister Shindong could be deep in danger.&rdquo; The youngest spoke.</p><p>Their sister spoke again, &ldquo;Arrested, lost or dead!&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>In the forest on the edge of the mountains, Shindong held a lit lamp and looked around with worry in his heart. He paused for a second and got on his knees.</p><p>&ldquo;Ros&eacute;, mother of the earth, guide the feet of this poor peasant man. Hear my prayer. Which way there&hellip;and which way home?&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>I called to my mom, &ldquo;I need herbs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your father gone&ndash;&rdquo; She replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Eomma, herbs!&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t have time for her nagging.</p><p>My mother was upset, &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t care. Oh, my god what has this boy done to you?&rdquo;</p><p>I grabbed her hands, &ldquo;Mam&hellip;sssh!&rdquo; and went back to the boy. &ldquo;He needs rest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your appa lost.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He needs care&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>She pointed in my direction, &ldquo;Because of <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>We spoke over each other once more, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that he&rsquo;s in terrible danger? What must I do?&rdquo;</p><p>Now the sky is turning dark, and the wind is turning chill. The gods are out for blood. They&rsquo;ve been cheated of their kill by a girl without the sense to obey&hellip;so they prayed. They moved their feet together in order to ward off evil because once it got in it probably wouldn&rsquo;t leave with just a single casualty.</p><p>Everytime death came near, I&rsquo;d use water and flame. Herbs and prayer to keep him alive. I didn&rsquo;t even know his name, but I went without sleeping for many days to have the hope of knowing it from his own lips.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeobo! Where is my yeobo! Bring my Shindong home!&rdquo; Taeyeon wailed.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>At that same time, Shindong had made it to the gates but was confronted by the gatekeepers. He begged for entry.</p><p>&ldquo;You want what?&rdquo; The keeper scoffed.</p><p>The chubby man replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come so far and I need&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get back!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have some news for Kim-nim&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>The guard warned again, &ldquo;<i>Get back!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Min Seonsaeng-nim has a&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peasant pig!&rdquo; He slapped the man for his insolence.</p><p>Now on the ground, Appa Shindong said, &ldquo;Please, I beg!&rdquo;</p><p>The guard was surprised, &ldquo;You must be mad!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I must see Seonsaeng-nim&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Min Seonsaeng-nim?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have come so far&ndash;&rdquo; He tried to get up but was stopped by the barrel of a gun.</p><p>&ldquo;So far to die!&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes caught a missing poster with the image of the boy from the crash and pointed desperately, &ldquo;I have found his son!&rdquo;</p><p>That caught their attention and so the guard helped him up, a bit suspicious but he wasn&rsquo;t the one with a life to lose if this man was lying.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Now the sky has turned to black and the wind is like a knife. Jeongyeon is coming back for the boy who clings to life and the girl will have the gods to repay&hellip;</p><p>They prayed with their whole bodies, &ldquo;Jeongyeon, don&rsquo;t come around me! Jeongyeon, don&rsquo;t come around me! Jeongyeon, don&rsquo;t come around me! Jeongyeon, don&rsquo;t come around me!&rdquo;</p><p>Some say it was the worst storm the Gods had ever sent. Peasants prayed that they&rsquo;d live to see the morning, but what of (Y/N)? </p><p>What of me? Well, some say I had gone without sleep for so long that my mind wandered further into my dreams. I had no wind nor rain, only my beating heart of this pale dying boy.</p><p>I even sang to him as comfort, &ldquo;Sure as a wave needs to be near the shore. You are the one I was intended for. Deep in your eyes, I saw the gods&rsquo; design. Now my life is forever yours.&rdquo; I smiled. &ldquo;And you are mine.&rdquo;</p><p>I changed his bandages and sang, &ldquo;I am a tree holding away the storm. Here in my arms, I&rsquo;ll keep you safe and warm. Even the gods won&rsquo;t dare to cross this line where my life is forever yours, and you are mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you are mine,&rdquo; came his voice from the doorway.</p><p>I knew he&rsquo;d be ok because of me!</p><p>Our hearts sang together, &ldquo;Mine&hellip;We&rsquo;ll race away in a car as silver as the moon, and the storm will turn to sun on an island where the earth and sea are one. Sure as this night leads to a sky of blue. Sure as my heart led me to be with you.&rdquo; He leaned his forehead on my own. &ldquo;Surely the gods meant this to be a sign that my life is forever yours and you are&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miiiiiine! MIIIINNEE!&rdquo; It was, Jeongyeon. There was no mistaking it.</p><p>Where was my boy?</p><p>She stood above him and grinned the darkest grin I had ever seen, &ldquo;Arrogant fool. Think you can hold back death?&rdquo;</p><p>Death herself came before me, but I wouldn&rsquo;t let her ruin this, &ldquo;Stay away!&rdquo; I was shaking but stood firm.</p><p>Jeongyeon shoved me back without even touching me, &ldquo;This boy is mine. I am his dying breath!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you have him!&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, &ldquo;Sure as the grave, you must accept what is! Now his life is forever mine~&rdquo;</p><p>It was if death was pulling his soul from out of his body. It raised with her motion. I had to do something! Something now!</p><p>&ldquo;Take mine for his!&rdquo; I blurted.</p><p>She looked at me with shock, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>With more conviction, I repeated, &ldquo;Take my life. My soul&hellip; for his.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am the road leading to no return.&rdquo; Jeongyeon warned.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo; I glared at her.</p><p>She returned it tenfold, &ldquo;Secret of life nobody wants to learn&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would die for him!&rdquo; I said firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;I am the car racing toward distant shores.&rdquo;</p><p>My eyes were on him, not death, &ldquo;Now his life is forever mine&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Jeongyeon pulled my attention back and pulled my soul into her grasp as well, &ldquo;Your life is forever mine&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>It was excruciatingly painful, but as soon as it was over, I looked back at the boy whose life I was saving, &ldquo;And I am yours&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Our fates were sealed. Death left humming to herself followed by a laugh like the cracking of bones.</p><hr /><p>The next day I realized I had finally gone to sleep after staying up to protect my boy. I don&rsquo;t know how long but I awoke to pale muscles holding me as they took him away! They gave me to my worried parents as they took him to a truck and laid him in the back still on top of my mat!<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, stop!&rdquo; I called. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take him! Give him back!&rdquo; My arms flailed and failed to reach his still unconscious form.</p><p>He was getting better! The Gods&ndash;why was he taken from me?</p><p>My father&rsquo;s grip was firm, &ldquo;Now the Gods are happy! He is there in his world and you are here in ours! Everything is as it should be (Y/N)!&rdquo; he looked me dead in the eyes. &ldquo;There can never be anything between a peasant and a Sacred Bone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Appa, he needs me!&rdquo; My gaze held strong. &ldquo;Without me&hellip;he&rsquo;ll die!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let the Gods decide his fate!&rdquo; My mother said. &ldquo;What can a peasant like you do for someone like him but shine his shoes?!&rdquo;</p><p>I went to her and held her hands, &ldquo;His ancestors one loved a peasant girl.&rdquo;</p><p>I had heard the villagers gossiping about his heritage all while I did my best to heal him. His family cursed to stay on this island while their hearts forever yearned for their homeland.</p><p>&ldquo;This time a Sacred Bone will marry one. I know it!&rdquo; I made eye contact with both my parents. The ones who raised me. &ldquo;I am in his blood and he is in mine.&rdquo;</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon&rsquo;s face fell, crumbled, &ldquo;Marry you?&rdquo; She held my face in her hands. &ldquo;You are mad. He will not marry you, (Y/N)!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I must go to him.&rdquo; I said, not a shred of doubt in my heart. </p><p>I took Eomma&rsquo;s hands from my face and backed away from her. How could they not believe me? It wasn&rsquo;t as if it were some random thing! It was my hearts! It was the Gods! I loved him and we were meant to be together!</p><p>&ldquo;I must go to him! His heart beats for me like a drum. The gods are dancing for me, Eomma!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Please, Eomma. Please, Appa.&rdquo; I begged them with my whole heart. &ldquo;Give me your blessing and let me go.&rdquo;</p><p>They said nothing with their mouths, but spoke to one another with their eyes. I knew my answer! Why didn&rsquo;t they know theirs?</p><p>Stubborn words came out of my mouth, &ldquo; I will go!&rdquo;</p><p>My mom sighed and tucked her hair behind her ear, &ldquo;What can I say to stop you now now that you&rsquo;ve heard your drums and seen your dancers? Now that you think your heart has all the answers?&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes were filled with sorrow as she looked at me, &ldquo;Who knows how high those mountains climb? Who knows how deep those rivers flow? Who knows how wrong a dream can go, (Y/N)?&rdquo;</p><p>Appa Shindong gently touched my arm, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be there to guide your way&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To braid your hair or dry your tears&hellip;&rdquo; Eomma added. &ldquo;As we have done these many years, (Y/N). (Y/N)&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>My father had me sit, &ldquo;What you are, we made you. What we gave, you took. Now you run without one backward look.&rdquo;</p><p>Mother smoothed my hair, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find some other boy to save. Some other life that you can share. Your heart is young; new dreams are everywhere. Choose your dreams with care, (Y/N).&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I <i>have </i>chosen. And my dreams are there, down <i>that </i>road!&rdquo; I stood and pointed out the window.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a child, (Y/N)!&rdquo; Appa bellowed. &ldquo;The road is hard and dangerous. The city is miles away. And even if you get there, even if you get to the Hotel Holly, you will never get through the gate!&rdquo;</p><p>His voice was anger and confusion and heavy with pleading. Why was he so worried? </p><p>&ldquo;I will get there, Appa. I will get through the gate. I&rsquo;m not a child any longer!&rdquo; I knew their words but felt so different about them. &ldquo;What I am, you made me. What you gave, I owe. But if I look back, I&rsquo;ll never go. Who knows how high those mountains climb?&rdquo;</p><p>I gazed out the window, &ldquo;Who knows how deep those rivers flow?&rdquo; and then turned my attention back to them. &ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s there. That&rsquo;s all I need to know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>As they always did when things were rough, they hid their tears even though their aged faces showed everything they were feeling. I couldn&rsquo;t just give up, though. He was my fate! Us being together was destiny. I didn&rsquo;t argue with it, so why&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Go and find your love.&rdquo; Appa Shindong said.</p><p>Eomma nodded and placed her necklace around my neck, &ldquo;Go and swim the sea.&rdquo;</p><p>Together, they assured me, &ldquo;You know where we&rsquo;ll be&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Always there with me&hellip;&rdquo; I nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)&hellip;&rdquo; they hugged me tightly.</p><p>So I set off into the world with everything looking so bright and new! It was scary&hellip;just a little bit. Ok, maybe a lot of bit. I had nowhere&hellip;no idea where I was going. But on this island, the earth sings as soon as the storm ends. And as my feet set out, I realized I was walking with old friends.</p><p>The birds&hellip;The trees&hellip;The frogs&hellip;And the breezes&hellip; That&rsquo;s when I lost all my fear. I knew Ros&eacute; was near! She appeared out of nowhere and had a huge smile on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never been away from the sea, child. You&rsquo;re gonna need a helping hand. A fish has got to learn to swim on land!&rdquo; She motioned me towards her. &ldquo;Walk with me, little girl. Don&rsquo;t you be afraid. Follow me, little girl, let me be your guide. A pretty thing like you will need a thing or two&rdquo;</p><p>She booped my nose and I giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;And whatever you need. Mama will provide. Ohhhhh! Down the road, little girl, you may lose your way. All alone in a world that may seem too wide.&rdquo;</p><p>The red haired goddess sat on an upturned boat and tapped her skirt to motion for me to place myself there, &ldquo;But sit on mama&rsquo;s lap, and I will draw a map, and whatever you need Mama will provide!&rdquo;</p><p>She sat up and twirled me in all sorts of ways. It was as if the earth itself was speaking to me and bending to her will.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll provide you moss to soften the road! Rocks to sit on! Trees to sleep underneath! Sand, fun for your toes! Plantain to fill up your belly!&rdquo; And the wind danced through my hair as she sang to me. &ldquo;Breeze to fan your face! Grass for making your bed!&rdquo;</p><p>I pointed at a blood sucking little fella that kept buzzing around me, &ldquo;Mosquitoes?&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;</p><p>I tried to clap it between my hands, but it must&rsquo;ve flown away as my hands were free of any squashed bug bits.</p><p>&ldquo;Bugs will bite, little girl and the night will fall. All alone in the dark, you&rsquo;ll be terrified. But you will make it through &lsquo;cause I am liking you!&rdquo; She spun me around once more. &ldquo;And whatever you need Mama will provide!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mama will provide&hellip;Mama will provide&hellip;Mama will provide&hellip;&rdquo; The forest sang as my footsteps became more sure.</p><p>Ros&eacute; belted into my ear, &ldquo;Oh&hellip;!&rdquo; and giggled at my startled reaction. &ldquo;Walk with me, little girl and I&rsquo;ll take you far! &lsquo;Round each bend, little friend, I&rsquo;ll be by your side. That&rsquo;s what Mama&rsquo;s worth, to give her child the earth, and whatever you need, mama will&hellip;&rdquo; She took a deep breath as the plants twirled and prepared themselves for another belting moment. &ldquo;PROVIIIIIIIIIDDEEE!&rdquo;</p><p>I embraced her and with a wave of Ros&eacute;&rsquo;s fan, a clear path came before me. She motioned me on and off I went.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Some say&hellip;How you began your long journey toward the city! Some say your feet were bare and the road was long and cruel Some say you got a ride from a vendor and his mule. Some say the gods pulled up in a car and drove you all the way. Well, no one knows how the real truth goes, but that&rsquo;s what some say!</p><p>Some might wonder how far did she travel. The answer is as far as they suppose. And how long did it take you? Much longer than their nose! And were you ever frightened or was your love too strong? And did you know she&rsquo;d end up in a story and a song?</p><p>What happened when (Y/N) finally reached the city? Some say they laughed at you for your peasant feet were bare. Some say that vendor man gave you shoes too small to wear. Some say&hellip;the gods said, &ldquo;Put on the shoes! It&rsquo;s the price you have to pay!&rdquo;</p><p>The shoes were tight, but you said, &ldquo;Alright!&rdquo;</p><p>Well, that&rsquo;s what some say! Some say that at last (still wearing her painful new city shoes) you arrived at the gates of the Hotel Holly. But the fierce guard saw you had nothing to sell to the tourists.</p><p>&ldquo;STOP!&rdquo; They yelled.</p><p>But you must have smiled your most beautiful smile. And Jimin must have touched the fierce guard on the shoulder, for he nodded and some say the gate swung open and you entered and went in search of your Yoongi. Some say you scrubbed the floors &lsquo;til you learned where he was kept. Some say you climbed a vine to the window where he slept. While some say the gods just lifted you up and placed you where he lay.</p><p>Well, no one knows how the real truth goes. It all depends what you hear from friends. It&rsquo;s no surprise, if it&rsquo;s all just lies, but that&rsquo;s what some say&hellip;<br /></p><hr /><p>I waited until I saw him struggle to get into his bed with his crutches that I came to help him. His eyes opened wide as he put his hand up to stop me and he backed up, frightened.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you in here? It isn&rsquo;t allowed!&rdquo;</p><p>I spoke up, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember me? It&rsquo;s (Y/N).&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get out before I call a guard.&rdquo; He hissed.</p><p>My body moved on its own, closer to him, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember me? I saved your life.&rdquo;</p><p>He scuffed, &ldquo;<i>You </i>saved my life? What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>Did he really not recall? But the Gods&hellip;</p><p>I stood back at the foot of his bed, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember?&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi answered with a quick, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>He eyed me as I swayed nervously. I had come all this way to be with him. I pressed on.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one who found you crushed inside your car.&rdquo; My words were gentle but firm. &ldquo;I watched over you when you nearly died. I bathed you and gave you my mat to lie on.&rdquo; It was nowhere to be found.</p><p>My dark brown hands smoothed his expensive white bed sheets as they recalled how they cared for his unconscious body for days on end. Still no recollection was to be found behind his coconut colored eyes illuminated by the bedside lamp.</p><p>So I approached him, &ldquo;I have seen the scar on your chest. It&rsquo;s like a half moon.&rdquo; I cupped my hand to match its shape and placed it near his heart where I knew the scar was. &ldquo;Here~&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi blinked, a pout on his lips but finally a memory breaking through, &ldquo;So, it was you?&rdquo;</p><p>I smiled and felt his head though he flinched at my touch, &ldquo;Yes! You&rsquo;re very ill. You burn like fire!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My leg won&rsquo;t heal.&rdquo; He motioned to his bandaged calf.</p><p>&ldquo;The Gods sent me to make you well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think your peasant superstitions can do what doctors can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; He squinted his eyes. &ldquo;You, little girl?&rdquo;</p><p>I took on a semi-scolding tone, &ldquo;I kept you alive in the face of death! Anyone in my village would tell you so, and I can heal you. Now.&rdquo;</p><p>Was he really going to keep doubting someone sent by the Gods after defying one of them? His future wife?</p><p>&ldquo;You should go home.&rdquo; Yoongi said.</p><p>I knelt at the side of his bed, our hands only inches apart.</p><p>&ldquo;But I came all the way to be with you! Let me stay.&rdquo;</p><p>He stuck out his chin, &ldquo;Oh? So you can tell me more stories?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am telling the truth.&rdquo; I said simply.</p><p>The black haired man scoffed, &ldquo;A pretty thing&ndash;what&ndash;sent by the &lsquo;gods&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>I looked into his eyes, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Min Yoongi just stared at me, slightly taken aback by how serious I was. How could I not be serious when he doubted my very reality so? My people&rsquo;s song came in on the wind. He seemed to have recalled something else. A puzzled look came across his face.</p><p>Another glance at me, &ldquo;Alright then&hellip;What harm can it do?&rdquo; He did a sloppy hand flourish towards his leg. &ldquo;How me your powers. I&rsquo;ll pretend to believe them.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at me as I sat now on the edge of his bed smiling at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; He raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Perhaps maybe the Gods did send me a gift after all.&rdquo;</p><p>So I began to work on his ailing parts. I felt a presence but it didn&rsquo;t interrupt, simply watched as I took care of my soulmate.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Jimin watched from the window, making sure he was known just enough but did not interfere. He wanted to help&hellip;move things along since you had worked so hard to get here. His song was like a spell nudging your hearts closer together.</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, ooh. The courage of a dreamer&hellip;The innocence of youth&hellip;The failures and the foolishness&hellip;That lead us to the truth.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled as he noticed how happy you were just to be near Yoongi.</p><p>&ldquo;The hopes that make us happy. The hopes that don&rsquo;t come true. And all the love there ever was: I see this all in you.&rdquo; Because he believed that &ldquo;You are part~Part of the human heart.&rdquo;</p><p>Yes, the way you looked at him and took care of him. There was no doubt in Jimin&rsquo;s mind that you were part of the human heart. You were part of all who took the journey.</p><p>&ldquo;And managed to endure. The ones who knew such tenderness. The ones who felt so sure. The ones who came before you. The others yet to come, and those who you will teach it to.&rdquo; His gaze reached to comfort Eomma Taeyeon and Appa Shindong. &ldquo;And those you learned it from.&rdquo;</p><p>The blonde beauty recognized the change in Yoongi&rsquo;s eyes as he saw how you worked and got him to hold your hand to bring you closer to him. He continued to work his magic and almost giggled at how shocked you were.</p><p>&ldquo;You are part~Part of the human heart. You are part&hellip;This is the gift I give through your love you&rsquo;ll live forever&hellip;Forever~ Forever.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi caressed your hair all the way down your cheek and to your chin. You couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at his chin. Jimin made sure your love&rsquo;s hand was firmly around your waist.</p><p>&ldquo;You are part&hellip;Tonight~Tonight~Part of the human heart~~~~&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>And he kissed me. I kissed him back of course. My heart was pounding inside my chest. I knew that he&rsquo;d love me once he knew the truth, once he accepted it. I could hear the wedding bells already.</p><p>And the night became day. Still Yoongi kept the gentle (Y/N) beside him! The day became a week and still you slept in his room. After two weeks, the gossip began spreading through the walls of the Hotel Holly&ndash;even into the city&ndash;until everyone had heard that the ailing Min Yoongi had chosen a peasant as a lover. And little~by little~ you were &ldquo;healing him&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, what can he want with a woman like her?&rdquo; A man asked as he walked with a friend and two women.</p><p>&ldquo;Blacker than coal and low as dirt!&rdquo; The woman on his arm added.</p><p>Her friend agreed, &ldquo;He could have the world but takes a peasant!&rdquo;</p><p>The other man smacked his own head, &ldquo;Perhaps his brain was hurt!&rdquo;</p><p>Even the servants whispered, &ldquo;Look how she holds him and touches and attends him. The boy believes she can make him well&hellip;and she has him in a spell.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi had been laying with his head on my lap while I caressed his pale face. I tapped his shoulder so that he would stand. I did as well, fiddling with the locket Eomma had given me when I left the village.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a gift for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi grinned, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; tucking his shirt into his pants.</p><p>&ldquo;A charm.&rdquo; I kneeled on his bed and took it off. &ldquo;If you wear it next to your heart, it will make you whole again.&rdquo;</p><p>I clasped it around his neck and let my arms rest on his shoulders. He beamed at me with sunlight and affection in his gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;You are my charm.&rdquo; My love kissed my cheek. &ldquo;Without you, I could never be whole again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will never leave you, Yoongi.&rdquo;</p><p>Two women, overdressed for any occasion, commented on the relationship as well.</p><p>The one in green asked, &ldquo;Now, what do you make of a peasant like her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Putting on airs without a doubt!&rdquo; Her friend in a lighter green replied.</p><p>A man passing by inserted himself in the conversation, &ldquo;When the boy is well and does not need her&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>The two women joined him in completing his thought, &ldquo;&mdash;How soon he&rsquo;ll throw her out!&rdquo;</p><p>Lifting his crutch off the ground, Yoongi spun in a circle, &ldquo;Soon, I&rsquo;ll be dancing again!&rdquo;</p><p>I smiled and caught him before he fell and waited for his crutch to touch the floor once more, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll dance with you! But for now, walk slowly, Yoongi.&rdquo;</p><p>A spark came alive in his eyes, &ldquo;Then you must walk even more slowly~&rdquo;</p><p>With a giggle, I asked, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I can <i>catch </i>you!&rdquo; He began to playfully chase me with a slight limp ang giggling, so I ran just fast enough to stay out of his grasp.</p><p>His father called out to him, &ldquo;Yoongi-ah!&rdquo; a paduk board in his grasp.</p><p>He stopped in his tracks, &ldquo;Abeoji.&rdquo;</p><p>His cold eyes glared at me, so I made my way back to my love&rsquo;s room. Part of me was afraid Min Appa would hit me across the head with that board. The other guests turned their heads whenever I met their eyes. Nothing mattered as long as Yoongi love me, which he did.</p><p>&ldquo;How long do you think you&rsquo;ll be playing this game?&rdquo; The older man asked.</p><p>His son shook his head, &ldquo;This is no game!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Surely you can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s real?&rdquo; He scoffed.</p><p>Yoongi nodded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with (Y/N)!&rdquo;</p><p>Min Abeoji replied sternly, &ldquo;You are not the first to want a peasant. I, too, know their appeal&hellip;But you are my son. You&rsquo;ll do what must be done <i>no matter what you feel</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>He left his son with sadness in his heart. Yoongi began to go in the direction his love had gone while the guests snickered behind his back. The trio from earlier had seen everything but pretended like they had not by hiding behind fans and newspapers.</p><p>&ldquo;I know what he sees in a peasant like her&hellip;&rdquo; The man said coming from behind his paper.</p><p>&ldquo;Probably makes him rise like yeast!&rdquo; the light green clothed woman commented.</p><p>Servants continued to gossip, &ldquo;Well, the girl may think she&rsquo;s very clever. The boy may keep her here forever.&rdquo;</p><p>However, sacred bone and servants alike agreed, &ldquo;But I can tell you this: They&rsquo;ll never stand before a priest!&rdquo;</p><p>As Yoongi finished getting ready, I explained how our lives would be once we were a happily married couple. Every day with him would be happy because we were in love. We were together just as the Gods had willed. Just like we would be until we died.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;and we&rsquo;ll have a little house with pink walls and a blue roof. And a tree in a garden just like the one that used to shelter me as a child. Then you and I can lie under the shade of the tree~&rdquo; I sprawled across the fine bedclothes.</p><p>My love Yoongi moved to sit, so I rolled on my side.</p><p>&ldquo;And then our children will climb it.&rdquo;</p><p>He stood with a start and looked at me. Maybe he hadn&rsquo;t thought that far, but it would happen. We&rsquo;d have children. I&rsquo;d bear as many as he wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;And it will be ours, forever.&rdquo; I looked at him with wide and innocent eyes.</p><p>He gave me a sweet smirk and moved to a mirror to tie his cream colored bowtie. Yoongi began to talk about how he loved me. I folded my legs and kicked them out to lie on the bed once more.</p><p>=================<br /></p><p>I, Min Yoongi, son of a well known sacred bone, making me a sacred bone as well, continued to get ready for tonight&rsquo;s ball, &ldquo;Some girls take hours to paint every perfect nail&hellip;Fragrant as flowers all powdered and prim and pale; but you are as wild as that wind-blown tree. As dark and as deep as the midnight sea. While they&rsquo;re busy dressing, you lie here warm and bold~&rdquo;</p><p>This girl who had shown up out of nowhere claiming to have healed my body </p><p>I said as I finished doing his tie and moving on to fixing my color and suspenders. &ldquo;Some girls you picture. Some you hold.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at me him still in awe, innocence in your loving gaze. I thought about what my father said and continued, &ldquo;Some girls take courses at all the best schools in France; riding their horses and learning their modern dance. They&rsquo;re clever and cultured and worldly-wise, but you see the world through a child&rsquo;s wide eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>I used hair wax to make my black strands stay in place. &ldquo;While their dreams are grand ones. You want what&rsquo;s just in reach.&rdquo; Jamie wanted so much. Everything material, expensive, wanted what her parents raised her to want.</p><p>My smile couldn&rsquo;t be contained as I wiped my hands on a towel, &ldquo;Some girls you learn from. Some you teach. You are not small talk or shiny cars or mirrors or French cologne.&rdquo; I sprayed a bit on myself since it had become routine for me, and you didn&rsquo;t seem to hate it.</p><p>&ldquo;You are the river, the moon, the stars: You&rsquo;re no one else I&rsquo;ve known&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You tilted your head to get me to tell you more.</p><p>I replied, &ldquo;Some girls take pleasure in buying a fine trousseau. Counting each treasure and tying each tiny bow. They fold up their futures with perfumed hands while you face the future with no demands. Some girls expect things others think nothing of.&rdquo;</p><p>Then I turned to look at the door knowing my fiancee was just down the hall, &ldquo;Some girls you marry.&rdquo; Because there was no other choice. My eyes met yours, &ldquo;Some you love~&rdquo;</p><p>I loved you. Ever since you came into my room telling stories that I still wasn&rsquo;t sure were true, but I didn&rsquo;t care because my heart wanted you. (Y/N) was my happiness. You could never betray me for riches because you didn&rsquo;t want anything but me.</p><hr /><p>Beautiful light music filled the grand hall as Yoongi greeted guests who congratulated him on his upcoming wedding with Jamie but whispered about him once he was gone. Large crystal chandeliers lit up the dance floor and the candlelit tables were attended by servants in the hotel uniforms. Flower petals cascaded from the ceiling and onto the floor. Laughter echoed off the walls.<br /></p><p>The Sacred Bones at the Hotel Holly, dancing to their own little tune. Waiting to see&hellip; (Y/N)!</p><p>Jamie in her golden dress approached her husband to be who was probably on the lookout for his mistress. Jamie had not the&hellip;pleasure of seeing her. Yoongi spent all his hours with her other than the times she was sleeping and he had to to talk to her about their upcoming wedding.</p><p>&ldquo;Some girls are saying she&rsquo;s simple as any child.&rdquo; She said with her arms folded.</p><p>He sighed, &ldquo;Please, Jamie&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t stop talking about the rumors, &ldquo;Barefoot and praying and running the halls quite wild!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jamie&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And is she as pretty as we&rsquo;ve all heard? Your own pretty&hellip;Well, what&rsquo;s the word?&rdquo;</p><p>They noticed all the heads turning to see a girl with a red hibiscus flower crown and an extravagant red dress to match. It was me. I approached Yoongi eagerly and relieved to see him looking at me, completely smitten with me.</p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi~!&rdquo; I slowed when I saw him beside another woman.</p><p>&ldquo;So this is your (Y/N). How beautiful she is.&rdquo; She looked at me.</p><p>My love introduced us, &ldquo;(Y/N), this is Gongju-nim Jamie. Jamie, this is (Y/N).&rdquo;</p><p>A woman I did not know bowed to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy to meet you, my dear lady. I&rsquo;ve heard you&rsquo;re a healer and a dancer, as well. Won&rsquo;t you dance for us now? Won&rsquo;t you give us a show?<br />Please, dear girl&hellip;Don&rsquo;t say no.&rdquo;</p><p>I looked at Yoongi who held my hands, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, (Y/N). Dance as you always do&hellip; Just for me.&rdquo;</p><p>I stood in the center of the room and began the dance I had known since I was a child. My feet nearly came from under me since I was not accustomed to dancing with shoes on my feet. So I took them off, but the familiar looking servants refused to take them from me. Hiding their faces and moving away. Then a man approached and took the bejeweled slippers from me.</p><p>Then I returned to my spot and felt the eyes on my. Looking around, it seemed as though I held the attention of the whole room.</p><p>In a tune that felt like home, one of the serving woman sang, &ldquo;We dance~&rdquo;</p><p>As if by magic, the song came into my heart, &ldquo;We dance~&rdquo;</p><p>WE DANCE!</p><p>My feet began to move to the music played by dark faces. I had danced as I always did to a song that I hadn&rsquo;t heard in what felt like years. My skirt fanned out around me with every spin, and I noticed the pale pink of a hotel maid twirling next to mine. She must&rsquo;ve gotten permission from her bosses. Eventually emerald green flew in rhythm with the legs of tailored suits.</p><p>The island blood could be hidden with powders and creams but it pulsed nonetheless. Guests clapped and cheered along to the tune as our reet moved to the rapid drums. Even my Yoongi joined in for the last bit. I really had taught him well. All the air in my lungs had gone through my feet, so I was panting hard once the song ended. My love held my hands for a moment before I went to retrieve my shoes but was stopped by an important looking man.</p><p>=================</p><p>Jamie was upset as she pulled Yoongi to the side. Everyone was back in their places. Their roles&hellip;except (Y/N) and Jamie&rsquo;s husband to be who had let this go on long enough.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s very clear. She&rsquo;s in love with you. Yoongi, if you care, if you care at all, you must tell her.&rdquo;</p><p>You came back to your Min Yoongi with a large dazzling smile on your face, &ldquo;Yoongi! Oh, the Ambassador said I was beautiful!!&rdquo;</p><p>=================</p><p>I was giddy and joyful after dancing in front of so many people and getting so many compliments afterwards. I forgot about my shoes and went to tell the man who loved me.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone is so happy that I&rsquo;m here with you!&rdquo;</p><p>Something was off.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I searched Jamie&rsquo;s and Yoongi&rsquo;s faces for an answer.</p><p>She waited for him to speak, but was the one to talk when he didn&rsquo;t. Jamie held my hands with affectionate concern.</p><p>Jamie, with her dazzling gold crown to match her dress spoke firmly, &ldquo;My dear dear girl, I have something to say. Something I fear was left unsaid. Many thanks for all you&rsquo;ve given Yoongi, but do not be misled. My dear Mademoiselle, you dance so very well. I pray you&rsquo;ll dance for Yoongi and for me when we are wed&hellip;&rdquo; She let go at my shocked expression. &ldquo;(Y/N), Yoongi and I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>She looked at me and at him. Wed? Her? Jamie was to wed my&hellip;my Yoongi? I felt my heart sink.</p><p>He tried to explain, &ldquo;Jamie and I have been promised to each other since we were children. This is how things are done, (Y/N). It&rsquo;s expected.&rdquo;</p><p>I wanted to cry, &ldquo;Yoongi-ah, please&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There will always be a place for you here&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Jamie decided it was best to give us space and left to talk with guests.</p><p>But our dream. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll race away in a car&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t change who I am or where I&rsquo;m from.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash; As silver as the moon&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi shook his head, &ldquo;I wish it could be so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We will live beside the sea. We&rsquo;ll have children, a garden, and a tree&hellip;&rdquo; I held him tightly.</p><p>He held me away from him, &ldquo;I thought you understood. We could never marry.&rdquo;</p><p>We could&hellip;never? Yoongi took off the necklace I had given him and placed it in my hands. Then he went back to the main room to continue being a part of the party. I was on the balcony, alone with my broken heart.</p><p>I called out to the gods once again with my whole heart, &ldquo;Oh, gods. Oh, gods, Are you there? Are you there&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>All the whispers from before and even after travelling to be with him swarmed in my head. &ldquo;Blacker than coal and low as dirt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What has that boy done to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know what he sees in a woman like that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look how she bathes him and touches and protects him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to have the gods to repay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The gods to repay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The gods to repay!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Gods to repay!!&rdquo;</p><p>The Gods to repay!<br /></p><p>Jeongyeon appeared before me and everything went dead silent. She smirked at my current state of weakness. It&rsquo;s as if the rattle of a snake was inside of me as Death slithered closer to me.</p><p>&ldquo;There were promises made in the darkness; promises made in your sleep; promises the gods demand you keep!&rdquo; She darted at me but I moved out of the way, &ldquo;You gave him love. Love he would soon betray!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stay away!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You gave him life. I am the price you&rsquo;ll pay!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure as the grave. You must accept what is&hellip;Now your life is forever mine&hellip;&rdquo; Death held a knife to my throat.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t want to die! &ldquo;Please, DON&rsquo;T!!!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Trade yours for his&hellip;&rdquo; Jeongyeon said, removing the knife from my throat.</p><p>&ldquo;W-What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You saved him. You loved him. And he betrayed you. Why should you die for him now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Kill him, (Y/N). Kill the love~ you feel for him. Prove that <b><i>death is stronger than love</i></b> and you can have your own life again. Just as if you had never loved at all.&rdquo; She handed me the blade. </p><p>Death pulled him closer to me, &ldquo;I am the road leading to no return&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>A song that I had heard before was sung between her words, but it was so quiet in comparison, <i>&ldquo;The courage of a dreamer&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Secret of life finally his to learn&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;You are part&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p>I had to choose. I could kill him. Easily. He wasn&rsquo;t even looking. No one noticed the dagger in my hand as I approached him from behind. Things could go back to normal. I&rsquo;d return to my own life just as Jeongyeon had promised. Just as if I had never loved at all.</p><p>&ldquo;I am the car racing toward distant shores&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;d be able to <i>step </i>get rid of the pain <i>step </i>that HE caused! <i>Step</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Part of the human heart&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p>He was right there. Yoongi hadn&rsquo;t noticed me yet. I had to do it now.</p><p>&ldquo;Now his life is forever mine&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>I raised the knife to sink between his shoulder blades.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>And I dropped it, &ldquo;<i>I can&rsquo;t!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>People gasped and Yoongi turned with wide eyes to see me kneeling on the floor with tears streaming down my face. He stared at the knife. No matter how much he had hurt me by keeping the truth about his marriage a secret&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi&hellip;I <i>love </i>you.&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head, &ldquo;You tried to <i>kill </i>me!&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>And so you were cast out of the Hotel Holly, your dress and chest being thrown into the sandy dirt. The gates slammed shut behind you.</p><p>Your eyes saw a couple on the other side you called out to them, &ldquo;I am Miss (Y/N). I am the Mistress of Min Yoongi!&rdquo;</p><p>If that was the only thing you could be to him, then you&rsquo;d wear the title. As long as you could be near him. The couple ignored you. A man passed by who recognized you.</p><p>He held your hand through the iron bars as you said, &ldquo;I was the one who danced at the ball!&rdquo;</p><p>You wore a beautiful (and clean) dress.</p><p>&ldquo;The people applauded!<i> All eyes were on me!!!!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>He ran off at your outburst. Another Sacred Bone came passed.</p><p>&ldquo;The Gods sent me! They sent me be with him!&rdquo;</p><p>And another.</p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi needs me! He loves me!&rdquo;</p><p>It was his father who scoffed.</p><p>&ldquo;Without me, he&rsquo;ll die!&rdquo; You spouted old phrases, ones you had used to get here in the first place.</p><p>It was still the truth still! Right? Even though you had healed him. Almost tried to kill him by literally stabbing him in the back.</p><p>&ldquo;Surely&hellip;surely there has been a terrible mistake.&rdquo; You said to yourself as the sun started to tint the sky pink. &ldquo;He must be wondering where I am.&rdquo;</p><p>Fruitlessly, you called to the couple you saw before as they were now returning to the hotel.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell him&hellip;tell him I am here. Tell him (Y/N) is waiting for him at the gate!&rdquo;</p><p>And so you did. For two weeks you did wait at the gate. Not sleeping. Not eating. Only waiting. Only watching as the grounds were made even more beautiful in preparation for the wedding. Even as Yoongi as Jamie were getting married.</p><p>As superstition dictated, they came to the gates of the Hotel to throw coins to the peasants thus assuring that their own fortunes would multiply. He was there with her dressed in white. You tried reaching out and waving to him, but he did not see.</p><p>Until you called his name, throat dry from having no water for a while, &ldquo;Yoongi!&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes finally met yours as Jamie walked away. Yoongi approached you and held your hands. Through the gate, he gave you coins since you had none. You hadn&rsquo;t tried to get any. There was forgiveness in his eyes. He still loved you? But you didn&rsquo;t want coins. You wanted him! Your beautiful love kissed the tops of both your hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi~?&rdquo; Jamie called from a distance, not knowing when he left her side.</p><p>He gave you one more look and then went back to his wife. You let the gold coin fall, heart completely broken. You laid on the ground and died. Your mother finding you too late. She had come just to try and pay you a visit.</p><p>Eomma Taeyong held your body and mourned, &ldquo;Oh, (Y/N). Oh, (Y/N). You will always be a part of us. Oh, (Y/N).&rdquo;</p><p>Your father and the towns people took your body home as your soul rose out of it. Everyone mourned the loss of the girl with big dreams. Who they had raised. Who they had loved and still did to be honest.</p><p>&ldquo;You will always be a part of us. Oh, (Y/N)&hellip;Oooh&hellip;&rdquo; They hummed as they set you down and buried your body.</p><p>And the gods began to cry tears of compassion for the orphan (Y/N) who proved that love could withstand the storm and cross the earth and survive even in the face of death. Jimin took you by the hand and led you to the sea where Key wrapped you in a wave and laid you to your rest. Jeongyeon was gentle as she carried you to shore, and Ros&eacute; accepted you and held you to her breast.</p><p>And then, the gods blessed you, and transformed you into&hellip;A tree!</p><p>A tree that sprang up and cracked the walls of the Hotel Holly, so that its gates could never close again. A tree that lived forever, sheltering peasants and Sacred Bone alike. A tree that watched over Yoongi for his lifetime&hellip;in which his children played.</p><p>And one day, as Yoongi&rsquo;s young son sat in the shade of the tree, he noticed a beautiful young peasant girl high in its branches, looking out at the world. And the spirit of (Y/N) touched their hearts and set them free&hellip;to love!</p><p>People sang about your legacy.</p><p>A man with strong arms touched the tree to feel your spirit, &ldquo;And she stands against the lightning and the thunder. And she shelters and protects us from above.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And she fills us with the power and the wonder.&rdquo; Said a Sacred Bone who had come to visit.</p><p>&ldquo;Of her love&hellip;&rdquo; Yoongi&rsquo;s son with a bunny smile commented while holding his crush&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>And this is why we tell the story. Why we tell the story. Why we tell the story.</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon touched the tree, &ldquo;If you listen very hard you&rsquo;ll hear her call us&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To come share with her our laughter and our tears.&rdquo; Appa Shindong put his arm around her.</p><p>And as mysteries and miracles befall us through the years, we tell the story! We tell the story!</p><p>&ldquo;Life is why we tell the story!&rdquo; Ros&eacute; said.</p><p>&ldquo;Pain is why we tell the story!&rdquo; Jeongyeon added holding her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Love is why we tell the story!&rdquo; Jimin claimed.</p><p>&ldquo;Grief is why we tell the story!&rdquo; Key suggested while messing up Jimin&rsquo;s hair.</p><p>A villager with a pink tank top agreed, but also said, &ldquo;Hope is why we tell the story!&rdquo;</p><p>Another with wide hips added, &ldquo;Faith is why we tell the story!&rdquo;</p><p>Then everyone looked at the little girl, &ldquo;You are whyyyyyy Why we tell the story. Why-y we tell the story~Why we tell the story. Why-y we tell the story!&rdquo; While dancing a new dance.<br /><br />Jimin tapped the little girl&rsquo;s nose, &ldquo;So I hope that you will tell this tale tomorrow. It will help your heart remember and relive.&rdquo;</p><p>Eomma Taeyeon grinned, &ldquo;It will help you feel the anger and the sorrow&hellip;&rdquo; and turned the girl towards the tree.</p><p>Where you floated down from the branches, &ldquo;And forgive&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You kissed her forehead and pet her head while everyone including you sand, &ldquo;For out of what we live and we believe, our lives become the stories that we weave.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone got around the girl who began to speak and you returned to your tree, &ldquo;There is an island where rivers run deep&hellip; Where the sea sparkling in the sun earns it the name &lsquo;Jewel of the Antilles&rsquo; An island where the poorest of peasants labor&hellip; And the wealthiest of Sacred Bone play. And on this island, we tell the story!&rdquo;</p><p>We told the story~<br /></p><hr /><p>Thank you for reading! What musical would you like to see k-popified next?</p>",
