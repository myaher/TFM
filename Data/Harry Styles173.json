I didn&rsquo;t mean for any of this happen.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell you did a pretty shit job of making sure this isn\u2019t how things played out,\u201d you struggle to tell him as it feels like an invisible weight is residing on your chest; causing your breaths to come out hitched and uneven.\u00a0\u201cGod, it\u2019s like I don&rsquo;t even know you anymore Harry.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know me anymore?\u201d He asks, lowering his voice into a whisper as hurt flashes over his perfectly structured features.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still me, Y/N. I\u2019m\u00a0still your best friend, and I\u2019m still\u00a0the man who is in lov-.\u201d<br/></p><p>You narrow your teary gaze at him as he cuts himself off before completing his sentence; letting out a small sarcastic laugh and shaking your head as he doesn\u2019t finish his argument.\u00a0\u201cThe man who is what, Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who is in <i>love</i> with you,\u201d he states, as his eyes pleadingly stare into yours.\u00a0\u201cFuck. I don&rsquo;t know why it\u2019s taken me so long to say that, and I know now is not the best timing but-.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo Harry,\u201d you speak over him and shake your head.\u00a0\u201cIf you\u2019re saying this because we had sex, you can take it back right now.\u201d His eyes widen at your words, and you let out another laugh; mainly at yourself this time.\u00a0\u201cAnd the funny thing is&hellip; If you told me that a month ago, before any of this happened; I would&rsquo;ve believed you. Why? Because\u00a0I love you Harry, I always have. I figured agreeing to do this whole thing would help me muster up the courage to <i>finally</i> tell you that, and hell there even was a point where I thought you might\u2019ve\u00a0actually felt the same. And maybe you do, but your career comes first. It will always come first, which is ok - but because of that; this can&rsquo;t happen. We can&rsquo;t happen.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about that and you know it,\u201d he argues, stepping forward so he can be closer to you.\u00a0\u201cWe can happen. Y/N, I do love you. I have for years now, it\u2019s not like\u00a0I&rsquo;ve tried to hide it. I can\u2019t imagine myself with anyone else at this point&hellip; We were made for each other.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWere we? Because everything that has gone on in our lives as of late would beg to differ.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWho cares about any of that? I don\u2019t,\u201d he explains desperately as he reaches out to gently grab ahold of your hands, and rubs his thumbs across your knuckles.\u00a0\u201cThis relationship may have started out as a publicity stunt, but it\u2019s not like that anymore and it never should have been. Everything I told you the other night in the hotel room is real, <i>this</i> is real Y/N&hellip; I need you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd I need you H,\u201d you whisper, watching as a small glimmer of hope flashes through his eyes.\u00a0\u201cBut not like this.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible Harry,\u201d you state, and that glint of hope slowly fades away from his gaze as you pause to collect your thoughts.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve always said things happen for a reason right? Everything that has happened because of this stunt is adding up to a bigger picture, and it\u2019s clear that us being together isn&rsquo;t part of that. Who are we to change anything about what fate has in store? Everything keeps us apart, and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about that.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe can try,\u201d he says quietly in one final plea.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point. I\u2019m sorry Harry, it\u2019s out of our hands.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He looks at you with an expression you\u2019ve rarely seen in the years you\u2019ve known him; complete and utter defeat, and that hurts like a bitch. But you have to do this, you have to leave so things fall back into order for him and for you. \u00a0</p><p>With one final shaky breath and a sniffle, you slowly move away from him to start leaving again; and this time he lets\u00a0you go.\u00a0</p><p>Taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_zkOpOkuuOk8RfJbhzZGYQ\">@trulymadlysydney</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1_9q12X0gHoggeBZzCHgeQ\">@writingsfromlee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhf8dINbmrPLdvlPy50LZjA\">@isitjamiemoriarty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfw3DYi7lBb6vwgFCAoMXkw\">@smokeinherperfume</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhtayn5WnNlRHHG8U7FG03A\">@foreverhlessed</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp1pFk9bhKh1jZIZ80Z2hiA\">@silklaurentharry</a> because these poor souls have had to listen to me go OFF about this.
