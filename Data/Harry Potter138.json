The lights were on on the ground floor, and as he stood there, he recognised the flickering of a <i>nox</i> darkening a room on the first floor. Definitely, wizards were living here, and considering he had checked the address twice, those wizards were Neville and Pansy. Still, he couldn\u2019t knock at the navy blue door. </p><p>As Theodorre Nott opened it, he found himself nose to nose with the blond boy he had barely ever talked to.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Harry blurted, caught short.</p><p>\u201cPotter. Come in, they\u2019re waiting for you.</p><p>-Er, thanks.\u201d He said. Visiting his friend shouldn\u2019t make him a trainwreck, but he was. He has spent the last fifteen minutes with his hand hovering against the wooden door, wondering why, and why not. He got the idea, Neville and Pansy were living happily in a muggle suburb; he was practically used to it by now. But finding himself in front of their house made everything slowly scattered down to pieces.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy yourself.\u201d Nott added, stepping outside, slowly closing the door behind him.</p><p>The navy blue door seemed to have led him to an alternate universe. The staircase in front of him was covered in fake spider webs and a plastic skeleton sat in the second step. At the end of the corridor, whose walls were covered with framed pictures, he could see a glowing sign <i>This way to the Ministry of Magic </i>hanging above a white door. But there was no doubt he really was in Neville\u2019s house as he heard his laughter coming from the only other door of the room.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019re here!\u201d His friend welcomed him warmly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came.</p><p>-I said I will.\u201d He smiled back as Neville hugged him. \u201cWhat is that all about?\u201d Harry asked, waving toward the skeleton and spiders.</p><p>\u201cHalloween\u2019s decoration. It\u2019s muggle.\u201d He added, shrugging joyfully. \u201cI don\u2019t totally get it but it has something to do with evil spirits or something. I\u2019ll find something about it at the library tomorrow and I\u2019ll owl you if you want. Now come in, you gotta meet Pansy.\u201d</p><p>The living room was barely separated from the kitchen and dining room by a wall of climbing plants. On the bookshelves in front of him were dozen of magical plants he knew from his dorm at Hogwarts. Their universe suddenly seemed less more distant and far more welcoming.</p><p>On the other side of the vine, he could see Pansy disposing plates on the table, arranging the cutlery. She seemed nervous, too. </p><p>\u201cHi, Harry.\u201d She greeted, crossing the vine. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>Even if they\u2019ve crossed path during Malfoy\u2019s trial, it seemed to Harry that he hadn\u2019t see the girl in ages. She had cut her long brown hair to her shoulder and dyed them shades lighter; and even though her lips were still as red as before, he had never see her smile that kindly.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you, too.\u201d He said, strangely honest. Maybe it was the look in her eyes, the way she absentmindedly touched her prominent belly or glanced toward Neville when she did so, but his stomach settled down. Pansy had passed the test.\u00a0</p><p>Thank you for reading ! <a href=\"https://sweetlialia.tumblr.com/post/181703412400/someone-new-part-2\">part 2</a></p><p><b><i>And if you&rsquo;ve got time, why not give a look at the <a href=\"https://sweetlialia.tumblr.com/post/181294704093/a-new-home-chapter-1\">1st chapter </a>?
