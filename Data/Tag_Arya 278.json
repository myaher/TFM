        "answer": "<p>Yeah. Game of Thrones fandom remains Extra when it comes to female characters.<br/><br/>In regards to Arya specifically though so many people misunderstand her character. She doesn\u2019t lack empathy, or is unfeeling or some serial killer. She\u2019s a child who has gone from one traumatic experience to another and had to adapt or die. The view that Arya doesn\u2019t want a relationship ever is myopic and willfully misunderstanding. <br/><br/>Arya doesn\u2019t want to become what she\u2019s seen happen to so many other women in her life. She would\u2019ve grown up knowing that Catlyn only married Ned because Brandon was killed by the Mad King. Her existence was dependent on the murder of her uncle. She would\u2019ve grown up hearing how Rhaegar abducted and raped Lyanna which resulted in her death. Robert\u2019s prolific infedility to Cersei was not a secret by any means. Her sister was abused by Joffery, used by Littlefinger, married off to Tyrion because it was useful to Tywin and in the show she\u2019s raped by Ramsey. Do people think these things wouldn\u2019t affect her? That society wouldn\u2019t color Arya\u2019s views on highborn marriages? Even if Ned and Catlyn\u2019s own marriage turned out unexpectedly well there was still the cloud of the fact that Ned apparently had a bastard son the same age as his trueborn son.\u00a0</p><p>All of this and then people wonder why Arya doesn\u2019t want to be married to some random ass lord. Arya wants to make her own destiny and choose for herself what she wants from life.\u00a0<br/><br/>As for Arya and Gendry. To me, all signs point to this being a romantic relationship. Narratively they hit all the tropes and in the show they frame it as such. I think the reason there wasn\u2019t a reunion or any mention of Arya by Gendry to either Jon or the Hound is because they want to hold out on the payoff until the very last season. Arya\u2019s experiences haven\u2019t tarnished her, haven\u2019t made her unlovable, or made her not want love in return. So. All in all. These people who think and believe that Arya is some sort of badass killing machine and that\u2019s all she could ever or want to be is \u2014 well, it\u2019s sad to me.</p>",

I think that not even entertaining the possibility that Arya could find romantic partner in her life (when both books and show have given her a potential love interest) stems from the sexist belief \u00a0that tomboy girls aren\u2019t interested in romance \u00a0and much worse that they aren\u2019t capable to inspire love because of their interests. Thankfully, Martin doesn\u2019t share this opinion as he has written female \u00a0who don\u2019t adhere to patriarchal standards of how women should behave who still are interested in romance/marry/have children. A good example would be \u00a0Visenya and Rhaenys Targaryen, the very women Arya admired, who were both warrior ladies and also married and became mothers. Same can be said about Brienne of Tarth and Daenerys Targaryen from the current timeline. Both ladies participate in battles and that didn\u2019t stopped them from falling in love with someone.</p><p>Usually, when someone wants to support the opinion that Arya is disinterested in romance they bring up this quote:</p><blockquote><p>\n\nArya cocked her head to one side. &ldquo;Can I be a king&rsquo;s councilor and build castles and become the High Septon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, &ldquo;will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya screwed up her face.\u00a0<b>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; </b>she said, <b>&ldquo;that&rsquo;s Sansa.&quot;\u00a0</b></p></blockquote><p>First of all, let me begin by saying that Arya is only nine years old during that conversation with Ned. She\u2019s too young to know the concept of romantic love- and of course she had never been in love up to that point. I think we should take with \u00a0grain of salt what a kid says about marriage. Opinions change through the years and Arya isn\u2019t the same child she was back in book 1/season 1.\u00a0</p><p>Furthermore, in this specific quote she doesn\u2019t even reject the concept of finding a loving partner. She rejects being what the patriarchal standards of Westeros want her to be: a ladywife whose only worth can be measured by her husband/sons\u2019 achievements. She has some ambitions of her own and she has every right to do so.\u00a0</p><p>Some people (although I admit that thankfully not many) also bring up her lack of enthusiasm for romantic tales as evidence that she won\u2019t experience love. Which doesn\u2019t make sense. Just because someone doesn\u2019t care about romance in the stories they consume that doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t want someone to love and love them in return.\u00a0</p><p>In conclusion, Arya is totally capable of falling in love (like every other person) and it\u2019s not impossible for her to have a love interest as part of her endgame. After all, her story is full of romantic undertones (but this I guess is a topic for another post :\u2019D).</p>",

I think that not even entertaining the possibility that Arya could find romantic partner in her life (when both books and show have given her a potential love interest) stems from the sexist belief \u00a0that tomboy girls aren\u2019t interested in romance \u00a0and much worse that they aren\u2019t capable to inspire love because of their interests. Thankfully, Martin doesn\u2019t share this opinion as he has written female \u00a0who don\u2019t adhere to patriarchal standards of how women should behave who still are interested in romance/marry/have children. A good example would be \u00a0Visenya and Rhaenys Targaryen, the very women Arya admired, who were both warrior ladies and also married and became mothers. Same can be said about Brienne of Tarth and Daenerys Targaryen from the current timeline. Both ladies participate in battles and that didn\u2019t stopped them from falling in love with someone.</p><p>Usually, when someone wants to support the opinion that Arya is disinterested in romance they bring up this quote:</p><blockquote><p>\n\nArya cocked her head to one side. \u201cCan I be a king\u2019s councilor and build castles and become the High Septon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, \u201cwill marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.\u201d</p><p>Arya screwed up her face.\u00a0<b>\u201cNo,\u201d </b>she said, <b>\u201cthat\u2019s Sansa.\"\u00a0</b></p></blockquote><p>First of all, let me begin by saying that Arya is only nine years old during that conversation with Ned. She\u2019s too young to know the concept of romantic love- and of course she had never been in love up to that point. I think we should take with \u00a0grain of salt what a kid says about marriage. Opinions change through the years and Arya isn\u2019t the same child she was back in book 1/season 1.\u00a0</p><p>Furthermore, in this specific quote she doesn\u2019t even reject the concept of finding a loving partner. She rejects being what the patriarchal standards of Westeros want her to be: a ladywife whose only worth can be measured by her husband/sons\u2019 achievements. She has some ambitions of her own and she has every right to do so.\u00a0</p><p>Some people (although I admit that thankfully not many) also bring up her lack of enthusiasm for romantic tales as evidence that she won\u2019t experience love.
