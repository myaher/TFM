Below is the descriptions of what Shades of the Evening (the blue drink Dany is given before entering the HOTu and what Euron drinks) tastes like vs. what Weirwood paste taste like (the red drink given to Bran by the Children of the Forest). <br/></p><h2><b>Shades of the Evening &amp; Weirwood Paste</b></h2><p><b><i>\u201cDany raised the glass to her lips. The first sip tasted like ink and spoiled meat, foul, but when she swallowed, it seemed to come to life within her. She could feel tendrils spreading through her chest, like fingers of fire coiling around her heart, and on her tongue the </i></b><b><i>taste was like honey</i></b><b><i> and anise and cream, like mother\u2019s milk and Drogo\u2019s seed, like red meat and hot blood and molten gold. It was like all the tastes she had ever known, and none of them \u2026 and then the glass was empty.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cIt had a bitter taste, though not so bitter as the acorn paste.

        "body": "<p>In \u2018<i>The\nLion and the Rose</i>\u2019, Bran stops at a weirwood Heart Tree beyond the Wall and\nhe has his first vision cluster (the video for the whole thing can be watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gh0-4hOzyw\">here</a>). While this vision\ncluster should be seen as a whole, as it actually metaphorically shows the same\nthing as the other prophetic vision Bran has later. The first two major subsets\nare the most developed, with the other two major subsets just a hint for what\u2019s\nto come, as those will be expanded through other visions Bran will have.</p><p>This cluster vision is a set of eighteen distinct\nvideo clips, with about half of them being repurposed from past scenes (though\nthere are a few new ones). This can be divided into four mutually exclusive\nsubsets, as they are punctuated by an audio-visual cue: a black fade-out and a\nwhite flash-in, followed by a drum-like sound effect (this audio-visual cue is\nused recurrently from that point forward when Bran trips out). These divisions\nactually neatly list what things Bran is going to be looking at each season from\nthis point forth.</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> I attach a few observations with # before them at the end of each\nsection, these are just speculation based on things and not really part of this\nexercise.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"6400\" data-orig-height=\"721\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/31c113b590979cab013f6ed5ca69f667/tumblr_inline_pke2s2Pnvy1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"6400\" data-orig-height=\"721\"/></figure><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; <i>subtle</i><br/></p><!-- more --><h2>\n\nFIRST VISION : hero journey\n\n</h2><p>The first vision is composed of four clips,\ndetailing Bran\u2019s hero journey in season 4 (Bran didn\u2019t feature in season 5, he\nwas just \u201ctraining\u201d, so it doesn\u2019t matter I know, urgh). This one is the\neasiest to understand in its full implications, since most of it has come to\npass already and they\u2019re the most straightforward.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c27bf97d09a6766716dbd4486656919/tumblr_inline_pke1gwWIFX1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p>The first two clips show where Bran must go,\nthe Three-Eyed Raven Cave. The first clip is a weirwood Heart Tree over a cave\nentrance, which is how the place proper is depicted, and the second clip is a\nmyriad of roots crisscrossing, typical of the inside layout of said cave. These\ntwo are very upfront, the real deal looks exactly like that after all.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2dc03e6f23ac3240c4a2d0ed121b0ada/tumblr_inline_pke1hb5jaz1rrj926_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p>The third clip shows who Bran will meet and\nwho he will become, the Three-Eyed Raven. The show introduces the novel concept\nthat the Three-Eyed Raven is both <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE6qT8OckB0\">Brynden Rivers</a>\nand <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliN5IyD0wI&amp;t=1m11s\">Bran Stark</a>\n(chalking up any ???? as \u201c<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek_BcOj_Tgg\">difficult to explain</a></i>\u201d\nalso known as, this is never getting explained in the show, forget about it).\nObviously, neither of them is a raven with three eyes, but that\u2019s their\nsymbolic figure which everyone associates with these two characters anyway\n(#A).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6a9925aa012187982dc7a969743cfee8/tumblr_inline_pke1iezVAe1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p>The fourth clip show what Bran will learn\nat the cave, to look into the past. There\u2019s a close-up to the raven\u2019s claw taking\nimpulse and taking off, a reference to the jumping and flying motif that Bran\nhas (more apparent in the books, but the show kept Brynden saying \u201c<i>you\u2019ll never walk again, but you will fly</i>\u201d).\nThen, the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, metaphorical travelling through\ntime as that\u2019s a funerary crypt, representative of the past. As a side-note, the\nfact that these are the Winterfell Crypts, where all Starks are buried, is\nsuggestive that the past that he\u2019s going to be looking into is tied to House Stark.</p><p><b>#A:</b> Rivers is identified as the Three-Eyed <i>Crow</i>, though he has raven messengers instead. Unless this is a case\nof the show changing book concepts because the dumb general audience might get\nconfused (Asha being renamed Yara, so she won\u2019t be confounded with Osha), then\nthis suggests that a mashup streamlining took place somewhere.</p><p>In the books, this suggests that Bran\u2019s\nfinal form is the Three-Eyed <i>Raven</i>,\nbecause he\u2019s the important character in the narrative, as well as Bran surpassing\nRivers as a greenseer, since ravens are portrayed as superior to crows. Furthermore, it \u00a0suggests that Rivers will die in the cave\nwhile Bran will go back to Winterfell, since \u201ccrows\u201d (Brothers of the Night\u2019s\nWatch) are bound to the Wall for life (the roots of the Three-Eyed Cave are\nshackles for Rivers as well) while ravens (messenger ravens) are taken to other\nplaces inside cages (Bran too is bound as a cripple and has to be taken\nsomewhere by others) but will fly home when released. Moreover, it suggests that the abnormal\ntalking raven at the Wall has something to do with this streamlining, since he\nhas been linked to Rivers before (at least once, in <i>Jon I ~ ADWD</i>), yet he was cut entirely from the show (and only an\nidiot wouldn\u2019t add a talking bird, <a href=\"https://ohmy.disney.com/quiz/2015/06/28/quiz-which-disney-animal-sidekick-are-you/\">which\nhas huge potential in turning into a mascot and sell ridiculous amounts of\nmerchandise</a>, unless the gains were bigger than the losses)</p><h2>\n\nSECOND VISION : past\n\n</h2><p>The second vision is composed of nine clips,\ndetailing what Bran is going to be looking at in season 6. This one can be\ndivided into two major groups, one centred in Ned and one centred in the White\nWalkers, for the sake of simplification that is what I did. They\u2019re actually\npretty extra and pretty stupid if taken at first value (and this episode was\nwritten by GRRM, so that\u2019s unlikely), so they beg the viewer to put their\ntinfoil hat on and analyse the epileptic trees, so I did.</p><p>\n\n<b>EDDARD STARK\n\n</b></p><p>The first two clips show Eddard Stark and\nhis role in R+L=J, roughly corresponding to Bran\u2019s three flashbacks about his\nfather\u2019s past which all feature Lyanna. Though separated by the audio-visual\ncue, these clips follow the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, which highly\nsuggested that the visions that would follow would be about House Stark,\nspecifically of people that were buried there. Accordingly, these two clips are\nabout Ned as well as Lyanna, which are both Starks buried at the Winterfell\nCrypts.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d96eda3c1733179e699bbc2bd894a963/tumblr_inline_pke1ktATtA1rrj926_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p>The fifth clip is Ned sharpening Ice, an\nallegory for Ned\u2019s going to war for the sake of his sister. To sharpen a sword\nis to prepare it for battle and adding this scene specifically is especially glaring\nbecause Ice is a Valyrian steel sword which doesn\u2019t need to be sharpened in the\nfirst place (they also bothered to film a new scene instead of repurposing the\nclip where Ned cleans Ice with an oilcloth from the very first episode - <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TpwBWyZ.png\">even their hands are switched</a> - because\nthat thematic wouldn\u2019t fit). It corresponds to Bran\u2019s Winterfell flasback in \u2018<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yBz54ql-u0\">Home</a></i>\u2019, where Ned is\nsparring with Benjen (training for battle) and Lyanna shows up to hang out for\na bit (highlighting the bond between the siblings), as well as Bran\u2019s first Tower\nof Joy flashback in \u2018<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aO_CsqfBAo\">Oathbreaker</a></i>\u2019, where Ned\nfights against the Kingsguard with the objective of rescuing Lyanna \n(B1)\n\n.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/37fad0d846ad719ca5d16e05fb0eb8df/tumblr_inline_pke1n8jp9t1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"288\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdb32f1ab4fcb43f3b6933651b9dd790/tumblr_inline_pke1r1vTjr1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"288\"/></figure><p>The sixth clip feature Ned while he\u2019s\nimprisoned at the Black Cells in King\u2019s Landing, the fire bursting to life in\nthe background and reflected in his eyes (#B2); an allegory of Ned witnessing\nJon\u2019s birth (he is half a fire child after all, I know, urgh, poor boy) and\nhis promise to Lyanna which has held him \u201ccaptive\u201d for half of his life (this\nbinding motif is more obvious in the books, as Ned thinks about Lyanna and this\npromise frequently). It corresponds to Bran\u2019s flashback in \u2018<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiiP9JX1wHw\">The Winds of Winter</a></i>\u2019,\nwhere Ned goes up the staircase as Lyanna is screaming from giving birth (her\ndress is also bloody, which means she just did it, otherwise she would\u2019ve been\ncleaned by whatever attendant there) as well as Lyanna asking Ned to protect the\nnew-born Jon.<br/></p><p><b>#B1:</b> I was told that the original script for this would be more extensive, including \na scene with<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_and_the_Rose#cite_note-Vanity_Fair_article-6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bran&rsquo;s\nuncle Benjen and Lyanna Stark as children, so one more notch on the bedpost</a>.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>#B2:</b> There\u2019s some eye thing going here. The fire is reflected in Ned\u2019s\neyes, the correspondent scene has a focus on Jon\u2019s eyes both as a baby and as an\nadult (even in the scripts). It\u2019s worth noting that in the show, they changed Jon\u2019s\neye-colour from grey (like Ned\u2019s) to brown (and cast Lyanna with brown eyes).\nThere might be something dumb about eye-colour in season 8.</p><p>\n\n<b>WHITE WALKERS\n\n</b></p><p>The following four clips show stuff from\nBeyond the Wall, corresponding to Bran\u2019s flashbacks about the Night King / White\nWalkers / Wights. These are presented differently from the ones with Ned,\nbecause they need to establish a time context which wasn\u2019t needed with him (we\nknew when he lived). They do so through the visual cue of the sun travelling\nthrough the sky in the background of the weirwood Heart Three over the Three-Eyed\nCave (like the \u201ctime machine\u201d that they\u2019re \u201ctravelling\u201d on). This tree motif is\nrepeated in subsequent visions for the same reasons.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c78c38a6d2d07fe4d13f53c261d7820c/tumblr_inline_pke1syLqzI1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa63e0657bee4dde3b76225a2ceeaa18/tumblr_inline_pke1z1uhEc1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p>The seventh clip is a frozen wasteland, with\nreally busy clouds in the sky and the sunrise with the sun hanging really low while it goes from\n\u201cright to left\u201d, which is an allegory for time going back in the \u201ctrue north\u201d\nduring winter (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXxRcXHI_tI\">a very <i>good</i> one</a>). It follows with the\nThree-Eyed Cave entrance with the sun on the very far left after having\ntravelled from \u201cright to left\u201d, which is an allegory for having reached the \u201cvery\nbeginning\u201d of something (<a href=\"https://d1e4pidl3fu268.cloudfront.net/ae28ea75-a594-4816-9d4a-b18397ff34eb/DTGraphs.crop_265x199_10%2C0.preview.png\">a very <i>bad</i> one</a>, as a physics major this offends\nme). In other words, Bran is going to look very far into the past for what\ncomes next (B2).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/629644be55b0872759ee79560b18cbe1/tumblr_inline_pke205VENS1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/078b9b41daeb61a4856278f7a1bfdd4e/tumblr_inline_pke219Zgdc1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p>The eight clip is a raven landing on a branch\nfollowed by the face of a weirwood Heart Tree and the tenth clip is the myriad\nof roots crisscrossing once again, which shows how they\u2019re going to do what\u2019s\nin the aforementioned paragraph, the Three-Eyed Raven(s) are going to use the\nWeirwood Network (#C). Sandwiched between them, the ninth clip is the very first\nwight we see properly in this series in \u2018<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gWSe5PIP7Y&amp;t=5m50s\">Winter is Coming</a></i>\u2019\n(and a murder of ravens flying through the forest), which establishes what they\u2019re\ngoing to be looking at the \u201cvery beginning\u201d, the origins of the Night King / White\nWalkers / Wights. It corresponds to Bran\u2019s flashback seeing the creation of the\nNight King in \u2018<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtS9PPMK_WQ\">The Door</a></i>\u2019 (B3).</p><p><b>#B2:</b> The eight and tenth clip aren\u2019t redundant as it may seem on first\napproach. At the time those visions were shown, the audience \u201cdoesn\u2019t know\u201d how\nthese visions are being accessed (yes, Bran touched the tree, but nothing else\u2026\nand the show audience should be \u201cflying blind\u201d without the book information). It\nalso suggests that while all visions are being accessed through the Weirwood\nNetwork, the ones for the Night King\u2019s visions were accessible because they are\n\u201crecorded\u201d within the network (the raven touches the tree), Ned\u2019s visions were accessible\ndue to being buried in the Winterfell Crypts which the Winterfell\u2019s weirwood Heart\nTree most likely is connected to (the raven goes through the Winterfell Crypts).</p><p><b>#B3:</b> Bran <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtS9PPMK_WQ&amp;t=3m\">returns\nhere</a> shortly after and there is <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mvqFXOB.jpg\">this</a>\ngesture, which may either be a signal that the pact was broken by men and / or\nthat the Night King seeks the pact once again.</p><h2>\n\nTHIRD VISION : present\n\n</h2><p>The third vision is composed of three clips,\nthe first sets timing which is the present and the other two set the focus subjects,\nwhich also detail how Bran uses his powers in season 7.

There\u2019s a close-up to the raven\u2019s claw taking\nimpulse and taking off, a reference to the jumping and flying motif that Bran\nhas (more apparent in the books, but the show kept Brynden saying \u201c<i>you\u2019ll never walk again, but you will fly</i>\u201d).\nThen, the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, metaphorical travelling through\ntime as that\u2019s a funerary crypt, representative of the past. As a side-note, the\nfact that these are the Winterfell Crypts, where all Starks are buried, is\nsuggestive that the past that he\u2019s going to be looking into is tied to House Stark.</p><p><b>#A:</b> Rivers is identified as the Three-Eyed <i>Crow</i>, though he has raven messengers instead. Unless this is a case\nof the show changing book concepts because the dumb general audience might get\nconfused (Asha being renamed Yara, so she won\u2019t be confounded with Osha), then\nthis suggests that a mashup streamlining took place somewhere.</p><p>In the books, this suggests that Bran\u2019s\nfinal form is the Three-Eyed <i>Raven</i>,\nbecause he\u2019s the important character in the narrative, as well as Bran surpassing\nRivers as a greenseer, since ravens are portrayed as superior to crows. Furthermore, it \u00a0suggests that Rivers will die in the cave\nwhile Bran will go back to Winterfell, since \u201ccrows\u201d (Brothers of the Night\u2019s\nWatch) are bound to the Wall for life (the roots of the Three-Eyed Cave are\nshackles for Rivers as well) while ravens (messenger ravens) are taken to other\nplaces inside cages (Bran too is bound as a cripple and has to be taken\nsomewhere by others) but will fly home when released. Moreover, it suggests that the abnormal\ntalking raven at the Wall has something to do with this streamlining, since he\nhas been linked to Rivers before (at least once, in <i>Jon I ~ ADWD</i>), yet he was cut entirely from the show (and only an\nidiot wouldn\u2019t add a talking bird, <a href=\"https://ohmy.disney.com/quiz/2015/06/28/quiz-which-disney-animal-sidekick-are-you/\">which\nhas huge potential in turning into a mascot and sell ridiculous amounts of\nmerchandise</a>, unless the gains were bigger than the losses)</p><h2>\n\nSECOND VISION : past\n\n</h2><p>The second vision is composed of nine clips,\ndetailing what Bran is going to be looking at in season 6. This one can be\ndivided into two major groups, one centred in Ned and one centred in the White\nWalkers, for the sake of simplification that is what I did. They\u2019re actually\npretty extra and pretty stupid if taken at first value (and this episode was\nwritten by GRRM, so that\u2019s unlikely), so they beg the viewer to put their\ntinfoil hat on and analyse the epileptic trees, so I did.</p><p>\n\n<b>EDDARD STARK\n\n</b></p><p>The first two clips show Eddard Stark and\nhis role in R+L=J, roughly corresponding to Bran\u2019s three flashbacks about his\nfather\u2019s past which all feature Lyanna. Though separated by the audio-visual\ncue, these clips follow the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, which highly\nsuggested that the visions that would follow would be about House Stark,\nspecifically of people that were buried there. Accordingly, these two clips are\nabout Ned as well as Lyanna, which are both Starks buried at the Winterfell\nCrypts.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d96eda3c1733179e699bbc2bd894a963/tumblr_inline_pke1ktATtA1rrj926_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><p>The fifth clip is Ned sharpening Ice, an\nallegory for Ned\u2019s going to war for the sake of his sister. To sharpen a sword\nis to prepare it for battle and adding this scene specifically is especially glaring\nbecause Ice is a Valyrian steel sword which doesn\u2019t need to be sharpened in the\nfirst place (they also bothered to film a new scene instead of repurposing the\nclip where Ned cleans Ice with an oilcloth from the very first episode - <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TpwBWyZ.png\">even their hands are switched</a> - because\nthat thematic wouldn\u2019t fit).

It\u2019s worth noting that in the show, they changed Jon\u2019s\neye-colour from grey (like Ned\u2019s) to brown (and cast Lyanna with brown eyes).\nThere might be something dumb about eye-colour in season 8.</p><p>\n\n<b>WHITE WALKERS\n\n</b></p><p>The following four clips show stuff from\nBeyond the Wall, corresponding to Bran\u2019s flashbacks about the Night King / White\nWalkers / Wights. These are presented differently from the ones with Ned,\nbecause they need to establish a time context which wasn\u2019t needed with him (we\nknew when he lived). They do so through the visual cue of the sun travelling\nthrough the sky in the background of the weirwood Heart Three over the Three-Eyed\nCave (like the \u201ctime machine\u201d that they\u2019re \u201ctravelling\u201d on).

At the time those visions were shown, the audience \u201cdoesn\u2019t know\u201d how\nthese visions are being accessed (yes, Bran touched the tree, but nothing else\u2026\nand the show audience should be \u201cflying blind\u201d without the book information). It\nalso suggests that while all visions are being accessed through the Weirwood\nNetwork, the ones for the Night King\u2019s visions were accessible because they are\n\u201crecorded\u201d within the network (the raven touches the tree), Ned\u2019s visions were accessible\ndue to being buried in the Winterfell Crypts which the Winterfell\u2019s weirwood Heart\nTree most likely is connected to (the raven goes through the Winterfell Crypts).</p><p><b>#B3:</b> Bran <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtS9PPMK_WQ&amp;t=3m\">returns\nhere</a> shortly after and there is <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mvqFXOB.jpg\">this</a>\ngesture, which may either be a signal that the pact was broken by men and / or\nthat the Night King seeks the pact once again.</p><h2>\n\nTHIRD VISION : present\n\n</h2><p>The third vision is composed of three clips,\nthe first sets timing which is the present and the other two set the focus subjects,\nwhich also detail how Bran uses his powers in season 7.

There\u2019s a close-up to the raven\u2019s claw taking\nimpulse and taking off, a reference to the jumping and flying motif that Bran\nhas (more apparent in the books, but the show kept Brynden saying \u201c<i>you\u2019ll never walk again, but you will fly</i>\u201d).\nThen, the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, metaphorical travelling through\ntime as that\u2019s a funerary crypt, representative of the past. As a side-note, the\nfact that these are the Winterfell Crypts, where all Starks are buried, is\nsuggestive that the past that he\u2019s going to be looking into is tied to House Stark.</p><p><b>#A:</b> Rivers is identified as the Three-Eyed <i>Crow</i>, though he has raven messengers instead. Unless this is a case\nof the show changing book concepts because the dumb general audience might get\nconfused (Asha being renamed Yara, so she won\u2019t be confounded with Osha), then\nthis suggests that a mashup streamlining took place somewhere.</p><p>In the books, this suggests that Bran\u2019s\nfinal form is the Three-Eyed <i>Raven</i>,\nbecause he\u2019s the important character in the narrative, as well as Bran surpassing\nRivers as a greenseer, since ravens are portrayed as superior to crows. Furthermore, it \u00a0suggests that Rivers will die in the cave\nwhile Bran will go back to Winterfell, since \u201ccrows\u201d (Brothers of the Night\u2019s\nWatch) are bound to the Wall for life (the roots of the Three-Eyed Cave are\nshackles for Rivers as well) while ravens (messenger ravens) are taken to other\nplaces inside cages (Bran too is bound as a cripple and has to be taken\nsomewhere by others) but will fly home when released. Moreover, it suggests that the abnormal\ntalking raven at the Wall has something to do with this streamlining, since he\nhas been linked to Rivers before (at least once, in <i>Jon I ~ ADWD</i>), yet he was cut entirely from the show (and only an\nidiot wouldn\u2019t add a talking bird, <a href=\"https://ohmy.disney.com/quiz/2015/06/28/quiz-which-disney-animal-sidekick-are-you/\">which\nhas huge potential in turning into a mascot and sell ridiculous amounts of\nmerchandise</a>, unless the gains were bigger than the losses)</p><h2>\n\nSECOND VISION : past\n\n</h2><p>The second vision is composed of nine clips,\ndetailing what Bran is going to be looking at in season 6. This one can be\ndivided into two major groups, one centred in Ned and one centred in the White\nWalkers, for the sake of simplification that is what I did. They\u2019re actually\npretty extra and pretty stupid if taken at first value (and this episode was\nwritten by GRRM, so that\u2019s unlikely), so they beg the viewer to put their\ntinfoil hat on and analyse the epileptic trees, so I did.</p><p>\n\n<b>EDDARD STARK\n\n</b></p><p>The first two clips show Eddard Stark and\nhis role in R+L=J, roughly corresponding to Bran\u2019s three flashbacks about his\nfather\u2019s past which all feature Lyanna. Though separated by the audio-visual\ncue, these clips follow the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, which highly\nsuggested that the visions that would follow would be about House Stark,\nspecifically of people that were buried there. Accordingly, these two clips are\nabout Ned as well as Lyanna, which are both Starks buried at the Winterfell\nCrypts.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d96eda3c1733179e699bbc2bd894a963/tumblr_inline_pke1ktATtA1rrj926_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><p>The fifth clip is Ned sharpening Ice, an\nallegory for Ned\u2019s going to war for the sake of his sister. To sharpen a sword\nis to prepare it for battle and adding this scene specifically is especially glaring\nbecause Ice is a Valyrian steel sword which doesn\u2019t need to be sharpened in the\nfirst place (they also bothered to film a new scene instead of repurposing the\nclip where Ned cleans Ice with an oilcloth from the very first episode - <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TpwBWyZ.png\">even their hands are switched</a> - because\nthat thematic wouldn\u2019t fit).

It corresponds to Bran\u2019s flashback in \u2018<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiiP9JX1wHw\">The Winds of Winter</a></i>\u2019,\nwhere Ned goes up the staircase as Lyanna is screaming from giving birth (her\ndress is also bloody, which means she just did it, otherwise she would\u2019ve been\ncleaned by whatever attendant there) as well as Lyanna asking Ned to protect the\nnew-born Jon.<br></p><p><b>#B1:</b> I was told that the original script for this would be more extensive, including \na scene with<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_and_the_Rose#cite_note-Vanity_Fair_article-6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bran\u2019s\nuncle Benjen and Lyanna Stark as children, so one more notch on the bedpost</a>.<b><br></b></p><p><b>#B2:</b> There\u2019s some eye thing going here. The fire is reflected in Ned\u2019s\neyes, the correspondent scene has a focus on Jon\u2019s eyes both as a baby and as an\nadult (even in the scripts). It\u2019s worth noting that in the show, they changed Jon\u2019s\neye-colour from grey (like Ned\u2019s) to brown (and cast Lyanna with brown eyes).\nThere might be something dumb about eye-colour in season 8.</p><p>\n\n<b>WHITE WALKERS\n\n</b></p><p>The following four clips show stuff from\nBeyond the Wall, corresponding to Bran\u2019s flashbacks about the Night King / White\nWalkers / Wights.

There&rsquo;s a close-up to the raven&rsquo;s claw taking\nimpulse and taking off, a reference to the jumping and flying motif that Bran\nhas (more apparent in the books, but the show kept Brynden saying &ldquo;<i>you&rsquo;ll never walk again, but you will fly</i>&rdquo;).\nThen, the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, metaphorical travelling through\ntime as that&rsquo;s a funerary crypt, representative of the past. As a side-note, the\nfact that these are the Winterfell Crypts, where all Starks are buried, is\nsuggestive that the past that he&rsquo;s going to be looking into is tied to House Stark.</p><p><b>#A:</b> Rivers is identified as the Three-Eyed <i>Crow</i>, though he has raven messengers instead. Unless this is a case\nof the show changing book concepts because the dumb general audience might get\nconfused (Asha being renamed Yara, so she won&rsquo;t be confounded with Osha), then\nthis suggests that a mashup streamlining took place somewhere.</p><p>In the books, this suggests that Bran&rsquo;s\nfinal form is the Three-Eyed <i>Raven</i>,\nbecause he&rsquo;s the important character in the narrative, as well as Bran surpassing\nRivers as a greenseer, since ravens are portrayed as superior to crows. Furthermore, it &nbsp;suggests that Rivers will die in the cave\nwhile Bran will go back to Winterfell, since &ldquo;crows&rdquo; (Brothers of the Night&rsquo;s\nWatch) are bound to the Wall for life (the roots of the Three-Eyed Cave are\nshackles for Rivers as well) while ravens (messenger ravens) are taken to other\nplaces inside cages (Bran too is bound as a cripple and has to be taken\nsomewhere by others) but will fly home when released. Moreover, it suggests that the abnormal\ntalking raven at the Wall has something to do with this streamlining, since he\nhas been linked to Rivers before (at least once, in <i>Jon I ~ ADWD</i>), yet he was cut entirely from the show (and only an\nidiot wouldn&rsquo;t add a talking bird, <a href=\"https://ohmy.disney.com/quiz/2015/06/28/quiz-which-disney-animal-sidekick-are-you/\">which\nhas huge potential in turning into a mascot and sell ridiculous amounts of\nmerchandise</a>, unless the gains were bigger than the losses)</p><h2>\n\nSECOND VISION : past\n\n</h2><p>The second vision is composed of nine clips,\ndetailing what Bran is going to be looking at in season 6. This one can be\ndivided into two major groups, one centred in Ned and one centred in the White\nWalkers, for the sake of simplification that is what I did. They&rsquo;re actually\npretty extra and pretty stupid if taken at first value (and this episode was\nwritten by GRRM, so that&rsquo;s unlikely), so they beg the viewer to put their\ntinfoil hat on and analyse the epileptic trees, so I did.</p><p>\n\n<b>EDDARD STARK\n\n</b></p><p>The first two clips show Eddard Stark and\nhis role in R+L=J, roughly corresponding to Bran&rsquo;s three flashbacks about his\nfather&rsquo;s past which all feature Lyanna. Though separated by the audio-visual\ncue, these clips follow the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, which highly\nsuggested that the visions that would follow would be about House Stark,\nspecifically of people that were buried there. Accordingly, these two clips are\nabout Ned as well as Lyanna, which are both Starks buried at the Winterfell\nCrypts.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d96eda3c1733179e699bbc2bd894a963/tumblr_inline_pke1ktATtA1rrj926_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The fifth clip is Ned sharpening Ice, an\nallegory for Ned&rsquo;s going to war for the sake of his sister. To sharpen a sword\nis to prepare it for battle and adding this scene specifically is especially glaring\nbecause Ice is a Valyrian steel sword which doesn&rsquo;t need to be sharpened in the\nfirst place (they also bothered to film a new scene instead of repurposing the\nclip where Ned cleans Ice with an oilcloth from the very first episode - <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TpwBWyZ.png\">even their hands are switched</a> - because\nthat thematic wouldn&rsquo;t fit).

They do so through the visual cue of the sun travelling\nthrough the sky in the background of the weirwood Heart Three over the Three-Eyed\nCave (like the &ldquo;time machine&rdquo; that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;travelling&rdquo; on).

Sandwiched between them, the ninth clip is the very first\nwight we see properly in this series in &lsquo;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gWSe5PIP7Y&amp;t=5m50s\">Winter is Coming</a></i>&rsquo;\n(and a murder of ravens flying through the forest), which establishes what they&rsquo;re\ngoing to be looking at the &ldquo;very beginning&rdquo;, the origins of the Night King / White\nWalkers / Wights. It corresponds to Bran&rsquo;s flashback seeing the creation of the\nNight King in &lsquo;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtS9PPMK_WQ\">The Door</a></i>&rsquo; (B3).</p><p><b>#B2:</b> The eight and tenth clip aren&rsquo;t redundant as it may seem on first\napproach. At the time those visions were shown, the audience &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t know&rdquo; how\nthese visions are being accessed (yes, Bran touched the tree, but nothing else&hellip;\nand the show audience should be &ldquo;flying blind&rdquo; without the book information). It\nalso suggests that while all visions are being accessed through the Weirwood\nNetwork, the ones for the Night King&rsquo;s visions were accessible because they are\n&ldquo;recorded&rdquo; within the network (the raven touches the tree), Ned&rsquo;s visions were accessible\ndue to being buried in the Winterfell Crypts which the Winterfell&rsquo;s weirwood Heart\nTree most likely is connected to (the raven goes through the Winterfell Crypts).</p><p><b>#B3:</b> Bran <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtS9PPMK_WQ&amp;t=3m\">returns\nhere</a> shortly after and there is <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mvqFXOB.jpg\">this</a>\ngesture, which may either be a signal that the pact was broken by men and / or\nthat the Night King seeks the pact once again.</p><h2>\n\nTHIRD VISION : present\n\n</h2><p>The third vision is composed of three clips,\nthe first sets timing which is the present and the other two set the focus subjects,\nwhich also detail how Bran uses his powers in season 7. He actually wasn&rsquo;t\nshown using his powers much in season 7 on-screen (most of what he did was\noff-screen), but when he did use them on-screen, it was to understand these two\npresent predicaments.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cea39c0064900cb76aca4b1b7a60212a/tumblr_inline_pke23jASQJ1rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The eleventh clip is the Three-Eyed Cave entrance\nwith the sun travelling from &ldquo;left to right&rdquo; and stopping behind it (right in\nthe centre of the screen), which signals time is going to the present once again.\nIn other words, Bran is going to look through the Weirwood Network because of\npresent predicaments.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2eab772c86332a43754a35f21dd3e934/tumblr_inline_pke251v0qI1rrj926_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The twelfth clip is a wight horse, symbolical\nof the Night King / White Walkers / Wight marching south to invade Westeros. The\nhorse imagery alone is representative of movement and it could&rsquo;ve actually stop\nthere, but the whole scene of &lsquo;<i><a href=\"http://Valar%20Morghulis\">Valar Morghulis</a></i>&rsquo; from where it was repurposed\nfrom shows the army of White Walkers / Wights marching south which reinforces\nthis point even further. It corresponds to Bran checking out the army of Night\nKing / White Walkers / Wights progress in &lsquo;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MiQrzadfOg\">Dragonstone</a></i>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnLMOFSfijs\">Eastwatch</a></i>&rsquo;.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5171844e8de072bece8cd94a21f7cd01/tumblr_inline_pke25ccUrY1rrj926_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The thirteenth clip is a very long shot of\nthe Iron Throne covered in snow, allegorical of Jon as the true heir to the Iron\nThrone. This scene is similar to Danielle&rsquo;s vision in the House of the Undying in\n&lsquo;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gulVUWrADCM\">Valar Morghulis</a></i>&rsquo;, but\nit&rsquo;s actually a new scene which deliberately excludes Danielle&rsquo;s presence. For\nthe sake of production, the graphic montages for both were probably produced at\nthe same time and they mean the exact same thing: Jon Snow is the legitimate\nand undisputable heir to the Iron Throne, Danielle has no part in it whatsoever.\nIt corresponds to Bran checking out Jon&rsquo;s true heritage as heir to the Iron\nThrone in &lsquo;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joiio_GJksA\">The Dragon and the Wolf</a></i>&rsquo;.</p><h2>FOURTH VISION : future\n\n</h2><p>The fourth vision is composed of six clips,\ndetailing the two wars to come in season 8 and for those, Bran will be instrumental: the one\nagainst Night King / Others and the one against Danielle / Dragons. This is &lsquo;<i>The Song of<b> Ice</b> and <b>Fire</b></i>&rsquo;.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af1527e29f240e77dd9fd4597a56ead7/tumblr_inline_pke2abDcMJ1rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The fourteenth clip is the Night King seen\nthrough the broken ice, which is symbolical of the struggle against the destructive\nforce of ice (I don&rsquo;t recognise the inspiration for this, but some horror movie maybe). The sixteenth clip is a dragon flying over King&rsquo;s Landing, which\nis symbolical of the struggle against the destructive force of fire (now this&hellip; I recognise the inspiration for <i>this</i> &#128745;&#65039;). &lsquo;Some say the world will end in fire<i>, some say in ice&hellip; *blah blah*</i>&rsquo;\nThese conflicts are both expanded upon in a subsequent Bran vision in &lsquo;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBJE9oCWldU\">Blood of my Blood</a></i>&rsquo;.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/daa3437bb342f9e731182e0d101043d2/tumblr_inline_pke2duGhCK1rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The fifteenth clip is a raven flying and\nBran falling down the Broken Tower, with the seventeenth clip continuing the aforementioned\nfall. On one hand and visually, Bran falling down the Broken Tower is put\nbetween the fourteenth and sixteenth clip and eighteenth clip. On the other hand\nand audibly, Cersei&rsquo;s voice saying &lsquo;he saw us&rsquo; is superimposed with the fourteenth\nand Bran&rsquo;s screaming (this is not his original scream as a child in that scene,\nit was something they added specifically for this cluster vision and it&rsquo;s his\nvoice as a teenager) leaks into the screaming dragon.</p><p>These two clips reference back to Jaime throwing\nBran out of the window, after the kid saw him having sex with Cersei, as well\nas the near death-experience that allowed him to become the Three-Eyed Raven. All\nof this suggests that Jaime may have a major role to play in the conflict (interestingly,\nhe features a LOT in that subsequent Bran vision in &lsquo;<i>Blood of my Blood</i>&rsquo;), but most importantly that Bran and his\ngreenseer powers will be instrumental in these two wars (D1).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad670ce75eb0155414f82dcd7107a562/tumblr_inline_pke2h5x9Sn1rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The eighteenth clip is the Three-Eyed Cave\nentrance with the sun travelling from &ldquo;left to right&rdquo; from the centre to the\nright (towards the &ldquo;end&rdquo; of the screen), which is an allegory for time going into\nthe future. It&rsquo;s worth noting that this doesn&rsquo;t come at the beginning of each\nsubset, after the audio-visual cue, but right at the very end of <i>everything</i> (D2).</p><p><b>D1:</b> The audio cues are intriguing. The first suggests that Bran &lsquo;<i>seeing</i>&rsquo; will resolve the conflict with the\nNight King / White Walkers / Wights and we know that in his case, &lsquo;<i>seeing</i>&rsquo; also means looking into the past\nand learning things that resolve the present. The second suggests that Bran &lsquo;<i>screaming</i>&rsquo; will resolve the conflict\nwith Danielle / dragons, which sounds dumb until you realise the sound of Bran &lsquo;<i>screaming</i>&rsquo; leaks into the sound of dragon&rsquo;s\n&lsquo;<i>screeching</i>&rsquo; and we know that in his\ncase, a human-animal transition also means skinchanging (and &ldquo;<i>you&rsquo;ll never walk again, but you will fly</i>&rdquo;\nas well as Bran&rsquo;s wish to be a knight and he can be a <i>dragonknight</i> &#10024;).</p><p><b>D2:</b> This shtick of the sun travelling from &ldquo;left to right&rdquo; is the\nequivalent of a day, with the sunrise at the left and the sunset at the right.\nIn this vision cluster, the sunrise was used to lynchpin the origins of Night\nKing / White Walkers / Wights and which is also known as <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Long_Night#The_War_for_the_Dawn\">The\nWar for the Dawn</a>, while the sunset comes after <i>everything</i>, The &ldquo;day&rdquo; started after a Long Night and as such, this suggests\nthat another Long Night is coming again at the end of Game of Thrones.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>In &lsquo;<i>The\nLion and the Rose</i>&rsquo;, Bran stops at a weirwood Heart Tree beyond the Wall and\nhe has his first vision cluster (the video for the whole thing can be watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gh0-4hOzyw\">here</a>). While this vision\ncluster should be seen as a whole, as it actually metaphorically shows the same\nthing as the other prophetic vision Bran has later. The first two major subsets\nare the most developed, with the other two major subsets just a hint for what&rsquo;s\nto come, as those will be expanded through other visions Bran will have.</p>\n<p>This cluster vision is a set of eighteen distinct\nvideo clips, with about half of them being repurposed from past scenes (though\nthere are a few new ones). This can be divided into four mutually exclusive\nsubsets, as they are punctuated by an audio-visual cue: a black fade-out and a\nwhite flash-in, followed by a drum-like sound effect (this audio-visual cue is\nused recurrently from that point forward when Bran trips out). These divisions\nactually neatly list what things Bran is going to be looking at each season from\nthis point forth.</p>\n<p><b>NOTE:</b> I attach a few observations with # before them at the end of each\nsection, these are just speculation based on things and not really part of this\nexercise.</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/31c113b590979cab013f6ed5ca69f667/tumblr_inline_pke2s2Pnvy1rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; <i>subtle</i><br /></p>\n</p>",
