There were no cars driving, no people in asking about. Running to his room, he tried to figure out what to bring. He threw on a heavy coat, and went to grab his gun before hesitating. Bucky shook his head and stuffed the gun into his pocket before sprinting all the way to the lower floor. </p><p>Barging through the door, he was hit by a blast of cold air. All around snow had built up, and where he was standing it was up to his knees. He could barely see 3 feet in front of him as snow heavily rained down.</p><p>\u201cShit&hellip;\u201d he cursed quietly. </p><p>Pulling the tower door shut, he made his way down the drive. Putting everything he had into shifting the thick piles of snow. </p><p>He didn\u2019t know where to go. Where would you go? You could be anywhere and the city was huge! Grumbling, he made his way in a random direction hoping it would lead him to you. All along the way there, he could see half covered snow men that children must have made first loving the snow. The power was off, there was no lights. Everything was just black. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N)?!\u201d He yelled, hoping it would work.</p><p>Nothing. Sighing heavily, Bucky carried on. He wasn\u2019t going to stop until he found you. </p><p>Minutes ticked by and he was walking along side a large building when he heard it. Rustling, spinning around he waited, but nothing happened so he carried on his way. Only to hear it again, spinning around there was still nothing there. That\u2019s when he spotted it, a light in the distance getting closer. </p><p>It got closer and closer until something kicked him down into the snow. Sending it flying upwards. On top of him was something warm and light.

There were no cars driving, no people in asking about. Running to his room, he tried to figure out what to bring. He threw on a heavy coat, and went to grab his gun before hesitating. Bucky shook his head and stuffed the gun into his pocket before sprinting all the way to the lower floor. </p><p>Barging through the door, he was hit by a blast of cold air. All around snow had built up, and where he was standing it was up to his knees. He could barely see 3 feet in front of him as snow heavily rained down.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit&hellip;&rdquo; he cursed quietly. </p><p>Pulling the tower door shut, he made his way down the drive. Putting everything he had into shifting the thick piles of snow. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know where to go. Where would you go? You could be anywhere and the city was huge! Grumbling, he made his way in a random direction hoping it would lead him to you. All along the way there, he could see half covered snow men that children must have made first loving the snow. The power was off, there was no lights. Everything was just black. </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)?!&rdquo; He yelled, hoping it would work.</p><p>Nothing. Sighing heavily, Bucky carried on. He wasn&rsquo;t going to stop until he found you. </p><p>Minutes ticked by and he was walking along side a large building when he heard it. Rustling, spinning around he waited, but nothing happened so he carried on his way. Only to hear it again, spinning around there was still nothing there. That&rsquo;s when he spotted it, a light in the distance getting closer. </p><p>It got closer and closer until something kicked him down into the snow. Sending it flying upwards. On top of him was something warm and light. Opening an eye, he gasped. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey bud!&rdquo; He laughed. </p><p>It was your dog, his flaming body wasn&rsquo;t hot enough to melt the snow but it was hot enough to warm up Buckys freezing body. The dog licked his face causing Bucky to laugh even more. He was beyond happy, this could be how he finds you, not only that but he could finally see in front of himself. </p><p>The dog got of, jumping around and yipping. Waiting for Bucky to get up before diving into the snow and jumping back out causing Bucky to laugh again. Sure, it was a bad situation, but a good laugh was what he needed to lift his hopes up. Kneeling down, Bucky took the dogs flaming head between his hands, glancing around before looking back at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Where is she? Where&rsquo;s (Y/N)?&rdquo; </p><p>The dog whined, before it turned around and begun to run the way it had came from. Occasionally stopping to let Bucky catch up before running off again. After what felt like hours of running through the snow, Bucky finally fell to his knees, the cold was getting to much for him and his lungs ached. </p><p>The dog, which he had decided to name Bud, licked his face and let out a whine, laying on the snow next to him. The freezing air stung Buckys lungs. He laid down, facing the sky as he watched his breath flow up. The snow fell down, covering him in little white specks, if someone wasn&rsquo;t looking closely he would have looked dead, with his pale skin, his slow breathing. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can keep this up Bud.&rdquo; He sighed. </p><p>Bud whined again and crawled closer, nudging Bucky with his nose. Letting out another sigh, Bucky closed his eyes, his body felt like it was failing him, and he was ready to let it all go when he heard shouting. </p><p>&ldquo;Bucky!&hellip;.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Steve!?&rdquo; </p><p>Shooting up, Bucky held Bud, the crunching of snow now reached his ears and Steve came into view. Dropping to his knees in front of his best friend. Nat and Clint followed behind and did the same thing. Occupying themselves with the dog.</p><p>&ldquo;We found you&hellip;&rdquo; he gasped.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are the others?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Back at the tower, we came out to try find out.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky nodded, getting a better look at his friend, he couldn&rsquo;t help but snicker. The snicker soon growing into full blown laughter much to Steve&rsquo;s confusment. Bucky triedto contain his amusement but he couldn&rsquo;t, and laughter shook his body. Nat and Clint took one look at Steve and noticed it to.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You um&hellip; you have a&hellip;&rdquo; Bucky pointed just above Steve&rsquo;s lip Where somehow he managed to gain a snowtash.</p><p>Steve chuckled, wiping it away as he waited for Bucky to calm down. It took a while, Bucky hadn&rsquo;t laughed like that for ages but he was finally calm and ready to be serious.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to head back, it&rsquo;s not safe.&rdquo; Steve sighed, rubbing his hands up and down his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&hellip; I can&rsquo;t leave her out here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Buck, you&rsquo;ll freeze. Jarvis said you left hours ago! We thought you would have froze to death by now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would have if it weren&rsquo;t for Bud.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve glanced at the dog but didn&rsquo;t say anything. Clint shuffled forward, only his eyes were visible through the heavy clothing he wore.</p><p>&ldquo;Fury called us, he&rsquo;s-&ldquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what he said!&rdquo; Bucky snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;Barnes it&rsquo;s not-&ldquo; </p><p>Nat was cut off by Bud jumping up growling and barking behind Bucky. Turning around, he pulled out his gun, praying it wasn&rsquo;t as he took aim. A figure slowly walked forward, before stopping just outside the lights reach. But they could see the eyes, Bucky knew them eyes.
