But I can\u2019t even begin to get into that right now because what the hell is happening here . </p><p>Like this is such bullshit . This is a children\u2019s book . Not a comic book . Not a movie . Not anything geared at an adult audience. We\u2019re talking a children\u2019s book for children and grown men probably 20-40 or so are mad that it exists . Because for some reason they feel girls are gonna know it\u2019s ok to be a girl and girls can be superheroes too and we don\u2019t need to \u201c overdo it \u201c but also want to apply that to every female role model that could possibly exist so no actually I think we do need to . </p><p>You wanna say there\u2019s great female role models in movies / there\u2019s plenty/ too many / whatever bullshit people want to say but name one that wasn\u2019t just immediately shot down for existing . </p><p>Rey exists in Star Wars and for \u201c unrelated reasons\u201d or because \u201c we get the point let\u2019s get back to a male protagonist \u201c the new Star Wars movies get a ton of shit all the time </p><p>Captain marvel comes out and people want to say oh sure it\u2019s ok to like girl characters but do we have to make a whole \u201c thing \u201c out of it ? Why can\u2019t it be considered a thing just to make a movie . You don\u2019t see a male main character and call it a thing or a primarily white cast and call it a thing or a movie without lgbt representation and call it a thing . But the second a movie like love Simon or black panther or captain marvel comes out somehow it\u2019s inherently different than those other movies ? Somehow it\u2019s a \u201c thing \u201c now . </p><p>How any of these people can expect little girls to look up to someone who\u2019s like them and a real hero when the whole world says nothing but bad things about that hero for nothing other than her gender is so beyond stupid that I just  can\u2019t understand . And if your standard for \u201c getting the point \u201c is having 2 or 3 female led movies then how about you let us \u201c get the point \u201c about male led movies and you stop making those because of it . Your logic doesn\u2019t make sense either way . </p><p>This is probably a long post already but whatever . This is just so beyond frustrating . I really don\u2019t know what else to say about it I\u2019m just fed up with people who get the entire world to tell them they\u2019re great and the second someone says \u201c girls are great \u201c they feel that pointless need to chime in \u201c but can\u2019t I be great too ? \u201c </p><p>You can only be great if you can be accepting , no honestly that\u2019s not even the right word , you shouldn\u2019t have to accept that maybe women and men  and everyone of every gender no matter what they identify as should be equal it should just be common knowledge . So you can only be great if you have the slightest shred of common sense . </p>",
