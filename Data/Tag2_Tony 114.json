Clint rose and made a few steps back, removed shirt and pants, much to Tony\u2019s delight, concentrated and lifted the glamour he used to keep his true nature hidden.

Slowly and carefully he touched Clint\u2019s hip. \u201cSoft,\u201d he murmured. The fur was silky and Tony let his fingers run through it. </p><p>\u201cCan you please say something?\u201d Clint whispered. Tony looked up at him, licked his lips and then closed the distance between them and kissed him. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Clint,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, you\u2019re not human. Who cares? You have hooves and horns and that adorable little tail but\u2026 you\u2019re still you and\u2026 I love you.\u201d </p><p>Clint felt a tear of happiness run over his face. </p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he said.

It was the first time in centuries that he was with someone who was more than just a fling but before it got serious he had to tell him. Tony was awesome and he loved him and he didn\u2019t want to start a relationship with a lie. </p><p>When he heard the knock he almost jumped out of his skin but then he went to the door and opened it. Tony stood outside and smiled when he saw him. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Clint said and stepped aside. \u201cCome in.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Tony said, his voice low and seductive and he reached for Clint\u2019s hand. \u201cMissed me?\u201d They went for a coffee earlier that day and since then Clint had paced and deliberated if and how he should tell Tony. But it was important that he knew who Clint was. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d he started and stopped, when he saw tiny wrinkles appear on Tony\u2019s forehead. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u2026 I\u2026 I just have to tell you something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Tony said. He didn\u2019t let go of his hands and Clint led him over to the couch where they both sat down. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something you should know and\u2026\u201d he took a deep breath. \u201cSince\u2026 since all of this started, since you came out to the public as Iron Man lots of shit happened. We\u2019ve seen gods and monsters and aliens and mutants and really weird shit, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cClint, what\u2019s up?\u201d Tony said. \u201cIf it\u2019s\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s about me,\u201d Clint interrupted him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna break up with me?\u201d Tony asked and moved back an inch or two. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Clint blurted. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I would never break up with you. It\u2019s just\u2026 there\u2019s something you need to know about me and\u2026 and I don\u2019t want this to get serious without you knowing, you know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re married?\u201d Tony guessed but Clint shook his head. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he huffed and then took a deep breath before Tony could continue guessing. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 what I am,\u201d he said then. </p><p>\u201cWhat you are?\u201d Tony frowned. </p><p>\u201cYou know\u2026 Thor\u2026 Thor is not human and\u2026 and that\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Clint said. His mouth was dry and his tongue seemed to stick to the roof of his mouth. He\u2019s never been so nervous in centuries. </p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s okay, but\u2026\u201d Tony started but Clint interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not human, too,\u201d he blurted and then swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not\u2026 not like\u2026 like Thor but\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cClint,\u201d Tony interrupted his stammering and took his hands again. \u201cLook at me.\u201d Clint obeyed. \u201cTake a deep breath now.\u201d He did. \u201cAnd now tell me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not like Thor, but\u2026 but I\u2019m not a human. And\u2026 and maybe I\u2019m a little bit older than I look like,\u201d he said. He could feel the heat in the tips of his ears and licked his lips nervously. </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Tony said then. \u201cCan you\u2026 do you want to\u2026 uhm\u2026 show me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Clint said and took another deep breath. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 uh\u2026 don\u2019t forget it\u2019s still me, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Tony said. Clint rose and made a few steps back, removed shirt and pants, much to Tony\u2019s delight, concentrated and lifted the glamour he used to keep his true nature hidden. From one moment to the next his legs up to his navel were furry, his feet were hooves, he had pointed ears and goat horns came out of his head. Tony sat there, stared, mouth agape and literally had no idea what to say. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 uh\u2026 I\u2019m a faun,\u201d Clint said and gestured at his legs with both hands. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 uh\u2026 that\u2019s me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWha\u2026 how?\u201d Tony eventually managed. He rose, too, and came over to Clint. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a glamour,\u201d he said. \u201cWe use it so we can walk amongst humans.\u201d He didn\u2019t move when Tony walked around him. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, is that\u2026\u201d Tony blurted when he saw the goats tail on his backside. </p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Clint said and felt the heat in his cheeks. </p><p>\u201cCan I\u2026\u201d Tony asked when he came around and Clint nodded. Slowly and carefully he touched Clint\u2019s hip. \u201cSoft,\u201d he murmured. The fur was silky and Tony let his fingers run through it. </p><p>\u201cCan you please say something?\u201d Clint whispered. Tony looked up at him, licked his lips and then closed the distance between them and kissed him. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Clint,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, you\u2019re not human. Who cares? You have hooves and horns and that adorable little tail but\u2026 you\u2019re still you and\u2026 I love you.\u201d </p><p>Clint felt a tear of happiness run over his face. </p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he said. And then he kissed him again. </p>",

A new threat looming in the horizon. This time it could be the end of the line. </p><p><br/></p><!-- more --><hr><p>Let it be know that James Buchanan Barnes didn\u2019t like morning. He didn\u2019t like it when he was young and had to go to school, didn\u2019t like them when he had to go to work on the dock to provide for his family.\u00a0Did he liked them when he was in the war ? Absolutely not! He have an inkling that he didn\u2019t liked them in his time with H.Y.D.R.A but he didn\u2019t know if he had early morning back then. Maybe they just put him of his fridge and then serve him his orders. He snorted at the thought, he had come to adopt a very dark humor concerning his H.Y.D.R.A\u2019s days as a coping mechanism. Sure it made people uncomfortable but at least he was learning to accept his past. \u00a0</p><p>But back to his hate for morning, if he didn\u2019t like them before now he positively loath them. Does he want to wake up every morning at crack ass dawn to run with his best friend ? Nope, not at all but he could indulge Steve, plus who would says no to his fucking puppy eyes, you guessed it not Bucky. But now he has to share his breakfast with Steve\u2019s girlfriend too and oh god is she annoying well not really annoying per se, but the fact that he is in love with her and that he can\u2019t touch her like he want because his best friend got her first annoys him.\u00a0</p><p>She a S.H.I.E.L.D agent, named Lyanna, she is a health freak with an addiction to instagram. A bleached blonde even if she says that it\u2019s natural. \u00ab Fuckin bottle blonde\u00a0\u00bb with green eyes and her boobs are so fake they defy the law of gravity.\u00a0 Yes Bucky Barnes is privy to women artifice, he used to have sisters and even back in the days women teared each other apart so he know. Nat,Wanda Pepper and even Sharon love to watch Miss America with him. He is hilarious, imagine the Winter Soldier imitating contestant and shaking his hair parroting their speeches.\u00a0</p><p>He had taken to criticizes her at every opportunities so he would not succumbs to his temptation.\u00a0</p><p>Talking about the devil, her shrill voice make him wince and exchange a knowing glance with Sam who was making his famous pancake for the team.\u00a0 Of all the girls and boys the punk could have choose he had to pick this one.\u00a0</p><p>Steve put his paper journal on the counter and wait for his best girl to barge in the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Steven Grant Rogers,\u00a0\u00bb she roared making a beeline for him \u00ab\u00a0did you know ?\u00a0\u00bb she asked him tastily. Her face was red and bloated from her anger and Bucky made a really visible grimace that sent Sam in a coughing fit.\u00a0</p><p>Steve\u2019s face is the epitome of clueless, and Lyanna doesn\u2019t let him answer \u00ab\u00a0Oh don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t Steven, your ex the oh so great Sharon Carter played favorite and now I have another recruit to train with the initial 11 others\u00a0\u00bb she seethed.\u00a0</p><p>But Steve failed the see a problem and tell her so and Bucky knew that he just screwed himself. \u00ab\u00a0You don\u2019t see a problem with that ? Huh of course you wouldn\u2019t. So she add her sister in the program, a sister that didn\u2019t partake in the pre selection but that\u2019s not a problem because she is fucking Carter and those women are above us mere mortal! Is that what you think Steven ? Are Sharon and Danny Carter above us ? Above me ?\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0 She grilled him and Bucky had enough, he put is coffee in the sink and glared at her \u00ab\u00a0If she doesn\u2019t have your fucking irritating voice then yes I would say she is better than you Betty.\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>Steve looked at his retracting back with a disapproving glare. \u00ab\u00a0I didn\u2019t know she had sister doll, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be a great teacher nonetheless\u00a0\u00bb he tried to soothed her.\u00a0</p><p>Upon hearing the news that a new Carter had sprout from nowhere the Avengers had made their way to the training room.\u00a0</p><p>Tony knew that you were not really a Carter, after all Peggy has been his Godmother and Sharon was like his cousin. It was him that had made your papers, and it was for him that Sharon had asked you to share your language. So he didn\u2019t came because you were a \u00ab\u00a0Carter\u00a0\u00bb but because he wanted to see Steve\u2019s girl reaction to you. \u00a0</p><p>He was one of those who didn\u2019t like her, Sam being the other. He know perfectly that Bucky love her, it\u2019s so painfully obvious. But then again he is Tony Stark it\u2019s like a 6th sense for him to know who like who. And Tony know that Lyanna love him too, maybe she want to have her supersoldier sandwich. Kids these day and their Tumblr obsession for Stucky. Steve would have a heart attack if he knew how people saw him. Bucky on the other hand would love it, he has taken to take multiples women. And he would have given Playboy Tony a run for his money.\u00a0</p><p>They were all gathered by the center mat waiting fro the group of recruits to arrive.\u00a0</p><p>Steve, Lyanna and Bucky are talking quietly, and Bucky is just behind her, touching her slightly, and Tony observe them intrigued. \tThat is a new turn in their dynamic, they are fucking he is sure of that or at list they had fuck. Steve has red cheeks and Bucky is more relaxed that he had been for a long time. And Lyanna is positively glowing by the power of being dicked by two super soldiers.\u00a0</p><p>Son of a bitch, if he had know Steve had this in him, his bisexual ass would have have a pass at him.\u00a0</p><p>But now he was in a celibacy phase, it been two years since his latest flame, he was not in a sexual phase at all.\u00a0</p><p>Popping a berry in his mouth he took a place more secluded in the sidelines to observe the trio like one would do with an animal documentary.\u00a0</p><p>Hills was the one leading the group of new meat in the compound so Lydia was with the Avengers.\u00a0 She is talking with Stevie when she spots the newcomers.\u00a0</p><p>She already know them as she was one of the persons that had handpicked them.\u00a0</p><p>But when her eyes meet your forms, her entire body stiffens.\u00a0</p><p>You are at the back of the group, there is no use for you to try to hide, you are the tallest in fact you tower them all, you even seem to have the same height than Thor himself. You&rsquo;re under armor kit, cling at your body and so they can see the definition of your taunt muscles.\u00a0</p><p>Lyanna is seething, how dare you wore sunglass, one thing is sure though, you are going to regret this, she is not going to miss you.

A new threat looming in the horizon. This time it could be the end of the line. </p><p><br></p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>Let it be know that James Buchanan Barnes didn\u2019t like morning. He didn\u2019t like it when he was young and had to go to school, didn\u2019t like them when he had to go to work on the dock to provide for his family.\u00a0Did he liked them when he was in the war ? Absolutely not! He have an inkling that he didn\u2019t liked them in his time with H.Y.D.R.A but he didn\u2019t know if he had early morning back then. Maybe they just put him of his fridge and then serve him his orders. He snorted at the thought, he had come to adopt a very dark humor concerning his H.Y.D.R.A\u2019s days as a coping mechanism. Sure it made people uncomfortable but at least he was learning to accept his past. \u00a0</p><p>But back to his hate for morning, if he didn\u2019t like them before now he positively loath them. Does he want to wake up every morning at crack ass dawn to run with his best friend ? Nope, not at all but he could indulge Steve, plus who would says no to his fucking puppy eyes, you guessed it not Bucky. But now he has to share his breakfast with Steve\u2019s girlfriend too and oh god is she annoying well not really annoying per se, but the fact that he is in love with her and that he can\u2019t touch her like he want because his best friend got her first annoys him.\u00a0</p><p>She a S.H.I.E.L.D agent, named Lyanna, she is a health freak with an addiction to instagram. A bleached blonde even if she says that it\u2019s natural. \u00ab Fuckin bottle blonde\u00a0\u00bb with green eyes and her boobs are so fake they defy the law of gravity.\u00a0 Yes Bucky Barnes is privy to women artifice, he used to have sisters and even back in the days women teared each other apart so he know. Nat,Wanda Pepper and even Sharon love to watch Miss America with him. He is hilarious, imagine the Winter Soldier imitating contestant and shaking his hair parroting their speeches.\u00a0</p><p>He had taken to criticizes her at every opportunities so he would not succumbs to his temptation.\u00a0</p><p>Talking about the devil, her shrill voice make him wince and exchange a knowing glance with Sam who was making his famous pancake for the team.\u00a0 Of all the girls and boys the punk could have choose he had to pick this one.\u00a0</p><p>Steve put his paper journal on the counter and wait for his best girl to barge in the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Steven Grant Rogers,\u00a0\u00bb she roared making a beeline for him \u00ab\u00a0did you know ?\u00a0\u00bb she asked him tastily. Her face was red and bloated from her anger and Bucky made a really visible grimace that sent Sam in a coughing fit.\u00a0</p><p>Steve\u2019s face is the epitome of clueless, and Lyanna doesn\u2019t let him answer \u00ab\u00a0Oh don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t Steven, your ex the oh so great Sharon Carter played favorite and now I have another recruit to train with the initial 11 others\u00a0\u00bb she seethed.\u00a0</p><p>But Steve failed the see a problem and tell her so and Bucky knew that he just screwed himself. \u00ab\u00a0You don\u2019t see a problem with that ? Huh of course you wouldn\u2019t. So she add her sister in the program, a sister that didn\u2019t partake in the pre selection but that\u2019s not a problem because she is fucking Carter and those women are above us mere mortal! Is that what you think Steven ? Are Sharon and Danny Carter above us ? Above me ?\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0 She grilled him and Bucky had enough, he put is coffee in the sink and glared at her \u00ab\u00a0If she doesn\u2019t have your fucking irritating voice then yes I would say she is better than you Betty.\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>Steve looked at his retracting back with a disapproving glare. \u00ab\u00a0I didn\u2019t know she had sister doll, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be a great teacher nonetheless\u00a0\u00bb he tried to soothed her.\u00a0</p><p>Upon hearing the news that a new Carter had sprout from nowhere the Avengers had made their way to the training room.\u00a0</p><p>Tony knew that you were not really a Carter, after all Peggy has been his Godmother and Sharon was like his cousin. It was him that had made your papers, and it was for him that Sharon had asked you to share your language. So he didn\u2019t came because you were a \u00ab\u00a0Carter\u00a0\u00bb but because he wanted to see Steve\u2019s girl reaction to you. \u00a0</p><p>He was one of those who didn\u2019t like her, Sam being the other. He know perfectly that Bucky love her, it\u2019s so painfully obvious. But then again he is Tony Stark it\u2019s like a 6th sense for him to know who like who. And Tony know that Lyanna love him too, maybe she want to have her supersoldier sandwich. Kids these day and their Tumblr obsession for Stucky. Steve would have a heart attack if he knew how people saw him. Bucky on the other hand would love it, he has taken to take multiples women. And he would have given Playboy Tony a run for his money.\u00a0</p><p>They were all gathered by the center mat waiting fro the group of recruits to arrive.\u00a0</p><p>Steve, Lyanna and Bucky are talking quietly, and Bucky is just behind her, touching her slightly, and Tony observe them intrigued. \tThat is a new turn in their dynamic, they are fucking he is sure of that or at list they had fuck. Steve has red cheeks and Bucky is more relaxed that he had been for a long time. And Lyanna is positively glowing by the power of being dicked by two super soldiers.\u00a0</p><p>Son of a bitch, if he had know Steve had this in him, his bisexual ass would have have a pass at him.\u00a0</p><p>But now he was in a celibacy phase, it been two years since his latest flame, he was not in a sexual phase at all.\u00a0</p><p>Popping a berry in his mouth he took a place more secluded in the sidelines to observe the trio like one would do with an animal documentary.\u00a0</p><p>Hills was the one leading the group of new meat in the compound so Lydia was with the Avengers.\u00a0 She is talking with Stevie when she spots the newcomers.\u00a0</p><p>She already know them as she was one of the persons that had handpicked them.\u00a0</p><p>But when her eyes meet your forms, her entire body stiffens.\u00a0</p><p>You are at the back of the group, there is no use for you to try to hide, you are the tallest in fact you tower them all, you even seem to have the same height than Thor himself. You\u2019re under armor kit, cling at your body and so they can see the definition of your taunt muscles.\u00a0</p><p>Lyanna is seething, how dare you wore sunglass, one thing is sure though, you are going to regret this, she is not going to miss you. She won\u2019t let you steal her super soldiers, Steve and Bucky are hers.\u00a0</p><p>Lyanna start with a speech, of how she is proud of the new recruits, that a new horizon lay ahead of them but Tony could her eyes zooming to you every so often.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Danny Carter,\u00a0\u00bb she called, and you made you way to stand in front of her, hands behind your back.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018Huh hoh this is happening\u2019 Tony thought as he prepared himself for the show Lyanna is about to give. He know she can be a bitch but you, you are the wild variable, he don\u2019t know you and he surely don\u2019t know how you would react. He only hope that you can take whatever is going to be thrown your way by the blonde harpy.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Do you think your attire is appropriate for training ?\u00a0\u00bb she questions you, circling you like a shark would a seal.\u00a0</p><p>The others recruits start snickering at your expanse.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky and Steve are proud of the intimidating persona their girl gave off.\u00a0 They love strong women and Lyanna is anything but weak.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"347\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"itsawkwardfanboi:gq0VcAI2UktwaURzy-DxIA:ZvkK7j2X7gBpR\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d79bd5173e785403ee85aaea5a7fa9db/tumblr_p6y90mHnIH1ujdp1io1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"347\"></figure><p>Bucky is even turned on by her attitude.\u00a0</p><p>Steve is also judging by the prism of your \u2018sister\u2019 and \u2018aunt\u2019.

A new threat looming in the horizon. This time it could be the end of the line. </p><p><br></p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>Let it be know that James Buchanan Barnes didn\u2019t like morning. He didn\u2019t like it when he was young and had to go to school, didn\u2019t like them when he had to go to work on the dock to provide for his family.\u00a0Did he liked them when he was in the war ? Absolutely not! He have an inkling that he didn\u2019t liked them in his time with H.Y.D.R.A but he didn\u2019t know if he had early morning back then. Maybe they just put him of his fridge and then serve him his orders. He snorted at the thought, he had come to adopt a very dark humor concerning his H.Y.D.R.A\u2019s days as a coping mechanism. Sure it made people uncomfortable but at least he was learning to accept his past. \u00a0</p><p>But back to his hate for morning, if he didn\u2019t like them before now he positively loath them. Does he want to wake up every morning at crack ass dawn to run with his best friend ? Nope, not at all but he could indulge Steve, plus who would says no to his fucking puppy eyes, you guessed it not Bucky. But now he has to share his breakfast with Steve\u2019s girlfriend too and oh god is she annoying well not really annoying per se, but the fact that he is in love with her and that he can\u2019t touch her like he want because his best friend got her first annoys him.\u00a0</p><p>She a S.H.I.E.L.D agent, named Lyanna, she is a health freak with an addiction to instagram. A bleached blonde even if she says that it\u2019s natural. \u00ab Fuckin bottle blonde\u00a0\u00bb with green eyes and her boobs are so fake they defy the law of gravity.\u00a0 Yes Bucky Barnes is privy to women artifice, he used to have sisters and even back in the days women teared each other apart so he know. Nat,Wanda Pepper and even Sharon love to watch Miss America with him. He is hilarious, imagine the Winter Soldier imitating contestant and shaking his hair parroting their speeches.\u00a0</p><p>He had taken to criticizes her at every opportunities so he would not succumbs to his temptation.\u00a0</p><p>Talking about the devil, her shrill voice make him wince and exchange a knowing glance with Sam who was making his famous pancake for the team.\u00a0 Of all the girls and boys the punk could have choose he had to pick this one.\u00a0</p><p>Steve put his paper journal on the counter and wait for his best girl to barge in the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Steven Grant Rogers,\u00a0\u00bb she roared making a beeline for him \u00ab\u00a0did you know ?\u00a0\u00bb she asked him tastily. Her face was red and bloated from her anger and Bucky made a really visible grimace that sent Sam in a coughing fit.\u00a0</p><p>Steve\u2019s face is the epitome of clueless, and Lyanna doesn\u2019t let him answer \u00ab\u00a0Oh don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t Steven, your ex the oh so great Sharon Carter played favorite and now I have another recruit to train with the initial 11 others\u00a0\u00bb she seethed.\u00a0</p><p>But Steve failed the see a problem and tell her so and Bucky knew that he just screwed himself. \u00ab\u00a0You don\u2019t see a problem with that ? Huh of course you wouldn\u2019t. So she add her sister in the program, a sister that didn\u2019t partake in the pre selection but that\u2019s not a problem because she is fucking Carter and those women are above us mere mortal! Is that what you think Steven ? Are Sharon and Danny Carter above us ? Above me ?\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0 She grilled him and Bucky had enough, he put is coffee in the sink and glared at her \u00ab\u00a0If she doesn\u2019t have your fucking irritating voice then yes I would say she is better than you Betty.\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>Steve looked at his retracting back with a disapproving glare. \u00ab\u00a0I didn\u2019t know she had sister doll, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be a great teacher nonetheless\u00a0\u00bb he tried to soothed her.\u00a0</p><p>Upon hearing the news that a new Carter had sprout from nowhere the Avengers had made their way to the training room.\u00a0</p><p>Tony knew that you were not really a Carter, after all Peggy has been his Godmother and Sharon was like his cousin. It was him that had made your papers, and it was for him that Sharon had asked you to share your language. So he didn\u2019t came because you were a \u00ab\u00a0Carter\u00a0\u00bb but because he wanted to see Steve\u2019s girl reaction to you. \u00a0</p><p>He was one of those who didn\u2019t like her, Sam being the other. He know perfectly that Bucky love her, it\u2019s so painfully obvious. But then again he is Tony Stark it\u2019s like a 6th sense for him to know who like who. And Tony know that Lyanna love him too, maybe she want to have her supersoldier sandwich. Kids these day and their Tumblr obsession for Stucky. Steve would have a heart attack if he knew how people saw him. Bucky on the other hand would love it, he has taken to take multiples women. And he would have given Playboy Tony a run for his money.\u00a0</p><p>They were all gathered by the center mat waiting fro the group of recruits to arrive.\u00a0</p><p>Steve, Lyanna and Bucky are talking quietly, and Bucky is just behind her, touching her slightly, and Tony observe them intrigued. \tThat is a new turn in their dynamic, they are fucking he is sure of that or at list they had fuck. Steve has red cheeks and Bucky is more relaxed that he had been for a long time. And Lyanna is positively glowing by the power of being dicked by two super soldiers.\u00a0</p><p>Son of a bitch, if he had know Steve had this in him, his bisexual ass would have have a pass at him.\u00a0</p><p>But now he was in a celibacy phase, it been two years since his latest flame, he was not in a sexual phase at all.\u00a0</p><p>Popping a berry in his mouth he took a place more secluded in the sidelines to observe the trio like one would do with an animal documentary.\u00a0</p><p>Hills was the one leading the group of new meat in the compound so Lydia was with the Avengers.\u00a0 She is talking with Stevie when she spots the newcomers.\u00a0</p><p>She already know them as she was one of the persons that had handpicked them.\u00a0</p><p>But when her eyes meet your forms, her entire body stiffens.\u00a0</p><p>You are at the back of the group, there is no use for you to try to hide, you are the tallest in fact you tower them all, you even seem to have the same height than Thor himself. You\u2019re under armor kit, cling at your body and so they can see the definition of your taunt muscles.\u00a0</p><p>Lyanna is seething, how dare you wore sunglass, one thing is sure though, you are going to regret this, she is not going to miss you. She won\u2019t let you steal her super soldiers, Steve and Bucky are hers.\u00a0</p><p>Lyanna start with a speech, of how she is proud of the new recruits, that a new horizon lay ahead of them but Tony could her eyes zooming to you every so often.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Danny Carter,\u00a0\u00bb she called, and you made you way to stand in front of her, hands behind your back.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018Huh hoh this is happening\u2019 Tony thought as he prepared himself for the show Lyanna is about to give. He know she can be a bitch but you, you are the wild variable, he don\u2019t know you and he surely don\u2019t know how you would react. He only hope that you can take whatever is going to be thrown your way by the blonde harpy.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Do you think your attire is appropriate for training ?\u00a0\u00bb she questions you, circling you like a shark would a seal.\u00a0</p><p>The others recruits start snickering at your expanse.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky and Steve are proud of the intimidating persona their girl gave off.\u00a0 They love strong women and Lyanna is anything but weak.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"347\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"itsawkwardfanboi:gq0VcAI2UktwaURzy-DxIA:ZvkK7j2X7gBpR\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d79bd5173e785403ee85aaea5a7fa9db/tumblr_p6y90mHnIH1ujdp1io1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"347\"></figure><p>Bucky is even turned on by her attitude.\u00a0</p><p>Steve is also judging by the prism of your \u2018sister\u2019 and \u2018aunt\u2019. You don\u2019t look anything like them maybe you have a different father or mother he don\u2019t know.\u00a0</p><p>You are so damn tall for a woman and your built is nothing if impressive.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0I wasn\u2019t aware that the training would start right now.\u00a0\u00bb you answer flatly.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Well now you are, do I have to send you an invitation for you to remove your sunglasses\u00a0\u00bb she taunted you.\u00a0</p><p>You clenched your jaw, you were already fed up with her but you had promised Shar that you would be well behaved, so you complied and removed your sunglasses. The moment the shade stop hiding your eyes your hear a loud whistle.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Well damn Frosty you just lost your title of the most stunning eyes to baby Carter\u00a0\u00bb the man snicker, but the metal arm man stop his laugh with a slap to his head \u00ab\u00a0Shuddup birdbrain.\u00a0\u00bb the man seethed.\u00a0</p><p>If you thought the look she was sending you before was hostile than the one you are receiving now is straight up murderous. You just raise a brow looking down to her and apparently it was the wrong move because her glare darkened even more after that.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0I\u2019m curious Carter,\u00a0\u00bb her saccharine tone don\u2019t bod well for you \u00ab you made it in this program thanks to your connections while the others trainees had to undergo a grueling selection. So tell us, why are you here ?\u00a0\u00bb she smile kindly at you but you don\u2019t buy it for one second.\u00a0</p><p>You look around the gym \u00ab\u00a0I\u2019m here to train.\u00a0\u00bb you answer simply as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0You think you are funny huh ?\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>You don\u2019t like the way she is toying with you, and you don\u2019t really know how to react or what the you with memories of your life would do . \u00ab\u00a0I don\u2019t know, do you ?\u00a0\u00bb you shot back titling your head to the side. You internally wince when you finally process what you had just said <i>\u2018way to go Danny\u2019</i> you sigh and once again anger the woman in front of you furthermore.\u00a0</p><p>She doesn\u2019t acknowledge you remark verbally at least. \u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Right, so do you have any hand to hand combat experience ?\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0I don\u2019t know\u00a0\u00bb you answer trustfully, you hadn\u2019t been brief to what you would be expected to do or to know.\u00a0</p><p>The deep scowl she was sporting slip away from her face instantly and her smile is now blinding.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00ab Maybe with fire arms ?\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0 again you don\u2019t know and you state it.\u00a0</p><p>The more she grill you, the more she is pleased to see that you are not really a real threat to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0So basically you have no training, no knowledge and yet here you are with the cream of the cream ? Let me guess it\u2019s because you are a Carter ?\u00a0\u00bb you don\u2019t have the time to answer that she wake her right hand in front of you to silence you.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0No it would be irresponsible for me to let you train with professional, but maybe you can run ?\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0 you only nod serving her to clap her delightfully. \u00a0</p><p>She instructed you to follow her and made you way to exterior of the compound and instruct you to run without interruption because she would know it thanks to Stark\u2019s captor.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s not the better weather, it\u2019s raining hard but you do what you were told and start to run.\u00a0</p><p>You don\u2019t know why she have a thing against you, but you found the running not as bad as you originally thought.\u00a0</p><p>At least you were no subject to the whispering of others and it let you time to try to remember your past life.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Steve couldn\u2019t believe you were a Carter, you are disappointment to say the least. You don\u2019t have their fire, you are not a badass you are just you. An overgrown muscly woman who give the Carter a bad name and you are waisting everybody\u2019s time with your inaptitude. He is glad that Lyanna had decided to make you run even though it\u2019s outdoor with a heavy rain. Maybe you\u2019ll learn the hard way that not everything is going to be handing to you.\u00a0</p><p>They are all gathered in the common room, having a welcome diner for the recruit when Stark arrive. He look around and doesn\u2019t spot you, which is weird considering your size.\u00a0</p><p>Steve is talking with his girl so he decided to ask Bucky about you. \u00ab\u00a0I don\u2019t know Stark I\u2019m not her babysitter.\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>Tony only rolled his eyes, and goes to Nat and Sam \u00ab\u00a0Hey lovebirds do you happen to know where Danny is ?\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>They shook their heads \u00ab\u00a0Oh for fuck sake, F.R.I.D.A.Y where is Danny Carter ?\u00a0\u00bb he asked his A.I pinching the bridge of his nose. \u00ab\u00a0Miss Carter is still running.\u00a0\u00bb The conversation between Tony and F.R.I.D.A.Y had gathered the attention of the attendance.\u00a0 Stark turn to Lyanna and hold her gaze \u00ab\u00a0why is she still running ?\u00a0\u00bb \u00ab\u00a0It appears agent Lyanna Lane gave her the order to don\u2019t stop running until told otherwise.

Her face was red and bloated from her anger and Bucky made a really visible grimace that sent Sam in a coughing fit.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve&rsquo;s face is the epitome of clueless, and Lyanna doesn&rsquo;t let him answer &laquo;&nbsp;Oh don&rsquo;t act like you didn&rsquo;t Steven, your ex the oh so great Sharon Carter played favorite and now I have another recruit to train with the initial 11 others&nbsp;&raquo; she seethed.&nbsp;</p><p>But Steve failed the see a problem and tell her so and Bucky knew that he just screwed himself. &laquo;&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t see a problem with that ? Huh of course you wouldn&rsquo;t. So she add her sister in the program, a sister that didn&rsquo;t partake in the pre selection but that&rsquo;s not a problem because she is fucking Carter and those women are above us mere mortal! Is that what you think Steven ? Are Sharon and Danny Carter above us ? Above me ?&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp; She grilled him and Bucky had enough, he put is coffee in the sink and glared at her &laquo;&nbsp;If she doesn&rsquo;t have your fucking irritating voice then yes I would say she is better than you Betty.&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve looked at his retracting back with a disapproving glare. &laquo;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know she had sister doll, but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be a great teacher nonetheless&nbsp;&raquo; he tried to soothed her.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon hearing the news that a new Carter had sprout from nowhere the Avengers had made their way to the training room.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony knew that you were not really a Carter, after all Peggy has been his Godmother and Sharon was like his cousin. It was him that had made your papers, and it was for him that Sharon had asked you to share your language. So he didn&rsquo;t came because you were a &laquo;&nbsp;Carter&nbsp;&raquo; but because he wanted to see Steve&rsquo;s girl reaction to you. &nbsp;</p><p>He was one of those who didn&rsquo;t like her, Sam being the other. He know perfectly that Bucky love her, it&rsquo;s so painfully obvious. But then again he is Tony Stark it&rsquo;s like a 6th sense for him to know who like who. And Tony know that Lyanna love him too, maybe she want to have her supersoldier sandwich. Kids these day and their Tumblr obsession for Stucky. Steve would have a heart attack if he knew how people saw him. Bucky on the other hand would love it, he has taken to take multiples women. And he would have given Playboy Tony a run for his money.&nbsp;</p><p>They were all gathered by the center mat waiting fro the group of recruits to arrive.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve, Lyanna and Bucky are talking quietly, and Bucky is just behind her, touching her slightly, and Tony observe them intrigued. \tThat is a new turn in their dynamic, they are fucking he is sure of that or at list they had fuck. Steve has red cheeks and Bucky is more relaxed that he had been for a long time. And Lyanna is positively glowing by the power of being dicked by two super soldiers.&nbsp;</p><p>Son of a bitch, if he had know Steve had this in him, his bisexual ass would have have a pass at him.&nbsp;</p><p>But now he was in a celibacy phase, it been two years since his latest flame, he was not in a sexual phase at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Popping a berry in his mouth he took a place more secluded in the sidelines to observe the trio like one would do with an animal documentary.&nbsp;</p><p>Hills was the one leading the group of new meat in the compound so Lydia was with the Avengers.&nbsp; She is talking with Stevie when she spots the newcomers.&nbsp;</p><p>She already know them as she was one of the persons that had handpicked them.&nbsp;</p><p>But when her eyes meet your forms, her entire body stiffens.&nbsp;</p><p>You are at the back of the group, there is no use for you to try to hide, you are the tallest in fact you tower them all, you even seem to have the same height than Thor himself. You&rsquo;re under armor kit, cling at your body and so they can see the definition of your taunt muscles.&nbsp;</p><p>Lyanna is seething, how dare you wore sunglass, one thing is sure though, you are going to regret this, she is not going to miss you. She won&rsquo;t let you steal her super soldiers, Steve and Bucky are hers.&nbsp;</p><p>Lyanna start with a speech, of how she is proud of the new recruits, that a new horizon lay ahead of them but Tony could her eyes zooming to you every so often.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;Danny Carter,&nbsp;&raquo; she called, and you made you way to stand in front of her, hands behind your back.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;Huh hoh this is happening&rsquo; Tony thought as he prepared himself for the show Lyanna is about to give. He know she can be a bitch but you, you are the wild variable, he don&rsquo;t know you and he surely don&rsquo;t know how you would react. He only hope that you can take whatever is going to be thrown your way by the blonde harpy.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;Do you think your attire is appropriate for training ?&nbsp;&raquo; she questions you, circling you like a shark would a seal.&nbsp;</p><p>The others recruits start snickering at your expanse.&nbsp;</p><p>Bucky and Steve are proud of the intimidating persona their girl gave off.&nbsp; They love strong women and Lyanna is anything but weak.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Bucky is even turned on by her attitude.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve is also judging by the prism of your &lsquo;sister&rsquo; and &lsquo;aunt&rsquo;. You don&rsquo;t look anything like them maybe you have a different father or mother he don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;</p><p>You are so damn tall for a woman and your built is nothing if impressive.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t aware that the training would start right now.&nbsp;&raquo; you answer flatly.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;Well now you are, do I have to send you an invitation for you to remove your sunglasses&nbsp;&raquo; she taunted you.&nbsp;</p><p>You clenched your jaw, you were already fed up with her but you had promised Shar that you would be well behaved, so you complied and removed your sunglasses. The moment the shade stop hiding your eyes your hear a loud whistle.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;Well damn Frosty you just lost your title of the most stunning eyes to baby Carter&nbsp;&raquo; the man snicker, but the metal arm man stop his laugh with a slap to his head &laquo;&nbsp;Shuddup birdbrain.&nbsp;&raquo; the man seethed.&nbsp;</p><p>If you thought the look she was sending you before was hostile than the one you are receiving now is straight up murderous. You just raise a brow looking down to her and apparently it was the wrong move because her glare darkened even more after that.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m curious Carter,&nbsp;&raquo; her saccharine tone don&rsquo;t bod well for you &laquo; you made it in this program thanks to your connections while the others trainees had to undergo a grueling selection. So tell us, why are you here ?&nbsp;&raquo; she smile kindly at you but you don&rsquo;t buy it for one second.&nbsp;</p><p>You look around the gym &laquo;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m here to train.&nbsp;&raquo; you answer simply as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;You think you are funny huh ?&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You don&rsquo;t like the way she is toying with you, and you don&rsquo;t really know how to react or what the you with memories of your life would do . &laquo;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know, do you ?&nbsp;&raquo; you shot back titling your head to the side. You internally wince when you finally process what you had just said <i>&lsquo;way to go Danny&rsquo;</i> you sigh and once again anger the woman in front of you furthermore.&nbsp;</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge you remark verbally at least. &nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;Right, so do you have any hand to hand combat experience ?&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know&nbsp;&raquo; you answer trustfully, you hadn&rsquo;t been brief to what you would be expected to do or to know.&nbsp;</p><p>The deep scowl she was sporting slip away from her face instantly and her smile is now blinding.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&laquo; Maybe with fire arms ?&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp; again you don&rsquo;t know and you state it.&nbsp;</p><p>The more she grill you, the more she is pleased to see that you are not really a real threat to her.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;So basically you have no training, no knowledge and yet here you are with the cream of the cream ? Let me guess it&rsquo;s because you are a Carter ?&nbsp;&raquo; you don&rsquo;t have the time to answer that she wake her right hand in front of you to silence you.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;No it would be irresponsible for me to let you train with professional, but maybe you can run ?&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp; you only nod serving her to clap her delightfully. &nbsp;</p><p>She instructed you to follow her and made you way to exterior of the compound and instruct you to run without interruption because she would know it thanks to Stark&rsquo;s captor.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s not the better weather, it&rsquo;s raining hard but you do what you were told and start to run.&nbsp;</p><p>You don&rsquo;t know why she have a thing against you, but you found the running not as bad as you originally thought.&nbsp;</p><p>At least you were no subject to the whispering of others and it let you time to try to remember your past life.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>Steve couldn&rsquo;t believe you were a Carter, you are disappointment to say the least. You don&rsquo;t have their fire, you are not a badass you are just you. An overgrown muscly woman who give the Carter a bad name and you are waisting everybody&rsquo;s time with your inaptitude. He is glad that Lyanna had decided to make you run even though it&rsquo;s outdoor with a heavy rain. Maybe you&rsquo;ll learn the hard way that not everything is going to be handing to you.&nbsp;</p><p>They are all gathered in the common room, having a welcome diner for the recruit when Stark arrive. He look around and doesn&rsquo;t spot you, which is weird considering your size.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve is talking with his girl so he decided to ask Bucky about you. &laquo;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know Stark I&rsquo;m not her babysitter.&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony only rolled his eyes, and goes to Nat and Sam &laquo;&nbsp;Hey lovebirds do you happen to know where Danny is ?&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;</p><p>They shook their heads &laquo;&nbsp;Oh for fuck sake, F.R.I.D.A.Y where is Danny Carter ?&nbsp;&raquo; he asked his A.I pinching the bridge of his nose. &laquo;&nbsp;Miss Carter is still running.&nbsp;&raquo; The conversation between Tony and F.R.I.D.A.Y had gathered the attention of the attendance.&nbsp; Stark turn to Lyanna and hold her gaze &laquo;&nbsp;why is she still running ?&nbsp;&raquo; &laquo;&nbsp;It appears agent Lyanna Lane gave her the order to don&rsquo;t stop running until told otherwise. She didn&rsquo;t take a break since she started to run this morning.&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony stormed out, fuming about stupid agent and pussy whipped supersoldiers.&nbsp;</p><p>When he finally spotted you, you were running toward them, at good allure and made no indication to stop.</p><p>You were&nbsp; cold, but didn&rsquo;t stop, something in the back of your mind told you that an order was an order and you have to follow it.&nbsp;</p><p>Why would the prospect of not following an order made you this anxious you didn&rsquo;t know but even with all your might you still didn&rsquo;t find why.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;Hey kid,&nbsp;&raquo; a man called you and you stop to talk to him.&nbsp; &laquo;&nbsp;you can stop running it&rsquo;s late and you must be famished after this run.&nbsp;&raquo; He told you kindly, you only nod, you won&rsquo;t risk to anger people like this morning again.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony decided to not go back to the common room and led you to the garage.&nbsp; You were amazed by the number of cars and they all seem to cost a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>He only smirk at your obvious wonderment.&nbsp;</p><p>He took you to his favorite place and he introduce you to the wonder of Kebab. It was his turn to be amazed when you eat 5 of them like it was nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>He drove you back at the compound after that you felt less lonely but he told you that he was going to a long mission with some of the others Avengers. You thanked him for his kindness and dreaded the next days without him in your corner.&nbsp;</p></p>",
