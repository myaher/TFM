Pressing a hand to your chest, you took a few steadying breaths, trying to calm your racing heart. Looking after Todoroki, you laughed shakily. What just happened was the last thing you would&rsquo;ve expected from him.</i> <i><br/></i></p><p><i>If your heart hadn&rsquo;t belonged to him already, it did now&hellip;</i></p><!-- more --><p>Ever since your close encounter with Todoroki a few days ago, you had been a blushing mess every time he was in the room, your thoughts filled with him and him alone. You tried to tell yourself that you were being ridiculous- he&rsquo;d only touched his nose to yours for god&rsquo;s sake!- but that little gesture had been enough to make the small, hopeful part of yourself that you had tried to tuck away that much bigger.</p><p>You were beginning to think that maybe&hellip;just maybe&hellip;he liked you too?</p><p>No, there was no way. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly like you the way you liked him. He was Todoroki Shouto. Mr. Cool and Aloof. Way out of you league.</p><p>&hellip;But still.</p><p>You could at least hope, couldn&rsquo;t you? And you had heard a few rumors from the other girls so&hellip;</p><p>Groaning, you tossed in your bed, scrunching your eyes shut as you tried to banish thoughts of your crush from your mind and go to sleep. Your indecision was driving you mad. Should you confess? Not confess?</p><p>What would happen if you confessed? Either he rejected you- the more likely outcome- or he didn&rsquo;t and the world wasn&rsquo;t so cruel after all. Being with Todoroki&hellip;that was something you could only dream of. He always seemed so far away, but if recent events were any indicator, maybe he wasn&rsquo;t as far away as you had first thought.</p><p>But what would happen if you didn&rsquo;t confess? Would you end up waiting for him forever only to be disappointed when some bolder girl scooped up his heart? Would you end up regretting it, lost in thoughts of what might&rsquo;ve been had you taken that leap of faith?</p><p>Gritting your teeth, you opened your eyes to the darkness of your room, your mind calming as resolve set in. For better or for worse, you would confess to Todoroki, if only to avoid future regret if nothing else.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Taking a deep breath in, a certain heterochromatic, dual-haired teen released it slowly, his ribs shifting beneath his hands laid atop his chest. Staring up at the shadowy ceiling of his room, Todoroki tried to organize his thoughts, but to no avail.</p><p>It was a wonder that he had gotten through the past few days without his heart exploding every time you were around. Somehow, he had managed to act normal, like he hadn&rsquo;t made a move on the girl he was heavily crushing on, but he couldn&rsquo;t keep it up for much longer. The high of acting on how he felt had worn off quickly, leaving him a doubtful mess as to how welcome his advance actually was and if he had overestimated your interest in him.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t seem to hate him now, which was a good sign, but you hadn&rsquo;t come near him either, making a ball of anxiety form in his throat at the thought that he had made you uncomfortable or displeased you in any way.</p><p>Immediately after booping your nose with his, returning the gesture you had made so often in a much more intimate manner, he had decided to confess to you, and he still fully intended to do that, he just didn&rsquo;t quite know how. Todoroki certainly hadn&rsquo;t had the most loving childhood in the world and affection still scared him, but he truly wanted to be with you, to smile with you whenever you booped his nose in that way that made you so happy. It surprised him to find that he had missed the brief, jolting contact these past few days. He couldn&rsquo;t, for the life of him, understand why, but he had even begun to think that he was special to you, that the second-long contact between the pad of your finger and the tip of his nose hinted at some connection between you and he.</p><p>If he left things as they were he didn&rsquo;t know what would happen, but something inside him said that standing by wasn&rsquo;t an option. He had to reach out to you, just as you had reached out to him in a small but ever meaningful way.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use! What am I even going to say?&rdquo; you practically wailed over the phone to Jirou as you struggled to pull up your sock, holding the piece of technology between your shoulder and cheek.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Listen, you&rsquo;re going to be fine! Have you seen his face every time he&rsquo;s seen you? The boy&rsquo;s got it bad!&rdquo;</i> the other girl insisted.</p><p>Today was the day you had decided to confess, having told one of your closer friends, Jirou, your plans knowing she would do all she could to help. You had been feeling fine, ready and eager to get your feelings off your chest, until now. Suddenly it was as if all of the romantic anxiety you had been actively avoiding and denying had broken through your courageous front, making you reconsider everything you had planned to say and how successful you would actually be.</p><p>Managing to pull your sock the rest of the way up your leg, you released a defeated breath. &ldquo;You know what? Maybe I just shouldn&rsquo;t do this. I mean, he probably doesn&rsquo;t even-&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;(Y/N)!!!&rdquo;</i> Jirou scolded, your name long and drawn out, and you could picture her rubbing her temple in exasperation. <i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine! Just walk up to him, say, &quot;Hey, Todoroki. Guess what? I love you,&rdquo; grab him be the collar and kiss him!&ldquo;</i></p><p>&quot;That&rsquo;s a terrible idea!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Do it! Or I&rsquo;ll tell him all of the embarrassing stories that you&rsquo;ve told me!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Your jaw dropped. &ldquo;Y-You wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I would if it means the two of you will just get together and be happy already!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Groaning, you raked a hand through your hair, undoing the work you had put into brushing it that morning. &ldquo;Okay, okay! I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Good girl!&rdquo;</i></p><p>You growled at her through the phone, ready to hang up before she stopped you with a gentler call of you name. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Take a deep breath. You love him and he loves you. It&rsquo;s going to be okay.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Following her advice, you felt your annoyance and a good portion of your stress drain away. A small smile crossed your lips. It was going to be okay. &ldquo;Thank you, Kyouka.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;No problem! When you and Todoroki get married, I&rsquo;ll be able to brag that I was the one who got you to confess to him.&rdquo;</i></p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at that. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re looking too far ahead?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Naw, girl, I know it&rsquo;s gonna happen.&rdquo; </i></p><p>You rolled your eyes humorously. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get through the actual confession first.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Whatever. I&rsquo;ll see you later. Good luck! We&rsquo;re all rooting for you!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Bye!&rdquo; Hanging up, you took another deep breath before checking your appearance in the mirror one more time. Whatever happened today you weren&rsquo;t going to regret it. Grabbing your bag and slipping your shoes on, you bid a quick goodbye to your family and opened the front door, facing the ordeal that awaited you.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Midoriya, what if she really doesn&rsquo;t like me the way I like her?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case, Todoroki. From what I&rsquo;ve heard and seen, she seems to be more interested in you than anyone else.&rdquo;</i> </p><p>Humming, the dual-haired boy sat down heavily on his bed, holding his phone to his ear. He&rsquo;d awoken from a restless sleep to doubt after doubt after doubt about what he planned to do today- finally confess to you. Seeing as Midoriya had clearly recognized Todoroki&rsquo;s feelings for you even when he himself hadn&rsquo;t been able to place them, he had called the other boy in hopes of settling his nerves, not knowing what else to do. &ldquo;What if I end up making a fool of myself?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Todoroki&hellip;that&rsquo;s not going to happen.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he bit back, his tone made harsh by anxiety.</p><p>Midoriya didn&rsquo;t miss a beat. <i>&ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s going to accept you!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</i> he wanted to ask again, but instead settled for running a hand down his face, a disgruntled noise rising in the back of his throat. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fairly sure that she loves you, Todoroki, but you&rsquo;re not going to know for sure until you actually confess to her.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Then what are you doing right now? Why are you still at home thinking about it when that isn&rsquo;t going to do you any good anymore?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Todoroki blinked, a little surprised by his timid friend&rsquo;s mini-outburst, but he knew he was right. He wasn&rsquo;t going to find the answer he so badly wanted here. His answer was out there, with you.</p><p>Filling his lungs with air, he let it out slowly,blowing red and white hair out of his face as he did. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I even heard from Jirou that-wait. I&rsquo;m right?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; <i>&ldquo;As usual,&rdquo;</i> he said internally.</p><p><i>&ldquo;So&hellip;you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;<br/></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually going to follow through and confess?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to confess. I want her to know how I feel about her and ask her how she feels about me.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you remember what we practiced? What you&rsquo;re going to say?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Then get going! She&rsquo;s waiting for you!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Thank you.&rdquo; He heard a quick &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; before hanging up and taking a short inhale, rising to his feet. Straightening his tie and pulling on his blazer, he said goodbye to his sister before making his way out the door, hoping the day turned out favorably with you by his side at the end of it.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><i>&ldquo;This is it,&rdquo;</i> you thought, watching the clock tick down the remaining minutes of school. While everyone was on their way out, you planned on snagging Todoroki before he could leave and taking him aside to confess. You had briefly considered waiting for him outside the gates of U.A. as he came to school that morning, but if he did end up rejecting you, you didn&rsquo;t want to spend the day suffering and forcing smiles through your tears.</p><p>The bell rang, making you jump in your seat, and out of the corner of your eye you caught Jirou giving you a reassuring smile and a thumbs up. Your heart beat faster against your ribs, your nerves spiking, and you almost considered just going home and hiding from your feelings, but you forced your fear down with a deep breath and stood from your desk on shaking legs. <i>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s going to be fine.&rdquo;</i></p><p>You scanned the room anxiously, but didn&rsquo;t see the object of your affections. What if he&rsquo;d already left? Though part of you was relieved at the thought of doing this another day, you knew you needed to get this over with, for better or worse, or never have the confidence to pull it off again. You already had a tub of ice cream saved away in the freezer if it didn&rsquo;t go well.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/n).&rdquo; You jumped at the light touch to your shoulder, spinning around to face the very boy you&rsquo;d just been looking for.</p><p>&ldquo;T-Todoroki! I-um, I didn&rsquo;t see you there.&rdquo; </p><p>You cursed the stutter in your voice, gulping at the sudden dryness of your mouth. The boy in front of you took a half step back, his hand dropping to his side. &ldquo;Sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to startle you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes dropped to the floor just as his moved to study the far wall. What felt like hours was really only a few seconds as both you and he tried to think of something to say.</p><p>&ldquo;So, um-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I-&rdquo; you spoke over each other, gazes abruptly snapping back to each other. All of a sudden those unique grey and blue eyes were staring right into yours and whatever you&rsquo;d been about to say, everything you&rsquo;d practiced, flew from your mind. There was a flustered, almost dazed look in his eyes not unlike that which appeared whenever you booped his nose. Lord, why was he so beautiful?</p><p>Your hand was moving before you consciously knew what you were doing. &ldquo;Boop.&rdquo; Your index finger tapped his nose and his eyes widened. Heart racing, you froze, unable to move as mortification made your body numb. Your trembling hand remained in front of his adorably surprised face as tears began to well in the corners of your eyes, blurring your vision.</p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t it. This wasn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d been trying to do at all. You loved the look on his face whenever you booped his nose, loved the feeling of somehow being closer to him through the gesture, but now was not the time for it. It was time to seriously face him with your feelings and you blew it, letting your nerves get the best of you and making you act so foolishly. You didn&rsquo;t even really know if he liked having his nose booped or if it was an invasion of his space. At least his cute surprised face would be the last thing you saw before you died of embarrassment.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;, so sor-!&rdquo; You gasped as his hand suddenly grasped that still near his face and pulled you close. His nose brushed yours, those gorgeous eyes staring straight into your own, before his lips pressed to yours and your heart exploded. The kiss only lasted for a second, not enough time for you to respond before Todoroki pulled away, still clutching your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, (y/n). I&rsquo;m so sorry. That was too forward of me-&rdquo; You barely heard his apologies over the sound of your heart beating in your ears, your mind trying to wrap itself around what just happened. Todoroki had kissed you. Your crush had kissed you. (E/c) eyes zoned in on his lips. </p><p>And you wanted to do it again.<br/></p><p>You were fully aware of what you were doing this time as you grabbed his tie and yanked him down, smashing your mouth to his once more. The noise of surprise that echoed in the back of his throat was swallowed by your mouth as he recovered, pressing closer, his arms wrapping around your waist and pulling you against him. The butterflies that had been fluttering relentlessly in your stomach spread throughout your body, sparks dancing pleasantly beneath your skin as his lips moved over yours. </p><p>You could feel him wanting to deepen the kiss, his grip on you shifting as his face tilted for better access to your lips, but you pulled away before he could. There were still things that needed to be said between the two of you before you went any further. You giggled as his lips followed yours when you pulled. Cupping his face in yours hands to still him, you pressed your forehead to his, your nose brushing against his own as wide, adoring eyes blinked at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Todoroki, I love you.&rdquo; You were surprised to find that all your anxiety over confessing those simple, meaningful words to him had disappeared with his kiss, making way for a deep joy that manifested itself as a loving smile meant only for the boy in front of you as you gazed up at him, your thumbs stroking the soft skin of his cheeks.</p><p>A few heartbeats passed without a move or sound from Todoroki with him staring at you before he nearly collapsed against you, heaving a sigh that made his shoulders drop. His head fell to your shoulder, breathless laughter making him tremble in your arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Todoroki?&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled back just enough to look you in the eye, his hand cupping your cheek tenderly as he said, &ldquo;I love you, too, (y/n).&rdquo;</p><p>Leaning forward, he booped his nose to yours in a sign of affection you and he would share for the rest of your lives, and captured your lips once more.</p><p>At long last, your heart was fully and truly his, just as his heart would always be yours. </p><p>To think it all started with a tap on the nose&hellip;</p>",

Whatever happened today you weren\u2019t going to regret it. Grabbing your bag and slipping your shoes on, you bid a quick goodbye to your family and opened the front door, facing the ordeal that awaited you.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMidoriya, what if she really doesn\u2019t like me the way I like her?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI really don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, Todoroki. From what I\u2019ve heard and seen, she seems to be more interested in you than anyone else.\u201d</i> </p><p>Humming, the dual-haired boy sat down heavily on his bed, holding his phone to his ear. He\u2019d awoken from a restless sleep to doubt after doubt after doubt about what he planned to do today- finally confess to you. Seeing as Midoriya had clearly recognized Todoroki\u2019s feelings for you even when he himself hadn\u2019t been able to place them, he had called the other boy in hopes of settling his nerves, not knowing what else to do. \u201cWhat if I end up making a fool of myself?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cTodoroki\u2026that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he bit back, his tone made harsh by anxiety.</p><p>Midoriya didn\u2019t miss a beat. <i>\u201cBecause she\u2019s going to accept you!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</i> he wanted to ask again, but instead settled for running a hand down his face, a disgruntled noise rising in the back of his throat. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m fairly sure that she loves you, Todoroki, but you\u2019re not going to know for sure until you actually confess to her.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cThen what are you doing right now? Why are you still at home thinking about it when that isn\u2019t going to do you any good anymore?\u201d</i></p><p>Todoroki blinked, a little surprised by his timid friend\u2019s mini-outburst, but he knew he was right. He wasn\u2019t going to find the answer he so badly wanted here. His answer was out there, with you.</p><p>Filling his lungs with air, he let it out slowly,blowing red and white hair out of his face as he did. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI even heard from Jirou that-wait. I\u2019m right?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d <i>\u201cAs usual,\u201d</i> he said internally.</p><p><i>\u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re going?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d<br></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re actually going to follow through and confess?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to confess. I want her to know how I feel about her and ask her how she feels about me.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cDo you remember what we practiced? What you\u2019re going to say?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cThen get going! She\u2019s waiting for you!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you.\u201d He heard a quick \u201cgood luck\u201d before hanging up and taking a short inhale, rising to his feet. Straightening his tie and pulling on his blazer, he said goodbye to his sister before making his way out the door, hoping the day turned out favorably with you by his side at the end of it.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><i>\u201cThis is it,\u201d</i> you thought, watching the clock tick down the remaining minutes of school. While everyone was on their way out, you planned on snagging Todoroki before he could leave and taking him aside to confess. You had briefly considered waiting for him outside the gates of U.A. as he came to school that morning, but if he did end up rejecting you, you didn\u2019t want to spend the day suffering and forcing smiles through your tears.</p><p>The bell rang, making you jump in your seat, and out of the corner of your eye you caught Jirou giving you a reassuring smile and a thumbs up. Your heart beat faster against your ribs, your nerves spiking, and you almost considered just going home and hiding from your feelings, but you forced your fear down with a deep breath and stood from your desk on shaking legs. <i>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</i></p><p>You scanned the room anxiously, but didn\u2019t see the object of your affections. What if he\u2019d already left? Though part of you was relieved at the thought of doing this another day, you knew you needed to get this over with, for better or worse, or never have the confidence to pull it off again. You already had a tub of ice cream saved away in the freezer if it didn\u2019t go well.</p><p>\u201c(Y/n).\u201d You jumped at the light touch to your shoulder, spinning around to face the very boy you\u2019d just been looking for.</p><p>\u201cT-Todoroki! I-um, I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d </p><p>You cursed the stutter in your voice, gulping at the sudden dryness of your mouth. The boy in front of you took a half step back, his hand dropping to his side. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d</p><p>Your eyes dropped to the floor just as his moved to study the far wall. What felt like hours was really only a few seconds as both you and he tried to think of something to say.</p><p>\u201cSo, um-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I-\u201d you spoke over each other, gazes abruptly snapping back to each other. All of a sudden those unique grey and blue eyes were staring right into yours and whatever you\u2019d been about to say, everything you\u2019d practiced, flew from your mind. There was a flustered, almost dazed look in his eyes not unlike that which appeared whenever you booped his nose. Lord, why was he so beautiful?</p><p>Your hand was moving before you consciously knew what you were doing. \u201cBoop.\u201d Your index finger tapped his nose and his eyes widened. Heart racing, you froze, unable to move as mortification made your body numb. Your trembling hand remained in front of his adorably surprised face as tears began to well in the corners of your eyes, blurring your vision.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t it. This wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d been trying to do at all. You loved the look on his face whenever you booped his nose, loved the feeling of somehow being closer to him through the gesture, but now was not the time for it. It was time to seriously face him with your feelings and you blew it, letting your nerves get the best of you and making you act so foolishly. You didn\u2019t even really know if he liked having his nose booped or if it was an invasion of his space. At least his cute surprised face would be the last thing you saw before you died of embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019, so sor-!\u201d You gasped as his hand suddenly grasped that still near his face and pulled you close. His nose brushed yours, those gorgeous eyes staring straight into your own, before his lips pressed to yours and your heart exploded. The kiss only lasted for a second, not enough time for you to respond before Todoroki pulled away, still clutching your hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, (y/n). I\u2019m so sorry. That was too forward of me-\u201d You barely heard his apologies over the sound of your heart beating in your ears, your mind trying to wrap itself around what just happened. Todoroki had kissed you. Your crush had kissed you. (E/c) eyes zoned in on his lips. </p><p>And you wanted to do it again.<br></p><p>You were fully aware of what you were doing this time as you grabbed his tie and yanked him down, smashing your mouth to his once more. The noise of surprise that echoed in the back of his throat was swallowed by your mouth as he recovered, pressing closer, his arms wrapping around your waist and pulling you against him. The butterflies that had been fluttering relentlessly in your stomach spread throughout your body, sparks dancing pleasantly beneath your skin as his lips moved over yours. </p><p>You could feel him wanting to deepen the kiss, his grip on you shifting as his face tilted for better access to your lips, but you pulled away before he could. There were still things that needed to be said between the two of you before you went any further. You giggled as his lips followed yours when you pulled. Cupping his face in yours hands to still him, you pressed your forehead to his, your nose brushing against his own as wide, adoring eyes blinked at you.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki, I love you.\u201d You were surprised to find that all your anxiety over confessing those simple, meaningful words to him had disappeared with his kiss, making way for a deep joy that manifested itself as a loving smile meant only for the boy in front of you as you gazed up at him, your thumbs stroking the soft skin of his cheeks.</p><p>A few heartbeats passed without a move or sound from Todoroki with him staring at you before he nearly collapsed against you, heaving a sigh that made his shoulders drop. His head fell to your shoulder, breathless laughter making him tremble in your arms.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki?\u201d</p><p>He pulled back just enough to look you in the eye, his hand cupping your cheek tenderly as he said, \u201cI love you, too, (y/n).\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, he booped his nose to yours in a sign of affection you and he would share for the rest of your lives, and captured your lips once more.</p><p>At long last, your heart was fully and truly his, just as his heart would always be yours. </p><p>To think it all started with a tap on the nose\u2026</p>",

Pressing a hand to your chest, you took a few steadying breaths, trying to calm your racing heart. Looking after Todoroki, you laughed shakily. What just happened was the last thing you would\u2019ve expected from him.</i> <i><br></i></p><p><i>If your heart hadn\u2019t belonged to him already, it did now\u2026</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>Ever since your close encounter with Todoroki a few days ago, you had been a blushing mess every time he was in the room, your thoughts filled with him and him alone. You tried to tell yourself that you were being ridiculous- he\u2019d only touched his nose to yours for god\u2019s sake!- but that little gesture had been enough to make the small, hopeful part of yourself that you had tried to tuck away that much bigger.</p><p>You were beginning to think that maybe\u2026just maybe\u2026he liked you too?</p><p>No, there was no way. He couldn\u2019t possibly like you the way you liked him. He was Todoroki Shouto. Mr. Cool and Aloof. Way out of you league.</p><p>\u2026But still.</p><p>You could at least hope, couldn\u2019t you? And you had heard a few rumors from the other girls so\u2026</p><p>Groaning, you tossed in your bed, scrunching your eyes shut as you tried to banish thoughts of your crush from your mind and go to sleep. Your indecision was driving you mad. Should you confess? Not confess?</p><p>What would happen if you confessed? Either he rejected you- the more likely outcome- or he didn\u2019t and the world wasn\u2019t so cruel after all. Being with Todoroki\u2026that was something you could only dream of. He always seemed so far away, but if recent events were any indicator, maybe he wasn\u2019t as far away as you had first thought.</p><p>But what would happen if you didn\u2019t confess? Would you end up waiting for him forever only to be disappointed when some bolder girl scooped up his heart? Would you end up regretting it, lost in thoughts of what might\u2019ve been had you taken that leap of faith?</p><p>Gritting your teeth, you opened your eyes to the darkness of your room, your mind calming as resolve set in. For better or for worse, you would confess to Todoroki, if only to avoid future regret if nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Taking a deep breath in, a certain heterochromatic, dual-haired teen released it slowly, his ribs shifting beneath his hands laid atop his chest. Staring up at the shadowy ceiling of his room, Todoroki tried to organize his thoughts, but to no avail.</p><p>It was a wonder that he had gotten through the past few days without his heart exploding every time you were around. Somehow, he had managed to act normal, like he hadn\u2019t made a move on the girl he was heavily crushing on, but he couldn\u2019t keep it up for much longer. The high of acting on how he felt had worn off quickly, leaving him a doubtful mess as to how welcome his advance actually was and if he had overestimated your interest in him.</p><p>You didn\u2019t seem to hate him now, which was a good sign, but you hadn\u2019t come near him either, making a ball of anxiety form in his throat at the thought that he had made you uncomfortable or displeased you in any way.</p><p>Immediately after booping your nose with his, returning the gesture you had made so often in a much more intimate manner, he had decided to confess to you, and he still fully intended to do that, he just didn\u2019t quite know how. Todoroki certainly hadn\u2019t had the most loving childhood in the world and affection still scared him, but he truly wanted to be with you, to smile with you whenever you booped his nose in that way that made you so happy. It surprised him to find that he had missed the brief, jolting contact these past few days. He couldn\u2019t, for the life of him, understand why, but he had even begun to think that he was special to you, that the second-long contact between the pad of your finger and the tip of his nose hinted at some connection between you and he.</p><p>If he left things as they were he didn\u2019t know what would happen, but something inside him said that standing by wasn\u2019t an option. He had to reach out to you, just as you had reached out to him in a small but ever meaningful way.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no use!

Seeing as Midoriya had clearly recognized Todoroki\u2019s feelings for you even when he himself hadn\u2019t been able to place them, he had called the other boy in hopes of settling his nerves, not knowing what else to do. \u201cWhat if I end up making a fool of myself?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cTodoroki\u2026that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he bit back, his tone made harsh by anxiety.</p><p>Midoriya didn\u2019t miss a beat. <i>\u201cBecause she\u2019s going to accept you!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</i> he wanted to ask again, but instead settled for running a hand down his face, a disgruntled noise rising in the back of his throat. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m fairly sure that she loves you, Todoroki, but you\u2019re not going to know for sure until you actually confess to her.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cThen what are you doing right now? Why are you still at home thinking about it when that isn\u2019t going to do you any good anymore?\u201d</i></p><p>Todoroki blinked, a little surprised by his timid friend\u2019s mini-outburst, but he knew he was right. He wasn\u2019t going to find the answer he so badly wanted here. His answer was out there, with you.</p><p>Filling his lungs with air, he let it out slowly,blowing red and white hair out of his face as he did. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI even heard from Jirou that-wait. I\u2019m right?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d <i>\u201cAs usual,\u201d</i> he said internally.</p><p><i>\u201cSo\u2026you\u2019re going?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d<br></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re actually going to follow through and confess?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to confess. I want her to know how I feel about her and ask her how she feels about me.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cDo you remember what we practiced? What you\u2019re going to say?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cThen get going! She\u2019s waiting for you!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you.\u201d He heard a quick \u201cgood luck\u201d before hanging up and taking a short inhale, rising to his feet. Straightening his tie and pulling on his blazer, he said goodbye to his sister before making his way out the door, hoping the day turned out favorably with you by his side at the end of it.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><i>\u201cThis is it,\u201d</i> you thought, watching the clock tick down the remaining minutes of school. While everyone was on their way out, you planned on snagging Todoroki before he could leave and taking him aside to confess. You had briefly considered waiting for him outside the gates of U.A. as he came to school that morning, but if he did end up rejecting you, you didn\u2019t want to spend the day suffering and forcing smiles through your tears.</p><p>The bell rang, making you jump in your seat, and out of the corner of your eye you caught Jirou giving you a reassuring smile and a thumbs up. Your heart beat faster against your ribs, your nerves spiking, and you almost considered just going home and hiding from your feelings, but you forced your fear down with a deep breath and stood from your desk on shaking legs. <i>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</i></p><p>You scanned the room anxiously, but didn\u2019t see the object of your affections. What if he\u2019d already left? Though part of you was relieved at the thought of doing this another day, you knew you needed to get this over with, for better or worse, or never have the confidence to pull it off again. You already had a tub of ice cream saved away in the freezer if it didn\u2019t go well.</p><p>\u201c(Y/n).\u201d You jumped at the light touch to your shoulder, spinning around to face the very boy you\u2019d just been looking for.</p><p>\u201cT-Todoroki! I-um, I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d </p><p>You cursed the stutter in your voice, gulping at the sudden dryness of your mouth. The boy in front of you took a half step back, his hand dropping to his side. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d</p><p>Your eyes dropped to the floor just as his moved to study the far wall. What felt like hours was really only a few seconds as both you and he tried to think of something to say.</p><p>\u201cSo, um-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I-\u201d you spoke over each other, gazes abruptly snapping back to each other. All of a sudden those unique grey and blue eyes were staring right into yours and whatever you\u2019d been about to say, everything you\u2019d practiced, flew from your mind. There was a flustered, almost dazed look in his eyes not unlike that which appeared whenever you booped his nose. Lord, why was he so beautiful?</p><p>Your hand was moving before you consciously knew what you were doing. \u201cBoop.\u201d Your index finger tapped his nose and his eyes widened. Heart racing, you froze, unable to move as mortification made your body numb. Your trembling hand remained in front of his adorably surprised face as tears began to well in the corners of your eyes, blurring your vision.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t it. This wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d been trying to do at all. You loved the look on his face whenever you booped his nose, loved the feeling of somehow being closer to him through the gesture, but now was not the time for it. It was time to seriously face him with your feelings and you blew it, letting your nerves get the best of you and making you act so foolishly. You didn\u2019t even really know if he liked having his nose booped or if it was an invasion of his space. At least his cute surprised face would be the last thing you saw before you died of embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019, so sor-!\u201d You gasped as his hand suddenly grasped that still near his face and pulled you close. His nose brushed yours, those gorgeous eyes staring straight into your own, before his lips pressed to yours and your heart exploded. The kiss only lasted for a second, not enough time for you to respond before Todoroki pulled away, still clutching your hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, (y/n). I\u2019m so sorry. That was too forward of me-\u201d You barely heard his apologies over the sound of your heart beating in your ears, your mind trying to wrap itself around what just happened. Todoroki had kissed you. Your crush had kissed you. (E/c) eyes zoned in on his lips. </p><p>And you wanted to do it again.<br></p><p>You were fully aware of what you were doing this time as you grabbed his tie and yanked him down, smashing your mouth to his once more. The noise of surprise that echoed in the back of his throat was swallowed by your mouth as he recovered, pressing closer, his arms wrapping around your waist and pulling you against him. The butterflies that had been fluttering relentlessly in your stomach spread throughout your body, sparks dancing pleasantly beneath your skin as his lips moved over yours. </p><p>You could feel him wanting to deepen the kiss, his grip on you shifting as his face tilted for better access to your lips, but you pulled away before he could. There were still things that needed to be said between the two of you before you went any further. You giggled as his lips followed yours when you pulled. Cupping his face in yours hands to still him, you pressed your forehead to his, your nose brushing against his own as wide, adoring eyes blinked at you.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki, I love you.\u201d You were surprised to find that all your anxiety over confessing those simple, meaningful words to him had disappeared with his kiss, making way for a deep joy that manifested itself as a loving smile meant only for the boy in front of you as you gazed up at him, your thumbs stroking the soft skin of his cheeks.</p><p>A few heartbeats passed without a move or sound from Todoroki with him staring at you before he nearly collapsed against you, heaving a sigh that made his shoulders drop. His head fell to your shoulder, breathless laughter making him tremble in your arms.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki?\u201d</p><p>He pulled back just enough to look you in the eye, his hand cupping your cheek tenderly as he said, \u201cI love you, too, (y/n).\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, he booped his nose to yours in a sign of affection you and he would share for the rest of your lives, and captured your lips once more.</p><p>At long last, your heart was fully and truly his, just as his heart would always be yours. </p><p>To think it all started with a tap on the nose\u2026</p>",
                "content": "<p>A/N:&nbsp;\n\nAh, yes! It&rsquo;s what everyone&rsquo;s been demanding of me!XD Finally!\n\nI worked on it in bits until I got carsick on the way to Normandy.\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n\nBuy me a ko-fi and help me pay for university textbooks at ko-fi.com/lordsister!^^\n\n<br /></p><p>\n\nI do not own My Hero Academia, any of its characters, or the picture.\n\n<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>Your legs gave out beneath you, forcing you to slump to the floor in a blushing mess. Pressing a hand to your chest, you took a few steadying breaths, trying to calm your racing heart. Looking after Todoroki, you laughed shakily. What just happened was the last thing you would&rsquo;ve expected from him.</i> <i><br /></i></p><p><i>If your heart hadn&rsquo;t belonged to him already, it did now&hellip;</i></p><p>Ever since your close encounter with Todoroki a few days ago, you had been a blushing mess every time he was in the room, your thoughts filled with him and him alone. You tried to tell yourself that you were being ridiculous- he&rsquo;d only touched his nose to yours for god&rsquo;s sake!- but that little gesture had been enough to make the small, hopeful part of yourself that you had tried to tuck away that much bigger.</p><p>You were beginning to think that maybe&hellip;just maybe&hellip;he liked you too?</p><p>No, there was no way. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly like you the way you liked him. He was Todoroki Shouto. Mr. Cool and Aloof. Way out of you league.</p><p>&hellip;But still.</p><p>You could at least hope, couldn&rsquo;t you? And you had heard a few rumors from the other girls so&hellip;</p><p>Groaning, you tossed in your bed, scrunching your eyes shut as you tried to banish thoughts of your crush from your mind and go to sleep. Your indecision was driving you mad. Should you confess? Not confess?</p><p>What would happen if you confessed? Either he rejected you- the more likely outcome- or he didn&rsquo;t and the world wasn&rsquo;t so cruel after all. Being with Todoroki&hellip;that was something you could only dream of. He always seemed so far away, but if recent events were any indicator, maybe he wasn&rsquo;t as far away as you had first thought.</p><p>But what would happen if you didn&rsquo;t confess? Would you end up waiting for him forever only to be disappointed when some bolder girl scooped up his heart? Would you end up regretting it, lost in thoughts of what might&rsquo;ve been had you taken that leap of faith?</p><p>Gritting your teeth, you opened your eyes to the darkness of your room, your mind calming as resolve set in. For better or for worse, you would confess to Todoroki, if only to avoid future regret if nothing else.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Taking a deep breath in, a certain heterochromatic, dual-haired teen released it slowly, his ribs shifting beneath his hands laid atop his chest. Staring up at the shadowy ceiling of his room, Todoroki tried to organize his thoughts, but to no avail.</p><p>It was a wonder that he had gotten through the past few days without his heart exploding every time you were around. Somehow, he had managed to act normal, like he hadn&rsquo;t made a move on the girl he was heavily crushing on, but he couldn&rsquo;t keep it up for much longer. The high of acting on how he felt had worn off quickly, leaving him a doubtful mess as to how welcome his advance actually was and if he had overestimated your interest in him.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t seem to hate him now, which was a good sign, but you hadn&rsquo;t come near him either, making a ball of anxiety form in his throat at the thought that he had made you uncomfortable or displeased you in any way.</p><p>Immediately after booping your nose with his, returning the gesture you had made so often in a much more intimate manner, he had decided to confess to you, and he still fully intended to do that, he just didn&rsquo;t quite know how. Todoroki certainly hadn&rsquo;t had the most loving childhood in the world and affection still scared him, but he truly wanted to be with you, to smile with you whenever you booped his nose in that way that made you so happy. It surprised him to find that he had missed the brief, jolting contact these past few days. He couldn&rsquo;t, for the life of him, understand why, but he had even begun to think that he was special to you, that the second-long contact between the pad of your finger and the tip of his nose hinted at some connection between you and he.</p><p>If he left things as they were he didn&rsquo;t know what would happen, but something inside him said that standing by wasn&rsquo;t an option. He had to reach out to you, just as you had reached out to him in a small but ever meaningful way.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use! What am I even going to say?&rdquo; you practically wailed over the phone to Jirou as you struggled to pull up your sock, holding the piece of technology between your shoulder and cheek.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Listen, you&rsquo;re going to be fine! Have you seen his face every time he&rsquo;s seen you? The boy&rsquo;s got it bad!&rdquo;</i> the other girl insisted.</p><p>Today was the day you had decided to confess, having told one of your closer friends, Jirou, your plans knowing she would do all she could to help. You had been feeling fine, ready and eager to get your feelings off your chest, until now. Suddenly it was as if all of the romantic anxiety you had been actively avoiding and denying had broken through your courageous front, making you reconsider everything you had planned to say and how successful you would actually be.</p><p>Managing to pull your sock the rest of the way up your leg, you released a defeated breath. &ldquo;You know what? Maybe I just shouldn&rsquo;t do this. I mean, he probably doesn&rsquo;t even-&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;(Y/N)!!!&rdquo;</i> Jirou scolded, your name long and drawn out, and you could picture her rubbing her temple in exasperation. <i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine! Just walk up to him, say, \"Hey, Todoroki. Guess what? I love you,&rdquo; grab him be the collar and kiss him!&ldquo;</i></p><p>\"That&rsquo;s a terrible idea!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Do it! Or I&rsquo;ll tell him all of the embarrassing stories that you&rsquo;ve told me!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Your jaw dropped. &ldquo;Y-You wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I would if it means the two of you will just get together and be happy already!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Groaning, you raked a hand through your hair, undoing the work you had put into brushing it that morning. &ldquo;Okay, okay! I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Good girl!&rdquo;</i></p><p>You growled at her through the phone, ready to hang up before she stopped you with a gentler call of you name. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Take a deep breath. You love him and he loves you. It&rsquo;s going to be okay.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Following her advice, you felt your annoyance and a good portion of your stress drain away. A small smile crossed your lips. It was going to be okay. &ldquo;Thank you, Kyouka.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;No problem! When you and Todoroki get married, I&rsquo;ll be able to brag that I was the one who got you to confess to him.&rdquo;</i></p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at that. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re looking too far ahead?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Naw, girl, I know it&rsquo;s gonna happen.&rdquo; </i></p><p>You rolled your eyes humorously. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get through the actual confession first.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Whatever. I&rsquo;ll see you later. Good luck! We&rsquo;re all rooting for you!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Bye!&rdquo; Hanging up, you took another deep breath before checking your appearance in the mirror one more time. Whatever happened today you weren&rsquo;t going to regret it. Grabbing your bag and slipping your shoes on, you bid a quick goodbye to your family and opened the front door, facing the ordeal that awaited you.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Midoriya, what if she really doesn&rsquo;t like me the way I like her?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case, Todoroki. From what I&rsquo;ve heard and seen, she seems to be more interested in you than anyone else.&rdquo;</i> </p><p>Humming, the dual-haired boy sat down heavily on his bed, holding his phone to his ear.

So I wanted to ask if you could maybe do head cannons for other characters working through their insecurities? (Todoroki or Bakugo maybe?) Thank you!",
        "answer": "<p>I didn\u2019t know if this was supposed to be their S/O helping them like as their friend, or lover so I choose for it to be their S/O helping them since my blog is more romantic headcanony stuffy lol. I hope you don\u2019t mind!!</p><p><br/></p><p>Todoroki:</p><p>-Todoroki has his fair share of insecurities about himself but, he doesn\u2019t and he even feels a bit scared to admit his show his more feelings to you or to anyone. Years of his father telling him that his emotions are weak has made it hard for him to be good at anything when it comes to being social, sure Todoroki can take down a villain but, he can\u2019t even say \u2018what\u2019s the weather like\u2019 without just feeling awkward or he just has a hard time explaining himself and his feelings.\u00a0</p><p>-So helping Todoroki with his insecurities takes patience despite you being his S/O. You\u2019ll slowly learn more about him and sometimes he\u2019ll just sit down with you and talk. I imagine whenever you compliment one of his insecurities he gets all defensive and tells you it isn\u2019t true.\u00a0</p><p>-One time you held his cheek tenderly and stroked with your thumb at his scar, complimenting how handsome he is and Todoroki just sat there confused. So people decline compliments to be humble but, for Todoroki he just doesn\u2019t believe those compliments are true at first.</p><p>-Over time he\u2019ll learn to find truth in your words, then now that he starts accepting compliments he becomes a blushy mess. Through you, he\u2019ll be able to have a better grasp of both talking to people and to have more confidence in his self.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Bakugou:</p><p>-Bakugou is a confident person and yes, he pretty much just radiates that type of energy but, that doesn\u2019t mean he has his moments of sadness. He also hates to admit he needs help, he has too much pride to even attempt to ask so you can\u2019t be forceful when it comes to discussing his insecurities, instead you just have to offer your boyfriend a shoulder to cry on if he ever needed too.\u00a0</p><p>-If Bakugou ever talks about his problems to you he\u2019s probably in a fit of rage about his belief that he is the reason for All Might\u2019s end. I imagine there have been times where you just pull him into a hug, Bakugou who is too tired to even hug back just rests his head on your shoulder. He\u2019ll just cry sometimes, he feels comfortable to cry in front of you since he knows you don\u2019t think he\u2019s any less strong.\u00a0</p><p>-It\u2019s hard to convince Bakugou that he isn\u2019t the reason for All Might\u2019s end, it\u2019ll take a while because scars only heal with time. I think just listening to him is what he needs, maybe offer some of your own words.</p><p>-Give him reassurance that he\u2019s doing great and I believe that you just being yourself will help him. He doesn\u2019t want you to constantly dote over him since you sympathize for him but, he enjoys some vocal support every once and a while.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>I hope you enjoyed and have a great day!\u00a0</p><p>Ophelia</p>",
