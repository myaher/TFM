He was a tall young wizard at the age of 18 and a responsible and dutiful one, indeed. He had just fixed his orange hair in a back slick and had put on a blood red, black belted uniform with his country&rsquo;s flag sewed on the chest. The wizard had recently been promoted the role of a guardian at the Durmstrang Institue of Magical Learning for the newly created division exclusively meant to house students from Finland.</p><p>Priorly to the upcoming school year, he was now preparing for; Finland had been considered a secondary range country on Durmstrang&rsquo;s official and intricate tier system they based themselves on when selecting their students. Teens from those secondary range countries, which included but were limited to; Iceland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Romania, and Poland were squeezed together in their own division and shared their lesson&rsquo;s together, most of which were taught in English.</p><p>All students of Durmstrang, regardless of nationality and blood status were forced to pay a yearly enrollment if they wished to attend at all but pupils from Elias&rsquo;s former division had to pay more money than those from the first range divisions which were and still consists of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, and Bulgaria. Short on money, his family was not; His mother, the muggle-born witch Jenny Jaakkonnen, was a retired Auror who received large sums of karoliner (the general wizarding currency of the Nordic countries) in return from the Finnish Council of Magic for her efforts in keeping Finland&rsquo;s wizarding community safe from harm.</p><p>His dad, Aleksanteri Hokkannen was a Muggle who had greatly climbed the ladder in the military and become a high ranking officer. After being exposed to the wizarding world after he and his wife gave birth to Elias (wizards and witches are allowed to expose magic to muggles under such circumstances), he was set on giving his son the best wizarding education possible. This made Durmstrang the obvious choice, no matter the cost.</p><p>The problems arose once Elias well attended the school at the age of 12. He had at first experienced difficulties with his English and the fact that he was a half-blood amongst biased and shallow pure-blood fanatics didn&rsquo;t make things any better. Even though he was thoroughly unsatisfied with his 1st school year at Durmstrang, he frequently lied about his feelings in the letters to he wrote to his parents as he didn&rsquo;t want to disappoint them since they spent so much on his education. They had after all made up plans about how much money they needed a sacrifice to the enrollment fees for 7 years forward. They had moved out from their previously big house and rented an apartment instead, and heavily cut down on spending money at holidays and going out on the weekends. Elias would not have bared to live with himself if he let all the sacrifice and effort his parents made for him, go to waste.</p><p>To avoid confronting his parents he would stay at school at every optional break that Durmstrang offered like autumn, winter, February and spring break. As an excuse, he wrote that he was so happy with his &ldquo;friends&rdquo; that he would take every opportunity to be with them. His parents didn&rsquo;t get to hear the truth until the first summer when their son went of the ship in Riga, with tears dropping off his chins. His mother was outraged when she got to hear how he was treated by his teachers and fellow schoolmates due to his blood status and would spend the summer training and teaching Elias in all kinds of defensive and offensive magic she&rsquo;d been taught as a former Auror. She would make sure that no one messed with her son ever again, unpunished.</p><p>The second year, Elias was already surer off himself and whenever someone would insult him because off his muggle heritage or for other reasons he would argue back until he had silenced his enemy. This often resulted in him getting into many physical and magical fights with both classmates and older students. It was not uncommon for him to be sentenced to punishment labor for his behavior and his newfound disrespect of authority. Because of this, he would remain a lonely boy for a while longer, since he used to be quite difficult interacting with.</p><p>That was until the year reached spring break and the Finn had been sentenced to stay the week at school and scrub the toilets (without any magic of course) together with other teens that had been found breaching the rules of Durmstrang, including a certain Swedish boy named Ernst Eriksson. Elias found that the Swedish red-head shared the exact same blood status as he did and was just as familiar with muggle culture and technology as he was, and unlike other half-blood students, he did not suppress his interests. Ernst did not seem to care a whole lot about following the rules and norms and would gladly and did not seem to fear punishment for his risky endeavors. As time moved on they began to see each other more often outside class. Their friendship grew so strong that Elias began to take optional classes in Swedish so he could conversate with his friend in his native language and he was sure that Ernst would&rsquo;ve learned Finnish for him, had such class existed at Durmstrang.</p><p>By the age of 14 during their third year, they began to attract more and more people who felt lonely and neglected and in desperate need of a community. These were often but not limited to other people of close muggle heritage and half-breeds with one inhuman parent. This lead to them forming a group calling themselves for the &ldquo;Poisoned Bloodlines&rdquo;, with the purpose of annihilating the pure-blood student hierarchy and bring equality for all the sons and daughters of Durmstrang no matter the blood status.</p><p>What they didn&rsquo;t fully comprehend back then was that no revolution could work without somebody getting hurt, and people certainly did get hurt. As years went by the group grew and the group fell. Many quitted and left the &ldquo;Poisoned Bloodlines&rdquo; out of fear of more conflict and after a final blow during his 6th year, Ernst left as well, deeply saddening Elias. Despite all the downfalls, Elias would continue what he and his former friend had started with no consideration of backing down.</p><p>The Finnish model-student had during his previous year encouraged his fellow Finns at the school to take more responsibility and together they managed to convince the Headmaster to create a new division for their country on the behalf they would take the responsibility of all the problems and obstacles that would come with it, such as the lack of Finnish speaking teachers. As a guardian, he would be given more responsibility than other students, taking up roles like a subsidiary teacher for the youngest pupils and help the staff with various tasks whenever needed.</p><p>Elias Jaakkonen&rsquo;s daydreaming was interrupted by the deep voice from downstairs, of his military dad calling him: &ldquo;SON, hurry up! You don&rsquo;t want to make a bad impression on your big day!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father, I know!&rdquo; The teen answered. With a clear and extremely focused voice, he said &ldquo;Accio! Wingardium Leviosa! Moblicorpus!&rdquo; and with some waves with his bare hands, the last books and pieces of clothing he had yet to pack levitated into his magically expanded suitcase. &ldquo;Colloportus,&rdquo; he muttered and suitcase shut and locked itself. All the training in wandless magic and been very time consuming and exhausting but it was worth it. Now, he could say for sure that he was one of the most powerful teenage wizards in all of Europe.</p><p>&ldquo;Locomotor,&rdquo; he pronounced while stretching out his hand to the case, making it fly up in height with his ankles. He went out of his room with his case following him out to downstairs to the door.</p><p>His 50-year-old dad stood next to the door dressed in his green camouflage-colored military uniform with a smile on his lips that he rarely expressed.</p><p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s finally time to go back to your &lsquo;upper-class ghetto&rsquo; they call a school? Boy! Those snooty Swedes and Norwegians will have to look out for you. More so than before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes dad, my time at Dumbstrang never seem to have an end!&rdquo; Elias nodded. &ldquo;Oh, and the Scandinavians are not nearly the ones I need to worry the most about. There people of other nationalities too.&rdquo;</p><p>His mom came gliding towards her son and husband while sitting in her levitating wheelchair. She had her usually stern expression on her face since she never seemed to get over that she wasn&rsquo;t able to attend a real wizard school as a child and that she was magically disabled beyond repair when she was ambushed by a group of dark wizards during her late Auror year.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember Elias Mattias Jaakkonen that you and your classmates have an extra responsible over countless of other children who are in the need of guidance. I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t go full out Harry Potter when it comes to wreaking havoc with your friends at your school this year,&rdquo; she strictly but with a dice of regretfulness in her voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be trying my best Mother&rdquo; the Durmstrang'er replied.</p><p>&ldquo;So where will you take off this year? It can&rsquo;t be in Balticum like usual now that our nation has gotten a real division this year?&rdquo; Aleksaanteri asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No of course not! We will meet at the Helsinki harbor. The staff was quick enough to build a small ship in the last second. It is a small one but it doesn&rsquo;t matter really since we are not that many in comparison to the other divisions,&rdquo; his son answered his question.</p><p>&ldquo;Be sure, not splich on the way! You&rsquo;re expected to be there before the young ones do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mom, I&rsquo;m proficient enough in apparition to travel such a short stretch as the way to Helsinki. I think I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well if you say so, son! I guess there&rsquo;s no much more to say. You&rsquo;ll better be leaving.&rdquo;</p><p>Elias hugged both of his parents and gave a non-sentimental farewell. He stepped out of the apartment and left off apparating to the capital of his nation.</p>",

                "content": "<p>6 days earlier, 29 August 2017-&Aring;bo, Southern Finland</p><p>Elias Jaakkonen stood in his room at his family&rsquo;s apartment in the Finnish city of &Aring;bo. He was a tall young wizard at the age of 18 and a responsible and dutiful one, indeed. He had just fixed his orange hair in a back slick and had put on a blood red, black belted uniform with his country&rsquo;s flag sewed on the chest. The wizard had recently been promoted the role of a guardian at the Durmstrang Institue of Magical Learning for the newly created division exclusively meant to house students from Finland.</p><p>Priorly to the upcoming school year, he was now preparing for; Finland had been considered a secondary range country on Durmstrang&rsquo;s official and intricate tier system they based themselves on when selecting their students. Teens from those secondary range countries, which included but were limited to; Iceland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Romania, and Poland were squeezed together in their own division and shared their lesson&rsquo;s together, most of which were taught in English.</p><p>All students of Durmstrang, regardless of nationality and blood status were forced to pay a yearly enrollment if they wished to attend at all but pupils from Elias&rsquo;s former division had to pay more money than those from the first range divisions which were and still consists of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, and Bulgaria. Short on money, his family was not; His mother, the muggle-born witch Jenny Jaakkonnen, was a retired Auror who received large sums of karoliner (the general wizarding currency of the Nordic countries) in return from the Finnish Council of Magic for her efforts in keeping Finland&rsquo;s wizarding community safe from harm.</p><p>His dad, Aleksanteri Hokkannen was a Muggle who had greatly climbed the ladder in the military and become a high ranking officer. After being exposed to the wizarding world after he and his wife gave birth to Elias (wizards and witches are allowed to expose magic to muggles under such circumstances), he was set on giving his son the best wizarding education possible. This made Durmstrang the obvious choice, no matter the cost.</p><p>The problems arose once Elias well attended the school at the age of 12. He had at first experienced difficulties with his English and the fact that he was a half-blood amongst biased and shallow pure-blood fanatics didn&rsquo;t make things any better. Even though he was thoroughly unsatisfied with his 1st school year at Durmstrang, he frequently lied about his feelings in the letters to he wrote to his parents as he didn&rsquo;t want to disappoint them since they spent so much on his education. They had after all made up plans about how much money they needed a sacrifice to the enrollment fees for 7 years forward. They had moved out from their previously big house and rented an apartment instead, and heavily cut down on spending money at holidays and going out on the weekends. Elias would not have bared to live with himself if he let all the sacrifice and effort his parents made for him, go to waste.</p><p>To avoid confronting his parents he would stay at school at every optional break that Durmstrang offered like autumn, winter, February and spring break. As an excuse, he wrote that he was so happy with his &ldquo;friends&rdquo; that he would take every opportunity to be with them. His parents didn&rsquo;t get to hear the truth until the first summer when their son went of the ship in Riga, with tears dropping off his chins. His mother was outraged when she got to hear how he was treated by his teachers and fellow schoolmates due to his blood status and would spend the summer training and teaching Elias in all kinds of defensive and offensive magic she&rsquo;d been taught as a former Auror.
