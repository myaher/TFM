(\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89*:\uff65\uff9f\u2727</p>\nExpect art, places and waves of my Holy Trinity aka Homestuck, Dark Souls and One Piece. Other regulars are Undertale, HeroAca and clods + some original content /see link below/. I also blog about everything that I find interesting or pretty- may include triggering (like, idk... gore) or angering (politics, mlp, you name it) stuff; otherwise this blog is pretty sfw and if you'd rather I tagged something, go ahead and ask and I'll do my best to remember! (\u00b4\u02d9v\u02d9`) NOTE: I've had enough of bots, so if you have a sfw blog follow me with that one because I WILL INSTABAN ANYONE WITH MORE THAN ONE IMAGE/PAGE OF THE NASTIES.",
