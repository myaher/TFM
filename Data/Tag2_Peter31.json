\u27f6</p><p>It\u2019s February twelfth and New York City is very cold.<br/></p><p>The sun has set, blanketing the city in a chill that hits you to your bones. Bria wishes she would\u2019ve had the forethought to bring her coat. Instead, she holds her arms tightly to her torso, wishing the wind would let up. Bright yellow lights do nothing to warm the streets, nor do the throngs of people surging past her. She notices her shoes make much less sound compared to theirs, the crowds. She longs for home, but only for a second.</p><!-- more --><p><i>Once, twice she flicks the light switch, watching for the hanging bulb in the center of the kitchen to turn on. Once, twice it does not.</i></p><p><i>\u201cElectric\u2019s out again,\u201d she calls. Her voice bounces off of damp wooden walls. Strange how something so spongy doesn\u2019t absorb what she yells.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d a deep voice shouts back. \u201cQuit reminding me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bria sighs. She has quit reminding her, and for the past six months, it\u2019s been a gamble as to whether the lights will work or not. It\u2019s tiresome.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDid you even pay it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAs if that\u2019s any of your business. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in the garden?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bria shivers and clutches her sides. She\u2019d rather be anywhere but there; the dirt is cold and hard-packed and weeds slither like snakes under her feet. It unsettles her more than sitting in the house does.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lies.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI find that hard to believe. Get out there, make yourself useful.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She bites her lip. \u201cThey have enough help out there. I\u2019m too tired today.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Heavy footsteps trod toward the kitchen and Bria finds herself staring at a very familiar and very tall figure.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd I\u2019m too tired to deal with this. Go.\u201d</i></p><p><i>There\u2019s no sense in arguing further, so she does, but she feels dirty all the way out the door.</i></p><p>And the second passes.</p><p>She ducks into what must be a pub; the music is trashy and loud and it smells like sweat, but it\u2019s better than being out in the cold. There aren\u2019t any seats, so she settles for leaning on the wall near the door.</p><p>People of all kinds (well, mostly brooding men) line the bar and wooden tables. Heavy accents fall from the lips of heavy-set bartenders and frothy mugs jut from calloused hands. Bria rubs hers together, struggling to find comfort in the space. It becomes even harder when a man sidles up next to her. His breath is laden with whiskey and slime when he speaks.</p><p>\u201cYou look lonely,\u201d he comments, crossing his feet at the ankles. His position mimics hers as he leans up against the wall. Bria looks down at the floor, pretending to study the cracks in the oak.</p><p>\u201cNot talkative, huh? That\u2019s okay. I like \u2018em quiet.\u201d</p><p>Her head whips up, dark hair flying past her shoulders. Her brow pulls inward into a glare</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. He actually has the gall to laugh. It\u2019s an ugly sound and it makes her stomach turn. </p><p>\u201cAh, so you do talk?\u201d he says, scratching an unshaven cheek. \u201cI was lyin\u2019 before, see. I like \u2018em vocal more than anything.\u201d</p><p>The air seems to close in around her, becoming thicker and more like smog with every word he speaks. She takes her leave and ducks past him. Unfortunately, he follows.</p><p>\u201cAw, C\u2019mon, I was just joking. Look, I\u2019ll buy you a drink. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer, just keeps on pushing through the crowd. Why is he still following? Isn\u2019t he bored yet? God, New York is sleazy.</p><p>\u201cDollface, I\u2019m talking to you., and you hear me. I know you do.\u201d</p><p>His hand brushes just inches away from her arm and she recoils so sharply she nearly collides with a waitress. Met with a searing glare, the woman passing behind her gives her just a few seconds to scan for an exit. By a miracle, she finds one; a cherry-wood door, set into the left quadrant of a wall, beams at her. She makes for it but the footsteps don\u2019t leave when the air becomes cold again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ignore me,\u201d he demands. She quickens her pace along the sidewalk, wishing every second to find a crowd to disappear into. The yellow lights from before suddenly seem glaring, seem even colder than before. Bria clasps her hands together.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t know how she\u2019s evaded him so far, but she can tell he\u2019s catching up. Even when she turns into an alley, he follows her past the garbage cans. He\u2019s angry. Now she really wishes she would have brought her coat, and not just for the cold; in one of its pockets, she knows she keeps her keys. She longs to hold them in between her fingers as some kind of deterrent, some kind of defense.</p><p>She smells the liquor on his breath again when she stumbles, barely catching herself against the brick facade of a sandwich shop. Swift for a person his size, he pins her shoulder in place.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d she says shakily. Her words are met with a sneer, of all things. Maybe he means it to be charming rather than intimidating, but all it does is bring up a familiar coil in the pit of her stomach.</p><p><i>No, </i>she begs herself. <i>Not now. Not even now.</i></p><p>Her hands grow colder and colder as she leans in and she desperately tries to will away what coils around her fingers. </p><p>\u201cNot even a smile for me?\u201d he asks. \u201cAfter all that trouble I went through for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d Her voice is small, fragile. It shakes, but she\u2019s not sure it\u2019s with fear. He seems to enjoy it if anything. She presses harder against the wall as if she might disappear into it. </p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be like that. I said I\u2019d buy you a drink, didn\u2019t I? Isn\u2019t that nice enough for you?\u201d</p><p>His hand is so firm on her arm that it almost hurts. Her whole body aches, begging for the satisfaction, begging her to let go. Why won\u2019t he just <i>leave?</i></p><p>\u201cI just.. I just wanna go home.\u201d</p><p>A bold lie (for her, at least), but maybe it\u2019ll work.</p><p>\u201cHow about I take you home?\u201d</p><p>Nope. No dice.</p><p>Her teeth chatter before she clenches them tightly, holding her breath whenever he exhales against her face. It\u2019s a dangerous dance of will versus nature; her hands are starting to hurt so badly that she can\u2019t brush it off as the cold. She knows what it is no matter how much she wants to deny it.</p><p>\u201cHuh? We\u2019d have fun, I bet. We could have that drink there instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, sir, please. Let me leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout your number, at least? Not a chance.\u201d</p><p>Bria glances frantically around, but no one looks back. Doesn\u2019t anybody pay attention anymore? Or care? All it would take is a shout to distract him. To spare him.</p><p>He sighs and goes to grab her other arm.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m a nice guy,\u201d he says, sliding his hand painstakingly slowly down past her elbow. Down to her hand.</p><p><i>No. Nope. Not a chance.</i></p><p>\u2018No,\u201d she tries, \u201cd-don\u2019t touch me. Please don\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>His face is so close to hers she wants to vomit. She can tell he\u2019s looking at her mouth and her whole body almost lurches.</p><p><i>Anybody? Anybody?</i> She cries out in her head as if someone might hear her. More protests die on her lips. He leans in to swallow them, and she panics.</p><p>The coiling in her stomach unravels when she screams, exploding in a burst of amber-yellow light. It chokes him like pollen, like stepping into a muggy, flower-filled field. Except this isn\u2019t quite so pretty. The leering man is punted away by the force of it. His skin turns a sickly gray color. Whatever he wants to say is swallowed by the smog of energy taking his. Her energy. He falls to his knees.</p><p>And god, does she feel it flowing into her, feels the force of him. His organs pulse with untapped fuel, quickening and slowing in a delightful pattern. He\u2019s choking on her, looking stricken and panicked as she was only a moment ago. And it feels <i>good</i>.</p><p>Good until she hears the screaming.</p><p>It\u2019s not him, but it is the cries of nearly every other person wandering the avenue. Wide eyes find her first, watching her stand with her fingers curled around yellow light and her eyes so contrastingly dark. She releases his life so fast that she collapses onto her knees\u2014 it takes some of her own with it. She gasps for breath.</p><p>Scrambling to his feet, he spits at her. Bria can\u2019t blame him, can\u2019t even bring the energy to quip back, but she still curls inward. </p><p>\u2018Fuckin\u2019 freak,\u201d he hisses, but somehow still sounds petrified. \u201cWhat in the fuck did you just do to me?\u201d </p><p>Bria swears to god she sees his large brown boot rear back and aim for a kick. Her vision is going dark without a blow to the head; imagining what that would do to her right now makes her dizzy. But the blow never lands.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Someone shouts, a little high-pitched, but authoritative. Bria can\u2019t see the man\u2019s face this time, but he stumbles back so quickly he nearly falls on his ass.</p><p>\u201cO-oh, holy shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Get out of here! You don\u2019t kick someone when they\u2019re down, asshole!\u201d</p><p>She hears a very distinct <i>thwip</i> sound\u2014 a few in quick succession, in fact\u2014 before a lithe body thuds just a few feet before her. The leering man turns on his heel and runs away.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you all doing?!\u201d The voice yells again. Bria, from her curled position on the cement, spots red feet turning away from her. She thinks they look like socks, but then\u2026 she\u2019s barely awake, what does she know? She\u2019s never heard so many people hurry away so quickly before, though.</p><p>The red-footed figure crouches before her next, placing a gentle hand on her arm.</p><p><i>I wish you were afraid.</i></p><p>Panic surges in her chest. Without energy, though, it dies as quickly as it came. Her breathing comes in shallow pants and is muffled by her arms around her face.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d The figure asks, ever-so-gentle. Too gentle for someone like her. </p><p>She can\u2019t answer; every time she opens her mouth, it closes again. He doesn\u2019t press for an answer, so maybe he gets it. It\u2019s a miracle he\u2019s not yelling at her, too. There\u2019s no way he didn\u2019t see\u2026 that. But suddenly he\u2019s panicked, too.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, uh\u2026 Oh, god, you can\u2019t stay out here, can you? Of course, you can\u2019t. Um\u2026\u201d</p><p>If not for the aching pressure on her chest, Bria might\u2019ve laughed. She also might\u2019ve shoved his hand off of her.</p><p>It takes him a moment to regain sense. He leans in close, craning his neck to catch her eyes. Her vision spots, barely catching his features. In fact, all she sees is white where his eyes should be and the same red skin of his feet. </p><p><i>Hallucinations. Holy shit. Need to get better at this part. </i></p><p>He starts talking to himself, running a hand (which is <i>also</i> red. What the hell is this guy?) over his face.</p><p>\u201cWhere do I even\u2026 Home? No, god, May would freak.. Wait.\u201d</p><p>Whatever his face is made of, Bria sees it brighten even through her spotty vision. She\u2019s curious but too spent to question him. </p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m gonna take you somewhere safe, okay? Can I move you? Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods. Something about his tone manages to assure her. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s giving her a choice, which is mildly ridiculous. What other option does she have? It\u2019s not as if she\u2019s in a position to argue refuge.</p><p>Noting her meek nod, he wraps an arm around her back. She feels herself being lifted off the ground and against something solid and warm. The sensation almost makes her pass out.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t throw up on me,\u201d is the last thing he says. After that, a sharp pull at her navel tells her they\u2019ve been lifted into the air. With that, she does pass out.</p>",

\u27f6</p><p>It\u2019s February twelfth and New York City is very cold.<br></p><p>The sun has set, blanketing the city in a chill that hits you to your bones. Bria wishes she would\u2019ve had the forethought to bring her coat. Instead, she holds her arms tightly to her torso, wishing the wind would let up. Bright yellow lights do nothing to warm the streets, nor do the throngs of people surging past her. She notices her shoes make much less sound compared to theirs, the crowds. She longs for home, but only for a second.</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>Once, twice she flicks the light switch, watching for the hanging bulb in the center of the kitchen to turn on. Once, twice it does not.</i></p><p><i>\u201cElectric\u2019s out again,\u201d she calls. Her voice bounces off of damp wooden walls. Strange how something so spongy doesn\u2019t absorb what she yells.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d a deep voice shouts back. \u201cQuit reminding me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bria sighs. She has quit reminding her, and for the past six months, it\u2019s been a gamble as to whether the lights will work or not. It\u2019s tiresome.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDid you even pay it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAs if that\u2019s any of your business. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in the garden?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bria shivers and clutches her sides. She\u2019d rather be anywhere but there; the dirt is cold and hard-packed and weeds slither like snakes under her feet. It unsettles her more than sitting in the house does.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lies.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI find that hard to believe. Get out there, make yourself useful.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She bites her lip. \u201cThey have enough help out there. I\u2019m too tired today.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Heavy footsteps trod toward the kitchen and Bria finds herself staring at a very familiar and very tall figure.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd I\u2019m too tired to deal with this. Go.\u201d</i></p><p><i>There\u2019s no sense in arguing further, so she does, but she feels dirty all the way out the door.</i></p><p>And the second passes.</p><p>She ducks into what must be a pub; the music is trashy and loud and it smells like sweat, but it\u2019s better than being out in the cold. There aren\u2019t any seats, so she settles for leaning on the wall near the door.</p><p>People of all kinds (well, mostly brooding men) line the bar and wooden tables. Heavy accents fall from the lips of heavy-set bartenders and frothy mugs jut from calloused hands. Bria rubs hers together, struggling to find comfort in the space. It becomes even harder when a man sidles up next to her. His breath is laden with whiskey and slime when he speaks.</p><p>\u201cYou look lonely,\u201d he comments, crossing his feet at the ankles. His position mimics hers as he leans up against the wall. Bria looks down at the floor, pretending to study the cracks in the oak.</p><p>\u201cNot talkative, huh? That\u2019s okay. I like \u2018em quiet.\u201d</p><p>Her head whips up, dark hair flying past her shoulders. Her brow pulls inward into a glare</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. He actually has the gall to laugh. It\u2019s an ugly sound and it makes her stomach turn. </p><p>\u201cAh, so you do talk?\u201d he says, scratching an unshaven cheek. \u201cI was lyin\u2019 before, see. I like \u2018em vocal more than anything.\u201d</p><p>The air seems to close in around her, becoming thicker and more like smog with every word he speaks. She takes her leave and ducks past him. Unfortunately, he follows.</p><p>\u201cAw, C\u2019mon, I was just joking. Look, I\u2019ll buy you a drink. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer, just keeps on pushing through the crowd. Why is he still following? Isn\u2019t he bored yet? God, New York is sleazy.</p><p>\u201cDollface, I\u2019m talking to you., and you hear me. I know you do.\u201d</p><p>His hand brushes just inches away from her arm and she recoils so sharply she nearly collides with a waitress. Met with a searing glare, the woman passing behind her gives her just a few seconds to scan for an exit. By a miracle, she finds one; a cherry-wood door, set into the left quadrant of a wall, beams at her. She makes for it but the footsteps don\u2019t leave when the air becomes cold again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ignore me,\u201d he demands. She quickens her pace along the sidewalk, wishing every second to find a crowd to disappear into. The yellow lights from before suddenly seem glaring, seem even colder than before. Bria clasps her hands together.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t know how she\u2019s evaded him so far, but she can tell he\u2019s catching up. Even when she turns into an alley, he follows her past the garbage cans. He\u2019s angry. Now she really wishes she would have brought her coat, and not just for the cold; in one of its pockets, she knows she keeps her keys. She longs to hold them in between her fingers as some kind of deterrent, some kind of defense.</p><p>She smells the liquor on his breath again when she stumbles, barely catching herself against the brick facade of a sandwich shop. Swift for a person his size, he pins her shoulder in place.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d she says shakily. Her words are met with a sneer, of all things. Maybe he means it to be charming rather than intimidating, but all it does is bring up a familiar coil in the pit of her stomach.</p><p><i>No, </i>she begs herself. <i>Not now. Not even now.</i></p><p>Her hands grow colder and colder as she leans in and she desperately tries to will away what coils around her fingers. </p><p>\u201cNot even a smile for me?\u201d he asks. \u201cAfter all that trouble I went through for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d Her voice is small, fragile. It shakes, but she\u2019s not sure it\u2019s with fear. He seems to enjoy it if anything. She presses harder against the wall as if she might disappear into it. </p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be like that. I said I\u2019d buy you a drink, didn\u2019t I? Isn\u2019t that nice enough for you?\u201d</p><p>His hand is so firm on her arm that it almost hurts. Her whole body aches, begging for the satisfaction, begging her to let go. Why won\u2019t he just <i>leave?</i></p><p>\u201cI just.. I just wanna go home.\u201d</p><p>A bold lie (for her, at least), but maybe it\u2019ll work.</p><p>\u201cHow about I take you home?\u201d</p><p>Nope. No dice.</p><p>Her teeth chatter before she clenches them tightly, holding her breath whenever he exhales against her face. It\u2019s a dangerous dance of will versus nature; her hands are starting to hurt so badly that she can\u2019t brush it off as the cold. She knows what it is no matter how much she wants to deny it.</p><p>\u201cHuh? We\u2019d have fun, I bet. We could have that drink there instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, sir, please. Let me leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout your number, at least? Not a chance.\u201d</p><p>Bria glances frantically around, but no one looks back. Doesn\u2019t anybody pay attention anymore? Or care? All it would take is a shout to distract him. To spare him.</p><p>He sighs and goes to grab her other arm.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m a nice guy,\u201d he says, sliding his hand painstakingly slowly down past her elbow. Down to her hand.</p><p><i>No. Nope. Not a chance.</i></p><p>\u2018No,\u201d she tries, \u201cd-don\u2019t touch me. Please don\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>His face is so close to hers she wants to vomit. She can tell he\u2019s looking at her mouth and her whole body almost lurches.</p><p><i>Anybody? Anybody?</i> She cries out in her head as if someone might hear her. More protests die on her lips. He leans in to swallow them, and she panics.</p><p>The coiling in her stomach unravels when she screams, exploding in a burst of amber-yellow light. It chokes him like pollen, like stepping into a muggy, flower-filled field. Except this isn\u2019t quite so pretty. The leering man is punted away by the force of it. His skin turns a sickly gray color. Whatever he wants to say is swallowed by the smog of energy taking his. Her energy. He falls to his knees.</p><p>And god, does she feel it flowing into her, feels the force of him. His organs pulse with untapped fuel, quickening and slowing in a delightful pattern. He\u2019s choking on her, looking stricken and panicked as she was only a moment ago. And it feels <i>good</i>.</p><p>Good until she hears the screaming.</p><p>It\u2019s not him, but it is the cries of nearly every other person wandering the avenue. Wide eyes find her first, watching her stand with her fingers curled around yellow light and her eyes so contrastingly dark. She releases his life so fast that she collapses onto her knees\u2014 it takes some of her own with it. She gasps for breath.</p><p>Scrambling to his feet, he spits at her. Bria can\u2019t blame him, can\u2019t even bring the energy to quip back, but she still curls inward. </p><p>\u2018Fuckin\u2019 freak,\u201d he hisses, but somehow still sounds petrified. \u201cWhat in the fuck did you just do to me?\u201d </p><p>Bria swears to god she sees his large brown boot rear back and aim for a kick. Her vision is going dark without a blow to the head; imagining what that would do to her right now makes her dizzy. But the blow never lands.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Someone shouts, a little high-pitched, but authoritative. Bria can\u2019t see the man\u2019s face this time, but he stumbles back so quickly he nearly falls on his ass.</p><p>\u201cO-oh, holy shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Get out of here! You don\u2019t kick someone when they\u2019re down, asshole!\u201d</p><p>She hears a very distinct <i>thwip</i> sound\u2014 a few in quick succession, in fact\u2014 before a lithe body thuds just a few feet before her. The leering man turns on his heel and runs away.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you all doing?!\u201d The voice yells again. Bria, from her curled position on the cement, spots red feet turning away from her. She thinks they look like socks, but then\u2026 she\u2019s barely awake, what does she know? She\u2019s never heard so many people hurry away so quickly before, though.</p><p>The red-footed figure crouches before her next, placing a gentle hand on her arm.</p><p><i>I wish you were afraid.</i></p><p>Panic surges in her chest. Without energy, though, it dies as quickly as it came. Her breathing comes in shallow pants and is muffled by her arms around her face.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d The figure asks, ever-so-gentle. Too gentle for someone like her. </p><p>She can\u2019t answer; every time she opens her mouth, it closes again. He doesn\u2019t press for an answer, so maybe he gets it. It\u2019s a miracle he\u2019s not yelling at her, too. There\u2019s no way he didn\u2019t see\u2026 that. But suddenly he\u2019s panicked, too.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, uh\u2026 Oh, god, you can\u2019t stay out here, can you? Of course, you can\u2019t. Um\u2026\u201d</p><p>If not for the aching pressure on her chest, Bria might\u2019ve laughed. She also might\u2019ve shoved his hand off of her.</p><p>It takes him a moment to regain sense. He leans in close, craning his neck to catch her eyes. Her vision spots, barely catching his features. In fact, all she sees is white where his eyes should be and the same red skin of his feet. </p><p><i>Hallucinations. Holy shit. Need to get better at this part. </i></p><p>He starts talking to himself, running a hand (which is <i>also</i> red. What the hell is this guy?) over his face.</p><p>\u201cWhere do I even\u2026 Home? No, god, May would freak.. Wait.\u201d</p><p>Whatever his face is made of, Bria sees it brighten even through her spotty vision. She\u2019s curious but too spent to question him. </p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m gonna take you somewhere safe, okay? Can I move you? Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods. Something about his tone manages to assure her. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s giving her a choice, which is mildly ridiculous. What other option does she have? It\u2019s not as if she\u2019s in a position to argue refuge.</p><p>Noting her meek nod, he wraps an arm around her back. She feels herself being lifted off the ground and against something solid and warm. The sensation almost makes her pass out.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t throw up on me,\u201d is the last thing he says. After that, a sharp pull at her navel tells her they\u2019ve been lifted into the air. With that, she does pass out.</p></p>",

\u27f6</p><p>It\u2019s February twelfth and New York City is very cold.<br></p><p>The sun has set, blanketing the city in a chill that hits you to your bones. Bria wishes she would\u2019ve had the forethought to bring her coat. Instead, she holds her arms tightly to her torso, wishing the wind would let up. Bright yellow lights do nothing to warm the streets, nor do the throngs of people surging past her. She notices her shoes make much less sound compared to theirs, the crowds. She longs for home, but only for a second.</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>Once, twice she flicks the light switch, watching for the hanging bulb in the center of the kitchen to turn on. Once, twice it does not.</i></p><p><i>\u201cElectric\u2019s out again,\u201d she calls. Her voice bounces off of damp wooden walls. Strange how something so spongy doesn\u2019t absorb what she yells.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d a deep voice shouts back. \u201cQuit reminding me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bria sighs. She has quit reminding her, and for the past six months, it\u2019s been a gamble as to whether the lights will work or not. It\u2019s tiresome.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDid you even pay it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAs if that\u2019s any of your business. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in the garden?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bria shivers and clutches her sides. She\u2019d rather be anywhere but there; the dirt is cold and hard-packed and weeds slither like snakes under her feet. It unsettles her more than sitting in the house does.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Lies.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI find that hard to believe. Get out there, make yourself useful.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She bites her lip. \u201cThey have enough help out there. I\u2019m too tired today.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Heavy footsteps trod toward the kitchen and Bria finds herself staring at a very familiar and very tall figure.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd I\u2019m too tired to deal with this. Go.\u201d</i></p><p><i>There\u2019s no sense in arguing further, so she does, but she feels dirty all the way out the door.</i></p><p>And the second passes.</p><p>She ducks into what must be a pub; the music is trashy and loud and it smells like sweat, but it\u2019s better than being out in the cold. There aren\u2019t any seats, so she settles for leaning on the wall near the door.</p><p>People of all kinds (well, mostly brooding men) line the bar and wooden tables. Heavy accents fall from the lips of heavy-set bartenders and frothy mugs jut from calloused hands. Bria rubs hers together, struggling to find comfort in the space. It becomes even harder when a man sidles up next to her. His breath is laden with whiskey and slime when he speaks.</p><p>\u201cYou look lonely,\u201d he comments, crossing his feet at the ankles. His position mimics hers as he leans up against the wall. Bria looks down at the floor, pretending to study the cracks in the oak.</p><p>\u201cNot talkative, huh? That\u2019s okay. I like \u2018em quiet.\u201d</p><p>Her head whips up, dark hair flying past her shoulders. Her brow pulls inward into a glare</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. He actually has the gall to laugh. It\u2019s an ugly sound and it makes her stomach turn. </p><p>\u201cAh, so you do talk?\u201d he says, scratching an unshaven cheek. \u201cI was lyin\u2019 before, see. I like \u2018em vocal more than anything.\u201d</p><p>The air seems to close in around her, becoming thicker and more like smog with every word he speaks. She takes her leave and ducks past him. Unfortunately, he follows.</p><p>\u201cAw, C\u2019mon, I was just joking. Look, I\u2019ll buy you a drink. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer, just keeps on pushing through the crowd. Why is he still following? Isn\u2019t he bored yet? God, New York is sleazy.</p><p>\u201cDollface, I\u2019m talking to you., and you hear me. I know you do.\u201d</p><p>His hand brushes just inches away from her arm and she recoils so sharply she nearly collides with a waitress. Met with a searing glare, the woman passing behind her gives her just a few seconds to scan for an exit. By a miracle, she finds one; a cherry-wood door, set into the left quadrant of a wall, beams at her. She makes for it but the footsteps don\u2019t leave when the air becomes cold again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ignore me,\u201d he demands. She quickens her pace along the sidewalk, wishing every second to find a crowd to disappear into. The yellow lights from before suddenly seem glaring, seem even colder than before. Bria clasps her hands together.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t know how she\u2019s evaded him so far, but she can tell he\u2019s catching up. Even when she turns into an alley, he follows her past the garbage cans. He\u2019s angry. Now she really wishes she would have brought her coat, and not just for the cold; in one of its pockets, she knows she keeps her keys. She longs to hold them in between her fingers as some kind of deterrent, some kind of defense.</p><p>She smells the liquor on his breath again when she stumbles, barely catching herself against the brick facade of a sandwich shop. Swift for a person his size, he pins her shoulder in place.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d she says shakily. Her words are met with a sneer, of all things. Maybe he means it to be charming rather than intimidating, but all it does is bring up a familiar coil in the pit of her stomach.</p><p><i>No, </i>she begs herself. <i>Not now. Not even now.</i></p><p>Her hands grow colder and colder as she leans in and she desperately tries to will away what coils around her fingers. </p><p>\u201cNot even a smile for me?\u201d he asks. \u201cAfter all that trouble I went through for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d Her voice is small, fragile. It shakes, but she\u2019s not sure it\u2019s with fear. He seems to enjoy it if anything. She presses harder against the wall as if she might disappear into it. </p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be like that. I said I\u2019d buy you a drink, didn\u2019t I? Isn\u2019t that nice enough for you?\u201d</p><p>His hand is so firm on her arm that it almost hurts. Her whole body aches, begging for the satisfaction, begging her to let go. Why won\u2019t he just <i>leave?</i></p><p>\u201cI just.. I just wanna go home.\u201d</p><p>A bold lie (for her, at least), but maybe it\u2019ll work.</p><p>\u201cHow about I take you home?\u201d</p><p>Nope. No dice.</p><p>Her teeth chatter before she clenches them tightly, holding her breath whenever he exhales against her face. It\u2019s a dangerous dance of will versus nature; her hands are starting to hurt so badly that she can\u2019t brush it off as the cold. She knows what it is no matter how much she wants to deny it.</p><p>\u201cHuh? We\u2019d have fun, I bet. We could have that drink there instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, sir, please. Let me leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout your number, at least? Not a chance.\u201d</p><p>Bria glances frantically around, but no one looks back. Doesn\u2019t anybody pay attention anymore? Or care? All it would take is a shout to distract him. To spare him.</p><p>He sighs and goes to grab her other arm.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m a nice guy,\u201d he says, sliding his hand painstakingly slowly down past her elbow. Down to her hand.</p><p><i>No. Nope. Not a chance.</i></p><p>\u2018No,\u201d she tries, \u201cd-don\u2019t touch me. Please don\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>His face is so close to hers she wants to vomit. She can tell he\u2019s looking at her mouth and her whole body almost lurches.</p><p><i>Anybody? Anybody?</i> She cries out in her head as if someone might hear her. More protests die on her lips. He leans in to swallow them, and she panics.</p><p>The coiling in her stomach unravels when she screams, exploding in a burst of amber-yellow light. It chokes him like pollen, like stepping into a muggy, flower-filled field. Except this isn\u2019t quite so pretty. The leering man is punted away by the force of it. His skin turns a sickly gray color. Whatever he wants to say is swallowed by the smog of energy taking his. Her energy. He falls to his knees.</p><p>And god, does she feel it flowing into her, feels the force of him. His organs pulse with untapped fuel, quickening and slowing in a delightful pattern. He\u2019s choking on her, looking stricken and panicked as she was only a moment ago. And it feels <i>good</i>.</p><p>Good until she hears the screaming.</p><p>It\u2019s not him, but it is the cries of nearly every other person wandering the avenue. Wide eyes find her first, watching her stand with her fingers curled around yellow light and her eyes so contrastingly dark. She releases his life so fast that she collapses onto her knees\u2014 it takes some of her own with it. She gasps for breath.</p><p>Scrambling to his feet, he spits at her. Bria can\u2019t blame him, can\u2019t even bring the energy to quip back, but she still curls inward. </p><p>\u2018Fuckin\u2019 freak,\u201d he hisses, but somehow still sounds petrified. \u201cWhat in the fuck did you just do to me?\u201d </p><p>Bria swears to god she sees his large brown boot rear back and aim for a kick. Her vision is going dark without a blow to the head; imagining what that would do to her right now makes her dizzy. But the blow never lands.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Someone shouts, a little high-pitched, but authoritative. Bria can\u2019t see the man\u2019s face this time, but he stumbles back so quickly he nearly falls on his ass.</p><p>\u201cO-oh, holy shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Get out of here! You don\u2019t kick someone when they\u2019re down, asshole!\u201d</p><p>She hears a very distinct <i>thwip</i> sound\u2014 a few in quick succession, in fact\u2014 before a lithe body thuds just a few feet before her. The leering man turns on his heel and runs away.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you all doing?!\u201d The voice yells again. Bria, from her curled position on the cement, spots red feet turning away from her. She thinks they look like socks, but then\u2026 she\u2019s barely awake, what does she know? She\u2019s never heard so many people hurry away so quickly before, though.</p><p>The red-footed figure crouches before her next, placing a gentle hand on her arm.</p><p><i>I wish you were afraid.</i></p><p>Panic surges in her chest. Without energy, though, it dies as quickly as it came. Her breathing comes in shallow pants and is muffled by her arms around her face.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d The figure asks, ever-so-gentle. Too gentle for someone like her. </p><p>She can\u2019t answer; every time she opens her mouth, it closes again. He doesn\u2019t press for an answer, so maybe he gets it. It\u2019s a miracle he\u2019s not yelling at her, too. There\u2019s no way he didn\u2019t see\u2026 that. But suddenly he\u2019s panicked, too.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, uh\u2026 Oh, god, you can\u2019t stay out here, can you? Of course, you can\u2019t. Um\u2026\u201d</p><p>If not for the aching pressure on her chest, Bria might\u2019ve laughed. She also might\u2019ve shoved his hand off of her.</p><p>It takes him a moment to regain sense. He leans in close, craning his neck to catch her eyes. Her vision spots, barely catching his features. In fact, all she sees is white where his eyes should be and the same red skin of his feet. </p><p><i>Hallucinations. Holy shit. Need to get better at this part. </i></p><p>He starts talking to himself, running a hand (which is <i>also</i> red. What the hell is this guy?) over his face.</p><p>\u201cWhere do I even\u2026 Home? No, god, May would freak.. Wait.\u201d</p><p>Whatever his face is made of, Bria sees it brighten even through her spotty vision. She\u2019s curious but too spent to question him. </p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m gonna take you somewhere safe, okay? Can I move you? Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods. Something about his tone manages to assure her. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s giving her a choice, which is mildly ridiculous. What other option does she have? It\u2019s not as if she\u2019s in a position to argue refuge.</p><p>Noting her meek nod, he wraps an arm around her back. She feels herself being lifted off the ground and against something solid and warm.

Bria wishes she would&rsquo;ve had the forethought to bring her coat. Instead, she holds her arms tightly to her torso, wishing the wind would let up. Bright yellow lights do nothing to warm the streets, nor do the throngs of people surging past her. She notices her shoes make much less sound compared to theirs, the crowds. She longs for home, but only for a second.</p><p><i>Once, twice she flicks the light switch, watching for the hanging bulb in the center of the kitchen to turn on. Once, twice it does not.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Electric&rsquo;s out again,&rdquo; she calls. Her voice bounces off of damp wooden walls. Strange how something so spongy doesn&rsquo;t absorb what she yells.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; a deep voice shouts back. &ldquo;Quit reminding me.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bria sighs. She has quit reminding her, and for the past six months, it&rsquo;s been a gamble as to whether the lights will work or not. It&rsquo;s tiresome.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Did you even pay it?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;As if that&rsquo;s any of your business. Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be in the garden?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bria shivers and clutches her sides. She&rsquo;d rather be anywhere but there; the dirt is cold and hard-packed and weeds slither like snakes under her feet. It unsettles her more than sitting in the house does.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Lies.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I find that hard to believe. Get out there, make yourself useful.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>She bites her lip. &ldquo;They have enough help out there. I&rsquo;m too tired today.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Heavy footsteps trod toward the kitchen and Bria finds herself staring at a very familiar and very tall figure.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m too tired to deal with this. Go.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>There&rsquo;s no sense in arguing further, so she does, but she feels dirty all the way out the door.</i></p><p>And the second passes.</p><p>She ducks into what must be a pub; the music is trashy and loud and it smells like sweat, but it&rsquo;s better than being out in the cold. There aren&rsquo;t any seats, so she settles for leaning on the wall near the door.</p><p>People of all kinds (well, mostly brooding men) line the bar and wooden tables. Heavy accents fall from the lips of heavy-set bartenders and frothy mugs jut from calloused hands. Bria rubs hers together, struggling to find comfort in the space. It becomes even harder when a man sidles up next to her. His breath is laden with whiskey and slime when he speaks.</p><p>&ldquo;You look lonely,&rdquo; he comments, crossing his feet at the ankles. His position mimics hers as he leans up against the wall. Bria looks down at the floor, pretending to study the cracks in the oak.</p><p>&ldquo;Not talkative, huh? That&rsquo;s okay. I like &lsquo;em quiet.&rdquo;</p><p>Her head whips up, dark hair flying past her shoulders. Her brow pulls inward into a glare</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p><p>He laughs. He actually has the gall to laugh. It&rsquo;s an ugly sound and it makes her stomach turn. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah, so you do talk?&rdquo; he says, scratching an unshaven cheek. &ldquo;I was lyin&rsquo; before, see. I like &lsquo;em vocal more than anything.&rdquo;</p><p>The air seems to close in around her, becoming thicker and more like smog with every word he speaks. She takes her leave and ducks past him. Unfortunately, he follows.</p><p>&ldquo;Aw, C&rsquo;mon, I was just joking. Look, I&rsquo;ll buy you a drink. How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t answer, just keeps on pushing through the crowd. Why is he still following? Isn&rsquo;t he bored yet? God, New York is sleazy.</p><p>&ldquo;Dollface, I&rsquo;m talking to you., and you hear me. I know you do.&rdquo;</p><p>His hand brushes just inches away from her arm and she recoils so sharply she nearly collides with a waitress. Met with a searing glare, the woman passing behind her gives her just a few seconds to scan for an exit. By a miracle, she finds one; a cherry-wood door, set into the left quadrant of a wall, beams at her. She makes for it but the footsteps don&rsquo;t leave when the air becomes cold again.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ignore me,&rdquo; he demands. She quickens her pace along the sidewalk, wishing every second to find a crowd to disappear into. The yellow lights from before suddenly seem glaring, seem even colder than before. Bria clasps her hands together.</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t know how she&rsquo;s evaded him so far, but she can tell he&rsquo;s catching up. Even when she turns into an alley, he follows her past the garbage cans. He&rsquo;s angry. Now she really wishes she would have brought her coat, and not just for the cold; in one of its pockets, she knows she keeps her keys. She longs to hold them in between her fingers as some kind of deterrent, some kind of defense.</p><p>She smells the liquor on his breath again when she stumbles, barely catching herself against the brick facade of a sandwich shop. Swift for a person his size, he pins her shoulder in place.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave me alone,&rdquo; she says shakily. Her words are met with a sneer, of all things. Maybe he means it to be charming rather than intimidating, but all it does is bring up a familiar coil in the pit of her stomach.</p><p><i>No, </i>she begs herself. <i>Not now. Not even now.</i></p><p>Her hands grow colder and colder as she leans in and she desperately tries to will away what coils around her fingers. </p><p>&ldquo;Not even a smile for me?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;After all that trouble I went through for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo; Her voice is small, fragile. It shakes, but she&rsquo;s not sure it&rsquo;s with fear. He seems to enjoy it if anything. She presses harder against the wall as if she might disappear into it. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be like that. I said I&rsquo;d buy you a drink, didn&rsquo;t I? Isn&rsquo;t that nice enough for you?&rdquo;</p><p>His hand is so firm on her arm that it almost hurts. Her whole body aches, begging for the satisfaction, begging her to let go. Why won&rsquo;t he just <i>leave?</i></p><p>&ldquo;I just.. I just wanna go home.&rdquo;</p><p>A bold lie (for her, at least), but maybe it&rsquo;ll work.</p><p>&ldquo;How about I take you home?&rdquo;</p><p>Nope. No dice.</p><p>Her teeth chatter before she clenches them tightly, holding her breath whenever he exhales against her face. It&rsquo;s a dangerous dance of will versus nature; her hands are starting to hurt so badly that she can&rsquo;t brush it off as the cold. She knows what it is no matter how much she wants to deny it.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh? We&rsquo;d have fun, I bet. We could have that drink there instead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. No, sir, please. Let me leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Without your number, at least? Not a chance.&rdquo;</p><p>Bria glances frantically around, but no one looks back. Doesn&rsquo;t anybody pay attention anymore? Or care? All it would take is a shout to distract him. To spare him.</p><p>He sighs and goes to grab her other arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m a nice guy,&rdquo; he says, sliding his hand painstakingly slowly down past her elbow. Down to her hand.</p><p><i>No. Nope. Not a chance.</i></p><p>&lsquo;No,&rdquo; she tries, &ldquo;d-don&rsquo;t touch me. Please don&rsquo;t touch me.&rdquo;</p><p>His face is so close to hers she wants to vomit. She can tell he&rsquo;s looking at her mouth and her whole body almost lurches.</p><p><i>Anybody? Anybody?</i> She cries out in her head as if someone might hear her. More protests die on her lips. He leans in to swallow them, and she panics.</p><p>The coiling in her stomach unravels when she screams, exploding in a burst of amber-yellow light. It chokes him like pollen, like stepping into a muggy, flower-filled field. Except this isn&rsquo;t quite so pretty. The leering man is punted away by the force of it. His skin turns a sickly gray color. Whatever he wants to say is swallowed by the smog of energy taking his. Her energy. He falls to his knees.</p><p>And god, does she feel it flowing into her, feels the force of him. His organs pulse with untapped fuel, quickening and slowing in a delightful pattern. He&rsquo;s choking on her, looking stricken and panicked as she was only a moment ago. And it feels <i>good</i>.</p><p>Good until she hears the screaming.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not him, but it is the cries of nearly every other person wandering the avenue. Wide eyes find her first, watching her stand with her fingers curled around yellow light and her eyes so contrastingly dark. She releases his life so fast that she collapses onto her knees&mdash; it takes some of her own with it. She gasps for breath.</p><p>Scrambling to his feet, he spits at her. Bria can&rsquo;t blame him, can&rsquo;t even bring the energy to quip back, but she still curls inward. </p><p>&lsquo;Fuckin&rsquo; freak,&rdquo; he hisses, but somehow still sounds petrified. &ldquo;What in the fuck did you just do to me?&rdquo; </p><p>Bria swears to god she sees his large brown boot rear back and aim for a kick. Her vision is going dark without a blow to the head; imagining what that would do to her right now makes her dizzy. But the blow never lands.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Someone shouts, a little high-pitched, but authoritative. Bria can&rsquo;t see the man&rsquo;s face this time, but he stumbles back so quickly he nearly falls on his ass.</p><p>&ldquo;O-oh, holy shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing? Get out of here! You don&rsquo;t kick someone when they&rsquo;re down, asshole!&rdquo;</p><p>She hears a very distinct <i>thwip</i> sound&mdash; a few in quick succession, in fact&mdash; before a lithe body thuds just a few feet before her. The leering man turns on his heel and runs away.</p><p>&ldquo;And what are you all doing?!&rdquo; The voice yells again. Bria, from her curled position on the cement, spots red feet turning away from her. She thinks they look like socks, but then&hellip; she&rsquo;s barely awake, what does she know? She&rsquo;s never heard so many people hurry away so quickly before, though.</p><p>The red-footed figure crouches before her next, placing a gentle hand on her arm.</p><p><i>I wish you were afraid.</i></p><p>Panic surges in her chest. Without energy, though, it dies as quickly as it came. Her breathing comes in shallow pants and is muffled by her arms around her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; The figure asks, ever-so-gentle. Too gentle for someone like her. </p><p>She can&rsquo;t answer; every time she opens her mouth, it closes again. He doesn&rsquo;t press for an answer, so maybe he gets it. It&rsquo;s a miracle he&rsquo;s not yelling at her, too. There&rsquo;s no way he didn&rsquo;t see&hellip; that. But suddenly he&rsquo;s panicked, too.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay, uh&hellip; Oh, god, you can&rsquo;t stay out here, can you? Of course, you can&rsquo;t. Um&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>If not for the aching pressure on her chest, Bria might&rsquo;ve laughed. She also might&rsquo;ve shoved his hand off of her.</p><p>It takes him a moment to regain sense. He leans in close, craning his neck to catch her eyes. Her vision spots, barely catching his features. In fact, all she sees is white where his eyes should be and the same red skin of his feet. </p><p><i>Hallucinations. Holy shit. Need to get better at this part. </i></p><p>He starts talking to himself, running a hand (which is <i>also</i> red. What the hell is this guy?) over his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do I even&hellip; Home? No, god, May would freak.. Wait.&rdquo;</p><p>Whatever his face is made of, Bria sees it brighten even through her spotty vision. She&rsquo;s curious but too spent to question him. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m gonna take you somewhere safe, okay? Can I move you? Is that okay?&rdquo;</p><p>She nods. Something about his tone manages to assure her. Maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that he&rsquo;s giving her a choice, which is mildly ridiculous. What other option does she have? It&rsquo;s not as if she&rsquo;s in a position to argue refuge.</p><p>Noting her meek nod, he wraps an arm around her back. She feels herself being lifted off the ground and against something solid and warm.
