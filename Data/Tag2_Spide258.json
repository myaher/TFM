It hasn\u2019t been so long since we&rsquo;d been through puberty, maybe three years. I&rsquo;m no\nlonger that little girl in the first grade. The ponytails were less usual and my legs still a little crooked, but that&rsquo;s part of the charm (if Jensen Ackles has\nit, who am I to complain?)</p><p>And Peter? He still wore those sweatshirts larger than\nhim and he was getting smarter. He is a genius. And he was still my hero.\u00a0</p><p>I leaned my head in my desk, listening to the chalk\nscratch the blackboard while the teacher explained how to solve a chemistry\nexercise. I had already given up trying to understand stoichiometric calculus,\nthose thousands numbers and letters made me believe that hell is real.</p><p>Peter kept his cheek resting on his notebook, kneading\nit a little, which left him with a fluffy pout, and his hair a little\nmessy.</p><p>We held our gazes for a long time, until he moved his\nlong, beautiful fingers against my hair, making me close my eyes and enjoy the\ncaress until the teacher said in a good tone &ldquo;Y/L/N and Parker, classroom\nis no place for dating.&rdquo; making him blush and push his hand away.</p><p>As I dragged my feet through the large corridors, with\nNed talking about a new cafeteria that had opened near the school, my eyes\nscanned the students, watching them hurry up to buy cupcakes from a little\ngirl, that Ned told me later it was some teacher\u2019s daughter.\u00a0</p><p>And\nguess where Peter was? That&rsquo;s right, he was in the long row just to help her.</p><p>Peter appeared with his chin all covered with\nchocolate as he grumbled softly about how the only strawberry-stuffed dumplings\nwas sold, leaving only passion fruit and they were too sour. I laughed as I\ntook a napkin to wipe his face, taking the cupcake from his hand, which was already in\nhalf and replacing mine (being friends with MJ gives a lot of perks). He\nlooked at the cupcake with a devotion that I thought he would ask it for marriage.\nIt wasn\u2019t more than three minutes before I had to get another napkin to wipe\nhis face again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Ned suddenly asked loudly,\nmaking almost everyone at the table turn to him. I pointed to myself asking if\nhe was talking to me, as soon as he acquiesced, I did the same, giving him the\nliberty to ask such a question. &ldquo;Frankly, didn\u2019t you two ever give each\nother a kiss, make out or something?&rdquo; I gasped for air at that moment. I glanced sideways at Peter, who also seemed\nembarrassed by such a question. For some reason, that month, Ned had stuck his\nhead that we had something.</p><p>Seeing all the people at the table looking at me made\nme believe that almost everyone had the same doubt as him, I let out a low\nlaugh and shook my head, denying it.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think we have something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. You are always whispering and caressing\neach other. Anyone who looks will say that you guys are dating.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe are best friends. We don\u2019t have to have\n\u201csomething\u201d to hug or hold hands. We grew up together, it&rsquo;s only natural that this\nhappens. He is like a brother to me, just as I know I am a sister to him.\u201d Ned\nseemed to not believe a single world, but just shrugged and talked again to the\nrest of the table, while Peter remained silent just drinking his juice box and tinkering\nwith his cell phone. However, he stopped as soon as he saw Flash sit down my\nside.\u00a0</p><p>The boy spoke calmly and had a nice voice. When he smiled, his eyes\nsqueezed softly. As cute as he was, I didn\u2019t want to date him. Simply because I\nhad no attraction for him, so I panicked when he tried to call me out, but I\ndidn\u2019t want to hurt him because he was always treated me well.</p><p>A sly smile adorned Peter&rsquo;s thin lips when Flash asked\nwhat I would do on Saturday, because Parker knew that he would try to call\nme out again, and the damn thing is that he loved to see me suffer. Honestly, I don\u2019t even\nknow why I&rsquo;m his friend.\u00a0</p><p>Flash asked me if I wanted to go to the party that\nwould happen at Liz&rsquo;s house with him. I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I\nlet my eyes fall on my best friend, a mute request for mercy. Again, Peter was\nmy hero.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you said you were going to my aunt&rsquo;s birthday\ntomorrow. Forgot?&ldquo;\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course I will! May wouldn\u2019t forgive me if I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nFlash shrugged his shoulders in dismay, but then he smiled again and said he\nwould take the &quot;next time&rdquo; and sat down at another table.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just say you don\u2019t want to go out with\nhim?\u201d Peter asked quietly, unrolling the headphones and handing me one. He set\nthe music down and laid his head on the table, and I did the same.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I don\u2019t want to hurt him.&rdquo; I\nconfessed. We were so close that I felt his breathing against my face, and this\ntime, I was playing with his hair, making him close his eyes. We were silent\njust enjoying the music, and it was comfortable that way. To say that I didn\u2019t\nthink Peter was handsome would be a lie, he was the most\nbeautiful person in the universe, but I didn\u2019t like him that way, just as I\nknew he didn\u2019t feel anything for me.</p><p>I had never dated anyone or fallen in love; my first\nkiss had been with a boy in the first year, but he didn\u2019t know how to kiss it\nright and I much less, so it was full of saliva. A disgusting thing that gave\nme mononucleosis, and to this day some people were teasing me about getting\ncaught with it.</p><p>Sometimes life is a dumpster in the woods.</p><p>And with my head lying down on the table while listening\nto music, I could say again: Peter&rsquo;s eyes are beautiful.\u00a0</p><p>Pretty as if someone\nhad put a whole galaxy in, so bright.<br/></p><hr><p><b>Taglist:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC6OpDEQesVvB38EXqzivbg\">@tokoyamisstuff</a><b>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDJQd2na_MMP1CNIZ14z8MQ\"></a></b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDJQd2na_MMP1CNIZ14z8MQ\">@imrllybored</a></p><p><i><b>send me an ask or message if you want to be on my taglist and which character you want (Bucky, Peter, Avengers, all of them\u2026)</b></i></p><p><i><b>leave a comment on this post if you\u2019d like to be tagged ONLY in this fic series</b></i></p><p><b>A/N: <strike>No, I didn\u2019t get mononucleosis with my first kiss.</strike></b></p>",

It hasn\u2019t been so long since we\u2019d been through puberty, maybe three years. I\u2019m no\nlonger that little girl in the first grade. The ponytails were less usual and my legs still a little crooked, but that\u2019s part of the charm (if Jensen Ackles has\nit, who am I to complain?)</p><p>And Peter? He still wore those sweatshirts larger than\nhim and he was getting smarter. He is a genius. And he was still my hero.\u00a0</p><p>I leaned my head in my desk, listening to the chalk\nscratch the blackboard while the teacher explained how to solve a chemistry\nexercise. I had already given up trying to understand stoichiometric calculus,\nthose thousands numbers and letters made me believe that hell is real.</p><p>Peter kept his cheek resting on his notebook, kneading\nit a little, which left him with a fluffy pout, and his hair a little\nmessy.</p><p>We held our gazes for a long time, until he moved his\nlong, beautiful fingers against my hair, making me close my eyes and enjoy the\ncaress until the teacher said in a good tone \u201cY/L/N and Parker, classroom\nis no place for dating.\u201d making him blush and push his hand away.</p><p>As I dragged my feet through the large corridors, with\nNed talking about a new cafeteria that had opened near the school, my eyes\nscanned the students, watching them hurry up to buy cupcakes from a little\ngirl, that Ned told me later it was some teacher\u2019s daughter.\u00a0</p><p>And\nguess where Peter was? That\u2019s right, he was in the long row just to help her.</p><p>Peter appeared with his chin all covered with\nchocolate as he grumbled softly about how the only strawberry-stuffed dumplings\nwas sold, leaving only passion fruit and they were too sour. I laughed as I\ntook a napkin to wipe his face, taking the cupcake from his hand, which was already in\nhalf and replacing mine (being friends with MJ gives a lot of perks). He\nlooked at the cupcake with a devotion that I thought he would ask it for marriage.\nIt wasn\u2019t more than three minutes before I had to get another napkin to wipe\nhis face again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Ned suddenly asked loudly,\nmaking almost everyone at the table turn to him. I pointed to myself asking if\nhe was talking to me, as soon as he acquiesced, I did the same, giving him the\nliberty to ask such a question. \u201cFrankly, didn\u2019t you two ever give each\nother a kiss, make out or something?\u201d I gasped for air at that moment. I glanced sideways at Peter, who also seemed\nembarrassed by such a question. For some reason, that month, Ned had stuck his\nhead that we had something.</p><p>Seeing all the people at the table looking at me made\nme believe that almost everyone had the same doubt as him, I let out a low\nlaugh and shook my head, denying it.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think we have something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. You are always whispering and caressing\neach other. Anyone who looks will say that you guys are dating.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe are best friends. We don\u2019t have to have\n\u201csomething\u201d to hug or hold hands. We grew up together, it\u2019s only natural that this\nhappens. He is like a brother to me, just as I know I am a sister to him.\u201d Ned\nseemed to not believe a single world, but just shrugged and talked again to the\nrest of the table, while Peter remained silent just drinking his juice box and tinkering\nwith his cell phone. However, he stopped as soon as he saw Flash sit down my\nside.\u00a0</p><p>The boy spoke calmly and had a nice voice. When he smiled, his eyes\nsqueezed softly. As cute as he was, I didn\u2019t want to date him. Simply because I\nhad no attraction for him, so I panicked when he tried to call me out, but I\ndidn\u2019t want to hurt him because he was always treated me well.</p><p>A sly smile adorned Peter\u2019s thin lips when Flash asked\nwhat I would do on Saturday, because Parker knew that he would try to call\nme out again, and the damn thing is that he loved to see me suffer. Honestly, I don\u2019t even\nknow why I\u2019m his friend.\u00a0</p><p>Flash asked me if I wanted to go to the party that\nwould happen at Liz\u2019s house with him.
