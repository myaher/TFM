FRIDAY, pull up the location of Peter\u2019s suit.\u201d Tony answered Happy, then addressed the AI in the compound. </p><p>\u201cSure thing boss.\u201d the AI responded. A holographic screen came up, showing the pair a map pinpointing where the Spider-Man suit was.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we should go get him? He\u2019s probably busy fighting crime,\u201d Happy raised an eyebrow, not looking up from his phone.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I need help on this mission, and I haven\u2019t seen Peter in forever. Secondly, if he was just busy fighting crime, he would have at least had KAREN send us a \u201cSorry can\u2019t talk right now.\u201d message. Third, doesn\u2019t he live in Queens? Why would he be so far on a school night? His tracker says he\u2019s in Staten Island,\u201d Tony enlarged the map so Happy could see it better.</p><p>\u201cYou saw the kid last week,\u201d Happy pointed out, \u201cAnyway, Staten Island isn\u2019t too far from Queens, Tony. Don\u2019t jump to conclusions. Why don\u2019t you get Rhodey to come on the mission with you?\u201d Happy glanced up at Tony and the screen, switching his phone for the tablet on the table in front of him.</p><p>\u201cA) Rhodey\u2019s already coming, B) this was supposed to be Peter\u2019s first mission as part of a team, and C) The last time Peter was in Staten Island with the suit, he got the ferry split in two.\u201d Tony listed, counting the reasons with his fingers.</p><p>Happy rolled his eyes, looking back to his tablet. \u201cAt least try calling his suit directly through KAREN, before going find him.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded to Happy before walking to his lab, opening the door, and sitting down at his desk.</p><p>\u201cFriday, can you call KAREN?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to call KAREN?\u201d FRIDAY asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, call KAREN. And don\u2019t let Peter decline the call,\u201d he added, pulling up the screen with the map showing the suit\u2019s location, which hadn\u2019t moved from Staten Island.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark is that you?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was raspy and Tony could hear the cough through the microphone in the suit. </p><p>\u201cYeah Peter it\u2019s me. What are you doing? Happy and I\u2019ve been texting and calling you, but you never responded. I\u2019m a bit worried,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m uh, cold. Very cold. Like I can barely move cold. Uh I found-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have the heater on?\u201d Tony interrupted to ask.</p><p>\u201cI think the heater is broken. KAREN says she can\u2019t turn it on,\u201d Peter coughed again.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Do I need to come pick you up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cActually that sounds good.\u201d Peter said, \u201cWhy were you and Happy calling?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was gonna take you on a mission with Rhodey, but you don\u2019t really sound up for it,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark I am too up for it! I can-\u201d Peter broke off in a fit of coughing and Tony\u2019s eyebrows creased together in concern.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Pete? Just stay where you are I\u2019m on my way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up on me please,\u201d </p><p>\u201cCourse not bud. FRIDAY, reroute call to my phone.\u201d Tony picked up his phone as FRIDAY switched the call from the home speaker to his phone.</p><p>\u201cSo what were you doing that made you so cold?\u201d Tony asked, already walking to the garage.</p><p>\u201cUh well these two guys were trying to rob this girl, but obviously I stopped them. And the girl was thankful, and she let me walk her home, and so when we got to her apartment place she walked inside and was like thank you so much! So anyway I started walking home because it\u2019s getting late and I\u2019m tired. But as I was swinging home, someone or something cut the web that I was swinging on, and so I took an unplanned swim in the river, and apparently my heater\u2019s broken, and I\u2019m really cold and soaking wet,\u201d Peter rambled, only cutting himself off a few times to cough loudly before continuing his story.</p><p>\u201cOk. How do you know the web was cut and it didn\u2019t break?\u201d When Peter finished his story, Tony was already in the car driving towards Peter.</p><p>\u201cWell when I saw the broken end, it was way too even to have been a break. Like the web would\u2019ve stretched if it broke, but this was a really clean cut, nothing stretched or anything. Also, for the web to break there would\u2019ve had to have been a lot of pressure of the web, like way heavier than just me,\u201d Peter thought back to how the only times he remembered his webs ever breaking was when he tried to catch the elevator and when he was trying to stop the ferry from sinking. </p><p>\u201cYeah, you did a great job making those things.\u201d Tony complemented.</p><p>\u201cThanks! Hey Mr. Stark where are you anyway?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very close to where you are now, just hang tight.\u201d Tony rounded a corner in the car.</p><p>-</p><p>Tony pulled his car over near the bench Peter was sitting on and rolled down the window.</p><p>\u201cCome on Spider-Man, get in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Stark, thanks for coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem kid.\u201d Tony reached over and turned up the heater as Peter climbed into the car. </p><p>\u201cI found a really cute lost golden retriever puppy and helped him get back to his owner.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCool, hey why didn\u2019t you call or text Happy and I back?\u201d Tony asked, turning the car around to get back to the compound.</p><p>\u201cUh&hellip;\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you know where it is or can I buy you a new one?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark you don\u2019t need to buy me a new phone. Probably.\u201d Peter shivered in the car despite the heater being on full blast, and coughed again.</p><p>\u201cSo why weren\u2019t you answering-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, look out!\u201d Peter yelled, spider senses going crazy as his eyes widened when they saw the large black van coming too fast at their car.</p><p>-</p><p>The lights were blinding when Peter could finally open his eyes to see where he was.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d He rasped out, voice still sore from the cold he probably had.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine. You\u2019re at the Avengers compound.\u201d A voice that Peter didn\u2019t recognize informed him.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo kid, it\u2019s Rhodey. Tony\u2019s in another room. Quite the accident y\u2019all got into.\u201d Rhodey was sitting near Peter\u2019s feet at the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t our fault,\u201d Peter responded sleepily, \u201cMr. Stark okay? May know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Aunt May is on her way. Tony\u2019s in another room.\u201d Rhodey informed him.</p><p>\u201cYou already said that. Is Mr. Stark okay?\u201d Peter sat up and looked Rhodey in the eye, ignoring the pain flaring through his left arm. \u201cIs he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, please don\u2019t hurt yourself anymore than you already are,\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me if Mr. Stark is okay or not!\u201d Peter rarely yelled at people, but he was very worried about his mentor because he still hadn\u2019t seen him yet.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine Peter, nothing to worry about.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs he awake?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, you just got into a pretty bad car accident. It was only three hours ago. Give him time.\u201d Rhodey stood up from his position at the feet of Peter\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything to eat? Drink?\u201d Rhodey asked.</p><p>\u201cWater please.\u201d Peter sighed and laid back into the pillows on his bed, grateful that his throat wasn\u2019t sore and his cough seemed to have gone away. </p><p>-</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d Peter yelled, popping up from the couch he was sitting on to look at his mentor leaning against the doorway to the living room.</p><p>\u201cSo why weren\u2019t you answering your phone?\u201d Tony continued the conversation as if nothing had happened, as if three days hadn\u2019t passed since the car accident.</p><p>\u201cMy phone kinda exploded?\u201d Peter adjusted the sling on his arm, careful not to hurt himself.</p><p>\u201cIt, the, what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell there was a fire, and I helped get the people out and I went back in to make sure everyone was out safely but the building started groaning, and I swung out really quickly but I dropped my phone, and I couldn\u2019t go back because the building pretty much exploded.\u201d Peter explained leaning back into the couch.</p><p>\u201cSo you weren\u2019t getting the messages or call through KAREN until I called her directly?\u201d Tony pushed off the doorway he was leaning on and sat on a chair across from the couch.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He replied popping the P. \u201cI had no idea you guys were calling or texting me, and KAREN didn\u2019t tell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if that has anything to do with the broken heater?\u201d Tony shifted in his seat to look at the TV, displaying Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. </p><p>\u201cMaybe KAREN had a major malfunction? Because she did sound weird when she was talking to me, like her speech wasn\u2019t very smooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into it. Just next time, don\u2019t drop your phone. A million worries you gave me.\u201d Peter laughed as Tony imitated the speech patterns of Yoda.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it wasn\u2019t my idea to drop the phone.\u201d He giggled, looking back at the screen.</p>",

But as I was swinging home, someone or something cut the web that I was swinging on, and so I took an unplanned swim in the river, and apparently my heater\u2019s broken, and I\u2019m really cold and soaking wet,\u201d Peter rambled, only cutting himself off a few times to cough loudly before continuing his story.</p><p>\u201cOk. How do you know the web was cut and it didn\u2019t break?\u201d When Peter finished his story, Tony was already in the car driving towards Peter.</p><p>\u201cWell when I saw the broken end, it was way too even to have been a break. Like the web would\u2019ve stretched if it broke, but this was a really clean cut, nothing stretched or anything. Also, for the web to break there would\u2019ve had to have been a lot of pressure of the web, like way heavier than just me,\u201d Peter thought back to how the only times he remembered his webs ever breaking was when he tried to catch the elevator and when he was trying to stop the ferry from sinking. </p><p>\u201cYeah, you did a great job making those things.\u201d Tony complemented.</p><p>\u201cThanks! Hey Mr. Stark where are you anyway?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very close to where you are now, just hang tight.\u201d Tony rounded a corner in the car.</p><p>-</p><p>Tony pulled his car over near the bench Peter was sitting on and rolled down the window.</p><p>\u201cCome on Spider-Man, get in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Stark, thanks for coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem kid.\u201d Tony reached over and turned up the heater as Peter climbed into the car. </p><p>\u201cI found a really cute lost golden retriever puppy and helped him get back to his owner.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCool, hey why didn\u2019t you call or text Happy and I back?\u201d Tony asked, turning the car around to get back to the compound.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you know where it is or can I buy you a new one?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark you don\u2019t need to buy me a new phone. Probably.\u201d Peter shivered in the car despite the heater being on full blast, and coughed again.</p><p>\u201cSo why weren\u2019t you answering-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, look out!\u201d Peter yelled, spider senses going crazy as his eyes widened when they saw the large black van coming too fast at their car.</p><p>-</p><p>The lights were blinding when Peter could finally open his eyes to see where he was.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d He rasped out, voice still sore from the cold he probably had.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine. You\u2019re at the Avengers compound.\u201d A voice that Peter didn\u2019t recognize informed him.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo kid, it\u2019s Rhodey. Tony\u2019s in another room. Quite the accident y\u2019all got into.\u201d Rhodey was sitting near Peter\u2019s feet at the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t our fault,\u201d Peter responded sleepily, \u201cMr. Stark okay? May know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Aunt May is on her way. Tony\u2019s in another room.\u201d Rhodey informed him.</p><p>\u201cYou already said that. Is Mr. Stark okay?\u201d Peter sat up and looked Rhodey in the eye, ignoring the pain flaring through his left arm. \u201cIs he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, please don\u2019t hurt yourself anymore than you already are,\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me if Mr. Stark is okay or not!\u201d Peter rarely yelled at people, but he was very worried about his mentor because he still hadn\u2019t seen him yet.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine Peter, nothing to worry about.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs he awake?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, you just got into a pretty bad car accident. It was only three hours ago. Give him time.\u201d Rhodey stood up from his position at the feet of Peter\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything to eat? Drink?\u201d Rhodey asked.</p><p>\u201cWater please.\u201d Peter sighed and laid back into the pillows on his bed, grateful that his throat wasn\u2019t sore and his cough seemed to have gone away. </p><p>-</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d Peter yelled, popping up from the couch he was sitting on to look at his mentor leaning against the doorway to the living room.</p><p>\u201cSo why weren\u2019t you answering your phone?\u201d Tony continued the conversation as if nothing had happened, as if three days hadn\u2019t passed since the car accident.</p><p>\u201cMy phone kinda exploded?\u201d Peter adjusted the sling on his arm, careful not to hurt himself.</p><p>\u201cIt, the, what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell there was a fire, and I helped get the people out and I went back in to make sure everyone was out safely but the building started groaning, and I swung out really quickly but I dropped my phone, and I couldn\u2019t go back because the building pretty much exploded.\u201d Peter explained leaning back into the couch.</p><p>\u201cSo you weren\u2019t getting the messages or call through KAREN until I called her directly?\u201d Tony pushed off the doorway he was leaning on and sat on a chair across from the couch.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He replied popping the P. \u201cI had no idea you guys were calling or texting me, and KAREN didn\u2019t tell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if that has anything to do with the broken heater?\u201d Tony shifted in his seat to look at the TV, displaying Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. </p><p>\u201cMaybe KAREN had a major malfunction? Because she did sound weird when she was talking to me, like her speech wasn\u2019t very smooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into it. Just next time, don\u2019t drop your phone. A million worries you gave me.\u201d Peter laughed as Tony imitated the speech patterns of Yoda.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it wasn\u2019t my idea to drop the phone.\u201d He giggled, looking back at the screen.</p></p>",

FRIDAY, pull up the location of Peter\u2019s suit.\u201d Tony answered Happy, then addressed the AI in the compound. </p><p>\u201cSure thing boss.\u201d the AI responded. A holographic screen came up, showing the pair a map pinpointing where the Spider-Man suit was.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we should go get him? He\u2019s probably busy fighting crime,\u201d Happy raised an eyebrow, not looking up from his phone.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I need help on this mission, and I haven\u2019t seen Peter in forever. Secondly, if he was just busy fighting crime, he would have at least had KAREN send us a \u201cSorry can\u2019t talk right now.\u201d message. Third, doesn\u2019t he live in Queens? Why would he be so far on a school night? His tracker says he\u2019s in Staten Island,\u201d Tony enlarged the map so Happy could see it better.</p><p>\u201cYou saw the kid last week,\u201d Happy pointed out, \u201cAnyway, Staten Island isn\u2019t too far from Queens, Tony. Don\u2019t jump to conclusions. Why don\u2019t you get Rhodey to come on the mission with you?\u201d Happy glanced up at Tony and the screen, switching his phone for the tablet on the table in front of him.</p><p>\u201cA) Rhodey\u2019s already coming, B) this was supposed to be Peter\u2019s first mission as part of a team, and C) The last time Peter was in Staten Island with the suit, he got the ferry split in two.\u201d Tony listed, counting the reasons with his fingers.</p><p>Happy rolled his eyes, looking back to his tablet. \u201cAt least try calling his suit directly through KAREN, before going find him.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded to Happy before walking to his lab, opening the door, and sitting down at his desk.</p><p>\u201cFriday, can you call KAREN?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to call KAREN?\u201d FRIDAY asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, call KAREN. And don\u2019t let Peter decline the call,\u201d he added, pulling up the screen with the map showing the suit\u2019s location, which hadn\u2019t moved from Staten Island.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark is that you?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was raspy and Tony could hear the cough through the microphone in the suit. </p><p>\u201cYeah Peter it\u2019s me. What are you doing? Happy and I\u2019ve been texting and calling you, but you never responded. I\u2019m a bit worried,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m uh, cold. Very cold. Like I can barely move cold. Uh I found-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have the heater on?\u201d Tony interrupted to ask.</p><p>\u201cI think the heater is broken. KAREN says she can\u2019t turn it on,\u201d Peter coughed again.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Do I need to come pick you up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cActually that sounds good.\u201d Peter said, \u201cWhy were you and Happy calling?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was gonna take you on a mission with Rhodey, but you don\u2019t really sound up for it,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark I am too up for it! I can-\u201d Peter broke off in a fit of coughing and Tony\u2019s eyebrows creased together in concern.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Pete? Just stay where you are I\u2019m on my way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up on me please,\u201d </p><p>\u201cCourse not bud. FRIDAY, reroute call to my phone.\u201d Tony picked up his phone as FRIDAY switched the call from the home speaker to his phone.</p><p>\u201cSo what were you doing that made you so cold?\u201d Tony asked, already walking to the garage.</p><p>\u201cUh well these two guys were trying to rob this girl, but obviously I stopped them.

FRIDAY, reroute call to my phone.&rdquo; Tony picked up his phone as FRIDAY switched the call from the home speaker to his phone.</p><p>&ldquo;So what were you doing that made you so cold?&rdquo; Tony asked, already walking to the garage.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh well these two guys were trying to rob this girl, but obviously I stopped them. And the girl was thankful, and she let me walk her home, and so when we got to her apartment place she walked inside and was like thank you so much! So anyway I started walking home because it&rsquo;s getting late and I&rsquo;m tired. But as I was swinging home, someone or something cut the web that I was swinging on, and so I took an unplanned swim in the river, and apparently my heater&rsquo;s broken, and I&rsquo;m really cold and soaking wet,&rdquo; Peter rambled, only cutting himself off a few times to cough loudly before continuing his story.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok. How do you know the web was cut and it didn&rsquo;t break?&rdquo; When Peter finished his story, Tony was already in the car driving towards Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Well when I saw the broken end, it was way too even to have been a break. Like the web would&rsquo;ve stretched if it broke, but this was a really clean cut, nothing stretched or anything. Also, for the web to break there would&rsquo;ve had to have been a lot of pressure of the web, like way heavier than just me,&rdquo; Peter thought back to how the only times he remembered his webs ever breaking was when he tried to catch the elevator and when he was trying to stop the ferry from sinking. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you did a great job making those things.&rdquo; Tony complemented.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks! Hey Mr. Stark where are you anyway?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very close to where you are now, just hang tight.&rdquo; Tony rounded a corner in the car.</p><p>-</p><p>Tony pulled his car over near the bench Peter was sitting on and rolled down the window.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on Spider-Man, get in the car.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Mr. Stark, thanks for coming!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No problem kid.&rdquo; Tony reached over and turned up the heater as Peter climbed into the car. </p><p>&ldquo;I found a really cute lost golden retriever puppy and helped him get back to his owner.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Cool, hey why didn&rsquo;t you call or text Happy and I back?&rdquo; Tony asked, turning the car around to get back to the compound.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do you know where it is or can I buy you a new one?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark you don&rsquo;t need to buy me a new phone. Probably.&rdquo; Peter shivered in the car despite the heater being on full blast, and coughed again.</p><p>&ldquo;So why weren&rsquo;t you answering-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, look out!&rdquo; Peter yelled, spider senses going crazy as his eyes widened when they saw the large black van coming too fast at their car.</p><p>-</p><p>The lights were blinding when Peter could finally open his eyes to see where he was.</p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; He rasped out, voice still sore from the cold he probably had.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fine. You&rsquo;re at the Avengers compound.&rdquo; A voice that Peter didn&rsquo;t recognize informed him.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No kid, it&rsquo;s Rhodey. Tony&rsquo;s in another room. Quite the accident y&rsquo;all got into.&rdquo; Rhodey was sitting near Peter&rsquo;s feet at the end of the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t our fault,&rdquo; Peter responded sleepily, &ldquo;Mr. Stark okay? May know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your Aunt May is on her way. Tony&rsquo;s in another room.&rdquo; Rhodey informed him.</p><p>&ldquo;You already said that. Is Mr. Stark okay?&rdquo; Peter sat up and looked Rhodey in the eye, ignoring the pain flaring through his left arm. &ldquo;Is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, please don&rsquo;t hurt yourself anymore than you already are,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me if Mr. Stark is okay or not!&rdquo; Peter rarely yelled at people, but he was very worried about his mentor because he still hadn&rsquo;t seen him yet.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fine Peter, nothing to worry about.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is he awake?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, you just got into a pretty bad car accident. It was only three hours ago. Give him time.&rdquo; Rhodey stood up from his position at the feet of Peter&rsquo;s bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you need anything to eat? Drink?&rdquo; Rhodey asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Water please.&rdquo; Peter sighed and laid back into the pillows on his bed, grateful that his throat wasn&rsquo;t sore and his cough seemed to have gone away. </p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark!&rdquo; Peter yelled, popping up from the couch he was sitting on to look at his mentor leaning against the doorway to the living room.</p><p>&ldquo;So why weren&rsquo;t you answering your phone?&rdquo; Tony continued the conversation as if nothing had happened, as if three days hadn&rsquo;t passed since the car accident.</p><p>&ldquo;My phone kinda exploded?&rdquo; Peter adjusted the sling on his arm, careful not to hurt himself.</p><p>&ldquo;It, the, what?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well there was a fire, and I helped get the people out and I went back in to make sure everyone was out safely but the building started groaning, and I swung out really quickly but I dropped my phone, and I couldn&rsquo;t go back because the building pretty much exploded.&rdquo; Peter explained leaning back into the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;So you weren&rsquo;t getting the messages or call through KAREN until I called her directly?&rdquo; Tony pushed off the doorway he was leaning on and sat on a chair across from the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; He replied popping the P. &ldquo;I had no idea you guys were calling or texting me, and KAREN didn&rsquo;t tell me about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wonder if that has anything to do with the broken heater?&rdquo; Tony shifted in his seat to look at the TV, displaying Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe KAREN had a major malfunction? Because she did sound weird when she was talking to me, like her speech wasn&rsquo;t very smooth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look into it. Just next time, don&rsquo;t drop your phone. A million worries you gave me.&rdquo; Peter laughed as Tony imitated the speech patterns of Yoda.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, it wasn&rsquo;t my idea to drop the phone.&rdquo; He giggled, looking back at the screen.</p></p>",
