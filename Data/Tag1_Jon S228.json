You mentioned how important the cloaking ceremony is and all I could think of was s6, Jon taking off his Crow cloak to showcase resigning from the Watch and handing it to Edd and 2 episodes later Sansa gives him a Stark one and Edd steps up to say farewell as Jon puts it on. This is show material and beyond the books but maybe it's worth revisiting the previous books then for Jon + cloaks? :)",

Many characters (nobles) wear cloaks with their house colors or sigil or wear a brooch or pin with their house symbol fasten to their cloaks. In addition, the colors of cloaks identify the organization of the wearer \u2013 from the Kingsguards\u2019 white cloaks to the City Guard, adeptly named the Gold Cloaks, to the Night\u2019s Watch&rsquo;s black cloaks (clothing).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The Cloaking Ceremony is a clear symbolic usage of cloaks, involving two types of cloaks - The Maiden\u2019s Cloak and the Bridal Cloak. <br/></p><p>A woman goes into the ceremony wearing a cloak of her own house (maiden\u2019s cloak), but leaves wearing her husbands\u2019 (bridal cloak).\u00a0</p><p>The idea being the woman sheds the cloak representing her family\u2019s house and her loyalties to them. Then the husband places a cloak representing his house onto the wife, symbolizing she is under his and his family\u2019s protection.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa even describes the bridal cloak as <i><b>\u201cthe cloak of his protection,\u201d</b> </i>when she thinks about how her wedding should\u2019ve when she is married to Tyrion (Sansa III, ASOS).</p><p>In the show, the ceremony is a bit different than in the books \u2013 the biggest difference being that there is only the bridal cloak, no maiden\u2019s cloak. <br/></p><p>Within the text (book and show) we have seen the cloaking ceremony several times. The snag is that with a decent amount of the weddings we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s just a ceremony for ceremony sake. The actual meaning is left out as the two main parties, not just the husband and wife, are not being genuine with their intentions.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s a hollow spectacle.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"852\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/989269f33751da0929bc4fb2ddea5818/tumblr_inline_pi1ik9Z3Ze1qg9ixw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"852\"/></figure><p><br/>Sansa and Tyrion\u2019s wedding is a good example of the hollow spectacle, minus the more than common gory ending of\nthese \u2018false weddings\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>As neither Sansa nor Tyrion wanted the wedding, but were forced into it \u2013 Sansa more than Tyrion.\u00a0</p><p>So, while it is still a legal wedding and everyone says and does their part \u2013 the wedding and the cloaking ceremony are empty acts, nothing more than show.</p><p>Now to be fair \u2013 Tyrion does honestly swear to protect Sansa. But, the main point is that Sansa as a hostage to the Lannisters is in no place to truly refuse or consent, her agreement to this whole thing is an empty gesture.\u00a0</p><p>You can do all the motions and say all the words, but there has to be something behind those actions and words for it to actually mean something.\u00a0<br/></p><p>While the bride\u2019s side (and consent) can be minimized in its importance to the wedding as she\u2019s being given away, it\u2019s the weddings where the bride (and or her family) weren\u2019t being honest with their intentions that leads to these deadly wedding (marriage) ends. The Westerlings. The Freys.

Tyrion asks for someone to give Sansa something to cover herself with and Sandor Clegane rips off his White Kingsguard cloak for her, which she uses to cover herself.</p><p>A clear form of Sandor Clegane cloaking Sansa.</p><p>But not just any cloak, a type of cloak that represents a celibate order of men and has been describe as being<b> snow-white</b> several times.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the <b>snow-white cloaks of the Kingsguard</b>, seemed almost a stranger to Ned \u2026\u201d </i>(GOT, Eddard I)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe seven knights of the Kingsguard took the field, all but Jaime Lannister in scaled armor the color of milk, <b>their cloaks as white as fresh-fallen snow.\u201d</b></i> (GOT, Sansa II)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cArya recognized the Hound, wearing a <b>snowy white cloak</b> over his dark grey armor, with four of the Kingsguard around him.\u201d</i> (GOT, Arya V)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cSer Meryn entered from the west side of the yard\u2026<b>His cloak streamed behind him like a field of snow.\u201d</b></i><b> </b>(ACOK, Sansa I).<br/></p></blockquote><p>And of course, when Jaime is a prisoner, he brings up the connection of these White Cloaks to Jon Snow, to antagonize Catelyn.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHis smile cut. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never lain with any woman but Cersei.

He\u2019s not just a bastard (who has no rights), he\u2019s Ned Stark\u2019s son and therefore deserves to be heard.\u00a0</p><p>Again, this is all symbolic within the world.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa as a woman and Ramsey\u2019s wife and Jon being a \u201cturncloak\u201d to the Night\u2019s Watch, neither have any right nor any army to give them any rights or power over Ramsey.\u00a0</p><p>But yet the other houses do see them and speak to them and even give them respect, not as their liege Lord and Lady, but still more respect than their current statuses allowed them.\u00a0</p><p>Symbols and political gestures matter so much in this world and can give someone actual power \u2013 but only if people believe in them and accept the weight given to these gestures.</p><p>Any of the Northern Houses could\u2019ve easily imprisoned Jon and Sansa and given them to Ramsey Bolton (like the Umbers did to Rickon), but the proper political gestures and the symbols Jon and Sansa wear prevents these families from doing so.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s not because those families were far nobler and kinder then the Umbers, but because Sansa and Jon\u00a0are playing the political (strategic) game.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa gives Jon a political boost by giving him the cloak. <br/></p><p>And Sansa was only able to do this because Jon had previously given her a \u201cboost\u201d by providing safety, comfort and protection and just familial love.\u00a0</p><p>Littlefinger wasn\u2019t wrong when he said titles have the habit of breeding more titles and that\u2019s also true with political gestures.\u00a0</p><p>So, in regards to Jon and Sansa there have been Three Cloaking Ceremonies involving the two within the subtext of the show and perhaps in the future books.</p><p>Before I finish up, we need to briefly talk about Sansa and Jon\u2019s \u2018separate\u2019 involvement with cloaks, \u2018independent\u2019 of one another.\u00a0</p><hr><p><b>Sansa + Cloaks <i>(books)</i></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"721\" data-orig-height=\"649\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d96c5e4c18492bcb1e29095a9cfc562/tumblr_inline_pi1lwtqfBM1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"721\" data-orig-height=\"649\"/></figure><p><br/>I\u2019ve covered a lot of Sansa\u2019s relationship to cloaks already (her multiple cloakings and marriages) but there\u2019s still more.\u00a0</p><p>As Sansa in her chapters, uses cloaks to help her stay hidden, most notably when she is working with Dontos to escape King\u2019s Landing.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cSansa threw <b>a plain grey cloak </b>over her shoulders and picked up the knife she used to cut her meat. If it is some trap, better that I die than let them hurt me more, she told herself. <b>She hid the blade under her cloak.</b></i><b>\u201d</b> (ACOK, Sansa II)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i> \u201cDress warmly, Ser Dontos had told her, and dress dark. She had no blacks, so she chose a dress of thick brown wool. <b>The bodice was decorated with freshwater pearls, though. The cloak will cover them.\u201d </b>(ASOS, Sansa V).</i></p></blockquote><p>The last quote is interesting, because while\u00a0Sansa is literally talking about her cloak covering the pearls of her dress, there is another layer to this. Pearls are associated with the Starks.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa\u2019s maiden\u2019s cloak \u2013 <i>\u201ca long cloak of white velvet <b>heavy with pearls.</b> A fierce direwolf was embroidered upon it in silver thread.\u201d</i> (ASOS, Sansa III)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cLord Mace Tyrell came forward to present his gift: a golden chalice three feet tall, with two ornate curved handles and seven faces glittering with gemstones. &ldquo;Seven faces for Your Grace&rsquo;s seven kingdoms,&rdquo; the bride&rsquo;s father explained.

Jon Arryn&rsquo;s bannermen will never love me, nor our silly, shaking Robert, but they will love their Young Falcon &hellip; and when they come together for his wedding, and you come out with your long auburn hair, <b>clad in a maiden&rsquo;s cloak of white and grey with a direwolf emblazoned on the back &hellip; why, every knight in the Vale will pledge his sword to win you back your birthright.\u201d</b> </i>(AFFC, Alayne II). <br/></p></blockquote><p>In general, cloaks play a pretty significant part in Sansa\u2019s chapters.<br/></p><hr><p><b>Jon + Cloaks <i>(books)</i></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"708\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3da852bd581bb6a3d7d28daeadd96810/tumblr_inline_pi1puyX7F01qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"708\"/></figure><p><br/>The most significant cloaks in Jon\u2019s\nchapters are of course the black cloaks he and his brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch\nwear. Similar to how the Kingsguard and Gold Cloaks are named and identified\nby their main garment - Jon and is brothers are called crows by the wildings, because of their black cloaks.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJon&rsquo;s fingers were in the bucket,\nblood up to the wrist. &ldquo;<b>Dywen says the wildlings call us crows,</b>&rdquo; he\nsaid uncertainly.\u201d (GOT, Jon VIII)</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThe big spearwife narrowed her eyes\nand said,<b> &ldquo;If the crow would join the free folk, </b>let him show us his\nprowess and prove the truth of him.&rdquo; (ACOK, Jon VIII)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe girl laughed scornfully. &ldquo;For\none o&rsquo; us. <b>D'ya think you&rsquo;re the first crow ever flew down off the Wall?</b> In\nyour hearts you all want to fly free.&rdquo; </i>(ASOS, Jon I)</p></blockquote><p>Jon is also called a turncloak, for his time with the wildlings and his relationship with Ygritte.\u00a0<br/></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cImmaculate in his fur-trimmed cloak and polished boots, Ser Alliser Thorne turned to say, <b>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the turncloak now, my lord.</b> Ned Stark&rsquo;s bastard, of Winterfell.&rdquo; </i>(ASOS, Jon IX)\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Your father died by the sword, but he was highborn, a King&rsquo;s Hand. For you, a noose will serve. Ser Alliser, <b>take this turncloak to an ice cell.</b>&rdquo; </i>(ASOS, Jon IX)</p></blockquote><p>Aside from that, cloaks are really used in Jon\u2019s chapters as part of the first usage of cloaks within the text \u2013 the practical and literal.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>He took his cloak from its hook </b>near the door and shouldered his way out.\u201d </i>(GOT, Jon V)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThey ate cold salt beef, hard bread, and harder cheese, and slept clothed and <b>huddled beneath a pile of cloaks and furs</b>, grateful for each other&rsquo;s warmth.\u201d (ACOK, Jon VI)</i></p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s really the main way cloaks are involved in Jon\u2019s chapters, with there being one major exception though, involving a wedding.\u00a0</p><p>The wedding between Alys Karstark and Sigorn of Thenn.\u00a0</p><p>Not only does Jon arrange this marriage and give Alys away (which shows him acting as a Lord and King, not a Lord Commander), but he even has a new sigil created, a combination of the Karstark sigil and a symbol of the Thenns.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe Thenns had no family arms as was customary amongst the nobles of the Seven Kingdoms, so Jon told the stewards to improvise\u2026<b>The bride&rsquo;s cloak Sigorn fastened about Lady Alys&rsquo;s shoulders showed a bronze disk on a field of white wool, surrounded by flames made with wisps of crimson silk. </b>The echo of the Karstark sunburst was there for those who cared to look, but differenced to make the arms appropriate for House Thenn.\u201d (ADWD, Jon X)</i></p></blockquote><p>While arguably it may be more important to just get these two married, in order to help Alys and bring the wildings further into The North to help deal with the upcoming invasion, the symbolic practices need to be fulfilled to give this marriage actual weight in this world.\u00a0</p><p>And Jon knows this.<br/></p><p>Even though others might think a maiden\u2019s cloak is not important (it is), Jon even has a maiden\u2019s cloak made for Alys \u2013\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHer maiden&rsquo;s cloak was the black wool of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. The Karstark sunburst sewn on its back was made of the same white fur that lined it.\u201d </i>(ADWD, Jon X).\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Jon knows that just having Alys and Sigorn go to Karhold and say they\u2019re married, even with 200 Thenn men, isn\u2019t enough. The two not only had to have gotten married, but believe they are married themselves.\u00a0</p><p>And for the marriage to be real, the cultural customs need to be fulfilled. That\u2019s why even the hollow weddings go through all the customs.\u00a0</p><p>And the idea of Jon having a new sigil created for this new house, feeds into my original idea that while Jon might take the Stark name by marrying Sansa, there is more than a good chance that a new sigil will be created for the Starks.<br/></p><p>Finally, this wedding\nmatches pretty closely to Sansa\u2019s thoughts of what her wedding should\u2019ve been\nlike. </p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cShe had dreamed of her wedding a thousand\ntimes, and always she had pictured how her betrothed would stand behind her\ntall and strong, <b>sweep the cloak of his\nprotection over her shoulders, and tenderly kiss her cheek as he leaned forward\nto fasten the clasp.</b>\u201d</i> (ASOS, Sansa III)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThe\nMagnar all but ripped the maiden&rsquo;s cloak from Alys&rsquo;s shoulders, <b>but when he fastened her bride&rsquo;s cloak\nabout her he was almost tender. As he leaned down to kiss her cheek, their\nbreath mingled.\u201d</b> (ADWD, Jon X)</p></blockquote><p>The wedding that was only possible because of Jon Snow, has an intimate description of\nthe groom and bride that is a close match to Sansa\u2019s dream wedding.\u00a0</p><p>And\nsimilar to how this wedding may not have been Alys\u2019s ideal wedding, Sansa\u2019s\nwedding to Jon might not be everything she wanted when she was a child, but it\nwill hopefully be the right mix of her dreams meeting reality.\u00a0<br/></p><hr><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"333\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cf5617bf58d56a2c315cfa3c24c61162/tumblr_inline_pi2bn05lnx1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"333\"/></figure><p><br/>In conclusion, cloaks matter a lot in the world of Westeros, as simple clothing items to proud and important symbols that the characters wear. Like other clothing, they can emphasize what the characters are trying to say and show about themselves as well as reveal what they are truly about.\u00a0</p><p>Both Jon and Sansa have importance given to cloaks in their individual chapters in the books as well as in the show, when they are reunited and join forces.</p><p>The cloaking ceremony is integral to the weddings of Westeros and what weddings should represent in this world. And with all the less than ideal weddings happening in the story, it\u2019s interesting that while Jon and Sansa haven\u2019t been married, they\u2019ve created their own cloaking ceremonies with their genuine intent to build a new relationship together.\u00a0</p><p>Their symbolic cloakings have more weight to them than the real weddings that have played out in the story.\u00a0</p><p>And of course, with the fact that both Jon and Sansa have cloaked the other in a way, leads to a more balance foundation built on equal trust and protection.\u00a0</p><p>The three cloakings that can be applied to Jonsa are important in their own right, but truthfully, are building to what I believe will be a real and truly proper cloaking ceremony in their future wedding.\u00a0</p><p>A wedding where Sansa will get to be the happy bride, safe and loved, and Jon will have what he always thought he couldn\u2019t, a wife and a family and the Stark name.\u00a0</p>",

Tyrion asks for someone to give Sansa something to cover herself with and Sandor Clegane rips off his White Kingsguard cloak for her, which she uses to cover herself.</p><p>A clear form of Sandor Clegane cloaking Sansa.</p><p>But not just any cloak, a type of cloak that represents a celibate order of men and has been describe as being<b> snow-white</b> several times.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the <b>snow-white cloaks of the Kingsguard</b>, seemed almost a stranger to Ned \u2026\u201d </i>(GOT, Eddard I)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe seven knights of the Kingsguard took the field, all but Jaime Lannister in scaled armor the color of milk, <b>their cloaks as white as fresh-fallen snow.\u201d</b></i> (GOT, Sansa II)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cArya recognized the Hound, wearing a <b>snowy white cloak</b> over his dark grey armor, with four of the Kingsguard around him.\u201d</i> (GOT, Arya V)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cSer Meryn entered from the west side of the yard\u2026<b>His cloak streamed behind him like a field of snow.\u201d</b></i><b> </b>(ACOK, Sansa I).<br></p></blockquote><p>And of course, when Jaime is a prisoner, he brings up the connection of these White Cloaks to Jon Snow, to antagonize Catelyn.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHis smile cut. \u201cI\u2019ve never lain with any woman but Cersei.

Which is what we have here in the final cloaking for Jonsa\u2026so far.\u00a0</p><p>Jon is the ceremonial wife.\u00a0</p><p>He enters this \u201cceremony\u201d with his Night\u2019s Watch\u2019s cloak and then that cloak is removed as Jon resigns from his post from the Night\u2019s Watch \u2013 he hands his black cloak with the wooly collar (maiden\u2019s cloak) to Edd in S6E03 \u201cOathbreaker,\u201d after fulfilling his last duty as Lord Commander.\u00a0</p><p>In S6E04, \u201cBook of the Stranger\u201d he is reunited with Sansa.</p><p>And in S6E05, \u201cThe Door\u201d he is wearing his old cloak (the one Sansa wore).</p><p>This was his look before he joined the Night\u2019s Watch \u2013 so while he is literally wearing a cloak, he is cloakless. Or more accurately for this analogy he\u2019s in-between his maiden\u2019s cloak and bridal cloak. \u00a0</p><p>His family ties (Night\u2019s Watch) have ended and he is cloaked by Sansa as she gives him the Stark Embroidered Cloak.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1629\" data-orig-height=\"1078\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0fdfb7ddeefec9ddd269d22c04f15d0e/tumblr_inline_pi1l8fEa5W1qg9ixw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1629\" data-orig-height=\"1078\"></figure><p><b><i>Sidenote:</i></b><i> In season 7, Jon has a new cloak \u2013 which Sansa might\u2019ve made, but it\u2019s not the same one she made in season 6. I thought it was, until I rewatched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_wLvDQd9Y\" target=\"_blank\">Costume Co\u2019s video on Jon Snow\u2019s Costuming</a>.\u00a0</i></p><p>Now the Season 6 Cloak is Sansa\u2019s way of including Jon into the Stark family and name \u2013 a step towards there being less barriers between the two in matters of birth or status. It\u2019s them, the Starks, battling to take back their home of Winterfell.</p><p>Sansa gives Jon the use of her name by not only giving him a proper Stark Cloak, but also the permission to embrace his own Starkness, which he\u2019s been previously denied as a bastard. Which is important.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Jon\u2019s Stark Cloak is packed with so much symbolic weight.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"564\" data-orig-height=\"847\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f9aa60d31141ebbd433a92f5975e395/tumblr_inline_pi23nq2elX1qg9ixw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"564\" data-orig-height=\"847\"></figure><p><br>As Sansa and Jon go together to plea with the other Northern families to help them retake back Winterfell. Sansa can\u2019t do this alone because she is a woman and married to Ramsey \u2013 if Jon wasn\u2019t with her, there would\u2019ve been a very good chance someone would\u2019ve returned her to Ramsey. <br></p><p>Jon as Sansa\u2019s \u201conly living\u201d male family member in Westerosi culture gives her protection, not really in the physical sense, Jon and his small entourage can only do so much, but symbolically he has a lot power.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa by using her Stark name and more importantly dressing Jon in the Stark Cloak (invoking Ned Stark) gives Jon symbolic status. He\u2019s not just a bastard (who has no rights), he\u2019s Ned Stark\u2019s son and therefore deserves to be heard.\u00a0</p><p>Again, this is all symbolic within the world.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa as a woman and Ramsey\u2019s wife and Jon being a \u201cturncloak\u201d to the Night\u2019s Watch, neither have any right nor any army to give them any rights or power over Ramsey.\u00a0</p><p>But yet the other houses do see them and speak to them and even give them respect, not as their liege Lord and Lady, but still more respect than their current statuses allowed them.\u00a0</p><p>Symbols and political gestures matter so much in this world and can give someone actual power \u2013 but only if people believe in them and accept the weight given to these gestures.</p><p>Any of the Northern Houses could\u2019ve easily imprisoned Jon and Sansa and given them to Ramsey Bolton (like the Umbers did to Rickon), but the proper political gestures and the symbols Jon and Sansa wear prevents these families from doing so.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s not because those families were far nobler and kinder then the Umbers, but because Sansa and Jon\u00a0are playing the political (strategic) game.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa gives Jon a political boost by giving him the cloak. <br></p><p>And Sansa was only able to do this because Jon had previously given her a \u201cboost\u201d by providing safety, comfort and protection and just familial love.\u00a0</p><p>Littlefinger wasn\u2019t wrong when he said titles have the habit of breeding more titles and that\u2019s also true with political gestures.\u00a0</p><p>So, in regards to Jon and Sansa there have been Three Cloaking Ceremonies involving the two within the subtext of the show and perhaps in the future books.</p><p>Before I finish up, we need to briefly talk about Sansa and Jon\u2019s \u2018separate\u2019 involvement with cloaks, \u2018independent\u2019 of one another.\u00a0</p><hr><p><b>Sansa + Cloaks <i>(books)</i></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"721\" data-orig-height=\"649\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d96c5e4c18492bcb1e29095a9cfc562/tumblr_inline_pi1lwtqfBM1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"721\" data-orig-height=\"649\"></figure><p><br>I\u2019ve covered a lot of Sansa\u2019s relationship to cloaks already (her multiple cloakings and marriages) but there\u2019s still more.\u00a0</p><p>As Sansa in her chapters, uses cloaks to help her stay hidden, most notably when she is working with Dontos to escape King\u2019s Landing.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cSansa threw <b>a plain grey cloak </b>over her shoulders and picked up the knife she used to cut her meat. If it is some trap, better that I die than let them hurt me more, she told herself. <b>She hid the blade under her cloak.</b></i><b>\u201d</b> (ACOK, Sansa II)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i> \u201cDress warmly, Ser Dontos had told her, and dress dark. She had no blacks, so she chose a dress of thick brown wool. <b>The bodice was decorated with freshwater pearls, though. The cloak will cover them.\u201d </b>(ASOS, Sansa V).</i></p></blockquote><p>The last quote is interesting, because while\u00a0Sansa is literally talking about her cloak covering the pearls of her dress, there is another layer to this. Pearls are associated with the Starks.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa\u2019s maiden\u2019s cloak \u2013 <i>\u201ca long cloak of white velvet <b>heavy with pearls.</b> A fierce direwolf was embroidered upon it in silver thread.\u201d</i> (ASOS, Sansa III)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cLord Mace Tyrell came forward to present his gift: a golden chalice three feet tall, with two ornate curved handles and seven faces glittering with gemstones. \u201cSeven faces for Your Grace\u2019s seven kingdoms,\u201d the bride\u2019s father explained. He showed them how <b>each face bore the sigil of one of the great houses: ruby lion, emerald rose, onyx stag, silver trout, blue jade falcon, opal sun, and pearl direwolf.\u201d</b> </i>(ASOS, IV)\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>And while pearls aren\u2019t used exclusively for the Starks and their direwolf sigil (far from it), there is a link established between the two before Sansa escapes.\u00a0</p><p>And just as Sansa covers up the pearls on her dress, she will cover the fact that she is a Stark very soon.\u00a0</p><p>Finally, Littlefinger discusses the importance of Sansa\u2019s maiden\u2019s cloak and what it could represent \u2013</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhen Robert dies, Harry the Heir becomes Lord Harrold, Defender of the Vale and Lord of the Eyrie. Jon Arryn\u2019s bannermen will never love me, nor our silly, shaking Robert, but they will love their Young Falcon \u2026 and when they come together for his wedding, and you come out with your long auburn hair, <b>clad in a maiden\u2019s cloak of white and grey with a direwolf emblazoned on the back \u2026 why, every knight in the Vale will pledge his sword to win you back your birthright.\u201d</b> </i>(AFFC, Alayne II). <br></p></blockquote><p>In general, cloaks play a pretty significant part in Sansa\u2019s chapters.<br></p><hr><p><b>Jon + Cloaks <i>(books)</i></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"708\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3da852bd581bb6a3d7d28daeadd96810/tumblr_inline_pi1puyX7F01qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"708\"></figure><p><br>The most significant cloaks in Jon\u2019s\nchapters are of course the black cloaks he and his brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch\nwear. Similar to how the Kingsguard and Gold Cloaks are named and identified\nby their main garment - Jon and is brothers are called crows by the wildings, because of their black cloaks.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJon\u2019s fingers were in the bucket,\nblood up to the wrist. \u201c<b>Dywen says the wildlings call us crows,</b>\u201d he\nsaid uncertainly.\u201d (GOT, Jon VIII)</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThe big spearwife narrowed her eyes\nand said,<b> \u201cIf the crow would join the free folk, </b>let him show us his\nprowess and prove the truth of him.\u201d (ACOK, Jon VIII)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe girl laughed scornfully. \u201cFor\none o\u2019 us. <b>D'ya think you\u2019re the first crow ever flew down off the Wall?</b> In\nyour hearts you all want to fly free.\u201d </i>(ASOS, Jon I)</p></blockquote><p>Jon is also called a turncloak, for his time with the wildlings and his relationship with Ygritte.\u00a0<br></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cImmaculate in his fur-trimmed cloak and polished boots, Ser Alliser Thorne turned to say, <b>\u201cHere\u2019s the turncloak now, my lord.</b> Ned Stark\u2019s bastard, of Winterfell.\u201d </i>(ASOS, Jon IX)\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYour father died by the sword, but he was highborn, a King\u2019s Hand. For you, a noose will serve. Ser Alliser, <b>take this turncloak to an ice cell.</b>\u201d </i>(ASOS, Jon IX)</p></blockquote><p>Aside from that, cloaks are really used in Jon\u2019s chapters as part of the first usage of cloaks within the text \u2013 the practical and literal.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>He took his cloak from its hook </b>near the door and shouldered his way out.\u201d </i>(GOT, Jon V)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThey ate cold salt beef, hard bread, and harder cheese, and slept clothed and <b>huddled beneath a pile of cloaks and furs</b>, grateful for each other\u2019s warmth.\u201d (ACOK, Jon VI)</i></p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s really the main way cloaks are involved in Jon\u2019s chapters, with there being one major exception though, involving a wedding.\u00a0</p><p>The wedding between Alys Karstark and Sigorn of Thenn.\u00a0</p><p>Not only does Jon arrange this marriage and give Alys away (which shows him acting as a Lord and King, not a Lord Commander), but he even has a new sigil created, a combination of the Karstark sigil and a symbol of the Thenns.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe Thenns had no family arms as was customary amongst the nobles of the Seven Kingdoms, so Jon told the stewards to improvise\u2026<b>The bride\u2019s cloak Sigorn fastened about Lady Alys\u2019s shoulders showed a bronze disk on a field of white wool, surrounded by flames made with wisps of crimson silk. </b>The echo of the Karstark sunburst was there for those who cared to look, but differenced to make the arms appropriate for House Thenn.\u201d (ADWD, Jon X)</i></p></blockquote><p>While arguably it may be more important to just get these two married, in order to help Alys and bring the wildings further into The North to help deal with the upcoming invasion, the symbolic practices need to be fulfilled to give this marriage actual weight in this world.\u00a0</p><p>And Jon knows this.<br></p><p>Even though others might think a maiden\u2019s cloak is not important (it is), Jon even has a maiden\u2019s cloak made for Alys \u2013\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHer maiden\u2019s cloak was the black wool of the Night\u2019s Watch. The Karstark sunburst sewn on its back was made of the same white fur that lined it.\u201d </i>(ADWD, Jon X).\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Jon knows that just having Alys and Sigorn go to Karhold and say they\u2019re married, even with 200 Thenn men, isn\u2019t enough. The two not only had to have gotten married, but believe they are married themselves.\u00a0</p><p>And for the marriage to be real, the cultural customs need to be fulfilled. That\u2019s why even the hollow weddings go through all the customs.\u00a0</p><p>And the idea of Jon having a new sigil created for this new house, feeds into my original idea that while Jon might take the Stark name by marrying Sansa, there is more than a good chance that a new sigil will be created for the Starks.<br></p><p>Finally, this wedding\nmatches pretty closely to Sansa\u2019s thoughts of what her wedding should\u2019ve been\nlike. </p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cShe had dreamed of her wedding a thousand\ntimes, and always she had pictured how her betrothed would stand behind her\ntall and strong, <b>sweep the cloak of his\nprotection over her shoulders, and tenderly kiss her cheek as he leaned forward\nto fasten the clasp.</b>\u201d</i> (ASOS, Sansa III)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThe\nMagnar all but ripped the maiden\u2019s cloak from Alys\u2019s shoulders, <b>but when he fastened her bride\u2019s cloak\nabout her he was almost tender. As he leaned down to kiss her cheek, their\nbreath mingled.\u201d</b> (ADWD, Jon X)</p></blockquote><p>The wedding that was only possible because of Jon Snow, has an intimate description of\nthe groom and bride that is a close match to Sansa\u2019s dream wedding.\u00a0</p><p>And\nsimilar to how this wedding may not have been Alys\u2019s ideal wedding, Sansa\u2019s\nwedding to Jon might not be everything she wanted when she was a child, but it\nwill hopefully be the right mix of her dreams meeting reality.\u00a0<br></p><hr><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"333\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cf5617bf58d56a2c315cfa3c24c61162/tumblr_inline_pi2bn05lnx1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"333\"></figure><p><br>In conclusion, cloaks matter a lot in the world of Westeros, as simple clothing items to proud and important symbols that the characters wear. Like other clothing, they can emphasize what the characters are trying to say and show about themselves as well as reveal what they are truly about.\u00a0</p><p>Both Jon and Sansa have importance given to cloaks in their individual chapters in the books as well as in the show, when they are reunited and join forces.</p><p>The cloaking ceremony is integral to the weddings of Westeros and what weddings should represent in this world. And with all the less than ideal weddings happening in the story, it\u2019s interesting that while Jon and Sansa haven\u2019t been married, they\u2019ve created their own cloaking ceremonies with their genuine intent to build a new relationship together.\u00a0</p><p>Their symbolic cloakings have more weight to them than the real weddings that have played out in the story.\u00a0</p><p>And of course, with the fact that both Jon and Sansa have cloaked the other in a way, leads to a more balance foundation built on equal trust and protection.\u00a0</p><p>The three cloakings that can be applied to Jonsa are important in their own right, but truthfully, are building to what I believe will be a real and truly proper cloaking ceremony in their future wedding.\u00a0</p><p>A wedding where Sansa will get to be the happy bride, safe and loved, and Jon will have what he always thought he couldn\u2019t, a wife and a family and the Stark name.\u00a0</p></p>",

Many characters (nobles) wear cloaks with their house colors or sigil or wear a brooch or pin with their house symbol fasten to their cloaks. In addition, the colors of cloaks identify the organization of the wearer \u2013 from the Kingsguards\u2019 white cloaks to the City Guard, adeptly named the Gold Cloaks, to the Night\u2019s Watch\u2019s black cloaks (clothing).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The Cloaking Ceremony is a clear symbolic usage of cloaks, involving two types of cloaks - The Maiden\u2019s Cloak and the Bridal Cloak. <br></p><p>A woman goes into the ceremony wearing a cloak of her own house (maiden\u2019s cloak), but leaves wearing her husbands\u2019 (bridal cloak).\u00a0</p><p>The idea being the woman sheds the cloak representing her family\u2019s house and her loyalties to them. Then the husband places a cloak representing his house onto the wife, symbolizing she is under his and his family\u2019s protection.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa even describes the bridal cloak as <i><b>\u201cthe cloak of his protection,\u201d</b> </i>when she thinks about how her wedding should\u2019ve when she is married to Tyrion (Sansa III, ASOS).</p><p>In the show, the ceremony is a bit different than in the books \u2013 the biggest difference being that there is only the bridal cloak, no maiden\u2019s cloak. <br></p><p>Within the text (book and show) we have seen the cloaking ceremony several times. The snag is that with a decent amount of the weddings we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s just a ceremony for ceremony sake.

Tyrion asks for someone to give Sansa something to cover herself with and Sandor Clegane rips off his White Kingsguard cloak for her, which she uses to cover herself.</p><p>A clear form of Sandor Clegane cloaking Sansa.</p><p>But not just any cloak, a type of cloak that represents a celibate order of men and has been describe as being<b> snow-white</b> several times.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the <b>snow-white cloaks of the Kingsguard</b>, seemed almost a stranger to Ned \u2026\u201d </i>(GOT, Eddard I)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe seven knights of the Kingsguard took the field, all but Jaime Lannister in scaled armor the color of milk, <b>their cloaks as white as fresh-fallen snow.\u201d</b></i> (GOT, Sansa II)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cArya recognized the Hound, wearing a <b>snowy white cloak</b> over his dark grey armor, with four of the Kingsguard around him.\u201d</i> (GOT, Arya V)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cSer Meryn entered from the west side of the yard\u2026<b>His cloak streamed behind him like a field of snow.\u201d</b></i><b> </b>(ACOK, Sansa I).<br></p></blockquote><p>And of course, when Jaime is a prisoner, he brings up the connection of these White Cloaks to Jon Snow, to antagonize Catelyn.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHis smile cut. \u201cI\u2019ve never lain with any woman but Cersei.

He\u2019s not just a bastard (who has no rights), he\u2019s Ned Stark\u2019s son and therefore deserves to be heard.\u00a0</p><p>Again, this is all symbolic within the world.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa as a woman and Ramsey\u2019s wife and Jon being a \u201cturncloak\u201d to the Night\u2019s Watch, neither have any right nor any army to give them any rights or power over Ramsey.\u00a0</p><p>But yet the other houses do see them and speak to them and even give them respect, not as their liege Lord and Lady, but still more respect than their current statuses allowed them.\u00a0</p><p>Symbols and political gestures matter so much in this world and can give someone actual power \u2013 but only if people believe in them and accept the weight given to these gestures.</p><p>Any of the Northern Houses could\u2019ve easily imprisoned Jon and Sansa and given them to Ramsey Bolton (like the Umbers did to Rickon), but the proper political gestures and the symbols Jon and Sansa wear prevents these families from doing so.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s not because those families were far nobler and kinder then the Umbers, but because Sansa and Jon\u00a0are playing the political (strategic) game.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa gives Jon a political boost by giving him the cloak. <br></p><p>And Sansa was only able to do this because Jon had previously given her a \u201cboost\u201d by providing safety, comfort and protection and just familial love.\u00a0</p><p>Littlefinger wasn\u2019t wrong when he said titles have the habit of breeding more titles and that\u2019s also true with political gestures.\u00a0</p><p>So, in regards to Jon and Sansa there have been Three Cloaking Ceremonies involving the two within the subtext of the show and perhaps in the future books.</p><p>Before I finish up, we need to briefly talk about Sansa and Jon\u2019s \u2018separate\u2019 involvement with cloaks, \u2018independent\u2019 of one another.\u00a0</p><hr><p><b>Sansa + Cloaks <i>(books)</i></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"721\" data-orig-height=\"649\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d96c5e4c18492bcb1e29095a9cfc562/tumblr_inline_pi1lwtqfBM1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"721\" data-orig-height=\"649\"></figure><p><br>I\u2019ve covered a lot of Sansa\u2019s relationship to cloaks already (her multiple cloakings and marriages) but there\u2019s still more.\u00a0</p><p>As Sansa in her chapters, uses cloaks to help her stay hidden, most notably when she is working with Dontos to escape King\u2019s Landing.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cSansa threw <b>a plain grey cloak </b>over her shoulders and picked up the knife she used to cut her meat.

Pearls are associated with the Starks.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa\u2019s maiden\u2019s cloak \u2013 <i>\u201ca long cloak of white velvet <b>heavy with pearls.</b> A fierce direwolf was embroidered upon it in silver thread.\u201d</i> (ASOS, Sansa III)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u201cLord Mace Tyrell came forward to present his gift: a golden chalice three feet tall, with two ornate curved handles and seven faces glittering with gemstones. \u201cSeven faces for Your Grace\u2019s seven kingdoms,\u201d the bride\u2019s father explained.

The Karstark sunburst sewn on its back was made of the same white fur that lined it.\u201d </i>(ADWD, Jon X).\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Jon knows that just having Alys and Sigorn go to Karhold and say they\u2019re married, even with 200 Thenn men, isn\u2019t enough. The two not only had to have gotten married, but believe they are married themselves.\u00a0</p><p>And for the marriage to be real, the cultural customs need to be fulfilled. That\u2019s why even the hollow weddings go through all the customs.\u00a0</p><p>And the idea of Jon having a new sigil created for this new house, feeds into my original idea that while Jon might take the Stark name by marrying Sansa, there is more than a good chance that a new sigil will be created for the Starks.<br></p><p>Finally, this wedding\nmatches pretty closely to Sansa\u2019s thoughts of what her wedding should\u2019ve been\nlike. </p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cShe had dreamed of her wedding a thousand\ntimes, and always she had pictured how her betrothed would stand behind her\ntall and strong, <b>sweep the cloak of his\nprotection over her shoulders, and tenderly kiss her cheek as he leaned forward\nto fasten the clasp.</b>\u201d</i> (ASOS, Sansa III)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThe\nMagnar all but ripped the maiden\u2019s cloak from Alys\u2019s shoulders, <b>but when he fastened her bride\u2019s cloak\nabout her he was almost tender. As he leaned down to kiss her cheek, their\nbreath mingled.\u201d</b> (ADWD, Jon X)</p></blockquote><p>The wedding that was only possible because of Jon Snow, has an intimate description of\nthe groom and bride that is a close match to Sansa\u2019s dream wedding.\u00a0</p><p>And\nsimilar to how this wedding may not have been Alys\u2019s ideal wedding, Sansa\u2019s\nwedding to Jon might not be everything she wanted when she was a child, but it\nwill hopefully be the right mix of her dreams meeting reality.\u00a0<br></p><hr><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"333\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cf5617bf58d56a2c315cfa3c24c61162/tumblr_inline_pi2bn05lnx1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"333\"></figure><p><br>In conclusion, cloaks matter a lot in the world of Westeros, as simple clothing items to proud and important symbols that the characters wear.

Many characters (nobles) wear cloaks with their house colors or sigil or wear a brooch or pin with their house symbol fasten to their cloaks. In addition, the colors of cloaks identify the organization of the wearer &ndash; from the Kingsguards&rsquo; white cloaks to the City Guard, adeptly named the Gold Cloaks, to the Night&rsquo;s Watch&rsquo;s black cloaks (clothing).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Cloaking Ceremony is a clear symbolic usage of cloaks, involving two types of cloaks - The Maiden&rsquo;s Cloak and the Bridal Cloak. <br /></p><p>A woman goes into the ceremony wearing a cloak of her own house (maiden&rsquo;s cloak), but leaves wearing her husbands&rsquo; (bridal cloak).&nbsp;</p><p>The idea being the woman sheds the cloak representing her family&rsquo;s house and her loyalties to them. Then the husband places a cloak representing his house onto the wife, symbolizing she is under his and his family&rsquo;s protection.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa even describes the bridal cloak as <i><b>&ldquo;the cloak of his protection,&rdquo;</b> </i>when she thinks about how her wedding should&rsquo;ve when she is married to Tyrion (Sansa III, ASOS).</p><p>In the show, the ceremony is a bit different than in the books &ndash; the biggest difference being that there is only the bridal cloak, no maiden&rsquo;s cloak. <br /></p><p>Within the text (book and show) we have seen the cloaking ceremony several times. The snag is that with a decent amount of the weddings we&rsquo;ve seen, it&rsquo;s just a ceremony for ceremony sake. The actual meaning is left out as the two main parties, not just the husband and wife, are not being genuine with their intentions.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s a hollow spectacle.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/989269f33751da0929bc4fb2ddea5818/tumblr_inline_pi1ik9Z3Ze1qg9ixw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br />Sansa and Tyrion&rsquo;s wedding is a good example of the hollow spectacle, minus the more than common gory ending of\nthese &lsquo;false weddings&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>As neither Sansa nor Tyrion wanted the wedding, but were forced into it &ndash; Sansa more than Tyrion.&nbsp;</p><p>So, while it is still a legal wedding and everyone says and does their part &ndash; the wedding and the cloaking ceremony are empty acts, nothing more than show.</p><p>Now to be fair &ndash; Tyrion does honestly swear to protect Sansa. But, the main point is that Sansa as a hostage to the Lannisters is in no place to truly refuse or consent, her agreement to this whole thing is an empty gesture.&nbsp;</p><p>You can do all the motions and say all the words, but there has to be something behind those actions and words for it to actually mean something.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>While the bride&rsquo;s side (and consent) can be minimized in its importance to the wedding as she&rsquo;s being given away, it&rsquo;s the weddings where the bride (and or her family) weren&rsquo;t being honest with their intentions that leads to these deadly wedding (marriage) ends. The Westerlings. The Freys. The Tyrells.&nbsp;</p><p>Robert and Cersei&rsquo;s wedding (and marriage) was nothing more than empty ceremony and we saw how well that turned out.&nbsp;</p><p>While the husband is supposed to swear an oath to protect his new wife, the same isn&rsquo;t true for the wife, and all of these deadly weddings, potentially show the dangers of this uneven ceremony. </p><p>In the reverse though, we have Jon and\nSansa who haven&rsquo;t even come close to getting married to one another within the actual text, of either show or book.&nbsp;</p><p>They&rsquo;re\nnot married and haven&rsquo;t done a proper and official cloaking ceremony at all, and yet they\nhave, in a way.</p><hr /><p><b>Three Cloakings&nbsp;</b><br /></p><p>Unlike some of the other marriages we&rsquo;ve\nseen, both Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s intentions are genuine as they form a new partnership\nand relationship with one another.

For good reason, as he is literally cloaking her in his own cloak, but yet, the subtext implies &ldquo;Jon Snow.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In Book and Season 2, Sansa is stripped and beaten by the King&rsquo;s Guard on the orders of Joffrey, punishing her for the recent Lannister losses which is put to a stop by Tyrion (ACOK, Sansa III and S2E04, &ldquo;Garden of Bones&rdquo;). Tyrion asks for someone to give Sansa something to cover herself with and Sandor Clegane rips off his White Kingsguard cloak for her, which she uses to cover herself.</p><p>A clear form of Sandor Clegane cloaking Sansa.</p><p>But not just any cloak, a type of cloak that represents a celibate order of men and has been describe as being<b> snow-white</b> several times.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Yet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the <b>snow-white cloaks of the Kingsguard</b>, seemed almost a stranger to Ned &hellip;&rdquo; </i>(GOT, Eddard I)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;The seven knights of the Kingsguard took the field, all but Jaime Lannister in scaled armor the color of milk, <b>their cloaks as white as fresh-fallen snow.&rdquo;</b></i> (GOT, Sansa II)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Arya recognized the Hound, wearing a <b>snowy white cloak</b> over his dark grey armor, with four of the Kingsguard around him.&rdquo;</i> (GOT, Arya V)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Ser Meryn entered from the west side of the yard&hellip;<b>His cloak streamed behind him like a field of snow.&rdquo;</b></i><b> </b>(ACOK, Sansa I).<br /></p></blockquote><p>And of course, when Jaime is a prisoner, he brings up the connection of these White Cloaks to Jon Snow, to antagonize Catelyn.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;His smile cut. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never lain with any woman but Cersei. In my own way, I have been truer than your Ned ever was. <b>Poor old dead Ned. So who has shit for honor now, I ask you?

With more weight and emphasis put on it &ndash; albeit subtly.</p><p>The idea of Jon noticing Sansa is cold\nand putting his cloak around her to help her get warm and overall feel safe seems\nvery possible. &nbsp;</p><p>The actual scene itself and the\npotential scene in the future books are nothing more than the first use of\ncloaks being utilized on the surface &ndash; a cloak being used for the sake of\nwarmth. </p><p>But that&rsquo;s the fun and importance of\nthese symbolic items within the books &ndash; there&rsquo;s the actual use and then there&rsquo;s the\nsymbolic one (and symbolism has many layers).

He&rsquo;s not just a bastard (who has no rights), he&rsquo;s Ned Stark&rsquo;s son and therefore deserves to be heard.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, this is all symbolic within the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa as a woman and Ramsey&rsquo;s wife and Jon being a &ldquo;turncloak&rdquo; to the Night&rsquo;s Watch, neither have any right nor any army to give them any rights or power over Ramsey.&nbsp;</p><p>But yet the other houses do see them and speak to them and even give them respect, not as their liege Lord and Lady, but still more respect than their current statuses allowed them.&nbsp;</p><p>Symbols and political gestures matter so much in this world and can give someone actual power &ndash; but only if people believe in them and accept the weight given to these gestures.</p><p>Any of the Northern Houses could&rsquo;ve easily imprisoned Jon and Sansa and given them to Ramsey Bolton (like the Umbers did to Rickon), but the proper political gestures and the symbols Jon and Sansa wear prevents these families from doing so.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s not because those families were far nobler and kinder then the Umbers, but because Sansa and Jon&nbsp;are playing the political (strategic) game.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa gives Jon a political boost by giving him the cloak. <br /></p><p>And Sansa was only able to do this because Jon had previously given her a &ldquo;boost&rdquo; by providing safety, comfort and protection and just familial love.&nbsp;</p><p>Littlefinger wasn&rsquo;t wrong when he said titles have the habit of breeding more titles and that&rsquo;s also true with political gestures.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in regards to Jon and Sansa there have been Three Cloaking Ceremonies involving the two within the subtext of the show and perhaps in the future books.</p><p>Before I finish up, we need to briefly talk about Sansa and Jon&rsquo;s &lsquo;separate&rsquo; involvement with cloaks, &lsquo;independent&rsquo; of one another.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><b>Sansa + Cloaks <i>(books)</i></b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d96c5e4c18492bcb1e29095a9cfc562/tumblr_inline_pi1lwtqfBM1qg9ixw_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br />I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of Sansa&rsquo;s relationship to cloaks already (her multiple cloakings and marriages) but there&rsquo;s still more.&nbsp;</p><p>As Sansa in her chapters, uses cloaks to help her stay hidden, most notably when she is working with Dontos to escape King&rsquo;s Landing.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Sansa threw <b>a plain grey cloak </b>over her shoulders and picked up the knife she used to cut her meat.

The cloak will cover them.&rdquo; </b>(ASOS, Sansa V).</i></p></blockquote><p>The last quote is interesting, because while&nbsp;Sansa is literally talking about her cloak covering the pearls of her dress, there is another layer to this. Pearls are associated with the Starks.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa&rsquo;s maiden&rsquo;s cloak &ndash; <i>&ldquo;a long cloak of white velvet <b>heavy with pearls.</b> A fierce direwolf was embroidered upon it in silver thread.&rdquo;</i> (ASOS, Sansa III)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Lord Mace Tyrell came forward to present his gift: a golden chalice three feet tall, with two ornate curved handles and seven faces glittering with gemstones. &ldquo;Seven faces for Your Grace&rsquo;s seven kingdoms,&rdquo; the bride&rsquo;s father explained. He showed them how <b>each face bore the sigil of one of the great houses: ruby lion, emerald rose, onyx stag, silver trout, blue jade falcon, opal sun, and pearl direwolf.&rdquo;</b> </i>(ASOS, IV)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>And while pearls aren&rsquo;t used exclusively for the Starks and their direwolf sigil (far from it), there is a link established between the two before Sansa escapes.&nbsp;</p><p>And just as Sansa covers up the pearls on her dress, she will cover the fact that she is a Stark very soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Littlefinger discusses the importance of Sansa&rsquo;s maiden&rsquo;s cloak and what it could represent &ndash;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;When Robert dies, Harry the Heir becomes Lord Harrold, Defender of the Vale and Lord of the Eyrie. Jon Arryn&rsquo;s bannermen will never love me, nor our silly, shaking Robert, but they will love their Young Falcon &hellip; and when they come together for his wedding, and you come out with your long auburn hair, <b>clad in a maiden&rsquo;s cloak of white and grey with a direwolf emblazoned on the back &hellip; why, every knight in the Vale will pledge his sword to win you back your birthright.&rdquo;</b> </i>(AFFC, Alayne II). <br /></p></blockquote><p>In general, cloaks play a pretty significant part in Sansa&rsquo;s chapters.<br /></p><hr /><p><b>Jon + Cloaks <i>(books)</i></b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3da852bd581bb6a3d7d28daeadd96810/tumblr_inline_pi1puyX7F01qg9ixw_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br />The most significant cloaks in Jon&rsquo;s\nchapters are of course the black cloaks he and his brothers of the Night&rsquo;s Watch\nwear. Similar to how the Kingsguard and Gold Cloaks are named and identified\nby their main garment - Jon and is brothers are called crows by the wildings, because of their black cloaks.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Jon&rsquo;s fingers were in the bucket,\nblood up to the wrist. &ldquo;<b>Dywen says the wildlings call us crows,</b>&rdquo; he\nsaid uncertainly.&rdquo; (GOT, Jon VIII)</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The big spearwife narrowed her eyes\nand said,<b> &ldquo;If the crow would join the free folk, </b>let him show us his\nprowess and prove the truth of him.&rdquo; (ACOK, Jon VIII)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;The girl laughed scornfully. &ldquo;For\none o&rsquo; us. <b>D'ya think you&rsquo;re the first crow ever flew down off the Wall?</b> In\nyour hearts you all want to fly free.&rdquo; </i>(ASOS, Jon I)</p></blockquote><p>Jon is also called a turncloak, for his time with the wildlings and his relationship with Ygritte.&nbsp;<br /></p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Immaculate in his fur-trimmed cloak and polished boots, Ser Alliser Thorne turned to say, <b>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the turncloak now, my lord.</b> Ned Stark&rsquo;s bastard, of Winterfell.&rdquo; </i>(ASOS, Jon IX)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Your father died by the sword, but he was highborn, a King&rsquo;s Hand. For you, a noose will serve. Ser Alliser, <b>take this turncloak to an ice cell.</b>&rdquo; </i>(ASOS, Jon IX)</p></blockquote><p>Aside from that, cloaks are really used in Jon&rsquo;s chapters as part of the first usage of cloaks within the text &ndash; the practical and literal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;<b>He took his cloak from its hook </b>near the door and shouldered his way out.&rdquo; </i>(GOT, Jon V)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;They ate cold salt beef, hard bread, and harder cheese, and slept clothed and <b>huddled beneath a pile of cloaks and furs</b>, grateful for each other&rsquo;s warmth.&rdquo; (ACOK, Jon VI)</i></p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s really the main way cloaks are involved in Jon&rsquo;s chapters, with there being one major exception though, involving a wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>The wedding between Alys Karstark and Sigorn of Thenn.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only does Jon arrange this marriage and give Alys away (which shows him acting as a Lord and King, not a Lord Commander), but he even has a new sigil created, a combination of the Karstark sigil and a symbol of the Thenns.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;The Thenns had no family arms as was customary amongst the nobles of the Seven Kingdoms, so Jon told the stewards to improvise&hellip;<b>The bride&rsquo;s cloak Sigorn fastened about Lady Alys&rsquo;s shoulders showed a bronze disk on a field of white wool, surrounded by flames made with wisps of crimson silk. </b>The echo of the Karstark sunburst was there for those who cared to look, but differenced to make the arms appropriate for House Thenn.&rdquo; (ADWD, Jon X)</i></p></blockquote><p>While arguably it may be more important to just get these two married, in order to help Alys and bring the wildings further into The North to help deal with the upcoming invasion, the symbolic practices need to be fulfilled to give this marriage actual weight in this world.&nbsp;</p><p>And Jon knows this.<br /></p><p>Even though others might think a maiden&rsquo;s cloak is not important (it is), Jon even has a maiden&rsquo;s cloak made for Alys &ndash;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Her maiden&rsquo;s cloak was the black wool of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. The Karstark sunburst sewn on its back was made of the same white fur that lined it.&rdquo; </i>(ADWD, Jon X).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Jon knows that just having Alys and Sigorn go to Karhold and say they&rsquo;re married, even with 200 Thenn men, isn&rsquo;t enough. The two not only had to have gotten married, but believe they are married themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>And for the marriage to be real, the cultural customs need to be fulfilled. That&rsquo;s why even the hollow weddings go through all the customs.&nbsp;</p><p>And the idea of Jon having a new sigil created for this new house, feeds into my original idea that while Jon might take the Stark name by marrying Sansa, there is more than a good chance that a new sigil will be created for the Starks.<br /></p><p>Finally, this wedding\nmatches pretty closely to Sansa&rsquo;s thoughts of what her wedding should&rsquo;ve been\nlike. </p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;She had dreamed of her wedding a thousand\ntimes, and always she had pictured how her betrothed would stand behind her\ntall and strong, <b>sweep the cloak of his\nprotection over her shoulders, and tenderly kiss her cheek as he leaned forward\nto fasten the clasp.</b>&rdquo;</i> (ASOS, Sansa III)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The\nMagnar all but ripped the maiden&rsquo;s cloak from Alys&rsquo;s shoulders, <b>but when he fastened her bride&rsquo;s cloak\nabout her he was almost tender. As he leaned down to kiss her cheek, their\nbreath mingled.&rdquo;</b> (ADWD, Jon X)</p></blockquote><p>The wedding that was only possible because of Jon Snow, has an intimate description of\nthe groom and bride that is a close match to Sansa&rsquo;s dream wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>And\nsimilar to how this wedding may not have been Alys&rsquo;s ideal wedding, Sansa&rsquo;s\nwedding to Jon might not be everything she wanted when she was a child, but it\nwill hopefully be the right mix of her dreams meeting reality.&nbsp;<br /></p><hr /><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cf5617bf58d56a2c315cfa3c24c61162/tumblr_inline_pi2bn05lnx1qg9ixw_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br />In conclusion, cloaks matter a lot in the world of Westeros, as simple clothing items to proud and important symbols that the characters wear. Like other clothing, they can emphasize what the characters are trying to say and show about themselves as well as reveal what they are truly about.&nbsp;</p><p>Both Jon and Sansa have importance given to cloaks in their individual chapters in the books as well as in the show, when they are reunited and join forces.</p><p>The cloaking ceremony is integral to the weddings of Westeros and what weddings should represent in this world. And with all the less than ideal weddings happening in the story, it&rsquo;s interesting that while Jon and Sansa haven&rsquo;t been married, they&rsquo;ve created their own cloaking ceremonies with their genuine intent to build a new relationship together.&nbsp;</p><p>Their symbolic cloakings have more weight to them than the real weddings that have played out in the story.&nbsp;</p><p>And of course, with the fact that both Jon and Sansa have cloaked the other in a way, leads to a more balance foundation built on equal trust and protection.&nbsp;</p><p>The three cloakings that can be applied to Jonsa are important in their own right, but truthfully, are building to what I believe will be a real and truly proper cloaking ceremony in their future wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>A wedding where Sansa will get to be the happy bride, safe and loved, and Jon will have what he always thought he couldn&rsquo;t, a wife and a family and the Stark name.&nbsp;</p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f3683673f3c0cbe468b0b788a38f7e3/tumblr_inline_pi2bm0hKk01qg9ixw_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure>\n<p><br />The Cloaking Ceremony is an integral part to weddings across all the different regions of Westeros, and while for the show the ceremony is primarily in the background, both texts still provide an interesting connection in regards to Jon and Sansa and their relationship.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>In my post, <a href=\"http://lady-griffin.tumblr.com/post/175745619826/jon-stark-by-marrying-sansa-stark\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Jon Stark, by Marrying Sansa Stark</b></a> &ndash;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I analyzed the potential relationship and future for Jon and Sansa, the idea being that Jon would take Sansa&rsquo;s last name when they got married.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now in that post, I missed what is an important parallel and step towards Jon taking Sansa&rsquo;s name &ndash; that Sansa has cloaked Jon in &ldquo;Stark colors&rdquo; or a cloak embroidered with the Stark sigil, to be more accurate.</p>\n<p>Symbolically, a bridal cloak. <br /></p>\n<p>Now in the books there&rsquo;s more cultural significance put on the cloaking ceremony than in the show, but we do see it happening within the show during several weddings.</p>\n<p>In fact, only two weddings within the show didn&rsquo;t have a cloaking ceremony - Robb Stark &amp; Talisa&rsquo;s wedding and Rhaegar Targaryen &amp; Lyanna Stark&rsquo;s wedding - two weddings where the couples&rsquo; are eloping in secret.</p>\n<p>But before we go more into the ceremony, we need to talk about the two main roles cloaks have within the text.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Firstly, they provide practical use within the world.&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>Usually part of the description for a character&rsquo;s look.&nbsp;Sometimes cloaks are worn just as regular articles of clothing, or they&rsquo;re worn when a character is trying to hide or disguise themselves or the cloak is simply worn to protect the character from the weather, most notably in the very cold North and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Secondly, they are symbolic articles</b></p>\n<p>Usually representing either status and or house lineage. Many characters (nobles) wear cloaks with their house colors or sigil or wear a brooch or pin with their house symbol fasten to their cloaks. In addition, the colors of cloaks identify the organization of the wearer &ndash; from the Kingsguards&rsquo; white cloaks to the City Guard, adeptly named the Gold Cloaks, to the Night&rsquo;s Watch&rsquo;s black cloaks (clothing).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Cloaking Ceremony is a clear symbolic usage of cloaks, involving two types of cloaks - The Maiden&rsquo;s Cloak and the Bridal Cloak. <br /></p>\n<p>A woman goes into the ceremony wearing a cloak of her own house (maiden&rsquo;s cloak), but leaves wearing her husbands&rsquo; (bridal cloak).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The idea being the woman sheds the cloak representing her family&rsquo;s house and her loyalties to them. Then the husband places a cloak representing his house onto the wife, symbolizing she is under his and his family&rsquo;s protection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sansa even describes the bridal cloak as <i><b>&ldquo;the cloak of his protection,&rdquo;</b> </i>when she thinks about how her wedding should&rsquo;ve when she is married to Tyrion (Sansa III, ASOS).</p>\n<p>In the show, the ceremony is a bit different than in the books &ndash; the biggest difference being that there is only the bridal cloak, no maiden&rsquo;s cloak. <br /></p>\n<p>Within the text (book and show) we have seen the cloaking ceremony several times. The snag is that with a decent amount of the weddings we&rsquo;ve seen, it&rsquo;s just a ceremony for ceremony sake. The actual meaning is left out as the two main parties, not just the husband and wife, are not being genuine with their intentions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a hollow spectacle.</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/989269f33751da0929bc4fb2ddea5818/tumblr_inline_pi1ik9Z3Ze1qg9ixw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br />Sansa and Tyrion&rsquo;s wedding is a good example of the hollow spectacle, minus the more than common gory ending of\nthese &lsquo;false weddings&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As neither Sansa nor Tyrion wanted the wedding, but were forced into it &ndash; Sansa more than Tyrion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, while it is still a legal wedding and everyone says and does their part &ndash; the wedding and the cloaking ceremony are empty acts, nothing more than show.</p>\n<p>Now to be fair &ndash; Tyrion does honestly swear to protect Sansa. But, the main point is that Sansa as a hostage to the Lannisters is in no place to truly refuse or consent, her agreement to this whole thing is an empty gesture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can do all the motions and say all the words, but there has to be something behind those actions and words for it to actually mean something.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>While the bride&rsquo;s side (and consent) can be minimized in its importance to the wedding as she&rsquo;s being given away, it&rsquo;s the weddings where the bride (and or her family) weren&rsquo;t being honest with their intentions that leads to these deadly wedding (marriage) ends. The Westerlings. The Freys. The Tyrells.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Robert and Cersei&rsquo;s wedding (and marriage) was nothing more than empty ceremony and we saw how well that turned out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the husband is supposed to swear an oath to protect his new wife, the same isn&rsquo;t true for the wife, and all of these deadly weddings, potentially show the dangers of this uneven ceremony. </p>\n<p>In the reverse though, we have Jon and\nSansa who haven&rsquo;t even come close to getting married to one another within the actual text, of either show or book.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re\nnot married and haven&rsquo;t done a proper and official cloaking ceremony at all, and yet they\nhave, in a way.</p>\n</p>",

                "content": "<p>In which we continue a discussion with @aweseeds and try to work through his/her gibberish.</p><p><b><i>Are the North servants of Jon and the Starks?</i></b><i></i></p><p><i>Jon&rsquo;s position is elected. &nbsp;As LF pointed out and the Northern lords reminded Sansa, Jon can be forced to abdicate. &nbsp;It is a much weaker kingship than a united Westeros was and the lords appear to have more power. &nbsp;I do think that Jon views the North as his servants and thinks they should all kneel in submission to his new Kween. &nbsp;This will come back to bite him in Season 8 and I believe that he will end up being stripped of power by the lords.</i></p><p><b>Jon&rsquo;s position is absolutely not elected. &nbsp;There were no other candidates for King. &nbsp;The Northerners didn&rsquo;t even consider Sansa, the last known trueborn Stark as a candidate.</b></p><p><i>The fact that the North chose Jon over his sister means that it is elected. &nbsp;Jon has no rights to Winterfell as a bastard. &nbsp;Sansa should have been declared queen based on the rules of inheritance and Bran before her.</i></p><p><b>Jon was not serving some four-year term as King.&nbsp;</b></p><p><i>But he was still elected.&nbsp; Just because it is for life doesn&rsquo;t mean that it isn&rsquo;t elected.</i></p><p><b>Any plan to overthrow him by his very subjects is TREASON. &nbsp;</b></p><p><i>So now you are arguing that subjects have no right to disagree with their monarch or defy him or her even a bad monarch who they disagree with.</i></p><p><b>Jon&rsquo;s kingship was based on proclamation by his then subjects, his blood connection to previous kings, and successfully defeating the House that ruled the North. &nbsp;As Lyanna Mormont said &ldquo;Ned Stark&rsquo;s blood runs through his veins.&rdquo; (This is true even thought he is not Ned&rsquo;s son, he still has as much Stark blood as Sansa or any of the Stark children.) Those who want Sansa to be Queen have to base any claim on the fact that she is a Stark.</b></p><p><i>And?&nbsp; People vote for those with certain family names all the time in democracies.&nbsp; Ever heard of the Kennedys?</i></p><p><i>But Jon was elected partially because of his own merit.&nbsp; (Of course, the show should have done a better job showing he had merit, but still.)&nbsp; He has lost the confidence of his lords because of his disastrous decisions as king.&nbsp; The lords prefer Sansa particularly because she is doing a competent job ruling them.</i><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>That is why Sansa&rsquo;s undermining Jon in front of his bannermen was so politically terrible. &nbsp;She accused him of not offering any benefit to being loyal to him &amp; not punishing treason when he refused to punish the Umber &amp; Karstark children for their father&rsquo;s sins, and abandoning his people when he decided to lead a diplomatic mission to gain an important ally and resources the North desperately needed for its very survival against the Night King, who would slaughter every Northerner and use them as soldiers to kill more people. When his very sister was no qualms about publicly opposing his decisions instead of respecting his authority, some lords might think they can speak treason when they disagree with their King.</b></p><p><i>So now a ruler&rsquo;s subjects have no right to speak out in public against him or her.&nbsp; You will agree that this applies to Jon with regards to Daenerys.&nbsp; Using your own logic, he has no right to speak against her in public.&nbsp; After all, that would really cause the North to rebel against their new Targaryen tyrant.</i></p><p><b>Yes, Jon&rsquo;s subjects are expected to kneel before Queen Daenerys because their King has knelt and been named Warden of the North.
