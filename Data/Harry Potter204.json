Ladies, gentleman, and everyone else, let me introduce you to \u00ab Les Maraudeurs \u00bb, an album about the Marauders and all their friends, in their wild youth. Just photos, and dialogue or description, because damn it we lack of Marauders contents and they\u2019re so freaking cool.

The new girl from Durmstrang. Everybody wanted to talk to you, everybody wanted to be your friend. You were the new toy all children were fighting to be the first to play with. So naturally, he was curious. What was the reason for you switching schools? Had you left voluntarily? Had you been expelled for hexing someone into the next dimension? Did you drink Vodka for breakfast? He was determined to find out.</p><p>Hogwarts was big, but it wasn&lsquo;t that big - everyone knew each other at least from passing by in the hallways, so he realised who you were the moment he lay eyes on you. And damn. You were exceeding even his greatest expectations.</p><p>You were talking to Lily, smiling, but your shoulders hunched and your fingers fiddling with the hem of your jumper. A mischievous smirk spread out on Sirius&lsquo; lips as he took in your appearance.</p><p>It was time to get to know the new girl.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Tag List:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0DSnLbVcPULe7md0CTSzlw\">@daehwibby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjXR_5bW-KDpUL2G56fRivA\">@maycountessofdarkness</a> </p>",

He didn\u2019t know whether he should floo into Lyra\u2019s room and potentially disturb her or wait for her to extend the invitation. It was nearing 8pm and he hadn\u2019t heard a peep from her.</p><p>He tried to preoccupy himself, of course. First, he stopped by at the staff room and engaged in some idle chatter with his colleagues. Lyra\u2019s discovery was obviously the hot topic and most were intrigued to see how it all went at the hospital. He tolerated the conversations for as long as he could before retreating to his dungeons.</p><!-- more --><p>He had marked all of his assignments, his lessons for the week were all planned, he even pulled apart his storage room, reorganising every ingredient and still no word.</p><p>Maybe she was just busy. She had an entire report to write anyway.</p><p>Maybe she had simply forgotten about him or maybe she had gotten too caught up in conversation with Gustav. Was he the author of those letters written in Russian?</p><p>He knew the name was definitely european but the man\u2019s accent didn\u2019t seem slavic. Gustav was a handsome man with classic nordic features; blue eyes, blonde hair, pale skin and a sharp jaw. He was also obviously a pureblood as well, having attended Durmstrang.</p><p>Maybe Lyra was considering Gustav as a possible husband to satisfy her family\u2019s demands.</p><p>Severus felt unsettled and a little bit heartbroken as he considered it. The doubts began to take a hold of him and he began to admonish himself. Severus couldn\u2019t compare to a man like Gustav, not only that but there would be no way her family would tolerate her tainting them family name like that. It was stupid to think that this whole thing would work out.</p><p>It was probably for the best.</p><p>If the Dark Lord came back and caught any wind of their relationship he would be done for. He wouldn\u2019t be able to tolerate placing Lyra in such a vulnerable position. She\u2019d be tortured, raped and killed if there was even a doubt of his loyalty. It didn\u2019t matter that she was a Lestrange, she\u2019d be used against him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stomach the thought.</p><p>Severus slammed the book he had been trying to read shut and got up, walking over to his wine cabinet. He pulled out a cheap bottle and uncorked it, settling himself in his armchair. He drank and drank, wanting the ache in his chest to subside.</p><p>He was nearing the end of the bottle as the room was lit from the emerald flames that appeared in his fireplace. The dark haired witch clambered out, dusting herself off as she did so. She smiled at the sight of her love but her face dropped slightly as she saw his stone expression.</p><p>\u201cEverything alright, Sev?\u201d she asked as she walked towards him. Her eyes darted to the bottle that was empty next to him and it she realised it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said casually, nursing his drink.</p><p>Lyra hoped Severus would continue the conversation but he didn\u2019t seem interested. She felt nervous but sat down and tried to engage with him normally. \u201cI was hoping you were going to come by earlier,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve only just finished my paper. I\u2019ve owled it off along with Silvanus\u2019 so we\u2019ll see how everything goes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, he just continued to stare at the same spot as he was before.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s hand reached out and touched his arm lightly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Sev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis whole thing is a mistake,\u201d he said.</p><p>She sighed deeply before saying, \u201cWe\u2019re back onto this, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, I can\u2019t be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d she stood up from the chair and returned to the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cLook how easy it is for you to walk away. Already have someone else in mind?\u201d</p><p>She stopped and laughed, \u201cSo this is because you\u2019re insecure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you have a thing with someone else,\u201d he said, \u201cGustav maybe? A russian friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat possessed you to think like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucius and Narcissa will surely be proud that their niece has found a nice pure-blood man to settle down with. It\u2019ll be a shame your parents can\u2019t come to the wedding. I guess Lucius could pull some strings at the ministry as he usual does for his darling Lyra. Imagine how much fun it\u2019d be with Dementors as attendees.\u201d</p><p>Lyra took his torment with a fire in her eyes but she restrained herself. She knew he was drunk and pulled out her wand, \u2018 accio sobering potion\u2019 she cast non-verbally and a vial flew into her hand. She pried the wine out of his hands and shoved the potion in instead.</p><p>He threw it back and looked dead in her eyes, \u201cMy statement still stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think I\u2019m fucking someone else?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>She returned to her seat and rubbed her eyes for a moment before looking at him. With a exasperated sigh she pulled his hand into hers, interlacing her fingers and said, \u201cSev, if you have concerns about our relationship then just tell me. I\u2019ll answer you honestly, I\u2019ll even let you go through my head if it\u2019ll bring you any comfort. I wish you could just trust me but I understand why don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t but I assure you that I\u2019m yours and I only have eyes for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with Gustav?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a friend,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd he\u2019s engaged to be married and he picked up that we might be in a relationship rather quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to be careful,\u201d he said, earning a nod from the girl. \u201cI went through your stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gathered as much,\u201d she said, \u201cReading material for the other night?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cWho were the letters to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of my friends from Durmstrang spoke Russian so when we write we just communicate in Russian,\u201d she replied, \u201cKeeps it away from prying eyes like Lucius and Cissy. It was mainly Ilya gossiping about a friend and speaking about work. There was also some letters to Anneli, she\u2019s a cursebreaker, thought I\u2019d get her to come in to help out with a class one day. If you want I can translate it word for word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you\u2019ve been worrying about, Sev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and the Dark Lord\u2019s return,\u201d he said, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to stay together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just pray it doesn\u2019t come to that,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cLyra, if he ever found out about us-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t because you\u2019ll teach me occlumency and I will protect that information with my life,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple, Lyra,\u201d he said with a sense of urgency in his voice, \u201cYou may have shown an affinity to occlumency but that guard would need to be up constantly, no matter what your emotion, no matter what was happening to you. What if you\u2019re tortured, Lyra? What if you were being raped? Do you think you could hold that barrier up?\u201d</p><p>Lyra remained silent, her jaw clenched as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a child anymore, Lyra. You won\u2019t be able to depend on your family to bail you out of tough situations. You would be forced to join the Death Eaters, to torture and to kill. God forbid you rebel against him or fail on his orders. How would you be able to cope with seeing your Uncle tortured or your cousin? There\u2019s no telling what they would do to you. If they caught wind of any vulnerability you have they would expose it and use it to manipulate you.\u201d</p><p>Severus groaned at Lyra\u2019s stunned silence, \u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t want to have a relationship with you, Lyra. It is a weakness that will be manipulated against us. It was naive to indulge in this for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do we do now?\u201d she asked, her voice and chest felt so heavy. Lyra was surprised that the words even came out. \u201cAre you going to obliviate me, Sev?\u201d</p><p>Severus swallowed hard and look down into his hands. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to bring himself to do that, to erase all the happy memories he had with her. His stomach sunk and he felt ill considering what would happen to either of them if their relationship came out.</p><p>\u201cTeach me,\u201d she urged. Her hand grabbed a hold of his upper arm and squeezed, tearing his vision from his hand and back up at her. \u201cSev, we need to try. Teach me occlumency. If it doesn\u2019t work then obliviate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, I\u2019d have to torture you.\u201d</p><p>She breathed in deeply, her breath stuttering on the intake slightly and breathed out loudly. Her hand pulled away and she sat up a little straighter in an attempt to feel more confident. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it worth it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSev, it\u2019s either this or obliviate me now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Lyra looked back over to the man whose eyes averted her gaze immediately. Both had a sickening churning in their stomachs and a sadness that overwhelmed them as they ticked over the possible outcomes for their future. Silence hung heavy between them for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you,\u201d he said, \u201cBut Lyra, tell me, on the slightest possibility that the Dark Lord doesn\u2019t return would you go against your family to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to deny myself a chance at happiness. I know, it\u2019s selfish but I haven\u2019t felt this way about anyone before.\u201d He looked over to her as she reached out once more, her hand settling for the arm of his chair this time. \u201cSeverus, I love you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sad smile and whispered, \u201cI love you too, Lyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can make this work,\u201d she said, returning his smile.</p><p>Despite the fact that his head was telling him that she was much too young and naive to know what she was getting into he found himself trusting her and her sweet words.</p><p>~</p><p>Morning came, a dull green light pouring in from the windows in Severus\u2019 quarters. The wizard awoke with Lyra sleeping soundly in his arms. He glanced over to the clock on the wall and noticed that it was half past seven. He sighed slightly, knowing that the weekend was now over and he would have to spend his day teaching ungrateful children rather than spend the day with his love.</p><p>The sigh was enough to stir Lyra from her sleep. Her eyes remained closed and instead she wiggled back into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cWe should get up,\u201d he said, noticing that Lyra\u2019s pattern of breathing had changed.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re so warm,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>He hummed slightly, \u201cBut it\u2019s time to get up, we\u2019ve got classes in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just call in sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d definitely keep our relationship under wraps.\u201d</p><p>She giggled slightly before yawning, \u201cBut I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve thought that before keeping us up all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou enjoyed it though,\u201d she said, rolling over and kissing him on the lips.</p><p>\u201cLyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fail to see you moving to leave the warmth of our bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bed,\u201d she corrected herself.</p><p>\u201cIt is rather difficult to leave.\u201d</p><p>A tongue darted out between her lips and her eyes were ignited with desire.</p><p>\u201cNow we certainly don\u2019t have time for that,\u201d Severus said, a smirk appearing on his lips.</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d she asked, her hand trailing down his chest and feeling his half hard member. Her hands wrapped around it slightly, loosely playing with it in her hand. Severus\u2019 eyes had a menacing look, as if to say \u2018don\u2019t test me\u2019 but all that did was spur her on.</p><p>Lyra slid under the covers and soon enough, Severus could feel Lyra\u2019s tongue trailing the length of his member. He closed his eyes tightly as he felt the tip of his cock become engulfed by the warmth of her mouth. Her tongue swirled around before she took him deeper inside.</p><p>She worked slowly and sensually, her hand wrapped around the base of his cock, stroking upwards into her mouth as she sucked and teased the tip.</p><p>Once he was fully erect, Lyra pushed his hips back causing him to lie flat on his back and position herself between his legs. Severus pushed the covers back, wanting to watch the witch as she sucked his dick.</p><p>She had a playful look in her eyes as she continued her blowjob. Every so often she would look up at him and catch his eyes, smiling at him as she rubbed the length of his cock before taking him back into her mouth.</p><p>It was truly a sight to behold.</p><p>Her eyes drifted shut as she focused on his cock and his pleasure. Her hand wrapped around the base of his cock tightly and she began to bob her head up and down the shaft of his cock. He groaned as she looked up at him with his whole length of his cock was in her mouth, the end hitting her throat.</p><p>She continued to move her mouth up and down, her pace quickening to a point before becoming more steady. Severus could feel his orgasm coming, his hips beginning to strain off the bed and into her mouth. Her hands held him down firmly as she continued to suck him off and he came soon after.</p><p>Lyra swallowed and crawled back up to lie next to her lover, pulling the sheets back up over them. She snuggled into him and Severus\u2019 hand drew circles on her back. His eyes glanced up at the clock and he closed his eyes, wishing it would slow down.</p><p>\u201cNeither of us will have time for breakfast,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI just had breakfast,\u201d she said, smiling cheekily at the man.</p><p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>She lay kisses on his chest, then on his cheek. With a final peck on his lips, Lyra sat up in bed and began to get dressed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start our lessons tonight,\u201d he said as Lyra finished pulling on her robe. \u201cAfter dinner.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>Lyra left his quarters through his fireplace with an unnerving feeling in the pit of her stomach. She showered quickly before her classes started, hoping that the water would wash her nerves away but they seemed to stick.</p><p>She looked at herself in the mirror and breathed slowly, employing the occlumency techniques she had learnt all those years ago.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>Let your mind go blank.</p><p>Imagine your mind is a stream and your thoughts are debris that gently passes by.</p><p>Do not dwell on these thoughts.</p><p>Let go of your emotions.</p><p>Do not allow yourself to be consumed by your feelings.</p><p>With each breath let go of your feelings until there is nothing.</p><p>Lyra felt an overwhelming sense of calm fill her as she recalled Severus\u2019 words. Her heart and mind were still but that calm and quiet was fleeting. She felt it leave as she heard the bustle of footsteps entering her classroom.</p><p>Quickly, she used her wand to make herself presentable before rushing down the stairs to address the second years.</p><p>Through the day, Lyra practiced her occlumency techniques, separating herself from any emotion she felt. Whether or not it would be effective would be difficult to determine, she\u2019d have to depend on Severus to be a witness to that.</p><p>Lyra knew she was no longer the girl she once was. As a teenager she was cunning and ambitious, motivated to pursue the Dark Arts and manipulate those around her but now as an adult she had become sensitive and vulnerable with the need to help others. She had broken down all the walls she had put up to allow herself to connect better with people and now she would have to put it all back up again. It was possible but it would be difficult, particularly when the person testing her resolve would be Severus.</p><p>That time came quickly. Her day had slipped away and after dinner Lyra found herself returning to Severus\u2019 quarters. She made sure that before she even entered her own fireplace that her mind was ready and on guard.</p><p>\u201cLegilimens,\u201d she heard from a far corner of the room.</p><p>Lyra blocked the intrusion with ease, confidently walking towards Severus\u2019 shadowy figure. Her heart leapt slightly as she felt herself being drawn to him and Severus flicked through memories of them together. From her blow job that morning, to their shared night at his old home. He kept digging deeper and deeper, revealing her feelings towards him, the way her heart ached for him. Lyra tried to quell her thoughts and emotions but it was relentless.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she said, closing her eyes and shutting their connection.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough, Lyra,\u201d he taunted.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she opened her eyes looking into his once more. His black orbs seeming to gaze deep into her soul.</p><p>\u201cHow do you expect to defend yourself after being tortured, Lyra?\u201d his voice was threatening, attempting to stir up emotions, trying to get her to fail.</p><p>\u201cGo again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegilimens.\u201d</p><p>His spell bounced off instantly, Lyra maintaining her nerve. She stared him down, empty of emotion, empty of her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, \u201cNow let\u2019s have a conversation and see how you fair. Sit.\u201d</p><p>Lyra took a seat in the armchair, angling it to face the other. She remained calm and composed as Severus did the same. He began to question her, asking her about her family and her relationship with them. Emotions came as quickly as the left, Lyra didn\u2019t dwell on what he was stirring, merely acknowledging each feeling as it passed. Her defense did not falter under the interrogation.</p><p>They spoke for an hour with Severus testing her intermittently through the conversation. Occasionally, Lyra would throw in a casual lie to see if it gathered any attention. They seemed to slip through unnoticed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stop here,\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve done well.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, exhausted from keeping it up for so long, slumping into her chair and her eyes drifting shut.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually it\u2019ll be second nature to you and you\u2019ll want to keep it up all the time.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were kept tightly shut and she nodded.</p><p>\u201cCome Lyra,\u201d he said. When she opened her eyes he was standing over her, his arm outstretched. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p>",

I\u2019ve owled it off along with Silvanus\u2019 so we\u2019ll see how everything goes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, he just continued to stare at the same spot as he was before.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s hand reached out and touched his arm lightly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Sev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis whole thing is a mistake,\u201d he said.</p><p>She sighed deeply before saying, \u201cWe\u2019re back onto this, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, I can\u2019t be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d she stood up from the chair and returned to the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cLook how easy it is for you to walk away. Already have someone else in mind?\u201d</p><p>She stopped and laughed, \u201cSo this is because you\u2019re insecure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you have a thing with someone else,\u201d he said, \u201cGustav maybe? A russian friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat possessed you to think like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucius and Narcissa will surely be proud that their niece has found a nice pure-blood man to settle down with. It\u2019ll be a shame your parents can\u2019t come to the wedding. I guess Lucius could pull some strings at the ministry as he usual does for his darling Lyra. Imagine how much fun it\u2019d be with Dementors as attendees.\u201d</p><p>Lyra took his torment with a fire in her eyes but she restrained herself. She knew he was drunk and pulled out her wand, \u2018 accio sobering potion\u2019 she cast non-verbally and a vial flew into her hand. She pried the wine out of his hands and shoved the potion in instead.</p><p>He threw it back and looked dead in her eyes, \u201cMy statement still stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think I\u2019m fucking someone else?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>She returned to her seat and rubbed her eyes for a moment before looking at him. With a exasperated sigh she pulled his hand into hers, interlacing her fingers and said, \u201cSev, if you have concerns about our relationship then just tell me. I\u2019ll answer you honestly, I\u2019ll even let you go through my head if it\u2019ll bring you any comfort. I wish you could just trust me but I understand why don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t but I assure you that I\u2019m yours and I only have eyes for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with Gustav?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a friend,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd he\u2019s engaged to be married and he picked up that we might be in a relationship rather quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to be careful,\u201d he said, earning a nod from the girl. \u201cI went through your stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gathered as much,\u201d she said, \u201cReading material for the other night?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cWho were the letters to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of my friends from Durmstrang spoke Russian so when we write we just communicate in Russian,\u201d she replied, \u201cKeeps it away from prying eyes like Lucius and Cissy. It was mainly Ilya gossiping about a friend and speaking about work. There was also some letters to Anneli, she\u2019s a cursebreaker, thought I\u2019d get her to come in to help out with a class one day. If you want I can translate it word for word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you\u2019ve been worrying about, Sev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and the Dark Lord\u2019s return,\u201d he said, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to stay together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just pray it doesn\u2019t come to that,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cLyra, if he ever found out about us-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t because you\u2019ll teach me occlumency and I will protect that information with my life,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple, Lyra,\u201d he said with a sense of urgency in his voice, \u201cYou may have shown an affinity to occlumency but that guard would need to be up constantly, no matter what your emotion, no matter what was happening to you. What if you\u2019re tortured, Lyra? What if you were being raped? Do you think you could hold that barrier up?\u201d</p><p>Lyra remained silent, her jaw clenched as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a child anymore, Lyra. You won\u2019t be able to depend on your family to bail you out of tough situations. You would be forced to join the Death Eaters, to torture and to kill. God forbid you rebel against him or fail on his orders. How would you be able to cope with seeing your Uncle tortured or your cousin? There\u2019s no telling what they would do to you. If they caught wind of any vulnerability you have they would expose it and use it to manipulate you.\u201d</p><p>Severus groaned at Lyra\u2019s stunned silence, \u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t want to have a relationship with you, Lyra. It is a weakness that will be manipulated against us. It was naive to indulge in this for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do we do now?\u201d she asked, her voice and chest felt so heavy. Lyra was surprised that the words even came out. \u201cAre you going to obliviate me, Sev?\u201d</p><p>Severus swallowed hard and look down into his hands. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to bring himself to do that, to erase all the happy memories he had with her. His stomach sunk and he felt ill considering what would happen to either of them if their relationship came out.</p><p>\u201cTeach me,\u201d she urged. Her hand grabbed a hold of his upper arm and squeezed, tearing his vision from his hand and back up at her. \u201cSev, we need to try. Teach me occlumency. If it doesn\u2019t work then obliviate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, I\u2019d have to torture you.\u201d</p><p>She breathed in deeply, her breath stuttering on the intake slightly and breathed out loudly. Her hand pulled away and she sat up a little straighter in an attempt to feel more confident. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it worth it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSev, it\u2019s either this or obliviate me now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Lyra looked back over to the man whose eyes averted her gaze immediately. Both had a sickening churning in their stomachs and a sadness that overwhelmed them as they ticked over the possible outcomes for their future. Silence hung heavy between them for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you,\u201d he said, \u201cBut Lyra, tell me, on the slightest possibility that the Dark Lord doesn\u2019t return would you go against your family to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to deny myself a chance at happiness. I know, it\u2019s selfish but I haven\u2019t felt this way about anyone before.\u201d He looked over to her as she reached out once more, her hand settling for the arm of his chair this time. \u201cSeverus, I love you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sad smile and whispered, \u201cI love you too, Lyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can make this work,\u201d she said, returning his smile.</p><p>Despite the fact that his head was telling him that she was much too young and naive to know what she was getting into he found himself trusting her and her sweet words.</p><p>~</p><p>Morning came, a dull green light pouring in from the windows in Severus\u2019 quarters. The wizard awoke with Lyra sleeping soundly in his arms. He glanced over to the clock on the wall and noticed that it was half past seven. He sighed slightly, knowing that the weekend was now over and he would have to spend his day teaching ungrateful children rather than spend the day with his love.</p><p>The sigh was enough to stir Lyra from her sleep. Her eyes remained closed and instead she wiggled back into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cWe should get up,\u201d he said, noticing that Lyra\u2019s pattern of breathing had changed.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re so warm,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>He hummed slightly, \u201cBut it\u2019s time to get up, we\u2019ve got classes in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just call in sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d definitely keep our relationship under wraps.\u201d</p><p>She giggled slightly before yawning, \u201cBut I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve thought that before keeping us up all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou enjoyed it though,\u201d she said, rolling over and kissing him on the lips.</p><p>\u201cLyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fail to see you moving to leave the warmth of our bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bed,\u201d she corrected herself.</p><p>\u201cIt is rather difficult to leave.\u201d</p><p>A tongue darted out between her lips and her eyes were ignited with desire.</p><p>\u201cNow we certainly don\u2019t have time for that,\u201d Severus said, a smirk appearing on his lips.</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d she asked, her hand trailing down his chest and feeling his half hard member. Her hands wrapped around it slightly, loosely playing with it in her hand. Severus\u2019 eyes had a menacing look, as if to say \u2018don\u2019t test me\u2019 but all that did was spur her on.</p><p>Lyra slid under the covers and soon enough, Severus could feel Lyra\u2019s tongue trailing the length of his member. He closed his eyes tightly as he felt the tip of his cock become engulfed by the warmth of her mouth. Her tongue swirled around before she took him deeper inside.</p><p>She worked slowly and sensually, her hand wrapped around the base of his cock, stroking upwards into her mouth as she sucked and teased the tip.</p><p>Once he was fully erect, Lyra pushed his hips back causing him to lie flat on his back and position herself between his legs. Severus pushed the covers back, wanting to watch the witch as she sucked his dick.</p><p>She had a playful look in her eyes as she continued her blowjob. Every so often she would look up at him and catch his eyes, smiling at him as she rubbed the length of his cock before taking him back into her mouth.</p><p>It was truly a sight to behold.</p><p>Her eyes drifted shut as she focused on his cock and his pleasure. Her hand wrapped around the base of his cock tightly and she began to bob her head up and down the shaft of his cock. He groaned as she looked up at him with his whole length of his cock was in her mouth, the end hitting her throat.</p><p>She continued to move her mouth up and down, her pace quickening to a point before becoming more steady. Severus could feel his orgasm coming, his hips beginning to strain off the bed and into her mouth. Her hands held him down firmly as she continued to suck him off and he came soon after.</p><p>Lyra swallowed and crawled back up to lie next to her lover, pulling the sheets back up over them. She snuggled into him and Severus\u2019 hand drew circles on her back. His eyes glanced up at the clock and he closed his eyes, wishing it would slow down.</p><p>\u201cNeither of us will have time for breakfast,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI just had breakfast,\u201d she said, smiling cheekily at the man.</p><p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>She lay kisses on his chest, then on his cheek. With a final peck on his lips, Lyra sat up in bed and began to get dressed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start our lessons tonight,\u201d he said as Lyra finished pulling on her robe. \u201cAfter dinner.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>Lyra left his quarters through his fireplace with an unnerving feeling in the pit of her stomach. She showered quickly before her classes started, hoping that the water would wash her nerves away but they seemed to stick.</p><p>She looked at herself in the mirror and breathed slowly, employing the occlumency techniques she had learnt all those years ago.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>Let your mind go blank.</p><p>Imagine your mind is a stream and your thoughts are debris that gently passes by.</p><p>Do not dwell on these thoughts.</p><p>Let go of your emotions.</p><p>Do not allow yourself to be consumed by your feelings.</p><p>With each breath let go of your feelings until there is nothing.</p><p>Lyra felt an overwhelming sense of calm fill her as she recalled Severus\u2019 words. Her heart and mind were still but that calm and quiet was fleeting. She felt it leave as she heard the bustle of footsteps entering her classroom.</p><p>Quickly, she used her wand to make herself presentable before rushing down the stairs to address the second years.</p><p>Through the day, Lyra practiced her occlumency techniques, separating herself from any emotion she felt. Whether or not it would be effective would be difficult to determine, she\u2019d have to depend on Severus to be a witness to that.</p><p>Lyra knew she was no longer the girl she once was. As a teenager she was cunning and ambitious, motivated to pursue the Dark Arts and manipulate those around her but now as an adult she had become sensitive and vulnerable with the need to help others. She had broken down all the walls she had put up to allow herself to connect better with people and now she would have to put it all back up again. It was possible but it would be difficult, particularly when the person testing her resolve would be Severus.</p><p>That time came quickly. Her day had slipped away and after dinner Lyra found herself returning to Severus\u2019 quarters. She made sure that before she even entered her own fireplace that her mind was ready and on guard.</p><p>\u201cLegilimens,\u201d she heard from a far corner of the room.</p><p>Lyra blocked the intrusion with ease, confidently walking towards Severus\u2019 shadowy figure. Her heart leapt slightly as she felt herself being drawn to him and Severus flicked through memories of them together. From her blow job that morning, to their shared night at his old home. He kept digging deeper and deeper, revealing her feelings towards him, the way her heart ached for him. Lyra tried to quell her thoughts and emotions but it was relentless.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she said, closing her eyes and shutting their connection.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough, Lyra,\u201d he taunted.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she opened her eyes looking into his once more. His black orbs seeming to gaze deep into her soul.</p><p>\u201cHow do you expect to defend yourself after being tortured, Lyra?\u201d his voice was threatening, attempting to stir up emotions, trying to get her to fail.</p><p>\u201cGo again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegilimens.\u201d</p><p>His spell bounced off instantly, Lyra maintaining her nerve. She stared him down, empty of emotion, empty of her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, \u201cNow let\u2019s have a conversation and see how you fair. Sit.\u201d</p><p>Lyra took a seat in the armchair, angling it to face the other. She remained calm and composed as Severus did the same. He began to question her, asking her about her family and her relationship with them. Emotions came as quickly as the left, Lyra didn\u2019t dwell on what he was stirring, merely acknowledging each feeling as it passed. Her defense did not falter under the interrogation.</p><p>They spoke for an hour with Severus testing her intermittently through the conversation. Occasionally, Lyra would throw in a casual lie to see if it gathered any attention. They seemed to slip through unnoticed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stop here,\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve done well.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, exhausted from keeping it up for so long, slumping into her chair and her eyes drifting shut.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually it\u2019ll be second nature to you and you\u2019ll want to keep it up all the time.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were kept tightly shut and she nodded.</p><p>\u201cCome Lyra,\u201d he said. When she opened her eyes he was standing over her, his arm outstretched. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p>",

He didn\u2019t know whether he should floo into Lyra\u2019s room and potentially disturb her or wait for her to extend the invitation. It was nearing 8pm and he hadn\u2019t heard a peep from her.</p><p>He tried to preoccupy himself, of course. First, he stopped by at the staff room and engaged in some idle chatter with his colleagues. Lyra\u2019s discovery was obviously the hot topic and most were intrigued to see how it all went at the hospital. He tolerated the conversations for as long as he could before retreating to his dungeons.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He had marked all of his assignments, his lessons for the week were all planned, he even pulled apart his storage room, reorganising every ingredient and still no word.</p><p>Maybe she was just busy. She had an entire report to write anyway.</p><p>Maybe she had simply forgotten about him or maybe she had gotten too caught up in conversation with Gustav. Was he the author of those letters written in Russian?</p><p>He knew the name was definitely european but the man\u2019s accent didn\u2019t seem slavic. Gustav was a handsome man with classic nordic features; blue eyes, blonde hair, pale skin and a sharp jaw. He was also obviously a pureblood as well, having attended Durmstrang.</p><p>Maybe Lyra was considering Gustav as a possible husband to satisfy her family\u2019s demands.</p><p>Severus felt unsettled and a little bit heartbroken as he considered it. The doubts began to take a hold of him and he began to admonish himself. Severus couldn\u2019t compare to a man like Gustav, not only that but there would be no way her family would tolerate her tainting them family name like that. It was stupid to think that this whole thing would work out.</p><p>It was probably for the best.</p><p>If the Dark Lord came back and caught any wind of their relationship he would be done for. He wouldn\u2019t be able to tolerate placing Lyra in such a vulnerable position. She\u2019d be tortured, raped and killed if there was even a doubt of his loyalty. It didn\u2019t matter that she was a Lestrange, she\u2019d be used against him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stomach the thought.</p><p>Severus slammed the book he had been trying to read shut and got up, walking over to his wine cabinet. He pulled out a cheap bottle and uncorked it, settling himself in his armchair. He drank and drank, wanting the ache in his chest to subside.</p><p>He was nearing the end of the bottle as the room was lit from the emerald flames that appeared in his fireplace. The dark haired witch clambered out, dusting herself off as she did so. She smiled at the sight of her love but her face dropped slightly as she saw his stone expression.</p><p>\u201cEverything alright, Sev?\u201d she asked as she walked towards him. Her eyes darted to the bottle that was empty next to him and it she realised it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said casually, nursing his drink.</p><p>Lyra hoped Severus would continue the conversation but he didn\u2019t seem interested. She felt nervous but sat down and tried to engage with him normally. \u201cI was hoping you were going to come by earlier,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve only just finished my paper. I\u2019ve owled it off along with Silvanus\u2019 so we\u2019ll see how everything goes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, he just continued to stare at the same spot as he was before.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s hand reached out and touched his arm lightly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Sev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis whole thing is a mistake,\u201d he said.</p><p>She sighed deeply before saying, \u201cWe\u2019re back onto this, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, I can\u2019t be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d she stood up from the chair and returned to the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cLook how easy it is for you to walk away. Already have someone else in mind?\u201d</p><p>She stopped and laughed, \u201cSo this is because you\u2019re insecure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you have a thing with someone else,\u201d he said, \u201cGustav maybe? A russian friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat possessed you to think like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucius and Narcissa will surely be proud that their niece has found a nice pure-blood man to settle down with. It\u2019ll be a shame your parents can\u2019t come to the wedding. I guess Lucius could pull some strings at the ministry as he usual does for his darling Lyra. Imagine how much fun it\u2019d be with Dementors as attendees.\u201d</p><p>Lyra took his torment with a fire in her eyes but she restrained herself. She knew he was drunk and pulled out her wand, \u2018 accio sobering potion\u2019 she cast non-verbally and a vial flew into her hand. She pried the wine out of his hands and shoved the potion in instead.</p><p>He threw it back and looked dead in her eyes, \u201cMy statement still stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think I\u2019m fucking someone else?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>She returned to her seat and rubbed her eyes for a moment before looking at him. With a exasperated sigh she pulled his hand into hers, interlacing her fingers and said, \u201cSev, if you have concerns about our relationship then just tell me. I\u2019ll answer you honestly, I\u2019ll even let you go through my head if it\u2019ll bring you any comfort. I wish you could just trust me but I understand why don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t but I assure you that I\u2019m yours and I only have eyes for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with Gustav?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a friend,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd he\u2019s engaged to be married and he picked up that we might be in a relationship rather quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to be careful,\u201d he said, earning a nod from the girl. \u201cI went through your stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gathered as much,\u201d she said, \u201cReading material for the other night?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cWho were the letters to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of my friends from Durmstrang spoke Russian so when we write we just communicate in Russian,\u201d she replied, \u201cKeeps it away from prying eyes like Lucius and Cissy. It was mainly Ilya gossiping about a friend and speaking about work. There was also some letters to Anneli, she\u2019s a cursebreaker, thought I\u2019d get her to come in to help out with a class one day. If you want I can translate it word for word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you\u2019ve been worrying about, Sev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and the Dark Lord\u2019s return,\u201d he said, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to stay together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just pray it doesn\u2019t come to that,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cLyra, if he ever found out about us-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t because you\u2019ll teach me occlumency and I will protect that information with my life,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple, Lyra,\u201d he said with a sense of urgency in his voice, \u201cYou may have shown an affinity to occlumency but that guard would need to be up constantly, no matter what your emotion, no matter what was happening to you. What if you\u2019re tortured, Lyra? What if you were being raped? Do you think you could hold that barrier up?\u201d</p><p>Lyra remained silent, her jaw clenched as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a child anymore, Lyra. You won\u2019t be able to depend on your family to bail you out of tough situations. You would be forced to join the Death Eaters, to torture and to kill. God forbid you rebel against him or fail on his orders. How would you be able to cope with seeing your Uncle tortured or your cousin? There\u2019s no telling what they would do to you. If they caught wind of any vulnerability you have they would expose it and use it to manipulate you.\u201d</p><p>Severus groaned at Lyra\u2019s stunned silence, \u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t want to have a relationship with you, Lyra. It is a weakness that will be manipulated against us. It was naive to indulge in this for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do we do now?\u201d she asked, her voice and chest felt so heavy. Lyra was surprised that the words even came out. \u201cAre you going to obliviate me, Sev?\u201d</p><p>Severus swallowed hard and look down into his hands. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to bring himself to do that, to erase all the happy memories he had with her. His stomach sunk and he felt ill considering what would happen to either of them if their relationship came out.</p><p>\u201cTeach me,\u201d she urged. Her hand grabbed a hold of his upper arm and squeezed, tearing his vision from his hand and back up at her. \u201cSev, we need to try. Teach me occlumency. If it doesn\u2019t work then obliviate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, I\u2019d have to torture you.\u201d</p><p>She breathed in deeply, her breath stuttering on the intake slightly and breathed out loudly. Her hand pulled away and she sat up a little straighter in an attempt to feel more confident. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it worth it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSev, it\u2019s either this or obliviate me now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Lyra looked back over to the man whose eyes averted her gaze immediately. Both had a sickening churning in their stomachs and a sadness that overwhelmed them as they ticked over the possible outcomes for their future. Silence hung heavy between them for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you,\u201d he said, \u201cBut Lyra, tell me, on the slightest possibility that the Dark Lord doesn\u2019t return would you go against your family to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to deny myself a chance at happiness. I know, it\u2019s selfish but I haven\u2019t felt this way about anyone before.\u201d He looked over to her as she reached out once more, her hand settling for the arm of his chair this time. \u201cSeverus, I love you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sad smile and whispered, \u201cI love you too, Lyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can make this work,\u201d she said, returning his smile.</p><p>Despite the fact that his head was telling him that she was much too young and naive to know what she was getting into he found himself trusting her and her sweet words.</p><p>~</p><p>Morning came, a dull green light pouring in from the windows in Severus\u2019 quarters. The wizard awoke with Lyra sleeping soundly in his arms. He glanced over to the clock on the wall and noticed that it was half past seven. He sighed slightly, knowing that the weekend was now over and he would have to spend his day teaching ungrateful children rather than spend the day with his love.</p><p>The sigh was enough to stir Lyra from her sleep. Her eyes remained closed and instead she wiggled back into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cWe should get up,\u201d he said, noticing that Lyra\u2019s pattern of breathing had changed.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re so warm,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>He hummed slightly, \u201cBut it\u2019s time to get up, we\u2019ve got classes in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just call in sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d definitely keep our relationship under wraps.\u201d</p><p>She giggled slightly before yawning, \u201cBut I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve thought that before keeping us up all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou enjoyed it though,\u201d she said, rolling over and kissing him on the lips.</p><p>\u201cLyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fail to see you moving to leave the warmth of our bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bed,\u201d she corrected herself.</p><p>\u201cIt is rather difficult to leave.\u201d</p><p>A tongue darted out between her lips and her eyes were ignited with desire.</p><p>\u201cNow we certainly don\u2019t have time for that,\u201d Severus said, a smirk appearing on his lips.</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d she asked, her hand trailing down his chest and feeling his half hard member. Her hands wrapped around it slightly, loosely playing with it in her hand. Severus\u2019 eyes had a menacing look, as if to say \u2018don\u2019t test me\u2019 but all that did was spur her on.</p><p>Lyra slid under the covers and soon enough, Severus could feel Lyra\u2019s tongue trailing the length of his member. He closed his eyes tightly as he felt the tip of his cock become engulfed by the warmth of her mouth. Her tongue swirled around before she took him deeper inside.</p><p>She worked slowly and sensually, her hand wrapped around the base of his cock, stroking upwards into her mouth as she sucked and teased the tip.</p><p>Once he was fully erect, Lyra pushed his hips back causing him to lie flat on his back and position herself between his legs. Severus pushed the covers back, wanting to watch the witch as she sucked his dick.</p><p>She had a playful look in her eyes as she continued her blowjob. Every so often she would look up at him and catch his eyes, smiling at him as she rubbed the length of his cock before taking him back into her mouth.</p><p>It was truly a sight to behold.</p><p>Her eyes drifted shut as she focused on his cock and his pleasure. Her hand wrapped around the base of his cock tightly and she began to bob her head up and down the shaft of his cock. He groaned as she looked up at him with his whole length of his cock was in her mouth, the end hitting her throat.</p><p>She continued to move her mouth up and down, her pace quickening to a point before becoming more steady. Severus could feel his orgasm coming, his hips beginning to strain off the bed and into her mouth. Her hands held him down firmly as she continued to suck him off and he came soon after.</p><p>Lyra swallowed and crawled back up to lie next to her lover, pulling the sheets back up over them. She snuggled into him and Severus\u2019 hand drew circles on her back. His eyes glanced up at the clock and he closed his eyes, wishing it would slow down.</p><p>\u201cNeither of us will have time for breakfast,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI just had breakfast,\u201d she said, smiling cheekily at the man.</p><p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>She lay kisses on his chest, then on his cheek. With a final peck on his lips, Lyra sat up in bed and began to get dressed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start our lessons tonight,\u201d he said as Lyra finished pulling on her robe. \u201cAfter dinner.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>Lyra left his quarters through his fireplace with an unnerving feeling in the pit of her stomach. She showered quickly before her classes started, hoping that the water would wash her nerves away but they seemed to stick.</p><p>She looked at herself in the mirror and breathed slowly, employing the occlumency techniques she had learnt all those years ago.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>Let your mind go blank.</p><p>Imagine your mind is a stream and your thoughts are debris that gently passes by.</p><p>Do not dwell on these thoughts.</p><p>Let go of your emotions.</p><p>Do not allow yourself to be consumed by your feelings.</p><p>With each breath let go of your feelings until there is nothing.</p><p>Lyra felt an overwhelming sense of calm fill her as she recalled Severus\u2019 words. Her heart and mind were still but that calm and quiet was fleeting. She felt it leave as she heard the bustle of footsteps entering her classroom.</p><p>Quickly, she used her wand to make herself presentable before rushing down the stairs to address the second years.</p><p>Through the day, Lyra practiced her occlumency techniques, separating herself from any emotion she felt. Whether or not it would be effective would be difficult to determine, she\u2019d have to depend on Severus to be a witness to that.</p><p>Lyra knew she was no longer the girl she once was. As a teenager she was cunning and ambitious, motivated to pursue the Dark Arts and manipulate those around her but now as an adult she had become sensitive and vulnerable with the need to help others. She had broken down all the walls she had put up to allow herself to connect better with people and now she would have to put it all back up again. It was possible but it would be difficult, particularly when the person testing her resolve would be Severus.</p><p>That time came quickly. Her day had slipped away and after dinner Lyra found herself returning to Severus\u2019 quarters. She made sure that before she even entered her own fireplace that her mind was ready and on guard.</p><p>\u201cLegilimens,\u201d she heard from a far corner of the room.</p><p>Lyra blocked the intrusion with ease, confidently walking towards Severus\u2019 shadowy figure. Her heart leapt slightly as she felt herself being drawn to him and Severus flicked through memories of them together. From her blow job that morning, to their shared night at his old home. He kept digging deeper and deeper, revealing her feelings towards him, the way her heart ached for him. Lyra tried to quell her thoughts and emotions but it was relentless.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she said, closing her eyes and shutting their connection.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough, Lyra,\u201d he taunted.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she opened her eyes looking into his once more. His black orbs seeming to gaze deep into her soul.</p><p>\u201cHow do you expect to defend yourself after being tortured, Lyra?\u201d his voice was threatening, attempting to stir up emotions, trying to get her to fail.</p><p>\u201cGo again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegilimens.\u201d</p><p>His spell bounced off instantly, Lyra maintaining her nerve. She stared him down, empty of emotion, empty of her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, \u201cNow let\u2019s have a conversation and see how you fair. Sit.\u201d</p><p>Lyra took a seat in the armchair, angling it to face the other. She remained calm and composed as Severus did the same. He began to question her, asking her about her family and her relationship with them. Emotions came as quickly as the left, Lyra didn\u2019t dwell on what he was stirring, merely acknowledging each feeling as it passed. Her defense did not falter under the interrogation.</p><p>They spoke for an hour with Severus testing her intermittently through the conversation. Occasionally, Lyra would throw in a casual lie to see if it gathered any attention. They seemed to slip through unnoticed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stop here,\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve done well.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, exhausted from keeping it up for so long, slumping into her chair and her eyes drifting shut.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually it\u2019ll be second nature to you and you\u2019ll want to keep it up all the time.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were kept tightly shut and she nodded.</p><p>\u201cCome Lyra,\u201d he said. When she opened her eyes he was standing over her, his arm outstretched. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><i>Summary:&nbsp;The daughter of Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange is a Healer who finds herself not only haunted by her past but also questioning her choice in career. When Lyra Lestrange&rsquo;s old headmaster offers her a position as Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher she finds herself thrown into an adventure involving a secret affair with a colleague, discovering the cure for a disease and dealing with students cursing themselves. Who knew that being a Hogwarts Professor was such a rollercoaster?</i></p><p><i>Set in the school year of 1990-1991 with the prospect of a sequel, or two, on the horizon.</i></p><p><i>\n\n<i><b>Rated: </b>E for graphic sex scenes in THIS and later chapters.

He didn&rsquo;t know whether he should floo into Lyra&rsquo;s room and potentially disturb her or wait for her to extend the invitation. It was nearing 8pm and he hadn&rsquo;t heard a peep from her.</p><p>He tried to preoccupy himself, of course. First, he stopped by at the staff room and engaged in some idle chatter with his colleagues. Lyra&rsquo;s discovery was obviously the hot topic and most were intrigued to see how it all went at the hospital. He tolerated the conversations for as long as he could before retreating to his dungeons.</p><p>He had marked all of his assignments, his lessons for the week were all planned, he even pulled apart his storage room, reorganising every ingredient and still no word.</p><p>Maybe she was just busy. She had an entire report to write anyway.</p><p>Maybe she had simply forgotten about him or maybe she had gotten too caught up in conversation with Gustav. Was he the author of those letters written in Russian?</p><p>He knew the name was definitely european but the man&rsquo;s accent didn&rsquo;t seem slavic. Gustav was a handsome man with classic nordic features; blue eyes, blonde hair, pale skin and a sharp jaw. He was also obviously a pureblood as well, having attended Durmstrang.</p><p>Maybe Lyra was considering Gustav as a possible husband to satisfy her family&rsquo;s demands.</p><p>Severus felt unsettled and a little bit heartbroken as he considered it. The doubts began to take a hold of him and he began to admonish himself. Severus couldn&rsquo;t compare to a man like Gustav, not only that but there would be no way her family would tolerate her tainting them family name like that. It was stupid to think that this whole thing would work out.</p><p>It was probably for the best.</p><p>If the Dark Lord came back and caught any wind of their relationship he would be done for. He wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tolerate placing Lyra in such a vulnerable position. She&rsquo;d be tortured, raped and killed if there was even a doubt of his loyalty. It didn&rsquo;t matter that she was a Lestrange, she&rsquo;d be used against him.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t stomach the thought.</p><p>Severus slammed the book he had been trying to read shut and got up, walking over to his wine cabinet. He pulled out a cheap bottle and uncorked it, settling himself in his armchair. He drank and drank, wanting the ache in his chest to subside.</p><p>He was nearing the end of the bottle as the room was lit from the emerald flames that appeared in his fireplace. The dark haired witch clambered out, dusting herself off as she did so. She smiled at the sight of her love but her face dropped slightly as she saw his stone expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything alright, Sev?&rdquo; she asked as she walked towards him. Her eyes darted to the bottle that was empty next to him and it she realised it wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he said casually, nursing his drink.</p><p>Lyra hoped Severus would continue the conversation but he didn&rsquo;t seem interested. She felt nervous but sat down and tried to engage with him normally. &ldquo;I was hoping you were going to come by earlier,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only just finished my paper. I&rsquo;ve owled it off along with Silvanus&rsquo; so we&rsquo;ll see how everything goes.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t respond, he just continued to stare at the same spot as he was before.</p><p>Lyra&rsquo;s hand reached out and touched his arm lightly, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong Sev?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This whole thing is a mistake,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She sighed deeply before saying, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re back onto this, are we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra, I can&rsquo;t be with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she stood up from the chair and returned to the fireplace.</p><p>&ldquo;Look how easy it is for you to walk away. Already have someone else in mind?&rdquo;</p><p>She stopped and laughed, &ldquo;So this is because you&rsquo;re insecure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious that you have a thing with someone else,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Gustav maybe?

Silence hung heavy between them for a few moments.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;But Lyra, tell me, on the slightest possibility that the Dark Lord doesn&rsquo;t return would you go against your family to be with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to deny myself a chance at happiness. I know, it&rsquo;s selfish but I haven&rsquo;t felt this way about anyone before.&rdquo; He looked over to her as she reached out once more, her hand settling for the arm of his chair this time. &ldquo;Severus, I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>He gave her a sad smile and whispered, &ldquo;I love you too, Lyra.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can make this work,&rdquo; she said, returning his smile.</p><p>Despite the fact that his head was telling him that she was much too young and naive to know what she was getting into he found himself trusting her and her sweet words.</p><p>~</p><p>Morning came, a dull green light pouring in from the windows in Severus&rsquo; quarters. The wizard awoke with Lyra sleeping soundly in his arms. He glanced over to the clock on the wall and noticed that it was half past seven. He sighed slightly, knowing that the weekend was now over and he would have to spend his day teaching ungrateful children rather than spend the day with his love.</p><p>The sigh was enough to stir Lyra from her sleep. Her eyes remained closed and instead she wiggled back into his embrace.</p><p>&ldquo;We should get up,&rdquo; he said, noticing that Lyra&rsquo;s pattern of breathing had changed.</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re so warm,&rdquo; she moaned.</p><p>He hummed slightly, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s time to get up, we&rsquo;ve got classes in an hour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we just call in sick?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;d definitely keep our relationship under wraps.&rdquo;</p><p>She giggled slightly before yawning, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m so tired.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should&rsquo;ve thought that before keeping us up all night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You enjoyed it though,&rdquo; she said, rolling over and kissing him on the lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I fail to see you moving to leave the warmth of our bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our bed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your bed,&rdquo; she corrected herself.</p><p>&ldquo;It is rather difficult to leave.&rdquo;</p><p>A tongue darted out between her lips and her eyes were ignited with desire.</p><p>&ldquo;Now we certainly don&rsquo;t have time for that,&rdquo; Severus said, a smirk appearing on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo; she asked, her hand trailing down his chest and feeling his half hard member. Her hands wrapped around it slightly, loosely playing with it in her hand. Severus&rsquo; eyes had a menacing look, as if to say &lsquo;don&rsquo;t test me&rsquo; but all that did was spur her on.</p><p>Lyra slid under the covers and soon enough, Severus could feel Lyra&rsquo;s tongue trailing the length of his member. He closed his eyes tightly as he felt the tip of his cock become engulfed by the warmth of her mouth. Her tongue swirled around before she took him deeper inside.</p><p>She worked slowly and sensually, her hand wrapped around the base of his cock, stroking upwards into her mouth as she sucked and teased the tip.</p><p>Once he was fully erect, Lyra pushed his hips back causing him to lie flat on his back and position herself between his legs. Severus pushed the covers back, wanting to watch the witch as she sucked his dick.</p><p>She had a playful look in her eyes as she continued her blowjob. Every so often she would look up at him and catch his eyes, smiling at him as she rubbed the length of his cock before taking him back into her mouth.</p><p>It was truly a sight to behold.</p><p>Her eyes drifted shut as she focused on his cock and his pleasure. Her hand wrapped around the base of his cock tightly and she began to bob her head up and down the shaft of his cock. He groaned as she looked up at him with his whole length of his cock was in her mouth, the end hitting her throat.</p><p>She continued to move her mouth up and down, her pace quickening to a point before becoming more steady. Severus could feel his orgasm coming, his hips beginning to strain off the bed and into her mouth. Her hands held him down firmly as she continued to suck him off and he came soon after.</p><p>Lyra swallowed and crawled back up to lie next to her lover, pulling the sheets back up over them. She snuggled into him and Severus&rsquo; hand drew circles on her back. His eyes glanced up at the clock and he closed his eyes, wishing it would slow down.</p><p>&ldquo;Neither of us will have time for breakfast,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;I just had breakfast,&rdquo; she said, smiling cheekily at the man.</p><p>&ldquo;Merlin,&rdquo; he breathed.</p><p>She lay kisses on his chest, then on his cheek. With a final peck on his lips, Lyra sat up in bed and began to get dressed.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start our lessons tonight,&rdquo; he said as Lyra finished pulling on her robe. &ldquo;After dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded, &ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;ll see you then.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra left his quarters through his fireplace with an unnerving feeling in the pit of her stomach. She showered quickly before her classes started, hoping that the water would wash her nerves away but they seemed to stick.</p><p>She looked at herself in the mirror and breathed slowly, employing the occlumency techniques she had learnt all those years ago.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>Let your mind go blank.</p><p>Imagine your mind is a stream and your thoughts are debris that gently passes by.</p><p>Do not dwell on these thoughts.</p><p>Let go of your emotions.</p><p>Do not allow yourself to be consumed by your feelings.</p><p>With each breath let go of your feelings until there is nothing.</p><p>Lyra felt an overwhelming sense of calm fill her as she recalled Severus&rsquo; words. Her heart and mind were still but that calm and quiet was fleeting. She felt it leave as she heard the bustle of footsteps entering her classroom.</p><p>Quickly, she used her wand to make herself presentable before rushing down the stairs to address the second years.</p><p>Through the day, Lyra practiced her occlumency techniques, separating herself from any emotion she felt. Whether or not it would be effective would be difficult to determine, she&rsquo;d have to depend on Severus to be a witness to that.</p><p>Lyra knew she was no longer the girl she once was. As a teenager she was cunning and ambitious, motivated to pursue the Dark Arts and manipulate those around her but now as an adult she had become sensitive and vulnerable with the need to help others. She had broken down all the walls she had put up to allow herself to connect better with people and now she would have to put it all back up again. It was possible but it would be difficult, particularly when the person testing her resolve would be Severus.</p><p>That time came quickly. Her day had slipped away and after dinner Lyra found herself returning to Severus&rsquo; quarters. She made sure that before she even entered her own fireplace that her mind was ready and on guard.</p><p>&ldquo;Legilimens,&rdquo; she heard from a far corner of the room.</p><p>Lyra blocked the intrusion with ease, confidently walking towards Severus&rsquo; shadowy figure. Her heart leapt slightly as she felt herself being drawn to him and Severus flicked through memories of them together. From her blow job that morning, to their shared night at his old home. He kept digging deeper and deeper, revealing her feelings towards him, the way her heart ached for him. Lyra tried to quell her thoughts and emotions but it was relentless.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; she said, closing her eyes and shutting their connection.</p><p>&ldquo;Not good enough, Lyra,&rdquo; he taunted.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she opened her eyes looking into his once more. His black orbs seeming to gaze deep into her soul.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you expect to defend yourself after being tortured, Lyra?&rdquo; his voice was threatening, attempting to stir up emotions, trying to get her to fail.</p><p>&ldquo;Go again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Legilimens.&rdquo;</p><p>His spell bounced off instantly, Lyra maintaining her nerve. She stared him down, empty of emotion, empty of her thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s have a conversation and see how you fair. Sit.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra took a seat in the armchair, angling it to face the other. She remained calm and composed as Severus did the same. He began to question her, asking her about her family and her relationship with them. Emotions came as quickly as the left, Lyra didn&rsquo;t dwell on what he was stirring, merely acknowledging each feeling as it passed. Her defense did not falter under the interrogation.</p><p>They spoke for an hour with Severus testing her intermittently through the conversation. Occasionally, Lyra would throw in a casual lie to see if it gathered any attention. They seemed to slip through unnoticed.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done well.&rdquo;</p><p>She sighed, exhausted from keeping it up for so long, slumping into her chair and her eyes drifting shut.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be easy, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eventually it&rsquo;ll be second nature to you and you&rsquo;ll want to keep it up all the time.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes were kept tightly shut and she nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Come Lyra,&rdquo; he said. When she opened her eyes he was standing over her, his arm outstretched. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you to bed.&rdquo;</p>",
