No, not his dad. His dad died in a crash. His mentor, Mr. Stark. He can&rsquo;t breath he can&rsquo;t breath he can&rsquo;t breath. Why can&rsquo;t he breath?What even happened? Why was he on the ground, why was he hurting? Where is Mr. Stark? Oh The fall, the fire, the building. The crushing weight on his back. Oh, that&rsquo;s why he can&rsquo;t breath. The building on him, his lungs filled with smoke, his vision blurring with tears he refused to let fall, because he will be saved. Mr. Stark is coming to save him, everything will be okay. But seconds turned to minutes, which turned to hours, or what felt like so. Every passing minute Peter lost his hope piece by piece. Where is Mr. Stark?Why isn&rsquo;t he coming to save him?</p><p>Choking sobs back as he tried to think of anything but the man, but he couldn&rsquo;t. Why?</p><p>Slowly, he lost himself.

If he had saved someone..</p><p>Because really, he deserved this, right?&nbsp;</p><p>Because if even Mr. Stark wasn&rsquo;t coming for him, then he must be a monster.</p><p>Peter relied on him too much, didn&rsquo;t he? He tends to do that a lot, huh? Maybe he scared him away. Maybe&hellip; Maybe.</p><p>With a final rattling breath, Peter stilled. The final tear falling from his open lash, and streaking his cheek.

Who&rsquo;s kid is laying dead in the rubble of the fire?</p><p>Tony Stark pushed his way through the crowd to get to the scene.

        "body": "<h1>@ marvel cinematic universe: step ya pussy up honey</h1><p>Comics have been a staple in modern culture because of how long they\u2019ve represented us, the readers. When the main character feels that immense pain of losing a loved one? We feel that. When the main character finally gets their guy/girl/person? We relate to that too, eyeing our significant others. When a character faces an important and difficult challenge and only perseveres through pure will? We get it, most of us go to school! The point I\u2019m trying to make is, comics represent us through their colorful art, excellent writing, and understandable plot lines. The same cannot be said for movie adaptations. When a movie is based of a book, comic, or any other work of literature, some stuff is bound to be cut out. Movies are so desperate to get to the cool action scenes, or the heartfelt romance scenes that they completely skim over what made the readers love that piece of literature in the first place. </p><p>Which is why I\u2019m begging the MCU to get their shit together. For years, the MCU has dipped in the Marvel Comics, taken out somewhat interesting plot lines and characters they believe will sell, and thrown the rest out, and I am not a fan. This \u201cpick and discard\u201d method is truly shown through two main topics: ethnicity and the lgbtq+ community (I know there are a ton of topics that the MCU likes to skim over. I\u2019m aware of them, and I don\u2019t like that they\u2019re left behind the curtains. I want to inform y\u2019all of some problems I see in the MCU, and there are so many that I don\u2019t think one chapter will do it service.). So let\u2019s get this shit show started! </p><p>Ethnicity:</p><p>This is probably the most noticeable problem in the MCU. Everyone in the movies are predominantly Caucasian/European/of European descent. Go watch three marvel movies right now, and count how many people of color you see. I\u2019ll be you my life savings of thirty-seven dollars and ninety-two cents that the number doesn\u2019t exceed ten. That is ridiculous. We, as fans, go to these movies every few years to see people like us do things we could never do in a relatable, PG-13 way. But they aren\u2019t like us. Well, not like colored people, I should say. We don\u2019t see enough of brown or black-skinned characters being bad bitches. We don\u2019t see enough brown or black-skinned characters getting the girl, the guy or the person of their affections. We don\u2019t see enough brown or black-skinned characters succeeding, failing, suffering, thriving or living. And that\u2019s a real problem. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cUhhhh, actually,\u201d the privileged white fanboys begin, \u201cColored people do have representation. You guys have War Machine, and uh, and Falcon, and Black Panther! You have Black Panther! And Heimdall.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s four people,\u201d us poc fans say tiredly. \u201cFour out of how many white characters in the MCU?\u201d</p><p>Our question throws them off. \u201cWell uh, you also have Luis from Ant-Man! He\u2019s Hispanic! And, and there\u2019s that one chick from Age of Ultron! She was Asian, right? Right?\u201d</p><p>We sigh. \u201cThe fact that you can\u2019t even remember Helen\u2019s name proves our point for us. The MCU is not engineered towards people of color.\u201d</p><p>The fanboys pale, spluttering. \u201cYou pry for representation, but are ungrateful with what you have? Fam and disgusting. Shut up and go whine somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Us poc fans, not even wanting to deal with that mess, sigh once more and sit silently, wishing for change and wondering when things aren\u2019t going to be like this.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>That whole exchange I just wrote was scripted, but based off of real events. There are a lot of things I despise about the way colored characters are handled, but here are the final cherries on top:</p><p>\u2022The Black Best Friend: A BBF, by my definition, is a black character that only exists to support a white character. Go watch the second Iron Man movie, the second Captain America movie, and the second Thor movie. Rhodey, Sam and Heimdall are all casted into the BBF role. Rhodey is only there to support Tony, Sam is only there to support Steve, and Heimdall is only there to support Thor. Rhodey, Sam and Heimdall barely branch outside of their supporting roles, which sucks because they\u2019re interesting characters with amazing actors. They are the core definition of a BBF, and I hate that because that\u2019s all they are in the MCU. Go watch any movie these three are in and give me a moment that doesn\u2019t revolve around their white counterpart. Seriously, go find one. I want to see if one actually exists. Bonus points if they join the white hero\u2019s cause in the middle/towards the end if the movie (Yes, I\u2019m aware that they all do that. I just wanted to give you all a freebie. Good luck for anyone who actually tries though.).</p><p>\u2022Kill/Harm Your Colored Characters: Heimdall, stabbed to death in the first five minutes of Infinity War. Sam Wilson, turned to dust at the end of Infinity War. T\u2019Challa Udaku, thrown off a waterfall whilst bleeding out and turned to dust at the end of Infinity War. Shuri Udaku, turned to dust offscreen in Infinity War. James \u201cRhodey\u201d Rhodes, had legs replaced with prosthetics after falling from the sky in Captain America:Civil War. Helen Cho, found bleeding to death in her lab in Avengers:Age of Ultron. These are some of the casualties of Marvel not knowing how to handle colored characters. Sure, most of these were/will be fixed, but the point still stands. People will try and argue that white characters have also suffered, and I agree, everyone\u2019s gotten the short stick once or twice, but their suffering should not overtake the suffering of colored characters. The worst part about the list at the start of this paragraph? There are so many more that I haven\u2019t listed that can go on that list.</p><p>\u2022Erasing Accomplishments of Colored Characters: Before I start this, let it be said: I love Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, and Stephen Strange. Just because I\u2019m talking about them in this chapter does not mean I do not appreciate their accomplishments as well. Shuri Udaku and Helen Cho are some of the smartest women-and people- in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel Comics, so why are their accomplishments overshadowed by their white counterparts? Shuri saved a man thousands in medical bills and physical therapy, yet I see no one talking about this like it never happened? I am very well aware of how Shuri has been presented as a meme-loving teen in the MCU but still. She\u2019s not the head of Wakanda\u2019s technological department for nothing. Y\u2019all stay sleeping on Shuri changing countless lives with her tech-including Bucky\u2019s-but all y\u2019all seem to stay awake for is Stephen dying and then telling someone else how to save his life. What? Helen made a machine able to genetically clone tissues to help people heal faster, but the only thing y\u2019all seem to remember from Age of Ultron is how smart Bruce and Tony are for building Ultron, who used Helen\u2019s machine to make clones of themself (something they couldn\u2019t do before). Are you serious? Did we not watch the same movies? Shuri and Helen have both done nothing but advance the S.T.E.M. world with their inventions, but all y\u2019all seem to do is ignore them and their successes in favor of talking about white men. Wow.</p><p>\u2022Shipping: Nothing pisses me off more then how shipping is handled in the MCU fandom. Stucky? Cool! Stony? Awesome! Spideypool? Iconic! Samsteve, Iron Husbands, or Interwebs? Uh, they\u2019re friends? Why would you ship them. That\u2019s so gross! Do. You. See. The. Problem. Ships featuring a colored individual and a white person are either deemed nasty  demoted to \u201crare-pair\u201d status because someone that isn\u2019t white is in the ship. Some of y\u2019all will sooner ship incest (Thorki) or pedophilia (Starker) than harmless ships like Thorkyrie or Spideychelle, who both involve colored characters. And this isn\u2019t just for ships with two people. This goes for ships with three people as well. Y\u2019all have no problem shipping Stuckony, or Dr. Pepperony, but the second someone says: \u201cOh, I like Samstevebucky or Pepper x Tony x Rhodey,\u201d people start to ignore the ship or say: \u201cThat\u2019s too many people!\u201d Just say you\u2019re racist and move along. </p><p>LGBTQ+ Community: </p><p>There is no greater feeling than seeing yourself in modern media in a way that is fulfilling and not offensively. This is especially the case for those of us who are apart of the lgbtq+ community. If we\u2019re not being told we\u2019re \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201csinful\u201d for liking who we like or identifying as who we identify, we\u2019re being slandered and harrassed. Which is why seeing super-powered individuals that are just like us being handled well by writers and not rendered to useless side-characters is so good. No, it\u2019s better than good. It\u2019s marvelous. Everytime I see Lady Loki, America Chavez, Bobby Drake, Karolina Dean, Teddy Altman, Billy Kaplan, or any of the numerous lgbtq+ characters in Marvel Comics, I smile, because Marvel Comics gets it. They understand our need for representation, and I am forever grateful for their strive to include us. That being said, the Marvel Cinematic Universe needs to step up. There are over two hundred canonically lgbtq+ that are in the marvel canon, and only a few of them have made it on the MCU\u2019s character roster. And that\u2019s not saying much, considering not a one of these characters were shown/coded to be gay, lesbian, bi, trans, genderfluid, nonbinary, et cera. Which makes one start to wonder: why? Why go through the trouble of making so many lgbtq+ characters if the MCU is adamant on making sure they aren\u2019t shown on screen? To which I can only answer: Marvel Studios wants money. When you have a franchise as successful as Marvel, you start to shift your focus on the cash and the fans that gave you that cash. You start to find patterns. Oh, these fans liked these over-dramatic fight scenes? Let\u2019s dedicate two-thirds of our movie to that and forget about concise plot! Oh, these fans like this female actress because she\u2019s hot and has a subpar romance with our main man? Let\u2019s give her some more roles and not expand her character! Oh, the straight cis fans like this straight cis character? Let\u2019s deny their identity because this is what the fans want!

            "comment": "<p><h1>@ marvel cinematic universe: step ya pussy up honey</h1><p>Comics have been a staple in modern culture because of how long they\u2019ve represented us, the readers. When the main character feels that immense pain of losing a loved one? We feel that. When the main character finally gets their guy/girl/person? We relate to that too, eyeing our significant others. When a character faces an important and difficult challenge and only perseveres through pure will? We get it, most of us go to school! The point I\u2019m trying to make is, comics represent us through their colorful art, excellent writing, and understandable plot lines. The same cannot be said for movie adaptations. When a movie is based of a book, comic, or any other work of literature, some stuff is bound to be cut out. Movies are so desperate to get to the cool action scenes, or the heartfelt romance scenes that they completely skim over what made the readers love that piece of literature in the first place. </p><p>Which is why I\u2019m begging the MCU to get their shit together. For years, the MCU has dipped in the Marvel Comics, taken out somewhat interesting plot lines and characters they believe will sell, and thrown the rest out, and I am not a fan. This \u201cpick and discard\u201d method is truly shown through two main topics: ethnicity and the lgbtq+ community (I know there are a ton of topics that the MCU likes to skim over. I\u2019m aware of them, and I don\u2019t like that they\u2019re left behind the curtains. I want to inform y\u2019all of some problems I see in the MCU, and there are so many that I don\u2019t think one chapter will do it service.). So let\u2019s get this shit show started! </p><p>Ethnicity:</p><p>This is probably the most noticeable problem in the MCU. Everyone in the movies are predominantly Caucasian/European/of European descent. Go watch three marvel movies right now, and count how many people of color you see. I\u2019ll be you my life savings of thirty-seven dollars and ninety-two cents that the number doesn\u2019t exceed ten. That is ridiculous. We, as fans, go to these movies every few years to see people like us do things we could never do in a relatable, PG-13 way. But they aren\u2019t like us. Well, not like colored people, I should say. We don\u2019t see enough of brown or black-skinned characters being bad bitches. We don\u2019t see enough brown or black-skinned characters getting the girl, the guy or the person of their affections. We don\u2019t see enough brown or black-skinned characters succeeding, failing, suffering, thriving or living. And that\u2019s a real problem. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cUhhhh, actually,\u201d the privileged white fanboys begin, \u201cColored people do have representation. You guys have War Machine, and uh, and Falcon, and Black Panther! You have Black Panther! And Heimdall.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s four people,\u201d us poc fans say tiredly. \u201cFour out of how many white characters in the MCU?\u201d</p><p>Our question throws them off. \u201cWell uh, you also have Luis from Ant-Man! He\u2019s Hispanic! And, and there\u2019s that one chick from Age of Ultron! She was Asian, right? Right?\u201d</p><p>We sigh. \u201cThe fact that you can\u2019t even remember Helen\u2019s name proves our point for us. The MCU is not engineered towards people of color.\u201d</p><p>The fanboys pale, spluttering. \u201cYou pry for representation, but are ungrateful with what you have? Fam and disgusting. Shut up and go whine somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Us poc fans, not even wanting to deal with that mess, sigh once more and sit silently, wishing for change and wondering when things aren\u2019t going to be like this.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>That whole exchange I just wrote was scripted, but based off of real events. There are a lot of things I despise about the way colored characters are handled, but here are the final cherries on top:</p><p>\u2022The Black Best Friend: A BBF, by my definition, is a black character that only exists to support a white character. Go watch the second Iron Man movie, the second Captain America movie, and the second Thor movie. Rhodey, Sam and Heimdall are all casted into the BBF role. Rhodey is only there to support Tony, Sam is only there to support Steve, and Heimdall is only there to support Thor. Rhodey, Sam and Heimdall barely branch outside of their supporting roles, which sucks because they\u2019re interesting characters with amazing actors. They are the core definition of a BBF, and I hate that because that\u2019s all they are in the MCU. Go watch any movie these three are in and give me a moment that doesn\u2019t revolve around their white counterpart. Seriously, go find one. I want to see if one actually exists. Bonus points if they join the white hero\u2019s cause in the middle/towards the end if the movie (Yes, I\u2019m aware that they all do that. I just wanted to give you all a freebie. Good luck for anyone who actually tries though.).</p><p>\u2022Kill/Harm Your Colored Characters: Heimdall, stabbed to death in the first five minutes of Infinity War. Sam Wilson, turned to dust at the end of Infinity War. T\u2019Challa Udaku, thrown off a waterfall whilst bleeding out and turned to dust at the end of Infinity War. Shuri Udaku, turned to dust offscreen in Infinity War. James \u201cRhodey\u201d Rhodes, had legs replaced with prosthetics after falling from the sky in Captain America:Civil War. Helen Cho, found bleeding to death in her lab in Avengers:Age of Ultron. These are some of the casualties of Marvel not knowing how to handle colored characters. Sure, most of these were/will be fixed, but the point still stands. People will try and argue that white characters have also suffered, and I agree, everyone\u2019s gotten the short stick once or twice, but their suffering should not overtake the suffering of colored characters. The worst part about the list at the start of this paragraph? There are so many more that I haven\u2019t listed that can go on that list.</p><p>\u2022Erasing Accomplishments of Colored Characters: Before I start this, let it be said: I love Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, and Stephen Strange. Just because I\u2019m talking about them in this chapter does not mean I do not appreciate their accomplishments as well. Shuri Udaku and Helen Cho are some of the smartest women-and people- in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel Comics, so why are their accomplishments overshadowed by their white counterparts? Shuri saved a man thousands in medical bills and physical therapy, yet I see no one talking about this like it never happened? I am very well aware of how Shuri has been presented as a meme-loving teen in the MCU but still. She\u2019s not the head of Wakanda\u2019s technological department for nothing. Y\u2019all stay sleeping on Shuri changing countless lives with her tech-including Bucky\u2019s-but all y\u2019all seem to stay awake for is Stephen dying and then telling someone else how to save his life. What? Helen made a machine able to genetically clone tissues to help people heal faster, but the only thing y\u2019all seem to remember from Age of Ultron is how smart Bruce and Tony are for building Ultron, who used Helen\u2019s machine to make clones of themself (something they couldn\u2019t do before). Are you serious? Did we not watch the same movies? Shuri and Helen have both done nothing but advance the S.T.E.M. world with their inventions, but all y\u2019all seem to do is ignore them and their successes in favor of talking about white men. Wow.</p><p>\u2022Shipping: Nothing pisses me off more then how shipping is handled in the MCU fandom. Stucky? Cool! Stony? Awesome! Spideypool? Iconic! Samsteve, Iron Husbands, or Interwebs? Uh, they\u2019re friends? Why would you ship them. That\u2019s so gross! Do. You. See. The. Problem. Ships featuring a colored individual and a white person are either deemed nasty  demoted to \u201crare-pair\u201d status because someone that isn\u2019t white is in the ship. Some of y\u2019all will sooner ship incest (Thorki) or pedophilia (Starker) than harmless ships like Thorkyrie or Spideychelle, who both involve colored characters. And this isn\u2019t just for ships with two people. This goes for ships with three people as well. Y\u2019all have no problem shipping Stuckony, or Dr. Pepperony, but the second someone says: \u201cOh, I like Samstevebucky or Pepper x Tony x Rhodey,\u201d people start to ignore the ship or say: \u201cThat\u2019s too many people!\u201d Just say you\u2019re racist and move along. </p><p>LGBTQ+ Community: </p><p>There is no greater feeling than seeing yourself in modern media in a way that is fulfilling and not offensively. This is especially the case for those of us who are apart of the lgbtq+ community. If we\u2019re not being told we\u2019re \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201csinful\u201d for liking who we like or identifying as who we identify, we\u2019re being slandered and harrassed. Which is why seeing super-powered individuals that are just like us being handled well by writers and not rendered to useless side-characters is so good. No, it\u2019s better than good. It\u2019s marvelous. Everytime I see Lady Loki, America Chavez, Bobby Drake, Karolina Dean, Teddy Altman, Billy Kaplan, or any of the numerous lgbtq+ characters in Marvel Comics, I smile, because Marvel Comics gets it. They understand our need for representation, and I am forever grateful for their strive to include us. That being said, the Marvel Cinematic Universe needs to step up. There are over two hundred canonically lgbtq+ that are in the marvel canon, and only a few of them have made it on the MCU\u2019s character roster. And that\u2019s not saying much, considering not a one of these characters were shown/coded to be gay, lesbian, bi, trans, genderfluid, nonbinary, et cera. Which makes one start to wonder: why? Why go through the trouble of making so many lgbtq+ characters if the MCU is adamant on making sure they aren\u2019t shown on screen? To which I can only answer: Marvel Studios wants money. When you have a franchise as successful as Marvel, you start to shift your focus on the cash and the fans that gave you that cash. You start to find patterns. Oh, these fans liked these over-dramatic fight scenes? Let\u2019s dedicate two-thirds of our movie to that and forget about concise plot! Oh, these fans like this female actress because she\u2019s hot and has a subpar romance with our main man? Let\u2019s give her some more roles and not expand her character! Oh, the straight cis fans like this straight cis character? Let\u2019s deny their identity because this is what the fans want! No, it\u2019s what you\u2019ve heard from the most vocal opinions of characters. </p><p>White, straight, cis and Christian parents watch these movies with their kids, and lemme tell you, if a character even looked at a character of the same gender for more than a reasonable time there\u2019d be an uproar. And Marvel Studios doesn\u2019t want an uproar (unless it\u2019s positive, of course). They want money.

If we\u2019re not being told we\u2019re \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201csinful\u201d for liking who we like or identifying as who we identify, we\u2019re being slandered and harrassed. Which is why seeing super-powered individuals that are just like us being handled well by writers and not rendered to useless side-characters is so good. No, it\u2019s better than good. It\u2019s marvelous. Everytime I see Lady Loki, America Chavez, Bobby Drake, Karolina Dean, Teddy Altman, Billy Kaplan, or any of the numerous lgbtq+ characters in Marvel Comics, I smile, because Marvel Comics gets it. They understand our need for representation, and I am forever grateful for their strive to include us. That being said, the Marvel Cinematic Universe needs to step up. There are over two hundred canonically lgbtq+ that are in the marvel canon, and only a few of them have made it on the MCU\u2019s character roster. And that\u2019s not saying much, considering not a one of these characters were shown/coded to be gay, lesbian, bi, trans, genderfluid, nonbinary, et cera. Which makes one start to wonder: why? Why go through the trouble of making so many lgbtq+ characters if the MCU is adamant on making sure they aren\u2019t shown on screen? To which I can only answer: Marvel Studios wants money. When you have a franchise as successful as Marvel, you start to shift your focus on the cash and the fans that gave you that cash. You start to find patterns. Oh, these fans liked these over-dramatic fight scenes? Let\u2019s dedicate two-thirds of our movie to that and forget about concise plot! Oh, these fans like this female actress because she\u2019s hot and has a subpar romance with our main man? Let\u2019s give her some more roles and not expand her character! Oh, the straight cis fans like this straight cis character? Let\u2019s deny their identity because this is what the fans want! No, it\u2019s what you\u2019ve heard from the most vocal opinions of characters. </p><p>White, straight, cis and Christian parents watch these movies with their kids, and lemme tell you, if a character even looked at a character of the same gender for more than a reasonable time there\u2019d be an uproar. And Marvel Studios doesn\u2019t want an uproar (unless it\u2019s positive, of course). They want money. So they\u2019re perfectly fine with expunging the identities of millions for the sake of that coin. And it\u2019s ridiculous. And that\u2019s not to say that everyone at Marvel Studios is selfish. I\u2019m sure some people there get it, and want to do more. Stan did, bless his soul. But there needs to be a greater effort. Making movies built towards underrepresented crowds is always a guarantee for success. Don\u2019t believe me? Go watch Love, Simon, or Black Panther, or any movie that has made bank and a universal impact on those it was trying to portray. This is why people cling to the fandom side of the MCU, where people will understand your pain of not seeing your lgbtq+ fave on screen and recommend fanfiction or fanart of that character that the MCU chooses to believe does not exist. Maybe one day Marvel Studios will get it. Maybe one day, we\u2019ll be able to walk out of a movie theater, beaming, because two boys kissed on screen. But until then, I\u2019m not holding my breath. I\u2019m reading the comics.</p><p>To make a long story short, the MCU doesn\u2019t know what diversity and representation are and are thus incapable of depicting them on screen. My advice?

                "content": "<p><h1>@ marvel cinematic universe: step ya pussy up honey</h1><p>Comics have been a staple in modern culture because of how long they&rsquo;ve represented us, the readers. When the main character feels that immense pain of losing a loved one? We feel that. When the main character finally gets their guy/girl/person? We relate to that too, eyeing our significant others. When a character faces an important and difficult challenge and only perseveres through pure will? We get it, most of us go to school! The point I&rsquo;m trying to make is, comics represent us through their colorful art, excellent writing, and understandable plot lines. The same cannot be said for movie adaptations. When a movie is based of a book, comic, or any other work of literature, some stuff is bound to be cut out. Movies are so desperate to get to the cool action scenes, or the heartfelt romance scenes that they completely skim over what made the readers love that piece of literature in the first place. </p><p>Which is why I&rsquo;m begging the MCU to get their shit together. For years, the MCU has dipped in the Marvel Comics, taken out somewhat interesting plot lines and characters they believe will sell, and thrown the rest out, and I am not a fan. This &ldquo;pick and discard&rdquo; method is truly shown through two main topics: ethnicity and the lgbtq+ community (I know there are a ton of topics that the MCU likes to skim over. I&rsquo;m aware of them, and I don&rsquo;t like that they&rsquo;re left behind the curtains. I want to inform y&rsquo;all of some problems I see in the MCU, and there are so many that I don&rsquo;t think one chapter will do it service.). So let&rsquo;s get this shit show started! </p><p>Ethnicity:</p><p>This is probably the most noticeable problem in the MCU. Everyone in the movies are predominantly Caucasian/European/of European descent. Go watch three marvel movies right now, and count how many people of color you see. I&rsquo;ll be you my life savings of thirty-seven dollars and ninety-two cents that the number doesn&rsquo;t exceed ten. That is ridiculous. We, as fans, go to these movies every few years to see people like us do things we could never do in a relatable, PG-13 way. But they aren&rsquo;t like us. Well, not like colored people, I should say. We don&rsquo;t see enough of brown or black-skinned characters being bad bitches. We don&rsquo;t see enough brown or black-skinned characters getting the girl, the guy or the person of their affections. We don&rsquo;t see enough brown or black-skinned characters succeeding, failing, suffering, thriving or living. And that&rsquo;s a real problem. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhhhh, actually,&rdquo; the privileged white fanboys begin, &ldquo;Colored people do have representation. You guys have War Machine, and uh, and Falcon, and Black Panther! You have Black Panther! And Heimdall.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s four people,&rdquo; us poc fans say tiredly. &ldquo;Four out of how many white characters in the MCU?&rdquo;</p><p>Our question throws them off. &ldquo;Well uh, you also have Luis from Ant-Man! He&rsquo;s Hispanic! And, and there&rsquo;s that one chick from Age of Ultron! She was Asian, right? Right?&rdquo;</p><p>We sigh. &ldquo;The fact that you can&rsquo;t even remember Helen&rsquo;s name proves our point for us. The MCU is not engineered towards people of color.&rdquo;</p><p>The fanboys pale, spluttering. &ldquo;You pry for representation, but are ungrateful with what you have? Fam and disgusting. Shut up and go whine somewhere else.&rdquo;</p><p>Us poc fans, not even wanting to deal with that mess, sigh once more and sit silently, wishing for change and wondering when things aren&rsquo;t going to be like this.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>That whole exchange I just wrote was scripted, but based off of real events. There are a lot of things I despise about the way colored characters are handled, but here are the final cherries on top:</p><p>&bull;The Black Best Friend: A BBF, by my definition, is a black character that only exists to support a white character. Go watch the second Iron Man movie, the second Captain America movie, and the second Thor movie. Rhodey, Sam and Heimdall are all casted into the BBF role. Rhodey is only there to support Tony, Sam is only there to support Steve, and Heimdall is only there to support Thor. Rhodey, Sam and Heimdall barely branch outside of their supporting roles, which sucks because they&rsquo;re interesting characters with amazing actors. They are the core definition of a BBF, and I hate that because that&rsquo;s all they are in the MCU. Go watch any movie these three are in and give me a moment that doesn&rsquo;t revolve around their white counterpart. Seriously, go find one. I want to see if one actually exists. Bonus points if they join the white hero&rsquo;s cause in the middle/towards the end if the movie (Yes, I&rsquo;m aware that they all do that. I just wanted to give you all a freebie. Good luck for anyone who actually tries though.).</p><p>&bull;Kill/Harm Your Colored Characters: Heimdall, stabbed to death in the first five minutes of Infinity War. Sam Wilson, turned to dust at the end of Infinity War. T&rsquo;Challa Udaku, thrown off a waterfall whilst bleeding out and turned to dust at the end of Infinity War. Shuri Udaku, turned to dust offscreen in Infinity War. James &ldquo;Rhodey&rdquo; Rhodes, had legs replaced with prosthetics after falling from the sky in Captain America:Civil War. Helen Cho, found bleeding to death in her lab in Avengers:Age of Ultron. These are some of the casualties of Marvel not knowing how to handle colored characters. Sure, most of these were/will be fixed, but the point still stands. People will try and argue that white characters have also suffered, and I agree, everyone&rsquo;s gotten the short stick once or twice, but their suffering should not overtake the suffering of colored characters. The worst part about the list at the start of this paragraph? There are so many more that I haven&rsquo;t listed that can go on that list.</p><p>&bull;Erasing Accomplishments of Colored Characters: Before I start this, let it be said: I love Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, and Stephen Strange. Just because I&rsquo;m talking about them in this chapter does not mean I do not appreciate their accomplishments as well. Shuri Udaku and Helen Cho are some of the smartest women-and people- in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel Comics, so why are their accomplishments overshadowed by their white counterparts? Shuri saved a man thousands in medical bills and physical therapy, yet I see no one talking about this like it never happened? I am very well aware of how Shuri has been presented as a meme-loving teen in the MCU but still. She&rsquo;s not the head of Wakanda&rsquo;s technological department for nothing. Y&rsquo;all stay sleeping on Shuri changing countless lives with her tech-including Bucky&rsquo;s-but all y&rsquo;all seem to stay awake for is Stephen dying and then telling someone else how to save his life. What? Helen made a machine able to genetically clone tissues to help people heal faster, but the only thing y&rsquo;all seem to remember from Age of Ultron is how smart Bruce and Tony are for building Ultron, who used Helen&rsquo;s machine to make clones of themself (something they couldn&rsquo;t do before). Are you serious? Did we not watch the same movies? Shuri and Helen have both done nothing but advance the S.T.E.M. world with their inventions, but all y&rsquo;all seem to do is ignore them and their successes in favor of talking about white men. Wow.</p><p>&bull;Shipping: Nothing pisses me off more then how shipping is handled in the MCU fandom. Stucky? Cool! Stony? Awesome! Spideypool? Iconic! Samsteve, Iron Husbands, or Interwebs? Uh, they&rsquo;re friends? Why would you ship them. That&rsquo;s so gross! Do. You. See. The. Problem. Ships featuring a colored individual and a white person are either deemed nasty  demoted to &ldquo;rare-pair&rdquo; status because someone that isn&rsquo;t white is in the ship. Some of y&rsquo;all will sooner ship incest (Thorki) or pedophilia (Starker) than harmless ships like Thorkyrie or Spideychelle, who both involve colored characters. And this isn&rsquo;t just for ships with two people. This goes for ships with three people as well. Y&rsquo;all have no problem shipping Stuckony, or Dr. Pepperony, but the second someone says: &ldquo;Oh, I like Samstevebucky or Pepper x Tony x Rhodey,&rdquo; people start to ignore the ship or say: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too many people!&rdquo; Just say you&rsquo;re racist and move along. </p><p>LGBTQ+ Community: </p><p>There is no greater feeling than seeing yourself in modern media in a way that is fulfilling and not offensively. This is especially the case for those of us who are apart of the lgbtq+ community. If we&rsquo;re not being told we&rsquo;re &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; or &ldquo;sinful&rdquo; for liking who we like or identifying as who we identify, we&rsquo;re being slandered and harrassed. Which is why seeing super-powered individuals that are just like us being handled well by writers and not rendered to useless side-characters is so good. No, it&rsquo;s better than good.
