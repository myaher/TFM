What do you mean roommate?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Winter Soldier gave Tony an odd look, \u201cDoes roommate mean something new now?\u201d he said, scowling. Not that Tony had seen him with any other expression, although sometimes it came with an extra helping of anger and/or annoyance. </p>\n\n<p>He was scowling when they first found him in the Hydra facility, he scowled when he signed the papers to officially join the Avengers Initiative, he scowled all they way through battles and clean up.<br/>\nAlthough, Shuri had texted Tony saying that he had smiled when they\u2019d finally undone his Hydra programming -  and T\u2019Challa had confirmed it, so it was good to know that he, in theory, <em>could</em> make any other expression that wasn&rsquo;t a scowl, but Tony had never seen it.</p>\n\n<p>Tony squinted at The Soldier, \u201cNo,\u201d he said carefully, the roommate vine playing on a loop in his head - Peter had been so disappointed when he\u2019d found out that Shuri had introduced him to vines, and the subsequent horror that was Gen Z humour, before he could. Tony offhandedly wondered if The Soldier knew what vines were, <em>technically</em>, he could be classed as a millennial.<br/>\nProbably not.<br/>\nHe looked over at The Soldier\u2019s whole, demeanor, the Murder Stance\u2122 (a sequel to the Murder Strut\u2122) in full force, topped off with the ever-present scowl (this time, with a flavour of impatience) and decided, that <em>no</em>, The Winter Soldier definitely didn&rsquo;t know what vines were.</p>\n\n<p>And now the Murder Stance\u2122 was the Murder Strut\u2122. Away from Tony - The Soldier had a surprisingly good ass - \u201cHey, hey! Manchurian Candidate, you never gave me an answer, you gonna move into the tower with the rest of us?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The Soldier, without turning around, yelled back, \u201cI told you, I have a roommate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony turned around and frowned at the rest of the team, \u201cWhen did he get a roommate?\u201d he muttered, not really expecting an answer.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHis roommate,\u201d growled Fury, from behind him, talking over Tony\u2019s squawk and his promises to \u2018cat-bell\u2019 him, \u201cis none of your business. Why are you all still in my conference room?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He huffed, \u201cYou gotta be paying him more if he has to have a roommate,\u201d he knew New York was expensive, but the guy was a <em>superhero</em>, and he probably had like, seven decades worth of backpay.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting paid as much as you are. Get out of my conference room.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t know how much I\u2019m getting paid,\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCheck your books, and <em>get out of my damn room,</em>\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOut.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony and the rest of the Avengers hightailed it out of there, not wanting to relive <em>that </em>particular day.</p><hr width=\"33%\"><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m home,\u201d Bucky called, as he entered their apartment, emptying his pockets of all his weapons into the basket near the door, feeling himself physically go from The Winter Soldier, ex-Hydra, ex-brainwashed, SHIELD agent and Avenger, to Bucky Barnes, sometimes drummer, sometimes mechanic, and boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>It was always so <em>liberating</em>, when he got home, free from surveillance, although, he wasn&rsquo;t naive, he was pretty sure SHIELD knew he lived here. But that better be the extent of it. He\u2019d made sure that the surveillance and oversight clause in his Avengers papers was very clear.<br/>\nMatt had helped.<br/>\nHe\u2019d had enough of the <em>oversight </em>bullshit with Hydra.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Steve said, walking out of the kitchen, smelling of ginger and garlic and what seemed like twenty-million other spices, to greet him, kissing him on the cheek, \u201cmeeting that bad?\u201d<br/>\nBucky wrapped his arms around his middle, kissing him on the forehead when he leaned into him, \u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d he murmured, voice stupidly soft. The things Steve did to him, damn.</p>\n\n<p>Steve laughed into his chest and tipped his head up to look at him, \u201cYou have residual annoyed-scowl on your face.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Bucky raised his eyebrows, \u201cReally, where?\u201d he teased, running his hands up and down Steve&rsquo;s back.<br/>\nSteve leaned up and kissed his nose, \u201cHere,\u201d he kissed his cheek, \u201csome here,\u201d his temple, \u201clittle left here,\u201d his jaw, \u201chere.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll done?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Steve leaned up and kissed his solidly on the lips, with a hint of tongue, he tasted of mango cola. \u201cDone,\u201d he said, in a whisper, when they pulled away, running his fingers through Bucky\u2019s hair, pushing back his kinda quiff thing, one of the first things he\u2019d done after he\u2019d escaped off the helicarrier (with help from Shuri, of course) that was meant to take him from Wakanda to America, was get a haircut. He\u2019d fucking hated the long hair.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMmm, you cooked?\u201d he asked Steve when he felt he was done messing up his quiff.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d he nodded, tugging Bucky into the kitchen, \u201cstir-fry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI knew there\u2019s a reason I fell in love with you,\u201d Bucky said, grinning as he let himself be dragged by Steve. They both knew very well that Bucky could easily just, not, and break out of his hold, he had at least half a foot, maybe eighty pounds and some bastardized version of Erskine\u2019s super-soldier serum on him. But he let himself be dragged into the kitchen, because it was <em>Steve.</em> </p>\n\n<p>He plated up the noodles and put them on the table, next to glasses of wine, Bucky drew him in for another kiss and pulled out a chair for him, \u201cSmells amazing, honey,\u201d he drawled, emphasizing his old Brooklyn accent.</p>\n\n<p>Steve saw right through him, \u201cYou forget, darlin\u2019 I\u2019m from Brooklyn too,\u201d he teased in a horrific impersonation of his accent.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky laughed at him, \u201cYou\u2019re horrible,\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAw,\u201d Steve pouted, \u201cI thought you were in love with me?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m just in it for the stir-fry,\u201d he said, grinning.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDick.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLove you too, baby.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Steve\u2019s phone buzzed and lit up with a message, he flicked it open with his thumb, fork dangling in his mouth. Which was promptly thrown out of his mouth, landing just in front of Bucky\u2019s plate.<br/>\n\u201cHey, hey, you ok?\u201d Bucky asked, concerned, leaning over to rub his shoulder, comfortingly.<br/>\nSteve looked up at him, holding back\u2026 laughter? </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSome guy\u2019s trying to commission me for a piece of all the Avengers,\u201d he said once his shoulders have stopped shaking.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that so funny?\u201d Bucky asked, smiling, even his not-laugh was infectious.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Cause he\u2019s saying\u2019 that he\u2019ll pay a million dollars for it. For every piece.\u201d He burst out laughing again. And at Bucky\u2019s confused face, he told him that it was definitely a scam, \u201cBucky, I\u2019m not, like Jack Kirby or Frank Miller y\u2019know, I have a Tumblr and a comic run. As in one.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Bucky raised his eyebrows, holding off telling him that he\u2019s wrong, he had a very rudimentary idea who those people were, and Steve knew that, \u201cWho was the person? Maybe they\u2019re like a billionaire or something.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Steve shrugged, \u201cProbably not, their users\u2019 just \u2018youknowwhoiam\u2019\u201d he said, showing Bucky the message.  </p>\n\n<p>His phone buzzed again, another commission, but this time from someone he knew, \u201cShuri wants a commission of T\u2019Challa falling over,\u201d he said to Bucky, showing him the video of the King of Wakanda and the Black Panther, falling over. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Bucky said, laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Steve put his phone down and grinned at Bucky, \u201cYeah, yeah I will.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, by the way,\u201d Bucky said, suddenly, swallowing his mouthful of noodles quickly, \u201cStark asked me to move into his frat house, again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cY\u2019 thinkin\u2019 of leavin\u2019 me, soldier?\u201d Steve teased, hooking his foot around Bucky\u2019s ankle. </p>\n\n<p>Bucky smiled at him, \u201cNah, but I said that I have a roommate,\u201d he didn&rsquo;t want Steve to think that he was ashamed of him or something, he was so, so happy to live in a time and a country where a man with another man wasn&rsquo;t cause for a trial and a jail cell, or fear of being beat up in a nondescript alleyway.<br/>\nHe told Steve all of this, months ago, when Steve asked if he was ok telling his colleagues about them.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Steve asked, curious, not judging him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell, y\u2019know back in the dark, dark ages,\u201d Bucky began, leaning forwards to take Steve\u2019s hand across the table, \u201cwe used to say \u2018roommate\u2019 instead\u2019a boyfriend, \u2018cause, y\u2019know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDark ages, yeah,\u201d Steve murmured, playing with Bucky\u2019s fingers, \u201cso it was, what, a reflex?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, something like that, I don&rsquo;t know how much I want them knowing so much about me,\u201d Bucky said, quietly, he knew that he should trust them, but, he was still the new guy.<br/>\nSteve smiled at him and kissed his cheek, \u201cThat\u2019s ok, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t wanna tell them, take as long as you need.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>He did not deserve him. At all. He\u2019s been so, so patient with him, with his goddamn laundry list of issues and problems. Fucking hell he loved him.</p><hr width=\"33%\"><p>\u201cSo, James, Jamesy, who is this \u2018roommate\u2019 of yours?\u201d Tony asked, shooting at a doombot.<br/>\n\u201cNot the time, Stark,\u201d The Soldier growled, tearing the head off a bot.</p>\n\n<center>\n\n<p>-</p></center>\n\n<p>\u201cYou hurt?\u201d Steve asked, as soon as he came home. Bucky smiled tiredly at him, pulling him into a hug, the battle was too close to the offices where Steve had a meeting today.

What do you mean roommate?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Winter Soldier gave Tony an odd look, \u201cDoes roommate mean something new now?\u201d he said, scowling. Not that Tony had seen him with any other expression, although sometimes it came with an extra helping of anger and/or annoyance. </p>\n\n<p>He was scowling when they first found him in the Hydra facility, he scowled when he signed the papers to officially join the Avengers Initiative, he scowled all they way through battles and clean up.<br>\nAlthough, Shuri had texted Tony saying that he had smiled when they\u2019d finally undone his Hydra programming -  and T\u2019Challa had confirmed it, so it was good to know that he, in theory, <em>could</em> make any other expression that wasn\u2019t a scowl, but Tony had never seen it.</p>\n\n<p>Tony squinted at The Soldier, \u201cNo,\u201d he said carefully, the roommate vine playing on a loop in his head - Peter had been so disappointed when he\u2019d found out that Shuri had introduced him to vines, and the subsequent horror that was Gen Z humour, before he could. Tony offhandedly wondered if The Soldier knew what vines were, <em>technically</em>, he could be classed as a millennial.<br>\nProbably not.<br>\nHe looked over at The Soldier\u2019s whole, demeanor, the Murder Stance\u2122 (a sequel to the Murder Strut\u2122) in full force, topped off with the ever-present scowl (this time, with a flavour of impatience) and decided, that <em>no</em>, The Winter Soldier definitely didn\u2019t know what vines were.</p>\n\n<p>And now the Murder Stance\u2122 was the Murder Strut\u2122. Away from Tony - The Soldier had a surprisingly good ass - \u201cHey, hey! Manchurian Candidate, you never gave me an answer, you gonna move into the tower with the rest of us?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The Soldier, without turning around, yelled back, \u201cI told you, I have a roommate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony turned around and frowned at the rest of the team, \u201cWhen did he get a roommate?\u201d he muttered, not really expecting an answer.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHis roommate,\u201d growled Fury, from behind him, talking over Tony\u2019s squawk and his promises to \u2018cat-bell\u2019 him, \u201cis none of your business. Why are you all still in my conference room?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He huffed, \u201cYou gotta be paying him more if he has to have a roommate,\u201d he knew New York was expensive, but the guy was a <em>superhero</em>, and he probably had like, seven decades worth of backpay.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting paid as much as you are. Get out of my conference room.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much I\u2019m getting paid,\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCheck your books, and <em>get out of my damn room,</em>\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOut.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony and the rest of the Avengers hightailed it out of there, not wanting to relive <em>that </em>particular day.</p><hr width=\"33%\"><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m home,\u201d Bucky called, as he entered their apartment, emptying his pockets of all his weapons into the basket near the door, feeling himself physically go from The Winter Soldier, ex-Hydra, ex-brainwashed, SHIELD agent and Avenger, to Bucky Barnes, sometimes drummer, sometimes mechanic, and boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>It was always so <em>liberating</em>, when he got home, free from surveillance, although, he wasn\u2019t naive, he was pretty sure SHIELD knew he lived here. But that better be the extent of it. He\u2019d made sure that the surveillance and oversight clause in his Avengers papers was very clear.<br>\nMatt had helped.<br>\nHe\u2019d had enough of the <em>oversight </em>bullshit with Hydra.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Steve said, walking out of the kitchen, smelling of ginger and garlic and what seemed like twenty-million other spices, to greet him, kissing him on the cheek, \u201cmeeting that bad?\u201d<br>\nBucky wrapped his arms around his middle, kissing him on the forehead when he leaned into him, \u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d he murmured, voice stupidly soft. The things Steve did to him, damn.</p>\n\n<p>Steve laughed into his chest and tipped his head up to look at him, \u201cYou have residual annoyed-scowl on your face.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Bucky raised his eyebrows, \u201cReally, where?\u201d he teased, running his hands up and down Steve\u2019s back.<br>\nSteve leaned up and kissed his nose, \u201cHere,\u201d he kissed his cheek, \u201csome here,\u201d his temple, \u201clittle left here,\u201d his jaw, \u201chere.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll done?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Steve leaned up and kissed his solidly on the lips, with a hint of tongue, he tasted of mango cola. \u201cDone,\u201d he said, in a whisper, when they pulled away, running his fingers through Bucky\u2019s hair, pushing back his kinda quiff thing, one of the first things he\u2019d done after he\u2019d escaped off the helicarrier (with help from Shuri, of course) that was meant to take him from Wakanda to America, was get a haircut. He\u2019d fucking hated the long hair.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMmm, you cooked?\u201d he asked Steve when he felt he was done messing up his quiff.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d he nodded, tugging Bucky into the kitchen, \u201cstir-fry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI knew there\u2019s a reason I fell in love with you,\u201d Bucky said, grinning as he let himself be dragged by Steve. They both knew very well that Bucky could easily just, not, and break out of his hold, he had at least half a foot, maybe eighty pounds and some bastardized version of Erskine\u2019s super-soldier serum on him. But he let himself be dragged into the kitchen, because it was <em>Steve.</em> </p>\n\n<p>He plated up the noodles and put them on the table, next to glasses of wine, Bucky drew him in for another kiss and pulled out a chair for him, \u201cSmells amazing, honey,\u201d he drawled, emphasizing his old Brooklyn accent.</p>\n\n<p>Steve saw right through him, \u201cYou forget, darlin\u2019 I\u2019m from Brooklyn too,\u201d he teased in a horrific impersonation of his accent.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky laughed at him, \u201cYou\u2019re horrible,\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAw,\u201d Steve pouted, \u201cI thought you were in love with me?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m just in it for the stir-fry,\u201d he said, grinning.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDick.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLove you too, baby.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Steve\u2019s phone buzzed and lit up with a message, he flicked it open with his thumb, fork dangling in his mouth. Which was promptly thrown out of his mouth, landing just in front of Bucky\u2019s plate.<br>\n\u201cHey, hey, you ok?\u201d Bucky asked, concerned, leaning over to rub his shoulder, comfortingly.<br>\nSteve looked up at him, holding back\u2026 laughter? </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSome guy\u2019s trying to commission me for a piece of all the Avengers,\u201d he said once his shoulders have stopped shaking.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that so funny?\u201d Bucky asked, smiling, even his not-laugh was infectious.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Cause he\u2019s saying\u2019 that he\u2019ll pay a million dollars for it. For every piece.\u201d He burst out laughing again. And at Bucky\u2019s confused face, he told him that it was definitely a scam, \u201cBucky, I\u2019m not, like Jack Kirby or Frank Miller y\u2019know, I have a Tumblr and a comic run. As in one.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Bucky raised his eyebrows, holding off telling him that he\u2019s wrong, he had a very rudimentary idea who those people were, and Steve knew that, \u201cWho was the person? Maybe they\u2019re like a billionaire or something.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Steve shrugged, \u201cProbably not, their users\u2019 just \u2018youknowwhoiam\u2019\u201d he said, showing Bucky the message.  </p>\n\n<p>His phone buzzed again, another commission, but this time from someone he knew, \u201cShuri wants a commission of T\u2019Challa falling over,\u201d he said to Bucky, showing him the video of the King of Wakanda and the Black Panther, falling over. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Bucky said, laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Steve put his phone down and grinned at Bucky, \u201cYeah, yeah I will.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, by the way,\u201d Bucky said, suddenly, swallowing his mouthful of noodles quickly, \u201cStark asked me to move into his frat house, again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cY\u2019 thinkin\u2019 of leavin\u2019 me, soldier?\u201d Steve teased, hooking his foot around Bucky\u2019s ankle. </p>\n\n<p>Bucky smiled at him, \u201cNah, but I said that I have a roommate,\u201d he didn\u2019t want Steve to think that he was ashamed of him or something, he was so, so happy to live in a time and a country where a man with another man wasn\u2019t cause for a trial and a jail cell, or fear of being beat up in a nondescript alleyway.<br>\nHe told Steve all of this, months ago, when Steve asked if he was ok telling his colleagues about them.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Steve asked, curious, not judging him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell, y\u2019know back in the dark, dark ages,\u201d Bucky began, leaning forwards to take Steve\u2019s hand across the table, \u201cwe used to say \u2018roommate\u2019 instead\u2019a boyfriend, \u2018cause, y\u2019know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDark ages, yeah,\u201d Steve murmured, playing with Bucky\u2019s fingers, \u201cso it was, what, a reflex?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, something like that, I don\u2019t know how much I want them knowing so much about me,\u201d Bucky said, quietly, he knew that he should trust them, but, he was still the new guy.<br>\nSteve smiled at him and kissed his cheek, \u201cThat\u2019s ok, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t wanna tell them, take as long as you need.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>He did not deserve him. At all. He\u2019s been so, so patient with him, with his goddamn laundry list of issues and problems. Fucking hell he loved him.</p><hr width=\"33%\"><p>\u201cSo, James, Jamesy, who is this \u2018roommate\u2019 of yours?\u201d Tony asked, shooting at a doombot.<br>\n\u201cNot the time, Stark,\u201d The Soldier growled, tearing the head off a bot.</p>\n\n<center>\n\n<p>-</p></center>\n\n<p>\u201cYou hurt?\u201d Steve asked, as soon as he came home.

Uh, Mr. Stark asked me to uh, ask, who\u2019s your roommate?\u201d Stark\u2019s spider-son asked fiddling with a pen, that had \u2018Stark Industries\u2019 emblazoned on the side He was fairly sure Stark didn\u2019t make pens. <em>Recorder, maybe transmitter.</em> Huh.\n\n<p>He reached over, plucked the pen out of his hands and spoke into the near-invisible mic, \u201cMy roommate is an artist twink with whom I am in a homosexual relationship and I fuck daily.\u201d<br>\nHe pressed the pen back into the kid\u2019s hands and patted his shoulder, \u201cGood talk, spider-kid.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He turned around and walked straight out of the door, leaving Peter bright red and sputtering, whispering into the mic, \u201cI think he wants you to stop asking.\u201d</p>",

What do you mean roommate?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Winter Soldier gave Tony an odd look, \u201cDoes roommate mean something new now?\u201d he said, scowling. Not that Tony had seen him with any other expression, although sometimes it came with an extra helping of anger and/or annoyance. </p>\n\n<p>He was scowling when they first found him in the Hydra facility, he scowled when he signed the papers to officially join the Avengers Initiative, he scowled all they way through battles and clean up.<br>\nAlthough, Shuri had texted Tony saying that he had smiled when they\u2019d finally undone his Hydra programming -  and T\u2019Challa had confirmed it, so it was good to know that he, in theory, <em>could</em> make any other expression that wasn\u2019t a scowl, but Tony had never seen it.</p>\n\n<p>Tony squinted at The Soldier, \u201cNo,\u201d he said carefully, the roommate vine playing on a loop in his head - Peter had been so disappointed when he\u2019d found out that Shuri had introduced him to vines, and the subsequent horror that was Gen Z humour, before he could. Tony offhandedly wondered if The Soldier knew what vines were, <em>technically</em>, he could be classed as a millennial.<br>\nProbably not.<br>\nHe looked over at The Soldier\u2019s whole, demeanor, the Murder Stance\u2122 (a sequel to the Murder Strut\u2122) in full force, topped off with the ever-present scowl (this time, with a flavour of impatience) and decided, that <em>no</em>, The Winter Soldier definitely didn\u2019t know what vines were.</p>\n\n<p>And now the Murder Stance\u2122 was the Murder Strut\u2122. Away from Tony - The Soldier had a surprisingly good ass - \u201cHey, hey! Manchurian Candidate, you never gave me an answer, you gonna move into the tower with the rest of us?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The Soldier, without turning around, yelled back, \u201cI told you, I have a roommate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony turned around and frowned at the rest of the team, \u201cWhen did he get a roommate?\u201d he muttered, not really expecting an answer.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHis roommate,\u201d growled Fury, from behind him, talking over Tony\u2019s squawk and his promises to \u2018cat-bell\u2019 him, \u201cis none of your business. Why are you all still in my conference room?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He huffed, \u201cYou gotta be paying him more if he has to have a roommate,\u201d he knew New York was expensive, but the guy was a <em>superhero</em>, and he probably had like, seven decades worth of backpay.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting paid as much as you are. Get out of my conference room.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much I\u2019m getting paid,\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCheck your books, and <em>get out of my damn room,</em>\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOut.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony and the rest of the Avengers hightailed it out of there, not wanting to relive <em>that </em>particular day.</p><hr width=\"33%\"><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m home,\u201d Bucky called, as he entered their apartment, emptying his pockets of all his weapons into the basket near the door, feeling himself physically go from The Winter Soldier, ex-Hydra, ex-brainwashed, SHIELD agent and Avenger, to Bucky Barnes, sometimes drummer, sometimes mechanic, and boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>It was always so <em>liberating</em>, when he got home, free from surveillance, although, he wasn\u2019t naive, he was pretty sure SHIELD knew he lived here. But that better be the extent of it. He\u2019d made sure that the surveillance and oversight clause in his Avengers papers was very clear.<br>\nMatt had helped.<br>\nHe\u2019d had enough of the <em>oversight </em>bullshit with Hydra.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Steve said, walking out of the kitchen, smelling of ginger and garlic and what seemed like twenty-million other spices, to greet him, kissing him on the cheek, \u201cmeeting that bad?\u201d<br>\nBucky wrapped his arms around his middle, kissing him on the forehead when he leaned into him, \u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d he murmured, voice stupidly soft. The things Steve did to him, damn.</p>\n\n<p>Steve laughed into his chest and tipped his head up to look at him, \u201cYou have residual annoyed-scowl on your face.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Bucky raised his eyebrows, \u201cReally, where?\u201d he teased, running his hands up and down Steve\u2019s back.<br>\nSteve leaned up and kissed his nose, \u201cHere,\u201d he kissed his cheek, \u201csome here,\u201d his temple, \u201clittle left here,\u201d his jaw, \u201chere.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll done?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Steve leaned up and kissed his solidly on the lips, with a hint of tongue, he tasted of mango cola. \u201cDone,\u201d he said, in a whisper, when they pulled away, running his fingers through Bucky\u2019s hair, pushing back his kinda quiff thing, one of the first things he\u2019d done after he\u2019d escaped off the helicarrier (with help from Shuri, of course) that was meant to take him from Wakanda to America, was get a haircut. He\u2019d fucking hated the long hair.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMmm, you cooked?\u201d he asked Steve when he felt he was done messing up his quiff.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d he nodded, tugging Bucky into the kitchen, \u201cstir-fry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI knew there\u2019s a reason I fell in love with you,\u201d Bucky said, grinning as he let himself be dragged by Steve. They both knew very well that Bucky could easily just, not, and break out of his hold, he had at least half a foot, maybe eighty pounds and some bastardized version of Erskine\u2019s super-soldier serum on him. But he let himself be dragged into the kitchen, because it was <em>Steve.</em> </p>\n\n<p>He plated up the noodles and put them on the table, next to glasses of wine, Bucky drew him in for another kiss and pulled out a chair for him, \u201cSmells amazing, honey,\u201d he drawled, emphasizing his old Brooklyn accent.</p>\n\n<p>Steve saw right through him, \u201cYou forget, darlin\u2019 I\u2019m from Brooklyn too,\u201d he teased in a horrific impersonation of his accent.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky laughed at him, \u201cYou\u2019re horrible,\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAw,\u201d Steve pouted, \u201cI thought you were in love with me?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m just in it for the stir-fry,\u201d he said, grinning.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDick.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLove you too, baby.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Steve\u2019s phone buzzed and lit up with a message, he flicked it open with his thumb, fork dangling in his mouth. Which was promptly thrown out of his mouth, landing just in front of Bucky\u2019s plate.<br>\n\u201cHey, hey, you ok?\u201d Bucky asked, concerned, leaning over to rub his shoulder, comfortingly.<br>\nSteve looked up at him, holding back\u2026 laughter? </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSome guy\u2019s trying to commission me for a piece of all the Avengers,\u201d he said once his shoulders have stopped shaking.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that so funny?\u201d Bucky asked, smiling, even his not-laugh was infectious.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Cause he\u2019s saying\u2019 that he\u2019ll pay a million dollars for it. For every piece.\u201d He burst out laughing again. And at Bucky\u2019s confused face, he told him that it was definitely a scam, \u201cBucky, I\u2019m not, like Jack Kirby or Frank Miller y\u2019know, I have a Tumblr and a comic run. As in one.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Bucky raised his eyebrows, holding off telling him that he\u2019s wrong, he had a very rudimentary idea who those people were, and Steve knew that, \u201cWho was the person? Maybe they\u2019re like a billionaire or something.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Steve shrugged, \u201cProbably not, their users\u2019 just \u2018youknowwhoiam\u2019\u201d he said, showing Bucky the message.  </p>\n\n<p>His phone buzzed again, another commission, but this time from someone he knew, \u201cShuri wants a commission of T\u2019Challa falling over,\u201d he said to Bucky, showing him the video of the King of Wakanda and the Black Panther, falling over. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Bucky said, laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Steve put his phone down and grinned at Bucky, \u201cYeah, yeah I will.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, by the way,\u201d Bucky said, suddenly, swallowing his mouthful of noodles quickly, \u201cStark asked me to move into his frat house, again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cY\u2019 thinkin\u2019 of leavin\u2019 me, soldier?\u201d Steve teased, hooking his foot around Bucky\u2019s ankle. </p>\n\n<p>Bucky smiled at him, \u201cNah, but I said that I have a roommate,\u201d he didn\u2019t want Steve to think that he was ashamed of him or something, he was so, so happy to live in a time and a country where a man with another man wasn\u2019t cause for a trial and a jail cell, or fear of being beat up in a nondescript alleyway.<br>\nHe told Steve all of this, months ago, when Steve asked if he was ok telling his colleagues about them.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Steve asked, curious, not judging him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell, y\u2019know back in the dark, dark ages,\u201d Bucky began, leaning forwards to take Steve\u2019s hand across the table, \u201cwe used to say \u2018roommate\u2019 instead\u2019a boyfriend, \u2018cause, y\u2019know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDark ages, yeah,\u201d Steve murmured, playing with Bucky\u2019s fingers, \u201cso it was, what, a reflex?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, something like that, I don\u2019t know how much I want them knowing so much about me,\u201d Bucky said, quietly, he knew that he should trust them, but, he was still the new guy.<br>\nSteve smiled at him and kissed his cheek, \u201cThat\u2019s ok, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t wanna tell them, take as long as you need.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>He did not deserve him. At all. He\u2019s been so, so patient with him, with his goddamn laundry list of issues and problems. Fucking hell he loved him.</p><hr width=\"33%\"><p>\u201cSo, James, Jamesy, who is this \u2018roommate\u2019 of yours?\u201d Tony asked, shooting at a doombot.<br>\n\u201cNot the time, Stark,\u201d The Soldier growled, tearing the head off a bot.</p>\n\n<center>\n\n<p>-</p></center>\n\n<p>\u201cYou hurt?\u201d Steve asked, as soon as he came home. Bucky smiled tiredly at him, pulling him into a hug, the battle was too close to the offices where Steve had a meeting today. Steve got that and let Bucky hold him for as long as he needed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said, finally, into Steve\u2019s hair, \u201cbut, Stark asked me about you,\u201d he pulled away to kiss him lightly on the cheek.<br>\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d he asked, smiling up at him, leaning into his touch as he pushed his fringe off his face. Bucky gave him a look, \u201cHe asked in the middle of destroying a doombot.\u201d</p>\n\n<center>\n\n<p>=</p></center>\u201cWho\u2019s your roommate, Soldier?\u201d Natasha asked, carefully tilting her head to the side in a crafted curiosity and tipping her chin up in a challenge, hoping that the soft lighting of the bar and the intimate setting, with only the team and a couple close friends, would help him open up.<br>\nThe Soldier smirked, almost smiled condescendingly, \u201cNice try Romanoff.\u201d<center>\n\n<p>-</p></center>\u201cRomanoff asked about you today,\u201d Bucky said, over dinner, \u201cshe did the whole, \u2018you can trust me, this is a safe-space\u2019 bullshit, soft lighting and all.\u201d<br>\nSteve hummed, taking a sip of cola, \u201cVery homely, what\u2019d you tell her?\u201d<br>\n\u201cA fairly PG version of \u2018fuck off\u2019\u201d Bucky said, stealing Steve\u2019s drink.<center>\n\n<p>=</p></center>\u201cHey Frosty, who\u2019s the roommate?\u201d Clint asked, wiping a towel across the back of his neck and draining half a water bottle.<br>\nHe looked over his shoulder at Clint, rubbing a hand through his hair, \u201cBeat it, Legolas.\u201d<br><em>Legolas? Who\u2019d taught him that? </em><center>\n\n<p>-</p></center>\u201cBarton asked about my mysterious roommate today,\u201d Bucky said, apropos of absolutely nothing, after his\u2026 uh, second work out of the day, after a couple minutes of silence.<br>\nSteve rolled on top of Bucky, and pressed kissed to his neck, \u201cYeah, what\u2019d you say?\u201d<br>\nBucky hummed and ran a hand down his back, \u201cCalled \u2018im \u2018Legolas\u2019,\u201d he said, smiling proudly.<br>\nSteve laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re cute when you think you\u2019re being funny.\u201d<center>\n\n<p>=</p></center>\u201cSo, James,\u201d Bruce started, pushing a cup of green tea towards him, \u201cyou\u2019ve made some friends outside of the team right?\u201d<br>\n\u201cWhat the fuck is this, it tastes of grass.\u201d<center>\n\n<p>-</p></center>\u201cBanner today,\u201d Bucky said, when Steve asked how his day went.<br>\n\u201cYou should call your teammates by their first names,\u201d Steve suggested, knowing what Bucky was on about.<br>\nHe just grunted in response, \u201cNah, they all call me \u2018James\u2019 or \u2018Barnes\u2019 or \u2018Soldier\u2019 or something cold \u2018n ice-y, they think they\u2019re funny.\u201d<center>\n\n<p>=</p></center>\u201cWho\u2019s this roommate of yours, Cable?\u201d Sam asked, spinning around in his chair and drumming his fingers on the table.<br>\n\u201cKeep writing your notes, Freedom Pigeon.\u201d<center>\n\n<p>-</p></center>\u201cFreedom Pigeon,\u201d Bucky grunted, flopping down on Steve\u2019s lap, narrowly missing poking his eye out Joker-style, humming happily when he ran his hands through his hair.<br>\n\u201cYou need a haircut,\u201d he commented, pushing his hair back and letting it flop over his face. He looked younger, like that, more innocent, with longer hair, flopping all over his forehead.\n\n<p>Bucky just hummed sliding his eyes shut, \u201cWould you be ok, if I said something about us?\u201d he asked, nervous, even though they had talked about it before, and Steve was a hundred percent on-board with it, but he wanted to make sure.</p>\n\n<p>Steve bent down and kissed his forehead, \u201cYou know I would, Buck.\u201d</p>\n\n<center>\n\n<p>=</p></center>\u201cUh, hey, Mr. Barnes, everyone\u2019s talking about this roommat-\u201d a weedy SHIELD lackey asked, just as he was about to leave the building for the day<br>\n\u201cDo I know you?\u201d He interrupted, he couldn\u2019t wait to get home, to get back to Steve.<br>\nThe lackey locked down at his shoes, \u201cMr. Stark gave me a hundred dollars to ask.\u201d<br>\nHe rolled his eyes, \u201cTell him to try harder.\u201d<center>\n\n<p>-</p></center>\u201cSome SHIELD lackey today,\u201d Bucky said, tracing lines on Steve\u2019s hip.<br>\n\u201cStark\u2019s really determined, huh,\u201d Steve said, pressing closer to Bucky and wrapping an arm around his neck, \u201cyou should troll him or something,\u201d he continued in a mumble, fighting off a yawn.<br>\nBucky pulled away a little, considering Steve and giving him a once-over. Steve mumbled out a \u2018y\u2019 like what y\u2019 see?\u2019 drifting into unconsciousness.\n\n<p>\u201cYou ok with bein\u2019 called a twink?\u201d Bucky murmured, wrapping his arms around his waist and kissing his shoulder.<br>\n\u201cYup, \u2018m your twink,\u201d he giggled, face falling into Bucky\u2019s shoulder<br>\nA warm feeling spread throughout his chest, at Steve being <em>his</em>, and at him being all giggly and relaxed and falling asleep, so, so <em>vulnerable</em> in a way no-one would have been, when he was still under Hydra\u2019s brainwashing. He was so in love with him, so, so much.</p>\n\n<center>\n\n<p>=</p></center>\u201cSo, uh, Mr. Winter, sir, or, uh, do you prefer Mr. Soldier?

Not that Tony had seen him with any other expression, although sometimes it came with an extra helping of anger and/or annoyance. </p>\n\n<p>He was scowling when they first found him in the Hydra facility, he scowled when he signed the papers to officially join the Avengers Initiative, he scowled all they way through battles and clean up.<br />\nAlthough, Shuri had texted Tony saying that he had smiled when they&rsquo;d finally undone his Hydra programming -  and T&rsquo;Challa had confirmed it, so it was good to know that he, in theory, <em>could</em> make any other expression that wasn&rsquo;t a scowl, but Tony had never seen it.</p>\n\n<p>Tony squinted at The Soldier, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said carefully, the roommate vine playing on a loop in his head - Peter had been so disappointed when he&rsquo;d found out that Shuri had introduced him to vines, and the subsequent horror that was Gen Z humour, before he could. Tony offhandedly wondered if The Soldier knew what vines were, <em>technically</em>, he could be classed as a millennial.<br />\nProbably not.<br />\nHe looked over at The Soldier&rsquo;s whole, demeanor, the Murder Stance&trade; (a sequel to the Murder Strut&trade;) in full force, topped off with the ever-present scowl (this time, with a flavour of impatience) and decided, that <em>no</em>, The Winter Soldier definitely didn&rsquo;t know what vines were.</p>\n\n<p>And now the Murder Stance&trade; was the Murder Strut&trade;. Away from Tony - The Soldier had a surprisingly good ass - &ldquo;Hey, hey! Manchurian Candidate, you never gave me an answer, you gonna move into the tower with the rest of us?&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>The Soldier, without turning around, yelled back, &ldquo;I told you, I have a roommate.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Tony turned around and frowned at the rest of the team, &ldquo;When did he get a roommate?&rdquo; he muttered, not really expecting an answer.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;His roommate,&rdquo; growled Fury, from behind him, talking over Tony&rsquo;s squawk and his promises to &lsquo;cat-bell&rsquo; him, &ldquo;is none of your business. Why are you all still in my conference room?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He huffed, &ldquo;You gotta be paying him more if he has to have a roommate,&rdquo; he knew New York was expensive, but the guy was a <em>superhero</em>, and he probably had like, seven decades worth of backpay.  </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting paid as much as you are. Get out of my conference room.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much I&rsquo;m getting paid,&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Check your books, and <em>get out of my damn room,</em>&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;But-&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Out.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Tony and the rest of the Avengers hightailed it out of there, not wanting to relive <em>that </em>particular day.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Honey, I&rsquo;m home,&rdquo; Bucky called, as he entered their apartment, emptying his pockets of all his weapons into the basket near the door, feeling himself physically go from The Winter Soldier, ex-Hydra, ex-brainwashed, SHIELD agent and Avenger, to Bucky Barnes, sometimes drummer, sometimes mechanic, and boyfriend.</p>\n\n<p>It was always so <em>liberating</em>, when he got home, free from surveillance, although, he wasn&rsquo;t naive, he was pretty sure SHIELD knew he lived here. But that better be the extent of it. He&rsquo;d made sure that the surveillance and oversight clause in his Avengers papers was very clear.<br />\nMatt had helped.<br />\nHe&rsquo;d had enough of the <em>oversight </em>bullshit with Hydra.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Steve said, walking out of the kitchen, smelling of ginger and garlic and what seemed like twenty-million other spices, to greet him, kissing him on the cheek, &ldquo;meeting that bad?&rdquo;<br />\nBucky wrapped his arms around his middle, kissing him on the forehead when he leaned into him, &ldquo;Am I that obvious?&rdquo; he murmured, voice stupidly soft. The things Steve did to him, damn.</p>\n\n<p>Steve laughed into his chest and tipped his head up to look at him, &ldquo;You have residual annoyed-scowl on your face.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Bucky raised his eyebrows, &ldquo;Really, where?&rdquo; he teased, running his hands up and down Steve&rsquo;s back.<br />\nSteve leaned up and kissed his nose, &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he kissed his cheek, &ldquo;some here,&rdquo; his temple, &ldquo;little left here,&rdquo; his jaw, &ldquo;here.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;All done?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; Steve leaned up and kissed his solidly on the lips, with a hint of tongue, he tasted of mango cola. &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; he said, in a whisper, when they pulled away, running his fingers through Bucky&rsquo;s hair, pushing back his kinda quiff thing, one of the first things he&rsquo;d done after he&rsquo;d escaped off the helicarrier (with help from Shuri, of course) that was meant to take him from Wakanda to America, was get a haircut. He&rsquo;d fucking hated the long hair.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Mmm, you cooked?&rdquo; he asked Steve when he felt he was done messing up his quiff.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; he nodded, tugging Bucky into the kitchen, &ldquo;stir-fry.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I knew there&rsquo;s a reason I fell in love with you,&rdquo; Bucky said, grinning as he let himself be dragged by Steve. They both knew very well that Bucky could easily just, not, and break out of his hold, he had at least half a foot, maybe eighty pounds and some bastardized version of Erskine&rsquo;s super-soldier serum on him. But he let himself be dragged into the kitchen, because it was <em>Steve.</em> </p>\n\n<p>He plated up the noodles and put them on the table, next to glasses of wine, Bucky drew him in for another kiss and pulled out a chair for him, &ldquo;Smells amazing, honey,&rdquo; he drawled, emphasizing his old Brooklyn accent.</p>\n\n<p>Steve saw right through him, &ldquo;You forget, darlin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m from Brooklyn too,&rdquo; he teased in a horrific impersonation of his accent.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky laughed at him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re horrible,&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Aw,&rdquo; Steve pouted, &ldquo;I thought you were in love with me?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Nah, I&rsquo;m just in it for the stir-fry,&rdquo; he said, grinning.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Dick.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Love you too, baby.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Steve&rsquo;s phone buzzed and lit up with a message, he flicked it open with his thumb, fork dangling in his mouth. Which was promptly thrown out of his mouth, landing just in front of Bucky&rsquo;s plate.<br />\n&ldquo;Hey, hey, you ok?&rdquo; Bucky asked, concerned, leaning over to rub his shoulder, comfortingly.<br />\nSteve looked up at him, holding back&hellip; laughter? </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Some guy&rsquo;s trying to commission me for a piece of all the Avengers,&rdquo; he said once his shoulders have stopped shaking.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that so funny?&rdquo; Bucky asked, smiling, even his not-laugh was infectious.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause he&rsquo;s saying&rsquo; that he&rsquo;ll pay a million dollars for it. For every piece.&rdquo; He burst out laughing again. And at Bucky&rsquo;s confused face, he told him that it was definitely a scam, &ldquo;Bucky, I&rsquo;m not, like Jack Kirby or Frank Miller y&rsquo;know, I have a Tumblr and a comic run. As in one.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Bucky raised his eyebrows, holding off telling him that he&rsquo;s wrong, he had a very rudimentary idea who those people were, and Steve knew that, &ldquo;Who was the person? Maybe they&rsquo;re like a billionaire or something.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Steve shrugged, &ldquo;Probably not, their users&rsquo; just &lsquo;youknowwhoiam&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, showing Bucky the message.  </p>\n\n<p>His phone buzzed again, another commission, but this time from someone he knew, &ldquo;Shuri wants a commission of T&rsquo;Challa falling over,&rdquo; he said to Bucky, showing him the video of the King of Wakanda and the Black Panther, falling over. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Do it,&rdquo; Bucky said, laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Steve put his phone down and grinned at Bucky, &ldquo;Yeah, yeah I will.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way,&rdquo; Bucky said, suddenly, swallowing his mouthful of noodles quickly, &ldquo;Stark asked me to move into his frat house, again.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; of leavin&rsquo; me, soldier?&rdquo; Steve teased, hooking his foot around Bucky&rsquo;s ankle. </p>\n\n<p>Bucky smiled at him, &ldquo;Nah, but I said that I have a roommate,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t want Steve to think that he was ashamed of him or something, he was so, so happy to live in a time and a country where a man with another man wasn&rsquo;t cause for a trial and a jail cell, or fear of being beat up in a nondescript alleyway.<br />\nHe told Steve all of this, months ago, when Steve asked if he was ok telling his colleagues about them.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Steve asked, curious, not judging him.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well, y&rsquo;know back in the dark, dark ages,&rdquo; Bucky began, leaning forwards to take Steve&rsquo;s hand across the table, &ldquo;we used to say &lsquo;roommate&rsquo; instead&rsquo;a boyfriend, &lsquo;cause, y&rsquo;know.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Dark ages, yeah,&rdquo; Steve murmured, playing with Bucky&rsquo;s fingers, &ldquo;so it was, what, a reflex?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, something like that, I don&rsquo;t know how much I want them knowing so much about me,&rdquo; Bucky said, quietly, he knew that he should trust them, but, he was still the new guy.<br />\nSteve smiled at him and kissed his cheek, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ok, it&rsquo;s fine if you don&rsquo;t wanna tell them, take as long as you need.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>He did not deserve him. At all. He&rsquo;s been so, so patient with him, with his goddamn laundry list of issues and problems. Fucking hell he loved him.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;So, James, Jamesy, who is this &lsquo;roommate&rsquo; of yours?&rdquo; Tony asked, shooting at a doombot.<br />\n&ldquo;Not the time, Stark,&rdquo; The Soldier growled, tearing the head off a bot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You hurt?&rdquo; Steve asked, as soon as he came home. Bucky smiled tiredly at him, pulling him into a hug, the battle was too close to the offices where Steve had a meeting today. Steve got that and let Bucky hold him for as long as he needed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; he said, finally, into Steve&rsquo;s hair, &ldquo;but, Stark asked me about you,&rdquo; he pulled away to kiss him lightly on the cheek.<br />\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you say?&rdquo; he asked, smiling up at him, leaning into his touch as he pushed his fringe off his face. Bucky gave him a look, &ldquo;He asked in the middle of destroying a doombot.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>=</p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your roommate, Soldier?&rdquo; Natasha asked, carefully tilting her head to the side in a crafted curiosity and tipping her chin up in a challenge, hoping that the soft lighting of the bar and the intimate setting, with only the team and a couple close friends, would help him open up.<br />\nThe Soldier smirked, almost smiled condescendingly, &ldquo;Nice try Romanoff.&rdquo;\n\n<p>-</p>&ldquo;Romanoff asked about you today,&rdquo; Bucky said, over dinner, &ldquo;she did the whole, &lsquo;you can trust me, this is a safe-space&rsquo; bullshit, soft lighting and all.&rdquo;<br />\nSteve hummed, taking a sip of cola, &ldquo;Very homely, what&rsquo;d you tell her?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;A fairly PG version of &lsquo;fuck off&rsquo;&rdquo; Bucky said, stealing Steve&rsquo;s drink.\n\n<p>=</p>&ldquo;Hey Frosty, who&rsquo;s the roommate?&rdquo; Clint asked, wiping a towel across the back of his neck and draining half a water bottle.<br />\nHe looked over his shoulder at Clint, rubbing a hand through his hair, &ldquo;Beat it, Legolas.&rdquo;<br /><em>Legolas? Who&rsquo;d taught him that? </em>\n\n<p>-</p>&ldquo;Barton asked about my mysterious roommate today,&rdquo; Bucky said, apropos of absolutely nothing, after his&hellip; uh, second work out of the day, after a couple minutes of silence.<br />\nSteve rolled on top of Bucky, and pressed kissed to his neck, &ldquo;Yeah, what&rsquo;d you say?&rdquo;<br />\nBucky hummed and ran a hand down his back, &ldquo;Called &lsquo;im &lsquo;Legolas&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, smiling proudly.<br />\nSteve laughed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re cute when you think you&rsquo;re being funny.&rdquo;\n\n<p>=</p>&ldquo;So, James,&rdquo; Bruce started, pushing a cup of green tea towards him, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve made some friends outside of the team right?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;What the fuck is this, it tastes of grass.&rdquo;\n\n<p>-</p>&ldquo;Banner today,&rdquo; Bucky said, when Steve asked how his day went.<br />\n&ldquo;You should call your teammates by their first names,&rdquo; Steve suggested, knowing what Bucky was on about.<br />\nHe just grunted in response, &ldquo;Nah, they all call me &lsquo;James&rsquo; or &lsquo;Barnes&rsquo; or &lsquo;Soldier&rsquo; or something cold &lsquo;n ice-y, they think they&rsquo;re funny.&rdquo;\n\n<p>=</p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this roommate of yours, Cable?&rdquo; Sam asked, spinning around in his chair and drumming his fingers on the table.<br />\n&ldquo;Keep writing your notes, Freedom Pigeon.&rdquo;\n\n<p>-</p>&ldquo;Freedom Pigeon,&rdquo; Bucky grunted, flopping down on Steve&rsquo;s lap, narrowly missing poking his eye out Joker-style, humming happily when he ran his hands through his hair.<br />\n&ldquo;You need a haircut,&rdquo; he commented, pushing his hair back and letting it flop over his face. He looked younger, like that, more innocent, with longer hair, flopping all over his forehead.\n\n<p>Bucky just hummed sliding his eyes shut, &ldquo;Would you be ok, if I said something about us?&rdquo; he asked, nervous, even though they had talked about it before, and Steve was a hundred percent on-board with it, but he wanted to make sure.</p>\n\n<p>Steve bent down and kissed his forehead, &ldquo;You know I would, Buck.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>=</p>&ldquo;Uh, hey, Mr. Barnes, everyone&rsquo;s talking about this roommat-&rdquo; a weedy SHIELD lackey asked, just as he was about to leave the building for the day<br />\n&ldquo;Do I know you?&rdquo; He interrupted, he couldn&rsquo;t wait to get home, to get back to Steve.<br />\nThe lackey locked down at his shoes, &ldquo;Mr. Stark gave me a hundred dollars to ask.&rdquo;<br />\nHe rolled his eyes, &ldquo;Tell him to try harder.&rdquo;\n\n<p>-</p>&ldquo;Some SHIELD lackey today,&rdquo; Bucky said, tracing lines on Steve&rsquo;s hip.<br />\n&ldquo;Stark&rsquo;s really determined, huh,&rdquo; Steve said, pressing closer to Bucky and wrapping an arm around his neck, &ldquo;you should troll him or something,&rdquo; he continued in a mumble, fighting off a yawn.<br />\nBucky pulled away a little, considering Steve and giving him a once-over. Steve mumbled out a &lsquo;y&rsquo; like what y&rsquo; see?&rsquo; drifting into unconsciousness.\n\n<p>&ldquo;You ok with bein&rsquo; called a twink?&rdquo; Bucky murmured, wrapping his arms around his waist and kissing his shoulder.<br />\n&ldquo;Yup, &lsquo;m your twink,&rdquo; he giggled, face falling into Bucky&rsquo;s shoulder<br />\nA warm feeling spread throughout his chest, at Steve being <em>his</em>, and at him being all giggly and relaxed and falling asleep, so, so <em>vulnerable</em> in a way no-one would have been, when he was still under Hydra&rsquo;s brainwashing. He was so in love with him, so, so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>=</p>&ldquo;So, uh, Mr. Winter, sir, or, uh, do you prefer Mr. Soldier? Uh, Mr. Stark asked me to uh, ask, who&rsquo;s your roommate?&rdquo; Stark&rsquo;s spider-son asked fiddling with a pen, that had &lsquo;Stark Industries&rsquo; emblazoned on the side He was fairly sure Stark didn&rsquo;t make pens. <em>Recorder, maybe transmitter.</em> Huh.\n\n<p>He reached over, plucked the pen out of his hands and spoke into the near-invisible mic, &ldquo;My roommate is an artist twink with whom I am in a homosexual relationship and I fuck daily.&rdquo;<br />\nHe pressed the pen back into the kid&rsquo;s hands and patted his shoulder, &ldquo;Good talk, spider-kid.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He turned around and walked straight out of the door, leaving Peter bright red and sputtering, whispering into the mic, &ldquo;I think he wants you to stop asking.&rdquo;</p>",
