        "question": "For the fic prompts: 44 for Aziracrow, please?",
        "answer": "<p>Crowley had spent whole nights with Aziraphale before. Most of those, they had been drinking and forgetting time until the morning light shone in through the impeccably cleaned windows of the flat above the bookshop.</p><p>This was different. For one thing, they hadn\u2019t gotten drunk. For another, there was a whole lot more touching than ever before. They weren\u2019t at the point yet, where Crowley would have liked to be for literal thousands of years, but Aziraphale had barely let go off his hand all night, pressing himself close to Crowley, holding on to him like a lifeline. It felt good, exactly right \u2013 as much as if could be right for a demon to enjoy an angel\u2019s close presence.</p><p>Crowley assumed, it was different, because he was in love with said angel.</p><p>He had been surprised, when he woke up before Aziraphale did, but then proceeded to slowly pull back from the embrace he was being held in. Without even thinking about it, he grabbed something that looked vaguely wearable off the chair next to the bedroom door, and went to take a nice hot shower. When he stepped out of the bathroom, refreshed, but cosy and warm, dressed in nothing but briefs and the shirt he had taken from Aziraphale\u2019s chair, he cracked his neck, while he made his way to the small kitchen.</p><p>He made himself an espresso \u2013 not because he needed it, but simply because it was one of the tastes, he had come to quite enjoy over the past decades \u2013 and was just picking up the cup from underneath the uncharacteristically expensive coffee maker, when he heard soft footsteps coming to a halt at the door.</p><p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d Aziraphale asked softly and the demon in question needed to carefully reign in his expression, so as not to show, that he had just impossibly fallen even more in love. He turned around and gave the angel a smile.</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2026 umm, nobody. I just \u2013\u201c he stammered and Crowley\u2019s smile widened, just a bit.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, angel?\u201d he asked and took a sip of his coffee. He didn\u2019t mind that it was still scalding hot.</p><p>\u201cYou look uh, you look good,\u201d Aziraphale said and blushed. He was adorable. His hair was still mussed from a good night\u2019s sleep. The dressing gown, he had put on, made him look smaller than he was, especially, because he tried to hide in it.</p><p>\u201cAh, thank you,\u201d Crowley replied and set down the cup on the kitchen table, before he took a couple of steps in Aziraphale\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cIs that\u2026 my shirt?\u201d the angel asked, and Crowley merely shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI needed one,\u201d he added after a moment.</p><p>Aziraphale just looked at him, then held out a hand.</p><p>\u201cCome back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale&rsquo;s blush became even more obvious.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t sleep anymore. But I want to hold you.\u201d </p><p>Crowley\u2019s heart was beating a very unhealthy-sounding rhythm, as he took the offered hand.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>When he found himself in bed, his head on Aziraphale\u2019s chest, closing his eyes, and took a deep breath, the angel spoke up once more.</p><p>\u201cOh, and like this, you don\u2019t have to steal my clothes to smell me.\u201d</p><p>As much as the demon frowned at that, he couldn\u2019t stop a blush creeping into his own cheeks.</p>",
