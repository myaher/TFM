She had to roll a D20 and add her Wisdom modifier, which means that the drow didn\u2019t cast this as a spell with a level. This indicates to me that the charm spell was more of an innate spellcasting ability. In addition to this ability, the drow also had some sort of teleportation and possible disguise spells.<br/></p><p>At 3:13 Fjord casts Counterspell (in a super clutch move) on the drow, to stop their teleportation attempt (which would have also taken the hobgoblin with them). Matt had to check something on his phone when Fjord did this, and had Fjord roll a spellcasting ability check (which is typical for Counterspell&ndash;however, this means that the teleport spell was higher than 3rd level, though all teleport spells are, so that doesn\u2019t say much). I couldn\u2019t glean anything else from this scene (so I\u2019d appreciate others\u2019 opinions!). Travis rolled a 20 so that also doesn\u2019t help figure out what level the spell was, haha (but it was sick af).</p><p>At 3:45 Jester casts Locate Object on the scarf she saw. The dialogue (with some irrelevant things removed) was as follows: Matt: \u201cWait, what level was this?\u201d Laura: \u201cThis is second level.\u201d Matt: \u201coh&hellip;[insert more dialogue] strangely, it picks up nothing.\u201d Laura: \u201cit was a fucking disguise.\u201d My attention was immediately drawn to Matt asking what level the spell was, which made me think Rakshasa, since they have spell immunity up to a certain level (Level 6, which doesn\u2019t make sense with the next spell, so it\u2019s definitely not a Rakshasa&ndash;at least with traditional stats), but Laura might very well be right (and I personally think she is for reasons further down).</p><p>At 3:54 Caduceus casts Locate Creature on the drow. The audio goes as follows: Matt [mumbling]: \u201clocate creature&hellip; fourth level.\u201d [reads more from his phone&hellip; continues reading for a prolonged amount of time&ndash;literally 25 seconds] \u201cOkay, you do sense it.\u201d And this is why I needed to make this post lol.</p><blockquote><p>From the Locate Creature spell: \u201cThe spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close - within 30 feet - at least once. <i>If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the Effects of a Polymorph spell, this spell doesn&rsquo;t locate the creature</i>.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Which means that the drow wasn\u2019t \u201cin a different form,\u201d and yet Jester couldn\u2019t sense the scarf. This springs to mind 2 options: 1) the drow has some sort of magical immunity, at least to a certain level&ndash;an idea partially influenced by Matt\u2019s attention to spell levels during this fight; 2) the drow was under a Disguise Self spell, which influences appearance but <i>does not change</i>\u00a0<i>one\u2019s form</i>. That would explain why Locate Object didn\u2019t work (cast on a scarf that wasn\u2019t real) but Locate Creature did (cast on a creature whose <i>form</i>\u00a0was not changed by a Disguise Self spell).</p><p>Jester later casts Sending, a 3rd level evocation spell. If we look at the possible spell immunity route, Locate Creature and Locate Object are both divination spells, so if the drow has immunity, it\u2019s not an immunity to a specific type of magic. The Sending spell goes through, so maybe the drow is immune to spells up to level 2. However, I think the simplest explanation is that the drow was under the effects of a Disguise Self spell. I saw someone mention that the drow may have been a Cambion (sorry I can\u2019t find your reply anymore :c ), but the Cambion has Alter Self as a daily spell, and the first line of that spell is\u00a0\u201cYou assume a different form,\u201d so the Locate Creature wouldn\u2019t have gone through. Also the Cambion\u2019s Plane Shift teleport ability applies explicitly only to itself, and the drow was going to teleport both themself and the hobgoblin, so the drow\u2019s true form is unlikely to be a Cambion.</p><p>The only reason I\u2019m including the thought that the drow might be immune to magic up to a certain level is because Matt kept asking about it, which was strange to me. It seems very unlikely as the explanation for this, but I think it\u2019s important to note and keep in mind when trying to figure out what this drow\u2019s business is.</p><p>Another confusing thing was that even though the drow <i>wasn\u2019t in the room</i>\u00a0when Jester came in as the British drow woman, they still knew who Jester was to the point that they stated it outright when she cast Sending. At no point did the drow see Jester outside of her Disguise Self spell (it\u2019s not concentration, so it wouldn\u2019t have gone away during the fight), so 1) he knew Jester as Jester the tiefling already or 2) he saw Jester as the drow woman fighting alongside the Mighty Nein and assumed she was with them&ndash;though Jester was never inside at the same time as him, so it\u2019s unlikely that he would have seen her.

                "content": "<p>I wanted to think through the possibilities of this drow and why some spells worked and others didn&rsquo;t. Spoilers for Campaign 2 Episode 63 below!</p><p>In this episode, the party cast 5 spells on / relating to the drow:</p><p>1. Jester&rsquo;s Dispel Magic on Nott</p><p>2. Fjord&rsquo;s Counterspell on the drow, who was casting some sort of teleport spell.</p><p>3. Jester&rsquo;s Locate Object on the Scarf the drow was wearing</p><p>4. Caduceus&rsquo; Locate Creature on the drow</p><p>5. Jester&rsquo;s Sending on the drow</p><p>Jester casts Dispel Magic on Nott (to get rid of the Charm spell): DC of 14. She had to roll a D20 and add her Wisdom modifier, which means that the drow didn&rsquo;t cast this as a spell with a level. This indicates to me that the charm spell was more of an innate spellcasting ability. In addition to this ability, the drow also had some sort of teleportation and possible disguise spells.<br /></p><p>At 3:13 Fjord casts Counterspell (in a super clutch move) on the drow, to stop their teleportation attempt (which would have also taken the hobgoblin with them). Matt had to check something on his phone when Fjord did this, and had Fjord roll a spellcasting ability check (which is typical for Counterspell&ndash;however, this means that the teleport spell was higher than 3rd level, though all teleport spells are, so that doesn&rsquo;t say much). I couldn&rsquo;t glean anything else from this scene (so I&rsquo;d appreciate others&rsquo; opinions!). Travis rolled a 20 so that also doesn&rsquo;t help figure out what level the spell was, haha (but it was sick af).</p><p>At 3:45 Jester casts Locate Object on the scarf she saw. The dialogue (with some irrelevant things removed) was as follows: Matt: &ldquo;Wait, what level was this?&rdquo; Laura: &ldquo;This is second level.&rdquo; Matt: &ldquo;oh&hellip;[insert more dialogue] strangely, it picks up nothing.&rdquo; Laura: &ldquo;it was a fucking disguise.&rdquo; My attention was immediately drawn to Matt asking what level the spell was, which made me think Rakshasa, since they have spell immunity up to a certain level (Level 6, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense with the next spell, so it&rsquo;s definitely not a Rakshasa&ndash;at least with traditional stats), but Laura might very well be right (and I personally think she is for reasons further down).</p><p>At 3:54 Caduceus casts Locate Creature on the drow. The audio goes as follows: Matt [mumbling]: &ldquo;locate creature&hellip; fourth level.&rdquo; [reads more from his phone&hellip; continues reading for a prolonged amount of time&ndash;literally 25 seconds] &ldquo;Okay, you do sense it.&rdquo; And this is why I needed to make this post lol.</p><blockquote><p>From the Locate Creature spell: &ldquo;The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close - within 30 feet - at least once. <i>If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the Effects of a Polymorph spell, this spell doesn&rsquo;t locate the creature</i>.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Which means that the drow wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;in a different form,&rdquo; and yet Jester couldn&rsquo;t sense the scarf. This springs to mind 2 options: 1) the drow has some sort of magical immunity, at least to a certain level&ndash;an idea partially influenced by Matt&rsquo;s attention to spell levels during this fight; 2) the drow was under a Disguise Self spell, which influences appearance but <i>does not change</i>&nbsp;<i>one&rsquo;s form</i>. That would explain why Locate Object didn&rsquo;t work (cast on a scarf that wasn&rsquo;t real) but Locate Creature did (cast on a creature whose <i>form</i>&nbsp;was not changed by a Disguise Self spell).</p><p>Jester later casts Sending, a 3rd level evocation spell. If we look at the possible spell immunity route, Locate Creature and Locate Object are both divination spells, so if the drow has immunity, it&rsquo;s not an immunity to a specific type of magic. The Sending spell goes through, so maybe the drow is immune to spells up to level 2. However, I think the simplest explanation is that the drow was under the effects of a Disguise Self spell. I saw someone mention that the drow may have been a Cambion (sorry I can&rsquo;t find your reply anymore :c ), but the Cambion has Alter Self as a daily spell, and the first line of that spell is&nbsp;&ldquo;You assume a different form,&rdquo; so the Locate Creature wouldn&rsquo;t have gone through. Also the Cambion&rsquo;s Plane Shift teleport ability applies explicitly only to itself, and the drow was going to teleport both themself and the hobgoblin, so the drow&rsquo;s true form is unlikely to be a Cambion.</p><p>The only reason I&rsquo;m including the thought that the drow might be immune to magic up to a certain level is because Matt kept asking about it, which was strange to me.

This is my blog, which I make no promise to keep up with. I'm a bisexual Autistic. Also have ADD. I like cephalopods, especially cuttlefish, and plants, and reading, and many other geeky things. </p><p>More random tidbit: feminist, somewhere in the left politically, and tired of the political landscape but still trying to care. Also a lapsed pagan, it sounds like nonsense but idk how else to describe it. More things- gluten free, and crochet, knitting, and others. Beware of my many random posts as well.</p><p>That is all for now! </p><p>Oh BTW I am bad at tagging things, trying to get better, but its a work in progress.</p>",
