Harry\u2019s not entirely foreign to this, after all he did help his stepfather pick out a ring for his mother. He knows what to do, and how to do it. Niall, on the other hand, has never been to a place like this so he keeps looking around with his eyes widened and mouth in an \u2018o\u2019 shape, just like Alice arriving in Wonderland.</p><p>The lady shows them all the good options they have in the store, briefly explains the price range, and the quality of each. Then something suddenly comes up and she has to excuse herself to run inside for a minute, leaving the boys back with a bunch of rings to choose from.</p><p>\u201cDo you even know her size?\u201d Niall asks, a bit mortified by all these sparkly objects in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wore the promise ring on my pinky and it fits her ring finger so,\u201d says Harry as he gives Niall his hand and the best friend knows exactly what to do. He puts each ring on Harry\u2019s pinky, waits for Harry to say no then moves on to the next one. It takes him a few nos to finally find one that he\u2019s actually satisfied with, just in time the lady returns. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry&hellip;Something came up.
