He takes a leap of faith and Sansa makes it worth it.</small></p><p><small>Modern AU</small></p></blockquote><p>\u201cReally, Jon?\u201d Robb crossed his arms over his chest while he watched how Jon sat down on the green bench in the middle of central park. \u201cAfter all this time you still believe that that stupid woman at the fun fair was right?\u201d Robb shook his head. \u201cBut hey, whatever you want. It\u2019s your life you\u2019re throwing away.\u201d He turned around but looked over his shoulder once more before he disappeared around the corner. \u201cIf you change your mind, you know where we are, right?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded and he opened his backpack to grab the book he was reading.</p><p>He had tried to convince himself over and over again that he should just let it go, that he was acting on the lies of a fake fortune teller. He had tried to force himself to go after Robb, to the football field to practice with the rest of the team even though the summer holiday had not ended yet and the season had not started again. He had wanted to ignore that little voice in his mind, telling him that he just had to have a little faith. </p><p>If he just had a little faith, all would be well.</p><p>At least waiting for the woman of his dreams on the old green bench in the middle of central park had done miracles for his reading challenge. During the last few months he had read more books than he had read in an entire year so far.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Sansa slowed down while she neared him. She had a smile on her face and her bright red hair, tied in a bun on top of her head, danced in the wind. Her forehead and skin was covered in sweat, but somehow she still looked beautiful. \u201cStill spending your afternoons here instead of with your team?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked up from his book and he nodded. \u201cWe play football all year. I just wanna do something else for a while. I\u2019ll be busy enough with the team as soon as school starts again.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if your coach will agree with your slacking and spending your time with your nose in a book instead of running and training.\u201d Sansa sat down next to him and she folded her arms around the bench to enjoy the warm rays of the sun. \u201cI know that if I\u2019d come back after the summer holiday without having at least a three miles run a day, my coach will be absolutely furious with me.\u201d</p><p>Jon closed his book and placed it next to him. \u201cI&rsquo;ve seen you running around here every day. I don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Sansa closed her eyes and leaned back to bath in the summer sun even more. Her legs were long and smooth and Jon resisted to urge to touch them with the tips of his fingers. \u201cBut if you won\u2019t get your ass of that bench soon, you will.\u201d</p><p>Jon shrugged. \u201cThere are more important things than football.\u201d Like meeting the girl of his dreams, like that fortune teller had promised him. Like running into the girl that would conquer his heart and would never let go again for the rest of their shared lives.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Sansa agreed and opened her eyes again. \u201cBut those things won\u2019t get you into college. Unless you have hidden talents I know nothing about, of course.\u201d</p><p>Jon grinned. </p><p>Sansa was a couple of years younger than him, but her confidence went way beyond the amount of confidence he would ever get himself. She knew how to walk and how to talk, but without the arrogance that most other confident girls seemed to combine with it. She had a perfect taste when it came to fashion, but without showing off that she was born into a wealthy family and had more pennies to spend than most others. And most of all: she was kind hearted, warm and welcoming, despite the fact that she was slowly growing into the queen bee of the entire school.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything about me, Sansa.\u201d Jon shook his head and laid out his arms on the bench too, accidentally touching Sansa\u2019s hand. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything about me either, Jon.\u201d Sansa stuck out her tongue and a chuckle escaped his lips. </p><p>He knew a lot more than she probably wanted him to know. It came for free with being best friends with her brother and sharing way too many details while they changed into or out of their sports attire in the locker room. Jon had never told Robb, but secretly Sansa was his favorite subject to talk about. </p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Sansa turned towards him and she crossed her legs. \u201cYou can ask me one question and I will answer honestly. In return I can ask you one question which you\u2019ll have to answer honestly.\u201d The mischievous smile on her face and the glimmering of her eyes should have given away that she was up to something, but Jon took a deep breath and decided to just take a leap of faith. Another one.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI go first.\u201d He cocked his head and furrowed his eyebrows. The frown on his forehead deepened and a few times he opened his mouth to say something, before he closed it again because he had changed his mind.</p><p>But eventually he had to break the silence and had to come up with something. \u201cWhat\u2019s your biggest fear? And I don\u2019t mean the spider or heights kinda one.\u201d Jon almost tripped over his own words. \u201cI mean that real fear, deep down.\u201d Like not being good enough. Like never finding someone who would love him. Like being the best friend and guy next door for the rest of his life. Like never being anyone special.</p><p>Sansa\u2019s smile faded. Her confidence disappeared and for a moment she all of a sudden seemed like the young girl she still was. \u201cI fear so many things.\u201d She whispered. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that none of the dreams I had as a kid will come true, that I won\u2019t marry, that I won\u2019t become a mother, that I won\u2019t get my happily ever after.\u201d She bent her head and avoided his glance, staring at the runners running past them and the children playing in the pool. \u201cI fear falling in love, because I\u2019m afraid that he won\u2019t love me back and that I\u2019ll get my heart broken into a thousand little pieces.\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips. \u201cI fear being bullied because I\u2019m smart and intelligent. I fear guys not looking at me as dating material, because I\u2019m so much more than just a pretty dumb thing they can control and command.\u201d</p><p>Jon moved a little closer towards her. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was actually thinking about doing it, or if his body was already doing it before his mind came up with the idea. \u201cWhy would you be afraid of all those things?\u201d He shook his head in utter disbelief. \u201cAny man not loving you for who you are would be downright stupid!\u201d He raised his voice and he felt his cheeks heating up. \u201cYou&rsquo;re amazing and perfect and really\u2026\u201d Jon scratched the back of his neck. \u201cLike I said, you\u2019ll find someone.\u201d He swallowed and Sansa locked her glance with his for a short moment.</p><p>It felt as if she was attempting to look straight into his soul, but strangely enough it wasn\u2019t unpleasant or uncomfortable. It was pleasant and nice and filled with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s the true reason you spend every day of your summer holiday here on this specific bench?\u201d Sansa changed the subject all of a sudden and Jon cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cRemember that fortune teller on that fun fair at the end of the school year?\u201d Jon waited until Sansa nodded. \u201cShe read the palm of my hand and told me that I\u2019d meet the girl of my dreams and my future wife here, in central park, right in the middle.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. \u201cIt sounds kinda stupid, but this bench is right in the middle and I thought, it doesn\u2019t hurt to try and have a little faith, right?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s lips curled up into a smile. \u201cDid you meet her yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only got to ask one question.\u201d Jon whispered. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do one more.\u201d Sansa cocked her head. \u201cDid you already meet her?\u201d</p><p>Jon thought about it for a short moment. \u201cI guess I did meet the girl of my dreams, yeah.

I don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Sansa closed her eyes and leaned back to bath in the summer sun even more. Her legs were long and smooth and Jon resisted to urge to touch them with the tips of his fingers. \u201cBut if you won\u2019t get your ass of that bench soon, you will.\u201d</p><p>Jon shrugged. \u201cThere are more important things than football.\u201d Like meeting the girl of his dreams, like that fortune teller had promised him. Like running into the girl that would conquer his heart and would never let go again for the rest of their shared lives.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Sansa agreed and opened her eyes again. \u201cBut those things won\u2019t get you into college. Unless you have hidden talents I know nothing about, of course.\u201d</p><p>Jon grinned. </p><p>Sansa was a couple of years younger than him, but her confidence went way beyond the amount of confidence he would ever get himself. She knew how to walk and how to talk, but without the arrogance that most other confident girls seemed to combine with it. She had a perfect taste when it came to fashion, but without showing off that she was born into a wealthy family and had more pennies to spend than most others. And most of all: she was kind hearted, warm and welcoming, despite the fact that she was slowly growing into the queen bee of the entire school.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything about me, Sansa.\u201d Jon shook his head and laid out his arms on the bench too, accidentally touching Sansa\u2019s hand. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything about me either, Jon.\u201d Sansa stuck out her tongue and a chuckle escaped his lips. </p><p>He knew a lot more than she probably wanted him to know. It came for free with being best friends with her brother and sharing way too many details while they changed into or out of their sports attire in the locker room. Jon had never told Robb, but secretly Sansa was his favorite subject to talk about. </p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Sansa turned towards him and she crossed her legs. \u201cYou can ask me one question and I will answer honestly. In return I can ask you one question which you\u2019ll have to answer honestly.\u201d The mischievous smile on her face and the glimmering of her eyes should have given away that she was up to something, but Jon took a deep breath and decided to just take a leap of faith. Another one.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI go first.\u201d He cocked his head and furrowed his eyebrows. The frown on his forehead deepened and a few times he opened his mouth to say something, before he closed it again because he had changed his mind.</p><p>But eventually he had to break the silence and had to come up with something. \u201cWhat\u2019s your biggest fear? And I don\u2019t mean the spider or heights kinda one.\u201d Jon almost tripped over his own words. \u201cI mean that real fear, deep down.\u201d Like not being good enough. Like never finding someone who would love him. Like being the best friend and guy next door for the rest of his life. Like never being anyone special.</p><p>Sansa\u2019s smile faded. Her confidence disappeared and for a moment she all of a sudden seemed like the young girl she still was. \u201cI fear so many things.\u201d She whispered. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that none of the dreams I had as a kid will come true, that I won\u2019t marry, that I won\u2019t become a mother, that I won\u2019t get my happily ever after.\u201d She bent her head and avoided his glance, staring at the runners running past them and the children playing in the pool. \u201cI fear falling in love, because I\u2019m afraid that he won\u2019t love me back and that I\u2019ll get my heart broken into a thousand little pieces.\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips. \u201cI fear being bullied because I\u2019m smart and intelligent. I fear guys not looking at me as dating material, because I\u2019m so much more than just a pretty dumb thing they can control and command.\u201d</p><p>Jon moved a little closer towards her. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was actually thinking about doing it, or if his body was already doing it before his mind came up with the idea. \u201cWhy would you be afraid of all those things?\u201d He shook his head in utter disbelief. \u201cAny man not loving you for who you are would be downright stupid!\u201d He raised his voice and he felt his cheeks heating up. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing and perfect and really\u2026\u201d Jon scratched the back of his neck. \u201cLike I said, you\u2019ll find someone.\u201d He swallowed and Sansa locked her glance with his for a short moment.</p><p>It felt as if she was attempting to look straight into his soul, but strangely enough it wasn\u2019t unpleasant or uncomfortable. It was pleasant and nice and filled with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the true reason you spend every day of your summer holiday here on this specific bench?\u201d Sansa changed the subject all of a sudden and Jon cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cRemember that fortune teller on that fun fair at the end of the school year?\u201d Jon waited until Sansa nodded. \u201cShe read the palm of my hand and told me that I\u2019d meet the girl of my dreams and my future wife here, in central park, right in the middle.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. \u201cIt sounds kinda stupid, but this bench is right in the middle and I thought, it doesn\u2019t hurt to try and have a little faith, right?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s lips curled up into a smile. \u201cDid you meet her yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only got to ask one question.\u201d Jon whispered. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do one more.\u201d Sansa cocked her head. \u201cDid you already meet her?\u201d</p><p>Jon thought about it for a short moment. \u201cI guess I did meet the girl of my dreams, yeah. I just don\u2019t know if she wants to be.\u201d He avoided her glance and nervously his fingers tapped on the old wood of the bench. </p><p>\u201cAsk her.\u201d Sansa spoke firmly and with a shock Jon looked up. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have one more question to ask.

He takes a leap of faith and Sansa makes it worth it.</small></p><p><small>Modern AU</small></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Really, Jon?&rdquo; Robb crossed his arms over his chest while he watched how Jon sat down on the green bench in the middle of central park. &ldquo;After all this time you still believe that that stupid woman at the fun fair was right?&rdquo; Robb shook his head. &ldquo;But hey, whatever you want. It&rsquo;s your life you&rsquo;re throwing away.&rdquo; He turned around but looked over his shoulder once more before he disappeared around the corner. &ldquo;If you change your mind, you know where we are, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon nodded and he opened his backpack to grab the book he was reading.</p><p>He had tried to convince himself over and over again that he should just let it go, that he was acting on the lies of a fake fortune teller. He had tried to force himself to go after Robb, to the football field to practice with the rest of the team even though the summer holiday had not ended yet and the season had not started again. He had wanted to ignore that little voice in his mind, telling him that he just had to have a little faith. </p><p>If he just had a little faith, all would be well.</p><p>At least waiting for the woman of his dreams on the old green bench in the middle of central park had done miracles for his reading challenge. During the last few months he had read more books than he had read in an entire year so far.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa slowed down while she neared him. She had a smile on her face and her bright red hair, tied in a bun on top of her head, danced in the wind. Her forehead and skin was covered in sweat, but somehow she still looked beautiful. &ldquo;Still spending your afternoons here instead of with your team?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looked up from his book and he nodded. &ldquo;We play football all year. I just wanna do something else for a while. I&rsquo;ll be busy enough with the team as soon as school starts again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if your coach will agree with your slacking and spending your time with your nose in a book instead of running and training.&rdquo; Sansa sat down next to him and she folded her arms around the bench to enjoy the warm rays of the sun. &ldquo;I know that if I&rsquo;d come back after the summer holiday without having at least a three miles run a day, my coach will be absolutely furious with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon closed his book and placed it next to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you running around here every day. I don&rsquo;t think you have anything to worry about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Sansa closed her eyes and leaned back to bath in the summer sun even more. Her legs were long and smooth and Jon resisted to urge to touch them with the tips of his fingers. &ldquo;But if you won&rsquo;t get your ass of that bench soon, you will.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon shrugged. &ldquo;There are more important things than football.&rdquo; Like meeting the girl of his dreams, like that fortune teller had promised him. Like running into the girl that would conquer his heart and would never let go again for the rest of their shared lives.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Sansa agreed and opened her eyes again. &ldquo;But those things won&rsquo;t get you into college. Unless you have hidden talents I know nothing about, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon grinned. </p><p>Sansa was a couple of years younger than him, but her confidence went way beyond the amount of confidence he would ever get himself. She knew how to walk and how to talk, but without the arrogance that most other confident girls seemed to combine with it. She had a perfect taste when it came to fashion, but without showing off that she was born into a wealthy family and had more pennies to spend than most others. And most of all: she was kind hearted, warm and welcoming, despite the fact that she was slowly growing into the queen bee of the entire school.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know everything about me, Sansa.&rdquo; Jon shook his head and laid out his arms on the bench too, accidentally touching Sansa&rsquo;s hand. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know everything about me either, Jon.&rdquo; Sansa stuck out her tongue and a chuckle escaped his lips. </p><p>He knew a lot more than she probably wanted him to know. It came for free with being best friends with her brother and sharing way too many details while they changed into or out of their sports attire in the locker room. Jon had never told Robb, but secretly Sansa was his favorite subject to talk about. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Sansa turned towards him and she crossed her legs. &ldquo;You can ask me one question and I will answer honestly. In return I can ask you one question which you&rsquo;ll have to answer honestly.&rdquo; The mischievous smile on her face and the glimmering of her eyes should have given away that she was up to something, but Jon took a deep breath and decided to just take a leap of faith. Another one.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;I go first.&rdquo; He cocked his head and furrowed his eyebrows. The frown on his forehead deepened and a few times he opened his mouth to say something, before he closed it again because he had changed his mind.</p><p>But eventually he had to break the silence and had to come up with something. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your biggest fear? And I don&rsquo;t mean the spider or heights kinda one.&rdquo; Jon almost tripped over his own words. &ldquo;I mean that real fear, deep down.&rdquo; Like not being good enough. Like never finding someone who would love him. Like being the best friend and guy next door for the rest of his life. Like never being anyone special.</p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s smile faded. Her confidence disappeared and for a moment she all of a sudden seemed like the young girl she still was. &ldquo;I fear so many things.&rdquo; She whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that none of the dreams I had as a kid will come true, that I won&rsquo;t marry, that I won&rsquo;t become a mother, that I won&rsquo;t get my happily ever after.&rdquo; She bent her head and avoided his glance, staring at the runners running past them and the children playing in the pool. &ldquo;I fear falling in love, because I&rsquo;m afraid that he won&rsquo;t love me back and that I&rsquo;ll get my heart broken into a thousand little pieces.&rdquo; Sansa licked her dry lips. &ldquo;I fear being bullied because I&rsquo;m smart and intelligent. I fear guys not looking at me as dating material, because I&rsquo;m so much more than just a pretty dumb thing they can control and command.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon moved a little closer towards her. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if he was actually thinking about doing it, or if his body was already doing it before his mind came up with the idea. &ldquo;Why would you be afraid of all those things?&rdquo; He shook his head in utter disbelief. &ldquo;Any man not loving you for who you are would be downright stupid!&rdquo; He raised his voice and he felt his cheeks heating up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re amazing and perfect and really&hellip;&rdquo; Jon scratched the back of his neck. &ldquo;Like I said, you&rsquo;ll find someone.&rdquo; He swallowed and Sansa locked her glance with his for a short moment.</p><p>It felt as if she was attempting to look straight into his soul, but strangely enough it wasn&rsquo;t unpleasant or uncomfortable.
