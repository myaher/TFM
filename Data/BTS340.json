I\u2018ve recently discovered German rap and love it :D</p><p>A/N: I listened to some German rap before writing this and I can definitely see all of the boys liking it! I haven\u2019t mentioned any specific songs or artists in these reactions to keep it generic but <i><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DmDBqkoACakI&amp;t=NjYxNGUyMTMwOWEzYTc2YjUyNzQ2ZTI1MjQxOWEyZjk2MTZiZGRkYSwwMjFlMDM2YTE4MjQyMGIxYjIzNjdjNjZmNjI1YWJmNmI3NWE1ZTQx\" target=\"_blank\">this</a></i> is the song I would recommend!</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Seokjin</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"295\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7bbb14576ed85e2ebfe964507bcaab3/tumblr_inline_pahbkz4s0M1w0npzw_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"295\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><p>You would be sat at your desk with your earphones on engrossed in your studies when Jin would creep up behind you and place his hands on his shoulders causing you to shriek.\u00a0He would be chuckling at your reaction as you would take off your earphones.\u00a0</p><p>&lsquo;What are you listening to so loud that you couldn&rsquo;t hear me come in?&rsquo; He would ask as he pulls up a chair and sat next to you.</p><p>You\u2019d reply 'German rap,&rsquo; and hand him your earphones so he could list.\u00a0He would bop his head to the music. You would go to take your headphones back but he would brush your hand away playfully and carry on listening to your playlist as he went on his phone. You would just go back to studying and accept that you wouldn&rsquo;t be getting your earphones back any time soon.</p><p><b>Yoongi</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/52a2fb50e9e21eb7506a228e1b314e62/tumblr_inline_pahbm0SW6V1w0npzw_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>Yoongi would be on his laptop when you would go over and play a German rap song you had found earlier that day from your phone. He\u2019d question what it was and you would tell him the name of the song. He would nod his head and seem impressed but would pass your phone back to you and go back on his laptop. You\u2019d feel disappointed, it would be rare to find a song that he liked or one he hadn\u2019t already heard. So when you walk away and look back to see him typing the name of the song into his laptop, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to help but smile to yourself.</p><p><b>Hoseok</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"295\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85083b84aaf8756bec56ad0a45479703/tumblr_inline_pahbmuVrCS1w0npzw_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"295\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><p>Your friend would have rung you up telling you she was unable to go to the concert for the German rap artist you had been excited to see for weeks. The disappointment etched on your face would be obvious because Hoseok would ask you what\u2019s wrong. You\u2019d tell him and he would instantly insist on going with you. </p><p>Throughout the concert you would both be dancing and just having the best time (<i>who wouldn\u2019t love going to a concert with Hoseok pls</i>). </p><p>After the concert, you would thank him for coming with you and he would wrap his arm around your shoulders and beam, asking you if there were any other concerts coming up and insist on going to them all because he had that much fun. \u00a0 </p><p><b>Namjoon</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"280\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ad5c07d0f800f791d643c2c957d4f42/tumblr_inline_pahbng6ovG1w0npzw_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"280\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>Namjoon would ask you if you had any song recommendations as he wanted to post one on Twitter but couldn\u2019t think of any songs he wanted to share. You hesitantly play him a German rap song that you thought he would like. He would listen and not say anything for a while leaving you nervous about what he thinks. Before long, he\u2019d be tapping on his phone and you would assume he had got bored of the song and resumed finding another. But you\u2019d receive a notification on your phone seeing he had tweeted the song you\u2019d shown him. \u2018Thanks babe.\u2019 He\u2019d say as he would kiss the top of your head. </p><p><b>Jimin</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"301\" data-orig-width=\"320\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca16ed59e611bdac0473dbf4205e66c7/tumblr_inline_pahbomVqun1w0npzw_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"301\" data-orig-width=\"320\"/></figure><p>You\u2019d take Jimin to a party your friends were hosting so he could finally meet them <i><strike>and because Jimin will take any opportunity to drink</strike></i>. You and Jimin would be sitting on the sofas with some of your friends drinking and talking when one of your friends would play a German rap song and you\u2019d recognise it instantly. You, slightly intoxicated, would cheer \u2018this is one of my favourite songs!\u2019 and rap some of the lyrics you knew with your friends. Jimin, unaware you knew any rap songs, let alone German rap, would be impressed and ask you to play him the song later.</p><p><b>Taehyung</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"323\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f8f6e03c7399a0917d13efebc2f6219/tumblr_inline_pahbp4F5TA1w0npzw_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"323\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><p>You would be driving with Taehyung in the passenger\u2019s seat on your way to get food, when a German rap song would come on your playlist. Before you could even react, Tae would clap his hands and smile that boxy smile you love exclaiming \u2018I love this song Y/N! How do you know it?\u2019 And you would both share how you came across the song whilst jamming in the car and playing other songs that you each liked. </p><p><b>Jungkook</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"302\" data-orig-width=\"266\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14973563e4fa23979337e41a0b66fa15/tumblr_inline_pahbpnOzpW1w0npzw_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"302\" data-orig-width=\"266\"/></figure><p>Jungkook would be out running some errands so you would take the opportunity of being home alone to blast your music loudly. You would be unaware that Jungkook had returned home leaning against the doorframe of the kitchen watching you dance and rap along to some of the lyrics of the German rap song you\u2019d be playing as you cleaned. You\u2019d turn around and jump when you see him standing there and instantly blush from being caught. He would ease your embarrassment though by dancing himself (<i>like the gif no doubt</i>) and you\u2019d both continue cleaning whilst dancing stupidly. \u00a0</p>",
