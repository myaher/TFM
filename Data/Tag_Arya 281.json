He used to mess my hair and call me &ldquo;little \nsister,&rdquo; she remembered, and suddenly there were tears in her eyes.\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></small></p><p><small>Polliver had stolen the sword from her when \nthe Mountain&rsquo;s men took her captive, but when she and the Hound walked \ninto the inn at the crossroads, there it was. The gods wanted me to have\n it. Not the Seven, nor Him of Many Faces, but her father&rsquo;s gods, the \nold gods of the north. The Many-Faced God can have the rest, she \nthought, but he can&rsquo;t have this. - <i>A Feast for Crows\n Arya II\n</i><br /></small></p></blockquote></p>",

        "body": "<p>i had issues with the heroine&rsquo;s journey by marueen murdock but there were so many passages that made me think of arya. the book outlines a woman\u2019s journey to self discovery and identity which is what arya\u2019s arc is truly about. she begins her story as a girl suffering from feelings of inadequacy but on this journey she will reclaim the true sense of self that society (and war) tried to deny her. there are 10 steps but i found the descent to the underworld and mending of the mother/daughter split most interesting</p><blockquote><p>The descent is characterized as a journey to the underworld, the dark night of the soul, the belly of the whale, the meeting of the dark goddess, or simply as depression. It is usually precipitated by a life-changing loss. Experiencing the death of one\u2019s child, parent, or spouse with whom one\u2019s life and identity has been closely intertwined may mark the beginning of the journey to the underworld. Women often make their descent when a particular role, such as daughterhood, motherhood, lover, or spouse, comes to an end.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>this is exactly what arya goes through after the red wedding. she\u2019s experienced great losses before but this crushes her. that last bit of hope to be reunited with her family (her pack) and return home is shattered. arya becomes extremely depressed. she feels the loss of her daughterhood deeply thinking:\u00a0<i>She was no one&rsquo;s daughter now. She was no one. Not Arya, not Weasel, not Nan nor Arry nor Squab, not even Lumpyhead. She was only some girl who ran with a dog by day, and dreamed of wolves by night. </i>this sets arya on a path to braavos where she enters the house of black and white</p><blockquote><p>\n\nIn the underworld there is no sense of time; time is endless and you cannot rush your stay. There is no morning, day, or night. It is densely dark and unforgiving. This all-pervasive blackness is moist, cold, and bone-chilling. There are no easy answers in the underworld; there is no quick way out. Silence pervades when the wailing ceases. One is naked and walks on the bones of the dead.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>the book uses the underworld as a metaphorical place but this is literally the environment arya experiences in the house of black and white and even braavos in general. its dark and cold and foggy. \n\n arya loses all sense of time while she\u2019s in the temple caring for the dead and learning the arts of the faceless men.\n\nits a place that one could easily become lost in and one that will not be easy to escape.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAt each of the seven gates she relinquishes aspects of her identity. This \u201cunveiling suggests the removal of old illusions and false identities that may have served in the upper world but count for nothing in the Netherworld.\u201d\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>in order to stay in the underworld arya had to rid herself of all her possessions. she threw everything she had into the water. even her clothes. all the symbols of her false identities - of which there were many - were not welcome. only no one can serve there. arya walks into the underworld empty handed and naked but she hides the symbol of her true self in the stone. arya will reclaim it after being\u00a0\u201creborn\u201d in the dark abyss of the hob&amp;w.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nShe may feel an incredible sense of emptiness, of being left out, shunned, left behind, without value.

He was not. He was not. </i>Arya\n kept repeating to herself. It had been a stupid bet Hot Pie from the \nInn had proposed Gendry, with a easiness you normally didn\u2019t see between\n a baker and a crown prince. Arya had obviously opposed the bet, \nmultiple times, and she told him she wouldn\u2019t accept it, so no, she \ncouldn\u2019t believe he was coming her way.</p><p>\u201cMy son,\u201d Robert yelled with a laugh, \u201chave you chosen a Queen of Love and Beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace,\u201d he answered and walked up to her, \u201cMy lady,\u201d he greeted her, \u201cI offer this crown to Lady Arya Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered with a smile to his own, as Mother and Sansa tried to stop her. \u201cNo,\u201d she repeated.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWe\u2019re quite in a impasse now, my lady. What do you purpose?\u201d Gendry asked smiling - he knew why she was saying no, to challenge him. <br/></p><p>\u201cA competition. You win, I accept the crown; I win, I get the crown and name who I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, bring on another competition,\u201d the King yelled from the place where he was seeing everything. \u201cChoose, girl. Choose. A fighting spirit like my Lyanna.\u201d Silence followed after that, as it was expected when King Robert brought up Lyanna - he had never married, saying that there would be no one to compare. But without heirs, he had chosen a few of his bastards to legitimize - Gendry had been one of the oldest and one of the closest to him, right here in King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>\u201cPrince Gendry, if you need the pick,\u201d Arya finally spoke when King Robert had looked up from his grief.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArchery, then.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, and now with the hand free of the crown, he offered it to Arya, to walk her down from the stands. As people prepared the camp and King Robert set the rules: \u201cthree shots, the one who gets closer to the center wins.\u201d</p><p>They chosed their bows and arrows and they were ready, Arya offering Gendry the first shots.</p><p>\u201cLadies should go first,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Prince, the right is yours,\u201d she argued and the King told Gendry to go; and then Arya added in a quieter voice only for his benefit, \u201cAnd I\u2019m no lady, Gendry.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and made the three shots: two on the center and then one on the second ring.
