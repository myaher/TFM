        "body": "<p><b><i>based on this song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWM5P2GgT_E\">(X)</a></i></b></p><p>It took him a while after everything happened to even go near Peter\u2019s side of the lab. It had been months, maybe even a year already since he\u2019d be gone. It felt like a million lifetimes. Tony lost track of time when all of the days merged into one long nightmare.</p><p>He only started looking through all of the stuff he had shoved in the desk drawers because May was looking for one of Peter\u2019s old notebooks. She couldn\u2019t find it in his bedroom and of course, the only other place that managed to collect all of the kid\u2019s things was in the tower. Either in the spare room that had slowly turned into Peter\u2019s or his section in the lab.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mean to make it an all day affair, but every little thing he found had him distracted for a while.</p><p>He clicked on the old DS he had shoved in the top drawer and it still had his Animal Crossing game inside. Tony winced as he walked the little guy character (Peter named him Han Solo. Of course, he did) around the town, through the weeds that had taken over every spot on the ground. Peter used to always make sure to check his town routinely so there was never one weed in sight.</p><p>There was a plastic spoon in the bottom drawer that once lit up when you clicked the button. It was red with a faded cartoon picture of both Iron Man and Spider-Man on it. Peter had gotten it out of a box of cereal when the public first started noticing Spider-Man and Iron Man\u2019s unlikely partnership. He had it hidden in here so no one ever used it and \u201ctainted its awesomeness\u201d.</p><p>Peter kept his fidget toy, one of many, on his desk. It had been a present from Tony when he noticed how the kid was always fidgeting. Especially when he was sitting in the lab doing nothing else but homework or something that didn\u2019t involve much moving. He threw it to the kid one day after school nonchalantly. He\u2019d been hesitant to use it until Tony told him about the collection of stress balls he had; there wasn\u2019t ever a time when he didn\u2019t have one in his pocket. Tony had spoiled the kid with dozens of fidget toys; some he loved, some he liked, and some he wasn\u2019t a big fan of. When Tony was in a store, usually a gas station, they\u2019d sell them by the cash register and Tony bought one he thought Peter would like.

And with the high quality the camera took pictures in and his compute showed pictures on, it was almost like Peter was right in front of him again.

Whoever he was with when he replaced it, he threw an arm around their shoulder and took a selfie. Tony was usually the one caught, though he had a few with May, Ned, Happy, Rhodey, and Pepper.</p><p>Tony was in this one. He was staring down at one of his tablets, not giving the camera a glance. But Peter was there, next to him on the couch, pulling him in close and smiling. Tony wished he had looked up\u2026just to see that smile on the kid\u2019s face. But he didn\u2019t. Because that had be a normal thing for Peter to do. Tony never thought there\u2019d be a day where he wasn\u2019t there to fill up empty SD card and start with an impromptu photo session.</p><p>He\u2019d never get a chance to do that again.<br>He took that moment for granted just as often as Peter took the picture. \u00a0 </p><p>He swiped to the next photo and smiled.

Why didn\u2019t you ever take a fucking second just to look? Look up at what you had. The kid was always there. And now, he\u2019d never be there again.</p><p>He swiped through the dozens of photos Peter took of Tony in the lab, mixed with a few of the bots hanging around.</p><p>(Tony\u2019s favorite was the one he took himself. Peter, U, and Dum-E were sleeping on the floor in a sea of blankets Peter had set up for the four of them to watch a movie. He had made sure to drape a blanket over each of them.)</p><p>He smiled when he realized what the majority of this SD card was full of: Peter and Tony\u2019s roadtrip to Florida over the summer. They had a big trip planned to Disney World for the kid\u2019s 17th birthday. He\u2019d always wanted to go to Disney World and one of the parks was practically throwing up Star Wars. There was a ride, character meet and greets, parades, firework, shows, and more just for this movie.</p><p>So, it was a no brainer where Peter was going to celebrate his day.</p><p>Except there was one problem: Peter was deathly afraid of planes. Ever since the night he crashed the Stark plane on Coney Island. So, flying to Florida was not an option. At least not for Peter.</p><p>Tony remembered when they surprised him with the tickets and told him about the private jet that would get them there in no more than 2 hours. He hands started to shake. Tony didn\u2019t hesitate before saying Peter didn\u2019t have to take the plane. (\u201cI\u2019m thinking about driving down, if you want to join. I could use the company\u201d)</p><p>Sure, one day, Tony would help Peter get over his fear of flying, but he didn\u2019t need to do that when he was going to celebrate his birthday. He didn\u2019t want the kid to dread the trip. So, Tony and Peter left two days before everyone else did and they started their roadtrip.</p><p>It was the best trip Tony had ever taken. He enjoyed the car ride to and back more than the actual vacation, probably.</p><p>The collection of vacation photos started with Tony packing the car with their suitcases. Tony was looking over his shoulder as a bag on the top was about to fall over on his head. (\u201cA little help, Parker?\u201d).</p><p>Tony steering the wheel with one hand and shoving a fast food burger in his mouth with the other. (\u201cWho the fuck puts mustard on a burger? Are their taste buds that dead?\u201d)</p><p>A random horse Peter had made Tony stop driving for suddenly by screaming, \u201cStop!\u201d (\u201cChrist, Parker, you\u2019re lucky no one was behind me. Don\u2019t do that again.\u201d \u201cBut he\u2019s so pretty, Mr. Stark.\u201d)</p><p>Peter\u2019s dirty converse kicked up on the dash and a blur of Tony\u2019s hand, swatting his feet off. (\u201cUnless you want to clean the dashboard with your toothbrush, get your filthy feet off.\u201d)</p><p>A sunset Peter made him spend 10 minutes driving to get the perfect shot. (\u201cPeter, the sun is going to be gone by the time you find a spot you like.\u201d)</p><p>One that Tony took of Peter fast asleep in the passenger seat, drooling slightly with his head at angle that couldn\u2019t have been good for his neck. (\u201cHow do you even sleep like that?\u201d)</p><p>Then the next one was Peter sleeping again, this time after Tony leaned over and fixed him so he was in a comfortable position. He leaned the seat back, laid his head in a normal position, and covered him in a blanket. (\u201cSee? I take care of you.\u201d)</p><p>He continued to skim through the pictures and found the selection of pictured from the actual trip itself. Peter had gone crazy with photos. LIke he snapped a picture of every little thing. He was like those tourists they made fun of in Times Square.</p><p>Tony and May had taken a lot of them too when Peter wanted to be in the pictures. The kid almost cried when he saw all the Star Wars shit. There was a show that had an entire dedication to Han Solo, and Tony actually saw him wipe at his eyes quickly. Tony had rolled his eyes, ruffling the kid\u2019s hair.</p><p>He continued through the hundred of pictures for what had to have been hours before he reached the last one. Tony packing a full car that overflowing with bags and bags of Disney souvenirs.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t realize he had been crying until there were no more photos to distract him. He sniffled and wiped his wet cheeks.</p><p>That was only one SD card\u2026the kid had dozens in his drawer that Tony could look through.</p><p>He always took a picture of everything. His face was always behind the lens, taking a photo of something.</p><p>Tony told him to put the camera down and live in the moment, but Peter said he didn\u2019t want to forget a single moment.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t understand how he could when it was all so clear in Tony\u2019s mind. He could still close his eyes and remember what had happened in each photo before and after it was taken.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need these photos to remember Peter.</p><p>Peter was the most vivid memory in his mind every time he closed his eyes.</p><p>Sometimes it was a blessing, sometimes it was a curse.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Probably one of my favourite characters of all time (even though I grew tired of the hype surrounding him around 2014 and became an anti briefly. Don\u2019t ask me to explain). Usually he is the type of character I wouldn\u2019t like. The whole snarky quip every minute, stupendous intelligence and/or wealth shtick annoys me (it\u2019s part of the reason I can\u2019t stand Deadpool). To me what sets Tony apart is that he has substance and he faces consequences. By time Infinity War starts, he can sneeze and that would probably have ramifications which is great in a cinematic universe where heartfelt moments are constantly undercut by annoying jokes. I love how emotional he is and I love that his emotions aren\u2019t just anger. I love that he reaches out to people instead of being a lone wolf. I love that reaching out to people doesn\u2019t mean he is warm and cuddly and right at home with that person immediately. I love how often he is wrong and that his movies aren\u2019t interested in presenting him as morally impeccable or physically unbeatable. I love how he saves himself and others and in turn is saved regularly. I love his relationships with his close friends and colleagues.\u00a0</p><p>I also love that he mentally ill. His mental illness was examined in a period of time when I was accepting the fact that I\u2019m not well. It was cathartic to see someone like him also go through it, almost like I was being told it\u2019s not my fault and I\u2019m not weak (which my therapist wasn\u2019t interested in saying lmao). I love how his mental illness wasn\u2019t softened or made easy to deal with. It was wonderful not to feel alone, even for a moment.</p><p>Basically the more I thought about Tony, the more I liked him.</p>",
