The \nprevious night had been almost sleepless, both of them enjoying their \ncompany far into the early hours of the night. So when Harry woke up, \nthe sun was already shining bright into the bedroom. He watched his girl\n sleep, her beautiful features so relaxed that it had him in awe. It was\n often that he didn\u2019t understand how he could\u2019ve ever deserved her, but \nhe wasn\u2019t going to question it. He didn\u2019t want to \ndisturb her peaceful slumber, but he wanted to cuddle up to her, he just\n couldn\u2019t help it. He carefully placed on arm around her frame, slightly\n adjusting her position so he could pull her into him a bit. <br/></p><p>(Y/N) stirred a little in her sleep, her eyes fluttered for a bit before she finally opened them. <br/></p><p>\u201cGood morning beautiful\u201d, Harry said cheerfully, yet sleepily, which made (Y/N) smile.</p><p>\u201cGood\n morning\u201d, she lightly returned before rubbing her eyes to get the sleep\n out of them. When she was done, she returned the embrace that Harry had\n pulled her into. \u201c \u2018m a bit sore\u201d, she mumbled when she had started to \nturn.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too. Was worth it, though\u201d, Harry said and kissed \nher on her blushing cheek. She traced her fingers lightly above the \ntender skin on his neck, smiling lightly to herself. <br/></p><p>\u201cD\u2019you leave a hickey?\u201d, he said.</p><p>\u201cMight\u2019ve\u201d,\n she smirked. Yes, she definitely did. And it was massive, the purple \nsticking out from the colour of his skin in a beautiful contrast.</p><p>\u201cMight\u2019ve\n left some on you, too\u201d, he said and touched her collarbone. She \ngiggled, before she cupped his cheek to pull him into a lazy kiss. <br/></p><p>\u201cI love you\u201d, she mumbled against his lips. She felt him smile at that.</p><p>\u201cI\n love you\u201d, he returned those three, little, perfect words and she felt \nas if her heart could burst from all the happiness and love. <br/></p><p>\u201cGod,\n I can\u2019t wait until we get to share mornings like this every day\u201d, he \nmumbled, clearly not thinking twice about what he said there. <br/></p><p>She,\n however, pulled back from their intimate embrace, her brows furrowed in\n confusion. \u201cAnd when would that be?\u201d, she asked. She felt like she \nmissed out on something very important. <br/></p><p>\u201cI mean, one day, we\u2019ll move in together, won\u2019t we?\u201d, he said, thinking that this was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>\u201cWe\n never talked about this Harry, how can you assume that I want that?\u201d, \nshe said. She was becoming very defensive, she could feel that, but she \njust couldn\u2019t stop herself. <br/></p><p>Harry felt like he was missing \nout something important, too. He could feel her untangle herself from \nhim, so he grabbed her wrist gently. She flinched at the touch, so he \npulled away.<br/></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you\u201d, he said, still not \ncompletely understanding her now, \u201cI mean we won\u2019t move in together \ntomorrow, right? I just meant, like, one day. When we\u2019re both ready for \nit.\u201d He reached out for her hand once more, this time she let him hold \nit. But the crease between her eyebrows was as prominent as ever. \u201c \u2018m \nsorry\u201d, he mumbled as he gently kissed her hand. <br/></p><p>She sighed. Why did she always have to be such a prick? <br/></p><p>\u201c\n \u2018m sorry, too. I didn\u2019t mean to lash out like this. God, I\u2019m a horrible\n person\u201d, she mumbled as he rested her head against his chest again.</p><p>\u201c \u2018s okay\u201d, he mumbled in her hair.

She \nkissed it gently, from his shoulder to the bow of the bne right under \nhis neck. Then, she began to work her kisses up his neck, finally \ngetting a little moan out of him. She positioned herself on his lap \nwhile tracing her lips up further, kissing his neck a little harder this\n time, but carefully avoiding the bruise she&rsquo;d left the night earlier. \nHe put his hands on her hips to steady her, momentarily forgetting about\n the little argument from earlier.</p><p>But she still felt like he wasn&rsquo;t going to let it go that easily.</p><hr /><p><i>You can find Part Two <a href=\"http://kissykindness.tumblr.com/post/183986338605/move-in-with-me-part-2\" target=\"_blank\"><b>here</b></a>.<br /></i></p><p><i>View all of my posts <a href=\"http://kissykindness.tumblr.com/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\"><b>here </b></a>or request something <a href=\"http://kissykindness.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\"><b>here</b></a>.</i><br /></p>",

She\u2019s finally updating, we\u2019re so proud. This is basically my take on the\u00a0\u2018noticed in the middle of the crowd\u2019 trope. It\u2019s 6:48 Am, I started at like 1, I am tired, the sun is out, have fun you horny fucks.

It may have took you twenty-one years to go to your first concert, but it was well worth the wait. You\u2019d spent the whole night singing, screaming and dancing to your heart\u2019s content, you couldn\u2019t believe you\u2019d been missing out on this experience all your life, you felt so safe and so happy, surrounded by people who gathered for the simplicity of enjoying music.</p><p>The beautiful curly haired boy danced and jumped around the stage as he sung, reading signs and teasing fans in between sets, the energy surrounding you making you feel unstoppable. Your heart nearly stopped when he\u2019d turned to you, walking his way to the edge of the stage and hushing you for screaming just as everyone else quieted, a shade of light red coating your cheeks at all the eyes suddenly turning towards you.</p><p>You\u2019d attached your phone to the radio so you could listen to the album on your way to the bar, belting out the lyrics and picturing yourself back in the sea of people. You were always a fan of One Direction&ndash; you recalled crying when Zayn left and laughed momentarily, oh how things had changed&ndash;, but you\u2019d never looked into Harry\u2019s music until recently and when you found out he was coming into town you jumped at the chance to buy a ticket. Harry had always been charming and handsome, his beauty was timeless, but he had never looked better than he did as he stood on stage and sung his heart out, clearly in his element.</p><p>Your childhood crush was clearly redeveloping as your heart pounded at just the thought of him, everything about him was perfect from his cute little smile and accent to the silver rings that adorned his fingers. Absolutely, positively, drop dead gorgeous, you thought to yourself as you pulled into the parking lot of the bar. \u00a0</p><p>The cold air nipped at your warm cheeks as you made your way to the entrance, glancing over at the shining sign of the hotel that stood next to it. The metal was cold as you wrapped your hand around it, pulling one of the doors open and being instantly enveloped in the warm air.</p><p>While on your way to the bar you tripped on a loose floorboard, losing your balance momentarily and grabbing onto the shoulder of the stranger standing in front of you so you wouldn\u2019t fall on your face. When your balance was regained you looked up, your eyes meeting those of the stranger who\u2019d saved you from an embarrassing tumble. Your apology caught in your throat as your heart stopped, or maybe it was just beating so fast you couldn\u2019t feel it, either way the last eyes you were expecting to be met with were those of the boy you\u2019d spent the last hour watching as he danced around the stage. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cY\u2019following me round?\u201d He says, breaking the silence lingering between the two of you, his eyes brightening momentarily as they met yours and recalled the face in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not.\u201d You reply quickly, surprised he even remembered you and quickly squishing the mere idea of you following him. You weren\u2019t a creepy stalker and it was the last thing you wanted to be labelled as.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019a joke, love. Did you enjoy the show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, loved it. It was a wonderful escape from everything else in my life.\u201d </p><p>\u201cM\u2019glad you enjoyed it, but wha\u2019s wrong with everything else? Actually, hold that thought, we\u2019re gonna talk about this over a few drinks.\u201d Harry says, asking the bartender for two margaritas and tapping the seat next to him for you to sit. You hesitantly took the chair, taking a deep breath as you waited for the bartender to finish your drinks. Harry\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t leave you for a second, scanning over you like he was looking for an answer etched in your skin.</p><p>\u201cSo, is that tattoo from my song, by chance?\u201d He says, pulling your left arm towards him and gesturing to the words \u2018have the time of your life\u2019 scribbled there.</p><p>\u201cNo, I got this a couple years ago when I turned eighteen actually. Uhm, it\u2019s what I tell myself when I want to do something but I\u2019m too scared, guess it\u2019s kinda lame.\u201d You explain, grabbing one of the margaritas when the bartender slid them over.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019not lame at all, I think it\u2019s quite cool. Now, tell me wha\u2019s wrong, love.\u201d Harry says, turning towards you and taking a sip of his drink. </p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 life, I suppose. I\u2019ve been really stressed lately and I guess I just need a night off.\u201d You say, trying your best to explain the way you were feeling, still unsure as to why he cared.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah, I get it. I hope my show helped relieve some stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be under a lot of stress, what do you do to help when it gets too much?\u201d A smirk played on Harry\u2019s lips the second the words left your mouth, looking down at his drink and choking back a laugh. A jolt of confidence ran through you, you weren\u2019t sure if it was the alcohol in your system or the excitement from the amazing night you had, but something encouraged you to say</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could destress together sometime, then.\u201d Harry paused, looking over at you</p><p>\u201cS\u2019naughty of you, angel.\u201d He says, licking his lips and giving you a look that made your knees weak</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019re you gonna do about it?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019d be better off imaging what I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not sure you could handle the real thing, petal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d You say, turning in your chair to face him, your brow raised as you bathed in your newfound confidence. His hand was on your chin in seconds, leaning forward to whisper in your ear.</p><p>\u201cI will not hesitate to tie you up, pin you down and fuck you til\u2019 you\u2019re screaming. Don\u2019t test me, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLot of bark and no bite, so far.\u201d You say, shrinking under his glare before jumping at the bang of Harry slamming the money for your drinks on the table and tugging you harshly out of the bar by your arm. You struggled to keep up with his fast pace, his hand holding tightly onto yours as you walked through the doors of the fancy hotel next door. The confidence you had mustered faded away with the wind, causing you to feel abruptly more nervous.</p><p>The elevator ride to his room was quiet, tension filling the air and making it hard to breathe. You began to wonder what you\u2019d gotten yourself into, glancing at the curly haired boy who towered over you and thinking about what he was truly capable of. You figured your flirting was harmless and that he\u2019d never bite, but now you were almost hoping he would.</p><p>The walk to the hotel room itself was short, Harry quickly sliding his card in and swinging the door open, holding it there for you and glaring at you as you walked in. It was nice, although you didn\u2019t get to look long before Harry was pinning you against the wall. His lips wasted no time attacking your neck, \u00a0sucking, licking and biting at the sensitive skin, your fingers fiddling with the buttons of his shirt for a second before Harry smacked your hand away, harshly pinning them beside you on the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got quite the mouth on you, pet. Might aswell put it to good use.\u201d Harry says, pushing you to your knees and staring down at you as you got to work on his belt. \u00a0You kept glancing up at him, having trouble believing all of this is real.</p><p>You pulled Harry\u2019s pants down his legs, rubbing him slowly over his underwear before catching his warning glare and pulling them down to meet his pants, his cock springing up as you freed it from it\u2019s restraints. You tried your best to contain your shock at his large size, taking his cock in your hand and pumping slowly. Harry let out a quiet hiss at the feeling, tilting his head back and basking in the pleasure as you ran your tongue up the underside of his dick, taking your time to lick around the tip, teasing him as much as you could without getting a punishment before hollowing out your cheeks and attempting to take the rest of him in your mouth, your pumping hand helping you out on your way down. Harry entangled his hands in your hair, pushing your head lightly, you gagged as his tip hit the back of your throat but didn\u2019t cease your movements, pumping, licking and sucking as you silently begged for his cum. \u00a0</p><p>When the feeling in the pit of \u00a0your stomach became too much you decided to reach down and play with your clit as you sucked Harry off.</p><p>\u201cNone o\u2019 that.\u201d Harrry said when he noticed your fingers working against yourself, reaching down to grab your hands and place them on either of his thighs. \u00a0You began to moan against him, your fingers working to relieve some of the pressure, closing your eyes as you ran your tongue around his tip, bringing it to the top and kitten licking slowly, tasting his precum on your tongue as you did so.</p><p>Harry\u2019s head was thrown back against the wall, mouth hanging open and choking back moans. You tried your best to focus on the task at hand, but the almost angelic sound of his moans was distracting, and you wanted nothing more than his hands trailing all over your body. </p><p>\u201cOkay that\u2019s enough, angel, think m\u2019gonna cum.\u201d He groaned under his breath, but you ignored him and instead began pumping faster, hollowing your cheeks out as much as you could while simultaneously staring up at him innocently. You closed your eyes as you prepared to feel his cum shoot out in hot ropes, coating your tongue, but instead felt the harsh tug of your hair and his dick slip out of your mouth.</p><p>Your eyes met his, and damn did he look angry. You clamped your thighs together as you stared up at him, trying your best to suppress some of the pressure that\u2019d been building up all night. </p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve misheard me, petal, because surely you wouldn\u2019t be so disobedient as to misbehave so soon.\u201d He said, running his thumb along your bottom lip and watching as you slowly took it between your lips. You ran your tongue along his digit, waiting patiently for whatever might come next.</p><p>Harry used his other hand to pull you to your feet by your hair, backing you up until you hit the side of the bed, sitting down and staring up at Harry as he ran his fingers through your hair. He took a seat next to you, causing you to glance over at him in confusion. Harry raised his brow at you and glanced beside him, signaling for you to lay over his lap. You obeyed, not looking to get into any more trouble than you\u2019d already gotten yourself in. </p><p>He massaged your ass slowly as you laid there, mentally preparing yourself for the sharp pain of his hand coming down against your ass. Harry slid his hand down your ass and to your thigh, softly nudging your thigh to open your legs, moving your underwear to the side before swiping a finger through your folds. You opened your legs a little more, focusing all too much on his fingers, waiting anxiously for his next move. He began rubbing slow circles around your hole, reaching forward to play with your clit momentarily before moving his hand back and abruptly shoving his middle and pointer finger inside of you, pumping them in and out rapidly. His other hand continued to massage your ass slowly, his tongue shooting out to lick along his bottom lip.</p><p>You buried your face into the bedsheets, biting your lip to suppress the moans and grinding back into Harry\u2019s fingers, wanting more. You\u2019d imagined Harry\u2019s fingers would feel nice, but the real thing was so much better. Harry used his other hand to move your hair out of your face before continuing to massage you, his rough fingers feeling amazing against your bare ass.</p><p>\u00a0You squirmed under Harry\u2019s touch, your hips grinding into his thigh, hoping to feel some pressure on your clit, loving the way he made you feel. The way his fingers could reach so much farther than yours made your toes curl, thoughts of what he was capable ran through your head as you slowly approached your orgasm. You lifted your head to glance back at Harry, catching the beautiful sight of him biting down harshly on his lip as he stared at his fingers working themselves in and out of you, presumably soaked in your juices.</p><p>You laid your head on your arm, not taking your eyes away from Harry as your legs began to shake, your orgasm fast approaching. You swallowed down your moans, trying not to make too much noise and disturb the other residents of the hotel. Your walls fluttered around Harry\u2019s finger, a moan involuntarily tumbling out of your mouth as you came around his fingers. Your orgasm washed over you, making you tired, but both the relaxation and drowsiness you felt were taken away with a harsh slap to your ass. </p><p>\u201cDid I say you could cum?\u201d Harry says, placing another rough smack to your ass. You laid there, trying to catch your breath before being yanked up to be eye level with Harry.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question and I expect you to answer, petal.\u201d He said, giving another smack to your ass. You shook your head no in response to his question, jolting forward quickly when you felt three more smacks on your ass. </p><p>\u201cUse your words.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, didn\u2019t what, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say I could cum. I didn\u2019t know I had to ask.\u201d You say softly, your stinging ass only turning you on more. He moved your legs onto the bed so you were laying down before reaching into the drawer and pulling out a pair of hot pink fluffy handcuffs. Your heart skipped a beat when you saw them, eyes trailing over to meet his.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay love, but m\u2019afraid tha\u2019 since you don\u2019t know how to behave, i\u2019m gonna have to tie you up.\u201d Harry says, clicking the handcuffs around your wrists \u201cJust tell me if you want to stop.\u201d </p><p>You nodded, agreeing to tell him if it was too much as you slowly rubbed your thighs together. Harry climbed onto the bed, spreading your thighs and sitting inbetween them. His eyes wandered your body freely while his hands left teasing touches along your thighs. Harry\u2019s eyes met yours as he reached up and slid his fingers in your mouth, watching as you sucked your juices off his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAlrigh\u2019 angel, I\u2019m a bit of a narcissist so if we\u2019re gonna do this m\u2019gonna need you to be loud for me.\u201d Harry says, leaning down so his face is hovering above your own, his hard on pressed flat against your core.</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d You say, taking a deep breath and tugging lightly at your restraints. Harry hummed in approval before leaning down to leave kisses along your neck</p><p>\u201cCall me daddy.\u201d He whispered in your ear, his hot breath fanning out across your neck and sending a shiver down your spine. You paused for a second, processing what he said and gulping down the clump in your throat.</p><p>\u201cDaddy.\u201d You mumbled under your breath, tugging lightly on your restraints. Harry groaned, pulling your underwear down the length of your legs and carelessly discarding it, giving himself a few languid strokes before lining himself up to your entrance, glancing up at you for approval before pushing himself in slowly, wanting you to feel every throbbing inch he had to give. Harry filled you up all the way, his cock stretching you in the best way possible. It took you a minute to adjust, but when you did you gave Harry a quick nod and he began thrusting slowly, moaning into your ear as he felt your tight cunt wrapped around him.</p><p>Harry began to speed up when he felt you pushing back into him, holding himself up with his arm as he slowly fucked himself into you. He slowly began to build his pace, savoring the moans that tumbled over your lips, his lips kissing and biting down your neck, sucking momentarily on your sweet spot before continuing his way down to your breast, taking one in his mouth and using his hand to massage the other.</p><p>Your moans only cheered Harry on, encouraging him to go faster and harder with each thrust, fucking you into the bed as hard as he could. Harry stared down at you, watching your eyes roll into the back of your head as he fucked you, his and trailing up the bridge of your breasts and making its way to your neck, slightly cutting off your airways as he choked you. You dug your teeth into your bottom lip as you watched him fuck you, his eyes filled with lust as he relentlessly rammed himself into you.</p><p>\u201cYou look so good, angel, taking my dick. Such a dirty little girl in such a pretty little package. Your mouth gets you in a lot of trouble, eh?\u201d Harry says, spreading your legs to get deeper inside you. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t help the moans that poured past your lips as you tugged, hurting your wrists as you reached for your clit and momentarily forgot about your restraints. You whined, giving the handcuffs a few more light tugs as a show of your disapproval.</p><p>\u201cAwh, what, love? Y\u2019don\u2019t like the handcuffs?\u201d Harry asked in a teasing tone, you shook your head in response \u201cToo bad, should\u2019ve thought about that before you were a disobedient little slut. Y\u2019just lucky I didn\u2019t fuck you in the bathroom of tha\u2019 bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, daddy, I wanna touch you. I\u2019ll be a good girl I promise.\u201d You say, his pace not slowing down for even a second as he trailed his hand up from your throat to your jaw, squeezing harshly.</p><p>\u201cShut up and take my dick.\u201d He says, putting your legs over his shoulder and his hand back around your throat, speeding up as he hit a new angle that drove you wild, digging your fingernails into his back and dragging them down. You were sure not to hold any moans back, pushing your head back into your pillow as Harry fucked you, using the hand that was around your throat to play with your clit. Your legs shook beside his head as he hit all the right spots, tightening his hand around your throat when he felt you squeeze around his cock.</p><p>A loud moan shot from you mouth as you came around his dick, but he didn\u2019t slow down as he chased his own high, putting the fingers that just seconds ago were playing with your clit into his mouth, moaning at the taste as he released his load in you, hot ropes of cum shooting deep inside you. </p><p>You both relaxed, taking a moment to enjoy your orgasms before Harry pulled out, watching as his cum dripped out of you. He ran a finger through your folds once again, collecting a mixture of his cum and your juices on his finger and bringing it up to your mouth where you happily took the digits into your mouth, the salty-sweet concoction coating your taste buds as you gave Harry a wink.</p><p>Harry took his fingers back once you\u2019d licked it all off and dipped his head back down between your thighs.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think we were done yet, did you love?\u201d He asks, licking a fat stripe up your sensitive, wet pussy. You moaned quietly at the feeling, once again tugging at the cuffs that bound your hands as you forgot they were there. Harry wraps his arm below your thighs, holding your red ass in his hands as he ate you out. He moaned at the taste, the vibrations hitting you in your core and flowing throughout you. You lifted your hips, grinding into his tongue as you felt him slip in and out of you, using his tongue to play with your clit and fuck you. </p><p>Harry looked like he was enjoying himself, finding it hard to choose between licking up inside you and sucking on your clit, finding a middle ground by sucking on and licking at your clit while finger fucking you. </p><p>\u201cGonna cum for me, like a good little girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not sure I can.\u201d You say, taking a deep breath that ended in a moan.</p><p>\u201cSure you can, a dirty little girl like you, even ran that slutty little mouth of yours, time to own up to it, petal. Cum on my fucking tongue, I wanna taste you and feel you cum all over my face jus\u2019 like you did with my cock.\u201d Harry said, switching positions so he was using his fingers to play with your clit and licking up inside you with his tongue. </p><p>Your orgasm hit you like a ton of bricks, racking your body and leaving you fatigued. Harry licked up your release before making his way up your body and giving you a wet kiss. You moaned into the kiss as you tasted yourself. You playfully bit at his bottom lip before retreating back into his mouth, kissing each other slowly as you returned from your highs.</p><p>Harry left a final peck on your lips before laying next to you, where you looked around for your underwear as you prepared to leave, spotting it on the lamp shade and standing to grab it. Your legs felt weak as you went to stand, so you were glad when Harry grabbed your hand and pulled you to sit back down.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ah ah,\u201d He said, pulling you back up to him and burying your face into his chest as he pulled the blankets over the two of you \u201cyou never told me about wha\u2019s wrong, plus there\u2019s traffic, you won\u2019t be home til\u2019 late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did tell you what was wrong, stress, remember? Sounds like you\u2019re just trying to make an excuse so I\u2019ll stay and cuddle with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that too.\u201d</p>",

She\u2019s finally updating, we\u2019re so proud. This is basically my take on the\u00a0\u2018noticed in the middle of the crowd\u2019 trope. It\u2019s 6:48 Am, I started at like 1, I am tired, the sun is out, have fun you horny fucks. Like and rb if you enjoyed.\u00a0</p><p>~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*   ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~* ~*</p><p>You\u2018re on cloud nine, the traffic piling up not standing a chance against your mood. It may have took you twenty-one years to go to your first concert, but it was well worth the wait. You\u2019d spent the whole night singing, screaming and dancing to your heart\u2019s content, you couldn\u2019t believe you\u2019d been missing out on this experience all your life, you felt so safe and so happy, surrounded by people who gathered for the simplicity of enjoying music.</p><p>The beautiful curly haired boy danced and jumped around the stage as he sung, reading signs and teasing fans in between sets, the energy surrounding you making you feel unstoppable. Your heart nearly stopped when he\u2019d turned to you, walking his way to the edge of the stage and hushing you for screaming just as everyone else quieted, a shade of light red coating your cheeks at all the eyes suddenly turning towards you.</p><p>You\u2019d attached your phone to the radio so you could listen to the album on your way to the bar, belting out the lyrics and picturing yourself back in the sea of people. You were always a fan of One Direction\u2013 you recalled crying when Zayn left and laughed momentarily, oh how things had changed\u2013, but you\u2019d never looked into Harry\u2019s music until recently and when you found out he was coming into town you jumped at the chance to buy a ticket. Harry had always been charming and handsome, his beauty was timeless, but he had never looked better than he did as he stood on stage and sung his heart out, clearly in his element.</p><p>Your childhood crush was clearly redeveloping as your heart pounded at just the thought of him, everything about him was perfect from his cute little smile and accent to the silver rings that adorned his fingers. Absolutely, positively, drop dead gorgeous, you thought to yourself as you pulled into the parking lot of the bar. \u00a0</p><p>The cold air nipped at your warm cheeks as you made your way to the entrance, glancing over at the shining sign of the hotel that stood next to it. The metal was cold as you wrapped your hand around it, pulling one of the doors open and being instantly enveloped in the warm air.</p><p>While on your way to the bar you tripped on a loose floorboard, losing your balance momentarily and grabbing onto the shoulder of the stranger standing in front of you so you wouldn\u2019t fall on your face. When your balance was regained you looked up, your eyes meeting those of the stranger who\u2019d saved you from an embarrassing tumble. Your apology caught in your throat as your heart stopped, or maybe it was just beating so fast you couldn\u2019t feel it, either way the last eyes you were expecting to be met with were those of the boy you\u2019d spent the last hour watching as he danced around the stage. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cY\u2019following me round?\u201d He says, breaking the silence lingering between the two of you, his eyes brightening momentarily as they met yours and recalled the face in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not.\u201d You reply quickly, surprised he even remembered you and quickly squishing the mere idea of you following him. You weren\u2019t a creepy stalker and it was the last thing you wanted to be labelled as.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019a joke, love. Did you enjoy the show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, loved it. It was a wonderful escape from everything else in my life.\u201d </p><p>\u201cM\u2019glad you enjoyed it, but wha\u2019s wrong with everything else? Actually, hold that thought, we\u2019re gonna talk about this over a few drinks.\u201d Harry says, asking the bartender for two margaritas and tapping the seat next to him for you to sit. You hesitantly took the chair, taking a deep breath as you waited for the bartender to finish your drinks. Harry\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t leave you for a second, scanning over you like he was looking for an answer etched in your skin.</p><p>\u201cSo, is that tattoo from my song, by chance?\u201d He says, pulling your left arm towards him and gesturing to the words \u2018have the time of your life\u2019 scribbled there.</p><p>\u201cNo, I got this a couple years ago when I turned eighteen actually. Uhm, it\u2019s what I tell myself when I want to do something but I\u2019m too scared, guess it\u2019s kinda lame.\u201d You explain, grabbing one of the margaritas when the bartender slid them over.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019not lame at all, I think it\u2019s quite cool. Now, tell me wha\u2019s wrong, love.\u201d Harry says, turning towards you and taking a sip of his drink. </p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 life, I suppose. I\u2019ve been really stressed lately and I guess I just need a night off.\u201d You say, trying your best to explain the way you were feeling, still unsure as to why he cared.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah, I get it. I hope my show helped relieve some stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be under a lot of stress, what do you do to help when it gets too much?\u201d A smirk played on Harry\u2019s lips the second the words left your mouth, looking down at his drink and choking back a laugh. A jolt of confidence ran through you, you weren\u2019t sure if it was the alcohol in your system or the excitement from the amazing night you had, but something encouraged you to say</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could destress together sometime, then.\u201d Harry paused, looking over at you</p><p>\u201cS\u2019naughty of you, angel.\u201d He says, licking his lips and giving you a look that made your knees weak</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019re you gonna do about it?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019d be better off imaging what I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not sure you could handle the real thing, petal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d You say, turning in your chair to face him, your brow raised as you bathed in your newfound confidence. His hand was on your chin in seconds, leaning forward to whisper in your ear.</p><p>\u201cI will not hesitate to tie you up, pin you down and fuck you til\u2019 you\u2019re screaming. Don\u2019t test me, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLot of bark and no bite, so far.\u201d You say, shrinking under his glare before jumping at the bang of Harry slamming the money for your drinks on the table and tugging you harshly out of the bar by your arm. You struggled to keep up with his fast pace, his hand holding tightly onto yours as you walked through the doors of the fancy hotel next door. The confidence you had mustered faded away with the wind, causing you to feel abruptly more nervous.</p><p>The elevator ride to his room was quiet, tension filling the air and making it hard to breathe. You began to wonder what you\u2019d gotten yourself into, glancing at the curly haired boy who towered over you and thinking about what he was truly capable of. You figured your flirting was harmless and that he\u2019d never bite, but now you were almost hoping he would.</p><p>The walk to the hotel room itself was short, Harry quickly sliding his card in and swinging the door open, holding it there for you and glaring at you as you walked in. It was nice, although you didn\u2019t get to look long before Harry was pinning you against the wall. His lips wasted no time attacking your neck, \u00a0sucking, licking and biting at the sensitive skin, your fingers fiddling with the buttons of his shirt for a second before Harry smacked your hand away, harshly pinning them beside you on the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got quite the mouth on you, pet. Might aswell put it to good use.\u201d Harry says, pushing you to your knees and staring down at you as you got to work on his belt. \u00a0You kept glancing up at him, having trouble believing all of this is real.</p><p>You pulled Harry\u2019s pants down his legs, rubbing him slowly over his underwear before catching his warning glare and pulling them down to meet his pants, his cock springing up as you freed it from it\u2019s restraints. You tried your best to contain your shock at his large size, taking his cock in your hand and pumping slowly. Harry let out a quiet hiss at the feeling, tilting his head back and basking in the pleasure as you ran your tongue up the underside of his dick, taking your time to lick around the tip, teasing him as much as you could without getting a punishment before hollowing out your cheeks and attempting to take the rest of him in your mouth, your pumping hand helping you out on your way down. Harry entangled his hands in your hair, pushing your head lightly, you gagged as his tip hit the back of your throat but didn\u2019t cease your movements, pumping, licking and sucking as you silently begged for his cum. \u00a0</p><p>When the feeling in the pit of \u00a0your stomach became too much you decided to reach down and play with your clit as you sucked Harry off.</p><p>\u201cNone o\u2019 that.\u201d Harrry said when he noticed your fingers working against yourself, reaching down to grab your hands and place them on either of his thighs. \u00a0You began to moan against him, your fingers working to relieve some of the pressure, closing your eyes as you ran your tongue around his tip, bringing it to the top and kitten licking slowly, tasting his precum on your tongue as you did so.</p><p>Harry\u2019s head was thrown back against the wall, mouth hanging open and choking back moans. You tried your best to focus on the task at hand, but the almost angelic sound of his moans was distracting, and you wanted nothing more than his hands trailing all over your body. </p><p>\u201cOkay that\u2019s enough, angel, think m\u2019gonna cum.\u201d He groaned under his breath, but you ignored him and instead began pumping faster, hollowing your cheeks out as much as you could while simultaneously staring up at him innocently. You closed your eyes as you prepared to feel his cum shoot out in hot ropes, coating your tongue, but instead felt the harsh tug of your hair and his dick slip out of your mouth.</p><p>Your eyes met his, and damn did he look angry. You clamped your thighs together as you stared up at him, trying your best to suppress some of the pressure that\u2019d been building up all night. </p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve misheard me, petal, because surely you wouldn\u2019t be so disobedient as to misbehave so soon.\u201d He said, running his thumb along your bottom lip and watching as you slowly took it between your lips. You ran your tongue along his digit, waiting patiently for whatever might come next.</p><p>Harry used his other hand to pull you to your feet by your hair, backing you up until you hit the side of the bed, sitting down and staring up at Harry as he ran his fingers through your hair. He took a seat next to you, causing you to glance over at him in confusion. Harry raised his brow at you and glanced beside him, signaling for you to lay over his lap. You obeyed, not looking to get into any more trouble than you\u2019d already gotten yourself in. </p><p>He massaged your ass slowly as you laid there, mentally preparing yourself for the sharp pain of his hand coming down against your ass. Harry slid his hand down your ass and to your thigh, softly nudging your thigh to open your legs, moving your underwear to the side before swiping a finger through your folds. You opened your legs a little more, focusing all too much on his fingers, waiting anxiously for his next move. He began rubbing slow circles around your hole, reaching forward to play with your clit momentarily before moving his hand back and abruptly shoving his middle and pointer finger inside of you, pumping them in and out rapidly. His other hand continued to massage your ass slowly, his tongue shooting out to lick along his bottom lip.</p><p>You buried your face into the bedsheets, biting your lip to suppress the moans and grinding back into Harry\u2019s fingers, wanting more. You\u2019d imagined Harry\u2019s fingers would feel nice, but the real thing was so much better. Harry used his other hand to move your hair out of your face before continuing to massage you, his rough fingers feeling amazing against your bare ass.</p><p>\u00a0You squirmed under Harry\u2019s touch, your hips grinding into his thigh, hoping to feel some pressure on your clit, loving the way he made you feel. The way his fingers could reach so much farther than yours made your toes curl, thoughts of what he was capable ran through your head as you slowly approached your orgasm. You lifted your head to glance back at Harry, catching the beautiful sight of him biting down harshly on his lip as he stared at his fingers working themselves in and out of you, presumably soaked in your juices.</p><p>You laid your head on your arm, not taking your eyes away from Harry as your legs began to shake, your orgasm fast approaching. You swallowed down your moans, trying not to make too much noise and disturb the other residents of the hotel. Your walls fluttered around Harry\u2019s finger, a moan involuntarily tumbling out of your mouth as you came around his fingers. Your orgasm washed over you, making you tired, but both the relaxation and drowsiness you felt were taken away with a harsh slap to your ass. </p><p>\u201cDid I say you could cum?\u201d Harry says, placing another rough smack to your ass. You laid there, trying to catch your breath before being yanked up to be eye level with Harry.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question and I expect you to answer, petal.\u201d He said, giving another smack to your ass. You shook your head no in response to his question, jolting forward quickly when you felt three more smacks on your ass. </p><p>\u201cUse your words.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, didn\u2019t what, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say I could cum. I didn\u2019t know I had to ask.\u201d You say softly, your stinging ass only turning you on more. He moved your legs onto the bed so you were laying down before reaching into the drawer and pulling out a pair of hot pink fluffy handcuffs. Your heart skipped a beat when you saw them, eyes trailing over to meet his.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay love, but m\u2019afraid tha\u2019 since you don\u2019t know how to behave, i\u2019m gonna have to tie you up.\u201d Harry says, clicking the handcuffs around your wrists \u201cJust tell me if you want to stop.\u201d </p><p>You nodded, agreeing to tell him if it was too much as you slowly rubbed your thighs together. Harry climbed onto the bed, spreading your thighs and sitting inbetween them. His eyes wandered your body freely while his hands left teasing touches along your thighs. Harry\u2019s eyes met yours as he reached up and slid his fingers in your mouth, watching as you sucked your juices off his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAlrigh\u2019 angel, I\u2019m a bit of a narcissist so if we\u2019re gonna do this m\u2019gonna need you to be loud for me.\u201d Harry says, leaning down so his face is hovering above your own, his hard on pressed flat against your core.</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d You say, taking a deep breath and tugging lightly at your restraints. Harry hummed in approval before leaning down to leave kisses along your neck</p><p>\u201cCall me daddy.\u201d He whispered in your ear, his hot breath fanning out across your neck and sending a shiver down your spine. You paused for a second, processing what he said and gulping down the clump in your throat.</p><p>\u201cDaddy.\u201d You mumbled under your breath, tugging lightly on your restraints. Harry groaned, pulling your underwear down the length of your legs and carelessly discarding it, giving himself a few languid strokes before lining himself up to your entrance, glancing up at you for approval before pushing himself in slowly, wanting you to feel every throbbing inch he had to give. Harry filled you up all the way, his cock stretching you in the best way possible. It took you a minute to adjust, but when you did you gave Harry a quick nod and he began thrusting slowly, moaning into your ear as he felt your tight cunt wrapped around him.</p><p>Harry began to speed up when he felt you pushing back into him, holding himself up with his arm as he slowly fucked himself into you. He slowly began to build his pace, savoring the moans that tumbled over your lips, his lips kissing and biting down your neck, sucking momentarily on your sweet spot before continuing his way down to your breast, taking one in his mouth and using his hand to massage the other.</p><p>Your moans only cheered Harry on, encouraging him to go faster and harder with each thrust, fucking you into the bed as hard as he could. Harry stared down at you, watching your eyes roll into the back of your head as he fucked you, his and trailing up the bridge of your breasts and making its way to your neck, slightly cutting off your airways as he choked you. You dug your teeth into your bottom lip as you watched him fuck you, his eyes filled with lust as he relentlessly rammed himself into you.</p><p>\u201cYou look so good, angel, taking my dick. Such a dirty little girl in such a pretty little package. Your mouth gets you in a lot of trouble, eh?\u201d Harry says, spreading your legs to get deeper inside you. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t help the moans that poured past your lips as you tugged, hurting your wrists as you reached for your clit and momentarily forgot about your restraints. You whined, giving the handcuffs a few more light tugs as a show of your disapproval.</p><p>\u201cAwh, what, love? Y\u2019don\u2019t like the handcuffs?\u201d Harry asked in a teasing tone, you shook your head in response \u201cToo bad, should\u2019ve thought about that before you were a disobedient little slut. Y\u2019just lucky I didn\u2019t fuck you in the bathroom of tha\u2019 bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, daddy, I wanna touch you. I\u2019ll be a good girl I promise.\u201d You say, his pace not slowing down for even a second as he trailed his hand up from your throat to your jaw, squeezing harshly.</p><p>\u201cShut up and take my dick.\u201d He says, putting your legs over his shoulder and his hand back around your throat, speeding up as he hit a new angle that drove you wild, digging your fingernails into his back and dragging them down. You were sure not to hold any moans back, pushing your head back into your pillow as Harry fucked you, using the hand that was around your throat to play with your clit. Your legs shook beside his head as he hit all the right spots, tightening his hand around your throat when he felt you squeeze around his cock.</p><p>A loud moan shot from you mouth as you came around his dick, but he didn\u2019t slow down as he chased his own high, putting the fingers that just seconds ago were playing with your clit into his mouth, moaning at the taste as he released his load in you, hot ropes of cum shooting deep inside you. </p><p>You both relaxed, taking a moment to enjoy your orgasms before Harry pulled out, watching as his cum dripped out of you. He ran a finger through your folds once again, collecting a mixture of his cum and your juices on his finger and bringing it up to your mouth where you happily took the digits into your mouth, the salty-sweet concoction coating your taste buds as you gave Harry a wink.</p><p>Harry took his fingers back once you\u2019d licked it all off and dipped his head back down between your thighs.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think we were done yet, did you love?\u201d He asks, licking a fat stripe up your sensitive, wet pussy. You moaned quietly at the feeling, once again tugging at the cuffs that bound your hands as you forgot they were there. Harry wraps his arm below your thighs, holding your red ass in his hands as he ate you out. He moaned at the taste, the vibrations hitting you in your core and flowing throughout you. You lifted your hips, grinding into his tongue as you felt him slip in and out of you, using his tongue to play with your clit and fuck you. </p><p>Harry looked like he was enjoying himself, finding it hard to choose between licking up inside you and sucking on your clit, finding a middle ground by sucking on and licking at your clit while finger fucking you. </p><p>\u201cGonna cum for me, like a good little girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not sure I can.\u201d You say, taking a deep breath that ended in a moan.</p><p>\u201cSure you can, a dirty little girl like you, even ran that slutty little mouth of yours, time to own up to it, petal. Cum on my fucking tongue, I wanna taste you and feel you cum all over my face jus\u2019 like you did with my cock.\u201d Harry said, switching positions so he was using his fingers to play with your clit and licking up inside you with his tongue. </p><p>Your orgasm hit you like a ton of bricks, racking your body and leaving you fatigued. Harry licked up your release before making his way up your body and giving you a wet kiss. You moaned into the kiss as you tasted yourself. You playfully bit at his bottom lip before retreating back into his mouth, kissing each other slowly as you returned from your highs.</p><p>Harry left a final peck on your lips before laying next to you, where you looked around for your underwear as you prepared to leave, spotting it on the lamp shade and standing to grab it. Your legs felt weak as you went to stand, so you were glad when Harry grabbed your hand and pulled you to sit back down.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ah ah,\u201d He said, pulling you back up to him and burying your face into his chest as he pulled the blankets over the two of you \u201cyou never told me about wha\u2019s wrong, plus there\u2019s traffic, you won\u2019t be home til\u2019 late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did tell you what was wrong, stress, remember? Sounds like you\u2019re just trying to make an excuse so I\u2019ll stay and cuddle with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that too.\u201d</p></p>",

She\u2019s finally updating, we\u2019re so proud. This is basically my take on the\u00a0\u2018noticed in the middle of the crowd\u2019 trope. It\u2019s 6:48 Am, I started at like 1, I am tired, the sun is out, have fun you horny fucks. Like and rb if you enjoyed.\u00a0</p><p>~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*   ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~* ~*</p><p>You\u2018re on cloud nine, the traffic piling up not standing a chance against your mood. It may have took you twenty-one years to go to your first concert, but it was well worth the wait. You\u2019d spent the whole night singing, screaming and dancing to your heart\u2019s content, you couldn\u2019t believe you\u2019d been missing out on this experience all your life, you felt so safe and so happy, surrounded by people who gathered for the simplicity of enjoying music.</p><p>The beautiful curly haired boy danced and jumped around the stage as he sung, reading signs and teasing fans in between sets, the energy surrounding you making you feel unstoppable. Your heart nearly stopped when he\u2019d turned to you, walking his way to the edge of the stage and hushing you for screaming just as everyone else quieted, a shade of light red coating your cheeks at all the eyes suddenly turning towards you.</p><p>You\u2019d attached your phone to the radio so you could listen to the album on your way to the bar, belting out the lyrics and picturing yourself back in the sea of people. You were always a fan of One Direction\u2013 you recalled crying when Zayn left and laughed momentarily, oh how things had changed\u2013, but you\u2019d never looked into Harry\u2019s music until recently and when you found out he was coming into town you jumped at the chance to buy a ticket. Harry had always been charming and handsome, his beauty was timeless, but he had never looked better than he did as he stood on stage and sung his heart out, clearly in his element.</p><p>Your childhood crush was clearly redeveloping as your heart pounded at just the thought of him, everything about him was perfect from his cute little smile and accent to the silver rings that adorned his fingers. Absolutely, positively, drop dead gorgeous, you thought to yourself as you pulled into the parking lot of the bar. \u00a0</p><p>The cold air nipped at your warm cheeks as you made your way to the entrance, glancing over at the shining sign of the hotel that stood next to it. The metal was cold as you wrapped your hand around it, pulling one of the doors open and being instantly enveloped in the warm air.</p><p>While on your way to the bar you tripped on a loose floorboard, losing your balance momentarily and grabbing onto the shoulder of the stranger standing in front of you so you wouldn\u2019t fall on your face. When your balance was regained you looked up, your eyes meeting those of the stranger who\u2019d saved you from an embarrassing tumble. Your apology caught in your throat as your heart stopped, or maybe it was just beating so fast you couldn\u2019t feel it, either way the last eyes you were expecting to be met with were those of the boy you\u2019d spent the last hour watching as he danced around the stage. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cY\u2019following me round?\u201d He says, breaking the silence lingering between the two of you, his eyes brightening momentarily as they met yours and recalled the face in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not.\u201d You reply quickly, surprised he even remembered you and quickly squishing the mere idea of you following him. You weren\u2019t a creepy stalker and it was the last thing you wanted to be labelled as.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019a joke, love. Did you enjoy the show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, loved it. It was a wonderful escape from everything else in my life.\u201d </p><p>\u201cM\u2019glad you enjoyed it, but wha\u2019s wrong with everything else? Actually, hold that thought, we\u2019re gonna talk about this over a few drinks.\u201d Harry says, asking the bartender for two margaritas and tapping the seat next to him for you to sit. You hesitantly took the chair, taking a deep breath as you waited for the bartender to finish your drinks. Harry\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t leave you for a second, scanning over you like he was looking for an answer etched in your skin.</p><p>\u201cSo, is that tattoo from my song, by chance?\u201d He says, pulling your left arm towards him and gesturing to the words \u2018have the time of your life\u2019 scribbled there.</p><p>\u201cNo, I got this a couple years ago when I turned eighteen actually. Uhm, it\u2019s what I tell myself when I want to do something but I\u2019m too scared, guess it\u2019s kinda lame.\u201d You explain, grabbing one of the margaritas when the bartender slid them over.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019not lame at all, I think it\u2019s quite cool. Now, tell me wha\u2019s wrong, love.\u201d Harry says, turning towards you and taking a sip of his drink. </p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 life, I suppose. I\u2019ve been really stressed lately and I guess I just need a night off.\u201d You say, trying your best to explain the way you were feeling, still unsure as to why he cared.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah, I get it. I hope my show helped relieve some stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be under a lot of stress, what do you do to help when it gets too much?\u201d A smirk played on Harry\u2019s lips the second the words left your mouth, looking down at his drink and choking back a laugh. A jolt of confidence ran through you, you weren\u2019t sure if it was the alcohol in your system or the excitement from the amazing night you had, but something encouraged you to say</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could destress together sometime, then.\u201d Harry paused, looking over at you</p><p>\u201cS\u2019naughty of you, angel.\u201d He says, licking his lips and giving you a look that made your knees weak</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019re you gonna do about it?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019d be better off imaging what I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not sure you could handle the real thing, petal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d You say, turning in your chair to face him, your brow raised as you bathed in your newfound confidence. His hand was on your chin in seconds, leaning forward to whisper in your ear.</p><p>\u201cI will not hesitate to tie you up, pin you down and fuck you til\u2019 you\u2019re screaming. Don\u2019t test me, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLot of bark and no bite, so far.\u201d You say, shrinking under his glare before jumping at the bang of Harry slamming the money for your drinks on the table and tugging you harshly out of the bar by your arm. You struggled to keep up with his fast pace, his hand holding tightly onto yours as you walked through the doors of the fancy hotel next door. The confidence you had mustered faded away with the wind, causing you to feel abruptly more nervous.</p><p>The elevator ride to his room was quiet, tension filling the air and making it hard to breathe. You began to wonder what you\u2019d gotten yourself into, glancing at the curly haired boy who towered over you and thinking about what he was truly capable of. You figured your flirting was harmless and that he\u2019d never bite, but now you were almost hoping he would.</p><p>The walk to the hotel room itself was short, Harry quickly sliding his card in and swinging the door open, holding it there for you and glaring at you as you walked in. It was nice, although you didn\u2019t get to look long before Harry was pinning you against the wall. His lips wasted no time attacking your neck, \u00a0sucking, licking and biting at the sensitive skin, your fingers fiddling with the buttons of his shirt for a second before Harry smacked your hand away, harshly pinning them beside you on the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got quite the mouth on you, pet. Might aswell put it to good use.\u201d Harry says, pushing you to your knees and staring down at you as you got to work on his belt. \u00a0You kept glancing up at him, having trouble believing all of this is real.</p><p>You pulled Harry\u2019s pants down his legs, rubbing him slowly over his underwear before catching his warning glare and pulling them down to meet his pants, his cock springing up as you freed it from it\u2019s restraints. You tried your best to contain your shock at his large size, taking his cock in your hand and pumping slowly. Harry let out a quiet hiss at the feeling, tilting his head back and basking in the pleasure as you ran your tongue up the underside of his dick, taking your time to lick around the tip, teasing him as much as you could without getting a punishment before hollowing out your cheeks and attempting to take the rest of him in your mouth, your pumping hand helping you out on your way down. Harry entangled his hands in your hair, pushing your head lightly, you gagged as his tip hit the back of your throat but didn\u2019t cease your movements, pumping, licking and sucking as you silently begged for his cum. \u00a0</p><p>When the feeling in the pit of \u00a0your stomach became too much you decided to reach down and play with your clit as you sucked Harry off.</p><p>\u201cNone o\u2019 that.\u201d Harrry said when he noticed your fingers working against yourself, reaching down to grab your hands and place them on either of his thighs. \u00a0You began to moan against him, your fingers working to relieve some of the pressure, closing your eyes as you ran your tongue around his tip, bringing it to the top and kitten licking slowly, tasting his precum on your tongue as you did so.</p><p>Harry\u2019s head was thrown back against the wall, mouth hanging open and choking back moans. You tried your best to focus on the task at hand, but the almost angelic sound of his moans was distracting, and you wanted nothing more than his hands trailing all over your body. </p><p>\u201cOkay that\u2019s enough, angel, think m\u2019gonna cum.\u201d He groaned under his breath, but you ignored him and instead began pumping faster, hollowing your cheeks out as much as you could while simultaneously staring up at him innocently. You closed your eyes as you prepared to feel his cum shoot out in hot ropes, coating your tongue, but instead felt the harsh tug of your hair and his dick slip out of your mouth.</p><p>Your eyes met his, and damn did he look angry. You clamped your thighs together as you stared up at him, trying your best to suppress some of the pressure that\u2019d been building up all night. </p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve misheard me, petal, because surely you wouldn\u2019t be so disobedient as to misbehave so soon.\u201d He said, running his thumb along your bottom lip and watching as you slowly took it between your lips. You ran your tongue along his digit, waiting patiently for whatever might come next.</p><p>Harry used his other hand to pull you to your feet by your hair, backing you up until you hit the side of the bed, sitting down and staring up at Harry as he ran his fingers through your hair. He took a seat next to you, causing you to glance over at him in confusion. Harry raised his brow at you and glanced beside him, signaling for you to lay over his lap. You obeyed, not looking to get into any more trouble than you\u2019d already gotten yourself in. </p><p>He massaged your ass slowly as you laid there, mentally preparing yourself for the sharp pain of his hand coming down against your ass. Harry slid his hand down your ass and to your thigh, softly nudging your thigh to open your legs, moving your underwear to the side before swiping a finger through your folds. You opened your legs a little more, focusing all too much on his fingers, waiting anxiously for his next move. He began rubbing slow circles around your hole, reaching forward to play with your clit momentarily before moving his hand back and abruptly shoving his middle and pointer finger inside of you, pumping them in and out rapidly. His other hand continued to massage your ass slowly, his tongue shooting out to lick along his bottom lip.</p><p>You buried your face into the bedsheets, biting your lip to suppress the moans and grinding back into Harry\u2019s fingers, wanting more. You\u2019d imagined Harry\u2019s fingers would feel nice, but the real thing was so much better. Harry used his other hand to move your hair out of your face before continuing to massage you, his rough fingers feeling amazing against your bare ass.</p><p>\u00a0You squirmed under Harry\u2019s touch, your hips grinding into his thigh, hoping to feel some pressure on your clit, loving the way he made you feel. The way his fingers could reach so much farther than yours made your toes curl, thoughts of what he was capable ran through your head as you slowly approached your orgasm. You lifted your head to glance back at Harry, catching the beautiful sight of him biting down harshly on his lip as he stared at his fingers working themselves in and out of you, presumably soaked in your juices.</p><p>You laid your head on your arm, not taking your eyes away from Harry as your legs began to shake, your orgasm fast approaching. You swallowed down your moans, trying not to make too much noise and disturb the other residents of the hotel. Your walls fluttered around Harry\u2019s finger, a moan involuntarily tumbling out of your mouth as you came around his fingers. Your orgasm washed over you, making you tired, but both the relaxation and drowsiness you felt were taken away with a harsh slap to your ass. </p><p>\u201cDid I say you could cum?\u201d Harry says, placing another rough smack to your ass. You laid there, trying to catch your breath before being yanked up to be eye level with Harry.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question and I expect you to answer, petal.\u201d He said, giving another smack to your ass. You shook your head no in response to his question, jolting forward quickly when you felt three more smacks on your ass. </p><p>\u201cUse your words.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, didn\u2019t what, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say I could cum. I didn\u2019t know I had to ask.\u201d You say softly, your stinging ass only turning you on more. He moved your legs onto the bed so you were laying down before reaching into the drawer and pulling out a pair of hot pink fluffy handcuffs. Your heart skipped a beat when you saw them, eyes trailing over to meet his.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay love, but m\u2019afraid tha\u2019 since you don\u2019t know how to behave, i\u2019m gonna have to tie you up.\u201d Harry says, clicking the handcuffs around your wrists \u201cJust tell me if you want to stop.\u201d </p><p>You nodded, agreeing to tell him if it was too much as you slowly rubbed your thighs together. Harry climbed onto the bed, spreading your thighs and sitting inbetween them. His eyes wandered your body freely while his hands left teasing touches along your thighs. Harry\u2019s eyes met yours as he reached up and slid his fingers in your mouth, watching as you sucked your juices off his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAlrigh\u2019 angel, I\u2019m a bit of a narcissist so if we\u2019re gonna do this m\u2019gonna need you to be loud for me.\u201d Harry says, leaning down so his face is hovering above your own, his hard on pressed flat against your core.</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d You say, taking a deep breath and tugging lightly at your restraints. Harry hummed in approval before leaning down to leave kisses along your neck</p><p>\u201cCall me daddy.\u201d He whispered in your ear, his hot breath fanning out across your neck and sending a shiver down your spine. You paused for a second, processing what he said and gulping down the clump in your throat.</p><p>\u201cDaddy.\u201d You mumbled under your breath, tugging lightly on your restraints. Harry groaned, pulling your underwear down the length of your legs and carelessly discarding it, giving himself a few languid strokes before lining himself up to your entrance, glancing up at you for approval before pushing himself in slowly, wanting you to feel every throbbing inch he had to give. Harry filled you up all the way, his cock stretching you in the best way possible. It took you a minute to adjust, but when you did you gave Harry a quick nod and he began thrusting slowly, moaning into your ear as he felt your tight cunt wrapped around him.</p><p>Harry began to speed up when he felt you pushing back into him, holding himself up with his arm as he slowly fucked himself into you. He slowly began to build his pace, savoring the moans that tumbled over your lips, his lips kissing and biting down your neck, sucking momentarily on your sweet spot before continuing his way down to your breast, taking one in his mouth and using his hand to massage the other.</p><p>Your moans only cheered Harry on, encouraging him to go faster and harder with each thrust, fucking you into the bed as hard as he could. Harry stared down at you, watching your eyes roll into the back of your head as he fucked you, his and trailing up the bridge of your breasts and making its way to your neck, slightly cutting off your airways as he choked you. You dug your teeth into your bottom lip as you watched him fuck you, his eyes filled with lust as he relentlessly rammed himself into you.</p><p>\u201cYou look so good, angel, taking my dick. Such a dirty little girl in such a pretty little package. Your mouth gets you in a lot of trouble, eh?\u201d Harry says, spreading your legs to get deeper inside you. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t help the moans that poured past your lips as you tugged, hurting your wrists as you reached for your clit and momentarily forgot about your restraints. You whined, giving the handcuffs a few more light tugs as a show of your disapproval.</p><p>\u201cAwh, what, love? Y\u2019don\u2019t like the handcuffs?\u201d Harry asked in a teasing tone, you shook your head in response \u201cToo bad, should\u2019ve thought about that before you were a disobedient little slut. Y\u2019just lucky I didn\u2019t fuck you in the bathroom of tha\u2019 bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, daddy, I wanna touch you. I\u2019ll be a good girl I promise.\u201d You say, his pace not slowing down for even a second as he trailed his hand up from your throat to your jaw, squeezing harshly.</p><p>\u201cShut up and take my dick.\u201d He says, putting your legs over his shoulder and his hand back around your throat, speeding up as he hit a new angle that drove you wild, digging your fingernails into his back and dragging them down. You were sure not to hold any moans back, pushing your head back into your pillow as Harry fucked you, using the hand that was around your throat to play with your clit. Your legs shook beside his head as he hit all the right spots, tightening his hand around your throat when he felt you squeeze around his cock.</p><p>A loud moan shot from you mouth as you came around his dick, but he didn\u2019t slow down as he chased his own high, putting the fingers that just seconds ago were playing with your clit into his mouth, moaning at the taste as he released his load in you, hot ropes of cum shooting deep inside you. </p><p>You both relaxed, taking a moment to enjoy your orgasms before Harry pulled out, watching as his cum dripped out of you. He ran a finger through your folds once again, collecting a mixture of his cum and your juices on his finger and bringing it up to your mouth where you happily took the digits into your mouth, the salty-sweet concoction coating your taste buds as you gave Harry a wink.</p><p>Harry took his fingers back once you\u2019d licked it all off and dipped his head back down between your thighs.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think we were done yet, did you love?\u201d He asks, licking a fat stripe up your sensitive, wet pussy. You moaned quietly at the feeling, once again tugging at the cuffs that bound your hands as you forgot they were there. Harry wraps his arm below your thighs, holding your red ass in his hands as he ate you out. He moaned at the taste, the vibrations hitting you in your core and flowing throughout you. You lifted your hips, grinding into his tongue as you felt him slip in and out of you, using his tongue to play with your clit and fuck you. </p><p>Harry looked like he was enjoying himself, finding it hard to choose between licking up inside you and sucking on your clit, finding a middle ground by sucking on and licking at your clit while finger fucking you. </p><p>\u201cGonna cum for me, like a good little girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not sure I can.\u201d You say, taking a deep breath that ended in a moan.</p><p>\u201cSure you can, a dirty little girl like you, even ran that slutty little mouth of yours, time to own up to it, petal. Cum on my fucking tongue, I wanna taste you and feel you cum all over my face jus\u2019 like you did with my cock.\u201d Harry said, switching positions so he was using his fingers to play with your clit and licking up inside you with his tongue. </p><p>Your orgasm hit you like a ton of bricks, racking your body and leaving you fatigued. Harry licked up your release before making his way up your body and giving you a wet kiss. You moaned into the kiss as you tasted yourself. You playfully bit at his bottom lip before retreating back into his mouth, kissing each other slowly as you returned from your highs.</p><p>Harry left a final peck on your lips before laying next to you, where you looked around for your underwear as you prepared to leave, spotting it on the lamp shade and standing to grab it. Your legs felt weak as you went to stand, so you were glad when Harry grabbed your hand and pulled you to sit back down.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ah ah,\u201d He said, pulling you back up to him and burying your face into his chest as he pulled the blankets over the two of you \u201cyou never told me about wha\u2019s wrong, plus there\u2019s traffic, you won\u2019t be home til\u2019 late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did tell you what was wrong, stress, remember? Sounds like you\u2019re just trying to make an excuse so I\u2019ll stay and cuddle with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that too.\u201d</p></p>",

She&rsquo;s finally updating, we&rsquo;re so proud. This is basically my take on the&nbsp;&lsquo;noticed in the middle of the crowd&rsquo; trope. It&rsquo;s 6:48 Am, I started at like 1, I am tired, the sun is out, have fun you horny fucks. Like and rb if you enjoyed.&nbsp;</p><p>~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*   ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~*    ~*~* ~*</p><p>You&lsquo;re on cloud nine, the traffic piling up not standing a chance against your mood. It may have took you twenty-one years to go to your first concert, but it was well worth the wait. You&rsquo;d spent the whole night singing, screaming and dancing to your heart&rsquo;s content, you couldn&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;d been missing out on this experience all your life, you felt so safe and so happy, surrounded by people who gathered for the simplicity of enjoying music.</p><p>The beautiful curly haired boy danced and jumped around the stage as he sung, reading signs and teasing fans in between sets, the energy surrounding you making you feel unstoppable. Your heart nearly stopped when he&rsquo;d turned to you, walking his way to the edge of the stage and hushing you for screaming just as everyone else quieted, a shade of light red coating your cheeks at all the eyes suddenly turning towards you.</p><p>You&rsquo;d attached your phone to the radio so you could listen to the album on your way to the bar, belting out the lyrics and picturing yourself back in the sea of people. You were always a fan of One Direction&ndash; you recalled crying when Zayn left and laughed momentarily, oh how things had changed&ndash;, but you&rsquo;d never looked into Harry&rsquo;s music until recently and when you found out he was coming into town you jumped at the chance to buy a ticket. Harry had always been charming and handsome, his beauty was timeless, but he had never looked better than he did as he stood on stage and sung his heart out, clearly in his element.</p><p>Your childhood crush was clearly redeveloping as your heart pounded at just the thought of him, everything about him was perfect from his cute little smile and accent to the silver rings that adorned his fingers. Absolutely, positively, drop dead gorgeous, you thought to yourself as you pulled into the parking lot of the bar. &nbsp;</p><p>The cold air nipped at your warm cheeks as you made your way to the entrance, glancing over at the shining sign of the hotel that stood next to it. The metal was cold as you wrapped your hand around it, pulling one of the doors open and being instantly enveloped in the warm air.</p><p>While on your way to the bar you tripped on a loose floorboard, losing your balance momentarily and grabbing onto the shoulder of the stranger standing in front of you so you wouldn&rsquo;t fall on your face. When your balance was regained you looked up, your eyes meeting those of the stranger who&rsquo;d saved you from an embarrassing tumble. Your apology caught in your throat as your heart stopped, or maybe it was just beating so fast you couldn&rsquo;t feel it, either way the last eyes you were expecting to be met with were those of the boy you&rsquo;d spent the last hour watching as he danced around the stage. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;following me round?&rdquo; He says, breaking the silence lingering between the two of you, his eyes brightening momentarily as they met yours and recalled the face in the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, of course not.&rdquo; You reply quickly, surprised he even remembered you and quickly squishing the mere idea of you following him. You weren&rsquo;t a creepy stalker and it was the last thing you wanted to be labelled as.</p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;a joke, love. Did you enjoy the show?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah, loved it. It was a wonderful escape from everything else in my life.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;glad you enjoyed it, but wha&rsquo;s wrong with everything else? Actually, hold that thought, we&rsquo;re gonna talk about this over a few drinks.&rdquo; Harry says, asking the bartender for two margaritas and tapping the seat next to him for you to sit. You hesitantly took the chair, taking a deep breath as you waited for the bartender to finish your drinks. Harry&rsquo;s eyes didn&rsquo;t leave you for a second, scanning over you like he was looking for an answer etched in your skin.</p><p>&ldquo;So, is that tattoo from my song, by chance?&rdquo; He says, pulling your left arm towards him and gesturing to the words &lsquo;have the time of your life&rsquo; scribbled there.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I got this a couple years ago when I turned eighteen actually. Uhm, it&rsquo;s what I tell myself when I want to do something but I&rsquo;m too scared, guess it&rsquo;s kinda lame.&rdquo; You explain, grabbing one of the margaritas when the bartender slid them over.</p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;not lame at all, I think it&rsquo;s quite cool. Now, tell me wha&rsquo;s wrong, love.&rdquo; Harry says, turning towards you and taking a sip of his drink. </p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip; life, I suppose. I&rsquo;ve been really stressed lately and I guess I just need a night off.&rdquo; You say, trying your best to explain the way you were feeling, still unsure as to why he cared.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, I get it. I hope my show helped relieve some stress.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must be under a lot of stress, what do you do to help when it gets too much?&rdquo; A smirk played on Harry&rsquo;s lips the second the words left your mouth, looking down at his drink and choking back a laugh. A jolt of confidence ran through you, you weren&rsquo;t sure if it was the alcohol in your system or the excitement from the amazing night you had, but something encouraged you to say</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we could destress together sometime, then.&rdquo; Harry paused, looking over at you</p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;naughty of you, angel.&rdquo; He says, licking his lips and giving you a look that made your knees weak</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;re you gonna do about it?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;d be better off imaging what I could do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;not sure you could handle the real thing, petal.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Try me.&rdquo; You say, turning in your chair to face him, your brow raised as you bathed in your newfound confidence. His hand was on your chin in seconds, leaning forward to whisper in your ear.</p><p>&ldquo;I will not hesitate to tie you up, pin you down and fuck you til&rsquo; you&rsquo;re screaming. Don&rsquo;t test me, angel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lot of bark and no bite, so far.&rdquo; You say, shrinking under his glare before jumping at the bang of Harry slamming the money for your drinks on the table and tugging you harshly out of the bar by your arm. You struggled to keep up with his fast pace, his hand holding tightly onto yours as you walked through the doors of the fancy hotel next door. The confidence you had mustered faded away with the wind, causing you to feel abruptly more nervous.</p><p>The elevator ride to his room was quiet, tension filling the air and making it hard to breathe. You began to wonder what you&rsquo;d gotten yourself into, glancing at the curly haired boy who towered over you and thinking about what he was truly capable of. You figured your flirting was harmless and that he&rsquo;d never bite, but now you were almost hoping he would.</p><p>The walk to the hotel room itself was short, Harry quickly sliding his card in and swinging the door open, holding it there for you and glaring at you as you walked in. It was nice, although you didn&rsquo;t get to look long before Harry was pinning you against the wall. His lips wasted no time attacking your neck, &nbsp;sucking, licking and biting at the sensitive skin, your fingers fiddling with the buttons of his shirt for a second before Harry smacked your hand away, harshly pinning them beside you on the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got quite the mouth on you, pet. Might aswell put it to good use.&rdquo; Harry says, pushing you to your knees and staring down at you as you got to work on his belt. &nbsp;You kept glancing up at him, having trouble believing all of this is real.</p><p>You pulled Harry&rsquo;s pants down his legs, rubbing him slowly over his underwear before catching his warning glare and pulling them down to meet his pants, his cock springing up as you freed it from it&rsquo;s restraints. You tried your best to contain your shock at his large size, taking his cock in your hand and pumping slowly. Harry let out a quiet hiss at the feeling, tilting his head back and basking in the pleasure as you ran your tongue up the underside of his dick, taking your time to lick around the tip, teasing him as much as you could without getting a punishment before hollowing out your cheeks and attempting to take the rest of him in your mouth, your pumping hand helping you out on your way down. Harry entangled his hands in your hair, pushing your head lightly, you gagged as his tip hit the back of your throat but didn&rsquo;t cease your movements, pumping, licking and sucking as you silently begged for his cum. &nbsp;</p><p>When the feeling in the pit of &nbsp;your stomach became too much you decided to reach down and play with your clit as you sucked Harry off.</p><p>&ldquo;None o&rsquo; that.&rdquo; Harrry said when he noticed your fingers working against yourself, reaching down to grab your hands and place them on either of his thighs. &nbsp;You began to moan against him, your fingers working to relieve some of the pressure, closing your eyes as you ran your tongue around his tip, bringing it to the top and kitten licking slowly, tasting his precum on your tongue as you did so.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s head was thrown back against the wall, mouth hanging open and choking back moans. You tried your best to focus on the task at hand, but the almost angelic sound of his moans was distracting, and you wanted nothing more than his hands trailing all over your body. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay that&rsquo;s enough, angel, think m&rsquo;gonna cum.&rdquo; He groaned under his breath, but you ignored him and instead began pumping faster, hollowing your cheeks out as much as you could while simultaneously staring up at him innocently. You closed your eyes as you prepared to feel his cum shoot out in hot ropes, coating your tongue, but instead felt the harsh tug of your hair and his dick slip out of your mouth.</p><p>Your eyes met his, and damn did he look angry.

You ran your tongue along his digit, waiting patiently for whatever might come next.</p><p>Harry used his other hand to pull you to your feet by your hair, backing you up until you hit the side of the bed, sitting down and staring up at Harry as he ran his fingers through your hair. He took a seat next to you, causing you to glance over at him in confusion. Harry raised his brow at you and glanced beside him, signaling for you to lay over his lap. You obeyed, not looking to get into any more trouble than you&rsquo;d already gotten yourself in. </p><p>He massaged your ass slowly as you laid there, mentally preparing yourself for the sharp pain of his hand coming down against your ass. Harry slid his hand down your ass and to your thigh, softly nudging your thigh to open your legs, moving your underwear to the side before swiping a finger through your folds.

I didn&rsquo;t know I had to ask.&rdquo; You say softly, your stinging ass only turning you on more. He moved your legs onto the bed so you were laying down before reaching into the drawer and pulling out a pair of hot pink fluffy handcuffs. Your heart skipped a beat when you saw them, eyes trailing over to meet his.</p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;okay love, but m&rsquo;afraid tha&rsquo; since you don&rsquo;t know how to behave, i&rsquo;m gonna have to tie you up.&rdquo; Harry says, clicking the handcuffs around your wrists &ldquo;Just tell me if you want to stop.&rdquo; </p><p>You nodded, agreeing to tell him if it was too much as you slowly rubbed your thighs together. Harry climbed onto the bed, spreading your thighs and sitting inbetween them. His eyes wandered your body freely while his hands left teasing touches along your thighs. Harry&rsquo;s eyes met yours as he reached up and slid his fingers in your mouth, watching as you sucked your juices off his fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Alrigh&rsquo; angel, I&rsquo;m a bit of a narcissist so if we&rsquo;re gonna do this m&rsquo;gonna need you to be loud for me.&rdquo; Harry says, leaning down so his face is hovering above your own, his hard on pressed flat against your core.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; You say, taking a deep breath and tugging lightly at your restraints. Harry hummed in approval before leaning down to leave kisses along your neck</p><p>&ldquo;Call me daddy.&rdquo; He whispered in your ear, his hot breath fanning out across your neck and sending a shiver down your spine.

Your mouth gets you in a lot of trouble, eh?&rdquo; Harry says, spreading your legs to get deeper inside you. </p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help the moans that poured past your lips as you tugged, hurting your wrists as you reached for your clit and momentarily forgot about your restraints. You whined, giving the handcuffs a few more light tugs as a show of your disapproval.</p><p>&ldquo;Awh, what, love? Y&rsquo;don&rsquo;t like the handcuffs?&rdquo; Harry asked in a teasing tone, you shook your head in response &ldquo;Too bad, should&rsquo;ve thought about that before you were a disobedient little slut. Y&rsquo;just lucky I didn&rsquo;t fuck you in the bathroom of tha&rsquo; bar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, daddy, I wanna touch you. I&rsquo;ll be a good girl I promise.&rdquo; You say, his pace not slowing down for even a second as he trailed his hand up from your throat to your jaw, squeezing harshly.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up and take my dick.&rdquo; He says, putting your legs over his shoulder and his hand back around your throat, speeding up as he hit a new angle that drove you wild, digging your fingernails into his back and dragging them down. You were sure not to hold any moans back, pushing your head back into your pillow as Harry fucked you, using the hand that was around your throat to play with your clit. Your legs shook beside his head as he hit all the right spots, tightening his hand around your throat when he felt you squeeze around his cock.</p><p>A loud moan shot from you mouth as you came around his dick, but he didn&rsquo;t slow down as he chased his own high, putting the fingers that just seconds ago were playing with your clit into his mouth, moaning at the taste as he released his load in you, hot ropes of cum shooting deep inside you. </p><p>You both relaxed, taking a moment to enjoy your orgasms before Harry pulled out, watching as his cum dripped out of you. He ran a finger through your folds once again, collecting a mixture of his cum and your juices on his finger and bringing it up to your mouth where you happily took the digits into your mouth, the salty-sweet concoction coating your taste buds as you gave Harry a wink.</p><p>Harry took his fingers back once you&rsquo;d licked it all off and dipped his head back down between your thighs.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think we were done yet, did you love?&rdquo; He asks, licking a fat stripe up your sensitive, wet pussy. You moaned quietly at the feeling, once again tugging at the cuffs that bound your hands as you forgot they were there. Harry wraps his arm below your thighs, holding your red ass in his hands as he ate you out. He moaned at the taste, the vibrations hitting you in your core and flowing throughout you. You lifted your hips, grinding into his tongue as you felt him slip in and out of you, using his tongue to play with your clit and fuck you. </p><p>Harry looked like he was enjoying himself, finding it hard to choose between licking up inside you and sucking on your clit, finding a middle ground by sucking on and licking at your clit while finger fucking you. </p><p>&ldquo;Gonna cum for me, like a good little girl?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;not sure I can.&rdquo; You say, taking a deep breath that ended in a moan.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure you can, a dirty little girl like you, even ran that slutty little mouth of yours, time to own up to it, petal. Cum on my fucking tongue, I wanna taste you and feel you cum all over my face jus&rsquo; like you did with my cock.&rdquo; Harry said, switching positions so he was using his fingers to play with your clit and licking up inside you with his tongue. </p><p>Your orgasm hit you like a ton of bricks, racking your body and leaving you fatigued. Harry licked up your release before making his way up your body and giving you a wet kiss. You moaned into the kiss as you tasted yourself. You playfully bit at his bottom lip before retreating back into his mouth, kissing each other slowly as you returned from your highs.</p><p>Harry left a final peck on your lips before laying next to you, where you looked around for your underwear as you prepared to leave, spotting it on the lamp shade and standing to grab it. Your legs felt weak as you went to stand, so you were glad when Harry grabbed your hand and pulled you to sit back down.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah ah ah,&rdquo; He said, pulling you back up to him and burying your face into his chest as he pulled the blankets over the two of you &ldquo;you never told me about wha&rsquo;s wrong, plus there&rsquo;s traffic, you won&rsquo;t be home til&rsquo; late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did tell you what was wrong, stress, remember? Sounds like you&rsquo;re just trying to make an excuse so I&rsquo;ll stay and cuddle with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that too.&rdquo;</p></p>",

Harry looked at me and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;I made some coffee and tea for ya lovie,&rdquo; Harry said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know which one you preferred so I made both.&rdquo; Harry smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I returned a smile to him, &ldquo;but I live for coffee,&rdquo; I sighed, &ldquo;Coffee is way better than tea.&rdquo; I made my way over to the coffee machine and poured myself a cup throwing a splash of creamer in just the way you like it.</p><p>&ldquo;That is a false statement lovie,&rdquo; Harry said flipping a pancake and then looking at me, &ldquo;tea is where it&rsquo;s at, isn&rsquo;t it Emma?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Emma giggles giving her father a high five.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay Styles,&rdquo; I chuckled, &ldquo;whatever you say, but coffee is and will always be number one in my heart.&rdquo; I said taking a seat at the island that sat in the middle of your kitchen.</p><p>Harry smiled as he continued to cook chocolate chip pancakes requested by the girls. As I \u00a0sat there, I admire everything about Harry. His soft features and the way he treated the girls made my heart melt. I didn&rsquo;t want to get ahead of myself, Harry and I were simply just two parents of little girls who became best friends. But I couldn&rsquo;t shake off the feeling that maybe, just maybe, I might be catching feelings for the tall curly haired man.</p><p>&ldquo;Earth to Brooke?&rdquo; Harry said interrupting my thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm yeah?&rdquo; I said.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you take and pick Emma up from ballet today?&rdquo; Harry asked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be in the studio late today and I do-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what? Studio?&rdquo; I questioned and Harry sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;I should have known you didn&rsquo;t know when you didn&rsquo;t freak out about seeing me,&rdquo; Harry chuckled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a singer/songwriter&hellip; and actor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said surprised sipping your coffee, &ldquo;umm but to answer your question I would love to pick Emma up.&rdquo; I smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Harry smiled, &ldquo;for not making this a big deal about me being famous and all,&rdquo; Harry said as he made the girls a plate and handed it to them. &ldquo;You wanna give me your number so I can give you my garage code?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry handed me his phone and I took it and entered my number in and texted myself so I had his number and handed it back to him. Harry put his phone in his pocket and handed me a plate of pancakes. I laughed when I got it, he made a happy face using strawberry slices and whipped cream. Harry smiled at me and laughed a little at how cute my laugh was. We ate breakfast and talked about both of our jobs. I was an interior designer and absolutely loved what I did. I got to explore different styles and make it into a home for so many people.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you can help design my house,&rdquo; Harry said chewing on his last piece of bacon, &ldquo;it needs some work.&rdquo; He chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I think we can arrange that.&rdquo; I chuckled. I cleaned up our plates and stuck them in the dishwasher and started the machine.</p><p>&ldquo;Mummy, can we go to the park with Emma and Mr. Hawwy?&rdquo; Ava asked.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s if Mr. Harry wants to come.&rdquo; I said looking at Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;I can spare an hour to go with you guys.&rdquo; Harry shrugged smiling.</p><p>The girls cheered with laughter and ran to get their shoes on. I chuckled and went to my room and grabbing a sweater before meeting the girls and Harry at the front door and slipping on my shoes. The girls held hands as I opened the door and led them out and shutting it behind me when everyone was out. The park was down the street from where we lived and on a lovely day like today it was a great day to walk. The girls walked quickly towards the park with Harry and I following behind them.</p><p>&ldquo;So Mr. Harry,&rdquo; I said crossing my arms, &ldquo;how is life treating ya?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well life gave me a beautiful daughter,&rdquo; Harry smiled at her, &ldquo;and successful career so I would say pretty good. How bout you, Miss. Brooke?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, life gave me my beautiful daughter also,&rdquo; I chuckled, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s all I really need.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry smiled at me. We finally stumbled upon the park and the girls ran to play in the sandpit as Harry and I sat nearby. As I looked around the park, I saw many men with cameras in the far distance making me feel a bit uncomfortable.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s POV</p><p>As we sat down on the bench I see Brooke become uncomfortable with all the paparazzi around.</p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t pay them any attention lovie they won&rsquo;t bother ya.&rdquo; I whispered in her ear.</p><p>She looked at me and smiled before looking at the girls building a sand castle. As I looked at her, I took in her features, I couldn&rsquo;t help but love the way her eyes lit up everytime she talked about what she loved most, Ava. Or the way when she laughed or smiled, the dimple on her left cheek would appear. I could see from the corner of my eyes a group 2-4 girls approach where Brooke and I were sitting.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Harry can we get a picture with you.&rdquo; A girl squealed making me cringe. I proceeded to smile and nod before taking a picture with the group of girls before waving them off.</p><p>&ldquo;I should get going,&rdquo; I said looking at my watch, &ldquo;thank you again for doing this for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anytime neighbor.&rdquo; She said jokingly making me laugh as she waved me goodbye.</p><p>Brooke&rsquo;s POV</p><p>The rest of the day was filled with ballet lessons and a dinner and movie at Harry&rsquo;s house. It was getting pretty late so I tucked in the girls to sleep and sat on the couch watching tv and waited for Harry. My phone dinged and I checked my phone to see who it was.</p><p><i>'Sorry lovie, we&rsquo;re staying late in the studio tonight you can sleep in the guest room. Don&rsquo;t wait up.

The girls walked quickly towards the park with Harry and I following behind them.</p><p>\u201cSo Mr. Harry,\u201d I said crossing my arms, \u201chow is life treating ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell life gave me a beautiful daughter,\u201d Harry smiled at her, \u201cand successful career so I would say pretty good. How bout you, Miss. Brooke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, life gave me my beautiful daughter also,\u201d I chuckled, \u201cand that\u2019s all I really need.\u201d</p><p>Harry smiled at me. We finally stumbled upon the park and the girls ran to play in the sandpit as Harry and I sat nearby. As I looked around the park, I saw many men with cameras in the far distance making me feel a bit uncomfortable.</p><p>Harry\u2019s POV</p><p>As we sat down on the bench I see Brooke become uncomfortable with all the paparazzi around.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t pay them any attention lovie they won\u2019t bother ya.\u201d I whispered in her ear.</p><p>She looked at me and smiled before looking at the girls building a sand castle. As I looked at her, I took in her features, I couldn\u2019t help but love the way her eyes lit up everytime she talked about what she loved most, Ava. Or the way when she laughed or smiled, the dimple on her left cheek would appear. I could see from the corner of my eyes a group 2-4 girls approach where Brooke and I were sitting.</p><p>\u201cHi, Harry can we get a picture with you.\u201d A girl squealed making me cringe. I proceeded to smile and nod before taking a picture with the group of girls before waving them off.</p><p>\u201cI should get going,\u201d I said looking at my watch, \u201cthank you again for doing this for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime neighbor.\u201d She said jokingly making me laugh as she waved me goodbye.</p><p>Brooke\u2019s POV</p><p>The rest of the day was filled with ballet lessons and a dinner and movie at Harry\u2019s house. It was getting pretty late so I tucked in the girls to sleep and sat on the couch watching tv and waited for Harry. My phone dinged and I checked my phone to see who it was.</p><p><i>'Sorry lovie, we\u2019re staying late in the studio tonight you can sleep in the guest room. Don\u2019t wait up.

My phone dinged again.</p><p><i>P.s. if you need clothes, go ahead and grab something from my room.</i></p><p>I smiled even wider and made my way up to Harry\u2019s dark room and roamed around and stripped out of my clothes. I stumbled upon his t-shirts and slipped one on. It hung on my petite frame like a nightgown and I gathered my clothes folding them. I went into the guest room and laid down covering myself in the blankets before dozing off to sleep.</p></p>",

Thank you guys for all the love you guys have given me with all my stories so far it really means a lot! It all started with an essay I wrote about Harry and posting it on here and now I&rsquo;m writing some more ahaha. I hope you guys enjoy!<br /></p><p>\n\n<b><a href=\"https://tpwk-harrystyles.tumblr.com/post/183607920219/little-dancers\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 1</a></b>\n\n<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a21c3a9f233439dec0bc9b99e73c49c0/tumblr_inline_posvpa8JwE1w83g5u_500.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Brooke&rsquo;s POV</p><p>I woke up to the smell of bacon and the sounds of laughter from the kitchen. I got up wrapping the blanket around me and walking into the kitchen to find two little girls standing on chairs next to a tall frame.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning sleeping beauty,&rdquo; Harry chirped, &ldquo;sleep well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wet him in mummy.&rdquo; Ava giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;Ava what did we say about opening doors for strangers?&rdquo; I said sternly walking closer to her.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a stwanger though mummy.&rdquo; Ava smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but that isn&rsquo;t the point babe,&rdquo; &nbsp;I sighed kissing her head, &ldquo;if someone knocks on the door you come to get mummy okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m sowwy mummy.&rdquo; Ava spoke sincerely.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay baby.&rdquo; I said reaching past her sneaking a piece of bacon into my mouth. A fit of &lsquo;hey&rsquo;s&rsquo; filled the air making me giggle.</p><p>&ldquo;No stealing food before bweakfast.&rdquo; Emma pouted.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m just hungry.&rdquo; I said patting my stomach. Harry looked at me and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;I made some coffee and tea for ya lovie,&rdquo; Harry said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know which one you preferred so I made both.&rdquo; Harry smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I returned a smile to him, &ldquo;but I live for coffee,&rdquo; I sighed, &ldquo;Coffee is way better than tea.&rdquo; I made my way over to the coffee machine and poured myself a cup throwing a splash of creamer in just the way you like it.</p><p>&ldquo;That is a false statement lovie,&rdquo; Harry said flipping a pancake and then looking at me, &ldquo;tea is where it&rsquo;s at, isn&rsquo;t it Emma?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Emma giggles giving her father a high five.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay Styles,&rdquo; I chuckled, &ldquo;whatever you say, but coffee is and will always be number one in my heart.&rdquo; I said taking a seat at the island that sat in the middle of your kitchen.</p><p>Harry smiled as he continued to cook chocolate chip pancakes requested by the girls. As I &nbsp;sat there, I admire everything about Harry. His soft features and the way he treated the girls made my heart melt. I didn&rsquo;t want to get ahead of myself, Harry and I were simply just two parents of little girls who became best friends. But I couldn&rsquo;t shake off the feeling that maybe, just maybe, I might be catching feelings for the tall curly haired man.</p><p>&ldquo;Earth to Brooke?&rdquo; Harry said interrupting my thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm yeah?&rdquo; I said.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you take and pick Emma up from ballet today?&rdquo; Harry asked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be in the studio late today and I do-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what? Studio?&rdquo; I questioned and Harry sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;I should have known you didn&rsquo;t know when you didn&rsquo;t freak out about seeing me,&rdquo; Harry chuckled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a singer/songwriter&hellip; and actor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said surprised sipping your coffee, &ldquo;umm but to answer your question I would love to pick Emma up.&rdquo; I smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Harry smiled, &ldquo;for not making this a big deal about me being famous and all,&rdquo; Harry said as he made the girls a plate and handed it to them. &ldquo;You wanna give me your number so I can give you my garage code?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry handed me his phone and I took it and entered my number in and texted myself so I had his number and handed it back to him. Harry put his phone in his pocket and handed me a plate of pancakes. I laughed when I got it, he made a happy face using strawberry slices and whipped cream. Harry smiled at me and laughed a little at how cute my laugh was. We ate breakfast and talked about both of our jobs. I was an interior designer and absolutely loved what I did. I got to explore different styles and make it into a home for so many people.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you can help design my house,&rdquo; Harry said chewing on his last piece of bacon, &ldquo;it needs some work.&rdquo; He chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I think we can arrange that.&rdquo; I chuckled. I cleaned up our plates and stuck them in the dishwasher and started the machine.</p><p>&ldquo;Mummy, can we go to the park with Emma and Mr. Hawwy?&rdquo; Ava asked.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s if Mr. Harry wants to come.&rdquo; I said looking at Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;I can spare an hour to go with you guys.&rdquo; Harry shrugged smiling.</p><p>The girls cheered with laughter and ran to get their shoes on. I chuckled and went to my room and grabbing a sweater before meeting the girls and Harry at the front door and slipping on my shoes. The girls held hands as I opened the door and led them out and shutting it behind me when everyone was out. The park was down the street from where we lived and on a lovely day like today it was a great day to walk. The girls walked quickly towards the park with Harry and I following behind them.</p><p>&ldquo;So Mr. Harry,&rdquo; I said crossing my arms, &ldquo;how is life treating ya?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well life gave me a beautiful daughter,&rdquo; Harry smiled at her, &ldquo;and successful career so I would say pretty good.

I was about to throw a fit but he moved down my body, face coming to my weeping pussy.

His fist wrapped around his cock, tugging harshly before moaning my name and shooting his thick, hot load into my mouth, letting it drip down my rosy cheeks. </p>",

She sighed, already used to it but the stabbing pain in her chest didn\u2019t come any softer. She had just woken up and her mood was ruined, but she knew she couldn\u2019t let this affect her for the whole day.</p><p>Y/N slipped her feet into the fuzzy slippers by her side of the bed, feet shuffling lazily on the hardwood flooring leading to the bathroom where she freshened up for the day. Grabbing her towel, she hung it on the rack before sliding the glass door of the standing shower to the side to let her hand in through the crack and turn the water knob on. The stream of water took her by surprise, jumping a few centimeters off the ground. Y/N waited until it was warm enough for her liking before stripping off of her pajamas, leaving it huddled on the marble floor. </p><p>The hot jets massaged her sore muscles and wiped off the excess makeup that the makeup remover and night wash couldn\u2019t get off. It was relieving, to say the least, and she slowly felt her body relax against the open air of the shower space. While cleaning her body with soap, she was taken by surprise when a gruff voice cut off her slightly off time singing and cold arms wrapping themselves around her body. </p><p><i>\u201cHey love,\u201d</i> Harry murmured against the name of her neck. </p><p>She turned around to face him, her breath meeting the expanse of his tanned chest. Y/N inspected his face; glowing and bright. Although she was happy that his skin was thriving, the reasoning behind as to why that was was something that Y/N wasn\u2019t ready to proclaim. </p><p><i><b>\u201cWhen did you get home?\u201d </b></i>Y/N littered small kisses on his jawline, feeling the rough stubble of his five o\u2019clock shadow. </p><p><i>\u201cCouple of minutes ago,\u201d</i> He answered, tilting his head up to catch the water on his mop of hair, getting the strands wet and damp. </p><p>Y/N caught sight of the dark hickeys dotted on his neck\u2013and chest\u2013to which she hadn\u2019t seen earlier because of his unexpected arrival. The lighting glimmered a new area of his skin where marks of infidelity decorated him. Some of them were bruised while others were a light shading of red\u2014but all of them proved that Harry did shag the woman in the red dress last night. Somehow, Y/N had convinced herself to always see the good in Harry and that meant creating scenarios where he rejects any women who weren\u2019t her in their advances. She was sadly disproven once again. </p><p>Harry looked down at her when he felt her fingers tracing the bruises, hissing slightly when she tapped a bit harsher than usual. In an odd way, Y/N felt a sense of smugness knowing that he was hurting. She saw it as a way of punishing him for being away from her for another night. Another lonely time laying in bed where she wondered what she could\u2019ve done better. </p><p><i>\u201cOuch!\u201d</i> He wheezed, wincing at the pain when she pressed on the purple one by his left pec. </p><p>Y/N ignored his complaint, advising him to turn around so she could clean his back off the sweat and brine that must\u2019ve built up in the span of twenty-four hours. What she saw made her gasp; completely horrified by the scarlet lacerated marks striping his back muscles. </p><p><i>\u201cIs it that bad?</i>\u201d His head glanced over his shoulder, trying to catch a glimpse of the traces that caused a dull pain on his back. He knew they were there ever since he woke up this morning with a sore torso. The cab driver he hitched a ride for stared at him from the mirror when Harry jolted his back upright as soon as it rubbed against the leather seat, laughing sarcastically at his pain. </p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p><i>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d </i>The driver uttered, eyes catching his green ones once in a while. <i>\u201cDoes your lady know about this?\u201d</i></p><p>Harry fumed as he was not ready for the mimicry <i>this</i> early in the morning, <i>\u201cPlease keep quiet. I\u2019m paying you for your service,\u201d</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Yes, it was pretty bad. If anything, it looked like a rabid cat scratched its claws deep into his soft skin and ripped the first surface, resulting in welts. Y/N thought that some of them were even bleeding. </p><p><i><b>\u201cVery bad,\u201d </b></i></p><p>Harry and YN dried themselves off a few minutes later. Harry carefully patting his body dry to not irritate the swollen skin. </p><p>Y/N instructed him to lay down on the bed so that she could rub some ointment on the welt marks. <i><b>\u201cI hate this,\u201d</b></i></p><p>Harry hummed in response, completely clueless as to what she was talking about.<i> \u201cWhat do you hate?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThe marks, the hickeys and the scratches, H\u201d </i></b>She spoke mindlessly, her fingertip acquiring a penny sized amount. </p><p><i>\u201cAre you saying you want to end this?\u201d</i> This, as in, the open relationship they\u2019d placed upon them self. Either one of them could stop it at any time but Y/N couldn\u2019t bring herself to hold her ground. They\u2019ve not been like a normal couple in ages and if they did stop this, it would be difficult to act all sweetly\u2014like they didn\u2019t just love on another body weeks previous. <i>\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d</i></p><p>She shook her head, <i><b>\u201cN-no I don\u2019t\u201d</b></i> and she hated herself for being so weak\u2013despite what the media made her out to be\u2013because she was hurting twofold but seeing Harry take full advantage of their agreement made her feel guilty for taking away something that he enjoyed in his life<i><b>. \u201cI just don\u2019t like how they leave marks on you,\u201d</b></i></p><p>Harry scoffed, <i>\u201cSorry, some of them like it rough,\u201d</i></p><p>She pinched his skin between her fingers causing him to groan in pain. </p><p><i><b>\u201cI don\u2019t even know who they are but they always find a way to make themselves known,\u201d</b></i> Y/N said sadly.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t stupid\u2014of course, he was seeing people behind her back (and right in front of her) but if she didn\u2019t know their name or saw how they looked like\u2014she could pretend that they weren\u2019t real and it made her feel a bit better; delusional, but better. But seeing his skin tainted with their wake left her astonished at how gradually pieces of Harry was being taken from her hold. His heart was still hers\u2014as far as she was concerned\u2014but his body was being metaphorically split between women that she didn\u2019t know. Y/N was sharing her love with people who mostly only slept with him for the sake of it\u2014because of who <i>he</i> was and not because they shared the intimate affections that her and Harry once gave to each other. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>It was a stupid idea; emphasis on stupid. Looking back in retrospect, there were better ways to handle what had happened between the two of them. Y/N came home one day tired from shooting scenes for her new movie. One click to her phone downed her mood even more because of the news that Harry had been papped with Kendall at a club. Now, of course, they\u2019ve had talks about who to and not trust but the pictures spoke for themselves. </p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</b></i>\u00a0She said sternly as soon as Harry entered the doorway of their bedroom. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you saw,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d</b></i> Y/N crossed her arms across her chest, standing up from her having her legs crossed.<i><b> \u201cCare to explain yourself?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cI didn\u2019t cheat on you,\u201d</i> He noted right away.</p><p>She nodded, a small breath of relief made its way out of her mouth, <b><i>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know,\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI almost did, though\u201d</i> Harry admitted, eyes searching hers for some sort of emotion that he could use to justify his actions. Just like that, the weight on her shoulders dropped heavily. </p><p><b><i>\u201cY-you what?\u201d </i></b></p><p>He sighed, closing the gap between them and taking her hands into his large palms<i>. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie to you, Y/N. I almost kissed Kendall today, plenty of times actually, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at him,<b><i> \u201cSo what? Should I be grateful that you didn\u2019t kiss her?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying,\u201d</i> He answered, voice deepening in a tenor note, <i>\u201cI thought about it long and hard on the way home,</i>\u201d She cocked an eyebrow at him to continue. <i>\u201cI think it\u2019s better if we break it off,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cBreak it off?</b></i>\u201d Y/N repeated, annunciating his words. No matter how infuriated she was at him, she didn\u2019t think she could handle breaking up with Harry. </p><p>He gulped, Adam\u2019s apple bobbing in his throat, <i>\u201cIf I was having thoughts about kissing another girl, then maybe \u2026 maybe it would be best if we broke up,\u201d </i>Harry explain his thoughts briefly, <i>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to cheat on you either,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cDo you like her?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Harry\u2019s curls bounced when he shook his head, <b><i>\u201cDo you still love me?</i></b>\u201d He nodded, <b><i>\u201cThen why are you leaving me?\u201d</i></b></p><p>His palm glossed over his angelic features, <i>\u201cI just wanted to try kissing her,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d </i></b>Y/N concluded. <i>What kind of sick joke was he playing at?</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know it\u2019s crazy but please try to understand. I\u2019m trying to figure this out too,\u201d </i></p><p>And from then, she briefly remembered her old self suggesting an open relationship. Her friend had talked about it once before, indicating that it was the best decision she\u2019d ever made in her life. Both partners were free to fuck and kiss any other person but their hearts were still loyal to each other. Y/N found it quite concerning as she believed that if two people really loved each other\u2014then they would give everything in exchange, even their bodies and not just their hearts. However, it also gave both parties freedom and liberation to explore something that their current partners might not be into\u2014it was something that greatly defined Y/N and causes her to shiver in disgust. Sure, she preferred as others would call \u2018<i>vanilla</i>\u2019 sex most of the time, but that was only because she would like to be cared for in her most vulnerable moments; she didn\u2019t know that it would be the cause of a massive downfall in her and Harry\u2019s relationship. </p><p>They were both busy and it was pretty accurate. Y/N didn\u2019t have <i>enough</i> time for Harry and Harry certainly didn\u2019t make her feel any special in the few months leading up to their decision of such a relationship. So it was no surprise that Harry jumped at the opportunity when she suggested it. His eyes twinkled in delight and his smile held a certain degree of mischief that would soon be expressed in rough fucking the next day. Needless to say, YN had to sit through the story of how Harry absolutely ruined Kendall (in terms of orgasms). She didn\u2019t ask, but he was too excited to thank her for her suggestion. The marks on his hips confirmed his words and truth to be told, she almost gagged while Y/N was riding him. </p><p>She felt absolutely used and dirty knowing that another woman had touched him the way she was doing it right now and he didn\u2019t even seem bothered! The bliss on his face kept her going, hoping that he would cease his actions right at the beginning and realize that he didn\u2019t need other women because Y/N was there for him\u2014in more ways than one. </p><p>Obviously, it didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>As soon as pictures of Shawn and Y/N were released on the Internet, there was no doubt that Harry\u2019s blood boiled upon seeing it. \u00a0His eyes widened at the phone screen and he gaped at Y/N getting dressed at one corner of the room while sat back the bed with his legs stretched out. <i>Of course</i>, they were going to be leaving with each other; Harry saw the looks they gave one another. <i>How dare she lecture him about the marks on his body when she herself was getting tainted?</i></p><p>He was agitated, to say the least\u2014nostrils flaring wild with thoughts building on top of one another and he couldn\u2019t help but say, <i>\u201cHow was Shawn last night?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N paused all her actions, slowly turning around with a confused face, <b><i>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cOh come on, Y/N,\u201d</i> Harry chuckled sarcastically. <i>\u201cHe fucked you last night, didn\u2019t he? Was he good?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cHarry, wha\u2013? He took me home because he saw that you left and\u2013,\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cNo need to lie. I saw the pictures,\u201d </i>Rolling his eyes, he fumbled with his phone to turn the brightness up, <i>\u201cI always tell you about my escapades, why don\u2019t you tell me any of yours?\u201d</i> He questioned, leaning over to show her the pictures dating from last night. </p><p><i>Because I don\u2019t have any \u2018escapades\u2019</i>, she thought. </p><p><b><i>\u201cIt\u2019s because I haven\u2019t slept with anyone,\u201d</i></b></p><p>Harry furrowed his brows, forehead scrunching,<i> \u201cIn a while?\u201d</i></p><p>She shook her head, stammering a bit from her unplanned confession, \u201c<b><i>N-no, in ever,\u201d </i></b>Her fingers twist the button of her jeans, tightening the fabric around her waist, the blouse she\u2019d picked for today matched the black denim; everything went well the dark jeans.<b><i> \u201cI haven\u2019t slept with anyone except you,\u201d</i></b></p><p>He gasped incredulously, \u201c<i>Really</i>?\u201d He then doubled over in cackling laughter, <i>\u201cThat\u2019s a funny joke, now tell me the truth. How many has it been? 3? 5?\u201d </i>He muttered while counting on his fingers,<i> \u201cI know mine is at least 23, plus last night would be 24,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N shifted her soles uncomfortably in her socks. She definitely didn\u2019t need to know how many women Harry had fooled around with, she didn\u2019t even <i>need</i> to see him recount every one of them in perfect memory as if they all did something memorable to him. </p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Harry was taken aback at her confession. He figured that Y/N must\u2019ve fooled around with somebody else <i>at least </i>once. Now he didn\u2019t know if she was lying about the number of her flings to make him feel guilty because he had taken full advantage of what this relationship had to offer. </p><p>Deep inside, he knew that <i>if</i> she did begin to talk about other men like he did with women\u2013he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the jealousy bubbling inside of him. It\u2019s not like he could control what he says any better either; it would be a big mess. All in all, he was glad that she avoided talking about men in front of him. </p><p>He can always claim to love her\u2013he does, by the way\u2013but at times he gets antsy in his pants because she could walk in the door at any time and break it off with him. Even though his body was not entirely hers, his heart was a piece of him that she will forever carry in her dainty hands. He had decided long ago that nobody took better care of him other than Y/N, and he was eternally grateful for her ability to withstand his mistakes and misfortunes. </p><p>Harry didn\u2019t like the idea of his girl hanging around with other guys and he was aware that Y/N wasn\u2019t too fond of him being around various women often. However, both of them were too coward to actually <i>say</i> something to each other. They knew each other very well, but not at this topic. This topic was blurry and foggy, and they had no sense of <i>what</i> to do to stop this. Both of them would probably project their feelings and ideas to one another, and it would only create an even bigger mess because their pride was too huge to push aside. </p><p>The fact the Y/N doesn\u2019t share about her experiences caused Harry to think of the worst, <i>that</i> being that her tendency to not make him a part of it meant that she must be doing it secretly\u2013 as if he was doing it behind his back, times two. If Y/N did go out with another guy, she was doing it very sneakily as the press hadn\u2019t caught her and her arm candy. She <i>must</i> be going out on dates when he was out of the house. Maybe she even brought them back in their home and fucked them on the marble kitchen counter. Not once had she called about canceling dinner plans or meetings so she <i>must</i> be doing it while Harry was off fucking the brains out of some random chick whom he\u2019d have to force to sign an NDA later on. </p><p>It worried him sometimes if the person she was with treated her right. Y/N wasn\u2019t the type of girl that you hump and dump; if the articles were right about something, it would be that she was the kindest, most humble woman in the business that you would probably feel physically sick if you made a frown etched on her face. He knew he had no right to swipe left on who she wanted to see, much like how he preferred for her to stay out of his decisions on who take home at night.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>It was the third day in a row where Harry forgot to pick up Y/N on set. He was on a break from writing and basically everything so it shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem to get a sense of time and pick up his girlfriend from her filming location. She was sitting at the black leather seats at the front lobby of the building, dressed in the outfit she left in earlier this morning. Her hair was done up in the \u201970s do to get the vibe of the part she was supposed to play. All Y/N wanted was to wash the hairspray off of her hair and wipe the makeup from her face, but she couldn\u2019t do that unless she was home. There were already some fans outside the tinted glass windows who caught wind of her whereabouts and she had already interacted with them.</p><p><i>Still no Harry.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey Y/N. Sorry, I\u2019m late,</i>\u201d Harry huffed, his hair wildly curly for it to be the work of the spring breeze. There were marks on his neck and his pupils were blown wild. <i>Of course.</i></p><p>As much as she felt repulsed at his audacity to show up late looking he had just had the best fuck of his life, all Y/N really wanted to do was eat some dinner and cuddle with him\u2013after he had taken a shower. </p><p><b><i>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d</i></b> She muttered quietly, voice a little hoarse from how much she had to rehearse to get her lines accurate. <i><b>\u201c\u2018M tired.\u201d </b></i>Burying her head on his chest was a giant mistake because as soon as she was in proper distance from him, a sweet scent hit her nostrils and her earlier suspicion was confirmed. </p><p><i>\u201cAw bub, how about we go home, hmm?</i>\u201d He felt her head nodding against his shirt causing him to look down at her in admiration. She was such a hard-working woman who was determined to achieve greatness. <i>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d</i></p><p>Upon settling in Harry\u2019s car, Y/N lazily buckled in her safety belt and sat patiently while Harry rounded the front of the vehicle to get to the other side. He opened the door and got comfortable as well before starting the roar of the engine and shifted the gear to reverse, pulling out of his parking space. </p><p><i><b>\u201cSo I was thinking maybe we could cook dinner together,\u201d</b></i> She started. \u201c<i><b>We\u2019ll cook your favorite, then we can watch a movie in bed while cuddling like we used to</b></i>.\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes softened at the thought of being affectionate with Harry. <i><b>\u201cWhat do you say, H?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He hummed in response, not saying much else. Y/N assumed it was because of the heavy traffic that kept his attention on the road. She didn\u2019t mind though, just knowing that his presence with near her made her feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. They hadn\u2019t been together much, not even at nights where it should be reserved. He was always off staying at some lady\u2019s chateau and as much as she was glad that he was safe; she wished and preferred that he would\u2013one day\u2013pick their home as a safe haven.</p><p>Y/N must\u2019ve taken a bit of nap because she was woken up with a slight shake to her shoulder. Harry smiled at her gently, informing her that they were home. She adjusted her eyes to the bright space of their house, lights guiding the way to the cobblestone pathway to the front door. She grasped the handle of the car, pulling it towards her while using her other hand to push the entrapment in order to exit. Y/N was about to swing her legs over the seat when she realized that Harry was entitled to his phone which was buzzing repeatedly in his hand.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>H</b></i>?\u201d Y/N called out but to no avail. He was biting his lip, tearing the skin slightly. <i><b>\u201cHarry?</b></i>\u201d She questioned again but all she received was the soft purr of the engine.<i><b> \u201cHarry!\u201d</b></i></p><p>The rising volume of her voice snapped him out of his electronic trance, \u201c<i>Yeah</i>?\u201d</p><p>Y/N scoffed to herself, rolling her eyes minutely before asking:<b><i> \u201cWhat do you say about dinner?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cOh, uhm, I think it would be a great idea but\u2013,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cGreat! Then we can pick a movie and cuddle afterward, yeah?\u201d </i></b>She interrupted, feeling excitement vibrating through her bones. </p><p><i>\u201cActually, I\u2019m busy tonight,</i>\u201d He admitted sheepishly, dimple popping in a slight indent. <i>\u201cMaybe some other time?\u201d</i></p><p>His answer got Y/N speechless and her mouth was dropping open and closed in a matter of seconds.<i><b> \u201cWhere are you going? Is there something wrong?\u201d </b></i>The concern in her voice was enough to make him feel a bit guilty.</p><p><i>\u201cNo actually\u2013 I uh\u2013,\u201d</i> The buzz of his phone distracted his train of thought and his eyes widened when his thumbprint unlocked his cell. Harry whispered a breathy \u2018<i>fuck</i>\u2019, not meaning for Y/N to hear it. </p><p>Y/N shifted her hand to rest on the cushion of the car seat, reaching over to grab Harry\u2019s phone from his clutch. She could see his fingers trying to grasp on the air where his phone used to be, his eyes growing wide when he witnessed his girlfriend glance down at the white screen illuminating her face. </p><p>It showcased a conversation between him and a girl named Chloe. Y/N inspected the messages they had sent each other in the past minute and she almost gagged.</p><p>***</p><p><b>You think you can sneak away for a bit? Y/N gets to spend almost every day with you! Come on, I can cook you dinner and offer a show\u2026</b></p><p>She rolled her eyes at the atrocity of the message the woman sent, but it wasn\u2019t anything compared to Harry\u2019s reply. </p><p><i>Mm, you definitely know how to persuade someone into giving you what you want. I\u2019ll make something up. I expect you to be waiting for me in an hour or so. </i></p><p><i>The show would be even better if you wore the white panties you were wearing yesterday</i></p><p>It was a simple request that caused Y/N\u2019s heart to pound for attention to be soothed, yet she couldn\u2019t do anything else but let her thumb scroll down further. A part of her wanted to blow up, throw the phone on the ground and watch it shatter in pieces; much like how her heart felt after comprehending the filthy messages. Another, more sensible, part of her wanted to calmly return his pain-inducing device calmly and not give him the satisfaction of seeing her eyes well up with tears. </p><p><b>Of course, I bought them as per your request. I know white lingerie is your favorite.</b></p><p><i>It is when I take it off your body,</i></p><p><b>I need you Harry</b></p><p><i>Im coming. I expect you to be naked.</i></p><p>Her throat was dry and she still had a bit of trouble understanding the lengths he was willing to go through just to fuck some girl. He was planning on blatantly lying to her about his plans for the evening and showed no hesitation of leaving dear Y/N once again for the umpteenth time. </p><p><i><b>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll be spending tonight with just me,\u201d</b></i> Y/N chuckled bitterly, having half the mind on locking his phone to try to erase the messages somehow before handing it back to him. Harry stared at the phone as if it would burn his skin if it touched him; it felt like it to Y/N, too. </p><p>She proceeded with her previous actions, stepping off the vehicle and slamming the door shut before Harry could say anything. Y/N fumbled with the keys on the walk over to the front door, rushing to find the right one. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cY/N, wait!\u201d </i>Harry pulled on her arm, making her face him. <i>\u201cI-i, you weren\u2019t supposed to see that,\u201d</i> His tone was demeaning as if it was <i>her</i> fault that she was hurt.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Obviously I wasn\u2019t. What did I expect asking you for dinner and a movie?\u201d </b></i>She admitted, attitude going down in the dumps and a little sourer. <i><b>\u201cGuess I\u2019m always last on the list, huh?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He shook his head fast that it was dizzying,<i> \u201cNo you\u2019re not,</i>\u201d She lifted a hand to silence him from his unprepared excuses, \u201c<i><b>Save it. Just go.\u201d</b></i></p><p>And with that, Harry was left immobilized on the gravel while Y/N skipped towards the front door. She made eye contact with him before shutting the door against the frame. </p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Y/N was disheartened that her long and tiring day only sought to be more disappointing than she had expected.<i> How could she ever think Harry would be able to deliver with her request?</i> He was busy pleasing other woman and to even think of satisfying Y/N was swirling down the drain. </p><p>She huffed, annoyed at his ability to piss her off every twenty minutes. This was who they were behind closed doors. The speculations of their fans and the prying articles of news outlets could have never guessed that precious Y/N and Harry were not as innocent as they appeared to be. This had been their scenario for the past couple of months. This was them now; this is Harry \u2026</p><p>But this <i>isn\u2019t</i> Y/N and maybe it\u2019s time for a change.</p><p>As YN picked up the light case of her phone, she tapped unto her contact list and found the name she\u2019d been searching for. He had frequented in dropping hints about how he found her attractive, but of course, Y/N never felt objectified because his charm glazed him with an ability to soften the tough barricades of her heart. He was respectful to her <i>and</i> to Harry and kept his distance away from Y/N even though he was looking at her with lustful eyes during the Nolan premier. His self-control was amazing, Y/N gave him that. The way he focused on her with such an intense gaze made her squirm in her seat and partly wished that it was Harry who couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off her.</p><p>There had always been sexual tension present in the air between them, but neither parties acted upon it because of who they were. Not only would it cause a big scandal, but they were afraid that it would ruin their friendship with each other. Y/N cared too much and he would rather have her as a friend if he couldn\u2019t have her as a significant other.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s fingers tapped on the keyboard with fresh speed; a sentence that she had never thought should, or be able to type.</p><p><i><b>\u201cCome over and fuck me.\u201d</b></i></p><p>She waited until the text was titled \u2018<i>sent</i>\u2019, before taking a quick shower and slipping into some <i>white</i> lace lingerie that complimented the curves of her body. Y/N popped the cork of a wine bottle as well, setting it on the bedside table and grabbed to clear glasses in the kitchen. After some time, the doorbell rang and she had sprinted down the stairs, walking the last few meters to catch her breath and swung the door open.</p><p>Y/N scanned the man in front of her, dressed in a simple white tee and grey sweats that showed off his bulge that she had wondered about frequently. The shared a small smile with each other, a twinkle in their eyes.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey Shawn,\u201d</b></i> Y/N greeted before feeling a pair of lips pressed against her own. Her chest landing on his broad pane. Somewhere in the distance, the front door slammed shut and her body got pinned on the wood. He groaned lightly against her mouth when she traced a finger on his neck, grazing over the generic soft spot, feeling him shiver with delight and her lashes flutter on her cheeks.</p><p>She should\u2019ve done this sooner. </p><p>\u2014-</p><p>ok not gonna lie, I feel like I totally rushed this but my schedule is getting busier and busier and I didn\u2019t wanna leave you guys yearning for more so ta-da! :D</p><p><br/></p><p>I think the 3rd part will contain some filth?? my FIRST smut fix and sksksksk </p><p><b>permanent taglist;\u00a0</b> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\">@ynm1505</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllO8kf7mHbYqWkUel7PGCQ\">@kissme-hs</a>   <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdJF3NJteLUvYL-8VwYgb4Q\">@agoddamnmango</a>   <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moDJn5hX6SkRScTXK72OY6A\">@harrys-kingdom</a>   <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_IeDacUKwJGZbqRtfMWzvQ\">@calums-sugarbaby</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYw6F23YjyqNBkPppNmZASQ\">@queenbeestuffs</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP9U8Ifzi0uGrwDvrygbINQ\">@ashkuuuu</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9pZWnOrrY9h5VJS1URecA\">@kettxo</a> @send-me-styles <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXoQhCPkZyNoq-dkMBzcGA\">@littledreamybeth</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx5Qf5iESVyZePbw9HHz9A\">@trustfulhaz</a> @harrysfeastedflower <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\">@harrystxleslx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk_fg5KH2srp5CoqMWt16iA\">@befourep</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m28p46mWBXKJFhf-csISF6Q\">@moonandstars-xo</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\">@babebenhardy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@swayingnoodlelove</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvJqvn1gEbScr1BTBfGYCw\">@mendesromano</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mELeQ4zjqQjlY7Fxyz3V4jQ\">@harrystylinsince1994</a> 4 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-cUeGpvGXwzOTwYC4IGohQ\">@juliassgem</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPlhoPKTgOFq8MXJNqtHlBA\">@miscll-fangirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meMMUmrzulyFF4z1Gr5JhyA\">@little-dragon-ate-my-heart</a> </p><p><b>jalboyh taglist;\u00a0</b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a>\u00a0@officiallyunofficalperson\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnfJgBWousYCdg-N8HVKFKg\">@gviosca</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maUEy5XG795w6hoVUqreFUQ\">@llandaaa</a> @mutuallynotmutual\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSwWtUn-ks_CNxtFgLmlK9w\">@mellamolayla</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhPHBijWPp3yEYQxB4U16Tg\">@madformichael</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9qoGsz943Swrb53iZblgJQ\">@toolazymyguy</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrnGlwLdLeF4IPiM_hq5LUw\">@sauveteen</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muOXh77x_A7MHx-DA-KYz_A\">@rebelflower19</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPTLc1wiL8ihmbcx3E_gbSQ\">@myfangirlworld</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnLWb3UwvV0gfgjl6P1SSYg\">@stella95827</a> @katelynmusic\u00a0@loganmay19\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkx2X828MT00novhWw8Snjw\">@calssunflower</a> </p><p>\u200b</p>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>Just A Little Bit of Your Heart (2)</h1><p><b><i>Summary: Harry and Y/N are in an open relationship</i></b></p><p><b><i>Warnings: angst and a teensy bit of smut?</i></b></p><p><b><i>Word Count: 4870 words</i></b></p><h2><b><i>A/N: unedited cause it\u2019s late at night but I wanna post it now so I could read your guys\u2019 comments tomorrow morning :)</i></b></h2><p>Y/N woke up with no indents of Harry\u2019s body creased on the navy blue sheets of their bed, indicating that he didn\u2019t come home last night and probably spent the rest of the evening at some lesser known hotel to avoid the attention. She sighed, already used to it but the stabbing pain in her chest didn\u2019t come any softer. She had just woken up and her mood was ruined, but she knew she couldn\u2019t let this affect her for the whole day.</p><p>Y/N slipped her feet into the fuzzy slippers by her side of the bed, feet shuffling lazily on the hardwood flooring leading to the bathroom where she freshened up for the day. Grabbing her towel, she hung it on the rack before sliding the glass door of the standing shower to the side to let her hand in through the crack and turn the water knob on. The stream of water took her by surprise, jumping a few centimeters off the ground. Y/N waited until it was warm enough for her liking before stripping off of her pajamas, leaving it huddled on the marble floor. </p><p>The hot jets massaged her sore muscles and wiped off the excess makeup that the makeup remover and night wash couldn\u2019t get off. It was relieving, to say the least, and she slowly felt her body relax against the open air of the shower space. While cleaning her body with soap, she was taken by surprise when a gruff voice cut off her slightly off time singing and cold arms wrapping themselves around her body. </p><p><i>\u201cHey love,\u201d</i> Harry murmured against the name of her neck. </p><p>She turned around to face him, her breath meeting the expanse of his tanned chest. Y/N inspected his face; glowing and bright. Although she was happy that his skin was thriving, the reasoning behind as to why that was was something that Y/N wasn\u2019t ready to proclaim. </p><p><i><b>\u201cWhen did you get home?\u201d </b></i>Y/N littered small kisses on his jawline, feeling the rough stubble of his five o\u2019clock shadow. </p><p><i>\u201cCouple of minutes ago,\u201d</i> He answered, tilting his head up to catch the water on his mop of hair, getting the strands wet and damp. </p><p>Y/N caught sight of the dark hickeys dotted on his neck\u2013and chest\u2013to which she hadn\u2019t seen earlier because of his unexpected arrival. The lighting glimmered a new area of his skin where marks of infidelity decorated him. Some of them were bruised while others were a light shading of red\u2014but all of them proved that Harry did shag the woman in the red dress last night. Somehow, Y/N had convinced herself to always see the good in Harry and that meant creating scenarios where he rejects any women who weren\u2019t her in their advances. She was sadly disproven once again. </p><p>Harry looked down at her when he felt her fingers tracing the bruises, hissing slightly when she tapped a bit harsher than usual. In an odd way, Y/N felt a sense of smugness knowing that he was hurting. She saw it as a way of punishing him for being away from her for another night. Another lonely time laying in bed where she wondered what she could\u2019ve done better. </p><p><i>\u201cOuch!\u201d</i> He wheezed, wincing at the pain when she pressed on the purple one by his left pec. </p><p>Y/N ignored his complaint, advising him to turn around so she could clean his back off the sweat and brine that must\u2019ve built up in the span of twenty-four hours. What she saw made her gasp; completely horrified by the scarlet lacerated marks striping his back muscles. </p><p><i>\u201cIs it that bad?</i>\u201d His head glanced over his shoulder, trying to catch a glimpse of the traces that caused a dull pain on his back. He knew they were there ever since he woke up this morning with a sore torso. The cab driver he hitched a ride for stared at him from the mirror when Harry jolted his back upright as soon as it rubbed against the leather seat, laughing sarcastically at his pain. </p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p><i>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d </i>The driver uttered, eyes catching his green ones once in a while. <i>\u201cDoes your lady know about this?\u201d</i></p><p>Harry fumed as he was not ready for the mimicry <i>this</i> early in the morning, <i>\u201cPlease keep quiet. I\u2019m paying you for your service,\u201d</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Yes, it was pretty bad. If anything, it looked like a rabid cat scratched its claws deep into his soft skin and ripped the first surface, resulting in welts. Y/N thought that some of them were even bleeding. </p><p><i><b>\u201cVery bad,\u201d </b></i></p><p>Harry and YN dried themselves off a few minutes later. Harry carefully patting his body dry to not irritate the swollen skin. </p><p>Y/N instructed him to lay down on the bed so that she could rub some ointment on the welt marks. <i><b>\u201cI hate this,\u201d</b></i></p><p>Harry hummed in response, completely clueless as to what she was talking about.<i> \u201cWhat do you hate?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThe marks, the hickeys and the scratches, H\u201d </i></b>She spoke mindlessly, her fingertip acquiring a penny sized amount. </p><p><i>\u201cAre you saying you want to end this?\u201d</i> This, as in, the open relationship they\u2019d placed upon them self. Either one of them could stop it at any time but Y/N couldn\u2019t bring herself to hold her ground. They\u2019ve not been like a normal couple in ages and if they did stop this, it would be difficult to act all sweetly\u2014like they didn\u2019t just love on another body weeks previous. <i>\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d</i></p><p>She shook her head, <i><b>\u201cN-no I don\u2019t\u201d</b></i> and she hated herself for being so weak\u2013despite what the media made her out to be\u2013because she was hurting twofold but seeing Harry take full advantage of their agreement made her feel guilty for taking away something that he enjoyed in his life<i><b>. \u201cI just don\u2019t like how they leave marks on you,\u201d</b></i></p><p>Harry scoffed, <i>\u201cSorry, some of them like it rough,\u201d</i></p><p>She pinched his skin between her fingers causing him to groan in pain. </p><p><i><b>\u201cI don\u2019t even know who they are but they always find a way to make themselves known,\u201d</b></i> Y/N said sadly.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t stupid\u2014of course, he was seeing people behind her back (and right in front of her) but if she didn\u2019t know their name or saw how they looked like\u2014she could pretend that they weren\u2019t real and it made her feel a bit better; delusional, but better. But seeing his skin tainted with their wake left her astonished at how gradually pieces of Harry was being taken from her hold. His heart was still hers\u2014as far as she was concerned\u2014but his body was being metaphorically split between women that she didn\u2019t know. Y/N was sharing her love with people who mostly only slept with him for the sake of it\u2014because of who <i>he</i> was and not because they shared the intimate affections that her and Harry once gave to each other. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>It was a stupid idea; emphasis on stupid. Looking back in retrospect, there were better ways to handle what had happened between the two of them. Y/N came home one day tired from shooting scenes for her new movie. One click to her phone downed her mood even more because of the news that Harry had been papped with Kendall at a club. Now, of course, they\u2019ve had talks about who to and not trust but the pictures spoke for themselves. </p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</b></i>\u00a0She said sternly as soon as Harry entered the doorway of their bedroom. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you saw,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d</b></i> Y/N crossed her arms across her chest, standing up from her having her legs crossed.<i><b> \u201cCare to explain yourself?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cI didn\u2019t cheat on you,\u201d</i> He noted right away.</p><p>She nodded, a small breath of relief made its way out of her mouth, <b><i>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know,\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI almost did, though\u201d</i> Harry admitted, eyes searching hers for some sort of emotion that he could use to justify his actions. Just like that, the weight on her shoulders dropped heavily. </p><p><b><i>\u201cY-you what?\u201d </i></b></p><p>He sighed, closing the gap between them and taking her hands into his large palms<i>. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie to you, Y/N. I almost kissed Kendall today, plenty of times actually, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at him,<b><i> \u201cSo what? Should I be grateful that you didn\u2019t kiss her?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying,\u201d</i> He answered, voice deepening in a tenor note, <i>\u201cI thought about it long and hard on the way home,</i>\u201d She cocked an eyebrow at him to continue. <i>\u201cI think it\u2019s better if we break it off,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cBreak it off?</b></i>\u201d Y/N repeated, annunciating his words. No matter how infuriated she was at him, she didn\u2019t think she could handle breaking up with Harry. </p><p>He gulped, Adam\u2019s apple bobbing in his throat, <i>\u201cIf I was having thoughts about kissing another girl, then maybe \u2026 maybe it would be best if we broke up,\u201d </i>Harry explain his thoughts briefly, <i>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to cheat on you either,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cDo you like her?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Harry\u2019s curls bounced when he shook his head, <b><i>\u201cDo you still love me?</i></b>\u201d He nodded, <b><i>\u201cThen why are you leaving me?\u201d</i></b></p><p>His palm glossed over his angelic features, <i>\u201cI just wanted to try kissing her,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d </i></b>Y/N concluded. <i>What kind of sick joke was he playing at?</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know it\u2019s crazy but please try to understand. I\u2019m trying to figure this out too,\u201d </i></p><p>And from then, she briefly remembered her old self suggesting an open relationship. Her friend had talked about it once before, indicating that it was the best decision she\u2019d ever made in her life. Both partners were free to fuck and kiss any other person but their hearts were still loyal to each other. Y/N found it quite concerning as she believed that if two people really loved each other\u2014then they would give everything in exchange, even their bodies and not just their hearts. However, it also gave both parties freedom and liberation to explore something that their current partners might not be into\u2014it was something that greatly defined Y/N and causes her to shiver in disgust. Sure, she preferred as others would call \u2018<i>vanilla</i>\u2019 sex most of the time, but that was only because she would like to be cared for in her most vulnerable moments; she didn\u2019t know that it would be the cause of a massive downfall in her and Harry\u2019s relationship. </p><p>They were both busy and it was pretty accurate. Y/N didn\u2019t have <i>enough</i> time for Harry and Harry certainly didn\u2019t make her feel any special in the few months leading up to their decision of such a relationship. So it was no surprise that Harry jumped at the opportunity when she suggested it. His eyes twinkled in delight and his smile held a certain degree of mischief that would soon be expressed in rough fucking the next day. Needless to say, YN had to sit through the story of how Harry absolutely ruined Kendall (in terms of orgasms). She didn\u2019t ask, but he was too excited to thank her for her suggestion. The marks on his hips confirmed his words and truth to be told, she almost gagged while Y/N was riding him. </p><p>She felt absolutely used and dirty knowing that another woman had touched him the way she was doing it right now and he didn\u2019t even seem bothered! The bliss on his face kept her going, hoping that he would cease his actions right at the beginning and realize that he didn\u2019t need other women because Y/N was there for him\u2014in more ways than one. </p><p>Obviously, it didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>As soon as pictures of Shawn and Y/N were released on the Internet, there was no doubt that Harry\u2019s blood boiled upon seeing it. \u00a0His eyes widened at the phone screen and he gaped at Y/N getting dressed at one corner of the room while sat back the bed with his legs stretched out. <i>Of course</i>, they were going to be leaving with each other; Harry saw the looks they gave one another. <i>How dare she lecture him about the marks on his body when she herself was getting tainted?</i></p><p>He was agitated, to say the least\u2014nostrils flaring wild with thoughts building on top of one another and he couldn\u2019t help but say, <i>\u201cHow was Shawn last night?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N paused all her actions, slowly turning around with a confused face, <b><i>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cOh come on, Y/N,\u201d</i> Harry chuckled sarcastically. <i>\u201cHe fucked you last night, didn\u2019t he? Was he good?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cHarry, wha\u2013? He took me home because he saw that you left and\u2013,\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cNo need to lie. I saw the pictures,\u201d </i>Rolling his eyes, he fumbled with his phone to turn the brightness up, <i>\u201cI always tell you about my escapades, why don\u2019t you tell me any of yours?\u201d</i> He questioned, leaning over to show her the pictures dating from last night. </p><p><i>Because I don\u2019t have any \u2018escapades\u2019</i>, she thought. </p><p><b><i>\u201cIt\u2019s because I haven\u2019t slept with anyone,\u201d</i></b></p><p>Harry furrowed his brows, forehead scrunching,<i> \u201cIn a while?\u201d</i></p><p>She shook her head, stammering a bit from her unplanned confession, \u201c<b><i>N-no, in ever,\u201d </i></b>Her fingers twist the button of her jeans, tightening the fabric around her waist, the blouse she\u2019d picked for today matched the black denim; everything went well the dark jeans.<b><i> \u201cI haven\u2019t slept with anyone except you,\u201d</i></b></p><p>He gasped incredulously, \u201c<i>Really</i>?\u201d He then doubled over in cackling laughter, <i>\u201cThat\u2019s a funny joke, now tell me the truth. How many has it been? 3? 5?\u201d </i>He muttered while counting on his fingers,<i> \u201cI know mine is at least 23, plus last night would be 24,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N shifted her soles uncomfortably in her socks. She definitely didn\u2019t need to know how many women Harry had fooled around with, she didn\u2019t even <i>need</i> to see him recount every one of them in perfect memory as if they all did something memorable to him. </p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Harry was taken aback at her confession. He figured that Y/N must\u2019ve fooled around with somebody else <i>at least </i>once. Now he didn\u2019t know if she was lying about the number of her flings to make him feel guilty because he had taken full advantage of what this relationship had to offer. </p><p>Deep inside, he knew that <i>if</i> she did begin to talk about other men like he did with women\u2013he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the jealousy bubbling inside of him. It\u2019s not like he could control what he says any better either; it would be a big mess. All in all, he was glad that she avoided talking about men in front of him. </p><p>He can always claim to love her\u2013he does, by the way\u2013but at times he gets antsy in his pants because she could walk in the door at any time and break it off with him. Even though his body was not entirely hers, his heart was a piece of him that she will forever carry in her dainty hands. He had decided long ago that nobody took better care of him other than Y/N, and he was eternally grateful for her ability to withstand his mistakes and misfortunes. </p><p>Harry didn\u2019t like the idea of his girl hanging around with other guys and he was aware that Y/N wasn\u2019t too fond of him being around various women often. However, both of them were too coward to actually <i>say</i> something to each other. They knew each other very well, but not at this topic. This topic was blurry and foggy, and they had no sense of <i>what</i> to do to stop this. Both of them would probably project their feelings and ideas to one another, and it would only create an even bigger mess because their pride was too huge to push aside. </p><p>The fact the Y/N doesn\u2019t share about her experiences caused Harry to think of the worst, <i>that</i> being that her tendency to not make him a part of it meant that she must be doing it secretly\u2013 as if he was doing it behind his back, times two. If Y/N did go out with another guy, she was doing it very sneakily as the press hadn\u2019t caught her and her arm candy. She <i>must</i> be going out on dates when he was out of the house. Maybe she even brought them back in their home and fucked them on the marble kitchen counter. Not once had she called about canceling dinner plans or meetings so she <i>must</i> be doing it while Harry was off fucking the brains out of some random chick whom he\u2019d have to force to sign an NDA later on. </p><p>It worried him sometimes if the person she was with treated her right. Y/N wasn\u2019t the type of girl that you hump and dump; if the articles were right about something, it would be that she was the kindest, most humble woman in the business that you would probably feel physically sick if you made a frown etched on her face. He knew he had no right to swipe left on who she wanted to see, much like how he preferred for her to stay out of his decisions on who take home at night.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>It was the third day in a row where Harry forgot to pick up Y/N on set. He was on a break from writing and basically everything so it shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem to get a sense of time and pick up his girlfriend from her filming location. She was sitting at the black leather seats at the front lobby of the building, dressed in the outfit she left in earlier this morning. Her hair was done up in the \u201970s do to get the vibe of the part she was supposed to play. All Y/N wanted was to wash the hairspray off of her hair and wipe the makeup from her face, but she couldn\u2019t do that unless she was home. There were already some fans outside the tinted glass windows who caught wind of her whereabouts and she had already interacted with them.</p><p><i>Still no Harry.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey Y/N. Sorry, I\u2019m late,</i>\u201d Harry huffed, his hair wildly curly for it to be the work of the spring breeze. There were marks on his neck and his pupils were blown wild. <i>Of course.</i></p><p>As much as she felt repulsed at his audacity to show up late looking he had just had the best fuck of his life, all Y/N really wanted to do was eat some dinner and cuddle with him\u2013after he had taken a shower. </p><p><b><i>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d</i></b> She muttered quietly, voice a little hoarse from how much she had to rehearse to get her lines accurate. <i><b>\u201c\u2018M tired.\u201d </b></i>Burying her head on his chest was a giant mistake because as soon as she was in proper distance from him, a sweet scent hit her nostrils and her earlier suspicion was confirmed. </p><p><i>\u201cAw bub, how about we go home, hmm?</i>\u201d He felt her head nodding against his shirt causing him to look down at her in admiration. She was such a hard-working woman who was determined to achieve greatness. <i>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d</i></p><p>Upon settling in Harry\u2019s car, Y/N lazily buckled in her safety belt and sat patiently while Harry rounded the front of the vehicle to get to the other side. He opened the door and got comfortable as well before starting the roar of the engine and shifted the gear to reverse, pulling out of his parking space. </p><p><i><b>\u201cSo I was thinking maybe we could cook dinner together,\u201d</b></i> She started. \u201c<i><b>We\u2019ll cook your favorite, then we can watch a movie in bed while cuddling like we used to</b></i>.\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes softened at the thought of being affectionate with Harry. <i><b>\u201cWhat do you say, H?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He hummed in response, not saying much else. Y/N assumed it was because of the heavy traffic that kept his attention on the road. She didn\u2019t mind though, just knowing that his presence with near her made her feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. They hadn\u2019t been together much, not even at nights where it should be reserved. He was always off staying at some lady\u2019s chateau and as much as she was glad that he was safe; she wished and preferred that he would\u2013one day\u2013pick their home as a safe haven.</p><p>Y/N must\u2019ve taken a bit of nap because she was woken up with a slight shake to her shoulder. Harry smiled at her gently, informing her that they were home. She adjusted her eyes to the bright space of their house, lights guiding the way to the cobblestone pathway to the front door. She grasped the handle of the car, pulling it towards her while using her other hand to push the entrapment in order to exit. Y/N was about to swing her legs over the seat when she realized that Harry was entitled to his phone which was buzzing repeatedly in his hand.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>H</b></i>?\u201d Y/N called out but to no avail. He was biting his lip, tearing the skin slightly. <i><b>\u201cHarry?</b></i>\u201d She questioned again but all she received was the soft purr of the engine.<i><b> \u201cHarry!\u201d</b></i></p><p>The rising volume of her voice snapped him out of his electronic trance, \u201c<i>Yeah</i>?\u201d</p><p>Y/N scoffed to herself, rolling her eyes minutely before asking:<b><i> \u201cWhat do you say about dinner?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cOh, uhm, I think it would be a great idea but\u2013,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cGreat! Then we can pick a movie and cuddle afterward, yeah?\u201d </i></b>She interrupted, feeling excitement vibrating through her bones. </p><p><i>\u201cActually, I\u2019m busy tonight,</i>\u201d He admitted sheepishly, dimple popping in a slight indent. <i>\u201cMaybe some other time?\u201d</i></p><p>His answer got Y/N speechless and her mouth was dropping open and closed in a matter of seconds.<i><b> \u201cWhere are you going? Is there something wrong?\u201d </b></i>The concern in her voice was enough to make him feel a bit guilty.</p><p><i>\u201cNo actually\u2013 I uh\u2013,\u201d</i> The buzz of his phone distracted his train of thought and his eyes widened when his thumbprint unlocked his cell. Harry whispered a breathy \u2018<i>fuck</i>\u2019, not meaning for Y/N to hear it. </p><p>Y/N shifted her hand to rest on the cushion of the car seat, reaching over to grab Harry\u2019s phone from his clutch. She could see his fingers trying to grasp on the air where his phone used to be, his eyes growing wide when he witnessed his girlfriend glance down at the white screen illuminating her face. </p><p>It showcased a conversation between him and a girl named Chloe. Y/N inspected the messages they had sent each other in the past minute and she almost gagged.</p><p>***</p><p><b>You think you can sneak away for a bit? Y/N gets to spend almost every day with you! Come on, I can cook you dinner and offer a show\u2026</b></p><p>She rolled her eyes at the atrocity of the message the woman sent, but it wasn\u2019t anything compared to Harry\u2019s reply. </p><p><i>Mm, you definitely know how to persuade someone into giving you what you want. I\u2019ll make something up. I expect you to be waiting for me in an hour or so. </i></p><p><i>The show would be even better if you wore the white panties you were wearing yesterday</i></p><p>It was a simple request that caused Y/N\u2019s heart to pound for attention to be soothed, yet she couldn\u2019t do anything else but let her thumb scroll down further. A part of her wanted to blow up, throw the phone on the ground and watch it shatter in pieces; much like how her heart felt after comprehending the filthy messages. Another, more sensible, part of her wanted to calmly return his pain-inducing device calmly and not give him the satisfaction of seeing her eyes well up with tears. </p><p><b>Of course, I bought them as per your request. I know white lingerie is your favorite.</b></p><p><i>It is when I take it off your body,</i></p><p><b>I need you Harry</b></p><p><i>Im coming. I expect you to be naked.</i></p><p>Her throat was dry and she still had a bit of trouble understanding the lengths he was willing to go through just to fuck some girl. He was planning on blatantly lying to her about his plans for the evening and showed no hesitation of leaving dear Y/N once again for the umpteenth time. </p><p><i><b>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll be spending tonight with just me,\u201d</b></i> Y/N chuckled bitterly, having half the mind on locking his phone to try to erase the messages somehow before handing it back to him. Harry stared at the phone as if it would burn his skin if it touched him; it felt like it to Y/N, too. </p><p>She proceeded with her previous actions, stepping off the vehicle and slamming the door shut before Harry could say anything. Y/N fumbled with the keys on the walk over to the front door, rushing to find the right one. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cY/N, wait!\u201d </i>Harry pulled on her arm, making her face him. <i>\u201cI-i, you weren\u2019t supposed to see that,\u201d</i> His tone was demeaning as if it was <i>her</i> fault that she was hurt.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Obviously I wasn\u2019t. What did I expect asking you for dinner and a movie?\u201d </b></i>She admitted, attitude going down in the dumps and a little sourer. <i><b>\u201cGuess I\u2019m always last on the list, huh?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He shook his head fast that it was dizzying,<i> \u201cNo you\u2019re not,</i>\u201d She lifted a hand to silence him from his unprepared excuses, \u201c<i><b>Save it. Just go.\u201d</b></i></p><p>And with that, Harry was left immobilized on the gravel while Y/N skipped towards the front door. She made eye contact with him before shutting the door against the frame. </p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Y/N was disheartened that her long and tiring day only sought to be more disappointing than she had expected.<i> How could she ever think Harry would be able to deliver with her request?</i> He was busy pleasing other woman and to even think of satisfying Y/N was swirling down the drain. </p><p>She huffed, annoyed at his ability to piss her off every twenty minutes. This was who they were behind closed doors. The speculations of their fans and the prying articles of news outlets could have never guessed that precious Y/N and Harry were not as innocent as they appeared to be. This had been their scenario for the past couple of months. This was them now; this is Harry \u2026</p><p>But this <i>isn\u2019t</i> Y/N and maybe it\u2019s time for a change.</p><p>As YN picked up the light case of her phone, she tapped unto her contact list and found the name she\u2019d been searching for. He had frequented in dropping hints about how he found her attractive, but of course, Y/N never felt objectified because his charm glazed him with an ability to soften the tough barricades of her heart. He was respectful to her <i>and</i> to Harry and kept his distance away from Y/N even though he was looking at her with lustful eyes during the Nolan premier. His self-control was amazing, Y/N gave him that. The way he focused on her with such an intense gaze made her squirm in her seat and partly wished that it was Harry who couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off her.</p><p>There had always been sexual tension present in the air between them, but neither parties acted upon it because of who they were. Not only would it cause a big scandal, but they were afraid that it would ruin their friendship with each other. Y/N cared too much and he would rather have her as a friend if he couldn\u2019t have her as a significant other.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s fingers tapped on the keyboard with fresh speed; a sentence that she had never thought should, or be able to type.</p><p><i><b>\u201cCome over and fuck me.\u201d</b></i></p><p>She waited until the text was titled \u2018<i>sent</i>\u2019, before taking a quick shower and slipping into some <i>white</i> lace lingerie that complimented the curves of her body. Y/N popped the cork of a wine bottle as well, setting it on the bedside table and grabbed to clear glasses in the kitchen. After some time, the doorbell rang and she had sprinted down the stairs, walking the last few meters to catch her breath and swung the door open.</p><p>Y/N scanned the man in front of her, dressed in a simple white tee and grey sweats that showed off his bulge that she had wondered about frequently. The shared a small smile with each other, a twinkle in their eyes.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey Shawn,\u201d</b></i> Y/N greeted before feeling a pair of lips pressed against her own. Her chest landing on his broad pane. Somewhere in the distance, the front door slammed shut and her body got pinned on the wood. He groaned lightly against her mouth when she traced a finger on his neck, grazing over the generic soft spot, feeling him shiver with delight and her lashes flutter on her cheeks.</p><p>She should\u2019ve done this sooner. </p><p>\u2014-</p><p>ok not gonna lie, I feel like I totally rushed this but my schedule is getting busier and busier and I didn\u2019t wanna leave you guys yearning for more so ta-da! :D</p><p><br></p><p>I think the 3rd part will contain some filth?? my FIRST smut fix and sksksksk </p><p><b>permanent taglist;\u00a0</b> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\">@ynm1505</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllO8kf7mHbYqWkUel7PGCQ\">@kissme-hs</a>   <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdJF3NJteLUvYL-8VwYgb4Q\">@agoddamnmango</a>   <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moDJn5hX6SkRScTXK72OY6A\">@harrys-kingdom</a>   <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_IeDacUKwJGZbqRtfMWzvQ\">@calums-sugarbaby</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYw6F23YjyqNBkPppNmZASQ\">@queenbeestuffs</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP9U8Ifzi0uGrwDvrygbINQ\">@ashkuuuu</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9pZWnOrrY9h5VJS1URecA\">@kettxo</a> @send-me-styles <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXoQhCPkZyNoq-dkMBzcGA\">@littledreamybeth</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx5Qf5iESVyZePbw9HHz9A\">@trustfulhaz</a> @harrysfeastedflower <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\">@harrystxleslx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk_fg5KH2srp5CoqMWt16iA\">@befourep</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m28p46mWBXKJFhf-csISF6Q\">@moonandstars-xo</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\">@babebenhardy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@swayingnoodlelove</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvJqvn1gEbScr1BTBfGYCw\">@mendesromano</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mELeQ4zjqQjlY7Fxyz3V4jQ\">@harrystylinsince1994</a> 4 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-cUeGpvGXwzOTwYC4IGohQ\">@juliassgem</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPlhoPKTgOFq8MXJNqtHlBA\">@miscll-fangirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meMMUmrzulyFF4z1Gr5JhyA\">@little-dragon-ate-my-heart</a> </p><p><b>jalboyh taglist;\u00a0</b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a>\u00a0@officiallyunofficalperson\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnfJgBWousYCdg-N8HVKFKg\">@gviosca</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maUEy5XG795w6hoVUqreFUQ\">@llandaaa</a> @mutuallynotmutual\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSwWtUn-ks_CNxtFgLmlK9w\">@mellamolayla</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhPHBijWPp3yEYQxB4U16Tg\">@madformichael</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9qoGsz943Swrb53iZblgJQ\">@toolazymyguy</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrnGlwLdLeF4IPiM_hq5LUw\">@sauveteen</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muOXh77x_A7MHx-DA-KYz_A\">@rebelflower19</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPTLc1wiL8ihmbcx3E_gbSQ\">@myfangirlworld</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnLWb3UwvV0gfgjl6P1SSYg\">@stella95827</a> @katelynmusic\u00a0@loganmay19\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkx2X828MT00novhWw8Snjw\">@calssunflower</a> </p><p>\u200b</p></p>",

She sighed, already used to it but the stabbing pain in her chest didn\u2019t come any softer. She had just woken up and her mood was ruined, but she knew she couldn\u2019t let this affect her for the whole day.</p><p>Y/N slipped her feet into the fuzzy slippers by her side of the bed, feet shuffling lazily on the hardwood flooring leading to the bathroom where she freshened up for the day. Grabbing her towel, she hung it on the rack before sliding the glass door of the standing shower to the side to let her hand in through the crack and turn the water knob on. The stream of water took her by surprise, jumping a few centimeters off the ground. Y/N waited until it was warm enough for her liking before stripping off of her pajamas, leaving it huddled on the marble floor. </p><p>The hot jets massaged her sore muscles and wiped off the excess makeup that the makeup remover and night wash couldn\u2019t get off. It was relieving, to say the least, and she slowly felt her body relax against the open air of the shower space. While cleaning her body with soap, she was taken by surprise when a gruff voice cut off her slightly off time singing and cold arms wrapping themselves around her body. </p><p><i>\u201cHey love,\u201d</i> Harry murmured against the name of her neck. </p><p>She turned around to face him, her breath meeting the expanse of his tanned chest. Y/N inspected his face; glowing and bright. Although she was happy that his skin was thriving, the reasoning behind as to why that was was something that Y/N wasn\u2019t ready to proclaim. </p><p><i><b>\u201cWhen did you get home?\u201d </b></i>Y/N littered small kisses on his jawline, feeling the rough stubble of his five o\u2019clock shadow. </p><p><i>\u201cCouple of minutes ago,\u201d</i> He answered, tilting his head up to catch the water on his mop of hair, getting the strands wet and damp. </p><p>Y/N caught sight of the dark hickeys dotted on his neck\u2013and chest\u2013to which she hadn\u2019t seen earlier because of his unexpected arrival. The lighting glimmered a new area of his skin where marks of infidelity decorated him. Some of them were bruised while others were a light shading of red\u2014but all of them proved that Harry did shag the woman in the red dress last night. Somehow, Y/N had convinced herself to always see the good in Harry and that meant creating scenarios where he rejects any women who weren\u2019t her in their advances. She was sadly disproven once again. </p><p>Harry looked down at her when he felt her fingers tracing the bruises, hissing slightly when she tapped a bit harsher than usual. In an odd way, Y/N felt a sense of smugness knowing that he was hurting. She saw it as a way of punishing him for being away from her for another night. Another lonely time laying in bed where she wondered what she could\u2019ve done better. </p><p><i>\u201cOuch!\u201d</i> He wheezed, wincing at the pain when she pressed on the purple one by his left pec. </p><p>Y/N ignored his complaint, advising him to turn around so she could clean his back off the sweat and brine that must\u2019ve built up in the span of twenty-four hours. What she saw made her gasp; completely horrified by the scarlet lacerated marks striping his back muscles. </p><p><i>\u201cIs it that bad?</i>\u201d His head glanced over his shoulder, trying to catch a glimpse of the traces that caused a dull pain on his back. He knew they were there ever since he woke up this morning with a sore torso. The cab driver he hitched a ride for stared at him from the mirror when Harry jolted his back upright as soon as it rubbed against the leather seat, laughing sarcastically at his pain. </p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p><i>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d </i>The driver uttered, eyes catching his green ones once in a while. <i>\u201cDoes your lady know about this?\u201d</i></p><p>Harry fumed as he was not ready for the mimicry <i>this</i> early in the morning, <i>\u201cPlease keep quiet. I\u2019m paying you for your service,\u201d</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Yes, it was pretty bad. If anything, it looked like a rabid cat scratched its claws deep into his soft skin and ripped the first surface, resulting in welts. Y/N thought that some of them were even bleeding. </p><p><i><b>\u201cVery bad,\u201d </b></i></p><p>Harry and YN dried themselves off a few minutes later. Harry carefully patting his body dry to not irritate the swollen skin. </p><p>Y/N instructed him to lay down on the bed so that she could rub some ointment on the welt marks. <i><b>\u201cI hate this,\u201d</b></i></p><p>Harry hummed in response, completely clueless as to what she was talking about.<i> \u201cWhat do you hate?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThe marks, the hickeys and the scratches, H\u201d </i></b>She spoke mindlessly, her fingertip acquiring a penny sized amount. </p><p><i>\u201cAre you saying you want to end this?\u201d</i> This, as in, the open relationship they\u2019d placed upon them self. Either one of them could stop it at any time but Y/N couldn\u2019t bring herself to hold her ground. They\u2019ve not been like a normal couple in ages and if they did stop this, it would be difficult to act all sweetly\u2014like they didn\u2019t just love on another body weeks previous. <i>\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d</i></p><p>She shook her head, <i><b>\u201cN-no I don\u2019t\u201d</b></i> and she hated herself for being so weak\u2013despite what the media made her out to be\u2013because she was hurting twofold but seeing Harry take full advantage of their agreement made her feel guilty for taking away something that he enjoyed in his life<i><b>. \u201cI just don\u2019t like how they leave marks on you,\u201d</b></i></p><p>Harry scoffed, <i>\u201cSorry, some of them like it rough,\u201d</i></p><p>She pinched his skin between her fingers causing him to groan in pain. </p><p><i><b>\u201cI don\u2019t even know who they are but they always find a way to make themselves known,\u201d</b></i> Y/N said sadly.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t stupid\u2014of course, he was seeing people behind her back (and right in front of her) but if she didn\u2019t know their name or saw how they looked like\u2014she could pretend that they weren\u2019t real and it made her feel a bit better; delusional, but better. But seeing his skin tainted with their wake left her astonished at how gradually pieces of Harry was being taken from her hold. His heart was still hers\u2014as far as she was concerned\u2014but his body was being metaphorically split between women that she didn\u2019t know. Y/N was sharing her love with people who mostly only slept with him for the sake of it\u2014because of who <i>he</i> was and not because they shared the intimate affections that her and Harry once gave to each other. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>It was a stupid idea; emphasis on stupid. Looking back in retrospect, there were better ways to handle what had happened between the two of them. Y/N came home one day tired from shooting scenes for her new movie. One click to her phone downed her mood even more because of the news that Harry had been papped with Kendall at a club. Now, of course, they\u2019ve had talks about who to and not trust but the pictures spoke for themselves. </p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</b></i>\u00a0She said sternly as soon as Harry entered the doorway of their bedroom. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you saw,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d</b></i> Y/N crossed her arms across her chest, standing up from her having her legs crossed.<i><b> \u201cCare to explain yourself?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cI didn\u2019t cheat on you,\u201d</i> He noted right away.</p><p>She nodded, a small breath of relief made its way out of her mouth, <b><i>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know,\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI almost did, though\u201d</i> Harry admitted, eyes searching hers for some sort of emotion that he could use to justify his actions. Just like that, the weight on her shoulders dropped heavily. </p><p><b><i>\u201cY-you what?\u201d </i></b></p><p>He sighed, closing the gap between them and taking her hands into his large palms<i>. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie to you, Y/N. I almost kissed Kendall today, plenty of times actually, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at him,<b><i> \u201cSo what? Should I be grateful that you didn\u2019t kiss her?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying,\u201d</i> He answered, voice deepening in a tenor note, <i>\u201cI thought about it long and hard on the way home,</i>\u201d She cocked an eyebrow at him to continue. <i>\u201cI think it\u2019s better if we break it off,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cBreak it off?</b></i>\u201d Y/N repeated, annunciating his words. No matter how infuriated she was at him, she didn\u2019t think she could handle breaking up with Harry. </p><p>He gulped, Adam\u2019s apple bobbing in his throat, <i>\u201cIf I was having thoughts about kissing another girl, then maybe \u2026 maybe it would be best if we broke up,\u201d </i>Harry explain his thoughts briefly, <i>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to cheat on you either,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cDo you like her?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Harry\u2019s curls bounced when he shook his head, <b><i>\u201cDo you still love me?</i></b>\u201d He nodded, <b><i>\u201cThen why are you leaving me?\u201d</i></b></p><p>His palm glossed over his angelic features, <i>\u201cI just wanted to try kissing her,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d </i></b>Y/N concluded. <i>What kind of sick joke was he playing at?</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know it\u2019s crazy but please try to understand. I\u2019m trying to figure this out too,\u201d </i></p><p>And from then, she briefly remembered her old self suggesting an open relationship. Her friend had talked about it once before, indicating that it was the best decision she\u2019d ever made in her life. Both partners were free to fuck and kiss any other person but their hearts were still loyal to each other. Y/N found it quite concerning as she believed that if two people really loved each other\u2014then they would give everything in exchange, even their bodies and not just their hearts. However, it also gave both parties freedom and liberation to explore something that their current partners might not be into\u2014it was something that greatly defined Y/N and causes her to shiver in disgust. Sure, she preferred as others would call \u2018<i>vanilla</i>\u2019 sex most of the time, but that was only because she would like to be cared for in her most vulnerable moments; she didn\u2019t know that it would be the cause of a massive downfall in her and Harry\u2019s relationship. </p><p>They were both busy and it was pretty accurate. Y/N didn\u2019t have <i>enough</i> time for Harry and Harry certainly didn\u2019t make her feel any special in the few months leading up to their decision of such a relationship. So it was no surprise that Harry jumped at the opportunity when she suggested it. His eyes twinkled in delight and his smile held a certain degree of mischief that would soon be expressed in rough fucking the next day. Needless to say, YN had to sit through the story of how Harry absolutely ruined Kendall (in terms of orgasms). She didn\u2019t ask, but he was too excited to thank her for her suggestion. The marks on his hips confirmed his words and truth to be told, she almost gagged while Y/N was riding him. </p><p>She felt absolutely used and dirty knowing that another woman had touched him the way she was doing it right now and he didn\u2019t even seem bothered! The bliss on his face kept her going, hoping that he would cease his actions right at the beginning and realize that he didn\u2019t need other women because Y/N was there for him\u2014in more ways than one. </p><p>Obviously, it didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>As soon as pictures of Shawn and Y/N were released on the Internet, there was no doubt that Harry\u2019s blood boiled upon seeing it. \u00a0His eyes widened at the phone screen and he gaped at Y/N getting dressed at one corner of the room while sat back the bed with his legs stretched out. <i>Of course</i>, they were going to be leaving with each other; Harry saw the looks they gave one another. <i>How dare she lecture him about the marks on his body when she herself was getting tainted?</i></p><p>He was agitated, to say the least\u2014nostrils flaring wild with thoughts building on top of one another and he couldn\u2019t help but say, <i>\u201cHow was Shawn last night?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N paused all her actions, slowly turning around with a confused face, <b><i>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cOh come on, Y/N,\u201d</i> Harry chuckled sarcastically. <i>\u201cHe fucked you last night, didn\u2019t he? Was he good?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cHarry, wha\u2013? He took me home because he saw that you left and\u2013,\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cNo need to lie. I saw the pictures,\u201d </i>Rolling his eyes, he fumbled with his phone to turn the brightness up, <i>\u201cI always tell you about my escapades, why don\u2019t you tell me any of yours?\u201d</i> He questioned, leaning over to show her the pictures dating from last night. </p><p><i>Because I don\u2019t have any \u2018escapades\u2019</i>, she thought. </p><p><b><i>\u201cIt\u2019s because I haven\u2019t slept with anyone,\u201d</i></b></p><p>Harry furrowed his brows, forehead scrunching,<i> \u201cIn a while?\u201d</i></p><p>She shook her head, stammering a bit from her unplanned confession, \u201c<b><i>N-no, in ever,\u201d </i></b>Her fingers twist the button of her jeans, tightening the fabric around her waist, the blouse she\u2019d picked for today matched the black denim; everything went well the dark jeans.<b><i> \u201cI haven\u2019t slept with anyone except you,\u201d</i></b></p><p>He gasped incredulously, \u201c<i>Really</i>?\u201d He then doubled over in cackling laughter, <i>\u201cThat\u2019s a funny joke, now tell me the truth. How many has it been? 3? 5?\u201d </i>He muttered while counting on his fingers,<i> \u201cI know mine is at least 23, plus last night would be 24,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N shifted her soles uncomfortably in her socks. She definitely didn\u2019t need to know how many women Harry had fooled around with, she didn\u2019t even <i>need</i> to see him recount every one of them in perfect memory as if they all did something memorable to him. </p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Harry was taken aback at her confession. He figured that Y/N must\u2019ve fooled around with somebody else <i>at least </i>once. Now he didn\u2019t know if she was lying about the number of her flings to make him feel guilty because he had taken full advantage of what this relationship had to offer. </p><p>Deep inside, he knew that <i>if</i> she did begin to talk about other men like he did with women\u2013he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the jealousy bubbling inside of him. It\u2019s not like he could control what he says any better either; it would be a big mess. All in all, he was glad that she avoided talking about men in front of him. </p><p>He can always claim to love her\u2013he does, by the way\u2013but at times he gets antsy in his pants because she could walk in the door at any time and break it off with him. Even though his body was not entirely hers, his heart was a piece of him that she will forever carry in her dainty hands. He had decided long ago that nobody took better care of him other than Y/N, and he was eternally grateful for her ability to withstand his mistakes and misfortunes. </p><p>Harry didn\u2019t like the idea of his girl hanging around with other guys and he was aware that Y/N wasn\u2019t too fond of him being around various women often. However, both of them were too coward to actually <i>say</i> something to each other. They knew each other very well, but not at this topic. This topic was blurry and foggy, and they had no sense of <i>what</i> to do to stop this. Both of them would probably project their feelings and ideas to one another, and it would only create an even bigger mess because their pride was too huge to push aside. </p><p>The fact the Y/N doesn\u2019t share about her experiences caused Harry to think of the worst, <i>that</i> being that her tendency to not make him a part of it meant that she must be doing it secretly\u2013 as if he was doing it behind his back, times two. If Y/N did go out with another guy, she was doing it very sneakily as the press hadn\u2019t caught her and her arm candy. She <i>must</i> be going out on dates when he was out of the house. Maybe she even brought them back in their home and fucked them on the marble kitchen counter. Not once had she called about canceling dinner plans or meetings so she <i>must</i> be doing it while Harry was off fucking the brains out of some random chick whom he\u2019d have to force to sign an NDA later on. </p><p>It worried him sometimes if the person she was with treated her right. Y/N wasn\u2019t the type of girl that you hump and dump; if the articles were right about something, it would be that she was the kindest, most humble woman in the business that you would probably feel physically sick if you made a frown etched on her face. He knew he had no right to swipe left on who she wanted to see, much like how he preferred for her to stay out of his decisions on who take home at night.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>It was the third day in a row where Harry forgot to pick up Y/N on set. He was on a break from writing and basically everything so it shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem to get a sense of time and pick up his girlfriend from her filming location. She was sitting at the black leather seats at the front lobby of the building, dressed in the outfit she left in earlier this morning. Her hair was done up in the \u201970s do to get the vibe of the part she was supposed to play. All Y/N wanted was to wash the hairspray off of her hair and wipe the makeup from her face, but she couldn\u2019t do that unless she was home. There were already some fans outside the tinted glass windows who caught wind of her whereabouts and she had already interacted with them.</p><p><i>Still no Harry.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey Y/N. Sorry, I\u2019m late,</i>\u201d Harry huffed, his hair wildly curly for it to be the work of the spring breeze. There were marks on his neck and his pupils were blown wild. <i>Of course.</i></p><p>As much as she felt repulsed at his audacity to show up late looking he had just had the best fuck of his life, all Y/N really wanted to do was eat some dinner and cuddle with him\u2013after he had taken a shower. </p><p><b><i>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d</i></b> She muttered quietly, voice a little hoarse from how much she had to rehearse to get her lines accurate. <i><b>\u201c\u2018M tired.\u201d </b></i>Burying her head on his chest was a giant mistake because as soon as she was in proper distance from him, a sweet scent hit her nostrils and her earlier suspicion was confirmed. </p><p><i>\u201cAw bub, how about we go home, hmm?</i>\u201d He felt her head nodding against his shirt causing him to look down at her in admiration. She was such a hard-working woman who was determined to achieve greatness. <i>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d</i></p><p>Upon settling in Harry\u2019s car, Y/N lazily buckled in her safety belt and sat patiently while Harry rounded the front of the vehicle to get to the other side. He opened the door and got comfortable as well before starting the roar of the engine and shifted the gear to reverse, pulling out of his parking space. </p><p><i><b>\u201cSo I was thinking maybe we could cook dinner together,\u201d</b></i> She started. \u201c<i><b>We\u2019ll cook your favorite, then we can watch a movie in bed while cuddling like we used to</b></i>.\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes softened at the thought of being affectionate with Harry. <i><b>\u201cWhat do you say, H?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He hummed in response, not saying much else. Y/N assumed it was because of the heavy traffic that kept his attention on the road. She didn\u2019t mind though, just knowing that his presence with near her made her feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. They hadn\u2019t been together much, not even at nights where it should be reserved. He was always off staying at some lady\u2019s chateau and as much as she was glad that he was safe; she wished and preferred that he would\u2013one day\u2013pick their home as a safe haven.</p><p>Y/N must\u2019ve taken a bit of nap because she was woken up with a slight shake to her shoulder. Harry smiled at her gently, informing her that they were home. She adjusted her eyes to the bright space of their house, lights guiding the way to the cobblestone pathway to the front door. She grasped the handle of the car, pulling it towards her while using her other hand to push the entrapment in order to exit. Y/N was about to swing her legs over the seat when she realized that Harry was entitled to his phone which was buzzing repeatedly in his hand.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>H</b></i>?\u201d Y/N called out but to no avail. He was biting his lip, tearing the skin slightly. <i><b>\u201cHarry?</b></i>\u201d She questioned again but all she received was the soft purr of the engine.<i><b> \u201cHarry!\u201d</b></i></p><p>The rising volume of her voice snapped him out of his electronic trance, \u201c<i>Yeah</i>?\u201d</p><p>Y/N scoffed to herself, rolling her eyes minutely before asking:<b><i> \u201cWhat do you say about dinner?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cOh, uhm, I think it would be a great idea but\u2013,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cGreat! Then we can pick a movie and cuddle afterward, yeah?\u201d </i></b>She interrupted, feeling excitement vibrating through her bones. </p><p><i>\u201cActually, I\u2019m busy tonight,</i>\u201d He admitted sheepishly, dimple popping in a slight indent. <i>\u201cMaybe some other time?\u201d</i></p><p>His answer got Y/N speechless and her mouth was dropping open and closed in a matter of seconds.<i><b> \u201cWhere are you going? Is there something wrong?\u201d </b></i>The concern in her voice was enough to make him feel a bit guilty.</p><p><i>\u201cNo actually\u2013 I uh\u2013,\u201d</i> The buzz of his phone distracted his train of thought and his eyes widened when his thumbprint unlocked his cell. Harry whispered a breathy \u2018<i>fuck</i>\u2019, not meaning for Y/N to hear it. </p><p>Y/N shifted her hand to rest on the cushion of the car seat, reaching over to grab Harry\u2019s phone from his clutch. She could see his fingers trying to grasp on the air where his phone used to be, his eyes growing wide when he witnessed his girlfriend glance down at the white screen illuminating her face. </p><p>It showcased a conversation between him and a girl named Chloe. Y/N inspected the messages they had sent each other in the past minute and she almost gagged.</p><p>***</p><p><b>You think you can sneak away for a bit? Y/N gets to spend almost every day with you! Come on, I can cook you dinner and offer a show\u2026</b></p><p>She rolled her eyes at the atrocity of the message the woman sent, but it wasn\u2019t anything compared to Harry\u2019s reply. </p><p><i>Mm, you definitely know how to persuade someone into giving you what you want. I\u2019ll make something up. I expect you to be waiting for me in an hour or so. </i></p><p><i>The show would be even better if you wore the white panties you were wearing yesterday</i></p><p>It was a simple request that caused Y/N\u2019s heart to pound for attention to be soothed, yet she couldn\u2019t do anything else but let her thumb scroll down further. A part of her wanted to blow up, throw the phone on the ground and watch it shatter in pieces; much like how her heart felt after comprehending the filthy messages. Another, more sensible, part of her wanted to calmly return his pain-inducing device calmly and not give him the satisfaction of seeing her eyes well up with tears. </p><p><b>Of course, I bought them as per your request. I know white lingerie is your favorite.</b></p><p><i>It is when I take it off your body,</i></p><p><b>I need you Harry</b></p><p><i>Im coming. I expect you to be naked.</i></p><p>Her throat was dry and she still had a bit of trouble understanding the lengths he was willing to go through just to fuck some girl. He was planning on blatantly lying to her about his plans for the evening and showed no hesitation of leaving dear Y/N once again for the umpteenth time. </p><p><i><b>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll be spending tonight with just me,\u201d</b></i> Y/N chuckled bitterly, having half the mind on locking his phone to try to erase the messages somehow before handing it back to him. Harry stared at the phone as if it would burn his skin if it touched him; it felt like it to Y/N, too. </p><p>She proceeded with her previous actions, stepping off the vehicle and slamming the door shut before Harry could say anything. Y/N fumbled with the keys on the walk over to the front door, rushing to find the right one. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cY/N, wait!\u201d </i>Harry pulled on her arm, making her face him. <i>\u201cI-i, you weren\u2019t supposed to see that,\u201d</i> His tone was demeaning as if it was <i>her</i> fault that she was hurt.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Obviously I wasn\u2019t. What did I expect asking you for dinner and a movie?\u201d </b></i>She admitted, attitude going down in the dumps and a little sourer. <i><b>\u201cGuess I\u2019m always last on the list, huh?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He shook his head fast that it was dizzying,<i> \u201cNo you\u2019re not,</i>\u201d She lifted a hand to silence him from his unprepared excuses, \u201c<i><b>Save it. Just go.\u201d</b></i></p><p>And with that, Harry was left immobilized on the gravel while Y/N skipped towards the front door. She made eye contact with him before shutting the door against the frame. </p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Y/N was disheartened that her long and tiring day only sought to be more disappointing than she had expected.<i> How could she ever think Harry would be able to deliver with her request?</i> He was busy pleasing other woman and to even think of satisfying Y/N was swirling down the drain. </p><p>She huffed, annoyed at his ability to piss her off every twenty minutes. This was who they were behind closed doors. The speculations of their fans and the prying articles of news outlets could have never guessed that precious Y/N and Harry were not as innocent as they appeared to be. This had been their scenario for the past couple of months. This was them now; this is Harry \u2026</p><p>But this <i>isn\u2019t</i> Y/N and maybe it\u2019s time for a change.</p><p>As YN picked up the light case of her phone, she tapped unto her contact list and found the name she\u2019d been searching for. He had frequented in dropping hints about how he found her attractive, but of course, Y/N never felt objectified because his charm glazed him with an ability to soften the tough barricades of her heart. He was respectful to her <i>and</i> to Harry and kept his distance away from Y/N even though he was looking at her with lustful eyes during the Nolan premier. His self-control was amazing, Y/N gave him that. The way he focused on her with such an intense gaze made her squirm in her seat and partly wished that it was Harry who couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off her.</p><p>There had always been sexual tension present in the air between them, but neither parties acted upon it because of who they were. Not only would it cause a big scandal, but they were afraid that it would ruin their friendship with each other. Y/N cared too much and he would rather have her as a friend if he couldn\u2019t have her as a significant other.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s fingers tapped on the keyboard with fresh speed; a sentence that she had never thought should, or be able to type.</p><p><i><b>\u201cCome over and fuck me.\u201d</b></i></p><p>She waited until the text was titled \u2018<i>sent</i>\u2019, before taking a quick shower and slipping into some <i>white</i> lace lingerie that complimented the curves of her body. Y/N popped the cork of a wine bottle as well, setting it on the bedside table and grabbed to clear glasses in the kitchen. After some time, the doorbell rang and she had sprinted down the stairs, walking the last few meters to catch her breath and swung the door open.</p><p>Y/N scanned the man in front of her, dressed in a simple white tee and grey sweats that showed off his bulge that she had wondered about frequently. The shared a small smile with each other, a twinkle in their eyes.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey Shawn,\u201d</b></i> Y/N greeted before feeling a pair of lips pressed against her own. Her chest landing on his broad pane. Somewhere in the distance, the front door slammed shut and her body got pinned on the wood. He groaned lightly against her mouth when she traced a finger on his neck, grazing over the generic soft spot, feeling him shiver with delight and her lashes flutter on her cheeks.</p><p>She should\u2019ve done this sooner. </p><p>\u2014-</p><p>ok not gonna lie, I feel like I totally rushed this but my schedule is getting busier and busier and I didn\u2019t wanna leave you guys yearning for more so ta-da! :D</p><p><br></p><p>I think the 3rd part will contain some filth?? my FIRST smut fix and sksksksk </p><p><b>permanent taglist;\u00a0</b> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\">@ynm1505</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllO8kf7mHbYqWkUel7PGCQ\">@kissme-hs</a>   <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdJF3NJteLUvYL-8VwYgb4Q\">@agoddamnmango</a>   <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moDJn5hX6SkRScTXK72OY6A\">@harrys-kingdom</a>   <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_IeDacUKwJGZbqRtfMWzvQ\">@calums-sugarbaby</a>  <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYw6F23YjyqNBkPppNmZASQ\">@queenbeestuffs</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP9U8Ifzi0uGrwDvrygbINQ\">@ashkuuuu</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9pZWnOrrY9h5VJS1URecA\">@kettxo</a> @send-me-styles <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXoQhCPkZyNoq-dkMBzcGA\">@littledreamybeth</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx5Qf5iESVyZePbw9HHz9A\">@trustfulhaz</a> @harrysfeastedflower <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\">@harrystxleslx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk_fg5KH2srp5CoqMWt16iA\">@befourep</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m28p46mWBXKJFhf-csISF6Q\">@moonandstars-xo</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\">@babebenhardy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@swayingnoodlelove</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvJqvn1gEbScr1BTBfGYCw\">@mendesromano</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mELeQ4zjqQjlY7Fxyz3V4jQ\">@harrystylinsince1994</a> 4 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-cUeGpvGXwzOTwYC4IGohQ\">@juliassgem</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPlhoPKTgOFq8MXJNqtHlBA\">@miscll-fangirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meMMUmrzulyFF4z1Gr5JhyA\">@little-dragon-ate-my-heart</a> </p><p><b>jalboyh taglist;\u00a0</b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a>\u00a0@officiallyunofficalperson\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnfJgBWousYCdg-N8HVKFKg\">@gviosca</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maUEy5XG795w6hoVUqreFUQ\">@llandaaa</a> @mutuallynotmutual\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSwWtUn-ks_CNxtFgLmlK9w\">@mellamolayla</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhPHBijWPp3yEYQxB4U16Tg\">@madformichael</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9qoGsz943Swrb53iZblgJQ\">@toolazymyguy</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrnGlwLdLeF4IPiM_hq5LUw\">@sauveteen</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muOXh77x_A7MHx-DA-KYz_A\">@rebelflower19</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPTLc1wiL8ihmbcx3E_gbSQ\">@myfangirlworld</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnLWb3UwvV0gfgjl6P1SSYg\">@stella95827</a> @katelynmusic\u00a0@loganmay19\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkx2X828MT00novhWw8Snjw\">@calssunflower</a> </p><p>\u200b</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Just A Little Bit of Your Heart (2)</h1><p><b><i>Summary: Harry and Y/N are in an open relationship</i></b></p><p><b><i>Warnings: angst and a teensy bit of smut?</i></b></p><p><b><i>Word Count: 4870 words</i></b></p><h2><b><i>A/N: unedited cause it&rsquo;s late at night but I wanna post it now so I could read your guys&rsquo; comments tomorrow morning :)</i></b></h2><p>Y/N woke up with no indents of Harry&rsquo;s body creased on the navy blue sheets of their bed, indicating that he didn&rsquo;t come home last night and probably spent the rest of the evening at some lesser known hotel to avoid the attention. She sighed, already used to it but the stabbing pain in her chest didn&rsquo;t come any softer. She had just woken up and her mood was ruined, but she knew she couldn&rsquo;t let this affect her for the whole day.</p><p>Y/N slipped her feet into the fuzzy slippers by her side of the bed, feet shuffling lazily on the hardwood flooring leading to the bathroom where she freshened up for the day. Grabbing her towel, she hung it on the rack before sliding the glass door of the standing shower to the side to let her hand in through the crack and turn the water knob on. The stream of water took her by surprise, jumping a few centimeters off the ground. Y/N waited until it was warm enough for her liking before stripping off of her pajamas, leaving it huddled on the marble floor. </p><p>The hot jets massaged her sore muscles and wiped off the excess makeup that the makeup remover and night wash couldn&rsquo;t get off. It was relieving, to say the least, and she slowly felt her body relax against the open air of the shower space. While cleaning her body with soap, she was taken by surprise when a gruff voice cut off her slightly off time singing and cold arms wrapping themselves around her body. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey love,&rdquo;</i> Harry murmured against the name of her neck. </p><p>She turned around to face him, her breath meeting the expanse of his tanned chest. Y/N inspected his face; glowing and bright. Although she was happy that his skin was thriving, the reasoning behind as to why that was was something that Y/N wasn&rsquo;t ready to proclaim. </p><p><i><b>&ldquo;When did you get home?&rdquo; </b></i>Y/N littered small kisses on his jawline, feeling the rough stubble of his five o&rsquo;clock shadow. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Couple of minutes ago,&rdquo;</i> He answered, tilting his head up to catch the water on his mop of hair, getting the strands wet and damp. </p><p>Y/N caught sight of the dark hickeys dotted on his neck&ndash;and chest&ndash;to which she hadn&rsquo;t seen earlier because of his unexpected arrival. The lighting glimmered a new area of his skin where marks of infidelity decorated him. Some of them were bruised while others were a light shading of red&mdash;but all of them proved that Harry did shag the woman in the red dress last night. Somehow, Y/N had convinced herself to always see the good in Harry and that meant creating scenarios where he rejects any women who weren&rsquo;t her in their advances. She was sadly disproven once again. </p><p>Harry looked down at her when he felt her fingers tracing the bruises, hissing slightly when she tapped a bit harsher than usual. In an odd way, Y/N felt a sense of smugness knowing that he was hurting. She saw it as a way of punishing him for being away from her for another night. Another lonely time laying in bed where she wondered what she could&rsquo;ve done better. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo;</i> He wheezed, wincing at the pain when she pressed on the purple one by his left pec. </p><p>Y/N ignored his complaint, advising him to turn around so she could clean his back off the sweat and brine that must&rsquo;ve built up in the span of twenty-four hours. What she saw made her gasp; completely horrified by the scarlet lacerated marks striping his back muscles. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Is it that bad?</i>&rdquo; His head glanced over his shoulder, trying to catch a glimpse of the traces that caused a dull pain on his back. He knew they were there ever since he woke up this morning with a sore torso. The cab driver he hitched a ride for stared at him from the mirror when Harry jolted his back upright as soon as it rubbed against the leather seat, laughing sarcastically at his pain. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I know who you are,&rdquo; </i>The driver uttered, eyes catching his green ones once in a while. <i>&ldquo;Does your lady know about this?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry fumed as he was not ready for the mimicry <i>this</i> early in the morning, <i>&ldquo;Please keep quiet. I&rsquo;m paying you for your service,&rdquo;</i></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Yes, it was pretty bad. If anything, it looked like a rabid cat scratched its claws deep into his soft skin and ripped the first surface, resulting in welts. Y/N thought that some of them were even bleeding. </p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Very bad,&rdquo; </b></i></p><p>Harry and YN dried themselves off a few minutes later. Harry carefully patting his body dry to not irritate the swollen skin. </p><p>Y/N instructed him to lay down on the bed so that she could rub some ointment on the welt marks. <i><b>&ldquo;I hate this,&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Harry hummed in response, completely clueless as to what she was talking about.<i> &ldquo;What do you hate?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;The marks, the hickeys and the scratches, H&rdquo; </i></b>She spoke mindlessly, her fingertip acquiring a penny sized amount. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you saying you want to end this?&rdquo;</i> This, as in, the open relationship they&rsquo;d placed upon them self. Either one of them could stop it at any time but Y/N couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to hold her ground. They&rsquo;ve not been like a normal couple in ages and if they did stop this, it would be difficult to act all sweetly&mdash;like they didn&rsquo;t just love on another body weeks previous. <i>&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;</i></p><p>She shook her head, <i><b>&ldquo;N-no I don&rsquo;t&rdquo;</b></i> and she hated herself for being so weak&ndash;despite what the media made her out to be&ndash;because she was hurting twofold but seeing Harry take full advantage of their agreement made her feel guilty for taking away something that he enjoyed in his life<i><b>. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t like how they leave marks on you,&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Harry scoffed, <i>&ldquo;Sorry, some of them like it rough,&rdquo;</i></p><p>She pinched his skin between her fingers causing him to groan in pain. </p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know who they are but they always find a way to make themselves known,&rdquo;</b></i> Y/N said sadly.</p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t stupid&mdash;of course, he was seeing people behind her back (and right in front of her) but if she didn&rsquo;t know their name or saw how they looked like&mdash;she could pretend that they weren&rsquo;t real and it made her feel a bit better; delusional, but better. But seeing his skin tainted with their wake left her astonished at how gradually pieces of Harry was being taken from her hold. His heart was still hers&mdash;as far as she was concerned&mdash;but his body was being metaphorically split between women that she didn&rsquo;t know. Y/N was sharing her love with people who mostly only slept with him for the sake of it&mdash;because of who <i>he</i> was and not because they shared the intimate affections that her and Harry once gave to each other. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>It was a stupid idea; emphasis on stupid. Looking back in retrospect, there were better ways to handle what had happened between the two of them. Y/N came home one day tired from shooting scenes for her new movie. One click to her phone downed her mood even more because of the news that Harry had been papped with Kendall at a club. Now, of course, they&rsquo;ve had talks about who to and not trust but the pictures spoke for themselves. </p><p><i><b>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</b></i>&nbsp;She said sternly as soon as Harry entered the doorway of their bedroom. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing you saw,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo;</b></i> Y/N crossed her arms across her chest, standing up from her having her legs crossed.<i><b> &ldquo;Care to explain yourself?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t cheat on you,&rdquo;</i> He noted right away.</p><p>She nodded, a small breath of relief made its way out of her mouth, <b><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to know,&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;I almost did, though&rdquo;</i> Harry admitted, eyes searching hers for some sort of emotion that he could use to justify his actions. Just like that, the weight on her shoulders dropped heavily. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Y-you what?&rdquo; </i></b></p><p>He sighed, closing the gap between them and taking her hands into his large palms<i>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna lie to you, Y/N. I almost kissed Kendall today, plenty of times actually, but I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at him,<b><i> &ldquo;So what? Should I be grateful that you didn&rsquo;t kiss her?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying,&rdquo;</i> He answered, voice deepening in a tenor note, <i>&ldquo;I thought about it long and hard on the way home,</i>&rdquo; She cocked an eyebrow at him to continue. <i>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s better if we break it off,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Break it off?</b></i>&rdquo; Y/N repeated, annunciating his words. No matter how infuriated she was at him, she didn&rsquo;t think she could handle breaking up with Harry. </p><p>He gulped, Adam&rsquo;s apple bobbing in his throat, <i>&ldquo;If I was having thoughts about kissing another girl, then maybe &hellip; maybe it would be best if we broke up,&rdquo; </i>Harry explain his thoughts briefly, <i>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to cheat on you either,&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Do you like her?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Harry&rsquo;s curls bounced when he shook his head, <b><i>&ldquo;Do you still love me?</i></b>&rdquo; He nodded, <b><i>&ldquo;Then why are you leaving me?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>His palm glossed over his angelic features, <i>&ldquo;I just wanted to try kissing her,&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s absolutely ridiculous,&rdquo; </i></b>Y/N concluded. <i>What kind of sick joke was he playing at?</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s crazy but please try to understand. I&rsquo;m trying to figure this out too,&rdquo; </i></p><p>And from then, she briefly remembered her old self suggesting an open relationship. Her friend had talked about it once before, indicating that it was the best decision she&rsquo;d ever made in her life. Both partners were free to fuck and kiss any other person but their hearts were still loyal to each other. Y/N found it quite concerning as she believed that if two people really loved each other&mdash;then they would give everything in exchange, even their bodies and not just their hearts. However, it also gave both parties freedom and liberation to explore something that their current partners might not be into&mdash;it was something that greatly defined Y/N and causes her to shiver in disgust. Sure, she preferred as others would call &lsquo;<i>vanilla</i>&rsquo; sex most of the time, but that was only because she would like to be cared for in her most vulnerable moments; she didn&rsquo;t know that it would be the cause of a massive downfall in her and Harry&rsquo;s relationship. </p><p>They were both busy and it was pretty accurate. Y/N didn&rsquo;t have <i>enough</i> time for Harry and Harry certainly didn&rsquo;t make her feel any special in the few months leading up to their decision of such a relationship. So it was no surprise that Harry jumped at the opportunity when she suggested it. His eyes twinkled in delight and his smile held a certain degree of mischief that would soon be expressed in rough fucking the next day. Needless to say, YN had to sit through the story of how Harry absolutely ruined Kendall (in terms of orgasms). She didn&rsquo;t ask, but he was too excited to thank her for her suggestion. The marks on his hips confirmed his words and truth to be told, she almost gagged while Y/N was riding him. </p><p>She felt absolutely used and dirty knowing that another woman had touched him the way she was doing it right now and he didn&rsquo;t even seem bothered! The bliss on his face kept her going, hoping that he would cease his actions right at the beginning and realize that he didn&rsquo;t need other women because Y/N was there for him&mdash;in more ways than one. </p><p>Obviously, it didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>As soon as pictures of Shawn and Y/N were released on the Internet, there was no doubt that Harry&rsquo;s blood boiled upon seeing it. &nbsp;His eyes widened at the phone screen and he gaped at Y/N getting dressed at one corner of the room while sat back the bed with his legs stretched out. <i>Of course</i>, they were going to be leaving with each other; Harry saw the looks they gave one another. <i>How dare she lecture him about the marks on his body when she herself was getting tainted?</i></p><p>He was agitated, to say the least&mdash;nostrils flaring wild with thoughts building on top of one another and he couldn&rsquo;t help but say, <i>&ldquo;How was Shawn last night?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N paused all her actions, slowly turning around with a confused face, <b><i>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh come on, Y/N,&rdquo;</i> Harry chuckled sarcastically. <i>&ldquo;He fucked you last night, didn&rsquo;t he? Was he good?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Harry, wha&ndash;? He took me home because he saw that you left and&ndash;,&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;No need to lie. I saw the pictures,&rdquo; </i>Rolling his eyes, he fumbled with his phone to turn the brightness up, <i>&ldquo;I always tell you about my escapades, why don&rsquo;t you tell me any of yours?&rdquo;</i> He questioned, leaning over to show her the pictures dating from last night. </p><p><i>Because I don&rsquo;t have any &lsquo;escapades&rsquo;</i>, she thought. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I haven&rsquo;t slept with anyone,&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Harry furrowed his brows, forehead scrunching,<i> &ldquo;In a while?&rdquo;</i></p><p>She shook her head, stammering a bit from her unplanned confession, &ldquo;<b><i>N-no, in ever,&rdquo; </i></b>Her fingers twist the button of her jeans, tightening the fabric around her waist, the blouse she&rsquo;d picked for today matched the black denim; everything went well the dark jeans.<b><i> &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t slept with anyone except you,&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>He gasped incredulously, &ldquo;<i>Really</i>?&rdquo; He then doubled over in cackling laughter, <i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a funny joke, now tell me the truth. How many has it been? 3? 5?&rdquo; </i>He muttered while counting on his fingers,<i> &ldquo;I know mine is at least 23, plus last night would be 24,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N shifted her soles uncomfortably in her socks. She definitely didn&rsquo;t need to know how many women Harry had fooled around with, she didn&rsquo;t even <i>need</i> to see him recount every one of them in perfect memory as if they all did something memorable to him. </p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>Harry was taken aback at her confession. He figured that Y/N must&rsquo;ve fooled around with somebody else <i>at least </i>once. Now he didn&rsquo;t know if she was lying about the number of her flings to make him feel guilty because he had taken full advantage of what this relationship had to offer. </p><p>Deep inside, he knew that <i>if</i> she did begin to talk about other men like he did with women&ndash;he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle the jealousy bubbling inside of him. It&rsquo;s not like he could control what he says any better either; it would be a big mess. All in all, he was glad that she avoided talking about men in front of him. </p><p>He can always claim to love her&ndash;he does, by the way&ndash;but at times he gets antsy in his pants because she could walk in the door at any time and break it off with him. Even though his body was not entirely hers, his heart was a piece of him that she will forever carry in her dainty hands. He had decided long ago that nobody took better care of him other than Y/N, and he was eternally grateful for her ability to withstand his mistakes and misfortunes. </p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t like the idea of his girl hanging around with other guys and he was aware that Y/N wasn&rsquo;t too fond of him being around various women often. However, both of them were too coward to actually <i>say</i> something to each other. They knew each other very well, but not at this topic. This topic was blurry and foggy, and they had no sense of <i>what</i> to do to stop this. Both of them would probably project their feelings and ideas to one another, and it would only create an even bigger mess because their pride was too huge to push aside. </p><p>The fact the Y/N doesn&rsquo;t share about her experiences caused Harry to think of the worst, <i>that</i> being that her tendency to not make him a part of it meant that she must be doing it secretly&ndash; as if he was doing it behind his back, times two. If Y/N did go out with another guy, she was doing it very sneakily as the press hadn&rsquo;t caught her and her arm candy. She <i>must</i> be going out on dates when he was out of the house. Maybe she even brought them back in their home and fucked them on the marble kitchen counter. Not once had she called about canceling dinner plans or meetings so she <i>must</i> be doing it while Harry was off fucking the brains out of some random chick whom he&rsquo;d have to force to sign an NDA later on. </p><p>It worried him sometimes if the person she was with treated her right. Y/N wasn&rsquo;t the type of girl that you hump and dump; if the articles were right about something, it would be that she was the kindest, most humble woman in the business that you would probably feel physically sick if you made a frown etched on her face. He knew he had no right to swipe left on who she wanted to see, much like how he preferred for her to stay out of his decisions on who take home at night.</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>It was the third day in a row where Harry forgot to pick up Y/N on set. He was on a break from writing and basically everything so it shouldn&rsquo;t be too much of a problem to get a sense of time and pick up his girlfriend from her filming location. She was sitting at the black leather seats at the front lobby of the building, dressed in the outfit she left in earlier this morning. Her hair was done up in the &rsquo;70s do to get the vibe of the part she was supposed to play. All Y/N wanted was to wash the hairspray off of her hair and wipe the makeup from her face, but she couldn&rsquo;t do that unless she was home. There were already some fans outside the tinted glass windows who caught wind of her whereabouts and she had already interacted with them.</p><p><i>Still no Harry.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey Y/N. Sorry, I&rsquo;m late,</i>&rdquo; Harry huffed, his hair wildly curly for it to be the work of the spring breeze. There were marks on his neck and his pupils were blown wild. <i>Of course.</i></p><p>As much as she felt repulsed at his audacity to show up late looking he had just had the best fuck of his life, all Y/N really wanted to do was eat some dinner and cuddle with him&ndash;after he had taken a shower. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo;</i></b> She muttered quietly, voice a little hoarse from how much she had to rehearse to get her lines accurate. <i><b>&ldquo;&lsquo;M tired.&rdquo; </b></i>Burying her head on his chest was a giant mistake because as soon as she was in proper distance from him, a sweet scent hit her nostrils and her earlier suspicion was confirmed. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Aw bub, how about we go home, hmm?</i>&rdquo; He felt her head nodding against his shirt causing him to look down at her in admiration. She was such a hard-working woman who was determined to achieve greatness. <i>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Upon settling in Harry&rsquo;s car, Y/N lazily buckled in her safety belt and sat patiently while Harry rounded the front of the vehicle to get to the other side. He opened the door and got comfortable as well before starting the roar of the engine and shifted the gear to reverse, pulling out of his parking space. </p><p><i><b>&ldquo;So I was thinking maybe we could cook dinner together,&rdquo;</b></i> She started. &ldquo;<i><b>We&rsquo;ll cook your favorite, then we can watch a movie in bed while cuddling like we used to</b></i>.&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s eyes softened at the thought of being affectionate with Harry. <i><b>&ldquo;What do you say, H?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>He hummed in response, not saying much else. Y/N assumed it was because of the heavy traffic that kept his attention on the road. She didn&rsquo;t mind though, just knowing that his presence with near her made her feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. They hadn&rsquo;t been together much, not even at nights where it should be reserved. He was always off staying at some lady&rsquo;s chateau and as much as she was glad that he was safe; she wished and preferred that he would&ndash;one day&ndash;pick their home as a safe haven.</p><p>Y/N must&rsquo;ve taken a bit of nap because she was woken up with a slight shake to her shoulder. Harry smiled at her gently, informing her that they were home. She adjusted her eyes to the bright space of their house, lights guiding the way to the cobblestone pathway to the front door. She grasped the handle of the car, pulling it towards her while using her other hand to push the entrapment in order to exit. Y/N was about to swing her legs over the seat when she realized that Harry was entitled to his phone which was buzzing repeatedly in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>H</b></i>?&rdquo; Y/N called out but to no avail. He was biting his lip, tearing the skin slightly. <i><b>&ldquo;Harry?</b></i>&rdquo; She questioned again but all she received was the soft purr of the engine.<i><b> &ldquo;Harry!&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>The rising volume of her voice snapped him out of his electronic trance, &ldquo;<i>Yeah</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N scoffed to herself, rolling her eyes minutely before asking:<b><i> &ldquo;What do you say about dinner?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, uhm, I think it would be a great idea but&ndash;,&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Great! Then we can pick a movie and cuddle afterward, yeah?&rdquo; </i></b>She interrupted, feeling excitement vibrating through her bones. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;m busy tonight,</i>&rdquo; He admitted sheepishly, dimple popping in a slight indent. <i>&ldquo;Maybe some other time?&rdquo;</i></p><p>His answer got Y/N speechless and her mouth was dropping open and closed in a matter of seconds.<i><b> &ldquo;Where are you going? Is there something wrong?&rdquo; </b></i>The concern in her voice was enough to make him feel a bit guilty.</p><p><i>&ldquo;No actually&ndash; I uh&ndash;,&rdquo;</i> The buzz of his phone distracted his train of thought and his eyes widened when his thumbprint unlocked his cell. Harry whispered a breathy &lsquo;<i>fuck</i>&rsquo;, not meaning for Y/N to hear it. </p><p>Y/N shifted her hand to rest on the cushion of the car seat, reaching over to grab Harry&rsquo;s phone from his clutch. She could see his fingers trying to grasp on the air where his phone used to be, his eyes growing wide when he witnessed his girlfriend glance down at the white screen illuminating her face. </p><p>It showcased a conversation between him and a girl named Chloe. Y/N inspected the messages they had sent each other in the past minute and she almost gagged.</p><p>***</p><p><b>You think you can sneak away for a bit? Y/N gets to spend almost every day with you! Come on, I can cook you dinner and offer a show&hellip;</b></p><p>She rolled her eyes at the atrocity of the message the woman sent, but it wasn&rsquo;t anything compared to Harry&rsquo;s reply. </p><p><i>Mm, you definitely know how to persuade someone into giving you what you want. I&rsquo;ll make something up. I expect you to be waiting for me in an hour or so. </i></p><p><i>The show would be even better if you wore the white panties you were wearing yesterday</i></p><p>It was a simple request that caused Y/N&rsquo;s heart to pound for attention to be soothed, yet she couldn&rsquo;t do anything else but let her thumb scroll down further. A part of her wanted to blow up, throw the phone on the ground and watch it shatter in pieces; much like how her heart felt after comprehending the filthy messages. Another, more sensible, part of her wanted to calmly return his pain-inducing device calmly and not give him the satisfaction of seeing her eyes well up with tears. </p><p><b>Of course, I bought them as per your request. I know white lingerie is your favorite.</b></p><p><i>It is when I take it off your body,</i></p><p><b>I need you Harry</b></p><p><i>Im coming. I expect you to be naked.</i></p><p>Her throat was dry and she still had a bit of trouble understanding the lengths he was willing to go through just to fuck some girl. He was planning on blatantly lying to her about his plans for the evening and showed no hesitation of leaving dear Y/N once again for the umpteenth time. </p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll be spending tonight with just me,&rdquo;</b></i> Y/N chuckled bitterly, having half the mind on locking his phone to try to erase the messages somehow before handing it back to him. Harry stared at the phone as if it would burn his skin if it touched him; it felt like it to Y/N, too. </p><p>She proceeded with her previous actions, stepping off the vehicle and slamming the door shut before Harry could say anything. Y/N fumbled with the keys on the walk over to the front door, rushing to find the right one. &nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N, wait!&rdquo; </i>Harry pulled on her arm, making her face him. <i>&ldquo;I-i, you weren&rsquo;t supposed to see that,&rdquo;</i> His tone was demeaning as if it was <i>her</i> fault that she was hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Obviously I wasn&rsquo;t. What did I expect asking you for dinner and a movie?&rdquo; </b></i>She admitted, attitude going down in the dumps and a little sourer. <i><b>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;m always last on the list, huh?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>He shook his head fast that it was dizzying,<i> &ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not,</i>&rdquo; She lifted a hand to silence him from his unprepared excuses, &ldquo;<i><b>Save it. Just go.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>And with that, Harry was left immobilized on the gravel while Y/N skipped towards the front door. She made eye contact with him before shutting the door against the frame. </p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>Y/N was disheartened that her long and tiring day only sought to be more disappointing than she had expected.<i> How could she ever think Harry would be able to deliver with her request?</i> He was busy pleasing other woman and to even think of satisfying Y/N was swirling down the drain. </p><p>She huffed, annoyed at his ability to piss her off every twenty minutes. This was who they were behind closed doors. The speculations of their fans and the prying articles of news outlets could have never guessed that precious Y/N and Harry were not as innocent as they appeared to be. This had been their scenario for the past couple of months. This was them now; this is Harry &hellip;</p><p>But this <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> Y/N and maybe it&rsquo;s time for a change.</p><p>As YN picked up the light case of her phone, she tapped unto her contact list and found the name she&rsquo;d been searching for. He had frequented in dropping hints about how he found her attractive, but of course, Y/N never felt objectified because his charm glazed him with an ability to soften the tough barricades of her heart. He was respectful to her <i>and</i> to Harry and kept his distance away from Y/N even though he was looking at her with lustful eyes during the Nolan premier. His self-control was amazing, Y/N gave him that. The way he focused on her with such an intense gaze made her squirm in her seat and partly wished that it was Harry who couldn&rsquo;t keep his eyes off her.</p><p>There had always been sexual tension present in the air between them, but neither parties acted upon it because of who they were. Not only would it cause a big scandal, but they were afraid that it would ruin their friendship with each other. Y/N cared too much and he would rather have her as a friend if he couldn&rsquo;t have her as a significant other.</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s fingers tapped on the keyboard with fresh speed; a sentence that she had never thought should, or be able to type.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Come over and fuck me.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>She waited until the text was titled &lsquo;<i>sent</i>&rsquo;, before taking a quick shower and slipping into some <i>white</i> lace lingerie that complimented the curves of her body. Y/N popped the cork of a wine bottle as well, setting it on the bedside table and grabbed to clear glasses in the kitchen. After some time, the doorbell rang and she had sprinted down the stairs, walking the last few meters to catch her breath and swung the door open.</p><p>Y/N scanned the man in front of her, dressed in a simple white tee and grey sweats that showed off his bulge that she had wondered about frequently. The shared a small smile with each other, a twinkle in their eyes.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Hey Shawn,&rdquo;</b></i> Y/N greeted before feeling a pair of lips pressed against her own. Her chest landing on his broad pane. Somewhere in the distance, the front door slammed shut and her body got pinned on the wood. He groaned lightly against her mouth when she traced a finger on his neck, grazing over the generic soft spot, feeling him shiver with delight and her lashes flutter on her cheeks.</p><p>She should&rsquo;ve done this sooner. </p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>ok not gonna lie, I feel like I totally rushed this but my schedule is getting busier and busier and I didn&rsquo;t wanna leave you guys yearning for more so ta-da! :D</p><p><br /></p><p>I think the 3rd part will contain some filth?? my FIRST smut fix and sksksksk </p><p><b>permanent taglist;&nbsp;</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\">@ynm1505</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllO8kf7mHbYqWkUel7PGCQ\">@kissme-hs</a>   <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdJF3NJteLUvYL-8VwYgb4Q\">@agoddamnmango</a>   <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moDJn5hX6SkRScTXK72OY6A\">@harrys-kingdom</a>   <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_IeDacUKwJGZbqRtfMWzvQ\">@calums-sugarbaby</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYw6F23YjyqNBkPppNmZASQ\">@queenbeestuffs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP9U8Ifzi0uGrwDvrygbINQ\">@ashkuuuu</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9pZWnOrrY9h5VJS1URecA\">@kettxo</a> @send-me-styles <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXoQhCPkZyNoq-dkMBzcGA\">@littledreamybeth</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx5Qf5iESVyZePbw9HHz9A\">@trustfulhaz</a> @harrysfeastedflower <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\">@harrystxleslx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk_fg5KH2srp5CoqMWt16iA\">@befourep</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m28p46mWBXKJFhf-csISF6Q\">@moonandstars-xo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\">@babebenhardy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@swayingnoodlelove</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCvJqvn1gEbScr1BTBfGYCw\">@mendesromano</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mELeQ4zjqQjlY7Fxyz3V4jQ\">@harrystylinsince1994</a> 4 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-cUeGpvGXwzOTwYC4IGohQ\">@juliassgem</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPlhoPKTgOFq8MXJNqtHlBA\">@miscll-fangirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meMMUmrzulyFF4z1Gr5JhyA\">@little-dragon-ate-my-heart</a> </p><p><b>jalboyh taglist;&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a>&nbsp;@officiallyunofficalperson&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnfJgBWousYCdg-N8HVKFKg\">@gviosca</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maUEy5XG795w6hoVUqreFUQ\">@llandaaa</a> @mutuallynotmutual&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSwWtUn-ks_CNxtFgLmlK9w\">@mellamolayla</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhPHBijWPp3yEYQxB4U16Tg\">@madformichael</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9qoGsz943Swrb53iZblgJQ\">@toolazymyguy</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrnGlwLdLeF4IPiM_hq5LUw\">@sauveteen</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muOXh77x_A7MHx-DA-KYz_A\">@rebelflower19</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPTLc1wiL8ihmbcx3E_gbSQ\">@myfangirlworld</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnLWb3UwvV0gfgjl6P1SSYg\">@stella95827</a> @katelynmusic&nbsp;@loganmay19&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkx2X828MT00novhWw8Snjw\">@calssunflower</a> </p><p>&#8203;</p></p>",
