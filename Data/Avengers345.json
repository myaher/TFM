You would usually excuse yourself from Tony&rsquo;s team as you get pulled away from the group by your manager, wanting to introduce you to certain brands that would die for you to work for them, or by your friends who wanted to gush about the Avengers.</p><p>All you could really tell them was that you weren&rsquo;t all too shy to approach them, which apparently they were. They were often approached by your friends which they politely spoke to, but they were more interested in speaking with you, mostly because you knew a lot of embarrassing life events of Tony before they met him. You and Tony had spoken about the idea of you being openly public about your relationship with him. To the world\u2013 you were simply an associate that he would talk to during after parties that he was invited to. No one really had caught you two spending time with each other outside of those parties. And Tony would like to keep it that way, for your safety.</p><p>He had put Pepper in a dangerous situation because of who he is, and he wasn&rsquo;t going to drag you into it either, which you understood. You liked your privacy, as much as you like the fame and the fans that had worshipped your work\u2013 you wanted the privacy, wanted to act like a regular girl every now and then. You were careful during certain events where paparazzi were present, as much as you itched on spending time with your best friend\u2013 it was impossible. You thanked the stars that every single VS Fashion Show, the pap weren&rsquo;t present as it was a private party, so you had as much time as you wanted to spend it with Tony\u2013 minus the part where you got dragged every now and then because your presence was wanted elsewhere.</p><p>During the night before you were able to return to Tony and his friends, you&rsquo;ve stumbled upon a familiar face. You two stood a few feet away from Tony&rsquo;s group, and you felt his eyes on you\u2013 probably wondering whom the heck you were with. Like you said, you were a very private person and speaking of your personal lovers wasn&rsquo;t something you wanted to share to others, even Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Fancy seeing you here, Samuel.&rdquo; You drawled, a brow arching in curiosity as you take in his appearance. He was still able to steal your breath away when he flashes you his smile. Right, <i>Samuel George Claflin.</i> The man before you was someone you had momentarily met a few months back\u2013 unfortunately, you two had rough patches that couldn&rsquo;t be fixed and decided to walk out from each other&rsquo;s lives. You, were moving along just nicely \u2013 while as he was, obviously <i>not.</i></p><p>Ever so often you would cross paths and every chance he could get, he would drop the hint of getting back together which you pretended you didn&rsquo;t notice, brushing him off. You weren&rsquo;t ready for the step that he wanted to go with \u2013 which was to go public about the relationship. Though, he still tried but you both were on friendly terms.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t miss this for the world, you know it. I&rsquo;m always here to support you. Though, I&rsquo;m surprised that your manager had invited me. Care to explain?&rdquo; he asked and you could see the hope in your eyes.<i> Damn, Mark!</i> He has serious explaining to do, meddling in your relationships.</p><p>You shrugged in response as you flash him a small smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad you&rsquo;re here then. How have you been?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I prefer if we talk somewhere private. I just\u2026&rdquo; he trailed off. <i>Oh boy</i>, you knew where this was headed. &ldquo;\u2026think about it, okay? I know you still have my number and if not, I&rsquo;ll message you to remind you if you don&rsquo;t contact me in the next few days. Just think about it, we really need to talk things through without all the kicking and screaming from the both of us.&rdquo;</p><p>You watched him, honestly quite shocked at his sincere desperate words. You knew Sam still wanted to get back together but you could see that it was literally killing him now; you felt your heart tug at the sight of him. You give him a nod and a small reassuring smile before leaning up to press a small kiss to his cheek with a mumble, &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, I&rsquo;ll leave you then. You seem to be enjoying your time.&rdquo; He whispered into your ear as he pulled you closer to him by your waist. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to ruin anything for you, you deserve to have the best night at the moment after your performance. You did wonderful, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>You were blushing and sputtering thanks to Sam, you thought to yourself for a moment as you watched him depart from where he stood before you. You let out a grunt of distress, not really wanting to think about him\u2013 you were the kind of person who didn&rsquo;t want to upset anyone, always wanting to go along the flow. Sam had meant everything to you and you were in cloud nine during the time, but the thought of going public scared you and you pulled away.</p><p>Deciding to push the thoughts of Sam away, you turned towards the direction of Tony and his friends and began approaching with that smile of yours again. You were instantly greeted once more with glee.</p><p>&ldquo;And who was that you were talking to, hmmm?&rdquo; the one that had introduced herself as Natasha, gushed in a teasing manner. Curiosity sparkling in her eyes as she tried to push you for answers, Tony clearly was not amused at the subject.</p><p>&ldquo;You never told me you had a boyfriend.&rdquo; He said with a raised brow, crossing his arms across his chest as he tried to look disappointed. You chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not my boyfriend, well\u2013 not anymore at least.&rdquo; You said with a shrug of your shoulders. &ldquo;We ended a couple of months ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like it, Y/N.&rdquo; Natasha teased, giggling to herself\u2013 obviously the alcohol had already taken over most of her control.</p><p>Your eyes flickered from each teammate who were just as curious as Tony, waiting for you to speak more of the matter, &ldquo;Honestly, we&rsquo;re over but\u2013 but it&rsquo;s only been a couple of months since then. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe there&rsquo;s still something there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To hell with that!&rdquo; Tony snapped like the overprotective older brother you had gotten used to. You shook your head at him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going out with anyone. Period.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look at that, metal man being the overprotective father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut it, Reindeer Games.&rdquo; Tony barked, causing you and the team to erupt into laughter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying, if you&rsquo;re going to at least date someone\u2013 it should be someone like, oh I don&rsquo;t know our ol&rsquo; Captain America over here, Steve.&rdquo; He said casually, his eyes never leaving yours as he pats Steve on the back that sat next to him.</p><p>You groaned inwardly, fighting the blush that wanted to creep across your cheeks. <i>You are so dead, Stark</i>. You put your best poker face on, not wanting to give anything away. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you have the say on who I go out with, Tony.&rdquo; You said coolly, not wanting to break your gaze from Tony. You couldn&rsquo;t risk looking over at Steve and exposing your secret.</p><p>&ldquo;Plus, why Steve? Why not me?&rdquo; the person you&rsquo;ve come to know as Bucky spoke from next to you; a grin now spreading on your lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Or Me.&rdquo; the one Tony called &lsquo;Reindeer Games&rsquo; spoke up. What was his name? Ah yes, <i>Loki.</i></p><p>Tony looks at them as if they just asked a stupid question and you couldn&rsquo;t help but snicker at the sight. He broke his gaze from you and looked over to the man that sat next you, &ldquo;You need to prove it to me that you are worthy of such privilege of becoming Y/N&rsquo;s boyfriend, she&rsquo;s family this one.&rdquo; He said before turning to look over at Loki with a brow raised, &ldquo;You almost killed all of us, I&rsquo;m not letting you near her.&rdquo;</p><p>Laughter was all that was heard from the group after that and you couldn&rsquo;t deny that spending time was them was the most fun you had in years, you were glad that Tony was still someone you can call family. As the night passed by, most of your friends had already left. And you decided that it was probably best for you to make your departure as well.</p><p>&ldquo;What? The night&rsquo;s still young, Lady Y/N!&rdquo; Thor boomed, clearly disappointed at my announcement.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to agree with Thunder Man.&rdquo; Tony shrugged as he leaned back against the booth, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come join us back at the tower for the night? We have extra rooms. We can have our own little party there.&rdquo;</p><p>You pressed your lips to a thin line, in thought. You didn&rsquo;t have any plans tomorrow since you made sure to instruct Mark not to do any bookings as to enjoy a relaxing day off after the show. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, we haven&rsquo;t seen each other in a while!&rdquo; Tony said, practically begging now. <i>Ah,</i> there was the Tony you adored.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Y/N. It&rsquo;ll be fun.&rdquo; Steve said, flashing you a smile and damn, you just wanted to melt right there or scream like a little girl.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, fine\u2013 but I am so not drinking anymore, nor should you let Natasha.&rdquo; You said, pointing towards a nearly passed out Natasha at the corner.</p><p>As you said goodbyes to certain people, including Mark\u2013 who gave you a stern look and gave you the famous talk; <i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting you back at your penthouse by lunch tomorrow, and if you&rsquo;re not home by then\u2013 I swear, I&rsquo;ll drag you out of that tower myself.

Paparazzi was still around waiting for the remaining guests to leave just in case there was something scandalous like what you were doing, leaving with the Avengers. Thankfully they made sure you left the building unseen, apparently it had something to do with Loki but you weren&rsquo;t sure what exactly it was. All you knew is that you weren&rsquo;t seen and now you were all huddled around their living area, laughing and joking around.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s play a game. Truth or Dare, anyone?&rdquo; Tony suggested from his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you, a kid?&rdquo; I asked, a laugh leaving my lips. <i>Oh, I know you well enough to know what you&rsquo;re planning! Once I get Tony alone, I swear I&rsquo;ll choke him!</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on, Y/N! Live a little, it&rsquo;s just a silly game.&rdquo; Natasha gushed from her seat. After awhile, Natasha finally recovered from all the alcohol and was slowly returning back to her normal self. You held your hands up in the air as a sign you weren&rsquo;t going to protest any longer.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Tony we&rsquo;ll start with you since you thought about it. Truth or Dare?&rdquo; Natasha asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Truth.&rdquo; He shrugged. There were boos coming from most of you who were seated on the loveseat. You were squished between Steve and Bucky. &ldquo;Oh, shut up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, is it true that when you were a kid someone practically shoved their bare butt in your face and your cried for your mother?&rdquo; Natasha asked, teasingly.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! You need to stop sharing them these!&rdquo; Tony snapped at the memory, shooting you a glare and all you could do, well\u2013 mostly everyone was burst into laughter. That was all the confirmation they needed. You were laughing so hard that you held onto your sides, barely noticing that you leaned against Steve who stiffened next to you. &ldquo;Think it&rsquo;s funny, do you? Oh okay, Y/N you&rsquo;re next. Truth or Dare.&rdquo;</p><p>You wiped the almost tears that wanted to come out from all of your laughing as you try to regain your composure.

You would usually excuse yourself from Tony\u2019s team as you get pulled away from the group by your manager, wanting to introduce you to certain brands that would die for you to work for them, or by your friends who wanted to gush about the Avengers.</p><p>All you could really tell them was that you weren\u2019t all too shy to approach them, which apparently they were. They were often approached by your friends which they politely spoke to, but they were more interested in speaking with you, mostly because you knew a lot of embarrassing life events of Tony before they met him. You and Tony had spoken about the idea of you being openly public about your relationship with him. To the world\u2013 you were simply an associate that he would talk to during after parties that he was invited to. No one really had caught you two spending time with each other outside of those parties. And Tony would like to keep it that way, for your safety.</p><p>He had put Pepper in a dangerous situation because of who he is, and he wasn\u2019t going to drag you into it either, which you understood. You liked your privacy, as much as you like the fame and the fans that had worshipped your work\u2013 you wanted the privacy, wanted to act like a regular girl every now and then.

You would usually excuse yourself from Tony\u2019s team as you get pulled away from the group by your manager, wanting to introduce you to certain brands that would die for you to work for them, or by your friends who wanted to gush about the Avengers.</p><p>All you could really tell them was that you weren\u2019t all too shy to approach them, which apparently they were. They were often approached by your friends which they politely spoke to, but they were more interested in speaking with you, mostly because you knew a lot of embarrassing life events of Tony before they met him. You and Tony had spoken about the idea of you being openly public about your relationship with him. To the world\u2013 you were simply an associate that he would talk to during after parties that he was invited to. No one really had caught you two spending time with each other outside of those parties. And Tony would like to keep it that way, for your safety.</p><p>He had put Pepper in a dangerous situation because of who he is, and he wasn\u2019t going to drag you into it either, which you understood. You liked your privacy, as much as you like the fame and the fans that had worshipped your work\u2013 you wanted the privacy, wanted to act like a regular girl every now and then. You were careful during certain events where paparazzi were present, as much as you itched on spending time with your best friend\u2013 it was impossible. You thanked the stars that every single VS Fashion Show, the pap weren\u2019t present as it was a private party, so you had as much time as you wanted to spend it with Tony\u2013 minus the part where you got dragged every now and then because your presence was wanted elsewhere.</p><p>During the night before you were able to return to Tony and his friends, you\u2019ve stumbled upon a familiar face. You two stood a few feet away from Tony\u2019s group, and you felt his eyes on you\u2013 probably wondering whom the heck you were with. Like you said, you were a very private person and speaking of your personal lovers wasn\u2019t something you wanted to share to others, even Tony.</p><p>\u201cFancy seeing you here, Samuel.\u201d You drawled, a brow arching in curiosity as you take in his appearance. He was still able to steal your breath away when he flashes you his smile. Right, <i>Samuel George Claflin.</i> The man before you was someone you had momentarily met a few months back\u2013 unfortunately, you two had rough patches that couldn\u2019t be fixed and decided to walk out from each other\u2019s lives. You, were moving along just nicely \u2013 while as he was, obviously <i>not.</i></p><p>Ever so often you would cross paths and every chance he could get, he would drop the hint of getting back together which you pretended you didn\u2019t notice, brushing him off. You weren\u2019t ready for the step that he wanted to go with \u2013 which was to go public about the relationship. Though, he still tried but you both were on friendly terms.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss this for the world, you know it. I\u2019m always here to support you. Though, I\u2019m surprised that your manager had invited me. Care to explain?\u201d he asked and you could see the hope in your eyes.<i> Damn, Mark!</i> He has serious explaining to do, meddling in your relationships.</p><p>You shrugged in response as you flash him a small smile, \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re here then. How have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I prefer if we talk somewhere private. I just\u2026\u201d he trailed off. <i>Oh boy</i>, you knew where this was headed. \u201c\u2026think about it, okay? I know you still have my number and if not, I\u2019ll message you to remind you if you don\u2019t contact me in the next few days. Just think about it, we really need to talk things through without all the kicking and screaming from the both of us.\u201d</p><p>You watched him, honestly quite shocked at his sincere desperate words. You knew Sam still wanted to get back together but you could see that it was literally killing him now; you felt your heart tug at the sight of him. You give him a nod and a small reassuring smile before leaning up to press a small kiss to his cheek with a mumble, \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, I\u2019ll leave you then. You seem to be enjoying your time.\u201d He whispered into your ear as he pulled you closer to him by your waist. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to ruin anything for you, you deserve to have the best night at the moment after your performance. You did wonderful, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>You were blushing and sputtering thanks to Sam, you thought to yourself for a moment as you watched him depart from where he stood before you. You let out a grunt of distress, not really wanting to think about him\u2013 you were the kind of person who didn\u2019t want to upset anyone, always wanting to go along the flow. Sam had meant everything to you and you were in cloud nine during the time, but the thought of going public scared you and you pulled away.</p><p>Deciding to push the thoughts of Sam away, you turned towards the direction of Tony and his friends and began approaching with that smile of yours again. You were instantly greeted once more with glee.</p><p>\u201cAnd who was that you were talking to, hmmm?\u201d the one that had introduced herself as Natasha, gushed in a teasing manner. Curiosity sparkling in her eyes as she tried to push you for answers, Tony clearly was not amused at the subject.</p><p>\u201cYou never told me you had a boyfriend.\u201d He said with a raised brow, crossing his arms across his chest as he tried to look disappointed. You chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend, well\u2013 not anymore at least.\u201d You said with a shrug of your shoulders. \u201cWe ended a couple of months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it, Y/N.\u201d Natasha teased, giggling to herself\u2013 obviously the alcohol had already taken over most of her control.</p><p>Your eyes flickered from each teammate who were just as curious as Tony, waiting for you to speak more of the matter, \u201cHonestly, we\u2019re over but\u2013 but it\u2019s only been a couple of months since then. I don\u2019t know, maybe there\u2019s still something there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hell with that!\u201d Tony snapped like the overprotective older brother you had gotten used to. You shook your head at him, \u201cYou\u2019re not going out with anyone. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you look at that, metal man being the overprotective father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it, Reindeer Games.\u201d Tony barked, causing you and the team to erupt into laughter. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, if you\u2019re going to at least date someone\u2013 it should be someone like, oh I don\u2019t know our ol\u2019 Captain America over here, Steve.\u201d He said casually, his eyes never leaving yours as he pats Steve on the back that sat next to him.</p><p>You groaned inwardly, fighting the blush that wanted to creep across your cheeks. <i>You are so dead, Stark</i>. You put your best poker face on, not wanting to give anything away. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have the say on who I go out with, Tony.\u201d You said coolly, not wanting to break your gaze from Tony. You couldn\u2019t risk looking over at Steve and exposing your secret.</p><p>\u201cPlus, why Steve? Why not me?\u201d the person you\u2019ve come to know as Bucky spoke from next to you; a grin now spreading on your lips.</p><p>\u201cOr Me.\u201d the one Tony called \u2018Reindeer Games\u2019 spoke up. What was his name? Ah yes, <i>Loki.</i></p><p>Tony looks at them as if they just asked a stupid question and you couldn\u2019t help but snicker at the sight. He broke his gaze from you and looked over to the man that sat next you, \u201cYou need to prove it to me that you are worthy of such privilege of becoming Y/N\u2019s boyfriend, she\u2019s family this one.\u201d He said before turning to look over at Loki with a brow raised, \u201cYou almost killed all of us, I\u2019m not letting you near her.\u201d</p><p>Laughter was all that was heard from the group after that and you couldn\u2019t deny that spending time was them was the most fun you had in years, you were glad that Tony was still someone you can call family. As the night passed by, most of your friends had already left. And you decided that it was probably best for you to make your departure as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat? The night\u2019s still young, Lady Y/N!\u201d Thor boomed, clearly disappointed at my announcement.</p><p>\u201cI have to agree with Thunder Man.\u201d Tony shrugged as he leaned back against the booth, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come join us back at the tower for the night? We have extra rooms. We can have our own little party there.\u201d</p><p>You pressed your lips to a thin line, in thought. You didn\u2019t have any plans tomorrow since you made sure to instruct Mark not to do any bookings as to enjoy a relaxing day off after the show. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, we haven\u2019t seen each other in a while!\u201d Tony said, practically begging now. <i>Ah,</i> there was the Tony you adored.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Y/N. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d Steve said, flashing you a smile and damn, you just wanted to melt right there or scream like a little girl.</p><p>\u201cAlright, fine\u2013 but I am so not drinking anymore, nor should you let Natasha.\u201d You said, pointing towards a nearly passed out Natasha at the corner.</p><p>As you said goodbyes to certain people, including Mark\u2013 who gave you a stern look and gave you the famous talk; <i>\u201cI\u2019m expecting you back at your penthouse by lunch tomorrow, and if you\u2019re not home by then\u2013 I swear, I\u2019ll drag you out of that tower myself. We have important matters to discuss on your upcoming projects!\u201d </i>Oh you wouldn\u2019t know what to do with Mark as your manager, you weren\u2019t as organized as he was.</p><p>Moving to the Avenger Tower was easy, Tony made sure of that. Paparazzi was still around waiting for the remaining guests to leave just in case there was something scandalous like what you were doing, leaving with the Avengers. Thankfully they made sure you left the building unseen, apparently it had something to do with Loki but you weren\u2019t sure what exactly it was. All you knew is that you weren\u2019t seen and now you were all huddled around their living area, laughing and joking around.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s play a game. Truth or Dare, anyone?\u201d Tony suggested from his seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, a kid?\u201d I asked, a laugh leaving my lips. <i>Oh, I know you well enough to know what you\u2019re planning! Once I get Tony alone, I swear I\u2019ll choke him!</i></p><p>\u201cOh come on, Y/N! Live a little, it\u2019s just a silly game.\u201d Natasha gushed from her seat. After awhile, Natasha finally recovered from all the alcohol and was slowly returning back to her normal self. You held your hands up in the air as a sign you weren\u2019t going to protest any longer.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Tony we\u2019ll start with you since you thought about it. Truth or Dare?\u201d Natasha asked.</p><p>\u201cTruth.\u201d He shrugged. There were boos coming from most of you who were seated on the loveseat. You were squished between Steve and Bucky. \u201cOh, shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, is it true that when you were a kid someone practically shoved their bare butt in your face and your cried for your mother?\u201d Natasha asked, teasingly.</p><p>\u201cY/N! You need to stop sharing them these!\u201d Tony snapped at the memory, shooting you a glare and all you could do, well\u2013 mostly everyone was burst into laughter. That was all the confirmation they needed. You were laughing so hard that you held onto your sides, barely noticing that you leaned against Steve who stiffened next to you. \u201cThink it\u2019s funny, do you? Oh okay, Y/N you\u2019re next. Truth or Dare.\u201d</p><p>You wiped the almost tears that wanted to come out from all of your laughing as you try to regain your composure. Sticking your tongue out at him playfully, you shrugged as you spoke, \u201cUhm, okay. Dare.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes widened at your own answer.<i> Fuck.</i> You knew where this was going as Tony\u2019s lips twitched to a smile. \u201cOkay, I dare you to kiss Captain.\u201d He said with a shrug. \u201cUnless you\u2019re too chicken.\u201d You shoot a glare towards Tony\u2019s direction and he just smiled at you innocently. Looking over at Steve who was suddenly tense next to you. You heard Tony who was suddenly making chicken noises and you wanted to hurt him more than ever now. He knew you too much that pushing you got on your nerves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Y/N you don\u2019t have to\u2013\u201d you cut Steve off with your lips pressing against his and his eyes widen at the action. For a minute you thought he was going to pull away but then butterflies fill your stomach as he pulls you to him closer; deepening the kiss between you and you felt his arm wrap around your waist.</p><p><i>Well, fuck.</i></p><p>Pulling away, you didn\u2019t even care to understand what Tony was blabbering about in the background. All you could do was look up at Steve, slightly dizzy at what just had happened. He just flashed you a small smile, <i>stop being so charming!</i></p></p>",

It&rsquo;ll be fun.&rdquo; Steve said, flashing you a smile and damn, you just wanted to melt right there or scream like a little girl.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, fine&ndash; but I am so not drinking anymore, nor should you let Natasha.&rdquo; You said, pointing towards a nearly passed out Natasha at the corner.</p><p>As you said goodbyes to certain people, including Mark&ndash; who gave you a stern look and gave you the famous talk; <i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting you back at your penthouse by lunch tomorrow, and if you&rsquo;re not home by then&ndash; I swear, I&rsquo;ll drag you out of that tower myself. We have important matters to discuss on your upcoming projects!&rdquo; </i>Oh you wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with Mark as your manager, you weren&rsquo;t as organized as he was.</p><p>Moving to the Avenger Tower was easy, Tony made sure of that. Paparazzi was still around waiting for the remaining guests to leave just in case there was something scandalous like what you were doing, leaving with the Avengers. Thankfully they made sure you left the building unseen, apparently it had something to do with Loki but you weren&rsquo;t sure what exactly it was. All you knew is that you weren&rsquo;t seen and now you were all huddled around their living area, laughing and joking around.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s play a game. Truth or Dare, anyone?&rdquo; Tony suggested from his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you, a kid?&rdquo; I asked, a laugh leaving my lips. <i>Oh, I know you well enough to know what you&rsquo;re planning! Once I get Tony alone, I swear I&rsquo;ll choke him!</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on, Y/N! Live a little, it&rsquo;s just a silly game.&rdquo; Natasha gushed from her seat. After awhile, Natasha finally recovered from all the alcohol and was slowly returning back to her normal self. You held your hands up in the air as a sign you weren&rsquo;t going to protest any longer.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Tony we&rsquo;ll start with you since you thought about it. Truth or Dare?&rdquo; Natasha asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Truth.&rdquo; He shrugged. There were boos coming from most of you who were seated on the loveseat. You were squished between Steve and Bucky. &ldquo;Oh, shut up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, is it true that when you were a kid someone practically shoved their bare butt in your face and your cried for your mother?&rdquo; Natasha asked, teasingly.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! You need to stop sharing them these!&rdquo; Tony snapped at the memory, shooting you a glare and all you could do, well&ndash; mostly everyone was burst into laughter. That was all the confirmation they needed. You were laughing so hard that you held onto your sides, barely noticing that you leaned against Steve who stiffened next to you. &ldquo;Think it&rsquo;s funny, do you? Oh okay, Y/N you&rsquo;re next. Truth or Dare.&rdquo;</p><p>You wiped the almost tears that wanted to come out from all of your laughing as you try to regain your composure. Sticking your tongue out at him playfully, you shrugged as you spoke, &ldquo;Uhm, okay. Dare.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes widened at your own answer.<i> Fuck.</i> You knew where this was going as Tony&rsquo;s lips twitched to a smile. &ldquo;Okay, I dare you to kiss Captain.&rdquo; He said with a shrug. &ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re too chicken.&rdquo; You shoot a glare towards Tony&rsquo;s direction and he just smiled at you innocently. Looking over at Steve who was suddenly tense next to you. You heard Tony who was suddenly making chicken noises and you wanted to hurt him more than ever now. He knew you too much that pushing you got on your nerves.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Y/N you don&rsquo;t have to&ndash;&rdquo; you cut Steve off with your lips pressing against his and his eyes widen at the action. For a minute you thought he was going to pull away but then butterflies fill your stomach as he pulls you to him closer; deepening the kiss between you and you felt his arm wrap around your waist.</p><p><i>Well, fuck.</i></p><p>Pulling away, you didn&rsquo;t even care to understand what Tony was blabbering about in the background. All you could do was look up at Steve, slightly dizzy at what just had happened. He just flashed you a small smile, <i>stop being so charming!</i></p></p>",
