        "question": "I don't get any of the jonsa theories that jon will need sansa politically because i would think that sansa and the rest of the starklings would support jon no matter what because he is their brother and they love him.  Also bran is the heir to winterfell, not jon or sansa.  They always forget that bran is the lord even though right now he wants to defeat the threat up north.  Any political angle for jonsa just makes no sense.",
