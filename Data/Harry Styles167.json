That\u2019s what the magazine article said her name was. It didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019d know her face anywhere, or that Rose was also pictured with her, the name change confused me, and I couldn\u2019t believe I was seeing Layla\u2019s face after so long. Standing up for no reason other than needing to feel like I was doing something, I stared at her photo to make sure I wasn\u2019t seeing things. Her hair was shorter, loose, blonde waves resting on her shoulders, she smiled at the camera just enough to make the dimples in her cheeks visible, and I could see a confidence I hadn&rsquo;t really seen in her before. But it was her - it was my Layla.</p><!-- more --><p>Seeing her in a magazine had thrown me. I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself or my emotions. A lot of my exes were regularly in the media, and I\u2019d grown used to seeing someone I\u2019d been intimate with as I read the newspaper and its accompanying supplements over my cornflakes, but I had never expected to see her. She looked&hellip;beautiful.</p><p>I sat back down and took a deep breath to calm myself. Grabbing my phone, I took a photo of the article and sent it to Jeff. I knew he\u2019d probably start worrying that I was about to spiral again, but I felt excitement at seeing her more than upset or pain, and I had to tell someone about it.</p><p>He was quick to reply, though it was late in LA.</p><p><b>Jeff</b><br/><i>You ok?</i></p><p><b>Harry</b><br/><i>I\u2019m good, man. Can we sort out sending some flowers to their office? To say congrats on the article?</i></p><p>Jeff started to type, then stopped, then started again. Even when we weren\u2019t in the same place, I could tell he was reluctant to indulge me when it came to Layla. I could practically hear him muttering to himself \u201chere we go again.\u201d</p><p><b>Jeff</b><br/><i>Yeah, no worries.</i><br/><i>Are you sure you want to?</i></p><p>I had to. She&rsquo;d sent me roses - pink, like I always sent her - to congratulate and wish me luck when &lsquo;Sign of the Times&rsquo; came out. I had kept the card that came with the flowers with me at all times, hidden away under my phone case. There&rsquo;d been no name inside but I&rsquo;d known it was from her, and I wanted to return the gesture.</p><p><b>Harry</b><br/><i>Yes. Baby pink roses, but don\u2019t say they\u2019re from me. Thanks! </i><br/><i>Go to sleep!</i></p><p><b>Jeff</b><br/><i>Ok, I\u2019ll sort it out in the morning.</i></p><p>Setting my phone back down on the table, I looked at Layla\u2019s face again. I missed her so much, and all the feelings I\u2019d spent three years learning to push down came flooding back, a huge wave of love, and an aching absence for the one who got away. Long since forgotten memories bubbled up to the surface, along with the things that I loved about her, things that frustrated me, and things she did that she probably didn\u2019t realise made me adore her.</p><p>I was struck by the memory of when I knew I was falling in love with her. I\u2019d already suspected it was happening, and I\u2019d tried to brush it off as just infatuation for someone I couldn\u2019t have, but seeing Layla crying that night in the restaurant changed everything. I knew then that we were more than just two people who\u2019d had a throwaway fling. I was worried for her, and I wanted nothing more than to protect her from whatever Will had said or done to upset her. When I\u2019d tried to go over, she\u2019d shook her head, worried that I\u2019d only make things worse. So, all I could do was watch as Will practically dragged her from their table, and watch as she gave me a quick glance over her shoulder, her face fraught with fear and misery over what was possibly going to happen when they were alone. The expression on her face had haunted me, so much so that I\u2019d invited Will and Terry to our movie premiere just so she would be there too. I\u2019d sent her a message to tell her I really wanted her to be there, and she\u2019d sent a short reply agreeing. I just wanted to make sure she was okay, and even if we didn\u2019t rekindle our affair, I\u2019d at least know that everything was alright.</p><p>When I saw Terry\u2019s daughter, Mia, instead of Layla, I\u2019d thought she\u2019d come in her place, and I was disappointed that she had changed her mind. Any other time I would have just casually asked Will where she was, but I had found saying anything other than a quick hello to him too difficult, so I\u2019d tried to just enjoy the night. So, my heart had skipped a beat when I\u2019d been in the hotel bar talking to Alice, and I\u2019d looked up to see Layla stood in the doorway, dressed in black like she was was attending a funeral, and looking at me with what almost looked like jealousy.</p><p>I talked her into meeting me in a room upstairs, which I\u2019d requested specifically so we would have somewhere to talk alone. She\u2019d sat on the edge of the bed, with her shapely legs crossed, and a passive smile on her red lips, and told me that her crying had been because she\u2019d been tired and emotional from her holiday. I\u2019d known she was lying, but as I joined her on the bed, I\u2019d had no choice but to accept her insistence that there was nothing wrong, that she\u2019d made it all seem worse than it actually was. And then, when she tried to leave, I stopped her, and I told her I missed her. As soon as we kissed again, I knew that I couldn\u2019t walk away from her easily. I wanted her, I needed her, and although she tried to fight it, I knew Layla felt the same.</p><p>I was downstairs when the penny dropped. After we\u2019d arranged to spend more than one night together, after I\u2019d joined her while she sat alone waiting for her husband to appear, after I\u2019d introduced her to my mother, and after I\u2019d read the horrible message Will had sent her saying he\u2019d already left - confirming what I\u2019d suspected, that Layla\u2019s insistence that the restaurant incident had just been a one off was really her refusal to show me anything but perfection, after all of that, as we shared a public goodbye in the hotel foyer, hugging and touching as much as we could without arousing suspicion, I finally realised that I was falling head over heels in love with Layla French. The way she smiled and rolled her eyes at my flirtatious comments. The sweet, lingering smell of her perfume, and how she leaned against me when we hugged, and all the other million things that made not asking her to stay almost impossible. I watched her walk away to get her ride home, and I accepted how I felt. I wanted to leave with her, or better still, wanted her to stay so she could meet all my friends and family. The ache of her leaving made me breathless, and sense told me things had gone too far, but the realisation came too late - I was already counting down the days until we were together again.</p><p>The next morning, as I nursed my hangover, I tried to get back some control, pretended like two nights together would probably drive us both mad with boredom or irritation. But then when we were together, and I\u2019d overheard her telling her friend, Rose, that she was excited about her birthday celebrations (and that of course Will had forgotten to get her anything like it was an in-joke), I cast aside all control. She deserved the world, and I wanted to give it to her.</p><p>Remembering how beautiful she\u2019d looked as she smelled the pink roses, which I\u2019d now come to associate with her, made my chest ache.</p><p>With an urgent need of distraction before I was swallowed up by emotion, I switched my focus back to the magazine. The article itself was about female owned businesses and the women who ran them. Layla and Rose had started their own event planning company, aptly named 'Layla-Rose Events&rsquo;, and in the short time it had been up and running, it was going from strength to strength. They talked about how they got started, how they&rsquo;d both put everything they had into it, and how exciting it had been moving into their new office in Shoreditch. It then went on to list some of the famous people they&rsquo;d planned for. I had friends who&rsquo;d been to their parties, and they all commented on how well run the events were, and how everything was catered for. I&rsquo;d casually ask how it was, out of interest, mentioning that I knew the owners, and taking a rare opportunity \u00a0to say her name without being met with a look of worry or derision. Invitations would frequently arrive for me, but because I knew full well that they were at the request of the client, and not because Layla wanted me there, the instruction was given to always politely decline unless told otherwise. The days where I turned up somewhere she didn&rsquo;t want me to just to get her attention were long gone.</p><p>I read the article over three times in a row, trying to remember her voice and how the words she was quoted as saying would sound coming from her mouth. There wasn&rsquo;t enough information, and I felt frustration stir in my belly every time I read that she was now friends with Will and Terry. So much so, in fact, that they&rsquo;d helped the two women find some of their earlier clients, and also let them use some of their office space when it was just a two person operation.</p><p>Will. Of all the people Layla could forgive and allow to be a part of her life, she had chosen Will. I\u2019d been baffled enough by Terry\u2019s appearance the last time I\u2019d ended up on Lil\u2019s doorstep, begging to be heard, but at least he\u2019d always been her supporter. Will, on the other hand, had only ever bullied, berated, and lied to her. Sat alone in my kitchen, with only a chance discovery of an interview in a magazine to tell me what was going on in her life, the frustration and bitterness grew until I had to get up and walk away. I\u2019d come to terms with Layla and I breaking up, and how it had been of my own doing, but I just could not understand how -in comparison to Will- I deserved total exile.</p><p>Safely away from the picture of Layla\u2019s happy, smiling face, the anxiety brought on by how unfair it all felt began to settle. Taking deep and steady breaths, I reminded myself that the decision was not mine to make, and I had to accept that she didn&rsquo;t want me to be a part of her life. She had made her own happiness; she had her own business, she had Rose, and she had all the other people around her that she wanted, and that made her happy. I also had my career and my impending tour, I had the beginnings of a new relationship that was making me happy in a way I hadn\u2019t really felt since Layla, and I had my own group of people who loved and supported me.</p><p>We had both moved on.</p><p>Or rather, Layla had made her decision, and I had no choice but to go along with it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d7daca174232653332b6d144920fa6d/tumblr_inline_pjaa63DFdd1w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"/></figure><p><b>2017 - August</b></p><p>In one of the toughest weeks of my life, two things happened that I never imagined would; the first being my mother, Verity, in the final hours of her life, telling me that she hoped Terry and I were going to have a long and happy life together. And the second was when Harry Styles called to arrange a meeting with Terry and I about us working on his second tour. I wasn\u2019t sure which of the two shocked me more.</p><p>Harry\u2019s call came the day after my mother had passed away, and I was hiding away in my office, hoping that if I pretended to work for long enough that it would distract me from my grief. I gave instructions to Maggie at reception that anyone who called was to be told I was out of office and I would get back to them, or they were to be put through to someone else who could help. But, when Maggie poked her head around the door with a strange look on her face, and said that Harry Styles was on the line, asking to speak to me only, I made an exception.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I tried my best to sound friendly, hoping that he wouldn\u2019t hear the confusion in my voice.</p><p>\u201cHello, Will, it\u2019s Harry.\u201d His deep voice sounded wary, as though he was unsure if calling was a good idea. I imagined that he wasn\u2019t exactly overjoyed at the prospect of being in a room with me, seeing as the last time we were I\u2019d punched him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to hear from you, Harry, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Harry explained that he would be going on a small venue tour that would start at the end of September and would end in early December. He would then be going on a larger, arena tour in mid-March, and he was hoping our company would be interested in working with him.</p><p>For a moment I was stunned silent. The week already had a dream-like quality to it, and Harry wanting to possibly work together only added to that fact. Eventually, I managed to find a reply. \u201cYes, of course, we\u2019d love to work with you again, Harry! When would you like to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould next Wednesday be okay?\u201d Harry asked, thankfully not suggesting the day I&rsquo;d just arranged to have my mother&rsquo;s funeral. \u201cAt three?</p><p>\u201cI have an appointment at twelve, but I will be done by three, so that all sounds good to me. It&rsquo;ll be nice to see you again after so long.\u201d</p><p>He hummed dubiously, and then we both fell into an awkward silence. We could have said goodbye then, hung up, and gone on our merry way, but neither of us said anything. I wanted to give him the time to ask the question I was suspecting he was waiting to ask. However, it never came. Instead, he suddenly said he had to go because of another call, and quickly hung up.</p><p>Shaking my head in disbelief, I sat back in my chair, and after realising I\u2019d practically held my breath for the entirety of the phone call, I exhaled. While I sent Terry a message to come see me when he was free, I couldn\u2019t help but think there had to be some sort of ulterior motive. I was glad of the chance to have Harry\u2019s business, and despite what was going on quite literally behind the scenes, he had always been pleasant to work with. But, I couldn\u2019t for a second let myself think that his request to meet wasn\u2019t some sort of ploy. We had a rocky history, and I was never going to be the top of his list unless he could get something out of it. Something that couldn\u2019t just be said on the phone. Something that no doubt also involved my ex-wife.</p><p>Terry and I agreed that Layla didn\u2019t need to know about the meeting with Harry unless it was absolutely necessary. She was happy, and I liked seeing her that way, so there wasn\u2019t any point in stirring up old feelings over a meeting that might not lead anywhere. It also meant that Joel, Layla\u2019s boyfriend of over a year, and our resource manager, would need to be included on the need to know basis list. I found a supplier I needed him to go see, so he wouldn\u2019t be in the building, and only Terry, Maggie, and I knew that Harry would be visiting.</p><p>Before my meeting with Harry, I had one on Park Lane with my mother\u2019s solicitor to discuss the reading of her will, and all the boring admin sides of losing a loved one. I was the sole heir of her inheritance, but things had been so frosty and unfriendly between us since I finally told her I was with Terry that I half expected to find out she\u2019d followed through with her threats and donated everything to a donkey sanctuary. But, other than a few pieces of jewelry that she\u2019d strangely left Lil, and some money which she did want donated to a donkey sanctuary, all my mother\u2019s estate fell directly to me. The son who\u2019d disappointed her, repeatedly.</p><p>The meeting itself was short, but the traffic back to the office was slow moving and long, so by the time I finally parked my car in the usual spot, I was already fifteen minutes late.</p><p>\u201cAre they here?\u201d I asked Maggie as I burst through the glass doors into our building.</p><p>Maggie nodded and rushed from behind the reception desk. \u201cDon\u2019t go in there looking like that though! You look ready to kill someone.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands on my shoulders and made me take a few deep breaths until I was calmer.</p><p>\u201cTraffic was a nightmare the whole way here. I forgot why I stopped dr-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re here now, and Terry has everything under control. Harry has his manager, Jeff, with him, and I\u2019ve already taken in coffee while they waited for you. I\u2019ve also checked and there isn\u2019t any chance of Joel or Layla making a surprise appearance. Now! Get in there and do what you do best!\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, I let my shoulders relax and thanked my lucky stars that at least one of us was confident I could face Harry again. \u201cThank you, Mags. What would we do without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe building would collapse around your ears, William. I\u2019m like the ravens at the Tower of London, you\u2019re all doomed when I leave.\u201d</p><p>Nerves made an appearance as I approached the meeting room, and I wondered if Terry would kill me if I just went and hid in my office until Harry and his manager were gone. The reality of losing my mother had started to kick in as I\u2019d listened to her final wishes, and both Harry and I knew full well that I didn\u2019t handle things the best when my emotions were running high.</p><p>But, then I remembered that was the point! Harry had his ulterior motive, and so did I. I wanted to, at the very least, make amends and apologise for my behaviour the last time we were in a room together, which I\u2019d been too cowardly to do before now. After I\u2019d thrown the punch, I\u2019d left Layla\u2019s house, and was too scared to face what I had done. Terry took over all of One Direction\u2019s requests and meetings, and I\u2019d hidden away in shame. This opportunity was mine for the taking, I could show Harry that I wasn\u2019t who I\u2019d once been, and that I had changed for the better.</p><p>Pushing the door open, I entered the room, and all three men turned to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry for keeping you!\u201d I smiled, ignoring the glare I was getting from Harry\u2019s manager as I shook his hand, \u201cI think I got caught in every conceivable bit of traffic on my way here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just saying that driving around London is a nightmare this time of day!\u201d Terry laughed, backing me up as we exchanged glances that told me he\u2019d been working a tough crowd.</p><p>The already tense room became even more so as Harry and I came face to face. I felt both Terry and Jeff ready themselves in case one of us erupted into a fight, but looking at Harry - the man who\u2019d had an affair with my wife - I felt nothing but an odd sense of affection. Layla, on the rare occasion she spoke of Harry, had said the same thing - he had given her the confidence to leave me, and although I\u2019d been angry and bitter at the time, it led to my finally having the wonderful, happy life I had with Terry. The huge guilt I felt was because, maybe, I\u2019d ruined Layla\u2019s chance at that same happiness.</p><p>When I shook Harry\u2019s hand, I made sure to look him in the eye in hope that he would know how warm and genuine my words were, and that I held no grudges against him. I only hoped he felt the same. \u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you again, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you too.\u201d He muttered, giving me a tight-lipped smile before sitting back down and taking a sip of his black coffee.</p><p>Walking around the large, rectangle table, I went to sit next to Terry, who squeezed my knee and gave me an encouraging wink. The gesture, though small, reminded me that I was not alone. My husband-to-be was at my side, reminding me that Harry was the last piece of the puzzle I had left to mend.</p><p>With renewed determination, I reached for the folder that contained the company\u2019s proposal for Harry\u2019s tour, opened it, and fixed a smile on my face. &ldquo;So! You&rsquo;re going on tour then, Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>Terry had been excited to plan Harry\u2019s set, choosing to work on most of the designs himself. It took Harry by surprise when we told him that we were big fans of his album, especially when I confessed that we\u2019d already had a lot of ideas in place for his set, because Terry and I would listen to albums we loved in the car and plan fantasy sets for them. His album had been in our car for at least a month after its release, so we\u2019d planned a tour for it on many a journey to and from work.</p><p>The general idea was for it to be similar in simplicity to the designs Terry and my father had started off with in the seventies, but with all the wonders of modern technology. We wanted Harry\u2019s album, and his incredible stage presence, to speak for itself, whilst also having a setup that would use some of the beautiful visuals that had been created for the album.</p><p>To our relief, Harry and his manager seemed to like what we had in mind, nodding along as I ran through our ideas for each song on the rough setlist we\u2019d been sent.</p><p>\u201cBut, of course, Harry, it\u2019s entirely up to you, and we\u2019re open to anything you want to do to represent your work,\u201d Terry said, as our presentation drew to a close. \u201cHowever, as you both know, the sooner we get started the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Harry answered, glancing at Jeff before leaning in to look at the sketches. \u201cIt\u2019s not too far from what I was picturing.\u201d</p><p>Jeff, who was a little keener to keep his cards close to his chest, nodded in agreement, then quickly added, \u201cwe have another meeting tomorrow, and then we\u2019ll let you know. I\u2019m guessing the circular screen will take the longest to manufacture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the company we use is quick to get the ball rolling, so it\u2019ll actually be quicker than one would imagine. It\u2019s checking the mechanics that make it move, which slow down the process.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied with Terry\u2019s answer, the two young men looked at each other and fell silent.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity, I looked at Harry and asked, \u201cwas there anything else you needed to know?\u201d</p><p>Everything felt tense again, as I handed him a platform to get whatever he had come to say off his chest. As his gaze met mine, I could see the words fighting to be said, but his lips betrayed him by staying clamped shut in a tight, thin line.</p><p>It was Jeff who surprised us all by asking, \u201cHow\u2019s Layla?\u201d Harry slowly turned to look at him, and Jeff shrugged, &ldquo;H, if I waited for you to ask, we&rsquo;d be here all day.&rdquo;</p><p>Smiling, I was relieved someone had said what I was waiting for. Harry had wanted to ask, but he didn\u2019t trust me, and he was well within his rights not to. However, I hoped that when I answered, he would know that I was grateful every day for having my ex-wife\u2019s forgiveness when I really wasn\u2019t deserving of it. I also wanted to help him get it too.</p><p>\u201cLayla is doing really well. Her and Rose are working their socks off to make the business a success, and she\u2019s the happiest I\u2019ve seen her in a long time. You should go to one of her events, Harry, you\u2019d be incredibly proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill\u2026\u201d Terry groaned, covering his face with his hand, making me realise that what I\u2019d said had sounded much better in my head. I\u2019d wanted to encourage Harry to make his move, but it had come across like I was gloating.</p><p>Harry sat up in his seat and leaned forward, resting both elbows on the table. Voice measured and restrained, he said, \u201cI think you know why I haven\u2019t been, Will. She doesn\u2019t want me there.\u201d</p><p>Clearing his throat, Terry suddenly stood up and clapped his hands together. &ldquo;Jeff! Why don&rsquo;t I give you a tour of the building? Show you some of the mock ups for some of the old sets we&rsquo;ve done, I keep them all.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeff looked at Harry for the okay, and Harry nodded and muttered it was fine. We waited for them to leave, Terry whispering to me, as he passed, to remember that I didn\u2019t want to fight Harry, I wanted to help him.</p><p>As soon as the door closed, I sighed, \u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s not how I meant that to come across.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Harry replied, somewhat dubiously. \u201cOkay, yeah, as I\u2019m sure you know, I struggled with her decision at first, but I\u2019ve accepted it.\u201d He then added with a hint of bitterness, \u201cShe chose you.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;So, you aren\u2019t here because you want me to help you get back in touch with her, then?&rdquo; I chose to gloss over his comment about me having won. I hadn\u2019t won, Lil hadn\u2019t chose me. It had merely been luck that Terry loved us both enough to help us work past the hurt we\u2019d caused each other. I knew full well that had he not been around, I\u2019d have been out of Layla\u2019s life, and wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to grow a friendship where there had once only been hate and bitterness.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you think I need you to help me? I saw that article, I know where her office is.&rdquo; Defiant, Harry sat back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Harry, you tell me why.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry looked away, reluctant to admit that I was right. Getting up from my seat, I went and sat in the one next to him that Jeff had recently vacated, turning it so I could look at him. \u201cListen, I know we have a\u2026 difficult history, and I understand why you\u2019re reluctant to trust me. But, believe it or not, I am on your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifficult? That\u2019s a bit of an understatement,\u201d Harry scoffed. Turning so we were face to face, he asked, \u201cWhy? Why are you suddenly on my side? You said L\u2026 You said Layla\u2019s happy, why would you help me when you know she doesn\u2019t want me?\u201d</p><p>The pause before he said her name was excruciating, and it told me everything I needed to know about him since Layla had cut him out. I\u2019d heard the songs on his album, heard the pain of someone who\u2019d had their heart broken almost beyond repair, but he was an artist, and embellishment was a tool of the trade. Harry being unable to say her name, without some sort of mental run and jump over the wall he\u2019d built, was evidence that there hadn\u2019t been much embellishment at all.</p><p>But first, I had to address my own issues. Taking a deep breath, I remembered all the things I\u2019d worked on in my therapy sessions, accepted that Harry might not forgive me the way others had, and reminded myself that I had changed. I wasn\u2019t the Will that Harry had once known.</p><p>\u201cI am not the same person as I was back then. I was a horrible man, one who was so caught up in a lie that I\u2019d brought upon myself that I lashed out at the people around me for no other reason than I felt trapped. Layla bore the biggest brunt of that, but even when she found out about Terry and I, she was never malicious. She was sympathetic even, she told us that had I been honest from the start, she would have probably helped us keep our secret. She had the perfect chance to expose me, and get me back for the horrid way I treated her when she came with me to tell my mother about the divorce. She could have told her then, but she sat quietly as she was called a whore and a gold-digger, and she kept my secret.\u201d Chuckling, I tried to lighten the mood, but Harry remained unimpressed, \u201cShe also came with Terry and I when I finally told my mother about us being together, but I think that time was less for support and more for the enjoyment of seeing my mother hit the roof.\u201d<br/>\u201cI already knew you were a shitty person, Will, and I\u2019m sorry you felt like you had no choice, but it doesn\u2019t excuse what you did to her, the way you spoke about her to me when you were trying to be \u2018one of the lads\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Harry, and that\u2019s why I want to help you.\u201d Putting my hand on my heart, I tilted my head back and closed my eyes. I spoke to Harry, but I also spoke to the universe, repeating the promises I\u2019d already made to Layla and Terry - they were my highest priorities in life, and I would stop at nothing to see them happy. \u201cNothing I ever do will make up for my behaviour, but I love her, and I want her to have the happy life she thought she was going to have with me. She deserves it, after everything she&rsquo;s been through.\u201d</p><p>Though not entirely convinced, Harry seemed to accept my answer as genuine. But, he was impatient and waiting for the catch, for the moment I put on my fake moustache and cackled malevolently that I\u2019d tricked him and had no plans to help, for the moment that I was going to tell Layla, and we would both laugh at how pathetic he was.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about our affair? Don\u2019t you hate me for going after her? I didn&rsquo;t know about you and Terry, I just thought you were a shitty husband, and I wanted to treat her better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is precisely why I don\u2019t hate you!\u201d I said, emphatically. \u201cAt first I was angry, oh fuck was I angry! I wanted to ruin you and your career, to be honest, so you can thank Terry for stopping me, \u2018cause I nearly did it. But once I remembered that you didn\u2019t go to that little hotel rendez-vous alone, and once Terry reminded me that I all but pushed Layla into looking for love and affection somewhere else, I saw sense. You pursued her, but she\u2019s told me she didn\u2019t exactly put up a fight, quite the opposite.\u201d</p><p>Harry avoided my eyes at the mention of his hotel trysts with Layla, realising that I probably knew everything about their affair. Which, other than the gory details I didn\u2019t need to know, I did. I knew about him coming to the house after we\u2019d all played golf, I knew about him being at the restaurant the night I\u2019d made Layla cry, I knew about them spending her birthday together, and I knew about him asking her to leave me. He looked ashamed, but I\u2019d long since stopped being angry about any betrayal I might have felt from Harry\u2019s actions. He\u2019d said it himself, I was a shitty husband, and he had treated her better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming this very forgiving outlook came after you punched me in the face?\u201d He asked, not without humour, giving me hope of a truce.</p><p>\u201cHarry, that night when I punched you, which I apologise profusely for, and which I regretted the moment it happened, I saw you two together and I was jealous. Of course, I now know the fragility of your relationship at that time, but i only saw the united front you put on, and I only saw that Layla was getting to be with the person she\u2019d kept a secret, while I was still trapped.\u201d</p><p>Harry let out a sigh, and shook his head like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders and was exhausted from carrying it. &ldquo;There wasn\u2019t a united front, Will, I\u2019d already ruined everything. You just made the inevitable happen sooner.&rdquo;</p><p>I chuckled, and he looked at me. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s funny, Layla said the same thing.\u201d Harry put his head in his hands, as though Layla agreeing with him made him lose all hope that she\u2019d ever forgive him. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d I asked. \u201cReally, really love her?\u201d</p><p>Lifting his head to look me in the eye, he answered firmly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want her back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I want her back. More than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, why now? You\u2019re about to go on two tours, hardly the best environment for you both, considering there were trust issues,\u201d I paused, hoping I wasn\u2019t about to undo my hard work, \u201cand, I thought I read that you were dating someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it-it didn\u2019t work out,\u201d he said, shaking his head and looking down, sadly. He was quiet for a moment, deep in thought. \u201cSome of why is\u2026 it\u2019s a bit personal. I\u2019ve lost some really important people, and I\u2019m sure you understand that life is too short to not at least try to be with the person you\u2019re in love with. But also, seeing that magazine article stirred up a lot. I\u2019ve never really gotten over her. I\u2019ve dated other people, tried to move on and get on with my life, but it\u2019s been hard. It got a little easier after my sister, Gemma, spoke to Layla and told me she was happy without me, but I still think about her all the time.\u201d Harry laughed, and I could see him blushing a little, \u201cIt\u2019s really strange talking to you about her.\u201d</p><p>I joined in with his laughter, feeling some of the tension breaking as I nodded heartily in agreement, \u201cIt\u2019s strange hearing it, if truth be told, but all I really need to know is if you\u2019re really ready? Layla is ready to settle down again, not that she\u2019s racing up the aisle or picking paint for a nursery, the business is her main priority, but she\u2019s getting there.\u201d It was my turn to turn bashful, and a little sad. \u201cOnce upon a time, we had our own plans for the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. I made sure of that before coming to see you. I\u2019m not really comfortable divulging my deepest feelings for your ex-wife to you, but I want to be with her. I never, ever, want to hurt her again.\u201d A smile played on his lips as he thought about it, as he pictured a life with Layla, \u201cLife is going to be hectic for me, but it\u2019s always going to be like that. There\u2019ll never be a right time, so I want to try before it\u2019s too late, before she marries someone else.\u201d</p><p>The boardroom door opening suddenly startled us both, and I twisted in my seat to see Maggie grimacing, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know what I said, but Joel just turned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit! Okay, thanks, Mags, just don\u2019t let him anywhere near here.\u201d</p><p>Maggie nodded, then disappeared. When I turned back to Harry, he seemed to be a lot more relaxed than he had been at the beginning of the meeting.</p><p>\u201cDifficult client?\u201d He asked with a cheeky smile.</p><p>I shook my head and let my shoulders sag. I\u2019d wanted to break the news to Harry once I knew he was serious about being ready to be with Layla, but I knew he would only think I had been trying to keep things from him.</p><p>\u201cWorse,\u201d I answered. \u201cHe\u2019s Layla\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d</p>",

That\u2019s what the magazine article said her name was. It didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019d know her face anywhere, or that Rose was also pictured with her, the name change confused me, and I couldn\u2019t believe I was seeing Layla\u2019s face after so long.

Her hair was shorter, loose, blonde waves resting on her shoulders, she smiled at the camera just enough to make the dimples in her cheeks visible, and I could see a confidence I hadn\u2019t really seen in her before. But it was her - it was my Layla.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Seeing her in a magazine had thrown me. I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself or my emotions. A lot of my exes were regularly in the media, and I\u2019d grown used to seeing someone I\u2019d been intimate with as I read the newspaper and its accompanying supplements over my cornflakes, but I had never expected to see her. She looked\u2026beautiful.</p><p>I sat back down and took a deep breath to calm myself. Grabbing my phone, I took a photo of the article and sent it to Jeff. I knew he\u2019d probably start worrying that I was about to spiral again, but I felt excitement at seeing her more than upset or pain, and I had to tell someone about it.</p><p>He was quick to reply, though it was late in LA.</p><p><b>Jeff</b><br><i>You ok?</i></p><p><b>Harry</b><br><i>I\u2019m good, man. Can we sort out sending some flowers to their office? To say congrats on the article?</i></p><p>Jeff started to type, then stopped, then started again. Even when we weren\u2019t in the same place, I could tell he was reluctant to indulge me when it came to Layla. I could practically hear him muttering to himself \u201chere we go again.\u201d</p><p><b>Jeff</b><br><i>Yeah, no worries.</i><br><i>Are you sure you want to?</i></p><p>I had to. She\u2019d sent me roses - pink, like I always sent her - to congratulate and wish me luck when \u2018Sign of the Times\u2019 came out. I had kept the card that came with the flowers with me at all times, hidden away under my phone case. There\u2019d been no name inside but I\u2019d known it was from her, and I wanted to return the gesture.</p><p><b>Harry</b><br><i>Yes. Baby pink roses, but don\u2019t say they\u2019re from me. Thanks! </i><br><i>Go to sleep!</i></p><p><b>Jeff</b><br><i>Ok, I\u2019ll sort it out in the morning.</i></p><p>Setting my phone back down on the table, I looked at Layla\u2019s face again. I missed her so much, and all the feelings I\u2019d spent three years learning to push down came flooding back, a huge wave of love, and an aching absence for the one who got away. Long since forgotten memories bubbled up to the surface, along with the things that I loved about her, things that frustrated me, and things she did that she probably didn\u2019t realise made me adore her.</p><p>I was struck by the memory of when I knew I was falling in love with her. I\u2019d already suspected it was happening, and I\u2019d tried to brush it off as just infatuation for someone I couldn\u2019t have, but seeing Layla crying that night in the restaurant changed everything. I knew then that we were more than just two people who\u2019d had a throwaway fling. I was worried for her, and I wanted nothing more than to protect her from whatever Will had said or done to upset her. When I\u2019d tried to go over, she\u2019d shook her head, worried that I\u2019d only make things worse. So, all I could do was watch as Will practically dragged her from their table, and watch as she gave me a quick glance over her shoulder, her face fraught with fear and misery over what was possibly going to happen when they were alone. The expression on her face had haunted me, so much so that I\u2019d invited Will and Terry to our movie premiere just so she would be there too. I\u2019d sent her a message to tell her I really wanted her to be there, and she\u2019d sent a short reply agreeing. I just wanted to make sure she was okay, and even if we didn\u2019t rekindle our affair, I\u2019d at least know that everything was alright.</p><p>When I saw Terry\u2019s daughter, Mia, instead of Layla, I\u2019d thought she\u2019d come in her place, and I was disappointed that she had changed her mind. Any other time I would have just casually asked Will where she was, but I had found saying anything other than a quick hello to him too difficult, so I\u2019d tried to just enjoy the night. So, my heart had skipped a beat when I\u2019d been in the hotel bar talking to Alice, and I\u2019d looked up to see Layla stood in the doorway, dressed in black like she was was attending a funeral, and looking at me with what almost looked like jealousy.</p><p>I talked her into meeting me in a room upstairs, which I\u2019d requested specifically so we would have somewhere to talk alone. She\u2019d sat on the edge of the bed, with her shapely legs crossed, and a passive smile on her red lips, and told me that her crying had been because she\u2019d been tired and emotional from her holiday. I\u2019d known she was lying, but as I joined her on the bed, I\u2019d had no choice but to accept her insistence that there was nothing wrong, that she\u2019d made it all seem worse than it actually was. And then, when she tried to leave, I stopped her, and I told her I missed her. As soon as we kissed again, I knew that I couldn\u2019t walk away from her easily. I wanted her, I needed her, and although she tried to fight it, I knew Layla felt the same.</p><p>I was downstairs when the penny dropped. After we\u2019d arranged to spend more than one night together, after I\u2019d joined her while she sat alone waiting for her husband to appear, after I\u2019d introduced her to my mother, and after I\u2019d read the horrible message Will had sent her saying he\u2019d already left - confirming what I\u2019d suspected, that Layla\u2019s insistence that the restaurant incident had just been a one off was really her refusal to show me anything but perfection, after all of that, as we shared a public goodbye in the hotel foyer, hugging and touching as much as we could without arousing suspicion, I finally realised that I was falling head over heels in love with Layla French. The way she smiled and rolled her eyes at my flirtatious comments. The sweet, lingering smell of her perfume, and how she leaned against me when we hugged, and all the other million things that made not asking her to stay almost impossible. I watched her walk away to get her ride home, and I accepted how I felt. I wanted to leave with her, or better still, wanted her to stay so she could meet all my friends and family. The ache of her leaving made me breathless, and sense told me things had gone too far, but the realisation came too late - I was already counting down the days until we were together again.</p><p>The next morning, as I nursed my hangover, I tried to get back some control, pretended like two nights together would probably drive us both mad with boredom or irritation. But then when we were together, and I\u2019d overheard her telling her friend, Rose, that she was excited about her birthday celebrations (and that of course Will had forgotten to get her anything like it was an in-joke), I cast aside all control. She deserved the world, and I wanted to give it to her.</p><p>Remembering how beautiful she\u2019d looked as she smelled the pink roses, which I\u2019d now come to associate with her, made my chest ache.</p><p>With an urgent need of distraction before I was swallowed up by emotion, I switched my focus back to the magazine. The article itself was about female owned businesses and the women who ran them. Layla and Rose had started their own event planning company, aptly named 'Layla-Rose Events\u2019, and in the short time it had been up and running, it was going from strength to strength. They talked about how they got started, how they\u2019d both put everything they had into it, and how exciting it had been moving into their new office in Shoreditch. It then went on to list some of the famous people they\u2019d planned for. I had friends who\u2019d been to their parties, and they all commented on how well run the events were, and how everything was catered for. I\u2019d casually ask how it was, out of interest, mentioning that I knew the owners, and taking a rare opportunity \u00a0to say her name without being met with a look of worry or derision. Invitations would frequently arrive for me, but because I knew full well that they were at the request of the client, and not because Layla wanted me there, the instruction was given to always politely decline unless told otherwise. The days where I turned up somewhere she didn\u2019t want me to just to get her attention were long gone.</p><p>I read the article over three times in a row, trying to remember her voice and how the words she was quoted as saying would sound coming from her mouth. There wasn\u2019t enough information, and I felt frustration stir in my belly every time I read that she was now friends with Will and Terry. So much so, in fact, that they\u2019d helped the two women find some of their earlier clients, and also let them use some of their office space when it was just a two person operation.</p><p>Will. Of all the people Layla could forgive and allow to be a part of her life, she had chosen Will. I\u2019d been baffled enough by Terry\u2019s appearance the last time I\u2019d ended up on Lil\u2019s doorstep, begging to be heard, but at least he\u2019d always been her supporter. Will, on the other hand, had only ever bullied, berated, and lied to her. Sat alone in my kitchen, with only a chance discovery of an interview in a magazine to tell me what was going on in her life, the frustration and bitterness grew until I had to get up and walk away. I\u2019d come to terms with Layla and I breaking up, and how it had been of my own doing, but I just could not understand how -in comparison to Will- I deserved total exile.</p><p>Safely away from the picture of Layla\u2019s happy, smiling face, the anxiety brought on by how unfair it all felt began to settle. Taking deep and steady breaths, I reminded myself that the decision was not mine to make, and I had to accept that she didn\u2019t want me to be a part of her life. She had made her own happiness; she had her own business, she had Rose, and she had all the other people around her that she wanted, and that made her happy. I also had my career and my impending tour, I had the beginnings of a new relationship that was making me happy in a way I hadn\u2019t really felt since Layla, and I had my own group of people who loved and supported me.</p><p>We had both moved on.</p><p>Or rather, Layla had made her decision, and I had no choice but to go along with it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d7daca174232653332b6d144920fa6d/tumblr_inline_pjaa63DFdd1w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"></figure><p><b>2017 - August</b></p><p>In one of the toughest weeks of my life, two things happened that I never imagined would; the first being my mother, Verity, in the final hours of her life, telling me that she hoped Terry and I were going to have a long and happy life together. And the second was when Harry Styles called to arrange a meeting with Terry and I about us working on his second tour. I wasn\u2019t sure which of the two shocked me more.</p><p>Harry\u2019s call came the day after my mother had passed away, and I was hiding away in my office, hoping that if I pretended to work for long enough that it would distract me from my grief. I gave instructions to Maggie at reception that anyone who called was to be told I was out of office and I would get back to them, or they were to be put through to someone else who could help. But, when Maggie poked her head around the door with a strange look on her face, and said that Harry Styles was on the line, asking to speak to me only, I made an exception.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I tried my best to sound friendly, hoping that he wouldn\u2019t hear the confusion in my voice.</p><p>\u201cHello, Will, it\u2019s Harry.\u201d His deep voice sounded wary, as though he was unsure if calling was a good idea. I imagined that he wasn\u2019t exactly overjoyed at the prospect of being in a room with me, seeing as the last time we were I\u2019d punched him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to hear from you, Harry, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Harry explained that he would be going on a small venue tour that would start at the end of September and would end in early December. He would then be going on a larger, arena tour in mid-March, and he was hoping our company would be interested in working with him.</p><p>For a moment I was stunned silent. The week already had a dream-like quality to it, and Harry wanting to possibly work together only added to that fact. Eventually, I managed to find a reply. \u201cYes, of course, we\u2019d love to work with you again, Harry! When would you like to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould next Wednesday be okay?\u201d Harry asked, thankfully not suggesting the day I\u2019d just arranged to have my mother\u2019s funeral. \u201cAt three?</p><p>\u201cI have an appointment at twelve, but I will be done by three, so that all sounds good to me. It\u2019ll be nice to see you again after so long.\u201d</p><p>He hummed dubiously, and then we both fell into an awkward silence. We could have said goodbye then, hung up, and gone on our merry way, but neither of us said anything. I wanted to give him the time to ask the question I was suspecting he was waiting to ask. However, it never came. Instead, he suddenly said he had to go because of another call, and quickly hung up.</p><p>Shaking my head in disbelief, I sat back in my chair, and after realising I\u2019d practically held my breath for the entirety of the phone call, I exhaled. While I sent Terry a message to come see me when he was free, I couldn\u2019t help but think there had to be some sort of ulterior motive. I was glad of the chance to have Harry\u2019s business, and despite what was going on quite literally behind the scenes, he had always been pleasant to work with. But, I couldn\u2019t for a second let myself think that his request to meet wasn\u2019t some sort of ploy. We had a rocky history, and I was never going to be the top of his list unless he could get something out of it. Something that couldn\u2019t just be said on the phone. Something that no doubt also involved my ex-wife.</p><p>Terry and I agreed that Layla didn\u2019t need to know about the meeting with Harry unless it was absolutely necessary. She was happy, and I liked seeing her that way, so there wasn\u2019t any point in stirring up old feelings over a meeting that might not lead anywhere. It also meant that Joel, Layla\u2019s boyfriend of over a year, and our resource manager, would need to be included on the need to know basis list. I found a supplier I needed him to go see, so he wouldn\u2019t be in the building, and only Terry, Maggie, and I knew that Harry would be visiting.</p><p>Before my meeting with Harry, I had one on Park Lane with my mother\u2019s solicitor to discuss the reading of her will, and all the boring admin sides of losing a loved one. I was the sole heir of her inheritance, but things had been so frosty and unfriendly between us since I finally told her I was with Terry that I half expected to find out she\u2019d followed through with her threats and donated everything to a donkey sanctuary. But, other than a few pieces of jewelry that she\u2019d strangely left Lil, and some money which she did want donated to a donkey sanctuary, all my mother\u2019s estate fell directly to me. The son who\u2019d disappointed her, repeatedly.</p><p>The meeting itself was short, but the traffic back to the office was slow moving and long, so by the time I finally parked my car in the usual spot, I was already fifteen minutes late.</p><p>\u201cAre they here?\u201d I asked Maggie as I burst through the glass doors into our building.</p><p>Maggie nodded and rushed from behind the reception desk. \u201cDon\u2019t go in there looking like that though! You look ready to kill someone.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands on my shoulders and made me take a few deep breaths until I was calmer.</p><p>\u201cTraffic was a nightmare the whole way here. I forgot why I stopped dr-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re here now, and Terry has everything under control. Harry has his manager, Jeff, with him, and I\u2019ve already taken in coffee while they waited for you. I\u2019ve also checked and there isn\u2019t any chance of Joel or Layla making a surprise appearance. Now! Get in there and do what you do best!\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, I let my shoulders relax and thanked my lucky stars that at least one of us was confident I could face Harry again. \u201cThank you, Mags. What would we do without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe building would collapse around your ears, William. I\u2019m like the ravens at the Tower of London, you\u2019re all doomed when I leave.\u201d</p><p>Nerves made an appearance as I approached the meeting room, and I wondered if Terry would kill me if I just went and hid in my office until Harry and his manager were gone. The reality of losing my mother had started to kick in as I\u2019d listened to her final wishes, and both Harry and I knew full well that I didn\u2019t handle things the best when my emotions were running high.</p><p>But, then I remembered that was the point! Harry had his ulterior motive, and so did I. I wanted to, at the very least, make amends and apologise for my behaviour the last time we were in a room together, which I\u2019d been too cowardly to do before now. After I\u2019d thrown the punch, I\u2019d left Layla\u2019s house, and was too scared to face what I had done. Terry took over all of One Direction\u2019s requests and meetings, and I\u2019d hidden away in shame. This opportunity was mine for the taking, I could show Harry that I wasn\u2019t who I\u2019d once been, and that I had changed for the better.</p><p>Pushing the door open, I entered the room, and all three men turned to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry for keeping you!\u201d I smiled, ignoring the glare I was getting from Harry\u2019s manager as I shook his hand, \u201cI think I got caught in every conceivable bit of traffic on my way here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just saying that driving around London is a nightmare this time of day!\u201d Terry laughed, backing me up as we exchanged glances that told me he\u2019d been working a tough crowd.</p><p>The already tense room became even more so as Harry and I came face to face. I felt both Terry and Jeff ready themselves in case one of us erupted into a fight, but looking at Harry - the man who\u2019d had an affair with my wife - I felt nothing but an odd sense of affection. Layla, on the rare occasion she spoke of Harry, had said the same thing - he had given her the confidence to leave me, and although I\u2019d been angry and bitter at the time, it led to my finally having the wonderful, happy life I had with Terry. The huge guilt I felt was because, maybe, I\u2019d ruined Layla\u2019s chance at that same happiness.</p><p>When I shook Harry\u2019s hand, I made sure to look him in the eye in hope that he would know how warm and genuine my words were, and that I held no grudges against him. I only hoped he felt the same. \u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you again, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you too.\u201d He muttered, giving me a tight-lipped smile before sitting back down and taking a sip of his black coffee.</p><p>Walking around the large, rectangle table, I went to sit next to Terry, who squeezed my knee and gave me an encouraging wink. The gesture, though small, reminded me that I was not alone. My husband-to-be was at my side, reminding me that Harry was the last piece of the puzzle I had left to mend.</p><p>With renewed determination, I reached for the folder that contained the company\u2019s proposal for Harry\u2019s tour, opened it, and fixed a smile on my face. \u201cSo! You\u2019re going on tour then, Harry?\u201d</p><p>Terry had been excited to plan Harry\u2019s set, choosing to work on most of the designs himself. It took Harry by surprise when we told him that we were big fans of his album, especially when I confessed that we\u2019d already had a lot of ideas in place for his set, because Terry and I would listen to albums we loved in the car and plan fantasy sets for them. His album had been in our car for at least a month after its release, so we\u2019d planned a tour for it on many a journey to and from work.</p><p>The general idea was for it to be similar in simplicity to the designs Terry and my father had started off with in the seventies, but with all the wonders of modern technology. We wanted Harry\u2019s album, and his incredible stage presence, to speak for itself, whilst also having a setup that would use some of the beautiful visuals that had been created for the album.</p><p>To our relief, Harry and his manager seemed to like what we had in mind, nodding along as I ran through our ideas for each song on the rough setlist we\u2019d been sent.</p><p>\u201cBut, of course, Harry, it\u2019s entirely up to you, and we\u2019re open to anything you want to do to represent your work,\u201d Terry said, as our presentation drew to a close. \u201cHowever, as you both know, the sooner we get started the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Harry answered, glancing at Jeff before leaning in to look at the sketches. \u201cIt\u2019s not too far from what I was picturing.\u201d</p><p>Jeff, who was a little keener to keep his cards close to his chest, nodded in agreement, then quickly added, \u201cwe have another meeting tomorrow, and then we\u2019ll let you know. I\u2019m guessing the circular screen will take the longest to manufacture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the company we use is quick to get the ball rolling, so it\u2019ll actually be quicker than one would imagine. It\u2019s checking the mechanics that make it move, which slow down the process.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied with Terry\u2019s answer, the two young men looked at each other and fell silent.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity, I looked at Harry and asked, \u201cwas there anything else you needed to know?\u201d</p><p>Everything felt tense again, as I handed him a platform to get whatever he had come to say off his chest. As his gaze met mine, I could see the words fighting to be said, but his lips betrayed him by staying clamped shut in a tight, thin line.</p><p>It was Jeff who surprised us all by asking, \u201cHow\u2019s Layla?\u201d Harry slowly turned to look at him, and Jeff shrugged, \u201cH, if I waited for you to ask, we\u2019d be here all day.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I was relieved someone had said what I was waiting for. Harry had wanted to ask, but he didn\u2019t trust me, and he was well within his rights not to. However, I hoped that when I answered, he would know that I was grateful every day for having my ex-wife\u2019s forgiveness when I really wasn\u2019t deserving of it. I also wanted to help him get it too.</p><p>\u201cLayla is doing really well. Her and Rose are working their socks off to make the business a success, and she\u2019s the happiest I\u2019ve seen her in a long time. You should go to one of her events, Harry, you\u2019d be incredibly proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill\u2026\u201d Terry groaned, covering his face with his hand, making me realise that what I\u2019d said had sounded much better in my head. I\u2019d wanted to encourage Harry to make his move, but it had come across like I was gloating.</p><p>Harry sat up in his seat and leaned forward, resting both elbows on the table. Voice measured and restrained, he said, \u201cI think you know why I haven\u2019t been, Will. She doesn\u2019t want me there.\u201d</p><p>Clearing his throat, Terry suddenly stood up and clapped his hands together. \u201cJeff! Why don\u2019t I give you a tour of the building? Show you some of the mock ups for some of the old sets we\u2019ve done, I keep them all.\u201d</p><p>Jeff looked at Harry for the okay, and Harry nodded and muttered it was fine. We waited for them to leave, Terry whispering to me, as he passed, to remember that I didn\u2019t want to fight Harry, I wanted to help him.</p><p>As soon as the door closed, I sighed, \u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s not how I meant that to come across.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Harry replied, somewhat dubiously. \u201cOkay, yeah, as I\u2019m sure you know, I struggled with her decision at first, but I\u2019ve accepted it.\u201d He then added with a hint of bitterness, \u201cShe chose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you aren\u2019t here because you want me to help you get back in touch with her, then?\u201d I chose to gloss over his comment about me having won. I hadn\u2019t won, Lil hadn\u2019t chose me. It had merely been luck that Terry loved us both enough to help us work past the hurt we\u2019d caused each other. I knew full well that had he not been around, I\u2019d have been out of Layla\u2019s life, and wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to grow a friendship where there had once only been hate and bitterness.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I need you to help me? I saw that article, I know where her office is.\u201d Defiant, Harry sat back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Harry, you tell me why.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked away, reluctant to admit that I was right. Getting up from my seat, I went and sat in the one next to him that Jeff had recently vacated, turning it so I could look at him. \u201cListen, I know we have a\u2026 difficult history, and I understand why you\u2019re reluctant to trust me. But, believe it or not, I am on your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifficult? That\u2019s a bit of an understatement,\u201d Harry scoffed. Turning so we were face to face, he asked, \u201cWhy? Why are you suddenly on my side? You said L\u2026 You said Layla\u2019s happy, why would you help me when you know she doesn\u2019t want me?\u201d</p><p>The pause before he said her name was excruciating, and it told me everything I needed to know about him since Layla had cut him out. I\u2019d heard the songs on his album, heard the pain of someone who\u2019d had their heart broken almost beyond repair, but he was an artist, and embellishment was a tool of the trade. Harry being unable to say her name, without some sort of mental run and jump over the wall he\u2019d built, was evidence that there hadn\u2019t been much embellishment at all.</p><p>But first, I had to address my own issues. Taking a deep breath, I remembered all the things I\u2019d worked on in my therapy sessions, accepted that Harry might not forgive me the way others had, and reminded myself that I had changed. I wasn\u2019t the Will that Harry had once known.</p><p>\u201cI am not the same person as I was back then. I was a horrible man, one who was so caught up in a lie that I\u2019d brought upon myself that I lashed out at the people around me for no other reason than I felt trapped. Layla bore the biggest brunt of that, but even when she found out about Terry and I, she was never malicious. She was sympathetic even, she told us that had I been honest from the start, she would have probably helped us keep our secret. She had the perfect chance to expose me, and get me back for the horrid way I treated her when she came with me to tell my mother about the divorce. She could have told her then, but she sat quietly as she was called a whore and a gold-digger, and she kept my secret.\u201d Chuckling, I tried to lighten the mood, but Harry remained unimpressed, \u201cShe also came with Terry and I when I finally told my mother about us being together, but I think that time was less for support and more for the enjoyment of seeing my mother hit the roof.\u201d<br>\u201cI already knew you were a shitty person, Will, and I\u2019m sorry you felt like you had no choice, but it doesn\u2019t excuse what you did to her, the way you spoke about her to me when you were trying to be \u2018one of the lads\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Harry, and that\u2019s why I want to help you.\u201d Putting my hand on my heart, I tilted my head back and closed my eyes. I spoke to Harry, but I also spoke to the universe, repeating the promises I\u2019d already made to Layla and Terry - they were my highest priorities in life, and I would stop at nothing to see them happy. \u201cNothing I ever do will make up for my behaviour, but I love her, and I want her to have the happy life she thought she was going to have with me. She deserves it, after everything she\u2019s been through.\u201d</p><p>Though not entirely convinced, Harry seemed to accept my answer as genuine. But, he was impatient and waiting for the catch, for the moment I put on my fake moustache and cackled malevolently that I\u2019d tricked him and had no plans to help, for the moment that I was going to tell Layla, and we would both laugh at how pathetic he was.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about our affair? Don\u2019t you hate me for going after her? I didn\u2019t know about you and Terry, I just thought you were a shitty husband, and I wanted to treat her better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is precisely why I don\u2019t hate you!\u201d I said, emphatically. \u201cAt first I was angry, oh fuck was I angry! I wanted to ruin you and your career, to be honest, so you can thank Terry for stopping me, \u2018cause I nearly did it. But once I remembered that you didn\u2019t go to that little hotel rendez-vous alone, and once Terry reminded me that I all but pushed Layla into looking for love and affection somewhere else, I saw sense. You pursued her, but she\u2019s told me she didn\u2019t exactly put up a fight, quite the opposite.\u201d</p><p>Harry avoided my eyes at the mention of his hotel trysts with Layla, realising that I probably knew everything about their affair. Which, other than the gory details I didn\u2019t need to know, I did. I knew about him coming to the house after we\u2019d all played golf, I knew about him being at the restaurant the night I\u2019d made Layla cry, I knew about them spending her birthday together, and I knew about him asking her to leave me. He looked ashamed, but I\u2019d long since stopped being angry about any betrayal I might have felt from Harry\u2019s actions. He\u2019d said it himself, I was a shitty husband, and he had treated her better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming this very forgiving outlook came after you punched me in the face?\u201d He asked, not without humour, giving me hope of a truce.</p><p>\u201cHarry, that night when I punched you, which I apologise profusely for, and which I regretted the moment it happened, I saw you two together and I was jealous. Of course, I now know the fragility of your relationship at that time, but i only saw the united front you put on, and I only saw that Layla was getting to be with the person she\u2019d kept a secret, while I was still trapped.\u201d</p><p>Harry let out a sigh, and shook his head like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders and was exhausted from carrying it. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a united front, Will, I\u2019d already ruined everything. You just made the inevitable happen sooner.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled, and he looked at me. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s funny, Layla said the same thing.\u201d Harry put his head in his hands, as though Layla agreeing with him made him lose all hope that she\u2019d ever forgive him. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d I asked. \u201cReally, really love her?\u201d</p><p>Lifting his head to look me in the eye, he answered firmly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want her back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I want her back. More than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, why now? You\u2019re about to go on two tours, hardly the best environment for you both, considering there were trust issues,\u201d I paused, hoping I wasn\u2019t about to undo my hard work, \u201cand, I thought I read that you were dating someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it-it didn\u2019t work out,\u201d he said, shaking his head and looking down, sadly. He was quiet for a moment, deep in thought. \u201cSome of why is\u2026 it\u2019s a bit personal. I\u2019ve lost some really important people, and I\u2019m sure you understand that life is too short to not at least try to be with the person you\u2019re in love with. But also, seeing that magazine article stirred up a lot. I\u2019ve never really gotten over her. I\u2019ve dated other people, tried to move on and get on with my life, but it\u2019s been hard. It got a little easier after my sister, Gemma, spoke to Layla and told me she was happy without me, but I still think about her all the time.\u201d Harry laughed, and I could see him blushing a little, \u201cIt\u2019s really strange talking to you about her.\u201d</p><p>I joined in with his laughter, feeling some of the tension breaking as I nodded heartily in agreement, \u201cIt\u2019s strange hearing it, if truth be told, but all I really need to know is if you\u2019re really ready? Layla is ready to settle down again, not that she\u2019s racing up the aisle or picking paint for a nursery, the business is her main priority, but she\u2019s getting there.\u201d It was my turn to turn bashful, and a little sad. \u201cOnce upon a time, we had our own plans for the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. I made sure of that before coming to see you. I\u2019m not really comfortable divulging my deepest feelings for your ex-wife to you, but I want to be with her. I never, ever, want to hurt her again.\u201d A smile played on his lips as he thought about it, as he pictured a life with Layla, \u201cLife is going to be hectic for me, but it\u2019s always going to be like that. There\u2019ll never be a right time, so I want to try before it\u2019s too late, before she marries someone else.\u201d</p><p>The boardroom door opening suddenly startled us both, and I twisted in my seat to see Maggie grimacing, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know what I said, but Joel just turned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit! Okay, thanks, Mags, just don\u2019t let him anywhere near here.\u201d</p><p>Maggie nodded, then disappeared. When I turned back to Harry, he seemed to be a lot more relaxed than he had been at the beginning of the meeting.</p><p>\u201cDifficult client?\u201d He asked with a cheeky smile.</p><p>I shook my head and let my shoulders sag. I\u2019d wanted to break the news to Harry once I knew he was serious about being ready to be with Layla, but I knew he would only think I had been trying to keep things from him.</p><p>\u201cWorse,\u201d I answered. \u201cHe\u2019s Layla\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d</p>",

That\u2019s what the magazine article said her name was. It didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019d know her face anywhere, or that Rose was also pictured with her, the name change confused me, and I couldn\u2019t believe I was seeing Layla\u2019s face after so long. Standing up for no reason other than needing to feel like I was doing something, I stared at her photo to make sure I wasn\u2019t seeing things. Her hair was shorter, loose, blonde waves resting on her shoulders, she smiled at the camera just enough to make the dimples in her cheeks visible, and I could see a confidence I hadn\u2019t really seen in her before. But it was her - it was my Layla.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Seeing her in a magazine had thrown me. I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself or my emotions. A lot of my exes were regularly in the media, and I\u2019d grown used to seeing someone I\u2019d been intimate with as I read the newspaper and its accompanying supplements over my cornflakes, but I had never expected to see her. She looked\u2026beautiful.</p><p>I sat back down and took a deep breath to calm myself. Grabbing my phone, I took a photo of the article and sent it to Jeff. I knew he\u2019d probably start worrying that I was about to spiral again, but I felt excitement at seeing her more than upset or pain, and I had to tell someone about it.</p><p>He was quick to reply, though it was late in LA.</p><p><b>Jeff</b><br><i>You ok?</i></p><p><b>Harry</b><br><i>I\u2019m good, man. Can we sort out sending some flowers to their office? To say congrats on the article?</i></p><p>Jeff started to type, then stopped, then started again. Even when we weren\u2019t in the same place, I could tell he was reluctant to indulge me when it came to Layla. I could practically hear him muttering to himself \u201chere we go again.\u201d</p><p><b>Jeff</b><br><i>Yeah, no worries.</i><br><i>Are you sure you want to?</i></p><p>I had to. She\u2019d sent me roses - pink, like I always sent her - to congratulate and wish me luck when \u2018Sign of the Times\u2019 came out. I had kept the card that came with the flowers with me at all times, hidden away under my phone case. There\u2019d been no name inside but I\u2019d known it was from her, and I wanted to return the gesture.</p><p><b>Harry</b><br><i>Yes. Baby pink roses, but don\u2019t say they\u2019re from me. Thanks! </i><br><i>Go to sleep!</i></p><p><b>Jeff</b><br><i>Ok, I\u2019ll sort it out in the morning.</i></p><p>Setting my phone back down on the table, I looked at Layla\u2019s face again. I missed her so much, and all the feelings I\u2019d spent three years learning to push down came flooding back, a huge wave of love, and an aching absence for the one who got away. Long since forgotten memories bubbled up to the surface, along with the things that I loved about her, things that frustrated me, and things she did that she probably didn\u2019t realise made me adore her.</p><p>I was struck by the memory of when I knew I was falling in love with her. I\u2019d already suspected it was happening, and I\u2019d tried to brush it off as just infatuation for someone I couldn\u2019t have, but seeing Layla crying that night in the restaurant changed everything. I knew then that we were more than just two people who\u2019d had a throwaway fling. I was worried for her, and I wanted nothing more than to protect her from whatever Will had said or done to upset her. When I\u2019d tried to go over, she\u2019d shook her head, worried that I\u2019d only make things worse. So, all I could do was watch as Will practically dragged her from their table, and watch as she gave me a quick glance over her shoulder, her face fraught with fear and misery over what was possibly going to happen when they were alone. The expression on her face had haunted me, so much so that I\u2019d invited Will and Terry to our movie premiere just so she would be there too. I\u2019d sent her a message to tell her I really wanted her to be there, and she\u2019d sent a short reply agreeing. I just wanted to make sure she was okay, and even if we didn\u2019t rekindle our affair, I\u2019d at least know that everything was alright.</p><p>When I saw Terry\u2019s daughter, Mia, instead of Layla, I\u2019d thought she\u2019d come in her place, and I was disappointed that she had changed her mind. Any other time I would have just casually asked Will where she was, but I had found saying anything other than a quick hello to him too difficult, so I\u2019d tried to just enjoy the night. So, my heart had skipped a beat when I\u2019d been in the hotel bar talking to Alice, and I\u2019d looked up to see Layla stood in the doorway, dressed in black like she was was attending a funeral, and looking at me with what almost looked like jealousy.</p><p>I talked her into meeting me in a room upstairs, which I\u2019d requested specifically so we would have somewhere to talk alone. She\u2019d sat on the edge of the bed, with her shapely legs crossed, and a passive smile on her red lips, and told me that her crying had been because she\u2019d been tired and emotional from her holiday. I\u2019d known she was lying, but as I joined her on the bed, I\u2019d had no choice but to accept her insistence that there was nothing wrong, that she\u2019d made it all seem worse than it actually was. And then, when she tried to leave, I stopped her, and I told her I missed her. As soon as we kissed again, I knew that I couldn\u2019t walk away from her easily. I wanted her, I needed her, and although she tried to fight it, I knew Layla felt the same.</p><p>I was downstairs when the penny dropped. After we\u2019d arranged to spend more than one night together, after I\u2019d joined her while she sat alone waiting for her husband to appear, after I\u2019d introduced her to my mother, and after I\u2019d read the horrible message Will had sent her saying he\u2019d already left - confirming what I\u2019d suspected, that Layla\u2019s insistence that the restaurant incident had just been a one off was really her refusal to show me anything but perfection, after all of that, as we shared a public goodbye in the hotel foyer, hugging and touching as much as we could without arousing suspicion, I finally realised that I was falling head over heels in love with Layla French. The way she smiled and rolled her eyes at my flirtatious comments. The sweet, lingering smell of her perfume, and how she leaned against me when we hugged, and all the other million things that made not asking her to stay almost impossible. I watched her walk away to get her ride home, and I accepted how I felt. I wanted to leave with her, or better still, wanted her to stay so she could meet all my friends and family. The ache of her leaving made me breathless, and sense told me things had gone too far, but the realisation came too late - I was already counting down the days until we were together again.</p><p>The next morning, as I nursed my hangover, I tried to get back some control, pretended like two nights together would probably drive us both mad with boredom or irritation. But then when we were together, and I\u2019d overheard her telling her friend, Rose, that she was excited about her birthday celebrations (and that of course Will had forgotten to get her anything like it was an in-joke), I cast aside all control. She deserved the world, and I wanted to give it to her.</p><p>Remembering how beautiful she\u2019d looked as she smelled the pink roses, which I\u2019d now come to associate with her, made my chest ache.</p><p>With an urgent need of distraction before I was swallowed up by emotion, I switched my focus back to the magazine. The article itself was about female owned businesses and the women who ran them. Layla and Rose had started their own event planning company, aptly named 'Layla-Rose Events\u2019, and in the short time it had been up and running, it was going from strength to strength. They talked about how they got started, how they\u2019d both put everything they had into it, and how exciting it had been moving into their new office in Shoreditch. It then went on to list some of the famous people they\u2019d planned for. I had friends who\u2019d been to their parties, and they all commented on how well run the events were, and how everything was catered for. I\u2019d casually ask how it was, out of interest, mentioning that I knew the owners, and taking a rare opportunity \u00a0to say her name without being met with a look of worry or derision. Invitations would frequently arrive for me, but because I knew full well that they were at the request of the client, and not because Layla wanted me there, the instruction was given to always politely decline unless told otherwise. The days where I turned up somewhere she didn\u2019t want me to just to get her attention were long gone.</p><p>I read the article over three times in a row, trying to remember her voice and how the words she was quoted as saying would sound coming from her mouth. There wasn\u2019t enough information, and I felt frustration stir in my belly every time I read that she was now friends with Will and Terry. So much so, in fact, that they\u2019d helped the two women find some of their earlier clients, and also let them use some of their office space when it was just a two person operation.</p><p>Will. Of all the people Layla could forgive and allow to be a part of her life, she had chosen Will. I\u2019d been baffled enough by Terry\u2019s appearance the last time I\u2019d ended up on Lil\u2019s doorstep, begging to be heard, but at least he\u2019d always been her supporter. Will, on the other hand, had only ever bullied, berated, and lied to her. Sat alone in my kitchen, with only a chance discovery of an interview in a magazine to tell me what was going on in her life, the frustration and bitterness grew until I had to get up and walk away. I\u2019d come to terms with Layla and I breaking up, and how it had been of my own doing, but I just could not understand how -in comparison to Will- I deserved total exile.</p><p>Safely away from the picture of Layla\u2019s happy, smiling face, the anxiety brought on by how unfair it all felt began to settle. Taking deep and steady breaths, I reminded myself that the decision was not mine to make, and I had to accept that she didn\u2019t want me to be a part of her life. She had made her own happiness; she had her own business, she had Rose, and she had all the other people around her that she wanted, and that made her happy. I also had my career and my impending tour, I had the beginnings of a new relationship that was making me happy in a way I hadn\u2019t really felt since Layla, and I had my own group of people who loved and supported me.</p><p>We had both moved on.</p><p>Or rather, Layla had made her decision, and I had no choice but to go along with it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d7daca174232653332b6d144920fa6d/tumblr_inline_pjaa63DFdd1w7xqut_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"520\"></figure><p><b>2017 - August</b></p><p>In one of the toughest weeks of my life, two things happened that I never imagined would; the first being my mother, Verity, in the final hours of her life, telling me that she hoped Terry and I were going to have a long and happy life together. And the second was when Harry Styles called to arrange a meeting with Terry and I about us working on his second tour. I wasn\u2019t sure which of the two shocked me more.</p><p>Harry\u2019s call came the day after my mother had passed away, and I was hiding away in my office, hoping that if I pretended to work for long enough that it would distract me from my grief. I gave instructions to Maggie at reception that anyone who called was to be told I was out of office and I would get back to them, or they were to be put through to someone else who could help. But, when Maggie poked her head around the door with a strange look on her face, and said that Harry Styles was on the line, asking to speak to me only, I made an exception.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I tried my best to sound friendly, hoping that he wouldn\u2019t hear the confusion in my voice.</p><p>\u201cHello, Will, it\u2019s Harry.\u201d His deep voice sounded wary, as though he was unsure if calling was a good idea. I imagined that he wasn\u2019t exactly overjoyed at the prospect of being in a room with me, seeing as the last time we were I\u2019d punched him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to hear from you, Harry, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Harry explained that he would be going on a small venue tour that would start at the end of September and would end in early December. He would then be going on a larger, arena tour in mid-March, and he was hoping our company would be interested in working with him.</p><p>For a moment I was stunned silent. The week already had a dream-like quality to it, and Harry wanting to possibly work together only added to that fact. Eventually, I managed to find a reply. \u201cYes, of course, we\u2019d love to work with you again, Harry! When would you like to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould next Wednesday be okay?\u201d Harry asked, thankfully not suggesting the day I\u2019d just arranged to have my mother\u2019s funeral. \u201cAt three?</p><p>\u201cI have an appointment at twelve, but I will be done by three, so that all sounds good to me. It\u2019ll be nice to see you again after so long.\u201d</p><p>He hummed dubiously, and then we both fell into an awkward silence. We could have said goodbye then, hung up, and gone on our merry way, but neither of us said anything. I wanted to give him the time to ask the question I was suspecting he was waiting to ask. However, it never came. Instead, he suddenly said he had to go because of another call, and quickly hung up.</p><p>Shaking my head in disbelief, I sat back in my chair, and after realising I\u2019d practically held my breath for the entirety of the phone call, I exhaled. While I sent Terry a message to come see me when he was free, I couldn\u2019t help but think there had to be some sort of ulterior motive. I was glad of the chance to have Harry\u2019s business, and despite what was going on quite literally behind the scenes, he had always been pleasant to work with. But, I couldn\u2019t for a second let myself think that his request to meet wasn\u2019t some sort of ploy. We had a rocky history, and I was never going to be the top of his list unless he could get something out of it. Something that couldn\u2019t just be said on the phone. Something that no doubt also involved my ex-wife.</p><p>Terry and I agreed that Layla didn\u2019t need to know about the meeting with Harry unless it was absolutely necessary. She was happy, and I liked seeing her that way, so there wasn\u2019t any point in stirring up old feelings over a meeting that might not lead anywhere. It also meant that Joel, Layla\u2019s boyfriend of over a year, and our resource manager, would need to be included on the need to know basis list. I found a supplier I needed him to go see, so he wouldn\u2019t be in the building, and only Terry, Maggie, and I knew that Harry would be visiting.</p><p>Before my meeting with Harry, I had one on Park Lane with my mother\u2019s solicitor to discuss the reading of her will, and all the boring admin sides of losing a loved one. I was the sole heir of her inheritance, but things had been so frosty and unfriendly between us since I finally told her I was with Terry that I half expected to find out she\u2019d followed through with her threats and donated everything to a donkey sanctuary. But, other than a few pieces of jewelry that she\u2019d strangely left Lil, and some money which she did want donated to a donkey sanctuary, all my mother\u2019s estate fell directly to me. The son who\u2019d disappointed her, repeatedly.</p><p>The meeting itself was short, but the traffic back to the office was slow moving and long, so by the time I finally parked my car in the usual spot, I was already fifteen minutes late.</p><p>\u201cAre they here?\u201d I asked Maggie as I burst through the glass doors into our building.</p><p>Maggie nodded and rushed from behind the reception desk. \u201cDon\u2019t go in there looking like that though! You look ready to kill someone.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands on my shoulders and made me take a few deep breaths until I was calmer.</p><p>\u201cTraffic was a nightmare the whole way here. I forgot why I stopped dr-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re here now, and Terry has everything under control. Harry has his manager, Jeff, with him, and I\u2019ve already taken in coffee while they waited for you. I\u2019ve also checked and there isn\u2019t any chance of Joel or Layla making a surprise appearance. Now! Get in there and do what you do best!\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, I let my shoulders relax and thanked my lucky stars that at least one of us was confident I could face Harry again. \u201cThank you, Mags. What would we do without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe building would collapse around your ears, William. I\u2019m like the ravens at the Tower of London, you\u2019re all doomed when I leave.\u201d</p><p>Nerves made an appearance as I approached the meeting room, and I wondered if Terry would kill me if I just went and hid in my office until Harry and his manager were gone. The reality of losing my mother had started to kick in as I\u2019d listened to her final wishes, and both Harry and I knew full well that I didn\u2019t handle things the best when my emotions were running high.</p><p>But, then I remembered that was the point! Harry had his ulterior motive, and so did I. I wanted to, at the very least, make amends and apologise for my behaviour the last time we were in a room together, which I\u2019d been too cowardly to do before now. After I\u2019d thrown the punch, I\u2019d left Layla\u2019s house, and was too scared to face what I had done. Terry took over all of One Direction\u2019s requests and meetings, and I\u2019d hidden away in shame. This opportunity was mine for the taking, I could show Harry that I wasn\u2019t who I\u2019d once been, and that I had changed for the better.</p><p>Pushing the door open, I entered the room, and all three men turned to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry for keeping you!\u201d I smiled, ignoring the glare I was getting from Harry\u2019s manager as I shook his hand, \u201cI think I got caught in every conceivable bit of traffic on my way here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just saying that driving around London is a nightmare this time of day!\u201d Terry laughed, backing me up as we exchanged glances that told me he\u2019d been working a tough crowd.</p><p>The already tense room became even more so as Harry and I came face to face. I felt both Terry and Jeff ready themselves in case one of us erupted into a fight, but looking at Harry - the man who\u2019d had an affair with my wife - I felt nothing but an odd sense of affection. Layla, on the rare occasion she spoke of Harry, had said the same thing - he had given her the confidence to leave me, and although I\u2019d been angry and bitter at the time, it led to my finally having the wonderful, happy life I had with Terry. The huge guilt I felt was because, maybe, I\u2019d ruined Layla\u2019s chance at that same happiness.</p><p>When I shook Harry\u2019s hand, I made sure to look him in the eye in hope that he would know how warm and genuine my words were, and that I held no grudges against him. I only hoped he felt the same. \u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you again, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you too.\u201d He muttered, giving me a tight-lipped smile before sitting back down and taking a sip of his black coffee.</p><p>Walking around the large, rectangle table, I went to sit next to Terry, who squeezed my knee and gave me an encouraging wink. The gesture, though small, reminded me that I was not alone. My husband-to-be was at my side, reminding me that Harry was the last piece of the puzzle I had left to mend.</p><p>With renewed determination, I reached for the folder that contained the company\u2019s proposal for Harry\u2019s tour, opened it, and fixed a smile on my face. \u201cSo! You\u2019re going on tour then, Harry?\u201d</p><p>Terry had been excited to plan Harry\u2019s set, choosing to work on most of the designs himself. It took Harry by surprise when we told him that we were big fans of his album, especially when I confessed that we\u2019d already had a lot of ideas in place for his set, because Terry and I would listen to albums we loved in the car and plan fantasy sets for them. His album had been in our car for at least a month after its release, so we\u2019d planned a tour for it on many a journey to and from work.</p><p>The general idea was for it to be similar in simplicity to the designs Terry and my father had started off with in the seventies, but with all the wonders of modern technology. We wanted Harry\u2019s album, and his incredible stage presence, to speak for itself, whilst also having a setup that would use some of the beautiful visuals that had been created for the album.</p><p>To our relief, Harry and his manager seemed to like what we had in mind, nodding along as I ran through our ideas for each song on the rough setlist we\u2019d been sent.</p><p>\u201cBut, of course, Harry, it\u2019s entirely up to you, and we\u2019re open to anything you want to do to represent your work,\u201d Terry said, as our presentation drew to a close. \u201cHowever, as you both know, the sooner we get started the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Harry answered, glancing at Jeff before leaning in to look at the sketches. \u201cIt\u2019s not too far from what I was picturing.\u201d</p><p>Jeff, who was a little keener to keep his cards close to his chest, nodded in agreement, then quickly added, \u201cwe have another meeting tomorrow, and then we\u2019ll let you know. I\u2019m guessing the circular screen will take the longest to manufacture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the company we use is quick to get the ball rolling, so it\u2019ll actually be quicker than one would imagine. It\u2019s checking the mechanics that make it move, which slow down the process.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied with Terry\u2019s answer, the two young men looked at each other and fell silent.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity, I looked at Harry and asked, \u201cwas there anything else you needed to know?\u201d</p><p>Everything felt tense again, as I handed him a platform to get whatever he had come to say off his chest. As his gaze met mine, I could see the words fighting to be said, but his lips betrayed him by staying clamped shut in a tight, thin line.</p><p>It was Jeff who surprised us all by asking, \u201cHow\u2019s Layla?\u201d Harry slowly turned to look at him, and Jeff shrugged, \u201cH, if I waited for you to ask, we\u2019d be here all day.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I was relieved someone had said what I was waiting for. Harry had wanted to ask, but he didn\u2019t trust me, and he was well within his rights not to. However, I hoped that when I answered, he would know that I was grateful every day for having my ex-wife\u2019s forgiveness when I really wasn\u2019t deserving of it. I also wanted to help him get it too.</p><p>\u201cLayla is doing really well. Her and Rose are working their socks off to make the business a success, and she\u2019s the happiest I\u2019ve seen her in a long time. You should go to one of her events, Harry, you\u2019d be incredibly proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill\u2026\u201d Terry groaned, covering his face with his hand, making me realise that what I\u2019d said had sounded much better in my head. I\u2019d wanted to encourage Harry to make his move, but it had come across like I was gloating.</p><p>Harry sat up in his seat and leaned forward, resting both elbows on the table. Voice measured and restrained, he said, \u201cI think you know why I haven\u2019t been, Will. She doesn\u2019t want me there.\u201d</p><p>Clearing his throat, Terry suddenly stood up and clapped his hands together. \u201cJeff! Why don\u2019t I give you a tour of the building? Show you some of the mock ups for some of the old sets we\u2019ve done, I keep them all.\u201d</p><p>Jeff looked at Harry for the okay, and Harry nodded and muttered it was fine. We waited for them to leave, Terry whispering to me, as he passed, to remember that I didn\u2019t want to fight Harry, I wanted to help him.</p><p>As soon as the door closed, I sighed, \u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s not how I meant that to come across.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Harry replied, somewhat dubiously. \u201cOkay, yeah, as I\u2019m sure you know, I struggled with her decision at first, but I\u2019ve accepted it.\u201d He then added with a hint of bitterness, \u201cShe chose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you aren\u2019t here because you want me to help you get back in touch with her, then?\u201d I chose to gloss over his comment about me having won. I hadn\u2019t won, Lil hadn\u2019t chose me. It had merely been luck that Terry loved us both enough to help us work past the hurt we\u2019d caused each other. I knew full well that had he not been around, I\u2019d have been out of Layla\u2019s life, and wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to grow a friendship where there had once only been hate and bitterness.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I need you to help me? I saw that article, I know where her office is.\u201d Defiant, Harry sat back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Harry, you tell me why.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked away, reluctant to admit that I was right. Getting up from my seat, I went and sat in the one next to him that Jeff had recently vacated, turning it so I could look at him. \u201cListen, I know we have a\u2026 difficult history, and I understand why you\u2019re reluctant to trust me. But, believe it or not, I am on your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifficult? That\u2019s a bit of an understatement,\u201d Harry scoffed. Turning so we were face to face, he asked, \u201cWhy? Why are you suddenly on my side? You said L\u2026 You said Layla\u2019s happy, why would you help me when you know she doesn\u2019t want me?\u201d</p><p>The pause before he said her name was excruciating, and it told me everything I needed to know about him since Layla had cut him out. I\u2019d heard the songs on his album, heard the pain of someone who\u2019d had their heart broken almost beyond repair, but he was an artist, and embellishment was a tool of the trade. Harry being unable to say her name, without some sort of mental run and jump over the wall he\u2019d built, was evidence that there hadn\u2019t been much embellishment at all.</p><p>But first, I had to address my own issues. Taking a deep breath, I remembered all the things I\u2019d worked on in my therapy sessions, accepted that Harry might not forgive me the way others had, and reminded myself that I had changed. I wasn\u2019t the Will that Harry had once known.</p><p>\u201cI am not the same person as I was back then. I was a horrible man, one who was so caught up in a lie that I\u2019d brought upon myself that I lashed out at the people around me for no other reason than I felt trapped. Layla bore the biggest brunt of that, but even when she found out about Terry and I, she was never malicious. She was sympathetic even, she told us that had I been honest from the start, she would have probably helped us keep our secret. She had the perfect chance to expose me, and get me back for the horrid way I treated her when she came with me to tell my mother about the divorce. She could have told her then, but she sat quietly as she was called a whore and a gold-digger, and she kept my secret.\u201d Chuckling, I tried to lighten the mood, but Harry remained unimpressed, \u201cShe also came with Terry and I when I finally told my mother about us being together, but I think that time was less for support and more for the enjoyment of seeing my mother hit the roof.\u201d<br>\u201cI already knew you were a shitty person, Will, and I\u2019m sorry you felt like you had no choice, but it doesn\u2019t excuse what you did to her, the way you spoke about her to me when you were trying to be \u2018one of the lads\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Harry, and that\u2019s why I want to help you.\u201d Putting my hand on my heart, I tilted my head back and closed my eyes. I spoke to Harry, but I also spoke to the universe, repeating the promises I\u2019d already made to Layla and Terry - they were my highest priorities in life, and I would stop at nothing to see them happy. \u201cNothing I ever do will make up for my behaviour, but I love her, and I want her to have the happy life she thought she was going to have with me. She deserves it, after everything she\u2019s been through.\u201d</p><p>Though not entirely convinced, Harry seemed to accept my answer as genuine. But, he was impatient and waiting for the catch, for the moment I put on my fake moustache and cackled malevolently that I\u2019d tricked him and had no plans to help, for the moment that I was going to tell Layla, and we would both laugh at how pathetic he was.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about our affair? Don\u2019t you hate me for going after her? I didn\u2019t know about you and Terry, I just thought you were a shitty husband, and I wanted to treat her better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is precisely why I don\u2019t hate you!\u201d I said, emphatically. \u201cAt first I was angry, oh fuck was I angry! I wanted to ruin you and your career, to be honest, so you can thank Terry for stopping me, \u2018cause I nearly did it. But once I remembered that you didn\u2019t go to that little hotel rendez-vous alone, and once Terry reminded me that I all but pushed Layla into looking for love and affection somewhere else, I saw sense. You pursued her, but she\u2019s told me she didn\u2019t exactly put up a fight, quite the opposite.\u201d</p><p>Harry avoided my eyes at the mention of his hotel trysts with Layla, realising that I probably knew everything about their affair. Which, other than the gory details I didn\u2019t need to know, I did. I knew about him coming to the house after we\u2019d all played golf, I knew about him being at the restaurant the night I\u2019d made Layla cry, I knew about them spending her birthday together, and I knew about him asking her to leave me. He looked ashamed, but I\u2019d long since stopped being angry about any betrayal I might have felt from Harry\u2019s actions. He\u2019d said it himself, I was a shitty husband, and he had treated her better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming this very forgiving outlook came after you punched me in the face?\u201d He asked, not without humour, giving me hope of a truce.</p><p>\u201cHarry, that night when I punched you, which I apologise profusely for, and which I regretted the moment it happened, I saw you two together and I was jealous. Of course, I now know the fragility of your relationship at that time, but i only saw the united front you put on, and I only saw that Layla was getting to be with the person she\u2019d kept a secret, while I was still trapped.\u201d</p><p>Harry let out a sigh, and shook his head like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders and was exhausted from carrying it. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a united front, Will, I\u2019d already ruined everything. You just made the inevitable happen sooner.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled, and he looked at me. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s funny, Layla said the same thing.\u201d Harry put his head in his hands, as though Layla agreeing with him made him lose all hope that she\u2019d ever forgive him. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d I asked. \u201cReally, really love her?\u201d</p><p>Lifting his head to look me in the eye, he answered firmly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want her back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I want her back. More than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, why now? You\u2019re about to go on two tours, hardly the best environment for you both, considering there were trust issues,\u201d I paused, hoping I wasn\u2019t about to undo my hard work, \u201cand, I thought I read that you were dating someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it-it didn\u2019t work out,\u201d he said, shaking his head and looking down, sadly. He was quiet for a moment, deep in thought. \u201cSome of why is\u2026 it\u2019s a bit personal. I\u2019ve lost some really important people, and I\u2019m sure you understand that life is too short to not at least try to be with the person you\u2019re in love with. But also, seeing that magazine article stirred up a lot. I\u2019ve never really gotten over her. I\u2019ve dated other people, tried to move on and get on with my life, but it\u2019s been hard. It got a little easier after my sister, Gemma, spoke to Layla and told me she was happy without me, but I still think about her all the time.\u201d Harry laughed, and I could see him blushing a little, \u201cIt\u2019s really strange talking to you about her.\u201d</p><p>I joined in with his laughter, feeling some of the tension breaking as I nodded heartily in agreement, \u201cIt\u2019s strange hearing it, if truth be told, but all I really need to know is if you\u2019re really ready? Layla is ready to settle down again, not that she\u2019s racing up the aisle or picking paint for a nursery, the business is her main priority, but she\u2019s getting there.\u201d It was my turn to turn bashful, and a little sad. \u201cOnce upon a time, we had our own plans for the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. I made sure of that before coming to see you. I\u2019m not really comfortable divulging my deepest feelings for your ex-wife to you, but I want to be with her. I never, ever, want to hurt her again.\u201d A smile played on his lips as he thought about it, as he pictured a life with Layla, \u201cLife is going to be hectic for me, but it\u2019s always going to be like that. There\u2019ll never be a right time, so I want to try before it\u2019s too late, before she marries someone else.\u201d</p><p>The boardroom door opening suddenly startled us both, and I twisted in my seat to see Maggie grimacing, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know what I said, but Joel just turned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit! Okay, thanks, Mags, just don\u2019t let him anywhere near here.\u201d</p><p>Maggie nodded, then disappeared. When I turned back to Harry, he seemed to be a lot more relaxed than he had been at the beginning of the meeting.</p><p>\u201cDifficult client?\u201d He asked with a cheeky smile.</p><p>I shook my head and let my shoulders sag. I\u2019d wanted to break the news to Harry once I knew he was serious about being ready to be with Layla, but I knew he would only think I had been trying to keep things from him.</p><p>\u201cWorse,\u201d I answered. \u201cHe\u2019s Layla\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d</p>",

That&rsquo;s what the magazine article said her name was. It didn&rsquo;t matter that I&rsquo;d know her face anywhere, or that Rose was also pictured with her, the name change confused me, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe I was seeing Layla&rsquo;s face after so long. Standing up for no reason other than needing to feel like I was doing something, I stared at her photo to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t seeing things. Her hair was shorter, loose, blonde waves resting on her shoulders, she smiled at the camera just enough to make the dimples in her cheeks visible, and I could see a confidence I hadn&rsquo;t really seen in her before. But it was her - it was my Layla.</p><p>Seeing her in a magazine had thrown me. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with myself or my emotions. A lot of my exes were regularly in the media, and I&rsquo;d grown used to seeing someone I&rsquo;d been intimate with as I read the newspaper and its accompanying supplements over my cornflakes, but I had never expected to see her. She looked&hellip;beautiful.</p><p>I sat back down and took a deep breath to calm myself. Grabbing my phone, I took a photo of the article and sent it to Jeff. I knew he&rsquo;d probably start worrying that I was about to spiral again, but I felt excitement at seeing her more than upset or pain, and I had to tell someone about it.</p><p>He was quick to reply, though it was late in LA.</p><p><b>Jeff</b><br /><i>You ok?</i></p><p><b>Harry</b><br /><i>I&rsquo;m good, man. Can we sort out sending some flowers to their office? To say congrats on the article?</i></p><p>Jeff started to type, then stopped, then started again. Even when we weren&rsquo;t in the same place, I could tell he was reluctant to indulge me when it came to Layla. I could practically hear him muttering to himself &ldquo;here we go again.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Jeff</b><br /><i>Yeah, no worries.</i><br /><i>Are you sure you want to?</i></p><p>I had to. She&rsquo;d sent me roses - pink, like I always sent her - to congratulate and wish me luck when &lsquo;Sign of the Times&rsquo; came out. I had kept the card that came with the flowers with me at all times, hidden away under my phone case. There&rsquo;d been no name inside but I&rsquo;d known it was from her, and I wanted to return the gesture.</p><p><b>Harry</b><br /><i>Yes. Baby pink roses, but don&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re from me. Thanks! </i><br /><i>Go to sleep!</i></p><p><b>Jeff</b><br /><i>Ok, I&rsquo;ll sort it out in the morning.</i></p><p>Setting my phone back down on the table, I looked at Layla&rsquo;s face again. I missed her so much, and all the feelings I&rsquo;d spent three years learning to push down came flooding back, a huge wave of love, and an aching absence for the one who got away. Long since forgotten memories bubbled up to the surface, along with the things that I loved about her, things that frustrated me, and things she did that she probably didn&rsquo;t realise made me adore her.</p><p>I was struck by the memory of when I knew I was falling in love with her. I&rsquo;d already suspected it was happening, and I&rsquo;d tried to brush it off as just infatuation for someone I couldn&rsquo;t have, but seeing Layla crying that night in the restaurant changed everything. I knew then that we were more than just two people who&rsquo;d had a throwaway fling. I was worried for her, and I wanted nothing more than to protect her from whatever Will had said or done to upset her. When I&rsquo;d tried to go over, she&rsquo;d shook her head, worried that I&rsquo;d only make things worse. So, all I could do was watch as Will practically dragged her from their table, and watch as she gave me a quick glance over her shoulder, her face fraught with fear and misery over what was possibly going to happen when they were alone. The expression on her face had haunted me, so much so that I&rsquo;d invited Will and Terry to our movie premiere just so she would be there too. I&rsquo;d sent her a message to tell her I really wanted her to be there, and she&rsquo;d sent a short reply agreeing. I just wanted to make sure she was okay, and even if we didn&rsquo;t rekindle our affair, I&rsquo;d at least know that everything was alright.</p><p>When I saw Terry&rsquo;s daughter, Mia, instead of Layla, I&rsquo;d thought she&rsquo;d come in her place, and I was disappointed that she had changed her mind. Any other time I would have just casually asked Will where she was, but I had found saying anything other than a quick hello to him too difficult, so I&rsquo;d tried to just enjoy the night. So, my heart had skipped a beat when I&rsquo;d been in the hotel bar talking to Alice, and I&rsquo;d looked up to see Layla stood in the doorway, dressed in black like she was was attending a funeral, and looking at me with what almost looked like jealousy.</p><p>I talked her into meeting me in a room upstairs, which I&rsquo;d requested specifically so we would have somewhere to talk alone. She&rsquo;d sat on the edge of the bed, with her shapely legs crossed, and a passive smile on her red lips, and told me that her crying had been because she&rsquo;d been tired and emotional from her holiday. I&rsquo;d known she was lying, but as I joined her on the bed, I&rsquo;d had no choice but to accept her insistence that there was nothing wrong, that she&rsquo;d made it all seem worse than it actually was. And then, when she tried to leave, I stopped her, and I told her I missed her. As soon as we kissed again, I knew that I couldn&rsquo;t walk away from her easily. I wanted her, I needed her, and although she tried to fight it, I knew Layla felt the same.</p><p>I was downstairs when the penny dropped. After we&rsquo;d arranged to spend more than one night together, after I&rsquo;d joined her while she sat alone waiting for her husband to appear, after I&rsquo;d introduced her to my mother, and after I&rsquo;d read the horrible message Will had sent her saying he&rsquo;d already left - confirming what I&rsquo;d suspected, that Layla&rsquo;s insistence that the restaurant incident had just been a one off was really her refusal to show me anything but perfection, after all of that, as we shared a public goodbye in the hotel foyer, hugging and touching as much as we could without arousing suspicion, I finally realised that I was falling head over heels in love with Layla French. The way she smiled and rolled her eyes at my flirtatious comments. The sweet, lingering smell of her perfume, and how she leaned against me when we hugged, and all the other million things that made not asking her to stay almost impossible. I watched her walk away to get her ride home, and I accepted how I felt. I wanted to leave with her, or better still, wanted her to stay so she could meet all my friends and family. The ache of her leaving made me breathless, and sense told me things had gone too far, but the realisation came too late - I was already counting down the days until we were together again.</p><p>The next morning, as I nursed my hangover, I tried to get back some control, pretended like two nights together would probably drive us both mad with boredom or irritation. But then when we were together, and I&rsquo;d overheard her telling her friend, Rose, that she was excited about her birthday celebrations (and that of course Will had forgotten to get her anything like it was an in-joke), I cast aside all control. She deserved the world, and I wanted to give it to her.</p><p>Remembering how beautiful she&rsquo;d looked as she smelled the pink roses, which I&rsquo;d now come to associate with her, made my chest ache.</p><p>With an urgent need of distraction before I was swallowed up by emotion, I switched my focus back to the magazine. The article itself was about female owned businesses and the women who ran them. Layla and Rose had started their own event planning company, aptly named 'Layla-Rose Events&rsquo;, and in the short time it had been up and running, it was going from strength to strength. They talked about how they got started, how they&rsquo;d both put everything they had into it, and how exciting it had been moving into their new office in Shoreditch. It then went on to list some of the famous people they&rsquo;d planned for. I had friends who&rsquo;d been to their parties, and they all commented on how well run the events were, and how everything was catered for. I&rsquo;d casually ask how it was, out of interest, mentioning that I knew the owners, and taking a rare opportunity &nbsp;to say her name without being met with a look of worry or derision. Invitations would frequently arrive for me, but because I knew full well that they were at the request of the client, and not because Layla wanted me there, the instruction was given to always politely decline unless told otherwise. The days where I turned up somewhere she didn&rsquo;t want me to just to get her attention were long gone.</p><p>I read the article over three times in a row, trying to remember her voice and how the words she was quoted as saying would sound coming from her mouth. There wasn&rsquo;t enough information, and I felt frustration stir in my belly every time I read that she was now friends with Will and Terry. So much so, in fact, that they&rsquo;d helped the two women find some of their earlier clients, and also let them use some of their office space when it was just a two person operation.</p><p>Will. Of all the people Layla could forgive and allow to be a part of her life, she had chosen Will. I&rsquo;d been baffled enough by Terry&rsquo;s appearance the last time I&rsquo;d ended up on Lil&rsquo;s doorstep, begging to be heard, but at least he&rsquo;d always been her supporter. Will, on the other hand, had only ever bullied, berated, and lied to her. Sat alone in my kitchen, with only a chance discovery of an interview in a magazine to tell me what was going on in her life, the frustration and bitterness grew until I had to get up and walk away. I&rsquo;d come to terms with Layla and I breaking up, and how it had been of my own doing, but I just could not understand how -in comparison to Will- I deserved total exile.</p><p>Safely away from the picture of Layla&rsquo;s happy, smiling face, the anxiety brought on by how unfair it all felt began to settle. Taking deep and steady breaths, I reminded myself that the decision was not mine to make, and I had to accept that she didn&rsquo;t want me to be a part of her life. She had made her own happiness; she had her own business, she had Rose, and she had all the other people around her that she wanted, and that made her happy. I also had my career and my impending tour, I had the beginnings of a new relationship that was making me happy in a way I hadn&rsquo;t really felt since Layla, and I had my own group of people who loved and supported me.</p><p>We had both moved on.</p><p>Or rather, Layla had made her decision, and I had no choice but to go along with it.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d7daca174232653332b6d144920fa6d/tumblr_inline_pjaa63DFdd1w7xqut_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>2017 - August</b></p><p>In one of the toughest weeks of my life, two things happened that I never imagined would; the first being my mother, Verity, in the final hours of her life, telling me that she hoped Terry and I were going to have a long and happy life together. And the second was when Harry Styles called to arrange a meeting with Terry and I about us working on his second tour. I wasn&rsquo;t sure which of the two shocked me more.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s call came the day after my mother had passed away, and I was hiding away in my office, hoping that if I pretended to work for long enough that it would distract me from my grief. I gave instructions to Maggie at reception that anyone who called was to be told I was out of office and I would get back to them, or they were to be put through to someone else who could help. But, when Maggie poked her head around the door with a strange look on her face, and said that Harry Styles was on the line, asking to speak to me only, I made an exception.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; I tried my best to sound friendly, hoping that he wouldn&rsquo;t hear the confusion in my voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Will, it&rsquo;s Harry.&rdquo; His deep voice sounded wary, as though he was unsure if calling was a good idea. I imagined that he wasn&rsquo;t exactly overjoyed at the prospect of being in a room with me, seeing as the last time we were I&rsquo;d punched him.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to hear from you, Harry, what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry explained that he would be going on a small venue tour that would start at the end of September and would end in early December. He would then be going on a larger, arena tour in mid-March, and he was hoping our company would be interested in working with him.</p><p>For a moment I was stunned silent. The week already had a dream-like quality to it, and Harry wanting to possibly work together only added to that fact. Eventually, I managed to find a reply. &ldquo;Yes, of course, we&rsquo;d love to work with you again, Harry! When would you like to come in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would next Wednesday be okay?&rdquo; Harry asked, thankfully not suggesting the day I&rsquo;d just arranged to have my mother&rsquo;s funeral. &ldquo;At three?</p><p>&ldquo;I have an appointment at twelve, but I will be done by three, so that all sounds good to me. It&rsquo;ll be nice to see you again after so long.&rdquo;</p><p>He hummed dubiously, and then we both fell into an awkward silence. We could have said goodbye then, hung up, and gone on our merry way, but neither of us said anything. I wanted to give him the time to ask the question I was suspecting he was waiting to ask. However, it never came. Instead, he suddenly said he had to go because of another call, and quickly hung up.</p><p>Shaking my head in disbelief, I sat back in my chair, and after realising I&rsquo;d practically held my breath for the entirety of the phone call, I exhaled. While I sent Terry a message to come see me when he was free, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think there had to be some sort of ulterior motive. I was glad of the chance to have Harry&rsquo;s business, and despite what was going on quite literally behind the scenes, he had always been pleasant to work with. But, I couldn&rsquo;t for a second let myself think that his request to meet wasn&rsquo;t some sort of ploy. We had a rocky history, and I was never going to be the top of his list unless he could get something out of it. Something that couldn&rsquo;t just be said on the phone. Something that no doubt also involved my ex-wife.</p><p>Terry and I agreed that Layla didn&rsquo;t need to know about the meeting with Harry unless it was absolutely necessary. She was happy, and I liked seeing her that way, so there wasn&rsquo;t any point in stirring up old feelings over a meeting that might not lead anywhere. It also meant that Joel, Layla&rsquo;s boyfriend of over a year, and our resource manager, would need to be included on the need to know basis list. I found a supplier I needed him to go see, so he wouldn&rsquo;t be in the building, and only Terry, Maggie, and I knew that Harry would be visiting.</p><p>Before my meeting with Harry, I had one on Park Lane with my mother&rsquo;s solicitor to discuss the reading of her will, and all the boring admin sides of losing a loved one. I was the sole heir of her inheritance, but things had been so frosty and unfriendly between us since I finally told her I was with Terry that I half expected to find out she&rsquo;d followed through with her threats and donated everything to a donkey sanctuary. But, other than a few pieces of jewelry that she&rsquo;d strangely left Lil, and some money which she did want donated to a donkey sanctuary, all my mother&rsquo;s estate fell directly to me. The son who&rsquo;d disappointed her, repeatedly.</p><p>The meeting itself was short, but the traffic back to the office was slow moving and long, so by the time I finally parked my car in the usual spot, I was already fifteen minutes late.</p><p>&ldquo;Are they here?&rdquo; I asked Maggie as I burst through the glass doors into our building.</p><p>Maggie nodded and rushed from behind the reception desk. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go in there looking like that though! You look ready to kill someone.&rdquo;</p><p>She placed her hands on my shoulders and made me take a few deep breaths until I was calmer.</p><p>&ldquo;Traffic was a nightmare the whole way here. I forgot why I stopped dr-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. You&rsquo;re here now, and Terry has everything under control. Harry has his manager, Jeff, with him, and I&rsquo;ve already taken in coffee while they waited for you. I&rsquo;ve also checked and there isn&rsquo;t any chance of Joel or Layla making a surprise appearance. Now! Get in there and do what you do best!&rdquo;</p><p>Chuckling, I let my shoulders relax and thanked my lucky stars that at least one of us was confident I could face Harry again. &ldquo;Thank you, Mags. What would we do without you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The building would collapse around your ears, William. I&rsquo;m like the ravens at the Tower of London, you&rsquo;re all doomed when I leave.&rdquo;</p><p>Nerves made an appearance as I approached the meeting room, and I wondered if Terry would kill me if I just went and hid in my office until Harry and his manager were gone. The reality of losing my mother had started to kick in as I&rsquo;d listened to her final wishes, and both Harry and I knew full well that I didn&rsquo;t handle things the best when my emotions were running high.</p><p>But, then I remembered that was the point! Harry had his ulterior motive, and so did I. I wanted to, at the very least, make amends and apologise for my behaviour the last time we were in a room together, which I&rsquo;d been too cowardly to do before now. After I&rsquo;d thrown the punch, I&rsquo;d left Layla&rsquo;s house, and was too scared to face what I had done. Terry took over all of One Direction&rsquo;s requests and meetings, and I&rsquo;d hidden away in shame. This opportunity was mine for the taking, I could show Harry that I wasn&rsquo;t who I&rsquo;d once been, and that I had changed for the better.</p><p>Pushing the door open, I entered the room, and all three men turned to look at me.</p><p>&ldquo;I am so sorry for keeping you!&rdquo; I smiled, ignoring the glare I was getting from Harry&rsquo;s manager as I shook his hand, &ldquo;I think I got caught in every conceivable bit of traffic on my way here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were just saying that driving around London is a nightmare this time of day!&rdquo; Terry laughed, backing me up as we exchanged glances that told me he&rsquo;d been working a tough crowd.</p><p>The already tense room became even more so as Harry and I came face to face. I felt both Terry and Jeff ready themselves in case one of us erupted into a fight, but looking at Harry - the man who&rsquo;d had an affair with my wife - I felt nothing but an odd sense of affection. Layla, on the rare occasion she spoke of Harry, had said the same thing - he had given her the confidence to leave me, and although I&rsquo;d been angry and bitter at the time, it led to my finally having the wonderful, happy life I had with Terry. The huge guilt I felt was because, maybe, I&rsquo;d ruined Layla&rsquo;s chance at that same happiness.</p><p>When I shook Harry&rsquo;s hand, I made sure to look him in the eye in hope that he would know how warm and genuine my words were, and that I held no grudges against him. I only hoped he felt the same. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really good to see you again, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you too.&rdquo; He muttered, giving me a tight-lipped smile before sitting back down and taking a sip of his black coffee.</p><p>Walking around the large, rectangle table, I went to sit next to Terry, who squeezed my knee and gave me an encouraging wink. The gesture, though small, reminded me that I was not alone. My husband-to-be was at my side, reminding me that Harry was the last piece of the puzzle I had left to mend.</p><p>With renewed determination, I reached for the folder that contained the company&rsquo;s proposal for Harry&rsquo;s tour, opened it, and fixed a smile on my face. &ldquo;So! You&rsquo;re going on tour then, Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>Terry had been excited to plan Harry&rsquo;s set, choosing to work on most of the designs himself. It took Harry by surprise when we told him that we were big fans of his album, especially when I confessed that we&rsquo;d already had a lot of ideas in place for his set, because Terry and I would listen to albums we loved in the car and plan fantasy sets for them. His album had been in our car for at least a month after its release, so we&rsquo;d planned a tour for it on many a journey to and from work.</p><p>The general idea was for it to be similar in simplicity to the designs Terry and my father had started off with in the seventies, but with all the wonders of modern technology. We wanted Harry&rsquo;s album, and his incredible stage presence, to speak for itself, whilst also having a setup that would use some of the beautiful visuals that had been created for the album.</p><p>To our relief, Harry and his manager seemed to like what we had in mind, nodding along as I ran through our ideas for each song on the rough setlist we&rsquo;d been sent.</p><p>&ldquo;But, of course, Harry, it&rsquo;s entirely up to you, and we&rsquo;re open to anything you want to do to represent your work,&rdquo; Terry said, as our presentation drew to a close. &ldquo;However, as you both know, the sooner we get started the better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; Harry answered, glancing at Jeff before leaning in to look at the sketches. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too far from what I was picturing.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeff, who was a little keener to keep his cards close to his chest, nodded in agreement, then quickly added, &ldquo;we have another meeting tomorrow, and then we&rsquo;ll let you know. I&rsquo;m guessing the circular screen will take the longest to manufacture?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but the company we use is quick to get the ball rolling, so it&rsquo;ll actually be quicker than one would imagine. It&rsquo;s checking the mechanics that make it move, which slow down the process.&rdquo;</p><p>Satisfied with Terry&rsquo;s answer, the two young men looked at each other and fell silent.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity, I looked at Harry and asked, &ldquo;was there anything else you needed to know?&rdquo;</p><p>Everything felt tense again, as I handed him a platform to get whatever he had come to say off his chest. As his gaze met mine, I could see the words fighting to be said, but his lips betrayed him by staying clamped shut in a tight, thin line.</p><p>It was Jeff who surprised us all by asking, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Layla?&rdquo; Harry slowly turned to look at him, and Jeff shrugged, &ldquo;H, if I waited for you to ask, we&rsquo;d be here all day.&rdquo;</p><p>Smiling, I was relieved someone had said what I was waiting for. Harry had wanted to ask, but he didn&rsquo;t trust me, and he was well within his rights not to. However, I hoped that when I answered, he would know that I was grateful every day for having my ex-wife&rsquo;s forgiveness when I really wasn&rsquo;t deserving of it. I also wanted to help him get it too.</p><p>&ldquo;Layla is doing really well. Her and Rose are working their socks off to make the business a success, and she&rsquo;s the happiest I&rsquo;ve seen her in a long time. You should go to one of her events, Harry, you&rsquo;d be incredibly proud.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will&hellip;&rdquo; Terry groaned, covering his face with his hand, making me realise that what I&rsquo;d said had sounded much better in my head. I&rsquo;d wanted to encourage Harry to make his move, but it had come across like I was gloating.</p><p>Harry sat up in his seat and leaned forward, resting both elbows on the table. Voice measured and restrained, he said, &ldquo;I think you know why I haven&rsquo;t been, Will. She doesn&rsquo;t want me there.&rdquo;</p><p>Clearing his throat, Terry suddenly stood up and clapped his hands together. &ldquo;Jeff! Why don&rsquo;t I give you a tour of the building? Show you some of the mock ups for some of the old sets we&rsquo;ve done, I keep them all.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeff looked at Harry for the okay, and Harry nodded and muttered it was fine. We waited for them to leave, Terry whispering to me, as he passed, to remember that I didn&rsquo;t want to fight Harry, I wanted to help him.</p><p>As soon as the door closed, I sighed, &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m sorry. That&rsquo;s not how I meant that to come across.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Harry replied, somewhat dubiously. &ldquo;Okay, yeah, as I&rsquo;m sure you know, I struggled with her decision at first, but I&rsquo;ve accepted it.&rdquo; He then added with a hint of bitterness, &ldquo;She chose you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, you aren&rsquo;t here because you want me to help you get back in touch with her, then?&rdquo; I chose to gloss over his comment about me having won. I hadn&rsquo;t won, Lil hadn&rsquo;t chose me. It had merely been luck that Terry loved us both enough to help us work past the hurt we&rsquo;d caused each other. I knew full well that had he not been around, I&rsquo;d have been out of Layla&rsquo;s life, and wouldn&rsquo;t have had the chance to grow a friendship where there had once only been hate and bitterness.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you think I need you to help me? I saw that article, I know where her office is.&rdquo; Defiant, Harry sat back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Harry, you tell me why.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry looked away, reluctant to admit that I was right. Getting up from my seat, I went and sat in the one next to him that Jeff had recently vacated, turning it so I could look at him. &ldquo;Listen, I know we have a&hellip; difficult history, and I understand why you&rsquo;re reluctant to trust me. But, believe it or not, I am on your side.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Difficult? That&rsquo;s a bit of an understatement,&rdquo; Harry scoffed. Turning so we were face to face, he asked, &ldquo;Why? Why are you suddenly on my side? You said L&hellip; You said Layla&rsquo;s happy, why would you help me when you know she doesn&rsquo;t want me?&rdquo;</p><p>The pause before he said her name was excruciating, and it told me everything I needed to know about him since Layla had cut him out. I&rsquo;d heard the songs on his album, heard the pain of someone who&rsquo;d had their heart broken almost beyond repair, but he was an artist, and embellishment was a tool of the trade. Harry being unable to say her name, without some sort of mental run and jump over the wall he&rsquo;d built, was evidence that there hadn&rsquo;t been much embellishment at all.</p><p>But first, I had to address my own issues. Taking a deep breath, I remembered all the things I&rsquo;d worked on in my therapy sessions, accepted that Harry might not forgive me the way others had, and reminded myself that I had changed. I wasn&rsquo;t the Will that Harry had once known.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not the same person as I was back then. I was a horrible man, one who was so caught up in a lie that I&rsquo;d brought upon myself that I lashed out at the people around me for no other reason than I felt trapped. Layla bore the biggest brunt of that, but even when she found out about Terry and I, she was never malicious. She was sympathetic even, she told us that had I been honest from the start, she would have probably helped us keep our secret. She had the perfect chance to expose me, and get me back for the horrid way I treated her when she came with me to tell my mother about the divorce. She could have told her then, but she sat quietly as she was called a whore and a gold-digger, and she kept my secret.&rdquo; Chuckling, I tried to lighten the mood, but Harry remained unimpressed, &ldquo;She also came with Terry and I when I finally told my mother about us being together, but I think that time was less for support and more for the enjoyment of seeing my mother hit the roof.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I already knew you were a shitty person, Will, and I&rsquo;m sorry you felt like you had no choice, but it doesn&rsquo;t excuse what you did to her, the way you spoke about her to me when you were trying to be &lsquo;one of the lads&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that, Harry, and that&rsquo;s why I want to help you.&rdquo; Putting my hand on my heart, I tilted my head back and closed my eyes. I spoke to Harry, but I also spoke to the universe, repeating the promises I&rsquo;d already made to Layla and Terry - they were my highest priorities in life, and I would stop at nothing to see them happy. &ldquo;Nothing I ever do will make up for my behaviour, but I love her, and I want her to have the happy life she thought she was going to have with me. She deserves it, after everything she&rsquo;s been through.&rdquo;</p><p>Though not entirely convinced, Harry seemed to accept my answer as genuine. But, he was impatient and waiting for the catch, for the moment I put on my fake moustache and cackled malevolently that I&rsquo;d tricked him and had no plans to help, for the moment that I was going to tell Layla, and we would both laugh at how pathetic he was.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what about our affair? Don&rsquo;t you hate me for going after her? I didn&rsquo;t know about you and Terry, I just thought you were a shitty husband, and I wanted to treat her better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which is precisely why I don&rsquo;t hate you!&rdquo; I said, emphatically. &ldquo;At first I was angry, oh fuck was I angry! I wanted to ruin you and your career, to be honest, so you can thank Terry for stopping me, &lsquo;cause I nearly did it. But once I remembered that you didn&rsquo;t go to that little hotel rendez-vous alone, and once Terry reminded me that I all but pushed Layla into looking for love and affection somewhere else, I saw sense. You pursued her, but she&rsquo;s told me she didn&rsquo;t exactly put up a fight, quite the opposite.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry avoided my eyes at the mention of his hotel trysts with Layla, realising that I probably knew everything about their affair. Which, other than the gory details I didn&rsquo;t need to know, I did. I knew about him coming to the house after we&rsquo;d all played golf, I knew about him being at the restaurant the night I&rsquo;d made Layla cry, I knew about them spending her birthday together, and I knew about him asking her to leave me. He looked ashamed, but I&rsquo;d long since stopped being angry about any betrayal I might have felt from Harry&rsquo;s actions. He&rsquo;d said it himself, I was a shitty husband, and he had treated her better.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming this very forgiving outlook came after you punched me in the face?&rdquo; He asked, not without humour, giving me hope of a truce.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, that night when I punched you, which I apologise profusely for, and which I regretted the moment it happened, I saw you two together and I was jealous. Of course, I now know the fragility of your relationship at that time, but i only saw the united front you put on, and I only saw that Layla was getting to be with the person she&rsquo;d kept a secret, while I was still trapped.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry let out a sigh, and shook his head like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders and was exhausted from carrying it. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t a united front, Will, I&rsquo;d already ruined everything. You just made the inevitable happen sooner.&rdquo;</p><p>I chuckled, and he looked at me. I said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny, Layla said the same thing.&rdquo; Harry put his head in his hands, as though Layla agreeing with him made him lose all hope that she&rsquo;d ever forgive him. &ldquo;Do you love her?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Really, really love her?&rdquo;</p><p>Lifting his head to look me in the eye, he answered firmly, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you want her back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I want her back. More than anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, why now? You&rsquo;re about to go on two tours, hardly the best environment for you both, considering there were trust issues,&rdquo; I paused, hoping I wasn&rsquo;t about to undo my hard work, &ldquo;and, I thought I read that you were dating someone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it-it didn&rsquo;t work out,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head and looking down, sadly. He was quiet for a moment, deep in thought. &ldquo;Some of why is&hellip; it&rsquo;s a bit personal. I&rsquo;ve lost some really important people, and I&rsquo;m sure you understand that life is too short to not at least try to be with the person you&rsquo;re in love with. But also, seeing that magazine article stirred up a lot. I&rsquo;ve never really gotten over her. I&rsquo;ve dated other people, tried to move on and get on with my life, but it&rsquo;s been hard. It got a little easier after my sister, Gemma, spoke to Layla and told me she was happy without me, but I still think about her all the time.&rdquo; Harry laughed, and I could see him blushing a little, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really strange talking to you about her.&rdquo;</p><p>I joined in with his laughter, feeling some of the tension breaking as I nodded heartily in agreement, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange hearing it, if truth be told, but all I really need to know is if you&rsquo;re really ready? Layla is ready to settle down again, not that she&rsquo;s racing up the aisle or picking paint for a nursery, the business is her main priority, but she&rsquo;s getting there.&rdquo; It was my turn to turn bashful, and a little sad. &ldquo;Once upon a time, we had our own plans for the future.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready. I made sure of that before coming to see you. I&rsquo;m not really comfortable divulging my deepest feelings for your ex-wife to you, but I want to be with her. I never, ever, want to hurt her again.&rdquo; A smile played on his lips as he thought about it, as he pictured a life with Layla, &ldquo;Life is going to be hectic for me, but it&rsquo;s always going to be like that. There&rsquo;ll never be a right time, so I want to try before it&rsquo;s too late, before she marries someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>The boardroom door opening suddenly startled us both, and I twisted in my seat to see Maggie grimacing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I know what I said, but Joel just turned up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit! Okay, thanks, Mags, just don&rsquo;t let him anywhere near here.&rdquo;</p><p>Maggie nodded, then disappeared. When I turned back to Harry, he seemed to be a lot more relaxed than he had been at the beginning of the meeting.</p><p>&ldquo;Difficult client?&rdquo; He asked with a cheeky smile.</p><p>I shook my head and let my shoulders sag. I&rsquo;d wanted to break the news to Harry once I knew he was serious about being ready to be with Layla, but I knew he would only think I had been trying to keep things from him.</p><p>&ldquo;Worse,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Layla&rsquo;s boyfriend.&rdquo;</p>",

Standing up for no reason other than needing to feel like I was doing something, I stared at her photo to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t seeing things. Her hair was shorter, loose, blonde waves resting on her shoulders, she smiled at the camera just enough to make the dimples in her cheeks visible, and I could see a confidence I hadn&rsquo;t really seen in her before. But it was her - it was my Layla.</p>\n</p>",
