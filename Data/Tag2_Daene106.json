For me, it\u2019s kind of obvious, because let\u2019s be real, no other character has reached this level of epic heroism* ** or fits into all criteria at once. But it\u2019s always nice to find new details confirming your opinion :3</p><p>So, the star.  The comet, really, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s called in the text most of the times. What\u2019s more interesting is the instances when it is named differently.</p><p>The red comet is called the bleeding star in the prophecy about Azor Ahai:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>It is written in prophecy as well. When <b>the red star bleeds</b> and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone. <br/></p><p>In Volantis, thousands of slaves and freedmen crowd the temple plaza every night to hear [the red priest] Benerro shriek of <b>bleeding</b> <b>stars\u00a0</b>and a sword of fire that will cleanse the world. <br/></p></blockquote><p>The prophecy about the promised prince also calls it that:</p><blockquote><p>\n\nBorn amidst salt and smoke, beneath <b>a bleeding</b> <b>star</b>. I know the prophecy.<br/></p></blockquote><p>Dothraki prophecy about the stallion doesn\u2019t mention comets (though it calls \u201chim\u201d a prince\u00a0and Jorah says this prince was <i>promised </i>long ago). But the bleeding star is still here:<br/></p><blockquote><p>The Dothraki named the comet shierak qiya, <b>the Bleeding</b> <b>Star</b>.\n\nThe old men muttered that it omened ill, but Daenerys Targaryen had seen it first on the night she had burned Khal Drogo, the night her dragons had awakened. \n\n <b>It is the herald of my coming,</b> she told herself as she gazed up into the night sky with wonder in her heart. <b>The gods have sent it to show me the way.\n</b>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s really neat, don\u2019t you think? And parallels nicely with impressions of people who never even think about prophecies.</p><blockquote><p>The comet was splendid and scary all at once. <b>&ldquo;The Red Sword,&rdquo;</b> the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. \u2014 Arya.<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard servants calling it <b>the Dragon&rsquo;s Tail.</b>&rdquo; \u2014 Sansa.<br/>&ldquo;<b>Dragons,</b>&rdquo; [Old Nan] said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. &ldquo;It be dragons, boy,&rdquo; she insisted. \u2014 Bran.<br/>&ldquo;That thing&rsquo;s not crimson,&rdquo; Ser Brynden said. &ldquo;Nor Tully red, the mud red of the river. <b>That&rsquo;s blood up there, </b>child, smeared across the sky.&rdquo; \u2014 Cat.</p></blockquote><p>Oh, and also! The Lightbringer, Azor Ahai\u2019s fiery sword, got its power from Nissa Nissa\u2019s life. The bleeding star heralding Azor Ahai\u2019s return appeared on the next night after Drogo died.</p><blockquote><p>When a horselord dies, his horse is slain with him, so he might ride proud into the night lands. The bodies are burned beneath the open sky, and the khal rises on his fiery steed to take his place among the stars. <b>The more fiercely the man burned in life, the brighter his star will shine in the darkness.</b><br/>Jhogo spied it first. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked and saw it, low in the east. <b>The first star was a comet, burning red. Bloodred; fire red;</b> <b>the dragon&rsquo;s tail.</b> She could not have asked for a stronger sign. <br/></p></blockquote><p>Did the bleeding star actually appear because of Drogo\u2019s death? Who knows. But this star was shining when dragons returned, and later it led Daenerys to new victories, making her the hero everyone waited for.</p><hr><p>*No really, she is the living legend already, even Jon and Tyrion aren\u2019t comparable.<br/>**Bran is different because, while he is becoming the closest thing to a god in the series, his journey is spiritual and happens invisibly for others.<br/></p>",

        "answer": "<hr><hr><p>Okay, this is just confusing to me. From where I\u2019m sitting, Dany didn\u2019t lose the argument to Jon in 7x03. In fact she very nearly won the argument. Jon only withheld his fealty to her by the narrowest of technicalities. Let\u2019s go over it:</p><p><b><i>Dany argument was basically</i></b>:</p><h2><b>D1: House Stark bent the knee to House Targaryen centuries ago and it stayed that way for centuries, so by normal feudal rules owes its fealty to House Targaryen,</b></h2><h2><b><br/>D2: I am the last Targaryen</b></h2><h2><b><br/>Conclusion: House Stark (and hence also you) owe fealty to me.</b></h2><p>This conclusion is compulsory if both D1 and D2 are accepted. Jon didn\u2019t challenge D2. He essentially presented two objections to D1.</p><p><b>Jon\u2019s first objection and Dany\u2019s response</b></p><p>Jon challenges that the last Targaryen, i.e. the Mad King was an extremely evil man and rebelling against him was not\u00a0\u201cbreaking faith\u201d with House Targaryen. In other words that the rebellion was justified.</p><p>Dany basically counters by conceding that the Mad King was evil and the rebellion justified, but that she is not guilty of her father\u2019s evil. By normal feudal rules this does not disqualify her (or House Targaryen) from her traditional inheritance. At most it only disqualifies the Mad King himself. When lower lords rebel, the lord rebelling is normally executed, but the heirs are often asked to simply bend the knee again and they are accepted into the fold. If the lord is executed for other crimes (like Jorah would have been for slaving) the heirs don\u2019t lose rights to the inheritance. Dany would even have given this chance to Dickon Tarly. Jon just reaffirmed this with the Umbers and Karstarks. So if the top person (the Mad King) is disqualified by his evil actions that does not disqualify her from her inheritance either. I don\u2019t see Dany having lost this one.</p><p><b>Jon\u2019s second objection and Dany\u2019s response</b></p><p>Jon\u2019s second challenge is to say that he is not beholden to his ancestor\u2019s vows. In other words he concedes that Torrhen\u2019s vows would indeed commit Jon to pledging to Dany. Okay, so the show has not been entirely clear on this, but it seems that there is a custom for every lord, or at least every big lord to renew their allegiance to the new King (or in this case Queen) when the new monarch is crowned. However, factually speaking, even if this is the case it is not some major decision that the new lord makes but a matter of normal procedure that is supposed to work without any hindrance. Like the Queen formally appointing the winner of the election as Prime Minister in the UK, for instance. Refusal to do this would be considered an act of rebellion against the crown nonetheless. This is essentially what Dany points out. Jon says that he doesn\u2019t know her and so doesn\u2019t know if she is not very bad either, so bad as to not be deserving of his allegiance. That is why he is sticking to what is essentially an arcane technicality to deny her fealty at this juncture.</p><p><br/></p><p>So that\u2019s how I see that argument. I don\u2019t really think Daenerys lost the argument or that it really failed in any way.</p><hr><p>A small comment on Northern independence etc. My reading of the whole declaration of independence with Robb is that the legal argument made was this:</p><h2><i>The North owed allegiance and fealty to the Dragons (Targaryens).

In other words it is a rejection of the Baratheon claim to the Iron Throne altogether and a call for a reinstatement of the order in place prior to Aegon\u2019s Conquest since the family that the actual pledge was given to are all gone. And the more interesting thing is that even the Riverlords (as Catelyn mentions, belonging to places that had never been ruled from Winterfell) can agree with this logic. Lets look again at part of Stannis\u2019 quote above:</p><p>\u201cThese pardoned lords would do well to reflect on that. <b><i>Good men and true will fight for Joffrey, wrongly believing him the true king. A northman might even say the same of Robb Stark.</i></b><i> </i>But these lords who flocked to my brother\u2019s banners knew him for a usurper. They turned their backs on their rightful king for no better reason than dreams of power and glory, and I have marked them for what they are. <br/></p><p>What is Stannis saying here? It is understandable that some may think Joffrey is Robert\u2019s true son. But how can the men declaring for Robb fall in a similar category? He has no connection to Robert Baratheon at all! It only makes sense (in my humble opinion) for Stannis to think this if he recognizes the legal logic under which the northmen might conclude that they do not owe allegiance to House Baratheon. He doesn\u2019t accept this logic, of course, but sees how it can be seen by people as legitimate. </p><p>I see antis going on and on about how Dany disrespects Robb by not seeing him as \u201cthe last King in the North.\u201d How come there are no discussions about how the Northern independence justification was essentially based on erasing Daenerys completely from the record? Because even if the Baratheons are not the heirs to the Targaryen legacy, the Targaryens are not all dead while Dany lives! How is she to accept Robb as as legitimate King when the declaration of independence is based on her erasure from the record (i.e. \u201cthe Dragons are all dead\u201d)?</p><hr><p>So since I do not acknowledge that Dany\u2019s argument failed at all, I certainly don\u2019t see her desire to regain the Targaryen inheritance, i.e. the same that other\u2019s would do (e.g. the Starks, and don\u2019t give me nonsense about Sansa only wanting her\u00a0\u2018home\u2019 i.e. Winterfell; in 6x04 she clearly said to Jon that\u00a0\u201cIf we do not take back <i><b>the North</b></i> we will never be safe\u201d\u2013<b><i>the campaign to retake Winterfell was the campaign to take the North</i></b>, Winterfell was just the central conflict) if they were pushed out of their inheritance, and the very thing all the people who came to her (Jorah, Barristan, Quentyn, and Tyrion etc.) expect that she is supposed to do as \u201cmegalomaniacal.\u201d</p><p>The major change that took place between 7x03 and 7x06 was not in legal terms but personal ones. By the end of 7x06 Jon and Dany are in love with each other. This has consequences. In 7x04 Dany is still gently encouraging him to bend the knee (in the cave). Jon\u2019s response, by the way, is no longer that he doesn\u2019t know her etc. as it was in 7x03, (it seems they have become much more familiar in the interim) but that his people won\u2019t accept it. In 7x04 Dany does not take this too seriously. But in 7x06 <b><i>she</i></b> is the one concerned about it even when Jon offers to bend to knee. <i><b>His problems</b></i> appear much more significant, weighty, and justifiable to her now than they did before. Love does that. It shows you the other person\u2019s side much more clearly and sympathetically. It increases your trust in them. In 7x04 she might have thought that Jon was just dragging his feet. In 7x06 she would not think anything like this. I sincerely think that at the end of 7x06 Jon had pursued an alternate course and started trying to ask for her hand in marriage instead, e.g.\u00a0\u201cIt would be very hard for my people to come to see you as I have in any short order, but it would be far easier for you to be their Queen if you were to consider becoming that through marriage\u201d\u2026 or perhaps something worded even better, then Dany would have been quite amenable to it. Of course Jon didn\u2019t do that. But his pledge does nothing to the love they have for each other by then, which is why she remains so receptive to his overtures afterwards as well.</p>",

I sincerely think that at the end of 7x06 Jon had pursued an alternate course and started trying to ask for her hand in marriage instead, e.g.\u00a0\u201cIt would be very hard for my people to come to see you as I have in any short order, but it would be far easier for you to be their Queen if you were to consider becoming that through marriage\u201d\u2026 or perhaps something worded even better, then Dany would have been quite amenable to it. Of course Jon didn\u2019t do that. But his pledge does nothing to the love they have for each other by then, which is why she remains so receptive to his overtures afterwards as well.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><hr /><hr /><p>Okay, this is just confusing to me. From where I&rsquo;m sitting, Dany didn&rsquo;t lose the argument to Jon in 7x03. In fact she very nearly won the argument. Jon only withheld his fealty to her by the narrowest of technicalities. Let&rsquo;s go over it:</p><p><b><i>Dany argument was basically</i></b>:</p><h2><b>D1: House Stark bent the knee to House Targaryen centuries ago and it stayed that way for centuries, so by normal feudal rules owes its fealty to House Targaryen,</b></h2><h2><b><br />D2: I am the last Targaryen</b></h2><h2><b><br />Conclusion: House Stark (and hence also you) owe fealty to me.</b></h2><p>This conclusion is compulsory if both D1 and D2 are accepted. Jon didn&rsquo;t challenge D2. He essentially presented two objections to D1.</p><p><b>Jon&rsquo;s first objection and Dany&rsquo;s response</b></p><p>Jon challenges that the last Targaryen, i.e. the Mad King was an extremely evil man and rebelling against him was not&nbsp;&ldquo;breaking faith&rdquo; with House Targaryen. In other words that the rebellion was justified.</p><p>Dany basically counters by conceding that the Mad King was evil and the rebellion justified, but that she is not guilty of her father&rsquo;s evil. By normal feudal rules this does not disqualify her (or House Targaryen) from her traditional inheritance. At most it only disqualifies the Mad King himself. When lower lords rebel, the lord rebelling is normally executed, but the heirs are often asked to simply bend the knee again and they are accepted into the fold. If the lord is executed for other crimes (like Jorah would have been for slaving) the heirs don&rsquo;t lose rights to the inheritance. Dany would even have given this chance to Dickon Tarly. Jon just reaffirmed this with the Umbers and Karstarks. So if the top person (the Mad King) is disqualified by his evil actions that does not disqualify her from her inheritance either. I don&rsquo;t see Dany having lost this one.</p><p><b>Jon&rsquo;s second objection and Dany&rsquo;s response</b></p><p>Jon&rsquo;s second challenge is to say that he is not beholden to his ancestor&rsquo;s vows. In other words he concedes that Torrhen&rsquo;s vows would indeed commit Jon to pledging to Dany. Okay, so the show has not been entirely clear on this, but it seems that there is a custom for every lord, or at least every big lord to renew their allegiance to the new King (or in this case Queen) when the new monarch is crowned. However, factually speaking, even if this is the case it is not some major decision that the new lord makes but a matter of normal procedure that is supposed to work without any hindrance. Like the Queen formally appointing the winner of the election as Prime Minister in the UK, for instance. Refusal to do this would be considered an act of rebellion against the crown nonetheless. This is essentially what Dany points out. Jon says that he doesn&rsquo;t know her and so doesn&rsquo;t know if she is not very bad either, so bad as to not be deserving of his allegiance. That is why he is sticking to what is essentially an arcane technicality to deny her fealty at this juncture.</p><p><br /></p><p>So that&rsquo;s how I see that argument. I don&rsquo;t really think Daenerys lost the argument or that it really failed in any way.</p><hr /><p>A small comment on Northern independence etc. My reading of the whole declaration of independence with Robb is that the legal argument made was this:</p><h2><i>The North owed allegiance and fealty to the Dragons (Targaryens). The Baratheons are not the Targaryens and do not have the proper right to claim that legacy. Since the Dragons are all dead, we can return to the pre-Targaryen system where we ruled ourselves.</i></h2><p>In other words, the linchpin of the legal argument was that the Baratheons were not the proper heirs to the Targaryens. And since no one was the heir to them, hence the North was free of any allegiance to them. As I have stated <i><b><a href=\"https://instantbouquetface-me.tumblr.com/search/succession\">elsewhere</a></b></i>:</p><p>The Greatjon&rsquo;s whole point is that House Baratheon has no real claim to their loyalty since they gave that loyalty to the Targaryens. In other words it is a rejection of the Baratheon claim to the Iron Throne altogether and a call for a reinstatement of the order in place prior to Aegon&rsquo;s Conquest since the family that the actual pledge was given to are all gone. And the more interesting thing is that even the Riverlords (as Catelyn mentions, belonging to places that had never been ruled from Winterfell) can agree with this logic. Lets look again at part of Stannis&rsquo; quote above:</p><p>&ldquo;These pardoned lords would do well to reflect on that. <b><i>Good men and true will fight for Joffrey, wrongly believing him the true king. A northman might even say the same of Robb Stark.</i></b><i> </i>But these lords who flocked to my brother&rsquo;s banners knew him for a usurper. They turned their backs on their rightful king for no better reason than dreams of power and glory, and I have marked them for what they are. <br /></p><p>What is Stannis saying here? It is understandable that some may think Joffrey is Robert&rsquo;s true son. But how can the men declaring for Robb fall in a similar category? He has no connection to Robert Baratheon at all! It only makes sense (in my humble opinion) for Stannis to think this if he recognizes the legal logic under which the northmen might conclude that they do not owe allegiance to House Baratheon. He doesn&rsquo;t accept this logic, of course, but sees how it can be seen by people as legitimate. </p><p>I see antis going on and on about how Dany disrespects Robb by not seeing him as &ldquo;the last King in the North.&rdquo; How come there are no discussions about how the Northern independence justification was essentially based on erasing Daenerys completely from the record? Because even if the Baratheons are not the heirs to the Targaryen legacy, the Targaryens are not all dead while Dany lives! How is she to accept Robb as as legitimate King when the declaration of independence is based on her erasure from the record (i.e. &ldquo;the Dragons are all dead&rdquo;)?</p><hr /><p>So since I do not acknowledge that Dany&rsquo;s argument failed at all, I certainly don&rsquo;t see her desire to regain the Targaryen inheritance, i.e. the same that other&rsquo;s would do (e.g. the Starks, and don&rsquo;t give me nonsense about Sansa only wanting her&nbsp;&lsquo;home&rsquo; i.e. Winterfell; in 6x04 she clearly said to Jon that&nbsp;&ldquo;If we do not take back <i><b>the North</b></i> we will never be safe&rdquo;&ndash;<b><i>the campaign to retake Winterfell was the campaign to take the North</i></b>, Winterfell was just the central conflict) if they were pushed out of their inheritance, and the very thing all the people who came to her (Jorah, Barristan, Quentyn, and Tyrion etc.) expect that she is supposed to do as &ldquo;megalomaniacal.&rdquo;</p><p>The major change that took place between 7x03 and 7x06 was not in legal terms but personal ones.

The Youtube channel Talking Thrones <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEud33zwWCA\">posted a video</a> that talks in a few of the same directions I write about here; and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1UHGTGlDDT-LfHGij5Xggg\">@oadara</a> and I discussed a lot of this between us over DM, so much of this comes out of that as well.</p><p>So there are two main prophecies most people focus on when it comes to ASOIAF/GOT, which are:\u00a0</p><p><b>- The prophecy that Maggy the Frog</b> gave to Cersei when she was a girl.\u00a0</p><p><b>- The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai prophecy</b> that talks of a coming hero who will save the world from the coming darkness.</p><p>First, let\u2019s look at <b>what George R. R. Martin himself says about prophecies</b>, particularly in fantasy fiction:</p><blockquote><p><i>Prophecy is a staple element in fantasy, but it\u2019s tricky,\u201d Martin noted. \u201cYou want to play with the notion of prophecies coming true but in an unexpected way. You want to be unpredictable about it. Shakespeare is the ultimate example of that\u2014when the forest of Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane Castle, MacBeth will fall. Everybody laughs\u2014how can the forest come to the castle. [Malcolm] came camouflaged with branches and so on. Also, during the War of the Roses, one of the lords was prophesized that he would die at a certain castle. So he always took pains to avoid that castle. But then in the first The Battle of St Albans, he was wounded and died outside a pub that had that castle on its pub sign. <b>You have to look at prophecies carefully and look at the weasel-wording.</b></i>\u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>(George R. R. Martin, <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2015/04/12/game-thrones-cersei-flashback/?asdf=&amp;hootPostID=7dbf8334a2e354db75463cc29a0cb5ca\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, 04/12/2015)</p><p>Martin is specifically talking about two types of prophecies here in the examples he gives: the <i><b>self-fulfilling prophecy</b></i> and the <i><b>non-literal prophecy</b></i>.\u00a0\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>I think it has become more and more clear that <b>Cersei\u2019s prophecy that she received from Maggy the Frog is headed in the style of a <i>self-fulfilling</i> prophecy. </b>That Cersei, in actively trying to prevent the prophecy from happening, has inevitably caused it <i>to</i> happen.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"615\" data-orig-height=\"342\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0664a2e22a0cd4f01248222187309f56/tumblr_inline_pmhd50VLin1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"615\" data-orig-height=\"342\"/></figure><p>Leaving aside the <i>Valonqar</i> part of the prophecy for now, (since the show left it out too), one point of it that people continue to argue over is who the <b>Younger, More Beautiful Queen</b> part of this prophecy refers to. However, in a way, it is actually <i>unimportant</i>. Because with a self-fulfilling prophecy, <b>the YMBQ could have been <i>anyone</i>.</b> Or, at least, any girl who had a realistic chance of becoming Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. <b>There was never one designated person it was destined to be</b>. Which means Sansa, Margaery, Daenerys and, adding in the books, you can probably place Arianne Martell in the group as well, each could have been the YMBQ. <b>The important part is/was how <i>Cersei reacted</i> to the threat of each of these women to BE the YMBQ</b>, NOT who the woman actually <i>was</i>. Because again, <i>it could have been any one of them.</i>\u00a0</p><p>For those who know Harry Potter, it is very much in line with Voldemort hearing that the person who can defeat him will be born \u201cas the seventh month dies.\u201d As HP book readers know, there were <i>two</i> boys born at the end of July - Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. It was Voldemort <i>himself</i> who picked Harry as the Chosen One when he went to kill him in Godric\u2019s Hollow on that Halloween night. However, it could have just as easily <i>not</i> been Harry if Voldemort had picked and gone to kill Neville instead. <i>Voldemort</i> chose his rival, not fate or destiny.</p><p><b>I think the YMBQ part of Cersei\u2019s prophecy is the same type of self-fulfilling\u00a0prophecy that we see in Harry Potter, where <i>Voldemort</i> <i>chose</i> his rival, but with a slight twist</b>.\u00a0With Sansa and Margaery both, Cersei <i>recognized</i> them as threats, as the potential YMBQ of the prophecy she got, and worked to neutralize them as such in any way she could think of. <b>However, the YMBQ has very likely become the person who Cersei <i>didn\u2019t</i> think of as a threat and work to stop from being one until it was actually too late: Daenerys.</b> (Though I do think Arianne Martell still might have chance to be this in the books in some way, even possibly jointly along with Daenerys, since we don\u2019t know the direction\u00a0Arianne\u2019s story will go in relation to Cersei in the books). <b>One of the underlying story threads of both the books and the show is how no one in Westeros is paying/paid all that much attention to Dany and the possible threat she poses</b>,<b> particularly to the Lannisters</b> &hellip; and possibly to Cersei herself. <b>Not until it\u2019s looking to be too late to really do anything about it.</b> Not until <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> at least, (as far as the books go), when it is now possibly too late to stop her from being one.\u00a0</p><p>Which makes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tk5hKomP4MA?t=101\">the scene in the show of <i>Joffrey</i> of all people recognizing the threat she is so early on drip with irony</a>. (Start at 1:42)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dtk5hKomP4MA%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26t%3D101\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tk5hKomP4MA?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p><b><i>Cersei</i> <i>chose</i> who the YMBQ was, by <i>not</i> choosing to see the threat one of the candidates presented to her.</b> Like Voldemort did, Cersei has/is choosing the instruments of her own destruction, and making the prophecy come true, especially by living her life actively engaging with her prophecy and trying to prevent it. </p><p>And from the little we know of him via the books and lore, this appears to have also been Rhaegar Targaryen\u2019s downfall as well, actively engaging and living his life based on a prophecy. <b>However, in Rhaegar\u2019s case, the prophecy doesn\u2019t look to be self-fulfilling so much as being a <i>non-literal</i> prophecy.</b> Non-literal prophecies are way more tricky to engage in and with, and may actually <i>lead to</i> the event that the prophecy says is destined to be <i>stopped</i>. \u00a0</p><p>We see a version of this type of prophecy (awkwardly done) in the Star Wars prequels. \u201cAnakin Skywalker is destined to destroy the Sith and bring balance to The Force.\u201d Which yes,\u00a0Anakin\u00a0<i>did</i> destroy the Sith; but only <i>after</i> he helped the Sith to destroy the Jedi and became a Sith Lord <i>himself</i>. (Which then brought balance to the force after he killed Palpatine and then he - as Vader - died as well because then the only one left was Jedi Luke, I guess? Again, I said it was <i>awkwardly</i> done, not perfectly done). So yes, if you look at that prophecy literally, Anakin Skywalker <i>did </i>destroy the Sith. It was just the nature of <i><b>why</b></i> and <i><b>how</b></i> this prophecy would come to be true and be fulfilled that was what was missing: that Anakin would help to wipe out the Jedi <i>first </i>BEFORE destroying the Sith.\u00a0</p><p>A better example of this, with the\u00a0<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique used that Martin mentions above, is another example from the Shakespeare play <i>Macbeth,</i>\u00a0and the character of Macduff. Macbeth is told by the three witches that\u00a0\u201cno man of woman born\u201d can kill him, so Macbeth goes though the play thinking that he can not be killed by any man. Turns out, however, that\u00a0Macduff was actually born via a medieval version of a c-section:</p><blockquote><p><i>And let the angel whom thou still hast served <br/>Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother\u2019s womb <br/>Untimely ripped\u00a0\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p>So Macduff technically wasn\u2019t \u201cborn\u201d in the traditional sense as known of at that time. And so yes, Macduff is the one who ultimately kills Macbeth.</p><p>And I think <i>that</i> is that type of prophecy - <b>one of non-literal interpretation - is what we are looking at when it comes to the prophecy in ASOIAF/GOT about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai.</b>\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Let me start by pointing out: <i><b>there is no Night King in the books</b></i>. In the lore of the world there is a <i>Night\u2019s</i> King (possessive S), <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_King\">who was this guy</a>:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"139\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af4ccfc39d1a4389fa35961de3fc3307/tumblr_inline_pmhek7SlTL1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"139\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><p><b>The 13th Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch</b>. Bran mentions him in <i>A Storm of Swords,</i> and <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i> talks about him as well. It is said that he was a Stark, possibly the brother of the then-current King of Winter. <b>In brief, his story was thus:</b> he saw a woman for atop the wall one night\u00a0&quot;with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars.&ldquo; He fell in love with her even though\u00a0&quot;her skin was cold as ice&rdquo; and, when he gave her his seed, he gave her his soul as well. <b>With her, he claimed the Nightfort as his castle and declared himself as King and her his Queen. There, he ruled for 13 years until the King of Winter and the King-Beyond-The-Wall brought him down</b>.\u00a0</p><p>As far as we know so far, the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King has no relation or connection to <i>this</i> guy from the show, known as the <i>Night</i> King (no possessive S):</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7e66568595e90042da76e31f0b0f0/tumblr_inline_pmiqnj3dKZ1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"/></figure><p>Not least of which because <b>their backstories are compelty different.</b> The Night King of the show was created by the Children of the Forest for their war against the First Men, which clearly happened years - if not decades - before the end of the first Long Night (which, itself, lasted a generation), the construction of The Wall and the formation of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m bringing up the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King and <i>Night</i> King difference - and that the Night King is show-only - because of one particular story point with regards to the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King that I don\u2019t want anyone confusing with the <i>Night</i> King of the show. And that is: when the Night\u2019s King was finally brought down, it was discovered that he had been making sacrifices to The Others, aka the White Walkers. The lore never <i>directly</i> says what type of sacrifices he was making to them.<b> However, given what we\u2019ve seen presented in both the books and the show, there appears to only be one type of sacrifices The Others/White Walkers have ever appeared to take: human babies.</b></p><p>As we\u2019ve seen in both the books and the show, Craster was somehow able to negotiate with The Others/White Walkers to make an agreement to sacrifice his own sons to them. So it doesn\u2019t appear to be much of a stretch to assume that the Night\u2019s King was able to make some similar type of deal to sacrifice any children he made with his Queen to them as well.\u00a0</p><p><b>So what do The Others/White Walkers want?<i>\u00a0We already know what they want. </i>The books, the lore and the show have all already told us, and even </b><i><b>shown</b></i><b> us, what\u00a0they want.</b> Twice now, they have made deals and taken human sacrifices - babies - and left the places south of the wall alone when they have received such things. There is no reason to believe that they would never do so again. <b>We just don\u2019t know <i>why</i> they want what they do, which is a different question than asking <i>what</i> they want.\u00a0</b></p><p>So, knowing this, how might this tie into the prophecy of\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>First off, in the books, the wording of the prophecy falls very much into the\u00a0<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique that Martin himself talks about. Because the person who speaks the most about the prophecy, Melisandre, talks about the prophecy being about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised <i>and</i> Azor Ahai <i>interchangeably</i>. Her talking about the prophecy in this way gives the impression that\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai are one-in-the-same, and one is just another name for the other.</p><p><b>However, what if that is not the case.</b> Now, it\u2019s complicated because the show has never either mentioned nor referred to\u00a0Azor Ahai, (except for possibly as just an easter egg in a book Gilly is seen reading in S7), but has used the wording more associated with\u00a0Azor Ahai to talk about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised.\u00a0</p><p>Another problem is that there is no one-description of what the prophecy actually <i>is</i>. In <i>A Storm of Swords</i> (<b>Davos III</b>),\u00a0Melisandre says this:</p><blockquote><p><i>When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.</i>\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Pretty straight forward. But again,<b> this talks about\u00a0Azor Ahai being reborn and how, <i>not </i>saying anything about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised, or them being the same person.</b>\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>And then, of course, there is the gender pronoun confusion</b>, which is mentioned both in the books and the show,<b> both</b> <b>dealing with the mistranslation about The Prince Who Was Promised</b>. Maester Aemon in <i>A Feast For Crows</i>\u00a0(<b>Samwell IV</b>) says:</p><blockquote><p><i>What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. <b>Dragons are neither male nor female,</b> Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years.</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>The prophecy originally having been made using the word for <i>dragon</i> in High Valyrian, and dragons, by nature, have no fixed gender. (The lore giving various opinions of if dragons can continually change sex at will or not. The only real way to tell if a dragon is male or female is if it lays eggs or not).\u00a0</p><p>And in the show (<b>Episode 7x02</b>) Missandei says:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>That noun has no gender in High Valyrian.</b> The proper translation for that prophecy would be, \u2018the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.\u2019</i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p><b>So what we have here is not only confusion as to whether or not Azor Ahai reborn is supposed to be the same person as The Prince Who Was Promised, but also <i>gender confusion</i> about <b>The Prince Who Was Promised\u00a0</b>because High Valyrian nouns are not gender specific.</b> On top of which, the show has only talked opening about The Prince Who Was Promised, but made no mention of Azor Ahai and him possibly being reborn <i>as</i> the prince who was promised or not.</p><p>Then of course, also from the books, <b>we have the knowledge that a song was composed for The Prince Who Was Promised</b>, which is called/known as\u00a0\u201cthe song of ice and fire\u201d which Daenerys learns of in her vision in the House of the Undying. (<i>ACOK</i>, <b>Daenerys IV</b>)\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>I\u2019m not the first person to suggest that The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai reborn are two different people</b> and that, between the mistranslations and gender confusion, the two things got mixed up together. But to make it clear, I\u2019d say <b>Azor Ahai is the one who will be reborn via salt and smoke who will wake dragons from stone</b>, and that <b>The Prince Who Was Promised is a separate prophecy, and person, and is the one who \u201cwill bring the dawn.\u201d\u00a0</b></p><p>So what does this have to do with The Others/White Walkers? Well, this is where more of that that <i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique Martin calls it comes in. In that what if The Prince Who Was Promised was actually promised <i>to</i> something - or someone. Namely, The Others/White Walkers. And what if it was a promise Azor Ahai <i>himself </i>made to them? It would go a ways to explain why the two are always connected to each other</p><p>If you look at the actual history of the First Long Night,\u00a0<b>Azor Ahai never actually\u00a0</b><i><b>defeated</b></i><b> The Others/White Walkers. He and the members of the first Night\u2019s Watch were able to drive them back, and had them flee into the Lands of Always Winter, but they were never defeated completely.</b> Which is why The Wall was built in the first place and The Night\u2019s Watch established - to guard <i>against</i> The Others/White Walkers coming back south and taking over the realms of Men as they did during the First Long Night.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"938\" data-orig-height=\"412\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be496d497142e862a19df7c6a121b16c/tumblr_inline_pobg04Kybu1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"938\" data-orig-height=\"412\"/></figure><p><b>So what if it was Azor Ahai himself who promised this\u00a0\u201cprince\u201d to The Others/White Walker as a way to keep them from trying to invade the realms of Men another time?</b> Again, via both the 13th LC of the NW and Craster, we know making pacts/deals with The Others/White Walkers is possible in some way. <b>So, who is this\u00a0\u201cprince who was promised\u201d? Yeah, I could just say Jon Snow, (because that\u2019s what it likely looks like I\u2019m about to say), but actually no, what if it\u2019s <i>not</i> him? Or, more specifically, what if it was <i>supposed</i> to be him but, once again, the prophecy got slightly misinterpted?</b></p><p>Put a pin in this. We\u2019ll come back to it. For now, let&rsquo;s go back to the 13th LC and Craster.</p><p>According to Old Nan, the 13th LC was a Stark, meaning he contained the blood of the First Men. <b>The blood of the First Men is thought to carry some magical properties, particularly within the Stark family bloodline, which contain warging and greenseer abilities.</b> And the Stark Kings of old were known as the Kings of Winter. So by the 13th LC likely sacrificing children of his blood that he made with his Night\u2019s Queen, he was providing The Others/White Walkers children that carried a strong magical element in their blood.</p><p><b>Throughout the story and the lore, the Stark are also associated with Ice. Even their Great Valyrian Sword is called simply\u00a0\u201cIce.\u201d\u00a0</b><br/></p><p><b>With Craster</b>, <b>things are less certain there wrt the magical elements. </b>Wildlings, which his mother was said to be, are also of the Blood of the First men, but it is not clear if the magical element is a strong among the Wildings as it is with the Starks. <b>The main point, however, is that The Others/White Walkers accepted Craster\u2019s sons as offerings, just as they did from the Night&rsquo;s King/13th LC. So they were clearly deemed as acceptable in that regard.</b>\u00a0Because, at the very least, they carried the blood of the First Men in them, from Craster\u2019s Wildling mother.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>[<b>Side Note:</b> <b>There is probably going to be a plot-hole in the show wrt Craster\u2019s kids - Gilly\u2019s baby Little Sam specifically. Because, in the books, there is a baby-switching plot going on with Gilly\u2019s baby</b>, (he isn\u2019t named Little Sam in the books, he\u2019s just referred to as\u00a0<i>Monster</i> instead), <b>and Mance Rayder\u2019s baby son.</b> (Yes, Mance has a baby son in the books). Jon more or less forced Gilly to switch her son with Mance\u2019s baby son to try and protect Mance\u2019s son from possibly being killed/burned to death. So that is the fate that might actually befall Gilly\u2019s baby son in the books while Jon is still currently dead, leaving NONE of Craster\u2019s sons alive after that.]\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>So what we have here are two instances of sacrifices to The Others being made and accepted by the Others/White Walkers. And again, the only thing we\u2019ve seen The Others/White Walkers take as a sacrifice are babies.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s go back and look at The Prince Who Was Promised and, more specifically, the thing Rhaegar says about the song composed for him, specifically called\u00a0\u201cThe Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d As we all know, that is the actual title of Martin\u2019s book series that the tv show <i>Game of Thrones</i> is based on. And, of course, <b>Jon being the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark have many thinking he is \u201cThe Prince Who Was Promised\u201d and the\u00a0\u201csong of ice and fire\u201d because of his blood combination.</b> <b>However, there is another thing in the lore with the title Ice and Fire in it that is being overlooked here </b>that I think is very significant, particularly wrt The Others/White Walkers.</p><p>And that is,<b>\u00a0<i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i></b>.\u00a0</p><p><i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> was a pact forged between House Stark and House Targaryen, (more specifically the black faction of House Targaryen during the Dance of Dragons). <b>As it is described in <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i>, it was an agreement between the two houses that a Stark male would wed a Targaryen Princess.</b> (The recent book<i> Fire and Blood</i> gives more of an account and specifics of <i>who </i>the Princess would be &hellip; or, at least, who her <i>father</i> was supposed to be). The pact, however, was never fulfilled after The Dance ended.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>What is the significant part of this is what House Stark was specifically asking for, which was a Targaryen <i>princess</i>. Cregan Stark specifically wanted a young Targaryen\u00a0<i>girl</i> to wed into the Stark family.\u00a0</p><p>As explained above, via both the books/lore and the show, <b>the Starks have a connection to the happenings with The Others/White Walkers.</b>\u00a0We have the story of the 13 Lord Commander/Night\u2019s King. We know about Bran the Builder who, with the help of the Children of the Forest (and giants) helped raise the wall to guard against them invading again.<b> I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to believe that the Kings of Winter of ages past, as the Stark Kings were first called, not only <i>knew</i> about \u201cThe Prince Who Was Promised,\u201d but likely also what the true meaning of what this prince/princess\u00a0<i>being</i> promised was all about.</b> That whomever this prince/princess was, when born, they would be given to the The Others, who had been promised to them by\u00a0Azor Ahai.\u00a0</p><p>So what might this have to do with the <i>Pact of Ice and Fire</i> and requesting a Targaryen princess to marry into House Stark? I think a clue comes from Book 2, <i>A Clash of Kings</i>, and Daenerys\u2019 encounter with The Undying in the House of the Undying.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"200\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f51c4054946c4c1a6b8cd02f3f7bd89c/tumblr_inline_pobikwIDyK1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"200\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><p>In ACOK, the Undying Ones are described in a way that has them seeming to be a representation of The Others/White Walkers; with them being described as\u00a0\u201cblue and cold.\u201d And then there is this passage, where they try to consume Daenerys (<b>Daenerys IV, ACOK</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>They wanted her, needed her<b>, the fire, the life, </b>and Dany gasped and opened her arms to give herself to them \u2026</i></p><p><i>But then black wings buffeted her round the head, and a scream of fury cut the <b>indigo air</b>, and suddenly the visions were gone, ripped away, and Dany\u2019s gasp turned to horror. <b>The Undying were all around her,</b> <b>blue and cold</b>, whispering as they reached for her, pulling, stroking, tugging at her clothes, touching her with their <b>dry cold hands</b>, twining their fingers through her hair. All the strength had left her limbs. She could not move. <b>Even her heart had ceased to beat.</b> She felt a hand on her bare breast, twisting her nipple. Teeth found the soft skin of her throat. A mouth descended on one eye, licking, sucking, biting \u2026</i></p><p><i><b><i>Then indigo</i></b><i> turned to <b>orange</b>, and whispers turned to screams. <b>Her heart was pounding, racing, the hands and mouths were gone</b>, heat washed over her skin, and Dany blinked at a sudden glare. <b>Perched above her, the dragon spread his wings and</b> <b>tore at the terrible dark heart, ripping the rotten flesh to ribbons</b>, and when his head snapped forward, <b>fire flew from his open jaws, bright and hot</b>. She could hear the shrieks of the Undying as they burned, their high thin papery voices crying out in tongues long dead. \u201c</i><br/></i></p></blockquote><p>Here we have the Undying, who are described in terms of cold and death, linking them in many way to The Others/White Walkers, trying to consume the fire - which is linked to life - of Daenerys. (And they almost succeeded until Drogon saves her).\u00a0</p><p><b>There is indication that The Undying have been waiting for Daenerys for thousands of years before this moment.</b> <b>They want the lifeforce, <i>the fire</i> that she has, when she finally comes. </b>So what we have here are creatures associated with imagery of - and visually linked to - creatures of death, (The Others/White Walkers), trying to to consume a life,<b><i> the fire</i></b>, from someone of Valyrian descent. <b>Valyrian blood constantly linked to that of fire, and fire, throughout\u00a0the series, is linked to life.</b> House Targaryen\u2019s own words (a house motto they chose when Aegon the Conqueror first began his conquest and wanted his family to adopt more Westerosi culture BTW - they never had a House motto before that) is <i>Fire and Blood</i>, two images also associated with life.\u00a0</p><p><b>Just like The Undying, The Others/White Walkers also appear to be seeking life of some kind.</b> The taking of babies, and then using those babies to create more of their kind by turning them into Others/White Walkers I think ties into this. However, they very well might be something missing from what they seek out of this. A life-force that contains what The Undying were trying to <i>take</i> from Daenerys - <i>a fire</i>.\u00a0</p><p>How is a new life <i>usually</i> created? Male and Female coming together. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nIbFw-brBvw?t=70\"><i>Melisandre alludes to the power of that ability - to create life - in the scene when she tries to seduce Jon in Season 5</i></a> (<b>Episode 5x04</b>) (Start at: 1:10)\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FnIbFw-brBvw%3Ft%3D70\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nIbFw-brBvw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>And then of course, there is the quote from the book that she says in this seduction scene (which wasn\u2019t a seduction scene in the book btw), from <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> (<b>Jon VI</b>):\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>The Lord of Light in his wisdom made us male and female, two parts of a greater whole. In our joining there is power. Power to make life. Power to make light. Power to cast shadows.</i></p></blockquote><p>I think the show was being a bit more hard-hitting in the foreshadowing than the book by having Melisandre say these words while appearing to try and <i>seduce</i> Jon. <b>That there is power in the ability - in the <i>act</i> - of men and women coming together and creating life. </b>Unlike The Others/White Walkers, who can only create more of themselves by taking an already living creation - in this case, a child - and turning them into a being like them, a being of the cold.\u00a0</p><p>Yet, even with the power of men and women to do this, The Undying specifically were waiting for and sought out <i>Daenerys</i> for that life, <i>that fire</i>, that they needed. <b>And that may be because, while both male and female coming together can create life and light, it is the <i>female</i> who brings forth that light and life\u00a0<i>into</i> the world via childbirth.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>There is a running theme of motherhood, and what that means, throughout\u00a0Daenerys\u2019 story. She is called Mhysa by the people she liberated from slavery and metaphorically\u00a0giving\u00a0them new life as free\u00a0people. She birthed creatures that are considered to be fire made flesh via</b><i> <b>fire itself</b></i><b>.</b></p><p>I think <i>this</i> is why <i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> called for a Targaryen <i>princess</i> to wed into House Stark. <b>That the need for a joining of Ice and Fire had to specially be that the fruits of that joining, the life created from it, be <i>born</i> of fire; </b>born via a daughter - a female - who carried such fire within her, which those of Valyrian descent do.\u00a0</p><p>And this is where Rhaegar Targaryen made one of his many mistakes when it comes to the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. At some point I do think Rhaegar thought he needed a child who was - bloodline-wise - of\u00a0\u201cice and fire.\u201d <b>Rhaegar had already changed his life twice-over trying to fulfill the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. There is no reason to assume he wouldn\u2019t have done it again if he came into more info about it. </b>For all he did likley love Lyanna, I think it\u2019s probable that he also saw their child as the one who would make this prophecy he\u2019d been chasing most of his life come true &hellip; after first thinking it was about himself, and then thinking it would be about his three children he would (hopefully) have, and the idea that \u201cthe dragon has three heads.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>However, again, Rhaegar was incorrect, not just about what the whole idea of The Prince That Was Promised actually meant, but how the blood combination of Ice and Fire was supposed to be &hellip; or, more specifically, how the child had to be born. <b>Because Lyanna wasn\u2019t fire, or the blood of fire. She was of </b><i><b>ice</b>, </i><b>with the blood of the First Men within her, not the blood of Old Valyria. And the Prince Who Was Promised more than likely\u00a0had to be born of <i>fire</i>, via a female </b><i><b>with the blood of fire</b>.</i></p><p>From <i>A Game of Thrones</i> (<b>Daenerys X</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>No, she wanted to shout to him, no my good knight, do not fear for me. <b>The fire is mine.</b> I am Daenerys Stormborn, <b>daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons</b>, don\u2019t you see? Don\u2019t you SEE?</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Blood of the Dragon</i> are what those of blood of Old Valyria are called. Dragons are fire made flesh. Those of the blood Old Valyria, the Targaryens, like dragons, are also likely fire made flesh. And <i>fire</i> is life and light.\u00a0</p><p><b>And the coming together of <i>that </i>fire with ice is symbolic of <i>balance.</i></b>\u00a0From <i>A Clash of Kings</i> (<b>Daenerys IV</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I have come for the gift of truth,&rdquo; Dany said. &ldquo;In the long hall, the things I saw &hellip; were they true visions, or lies?

Nobody knows who he was before \u2014 a soldier or part of [nobility]. He never wanted to be the Night King. I think he wants revenge. Everybody in this story has two sides \u2014 a bad side and a good side. The Night King only has one side, a bad side.</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>Thinking the Night King wants revenge isn\u2019t the same as that being what he definitely wants. <b>However, the idea that the Night King only has a bad side seems to fit with the view of what The Great Other is and represents in the books/lore, which is the god of darkness and death. </b>However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that cut and dry even via what The Great Other/Night King is. Because evil acts can be committed by those who fight for the light, such as good acts can likely be committed by those who fight for darkness/death. Melisandre\u2019s burning of Shireen Baratheon, which Martin has already confirmed will happen in the books as well, is proof enough of that. \u00a0</p><p>Also, from the recent interview, there is this:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>What can we expect from him in the final season?</b></i></p><p><i>People will see he has a target he wants to kill, and you will find out who that is. There\u2019s also that moment [in \u201cHardhome\u201d] when Jon Snow was on the boat and the Night King looked at him and raised his arms \u2014 there\u2019s a similar and even stronger moment between Jon and the Night King this time.</i> \u00a0</p></blockquote><p><b>I think it\u2019s pretty clear that that target <i>isn\u2019t </i>Jon Snow. He had more than one opportunity to kill Jon, but proceeded instead to mostly just taunt him.</b> I don\u2019t think the target is Daenerys either, or he could have easily killed Drogon and gotten her when she came beyond the wall in Episode 6 of Season 7.</p><p>The Three-eyed Raven/Crow being the target - with that now being Bran, is an option I admit, however &hellip; the original Three-Eyed Raven/Crow, who was Brynden Rivers aka Bloodraven, had been the Three-Eyed Raven/Crow for many years, and there is little to no indication that The Night King was actively trying to kill him during any of that time.</p><p><b>However, what if the killing of the target doesn\u2019t mean just \u201cto kill,\u201d so much in the sense of what we saw happen to the former Three-Eyed Raven in the show,</b> <b>but is more in the vein of what happened to Daenerys in the House of the Undying in the books, when the Undying tried to take her life-force from her.</b></p><p>And the person they want to do this with is actually the <i>child</i> Daenerys and Jon will/have created?</p><p><b>Because the foreshadowing that Jon and Daenerys will have a child in the coming season was pretty obvious, not to mention Daenerys whole underlying story theme and motif of motherhood. </b>Also, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CczKaabSRfU?t=76\">do not overlook this clip, which HBO chose to highlight before the start of Season 8,</a> where Viserys makes this comment about the child that Dany is set to have with Khal Drogo (<b>Episode 1x06</b>) (Start: 1:16):</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCczKaabSRfU%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26t%3D76\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CczKaabSRfU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><blockquote><p><i>He won\u2019t be a real Targaryen.

(In fact, I think Jon\u2019s going to learn a hard lesson about that when the baby switching plot he instigated wrt Gilly\u2019s baby in the books plays out to a tragic end for Gilly\u2019s baby). <b>If they can find a way to defeat The Others/White Walkers without having to make such a sacrifice and basically taking the easy way out to do so, they may also guarantee that this time, The Others/White Walkers will truly be destroyed and gone forever this time.</b> Instead of what Azor Ahai did, which only seemed to have the go into some kind of slumber and dormancy, and staying in the lands beyond the wall.</p><p><b>However, there may be some among Jon and Daenerys\u2019 army and/or advisors who would want to take the easy route and give the child over to end the conflict quickly</b>, which - while pushing off the problem again for another couple of thousands years - could prevent many people from dying and becoming a part of the Army of the Dead and overrunning Westeros as was what happened during the first Long Night. (Which didn\u2019t stay limited to only Westeros, but spread over almost all of Essos as well).</p><p>In the show, Daenerys\u2019 story has a theme about wanting to\u00a0\u201cbreak the wheel\u201d; the wheel being the nature of the political dynamics of Westeros that benefits the more Noble Classes that fight for power and dominance, symbolized by the Iron Throne, and those who do not benefit from that ongoing struggle, which are the lower classes and smallfolk of Westeros. They are the ones who are always crushed underneath this wheel, this circular nature of the political power fights and wars.\u00a0</p><p><b>However, this idea of\u00a0\u201cbreaking the wheel\u201d may also, in the end, extend to the fight against The Others/White Walkers.</b> As noted, this is not the first time they have invaded the realms of men. And, the last time they did, they were not defeated. The problem they are, the threat they pose, seems to have been pushed off to another generation to have to fight, combat and deal with. And at the center of that fight to do so might just rest with Ice and Fire coming together to create something new. <b>However, the prophecy that has dictated the lives of many people that has lead to this, has never dictated the lives of the two people who may have the most influence in The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy coming to fruition. </b>Neither Jon or Daenerys have lived their lives or made decisions in their lives sorley to fulfil a prophecy. <b>And given what was very likely the <i>weasel-wording</i> technique used for The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy, the fact that they did so may, in the end, be the deciding factor in the breaking of <i>another</i> wheel, another cycle of destruction.</b>\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"650\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7a30aee294fcf2ca367f6036e2f18/tumblr_inline_podb5g0cdu1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"650\"/></figure>",

However, in a way, it is actually <i>unimportant</i>. Because with a self-fulfilling prophecy, <b>the YMBQ could have been <i>anyone</i>.</b> Or, at least, any girl who had a realistic chance of becoming Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. <b>There was never one designated person it was destined to be</b>. Which means Sansa, Margaery, Daenerys and, adding in the books, you can probably place Arianne Martell in the group as well, each could have been the YMBQ. <b>The important part is/was how <i>Cersei reacted</i> to the threat of each of these women to BE the YMBQ</b>, NOT who the woman actually <i>was</i>. Because again, <i>it could have been any one of them.</i>\u00a0</p><p>For those who know Harry Potter, it is very much in line with Voldemort hearing that the person who can defeat him will be born \u201cas the seventh month dies.\u201d As HP book readers know, there were <i>two</i> boys born at the end of July - Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. It was Voldemort <i>himself</i> who picked Harry as the Chosen One when he went to kill him in Godric\u2019s Hollow on that Halloween night. However, it could have just as easily <i>not</i> been Harry if Voldemort had picked and gone to kill Neville instead. <i>Voldemort</i> chose his rival, not fate or destiny.</p><p><b>I think the YMBQ part of Cersei\u2019s prophecy is the same type of self-fulfilling\u00a0prophecy that we see in Harry Potter, where <i>Voldemort</i> <i>chose</i> his rival, but with a slight twist</b>.\u00a0With Sansa and Margaery both, Cersei <i>recognized</i> them as threats, as the potential YMBQ of the prophecy she got, and worked to neutralize them as such in any way she could think of. <b>However, the YMBQ has very likely become the person who Cersei <i>didn\u2019t</i> think of as a threat and work to stop from being one until it was actually too late: Daenerys.</b> (Though I do think Arianne Martell still might have chance to be this in the books in some way, even possibly jointly along with Daenerys, since we don\u2019t know the direction\u00a0Arianne\u2019s story will go in relation to Cersei in the books). <b>One of the underlying story threads of both the books and the show is how no one in Westeros is paying/paid all that much attention to Dany and the possible threat she poses</b>,<b> particularly to the Lannisters</b> \u2026 and possibly to Cersei herself. <b>Not until it\u2019s looking to be too late to really do anything about it.</b> Not until <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> at least, (as far as the books go), when it is now possibly too late to stop her from being one.\u00a0</p><p>Which makes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tk5hKomP4MA?t=101\">the scene in the show of <i>Joffrey</i> of all people recognizing the threat she is so early on drip with irony</a>. (Start at 1:42)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dtk5hKomP4MA%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26t%3D101\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tk5hKomP4MA?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p><b><i>Cersei</i> <i>chose</i> who the YMBQ was, by <i>not</i> choosing to see the threat one of the candidates presented to her.</b> Like Voldemort did, Cersei has/is choosing the instruments of her own destruction, and making the prophecy come true, especially by living her life actively engaging with her prophecy and trying to prevent it. </p><p>And from the little we know of him via the books and lore, this appears to have also been Rhaegar Targaryen\u2019s downfall as well, actively engaging and living his life based on a prophecy. <b>However, in Rhaegar\u2019s case, the prophecy doesn\u2019t look to be self-fulfilling so much as being a <i>non-literal</i> prophecy.</b> Non-literal prophecies are way more tricky to engage in and with, and may actually <i>lead to</i> the event that the prophecy says is destined to be <i>stopped</i>. \u00a0</p><p>We see a version of this type of prophecy (awkwardly done) in the Star Wars prequels. \u201cAnakin Skywalker is destined to destroy the Sith and bring balance to The Force.\u201d Which yes,\u00a0Anakin\u00a0<i>did</i> destroy the Sith; but only <i>after</i> he helped the Sith to destroy the Jedi and became a Sith Lord <i>himself</i>. (Which then brought balance to the force after he killed Palpatine and then he - as Vader - died as well because then the only one left was Jedi Luke, I guess? Again, I said it was <i>awkwardly</i> done, not perfectly done). So yes, if you look at that prophecy literally, Anakin Skywalker <i>did </i>destroy the Sith. It was just the nature of <i><b>why</b></i> and <i><b>how</b></i> this prophecy would come to be true and be fulfilled that was what was missing: that Anakin would help to wipe out the Jedi <i>first </i>BEFORE destroying the Sith.\u00a0</p><p>A better example of this, with the\u00a0<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique used that Martin mentions above, is another example from the Shakespeare play <i>Macbeth,</i>\u00a0and the character of Macduff. Macbeth is told by the three witches that\u00a0\u201cno man of woman born\u201d can kill him, so Macbeth goes though the play thinking that he can not be killed by any man. Turns out, however, that\u00a0Macduff was actually born via a medieval version of a c-section:</p><blockquote><p><i>And let the angel whom thou still hast served <br>Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother\u2019s womb <br>Untimely ripped\u00a0\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p>So Macduff technically wasn\u2019t \u201cborn\u201d in the traditional sense as known of at that time. And so yes, Macduff is the one who ultimately kills Macbeth.</p><p>And I think <i>that</i> is that type of prophecy - <b>one of non-literal interpretation - is what we are looking at when it comes to the prophecy in ASOIAF/GOT about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai.</b>\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Let me start by pointing out: <i><b>there is no Night King in the books</b></i>. In the lore of the world there is a <i>Night\u2019s</i> King (possessive S), <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_King\">who was this guy</a>:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"139\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af4ccfc39d1a4389fa35961de3fc3307/tumblr_inline_pmhek7SlTL1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"139\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p><b>The 13th Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch</b>. Bran mentions him in <i>A Storm of Swords,</i> and <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i> talks about him as well. It is said that he was a Stark, possibly the brother of the then-current King of Winter. <b>In brief, his story was thus:</b> he saw a woman for atop the wall one night\u00a0\"with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars.\u201c He fell in love with her even though\u00a0\"her skin was cold as ice\u201d and, when he gave her his seed, he gave her his soul as well. <b>With her, he claimed the Nightfort as his castle and declared himself as King and her his Queen. There, he ruled for 13 years until the King of Winter and the King-Beyond-The-Wall brought him down</b>.\u00a0</p><p>As far as we know so far, the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King has no relation or connection to <i>this</i> guy from the show, known as the <i>Night</i> King (no possessive S):</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7e66568595e90042da76e31f0b0f0/tumblr_inline_pmiqnj3dKZ1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"></figure><p>Not least of which because <b>their backstories are compelty different.</b> The Night King of the show was created by the Children of the Forest for their war against the First Men, which clearly happened years - if not decades - before the end of the first Long Night (which, itself, lasted a generation), the construction of The Wall and the formation of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m bringing up the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King and <i>Night</i> King difference - and that the Night King is show-only - because of one particular story point with regards to the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King that I don\u2019t want anyone confusing with the <i>Night</i> King of the show. And that is: when the Night\u2019s King was finally brought down, it was discovered that he had been making sacrifices to The Others, aka the White Walkers. The lore never <i>directly</i> says what type of sacrifices he was making to them.<b> However, given what we\u2019ve seen presented in both the books and the show, there appears to only be one type of sacrifices The Others/White Walkers have ever appeared to take: human babies.</b></p><p>As we\u2019ve seen in both the books and the show, Craster was somehow able to negotiate with The Others/White Walkers to make an agreement to sacrifice his own sons to them. So it doesn\u2019t appear to be much of a stretch to assume that the Night\u2019s King was able to make some similar type of deal to sacrifice any children he made with his Queen to them as well.\u00a0</p><p><b>So what do The Others/White Walkers want?<i>\u00a0We already know what they want. </i>The books, the lore and the show have all already told us, and even </b><i><b>shown</b></i><b> us, what\u00a0they want.</b> Twice now, they have made deals and taken human sacrifices - babies - and left the places south of the wall alone when they have received such things. There is no reason to believe that they would never do so again. <b>We just don\u2019t know <i>why</i> they want what they do, which is a different question than asking <i>what</i> they want.\u00a0</b></p><p>So, knowing this, how might this tie into the prophecy of\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>First off, in the books, the wording of the prophecy falls very much into the\u00a0<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique that Martin himself talks about. Because the person who speaks the most about the prophecy, Melisandre, talks about the prophecy being about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised <i>and</i> Azor Ahai <i>interchangeably</i>. Her talking about the prophecy in this way gives the impression that\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai are one-in-the-same, and one is just another name for the other.</p><p><b>However, what if that is not the case.</b> Now, it\u2019s complicated because the show has never either mentioned nor referred to\u00a0Azor Ahai, (except for possibly as just an easter egg in a book Gilly is seen reading in S7), but has used the wording more associated with\u00a0Azor Ahai to talk about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised.\u00a0</p><p>Another problem is that there is no one-description of what the prophecy actually <i>is</i>. In <i>A Storm of Swords</i> (<b>Davos III</b>),\u00a0Melisandre says this:</p><blockquote><p><i>When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.</i>\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Pretty straight forward. But again,<b> this talks about\u00a0Azor Ahai being reborn and how, <i>not </i>saying anything about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised, or them being the same person.</b>\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>And then, of course, there is the gender pronoun confusion</b>, which is mentioned both in the books and the show,<b> both</b> <b>dealing with the mistranslation about The Prince Who Was Promised</b>. Maester Aemon in <i>A Feast For Crows</i>\u00a0(<b>Samwell IV</b>) says:</p><blockquote><p><i>What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. <b>Dragons are neither male nor female,</b> Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years.</i><br></p></blockquote><p>The prophecy originally having been made using the word for <i>dragon</i> in High Valyrian, and dragons, by nature, have no fixed gender. (The lore giving various opinions of if dragons can continually change sex at will or not. The only real way to tell if a dragon is male or female is if it lays eggs or not).\u00a0</p><p>And in the show (<b>Episode 7x02</b>) Missandei says:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>That noun has no gender in High Valyrian.</b> The proper translation for that prophecy would be, \u2018the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.\u2019</i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p><b>So what we have here is not only confusion as to whether or not Azor Ahai reborn is supposed to be the same person as The Prince Who Was Promised, but also <i>gender confusion</i> about <b>The Prince Who Was Promised\u00a0</b>because High Valyrian nouns are not gender specific.</b> On top of which, the show has only talked opening about The Prince Who Was Promised, but made no mention of Azor Ahai and him possibly being reborn <i>as</i> the prince who was promised or not.</p><p>Then of course, also from the books, <b>we have the knowledge that a song was composed for The Prince Who Was Promised</b>, which is called/known as\u00a0\u201cthe song of ice and fire\u201d which Daenerys learns of in her vision in the House of the Undying. (<i>ACOK</i>, <b>Daenerys IV</b>)\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>I\u2019m not the first person to suggest that The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai reborn are two different people</b> and that, between the mistranslations and gender confusion, the two things got mixed up together. But to make it clear, I\u2019d say <b>Azor Ahai is the one who will be reborn via salt and smoke who will wake dragons from stone</b>, and that <b>The Prince Who Was Promised is a separate prophecy, and person, and is the one who \u201cwill bring the dawn.\u201d\u00a0</b></p><p>So what does this have to do with The Others/White Walkers? Well, this is where more of that that <i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique Martin calls it comes in. In that what if The Prince Who Was Promised was actually promised <i>to</i> something - or someone. Namely, The Others/White Walkers. And what if it was a promise Azor Ahai <i>himself </i>made to them? It would go a ways to explain why the two are always connected to each other</p><p>If you look at the actual history of the First Long Night,\u00a0<b>Azor Ahai never actually\u00a0</b><i><b>defeated</b></i><b> The Others/White Walkers. He and the members of the first Night\u2019s Watch were able to drive them back, and had them flee into the Lands of Always Winter, but they were never defeated completely.</b> Which is why The Wall was built in the first place and The Night\u2019s Watch established - to guard <i>against</i> The Others/White Walkers coming back south and taking over the realms of Men as they did during the First Long Night.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"938\" data-orig-height=\"412\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be496d497142e862a19df7c6a121b16c/tumblr_inline_pobg04Kybu1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"938\" data-orig-height=\"412\"></figure><p><b>So what if it was Azor Ahai himself who promised this\u00a0\u201cprince\u201d to The Others/White Walker as a way to keep them from trying to invade the realms of Men another time?</b> Again, via both the 13th LC of the NW and Craster, we know making pacts/deals with The Others/White Walkers is possible in some way. <b>So, who is this\u00a0\u201cprince who was promised\u201d? Yeah, I could just say Jon Snow, (because that\u2019s what it likely looks like I\u2019m about to say), but actually no, what if it\u2019s <i>not</i> him? Or, more specifically, what if it was <i>supposed</i> to be him but, once again, the prophecy got slightly misinterpted?</b></p><p>Put a pin in this. We\u2019ll come back to it. For now, let\u2019s go back to the 13th LC and Craster.</p><p>According to Old Nan, the 13th LC was a Stark, meaning he contained the blood of the First Men. <b>The blood of the First Men is thought to carry some magical properties, particularly within the Stark family bloodline, which contain warging and greenseer abilities.</b> And the Stark Kings of old were known as the Kings of Winter. So by the 13th LC likely sacrificing children of his blood that he made with his Night\u2019s Queen, he was providing The Others/White Walkers children that carried a strong magical element in their blood.</p><p><b>Throughout the story and the lore, the Stark are also associated with Ice. Even their Great Valyrian Sword is called simply\u00a0\u201cIce.\u201d\u00a0</b><br></p><p><b>With Craster</b>, <b>things are less certain there wrt the magical elements. </b>Wildlings, which his mother was said to be, are also of the Blood of the First men, but it is not clear if the magical element is a strong among the Wildings as it is with the Starks. <b>The main point, however, is that The Others/White Walkers accepted Craster\u2019s sons as offerings, just as they did from the Night\u2019s King/13th LC. So they were clearly deemed as acceptable in that regard.</b>\u00a0Because, at the very least, they carried the blood of the First Men in them, from Craster\u2019s Wildling mother.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>[<b>Side Note:</b> <b>There is probably going to be a plot-hole in the show wrt Craster\u2019s kids - Gilly\u2019s baby Little Sam specifically. Because, in the books, there is a baby-switching plot going on with Gilly\u2019s baby</b>, (he isn\u2019t named Little Sam in the books, he\u2019s just referred to as\u00a0<i>Monster</i> instead), <b>and Mance Rayder\u2019s baby son.</b> (Yes, Mance has a baby son in the books). Jon more or less forced Gilly to switch her son with Mance\u2019s baby son to try and protect Mance\u2019s son from possibly being killed/burned to death. So that is the fate that might actually befall Gilly\u2019s baby son in the books while Jon is still currently dead, leaving NONE of Craster\u2019s sons alive after that.]\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>So what we have here are two instances of sacrifices to The Others being made and accepted by the Others/White Walkers. And again, the only thing we\u2019ve seen The Others/White Walkers take as a sacrifice are babies.</p><p>Now let\u2019s go back and look at The Prince Who Was Promised and, more specifically, the thing Rhaegar says about the song composed for him, specifically called\u00a0\u201cThe Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d As we all know, that is the actual title of Martin\u2019s book series that the tv show <i>Game of Thrones</i> is based on. And, of course, <b>Jon being the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark have many thinking he is \u201cThe Prince Who Was Promised\u201d and the\u00a0\u201csong of ice and fire\u201d because of his blood combination.</b> <b>However, there is another thing in the lore with the title Ice and Fire in it that is being overlooked here </b>that I think is very significant, particularly wrt The Others/White Walkers.</p><p>And that is,<b>\u00a0<i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i></b>.\u00a0</p><p><i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> was a pact forged between House Stark and House Targaryen, (more specifically the black faction of House Targaryen during the Dance of Dragons). <b>As it is described in <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i>, it was an agreement between the two houses that a Stark male would wed a Targaryen Princess.</b> (The recent book<i> Fire and Blood</i> gives more of an account and specifics of <i>who </i>the Princess would be \u2026 or, at least, who her <i>father</i> was supposed to be). The pact, however, was never fulfilled after The Dance ended.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>What is the significant part of this is what House Stark was specifically asking for, which was a Targaryen <i>princess</i>. Cregan Stark specifically wanted a young Targaryen\u00a0<i>girl</i> to wed into the Stark family.\u00a0</p><p>As explained above, via both the books/lore and the show, <b>the Starks have a connection to the happenings with The Others/White Walkers.</b>\u00a0We have the story of the 13 Lord Commander/Night\u2019s King. We know about Bran the Builder who, with the help of the Children of the Forest (and giants) helped raise the wall to guard against them invading again.<b> I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to believe that the Kings of Winter of ages past, as the Stark Kings were first called, not only <i>knew</i> about \u201cThe Prince Who Was Promised,\u201d but likely also what the true meaning of what this prince/princess\u00a0<i>being</i> promised was all about.</b> That whomever this prince/princess was, when born, they would be given to the The Others, who had been promised to them by\u00a0Azor Ahai.\u00a0</p><p>So what might this have to do with the <i>Pact of Ice and Fire</i> and requesting a Targaryen princess to marry into House Stark? I think a clue comes from Book 2, <i>A Clash of Kings</i>, and Daenerys\u2019 encounter with The Undying in the House of the Undying.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"200\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f51c4054946c4c1a6b8cd02f3f7bd89c/tumblr_inline_pobikwIDyK1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"200\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p>In ACOK, the Undying Ones are described in a way that has them seeming to be a representation of The Others/White Walkers; with them being described as\u00a0\u201cblue and cold.\u201d And then there is this passage, where they try to consume Daenerys (<b>Daenerys IV, ACOK</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>They wanted her, needed her<b>, the fire, the life, </b>and Dany gasped and opened her arms to give herself to them \u2026</i></p><p><i>But then black wings buffeted her round the head, and a scream of fury cut the <b>indigo air</b>, and suddenly the visions were gone, ripped away, and Dany\u2019s gasp turned to horror. <b>The Undying were all around her,</b> <b>blue and cold</b>, whispering as they reached for her, pulling, stroking, tugging at her clothes, touching her with their <b>dry cold hands</b>, twining their fingers through her hair. All the strength had left her limbs. She could not move. <b>Even her heart had ceased to beat.</b> She felt a hand on her bare breast, twisting her nipple. Teeth found the soft skin of her throat. A mouth descended on one eye, licking, sucking, biting \u2026</i></p><p><i><b><i>Then indigo</i></b><i> turned to <b>orange</b>, and whispers turned to screams. <b>Her heart was pounding, racing, the hands and mouths were gone</b>, heat washed over her skin, and Dany blinked at a sudden glare. <b>Perched above her, the dragon spread his wings and</b> <b>tore at the terrible dark heart, ripping the rotten flesh to ribbons</b>, and when his head snapped forward, <b>fire flew from his open jaws, bright and hot</b>. She could hear the shrieks of the Undying as they burned, their high thin papery voices crying out in tongues long dead. \u201c</i><br></i></p></blockquote><p>Here we have the Undying, who are described in terms of cold and death, linking them in many way to The Others/White Walkers, trying to consume the fire - which is linked to life - of Daenerys. (And they almost succeeded until Drogon saves her).\u00a0</p><p><b>There is indication that The Undying have been waiting for Daenerys for thousands of years before this moment.</b> <b>They want the lifeforce, <i>the fire</i> that she has, when she finally comes. </b>So what we have here are creatures associated with imagery of - and visually linked to - creatures of death, (The Others/White Walkers), trying to to consume a life,<b><i> the fire</i></b>, from someone of Valyrian descent. <b>Valyrian blood constantly linked to that of fire, and fire, throughout\u00a0the series, is linked to life.</b> House Targaryen\u2019s own words (a house motto they chose when Aegon the Conqueror first began his conquest and wanted his family to adopt more Westerosi culture BTW - they never had a House motto before that) is <i>Fire and Blood</i>, two images also associated with life.\u00a0</p><p><b>Just like The Undying, The Others/White Walkers also appear to be seeking life of some kind.</b> The taking of babies, and then using those babies to create more of their kind by turning them into Others/White Walkers I think ties into this. However, they very well might be something missing from what they seek out of this. A life-force that contains what The Undying were trying to <i>take</i> from Daenerys - <i>a fire</i>.\u00a0</p><p>How is a new life <i>usually</i> created? Male and Female coming together. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nIbFw-brBvw?t=70\"><i>Melisandre alludes to the power of that ability - to create life - in the scene when she tries to seduce Jon in Season 5</i></a> (<b>Episode 5x04</b>) (Start at: 1:10)\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FnIbFw-brBvw%3Ft%3D70\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nIbFw-brBvw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>And then of course, there is the quote from the book that she says in this seduction scene (which wasn\u2019t a seduction scene in the book btw), from <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> (<b>Jon VI</b>):\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>The Lord of Light in his wisdom made us male and female, two parts of a greater whole. In our joining there is power. Power to make life. Power to make light. Power to cast shadows.</i></p></blockquote><p>I think the show was being a bit more hard-hitting in the foreshadowing than the book by having Melisandre say these words while appearing to try and <i>seduce</i> Jon. <b>That there is power in the ability - in the <i>act</i> - of men and women coming together and creating life. </b>Unlike The Others/White Walkers, who can only create more of themselves by taking an already living creation - in this case, a child - and turning them into a being like them, a being of the cold.\u00a0</p><p>Yet, even with the power of men and women to do this, The Undying specifically were waiting for and sought out <i>Daenerys</i> for that life, <i>that fire</i>, that they needed. <b>And that may be because, while both male and female coming together can create life and light, it is the <i>female</i> who brings forth that light and life\u00a0<i>into</i> the world via childbirth.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>There is a running theme of motherhood, and what that means, throughout\u00a0Daenerys\u2019 story. She is called Mhysa by the people she liberated from slavery and metaphorically\u00a0giving\u00a0them new life as free\u00a0people. She birthed creatures that are considered to be fire made flesh via</b><i> <b>fire itself</b></i><b>.</b></p><p>I think <i>this</i> is why <i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> called for a Targaryen <i>princess</i> to wed into House Stark. <b>That the need for a joining of Ice and Fire had to specially be that the fruits of that joining, the life created from it, be <i>born</i> of fire; </b>born via a daughter - a female - who carried such fire within her, which those of Valyrian descent do.\u00a0</p><p>And this is where Rhaegar Targaryen made one of his many mistakes when it comes to the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. At some point I do think Rhaegar thought he needed a child who was - bloodline-wise - of\u00a0\u201cice and fire.\u201d <b>Rhaegar had already changed his life twice-over trying to fulfill the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. There is no reason to assume he wouldn\u2019t have done it again if he came into more info about it. </b>For all he did likley love Lyanna, I think it\u2019s probable that he also saw their child as the one who would make this prophecy he\u2019d been chasing most of his life come true \u2026 after first thinking it was about himself, and then thinking it would be about his three children he would (hopefully) have, and the idea that \u201cthe dragon has three heads.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>However, again, Rhaegar was incorrect, not just about what the whole idea of The Prince That Was Promised actually meant, but how the blood combination of Ice and Fire was supposed to be \u2026 or, more specifically, how the child had to be born. <b>Because Lyanna wasn\u2019t fire, or the blood of fire. She was of </b><i><b>ice</b>, </i><b>with the blood of the First Men within her, not the blood of Old Valyria. And the Prince Who Was Promised more than likely\u00a0had to be born of <i>fire</i>, via a female </b><i><b>with the blood of fire</b>.</i></p><p>From <i>A Game of Thrones</i> (<b>Daenerys X</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>No, she wanted to shout to him, no my good knight, do not fear for me. <b>The fire is mine.</b> I am Daenerys Stormborn, <b>daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons</b>, don\u2019t you see? Don\u2019t you SEE?</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Blood of the Dragon</i> are what those of blood of Old Valyria are called. Dragons are fire made flesh. Those of the blood Old Valyria, the Targaryens, like dragons, are also likely fire made flesh. And <i>fire</i> is life and light.\u00a0</p><p><b>And the coming together of <i>that </i>fire with ice is symbolic of <i>balance.</i></b>\u00a0From <i>A Clash of Kings</i> (<b>Daenerys IV</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI have come for the gift of truth,\u201d Dany said. \u201cIn the long hall, the things I saw \u2026 were they true visions, or lies?

Nobody knows who he was before \u2014 a soldier or part of [nobility]. He never wanted to be the Night King. I think he wants revenge. Everybody in this story has two sides \u2014 a bad side and a good side. The Night King only has one side, a bad side.</i><br></p></blockquote><p>Thinking the Night King wants revenge isn\u2019t the same as that being what he definitely wants. <b>However, the idea that the Night King only has a bad side seems to fit with the view of what The Great Other is and represents in the books/lore, which is the god of darkness and death. </b>However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that cut and dry even via what The Great Other/Night King is. Because evil acts can be committed by those who fight for the light, such as good acts can likely be committed by those who fight for darkness/death. Melisandre\u2019s burning of Shireen Baratheon, which Martin has already confirmed will happen in the books as well, is proof enough of that. \u00a0</p><p>Also, from the recent interview, there is this:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>What can we expect from him in the final season?</b></i></p><p><i>People will see he has a target he wants to kill, and you will find out who that is. There\u2019s also that moment [in \u201cHardhome\u201d] when Jon Snow was on the boat and the Night King looked at him and raised his arms \u2014 there\u2019s a similar and even stronger moment between Jon and the Night King this time.</i> \u00a0</p></blockquote><p><b>I think it\u2019s pretty clear that that target <i>isn\u2019t </i>Jon Snow. He had more than one opportunity to kill Jon, but proceeded instead to mostly just taunt him.</b> I don\u2019t think the target is Daenerys either, or he could have easily killed Drogon and gotten her when she came beyond the wall in Episode 6 of Season 7.</p><p>The Three-eyed Raven/Crow being the target - with that now being Bran, is an option I admit, however \u2026 the original Three-Eyed Raven/Crow, who was Brynden Rivers aka Bloodraven, had been the Three-Eyed Raven/Crow for many years, and there is little to no indication that The Night King was actively trying to kill him during any of that time.</p><p><b>However, what if the killing of the target doesn\u2019t mean just \u201cto kill,\u201d so much in the sense of what we saw happen to the former Three-Eyed Raven in the show,</b> <b>but is more in the vein of what happened to Daenerys in the House of the Undying in the books, when the Undying tried to take her life-force from her.</b></p><p>And the person they want to do this with is actually the <i>child</i> Daenerys and Jon will/have created?</p><p><b>Because the foreshadowing that Jon and Daenerys will have a child in the coming season was pretty obvious, not to mention Daenerys whole underlying story theme and motif of motherhood. </b>Also, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CczKaabSRfU?t=76\">do not overlook this clip, which HBO chose to highlight before the start of Season 8,</a> where Viserys makes this comment about the child that Dany is set to have with Khal Drogo (<b>Episode 1x06</b>) (Start: 1:16):</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCczKaabSRfU%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26t%3D76\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CczKaabSRfU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><blockquote><p><i>He won\u2019t be a real Targaryen.

(In fact, I think Jon\u2019s going to learn a hard lesson about that when the baby switching plot he instigated wrt Gilly\u2019s baby in the books plays out to a tragic end for Gilly\u2019s baby). <b>If they can find a way to defeat The Others/White Walkers without having to make such a sacrifice and basically taking the easy way out to do so, they may also guarantee that this time, The Others/White Walkers will truly be destroyed and gone forever this time.</b> Instead of what Azor Ahai did, which only seemed to have the go into some kind of slumber and dormancy, and staying in the lands beyond the wall.</p><p><b>However, there may be some among Jon and Daenerys\u2019 army and/or advisors who would want to take the easy route and give the child over to end the conflict quickly</b>, which - while pushing off the problem again for another couple of thousands years - could prevent many people from dying and becoming a part of the Army of the Dead and overrunning Westeros as was what happened during the first Long Night. (Which didn\u2019t stay limited to only Westeros, but spread over almost all of Essos as well).</p><p>In the show, Daenerys\u2019 story has a theme about wanting to\u00a0\u201cbreak the wheel\u201d; the wheel being the nature of the political dynamics of Westeros that benefits the more Noble Classes that fight for power and dominance, symbolized by the Iron Throne, and those who do not benefit from that ongoing struggle, which are the lower classes and smallfolk of Westeros. They are the ones who are always crushed underneath this wheel, this circular nature of the political power fights and wars.\u00a0</p><p><b>However, this idea of\u00a0\u201cbreaking the wheel\u201d may also, in the end, extend to the fight against The Others/White Walkers.</b> As noted, this is not the first time they have invaded the realms of men. And, the last time they did, they were not defeated. The problem they are, the threat they pose, seems to have been pushed off to another generation to have to fight, combat and deal with. And at the center of that fight to do so might just rest with Ice and Fire coming together to create something new. <b>However, the prophecy that has dictated the lives of many people that has lead to this, has never dictated the lives of the two people who may have the most influence in The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy coming to fruition. </b>Neither Jon or Daenerys have lived their lives or made decisions in their lives sorley to fulfil a prophecy. <b>And given what was very likely the <i>weasel-wording</i> technique used for The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy, the fact that they did so may, in the end, be the deciding factor in the breaking of <i>another</i> wheel, another cycle of destruction.</b>\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"650\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7a30aee294fcf2ca367f6036e2f18/tumblr_inline_podb5g0cdu1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"650\"></figure></p>",

The Youtube channel Talking Thrones <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEud33zwWCA\">posted a video</a> that talks in a few of the same directions I write about here; and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1UHGTGlDDT-LfHGij5Xggg\">@oadara</a> and I discussed a lot of this between us over DM, so much of this comes out of that as well.</p><p>So there are two main prophecies most people focus on when it comes to ASOIAF/GOT, which are:\u00a0</p><p><b>- The prophecy that Maggy the Frog</b> gave to Cersei when she was a girl.\u00a0</p><p><b>- The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai prophecy</b> that talks of a coming hero who will save the world from the coming darkness.</p><p>First, let\u2019s look at <b>what George R. R. Martin himself says about prophecies</b>, particularly in fantasy fiction:</p><blockquote><p><i>Prophecy is a staple element in fantasy, but it\u2019s tricky,\u201d Martin noted. \u201cYou want to play with the notion of prophecies coming true but in an unexpected way. You want to be unpredictable about it. Shakespeare is the ultimate example of that\u2014when the forest of Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane Castle, MacBeth will fall. Everybody laughs\u2014how can the forest come to the castle. [Malcolm] came camouflaged with branches and so on. Also, during the War of the Roses, one of the lords was prophesized that he would die at a certain castle. So he always took pains to avoid that castle. But then in the first The Battle of St Albans, he was wounded and died outside a pub that had that castle on its pub sign. <b>You have to look at prophecies carefully and look at the weasel-wording.</b></i>\u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>(George R. R. Martin, <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2015/04/12/game-thrones-cersei-flashback/?asdf=&amp;hootPostID=7dbf8334a2e354db75463cc29a0cb5ca\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, 04/12/2015)</p><p>Martin is specifically talking about two types of prophecies here in the examples he gives: the <i><b>self-fulfilling prophecy</b></i> and the <i><b>non-literal prophecy</b></i>.\u00a0\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>I think it has become more and more clear that <b>Cersei\u2019s prophecy that she received from Maggy the Frog is headed in the style of a <i>self-fulfilling</i> prophecy. </b>That Cersei, in actively trying to prevent the prophecy from happening, has inevitably caused it <i>to</i> happen.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"615\" data-orig-height=\"342\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0664a2e22a0cd4f01248222187309f56/tumblr_inline_pmhd50VLin1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"615\" data-orig-height=\"342\"></figure><p>Leaving aside the <i>Valonqar</i> part of the prophecy for now, (since the show left it out too), one point of it that people continue to argue over is who the <b>Younger, More Beautiful Queen</b> part of this prophecy refers to. However, in a way, it is actually <i>unimportant</i>. Because with a self-fulfilling prophecy, <b>the YMBQ could have been <i>anyone</i>.</b> Or, at least, any girl who had a realistic chance of becoming Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. <b>There was never one designated person it was destined to be</b>. Which means Sansa, Margaery, Daenerys and, adding in the books, you can probably place Arianne Martell in the group as well, each could have been the YMBQ. <b>The important part is/was how <i>Cersei reacted</i> to the threat of each of these women to BE the YMBQ</b>, NOT who the woman actually <i>was</i>. Because again, <i>it could have been any one of them.</i>\u00a0</p><p>For those who know Harry Potter, it is very much in line with Voldemort hearing that the person who can defeat him will be born \u201cas the seventh month dies.\u201d As HP book readers know, there were <i>two</i> boys born at the end of July - Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. It was Voldemort <i>himself</i> who picked Harry as the Chosen One when he went to kill him in Godric\u2019s Hollow on that Halloween night. However, it could have just as easily <i>not</i> been Harry if Voldemort had picked and gone to kill Neville instead. <i>Voldemort</i> chose his rival, not fate or destiny.</p><p><b>I think the YMBQ part of Cersei\u2019s prophecy is the same type of self-fulfilling\u00a0prophecy that we see in Harry Potter, where <i>Voldemort</i> <i>chose</i> his rival, but with a slight twist</b>.\u00a0With Sansa and Margaery both, Cersei <i>recognized</i> them as threats, as the potential YMBQ of the prophecy she got, and worked to neutralize them as such in any way she could think of. <b>However, the YMBQ has very likely become the person who Cersei <i>didn\u2019t</i> think of as a threat and work to stop from being one until it was actually too late: Daenerys.</b> (Though I do think Arianne Martell still might have chance to be this in the books in some way, even possibly jointly along with Daenerys, since we don\u2019t know the direction\u00a0Arianne\u2019s story will go in relation to Cersei in the books). <b>One of the underlying story threads of both the books and the show is how no one in Westeros is paying/paid all that much attention to Dany and the possible threat she poses</b>,<b> particularly to the Lannisters</b> \u2026 and possibly to Cersei herself. <b>Not until it\u2019s looking to be too late to really do anything about it.</b> Not until <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> at least, (as far as the books go), when it is now possibly too late to stop her from being one.\u00a0</p><p>Which makes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tk5hKomP4MA?t=101\">the scene in the show of <i>Joffrey</i> of all people recognizing the threat she is so early on drip with irony</a>. (Start at 1:42)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dtk5hKomP4MA%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26t%3D101\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tk5hKomP4MA?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p><b><i>Cersei</i> <i>chose</i> who the YMBQ was, by <i>not</i> choosing to see the threat one of the candidates presented to her.</b> Like Voldemort did, Cersei has/is choosing the instruments of her own destruction, and making the prophecy come true, especially by living her life actively engaging with her prophecy and trying to prevent it. </p><p>And from the little we know of him via the books and lore, this appears to have also been Rhaegar Targaryen\u2019s downfall as well, actively engaging and living his life based on a prophecy. <b>However, in Rhaegar\u2019s case, the prophecy doesn\u2019t look to be self-fulfilling so much as being a <i>non-literal</i> prophecy.</b> Non-literal prophecies are way more tricky to engage in and with, and may actually <i>lead to</i> the event that the prophecy says is destined to be <i>stopped</i>. \u00a0</p><p>We see a version of this type of prophecy (awkwardly done) in the Star Wars prequels. \u201cAnakin Skywalker is destined to destroy the Sith and bring balance to The Force.\u201d Which yes,\u00a0Anakin\u00a0<i>did</i> destroy the Sith; but only <i>after</i> he helped the Sith to destroy the Jedi and became a Sith Lord <i>himself</i>. (Which then brought balance to the force after he killed Palpatine and then he - as Vader - died as well because then the only one left was Jedi Luke, I guess? Again, I said it was <i>awkwardly</i> done, not perfectly done). So yes, if you look at that prophecy literally, Anakin Skywalker <i>did </i>destroy the Sith. It was just the nature of <i><b>why</b></i> and <i><b>how</b></i> this prophecy would come to be true and be fulfilled that was what was missing: that Anakin would help to wipe out the Jedi <i>first </i>BEFORE destroying the Sith.\u00a0</p><p>A better example of this, with the\u00a0<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique used that Martin mentions above, is another example from the Shakespeare play <i>Macbeth,</i>\u00a0and the character of Macduff. Macbeth is told by the three witches that\u00a0\u201cno man of woman born\u201d can kill him, so Macbeth goes though the play thinking that he can not be killed by any man. Turns out, however, that\u00a0Macduff was actually born via a medieval version of a c-section:</p><blockquote><p><i>And let the angel whom thou still hast served <br>Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother\u2019s womb <br>Untimely ripped\u00a0\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p>So Macduff technically wasn\u2019t \u201cborn\u201d in the traditional sense as known of at that time. And so yes, Macduff is the one who ultimately kills Macbeth.</p><p>And I think <i>that</i> is that type of prophecy - <b>one of non-literal interpretation - is what we are looking at when it comes to the prophecy in ASOIAF/GOT about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai.</b>\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Let me start by pointing out: <i><b>there is no Night King in the books</b></i>. In the lore of the world there is a <i>Night\u2019s</i> King (possessive S), <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_King\">who was this guy</a>:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"139\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af4ccfc39d1a4389fa35961de3fc3307/tumblr_inline_pmhek7SlTL1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"139\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p><b>The 13th Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch</b>. Bran mentions him in <i>A Storm of Swords,</i> and <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i> talks about him as well. It is said that he was a Stark, possibly the brother of the then-current King of Winter. <b>In brief, his story was thus:</b> he saw a woman for atop the wall one night\u00a0\"with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars.\u201c He fell in love with her even though\u00a0\"her skin was cold as ice\u201d and, when he gave her his seed, he gave her his soul as well. <b>With her, he claimed the Nightfort as his castle and declared himself as King and her his Queen. There, he ruled for 13 years until the King of Winter and the King-Beyond-The-Wall brought him down</b>.\u00a0</p><p>As far as we know so far, the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King has no relation or connection to <i>this</i> guy from the show, known as the <i>Night</i> King (no possessive S):</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7e66568595e90042da76e31f0b0f0/tumblr_inline_pmiqnj3dKZ1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"></figure><p>Not least of which because <b>their backstories are compelty different.</b> The Night King of the show was created by the Children of the Forest for their war against the First Men, which clearly happened years - if not decades - before the end of the first Long Night (which, itself, lasted a generation), the construction of The Wall and the formation of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m bringing up the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King and <i>Night</i> King difference - and that the Night King is show-only - because of one particular story point with regards to the <i>Night\u2019s</i> King that I don\u2019t want anyone confusing with the <i>Night</i> King of the show. And that is: when the Night\u2019s King was finally brought down, it was discovered that he had been making sacrifices to The Others, aka the White Walkers. The lore never <i>directly</i> says what type of sacrifices he was making to them.<b> However, given what we\u2019ve seen presented in both the books and the show, there appears to only be one type of sacrifices The Others/White Walkers have ever appeared to take: human babies.</b></p><p>As we\u2019ve seen in both the books and the show, Craster was somehow able to negotiate with The Others/White Walkers to make an agreement to sacrifice his own sons to them. So it doesn\u2019t appear to be much of a stretch to assume that the Night\u2019s King was able to make some similar type of deal to sacrifice any children he made with his Queen to them as well.\u00a0</p><p><b>So what do The Others/White Walkers want?<i>\u00a0We already know what they want. </i>The books, the lore and the show have all already told us, and even </b><i><b>shown</b></i><b> us, what\u00a0they want.</b> Twice now, they have made deals and taken human sacrifices - babies - and left the places south of the wall alone when they have received such things. There is no reason to believe that they would never do so again. <b>We just don\u2019t know <i>why</i> they want what they do, which is a different question than asking <i>what</i> they want.\u00a0</b></p><p>So, knowing this, how might this tie into the prophecy of\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>First off, in the books, the wording of the prophecy falls very much into the\u00a0<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique that Martin himself talks about. Because the person who speaks the most about the prophecy, Melisandre, talks about the prophecy being about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised <i>and</i> Azor Ahai <i>interchangeably</i>. Her talking about the prophecy in this way gives the impression that\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai are one-in-the-same, and one is just another name for the other.</p><p><b>However, what if that is not the case.</b> Now, it\u2019s complicated because the show has never either mentioned nor referred to\u00a0Azor Ahai, (except for possibly as just an easter egg in a book Gilly is seen reading in S7), but has used the wording more associated with\u00a0Azor Ahai to talk about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised.\u00a0</p><p>Another problem is that there is no one-description of what the prophecy actually <i>is</i>. In <i>A Storm of Swords</i> (<b>Davos III</b>),\u00a0Melisandre says this:</p><blockquote><p><i>When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.</i>\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Pretty straight forward. But again,<b> this talks about\u00a0Azor Ahai being reborn and how, <i>not </i>saying anything about\u00a0The Prince Who Was Promised, or them being the same person.</b>\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>And then, of course, there is the gender pronoun confusion</b>, which is mentioned both in the books and the show,<b> both</b> <b>dealing with the mistranslation about The Prince Who Was Promised</b>. Maester Aemon in <i>A Feast For Crows</i>\u00a0(<b>Samwell IV</b>) says:</p><blockquote><p><i>What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. <b>Dragons are neither male nor female,</b> Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years.</i><br></p></blockquote><p>The prophecy originally having been made using the word for <i>dragon</i> in High Valyrian, and dragons, by nature, have no fixed gender. (The lore giving various opinions of if dragons can continually change sex at will or not. The only real way to tell if a dragon is male or female is if it lays eggs or not).\u00a0</p><p>And in the show (<b>Episode 7x02</b>) Missandei says:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>That noun has no gender in High Valyrian.</b> The proper translation for that prophecy would be, \u2018the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.\u2019</i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p><b>So what we have here is not only confusion as to whether or not Azor Ahai reborn is supposed to be the same person as The Prince Who Was Promised, but also <i>gender confusion</i> about <b>The Prince Who Was Promised\u00a0</b>because High Valyrian nouns are not gender specific.</b> On top of which, the show has only talked opening about The Prince Who Was Promised, but made no mention of Azor Ahai and him possibly being reborn <i>as</i> the prince who was promised or not.</p><p>Then of course, also from the books, <b>we have the knowledge that a song was composed for The Prince Who Was Promised</b>, which is called/known as\u00a0\u201cthe song of ice and fire\u201d which Daenerys learns of in her vision in the House of the Undying. (<i>ACOK</i>, <b>Daenerys IV</b>)\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b>I\u2019m not the first person to suggest that The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai reborn are two different people</b> and that, between the mistranslations and gender confusion, the two things got mixed up together. But to make it clear, I\u2019d say <b>Azor Ahai is the one who will be reborn via salt and smoke who will wake dragons from stone</b>, and that <b>The Prince Who Was Promised is a separate prophecy, and person, and is the one who \u201cwill bring the dawn.\u201d\u00a0</b></p><p>So what does this have to do with The Others/White Walkers? Well, this is where more of that that <i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique Martin calls it comes in. In that what if The Prince Who Was Promised was actually promised <i>to</i> something - or someone. Namely, The Others/White Walkers. And what if it was a promise Azor Ahai <i>himself </i>made to them? It would go a ways to explain why the two are always connected to each other</p><p>If you look at the actual history of the First Long Night,\u00a0<b>Azor Ahai never actually\u00a0</b><i><b>defeated</b></i><b> The Others/White Walkers. He and the members of the first Night\u2019s Watch were able to drive them back, and had them flee into the Lands of Always Winter, but they were never defeated completely.</b> Which is why The Wall was built in the first place and The Night\u2019s Watch established - to guard <i>against</i> The Others/White Walkers coming back south and taking over the realms of Men as they did during the First Long Night.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"938\" data-orig-height=\"412\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be496d497142e862a19df7c6a121b16c/tumblr_inline_pobg04Kybu1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"938\" data-orig-height=\"412\"></figure><p><b>So what if it was Azor Ahai himself who promised this\u00a0\u201cprince\u201d to The Others/White Walker as a way to keep them from trying to invade the realms of Men another time?</b> Again, via both the 13th LC of the NW and Craster, we know making pacts/deals with The Others/White Walkers is possible in some way. <b>So, who is this\u00a0\u201cprince who was promised\u201d? Yeah, I could just say Jon Snow, (because that\u2019s what it likely looks like I\u2019m about to say), but actually no, what if it\u2019s <i>not</i> him? Or, more specifically, what if it was <i>supposed</i> to be him but, once again, the prophecy got slightly misinterpted?</b></p><p>Put a pin in this. We\u2019ll come back to it. For now, let\u2019s go back to the 13th LC and Craster.</p><p>According to Old Nan, the 13th LC was a Stark, meaning he contained the blood of the First Men. <b>The blood of the First Men is thought to carry some magical properties, particularly within the Stark family bloodline, which contain warging and greenseer abilities.</b> And the Stark Kings of old were known as the Kings of Winter. So by the 13th LC likely sacrificing children of his blood that he made with his Night\u2019s Queen, he was providing The Others/White Walkers children that carried a strong magical element in their blood.</p><p><b>Throughout the story and the lore, the Stark are also associated with Ice. Even their Great Valyrian Sword is called simply\u00a0\u201cIce.\u201d\u00a0</b><br></p><p><b>With Craster</b>, <b>things are less certain there wrt the magical elements. </b>Wildlings, which his mother was said to be, are also of the Blood of the First men, but it is not clear if the magical element is a strong among the Wildings as it is with the Starks. <b>The main point, however, is that The Others/White Walkers accepted Craster\u2019s sons as offerings, just as they did from the Night\u2019s King/13th LC. So they were clearly deemed as acceptable in that regard.</b>\u00a0Because, at the very least, they carried the blood of the First Men in them, from Craster\u2019s Wildling mother.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>[<b>Side Note:</b> <b>There is probably going to be a plot-hole in the show wrt Craster\u2019s kids - Gilly\u2019s baby Little Sam specifically. Because, in the books, there is a baby-switching plot going on with Gilly\u2019s baby</b>, (he isn\u2019t named Little Sam in the books, he\u2019s just referred to as\u00a0<i>Monster</i> instead), <b>and Mance Rayder\u2019s baby son.</b> (Yes, Mance has a baby son in the books). Jon more or less forced Gilly to switch her son with Mance\u2019s baby son to try and protect Mance\u2019s son from possibly being killed/burned to death. So that is the fate that might actually befall Gilly\u2019s baby son in the books while Jon is still currently dead, leaving NONE of Craster\u2019s sons alive after that.]\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>So what we have here are two instances of sacrifices to The Others being made and accepted by the Others/White Walkers. And again, the only thing we\u2019ve seen The Others/White Walkers take as a sacrifice are babies.</p><p>Now let\u2019s go back and look at The Prince Who Was Promised and, more specifically, the thing Rhaegar says about the song composed for him, specifically called\u00a0\u201cThe Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d As we all know, that is the actual title of Martin\u2019s book series that the tv show <i>Game of Thrones</i> is based on. And, of course, <b>Jon being the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark have many thinking he is \u201cThe Prince Who Was Promised\u201d and the\u00a0\u201csong of ice and fire\u201d because of his blood combination.</b> <b>However, there is another thing in the lore with the title Ice and Fire in it that is being overlooked here </b>that I think is very significant, particularly wrt The Others/White Walkers.</p><p>And that is,<b>\u00a0<i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i></b>.\u00a0</p><p><i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> was a pact forged between House Stark and House Targaryen, (more specifically the black faction of House Targaryen during the Dance of Dragons). <b>As it is described in <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i>, it was an agreement between the two houses that a Stark male would wed a Targaryen Princess.</b> (The recent book<i> Fire and Blood</i> gives more of an account and specifics of <i>who </i>the Princess would be \u2026 or, at least, who her <i>father</i> was supposed to be). The pact, however, was never fulfilled after The Dance ended.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>What is the significant part of this is what House Stark was specifically asking for, which was a Targaryen <i>princess</i>. Cregan Stark specifically wanted a young Targaryen\u00a0<i>girl</i> to wed into the Stark family.\u00a0</p><p>As explained above, via both the books/lore and the show, <b>the Starks have a connection to the happenings with The Others/White Walkers.</b>\u00a0We have the story of the 13 Lord Commander/Night\u2019s King. We know about Bran the Builder who, with the help of the Children of the Forest (and giants) helped raise the wall to guard against them invading again.<b> I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to believe that the Kings of Winter of ages past, as the Stark Kings were first called, not only <i>knew</i> about \u201cThe Prince Who Was Promised,\u201d but likely also what the true meaning of what this prince/princess\u00a0<i>being</i> promised was all about.</b> That whomever this prince/princess was, when born, they would be given to the The Others, who had been promised to them by\u00a0Azor Ahai.\u00a0</p><p>So what might this have to do with the <i>Pact of Ice and Fire</i> and requesting a Targaryen princess to marry into House Stark? I think a clue comes from Book 2, <i>A Clash of Kings</i>, and Daenerys\u2019 encounter with The Undying in the House of the Undying.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"200\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f51c4054946c4c1a6b8cd02f3f7bd89c/tumblr_inline_pobikwIDyK1qi5869_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"200\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p>In ACOK, the Undying Ones are described in a way that has them seeming to be a representation of The Others/White Walkers; with them being described as\u00a0\u201cblue and cold.\u201d And then there is this passage, where they try to consume Daenerys (<b>Daenerys IV, ACOK</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>They wanted her, needed her<b>, the fire, the life, </b>and Dany gasped and opened her arms to give herself to them \u2026</i></p><p><i>But then black wings buffeted her round the head, and a scream of fury cut the <b>indigo air</b>, and suddenly the visions were gone, ripped away, and Dany\u2019s gasp turned to horror. <b>The Undying were all around her,</b> <b>blue and cold</b>, whispering as they reached for her, pulling, stroking, tugging at her clothes, touching her with their <b>dry cold hands</b>, twining their fingers through her hair. All the strength had left her limbs. She could not move. <b>Even her heart had ceased to beat.</b> She felt a hand on her bare breast, twisting her nipple. Teeth found the soft skin of her throat. A mouth descended on one eye, licking, sucking, biting \u2026</i></p><p><i><b><i>Then indigo</i></b><i> turned to <b>orange</b>, and whispers turned to screams. <b>Her heart was pounding, racing, the hands and mouths were gone</b>, heat washed over her skin, and Dany blinked at a sudden glare. <b>Perched above her, the dragon spread his wings and</b> <b>tore at the terrible dark heart, ripping the rotten flesh to ribbons</b>, and when his head snapped forward, <b>fire flew from his open jaws, bright and hot</b>. She could hear the shrieks of the Undying as they burned, their high thin papery voices crying out in tongues long dead. \u201c</i><br></i></p></blockquote><p>Here we have the Undying, who are described in terms of cold and death, linking them in many way to The Others/White Walkers, trying to consume the fire - which is linked to life - of Daenerys. (And they almost succeeded until Drogon saves her).\u00a0</p><p><b>There is indication that The Undying have been waiting for Daenerys for thousands of years before this moment.</b> <b>They want the lifeforce, <i>the fire</i> that she has, when she finally comes. </b>So what we have here are creatures associated with imagery of - and visually linked to - creatures of death, (The Others/White Walkers), trying to to consume a life,<b><i> the fire</i></b>, from someone of Valyrian descent. <b>Valyrian blood constantly linked to that of fire, and fire, throughout\u00a0the series, is linked to life.</b> House Targaryen\u2019s own words (a house motto they chose when Aegon the Conqueror first began his conquest and wanted his family to adopt more Westerosi culture BTW - they never had a House motto before that) is <i>Fire and Blood</i>, two images also associated with life.\u00a0</p><p><b>Just like The Undying, The Others/White Walkers also appear to be seeking life of some kind.</b> The taking of babies, and then using those babies to create more of their kind by turning them into Others/White Walkers I think ties into this. However, they very well might be something missing from what they seek out of this. A life-force that contains what The Undying were trying to <i>take</i> from Daenerys - <i>a fire</i>.\u00a0</p><p>How is a new life <i>usually</i> created?

In our joining there is power. Power to make life. Power to make light. Power to cast shadows.</i></p></blockquote><p>I think the show was being a bit more hard-hitting in the foreshadowing than the book by having Melisandre say these words while appearing to try and <i>seduce</i> Jon. <b>That there is power in the ability - in the <i>act</i> - of men and women coming together and creating life. </b>Unlike The Others/White Walkers, who can only create more of themselves by taking an already living creation - in this case, a child - and turning them into a being like them, a being of the cold.\u00a0</p><p>Yet, even with the power of men and women to do this, The Undying specifically were waiting for and sought out <i>Daenerys</i> for that life, <i>that fire</i>, that they needed. <b>And that may be because, while both male and female coming together can create life and light, it is the <i>female</i> who brings forth that light and life\u00a0<i>into</i> the world via childbirth.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>There is a running theme of motherhood, and what that means, throughout\u00a0Daenerys\u2019 story. She is called Mhysa by the people she liberated from slavery and metaphorically\u00a0giving\u00a0them new life as free\u00a0people. She birthed creatures that are considered to be fire made flesh via</b><i> <b>fire itself</b></i><b>.</b></p><p>I think <i>this</i> is why <i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> called for a Targaryen <i>princess</i> to wed into House Stark. <b>That the need for a joining of Ice and Fire had to specially be that the fruits of that joining, the life created from it, be <i>born</i> of fire; </b>born via a daughter - a female - who carried such fire within her, which those of Valyrian descent do.\u00a0</p><p>And this is where Rhaegar Targaryen made one of his many mistakes when it comes to the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. At some point I do think Rhaegar thought he needed a child who was - bloodline-wise - of\u00a0\u201cice and fire.\u201d <b>Rhaegar had already changed his life twice-over trying to fulfill the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. There is no reason to assume he wouldn\u2019t have done it again if he came into more info about it. </b>For all he did likley love Lyanna, I think it\u2019s probable that he also saw their child as the one who would make this prophecy he\u2019d been chasing most of his life come true \u2026 after first thinking it was about himself, and then thinking it would be about his three children he would (hopefully) have, and the idea that \u201cthe dragon has three heads.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>However, again, Rhaegar was incorrect, not just about what the whole idea of The Prince That Was Promised actually meant, but how the blood combination of Ice and Fire was supposed to be \u2026 or, more specifically, how the child had to be born. <b>Because Lyanna wasn\u2019t fire, or the blood of fire. She was of </b><i><b>ice</b>, </i><b>with the blood of the First Men within her, not the blood of Old Valyria. And the Prince Who Was Promised more than likely\u00a0had to be born of <i>fire</i>, via a female </b><i><b>with the blood of fire</b>.</i></p><p>From <i>A Game of Thrones</i> (<b>Daenerys X</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>No, she wanted to shout to him, no my good knight, do not fear for me. <b>The fire is mine.</b> I am Daenerys Stormborn, <b>daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons</b>, don\u2019t you see? Don\u2019t you SEE?</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Blood of the Dragon</i> are what those of blood of Old Valyria are called. Dragons are fire made flesh. Those of the blood Old Valyria, the Targaryens, like dragons, are also likely fire made flesh. And <i>fire</i> is life and light.\u00a0</p><p><b>And the coming together of <i>that </i>fire with ice is symbolic of <i>balance.</i></b>\u00a0From <i>A Clash of Kings</i> (<b>Daenerys IV</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI have come for the gift of truth,\u201d Dany said. \u201cIn the long hall, the things I saw \u2026 were they true visions, or lies?

Nobody knows who he was before \u2014 a soldier or part of [nobility]. He never wanted to be the Night King. I think he wants revenge. Everybody in this story has two sides \u2014 a bad side and a good side. The Night King only has one side, a bad side.</i><br></p></blockquote><p>Thinking the Night King wants revenge isn\u2019t the same as that being what he definitely wants. <b>However, the idea that the Night King only has a bad side seems to fit with the view of what The Great Other is and represents in the books/lore, which is the god of darkness and death. </b>However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that cut and dry even via what The Great Other/Night King is. Because evil acts can be committed by those who fight for the light, such as good acts can likely be committed by those who fight for darkness/death. Melisandre\u2019s burning of Shireen Baratheon, which Martin has already confirmed will happen in the books as well, is proof enough of that. \u00a0</p><p>Also, from the recent interview, there is this:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>What can we expect from him in the final season?</b></i></p><p><i>People will see he has a target he wants to kill, and you will find out who that is. There\u2019s also that moment [in \u201cHardhome\u201d] when Jon Snow was on the boat and the Night King looked at him and raised his arms \u2014 there\u2019s a similar and even stronger moment between Jon and the Night King this time.</i> \u00a0</p></blockquote><p><b>I think it\u2019s pretty clear that that target <i>isn\u2019t </i>Jon Snow. He had more than one opportunity to kill Jon, but proceeded instead to mostly just taunt him.</b> I don\u2019t think the target is Daenerys either, or he could have easily killed Drogon and gotten her when she came beyond the wall in Episode 6 of Season 7.</p><p>The Three-eyed Raven/Crow being the target - with that now being Bran, is an option I admit, however \u2026 the original Three-Eyed Raven/Crow, who was Brynden Rivers aka Bloodraven, had been the Three-Eyed Raven/Crow for many years, and there is little to no indication that The Night King was actively trying to kill him during any of that time.</p><p><b>However, what if the killing of the target doesn\u2019t mean just \u201cto kill,\u201d so much in the sense of what we saw happen to the former Three-Eyed Raven in the show,</b> <b>but is more in the vein of what happened to Daenerys in the House of the Undying in the books, when the Undying tried to take her life-force from her.</b></p><p>And the person they want to do this with is actually the <i>child</i> Daenerys and Jon will/have created?</p><p><b>Because the foreshadowing that Jon and Daenerys will have a child in the coming season was pretty obvious, not to mention Daenerys whole underlying story theme and motif of motherhood. </b>Also, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CczKaabSRfU?t=76\">do not overlook this clip, which HBO chose to highlight before the start of Season 8,</a> where Viserys makes this comment about the child that Dany is set to have with Khal Drogo (<b>Episode 1x06</b>) (Start: 1:16):</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCczKaabSRfU%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26t%3D76\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CczKaabSRfU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><blockquote><p><i>He won\u2019t be a real Targaryen.

(In fact, I think Jon\u2019s going to learn a hard lesson about that when the baby switching plot he instigated wrt Gilly\u2019s baby in the books plays out to a tragic end for Gilly\u2019s baby). <b>If they can find a way to defeat The Others/White Walkers without having to make such a sacrifice and basically taking the easy way out to do so, they may also guarantee that this time, The Others/White Walkers will truly be destroyed and gone forever this time.</b> Instead of what Azor Ahai did, which only seemed to have the go into some kind of slumber and dormancy, and staying in the lands beyond the wall.</p><p><b>However, there may be some among Jon and Daenerys\u2019 army and/or advisors who would want to take the easy route and give the child over to end the conflict quickly</b>, which - while pushing off the problem again for another couple of thousands years - could prevent many people from dying and becoming a part of the Army of the Dead and overrunning Westeros as was what happened during the first Long Night. (Which didn\u2019t stay limited to only Westeros, but spread over almost all of Essos as well).</p><p>In the show, Daenerys\u2019 story has a theme about wanting to\u00a0\u201cbreak the wheel\u201d; the wheel being the nature of the political dynamics of Westeros that benefits the more Noble Classes that fight for power and dominance, symbolized by the Iron Throne, and those who do not benefit from that ongoing struggle, which are the lower classes and smallfolk of Westeros. They are the ones who are always crushed underneath this wheel, this circular nature of the political power fights and wars.\u00a0</p><p><b>However, this idea of\u00a0\u201cbreaking the wheel\u201d may also, in the end, extend to the fight against The Others/White Walkers.</b> As noted, this is not the first time they have invaded the realms of men. And, the last time they did, they were not defeated. The problem they are, the threat they pose, seems to have been pushed off to another generation to have to fight, combat and deal with. And at the center of that fight to do so might just rest with Ice and Fire coming together to create something new. <b>However, the prophecy that has dictated the lives of many people that has lead to this, has never dictated the lives of the two people who may have the most influence in The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy coming to fruition. </b>Neither Jon or Daenerys have lived their lives or made decisions in their lives sorley to fulfil a prophecy. <b>And given what was very likely the <i>weasel-wording</i> technique used for The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy, the fact that they did so may, in the end, be the deciding factor in the breaking of <i>another</i> wheel, another cycle of destruction.</b>\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"650\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7a30aee294fcf2ca367f6036e2f18/tumblr_inline_podb5g0cdu1qi5869_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"650\"></figure></p>",

The Youtube channel Talking Thrones <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEud33zwWCA\">posted a video</a> that talks in a few of the same directions I write about here; and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1UHGTGlDDT-LfHGij5Xggg\">@oadara</a> and I discussed a lot of this between us over DM, so much of this comes out of that as well.</p><p>So there are two main prophecies most people focus on when it comes to ASOIAF/GOT, which are:&nbsp;</p><p><b>- The prophecy that Maggy the Frog</b> gave to Cersei when she was a girl.&nbsp;</p><p><b>- The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai prophecy</b> that talks of a coming hero who will save the world from the coming darkness.</p><p>First, let&rsquo;s look at <b>what George R. R. Martin himself says about prophecies</b>, particularly in fantasy fiction:</p><blockquote><p><i>Prophecy is a staple element in fantasy, but it&rsquo;s tricky,&rdquo; Martin noted. &ldquo;You want to play with the notion of prophecies coming true but in an unexpected way. You want to be unpredictable about it. Shakespeare is the ultimate example of that&mdash;when the forest of Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane Castle, MacBeth will fall. Everybody laughs&mdash;how can the forest come to the castle. [Malcolm] came camouflaged with branches and so on. Also, during the War of the Roses, one of the lords was prophesized that he would die at a certain castle. So he always took pains to avoid that castle. But then in the first The Battle of St Albans, he was wounded and died outside a pub that had that castle on its pub sign. <b>You have to look at prophecies carefully and look at the weasel-wording.</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>(George R. R. Martin, <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2015/04/12/game-thrones-cersei-flashback/?asdf=&amp;hootPostID=7dbf8334a2e354db75463cc29a0cb5ca\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, 04/12/2015)</p><p>Martin is specifically talking about two types of prophecies here in the examples he gives: the <i><b>self-fulfilling prophecy</b></i> and the <i><b>non-literal prophecy</b></i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I think it has become more and more clear that <b>Cersei&rsquo;s prophecy that she received from Maggy the Frog is headed in the style of a <i>self-fulfilling</i> prophecy. </b>That Cersei, in actively trying to prevent the prophecy from happening, has inevitably caused it <i>to</i> happen.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0664a2e22a0cd4f01248222187309f56/tumblr_inline_pmhd50VLin1qi5869_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Leaving aside the <i>Valonqar</i> part of the prophecy for now, (since the show left it out too), one point of it that people continue to argue over is who the <b>Younger, More Beautiful Queen</b> part of this prophecy refers to. However, in a way, it is actually <i>unimportant</i>. Because with a self-fulfilling prophecy, <b>the YMBQ could have been <i>anyone</i>.</b> Or, at least, any girl who had a realistic chance of becoming Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. <b>There was never one designated person it was destined to be</b>. Which means Sansa, Margaery, Daenerys and, adding in the books, you can probably place Arianne Martell in the group as well, each could have been the YMBQ. <b>The important part is/was how <i>Cersei reacted</i> to the threat of each of these women to BE the YMBQ</b>, NOT who the woman actually <i>was</i>. Because again, <i>it could have been any one of them.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>For those who know Harry Potter, it is very much in line with Voldemort hearing that the person who can defeat him will be born &ldquo;as the seventh month dies.&rdquo; As HP book readers know, there were <i>two</i> boys born at the end of July - Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. It was Voldemort <i>himself</i> who picked Harry as the Chosen One when he went to kill him in Godric&rsquo;s Hollow on that Halloween night. However, it could have just as easily <i>not</i> been Harry if Voldemort had picked and gone to kill Neville instead. <i>Voldemort</i> chose his rival, not fate or destiny.</p><p><b>I think the YMBQ part of Cersei&rsquo;s prophecy is the same type of self-fulfilling&nbsp;prophecy that we see in Harry Potter, where <i>Voldemort</i> <i>chose</i> his rival, but with a slight twist</b>.&nbsp;With Sansa and Margaery both, Cersei <i>recognized</i> them as threats, as the potential YMBQ of the prophecy she got, and worked to neutralize them as such in any way she could think of. <b>However, the YMBQ has very likely become the person who Cersei <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> think of as a threat and work to stop from being one until it was actually too late: Daenerys.</b> (Though I do think Arianne Martell still might have chance to be this in the books in some way, even possibly jointly along with Daenerys, since we don&rsquo;t know the direction&nbsp;Arianne&rsquo;s story will go in relation to Cersei in the books). <b>One of the underlying story threads of both the books and the show is how no one in Westeros is paying/paid all that much attention to Dany and the possible threat she poses</b>,<b> particularly to the Lannisters</b> &hellip; and possibly to Cersei herself. <b>Not until it&rsquo;s looking to be too late to really do anything about it.</b> Not until <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> at least, (as far as the books go), when it is now possibly too late to stop her from being one.&nbsp;</p><p>Which makes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tk5hKomP4MA?t=101\">the scene in the show of <i>Joffrey</i> of all people recognizing the threat she is so early on drip with irony</a>. (Start at 1:42)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p><b><i>Cersei</i> <i>chose</i> who the YMBQ was, by <i>not</i> choosing to see the threat one of the candidates presented to her.</b> Like Voldemort did, Cersei has/is choosing the instruments of her own destruction, and making the prophecy come true, especially by living her life actively engaging with her prophecy and trying to prevent it. </p><p>And from the little we know of him via the books and lore, this appears to have also been Rhaegar Targaryen&rsquo;s downfall as well, actively engaging and living his life based on a prophecy. <b>However, in Rhaegar&rsquo;s case, the prophecy doesn&rsquo;t look to be self-fulfilling so much as being a <i>non-literal</i> prophecy.</b> Non-literal prophecies are way more tricky to engage in and with, and may actually <i>lead to</i> the event that the prophecy says is destined to be <i>stopped</i>. &nbsp;</p><p>We see a version of this type of prophecy (awkwardly done) in the Star Wars prequels. &ldquo;Anakin Skywalker is destined to destroy the Sith and bring balance to The Force.&rdquo; Which yes,&nbsp;Anakin&nbsp;<i>did</i> destroy the Sith; but only <i>after</i> he helped the Sith to destroy the Jedi and became a Sith Lord <i>himself</i>. (Which then brought balance to the force after he killed Palpatine and then he - as Vader - died as well because then the only one left was Jedi Luke, I guess? Again, I said it was <i>awkwardly</i> done, not perfectly done). So yes, if you look at that prophecy literally, Anakin Skywalker <i>did </i>destroy the Sith. It was just the nature of <i><b>why</b></i> and <i><b>how</b></i> this prophecy would come to be true and be fulfilled that was what was missing: that Anakin would help to wipe out the Jedi <i>first </i>BEFORE destroying the Sith.&nbsp;</p><p>A better example of this, with the&nbsp;<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique used that Martin mentions above, is another example from the Shakespeare play <i>Macbeth,</i>&nbsp;and the character of Macduff. Macbeth is told by the three witches that&nbsp;&ldquo;no man of woman born&rdquo; can kill him, so Macbeth goes though the play thinking that he can not be killed by any man. Turns out, however, that&nbsp;Macduff was actually born via a medieval version of a c-section:</p><blockquote><p><i>And let the angel whom thou still hast served <br />Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother&rsquo;s womb <br />Untimely ripped&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>So Macduff technically wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;born&rdquo; in the traditional sense as known of at that time. And so yes, Macduff is the one who ultimately kills Macbeth.</p><p>And I think <i>that</i> is that type of prophecy - <b>one of non-literal interpretation - is what we are looking at when it comes to the prophecy in ASOIAF/GOT about&nbsp;The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Let me start by pointing out: <i><b>there is no Night King in the books</b></i>. In the lore of the world there is a <i>Night&rsquo;s</i> King (possessive S), <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_King\">who was this guy</a>:</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af4ccfc39d1a4389fa35961de3fc3307/tumblr_inline_pmhek7SlTL1qi5869_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>The 13th Lord Commander of the Night&rsquo;s Watch</b>. Bran mentions him in <i>A Storm of Swords,</i> and <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i> talks about him as well. It is said that he was a Stark, possibly the brother of the then-current King of Winter. <b>In brief, his story was thus:</b> he saw a woman for atop the wall one night&nbsp;\"with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars.&ldquo; He fell in love with her even though&nbsp;\"her skin was cold as ice&rdquo; and, when he gave her his seed, he gave her his soul as well. <b>With her, he claimed the Nightfort as his castle and declared himself as King and her his Queen. There, he ruled for 13 years until the King of Winter and the King-Beyond-The-Wall brought him down</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as we know so far, the <i>Night&rsquo;s</i> King has no relation or connection to <i>this</i> guy from the show, known as the <i>Night</i> King (no possessive S):</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7e66568595e90042da76e31f0b0f0/tumblr_inline_pmiqnj3dKZ1qi5869_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Not least of which because <b>their backstories are compelty different.</b> The Night King of the show was created by the Children of the Forest for their war against the First Men, which clearly happened years - if not decades - before the end of the first Long Night (which, itself, lasted a generation), the construction of The Wall and the formation of the Night&rsquo;s Watch.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m bringing up the <i>Night&rsquo;s</i> King and <i>Night</i> King difference - and that the Night King is show-only - because of one particular story point with regards to the <i>Night&rsquo;s</i> King that I don&rsquo;t want anyone confusing with the <i>Night</i> King of the show. And that is: when the Night&rsquo;s King was finally brought down, it was discovered that he had been making sacrifices to The Others, aka the White Walkers. The lore never <i>directly</i> says what type of sacrifices he was making to them.<b> However, given what we&rsquo;ve seen presented in both the books and the show, there appears to only be one type of sacrifices The Others/White Walkers have ever appeared to take: human babies.</b></p><p>As we&rsquo;ve seen in both the books and the show, Craster was somehow able to negotiate with The Others/White Walkers to make an agreement to sacrifice his own sons to them. So it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be much of a stretch to assume that the Night&rsquo;s King was able to make some similar type of deal to sacrifice any children he made with his Queen to them as well.&nbsp;</p><p><b>So what do The Others/White Walkers want?<i>&nbsp;We already know what they want. </i>The books, the lore and the show have all already told us, and even </b><i><b>shown</b></i><b> us, what&nbsp;they want.</b> Twice now, they have made deals and taken human sacrifices - babies - and left the places south of the wall alone when they have received such things. There is no reason to believe that they would never do so again. <b>We just don&rsquo;t know <i>why</i> they want what they do, which is a different question than asking <i>what</i> they want.&nbsp;</b></p><p>So, knowing this, how might this tie into the prophecy of&nbsp;The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>First off, in the books, the wording of the prophecy falls very much into the&nbsp;<i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique that Martin himself talks about. Because the person who speaks the most about the prophecy, Melisandre, talks about the prophecy being about&nbsp;The Prince Who Was Promised <i>and</i> Azor Ahai <i>interchangeably</i>. Her talking about the prophecy in this way gives the impression that&nbsp;The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai are one-in-the-same, and one is just another name for the other.</p><p><b>However, what if that is not the case.</b> Now, it&rsquo;s complicated because the show has never either mentioned nor referred to&nbsp;Azor Ahai, (except for possibly as just an easter egg in a book Gilly is seen reading in S7), but has used the wording more associated with&nbsp;Azor Ahai to talk about&nbsp;The Prince Who Was Promised.&nbsp;</p><p>Another problem is that there is no one-description of what the prophecy actually <i>is</i>. In <i>A Storm of Swords</i> (<b>Davos III</b>),&nbsp;Melisandre says this:</p><blockquote><p><i>When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.</i>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Pretty straight forward. But again,<b> this talks about&nbsp;Azor Ahai being reborn and how, <i>not </i>saying anything about&nbsp;The Prince Who Was Promised, or them being the same person.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>And then, of course, there is the gender pronoun confusion</b>, which is mentioned both in the books and the show,<b> both</b> <b>dealing with the mistranslation about The Prince Who Was Promised</b>. Maester Aemon in <i>A Feast For Crows</i>&nbsp;(<b>Samwell IV</b>) says:</p><blockquote><p><i>What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. <b>Dragons are neither male nor female,</b> Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years.</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>The prophecy originally having been made using the word for <i>dragon</i> in High Valyrian, and dragons, by nature, have no fixed gender. (The lore giving various opinions of if dragons can continually change sex at will or not. The only real way to tell if a dragon is male or female is if it lays eggs or not).&nbsp;</p><p>And in the show (<b>Episode 7x02</b>) Missandei says:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>That noun has no gender in High Valyrian.</b> The proper translation for that prophecy would be, &lsquo;the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.&rsquo;</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><b>So what we have here is not only confusion as to whether or not Azor Ahai reborn is supposed to be the same person as The Prince Who Was Promised, but also <i>gender confusion</i> about <b>The Prince Who Was Promised&nbsp;</b>because High Valyrian nouns are not gender specific.</b> On top of which, the show has only talked opening about The Prince Who Was Promised, but made no mention of Azor Ahai and him possibly being reborn <i>as</i> the prince who was promised or not.</p><p>Then of course, also from the books, <b>we have the knowledge that a song was composed for The Prince Who Was Promised</b>, which is called/known as&nbsp;&ldquo;the song of ice and fire&rdquo; which Daenerys learns of in her vision in the House of the Undying. (<i>ACOK</i>, <b>Daenerys IV</b>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>I&rsquo;m not the first person to suggest that The Prince Who Was Promised and Azor Ahai reborn are two different people</b> and that, between the mistranslations and gender confusion, the two things got mixed up together. But to make it clear, I&rsquo;d say <b>Azor Ahai is the one who will be reborn via salt and smoke who will wake dragons from stone</b>, and that <b>The Prince Who Was Promised is a separate prophecy, and person, and is the one who &ldquo;will bring the dawn.&rdquo;&nbsp;</b></p><p>So what does this have to do with The Others/White Walkers? Well, this is where more of that that <i><b>weasel-wording</b> </i>technique Martin calls it comes in. In that what if The Prince Who Was Promised was actually promised <i>to</i> something - or someone. Namely, The Others/White Walkers. And what if it was a promise Azor Ahai <i>himself </i>made to them? It would go a ways to explain why the two are always connected to each other</p><p>If you look at the actual history of the First Long Night,&nbsp;<b>Azor Ahai never actually&nbsp;</b><i><b>defeated</b></i><b> The Others/White Walkers. He and the members of the first Night&rsquo;s Watch were able to drive them back, and had them flee into the Lands of Always Winter, but they were never defeated completely.</b> Which is why The Wall was built in the first place and The Night&rsquo;s Watch established - to guard <i>against</i> The Others/White Walkers coming back south and taking over the realms of Men as they did during the First Long Night.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be496d497142e862a19df7c6a121b16c/tumblr_inline_pobg04Kybu1qi5869_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>So what if it was Azor Ahai himself who promised this&nbsp;&ldquo;prince&rdquo; to The Others/White Walker as a way to keep them from trying to invade the realms of Men another time?</b> Again, via both the 13th LC of the NW and Craster, we know making pacts/deals with The Others/White Walkers is possible in some way. <b>So, who is this&nbsp;&ldquo;prince who was promised&rdquo;? Yeah, I could just say Jon Snow, (because that&rsquo;s what it likely looks like I&rsquo;m about to say), but actually no, what if it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> him? Or, more specifically, what if it was <i>supposed</i> to be him but, once again, the prophecy got slightly misinterpted?</b></p><p>Put a pin in this. We&rsquo;ll come back to it. For now, let&rsquo;s go back to the 13th LC and Craster.</p><p>According to Old Nan, the 13th LC was a Stark, meaning he contained the blood of the First Men. <b>The blood of the First Men is thought to carry some magical properties, particularly within the Stark family bloodline, which contain warging and greenseer abilities.</b> And the Stark Kings of old were known as the Kings of Winter. So by the 13th LC likely sacrificing children of his blood that he made with his Night&rsquo;s Queen, he was providing The Others/White Walkers children that carried a strong magical element in their blood.</p><p><b>Throughout the story and the lore, the Stark are also associated with Ice. Even their Great Valyrian Sword is called simply&nbsp;&ldquo;Ice.&rdquo;&nbsp;</b><br /></p><p><b>With Craster</b>, <b>things are less certain there wrt the magical elements. </b>Wildlings, which his mother was said to be, are also of the Blood of the First men, but it is not clear if the magical element is a strong among the Wildings as it is with the Starks. <b>The main point, however, is that The Others/White Walkers accepted Craster&rsquo;s sons as offerings, just as they did from the Night&rsquo;s King/13th LC. So they were clearly deemed as acceptable in that regard.</b>&nbsp;Because, at the very least, they carried the blood of the First Men in them, from Craster&rsquo;s Wildling mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>[<b>Side Note:</b> <b>There is probably going to be a plot-hole in the show wrt Craster&rsquo;s kids - Gilly&rsquo;s baby Little Sam specifically. Because, in the books, there is a baby-switching plot going on with Gilly&rsquo;s baby</b>, (he isn&rsquo;t named Little Sam in the books, he&rsquo;s just referred to as&nbsp;<i>Monster</i> instead), <b>and Mance Rayder&rsquo;s baby son.</b> (Yes, Mance has a baby son in the books). Jon more or less forced Gilly to switch her son with Mance&rsquo;s baby son to try and protect Mance&rsquo;s son from possibly being killed/burned to death. So that is the fate that might actually befall Gilly&rsquo;s baby son in the books while Jon is still currently dead, leaving NONE of Craster&rsquo;s sons alive after that.]&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>So what we have here are two instances of sacrifices to The Others being made and accepted by the Others/White Walkers. And again, the only thing we&rsquo;ve seen The Others/White Walkers take as a sacrifice are babies.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s go back and look at The Prince Who Was Promised and, more specifically, the thing Rhaegar says about the song composed for him, specifically called&nbsp;&ldquo;The Song of Ice and Fire.&rdquo; As we all know, that is the actual title of Martin&rsquo;s book series that the tv show <i>Game of Thrones</i> is based on. And, of course, <b>Jon being the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark have many thinking he is &ldquo;The Prince Who Was Promised&rdquo; and the&nbsp;&ldquo;song of ice and fire&rdquo; because of his blood combination.</b> <b>However, there is another thing in the lore with the title Ice and Fire in it that is being overlooked here </b>that I think is very significant, particularly wrt The Others/White Walkers.</p><p>And that is,<b>&nbsp;<i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i></b>.&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> was a pact forged between House Stark and House Targaryen, (more specifically the black faction of House Targaryen during the Dance of Dragons). <b>As it is described in <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i>, it was an agreement between the two houses that a Stark male would wed a Targaryen Princess.</b> (The recent book<i> Fire and Blood</i> gives more of an account and specifics of <i>who </i>the Princess would be &hellip; or, at least, who her <i>father</i> was supposed to be). The pact, however, was never fulfilled after The Dance ended.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What is the significant part of this is what House Stark was specifically asking for, which was a Targaryen <i>princess</i>. Cregan Stark specifically wanted a young Targaryen&nbsp;<i>girl</i> to wed into the Stark family.&nbsp;</p><p>As explained above, via both the books/lore and the show, <b>the Starks have a connection to the happenings with The Others/White Walkers.</b>&nbsp;We have the story of the 13 Lord Commander/Night&rsquo;s King. We know about Bran the Builder who, with the help of the Children of the Forest (and giants) helped raise the wall to guard against them invading again.<b> I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a stretch to believe that the Kings of Winter of ages past, as the Stark Kings were first called, not only <i>knew</i> about &ldquo;The Prince Who Was Promised,&rdquo; but likely also what the true meaning of what this prince/princess&nbsp;<i>being</i> promised was all about.</b> That whomever this prince/princess was, when born, they would be given to the The Others, who had been promised to them by&nbsp;Azor Ahai.&nbsp;</p><p>So what might this have to do with the <i>Pact of Ice and Fire</i> and requesting a Targaryen princess to marry into House Stark? I think a clue comes from Book 2, <i>A Clash of Kings</i>, and Daenerys&rsquo; encounter with The Undying in the House of the Undying.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f51c4054946c4c1a6b8cd02f3f7bd89c/tumblr_inline_pobikwIDyK1qi5869_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In ACOK, the Undying Ones are described in a way that has them seeming to be a representation of The Others/White Walkers; with them being described as&nbsp;&ldquo;blue and cold.&rdquo; And then there is this passage, where they try to consume Daenerys (<b>Daenerys IV, ACOK</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>They wanted her, needed her<b>, the fire, the life, </b>and Dany gasped and opened her arms to give herself to them &hellip;</i></p><p><i>But then black wings buffeted her round the head, and a scream of fury cut the <b>indigo air</b>, and suddenly the visions were gone, ripped away, and Dany&rsquo;s gasp turned to horror. <b>The Undying were all around her,</b> <b>blue and cold</b>, whispering as they reached for her, pulling, stroking, tugging at her clothes, touching her with their <b>dry cold hands</b>, twining their fingers through her hair. All the strength had left her limbs. She could not move. <b>Even her heart had ceased to beat.</b> She felt a hand on her bare breast, twisting her nipple. Teeth found the soft skin of her throat. A mouth descended on one eye, licking, sucking, biting &hellip;</i></p><p><i><b><i>Then indigo</i></b><i> turned to <b>orange</b>, and whispers turned to screams. <b>Her heart was pounding, racing, the hands and mouths were gone</b>, heat washed over her skin, and Dany blinked at a sudden glare. <b>Perched above her, the dragon spread his wings and</b> <b>tore at the terrible dark heart, ripping the rotten flesh to ribbons</b>, and when his head snapped forward, <b>fire flew from his open jaws, bright and hot</b>. She could hear the shrieks of the Undying as they burned, their high thin papery voices crying out in tongues long dead. &ldquo;</i><br /></i></p></blockquote><p>Here we have the Undying, who are described in terms of cold and death, linking them in many way to The Others/White Walkers, trying to consume the fire - which is linked to life - of Daenerys. (And they almost succeeded until Drogon saves her).&nbsp;</p><p><b>There is indication that The Undying have been waiting for Daenerys for thousands of years before this moment.</b> <b>They want the lifeforce, <i>the fire</i> that she has, when she finally comes. </b>So what we have here are creatures associated with imagery of - and visually linked to - creatures of death, (The Others/White Walkers), trying to to consume a life,<b><i> the fire</i></b>, from someone of Valyrian descent. <b>Valyrian blood constantly linked to that of fire, and fire, throughout&nbsp;the series, is linked to life.</b> House Targaryen&rsquo;s own words (a house motto they chose when Aegon the Conqueror first began his conquest and wanted his family to adopt more Westerosi culture BTW - they never had a House motto before that) is <i>Fire and Blood</i>, two images also associated with life.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Just like The Undying, The Others/White Walkers also appear to be seeking life of some kind.</b> The taking of babies, and then using those babies to create more of their kind by turning them into Others/White Walkers I think ties into this. However, they very well might be something missing from what they seek out of this. A life-force that contains what The Undying were trying to <i>take</i> from Daenerys - <i>a fire</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>How is a new life <i>usually</i> created? Male and Female coming together. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nIbFw-brBvw?t=70\"><i>Melisandre alludes to the power of that ability - to create life - in the scene when she tries to seduce Jon in Season 5</i></a> (<b>Episode 5x04</b>) (Start at: 1:10)&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p>And then of course, there is the quote from the book that she says in this seduction scene (which wasn&rsquo;t a seduction scene in the book btw), from <i>A Dance with Dragons</i> (<b>Jon VI</b>):&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>The Lord of Light in his wisdom made us male and female, two parts of a greater whole. In our joining there is power. Power to make life. Power to make light. Power to cast shadows.</i></p></blockquote><p>I think the show was being a bit more hard-hitting in the foreshadowing than the book by having Melisandre say these words while appearing to try and <i>seduce</i> Jon. <b>That there is power in the ability - in the <i>act</i> - of men and women coming together and creating life. </b>Unlike The Others/White Walkers, who can only create more of themselves by taking an already living creation - in this case, a child - and turning them into a being like them, a being of the cold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, even with the power of men and women to do this, The Undying specifically were waiting for and sought out <i>Daenerys</i> for that life, <i>that fire</i>, that they needed. <b>And that may be because, while both male and female coming together can create life and light, it is the <i>female</i> who brings forth that light and life&nbsp;<i>into</i> the world via childbirth.&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>There is a running theme of motherhood, and what that means, throughout&nbsp;Daenerys&rsquo; story. She is called Mhysa by the people she liberated from slavery and metaphorically&nbsp;giving&nbsp;them new life as free&nbsp;people. She birthed creatures that are considered to be fire made flesh via</b><i> <b>fire itself</b></i><b>.</b></p><p>I think <i>this</i> is why <i>The Pact of Ice and Fire</i> called for a Targaryen <i>princess</i> to wed into House Stark. <b>That the need for a joining of Ice and Fire had to specially be that the fruits of that joining, the life created from it, be <i>born</i> of fire; </b>born via a daughter - a female - who carried such fire within her, which those of Valyrian descent do.&nbsp;</p><p>And this is where Rhaegar Targaryen made one of his many mistakes when it comes to the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. At some point I do think Rhaegar thought he needed a child who was - bloodline-wise - of&nbsp;&ldquo;ice and fire.&rdquo; <b>Rhaegar had already changed his life twice-over trying to fulfill the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy. There is no reason to assume he wouldn&rsquo;t have done it again if he came into more info about it. </b>For all he did likley love Lyanna, I think it&rsquo;s probable that he also saw their child as the one who would make this prophecy he&rsquo;d been chasing most of his life come true &hellip; after first thinking it was about himself, and then thinking it would be about his three children he would (hopefully) have, and the idea that &ldquo;the dragon has three heads.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>However, again, Rhaegar was incorrect, not just about what the whole idea of The Prince That Was Promised actually meant, but how the blood combination of Ice and Fire was supposed to be &hellip; or, more specifically, how the child had to be born. <b>Because Lyanna wasn&rsquo;t fire, or the blood of fire. She was of </b><i><b>ice</b>, </i><b>with the blood of the First Men within her, not the blood of Old Valyria. And the Prince Who Was Promised more than likely&nbsp;had to be born of <i>fire</i>, via a female </b><i><b>with the blood of fire</b>.</i></p><p>From <i>A Game of Thrones</i> (<b>Daenerys X</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>No, she wanted to shout to him, no my good knight, do not fear for me. <b>The fire is mine.</b> I am Daenerys Stormborn, <b>daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons</b>, don&rsquo;t you see? Don&rsquo;t you SEE?</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Blood of the Dragon</i> are what those of blood of Old Valyria are called. Dragons are fire made flesh. Those of the blood Old Valyria, the Targaryens, like dragons, are also likely fire made flesh. And <i>fire</i> is life and light.&nbsp;</p><p><b>And the coming together of <i>that </i>fire with ice is symbolic of <i>balance.</i></b>&nbsp;From <i>A Clash of Kings</i> (<b>Daenerys IV</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I have come for the gift of truth,&rdquo; Dany said. &ldquo;In the long hall, the things I saw &hellip; were they true visions, or lies? Past things, or things to come? What did they mean?&rdquo;\n&hellip; the shape of shadows &hellip; morrows not yet made &hellip; <b>drink from the cup of ice</b> &hellip; <b>drink from the cup of fire</b> &hellip;\n&hellip; mother of dragons &hellip; child of three &hellip;</i></p></blockquote><p>And from <i>A Storm of Swords</i> (<b>Bran II</b>):</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Because they&rsquo;re different,&rdquo;</b> he insisted. &ldquo;Like night and day, <b>or ice and fire.</b>\"&nbsp;</i></p><p><i><b>\"If ice can burn,&rdquo;</b> said Jojen in his solemn voice, <b>&ldquo;then love and hate can mate &hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</b></i></p></blockquote><p><b>* * *</b><br /></p><p><b>A great video that talks about the idea of balance</b> between ice (Jon) and fire (Dany) <b>and visual&nbsp;symbols&nbsp;the show uses to convey this </b>connection to each other, along with The Others/White Walkers/Night King.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p><b>* * *</b></p><p><b>In the show, The Night King is likely a visual representation of a being known as The Great Other from the books/lore. </b>(Since, again, The Night King doesn&rsquo;t exist&nbsp;in the books).<b> The Great Other is said to be the god of cold, darkness and death,</b> and he has no physical appearance, likely being a more metaphysical entity given the little we know.<b> He is considered to be the enemy of the Lord of Light, known as R'hllor.</b> In the show, killing the Night King will likely be the equivalent of defeating The Great Other in the books.</p><p>The actor who plays the Night King <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/03/07/night-king-game-of-thrones-interview/\">gave a recent interview</a> which seems to support the idea that part of his character is likely based on The Great Other from the books:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>What does the Night King want, anyway?</b></i></p><p><i>Somebody made him the Night King. Nobody knows who he was before &mdash; a soldier or part of [nobility]. He never wanted to be the Night King. I think he wants revenge. Everybody in this story has two sides &mdash; a bad side and a good side. The Night King only has one side, a bad side.</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>Thinking the Night King wants revenge isn&rsquo;t the same as that being what he definitely wants. <b>However, the idea that the Night King only has a bad side seems to fit with the view of what The Great Other is and represents in the books/lore, which is the god of darkness and death. </b>However, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s all that cut and dry even via what The Great Other/Night King is. Because evil acts can be committed by those who fight for the light, such as good acts can likely be committed by those who fight for darkness/death. Melisandre&rsquo;s burning of Shireen Baratheon, which Martin has already confirmed will happen in the books as well, is proof enough of that. &nbsp;</p><p>Also, from the recent interview, there is this:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>What can we expect from him in the final season?</b></i></p><p><i>People will see he has a target he wants to kill, and you will find out who that is. There&rsquo;s also that moment [in &ldquo;Hardhome&rdquo;] when Jon Snow was on the boat and the Night King looked at him and raised his arms &mdash; there&rsquo;s a similar and even stronger moment between Jon and the Night King this time.</i> &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><b>I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear that that target <i>isn&rsquo;t </i>Jon Snow. He had more than one opportunity to kill Jon, but proceeded instead to mostly just taunt him.</b> I don&rsquo;t think the target is Daenerys either, or he could have easily killed Drogon and gotten her when she came beyond the wall in Episode 6 of Season 7.</p><p>The Three-eyed Raven/Crow being the target - with that now being Bran, is an option I admit, however &hellip; the original Three-Eyed Raven/Crow, who was Brynden Rivers aka Bloodraven, had been the Three-Eyed Raven/Crow for many years, and there is little to no indication that The Night King was actively trying to kill him during any of that time.</p><p><b>However, what if the killing of the target doesn&rsquo;t mean just &ldquo;to kill,&rdquo; so much in the sense of what we saw happen to the former Three-Eyed Raven in the show,</b> <b>but is more in the vein of what happened to Daenerys in the House of the Undying in the books, when the Undying tried to take her life-force from her.</b></p><p>And the person they want to do this with is actually the <i>child</i> Daenerys and Jon will/have created?</p><p><b>Because the foreshadowing that Jon and Daenerys will have a child in the coming season was pretty obvious, not to mention Daenerys whole underlying story theme and motif of motherhood. </b>Also, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CczKaabSRfU?t=76\">do not overlook this clip, which HBO chose to highlight before the start of Season 8,</a> where Viserys makes this comment about the child that Dany is set to have with Khal Drogo (<b>Episode 1x06</b>) (Start: 1:16):</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><blockquote><p><i>He won&rsquo;t be a real Targaryen.

(In fact, I think Jon&rsquo;s going to learn a hard lesson about that when the baby switching plot he instigated wrt Gilly&rsquo;s baby in the books plays out to a tragic end for Gilly&rsquo;s baby). <b>If they can find a way to defeat The Others/White Walkers without having to make such a sacrifice and basically taking the easy way out to do so, they may also guarantee that this time, The Others/White Walkers will truly be destroyed and gone forever this time.</b> Instead of what Azor Ahai did, which only seemed to have the go into some kind of slumber and dormancy, and staying in the lands beyond the wall.</p><p><b>However, there may be some among Jon and Daenerys&rsquo; army and/or advisors who would want to take the easy route and give the child over to end the conflict quickly</b>, which - while pushing off the problem again for another couple of thousands years - could prevent many people from dying and becoming a part of the Army of the Dead and overrunning Westeros as was what happened during the first Long Night. (Which didn&rsquo;t stay limited to only Westeros, but spread over almost all of Essos as well).</p><p>In the show, Daenerys&rsquo; story has a theme about wanting to&nbsp;&ldquo;break the wheel&rdquo;; the wheel being the nature of the political dynamics of Westeros that benefits the more Noble Classes that fight for power and dominance, symbolized by the Iron Throne, and those who do not benefit from that ongoing struggle, which are the lower classes and smallfolk of Westeros. They are the ones who are always crushed underneath this wheel, this circular nature of the political power fights and wars.&nbsp;</p><p><b>However, this idea of&nbsp;&ldquo;breaking the wheel&rdquo; may also, in the end, extend to the fight against The Others/White Walkers.</b> As noted, this is not the first time they have invaded the realms of men. And, the last time they did, they were not defeated. The problem they are, the threat they pose, seems to have been pushed off to another generation to have to fight, combat and deal with. And at the center of that fight to do so might just rest with Ice and Fire coming together to create something new. <b>However, the prophecy that has dictated the lives of many people that has lead to this, has never dictated the lives of the two people who may have the most influence in The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy coming to fruition. </b>Neither Jon or Daenerys have lived their lives or made decisions in their lives sorley to fulfil a prophecy. <b>And given what was very likely the <i>weasel-wording</i> technique used for The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy, the fact that they did so may, in the end, be the deciding factor in the breaking of <i>another</i> wheel, another cycle of destruction.</b>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ad7a30aee294fcf2ca367f6036e2f18/tumblr_inline_podb5g0cdu1qi5869_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",

The Youtube channel Talking Thrones <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEud33zwWCA\">posted a video</a> that talks in a few of the same directions I write about here; and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1UHGTGlDDT-LfHGij5Xggg\">@oadara</a> and I discussed a lot of this between us over DM, so much of this comes out of that as well.</p>\n<p>So there are two main prophecies most people focus on when it comes to ASOIAF/GOT, which are:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>- The prophecy that Maggy the Frog</b> gave to Cersei when she was a girl.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>- The Prince Who Was Promised/Azor Ahai prophecy</b> that talks of a coming hero who will save the world from the coming darkness.</p>\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at <b>what George R. R. Martin himself says about prophecies</b>, particularly in fantasy fiction:</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>Prophecy is a staple element in fantasy, but it&rsquo;s tricky,&rdquo; Martin noted. &ldquo;You want to play with the notion of prophecies coming true but in an unexpected way. You want to be unpredictable about it. Shakespeare is the ultimate example of that&mdash;when the forest of Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane Castle, MacBeth will fall. Everybody laughs&mdash;how can the forest come to the castle. [Malcolm] came camouflaged with branches and so on. Also, during the War of the Roses, one of the lords was prophesized that he would die at a certain castle. So he always took pains to avoid that castle. But then in the first The Battle of St Albans, he was wounded and died outside a pub that had that castle on its pub sign. <b>You have to look at prophecies carefully and look at the weasel-wording.</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n<p>(George R. R. Martin, <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2015/04/12/game-thrones-cersei-flashback/?asdf=&amp;hootPostID=7dbf8334a2e354db75463cc29a0cb5ca\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, 04/12/2015)</p>\n<p>Martin is specifically talking about two types of prophecies here in the examples he gives: the <i><b>self-fulfilling prophecy</b></i> and the <i><b>non-literal prophecy</b></i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",
