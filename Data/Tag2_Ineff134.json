Yes, he does that. But it's the care C puts into the tending the plants, the touch of his fingers on the leaves, buds, and stems, that makes them thrive",

No, what stopped Aziraphale in his tracks was\nthe fact that, even after all the bombings and destruction that London had seen\nin the past few years, the shop was still standing. It had been there nearly as\nlong as his own shop had; it wasn\u2019t <i>always </i>a jewellery shop of course, but it was the precedent of the thing.

For, you see, as of late\n(<i>i.e. the past several thousand years</i>) the angel had run into a bit of a\ndilemma; rather a\u2026 <i>moral conundrum</i>,\nif you will, because love is never a <i>bad\nthing</i>. No, no, no; love is always indefinitely <i>good</i>.</small></p><p><small>But coming to the realization that he was in love with a\ndemon? The very demon standing five feet ahead of him on the sidewalk? A demon who\ncould in the most literal sense be called \u201ca bad thing\u201d \u2013 even if Aziraphale\nwas quite certain there was a spark of goodness in him, deep down inside? <i>That </i>was the conundrum. Thus, for\ncenturies now, he\u2019d found himself flustered whenever the topic of love was\nbroached in Crowley\u2019s presence, lest his true feelings accidentally slip out \u2013\nand today was no exception. </small></p><p><small>Stuttering slightly in his search for words, Aziraphale flit\nhis eyes rapidly over the contents of the shop\u2019s display window until they\nsettled, finally, on a simple gold ring sitting on a velvet cushion. </small></p><p><small>\u201cMe?

I\u2019ve told you I like your shoes on multiple\noccasions, but would I wear them?\u201d</small></p><p><small>The demon arched an eyebrow at <i>that </i>comment before looking down in a way that all but screamed \u2018<i>what\u2019s\nwrong with my shoes????</i>\u2019 and Aziraphale blushed. He was getting flustered. He\nnever should have stopped walking. They could be halfway to being sloshed by\nnow - or at least halfway to being <i>warm</i>.</small></p><p><small>\u201cDo you want it?\u201d</small></p><p><small><i>That </i>certainly didn\u2019t\nhelp with his being flustered. Stammering for a moment after Crowley looked up\nagain and asked him <i>that</i> question,\nAziraphale asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cThe ring. Do you want it?\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 Well, that is\u2026 It\u2019s lovely, but I\u2026 I couldn\u2019t\npossibly\u2026\u201d</small></p><p><small>Going into a jewellery store with Crowley? Buying a ring\nwith Crowley? A ring that he\u2019d only pointed out to begin with as a way of\ngetting <i>away</i> from the subject of \u2018love\u2019\nbefore he said something foolish? He <i>really\n</i>couldn\u2019t possibly. So, he did what he always did when faced with his feelings; he deflected.</small></p><p><small>\u201cMy dear boy, look at you! You\u2019re positively frozen,\nstanding here on the street. Let\u2019s get a move on before you turn blue.\u201d</small></p><p><small>Linking his arm through Crowley\u2019s, who did look quite cold,\nAziraphale pulled the demon away from the jewellery shop window and down\nthe street to the warmth and security of his bookshop, where they <i>did </i>go on to get thoroughly sloshed.\nThankfully, \u2018love\u2019 didn\u2019t threaten to come up again, even if it was constantly\non the tipsy angel\u2019s mind and perpetually at the tip of his tongue. </small></p><hr><p><small>After a month had gone by, Aziraphale had forgotten all\nabout the ring in the shop window; it had only been a silly deflection tactic,\nafter all, and not of any real consequence. So imagine his surprise when he\nwalked out of the back room on December 25<sup>th</sup> to look for a particular\nWilde first edition that he\u2019d felt like rereading, only to find a small box\nsitting on the counter, wrapped in red paper, with a note propped up against\nit. He hadn\u2019t heard the tinkling of the bell over the door so it had to have\nbeen miracled there, but he couldn\u2019t imagine any of his fellow angels sending\nhim a gift. Contrary to popular belief, angels don\u2019t tend to make a very big\ndeal about celebrating Christmas any more than they would about throwing birthday parties for each other up in Heaven. It simply wasn\u2019t done.</small></p><p><small>That only left one person. Pursing his lips, Aziraphale\npulled his spectacles from where he\u2019d tucked them into the collar of his sweater, slipping them onto his nose before\nplucking up the note and reading what it said:</small></p><blockquote><p><i><small>Angel,</small></i></p><p><i><small>Commercializing\nChristmas really was one of my better ideas, wasn\u2019t it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s right up\nthere with corsets and toilet queues.

Ho ho ho and all that,</small></i></p><p><i><small>Crowley</small></i></p></blockquote><p><small>Scoffing, Aziraphale had rolled his eyes as he sat the note\naside and picked up the box to tear the red paper from it, and he\u2019d had every\nintention of chucking whatever it was straight into the bin; after all, what\nsort of an angel would he be if he indulged Crowley\u2019s insistence upon stealing\nChristmas from Heaven, even <i>if</i> they didn\u2019t celebrate it? It was still <i>their</i> holiday. But then he popped the velvet box open and his eyes had\nwidened to the point of almost being as round as his spectacles. </small></p><p><small>It was the ring. That silly, meaningless little trinket that\nhe\u2019d used to distract Crowley - and himself - from his feelings. The ring that he hadn\u2019t given a second\nthought to. Except now it was hardly silly and meaningless, and all it was\ndoing was bringing his feelings right up to the forefront of his mind <i>and </i>his heart. </small></p><p><small><i><b>Crowley got him the\nring</b></i>. He\u2019d listened to Aziraphale babble about how lovely it was, and then\nhe <i>went back and got it for him</i> after\nthey parted following their evening of drunken nonsense. And, looking at it\nnow, wedged into its little box and shining so brightly in the dusty little\nbookshop, Aziraphale realized that it really <i>was</i> quite beautiful. </small></p><p><small>\u201cOh bother,\u201d he muttered to himself, pulling the ring from\nthe box and staring at it in the light for a long moment before sighing and\nslipping it onto his left pinkie finger. It fit perfectly. </small></p><p><small>Despite his very best efforts not to, he smiled. </small></p>",

He hadn\u2019t heard the tinkling of the bell over the door so it had to have\nbeen miracled there, but he couldn\u2019t imagine any of his fellow angels sending\nhim a gift.
