They were married off-screen. Yeah another big #Pepperony event that happens off-screen YAY! Just like the break in\u00a0\u201cCivil War\u201d which we will never know a single thing about. We can add to this the wedding that happened but we never saw, we\u2019ll have to use the power of imagination. I loved to see the ring on Tony\u2019s hand though. I delighted in it. ^^</p><p>My queen Pepper Potts wasn\u2019t nearly enough on screen.

Sure, good times.</p><p>Speaking of this&hellip; Could this funeral be more fast paced? Hey Tony, here you go bye bye. Let\u2019s have 15 minutes more about Captain America\u2019s whereabouts. Russos, Markus, MCFeely we know you love Cap BUT show some respect, because Tony Stark just died sacrificing himself to save the fucking Marvel Multiverse or whatever this quantum time travel shit ended doing with the time-space dimension. Future movies are gonna be a crazy convoluted mess, let me tell you. I don\u2019t care. Won\u2019t be seeing any of them. Good luck explaining THAT. lol :D</p><p>Back to Pepper Potts. She suited up at last, after 22 movies, as RESCUE, and she was a glorious kick ass queen in her purple and gold suit of armour&hellip; YAY! but it wasn\u2019t even close to enough. I think even Valkirye got twice her screentime in that battle, logicall if they want to sell us\u00a0\u201cthe future of the MCU\u201d without shame. Rescue in the final battle was so brief I couldn\u2019t even taste it. No explanation about how or why she finally put herself on the suit, only that she finally wore something her beloved husband did for her (that was super cute, let me tell you).\u00a0But it sure gives the impression that she was only thrown in there because in the moment Tony died she could hold him in her arms. Beautifully acted scene that makes me cry again only thinking about it. Gwyneth Paltrow can give acting skills class to half of the cast in this movies. That\u2019s an Oscar winning actress for you all, take notes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay. You can rest now.\u201d That broke my heart.</p><p>Where the hell is my TEAM IRON MAN battle scene? War Machine, Iron Man and Rescue fighting together like an armored team? Never to be seen. We lose that opportunity, sad forever. :(</p><p>More scenes of Pepper with Tony in their cottage by the lake would have hurt someone? Their everyday life with Morgan? I guess we\u2019ll have to go to fanfic to cover those needs too. \u00ac\u00ac</p><p>\u201cI love you 3000\u2033 made my heart sing. So lovely and cute and Tony telling Pepper how much their daughter loves him. That was the sweetest thing I\u2019ve seen in my life.</p><p>I loved when Tony disguised himself as Howard Potts in front of his father, really made me smile. Tony is so in love with Pepper and respects her so much :) Cutie pie.</p><p>There were truly amazing and cute and lovely scenes that I will treasure forever BUT at the same time\u00a0I\u2019m salty, and pissed, and kinda disappointed, mostly because after 11 years of loyalty, buying ticketts, blu ray, merchan and free promotion of the Marvel brand, we only wanted Tony Stark to retire in the end and truly SEE his wedding with Pepper on screen. It&rsquo;s all we wanted. <b>Retirement for him and to have a good memory of these 11 years forever.</b> Not this sacrificial death thing.\u00a0</p><p>I guess doing the surprise move was more important than viewers satisfaction.\u00a0</p><p>That \u201cwe all want a happy ending but sometimes we can\u2019t have one\u201d sorry Tony/Robert but my soul will always feed on happy endings.

I think even Valkirye got twice her screentime in that battle, logicall if they want to sell us\u00a0\u201cthe future of the MCU\u201d without shame. Rescue in the final battle was so brief I couldn\u2019t even taste it. No explanation about how or why she finally put herself on the suit, only that she finally wore something her beloved husband did for her (that was super cute, let me tell you).\u00a0But it sure gives the impression that she was only thrown in there because in the moment Tony died she could hold him in her arms. Beautifully acted scene that makes me cry again only thinking about it. Gwyneth Paltrow can give acting skills class to half of the cast in this movies.

God, I can&rsquo;t believe this is the real deal. That&rsquo;s it. Tony&rsquo;s dead, Pepper&rsquo;s a widow, Morgan&rsquo;s a fatherless orphan child at age 5. <b>How cool right?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Speaking as a Tony and Pepper fan they give us everything we wished for during all those 11 years, right? Pepperony married and iron baby girl and Rescue&hellip; BUT, there always has to be a <b>but</b>, only to kill Tony, love of my life, Stark in the end and stab our hearts with a knife, and tarnish all our memories of the MCU and this 11 years.&nbsp;</p><p>We didn&rsquo;t get our wedding. They were married off-screen. Yeah another big #Pepperony event that happens off-screen YAY! Just like the break in&nbsp;&ldquo;Civil War&rdquo; which we will never know a single thing about. We can add to this the wedding that happened but we never saw, we&rsquo;ll have to use the power of imagination. I loved to see the ring on Tony&rsquo;s hand though. I delighted in it. ^^</p><p>My queen Pepper Potts wasn&rsquo;t nearly enough on screen. No Mom-Pepper time with Morgan (only the funeral/post-funeral hologram thingy) so so sad.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember when we all thought that scene by the lake was the wedding? Sure, good times.</p><p>Speaking of this&hellip; Could this funeral be more fast paced? Hey Tony, here you go bye bye. Let&rsquo;s have 15 minutes more about Captain America&rsquo;s whereabouts.
