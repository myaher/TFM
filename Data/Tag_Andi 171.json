        "answer": "<h2><a href=\"http://CAPTAINKIPPEN.TUMBLR.COM\">SEND ME FIC PROMPTS</a></h2><hr><p>The night Cyrus turns fifteen he stays up until the early hours of the morning waiting for his soul mark to appear, wondering if he\u2019ll be able to feel it come in and what it will be like if he does. It\u2019s different for everybody; some feel their mark burning as the letters are inscribed into their skin by an invisible hand, others experience a sensation akin to soft lips pressing a gentle kiss upon them, but it\u2019s not unusual to feel nothing at all. He must fall asleep sometime around dawn, the mark still not having appeared. He would\u2019ve noticed if it had, he had been getting up every half an hour to check. When he wakes, groggy and confused, it\u2019s almost noon. It takes him a moment to remember why he\u2019s so tired, then suddenly he\u2019s wide awake once more and leaping out of bed to inspect himself in the mirror.</p><p>A soul mark can appear anywhere on a person\u2019s body. There are theories about the locations, a common belief is that they appear on the site of the first place your soulmate touched or will touch you. Cyrus isn\u2019t so sure about that one because he finally finds his mark he finds it sloping lopsidedly down his left hip, and the words there are instantly recognisable.</p><p><i><b>\u2018You can\u2019t get your own muffin?\u2019</b></i></p><!-- more --><p>The first words TJ ever said to him. He can hear them clear as day in his mind, even the disbelieving tone rings through.</p><p>TJ. His soulmate is TJ. His first and most hysterical thought about this is that the touch theory is definitely wrong because TJ has touched Cyrus many times by now but never on his hip. They\u2019ve knocked hands at the movie theatre fighting for popcorn from the same bucket, the wrestle regularly when TJ\u2019s feeling especially playful, and more than once he\u2019s had TJ wipe an eyelash from his cheekbone using the pad of his thumb.</p><p>Cyrus doesn\u2019t know what else to do but call Buffy.</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d She repeats, voice coming out tinny and muffled through the receiver. \u201c<i>TJ </i>is your <i>soulmate</i>? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m one hundred percent certain,\u201d Cyrus confirmed. He had put the phone on speaker and was back in front of the mirror, the hem of his shirt lifted so he could run his fingers over the deep black lettering of the words. There\u2019s a couple of moments of silence, and then Buffy voices the thought that Cyrus has been most afraid to think about properly himself.</p><p>\u201cThen\u2026 he must <i>know</i>, Cy. He\u2019s older than you, his birthday was months ago. He\u2019ll already have his mark. Did he really never mention anything about it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Cyrus says The awful truth is that he had spent the last few months leading up to this simultaneously wishing that TJ <i>would</i> turn out to be his soulmate, but also kind of hoping that he wouldn\u2019t be because if he hadn\u2019t said anything to Cyrus then maybe he didn\u2019t actually have Cyrus\u2019 words for his mark, and if Cyrus found out he was destined to be with somebody else then surely he\u2019d be able to move on from the crush he had on him. If TJ has Cyrus\u2019 words somewhere on him, then why hadn\u2019t he said anything? Maybe he doesn\u2019t want him.</p><p>\u201cYou have to talk to him,\u201d Buffy says solemnly. \u201cThere has to be a good reason he didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus knows she\u2019s right, she has to be, but he\u2019s also filled with a dreadful sense of terror that speaking to TJ about this might not end well. As it turns out, he doesn\u2019t have much of a chance to put off calling him because TJ arrives at the Goodmans\u2019 house before Cyrus can even get downstairs to eat breakfast.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d TJ greets him, bright-eyed. He\u2019s never this awake in the morning, so Cyrus eyes him suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here early,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cJust thought we\u2019d get a jump start on the celebrations.\u201d His tone is all too casual and that\u2019s what tips Cyrus off. The problem with knowing somebody better than you know yourself is that you can always tell when they\u2019re lying. There are no secrets.</p><p>\u201cThe celebrations,\u201d Cyrus echoes with a frown. He folds his arms. \u201cSo you\u2019re not here to say\u2026 I don\u2019t know, look at my soul mark, maybe?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a beat of tense silence as they stare at each other. Clearly sensing a storm coming, Cyrus\u2019 parents beat a hasty retreat from the room leaving the boys stuck in a staring contest as if daring one another to look away.

                "content": "<p><h2><a href=\"http://CAPTAINKIPPEN.TUMBLR.COM\">SEND ME FIC PROMPTS</a></h2><hr /><p>The night Cyrus turns fifteen he stays up until the early hours of the morning waiting for his soul mark to appear, wondering if he&rsquo;ll be able to feel it come in and what it will be like if he does. It&rsquo;s different for everybody; some feel their mark burning as the letters are inscribed into their skin by an invisible hand, others experience a sensation akin to soft lips pressing a gentle kiss upon them, but it&rsquo;s not unusual to feel nothing at all. He must fall asleep sometime around dawn, the mark still not having appeared. He would&rsquo;ve noticed if it had, he had been getting up every half an hour to check. When he wakes, groggy and confused, it&rsquo;s almost noon. It takes him a moment to remember why he&rsquo;s so tired, then suddenly he&rsquo;s wide awake once more and leaping out of bed to inspect himself in the mirror.</p><p>A soul mark can appear anywhere on a person&rsquo;s body. There are theories about the locations, a common belief is that they appear on the site of the first place your soulmate touched or will touch you. Cyrus isn&rsquo;t so sure about that one because he finally finds his mark he finds it sloping lopsidedly down his left hip, and the words there are instantly recognisable.</p><p><i><b>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t get your own muffin?&rsquo;</b></i></p><p>The first words TJ ever said to him. He can hear them clear as day in his mind, even the disbelieving tone rings through.</p><p>TJ. His soulmate is TJ. His first and most hysterical thought about this is that the touch theory is definitely wrong because TJ has touched Cyrus many times by now but never on his hip. They&rsquo;ve knocked hands at the movie theatre fighting for popcorn from the same bucket, the wrestle regularly when TJ&rsquo;s feeling especially playful, and more than once he&rsquo;s had TJ wipe an eyelash from his cheekbone using the pad of his thumb.</p><p>Cyrus doesn&rsquo;t know what else to do but call Buffy.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ?&rdquo; She repeats, voice coming out tinny and muffled through the receiver. &ldquo;<i>TJ </i>is your <i>soulmate</i>? Are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m one hundred percent certain,&rdquo; Cyrus confirmed. He had put the phone on speaker and was back in front of the mirror, the hem of his shirt lifted so he could run his fingers over the deep black lettering of the words. There&rsquo;s a couple of moments of silence, and then Buffy voices the thought that Cyrus has been most afraid to think about properly himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Then&hellip; he must <i>know</i>, Cy. He&rsquo;s older than you, his birthday was months ago. He&rsquo;ll already have his mark. Did he really never mention anything about it to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Cyrus says The awful truth is that he had spent the last few months leading up to this simultaneously wishing that TJ <i>would</i> turn out to be his soulmate, but also kind of hoping that he wouldn&rsquo;t be because if he hadn&rsquo;t said anything to Cyrus then maybe he didn&rsquo;t actually have Cyrus&rsquo; words for his mark, and if Cyrus found out he was destined to be with somebody else then surely he&rsquo;d be able to move on from the crush he had on him. If TJ has Cyrus&rsquo; words somewhere on him, then why hadn&rsquo;t he said anything? Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t want him.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to talk to him,&rdquo; Buffy says solemnly. &ldquo;There has to be a good reason he didn&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus knows she&rsquo;s right, she has to be, but he&rsquo;s also filled with a dreadful sense of terror that speaking to TJ about this might not end well. As it turns out, he doesn&rsquo;t have much of a chance to put off calling him because TJ arrives at the Goodmans&rsquo; house before Cyrus can even get downstairs to eat breakfast.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy birthday,&rdquo; TJ greets him, bright-eyed. He&rsquo;s never this awake in the morning, so Cyrus eyes him suspiciously.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here early,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;Just thought we&rsquo;d get a jump start on the celebrations.&rdquo; His tone is all too casual and that&rsquo;s what tips Cyrus off. The problem with knowing somebody better than you know yourself is that you can always tell when they&rsquo;re lying. There are no secrets.</p><p>&ldquo;The celebrations,&rdquo; Cyrus echoes with a frown. He folds his arms. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not here to say&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, look at my soul mark, maybe?&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a beat of tense silence as they stare at each other. Clearly sensing a storm coming, Cyrus&rsquo; parents beat a hasty retreat from the room leaving the boys stuck in a staring contest as if daring one another to look away. TJ breaks first, averting his eyes and ducking his head. Anger bubbles up inside Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;You knew!&rdquo; Cyrus explodes. &ldquo;You have my words too! You <i>knew</i> that I&rsquo;m your soulmate and you <i>didn&rsquo;t say anything!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>TJ half shrugs awkwardly. &ldquo;I could never find the right time to tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had months! We&rsquo;ve spent the majority of all those months together!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, when you put it like that it sounds bad!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is bad!&rdquo; Cyrus shoots back, then it&rsquo;s as if all the anger suddenly drains only to be replaced by fear. &ldquo;Do you&hellip; do you not want to be soulmates?
