I really hope that none of you have female bosses at work and that you\ndon\u2019t feel \u2018subservient\u2019 and like a servant because she\u2019s a woman. You may the\ntype to call her bitchy and bossy just because she gave you a job and she dared\nto be a woman. </p><p>I mean, Jon was under several leaders before - he was Jeor Mormont\u2019s\nsteward. Was Jon subservient to him? Was Jon subservient to Stannis? Was Ned\nsubservient to Robert? Is Sansa subservient to Jon? </p><p>It\u2019s like some people just cannot stand the fact that the most powerful character\non the show is a woman. \u00a0Their heads are exploding, unable to process this\ninformation. That\u2019s why Dany cannot just be a good, powerful ruler for them.\nThat\u2019s why they have to make her mad, evil, a tyrant - that\u2019s the only way Dany\nworks for them as a character.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>That\u2019s why when she is \nproud, commanding, and assertive \n\n, people see her as arrogant and entitled. Every character in Westeros is allowed to fight wars for their birthright - Robb, Sansa, Jon, Balon, Joffrey, Stannis, Renly - except for Dany. She\u2019s not allowed to - she\u2019s just supposed to accept her family\u2019s massacre, the loss of her home, the assassins send by Robert to murder her and silently go away. <br/></p><p>That\u2019s why the violence committed by the male characters is totally\njustified and ignored, but Dany\u2019s violence is picked apart under a microscope,\nscrutinized and used to label her bad. That\u2019s why every vile, cruel act is okay\nin Westeros because it\u2019s a medieval place with medieval rules but Dany\u2019s acts\nalone are analyzed through the lens of 21st century morals. </p><p>Because she is a female character with a story arc traditionally played by a\nman and their small minds are unable to accept this. OMG, how can Jon - a\nman!!!! - bend the knee to Dany!!!! None of this outrage when the series\nstarted with Ned and all the Starks bending the knee to Robert Baratheon of\ncourse. When Jon got the Umber and Karstark kids to bend the knee for him. When\nJon bend the knee for Stannis.</p><p>It is a fact that Dany is the most powerful leader in Westeros currently. By\nallying himself with her, Jon is getting the best help he can for the North and\nhis people. She\u2019s awesome for going North to help while halting her own\npersonal campaign. He\u2019s awesome for recognizing that she\u2019s great and allying\nwith her instead of fighting against her. And that\u2019s the story the show is\ntelling us.</p>",

Just because you guys\nwillfully ignore it because \u2013 OMG, how dare he not get permission from Queen\nSansa \u2013 does not mean it did not happen.

People who refuse to bend\nthe knee are executed as traitors all the time in Westeros \u2013 as Jon points out to Sansa with\nrespect to the Umbers and Karstarks. In fact Sansa was so incensed about the\nKarstarks and Umbers not choosing the Starks instead of the Boltons, that she even wanted their children punished and thrown out of their homes</p><p>5.\u00a0 Jon spend his time on Dragonstone mining the very vital\ndragonglass \u2013 for which Dany provided her men to help him \u2013 and getting to know\nDany from the people who followed her.

As is Davos.<br/></p><p>6.\u00a0 When Dany returns from the field of fire 2.0 they have\na very frank discussion on war and strength. As Dany rightfully points out to\nJon, thousands of men died in very brutal ways in the BOTB, because the Starks\nwanted Winterfell back from the Boltons. Sometimes strength is terrible \u2013 but\nto be a leader in Westeros, it\u2019s necessary. As GRRM himself has pointed out,\nit\u2019s not just enough to be a good person to be ruler on the Iron Throne \u2013 one\nneeds the strength to get it and hold onto it. </p><p>7.\u00a0 Against advice, Dany risks her dragons to rescue\nJon, Jorah and the others and then promises Jon \u2013 without him giving her\nanything in return \u2013 that she would help him and the North fight the WW. This\nfinally makes it clear to Jon, that Dany is a good and righteous queen - a ruler\nwho can put aside her life\u2019s mission to defend the realm from an existential\nthreat. As GRRM points out with Stannis:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnd it is important that the individual books\nrefer to the civil wars, but the series title reminds us constantly that the\nreal issue lies in the North beyond the Wall. <b>Stannis becomes one of the few characters fully to understand that,\nwhich is why in spite of everything he is a righteous man,</b> and not just a\nversion of Henry VII, Tiberius or Louis XI.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>That Dany immediately does this, as soon as she sees the threat with her own eyes, puts her on par with Jon as a leader who understands what the real issue is. <br/></p><p>8.\u00a0 Jon recognizes this in Dany and bends the knee. That\u2019s\nit. He thinks that Dany would \u00a0be a good\nQueen of the 7K. He is not obsessed about Northern independence (I will discuss\nthis in another post) unlike some rabid Stark fans. He wants only what\u2019s best\nfor the North \u2013 and in his opinion \u00a0Dany\nbeing a good queen would be good for the North. And it would only be fair that\nafter all the help that Dany is providing the North \u2013 without asking for\nanything in return \u2013 that Jon and the North in turn help her fight Cersei\nLannister. Cersei is not going to leave the Starks and the North alone. Why not join with Dany to\ndefeat Cersei? Rather than fight against Dany?</p><p>9.\u00a0 Jon\u2019s decision to bend the knee makes sense in every\nway possible \u2013 except for the folks obsessed with Northern independence. Like\nwhy? The North did just fine under the Targaryens for 300 years. They did fine\nunder Robert Baratheon for 15 years. Ned enforced Robert\u2019s rule over the 7k by\nhelping him crush rebellions and taking child hostages. Robb wanted independence because of what the Lannisters did to his family. <br/></p><p>10.\u00a0 It\u2019s\nclear that this obsession with Northern independence is only from a certain\nsection of fans that want their fave to become Queen in the North. Sorry guys,\nthat\u2019s not happening. </p><p>So there it is.

Just because you guys\nwillfully ignore it because \u2013 OMG, how dare he not get permission from Queen\nSansa \u2013 does not mean it did not happen.

People who refuse to bend\nthe knee are executed as traitors all the time in Westeros \u2013 as Jon points out to Sansa with\nrespect to the Umbers and Karstarks. In fact Sansa was so incensed about the\nKarstarks and Umbers not choosing the Starks instead of the Boltons, that she even wanted their children punished and thrown out of their homes</p><p>5.\u00a0 Jon spend his time on Dragonstone mining the very vital\ndragonglass \u2013 for which Dany provided her men to help him \u2013 and getting to know\nDany from the people who followed her.

As is Davos.<br></p><p>6.\u00a0 When Dany returns from the field of fire 2.0 they have\na very frank discussion on war and strength. As Dany rightfully points out to\nJon, thousands of men died in very brutal ways in the BOTB, because the Starks\nwanted Winterfell back from the Boltons. Sometimes strength is terrible \u2013 but\nto be a leader in Westeros, it\u2019s necessary.

This\nfinally makes it clear to Jon, that Dany is a good and righteous queen - a ruler\nwho can put aside her life\u2019s mission to defend the realm from an existential\nthreat. As GRRM points out with Stannis:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnd it is important that the individual books\nrefer to the civil wars, but the series title reminds us constantly that the\nreal issue lies in the North beyond the Wall. <b>Stannis becomes one of the few characters fully to understand that,\nwhich is why in spite of everything he is a righteous man,</b> and not just a\nversion of Henry VII, Tiberius or Louis XI.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>That Dany immediately does this, as soon as she sees the threat with her own eyes, puts her on par with Jon as a leader who understands what the real issue is. <br></p><p>8.\u00a0 Jon recognizes this in Dany and bends the knee. That\u2019s\nit. He thinks that Dany would \u00a0be a good\nQueen of the 7K. He is not obsessed about Northern independence (I will discuss\nthis in another post) unlike some rabid Stark fans. He wants only what\u2019s best\nfor the North \u2013 and in his opinion \u00a0Dany\nbeing a good queen would be good for the North. And it would only be fair that\nafter all the help that Dany is providing the North \u2013 without asking for\nanything in return \u2013 that Jon and the North in turn help her fight Cersei\nLannister. Cersei is not going to leave the Starks and the North alone. Why not join with Dany to\ndefeat Cersei? Rather than fight against Dany?</p><p>9.\u00a0 Jon\u2019s decision to bend the knee makes sense in every\nway possible \u2013 except for the folks obsessed with Northern independence. Like\nwhy? The North did just fine under the Targaryens for 300 years. They did fine\nunder Robert Baratheon for 15 years. Ned enforced Robert\u2019s rule over the 7k by\nhelping him crush rebellions and taking child hostages. Robb wanted independence because of what the Lannisters did to his family. <br></p><p>10.\u00a0 It\u2019s\nclear that this obsession with Northern independence is only from a certain\nsection of fans that want their fave to become Queen in the North. Sorry guys,\nthat\u2019s not happening. </p><p>So there it is. Jon thinks Dany is a good queen who is giving her all to\nprotect the North and he thinks it\u2019s better to fight with her than against her\nand therefore he bends the knee. The end. </p>",
