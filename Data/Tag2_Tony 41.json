She rubbed her eyes, immediately heard her stomach growl and was soon on the hunt for some food. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t long before she was out of her bed having wandered around the house, hoping her parents were already up. Having searched every room in the house, she headed to her parents&rsquo; room, finding them both asleep. She headed back to the kitchen.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Tony woke up to the clatter of metal from a distance. He quietly looked over at his wife, who was still sleeping softly, gave her quick kiss on the forehead and whispered, \u201cI love you\u201d before getting out of bed, and closed the door to the bedroom allowing her to sleep a bit longer. Tony walked towards the sound, which he soon realized was coming from the kitchen. He entered, finding his daughter surrounded by cooking pans and multiple ingredients sitting on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>Tony looked down at his daughter, and with a humorous whisper said, \u201cMorgan H. Stark, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>Morgan just laughed happily and said, \u201cI was hungry, and you and mom were asleep.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, hungry were we? And what were you planning to make?\u201d he asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWaffles.\u201d was all Morgan said.</p><p>Tony laughed and smiled at his daughter, \u201cOkay, waffles it is, my dear. But I\u2019m going to make you eat some fruit too, or your mom might hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Morgan sighed, \u201cbut no strawberries, they make mommy sick\u201d. Tony grinned at his daughter, amazed that she was able to remember almost every little detail she had ever been told. She was going to be smarter than him one day if he wasn\u2019t careful.</p><p>Pepper awoke to the familiar smell of breakfast being cooked, and seeing that Tony was gone had a knowing feeling that he was certainly the reason, she just hoped he hadn\u2019t made too big a mess. She promptly threw her hair up into a ponytail before walking to the kitchen to find her suspicions confirmed, her husband and her daughter were covered in flour, laughing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d she asked, looking at the mess. She glanced at Tony with inquiring eyes, who was less than concerned about the mess since he would not be the one cleaning it up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s um, breakfast\u2026 For you of course,\u201d he said before giving her a sly grin she couldn\u2019t say no to.\u00a0</p><p>Pepper gave him a quick kiss on the cheek before picking up Morgan in her arms. \u201cI wanted some waffles and daddy said he\u2019d help me,\u201d Morgan said enthusiastically before her mother gave her kiss on her forehead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sure he did. You know waffles are one of your dad\u2019s favorites. I think it\u2019s because he can get away with eating an ungodly amount of sugar so early in the day.\u201d Pepper told her daughter slightly glaring at Tony but with nothing but love in her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Pep, we\u2019ve got some fruit too. So it\u2019s healthy,\u201d said Tony cheekily, before giving Pepper a quick wink. She only smiled and looked back at her daughter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut no strawberries, they make you feel bad\u201d Morgan said confidently beaming while Pepper grinned at her.\u00a0</p><p>She looked to Tony, \u201csee honey, our child can remember,\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why you can\u2019t.\u201d before giving him a soft smile.\u00a0</p><p>Tony just shrugged and returned her smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>It was mid-afternoon and they were all settled in the same room. Tony tinkered on his new project, Morgan was working on her own project but was mostly watching her dad and Pepper was getting some work done on her computer. Pepper had put some soft jazz on the record player, not Tony\u2019s signature AC/DC playlist but as long as his family was happy, so was he.\u00a0</p><p>About an hour had passed and Morgan was no longer working on her own projects and had devoted her full attention to her dad, following him around as he worked. Even Pepper had now stopped her work, content with watching her daughters happiness in following her father around, helping him with anything and everything she could. A familiar song started playing from the record player, Tony stopped what he was doing and turned to Pepper on the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRemember this one, honey?\u201d giving her a loving look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I don\u2019t know how I could ever forget,\u201d Pepper said, laughing and smiling at the memory. <i>\u201cYou want to dance?\u201d \u201cOh, no.\u201d \u201cAll right, come on.\u201d \u201cNo, I \u2014\u201d</i> In that moment, years ago she could never have imagined that she would one day be raising a child with the man she had danced with on that night.\u00a0</p><p>Tony laughed at the memory too, remembering Pepper in that blue dress he had \u201cbought\u201d her,\u00a0 refusing to dance with him. <i>\u201cI actually don&rsquo;t think that you could tie your shoes without me.\u201d </i>Tony thought about the statement, she had been right about that, but not in the way she thought, knowing now how much she meant to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t want to dance with me,\u201d he joked with her before walking over to her, sitting on the couch beside her and giving her a kiss, \u201cI\u2019m glad you did though,\u201d he said, as his wife rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t be sure but it\u2019s probably part of the reason we have that crazy ball of energy running around the house 24/7.\u201d He pointed to Morgan who was sitting on the floor fiddling with a task Tony had given her to help him with his project. Pepper chuckled happily. They both glanced at their daughter, watching as she happily tinkered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMore and more like you every day,\u201d Pepper said rolling her eyes frivolously, before Tony responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you manage us Pep, we&rsquo;re hard work.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes you are, and neither do I, but it\u2019s worth it,\u201d she said sincerely, looking up to smile at Tony.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMorgan H. Stark\u201d, Tony shouted lightly, earning the attention of the young girl sitting in front of them. \u201cCome here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Morgan walked over to her parents, Tony speaking again before she reached them. \u201cYou know your mom and I danced to this song a long time ago, even though she didn\u2019t want too.\u201d Tony winked at Pepper who just smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMommy, that\u2019s mean, why wouldn\u2019t you want to dance with daddy. He\u2019s the best dancer ever.\u201d Morgan delighted.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh is he now?\u201d was all Pepper said grinning at her daughter then looked to her husband who was flushed with pride.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what Morguna, you just earned yourself a dance,\u201d Tony said as he stood up from the couch and picked his daughter up in his arms, swaying back and forth before putting her back on her feet, \u201cOkay kiddo, I want to teach you something, you think you\u2019re up for learning something from your dear old dad.\u201d Morgan only nodded and smiled, happiness in her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, now, I want you to step on my shoes,\u201d Morgan looked up at her dad, confused. Tony glanced down at her, \u201cit\u2019s alright, I promise.\u201d She did as she was told, Tony faked a wince when she did, smiling down at her \u201cwow, when did you get so big,\u201d he joked before placing a kiss on the top of her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood, now hold my hands real tight, so you don\u2019t fall\u201d, Morgan grinned while Tony leaned down and whispered, \u201cnot that I would ever let that happen.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony took small steps in every direction while the light jazz music played in the background, gazing in amazement at the little girl. He would somehow never understand how he got so lucky. He glanced at Pepper who was still sitting on the couch, who was with all her strength trying not to tear up, but failing miserably.\u00a0</p><p>After a few more moments, his daughter looked up at him, \u201ccan mommy dance with us too?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony looked down at his daughter, \u201cof course she can,\u201d he said before looking over at his wife as he pulled his daughter up into his arms once more. <br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you say, mom, you want to dance with us?\u201d he asked, knowing by his wife\u2019s eyes what she would say. Pepper smiled at her husband and stood up, walking over to the two people who mattered most to her. She grabbed Tony\u2019s free hand he offered to her, Morgan laid her head against her dad\u2019s chest and Pepper leaned into Tony, resting her forehead on his.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind dancing with me now, do you?\u201d he said looking into to her eyes with all the love in the world. She replied by giving him a kiss and returning his loving look. Admiring each other, they both remembered that dance in the blue dress, thinking how every moment including that one led to the one they were having now.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The day was almost over but Morgan was as wired as ever. Running around the house at full force while Tony and Pepper sat on the couch, worn out from their daughter wanting to play with them, every minute of the day, not that they minded. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMorgan, please be careful, I don\u2019t want to be taking a trip to the hospital anytime soon,\u201d Pepper warned her daughter as Tony began to speak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think we need to end this day?\u201d Tony called out to Morgan.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJuice pops,\u201d Morgan replied with excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCorrect you are ma\u2019am, are you sure you\u2019re my daughter, you\u2019re a bit too smart for me,\u201d he teased Morgan before looking over at Pepper smiling, knowing that his wife would not be pleased that he was going to give their already energized daughter a juice pop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReally Tony, you\u2019re going to give her sugar, at this hour?\u201d Pepper smiled at him absurdly, knowing anything she said wouldn\u2019t change his mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re worried, honey. I got sugar-free this time, they were really hard to find, and if they\u2019re not as good, I\u2019m blaming you\u201d he laughed before leaning down to give a kiss. Pepper just rolled her eyes faintly, amused that he had gone through the trouble to make sure he had bought the sugar-free variety, so she couldn\u2019t get mad at him.\u00a0</p><p>Regardless of the late hour, they all had a juice pop or two. Tony had about three.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, Morguna, time for bed, let\u2019s go,\u201d Tony told his daughter, Pepper calling out after her \u201cand please don\u2019t forget to brush your teeth.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony grabbed two more juice pops from the box and handed one to his wife.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019ve had enough, the box is empty because of you,\u201d Pepper said to no avail taking the juice pop and opening it anyway as her husband did the same.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault they\u2019re so good. Hey, maybe Stark Industries should go into the juice pop business, I know they\u2019d have at least one customer who\u2019d be happy about it,\u201d he said, tilting his head towards the hallway their daughter has just disappeared into.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf only there was someone I knew who had some pull at the company,\u201d Pepper joked, giving him a kiss, taking the finished juice pop stick from his and throwing away all the trash.\u00a0</p><p>She returned from the other side of the kitchen, wrapping her arms around her husband from behind and resting her chin on his broad shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI never did thank you for the waffles this morning,\u201d Pepper stated, turning her head to kiss his cheek. \u201cTurns out our daughter is pretty good at making waffles.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony smiled, agreeing with his wife, \u201cthat girl can do it all, one day she is going to rule us all, I\u2019m not sure how we got so lucky.\u201d Tony said turning to face Pepper, giving her a simple kiss before she replied.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s half of you and half of me\u201d was all Pepper said, smiling at her husband, leaning into him rest her forehead on his, still unsure how they got so lucky to find each other.</p><p>\u201cThink we should go check on that girl of ours, make sure she\u2019s actually in bed, she is half mine, as you said,\u201d Tony smiled at his wife as she nodded in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>Morgan was fast asleep in her bed, as her parents stood outside her door looking at the perfect little girl they had created. They both stood outside their daughter&rsquo;s door for a few minutes more holding on to each other at the waist acknowledging that through their many years together, they had somehow ended up here, outside their daughter&rsquo;s door, holding each other with more love than they both imagined was humanly possible.\u00a0</p>",

He quietly looked over at his wife, who was still sleeping softly, gave her quick kiss on the forehead and whispered, \u201cI love you\u201d before getting out of bed, and closed the door to the bedroom allowing her to sleep a bit longer.

Tony grinned at his daughter, amazed that she was able to remember almost every little detail she had ever been told. She was going to be smarter than him one day if he wasn\u2019t careful.</p><p>Pepper awoke to the familiar smell of breakfast being cooked, and seeing that Tony was gone had a knowing feeling that he was certainly the reason, she just hoped he hadn\u2019t made too big a mess. She promptly threw her hair up into a ponytail before walking to the kitchen to find her suspicions confirmed, her husband and her daughter were covered in flour, laughing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d she asked, looking at the mess. She glanced at Tony with inquiring eyes, who was less than concerned about the mess since he would not be the one cleaning it up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s um, breakfast\u2026 For you of course,\u201d he said before giving her a sly grin she couldn\u2019t say no to.\u00a0</p><p>Pepper gave him a quick kiss on the cheek before picking up Morgan in her arms. \u201cI wanted some waffles and daddy said he\u2019d help me,\u201d Morgan said enthusiastically before her mother gave her kiss on her forehead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he did. You know waffles are one of your dad\u2019s favorites. I think it\u2019s because he can get away with eating an ungodly amount of sugar so early in the day.\u201d Pepper told her daughter slightly glaring at Tony but with nothing but love in her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Pep, we\u2019ve got some fruit too. So it\u2019s healthy,\u201d said Tony cheekily, before giving Pepper a quick wink. She only smiled and looked back at her daughter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut no strawberries, they make you feel bad\u201d Morgan said confidently beaming while Pepper grinned at her.\u00a0</p><p>She looked to Tony, \u201csee honey, our child can remember,\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why you can\u2019t.\u201d before giving him a soft smile.\u00a0</p><p>Tony just shrugged and returned her smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>It was mid-afternoon and they were all settled in the same room. Tony tinkered on his new project, Morgan was working on her own project but was mostly watching her dad and Pepper was getting some work done on her computer. Pepper had put some soft jazz on the record player, not Tony\u2019s signature AC/DC playlist but as long as his family was happy, so was he.\u00a0</p><p>About an hour had passed and Morgan was no longer working on her own projects and had devoted her full attention to her dad, following him around as he worked. Even Pepper had now stopped her work, content with watching her daughters happiness in following her father around, helping him with anything and everything she could. A familiar song started playing from the record player, Tony stopped what he was doing and turned to Pepper on the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRemember this one, honey?\u201d giving her a loving look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I don\u2019t know how I could ever forget,\u201d Pepper said, laughing and smiling at the memory. <i>\u201cYou want to dance?\u201d \u201cOh, no.\u201d \u201cAll right, come on.\u201d \u201cNo, I \u2014\u201d</i> In that moment, years ago she could never have imagined that she would one day be raising a child with the man she had danced with on that night.\u00a0</p><p>Tony laughed at the memory too, remembering Pepper in that blue dress he had \u201cbought\u201d her,\u00a0 refusing to dance with him. <i>\u201cI actually don\u2019t think that you could tie your shoes without me.\u201d </i>Tony thought about the statement, she had been right about that, but not in the way she thought, knowing now how much she meant to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t want to dance with me,\u201d he joked with her before walking over to her, sitting on the couch beside her and giving her a kiss, \u201cI\u2019m glad you did though,\u201d he said, as his wife rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t be sure but it\u2019s probably part of the reason we have that crazy ball of energy running around the house 24/7.\u201d He pointed to Morgan who was sitting on the floor fiddling with a task Tony had given her to help him with his project. Pepper chuckled happily. They both glanced at their daughter, watching as she happily tinkered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMore and more like you every day,\u201d Pepper said rolling her eyes frivolously, before Tony responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you manage us Pep, we\u2019re hard work.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes you are, and neither do I, but it\u2019s worth it,\u201d she said sincerely, looking up to smile at Tony.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMorgan H. Stark\u201d, Tony shouted lightly, earning the attention of the young girl sitting in front of them. \u201cCome here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Morgan walked over to her parents, Tony speaking again before she reached them. \u201cYou know your mom and I danced to this song a long time ago, even though she didn\u2019t want too.\u201d Tony winked at Pepper who just smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMommy, that\u2019s mean, why wouldn\u2019t you want to dance with daddy. He\u2019s the best dancer ever.\u201d Morgan delighted.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh is he now?\u201d was all Pepper said grinning at her daughter then looked to her husband who was flushed with pride.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what Morguna, you just earned yourself a dance,\u201d Tony said as he stood up from the couch and picked his daughter up in his arms, swaying back and forth before putting her back on her feet, \u201cOkay kiddo, I want to teach you something, you think you\u2019re up for learning something from your dear old dad.\u201d Morgan only nodded and smiled, happiness in her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, now, I want you to step on my shoes,\u201d Morgan looked up at her dad, confused. Tony glanced down at her, \u201cit\u2019s alright, I promise.\u201d She did as she was told, Tony faked a wince when she did, smiling down at her \u201cwow, when did you get so big,\u201d he joked before placing a kiss on the top of her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood, now hold my hands real tight, so you don\u2019t fall\u201d, Morgan grinned while Tony leaned down and whispered, \u201cnot that I would ever let that happen.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony took small steps in every direction while the light jazz music played in the background, gazing in amazement at the little girl. He would somehow never understand how he got so lucky. He glanced at Pepper who was still sitting on the couch, who was with all her strength trying not to tear up, but failing miserably.\u00a0</p><p>After a few more moments, his daughter looked up at him, \u201ccan mommy dance with us too?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony looked down at his daughter, \u201cof course she can,\u201d he said before looking over at his wife as he pulled his daughter up into his arms once more. <br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you say, mom, you want to dance with us?\u201d he asked, knowing by his wife\u2019s eyes what she would say. Pepper smiled at her husband and stood up, walking over to the two people who mattered most to her. She grabbed Tony\u2019s free hand he offered to her, Morgan laid her head against her dad\u2019s chest and Pepper leaned into Tony, resting her forehead on his.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind dancing with me now, do you?\u201d he said looking into to her eyes with all the love in the world. She replied by giving him a kiss and returning his loving look. Admiring each other, they both remembered that dance in the blue dress, thinking how every moment including that one led to the one they were having now.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The day was almost over but Morgan was as wired as ever. Running around the house at full force while Tony and Pepper sat on the couch, worn out from their daughter wanting to play with them, every minute of the day, not that they minded. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMorgan, please be careful, I don\u2019t want to be taking a trip to the hospital anytime soon,\u201d Pepper warned her daughter as Tony began to speak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think we need to end this day?\u201d Tony called out to Morgan.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJuice pops,\u201d Morgan replied with excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCorrect you are ma\u2019am, are you sure you\u2019re my daughter, you\u2019re a bit too smart for me,\u201d he teased Morgan before looking over at Pepper smiling, knowing that his wife would not be pleased that he was going to give their already energized daughter a juice pop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReally Tony, you\u2019re going to give her sugar, at this hour?\u201d Pepper smiled at him absurdly, knowing anything she said wouldn\u2019t change his mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re worried, honey. I got sugar-free this time, they were really hard to find, and if they\u2019re not as good, I\u2019m blaming you\u201d he laughed before leaning down to give a kiss. Pepper just rolled her eyes faintly, amused that he had gone through the trouble to make sure he had bought the sugar-free variety, so she couldn\u2019t get mad at him.\u00a0</p><p>Regardless of the late hour, they all had a juice pop or two. Tony had about three.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, Morguna, time for bed, let\u2019s go,\u201d Tony told his daughter, Pepper calling out after her \u201cand please don\u2019t forget to brush your teeth.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony grabbed two more juice pops from the box and handed one to his wife.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019ve had enough, the box is empty because of you,\u201d Pepper said to no avail taking the juice pop and opening it anyway as her husband did the same.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault they\u2019re so good. Hey, maybe Stark Industries should go into the juice pop business, I know they\u2019d have at least one customer who\u2019d be happy about it,\u201d he said, tilting his head towards the hallway their daughter has just disappeared into.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf only there was someone I knew who had some pull at the company,\u201d Pepper joked, giving him a kiss, taking the finished juice pop stick from his and throwing away all the trash.\u00a0</p><p>She returned from the other side of the kitchen, wrapping her arms around her husband from behind and resting her chin on his broad shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI never did thank you for the waffles this morning,\u201d Pepper stated, turning her head to kiss his cheek. \u201cTurns out our daughter is pretty good at making waffles.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony smiled, agreeing with his wife, \u201cthat girl can do it all, one day she is going to rule us all, I\u2019m not sure how we got so lucky.\u201d Tony said turning to face Pepper, giving her a simple kiss before she replied.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s half of you and half of me\u201d was all Pepper said, smiling at her husband, leaning into him rest her forehead on his, still unsure how they got so lucky to find each other.</p><p>\u201cThink we should go check on that girl of ours, make sure she\u2019s actually in bed, she is half mine, as you said,\u201d Tony smiled at his wife as she nodded in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>Morgan was fast asleep in her bed, as her parents stood outside her door looking at the perfect little girl they had created.

I think it\u2019s because he can get away with eating an ungodly amount of sugar so early in the day.\u201d Pepper told her daughter slightly glaring at Tony but with nothing but love in her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Pep, we\u2019ve got some fruit too. So it\u2019s healthy,\u201d said Tony cheekily, before giving Pepper a quick wink. She only smiled and looked back at her daughter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut no strawberries, they make you feel bad\u201d Morgan said confidently beaming while Pepper grinned at her.\u00a0</p><p>She looked to Tony, \u201csee honey, our child can remember,\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why you can\u2019t.\u201d before giving him a soft smile.\u00a0</p><p>Tony just shrugged and returned her smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>It was mid-afternoon and they were all settled in the same room. Tony tinkered on his new project, Morgan was working on her own project but was mostly watching her dad and Pepper was getting some work done on her computer. Pepper had put some soft jazz on the record player, not Tony\u2019s signature AC/DC playlist but as long as his family was happy, so was he.\u00a0</p><p>About an hour had passed and Morgan was no longer working on her own projects and had devoted her full attention to her dad, following him around as he worked. Even Pepper had now stopped her work, content with watching her daughters happiness in following her father around, helping him with anything and everything she could. A familiar song started playing from the record player, Tony stopped what he was doing and turned to Pepper on the couch.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRemember this one, honey?\u201d giving her a loving look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I don\u2019t know how I could ever forget,\u201d Pepper said, laughing and smiling at the memory. <i>\u201cYou want to dance?\u201d \u201cOh, no.\u201d \u201cAll right, come on.\u201d \u201cNo, I \u2014\u201d</i> In that moment, years ago she could never have imagined that she would one day be raising a child with the man she had danced with on that night.\u00a0</p><p>Tony laughed at the memory too, remembering Pepper in that blue dress he had \u201cbought\u201d her,\u00a0 refusing to dance with him. <i>\u201cI actually don\u2019t think that you could tie your shoes without me.\u201d </i>Tony thought about the statement, she had been right about that, but not in the way she thought, knowing now how much she meant to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t want to dance with me,\u201d he joked with her before walking over to her, sitting on the couch beside her and giving her a kiss, \u201cI\u2019m glad you did though,\u201d he said, as his wife rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t be sure but it\u2019s probably part of the reason we have that crazy ball of energy running around the house 24/7.\u201d He pointed to Morgan who was sitting on the floor fiddling with a task Tony had given her to help him with his project. Pepper chuckled happily. They both glanced at their daughter, watching as she happily tinkered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMore and more like you every day,\u201d Pepper said rolling her eyes frivolously, before Tony responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you manage us Pep, we\u2019re hard work.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes you are, and neither do I, but it\u2019s worth it,\u201d she said sincerely, looking up to smile at Tony.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMorgan H. Stark\u201d, Tony shouted lightly, earning the attention of the young girl sitting in front of them. \u201cCome here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Morgan walked over to her parents, Tony speaking again before she reached them. \u201cYou know your mom and I danced to this song a long time ago, even though she didn\u2019t want too.\u201d Tony winked at Pepper who just smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMommy, that\u2019s mean, why wouldn\u2019t you want to dance with daddy. He\u2019s the best dancer ever.\u201d Morgan delighted.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh is he now?\u201d was all Pepper said grinning at her daughter then looked to her husband who was flushed with pride.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what Morguna, you just earned yourself a dance,\u201d Tony said as he stood up from the couch and picked his daughter up in his arms, swaying back and forth before putting her back on her feet, \u201cOkay kiddo, I want to teach you something, you think you\u2019re up for learning something from your dear old dad.\u201d Morgan only nodded and smiled, happiness in her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, now, I want you to step on my shoes,\u201d Morgan looked up at her dad, confused. Tony glanced down at her, \u201cit\u2019s alright, I promise.\u201d She did as she was told, Tony faked a wince when she did, smiling down at her \u201cwow, when did you get so big,\u201d he joked before placing a kiss on the top of her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood, now hold my hands real tight, so you don\u2019t fall\u201d, Morgan grinned while Tony leaned down and whispered, \u201cnot that I would ever let that happen.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony took small steps in every direction while the light jazz music played in the background, gazing in amazement at the little girl. He would somehow never understand how he got so lucky. He glanced at Pepper who was still sitting on the couch, who was with all her strength trying not to tear up, but failing miserably.\u00a0</p><p>After a few more moments, his daughter looked up at him, \u201ccan mommy dance with us too?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony looked down at his daughter, \u201cof course she can,\u201d he said before looking over at his wife as he pulled his daughter up into his arms once more. <br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you say, mom, you want to dance with us?\u201d he asked, knowing by his wife\u2019s eyes what she would say. Pepper smiled at her husband and stood up, walking over to the two people who mattered most to her. She grabbed Tony\u2019s free hand he offered to her, Morgan laid her head against her dad\u2019s chest and Pepper leaned into Tony, resting her forehead on his.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind dancing with me now, do you?\u201d he said looking into to her eyes with all the love in the world. She replied by giving him a kiss and returning his loving look. Admiring each other, they both remembered that dance in the blue dress, thinking how every moment including that one led to the one they were having now.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The day was almost over but Morgan was as wired as ever. Running around the house at full force while Tony and Pepper sat on the couch, worn out from their daughter wanting to play with them, every minute of the day, not that they minded. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMorgan, please be careful, I don\u2019t want to be taking a trip to the hospital anytime soon,\u201d Pepper warned her daughter as Tony began to speak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think we need to end this day?\u201d Tony called out to Morgan.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJuice pops,\u201d Morgan replied with excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCorrect you are ma\u2019am, are you sure you\u2019re my daughter, you\u2019re a bit too smart for me,\u201d he teased Morgan before looking over at Pepper smiling, knowing that his wife would not be pleased that he was going to give their already energized daughter a juice pop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReally Tony, you\u2019re going to give her sugar, at this hour?\u201d Pepper smiled at him absurdly, knowing anything she said wouldn\u2019t change his mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re worried, honey. I got sugar-free this time, they were really hard to find, and if they\u2019re not as good, I\u2019m blaming you\u201d he laughed before leaning down to give a kiss. Pepper just rolled her eyes faintly, amused that he had gone through the trouble to make sure he had bought the sugar-free variety, so she couldn\u2019t get mad at him.\u00a0</p><p>Regardless of the late hour, they all had a juice pop or two. Tony had about three.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, Morguna, time for bed, let\u2019s go,\u201d Tony told his daughter, Pepper calling out after her \u201cand please don\u2019t forget to brush your teeth.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony grabbed two more juice pops from the box and handed one to his wife.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019ve had enough, the box is empty because of you,\u201d Pepper said to no avail taking the juice pop and opening it anyway as her husband did the same.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault they\u2019re so good. Hey, maybe Stark Industries should go into the juice pop business, I know they\u2019d have at least one customer who\u2019d be happy about it,\u201d he said, tilting his head towards the hallway their daughter has just disappeared into.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf only there was someone I knew who had some pull at the company,\u201d Pepper joked, giving him a kiss, taking the finished juice pop stick from his and throwing away all the trash.\u00a0</p><p>She returned from the other side of the kitchen, wrapping her arms around her husband from behind and resting her chin on his broad shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI never did thank you for the waffles this morning,\u201d Pepper stated, turning her head to kiss his cheek. \u201cTurns out our daughter is pretty good at making waffles.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony smiled, agreeing with his wife, \u201cthat girl can do it all, one day she is going to rule us all, I\u2019m not sure how we got so lucky.\u201d Tony said turning to face Pepper, giving her a simple kiss before she replied.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s half of you and half of me\u201d was all Pepper said, smiling at her husband, leaning into him rest her forehead on his, still unsure how they got so lucky to find each other.</p><p>\u201cThink we should go check on that girl of ours, make sure she\u2019s actually in bed, she is half mine, as you said,\u201d Tony smiled at his wife as she nodded in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>Morgan was fast asleep in her bed, as her parents stood outside her door looking at the perfect little girl they had created. They both stood outside their daughter\u2019s door for a few minutes more holding on to each other at the waist acknowledging that through their many years together, they had somehow ended up here, outside their daughter\u2019s door, holding each other with more love than they both imagined was humanly possible.\u00a0</p>",

She rubbed her eyes, immediately heard her stomach growl and was soon on the hunt for some food. It&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t long before she was out of her bed having wandered around the house, hoping her parents were already up. Having searched every room in the house, she headed to her parents&rsquo; room, finding them both asleep. She headed back to the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony woke up to the clatter of metal from a distance. He quietly looked over at his wife, who was still sleeping softly, gave her quick kiss on the forehead and whispered, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; before getting out of bed, and closed the door to the bedroom allowing her to sleep a bit longer. Tony walked towards the sound, which he soon realized was coming from the kitchen. He entered, finding his daughter surrounded by cooking pans and multiple ingredients sitting on the floor.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony looked down at his daughter, and with a humorous whisper said, &ldquo;Morgan H. Stark, what do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</p><p>Morgan just laughed happily and said, &ldquo;I was hungry, and you and mom were asleep.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hungry were we? And what were you planning to make?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Waffles.&rdquo; was all Morgan said.</p><p>Tony laughed and smiled at his daughter, &ldquo;Okay, waffles it is, my dear. But I&rsquo;m going to make you eat some fruit too, or your mom might hurt me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Morgan sighed, &ldquo;but no strawberries, they make mommy sick&rdquo;. Tony grinned at his daughter, amazed that she was able to remember almost every little detail she had ever been told. She was going to be smarter than him one day if he wasn&rsquo;t careful.</p><p>Pepper awoke to the familiar smell of breakfast being cooked, and seeing that Tony was gone had a knowing feeling that he was certainly the reason, she just hoped he hadn&rsquo;t made too big a mess. She promptly threw her hair up into a ponytail before walking to the kitchen to find her suspicions confirmed, her husband and her daughter were covered in flour, laughing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; she asked, looking at the mess. She glanced at Tony with inquiring eyes, who was less than concerned about the mess since he would not be the one cleaning it up.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s um, breakfast&hellip; For you of course,&rdquo; he said before giving her a sly grin she couldn&rsquo;t say no to.&nbsp;</p><p>Pepper gave him a quick kiss on the cheek before picking up Morgan in her arms. &ldquo;I wanted some waffles and daddy said he&rsquo;d help me,&rdquo; Morgan said enthusiastically before her mother gave her kiss on her forehead.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he did. You know waffles are one of your dad&rsquo;s favorites. I think it&rsquo;s because he can get away with eating an ungodly amount of sugar so early in the day.&rdquo; Pepper told her daughter slightly glaring at Tony but with nothing but love in her eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Pep, we&rsquo;ve got some fruit too. So it&rsquo;s healthy,&rdquo; said Tony cheekily, before giving Pepper a quick wink. She only smiled and looked back at her daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But no strawberries, they make you feel bad&rdquo; Morgan said confidently beaming while Pepper grinned at her.&nbsp;</p><p>She looked to Tony, &ldquo;see honey, our child can remember,&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; before giving him a soft smile.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony just shrugged and returned her smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>It was mid-afternoon and they were all settled in the same room.

They\u2019d been like that for some time, Stephen\u2019s arms wrapped lovingly around a half asleep Tony. Said man sleepily reached up to ruffle Stephen\u2019s hair, stretching in the process. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me that\u2019s comfortable,\u201d Stephen said. </p><p>Tony shrugged, \u201cDon\u2019t care. Don\u2019t feel like moving.\u201d He yawned and then added, \u201cI wanna listen to your heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>Stephen was flooded with another rush of love for Tony in that moment. If he could make the drum in his heart beat louder for him, he would without hesitation. </p><p>Tony ever so gently wrapped his arms around Stephen and hugged him, his arm (which happened to be in a cast, but that didn\u2019t stop him from hugging) slightly bent (I mean, as much as one can bend their arm whilst in a cast) as to cradle his head softly. \u201cI love you,\u201d Tony whispered. </p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Stephen said, yawning. He didn\u2019t realize he was tired, but the sun was coming warmly from the windows and it felt nice. </p><p>They were silent for a moment, both drifting in and out of sleep, until Tony finally quipped, \u201cof course NOW my arm starts hurting, as soon as a peaceful moment comes along.\u201d </p><p>Stephen laughed quietly as Tony moved his arm and got into a slightly less painful cuddling position. </p><p>\u201cYou laugh, but I did just save the entire world. I protect reality too, you\u2019re not the only one,\u201d Tony said indignantly. He soon settled on his stomach, still laying on top of Stephen, with his head resting in between the taller man\u2019s heart and his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cComfier?\u201d Stephen asked, the mirth still present in his voice. </p><p>Tony nodded, \u201cYes, but if you put your arms around me it\u2019d be even nicer.\u201d</p><p>Stephen pulled Tony back into a hug and began to card a hand through his hair. Every now and then, he\u2019d lean forward to place fluttery kisses on his face. Tony smiled. For once, he seemed content and willing to sleep, and you know what?

I was preparing to give you a very stern \u2018be respectful of my CEO and longtime friend\u2019 talk, that\u2019s why I asked,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>Stephen laughed, \u201cMuch like the \u2018Stephen you may be the sorcerer supreme but the man you\u2019re dating is my best friend and brother and if you disrespect him magic won\u2019t do you any good\u2019 talk that Rhodey gave me.\u201d </p><p>Tony sat up a little, \u201cPrecisely.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay but on the topic of relationships, is winking at somebody during a battle an appropriate method of flirting?\u201d Carol asked. </p><p>Tony, who was now on his back and reclining against Stephen, looked up at the sorcerer humorously. </p><p>\u201cTony always makes fun of me for this, but yeah winking is good flirting but it depends on where you are.

He could sleep another time, gossiping and chatting and reminiscing with his husband and his new friend was his main priority at the moment. </p><p>\u201cOh, do you guys know Thor\u2019s friend, the one he apparently just named Queen of New Asgard?\u201d Carol asked, a slight blush coming over her cheeks. Somebody once told her that they\u2019d never seen the Captain blush, but thinking about Thor\u2019s friend always got that response from her. </p><p>\u201cThe one who was riding the white winged horse? I have no clue who she is but I saw her. I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d made her queen. Good for Thor, he needs some rest,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that funny?

I have no clue who she is but I saw her. I didn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;d made her queen. Good for Thor, he needs some rest,&rdquo; Tony said. </p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that funny? Someone who never sleeps talking about rest,&rdquo; Stephen teased, gently dropping a kiss on Tony&rsquo;s hair and laughing as Tony shushed him. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, her,&rdquo; Carol said, laughing at the couple&rsquo;s antics. &ldquo;She winked at me, and I talked to her after the battle about how I thought we&rsquo;d make a great team and she told me to go visit her in New Asgard and said something about being co-Queens of a place is good teamwork, so there&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds like a marriage proposal, you&rsquo;d better go follow up about that,&rdquo; Tony replied, &ldquo;Let us know how it goes.&rdquo; </p><p>He laid down again, his head in Stephen&rsquo;s lap. He&rsquo;d be interested in hearing about Carol&rsquo;s adventures in love, but what he really wanted was rest and relaxation with the one he loved. According to Stephen, he deserved it. For once, Tony agreed. </p>",
