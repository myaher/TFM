Hope you enjoy (:</p><p><b>Summary</b> - On the most nights that Tony can\u2019t sleep, he usually wanders down to his workshop to tinker and build something and nap there but after one particularly extraordinary dream, will he ever sleep the same again? </p><p><b>Word count</b> - 1.8k</p><p><b>Warnings</b> - Fluff, so much fluff, slight SMUT, baby-talk, feels</p><p><b>Song</b> - Only one by Kanye West<br/></p><p><b><a href=\"https://sgtevanstan.tumblr.com/post/177208484343/masterlist\">M A S T E R L I S T</a></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"234\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9fd1832bdaebd0832e0e4b1b3200455c/tumblr_pdq446Fe971upzux2_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"234\"/></figure><p><b><i>As I lay me down to sleep, </i></b></p><p><b><i>I hear her speak to me</i></b></p><p>In the silence of the night within the grand mansion, the sound of clattering metal pierced the silence like a needle and woke you up from your lonely slumber in the grand king sized bed. </p><p>The four am usuals, that\u2019s what you knew this to be. You knew Tony had some serious sleeping issues that he never entirely treated alongside his PTSD and knew the usual tinkering in the office-come-workshop was because of his brain going into overdrive. </p><p>To salvage what was left of Tony, you slid on your dressing gown and slippers and padded down the landing and stairway in record time whilst keeping Morgan - yours and Tony\u2019s daughter - sleeping soundly in the nursery. The sound of the clattering continued as you turned a corner and neared the doorway of his office, the worry that lurked in your stomach making you squirm as you put your four digit code in the lock. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d You called out timidly as soon as the door swung open. Your eyes bulged out at the mess that had been left around the modern office, metal scraps, bolts, hammers, screws and anything else mechanical were strewn around the room - the room genuinely looked like it had been hit by a tornado of some sorts. </p><!-- more --><p><b><i>Hello Tony, how you doing?</i></b></p><p><b><i>I think the storm\u2019s run out of rain</i></b></p><p><b><i>The clouds are moving</i></b></p><p>Central of the calamity of a room sat a sullen and exhausted looking Tony, his back slumped on the tiny wheeled stool and raced away from you. You called his name again and touched his shoulder lightly and tenderly, the contact making him shoot out of his chair and whip around to look at you with wet bloodshot eyes. </p><p>\u201cHoney what\u2019s wrong? What happened? Did you have a nightmare?\u201d Like always, the usual worries spilled out of your mouth making Tony sigh and sit back down in the little stool, his back nestled to your stomach for safety. </p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that..\u201d Tony mumbled and ran his hands through his stressed hair. </p><p><b><i>I know you\u2019re happy</i></b></p><p><b><i>Cause I can see it</i></b></p><p><b><i>So tell the voice inside your head to believe it</i></b></p><p>\u201cThen what happened Tony?\u201d You sighed into his neck as you hugged his relatively muscular shoulders, knowing the contact would do someone as touch starved as himself some good. </p><p>\u201cI saw her&hellip;\u201d Tony\u2019s voice trembled in a short breath. \u201cMy mom, I saw her in my dream.\u201d A slight panic was setting in when you thought about Tony talking to dead, as if he was going to join them soon. \u201cShe\u2014she spoke to me..\u201d A hiccup escaped his parched lips, tears slowly making a reappearance in his eyes; the pain of being reminded of loved ones shared but he both of you</p><p><b><i>I talked to god about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>He said he sent you an angel </i></b></p><p>Being the second cousin of the now-fugitive Captain America made you susceptible to these kind of dreams too, the belief that one day you two could reconnect seemingly impossible as soon as you let him and he rebuffed any of your attempts to get to know him - but the dreams still continued even if the reality of knowing your wider family was impossible. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she say honey?\u201d You cooed and began to massage the tense muscles of Tony\u2019s shoulders, his breathing picking up at the thought of confessing what his mother said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything if you don\u2019t want Tony, take your time.\u201d You sensed his uneasiness from the second it started and eased him soothingly. </p><p><b><i>Look at all he gave you<br/></i></b><b><i>You asked for one now you got two</i></b></p><p>\u201cShe said she spoke to god about me&hellip;\u201d Tony began to mumble in an astonished tone and rubbed his forehead tiresomely. \u201cShe spoke about you and Morgan too..\u201d At the mention of your name, your heart felt as if it had stopped being for a second or two.</p><p>\u201cAll good things I hope?\u201d You laughed nervously and slowed your massage on Tony\u2019s shoulders, to which they shook with his laugh. \u201cHey, I wanna know if I made a good impression or not.\u201d His laugh only continued to grow at your explanation and made you cower into the name of his neck in slight shame. </p><p>As strange as it seemed looking back, your knack of embarrassing yourself was one of things that drew him into you when you signed up to be his new assistant after Pepper had left three years ago. </p><p>Maybe it was the way you could break the ice easily and non-uncomfortably between you and Tony when you first met that made him like you even more, he had to give it to you back then - he was an absolute douche of a mess after proper had left him for good.</p><p>In Tony\u2019s eyes, you certainly didn\u2019t compare to Pepper in any shape or form and he reminded you of that front the get-go; your only release being Happy as he drove you home from the torturous tower in the cold wet winter nights.</p><p>Both your new boss and your newly discovered second cousin hated your existence already and you couldn\u2019t take it, so you snapped - more at Tony than Steve - and tearily swore you couldn\u2019t deal with the comparison game and constant coldness much more. </p><p>It was that moment Tony had never seen such a beautiful woman before, tears streaming down her cheeks or not, you were just stunning; wounded but stunning. And much to his reputation, he told you that exactly and made you laugh pathetically that he found your ugly cry was beautiful. </p><p>From that day on, the rest was history and you soon became his fianc\u00e9e after birthing him his first child a little over a year ago - a little after the Accords drama.  </p><p>\u201cAnd yes Y/N,\u201d Tony turned and nestled himself into your touch, his head finding comfort on your stomach. \u201cShe loves you both very much.\u201d You relaxed at the notion that Maria is happy with you taking purchase beside her precious son and carrying on the Stark family. </p><p><b><i>You know I never left you</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u2018Cause every road that leads to heaven is right beside you</i></b></p><p>\u201cY/N/N, have you ever thought of going back to work at the compound soon?\u201d Tony suddenly mumbled into your tummy and made you look at him with a perplexed expression. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t deny that the idea of being more of a stay at home mom-come-assistant was seeming increasingly more appealing the more Morgan grew and began to pick up speed with her crawling and tumbling about the place. </p><p>\u201cNot exactly with Morgan trying to climb everything, no.\u201d You sighed unbothered by the plan Tony wanted to present to you in a few seconds time. To your surprise you could feel a smile grow on your belly and made you pull away to look Tony in the eyes. \u201cWhat are you thinking mister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have another.\u201d Tony blurted out like a child who had held a very big secret in for the longest while, a heartwarming smile still etched on his face and made a confused one break out along your own face. </p><p><b><i>So I can say</i></b></p><p><b><i>Hello my only one </i></b></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have another baby.\u201d Like that, Tony stood up and stared down at your smaller frame longingly, the distance between your faces starting to grow shorter and shorter the more you stared at him. </p><p>\u201cReally? Like right now?\u201d He only nodded at your slightly embarrassed yelp once a hand snaked inside your dressing gown and up his AC/DC t-shirt that you wore to bed, his hand ghosting your panties for effect. </p><p><b><i>Just like the morning sun </i></b></p><p><b><i>You keep on rising \u2018till the sky knows your name</i></b></p><p>\u201cYeah, how about it?\u201d Tony purred and began to shuffle you back a few steps to the relatively clean counter behind you, his hand not leaving your panties as it played curiously close to the growing heat a little below. </p><p>\u201cWhat about the wedding though?\u201d You yelped again at the contact of the cold counter touching your slightly exposed behind you, the thought of being too pregnant to attend your own wedding scaring you a little as Tony lifted you to sit on the counter; your panties vanishing over his shoulder as soon as you sat down. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon Y/N, a little bump wouldn\u2019t kill nobody.\u201d Tony whined and slid a finger into you for effect. \u2018Might as well.\u2019 You thought with a shrug and captured Tony\u2019s lips passionately with your own, your answer dancing on his lips like a prayer. </p><p><b><i>Hello my only one</i></b></p><p><b><i>Remember who you are</i></b></p><p>Regardless to the fact that the two of you had been fucking for two hours straight, you realised as you lay on the office sofa in Tony\u2019s arms that you weren\u2019t tired at all and that Tony\u2019s mom was as proud of him as you were of him. </p><p>From battling aliens, robots and his own teammates selflessly to being the greatest parent and mentor you knew he\u2019d be to Morgan and the Spiderboy, Peter Parker, you onto prayed to god that his selfish cock of a father could see what Tony had done with his life other than build and kill people with his father\u2019s stupid weapons.  </p><p>\u201cHey Tony?\u201d You mumbled into the speckles of black hair that decorated his chest like a reversal of a starry midnight sky. Wordlessly, he into hummed back in return and continued to draw patterns of your bare back. </p><p>\u201cDid your mom say anything about being proud of you at all?\u201d You lifted your head to look at the sleepy love of your life with question and watched him peel one eyelid open to look at you, the look of concern similar to the one that was etched in his mind from all those years ago when you first found out he was Iron Man. </p><p><b><i>No you\u2019re not prefect </i></b></p><p><b><i>But you\u2019re not your mistakes </i></b></p><p>\u201cShe did actually, yeah.\u201d Tony thought back to the once terrifying dream he had with his mother and thought back to the smile she wore on her face; that ever proud smile that nobody could wipe off of her face as she looked at her \u2018little\u2019 boy. </p><p>\u201cShe may not have said it but when she looked at me, god did she look proud.\u201d You smiled at the comfort that Tony finally got the recognitions deserved for his selflessness.  </p><p>\u201cThank god for that.\u201d You sighed and snuggled back into the warm hold of Tony\u2019s arms in the invited silence and light of the undisturbed early morning, the both of you knowing that in under an hour you\u2019d have to be up to see to your precious little girl - but for now, you laid and enjoyed the silence with the wish that Tony would get the love and happiness he deserved soon enough.  </p><h2>A/N : I know it\u2019s a little different to the usual Chris Evans/ Steeb Rogers stuff but I still hope everyone enjoyed it!! If you can, again please leave feedback and tell me if it was good or nah (:</h2>",

What happened? Did you have a nightmare?\u201d Like always, the usual worries spilled out of your mouth making Tony sigh and sit back down in the little stool, his back nestled to your stomach for safety. </p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that..\u201d Tony mumbled and ran his hands through his stressed hair. </p><p><b><i>I know you\u2019re happy</i></b></p><p><b><i>Cause I can see it</i></b></p><p><b><i>So tell the voice inside your head to believe it</i></b></p><p>\u201cThen what happened Tony?\u201d You sighed into his neck as you hugged his relatively muscular shoulders, knowing the contact would do someone as touch starved as himself some good. </p><p>\u201cI saw her\u2026\u201d Tony\u2019s voice trembled in a short breath. \u201cMy mom, I saw her in my dream.\u201d A slight panic was setting in when you thought about Tony talking to dead, as if he was going to join them soon. \u201cShe\u2014she spoke to me..\u201d A hiccup escaped his parched lips, tears slowly making a reappearance in his eyes; the pain of being reminded of loved ones shared but he both of you</p><p><b><i>I talked to god about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>He said he sent you an angel </i></b></p><p>Being the second cousin of the now-fugitive Captain America made you susceptible to these kind of dreams too, the belief that one day you two could reconnect seemingly impossible as soon as you let him and he rebuffed any of your attempts to get to know him - but the dreams still continued even if the reality of knowing your wider family was impossible. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she say honey?\u201d You cooed and began to massage the tense muscles of Tony\u2019s shoulders, his breathing picking up at the thought of confessing what his mother said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything if you don\u2019t want Tony, take your time.\u201d You sensed his uneasiness from the second it started and eased him soothingly. </p><p><b><i>Look at all he gave you<br></i></b><b><i>You asked for one now you got two</i></b></p><p>\u201cShe said she spoke to god about me\u2026\u201d Tony began to mumble in an astonished tone and rubbed his forehead tiresomely. \u201cShe spoke about you and Morgan too..\u201d At the mention of your name, your heart felt as if it had stopped being for a second or two.</p><p>\u201cAll good things I hope?\u201d You laughed nervously and slowed your massage on Tony\u2019s shoulders, to which they shook with his laugh. \u201cHey, I wanna know if I made a good impression or not.\u201d His laugh only continued to grow at your explanation and made you cower into the name of his neck in slight shame. </p><p>As strange as it seemed looking back, your knack of embarrassing yourself was one of things that drew him into you when you signed up to be his new assistant after Pepper had left three years ago. </p><p>Maybe it was the way you could break the ice easily and non-uncomfortably between you and Tony when you first met that made him like you even more, he had to give it to you back then - he was an absolute douche of a mess after proper had left him for good.</p><p>In Tony\u2019s eyes, you certainly didn\u2019t compare to Pepper in any shape or form and he reminded you of that front the get-go; your only release being Happy as he drove you home from the torturous tower in the cold wet winter nights.</p><p>Both your new boss and your newly discovered second cousin hated your existence already and you couldn\u2019t take it, so you snapped - more at Tony than Steve - and tearily swore you couldn\u2019t deal with the comparison game and constant coldness much more. </p><p>It was that moment Tony had never seen such a beautiful woman before, tears streaming down her cheeks or not, you were just stunning; wounded but stunning. And much to his reputation, he told you that exactly and made you laugh pathetically that he found your ugly cry was beautiful. </p><p>From that day on, the rest was history and you soon became his fianc\u00e9e after birthing him his first child a little over a year ago - a little after the Accords drama.  </p><p>\u201cAnd yes Y/N,\u201d Tony turned and nestled himself into your touch, his head finding comfort on your stomach. \u201cShe loves you both very much.\u201d You relaxed at the notion that Maria is happy with you taking purchase beside her precious son and carrying on the Stark family. </p><p><b><i>You know I never left you</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u2018Cause every road that leads to heaven is right beside you</i></b></p><p>\u201cY/N/N, have you ever thought of going back to work at the compound soon?\u201d Tony suddenly mumbled into your tummy and made you look at him with a perplexed expression. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t deny that the idea of being more of a stay at home mom-come-assistant was seeming increasingly more appealing the more Morgan grew and began to pick up speed with her crawling and tumbling about the place. </p><p>\u201cNot exactly with Morgan trying to climb everything, no.\u201d You sighed unbothered by the plan Tony wanted to present to you in a few seconds time. To your surprise you could feel a smile grow on your belly and made you pull away to look Tony in the eyes. \u201cWhat are you thinking mister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have another.\u201d Tony blurted out like a child who had held a very big secret in for the longest while, a heartwarming smile still etched on his face and made a confused one break out along your own face. </p><p><b><i>So I can say</i></b></p><p><b><i>Hello my only one </i></b></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have another baby.\u201d Like that, Tony stood up and stared down at your smaller frame longingly, the distance between your faces starting to grow shorter and shorter the more you stared at him. </p><p>\u201cReally? Like right now?\u201d He only nodded at your slightly embarrassed yelp once a hand snaked inside your dressing gown and up his AC/DC t-shirt that you wore to bed, his hand ghosting your panties for effect. </p><p><b><i>Just like the morning sun </i></b></p><p><b><i>You keep on rising \u2018till the sky knows your name</i></b></p><p>\u201cYeah, how about it?\u201d Tony purred and began to shuffle you back a few steps to the relatively clean counter behind you, his hand not leaving your panties as it played curiously close to the growing heat a little below. </p><p>\u201cWhat about the wedding though?\u201d You yelped again at the contact of the cold counter touching your slightly exposed behind you, the thought of being too pregnant to attend your own wedding scaring you a little as Tony lifted you to sit on the counter; your panties vanishing over his shoulder as soon as you sat down. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon Y/N, a little bump wouldn\u2019t kill nobody.\u201d Tony whined and slid a finger into you for effect. \u2018Might as well.\u2019 You thought with a shrug and captured Tony\u2019s lips passionately with your own, your answer dancing on his lips like a prayer. </p><p><b><i>Hello my only one</i></b></p><p><b><i>Remember who you are</i></b></p><p>Regardless to the fact that the two of you had been fucking for two hours straight, you realised as you lay on the office sofa in Tony\u2019s arms that you weren\u2019t tired at all and that Tony\u2019s mom was as proud of him as you were of him. </p><p>From battling aliens, robots and his own teammates selflessly to being the greatest parent and mentor you knew he\u2019d be to Morgan and the Spiderboy, Peter Parker, you onto prayed to god that his selfish cock of a father could see what Tony had done with his life other than build and kill people with his father\u2019s stupid weapons.  </p><p>\u201cHey Tony?\u201d You mumbled into the speckles of black hair that decorated his chest like a reversal of a starry midnight sky. Wordlessly, he into hummed back in return and continued to draw patterns of your bare back. </p><p>\u201cDid your mom say anything about being proud of you at all?\u201d You lifted your head to look at the sleepy love of your life with question and watched him peel one eyelid open to look at you, the look of concern similar to the one that was etched in his mind from all those years ago when you first found out he was Iron Man. </p><p><b><i>No you\u2019re not prefect </i></b></p><p><b><i>But you\u2019re not your mistakes </i></b></p><p>\u201cShe did actually, yeah.\u201d Tony thought back to the once terrifying dream he had with his mother and thought back to the smile she wore on her face; that ever proud smile that nobody could wipe off of her face as she looked at her \u2018little\u2019 boy. </p><p>\u201cShe may not have said it but when she looked at me, god did she look proud.\u201d You smiled at the comfort that Tony finally got the recognitions deserved for his selflessness.  </p><p>\u201cThank god for that.\u201d You sighed and snuggled back into the warm hold of Tony\u2019s arms in the invited silence and light of the undisturbed early morning, the both of you knowing that in under an hour you\u2019d have to be up to see to your precious little girl - but for now, you laid and enjoyed the silence with the wish that Tony would get the love and happiness he deserved soon enough.  </p><h2>A/N : I know it\u2019s a little different to the usual Chris Evans/ Steeb Rogers stuff but I still hope everyone enjoyed it!! If you can, again please leave feedback and tell me if it was good or nah (:</h2></p>",

Your eyes bulged out at the mess that had been left around the modern office, metal scraps, bolts, hammers, screws and anything else mechanical were strewn around the room - the room genuinely looked like it had been hit by a tornado of some sorts. </p><p><b><i>Hello Tony, how you doing?</i></b></p><p><b><i>I think the storm&rsquo;s run out of rain</i></b></p><p><b><i>The clouds are moving</i></b></p><p>Central of the calamity of a room sat a sullen and exhausted looking Tony, his back slumped on the tiny wheeled stool and raced away from you.

What happened? Did you have a nightmare?&rdquo; Like always, the usual worries spilled out of your mouth making Tony sigh and sit back down in the little stool, his back nestled to your stomach for safety. </p><p>&ldquo;No, nothing like that..&rdquo; Tony mumbled and ran his hands through his stressed hair. </p><p><b><i>I know you&rsquo;re happy</i></b></p><p><b><i>Cause I can see it</i></b></p><p><b><i>So tell the voice inside your head to believe it</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;Then what happened Tony?&rdquo; You sighed into his neck as you hugged his relatively muscular shoulders, knowing the contact would do someone as touch starved as himself some good. </p><p>&ldquo;I saw her&hellip;&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice trembled in a short breath. &ldquo;My mom, I saw her in my dream.&rdquo; A slight panic was setting in when you thought about Tony talking to dead, as if he was going to join them soon. &ldquo;She&mdash;she spoke to me..&rdquo; A hiccup escaped his parched lips, tears slowly making a reappearance in his eyes; the pain of being reminded of loved ones shared but he both of you</p><p><b><i>I talked to god about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>He said he sent you an angel </i></b></p><p>Being the second cousin of the now-fugitive Captain America made you susceptible to these kind of dreams too, the belief that one day you two could reconnect seemingly impossible as soon as you let him and he rebuffed any of your attempts to get to know him - but the dreams still continued even if the reality of knowing your wider family was impossible. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d she say honey?&rdquo; You cooed and began to massage the tense muscles of Tony&rsquo;s shoulders, his breathing picking up at the thought of confessing what his mother said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say anything if you don&rsquo;t want Tony, take your time.&rdquo; You sensed his uneasiness from the second it started and eased him soothingly. </p><p><b><i>Look at all he gave you<br /></i></b><b><i>You asked for one now you got two</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;She said she spoke to god about me&hellip;&rdquo; Tony began to mumble in an astonished tone and rubbed his forehead tiresomely. &ldquo;She spoke about you and Morgan too..&rdquo; At the mention of your name, your heart felt as if it had stopped being for a second or two.</p><p>&ldquo;All good things I hope?&rdquo; You laughed nervously and slowed your massage on Tony&rsquo;s shoulders, to which they shook with his laugh. &ldquo;Hey, I wanna know if I made a good impression or not.&rdquo; His laugh only continued to grow at your explanation and made you cower into the name of his neck in slight shame. </p><p>As strange as it seemed looking back, your knack of embarrassing yourself was one of things that drew him into you when you signed up to be his new assistant after Pepper had left three years ago. </p><p>Maybe it was the way you could break the ice easily and non-uncomfortably between you and Tony when you first met that made him like you even more, he had to give it to you back then - he was an absolute douche of a mess after proper had left him for good.</p><p>In Tony&rsquo;s eyes, you certainly didn&rsquo;t compare to Pepper in any shape or form and he reminded you of that front the get-go; your only release being Happy as he drove you home from the torturous tower in the cold wet winter nights.</p><p>Both your new boss and your newly discovered second cousin hated your existence already and you couldn&rsquo;t take it, so you snapped - more at Tony than Steve - and tearily swore you couldn&rsquo;t deal with the comparison game and constant coldness much more. </p><p>It was that moment Tony had never seen such a beautiful woman before, tears streaming down her cheeks or not, you were just stunning; wounded but stunning.

Prom is now 3 weeks away and they have nothing for it except what color they are going with. </p><p>They went with maroon since it&rsquo;s a shade of red like in Peter&rsquo;s suit. There&rsquo;s only one woman who can help Laura get the job done, May. Tony promised to pay for both of them and help Peter look like a man. May gladly agreed to help Laura.</p><p>Today was an early release day for spring break so Laura and May had time to go shopping before Laura had to hop on the bus. Peter tried to tag along but they went with tradition like weddings when the date doesn&rsquo;t see their date&rsquo;s outfit till prom night. </p><p>Yeah he pulled the pouty face but none of them fell for it. On the car ride there May decide to bring up a topic she knew Laura can&rsquo;t wiggle around. &ldquo;Hey Laura, I know this may be much but I really have to ask for yours and Peter&rsquo;s health, are you two having you know, sex?&rdquo;</p><p> Laura was stunned by the question but couldn&rsquo;t lie to the woman who she respects greatly. &ldquo;Um.

If you are please promise to keep using it.&rdquo; Laura nodded her head. &ldquo;Yeah of course.

This is the one.&rdquo;</p><p>All three of them were excited. Laura was for once extremely excited about dresses, makeup and just being girly. &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s jaw is going to drop when he sees you.&rdquo; May said placing her hands on Laura&rsquo;s shoulders and resting her chin on her hand.</p><p>She stared at the young girl in awe.

We get some really incredible character development for Tony and Pepper. Tony deals with severe anxiety/ptsd after New York. Pepper meanwhile saves the day, as usual. We also get to see how strong she is, emotionally <i>and</i> physically, and we get to see more of who she is, as herself, and as a powerful woman,  rather that just as Tony\u2019s PA or girlfriend.  I feel like this movie has so many great moments, it\u2019s sad to me that people can\u2019t seem to see them. </p></p>",
