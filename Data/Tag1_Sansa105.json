Mindlessly she was zapping from one channel to the other, but she wasn&rsquo;t really looking for something to watch. She was just looking for a way to waste her time, until midnight or way past that. </p><p>&ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo; Jon shook his head and leaned against the doorframe. &ldquo;The weather is nice. We could go outside today?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa already shook her head before he was finished. She wasn&rsquo;t interested in going outside, not when it rained and not when the sun shone. </p><p>&ldquo;Sansa&hellip;&rdquo; Jon walked towards her and he sat down on the edge of her seat. Gently he placed a hand on her back and for a moment he just sat there in absolute silence. </p><p>She already knew what he was going to say. </p><p>He would say the same thing he always said. </p><p>And she would answer the same thing too.</p><p>Jon licked his lips. &ldquo;Is this what you&rsquo;re gonna do the rest of your life? Waking up at three in the afternoon and sitting out your time while counting down the hours until two at night?&rdquo; </p><p>She waited for the but. For the because. For whatever came after that question. But nothing came apart from more silence. And more silence. And that much silence that even Sansa couldn&rsquo;t bear it anymore. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; She shrugged. &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; </p><p>Jon&rsquo;s grip on her tightened and he pulled her towards him, rocking her back and forth and back and forth. Eventually he pressed a soft kiss on her forehead. &ldquo;Do you mind if I go outside to enjoy the weather for a bit?&rdquo;</p><p>Once more Sansa shrugged. She didn&rsquo;t mind. She didn&rsquo;t not mind either. She didn&rsquo;t know how she felt. Not about Jon leaving her to have a walk outside on his own. And not about anything and everything else in her life. She felt everything and nothing at once. She wanted to cry, but then the tears never really seemed to come. She wanted to scream, but whenever she opened her mouth her anger always seemed to fade away. She wanted to throw with things, but that would require standing up and she didn&rsquo;t have the energy to do that.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back, I promise.&rdquo; Jon kissed her forehead once more and stood up.</p><p>A part of her wanted to call him back, wanted to yell that she needed him to hold her, that she wanted him to stay with her, that she regretted being like this and that she knew she was hard to love right now. But another part of her was whispering that he would leave eventually anyway. </p><p>Either he would leave, just like Arya and just like Bran. Or he would die, just like her father and her mother, just like Robb and just like Rickon.</p><p>So she didn&rsquo;t look up when he put his jacket on and walked out of the door. She just kept on switching channels, over and over again, on an endless loop until she had seen each and every program at least thirty times. Not that she was counting. It didn&rsquo;t matter. Nothing really mattered anymore.</p><p>She tightened her grip on her knees and took a few deep breaths. Sometimes she allowed herself to remember how it had been. How she had fought with her siblings, not realising how much she actually loved them. How she had yelled at her parents that she was old enough to look after herself, not realising that she would miss them so much when they were gone. How she had believed in princes and knights in shining armours, not realising that not all princes were charming and that not all knights were noble. She had been such a fool back then, and yet, she wishes she could still be that fool, without the hurt and the loss and the humiliation and the pain she carried around these days.</p><p>When the door of their small apartment opened again, she didn&rsquo;t look up. She was still going from channel to channel to channel. </p><p>&ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo; Jon sat down on the edge of her seat once more. He didn&rsquo;t bother to take off his jacket, but he didn&rsquo;t wrap his arm around her either. He simply placed countless small daisies in front of him on the table. His finger was trembling when he took the first one and attempted to make a small cut in the stalk, but failed hopelessly. He had his tongue stuck between his lips when he tried again and again and again. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not very good at it, are you?&rdquo; Sansa took a deep breath, but she reached for a daisy and put the remote control down. Even though she hadn&rsquo;t made flower crowns for years her fingers still knew exactly how to do it. Within a couple of minutes she had a circle of flowers. &ldquo;Here&hellip;&rdquo; She gave Jon the flower crown and grabbed the remote control again to continue what she had been doing.</p><p>&ldquo;Who taught you how to make one?&rdquo; Jon twirled the crown around and around. </p><p>&ldquo;Mom did.&rdquo; Sansa swallowed. &ldquo;She was always looking forward to spring.

I was wondering what you think of this alternative theory of mine: Shadrich will successfully abduct Sansa; in transporting her to King's Landing he avoids the Kingsroad and heads to Maidenpool to travel by boat; passes Saltpans where he and Sansa are noticed by Sandor Clegane who would surely recognize Sansa. I really want this to happen.",
        "answer": "<p>Logistically, I don\u2019t see this being at all feasible. Sansa is currently at the Gates of the Moon, which is, well, not near the Vale coast at all. In order for Shadrich to go, as you suggest, by boat to Maidenpool, he would presumably have to leave from Gulltown - which would mean crossing the width of the Vale, with no one stopping him (despite presumably everyone at the Winged Knight Tourney being aware that the affianced of the heir to the Vale and \u201cdaughter\u201d of the Lord Protector had been abducted), and then finding a ship in Gulltown and departing on it (again, without any of Littlefinger\u2019s many contacts in Gulltown raising any kind of alarm). Then they get to Maidenpool, and despite the fact that Shadrich is apparently trying to get to King\u2019s Landing, he turns north toward Saltpans (which is currently abandoned anyway), and then \u2026 what? Do they just stumble upon the Quiet Isle while Sandor is still there? Or has Sandor left and they just happen to meet him on the road? And then what? Sandor takes her away from Shadrich and \u2026 brings her north again? Cool, we just spent the entirety of Sansa\u2019s TWOW arc to go right back to where we were at the beginning of it.</p><p>I also don\u2019t see what the narrative gain would be. What\u2019s the point of having Sansa go south again (as a prisoner, no less), only for her eventually to go north again anyway (assuming you do believe that her end goal is Winterfell/the North)? How does this help resolve Sansa\u2019s story with Littlefinger, or indeed assist Sansa\u2019s characterization at all, other than potentially reuniting her with Sandor?
