This is a great question\u2026because imo I didn\u2019t really switch them around.</small></p><p><small>Thing about the Stark Sisters is that they are two sides of the same coin, irrefutably connected through their blood. Even as they act as each other\u2019s foils, their skills and personalities compliment one another. It\u2019s really beautiful.</small></p><p><small>When reviewing Ned\u2019s quote \u201c<i>You may be as different as </i><b><i>the sun and the moon</i></b><i>, but the same blood flows through both your hearts. You need her, as she needs you.</i>\u201d one can conclude, at least superficially, that Sansa is the sun and Arya is the moon: Sansa is bright, vivacious, and charming, she has the vibrant Tully colouring.

                "content": "<p>Unpopular opinion, but I&rsquo;m not sure that book!Arya fights in the Battle for the Dawn. She&rsquo;ll play a part, but i dont really see her as an active combatant in the battle. She does not have the fighting skills for that form of fighting. She can use Needle, but most of the time she has the key element of surprise. She has never had to go sword to sword before in actual fighting. The closest we get to it is Syrio and she talks more about chasing cats than actual fighting. We also get the scenes where Arya is the Blind Girl and is practicing with staffs, but she again has a secret weapon there. Its implied she can warg into cats (fun parallel there), allowing her to see her assailant and throw them off.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>The priest winced and snatched his hand back. &ldquo;And how could a blind girl know that?&rdquo; I saw you. &ldquo;I gave you three. I don&rsquo;t need to give you four.&rdquo; <b>Maybe on the morrow she would tell him about the cat that had followed her home last night from Pynto&rsquo;s, the cat that was hiding in the rafters, looking down on them. Or maybe not. If he could have secrets, so could she</b></i>.&rdquo; - The Blind Girl, ADwD<br /></p><p>A lot of the wins Arya gets is not based on skill, its based on strategy and surprise. She kills Raff the Sweetling because she distracts him. She kills the Stable Boy because he does not expect it. When she kills the insurance salesman he does not expect it and she uses a small blade. She manages to take down Dareon because, once again, she surprises him and slits his throat. Dareon spent so much time at pubs and brothels there is always the chance he was drunk as well. Arya&rsquo;s kills have less to do with a sword and more to do with being clever.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But, she-wolf, she is at the HoBaW! She&rsquo;s getting fighting skills!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Is she?&nbsp;</p><p>So far, not really. Or at least not the type that would work against White Walkers. She can use a small blade, she can get information, and she can use poison. None of that works in a battle. Could you even poison White Walkers? On top of that why would the HoBaW teach a trainee (she has not drank from the cup o&rsquo; doom yet) battle tactics? Battle does not seem the best way to assassinate a person.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure what role Arya will play. I&rsquo;m sure she will have one and it will play to her strengths but she has little to no training in actual battle style-combat.&nbsp;</p>",

So if you like that pairing it\u2019s great :)</p><p>I like little Ned Deyne, he seems a sweet child. But the only character I can ship him with (romantically or platonic) is Arya. He seemed quite taken with her when he met her back in<i> A Storm of Swords</i> and I found his crush pretty cute (and it\u00a0was funny to see Gendry\u2019s reaction to this because Gendya is my main ship xD).</p><p>I like your future scenario though, where Bran rules the North, Arya and Gendry are together and Sansa is happy and has lots of lemon cakes. And I believe she deserves to be shipped with a good guy around her age. But for me the said guy is Podrick. After all, the boy had a HUGE crush on Lady Sansa in the books and in the tv series his spending his time protecting her (alongside with Brienne). Their curcumstances of their meeting and their current position makes the premise for an interesting love story, don\u2019t you think? I know Podrick x Sansa is a small ship but deserves more love and recognition &lt;3</p><p>Anyway, all crack ships are valid and as long as we know that they probably won\u2019t happen we won\u2019t get disappointed one day. And meanwhile, we can always create our own headcanons where our favourite crack ships happen :)</p>",
