He was a nice boy but she didn\u2019t really have much conversation with him. Ned was the one who connected them and it was pretty weird for a young superhero. Peter had no idea, why you didn\u2019t want to stay alone with him or talk to him, when Ned wasn\u2019t around. So, he just gave up and decided not to bother you anymore. Nothing changed even when Y/N found out his secret, she didn\u2019t ask questions like Ned or show that she was worried or interested. It seemed fine for their relationship not counting the fact she was madly in love with Peter Parker. She wondered how he could be so smart, kind, strong and charming at the same time!  Y/N thought that he was too perfect for her but the problem was that he liked Liz and she couldn\u2019t do anything about that.</p><p>\u201cLook at them,\u201d Ned smiled. \u201cThey are so cute together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not.\u201d Y/N sighed rolling her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know, why he likes her so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd? I don\u2019t know, why you don\u2019t like him so much too. After all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;I never said that I don\u2019t like him.\u201d Ned paused before responding.</p><p>\u201cYes, you just behave like that.\u201d Y/N didn\u2019t know what to say because he was kinda right. All her actions screamed about it. </p><p>\u201cBut I still worry about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Like how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he tells her his secret? She\u2019s obsessed with Spider-man, and he wants to impress her and then \u2018Hello, Mr. Stark, this is my lovely girlfriend Liz, she wanted to meet you so much can you make her a suit too and bla-bla.\u2019 Oh, it\u2019s so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous or something? Why does it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but it still bothers you,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cOh, shit, I forgot to tell you, he asked us out to the cinema and he\u2019s bringing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What the hell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a problem?\u201d He asked innocently. </p><p>\u201cYou know the answer, Ned! I don\u2019t want to hang out with her!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, he does, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll do anything stupid, she\u2019s a nice girl, Y/N.\u201d The boy shrugged. </p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d </p><p>Y/N felt so uncomfortable watching them together, when Peter took Liz\u2019s hand and laughed at her jokes those things hurt her more than she expected. There was nothing wrong with Liz at all, she was kind, beautiful and intelligent and that made the situation even worse. As usual Y/N was the one who took photos when they hung out. It didn\u2019t mean she was a good photographer, it just meant she preferred taking pictures of other people rather than herself. </p><p>Now she finally was home alone and could relax after her long day. She sent all the photos and some videos on her computer but the thought of Liz and Peter didn\u2019t leave her head. Did it mean that she would always spend time with them? Was it a date? But then all her thoughts were interrupted by someone. </p><p>\u201cHey, Y/N\u201d Peter smiled shyly climbing through her window. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?

He was a nice boy but she didn\u2019t really have much conversation with him. Ned was the one who connected them and it was pretty weird for a young superhero. Peter had no idea, why you didn\u2019t want to stay alone with him or talk to him, when Ned wasn\u2019t around. So, he just gave up and decided not to bother you anymore. Nothing changed even when Y/N found out his secret, she didn\u2019t ask questions like Ned or show that she was worried or interested. It seemed fine for their relationship not counting the fact she was madly in love with Peter Parker. She wondered how he could be so smart, kind, strong and charming at the same time!

All her actions screamed about it. </p><p>\u201cBut I still worry about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Like how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he tells her his secret? She\u2019s obsessed with Spider-man, and he wants to impress her and then \u2018Hello, Mr. Stark, this is my lovely girlfriend Liz, she wanted to meet you so much can you make her a suit too and bla-bla.\u2019 Oh, it\u2019s so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous or something? Why does it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but it still bothers you,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cOh, shit, I forgot to tell you, he asked us out to the cinema and he\u2019s bringing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What the hell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a problem?\u201d He asked innocently. </p><p>\u201cYou know the answer, Ned!

No!&rdquo; She started to panic. He shouldn&rsquo;t see it, but it was to late.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! It&rsquo;s me and Ned,&rdquo; he giggled. &ldquo;Oh, and that&rsquo;s me. You recorded really close don&rsquo;t you!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N scrunched her eyes in frustration, it was so obvious that she recorded him admiring every smile, every chuckle that he gave her. </p><p>His eyes widened in sudden realisation. Did she? No, no way she liked him. When the video ended, there was a  silence - one of those awful silences, when you know something&rsquo;s wrong. </p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Peter started in shock. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never talked to me. You only talk to Ned.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N opened her mouth as if to say something before shutting it again avoiding his gaze. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like me.&rdquo; He stared at her waiting for answers, for explanations but there was nothing. What could she say? That she was in love with him the whole time but believed that she didn&rsquo;t deserve him? </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I hoped to help you somehow with the photos but I need to go right now, it&rsquo;s important. You can just show yourself out, can&rsquo;t you? Thanks.&rdquo; She mumbled trying not to cry. In a second Y/N left her room, she needed a fresh air right now to clear her head because, what happened was too much. But maybe it was possible to pretend like it was nothing, she hoped that she could.</p></p>",
