It was just a dream. </i></p><p>His heart was beating too fast to even consider going back to sleep. It\u2019d been three weeks since he\u2019d watched you fade away, along with half of everyone else on Earth. He couldn\u2019t cry anymore, couldn\u2019t physically create tears after what had happened. Nothing hurt worse than watching you die right in front of him. There was nothing he could do about it then and nothing he could now. And that killed him inside. </p><p>He glanced over at the clock. <b><i>4:15AM. </i></b>No one else in the compound would possibly be up right now.</p><p>Tossing the blanket from his body, Steve made quick work of getting up and changing into a new shirt. Heading down to the kitchen, he was surprised to find Natasha standing there eating a sandwich. She looked exhausted. <br/>\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cBad dreams. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d Nat let out a deep breath. \u201cCarol\u2019s still out there looking for Tony. She hasn\u2019t checked in in days.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll find him.\u201d Steve poured himself a glass of water, sipping slowly. </p><p>\u201cSteve, she\u2019s been out there for weeks. We should prepare for \u2013 \u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it!\u201d His fingers tightened around the glass, causing it to crack. \u201cShe\u2019ll find him, and he\u2019ll know what to do. He\u2019ll know how to bring everyone back.\u201d</p><p>Natasha stared at her friend, tears welling in her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll get her back, Steve.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI sure hope so.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Everything reminded him of you. Not a day went by when you didn\u2019t occupy at least ninety percent of Steve\u2019s thoughts. Some days, he missed you so much, he couldn\u2019t physically move. </p><p>He left the compound six months after the snap, going back to the apartment he\u2019d had before you. All pictures of you were kept in a box at the foot of his closet; all except one. That one stayed in his wallet, although after a few years it had started fading, so he tried not to pull it out as much. </p><p>It got easier after a while. Day by day, month by month, it hurt just a touch less. Eventually it got to the point where he remembered you with only a dull ache in his heart. He never forgave himself though, never stopped blaming your death on his own failure. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pulling your punches, Grimith.\u201d </p><p>Steve swung at the CIA agent in front of him and she ducked, landing a right hook into his abdomen. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better. Follow through.\u201d She swung again, hitting his hand pads a few times before kicking one of his legs, forcing him to kneel. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d She rushed, kneeling next to him as he grimaced in pain. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Apologize.\u201d He took a deep breath, rising and offering her a hand. \u201cCombat isn\u2019t a fair trade off of blows. You see an opening, you take it.\u201d </p><p>His alarm went off, alerting him that he had half an hour to get to his next appointment. \u201cSame time next week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d She started slowly as Steve held open the rope for her to climb out of the ring. \u201cWe could always talk outside of training. Perhaps over dinner or drinks?\u201d</p><p>Steve froze. This wasn\u2019t the first time one of his trainees had expressed interest in him. </p><p>He gave Grimith a soft smile. \u201cThanks, but I try not to mix my personal life with my professional life.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He could hear the slight sting of rejection in her voice. \u201cSame time next week, Captain.\u201d </p><p>He quickly unwrapped his hands, stripped and hopped into one of the gym\u2019s showers. The hot water was soothing over his aching muscles. The gym had become like a second home to him. He threw himself in working out and training others; took his mind off the rest of the world. He felt bad for lying to Grimith, but he wasn\u2019t fully ready to try and start something new. He wasn\u2019t ready to move on from you. </p><p>Twenty minutes later, Steve was completely cleaned and across the street, setting up donuts and coffee for his group counseling session. People started trickling in slowly, and within just a few minutes, all of the seats were filled. </p><p>\u201cGood evening, everyone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone want to start us off?\u201d </p><p>There was a thick silence as everyone looked around at each other.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you Steve?\u201d The man to his left, Anthony, asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve been coming to these meetings every week for the past year and a half, yet no one\u2019s heard your side of the story.\u201d</p><p>Steve looked around, everyone seeming to be in agreeance. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest, leaning back in his seat. \u201cIn 1945, I met a woman named Peggy Carter. She was amazing. Beautiful, smart, tough as all hell. But I laid down my life for my country and in doing so, secured the fact that we would never have a future together. When I was recovered and woke up in 2012, she was still alive, but she\u2019d moved on. Got married, had children. She lived a full life and encouraged me to move on and do the same.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s throat was getting tight, but he pushed on. \u201cI never planned on falling in love after Peggy. I was okay with just defending the world until I died. Then, two years later, I met Y/N and my whole world changed completely. As cheesy as it may sound, she turned my whole life around. I wasn\u2019t just fighting to make the world a better place. I was fighting to make the world better <i>for her. </i>Everything I did was for her at that point. But I screwed it up when I became a fugitive in 2016. I thought I was protecting her when I left, but I\u2019d just unknowingly pushed her closer to danger.\u201d</p><p>Steve stopped, willing himself to not cry. Anthony gave him a comforting pat on the arm. \u201cYou\u2019re in a safe space, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Steve took a deep breath. \u201cShe fought next to me in the Battle of Wakanda. We had an agreement; She wasn\u2019t supposed to die, and I wasn\u2019t supposed to let her die. Thanos\u2019 snap didn\u2019t care about our agreement. She dusted right in front of me, and because of her enhancements, she felt it the whole damn time.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help the tears at that point. \u201cI keep wondering to myself, if I hadn\u2019t let her, if she hadn\u2019t been out there with me, would she still be here today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t think like that Steve.\u201d The woman across from him held out a box of tissues, which he took graciously. \u201cYou said it yourself, Thanos wiped out half of all life <i>at random.</i> There\u2019s no way of knowing if any of our choices had any influence on what happened. All we can do is move forward and figure out our lives one day at a time.\u201d</p><p>Steve nodded. \u201cShe was a better person than I was. Compassionate, loving. Now, I\u2019m just hoping to live a life that she\u2019d be proud of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure she would be.\u201d Steve looked over at Anthony. \u201cYou make a noble living, teaching self-defense at the gym. You never hesitate to help out those in need. You\u2019re a good soldier, Steve, but more than that, you\u2019re a good man.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Steve quickly pulled himself together. \u201cAnyone else want the spotlight?\u201d</p><p>Everyone shook their heads. \u201cThen I guess we\u2019ll call it a night. Of course, I\u2019ll be here next Wednesday night at six if anyone thinks they still need help.\u201d </p><p>There was a buzz of conversation as everyone got up to leave, saying their goodbyes. Steve made quick work of cleaning up, folding chairs and sweeping just to make the janitors&rsquo; job a little easier.</p><p>Returning to his apartment, Steve pulled down the box of pictures and sat on the bed to look through them. With every photo, his smile grew. <i>You sleeping, you hiding from his camera, the two of you kissing in front of the Eiffel Tower. </i>He didn\u2019t notice that he\u2019d been crying again until a tear hit the laminated paper.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Every week, Steve\u2019s life continued like that. Training five days a week, counseling every Wednesday, distracting himself with mindless work like repairing his bike. Day in and day out, Steve kept himself busy, kept himself moving to try and keep himself from giving up. </p><p>There was one week though that threw him off. Something just felt <i>wrong, </i>so after that Wednesday\u2019s meeting, he took a detour and found himself at the old Avenger\u2019s compound.</p><p>Natasha sat in front of a miserable peanut butter sandwich, tears rolling down her cheeks as she tried not to have a full meltdown. </p><p>Steve propped himself against a bookshelf and looked at her with a heavy heart, \u201cYou know, I\u2019d offer to cook you dinner, but you seem pretty miserable already.\u201d </p><p>Nat looked up with a small smile. \u201cYou hear to do your laundry?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cAnd to see a friend.\u201d </p><p>Talking to Nat was so comforting to Steve, a comfort he hadn\u2019t allowed himself to indulge in for years. It reminded him of simpler times, easier times when his biggest issue was an army of artificially intelligent robots. He was so caught up with her that he was genuinely startled when Scott Lang popped up on the security cameras.</p><p>Steve was on his feet in a second. \u201cIs this an old message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the front door.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Everything was happening so fast; Steve almost couldn\u2019t process it all. One minute, Tony was slamming the door in his face, telling him that time travel was impossible. The next, he was being fitted for a suit that would be compatible with the Quantum Realm. </p><p>\u201cDid you design her suits?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up from his sketches to where Steve was redressing himself. \u201cThe last one. She didn\u2019t like my first designs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was wrong with them?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled, pausing what he was doing to pull up a holographic closet. Suddenly, Steve was surrounded by suits that were all roughly your size. He immediately saw the issue. \u201cThese look the suits you\u2019ve designed for me.\u201d</p><p>Every single hologram had an almost exact replica of a suit Steve had worn. The designs were all mostly the same, red and white stripes wrapped around the torso with a giant start in the middle of the chest. <br/>\n\u201cIf she had worn these, she would have looked like me.\u201d</p><p>Tony picked up the pain in his friends\u2019 voice. With a sigh, he turned off the projection. \u201cY/N didn\u2019t want the world to think she was trying to be a new you. The world already had a Captain America. She just wanted to help people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died thinking that I\u2019d abandoned her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen when we bring her back, I\u2019d suggest you inform her otherwise.\u201d Tony tossed something at Steve, which he caught easily. \u201cThat\u2019s the key to her room. You might want to take a look inside.\u201d </p><p>Steve looked with confusion between the key and Tony a few times before quickly making his way to the elevator. It was only one floor and he knew he probably would have moved faster on the stairs, but he needed the time to calm the beating of his heart. Although it was still racing by when he got to your door. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t prepared for what he saw when he stepped inside. At first glance, your room was plain. Grey curtains, black sheets, not much personalization at all. When he stepped in and shut the door, he noticed the giant world map all marked up with pins and yarn. There were clusters of headlines and grainy images of him scattered everywhere, with your trail stopping abruptly in the UK. </p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t help by laugh to himself. \u201cOh baby, you were so close.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s urge to fight was renewed as he opened your nightstand drawer and found a framed photo of the two of you. For the past five years, he\u2019d always just assumed that you\u2019d gotten rid of any trace of your relationship. Not once did he consider that you might not have completely moved on. </p><p>He slept in your bed that night. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>This is going to work, Rogers. You\u2019ll get her back. You\u2019ll get everyone back. </i>Steve\u2019s heart was racing as he made his way up onto the time machine. </p><p> \u201cFive years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams; you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know, that doesn\u2019t mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we\u2019re going to win. Whatever it takes. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty good at that.\u201d Rocket whispered. </p><p>Scott raised his eyebrows. \u201cI know right.\u201d</p><p>Nat gave Steve a giddy, almost childlike smile. \u201cSee you in a minute.\u201d </p><p>And just like that, they were off.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Everything happened so fast. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hail Hydra.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can do this all day.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat is America\u2019s ass.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou trust me?\u201d </i></p><p><b><i>Director Margaret Carter. </i></b></p><p>Suddenly, there was only a thin pane of glass and some blinds separating Steve from the woman he\u2019d once loved. She looked so beautiful and <i>alive.</i> Steve wanted so badly just to touch her again, to kiss her and let her know that he was okay; that he didn\u2019t die that day in \u201945. </p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Steve saw the small gold band on her hand and smiled. <i>She\u2019s happy. </i></p><p>Making sure the coast was clear, he gave her one last glance before slipping back out of her office and out of the building. For fear of being recognized, he hung back when he noticed Tony walking with Howard Stark, only giving him a quick thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cYou got the particles?\u201d Tony asked as the two practically ran away from the army base. </p><p>\u201cOf course, I got the particles.\u201d Steve pulled him into the trees where no one could see them. \u201cYou got the cube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d Tony tapped twice on the briefcase in his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s just go home.\u201d </p><p>Despite having just done it thrice in the past hour, soaring through space and time still gave Steve a slightly queasy feeling. He was relieved to land back in the compound next to Tony and Bruce.</p><p>Bruce looked around. \u201cDid we get them all?\u201d</p><p>Rhodey chuckled, holding up the power stone in its rock. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me this actually worked?\u201d</p><p>Steve noticed when Clint sunk to his knees, pain overcoming his features. </p><p>\u201cClint, where\u2019s Nat?\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Steve had his shield up, protecting himself as Bruce howled in pain. He took a step forward. </p><p>\u201cBruce, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Banner!\u201d Tony took the same step up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, I\u2019m okay.\u201d Bruce hoists his arm up, struggling to snap his fingers. </p><p>There\u2019s a wash of energy over the room and Bruce falls to the floor and the gauntlet falls away. </p><p>\u201cBruce!\u201d Steve drops to his knees next to his friend but holds back from touching him for fear of causing more pain.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move him!\u201d Tony quickly iced Bruce\u2019s burnt arm. Bruce held tight to Steve\u2019s arm. </p><p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d </p><p>Thor was on his other side. \u201cWorth a shot. It\u2019s over. It\u2019s okay.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Scott called from where he was standing at the window. \u201cI think it worked.\u201d </p><p>Bruce opened his eyes in relief, smiling. That smile was gone in a split second when he saw the array of missiles fired at the compound.</p><p><i>CRASH!</i></p><p>For a split second, Steve felt like he\u2019d been hit by a bus. Every muscle and every bone in his body ached. </p><p>\u201cCome on buddy. Wake up.\u201d </p><p>Steve gasped as his eye flew open. Tony was standing over his, looking worse for wear and holding his shield. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my man. You lose this again, I\u2019m keeping it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Steve groaned as he stood and took the metal disk. </p><p>\u201cYou mess with time; it tends to mess back. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>The two made their way through the rubble to where Thor was staring at a sitting Thanos.</p><p><i>How is that possible? </i>Steve thought angrily. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he been doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the stones?\u201d Steve strapped his shield to his arm tightly, standing up just a bit straighter. </p><p>Tony motioned to the mess. \u201cSomewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn\u2019t have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we keep it that way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know this is a trap, right?\u201d</p><p>Tony never took his eyes off the titan. \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t much care.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood. Just as long as we\u2019re all in agreement.\u201d Thor took a deep breath and held out both his hands. The rumble of lightning was heard, and it struck him, delivering both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir and materializing his armor. \u201cLet\u2019s kill him properly this time.\u201d </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You could feel as every fiber of your being was stitched back together. Everything was moving excruciatingly slow, but finally, after what felt like an eternity, you were on your feet in the fields of Wakanda. You ignored the ache in your muscles as you start walking around, watching everyone pick themselves up. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d You turned to Bucky, who was observing the grounds just as you were. \u201cWhere\u2019s Steve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You tapped the communicator in your ear. \u201cSteve? Tony? Can anybody hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d Sam was lying on his back, wings extended. You held out a hand to help him to his feet. \u201cI hate to be the one to say it, but I\u2019m pretty sure we died.\u201d </p><p>King T\u2019Challa stood next to you. \u201cI think he is right.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen that begs the question. How the hell are we alive now?\u201d </p><p>Your mask materialized over your head. \u201cT.A.D.A.S.H.I., call Tony.\u201d </p><p>There were a million things happening in front of your eyes, but you focused on the top corner where your A.I. was searching. \u201cMadam, it would appear as though F.R.I.D.A.Y. just sent out a distress signal. The War Machine suit sent out the same signal. Shall I respond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are outside the compound in New York. It seems there\u2019s been some kind of explosion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to New York!\u201d You rushed, mask disappearing. </p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d You turned to where Bucky was pointing. There were gold spark floating mid-air, and they were popping up all over the field. Slowly, you moved towards the one closest to you as it expanded. Your gun was drawn when a guy popped his head through. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cMy name is Doctor Steven Strange. I\u2019m, for lack of a better term, a wizard. Right now, Thanos is about to kill your friend, Captain Rogers. Any more questions.\u201d</p><p>You gave him an incredulous expression. \u201cWhy should we trust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you being serious right now?\u201d You nodded. The portal expanded ever further and there, standing next to him was Peter.</p><p>\u201cKid!\u201d You rushed through, wrapping your arms around him in relief. \u201cYou\u2019re okay!\u201d <br/>\nHe hugged you back. \u201cI mean, technically I\u2019m in space, but sure I\u2019m okay. Although the wizard says that Mr. Stark is in a lot of trouble right now so we should probably go help him.\u201d </p><p>You held onto him for just a second longer before releasing and turning back to Dr. Strange. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d </p><p>You watched in shock and disbelief as all of the portals in Wakanda expanded and Strange\u2019s head ducked into them to give the same spiel. There was a crackle on your communicator and suddenly the destination on the other side of the portal wasn\u2019t Wakanda, but rather the destroyed building where Steve was facing Thanos <i>alone.</i></p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d you muttered fondly. Turning back to Peter, you spoke quickly. \u201cWhen we get out there, you stay close to me. I cannot \u2013 I repeat, <i>cannot </i>\u2013 lose you again. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d He gave you a weary smile and a thumbs up. </p><p>\u201cCap, do you copy?\u201d Sam\u2019s voice was clear. \u201cCap, can you hear me? On your left.\u201d </p><p>Strange expanded all the portals and Steve watched as everyone he could possibly think of stepped out. You waited, giving him a small smile when his eyes finally found yours.</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry, </i>he mouthed. </p><p>You chuckled. <i>I forgive you. </i></p><p>A giant burst through the rubble, Hulk, Rhodey and <i>a raccoon</i> hopping out of his hand. Everyone lined up as Thanos\u2019 army did the same. </p><p>\u201cStay close kid,\u201d you reminded Peter, moving forward. </p><p>\u201cAvengers\u2026\u201d Steve called, holding his hand out. To your shock, and quite honestly <i>arousal, </i>Mjolnir flew into his grip. \u201cAssemble!\u201d </p><p>Your mask was back on and you were charging the battlefield. \u201cT.A.D.A.S.H.I., keep an eye on Pete for me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d A small window popped up on your screen that mirrored what Peter was seeing, caringly labeled <i>\u2018nanny cam protocol.\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cPepper, do you have eyes on Tony?\u201d You called. </p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m a bit preoccupied right now!\u201d </p><p>\u201cPete!\u201d He popped up in front of you. \u201cFind Stark!\u201d </p><p>You shot and stabbed your way through groups of aliens. The wounds you acquired were an afterthought as all of the anger and frustration was finally being released. Before you could think about it, you were fighting next to Steve.</p><p>\u201cFancy running into you here.\u201d You joked, shooting the thing that was running up behind him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>You were about to say it back when he wrapped his arm around you, holding the shield over your heads as shots rained down. </p><p>\u201cThank you, Captain.\u201d You shot around his head. \u201cI love you too.\u201d </p><p>Your happiness was short-lived as you heard Pete call for help. </p><p>\u201cHey Queens, catch!\u201d Steve threw Mjolnir, Peter\u2019s web snagging it and Pepper catching him midair. </p><p>\u201cMadam, the extra legs on the Iron Spider suit have been severely damaged.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d You pulled away from Steve, mask on. \u201cT.A.D.A.S.H.I., take me to him.\u201d </p><p>The raining fire seized, and you ran as fast as you could, killing mindlessly. When you got to him, he was curled up in a ball around the Iron Gauntlet. </p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re okay.\u201d You knelt next to him, suit building a shield on your back. \u201cT.A.D.A.S.H.I., what\u2019s going on? Why did they stop shooting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething has just entered the atmosphere, Madam.\u201d You both looked up to see a glowing light whizzing through the sky and straight through Thanos\u2019 ship.</p><p>\u201cDanvers, we need an assist here.\u201d </p><p>The light came at you fast, blinding you for a minute as she landed on the other side of Peter. He looked to you and then to her. </p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter Parker.\u201d She gave him a warm smile. You have something for me?\u201d</p><p>You helped him to his feet, and he handed off the Gauntlet. \u201cThat\u2019s got to get to that brown van over there.\u201d</p><p>The three of you looked out across the field. Peter\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, exhaustion taking over his features.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to get it through all that though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Okoye stepped up. \u201cShe\u2019s got help.\u201d </p><p>One by one, you were surrounded. Wanda, Shuri, Pepper, a woman on a flying horse, plus a handful of women you\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done, kid!\u201d You said as you marched with them. \u201cStay down!\u201d </p><p>You fought alongside a woman with green skin and red skin, keeping as many aliens away from Peter as you could. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got the stones!\u201d </p><p>You froze, looking up as Thanos fought Carol. <i>Not again. </i></p><p>He knocked her off, securing the gauntlet on his wrist and raising his arm. \u201cI am inevitable.\u201d </p><p>He snapped. </p><p>Nothing happened. <br/>\nTony was kneeling in front of him. Raising his right arm, he gave Thanos a smirk. \u201cAnd I. Am. Iron. Man.\u201d </p><p>Thanos\u2019 army began decimating. The aliens advancing all turned to dust just before they could reach you. Your heart blossomed with relief. <i>It\u2019s over. </i></p><p>\u201cMadam.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is it, T.A.D.A.S.H.I.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark\u2019s vitals are dropping rapidly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d You rushed to him, Peter hot on your trail. </p><p>Steve caught you before you could kneel next to him. There were tears in your eyes as you processed his burnt arm and pale skin. You turned, crying into Steve\u2019s shoulder at the sound of Peter\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, we did it. We won and you did it, sir. I\u2019m sorry. Tony.\u201d </p><p>You forced yourself to pull it together, wiping your eyes quickly and pulling him close to you.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be okay,\u201d Pepper whispered. \u201cYou can rest now.\u201d </p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>\u201cEverybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn&rsquo;t always roll that way. Maybe this time. I&rsquo;m hoping if you play this back&hellip; it&rsquo;s in celebration. I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back, in somewhat like a normal version of the planet has been restored, if there ever was such a thing. God, what a world. Universe now. If you told me 10 years ago that we weren&rsquo;t alone, let alone you know to this extent&hellip; I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised. But come on, you know. That epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And for better or worse, that&rsquo;s the reality Morgan&rsquo;s going to find a way to grow up in. So, I found a private area to record a little greeting in case of an untimely death on my part. Not that death at any time is ever timely. This time travel thing that we are going to pull off tomorrow&hellip; it&rsquo;s got me scratching my head about the survivability of all this. But then again that&rsquo;s the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. What am I tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it&rsquo;s supposed to.\u201d</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s hologram rose from the chair he was on and bent over, meeting his daughter\u2019s terrified eyes. <i>\u201cI love you 3000.\u201d</i></p><p>You couldn\u2019t help the tears that streamed down your face as the message ended. Steve rubbed a comforting hand over your arm, holding you close as a few tears of his own rolled down his cheeks. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get some air.\u201d You whispered to him, slipping out of his arms. You were careful not to make any not any noise as you stepped outside and took a deep breath. The lake provided a nice layer of background noise, allowing you to sit on the front steps and cry freely. \u00a0</p><p>You didn\u2019t notice when Steve came out and sat next to you.</p><p>\u201cThey were the best of us,\u201d he said softly. </p><p>You nodded, leaning into him. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. All Nat and Tony needed was a good family. They finally got that and Thanos just snatched it away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, if I\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You cut him off with a sad smile. \u201cIf you\u2019d gone up there with her, you would have jumped. Without a second thought.\u201d</p><p>You reached up and stroked his cheek. \u201cYour overwhelming amount of love for others is why I fell in love with you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what happened all those years ago.\u201d He bowed his head in shame. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking straight. I should have just listened to Tony, but I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t beat yourself up for that anymore, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Peggy.\u201d You pulled away from him in confusion. \u201cWhen Tony and I were trying to get the Tesseract in the seventies. I was hiding out and saw her through a window. She had on a wedding ring and as soon as I saw I knew. We were never meant to be together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Thanos\u2019 first attack, I\u2019ve been thinking about destiny and fate and what it all really means. I thought that Peggy was the love of my life in \u201945 and when I woke up, I thought that fate was just playing some cruel game with me. Then I met you and I thought, \u2018Is destiny giving me another chance?\u2019 Of course, I blew it with the Accords, but going back and seeing her married and running SHIELD, it made me realize that even though I loved her and always will, you are my destiny. You always have been. I don\u2019t want to go back and try to fit myself into the life I assumed I\u2019d have. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Build a house, start a family, grow old together. I thought I wanted all of that with her but seeing her just made me realize that I want it with you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSteve, I\u2014\u201d </p><p>He cut you off quickly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me an answer now. I love you and I will wait for as long as you need me to.\u201d</p><p>You searched his eyes for any sign of insincerity or doubt, but there was none. Smiling, you leaned in to peck his lips. </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you like 105? Can you even still have kids?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, pulling you as close as possible. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d </p><p><b><i>the end. </i></b></p>",

It was just a dream. </i></p><p>His heart was beating too fast to even consider going back to sleep. It\u2019d been three weeks since he\u2019d watched you fade away, along with half of everyone else on Earth. He couldn\u2019t cry anymore, couldn\u2019t physically create tears after what had happened. Nothing hurt worse than watching you die right in front of him. There was nothing he could do about it then and nothing he could now. And that killed him inside. </p><p>He glanced over at the clock. <b><i>4:15AM. </i></b>No one else in the compound would possibly be up right now.</p><p>Tossing the blanket from his body, Steve made quick work of getting up and changing into a new shirt. Heading down to the kitchen, he was surprised to find Natasha standing there eating a sandwich. She looked exhausted. <br>\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cBad dreams. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d Nat let out a deep breath. \u201cCarol\u2019s still out there looking for Tony. She hasn\u2019t checked in in days.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll find him.\u201d Steve poured himself a glass of water, sipping slowly. </p><p>\u201cSteve, she\u2019s been out there for weeks. We should prepare for \u2013 \u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it!\u201d His fingers tightened around the glass, causing it to crack. \u201cShe\u2019ll find him, and he\u2019ll know what to do. He\u2019ll know how to bring everyone back.\u201d</p><p>Natasha stared at her friend, tears welling in her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll get her back, Steve.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI sure hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Everything reminded him of you. Not a day went by when you didn\u2019t occupy at least ninety percent of Steve\u2019s thoughts. Some days, he missed you so much, he couldn\u2019t physically move. </p><p>He left the compound six months after the snap, going back to the apartment he\u2019d had before you. All pictures of you were kept in a box at the foot of his closet; all except one. That one stayed in his wallet, although after a few years it had started fading, so he tried not to pull it out as much. </p><p>It got easier after a while. Day by day, month by month, it hurt just a touch less. Eventually it got to the point where he remembered you with only a dull ache in his heart. He never forgave himself though, never stopped blaming your death on his own failure. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pulling your punches, Grimith.\u201d </p><p>Steve swung at the CIA agent in front of him and she ducked, landing a right hook into his abdomen. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better. Follow through.\u201d She swung again, hitting his hand pads a few times before kicking one of his legs, forcing him to kneel. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d She rushed, kneeling next to him as he grimaced in pain. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Apologize.\u201d He took a deep breath, rising and offering her a hand. \u201cCombat isn\u2019t a fair trade off of blows. You see an opening, you take it.\u201d </p><p>His alarm went off, alerting him that he had half an hour to get to his next appointment. \u201cSame time next week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d She started slowly as Steve held open the rope for her to climb out of the ring. \u201cWe could always talk outside of training. Perhaps over dinner or drinks?\u201d</p><p>Steve froze. This wasn\u2019t the first time one of his trainees had expressed interest in him. </p><p>He gave Grimith a soft smile. \u201cThanks, but I try not to mix my personal life with my professional life.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He could hear the slight sting of rejection in her voice. \u201cSame time next week, Captain.\u201d </p><p>He quickly unwrapped his hands, stripped and hopped into one of the gym\u2019s showers. The hot water was soothing over his aching muscles. The gym had become like a second home to him. He threw himself in working out and training others; took his mind off the rest of the world. He felt bad for lying to Grimith, but he wasn\u2019t fully ready to try and start something new. He wasn\u2019t ready to move on from you. </p><p>Twenty minutes later, Steve was completely cleaned and across the street, setting up donuts and coffee for his group counseling session. People started trickling in slowly, and within just a few minutes, all of the seats were filled. </p><p>\u201cGood evening, everyone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone want to start us off?\u201d </p><p>There was a thick silence as everyone looked around at each other.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you Steve?\u201d The man to his left, Anthony, asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve been coming to these meetings every week for the past year and a half, yet no one\u2019s heard your side of the story.\u201d</p><p>Steve looked around, everyone seeming to be in agreeance. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest, leaning back in his seat. \u201cIn 1945, I met a woman named Peggy Carter. She was amazing. Beautiful, smart, tough as all hell. But I laid down my life for my country and in doing so, secured the fact that we would never have a future together. When I was recovered and woke up in 2012, she was still alive, but she\u2019d moved on. Got married, had children. She lived a full life and encouraged me to move on and do the same.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s throat was getting tight, but he pushed on. \u201cI never planned on falling in love after Peggy. I was okay with just defending the world until I died. Then, two years later, I met Y/N and my whole world changed completely. As cheesy as it may sound, she turned my whole life around. I wasn\u2019t just fighting to make the world a better place. I was fighting to make the world better <i>for her. </i>Everything I did was for her at that point. But I screwed it up when I became a fugitive in 2016. I thought I was protecting her when I left, but I\u2019d just unknowingly pushed her closer to danger.\u201d</p><p>Steve stopped, willing himself to not cry. Anthony gave him a comforting pat on the arm. \u201cYou\u2019re in a safe space, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Steve took a deep breath. \u201cShe fought next to me in the Battle of Wakanda. We had an agreement; She wasn\u2019t supposed to die, and I wasn\u2019t supposed to let her die. Thanos\u2019 snap didn\u2019t care about our agreement. She dusted right in front of me, and because of her enhancements, she felt it the whole damn time.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help the tears at that point. \u201cI keep wondering to myself, if I hadn\u2019t let her, if she hadn\u2019t been out there with me, would she still be here today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t think like that Steve.\u201d The woman across from him held out a box of tissues, which he took graciously. \u201cYou said it yourself, Thanos wiped out half of all life <i>at random.</i> There\u2019s no way of knowing if any of our choices had any influence on what happened. All we can do is move forward and figure out our lives one day at a time.\u201d</p><p>Steve nodded. \u201cShe was a better person than I was. Compassionate, loving. Now, I\u2019m just hoping to live a life that she\u2019d be proud of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure she would be.\u201d Steve looked over at Anthony. \u201cYou make a noble living, teaching self-defense at the gym. You never hesitate to help out those in need. You\u2019re a good soldier, Steve, but more than that, you\u2019re a good man.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Steve quickly pulled himself together. \u201cAnyone else want the spotlight?\u201d</p><p>Everyone shook their heads. \u201cThen I guess we\u2019ll call it a night. Of course, I\u2019ll be here next Wednesday night at six if anyone thinks they still need help.\u201d </p><p>There was a buzz of conversation as everyone got up to leave, saying their goodbyes. Steve made quick work of cleaning up, folding chairs and sweeping just to make the janitors\u2019 job a little easier.</p><p>Returning to his apartment, Steve pulled down the box of pictures and sat on the bed to look through them. With every photo, his smile grew. <i>You sleeping, you hiding from his camera, the two of you kissing in front of the Eiffel Tower. </i>He didn\u2019t notice that he\u2019d been crying again until a tear hit the laminated paper.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Every week, Steve\u2019s life continued like that. Training five days a week, counseling every Wednesday, distracting himself with mindless work like repairing his bike. Day in and day out, Steve kept himself busy, kept himself moving to try and keep himself from giving up. </p><p>There was one week though that threw him off. Something just felt <i>wrong, </i>so after that Wednesday\u2019s meeting, he took a detour and found himself at the old Avenger\u2019s compound.</p><p>Natasha sat in front of a miserable peanut butter sandwich, tears rolling down her cheeks as she tried not to have a full meltdown. </p><p>Steve propped himself against a bookshelf and looked at her with a heavy heart, \u201cYou know, I\u2019d offer to cook you dinner, but you seem pretty miserable already.\u201d </p><p>Nat looked up with a small smile. \u201cYou hear to do your laundry?\u201d<br>\n\u201cAnd to see a friend.\u201d </p><p>Talking to Nat was so comforting to Steve, a comfort he hadn\u2019t allowed himself to indulge in for years. It reminded him of simpler times, easier times when his biggest issue was an army of artificially intelligent robots. He was so caught up with her that he was genuinely startled when Scott Lang popped up on the security cameras.</p><p>Steve was on his feet in a second. \u201cIs this an old message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the front door.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Everything was happening so fast; Steve almost couldn\u2019t process it all. One minute, Tony was slamming the door in his face, telling him that time travel was impossible. The next, he was being fitted for a suit that would be compatible with the Quantum Realm. </p><p>\u201cDid you design her suits?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up from his sketches to where Steve was redressing himself. \u201cThe last one. She didn\u2019t like my first designs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was wrong with them?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled, pausing what he was doing to pull up a holographic closet. Suddenly, Steve was surrounded by suits that were all roughly your size. He immediately saw the issue. \u201cThese look the suits you\u2019ve designed for me.\u201d</p><p>Every single hologram had an almost exact replica of a suit Steve had worn. The designs were all mostly the same, red and white stripes wrapped around the torso with a giant start in the middle of the chest. <br>\n\u201cIf she had worn these, she would have looked like me.\u201d</p><p>Tony picked up the pain in his friends\u2019 voice. With a sigh, he turned off the projection. \u201cY/N didn\u2019t want the world to think she was trying to be a new you. The world already had a Captain America. She just wanted to help people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died thinking that I\u2019d abandoned her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen when we bring her back, I\u2019d suggest you inform her otherwise.\u201d Tony tossed something at Steve, which he caught easily. \u201cThat\u2019s the key to her room. You might want to take a look inside.\u201d </p><p>Steve looked with confusion between the key and Tony a few times before quickly making his way to the elevator. It was only one floor and he knew he probably would have moved faster on the stairs, but he needed the time to calm the beating of his heart. Although it was still racing by when he got to your door. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t prepared for what he saw when he stepped inside. At first glance, your room was plain. Grey curtains, black sheets, not much personalization at all. When he stepped in and shut the door, he noticed the giant world map all marked up with pins and yarn. There were clusters of headlines and grainy images of him scattered everywhere, with your trail stopping abruptly in the UK. </p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t help by laugh to himself. \u201cOh baby, you were so close.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s urge to fight was renewed as he opened your nightstand drawer and found a framed photo of the two of you. For the past five years, he\u2019d always just assumed that you\u2019d gotten rid of any trace of your relationship. Not once did he consider that you might not have completely moved on. </p><p>He slept in your bed that night. </p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>This is going to work, Rogers. You\u2019ll get her back. You\u2019ll get everyone back. </i>Steve\u2019s heart was racing as he made his way up onto the time machine. </p><p> \u201cFive years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams; you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know, that doesn\u2019t mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we\u2019re going to win. Whatever it takes. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty good at that.\u201d Rocket whispered. </p><p>Scott raised his eyebrows. \u201cI know right.\u201d</p><p>Nat gave Steve a giddy, almost childlike smile. \u201cSee you in a minute.\u201d </p><p>And just like that, they were off.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Everything happened so fast. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hail Hydra.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can do this all day.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat is America\u2019s ass.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou trust me?\u201d </i></p><p><b><i>Director Margaret Carter. </i></b></p><p>Suddenly, there was only a thin pane of glass and some blinds separating Steve from the woman he\u2019d once loved. She looked so beautiful and <i>alive.</i> Steve wanted so badly just to touch her again, to kiss her and let her know that he was okay; that he didn\u2019t die that day in \u201945. </p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Steve saw the small gold band on her hand and smiled. <i>She\u2019s happy. </i></p><p>Making sure the coast was clear, he gave her one last glance before slipping back out of her office and out of the building. For fear of being recognized, he hung back when he noticed Tony walking with Howard Stark, only giving him a quick thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cYou got the particles?\u201d Tony asked as the two practically ran away from the army base. </p><p>\u201cOf course, I got the particles.\u201d Steve pulled him into the trees where no one could see them. \u201cYou got the cube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d Tony tapped twice on the briefcase in his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s just go home.\u201d </p><p>Despite having just done it thrice in the past hour, soaring through space and time still gave Steve a slightly queasy feeling. He was relieved to land back in the compound next to Tony and Bruce.</p><p>Bruce looked around. \u201cDid we get them all?\u201d</p><p>Rhodey chuckled, holding up the power stone in its rock. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me this actually worked?\u201d</p><p>Steve noticed when Clint sunk to his knees, pain overcoming his features. </p><p>\u201cClint, where\u2019s Nat?\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Steve had his shield up, protecting himself as Bruce howled in pain. He took a step forward. </p><p>\u201cBruce, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Banner!\u201d Tony took the same step up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, I\u2019m okay.\u201d Bruce hoists his arm up, struggling to snap his fingers. </p><p>There\u2019s a wash of energy over the room and Bruce falls to the floor and the gauntlet falls away. </p><p>\u201cBruce!\u201d Steve drops to his knees next to his friend but holds back from touching him for fear of causing more pain.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move him!\u201d Tony quickly iced Bruce\u2019s burnt arm. Bruce held tight to Steve\u2019s arm. </p><p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d </p><p>Thor was on his other side. \u201cWorth a shot. It\u2019s over. It\u2019s okay.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Scott called from where he was standing at the window. \u201cI think it worked.\u201d </p><p>Bruce opened his eyes in relief, smiling. That smile was gone in a split second when he saw the array of missiles fired at the compound.</p><p><i>CRASH!</i></p><p>For a split second, Steve felt like he\u2019d been hit by a bus. Every muscle and every bone in his body ached. </p><p>\u201cCome on buddy. Wake up.\u201d </p><p>Steve gasped as his eye flew open. Tony was standing over his, looking worse for wear and holding his shield. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my man. You lose this again, I\u2019m keeping it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Steve groaned as he stood and took the metal disk. </p><p>\u201cYou mess with time; it tends to mess back. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>The two made their way through the rubble to where Thor was staring at a sitting Thanos.</p><p><i>How is that possible? </i>Steve thought angrily. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he been doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the stones?\u201d Steve strapped his shield to his arm tightly, standing up just a bit straighter. </p><p>Tony motioned to the mess. \u201cSomewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn\u2019t have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we keep it that way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know this is a trap, right?\u201d</p><p>Tony never took his eyes off the titan. \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t much care.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood. Just as long as we\u2019re all in agreement.\u201d Thor took a deep breath and held out both his hands. The rumble of lightning was heard, and it struck him, delivering both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir and materializing his armor. \u201cLet\u2019s kill him properly this time.\u201d </p><p>\u2013</p><p>You could feel as every fiber of your being was stitched back together. Everything was moving excruciatingly slow, but finally, after what felt like an eternity, you were on your feet in the fields of Wakanda. You ignored the ache in your muscles as you start walking around, watching everyone pick themselves up. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d You turned to Bucky, who was observing the grounds just as you were. \u201cWhere\u2019s Steve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You tapped the communicator in your ear. \u201cSteve? Tony? Can anybody hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d Sam was lying on his back, wings extended. You held out a hand to help him to his feet. \u201cI hate to be the one to say it, but I\u2019m pretty sure we died.\u201d </p><p>King T\u2019Challa stood next to you. \u201cI think he is right.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen that begs the question. How the hell are we alive now?\u201d </p><p>Your mask materialized over your head. \u201cT.A.D.A.S.H.I., call Tony.\u201d </p><p>There were a million things happening in front of your eyes, but you focused on the top corner where your A.I. was searching. \u201cMadam, it would appear as though F.R.I.D.A.Y. just sent out a distress signal. The War Machine suit sent out the same signal. Shall I respond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are outside the compound in New York. It seems there\u2019s been some kind of explosion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to New York!\u201d You rushed, mask disappearing. </p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d You turned to where Bucky was pointing. There were gold spark floating mid-air, and they were popping up all over the field. Slowly, you moved towards the one closest to you as it expanded. Your gun was drawn when a guy popped his head through. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cMy name is Doctor Steven Strange. I\u2019m, for lack of a better term, a wizard. Right now, Thanos is about to kill your friend, Captain Rogers. Any more questions.\u201d</p><p>You gave him an incredulous expression. \u201cWhy should we trust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you being serious right now?\u201d You nodded. The portal expanded ever further and there, standing next to him was Peter.</p><p>\u201cKid!\u201d You rushed through, wrapping your arms around him in relief. \u201cYou\u2019re okay!\u201d <br>\nHe hugged you back. \u201cI mean, technically I\u2019m in space, but sure I\u2019m okay. Although the wizard says that Mr. Stark is in a lot of trouble right now so we should probably go help him.\u201d </p><p>You held onto him for just a second longer before releasing and turning back to Dr. Strange. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d </p><p>You watched in shock and disbelief as all of the portals in Wakanda expanded and Strange\u2019s head ducked into them to give the same spiel. There was a crackle on your communicator and suddenly the destination on the other side of the portal wasn\u2019t Wakanda, but rather the destroyed building where Steve was facing Thanos <i>alone.</i></p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d you muttered fondly. Turning back to Peter, you spoke quickly. \u201cWhen we get out there, you stay close to me. I cannot \u2013 I repeat, <i>cannot </i>\u2013 lose you again. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d He gave you a weary smile and a thumbs up. </p><p>\u201cCap, do you copy?\u201d Sam\u2019s voice was clear. \u201cCap, can you hear me? On your left.\u201d </p><p>Strange expanded all the portals and Steve watched as everyone he could possibly think of stepped out. You waited, giving him a small smile when his eyes finally found yours.</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry, </i>he mouthed. </p><p>You chuckled. <i>I forgive you. </i></p><p>A giant burst through the rubble, Hulk, Rhodey and <i>a raccoon</i> hopping out of his hand. Everyone lined up as Thanos\u2019 army did the same. </p><p>\u201cStay close kid,\u201d you reminded Peter, moving forward. </p><p>\u201cAvengers\u2026\u201d Steve called, holding his hand out. To your shock, and quite honestly <i>arousal, </i>Mjolnir flew into his grip. \u201cAssemble!\u201d </p><p>Your mask was back on and you were charging the battlefield. \u201cT.A.D.A.S.H.I., keep an eye on Pete for me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d A small window popped up on your screen that mirrored what Peter was seeing, caringly labeled <i>\u2018nanny cam protocol.\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cPepper, do you have eyes on Tony?\u201d You called. </p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m a bit preoccupied right now!\u201d </p><p>\u201cPete!\u201d He popped up in front of you. \u201cFind Stark!\u201d </p><p>You shot and stabbed your way through groups of aliens. The wounds you acquired were an afterthought as all of the anger and frustration was finally being released. Before you could think about it, you were fighting next to Steve.</p><p>\u201cFancy running into you here.\u201d You joked, shooting the thing that was running up behind him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>You were about to say it back when he wrapped his arm around you, holding the shield over your heads as shots rained down. </p><p>\u201cThank you, Captain.\u201d You shot around his head. \u201cI love you too.\u201d </p><p>Your happiness was short-lived as you heard Pete call for help. </p><p>\u201cHey Queens, catch!\u201d Steve threw Mjolnir, Peter\u2019s web snagging it and Pepper catching him midair. </p><p>\u201cMadam, the extra legs on the Iron Spider suit have been severely damaged.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d You pulled away from Steve, mask on. \u201cT.A.D.A.S.H.I., take me to him.\u201d </p><p>The raining fire seized, and you ran as fast as you could, killing mindlessly. When you got to him, he was curled up in a ball around the Iron Gauntlet. </p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re okay.\u201d You knelt next to him, suit building a shield on your back. \u201cT.A.D.A.S.H.I., what\u2019s going on? Why did they stop shooting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething has just entered the atmosphere, Madam.\u201d You both looked up to see a glowing light whizzing through the sky and straight through Thanos\u2019 ship.</p><p>\u201cDanvers, we need an assist here.\u201d </p><p>The light came at you fast, blinding you for a minute as she landed on the other side of Peter. He looked to you and then to her. </p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter Parker.\u201d She gave him a warm smile. You have something for me?\u201d</p><p>You helped him to his feet, and he handed off the Gauntlet. \u201cThat\u2019s got to get to that brown van over there.\u201d</p><p>The three of you looked out across the field. Peter\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, exhaustion taking over his features.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to get it through all that though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Okoye stepped up. \u201cShe\u2019s got help.\u201d </p><p>One by one, you were surrounded. Wanda, Shuri, Pepper, a woman on a flying horse, plus a handful of women you\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done, kid!\u201d You said as you marched with them. \u201cStay down!\u201d </p><p>You fought alongside a woman with green skin and red skin, keeping as many aliens away from Peter as you could. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got the stones!\u201d </p><p>You froze, looking up as Thanos fought Carol. <i>Not again. </i></p><p>He knocked her off, securing the gauntlet on his wrist and raising his arm. \u201cI am inevitable.\u201d </p><p>He snapped. </p><p>Nothing happened. <br>\nTony was kneeling in front of him. Raising his right arm, he gave Thanos a smirk. \u201cAnd I. Am. Iron. Man.\u201d </p><p>Thanos\u2019 army began decimating. The aliens advancing all turned to dust just before they could reach you. Your heart blossomed with relief. <i>It\u2019s over. </i></p><p>\u201cMadam.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is it, T.A.D.A.S.H.I.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark\u2019s vitals are dropping rapidly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d You rushed to him, Peter hot on your trail. </p><p>Steve caught you before you could kneel next to him. There were tears in your eyes as you processed his burnt arm and pale skin. You turned, crying into Steve\u2019s shoulder at the sound of Peter\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, we did it. We won and you did it, sir. I\u2019m sorry. Tony.\u201d </p><p>You forced yourself to pull it together, wiping your eyes quickly and pulling him close to you.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be okay,\u201d Pepper whispered. \u201cYou can rest now.\u201d </p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>\u201cEverybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn\u2019t always roll that way. Maybe this time. I\u2019m hoping if you play this back\u2026 it\u2019s in celebration. I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back, in somewhat like a normal version of the planet has been restored, if there ever was such a thing. God, what a world. Universe now. If you told me 10 years ago that we weren\u2019t alone, let alone you know to this extent\u2026 I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised. But come on, you know. That epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And for better or worse, that\u2019s the reality Morgan\u2019s going to find a way to grow up in. So, I found a private area to record a little greeting in case of an untimely death on my part. Not that death at any time is ever timely. This time travel thing that we are going to pull off tomorrow\u2026 it\u2019s got me scratching my head about the survivability of all this. But then again that\u2019s the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. What am I tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it\u2019s supposed to.\u201d</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s hologram rose from the chair he was on and bent over, meeting his daughter\u2019s terrified eyes. <i>\u201cI love you 3000.\u201d</i></p><p>You couldn\u2019t help the tears that streamed down your face as the message ended. Steve rubbed a comforting hand over your arm, holding you close as a few tears of his own rolled down his cheeks. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get some air.\u201d You whispered to him, slipping out of his arms. You were careful not to make any not any noise as you stepped outside and took a deep breath. The lake provided a nice layer of background noise, allowing you to sit on the front steps and cry freely. \u00a0</p><p>You didn\u2019t notice when Steve came out and sat next to you.</p><p>\u201cThey were the best of us,\u201d he said softly. </p><p>You nodded, leaning into him. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. All Nat and Tony needed was a good family. They finally got that and Thanos just snatched it away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, if I\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You cut him off with a sad smile. \u201cIf you\u2019d gone up there with her, you would have jumped. Without a second thought.\u201d</p><p>You reached up and stroked his cheek. \u201cYour overwhelming amount of love for others is why I fell in love with you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what happened all those years ago.\u201d He bowed his head in shame. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking straight. I should have just listened to Tony, but I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t beat yourself up for that anymore, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Peggy.\u201d You pulled away from him in confusion. \u201cWhen Tony and I were trying to get the Tesseract in the seventies. I was hiding out and saw her through a window. She had on a wedding ring and as soon as I saw I knew. We were never meant to be together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Thanos\u2019 first attack, I\u2019ve been thinking about destiny and fate and what it all really means. I thought that Peggy was the love of my life in \u201945 and when I woke up, I thought that fate was just playing some cruel game with me. Then I met you and I thought, \u2018Is destiny giving me another chance?\u2019 Of course, I blew it with the Accords, but going back and seeing her married and running SHIELD, it made me realize that even though I loved her and always will, you are my destiny. You always have been. I don\u2019t want to go back and try to fit myself into the life I assumed I\u2019d have. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Build a house, start a family, grow old together. I thought I wanted all of that with her but seeing her just made me realize that I want it with you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSteve, I\u2014\u201d </p><p>He cut you off quickly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me an answer now. I love you and I will wait for as long as you need me to.\u201d</p><p>You searched his eyes for any sign of insincerity or doubt, but there was none. Smiling, you leaned in to peck his lips. </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you like 105? Can you even still have kids?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, pulling you as close as possible. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d </p><p><b><i>the end. </i></b></p></p>",

It was just a dream. </i></p><p>His heart was beating too fast to even consider going back to sleep. It\u2019d been three weeks since he\u2019d watched you fade away, along with half of everyone else on Earth. He couldn\u2019t cry anymore, couldn\u2019t physically create tears after what had happened. Nothing hurt worse than watching you die right in front of him. There was nothing he could do about it then and nothing he could now. And that killed him inside. </p><p>He glanced over at the clock. <b><i>4:15AM. </i></b>No one else in the compound would possibly be up right now.</p><p>Tossing the blanket from his body, Steve made quick work of getting up and changing into a new shirt. Heading down to the kitchen, he was surprised to find Natasha standing there eating a sandwich. She looked exhausted. <br>\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cBad dreams. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d Nat let out a deep breath. \u201cCarol\u2019s still out there looking for Tony. She hasn\u2019t checked in in days.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll find him.\u201d Steve poured himself a glass of water, sipping slowly. </p><p>\u201cSteve, she\u2019s been out there for weeks. We should prepare for \u2013 \u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it!\u201d His fingers tightened around the glass, causing it to crack. \u201cShe\u2019ll find him, and he\u2019ll know what to do. He\u2019ll know how to bring everyone back.\u201d</p><p>Natasha stared at her friend, tears welling in her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll get her back, Steve.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI sure hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Everything reminded him of you. Not a day went by when you didn\u2019t occupy at least ninety percent of Steve\u2019s thoughts. Some days, he missed you so much, he couldn\u2019t physically move. </p><p>He left the compound six months after the snap, going back to the apartment he\u2019d had before you. All pictures of you were kept in a box at the foot of his closet; all except one. That one stayed in his wallet, although after a few years it had started fading, so he tried not to pull it out as much. </p><p>It got easier after a while. Day by day, month by month, it hurt just a touch less. Eventually it got to the point where he remembered you with only a dull ache in his heart. He never forgave himself though, never stopped blaming your death on his own failure. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pulling your punches, Grimith.\u201d </p><p>Steve swung at the CIA agent in front of him and she ducked, landing a right hook into his abdomen. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better. Follow through.\u201d She swung again, hitting his hand pads a few times before kicking one of his legs, forcing him to kneel. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d She rushed, kneeling next to him as he grimaced in pain. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Apologize.\u201d He took a deep breath, rising and offering her a hand. \u201cCombat isn\u2019t a fair trade off of blows. You see an opening, you take it.\u201d </p><p>His alarm went off, alerting him that he had half an hour to get to his next appointment. \u201cSame time next week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d She started slowly as Steve held open the rope for her to climb out of the ring. \u201cWe could always talk outside of training. Perhaps over dinner or drinks?\u201d</p><p>Steve froze. This wasn\u2019t the first time one of his trainees had expressed interest in him. </p><p>He gave Grimith a soft smile. \u201cThanks, but I try not to mix my personal life with my professional life.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He could hear the slight sting of rejection in her voice. \u201cSame time next week, Captain.\u201d </p><p>He quickly unwrapped his hands, stripped and hopped into one of the gym\u2019s showers. The hot water was soothing over his aching muscles. The gym had become like a second home to him. He threw himself in working out and training others; took his mind off the rest of the world. He felt bad for lying to Grimith, but he wasn\u2019t fully ready to try and start something new. He wasn\u2019t ready to move on from you. </p><p>Twenty minutes later, Steve was completely cleaned and across the street, setting up donuts and coffee for his group counseling session. People started trickling in slowly, and within just a few minutes, all of the seats were filled. </p><p>\u201cGood evening, everyone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone want to start us off?\u201d </p><p>There was a thick silence as everyone looked around at each other.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you Steve?\u201d The man to his left, Anthony, asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve been coming to these meetings every week for the past year and a half, yet no one\u2019s heard your side of the story.\u201d</p><p>Steve looked around, everyone seeming to be in agreeance. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest, leaning back in his seat. \u201cIn 1945, I met a woman named Peggy Carter. She was amazing. Beautiful, smart, tough as all hell. But I laid down my life for my country and in doing so, secured the fact that we would never have a future together. When I was recovered and woke up in 2012, she was still alive, but she\u2019d moved on. Got married, had children. She lived a full life and encouraged me to move on and do the same.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s throat was getting tight, but he pushed on. \u201cI never planned on falling in love after Peggy. I was okay with just defending the world until I died. Then, two years later, I met Y/N and my whole world changed completely. As cheesy as it may sound, she turned my whole life around. I wasn\u2019t just fighting to make the world a better place. I was fighting to make the world better <i>for her. </i>Everything I did was for her at that point. But I screwed it up when I became a fugitive in 2016. I thought I was protecting her when I left, but I\u2019d just unknowingly pushed her closer to danger.\u201d</p><p>Steve stopped, willing himself to not cry. Anthony gave him a comforting pat on the arm. \u201cYou\u2019re in a safe space, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Steve took a deep breath. \u201cShe fought next to me in the Battle of Wakanda. We had an agreement; She wasn\u2019t supposed to die, and I wasn\u2019t supposed to let her die. Thanos\u2019 snap didn\u2019t care about our agreement. She dusted right in front of me, and because of her enhancements, she felt it the whole damn time.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help the tears at that point. \u201cI keep wondering to myself, if I hadn\u2019t let her, if she hadn\u2019t been out there with me, would she still be here today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t think like that Steve.\u201d The woman across from him held out a box of tissues, which he took graciously. \u201cYou said it yourself, Thanos wiped out half of all life <i>at random.</i> There\u2019s no way of knowing if any of our choices had any influence on what happened. All we can do is move forward and figure out our lives one day at a time.\u201d</p><p>Steve nodded. \u201cShe was a better person than I was. Compassionate, loving. Now, I\u2019m just hoping to live a life that she\u2019d be proud of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure she would be.\u201d Steve looked over at Anthony. \u201cYou make a noble living, teaching self-defense at the gym. You never hesitate to help out those in need. You\u2019re a good soldier, Steve, but more than that, you\u2019re a good man.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Steve quickly pulled himself together. \u201cAnyone else want the spotlight?\u201d</p><p>Everyone shook their heads. \u201cThen I guess we\u2019ll call it a night. Of course, I\u2019ll be here next Wednesday night at six if anyone thinks they still need help.\u201d </p><p>There was a buzz of conversation as everyone got up to leave, saying their goodbyes. Steve made quick work of cleaning up, folding chairs and sweeping just to make the janitors\u2019 job a little easier.</p><p>Returning to his apartment, Steve pulled down the box of pictures and sat on the bed to look through them. With every photo, his smile grew. <i>You sleeping, you hiding from his camera, the two of you kissing in front of the Eiffel Tower. </i>He didn\u2019t notice that he\u2019d been crying again until a tear hit the laminated paper.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Every week, Steve\u2019s life continued like that. Training five days a week, counseling every Wednesday, distracting himself with mindless work like repairing his bike. Day in and day out, Steve kept himself busy, kept himself moving to try and keep himself from giving up. </p><p>There was one week though that threw him off. Something just felt <i>wrong, </i>so after that Wednesday\u2019s meeting, he took a detour and found himself at the old Avenger\u2019s compound.</p><p>Natasha sat in front of a miserable peanut butter sandwich, tears rolling down her cheeks as she tried not to have a full meltdown. </p><p>Steve propped himself against a bookshelf and looked at her with a heavy heart, \u201cYou know, I\u2019d offer to cook you dinner, but you seem pretty miserable already.\u201d </p><p>Nat looked up with a small smile. \u201cYou hear to do your laundry?\u201d<br>\n\u201cAnd to see a friend.\u201d </p><p>Talking to Nat was so comforting to Steve, a comfort he hadn\u2019t allowed himself to indulge in for years. It reminded him of simpler times, easier times when his biggest issue was an army of artificially intelligent robots. He was so caught up with her that he was genuinely startled when Scott Lang popped up on the security cameras.</p><p>Steve was on his feet in a second. \u201cIs this an old message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the front door.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Everything was happening so fast; Steve almost couldn\u2019t process it all. One minute, Tony was slamming the door in his face, telling him that time travel was impossible. The next, he was being fitted for a suit that would be compatible with the Quantum Realm. </p><p>\u201cDid you design her suits?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up from his sketches to where Steve was redressing himself. \u201cThe last one. She didn\u2019t like my first designs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was wrong with them?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled, pausing what he was doing to pull up a holographic closet. Suddenly, Steve was surrounded by suits that were all roughly your size. He immediately saw the issue. \u201cThese look the suits you\u2019ve designed for me.\u201d</p><p>Every single hologram had an almost exact replica of a suit Steve had worn. The designs were all mostly the same, red and white stripes wrapped around the torso with a giant start in the middle of the chest. <br>\n\u201cIf she had worn these, she would have looked like me.\u201d</p><p>Tony picked up the pain in his friends\u2019 voice. With a sigh, he turned off the projection. \u201cY/N didn\u2019t want the world to think she was trying to be a new you. The world already had a Captain America. She just wanted to help people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died thinking that I\u2019d abandoned her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen when we bring her back, I\u2019d suggest you inform her otherwise.\u201d Tony tossed something at Steve, which he caught easily. \u201cThat\u2019s the key to her room. You might want to take a look inside.\u201d </p><p>Steve looked with confusion between the key and Tony a few times before quickly making his way to the elevator. It was only one floor and he knew he probably would have moved faster on the stairs, but he needed the time to calm the beating of his heart. Although it was still racing by when he got to your door. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t prepared for what he saw when he stepped inside. At first glance, your room was plain. Grey curtains, black sheets, not much personalization at all. When he stepped in and shut the door, he noticed the giant world map all marked up with pins and yarn. There were clusters of headlines and grainy images of him scattered everywhere, with your trail stopping abruptly in the UK. </p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t help by laugh to himself. \u201cOh baby, you were so close.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s urge to fight was renewed as he opened your nightstand drawer and found a framed photo of the two of you. For the past five years, he\u2019d always just assumed that you\u2019d gotten rid of any trace of your relationship. Not once did he consider that you might not have completely moved on. </p><p>He slept in your bed that night. </p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>This is going to work, Rogers. You\u2019ll get her back. You\u2019ll get everyone back. </i>Steve\u2019s heart was racing as he made his way up onto the time machine. </p><p> \u201cFive years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams; you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know, that doesn\u2019t mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we\u2019re going to win. Whatever it takes. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty good at that.\u201d Rocket whispered. </p><p>Scott raised his eyebrows. \u201cI know right.\u201d</p><p>Nat gave Steve a giddy, almost childlike smile. \u201cSee you in a minute.\u201d </p><p>And just like that, they were off.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Everything happened so fast. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hail Hydra.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can do this all day.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat is America\u2019s ass.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou trust me?\u201d </i></p><p><b><i>Director Margaret Carter. </i></b></p><p>Suddenly, there was only a thin pane of glass and some blinds separating Steve from the woman he\u2019d once loved. She looked so beautiful and <i>alive.</i> Steve wanted so badly just to touch her again, to kiss her and let her know that he was okay; that he didn\u2019t die that day in \u201945. </p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Steve saw the small gold band on her hand and smiled. <i>She\u2019s happy. </i></p><p>Making sure the coast was clear, he gave her one last glance before slipping back out of her office and out of the building. For fear of being recognized, he hung back when he noticed Tony walking with Howard Stark, only giving him a quick thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cYou got the particles?\u201d Tony asked as the two practically ran away from the army base. </p><p>\u201cOf course, I got the particles.\u201d Steve pulled him into the trees where no one could see them. \u201cYou got the cube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d Tony tapped twice on the briefcase in his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s just go home.\u201d </p><p>Despite having just done it thrice in the past hour, soaring through space and time still gave Steve a slightly queasy feeling. He was relieved to land back in the compound next to Tony and Bruce.</p><p>Bruce looked around. \u201cDid we get them all?\u201d</p><p>Rhodey chuckled, holding up the power stone in its rock. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me this actually worked?\u201d</p><p>Steve noticed when Clint sunk to his knees, pain overcoming his features. </p><p>\u201cClint, where\u2019s Nat?\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Steve had his shield up, protecting himself as Bruce howled in pain. He took a step forward. </p><p>\u201cBruce, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Banner!\u201d Tony took the same step up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, I\u2019m okay.\u201d Bruce hoists his arm up, struggling to snap his fingers. </p><p>There\u2019s a wash of energy over the room and Bruce falls to the floor and the gauntlet falls away. </p><p>\u201cBruce!\u201d Steve drops to his knees next to his friend but holds back from touching him for fear of causing more pain.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move him!\u201d Tony quickly iced Bruce\u2019s burnt arm. Bruce held tight to Steve\u2019s arm. </p><p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d </p><p>Thor was on his other side. \u201cWorth a shot. It\u2019s over. It\u2019s okay.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Scott called from where he was standing at the window. \u201cI think it worked.\u201d </p><p>Bruce opened his eyes in relief, smiling. That smile was gone in a split second when he saw the array of missiles fired at the compound.</p><p><i>CRASH!</i></p><p>For a split second, Steve felt like he\u2019d been hit by a bus. Every muscle and every bone in his body ached. </p><p>\u201cCome on buddy. Wake up.\u201d </p><p>Steve gasped as his eye flew open. Tony was standing over his, looking worse for wear and holding his shield. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my man. You lose this again, I\u2019m keeping it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Steve groaned as he stood and took the metal disk. </p><p>\u201cYou mess with time; it tends to mess back. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>The two made their way through the rubble to where Thor was staring at a sitting Thanos.</p><p><i>How is that possible? </i>Steve thought angrily. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he been doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the stones?\u201d Steve strapped his shield to his arm tightly, standing up just a bit straighter. </p><p>Tony motioned to the mess. \u201cSomewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn\u2019t have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we keep it that way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know this is a trap, right?\u201d</p><p>Tony never took his eyes off the titan. \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t much care.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood. Just as long as we\u2019re all in agreement.\u201d Thor took a deep breath and held out both his hands. The rumble of lightning was heard, and it struck him, delivering both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir and materializing his armor. \u201cLet\u2019s kill him properly this time.\u201d </p><p>\u2013</p><p>You could feel as every fiber of your being was stitched back together. Everything was moving excruciatingly slow, but finally, after what felt like an eternity, you were on your feet in the fields of Wakanda. You ignored the ache in your muscles as you start walking around, watching everyone pick themselves up. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d You turned to Bucky, who was observing the grounds just as you were. \u201cWhere\u2019s Steve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You tapped the communicator in your ear. \u201cSteve? Tony? Can anybody hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d Sam was lying on his back, wings extended. You held out a hand to help him to his feet. \u201cI hate to be the one to say it, but I\u2019m pretty sure we died.\u201d </p><p>King T\u2019Challa stood next to you. \u201cI think he is right.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen that begs the question. How the hell are we alive now?\u201d </p><p>Your mask materialized over your head. \u201cT.A.D.A.S.H.I., call Tony.\u201d </p><p>There were a million things happening in front of your eyes, but you focused on the top corner where your A.I. was searching. \u201cMadam, it would appear as though F.R.I.D.A.Y. just sent out a distress signal. The War Machine suit sent out the same signal. Shall I respond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are outside the compound in New York. It seems there\u2019s been some kind of explosion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to New York!\u201d You rushed, mask disappearing. </p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d You turned to where Bucky was pointing. There were gold spark floating mid-air, and they were popping up all over the field. Slowly, you moved towards the one closest to you as it expanded. Your gun was drawn when a guy popped his head through. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cMy name is Doctor Steven Strange. I\u2019m, for lack of a better term, a wizard. Right now, Thanos is about to kill your friend, Captain Rogers. Any more questions.\u201d</p><p>You gave him an incredulous expression. \u201cWhy should we trust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you being serious right now?\u201d You nodded. The portal expanded ever further and there, standing next to him was Peter.</p><p>\u201cKid!\u201d You rushed through, wrapping your arms around him in relief. \u201cYou\u2019re okay!\u201d <br>\nHe hugged you back. \u201cI mean, technically I\u2019m in space, but sure I\u2019m okay. Although the wizard says that Mr. Stark is in a lot of trouble right now so we should probably go help him.\u201d </p><p>You held onto him for just a second longer before releasing and turning back to Dr. Strange. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d </p><p>You watched in shock and disbelief as all of the portals in Wakanda expanded and Strange\u2019s head ducked into them to give the same spiel. There was a crackle on your communicator and suddenly the destination on the other side of the portal wasn\u2019t Wakanda, but rather the destroyed building where Steve was facing Thanos <i>alone.</i></p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d you muttered fondly. Turning back to Peter, you spoke quickly. \u201cWhen we get out there, you stay close to me. I cannot \u2013 I repeat, <i>cannot </i>\u2013 lose you again. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d He gave you a weary smile and a thumbs up. </p><p>\u201cCap, do you copy?\u201d Sam\u2019s voice was clear. \u201cCap, can you hear me? On your left.\u201d </p><p>Strange expanded all the portals and Steve watched as everyone he could possibly think of stepped out. You waited, giving him a small smile when his eyes finally found yours.</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry, </i>he mouthed. </p><p>You chuckled. <i>I forgive you. </i></p><p>A giant burst through the rubble, Hulk, Rhodey and <i>a raccoon</i> hopping out of his hand. Everyone lined up as Thanos\u2019 army did the same. </p><p>\u201cStay close kid,\u201d you reminded Peter, moving forward. </p><p>\u201cAvengers\u2026\u201d Steve called, holding his hand out. To your shock, and quite honestly <i>arousal, </i>Mjolnir flew into his grip. \u201cAssemble!\u201d </p><p>Your mask was back on and you were charging the battlefield. \u201cT.A.D.A.S.H.I., keep an eye on Pete for me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d A small window popped up on your screen that mirrored what Peter was seeing, caringly labeled <i>\u2018nanny cam protocol.\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cPepper, do you have eyes on Tony?\u201d You called. </p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m a bit preoccupied right now!\u201d </p><p>\u201cPete!\u201d He popped up in front of you. \u201cFind Stark!\u201d </p><p>You shot and stabbed your way through groups of aliens. The wounds you acquired were an afterthought as all of the anger and frustration was finally being released. Before you could think about it, you were fighting next to Steve.</p><p>\u201cFancy running into you here.\u201d You joked, shooting the thing that was running up behind him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>You were about to say it back when he wrapped his arm around you, holding the shield over your heads as shots rained down. </p><p>\u201cThank you, Captain.\u201d You shot around his head. \u201cI love you too.\u201d </p><p>Your happiness was short-lived as you heard Pete call for help. </p><p>\u201cHey Queens, catch!\u201d Steve threw Mjolnir, Peter\u2019s web snagging it and Pepper catching him midair. </p><p>\u201cMadam, the extra legs on the Iron Spider suit have been severely damaged.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d You pulled away from Steve, mask on. \u201cT.A.D.A.S.H.I., take me to him.\u201d </p><p>The raining fire seized, and you ran as fast as you could, killing mindlessly. When you got to him, he was curled up in a ball around the Iron Gauntlet. </p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re okay.\u201d You knelt next to him, suit building a shield on your back. \u201cT.A.D.A.S.H.I., what\u2019s going on? Why did they stop shooting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething has just entered the atmosphere, Madam.\u201d You both looked up to see a glowing light whizzing through the sky and straight through Thanos\u2019 ship.</p><p>\u201cDanvers, we need an assist here.\u201d </p><p>The light came at you fast, blinding you for a minute as she landed on the other side of Peter. He looked to you and then to her. </p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter Parker.\u201d She gave him a warm smile. You have something for me?\u201d</p><p>You helped him to his feet, and he handed off the Gauntlet. \u201cThat\u2019s got to get to that brown van over there.\u201d</p><p>The three of you looked out across the field. Peter\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, exhaustion taking over his features.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to get it through all that though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Okoye stepped up. \u201cShe\u2019s got help.\u201d </p><p>One by one, you were surrounded. Wanda, Shuri, Pepper, a woman on a flying horse, plus a handful of women you\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done, kid!\u201d You said as you marched with them. \u201cStay down!\u201d </p><p>You fought alongside a woman with green skin and red skin, keeping as many aliens away from Peter as you could. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got the stones!\u201d </p><p>You froze, looking up as Thanos fought Carol. <i>Not again. </i></p><p>He knocked her off, securing the gauntlet on his wrist and raising his arm. \u201cI am inevitable.\u201d </p><p>He snapped. </p><p>Nothing happened. <br>\nTony was kneeling in front of him. Raising his right arm, he gave Thanos a smirk. \u201cAnd I. Am. Iron. Man.\u201d </p><p>Thanos\u2019 army began decimating. The aliens advancing all turned to dust just before they could reach you. Your heart blossomed with relief. <i>It\u2019s over. </i></p><p>\u201cMadam.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is it, T.A.D.A.S.H.I.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark\u2019s vitals are dropping rapidly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d You rushed to him, Peter hot on your trail. </p><p>Steve caught you before you could kneel next to him. There were tears in your eyes as you processed his burnt arm and pale skin. You turned, crying into Steve\u2019s shoulder at the sound of Peter\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, we did it. We won and you did it, sir. I\u2019m sorry. Tony.\u201d </p><p>You forced yourself to pull it together, wiping your eyes quickly and pulling him close to you.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be okay,\u201d Pepper whispered. \u201cYou can rest now.\u201d </p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>\u201cEverybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn\u2019t always roll that way. Maybe this time. I\u2019m hoping if you play this back\u2026 it\u2019s in celebration. I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back, in somewhat like a normal version of the planet has been restored, if there ever was such a thing. God, what a world. Universe now. If you told me 10 years ago that we weren\u2019t alone, let alone you know to this extent\u2026 I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised. But come on, you know. That epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And for better or worse, that\u2019s the reality Morgan\u2019s going to find a way to grow up in. So, I found a private area to record a little greeting in case of an untimely death on my part. Not that death at any time is ever timely. This time travel thing that we are going to pull off tomorrow\u2026 it\u2019s got me scratching my head about the survivability of all this. But then again that\u2019s the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. What am I tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it\u2019s supposed to.\u201d</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s hologram rose from the chair he was on and bent over, meeting his daughter\u2019s terrified eyes. <i>\u201cI love you 3000.\u201d</i></p><p>You couldn\u2019t help the tears that streamed down your face as the message ended. Steve rubbed a comforting hand over your arm, holding you close as a few tears of his own rolled down his cheeks. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get some air.\u201d You whispered to him, slipping out of his arms. You were careful not to make any not any noise as you stepped outside and took a deep breath. The lake provided a nice layer of background noise, allowing you to sit on the front steps and cry freely. \u00a0</p><p>You didn\u2019t notice when Steve came out and sat next to you.</p><p>\u201cThey were the best of us,\u201d he said softly. </p><p>You nodded, leaning into him. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. All Nat and Tony needed was a good family. They finally got that and Thanos just snatched it away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, if I\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You cut him off with a sad smile. \u201cIf you\u2019d gone up there with her, you would have jumped. Without a second thought.\u201d</p><p>You reached up and stroked his cheek. \u201cYour overwhelming amount of love for others is why I fell in love with you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what happened all those years ago.\u201d He bowed his head in shame. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking straight. I should have just listened to Tony, but I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t beat yourself up for that anymore, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Peggy.\u201d You pulled away from him in confusion. \u201cWhen Tony and I were trying to get the Tesseract in the seventies. I was hiding out and saw her through a window. She had on a wedding ring and as soon as I saw I knew. We were never meant to be together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Thanos\u2019 first attack, I\u2019ve been thinking about destiny and fate and what it all really means. I thought that Peggy was the love of my life in \u201945 and when I woke up, I thought that fate was just playing some cruel game with me. Then I met you and I thought, \u2018Is destiny giving me another chance?\u2019 Of course, I blew it with the Accords, but going back and seeing her married and running SHIELD, it made me realize that even though I loved her and always will, you are my destiny. You always have been. I don\u2019t want to go back and try to fit myself into the life I assumed I\u2019d have. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Build a house, start a family, grow old together. I thought I wanted all of that with her but seeing her just made me realize that I want it with you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSteve, I\u2014\u201d </p><p>He cut you off quickly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me an answer now. I love you and I will wait for as long as you need me to.\u201d</p><p>You searched his eyes for any sign of insincerity or doubt, but there was none. Smiling, you leaned in to peck his lips. </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you like 105? Can you even still have kids?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, pulling you as close as possible. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d </p><p><b><i>the end. </i></b></p></p>",

It was just a dream. </i></p><p>His heart was beating too fast to even consider going back to sleep. It&rsquo;d been three weeks since he&rsquo;d watched you fade away, along with half of everyone else on Earth. He couldn&rsquo;t cry anymore, couldn&rsquo;t physically create tears after what had happened. Nothing hurt worse than watching you die right in front of him. There was nothing he could do about it then and nothing he could now. And that killed him inside. </p><p>He glanced over at the clock. <b><i>4:15AM. </i></b>No one else in the compound would possibly be up right now.</p><p>Tossing the blanket from his body, Steve made quick work of getting up and changing into a new shirt. Heading down to the kitchen, he was surprised to find Natasha standing there eating a sandwich. She looked exhausted. <br />\n&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t sleep?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head. &ldquo;Bad dreams. You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Same.&rdquo; Nat let out a deep breath. &ldquo;Carol&rsquo;s still out there looking for Tony. She hasn&rsquo;t checked in in days.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll find him.&rdquo; Steve poured himself a glass of water, sipping slowly. </p><p>&ldquo;Steve, she&rsquo;s been out there for weeks. We should prepare for &ndash; &ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it!&rdquo; His fingers tightened around the glass, causing it to crack. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll find him, and he&rsquo;ll know what to do. He&rsquo;ll know how to bring everyone back.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha stared at her friend, tears welling in her eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get her back, Steve.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I sure hope so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Everything reminded him of you. Not a day went by when you didn&rsquo;t occupy at least ninety percent of Steve&rsquo;s thoughts. Some days, he missed you so much, he couldn&rsquo;t physically move. </p><p>He left the compound six months after the snap, going back to the apartment he&rsquo;d had before you. All pictures of you were kept in a box at the foot of his closet; all except one. That one stayed in his wallet, although after a few years it had started fading, so he tried not to pull it out as much. </p><p>It got easier after a while. Day by day, month by month, it hurt just a touch less. Eventually it got to the point where he remembered you with only a dull ache in his heart. He never forgave himself though, never stopped blaming your death on his own failure. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pulling your punches, Grimith.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve swung at the CIA agent in front of him and she ducked, landing a right hook into his abdomen. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better. Follow through.&rdquo; She swung again, hitting his hand pads a few times before kicking one of his legs, forcing him to kneel. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; She rushed, kneeling next to him as he grimaced in pain. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Apologize.&rdquo; He took a deep breath, rising and offering her a hand. &ldquo;Combat isn&rsquo;t a fair trade off of blows. You see an opening, you take it.&rdquo; </p><p>His alarm went off, alerting him that he had half an hour to get to his next appointment. &ldquo;Same time next week?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; She started slowly as Steve held open the rope for her to climb out of the ring. &ldquo;We could always talk outside of training. Perhaps over dinner or drinks?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve froze. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time one of his trainees had expressed interest in him. </p><p>He gave Grimith a soft smile. &ldquo;Thanks, but I try not to mix my personal life with my professional life.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; He could hear the slight sting of rejection in her voice. &ldquo;Same time next week, Captain.&rdquo; </p><p>He quickly unwrapped his hands, stripped and hopped into one of the gym&rsquo;s showers. The hot water was soothing over his aching muscles. The gym had become like a second home to him. He threw himself in working out and training others; took his mind off the rest of the world. He felt bad for lying to Grimith, but he wasn&rsquo;t fully ready to try and start something new. He wasn&rsquo;t ready to move on from you. </p><p>Twenty minutes later, Steve was completely cleaned and across the street, setting up donuts and coffee for his group counseling session. People started trickling in slowly, and within just a few minutes, all of the seats were filled. </p><p>&ldquo;Good evening, everyone.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Good evening.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does anyone want to start us off?&rdquo; </p><p>There was a thick silence as everyone looked around at each other.</p><p>&ldquo;What about you Steve?&rdquo; The man to his left, Anthony, asked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been coming to these meetings every week for the past year and a half, yet no one&rsquo;s heard your side of the story.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve looked around, everyone seeming to be in agreeance. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He crossed his arms over his chest, leaning back in his seat. &ldquo;In 1945, I met a woman named Peggy Carter. She was amazing. Beautiful, smart, tough as all hell. But I laid down my life for my country and in doing so, secured the fact that we would never have a future together. When I was recovered and woke up in 2012, she was still alive, but she&rsquo;d moved on. Got married, had children. She lived a full life and encouraged me to move on and do the same.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve&rsquo;s throat was getting tight, but he pushed on. &ldquo;I never planned on falling in love after Peggy. I was okay with just defending the world until I died. Then, two years later, I met Y/N and my whole world changed completely. As cheesy as it may sound, she turned my whole life around. I wasn&rsquo;t just fighting to make the world a better place. I was fighting to make the world better <i>for her. </i>Everything I did was for her at that point. But I screwed it up when I became a fugitive in 2016. I thought I was protecting her when I left, but I&rsquo;d just unknowingly pushed her closer to danger.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve stopped, willing himself to not cry. Anthony gave him a comforting pat on the arm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a safe space, Steve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Steve took a deep breath. &ldquo;She fought next to me in the Battle of Wakanda. We had an agreement; She wasn&rsquo;t supposed to die, and I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to let her die. Thanos&rsquo; snap didn&rsquo;t care about our agreement. She dusted right in front of me, and because of her enhancements, she felt it the whole damn time.&rdquo;</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t help the tears at that point. &ldquo;I keep wondering to myself, if I hadn&rsquo;t let her, if she hadn&rsquo;t been out there with me, would she still be here today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think like that Steve.&rdquo; The woman across from him held out a box of tissues, which he took graciously. &ldquo;You said it yourself, Thanos wiped out half of all life <i>at random.</i> There&rsquo;s no way of knowing if any of our choices had any influence on what happened. All we can do is move forward and figure out our lives one day at a time.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve nodded. &ldquo;She was a better person than I was. Compassionate, loving. Now, I&rsquo;m just hoping to live a life that she&rsquo;d be proud of.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure she would be.&rdquo; Steve looked over at Anthony. &ldquo;You make a noble living, teaching self-defense at the gym. You never hesitate to help out those in need. You&rsquo;re a good soldier, Steve, but more than that, you&rsquo;re a good man.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Steve quickly pulled himself together. &ldquo;Anyone else want the spotlight?&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone shook their heads. &ldquo;Then I guess we&rsquo;ll call it a night. Of course, I&rsquo;ll be here next Wednesday night at six if anyone thinks they still need help.&rdquo; </p><p>There was a buzz of conversation as everyone got up to leave, saying their goodbyes. Steve made quick work of cleaning up, folding chairs and sweeping just to make the janitors&rsquo; job a little easier.</p><p>Returning to his apartment, Steve pulled down the box of pictures and sat on the bed to look through them. With every photo, his smile grew. <i>You sleeping, you hiding from his camera, the two of you kissing in front of the Eiffel Tower. </i>He didn&rsquo;t notice that he&rsquo;d been crying again until a tear hit the laminated paper.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Every week, Steve&rsquo;s life continued like that. Training five days a week, counseling every Wednesday, distracting himself with mindless work like repairing his bike. Day in and day out, Steve kept himself busy, kept himself moving to try and keep himself from giving up. </p><p>There was one week though that threw him off. Something just felt <i>wrong, </i>so after that Wednesday&rsquo;s meeting, he took a detour and found himself at the old Avenger&rsquo;s compound.</p><p>Natasha sat in front of a miserable peanut butter sandwich, tears rolling down her cheeks as she tried not to have a full meltdown. </p><p>Steve propped himself against a bookshelf and looked at her with a heavy heart, &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;d offer to cook you dinner, but you seem pretty miserable already.&rdquo; </p><p>Nat looked up with a small smile. &ldquo;You hear to do your laundry?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;And to see a friend.&rdquo; </p><p>Talking to Nat was so comforting to Steve, a comfort he hadn&rsquo;t allowed himself to indulge in for years. It reminded him of simpler times, easier times when his biggest issue was an army of artificially intelligent robots. He was so caught up with her that he was genuinely startled when Scott Lang popped up on the security cameras.</p><p>Steve was on his feet in a second. &ldquo;Is this an old message?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the front door.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Everything was happening so fast; Steve almost couldn&rsquo;t process it all. One minute, Tony was slamming the door in his face, telling him that time travel was impossible. The next, he was being fitted for a suit that would be compatible with the Quantum Realm. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you design her suits?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked up from his sketches to where Steve was redressing himself. &ldquo;The last one. She didn&rsquo;t like my first designs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What was wrong with them?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony chuckled, pausing what he was doing to pull up a holographic closet. Suddenly, Steve was surrounded by suits that were all roughly your size. He immediately saw the issue. &ldquo;These look the suits you&rsquo;ve designed for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Every single hologram had an almost exact replica of a suit Steve had worn. The designs were all mostly the same, red and white stripes wrapped around the torso with a giant start in the middle of the chest. <br />\n&ldquo;If she had worn these, she would have looked like me.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony picked up the pain in his friends&rsquo; voice. With a sigh, he turned off the projection. &ldquo;Y/N didn&rsquo;t want the world to think she was trying to be a new you. The world already had a Captain America. She just wanted to help people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She died thinking that I&rsquo;d abandoned her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then when we bring her back, I&rsquo;d suggest you inform her otherwise.&rdquo; Tony tossed something at Steve, which he caught easily. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the key to her room. You might want to take a look inside.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve looked with confusion between the key and Tony a few times before quickly making his way to the elevator. It was only one floor and he knew he probably would have moved faster on the stairs, but he needed the time to calm the beating of his heart. Although it was still racing by when he got to your door. </p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t prepared for what he saw when he stepped inside. At first glance, your room was plain. Grey curtains, black sheets, not much personalization at all. When he stepped in and shut the door, he noticed the giant world map all marked up with pins and yarn. There were clusters of headlines and grainy images of him scattered everywhere, with your trail stopping abruptly in the UK. </p><p>Steve couldn&rsquo;t help by laugh to himself. &ldquo;Oh baby, you were so close.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve&rsquo;s urge to fight was renewed as he opened your nightstand drawer and found a framed photo of the two of you. For the past five years, he&rsquo;d always just assumed that you&rsquo;d gotten rid of any trace of your relationship. Not once did he consider that you might not have completely moved on. </p><p>He slept in your bed that night. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>This is going to work, Rogers. You&rsquo;ll get her back. You&rsquo;ll get everyone back. </i>Steve&rsquo;s heart was racing as he made his way up onto the time machine. </p><p> &ldquo;Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams; you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we&rsquo;re going to win. Whatever it takes. Good luck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s pretty good at that.&rdquo; Rocket whispered. </p><p>Scott raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;I know right.&rdquo;</p><p>Nat gave Steve a giddy, almost childlike smile. &ldquo;See you in a minute.&rdquo; </p><p>And just like that, they were off.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Everything happened so fast. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Hail Hydra.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I can do this all day.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That is America&rsquo;s ass.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You trust me?&rdquo; </i></p><p><b><i>Director Margaret Carter. </i></b></p><p>Suddenly, there was only a thin pane of glass and some blinds separating Steve from the woman he&rsquo;d once loved. She looked so beautiful and <i>alive.</i> Steve wanted so badly just to touch her again, to kiss her and let her know that he was okay; that he didn&rsquo;t die that day in &rsquo;45. </p><p>But he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Steve saw the small gold band on her hand and smiled. <i>She&rsquo;s happy. </i></p><p>Making sure the coast was clear, he gave her one last glance before slipping back out of her office and out of the building. For fear of being recognized, he hung back when he noticed Tony walking with Howard Stark, only giving him a quick thumbs up.</p><p>&ldquo;You got the particles?&rdquo; Tony asked as the two practically ran away from the army base. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course, I got the particles.&rdquo; Steve pulled him into the trees where no one could see them. &ldquo;You got the cube?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think this means?&rdquo; Tony tapped twice on the briefcase in his hands. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just go home.&rdquo; </p><p>Despite having just done it thrice in the past hour, soaring through space and time still gave Steve a slightly queasy feeling. He was relieved to land back in the compound next to Tony and Bruce.</p><p>Bruce looked around. &ldquo;Did we get them all?&rdquo;</p><p>Rhodey chuckled, holding up the power stone in its rock. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me this actually worked?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve noticed when Clint sunk to his knees, pain overcoming his features. </p><p>&ldquo;Clint, where&rsquo;s Nat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Steve had his shield up, protecting himself as Bruce howled in pain. He took a step forward. </p><p>&ldquo;Bruce, are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Talk to me, Banner!&rdquo; Tony took the same step up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay, I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo; Bruce hoists his arm up, struggling to snap his fingers. </p><p>There&rsquo;s a wash of energy over the room and Bruce falls to the floor and the gauntlet falls away. </p><p>&ldquo;Bruce!&rdquo; Steve drops to his knees next to his friend but holds back from touching him for fear of causing more pain.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move him!&rdquo; Tony quickly iced Bruce&rsquo;s burnt arm. Bruce held tight to Steve&rsquo;s arm. </p><p>&ldquo;Did it work?&rdquo; </p><p>Thor was on his other side. &ldquo;Worth a shot. It&rsquo;s over. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Guys,&rdquo; Scott called from where he was standing at the window. &ldquo;I think it worked.&rdquo; </p><p>Bruce opened his eyes in relief, smiling. That smile was gone in a split second when he saw the array of missiles fired at the compound.</p><p><i>CRASH!</i></p><p>For a split second, Steve felt like he&rsquo;d been hit by a bus. Every muscle and every bone in his body ached. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on buddy. Wake up.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve gasped as his eye flew open. Tony was standing over his, looking worse for wear and holding his shield. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my man. You lose this again, I&rsquo;m keeping it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Steve groaned as he stood and took the metal disk. </p><p>&ldquo;You mess with time; it tends to mess back. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p><p>The two made their way through the rubble to where Thor was staring at a sitting Thanos.</p><p><i>How is that possible? </i>Steve thought angrily. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he been doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are the stones?&rdquo; Steve strapped his shield to his arm tightly, standing up just a bit straighter. </p><p>Tony motioned to the mess. &ldquo;Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn&rsquo;t have them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, we keep it that way.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know this is a trap, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony never took his eyes off the titan. &ldquo;Yeah. I don&rsquo;t much care.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Good. Just as long as we&rsquo;re all in agreement.&rdquo; Thor took a deep breath and held out both his hands. The rumble of lightning was heard, and it struck him, delivering both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir and materializing his armor. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s kill him properly this time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You could feel as every fiber of your being was stitched back together. Everything was moving excruciatingly slow, but finally, after what felt like an eternity, you were on your feet in the fields of Wakanda. You ignored the ache in your muscles as you start walking around, watching everyone pick themselves up. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell happened?&rdquo; You turned to Bucky, who was observing the grounds just as you were. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Steve?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; You tapped the communicator in your ear. &ldquo;Steve? Tony? Can anybody hear me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can.&rdquo; Sam was lying on his back, wings extended. You held out a hand to help him to his feet. &ldquo;I hate to be the one to say it, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure we died.&rdquo; </p><p>King T&rsquo;Challa stood next to you. &ldquo;I think he is right.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Then that begs the question. How the hell are we alive now?&rdquo; </p><p>Your mask materialized over your head. &ldquo;T.A.D.A.S.H.I., call Tony.&rdquo; </p><p>There were a million things happening in front of your eyes, but you focused on the top corner where your A.I. was searching. &ldquo;Madam, it would appear as though F.R.I.D.A.Y. just sent out a distress signal. The War Machine suit sent out the same signal. Shall I respond?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Where are they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are outside the compound in New York. It seems there&rsquo;s been some kind of explosion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to New York!&rdquo; You rushed, mask disappearing. </p><p>&ldquo;Look.&rdquo; You turned to where Bucky was pointing. There were gold spark floating mid-air, and they were popping up all over the field. Slowly, you moved towards the one closest to you as it expanded. Your gun was drawn when a guy popped his head through. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>He rolled his eyes. &ldquo;My name is Doctor Steven Strange. I&rsquo;m, for lack of a better term, a wizard. Right now, Thanos is about to kill your friend, Captain Rogers. Any more questions.&rdquo;</p><p>You gave him an incredulous expression. &ldquo;Why should we trust you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you being serious right now?&rdquo; You nodded. The portal expanded ever further and there, standing next to him was Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid!&rdquo; You rushed through, wrapping your arms around him in relief. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay!&rdquo; <br />\nHe hugged you back. &ldquo;I mean, technically I&rsquo;m in space, but sure I&rsquo;m okay. Although the wizard says that Mr. Stark is in a lot of trouble right now so we should probably go help him.&rdquo; </p><p>You held onto him for just a second longer before releasing and turning back to Dr. Strange. &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; </p><p>You watched in shock and disbelief as all of the portals in Wakanda expanded and Strange&rsquo;s head ducked into them to give the same spiel. There was a crackle on your communicator and suddenly the destination on the other side of the portal wasn&rsquo;t Wakanda, but rather the destroyed building where Steve was facing Thanos <i>alone.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Idiot,&rdquo; you muttered fondly. Turning back to Peter, you spoke quickly. &ldquo;When we get out there, you stay close to me. I cannot &ndash; I repeat, <i>cannot </i>&ndash; lose you again. Got it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo; He gave you a weary smile and a thumbs up. </p><p>&ldquo;Cap, do you copy?&rdquo; Sam&rsquo;s voice was clear. &ldquo;Cap, can you hear me? On your left.&rdquo; </p><p>Strange expanded all the portals and Steve watched as everyone he could possibly think of stepped out. You waited, giving him a small smile when his eyes finally found yours.</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m sorry, </i>he mouthed. </p><p>You chuckled. <i>I forgive you. </i></p><p>A giant burst through the rubble, Hulk, Rhodey and <i>a raccoon</i> hopping out of his hand. Everyone lined up as Thanos&rsquo; army did the same. </p><p>&ldquo;Stay close kid,&rdquo; you reminded Peter, moving forward. </p><p>&ldquo;Avengers&hellip;&rdquo; Steve called, holding his hand out. To your shock, and quite honestly <i>arousal, </i>Mjolnir flew into his grip. &ldquo;Assemble!&rdquo; </p><p>Your mask was back on and you were charging the battlefield. &ldquo;T.A.D.A.S.H.I., keep an eye on Pete for me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; A small window popped up on your screen that mirrored what Peter was seeing, caringly labeled <i>&lsquo;nanny cam protocol.&rsquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Pepper, do you have eyes on Tony?&rdquo; You called. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but I&rsquo;m a bit preoccupied right now!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Pete!&rdquo; He popped up in front of you. &ldquo;Find Stark!&rdquo; </p><p>You shot and stabbed your way through groups of aliens. The wounds you acquired were an afterthought as all of the anger and frustration was finally being released. Before you could think about it, you were fighting next to Steve.</p><p>&ldquo;Fancy running into you here.&rdquo; You joked, shooting the thing that was running up behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to see you.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>You were about to say it back when he wrapped his arm around you, holding the shield over your heads as shots rained down. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Captain.&rdquo; You shot around his head. &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; </p><p>Your happiness was short-lived as you heard Pete call for help. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Queens, catch!&rdquo; Steve threw Mjolnir, Peter&rsquo;s web snagging it and Pepper catching him midair. </p><p>&ldquo;Madam, the extra legs on the Iron Spider suit have been severely damaged.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; You pulled away from Steve, mask on. &ldquo;T.A.D.A.S.H.I., take me to him.&rdquo; </p><p>The raining fire seized, and you ran as fast as you could, killing mindlessly. When you got to him, he was curled up in a ball around the Iron Gauntlet. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo; You knelt next to him, suit building a shield on your back. &ldquo;T.A.D.A.S.H.I., what&rsquo;s going on? Why did they stop shooting?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something has just entered the atmosphere, Madam.&rdquo; You both looked up to see a glowing light whizzing through the sky and straight through Thanos&rsquo; ship.</p><p>&ldquo;Danvers, we need an assist here.&rdquo; </p><p>The light came at you fast, blinding you for a minute as she landed on the other side of Peter. He looked to you and then to her. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi. I&rsquo;m Peter Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Peter Parker.&rdquo; She gave him a warm smile. You have something for me?&rdquo;</p><p>You helped him to his feet, and he handed off the Gauntlet. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s got to get to that brown van over there.&rdquo;</p><p>The three of you looked out across the field. Peter&rsquo;s eyes were bloodshot, exhaustion taking over his features.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re going to get it through all that though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; Okoye stepped up. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got help.&rdquo; </p><p>One by one, you were surrounded. Wanda, Shuri, Pepper, a woman on a flying horse, plus a handful of women you&rsquo;d never seen before.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re done, kid!&rdquo; You said as you marched with them. &ldquo;Stay down!&rdquo; </p><p>You fought alongside a woman with green skin and red skin, keeping as many aliens away from Peter as you could. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the stones!&rdquo; </p><p>You froze, looking up as Thanos fought Carol. <i>Not again. </i></p><p>He knocked her off, securing the gauntlet on his wrist and raising his arm. &ldquo;I am inevitable.&rdquo; </p><p>He snapped. </p><p>Nothing happened. <br />\nTony was kneeling in front of him. Raising his right arm, he gave Thanos a smirk. &ldquo;And I. Am. Iron. Man.&rdquo; </p><p>Thanos&rsquo; army began decimating. The aliens advancing all turned to dust just before they could reach you. Your heart blossomed with relief. <i>It&rsquo;s over. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Madam.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What is it, T.A.D.A.S.H.I.?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark&rsquo;s vitals are dropping rapidly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; You rushed to him, Peter hot on your trail. </p><p>Steve caught you before you could kneel next to him. There were tears in your eyes as you processed his burnt arm and pale skin. You turned, crying into Steve&rsquo;s shoulder at the sound of Peter&rsquo;s voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, we did it. We won and you did it, sir. I&rsquo;m sorry. Tony.&rdquo; </p><p>You forced yourself to pull it together, wiping your eyes quickly and pulling him close to you.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna be okay,&rdquo; Pepper whispered. &ldquo;You can rest now.&rdquo; </p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Everybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn&rsquo;t always roll that way. Maybe this time. I&rsquo;m hoping if you play this back&hellip; it&rsquo;s in celebration. I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back, in somewhat like a normal version of the planet has been restored, if there ever was such a thing. God, what a world. Universe now. If you told me 10 years ago that we weren&rsquo;t alone, let alone you know to this extent&hellip; I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised. But come on, you know. That epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And for better or worse, that&rsquo;s the reality Morgan&rsquo;s going to find a way to grow up in. So, I found a private area to record a little greeting in case of an untimely death on my part. Not that death at any time is ever timely. This time travel thing that we are going to pull off tomorrow&hellip; it&rsquo;s got me scratching my head about the survivability of all this. But then again that&rsquo;s the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. What am I tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it&rsquo;s supposed to.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Tony&rsquo;s hologram rose from the chair he was on and bent over, meeting his daughter&rsquo;s terrified eyes. <i>&ldquo;I love you 3000.&rdquo;</i></p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help the tears that streamed down your face as the message ended. Steve rubbed a comforting hand over your arm, holding you close as a few tears of his own rolled down his cheeks. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get some air.&rdquo; You whispered to him, slipping out of his arms. You were careful not to make any not any noise as you stepped outside and took a deep breath. The lake provided a nice layer of background noise, allowing you to sit on the front steps and cry freely. &nbsp;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t notice when Steve came out and sat next to you.</p><p>&ldquo;They were the best of us,&rdquo; he said softly. </p><p>You nodded, leaning into him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair. All Nat and Tony needed was a good family. They finally got that and Thanos just snatched it away.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, if I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; You cut him off with a sad smile. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d gone up there with her, you would have jumped. Without a second thought.&rdquo;</p><p>You reached up and stroked his cheek. &ldquo;Your overwhelming amount of love for others is why I fell in love with you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry for what happened all those years ago.&rdquo; He bowed his head in shame. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking straight. I should have just listened to Tony, but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t beat yourself up for that anymore, Steve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I saw Peggy.&rdquo; You pulled away from him in confusion. &ldquo;When Tony and I were trying to get the Tesseract in the seventies. I was hiding out and saw her through a window. She had on a wedding ring and as soon as I saw I knew. We were never meant to be together.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Since Thanos&rsquo; first attack, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about destiny and fate and what it all really means. I thought that Peggy was the love of my life in &rsquo;45 and when I woke up, I thought that fate was just playing some cruel game with me. Then I met you and I thought, &lsquo;Is destiny giving me another chance?&rsquo; Of course, I blew it with the Accords, but going back and seeing her married and running SHIELD, it made me realize that even though I loved her and always will, you are my destiny. You always have been. I don&rsquo;t want to go back and try to fit myself into the life I assumed I&rsquo;d have. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Build a house, start a family, grow old together. I thought I wanted all of that with her but seeing her just made me realize that I want it with you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Steve, I&mdash;&rdquo; </p><p>He cut you off quickly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to give me an answer now. I love you and I will wait for as long as you need me to.&rdquo;</p><p>You searched his eyes for any sign of insincerity or doubt, but there was none. Smiling, you leaned in to peck his lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you like 105? Can you even still have kids?&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed, pulling you as close as possible. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo; </p><p><b><i>the end. </i></b></p></p>",
