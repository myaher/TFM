                "content": "<p>okay now i have to rant about slytherin!bakugou, the true evil here</p><p>bakugou katsuki is in absolutely no ways a slytherin. i feel so embarrassed when i see people insisting that because&nbsp;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s the bad guy&rdquo; that he&rsquo;s a slytherin.&nbsp;</p><p>let&rsquo;s break it down with some bullet points:</p><ul><li><i>bakugou is not the bad guy. </i>he and deku have a challenging and complicated history, but <i>he is not the bad guy.</i> he is quite literally the deuteragonist of the story, dammit! he is experiencing character growth! he&rsquo;s conflicted on the inside and lashing out due to his variety of complexes. okay i won&rsquo;t turn this into a meta on bakugou&rsquo;s mental state but oh my <i>god</i> y&rsquo;all&hellip;<br /></li><li>okay, say it with me everyone: <i>Slytherins Are Not Inherently Evil.</i> most of the notorious villains tend to be slytherins, not because all slytherins are evil, but because becoming a villain requires a certain amount of cunning, which is slytherin&rsquo;s defining trait. i have a comparison to explain why slytherins =/= evil. most serial killers come from some kind of fucked up background, whether it be a broken home, abuse, mental illness, etc. however, you would never say that anyone dealing with these issues are automatically serial killers, because that&rsquo;s <i>stupid</i>, <i>irresponsible</i>, and <i>vastly misunderstanding the natures of both groups your talking about</i>. the same applies to slytherins and villains.<br /></li><li>bakugou is SO lawful. he can&rsquo;t talk back to teachers (and we all know he&rsquo;s a lil asshole who talks back to everyone lmao), he yells at his friends (posse?) in middle school to stop smoking so it doesn&rsquo;t damage his record if they&rsquo;re caught, and he does well in school not even just naturally, but he studies a ton. he&rsquo;s literally one of the most lawful characters in the series aside from, like, <i>iida</i>&hellip; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5wf6ePNXzjEu9ANHYboKSg\" target=\"_blank\">@achryadaiako</a> put it perfectly on <a href=\"https://bakubooms.tumblr.com/post/178721676554/gryffindor-deku-and-slytherin-kacchan-give-me\" target=\"_blank\">this post of mine</a> by saying that,&nbsp;&ldquo;Bakugou is lawful good and no lawful anything character has ever been a slytherin.&rdquo; <b><i>It&rsquo;s True And You Should Say It !!!!!!</i></b></li></ul><p>i also want to add that being a lil rude and standoff-ish doesn&rsquo;t immediately make someone a bad person! there are plenty of assholes-with-a-heart-of-gold characters out there that we all adore, so it&rsquo;s frustrating that people don&rsquo;t afford the same understand that outward actions =/= one&rsquo;s actual character in all cases. this applies doubly, because <i>clearly</i> bakugou is Going Through Some Shit and affects his ability to interact with and relate to others in a way that is immediately recognizable as&nbsp;&ldquo;good,&rdquo; but you only need to do a bit of digging! that&rsquo;s why, despite his history with kacchan, deku still works to get to the root of what&rsquo;s up with kacchan, and damn if he doesn&rsquo;t still consider them friends.</p><p>also i should point out the reason why i feel like a lot of people place him in slytherin other than that he&rsquo;s kind of an asshole:&nbsp;&ldquo;bakugou is super ambitious!&rdquo;</p><p>guess what? that means NOTHING in this scenario. if you&rsquo;re going to place characters into slytherin based solely on the presence of ambition, that Literally Every Character At UA, Every Pro Hero, Etc. Is A Slytherin !!!!! of COURSE bakugou&rsquo;s ambitious: he&rsquo;s a student at UA high school, trying to be a pro hero! all of the students at UA are ambitious! you don&rsquo;t even want to go to UA, let alone get in, unless you&rsquo;re mega-ambitious compared to your average joe.</p><p>ALSO!! it&rsquo;s been established in the canon of hp (which, okay, <i>I know</i>, but just hear me out) that people can have Major Character Traits from multiple houses, and that it&rsquo;s only the strongest traits that actually determine where you get placed. all of the major hp characters in gryffindor are meant to portray other houses, but they wound up in gryffindor because they were more brave than anything else</p><ul><li>harry represents slytherin, through both his literal speaking to snakes, and though lack of shits to give about any rules ever<br /></li><li>hermione represents ravenclaw, because she&rsquo;s extremely smart, both in the traditional understanding, as well as being incredibly intuitive<br /></li><li>ron represents hufflepuff. he&rsquo;s sort of an outsider, even in his own family, because all of his siblings are either popular, smart, successful, etc. he&rsquo;s just the bumbling kid brother. even his little sister ginny is special because she&rsquo;s the only girl! but he&rsquo;s kind, and even if he fights with someone, his loyalty always, <i>always</i> brings him back to those he cares about.</li></ul><p><strike>sorry, i got a lil emotional about ron there</strike><br /></p><p>SO ANYWAY just because bakugou (and literally all the other other characters) are super-ambitious, it doesn&rsquo;t automatically make them into slytherins</p><p>okay i&rsquo;m ending this because i meant it to be just a few short paragraphs, not a whole-ass meta</p>",
