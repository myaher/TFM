It\u2019s not unreasonable, and the show hasn\u2019t really done anything for their relationship like the books have. They need the audience to see this relationship grow, to evolve and go through trials and tests to demonstrate the strength of their bond and how no matter what, they\u2019ll support each other. It\u2019s storytelling, after all. </p><p>It\u2019s easy to forget that most of the GA haven\u2019t actually read the books and don\u2019t really know their history as well.

Like obvi Dany and Jon had sex and that\u2019s like a while thing, but what about after they find out they are related and she is his aunt ? I love Dany and I want her to find her place on the throne but I also love the Starks and I think the North will only follow along with everyone else if a Stark in on the throne in the end because they <span style=\"color: #7c5cff\">loyal af. </span>We already somewhat know that Dany isn\u2019t necessarily against having relationships with women based on season one (she was totally into the girl that was teaching her to please Drogo) and when the Greyjoys pledged their loyalties to her, Yara flirted and somewhat suggested marriage (Dany blushed and didn\u2019t openly object to the idea at least from what I remember); moving on to Sansa, this is just guessing but with her as well, I don\u2019t think we have seen her openly deny the <span class=\"npf_color_niles\">possibility</span> of her having relations with a woman, I know she hasn\u2019t in the past but after all her experiences with men, she might be more open to it then we think ? If this were to happen then there would be a Targaryen and a Stark on the throne, I feel like this would please the audience (to an extent) and defs the North because they love Sansa. Along with this, if this were to happen I would guess that Jon would die but Dany would be pregnant with his child, whom would later become the rightful heir to the throne (with Targaryen and Stark blood) and be raised by Dany and Sansa (a Targaryen and a Stark). As for the Lannisters, I hope Cersei dies but Jamie becomes maybe like Hand to the Queens, and Gindry and Aria live happily ever after as badass mercenaries with ninja assassin babies \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc</p>",

We also examined how the relationship with their respective father (Ned, Jeor, Randyll) and the desire to carry the ancestral sword (Ice, Longclaw, Heartsbane) shaped Jon, Jorah and Sam\u2019s character development and would be another bonding factor between the three sons. It\u2019s highly likely that Sam will bestow his ancestral sword Heartsbane to Jorah. And this act of kindness will boost up Jorah\u2019s morale and motivation to fight for the side of the living, to honor his father, and to pay his debt to Sam.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Bromance or Romance, Family or Khaleesi</b></h2><p>As discussed in<a href=\"https://springwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com/post/183632290108/jorahs-choice-p1\"> part 1</a>, tensions in the North between Dany and the lords would escalate shortly after her arrival while the Dead Army is approaching. Everyone starts to be wary of Dany and her dragons. And to boil up the already messy situation:\u00a0<br/></p><h2># 3 News about Dany roasting the Lannister army and the Tarlys reaches the North</h2><p>One way or the other, the lords will know about how Dany dracarys-ed the Lannister army and forced the survivors to kneel by executing the Tarlys with fire. Most probably from the maesters in Citadel who have been in contact with maester Wolkan in Winterfell. Everyone will be shocked, bad memories of the Mad King and all the terrible Targaryen rulers before him will be recalled and distrust of Dany and her\u00a0\u201cgood will\u201d would grow exponentially.\u00a0</p><p>Imagine what Jorah would think when he knows that his beloved Khaleesi, who always claimed to make the world a better place and free people from oppression, has done this horrible thing to thousands of men, many of them are just innocent commoners who were dragged into someone else\u2019s war.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"215\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1936e7a94b97b04d4280e5f77f5df460/tumblr_ouc6advQZG1snykouo6_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"215\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"215\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/083a2a310dc2bfc4b425de0dc728ae0a/tumblr_ouc6advQZG1snykouo5_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"215\"/></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0\n\n<i><a href=\"http://mockingjaykatniss2.tumblr.com/post/163921542079\">mockingjaykatniss2</a></i>\n\n</p><p>What did he say to Dany when trying to convince her not to order the execution of thousands of masters in Yunkai when they rised against her?</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/376eeadee5c7ac57b4e231b0e6b56e91/tumblr_inline_pozwtduGLT1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p>Moreover, Jorah insisted that if building a better world was what Dany wanted, she had to show people (from both sides) another way, different from the brutality they had always known.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nslaves you freed, brutality is all they&rsquo;ve ever known.

She listened to him in Meereen, but does the exactly the opposite in Westeros, where her opponents are no slavers, making her actions of brutalizing them even worse.

Not to mention what happened in the aftermath, when she continued to threaten the prisoners and executed their generals with dragon fire. To instill fear and force submission. His trust and respect in Dany would gradually deteriorate.\u00a0</p><p>Note that due to his leave to find a cure for himself, Jorah was not present in both scenes where Dany introduced herself as a fierce, merciless warlord. The writers kept him out for a reason. They want to reserve his reactions for a later date when the news and/or the reality would shock him. Jorah would shudder when he knows how brutal Dany has become and he cannot be at ease at all, if Dany plans to keep her word and does exactly the same to the North.</p><p>Like when she gave her rousing speech to the Dothraki about\u00a0\u201ckill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses\u201d&hellip;</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/97c5cf0307ec98e83b126607d0db41b9/tumblr_pdufek3uAg1r3i2gwo1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"270\"/></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"http://yocalio.tumblr.com/post/177259050683\">yocalio</a>\n\n</p><p>&hellip; and the infamous\u00a0\u201cbend the knee or die\u201d&hellip;</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/507ca8add4b8208437c80c7ec9f651c7/tumblr_inline_pp0yusDfYU1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"/></figure><p>Does she sound any more like the compassionate queen who aspired to build a better world for the downtrodden that he once believed in?

Very likely, Sam will confront Dany, question her decision and/ or demand an explanation/ apology from her. I\u2019m not sure if he would take a more reckless action toward Dany, but whatever he does, Sam puts himself in a very dangerous position when he personally confronts the Mother of Dragons.<br/></p><p>When all these chaos happen, Jorah would try to give Dany counsel and calm her down (like he always did).

(Jorah to Missandei, 7x07)</p></blockquote><p>This whole situation will be a hot mess, since lots of people in Winterfell had awful experience and/ or memories with fire fanatics. Jon, Davos, Tormund, Sansa, Arya, Bran, Gendry, Sandor, all the Northern lords, etc. And<b> if Sam is under threat from Dany, who would find themselves responsible to protect him?</b></p><p>Jon, of course, Sam is his best friend.\u00a0</p><p>Bran, very likely, Sam is his companion now.</p><p>Jorah, Sam\u2019s new pal. Wouldn\u2019t be an easy choice for Jorah since he felt he owed his life to Dany (who convinced him to find a cure from greyscale) and Sam (who actually saved him). However, I believe he would not stay still when Sam is in danger.\u00a0</p><p>And don\u2019t forget Gilly. She is very protective of him too. She stood up against Lord Tarly when he harshly criticized Sam when he returned to Horn Hill. She would not let Sam be bullied in front of her.</p><blockquote><p>He\u2019s a greater warrior than either of you would ever be.

There should be a reason. And I\u2019m doubtful the reason is just that she is Sam\u2019s girlfriend and her son is the human brother of the Night King\u2019s White Walkers.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1033\" data-orig-height=\"504\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d996f5c5b8235afc574c71e4ccce72c8/tumblr_inline_pp000w6eo51v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1033\" data-orig-height=\"504\"/></figure><p>Gilly knows, or at least partly knows the truth about Jon\u2019s true parentage.

Or Sam himself would do it.\u00a0</p><p>Which leads to an even bigger mess.\u00a0<br/></p><h2># 4\u00a0 Everyone knows Jon is the heir to the Iron Throne, jeopardizing Dany\u2019s claim</h2><p>\n\nSince Jon\u2019s parentage, Westeros\u2019 biggest secret, would have a huge impact on the plot, I bet it will be revealed to the public in the most dramatic way possible, and at the worst timing possible. It has to burst out when all the tensions and distrusts between various parties present in Winterfell accumulate and peak while the Dead is marching close. Which moment could be worse than that?\u00a0</p><p>\n\n\n\nThe choice each character makes in this critical moment will reveal who they truly are and what they really want: a blindly selfish being or someone with heart and reasons. That\u2019s why I believe all these dramas will happen shortly before the Dead Army reaches Winterfell. \n\nWithin the limit of this post, we would not discuss the impact of Jon\u2019s parentage becoming public knowledge on Jon, the Starklings, the Northen lords and the Lannisters. We focus on Dany, her choice when knowing it, thus affecting Jorah\u2019s choice.\u00a0</p><p>Dany would not take it lightly. For someone who spent her entire existence believing that she\u2019s the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, and that the Iron Throne is hers by right, just to receive the news that she\u2019s behind Jon in the line of succession, that news itself is a killer blow. Sometime before or after Jon\u2019s parentage revelation, Dany will also know about Cersei\u2019s betrayal too, and she will get desperate. She fears she\u2019s losing everything. In the South, Cersei is taking back the lands she conquered. The North does not accept her. And her supposed lover is actually another contender for the Throne (and he does not look like he\u2019s truly in love with her either). She would feel that she has sacrificed everything while gaining nothing. So now she has to face the most difficult choice in her life: Stay or Go. \n\n And so Jorah also has to face the most difficult choice in his life: follow his Queen or stay in the North.</p><p><b>\n\nJon or Dany? His father\u2019s successor or the queen he adored?\n\n</b><br/></p><p>It\u2019s for sure a painful, messy and difficult choice for Jorah. He\u2019s been in love with Dany and protecting her all along, from the time she was a timid princess walking into a forced marriage with Khal Drogo until she becomes the powerful \u201cgoddess\u201d queen of today. He swore to protect her \u2018till his last breath. And I believe, under a different circumstance, if Jorah learns that Jon has hurt or \u201cused\u201d Dany in any sense, he\u2019d kill Jon if he could. \n\n I totally expect that he would confront Jon, they might engage in a heated argument, even a fight probably.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been <b>given the greatest challenges around Dany</b>. He\u2019ll be tested like never before.\u201d (Ian Glenn about Jorah in S8, EW interview)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>But in such very moment, when the Night King is coming close, it\u2019s not about the fight for the Throne any more. It\u2019s about the living and the dead. Jorah was with Jon beyond the Wall and both nearly lost their lives there (I think this is a deliberate choice from the writers for Jon and Jorah both almost died falling). He knows very well what would happen to everyone (including Dany, no matter she stays or leaves) if they don\u2019t band together.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"518\" data-orig-height=\"146\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f2bf959cbb8c517b8b420682173e067/tumblr_inline_pp14m9MoVI1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"518\" data-orig-height=\"146\"/></figure><p>Jon is for sure on the side fighting for the living, as he always insists.\u00a0<br/></p><blockquote><p>There\u2019s only one war that matters.

I guess the writers chose not to include this detail in the show because it would be too revealing that Jorah will end up choose to continue his father\u2019s fight over any other fight. Or they want show!Jorah\u2019s choice of fighting for the living is entirely his, out of the love for his father. However, in any case, the hint to Jorah\u2019s final decision is already there.\u00a0</p><p>To this point, the love and trust Jorah has for Dany has become a wall with numerous cracks. Can it be mended or will it finally tumble down?

It has to burst out when all the tensions and distrusts between various parties present in Winterfell accumulate and peak while the Dead is marching close. Which moment could be worse than that?\u00a0</p><p>\n\n\n\nThe choice each character makes in this critical moment will reveal who they truly are and what they really want: a blindly selfish being or someone with heart and reasons. That\u2019s why I believe all these dramas will happen shortly before the Dead Army reaches Winterfell. \n\nWithin the limit of this post, we would not discuss the impact of Jon\u2019s parentage becoming public knowledge on Jon, the Starklings, the Northen lords and the Lannisters. We focus on Dany, her choice when knowing it, thus affecting Jorah\u2019s choice.\u00a0</p><p>Dany would not take it lightly. For someone who spent her entire existence believing that she\u2019s the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, and that the Iron Throne is hers by right, just to receive the news that she\u2019s behind Jon in the line of succession, that news itself is a killer blow. Sometime before or after Jon\u2019s parentage revelation, Dany will also know about Cersei\u2019s betrayal too, and she will get desperate. She fears she\u2019s losing everything. In the South, Cersei is taking back the lands she conquered. The North does not accept her. And her supposed lover is actually another contender for the Throne (and he does not look like he\u2019s truly in love with her either). She would feel that she has sacrificed everything while gaining nothing. So now she has to face the most difficult choice in her life: Stay or Go. \n\n And so Jorah also has to face the most difficult choice in his life: follow his Queen or stay in the North.</p><p><b>\n\nJon or Dany? His father\u2019s successor or the queen he adored?\n\n</b><br></p><p>It\u2019s for sure a painful, messy and difficult choice for Jorah. He\u2019s been in love with Dany and protecting her all along, from the time she was a timid princess walking into a forced marriage with Khal Drogo until she becomes the powerful \u201cgoddess\u201d queen of today. He swore to protect her \u2018till his last breath. And I believe, under a different circumstance, if Jorah learns that Jon has hurt or \u201cused\u201d Dany in any sense, he\u2019d kill Jon if he could. \n\n I totally expect that he would confront Jon, they might engage in a heated argument, even a fight probably.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been <b>given the greatest challenges around Dany</b>. He\u2019ll be tested like never before.\u201d (Ian Glenn about Jorah in S8, EW interview)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>But in such very moment, when the Night King is coming close, it\u2019s not about the fight for the Throne any more. It\u2019s about the living and the dead. Jorah was with Jon beyond the Wall and both nearly lost their lives there (I think this is a deliberate choice from the writers for Jon and Jorah both almost died falling). He knows very well what would happen to everyone (including Dany, no matter she stays or leaves) if they don\u2019t band together.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"518\" data-orig-height=\"146\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f2bf959cbb8c517b8b420682173e067/tumblr_inline_pp14m9MoVI1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"518\" data-orig-height=\"146\"></figure><p>Jon is for sure on the side fighting for the living, as he always insists.\u00a0<br></p><blockquote><p>There\u2019s only one war that matters.

I guess the writers chose not to include this detail in the show because it would be too revealing that Jorah will end up choose to continue his father\u2019s fight over any other fight. Or they want show!Jorah\u2019s choice of fighting for the living is entirely his, out of the love for his father. However, in any case, the hint to Jorah\u2019s final decision is already there.\u00a0</p><p>To this point, the love and trust Jorah has for Dany has become a wall with numerous cracks.

We also examined how the relationship with their respective father (Ned, Jeor, Randyll) and the desire to carry the ancestral sword (Ice, Longclaw, Heartsbane) shaped Jon, Jorah and Sam\u2019s character development and would be another bonding factor between the three sons. It\u2019s highly likely that Sam will bestow his ancestral sword Heartsbane to Jorah.

Everyone starts to be wary of Dany and her dragons. And to boil up the already messy situation:\u00a0<br></p><h2># 3 News about Dany roasting the Lannister army and the Tarlys reaches the North</h2><p>One way or the other, the lords will know about how Dany dracarys-ed the Lannister army and forced the survivors to kneel by executing the Tarlys with fire. Most probably from the maesters in Citadel who have been in contact with maester Wolkan in Winterfell. Everyone will be shocked, bad memories of the Mad King and all the terrible Targaryen rulers before him will be recalled and distrust of Dany and her\u00a0\u201cgood will\u201d would grow exponentially.\u00a0</p><p>Imagine what Jorah would think when he knows that his beloved Khaleesi, who always claimed to make the world a better place and free people from oppression, has done this horrible thing to thousands of men, many of them are just innocent commoners who were dragged into someone else\u2019s war.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"215\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1936e7a94b97b04d4280e5f77f5df460/tumblr_ouc6advQZG1snykouo6_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"215\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"215\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/083a2a310dc2bfc4b425de0dc728ae0a/tumblr_ouc6advQZG1snykouo5_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"215\"></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0\n\n<i><a href=\"http://mockingjaykatniss2.tumblr.com/post/163921542079\">mockingjaykatniss2</a></i>\n\n</p><p>What did he say to Dany when trying to convince her not to order the execution of thousands of masters in Yunkai when they rised against her?</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/376eeadee5c7ac57b4e231b0e6b56e91/tumblr_inline_pozwtduGLT1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><p>Moreover, Jorah insisted that if building a better world was what Dany wanted, she had to show people (from both sides) another way, different from the brutality they had always known.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nslaves you freed, brutality is all they\u2019ve ever known.

The writers kept him out for a reason. They want to reserve his reactions for a later date when the news and/or the reality would shock him.

We also examined how the relationship with their respective father (Ned, Jeor, Randyll) and the desire to carry the ancestral sword (Ice, Longclaw, Heartsbane) shaped Jon, Jorah and Sam&rsquo;s character development and would be another bonding factor between the three sons. It&rsquo;s highly likely that Sam will bestow his ancestral sword Heartsbane to Jorah. And this act of kindness will boost up Jorah&rsquo;s morale and motivation to fight for the side of the living, to honor his father, and to pay his debt to Sam.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>Bromance or Romance, Family or Khaleesi</b></h2><p>As discussed in<a href=\"https://springwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com/post/183632290108/jorahs-choice-p1\"> part 1</a>, tensions in the North between Dany and the lords would escalate shortly after her arrival while the Dead Army is approaching. Everyone starts to be wary of Dany and her dragons. And to boil up the already messy situation:&nbsp;<br /></p><h2># 3 News about Dany roasting the Lannister army and the Tarlys reaches the North</h2><p>One way or the other, the lords will know about how Dany dracarys-ed the Lannister army and forced the survivors to kneel by executing the Tarlys with fire. Most probably from the maesters in Citadel who have been in contact with maester Wolkan in Winterfell. Everyone will be shocked, bad memories of the Mad King and all the terrible Targaryen rulers before him will be recalled and distrust of Dany and her&nbsp;&ldquo;good will&rdquo; would grow exponentially.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine what Jorah would think when he knows that his beloved Khaleesi, who always claimed to make the world a better place and free people from oppression, has done this horrible thing to thousands of men, many of them are just innocent commoners who were dragged into someone else&rsquo;s war.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1936e7a94b97b04d4280e5f77f5df460/tumblr_ouc6advQZG1snykouo6_r1_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/083a2a310dc2bfc4b425de0dc728ae0a/tumblr_ouc6advQZG1snykouo5_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Gif:&nbsp;\n\n<i><a href=\"http://mockingjaykatniss2.tumblr.com/post/163921542079\">mockingjaykatniss2</a></i>\n\n</p><p>What did he say to Dany when trying to convince her not to order the execution of thousands of masters in Yunkai when they rised against her?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/376eeadee5c7ac57b4e231b0e6b56e91/tumblr_inline_pozwtduGLT1v86ltz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Moreover, Jorah insisted that if building a better world was what Dany wanted, she had to show people (from both sides) another way, different from the brutality they had always known.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nslaves you freed, brutality is all they&rsquo;ve ever known.

She listened to him in Meereen, but does the exactly the opposite in Westeros, where her opponents are no slavers, making her actions of brutalizing them even worse.

His trust and respect in Dany would gradually deteriorate.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that due to his leave to find a cure for himself, Jorah was not present in both scenes where Dany introduced herself as a fierce, merciless warlord. The writers kept him out for a reason. They want to reserve his reactions for a later date when the news and/or the reality would shock him. Jorah would shudder when he knows how brutal Dany has become and he cannot be at ease at all, if Dany plans to keep her word and does exactly the same to the North.</p><p>Like when she gave her rousing speech to the Dothraki about&nbsp;&ldquo;kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses&rdquo;&hellip;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/97c5cf0307ec98e83b126607d0db41b9/tumblr_pdufek3uAg1r3i2gwo1_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Gif:&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://yocalio.tumblr.com/post/177259050683\">yocalio</a>\n\n</p><p>&hellip; and the infamous&nbsp;&ldquo;bend the knee or die&rdquo;&hellip;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/507ca8add4b8208437c80c7ec9f651c7/tumblr_inline_pp0yusDfYU1v86ltz_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Does she sound any more like the compassionate queen who aspired to build a better world for the downtrodden that he once believed in?

And I don&rsquo;t believe he would keep his cool and stay silent&nbsp;&ldquo;for the greater good&rdquo;. Very likely, Sam will confront Dany, question her decision and/ or demand an explanation/ apology from her. I&rsquo;m not sure if he would take a more reckless action toward Dany, but whatever he does, Sam puts himself in a very dangerous position when he personally confronts the Mother of Dragons.<br /></p><p>When all these chaos happen, Jorah would try to give Dany counsel and calm her down (like he always did). But now Dany has fully embraced her identity as a dragon (as Lady Olenna advised her), she wouldn&rsquo;t listen to him any more.&nbsp;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2> And this is when Jorah finally sees Dany for what she is: A Dragon. </h2><blockquote><p>They&rsquo;re dragons, Khaleesi.

(Jorah to Missandei, 7x07)</p></blockquote><p>This whole situation will be a hot mess, since lots of people in Winterfell had awful experience and/ or memories with fire fanatics. Jon, Davos, Tormund, Sansa, Arya, Bran, Gendry, Sandor, all the Northern lords, etc. And<b> if Sam is under threat from Dany, who would find themselves responsible to protect him?</b></p><p>Jon, of course, Sam is his best friend.&nbsp;</p><p>Bran, very likely, Sam is his companion now.</p><p>Jorah, Sam&rsquo;s new pal.

However, I believe he would not stay still when Sam is in danger.&nbsp;</p><p>And don&rsquo;t forget Gilly. She is very protective of him too. She stood up against Lord Tarly when he harshly criticized Sam when he returned to Horn Hill. She would not let Sam be bullied in front of her.</p><blockquote><p>He&rsquo;s a greater warrior than either of you would ever be.

There should be a reason. And I&rsquo;m doubtful the reason is just that she is Sam&rsquo;s girlfriend and her son is the human brother of the Night King&rsquo;s White Walkers.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d996f5c5b8235afc574c71e4ccce72c8/tumblr_inline_pp000w6eo51v86ltz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Gilly knows, or at least partly knows the truth about Jon&rsquo;s true parentage.

We also examined how the relationship with their respective father (Ned, Jeor, Randyll) and the desire to carry the ancestral sword (Ice, Longclaw, Heartsbane) shaped Jon, Jorah and Sam&rsquo;s character development and would be another bonding factor between the three sons. It&rsquo;s highly likely that Sam will bestow his ancestral sword Heartsbane to Jorah. And this act of kindness will boost up Jorah&rsquo;s morale and motivation to fight for the side of the living, to honor his father, and to pay his debt to Sam.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Bromance or Romance, Family or Khaleesi</b></h2>\n<p>As discussed in<a href=\"https://springwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com/post/183632290108/jorahs-choice-p1\"> part 1</a>, tensions in the North between Dany and the lords would escalate shortly after her arrival while the Dead Army is approaching. Everyone starts to be wary of Dany and her dragons. And to boil up the already messy situation:&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<h2># 3 News about Dany roasting the Lannister army and the Tarlys reaches the North</h2>\n<p>One way or the other, the lords will know about how Dany dracarys-ed the Lannister army and forced the survivors to kneel by executing the Tarlys with fire. Most probably from the maesters in Citadel who have been in contact with maester Wolkan in Winterfell. Everyone will be shocked, bad memories of the Mad King and all the terrible Targaryen rulers before him will be recalled and distrust of Dany and her&nbsp;&ldquo;good will&rdquo; would grow exponentially.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imagine what Jorah would think when he knows that his beloved Khaleesi, who always claimed to make the world a better place and free people from oppression, has done this horrible thing to thousands of men, many of them are just innocent commoners who were dragged into someone else&rsquo;s war.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1936e7a94b97b04d4280e5f77f5df460/tumblr_ouc6advQZG1snykouo6_r1_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/083a2a310dc2bfc4b425de0dc728ae0a/tumblr_ouc6advQZG1snykouo5_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Gif:&nbsp;\n\n<i><a href=\"http://mockingjaykatniss2.tumblr.com/post/163921542079\">mockingjaykatniss2</a></i>\n\n</p>\n<p>What did he say to Dany when trying to convince her not to order the execution of thousands of masters in Yunkai when they rised against her?</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/376eeadee5c7ac57b4e231b0e6b56e91/tumblr_inline_pozwtduGLT1v86ltz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Moreover, Jorah insisted that if building a better world was what Dany wanted, she had to show people (from both sides) another way, different from the brutality they had always known.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nslaves you freed, brutality is all they&rsquo;ve ever known.
