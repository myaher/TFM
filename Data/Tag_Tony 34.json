As I said <a href=\"https://onlymorelove.tumblr.com/post/185135745958/i-love-your-stevetony-edits-and-fics-d-if-you\">here</a>, I\u2019m going to answer your ask in pieces. Thank you again for the ask. :)</p><p>Words cannot possibly express how much I love this entire scene from Endgame, and it\u2019s because of how much emotion there is in it. In Tony\u2019s face and in Tony\u2019s words. In Steve\u2019s face. <br/><br/>The trouble begins when Steve says that Tony fought Thanos\u2014and then asks if Thanos gave him any clues or coordinates that would help them find him. Steve\u2019s eyes are on the mission, and he (tries) to play it professionally and stoically. He wants Tony to be neutral and professional and focus on the mission, too.<br/></p><p>However, this is deeply personal\u2014for all of them, of course\u2014but the primary\u00a0 focus \n\nin this scene is Tony and his feelings, and he does not for a second allow Steve to forget that it <i>is</i> personal.\u00a0</p><p>I think what Tony\u2019s trying to say throughout the scene is,\u00a0\u201cLook at <i>me</i>, Steve. Look at <i>us</i> and where we stand today\u2014and why.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Because the scene of Tony\u2019s return to Earth is about grief and raw relief at being alive and knowing who else is alive. It <i>isn\u2019t </i>about a reckoning between Tony and Steve.</p><p>The start of that reckoning is THIS SCENE.</p><p>I\u2019m going to spare you a full transcript, but here\u2019s a snippet:\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, I&rsquo;m gonna need you to focus.\u201d<br/><br/>&quot;When <b>I</b> needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It&rsquo;s too late, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Notice that Tony says,\u00a0\u201cI,\u201d NOT\u00a0\u201cWe.\u201d\u00a0<br/><br/>There are others in the room, but this scene\u2014this moment\u2014is about Tony and Steve. It\u2019s about Tony getting his ass handed to him by Thanos. It\u2019s about him losing Peter. It\u2019s about him floating in space \n\nfor 3+ weeks\n\nwith almost-certain death in sight. It\u2019s about Siberia. It\u2019s about the letter and the flip phone Steve sent Tony. It\u2019s about broken promises. It\u2019s about how much Tony believed in both Steve Rogers and Captain America; how much he <i>cared</i>\u00a0about Steve; and how unbelievably hurt and betrayed he felt when he learned the hard way that Steve is just a man, and therefore <i>fallible</i>. (Please note: I\u2019m not trying to get into Civil War discourse here, so just know that I think BOTH Steve and Tony made mistakes.)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"211\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f6be8a3f020ba4dce93af67b5923ef15/tumblr_inline_ps2sq4d2M91qzirkh_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"211\"/></figure><p>Look up at Steve\u2019s face when Tony tells him it\u2019s too late. Where are Steve\u2019s neutrality and (seeming) lack of emotional involvement now? Hint: Tony ripped them away with his words.\u00a0</p><p>This is Steve, and this is Tony, who has always,<i> always</i> made Steve feel things he doesn\u2019t want to feel.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"530\" data-orig-height=\"611\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2b7430a64596615994ac76d4c1af794/tumblr_inline_ps2sbxiEu51qzirkh_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"530\" data-orig-height=\"611\"/></figure><p>Tony takes his symbolic heart, the literal heart/seat of the Iron Man armor, rips it from his own chest, and hands it to Steve.\u00a0</p><p>What, I ask you, am I supposed to do with this except love it?</p><figure data-orig-width=\"531\" data-orig-height=\"615\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/354579db595be510d0339c9780fffcfe/tumblr_inline_ps2sc2OsOJ1qzirkh_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"531\" data-orig-height=\"615\"/></figure><p>I cannot handle the expression on Tony\u2019s face in that last cap.\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s no way that Steve\u2019s going to fully respond to Tony in this scene. At least, not verbally. He just accepts everything Tony gives him; he doesn\u2019t run. He doesn\u2019t fight back. He faces Tony\u2019s anger and pain, which stem from his love, and just takes it. (Consider how difficult it must be to do that. How easy is it for <i>you</i> to accept this kind of a tongue lashing from someone, even if you think it\u2019s (somewhat) deserved? I\u2019ll answer for myself: it\u2019s hard as hell.) Steve\u2019s not an intentionally cruel person; he knows Tony\u2019s a physical and emotional wreck; he\u2019s so happy that Tony is alive; he knows now is not the time to hash it all out.\u00a0</p><p>I wanted this mostly monologue to continue into a later conversation between Tony and Steve. One in which Steve <i>would</i>\u00a0say more and delve into his side of the story instead of simply agreeing with Tony\u2019s statement that \u201cresentment is corrosive\u201d in the shield return scene. Oh well!</p><p>I like how this scene is a sort of mirror for the scene in CW where Tony receives and reads Steve\u2019s letter. In that scene, Tony could only absorb Steve\u2019s written words; he couldn\u2019t reply to Steve because Steve wasn\u2019t there. Well, he could if he called Steve. ;) In this scene, Steve can only absorb Tony\u2019s words and feelings; he can\u2019t reply to Tony. Well, he could if he were willing to hurt Tony further when he\u2019s already a fragile, emaciated mess. (See what I mean about mirrors?)</p>",

As I said <a href=\"https://onlymorelove.tumblr.com/post/185135745958/i-love-your-stevetony-edits-and-fics-d-if-you\">here</a>, I\u2019m going to answer your ask in pieces. Thank you again for the ask. :)</p><p>Words cannot possibly express how much I love this entire scene from Endgame, and it\u2019s because of how much emotion there is in it. In Tony\u2019s face and in Tony\u2019s words. In Steve\u2019s face. <br><br>The trouble begins when Steve says that Tony fought Thanos\u2014and then asks if Thanos gave him any clues or coordinates that would help them find him. Steve\u2019s eyes are on the mission, and he (tries) to play it professionally and stoically. He wants Tony to be neutral and professional and focus on the mission, too.<br></p><p>However, this is deeply personal\u2014for all of them, of course\u2014but the primary\u00a0 focus \n\nin this scene is Tony and his feelings, and he does not for a second allow Steve to forget that it <i>is</i> personal.\u00a0</p><p>I think what Tony\u2019s trying to say throughout the scene is,\u00a0\u201cLook at <i>me</i>, Steve. Look at <i>us</i> and where we stand today\u2014and why.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Because the scene of Tony\u2019s return to Earth is about grief and raw relief at being alive and knowing who else is alive. It <i>isn\u2019t </i>about a reckoning between Tony and Steve.</p><p>The start of that reckoning is THIS SCENE.</p><p>I\u2019m going to spare you a full transcript, but here\u2019s a snippet:\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony, I\u2019m gonna need you to focus.\u201d<br><br>\"When <b>I</b> needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It\u2019s too late, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Notice that Tony says,\u00a0\u201cI,\u201d NOT\u00a0\u201cWe.\u201d\u00a0<br><br>There are others in the room, but this scene\u2014this moment\u2014is about Tony and Steve. It\u2019s about Tony getting his ass handed to him by Thanos. It\u2019s about him losing Peter. It\u2019s about him floating in space \n\nfor 3+ weeks\n\nwith almost-certain death in sight. It\u2019s about Siberia. It\u2019s about the letter and the flip phone Steve sent Tony. It\u2019s about broken promises. It\u2019s about how much Tony believed in both Steve Rogers and Captain America; how much he <i>cared</i>\u00a0about Steve; and how unbelievably hurt and betrayed he felt when he learned the hard way that Steve is just a man, and therefore <i>fallible</i>. (Please note: I\u2019m not trying to get into Civil War discourse here, so just know that I think BOTH Steve and Tony made mistakes.)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"211\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f6be8a3f020ba4dce93af67b5923ef15/tumblr_inline_ps2sq4d2M91qzirkh_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"211\"></figure><p>Look up at Steve\u2019s face when Tony tells him it\u2019s too late.

At least, not verbally. He just accepts everything Tony gives him; he doesn\u2019t run. He doesn\u2019t fight back. He faces Tony\u2019s anger and pain, which stem from his love, and just takes it. (Consider how difficult it must be to do that. How easy is it for <i>you</i> to accept this kind of a tongue lashing from someone, even if you think it\u2019s (somewhat) deserved? I\u2019ll answer for myself: it\u2019s hard as hell.) Steve\u2019s not an intentionally cruel person; he knows Tony\u2019s a physical and emotional wreck; he\u2019s so happy that Tony is alive; he knows now is not the time to hash it all out.\u00a0</p><p>I wanted this mostly monologue to continue into a later conversation between Tony and Steve. One in which Steve <i>would</i>\u00a0say more and delve into his side of the story instead of simply agreeing with Tony\u2019s statement that \u201cresentment is corrosive\u201d in the shield return scene. Oh well!</p><p>I like how this scene is a sort of mirror for the scene in CW where Tony receives and reads Steve\u2019s letter. In that scene, Tony could only absorb Steve\u2019s written words; he couldn\u2019t reply to Steve because Steve wasn\u2019t there. Well, he could if he called Steve. ;) In this scene, Steve can only absorb Tony\u2019s words and feelings; he can\u2019t reply to Tony. Well, he could if he were willing to hurt Tony further when he\u2019s already a fragile, emaciated mess. (See what I mean about mirrors?)</p></p>",

With half the life gone everything seemed so much quieter, slower.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>Everything, apparently except for the person standing against his kitchen counter eating a sandwich. He looked about 18 or 19, tired face..bloody knuckles?&nbsp;&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Tony asked while he powered off the glove.</p>\n</p>",

That\u2019s not happening.\u201d<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d you said, \u201cdo you really believe any of them are going to convince a younger you to give up the blueprint?\u201d</p><p>You gestured your arms around yourself to indicate you were talking about the Avengers. Tony sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose before looking around the room, looking at each of his teammates who stood before him. He knew that there was absolutely no way his younger self would ever listen to authority figures or people older than him, and he knew his younger self wouldn\u2019t be smart enough to listen to Natasha if she went back in time. </p><p>\u201cI look about your age,\u201d you said, shrugging. </p><p>\u201cOkay, no,\u201d Tony said, wagging his finger as he balanced from one foot to the other. He looked at the other Avengers in the room, unsure of what to do or say.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Steve began, \u201cI have to agree. There\u2019s no way any of us could pass as a college student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter can come with me,\u201d you suggested. </p><p>Tony snapped his fingers. \u201cPeter can go alone.\u201d</p><p>You deadpanned. \u201cDad, you really think your twenty-year-old self is gonna listen to someone who looks younger than you?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cY/N and Peter should go together,\u201d said Natasha. \u201cWe all know you\u2019re to stubborn to listen to any of us and I don\u2019t want to take that chance with younger you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this idea one bit,\u201d Tony muttered as he rubbed his temple and scratched the back of his neck. \u201cI mean, what if things go wrong? What if I can\u2019t bring you guys back? What happens to the timeline if you change things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help with that,\u201d Banner offered. \u201cAfter Lang gave me a Pym Particle sample, I\u2019ve been able to create more tubes for situations just like this. I\u2019ll be able to monitor everything they\u2019re doing and bring them right back. Besides, they wouldn\u2019t mess up our timeline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they travel back in time to meet your younger self, they\u2019ll be creating an alternate timeline. They\u2019re not going to change anything in our present,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be gone for a few minutes our time and for however long it takes for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Tony said, looking at you. You nodded and gave him a hug before following him, Bruce, and Peter to the garage laboratory to get ready.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going back to 1985 to meet Mr. Stark as a college kid,\u201d Peter said as he put the helmet on his suit. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to MIT before.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s always telling me stories about his younger days and it\u2019s going to be really weird meeting him as a college kid,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cHow many people can say they\u2019ve traveled back in time?\u201d</p><p>You looked at Peter and high-fived one another before entering the lab space, wondering what meeting your father at twenty would be like.</p><p>***</p><p>You and Peter landed in an empty classroom and the suit minimized. You slipped the time contraption around your wrist to conceal it as a bracelet before exiting the classroom. </p><p>\u201cIs this what guys wore in the eighties?\u201d Peter said, grimacing at his outfit. \u201cI feel so out of place.\u201d </p><p>You swatted his shoulder. \u201cOf course you do. I happen to like wearing high-waisted pants and a cute sweatshirt,\u201d you said, looking down. \u201cAlthough we didn\u2019t have time to put any hairspray in my hair so a ponytail for now will have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would we even find Mr. Stark?\u201d Peter asked. </p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cPeter, you can\u2019t call my dad Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t call Mr. Stark &lsquo;Dad.\u2019\u201d</p><p>You looked at him. \u201cTouche. Okay, he told me he usually spent Thursday mornings in the library. Maybe we could pretend to be students who need help in physics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never going to work,\u201d Peter said. </p><p>\u201cWell, do you have a better idea?\u201d </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cHi, are you Tony Stark?\u201d </p><p>The man whose back was facing you turned around and you tried to keep yourself from gasping too loudly. There was your father, twenty-five years younger, sitting in front of you without knowing your true intentions. The create between his eyebrows was the same as so was the little smirk he did whenever he met someone new. </p><p>\u201cAnd who might you be, beautiful?\u201d</p><p>You cringed. </p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not here for that. I need help with my physics class and everyone said you were the person to go to for help,\u201d you said. </p><p>Tony tilted his head to the side as you took a seat next to him, looking between you and your textbooks. He let his elbow rest on the back of his chair before shrugging his shoulders and letting you sprawl your stuff on the desk in front of you.</p><p>\u201cSay, you look really familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have that kind of face,\u201d you said, tossing your hair over your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d you replied. </p><p>While you were with Tony, you and Peter had decided to split up for an hour so he could gather information about where he might\u2019ve put the blueprint for a then-JARVIS in order for him to make repairs on present day F.R.I.D.A.Y. The mission itself wasn\u2019t dangerous (to an extent) or really necessary, but the quicker the update, the better the AI.</p><p>\u201cIntro to physics, hm? Took that class three semesters ago. Who do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Berstein,\u201d you said, vaguely remembering the information your father had told you before the mission. </p><p>\u201cAh, Mr. Bernstein,\u201d he said, rubbing his chin. \u201cNever really liked that guy as a person but he was a hell of a teacher.\u201d</p><p>You smiled to yourself, thinking how your father had said the same thing thirty minutes prior. </p><p>\u201cWell, I just need to last the rest of the semester,\u201d you said, taking out a pencil and your notebook. </p><p>\u201cI can definitely help you with that,\u201d Tony said as he opened up your book. \u201cWhat do you need help with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um,\u201d you said, not having thought that far. \u201cApplied concepts,\u201d you said, reading from a random page. </p><p>Tony grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck. That happens to be something I\u2019m genuinely interested in. </p><p>For the next thirty minutes, you listened to your father - the younger version - talk about physics and had to pretend you had no idea what he was talking about. As he read a footnote from the textbook, you sat back in your seat and crossed your arms. </p><p>\u201cSo, JARVIS,\u201d you began. Tony looked at you and raised your eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know about JARVIS?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cPlease. You think I wouldn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we did meet thirty minutes ago.\u201d You rolled your eyes once more. \u201cYour eyes are definitely going to pop out of your socket if you keep rolling your eyes at me.\u201d</p><p>You looked and saw Tony staring at you with a playful grin and you punched his shoulder, fixing your ponytail before turning your body to face his. You tucked one of your legs underneath the other and let your head rest on your chin with your elbow on the table and watched him follow suit. </p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d you began. \u201cJARVIS seems like a pretty revolutionary thing to be inventing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t technically invent it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my father\u2019s idea but I just tweaked it a little. I have blueprints but haven\u2019t built a prototype yet and I don\u2019t really know if I want to find out if it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It seem like a pretty cool idea to me and if anyone can make it happen, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled softly. \u201cThanks, Y/N.\u201d He stopped talking for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m telling you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just know that I really couldn\u2019t care less about your last name, if that\u2019s that you\u2019re worried about,\u201d knowing that\u2019s exactly what he was thinking about. </p><p>\u201cA lot of people tell me that,\u201d he mumbled, turning away from you. You shrugged nonchalantly, picking your pen from the desk before taking notes on whatever page you were reading. </p><p>\u201cBut not everyone means it. I don\u2019t need you to believe me. You don\u2019t owe me anything and I don\u2019t owe you anything either. Well, except a thank you for helping me with physics,\u201d you said. </p><p>Tony peered and turned his head slightly to see you studying peacefully and wondered if what you said was true. Besides, there was something about you that seemed familiar. </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, turning to face you once again. You mimicked his movement and resumed your original position. \u201cWell, JARVIS is this idea that I\u2019ve been developing further. Basically, I want it to accompany me with my needs in the laboratory when I develop more prototypes and projects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Sounds pretty fancy,\u201d you said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever make something as great as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d he said, giving you a genuine smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure that inside that pretty little head of yours, there\u2019s a brain that exceeds everyone\u2019s expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope,\u201d you said with a sigh. \u201cSometimes, I think that people want me to be as great as my father. He\u2019s, uh, pretty established and I don\u2019t usually like telling people my last name in fear that they\u2019ll just expect something from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you don\u2019t meet people\u2019s expectations, you blame yourself,\u201d he added. </p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d </p><p>Tony looked at you with a newfound grace and there seemed to be a light that twinkled in his eyes. With a spark of realization, he clapped his hands once before packing up your things for you. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d you asked, confused when he put your stuff in your backpack and zipped it up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m showing you JARVIS.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you thought up all of this,\u201d you said as you gazed at the blueprints.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come up with all of it,\u201d Tony said sheepishly. \u201cMy father helped me with the basics and I just brainstormed from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is brilliant,\u201d you said, holding the blueprints in front of you, taking pictures with the camera on your fake glasses. </p><p>\u201cI hope that I can do something as great as my dad,\u201d you confessed. \u201cWe\u2019ve never worked on a project together and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because we\u2019re busy or if I don\u2019t have the capabilities to.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at you. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need my help, did you?\u201d You sheepishly looked at Tony and shrugged, setting his blueprint back on his desk. </p><p>\u201cNot really. I-I just really wanted to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he began, \u201cif it were any other person, I\u2019d probably freak out and kick you out of my room. But I can\u2019t seem to do that. Maybe it\u2019s because your father and my father are almost the same, or maybe it\u2019s because you like physics as much as I do. Judging by the past hour we spent together, you\u2019re going to make your father proud. Either way, I\u2019m happy we met.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Tony with adoration in your eyes and you couldn\u2019t help but rush towards him and embrace him in between your arms. You let your head rest on your chest as a satisfied smile rest on your lips. Tony, stunned, wasn\u2019t sure what to do but let himself hug you back anyway.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d you heard Peter say from the door. You both whipped your heads to his voice to see him panting. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Tony asked, pointing at the young man in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Peter,\u201d he said, stunned at how young Tony looked. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my boyfriend,\u201d you said quickly to prevent Tony from asking him any questions. Peter raised an eyebrow at you, to which you gave him a knowing look. \u201cAnyway, we should get going. Thanks for today, Tony. It was really nice getting to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feeling\u2019s mutual,\u201d Tony said as he relinquished you from his grasp. </p><p>\u201cDo me a favor,\u201d you said as you joined Peter. \u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself. You\u2019re gonna do great things and I\u2019ll always be proud of you.\u201d You turned to leave but turned around. \u201cOh, and in the future, please don\u2019t your daughter dye her hair orange.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBye Mr. St-I mean, Tony!\u201d Peter yelled from the hallway as you teleported back to the future.</p><p>You left Tony dumbfounded and he couldn\u2019t fathom why he would ever let his daughter do something like that. Or that he\u2019d even have children. He shrugged and tucked his blueprints in his desk drawer, deciding on a whim to take a nap after a weird encounter.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cYou know, you were pretty cute in your twenties,\u201d you told Tony as he threw his arm around you, marveling at the newly improved F.R.I.D.A.Y. \u201cStill a hot-head, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, did we ever think I wouldn\u2019t be different?\u201d he asked with a laugh. </p><p>\u201cUh, did I have orange hair when I was eleven, by any chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did. You cried about it when you came home from the salon,\u201d Tony said with a laugh. </p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d </p><p>***</p><p>Taglist:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7LLktNYy6UNWt2fhwblFcw\">@sessi03</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKYjtg5etd6rm4xGT18Du_w\">@olliekookie</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwEP_7csk66qTrZjx5AzmfA\">@edgyhargreeves</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mofHGs5Xh6GQ2KycelmO-GA\">@simonsbluee</a>\u00a0 @meraki&ndash;me <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7YoIKztmyr4NJk0Y7_CNXw\">@sleep-i-ness</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBL_lonvYbCV5pQhnddRKsg\">@amourski</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM9vm2_2UHQrZ8s3TBOow7g\">@kath94210</a>.<br/></p>",

What if I can\u2019t bring you guys back? What happens to the timeline if you change things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help with that,\u201d Banner offered. \u201cAfter Lang gave me a Pym Particle sample, I\u2019ve been able to create more tubes for situations just like this. I\u2019ll be able to monitor everything they\u2019re doing and bring them right back. Besides, they wouldn\u2019t mess up our timeline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they travel back in time to meet your younger self, they\u2019ll be creating an alternate timeline. They\u2019re not going to change anything in our present,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be gone for a few minutes our time and for however long it takes for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Tony said, looking at you. You nodded and gave him a hug before following him, Bruce, and Peter to the garage laboratory to get ready.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going back to 1985 to meet Mr. Stark as a college kid,\u201d Peter said as he put the helmet on his suit. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to MIT before.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s always telling me stories about his younger days and it\u2019s going to be really weird meeting him as a college kid,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cHow many people can say they\u2019ve traveled back in time?\u201d</p><p>You looked at Peter and high-fived one another before entering the lab space, wondering what meeting your father at twenty would be like.</p><p>***</p><p>You and Peter landed in an empty classroom and the suit minimized. You slipped the time contraption around your wrist to conceal it as a bracelet before exiting the classroom. </p><p>\u201cIs this what guys wore in the eighties?\u201d Peter said, grimacing at his outfit. \u201cI feel so out of place.\u201d </p><p>You swatted his shoulder. \u201cOf course you do. I happen to like wearing high-waisted pants and a cute sweatshirt,\u201d you said, looking down. \u201cAlthough we didn\u2019t have time to put any hairspray in my hair so a ponytail for now will have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would we even find Mr. Stark?\u201d Peter asked. </p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cPeter, you can\u2019t call my dad Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t call Mr. Stark \u2018Dad.\u2019\u201d</p><p>You looked at him. \u201cTouche. Okay, he told me he usually spent Thursday mornings in the library. Maybe we could pretend to be students who need help in physics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never going to work,\u201d Peter said. </p><p>\u201cWell, do you have a better idea?\u201d </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cHi, are you Tony Stark?\u201d </p><p>The man whose back was facing you turned around and you tried to keep yourself from gasping too loudly. There was your father, twenty-five years younger, sitting in front of you without knowing your true intentions. The create between his eyebrows was the same as so was the little smirk he did whenever he met someone new. </p><p>\u201cAnd who might you be, beautiful?\u201d</p><p>You cringed. </p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not here for that. I need help with my physics class and everyone said you were the person to go to for help,\u201d you said. </p><p>Tony tilted his head to the side as you took a seat next to him, looking between you and your textbooks. He let his elbow rest on the back of his chair before shrugging his shoulders and letting you sprawl your stuff on the desk in front of you.</p><p>\u201cSay, you look really familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have that kind of face,\u201d you said, tossing your hair over your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d you replied. </p><p>While you were with Tony, you and Peter had decided to split up for an hour so he could gather information about where he might\u2019ve put the blueprint for a then-JARVIS in order for him to make repairs on present day F.R.I.D.A.Y. The mission itself wasn\u2019t dangerous (to an extent) or really necessary, but the quicker the update, the better the AI.</p><p>\u201cIntro to physics, hm? Took that class three semesters ago. Who do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Berstein,\u201d you said, vaguely remembering the information your father had told you before the mission. </p><p>\u201cAh, Mr. Bernstein,\u201d he said, rubbing his chin. \u201cNever really liked that guy as a person but he was a hell of a teacher.\u201d</p><p>You smiled to yourself, thinking how your father had said the same thing thirty minutes prior. </p><p>\u201cWell, I just need to last the rest of the semester,\u201d you said, taking out a pencil and your notebook. </p><p>\u201cI can definitely help you with that,\u201d Tony said as he opened up your book. \u201cWhat do you need help with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um,\u201d you said, not having thought that far. \u201cApplied concepts,\u201d you said, reading from a random page. </p><p>Tony grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck. That happens to be something I\u2019m genuinely interested in. </p><p>For the next thirty minutes, you listened to your father - the younger version - talk about physics and had to pretend you had no idea what he was talking about. As he read a footnote from the textbook, you sat back in your seat and crossed your arms. </p><p>\u201cSo, JARVIS,\u201d you began. Tony looked at you and raised your eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know about JARVIS?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cPlease. You think I wouldn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we did meet thirty minutes ago.\u201d You rolled your eyes once more. \u201cYour eyes are definitely going to pop out of your socket if you keep rolling your eyes at me.\u201d</p><p>You looked and saw Tony staring at you with a playful grin and you punched his shoulder, fixing your ponytail before turning your body to face his. You tucked one of your legs underneath the other and let your head rest on your chin with your elbow on the table and watched him follow suit. </p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d you began. \u201cJARVIS seems like a pretty revolutionary thing to be inventing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t technically invent it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my father\u2019s idea but I just tweaked it a little. I have blueprints but haven\u2019t built a prototype yet and I don\u2019t really know if I want to find out if it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It seem like a pretty cool idea to me and if anyone can make it happen, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled softly. \u201cThanks, Y/N.\u201d He stopped talking for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m telling you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just know that I really couldn\u2019t care less about your last name, if that\u2019s that you\u2019re worried about,\u201d knowing that\u2019s exactly what he was thinking about. </p><p>\u201cA lot of people tell me that,\u201d he mumbled, turning away from you. You shrugged nonchalantly, picking your pen from the desk before taking notes on whatever page you were reading. </p><p>\u201cBut not everyone means it. I don\u2019t need you to believe me. You don\u2019t owe me anything and I don\u2019t owe you anything either. Well, except a thank you for helping me with physics,\u201d you said. </p><p>Tony peered and turned his head slightly to see you studying peacefully and wondered if what you said was true. Besides, there was something about you that seemed familiar. </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, turning to face you once again. You mimicked his movement and resumed your original position. \u201cWell, JARVIS is this idea that I\u2019ve been developing further. Basically, I want it to accompany me with my needs in the laboratory when I develop more prototypes and projects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Sounds pretty fancy,\u201d you said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever make something as great as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d he said, giving you a genuine smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure that inside that pretty little head of yours, there\u2019s a brain that exceeds everyone\u2019s expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope,\u201d you said with a sigh. \u201cSometimes, I think that people want me to be as great as my father. He\u2019s, uh, pretty established and I don\u2019t usually like telling people my last name in fear that they\u2019ll just expect something from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you don\u2019t meet people\u2019s expectations, you blame yourself,\u201d he added. </p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d </p><p>Tony looked at you with a newfound grace and there seemed to be a light that twinkled in his eyes. With a spark of realization, he clapped his hands once before packing up your things for you. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d you asked, confused when he put your stuff in your backpack and zipped it up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m showing you JARVIS.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you thought up all of this,\u201d you said as you gazed at the blueprints.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come up with all of it,\u201d Tony said sheepishly. \u201cMy father helped me with the basics and I just brainstormed from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is brilliant,\u201d you said, holding the blueprints in front of you, taking pictures with the camera on your fake glasses. </p><p>\u201cI hope that I can do something as great as my dad,\u201d you confessed. \u201cWe\u2019ve never worked on a project together and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because we\u2019re busy or if I don\u2019t have the capabilities to.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at you. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need my help, did you?\u201d You sheepishly looked at Tony and shrugged, setting his blueprint back on his desk. </p><p>\u201cNot really. I-I just really wanted to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he began, \u201cif it were any other person, I\u2019d probably freak out and kick you out of my room. But I can\u2019t seem to do that. Maybe it\u2019s because your father and my father are almost the same, or maybe it\u2019s because you like physics as much as I do. Judging by the past hour we spent together, you\u2019re going to make your father proud. Either way, I\u2019m happy we met.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Tony with adoration in your eyes and you couldn\u2019t help but rush towards him and embrace him in between your arms. You let your head rest on your chest as a satisfied smile rest on your lips. Tony, stunned, wasn\u2019t sure what to do but let himself hug you back anyway.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d you heard Peter say from the door. You both whipped your heads to his voice to see him panting. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Tony asked, pointing at the young man in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Peter,\u201d he said, stunned at how young Tony looked. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my boyfriend,\u201d you said quickly to prevent Tony from asking him any questions. Peter raised an eyebrow at you, to which you gave him a knowing look. \u201cAnyway, we should get going. Thanks for today, Tony. It was really nice getting to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feeling\u2019s mutual,\u201d Tony said as he relinquished you from his grasp. </p><p>\u201cDo me a favor,\u201d you said as you joined Peter. \u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself. You\u2019re gonna do great things and I\u2019ll always be proud of you.\u201d You turned to leave but turned around. \u201cOh, and in the future, please don\u2019t your daughter dye her hair orange.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBye Mr. St-I mean, Tony!\u201d Peter yelled from the hallway as you teleported back to the future.</p><p>You left Tony dumbfounded and he couldn\u2019t fathom why he would ever let his daughter do something like that. Or that he\u2019d even have children. He shrugged and tucked his blueprints in his desk drawer, deciding on a whim to take a nap after a weird encounter.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cYou know, you were pretty cute in your twenties,\u201d you told Tony as he threw his arm around you, marveling at the newly improved F.R.I.D.A.Y. \u201cStill a hot-head, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, did we ever think I wouldn\u2019t be different?\u201d he asked with a laugh. </p><p>\u201cUh, did I have orange hair when I was eleven, by any chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did.

That\u2019s not happening.\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d you said, \u201cdo you really believe any of them are going to convince a younger you to give up the blueprint?\u201d</p><p>You gestured your arms around yourself to indicate you were talking about the Avengers. Tony sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose before looking around the room, looking at each of his teammates who stood before him. He knew that there was absolutely no way his younger self would ever listen to authority figures or people older than him, and he knew his younger self wouldn\u2019t be smart enough to listen to Natasha if she went back in time. </p><p>\u201cI look about your age,\u201d you said, shrugging. </p><p>\u201cOkay, no,\u201d Tony said, wagging his finger as he balanced from one foot to the other. He looked at the other Avengers in the room, unsure of what to do or say.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Steve began, \u201cI have to agree. There\u2019s no way any of us could pass as a college student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter can come with me,\u201d you suggested. </p><p>Tony snapped his fingers. \u201cPeter can go alone.\u201d</p><p>You deadpanned. \u201cDad, you really think your twenty-year-old self is gonna listen to someone who looks younger than you?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cY/N and Peter should go together,\u201d said Natasha. \u201cWe all know you\u2019re to stubborn to listen to any of us and I don\u2019t want to take that chance with younger you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this idea one bit,\u201d Tony muttered as he rubbed his temple and scratched the back of his neck. \u201cI mean, what if things go wrong? What if I can\u2019t bring you guys back? What happens to the timeline if you change things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help with that,\u201d Banner offered. \u201cAfter Lang gave me a Pym Particle sample, I\u2019ve been able to create more tubes for situations just like this. I\u2019ll be able to monitor everything they\u2019re doing and bring them right back. Besides, they wouldn\u2019t mess up our timeline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they travel back in time to meet your younger self, they\u2019ll be creating an alternate timeline. They\u2019re not going to change anything in our present,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be gone for a few minutes our time and for however long it takes for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Tony said, looking at you. You nodded and gave him a hug before following him, Bruce, and Peter to the garage laboratory to get ready.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going back to 1985 to meet Mr. Stark as a college kid,\u201d Peter said as he put the helmet on his suit. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to MIT before.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s always telling me stories about his younger days and it\u2019s going to be really weird meeting him as a college kid,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cHow many people can say they\u2019ve traveled back in time?\u201d</p><p>You looked at Peter and high-fived one another before entering the lab space, wondering what meeting your father at twenty would be like.</p><p>***</p><p>You and Peter landed in an empty classroom and the suit minimized. You slipped the time contraption around your wrist to conceal it as a bracelet before exiting the classroom. </p><p>\u201cIs this what guys wore in the eighties?\u201d Peter said, grimacing at his outfit. \u201cI feel so out of place.\u201d </p><p>You swatted his shoulder. \u201cOf course you do. I happen to like wearing high-waisted pants and a cute sweatshirt,\u201d you said, looking down. \u201cAlthough we didn\u2019t have time to put any hairspray in my hair so a ponytail for now will have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would we even find Mr. Stark?\u201d Peter asked. </p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cPeter, you can\u2019t call my dad Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t call Mr. Stark \u2018Dad.\u2019\u201d</p><p>You looked at him. \u201cTouche. Okay, he told me he usually spent Thursday mornings in the library. Maybe we could pretend to be students who need help in physics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never going to work,\u201d Peter said. </p><p>\u201cWell, do you have a better idea?\u201d </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cHi, are you Tony Stark?\u201d </p><p>The man whose back was facing you turned around and you tried to keep yourself from gasping too loudly. There was your father, twenty-five years younger, sitting in front of you without knowing your true intentions. The create between his eyebrows was the same as so was the little smirk he did whenever he met someone new. </p><p>\u201cAnd who might you be, beautiful?\u201d</p><p>You cringed. </p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not here for that. I need help with my physics class and everyone said you were the person to go to for help,\u201d you said. </p><p>Tony tilted his head to the side as you took a seat next to him, looking between you and your textbooks. He let his elbow rest on the back of his chair before shrugging his shoulders and letting you sprawl your stuff on the desk in front of you.</p><p>\u201cSay, you look really familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have that kind of face,\u201d you said, tossing your hair over your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d you replied. </p><p>While you were with Tony, you and Peter had decided to split up for an hour so he could gather information about where he might\u2019ve put the blueprint for a then-JARVIS in order for him to make repairs on present day F.R.I.D.A.Y. The mission itself wasn\u2019t dangerous (to an extent) or really necessary, but the quicker the update, the better the AI.</p><p>\u201cIntro to physics, hm? Took that class three semesters ago. Who do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Berstein,\u201d you said, vaguely remembering the information your father had told you before the mission. </p><p>\u201cAh, Mr. Bernstein,\u201d he said, rubbing his chin. \u201cNever really liked that guy as a person but he was a hell of a teacher.\u201d</p><p>You smiled to yourself, thinking how your father had said the same thing thirty minutes prior. </p><p>\u201cWell, I just need to last the rest of the semester,\u201d you said, taking out a pencil and your notebook. </p><p>\u201cI can definitely help you with that,\u201d Tony said as he opened up your book. \u201cWhat do you need help with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um,\u201d you said, not having thought that far. \u201cApplied concepts,\u201d you said, reading from a random page. </p><p>Tony grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck. That happens to be something I\u2019m genuinely interested in. </p><p>For the next thirty minutes, you listened to your father - the younger version - talk about physics and had to pretend you had no idea what he was talking about. As he read a footnote from the textbook, you sat back in your seat and crossed your arms. </p><p>\u201cSo, JARVIS,\u201d you began. Tony looked at you and raised your eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know about JARVIS?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cPlease. You think I wouldn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we did meet thirty minutes ago.\u201d You rolled your eyes once more. \u201cYour eyes are definitely going to pop out of your socket if you keep rolling your eyes at me.\u201d</p><p>You looked and saw Tony staring at you with a playful grin and you punched his shoulder, fixing your ponytail before turning your body to face his. You tucked one of your legs underneath the other and let your head rest on your chin with your elbow on the table and watched him follow suit. </p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d you began. \u201cJARVIS seems like a pretty revolutionary thing to be inventing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t technically invent it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my father\u2019s idea but I just tweaked it a little. I have blueprints but haven\u2019t built a prototype yet and I don\u2019t really know if I want to find out if it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It seem like a pretty cool idea to me and if anyone can make it happen, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled softly. \u201cThanks, Y/N.\u201d He stopped talking for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m telling you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just know that I really couldn\u2019t care less about your last name, if that\u2019s that you\u2019re worried about,\u201d knowing that\u2019s exactly what he was thinking about. </p><p>\u201cA lot of people tell me that,\u201d he mumbled, turning away from you. You shrugged nonchalantly, picking your pen from the desk before taking notes on whatever page you were reading. </p><p>\u201cBut not everyone means it. I don\u2019t need you to believe me. You don\u2019t owe me anything and I don\u2019t owe you anything either. Well, except a thank you for helping me with physics,\u201d you said. </p><p>Tony peered and turned his head slightly to see you studying peacefully and wondered if what you said was true. Besides, there was something about you that seemed familiar. </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, turning to face you once again. You mimicked his movement and resumed your original position. \u201cWell, JARVIS is this idea that I\u2019ve been developing further. Basically, I want it to accompany me with my needs in the laboratory when I develop more prototypes and projects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Sounds pretty fancy,\u201d you said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever make something as great as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d he said, giving you a genuine smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure that inside that pretty little head of yours, there\u2019s a brain that exceeds everyone\u2019s expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope,\u201d you said with a sigh. \u201cSometimes, I think that people want me to be as great as my father. He\u2019s, uh, pretty established and I don\u2019t usually like telling people my last name in fear that they\u2019ll just expect something from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you don\u2019t meet people\u2019s expectations, you blame yourself,\u201d he added. </p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d </p><p>Tony looked at you with a newfound grace and there seemed to be a light that twinkled in his eyes. With a spark of realization, he clapped his hands once before packing up your things for you. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d you asked, confused when he put your stuff in your backpack and zipped it up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m showing you JARVIS.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you thought up all of this,\u201d you said as you gazed at the blueprints.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come up with all of it,\u201d Tony said sheepishly. \u201cMy father helped me with the basics and I just brainstormed from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is brilliant,\u201d you said, holding the blueprints in front of you, taking pictures with the camera on your fake glasses. </p><p>\u201cI hope that I can do something as great as my dad,\u201d you confessed. \u201cWe\u2019ve never worked on a project together and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because we\u2019re busy or if I don\u2019t have the capabilities to.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at you. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need my help, did you?\u201d You sheepishly looked at Tony and shrugged, setting his blueprint back on his desk. </p><p>\u201cNot really. I-I just really wanted to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he began, \u201cif it were any other person, I\u2019d probably freak out and kick you out of my room. But I can\u2019t seem to do that. Maybe it\u2019s because your father and my father are almost the same, or maybe it\u2019s because you like physics as much as I do. Judging by the past hour we spent together, you\u2019re going to make your father proud. Either way, I\u2019m happy we met.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Tony with adoration in your eyes and you couldn\u2019t help but rush towards him and embrace him in between your arms. You let your head rest on your chest as a satisfied smile rest on your lips. Tony, stunned, wasn\u2019t sure what to do but let himself hug you back anyway.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d you heard Peter say from the door. You both whipped your heads to his voice to see him panting. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Tony asked, pointing at the young man in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Peter,\u201d he said, stunned at how young Tony looked. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my boyfriend,\u201d you said quickly to prevent Tony from asking him any questions. Peter raised an eyebrow at you, to which you gave him a knowing look. \u201cAnyway, we should get going. Thanks for today, Tony. It was really nice getting to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feeling\u2019s mutual,\u201d Tony said as he relinquished you from his grasp. </p><p>\u201cDo me a favor,\u201d you said as you joined Peter. \u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself. You\u2019re gonna do great things and I\u2019ll always be proud of you.\u201d You turned to leave but turned around. \u201cOh, and in the future, please don\u2019t your daughter dye her hair orange.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBye Mr. St-I mean, Tony!\u201d Peter yelled from the hallway as you teleported back to the future.</p><p>You left Tony dumbfounded and he couldn\u2019t fathom why he would ever let his daughter do something like that. Or that he\u2019d even have children.

That&rsquo;s not happening.&rdquo;<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; you said, &ldquo;do you really believe any of them are going to convince a younger you to give up the blueprint?&rdquo;</p><p>You gestured your arms around yourself to indicate you were talking about the Avengers. Tony sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose before looking around the room, looking at each of his teammates who stood before him. He knew that there was absolutely no way his younger self would ever listen to authority figures or people older than him, and he knew his younger self wouldn&rsquo;t be smart enough to listen to Natasha if she went back in time. </p><p>&ldquo;I look about your age,&rdquo; you said, shrugging. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, no,&rdquo; Tony said, wagging his finger as he balanced from one foot to the other. He looked at the other Avengers in the room, unsure of what to do or say.</p><p>&ldquo;As much as I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Steve began, &ldquo;I have to agree. There&rsquo;s no way any of us could pass as a college student.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter can come with me,&rdquo; you suggested. </p><p>Tony snapped his fingers. &ldquo;Peter can go alone.&rdquo;</p><p>You deadpanned. &ldquo;Dad, you really think your twenty-year-old self is gonna listen to someone who looks younger than you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N and Peter should go together,&rdquo; said Natasha. &ldquo;We all know you&rsquo;re to stubborn to listen to any of us and I don&rsquo;t want to take that chance with younger you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this idea one bit,&rdquo; Tony muttered as he rubbed his temple and scratched the back of his neck. &ldquo;I mean, what if things go wrong? What if I can&rsquo;t bring you guys back? What happens to the timeline if you change things?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can help with that,&rdquo; Banner offered. &ldquo;After Lang gave me a Pym Particle sample, I&rsquo;ve been able to create more tubes for situations just like this. I&rsquo;ll be able to monitor everything they&rsquo;re doing and bring them right back. Besides, they wouldn&rsquo;t mess up our timeline.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When they travel back in time to meet your younger self, they&rsquo;ll be creating an alternate timeline. They&rsquo;re not going to change anything in our present,&rdquo; Bruce said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be gone for a few minutes our time and for however long it takes for them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Tony said, looking at you. You nodded and gave him a hug before following him, Bruce, and Peter to the garage laboratory to get ready.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re going back to 1985 to meet Mr. Stark as a college kid,&rdquo; Peter said as he put the helmet on his suit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been to MIT before.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s always telling me stories about his younger days and it&rsquo;s going to be really weird meeting him as a college kid,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;How many people can say they&rsquo;ve traveled back in time?&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at Peter and high-fived one another before entering the lab space, wondering what meeting your father at twenty would be like.</p><p>***</p><p>You and Peter landed in an empty classroom and the suit minimized. You slipped the time contraption around your wrist to conceal it as a bracelet before exiting the classroom. </p><p>&ldquo;Is this what guys wore in the eighties?&rdquo; Peter said, grimacing at his outfit. &ldquo;I feel so out of place.&rdquo; </p><p>You swatted his shoulder. &ldquo;Of course you do. I happen to like wearing high-waisted pants and a cute sweatshirt,&rdquo; you said, looking down. &ldquo;Although we didn&rsquo;t have time to put any hairspray in my hair so a ponytail for now will have to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where would we even find Mr. Stark?&rdquo; Peter asked. </p><p>You rolled your eyes. &ldquo;Peter, you can&rsquo;t call my dad Mr. Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t call Mr. Stark &lsquo;Dad.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at him. &ldquo;Touche. Okay, he told me he usually spent Thursday mornings in the library. Maybe we could pretend to be students who need help in physics?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s never going to work,&rdquo; Peter said. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, do you have a better idea?&rdquo; </p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, are you Tony Stark?&rdquo; </p><p>The man whose back was facing you turned around and you tried to keep yourself from gasping too loudly. There was your father, twenty-five years younger, sitting in front of you without knowing your true intentions. The create between his eyebrows was the same as so was the little smirk he did whenever he met someone new. </p><p>&ldquo;And who might you be, beautiful?&rdquo;</p><p>You cringed. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m not here for that. I need help with my physics class and everyone said you were the person to go to for help,&rdquo; you said. </p><p>Tony tilted his head to the side as you took a seat next to him, looking between you and your textbooks. He let his elbow rest on the back of his chair before shrugging his shoulders and letting you sprawl your stuff on the desk in front of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Say, you look really familiar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have that kind of face,&rdquo; you said, tossing your hair over your shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, by the way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; you replied. </p><p>While you were with Tony, you and Peter had decided to split up for an hour so he could gather information about where he might&rsquo;ve put the blueprint for a then-JARVIS in order for him to make repairs on present day F.R.I.D.A.Y. The mission itself wasn&rsquo;t dangerous (to an extent) or really necessary, but the quicker the update, the better the AI.</p><p>&ldquo;Intro to physics, hm? Took that class three semesters ago. Who do you have?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Berstein,&rdquo; you said, vaguely remembering the information your father had told you before the mission. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Bernstein,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his chin. &ldquo;Never really liked that guy as a person but he was a hell of a teacher.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled to yourself, thinking how your father had said the same thing thirty minutes prior. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I just need to last the rest of the semester,&rdquo; you said, taking out a pencil and your notebook. </p><p>&ldquo;I can definitely help you with that,&rdquo; Tony said as he opened up your book. &ldquo;What do you need help with?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, um,&rdquo; you said, not having thought that far. &ldquo;Applied concepts,&rdquo; you said, reading from a random page. </p><p>Tony grinned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck. That happens to be something I&rsquo;m genuinely interested in. </p><p>For the next thirty minutes, you listened to your father - the younger version - talk about physics and had to pretend you had no idea what he was talking about. As he read a footnote from the textbook, you sat back in your seat and crossed your arms. </p><p>&ldquo;So, JARVIS,&rdquo; you began. Tony looked at you and raised your eyebrow. </p><p>&ldquo;How do you know about JARVIS?&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes. &ldquo;Please. You think I wouldn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we did meet thirty minutes ago.&rdquo; You rolled your eyes once more. &ldquo;Your eyes are definitely going to pop out of your socket if you keep rolling your eyes at me.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked and saw Tony staring at you with a playful grin and you punched his shoulder, fixing your ponytail before turning your body to face his. You tucked one of your legs underneath the other and let your head rest on your chin with your elbow on the table and watched him follow suit. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; you began. &ldquo;JARVIS seems like a pretty revolutionary thing to be inventing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t technically invent it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was my father&rsquo;s idea but I just tweaked it a little. I have blueprints but haven&rsquo;t built a prototype yet and I don&rsquo;t really know if I want to find out if it works.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not? It seem like a pretty cool idea to me and if anyone can make it happen, it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smiled softly. &ldquo;Thanks, Y/N.&rdquo; He stopped talking for a second. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know why I&rsquo;m telling you this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, just know that I really couldn&rsquo;t care less about your last name, if that&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re worried about,&rdquo; knowing that&rsquo;s exactly what he was thinking about. </p><p>&ldquo;A lot of people tell me that,&rdquo; he mumbled, turning away from you. You shrugged nonchalantly, picking your pen from the desk before taking notes on whatever page you were reading. </p><p>&ldquo;But not everyone means it. I don&rsquo;t need you to believe me. You don&rsquo;t owe me anything and I don&rsquo;t owe you anything either. Well, except a thank you for helping me with physics,&rdquo; you said. </p><p>Tony peered and turned his head slightly to see you studying peacefully and wondered if what you said was true. Besides, there was something about you that seemed familiar. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said, turning to face you once again. You mimicked his movement and resumed your original position. &ldquo;Well, JARVIS is this idea that I&rsquo;ve been developing further. Basically, I want it to accompany me with my needs in the laboratory when I develop more prototypes and projects.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow. Sounds pretty fancy,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could ever make something as great as that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; he said, giving you a genuine smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that inside that pretty little head of yours, there&rsquo;s a brain that exceeds everyone&rsquo;s expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; you said with a sigh. &ldquo;Sometimes, I think that people want me to be as great as my father. He&rsquo;s, uh, pretty established and I don&rsquo;t usually like telling people my last name in fear that they&rsquo;ll just expect something from me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And when you don&rsquo;t meet people&rsquo;s expectations, you blame yourself,&rdquo; he added. </p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony looked at you with a newfound grace and there seemed to be a light that twinkled in his eyes. With a spark of realization, he clapped his hands once before packing up your things for you. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; you asked, confused when he put your stuff in your backpack and zipped it up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m showing you JARVIS.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you thought up all of this,&rdquo; you said as you gazed at the blueprints.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come up with all of it,&rdquo; Tony said sheepishly. &ldquo;My father helped me with the basics and I just brainstormed from there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is brilliant,&rdquo; you said, holding the blueprints in front of you, taking pictures with the camera on your fake glasses. </p><p>&ldquo;I hope that I can do something as great as my dad,&rdquo; you confessed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never worked on a project together and I can&rsquo;t tell if it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re busy or if I don&rsquo;t have the capabilities to.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked at you. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t need my help, did you?&rdquo; You sheepishly looked at Tony and shrugged, setting his blueprint back on his desk. </p><p>&ldquo;Not really. I-I just really wanted to meet you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;if it were any other person, I&rsquo;d probably freak out and kick you out of my room. But I can&rsquo;t seem to do that. Maybe it&rsquo;s because your father and my father are almost the same, or maybe it&rsquo;s because you like physics as much as I do. Judging by the past hour we spent together, you&rsquo;re going to make your father proud. Either way, I&rsquo;m happy we met.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at Tony with adoration in your eyes and you couldn&rsquo;t help but rush towards him and embrace him in between your arms. You let your head rest on your chest as a satisfied smile rest on your lips. Tony, stunned, wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do but let himself hug you back anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; you heard Peter say from the door. You both whipped your heads to his voice to see him panting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking everywhere for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Tony asked, pointing at the young man in the doorway.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peter,&rdquo; he said, stunned at how young Tony looked. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my boyfriend,&rdquo; you said quickly to prevent Tony from asking him any questions. Peter raised an eyebrow at you, to which you gave him a knowing look. &ldquo;Anyway, we should get going. Thanks for today, Tony. It was really nice getting to know you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The feeling&rsquo;s mutual,&rdquo; Tony said as he relinquished you from his grasp. </p><p>&ldquo;Do me a favor,&rdquo; you said as you joined Peter. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard on yourself. You&rsquo;re gonna do great things and I&rsquo;ll always be proud of you.&rdquo; You turned to leave but turned around. &ldquo;Oh, and in the future, please don&rsquo;t your daughter dye her hair orange.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bye Mr. St-I mean, Tony!&rdquo; Peter yelled from the hallway as you teleported back to the future.</p><p>You left Tony dumbfounded and he couldn&rsquo;t fathom why he would ever let his daughter do something like that. Or that he&rsquo;d even have children. He shrugged and tucked his blueprints in his desk drawer, deciding on a whim to take a nap after a weird encounter.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;You know, you were pretty cute in your twenties,&rdquo; you told Tony as he threw his arm around you, marveling at the newly improved F.R.I.D.A.Y. &ldquo;Still a hot-head, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, did we ever think I wouldn&rsquo;t be different?&rdquo; he asked with a laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, did I have orange hair when I was eleven, by any chance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you did.
