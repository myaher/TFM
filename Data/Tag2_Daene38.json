She acknowledges the other wildfire caches around the city as well.</li></ul><p>This was a major qualm for me, Jaime Lannister\u2019s defining moment was when he killed the Mad King FOR THIS REASON; and in the show they just brushed it under the carpet I dont think it was even mentioned. If they need Jaime to stay with Cersei until the final episode so be it, but you have to show Jaime\u2019s internal struggle with the love he still has for his sister and the crimes she has committed. Recognising that the Sparrows werent good people but innocents died too, she committed war crimes essentially.

        "answer": "<p>There are plenty of better, well constructed answers to this on Tumblr thankfully lol but in my personal opinion D&amp;D stopped giving a shit quite a long time ago. We saw that from season 5 onwards: Sansa&rsquo;s rape, Shireen&rsquo;s immolation, Tyrion&rsquo;s brainlessness and the general MEH that the show became in the name of shock value. Maybe it was because they landed the Star Wars deal, maybe they got lazy and bored with Game of Thrones, maybe they got frustrated with the lack of material from George, maybe they decided to put their own spin on things as a result of delusion and megalomania. The questions are endless. </p><p>What we do know is that both George and HBO wanted it to go on longer and were willing to commission more episodes and dedicate a greater budget to the show, however D&amp;D clearly had set their sights elsewhere and no longer gave a flying fuck. D&amp;D then decided to take the most lazy and ridiculous route possible, they gave it the attention and dedication of a stoner graduate rushing to complete his coursework the night before it&rsquo;s due.</p><p>The result was this terribly paced, terribly written and terribly organised storyline. They took all the foreshadowing and the pre-existing storylines and decided that they weren&rsquo;t shocking or outr\u00e9 enough and decided to turn it all on its head in the name of shock value and unpredictability. </p><p>Even if George decides to kill off Dany in the books, I have complete faith that it won&rsquo;t be as ridiculously contrived or planned as the show was. I would be more inclined to believe that she dies for the greater good/ for the people and dies as a martyr and not a villain. I could be wrong but I do have faith in George to deliver a satisfactory arc to Daenerys&rsquo; character. At the end of the day, he might be a realist, but he is not a nihilist. I personally think Dany&rsquo;s story will be quite different from the show, obviously there are other book characters in play who will have a significant role in shaping her journey as she heads to Westeros. I won&rsquo;t get into it too much otherwise this post will go on forever haha.</p><p>Keep the faith my friend, it&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ve got at this stage.</p>",

        "body": "<p>after previously having only gotten as far as fuckin that like initial scene of tyrion mourning before having to write <a href=\"https://forthemetamyguy.tumblr.com/post/185046644943/so-they-made-jaime-fuck-over-brienne-so-that\">yet another fuckin dissertation about how this is absurd and yall hate women</a>&hellip; here we fuckin go. onto the rest. don&rsquo;t worry im not done complaining about the political ramifications of this garbage :)</p>\n\n<p>ok I got literally like a second further in and Daenerys shows up&hellip; They have her proud of this. All I\u2019ve seen is a look on her face and it&rsquo;s&hellip;bad. As if she wanted only victory. As if this is something she would revel in having done. Like seriously??? Her Dothraki people are cheering in conquest and she is going to experience no remorse for this destruction? She caged her children when they burned one child! That this act moves her to horror hasn\u2019t changed! Y'all really just want me to be okay with Jon killing her. You want him to be so just. He gets to be upset at her for this. That evil bitch who just wants power AND the mad girl of her mad father. It&rsquo;s revolting. The rage and sorrow I feel at this&hellip; \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e Indeed Emilia</p>\n\n<p>Oh hold up! I unpaused! She praises them because they&rsquo;ve fulfilled Drogo&rsquo;s will! Just when I thought it was enough of a low, she also fulfills the role of her abuser and does her husband&rsquo;s (ha ha the same guy) final bidding. Amazing! </p>\n\n<p>It occurs to me. Paused again as tyrion appears. Jon has no clue what she&rsquo;s saying. For all he knows, she&rsquo;s saying kill them all kill them all as they touch their spears to the ground but really she&rsquo;s just saying to grey worm, I am giving you this position of rank and honour which while a different name for it sure it isn&rsquo;t something to see as anything other than an appointment that is culturally significant. Jon isn&rsquo;t going to question her on this I guarantee it. He&rsquo;ll just be like damn they&rsquo;re so violent. She&rsquo;s a murderer. I&rsquo;m going to kill her</p>\n\n<p>Oh my god LOL now that she&rsquo;s mentioned Winterfell he&rsquo;s like SHE&rsquo;S GONNA KILL MY SISTER??? I&rsquo;M GOING TO KILL HER&hellip; Tyrion is hearing SHE&rsquo;S GONNA KILL YOU even though a CEILING killed the twins for fucks sake and he isn&rsquo;t on good terms with either! That is an adaptation change&hellip; But y'all couldn&rsquo;t change Daenerys having tHe MoRaL hIgH gRoUnD?? Damn.. but yeah uhhhhh bad. Shame y'all killed that massively impressive polyglot of a translator huh. </p>\n\n<p>These guys have become so lame. They&rsquo;re so wrapped up in their white guy hero costumes that they decide she&rsquo;s unfit to rule, so she acts in an impulsive way to get that rule, then they kill her&hellip; One is going to be, ostensibly, the ruler (Ned was, Tywin was&hellip; Tyrion already was) and one is going to fuck off into a content nothingness for himself. This is infuriating. Cersei wouldn&rsquo;t listen to her (barely existent) advisors in a show of her power but Daenerys did consult her advisors and relented to them endlessly (while Jon never does and he&rsquo;s always morally right about his actions) and often they actually failed her. Conveniently now that dude is the true power in westeros, along with miss Queen in the North like why did y'all not change this to the better: Sansa performs her power by playing the Game and becomes hand instead of making her want to be a queen in the end, and uh don&rsquo;t have this monstrosity of a &ldquo;women go bananas when they&rsquo;re lonely and grieving&rdquo; story for Dany and let them have a great rule together. Jon can be king man why is it all or nothing&hellip;but then Jon&rsquo;s trauma for this forces him to not seat the throne so I&rsquo;m supposed to feel like it&rsquo;s okay cause neither of them &ldquo;win&rdquo;? Bran does?! With TYRION AND BRONN AND FUCKING SAM TARLY AND FUCKING B R O N N ?! like DUDE&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>They don&rsquo;t even let Cersei go out cool. And they make Daenerys&rsquo; end traumatic. So we as women get absolutely no satisfaction (Sansa is one (1) woman in power but it doesn&rsquo;t even feel earned because she has no POV anymore&hellip;but even if so, this would not be satisying enough to negate the other shit). We don&rsquo;t get to be killed off in a satisfying way as the villain, but we get to be the traumatic hero deaths of a woman dying after her son like Cat or by the hands of her lover like Dany I mean goddamn. Jaime, Ned, they die FOR love. Cat, Dany&hellip;they&rsquo;re killed BECAUSE of love, because their trauma is somehow most compelling when it&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re in agony emotionally while for men it&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re at peace&hellip; Holy fucking shit</p>\n\n<p>IM LAUGHING. JON LITERALLY JUST SAID THE MORAL OF THE STORY. he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re born you aren&rsquo;t stamped with your family words, and she&rsquo;s not her father&rdquo;&hellip; Tyrion responds like, she&rsquo;s a conquering tyrant go kill her&hellip; But Jon that&rsquo;s what you seal the deal for when you kill her!!! It really fucking is about family words. And how she is now behaving, this woman who looks nothing like the woman we&rsquo;ve always seen even if she&rsquo;s speaking Dothraki. She is reduced to her father, who is crazy, and her family words &ldquo;fire and blood&rdquo; (even though her birthing dragons literally through fire and blood wasn&rsquo;t violence and destruction, it was sacrifice and creation&hellip;but who cares when you can say &ldquo;fire bad&rdquo;). Jesus fucking Christ I hate every moment of this. this is the conversation you were saving Jon for? Why the fuck didn&rsquo;t he have shit to say in that scene with Daenerys last week</p>\n\n<p>Tyrion literally just said, of Jon riding a dragon, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had that power&rdquo;!!!!! COME ON. You really are just desperate to steal her power away from her. The power of her CHILDREN, as if this last name of his can justify some expertise on this subject with which he fucking knows nothing about (I said it). And Jon rejects this part of him clearly because he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;well we&rsquo;re our family words so&hellip;&rdquo; and he doesn&rsquo;t fucking mourn Rhaegal (but I saw that he will pet Ghost in the end&hellip; Of course. Mr Ned Stark 2.0 himself)&hellip; He can&rsquo;t say a goddamn thing about this and he doesn&rsquo;t understand this power let alone respect her for it, and it&rsquo;s appalling he&rsquo;d act like he can talk on it lol guess he really IS that jackass at the feast&hellip; Feel like I set myself up for failure right there. I&rsquo;m still disappointed</p>\n\n<p>Oh ha ha he goes into darkness, she emerges from it as he moves to face her. They think this is such Shakespearean shit and it&rsquo;s garbage. The mere suggestion that Daenerys could rampage against thousands of innocent lives is laughable. I know what&rsquo;s coming and I&rsquo;m incredibly upset by this. You know what would truly be subversive at this point? Have Jon speak to Daenerys about this first (why do they let he and Tyrion speak? Lol okay). Let her remain the hero in her own story as she becomes this cartoon villain, and let this be a show where that villain wins. The things we do for love. Then we have to see Jaime as an inversion parallel to her instead of a direct one to Jon but &ldquo;gone evil&rdquo; (eye roll. still a bad fucking story. But I bet it&rsquo;d be remembered much better than this misogyny fest)</p>\n\n<p>Jon just had his first comment. I think this is just about letting Jon yell at her in the writer&rsquo;s demand to make him the only morally just character. He has to win and also we love yelling at women. Jon doesn\u2019t yell often\u2026so this is very uncomfortable. Men yelling at women really is a nasty thing</p>\n\n<p>Jon&rsquo;s privilege informs this so much. She has seen slavery and depravity in a way he hasn&rsquo;t, he doesn&rsquo;t recognise white supremacy. They made her return to the dothraki promise of Drogo&rsquo;s will to say that she sees every enemy as this enemy, an enemy to humanity. Jon refuses to see the degrees to which this is true</p>\n\n<p>Wow&hellip; Jon&rsquo;s gonna use her own words to justify this murder (that he\u2019s always known what was right) and that is THE maximum manpain you could&rsquo;ve achieved with this action! Literally! He&rsquo;s now like damn she&rsquo;s good she just can&rsquo;t see she&rsquo;s bad but I can and she&rsquo;s says I&rsquo;m good and it&rsquo;s how I know she&rsquo;s good and I love her enough to kill her wow wow wowies imagine being this desperate to have a life story about pain when you really know nothing of it come on white dude writers</p>\n\n<p>LOL YOU&rsquo;RE KIDDING ME. &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll always be my queen. Now and always,&rdquo; kisses her fervently, looks pained&hellip; And stabs her with his face down her throat. I figured she&rsquo;d die in his arms&hellip; Didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d fucking stab her while kissing her. And you\u2019ve turned his \u201cyou are my queen\u201d into some stand-in for \u201cI love you,\u201d as it is his expression of devotion to her and of his acceptance of her power over him when he knows she\u2019s most troubled by his threat to that power\u2026Disgusting. He\u2019s KISSING her as he MURDERS her. Ok. Gotta have one last taste huh jonny boy</p>\n\n<p>Daenerys dies because she chooses the Nice Guy over Daario Naharis and that&rsquo;s tea. Sadly the writers misunderstood that Jon is actually just a nice guy. So why give them this pain jesus christ why do this to me too wtf???</p>\n\n<p>Damn what a shock she has no final words, they fall to the ground, Jon cradles her and cries. Cause I know y'all want me to not be pissed you&rsquo;ve done this to Dany but to be sad Jon murders a woman he&rsquo;s in love with. Bullshit. Which is a real tragedy because I adore kit and I do feel for him and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s performing incredibly but I can&rsquo;t move beyond my rage as Dany to appreciate his grief as Jon but I don&rsquo;t know if I can ever watch this again to give him that opportunity</p>\n\n<p>They have Jon be in such misery, such heartbreak over this action&hellip;but they don&rsquo;t show his face. They don&rsquo;t focus on him. Tyrion is focused on when he&rsquo;s grieving but Jon, no, it&rsquo;s on Dany&rsquo;s corpse. Her body is our display and his pain is merely window dressing. His sorrow isn&rsquo;t respected. It&rsquo;s the tragedy of it all, this widened shot pulled back that shows the throne behind her with the keep&rsquo;s walls fallen to the ground, Jon holding her limp body close to him so small in the corner of the shot. Y'all don&rsquo;t care about his sorrow. You just care that you made him experience it. I feel terribly for these actors and these characters. Why are they doing this to us</p>\n\n<p>Literally the dragon is out of character. Drogon opens the fuck up to destroy Jaime\u2019s life during that loot train battle when Jaime even conceives of trying to take her life. He would not allow Jon to live. Drogon really only gets a consciousness subplot when it&rsquo;s about saving Jon&hellip; And I guess they had him scream at Viserion to say, I reject this heritage of mine, instead of just, I am willing to die for my cause. He gets huffy at Drogon in the same way like he&rsquo;s gonna square up. He should&rsquo;ve been burnt right then and there but apparently Drogon thinks the chase for the throne killed her and that destroying her seat of power is the only closure he wants, he has no need to destroy the man whose blade is in her gut&hellip;who lulled her into a false sense of security over how much he loves her&hellip;bye. that\u2019s galaxy brain Drogon and it\u2019s whack. Kill jon too wtf</p>\n\n<p>Fucking really they just got me pissed with Arya. Girl shut the fuck up. Yara is my fucking girl though. She stans Daenerys and has her back. A TRUE lesbian icon to the fucking END</p>\n\n<p>Davos LITERALLY just went, &ldquo;assimilate to our culture&rdquo; to Grey Worm like what did I say lol. What a joke</p>\n\n<p>Why is Sam here though. He&rsquo;s a random fucking loser</p>\n\n<p>Who are some of these people. There\u2019s that random no name prince from Dorne</p>\n\n<p>OH I FORGOT. HOW CONVENIENT DANY BURNS SAM&rsquo;S BROTHER TO LEAVE HIM LORD OF WHATEVER I GUESS bye!</p>\n\n<p>Wow. Tyrion staying alive cause &ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting justice&rdquo;&hellip; As if he has to feel bad, but think angrily &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let them be like Daenerys&rdquo; to all those he\u2019s just so burdened to be advising and this is fucking shit. This is justice? Tyrion is still the power in Westeros. Jon and Tyrion shouldn&rsquo;t escape Unsullied justice, which was shown to be swift. Come on. Drogon is mourning as well&hellip; Come on. </p>\n\n<p>Oh my god. He even wears his hair down now because he has returned to Jon Snow, Ned Stark&rsquo;s role as queenslayer fulfilled. I fucking SAID this was about <a href=\"http://%E2%80%9D\" https:>making Ned see Jaime\u2019s despair and be confronted with his same conflict</a>. I fuckin said it and I\u2019m goddamn right. Jon should\u2019ve been a dragon on resurrection. I would feel so much more content. This is disgusting. </p>\n\n<p>With Bronn it&rsquo;s like, the story of nepotism&hellip;so damn clear lol. Daenerys, a revolutionary, couldn&rsquo;t compare to this system of bullshit. Cool beans</p>\n\n<p>And let&rsquo;s be real, the moves of Sansa and Bran: calculated! Even got Arya the NK kill!  And lol bran the broken&hellip; The propaganda</p>\n\n<p>This small council conversation is the most boring conversation this show has presented me about power. Instead imagine Daenerys ruling and speaking of being mother to all with Jon behind her instead of this lol. She had a chant and then a monologue of delusion as her two scenes&hellip;when she had JUST said to this man that she only had fear? He rejected her then. If she is truly fire and blood why doesn&rsquo;t she have rage here instead of clearly coded psychosis&hellip;She may love him sure, but she can crush that inside of her just like Jon did. Where is my mhysa. Done so fucking dirty. She just begs him to be her partner in the new world she wants to usher forth. But she <i>just fuckin went balls out bonkers cause he wouldn&rsquo;t be with her</i>. Which fucking is it? <i>What do yall want me to believe she wants?</i> Anyway fuck that a final monologue of hers about being mother to all with her stupid man behind her is way more fucking satisfying!</p>\n\n<p>You want me to believe Bran is doing this for the good of the realm&hellip; Abdicating his magical power as the 3ER to reign in peace as a good king will, with a council of great advisors. No. It was calculated, he&rsquo;s a punk bitch, and this is all status quo bullshit. White men gotta be in power huh. Bronn? Sam? Tyrion, who&rsquo;s failed at this repeatedly? Davos, a true good egg. The rest of y'all? Fuck outta here. Dany\u2019s magical power as mother of dragons is infinitely superior. I don\u2019t make the rules.</p>\n\n<p>Y'all have to realise&hellip;that conversation of the new small council was SO boring. I literally could not pay attention. None of these men have political acumen (meanwhile, all the women they\u2019ve killed off\u2026). But you can&rsquo;t say that was what the story was about, propping up in power people not within the system&rsquo;s clutches&hellip;when Sansa is out there. In victory. She tells Jon she HAD to do this. The Stark&rsquo;s needed to push Daenerys into madness so that they might justify ousting her. They use the man in their family without the Stark name to put a dagger through her body&hellip; disgusting. If I&rsquo;m meant to feel they&rsquo;ve won, that the Stark&rsquo;s have proved themselves&hellip; I can&rsquo;t. This is truly a vulture type of deal. They couldn&rsquo;t stand the be in tandem with Daenerys but knew they couldn&rsquo;t beat her&hellip;so they destroyed her. I&rsquo;m so reviled. I&rsquo;m so&hellip; disgusted. Just really. What the fuck. This is no victory. This is capitalism and white supremacy living in harmony with patriarchy and I&rsquo;m grossed the FUCK out at the implications of this.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway I got so bored I stopped watching and had to rewind cause I think it might&rsquo;ve ended with Jon I saw a cloak&hellip;.</p>\n\n<p>Okay wait I realised something. Sending him to the Wall fulfills what we wish would&rsquo;ve happened to Ned Stark against Joffrey&hellip; But they&rsquo;re so damn insistent on giving Jon a happy ending that he gets to go further North with Tormund and Ghost. Meanwhile&hellip; Daenerys didn&rsquo;t even get to see it coming. She was blinded by delusion to begin with and then she is kissed passionately by Jon. It&rsquo;s bad and woman hating!</p>\n\n<p>But so the Starks played calculated against the Targs! Lol. Cause it really was about the names, the &ldquo;game&rdquo;&hellip; Jon is a dragon in love with another dragon and Bran tells him to make him have these doubts about himself and his existence (especially troubling after having been murdered. Tyrion even brings it up in this episode as one of only I believe two instances for Jon to ever comment on it..). Jon makes a mistake thinking Sansa isn&rsquo;t playing so he tells them. Immediately Daenerys had her life threatened and she was being isolated and feeling very alienated then you made her lose Jon cause you knew maybe he could embrace being a dragon and yall like no, winter is coming, so your dumb brother managed to fall in love with her and that actually makes it better, easier, Daenerys is pushed into this &ldquo;only fear&rdquo;, fire and blood mind set. At this point it&rsquo;s strange to me Jon wouldn&rsquo;t comfort her&hellip; So. This is a fucking train wreck honestly.</p>\n\n<p>ALL THE POV SHOTS IN MONTAGE. YOU LITERALLY MADE IT ONLY ABOUT THE STARK&rsquo;S. what a subversion of expectations. I kind of forgot to get invested in other interesting characters simultaneously oh wait</p>\n\n<p>Also I would watch the shit out of an unsullied spinoff with grey worm but that is literally the only one I would be interested in ever. At all. Unless it&rsquo;s a different world as this one (Jaime&rsquo;s hand grew back so&hellip;I think we can say this is an alternate timeline&hellip;the bad one) </p>\n\n<p>Honestly castle black is a great purgatory for Jon but you don&rsquo;t make him be punished&hellip;.I hate it. He gets his heaven, she her hell&hellip; Jon has been raised into self loathing enough to accept that he killed the woman he loved and is still alive so he gets to move on&hellip; She is <i>dead</i>. We barely see him speak on this. just cries to himself for a little bit and I guess now he&rsquo;s good</p>\n\n<p>I just, like, this is totally imperialist. Sansa knew what would happen, Bran clearly knew, Arya\u2019s a tool so it&rsquo;s actually cool she goes away but damn to just play Jon like that wrow bran!! The level of unprofessionalism! Honestly though&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>Also we were clearly given the ridiculous denial of affection with Ghost previously to upset us enough that we cheer for this moment of reunion and forgive Jon&rsquo;s actions. He was tempted by the dragon you see but then she was crazy so he killed her and they died out with him&hellip; Sansa queen&hellip;bran king&hellip; laugh. But really the denial of Jon saying goodbye to Ghost previously was so typical. They bait us into emotional responses, they deny us joy just to try to redirect it somewhere else. It&rsquo;s a poisonous and disrespectful point of view to write from</p>\n\n<p>Disturbingly Jon was questioned about Sansa being jealous of him by enough people&hellip; Her smirk is..hmm.. somewhat telling.. Don\u2019t like how they took her character. Why is she a back-dealing, manipulating woman whose goal is to grab power. to Jon&rsquo;s detriment no less&hellip;the destruction of his being, really, cause he really is a soft tender little fuck deep down that just wants to find love</p>\n\n<p>THE CINEMATIC PARALLEL OF SANSA GETTING CROWNED WITH CERSEI&rsquo;S LOL. game changer. I DO respect her but I cannot support you over the mother of dragons for running the throne I&rsquo;m sorry! But it&rsquo;s ridiculous to conceive of a Daenerys who wouldn&rsquo;t let the people rule themselves so long as they all adhered to some common understandings. Like&hellip; why wouldn&rsquo;t she? And if she doesn&rsquo;t, Jon gets to stay happy not guilty forever but go off I guess&hellip;.</p>\n\n<p>Just saying though. A power move by the Stark&rsquo;s I COULD dig but you gave Dany so much pov I couldn&rsquo;t help but root for her ;) no really though Sansa didn&rsquo;t get to spend time playing the game&hellip; So it&rsquo;s just abrupt. And honestly I would&rsquo;ve preferred the revolutionary girl than the Stark girl. Stark&rsquo;s are kind of lacking for me then they go on about honour&hellip; Daenerys goes on about justice. Jon coulda been a bridge but y'all chose one and it wasn&rsquo;t the side with dragons&hellip; Maybe that&rsquo;s why you hyped her up and got the dragons so cool just to make it all mean nothing cause Ned Stark really is the hero and the Stark&rsquo;s have retribution. Daenerys is just higher on the coolness factor but I&rsquo;m saying they could all be simultaneously in power and it would be good storytelling! They didn&rsquo;t need to resort to killing one another I mean&hellip; boring&hellip; Let women uplift women bye</p>\n\n<p>Jon SMILING as his last character shot??? So he&rsquo;s FINE. he&rsquo;s at PEACE. what the fuck??? You want me to believe he can find contentment so soon after this trauma (let alone at all hello). He&rsquo;s of course our last hero&hellip; I&rsquo;m so fucking annoyed lol. This man, who I adore truly with all my heart, he should never get to feel a single moment of joy ever again in his undead fuckin zombie-ass life. That neither Drogon nor Grey Worm should&rsquo;ve let him keep anyways.</p>\n\n<p>But so um yeah this really is trash. How many people rooted for this liberator, as Tyrion calls her, because that&rsquo;s a great story. And with dragons no less! Instead you reward the people who are the epitome of xenophobic. They only trust northerners, Stark&rsquo;s only trust Stark&rsquo;s. Jon had to be one again in the end\u2026but we take it away. He fucks off out the COUNTRY cause he\u2019s really just a Snow. I\u2019m asleep</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s really it huh. Can&rsquo;t say I feel a single positive emotion. I&rsquo;m not actually unhappy right now as I read the leaks and knew exactly what this would be. I want to be happy to have gotten a lot right. Just don&rsquo;t care though.</p>\n\n<p>I think a story of liberation, even existing beside the Stark&rsquo;s isolationism, is like insanely better. Why could these women not achieve this? For a name, family words? Boring as shit. </p>\n\n<p>The other cooler timelines in my brain are better thanks</p>\n\n<p>#forthethrone lmfao. Of course&hellip;well house Targaryen now and forever bitches. Not &ldquo;story of how two dragons together make the world go to shit,&rdquo; the one where actually the exact fucking opposite is true specifically because they can control the power of those dragons. Goddamn. Dragon love saves the world and moves us into a brighter, more equal and loving existence. How dare you deny me this wtf</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m like at a state of such rage that I&rsquo;m zen. What a trash heap lol!!! I&rsquo;d have my expectations more subverted if fuckin Robyn Arryn was on the throne&hellip; \ud83e\udd21</p>",
        "reblog": {
            "comment": "<p>after previously having only gotten as far as fuckin that like initial scene of tyrion mourning before having to write <a href=\"https://forthemetamyguy.tumblr.com/post/185046644943/so-they-made-jaime-fuck-over-brienne-so-that\">yet another fuckin dissertation about how this is absurd and yall hate women</a>\u2026 here we fuckin go. onto the rest. don\u2019t worry im not done complaining about the political ramifications of this garbage :)</p>\n\n<p>ok I got literally like a second further in and Daenerys shows up\u2026 They have her proud of this. All I\u2019ve seen is a look on her face and it\u2019s\u2026bad. As if she wanted only victory. As if this is something she would revel in having done. Like seriously??? Her Dothraki people are cheering in conquest and she is going to experience no remorse for this destruction? She caged her children when they burned one child! That this act moves her to horror hasn\u2019t changed! Y'all really just want me to be okay with Jon killing her. You want him to be so just. He gets to be upset at her for this. That evil bitch who just wants power AND the mad girl of her mad father. It\u2019s revolting. The rage and sorrow I feel at this\u2026 \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e Indeed Emilia</p>\n\n<p>Oh hold up! I unpaused! She praises them because they\u2019ve fulfilled Drogo\u2019s will! Just when I thought it was enough of a low, she also fulfills the role of her abuser and does her husband\u2019s (ha ha the same guy) final bidding. Amazing! </p>\n\n<p>It occurs to me. Paused again as tyrion appears. Jon has no clue what she\u2019s saying. For all he knows, she\u2019s saying kill them all kill them all as they touch their spears to the ground but really she\u2019s just saying to grey worm, I am giving you this position of rank and honour which while a different name for it sure it isn\u2019t something to see as anything other than an appointment that is culturally significant. Jon isn\u2019t going to question her on this I guarantee it. He\u2019ll just be like damn they\u2019re so violent. She\u2019s a murderer. I\u2019m going to kill her</p>\n\n<p>Oh my god LOL now that she\u2019s mentioned Winterfell he\u2019s like SHE\u2019S GONNA KILL MY SISTER??? I\u2019M GOING TO KILL HER\u2026 Tyrion is hearing SHE\u2019S GONNA KILL YOU even though a CEILING killed the twins for fucks sake and he isn\u2019t on good terms with either! That is an adaptation change\u2026 But y'all couldn\u2019t change Daenerys having tHe MoRaL hIgH gRoUnD?? Damn.. but yeah uhhhhh bad. Shame y'all killed that massively impressive polyglot of a translator huh. </p>\n\n<p>These guys have become so lame. They\u2019re so wrapped up in their white guy hero costumes that they decide she\u2019s unfit to rule, so she acts in an impulsive way to get that rule, then they kill her\u2026 One is going to be, ostensibly, the ruler (Ned was, Tywin was\u2026 Tyrion already was) and one is going to fuck off into a content nothingness for himself. This is infuriating. Cersei wouldn\u2019t listen to her (barely existent) advisors in a show of her power but Daenerys did consult her advisors and relented to them endlessly (while Jon never does and he\u2019s always morally right about his actions) and often they actually failed her. Conveniently now that dude is the true power in westeros, along with miss Queen in the North like why did y'all not change this to the better: Sansa performs her power by playing the Game and becomes hand instead of making her want to be a queen in the end, and uh don\u2019t have this monstrosity of a \u201cwomen go bananas when they\u2019re lonely and grieving\u201d story for Dany and let them have a great rule together. Jon can be king man why is it all or nothing\u2026but then Jon\u2019s trauma for this forces him to not seat the throne so I\u2019m supposed to feel like it\u2019s okay cause neither of them \u201cwin\u201d? Bran does?! With TYRION AND BRONN AND FUCKING SAM TARLY AND FUCKING B R O N N ?! like DUDE\u2026</p>\n\n<p>They don\u2019t even let Cersei go out cool. And they make Daenerys\u2019 end traumatic. So we as women get absolutely no satisfaction (Sansa is one (1) woman in power but it doesn\u2019t even feel earned because she has no POV anymore\u2026but even if so, this would not be satisying enough to negate the other shit). We don\u2019t get to be killed off in a satisfying way as the villain, but we get to be the traumatic hero deaths of a woman dying after her son like Cat or by the hands of her lover like Dany I mean goddamn. Jaime, Ned, they die FOR love. Cat, Dany\u2026they\u2019re killed BECAUSE of love, because their trauma is somehow most compelling when it\u2019s when they\u2019re in agony emotionally while for men it\u2019s when they\u2019re at peace\u2026 Holy fucking shit</p>\n\n<p>IM LAUGHING. JON LITERALLY JUST SAID THE MORAL OF THE STORY. he\u2019s like \u201cwhen you\u2019re born you aren\u2019t stamped with your family words, and she\u2019s not her father\u201d\u2026 Tyrion responds like, she\u2019s a conquering tyrant go kill her\u2026 But Jon that\u2019s what you seal the deal for when you kill her!!! It really fucking is about family words. And how she is now behaving, this woman who looks nothing like the woman we\u2019ve always seen even if she\u2019s speaking Dothraki. She is reduced to her father, who is crazy, and her family words \u201cfire and blood\u201d (even though her birthing dragons literally through fire and blood wasn\u2019t violence and destruction, it was sacrifice and creation\u2026but who cares when you can say \u201cfire bad\u201d). Jesus fucking Christ I hate every moment of this. this is the conversation you were saving Jon for? Why the fuck didn\u2019t he have shit to say in that scene with Daenerys last week</p>\n\n<p>Tyrion literally just said, of Jon riding a dragon, \u201cyou\u2019ve had that power\u201d!!!!! COME ON. You really are just desperate to steal her power away from her. The power of her CHILDREN, as if this last name of his can justify some expertise on this subject with which he fucking knows nothing about (I said it). And Jon rejects this part of him clearly because he\u2019s like \u201cwell we\u2019re our family words so\u2026\u201d and he doesn\u2019t fucking mourn Rhaegal (but I saw that he will pet Ghost in the end\u2026 Of course. Mr Ned Stark 2.0 himself)\u2026 He can\u2019t say a goddamn thing about this and he doesn\u2019t understand this power let alone respect her for it, and it\u2019s appalling he\u2019d act like he can talk on it lol guess he really IS that jackass at the feast\u2026 Feel like I set myself up for failure right there. I\u2019m still disappointed</p>\n\n<p>Oh ha ha he goes into darkness, she emerges from it as he moves to face her. They think this is such Shakespearean shit and it\u2019s garbage. The mere suggestion that Daenerys could rampage against thousands of innocent lives is laughable. I know what\u2019s coming and I\u2019m incredibly upset by this. You know what would truly be subversive at this point? Have Jon speak to Daenerys about this first (why do they let he and Tyrion speak? Lol okay). Let her remain the hero in her own story as she becomes this cartoon villain, and let this be a show where that villain wins. The things we do for love. Then we have to see Jaime as an inversion parallel to her instead of a direct one to Jon but \u201cgone evil\u201d (eye roll. still a bad fucking story. But I bet it\u2019d be remembered much better than this misogyny fest)</p>\n\n<p>Jon just had his first comment. I think this is just about letting Jon yell at her in the writer\u2019s demand to make him the only morally just character. He has to win and also we love yelling at women. Jon doesn\u2019t yell often\u2026so this is very uncomfortable. Men yelling at women really is a nasty thing</p>\n\n<p>Jon\u2019s privilege informs this so much. She has seen slavery and depravity in a way he hasn\u2019t, he doesn\u2019t recognise white supremacy. They made her return to the dothraki promise of Drogo\u2019s will to say that she sees every enemy as this enemy, an enemy to humanity. Jon refuses to see the degrees to which this is true</p>\n\n<p>Wow\u2026 Jon\u2019s gonna use her own words to justify this murder (that he\u2019s always known what was right) and that is THE maximum manpain you could\u2019ve achieved with this action! Literally! He\u2019s now like damn she\u2019s good she just can\u2019t see she\u2019s bad but I can and she\u2019s says I\u2019m good and it\u2019s how I know she\u2019s good and I love her enough to kill her wow wow wowies imagine being this desperate to have a life story about pain when you really know nothing of it come on white dude writers</p>\n\n<p>LOL YOU\u2019RE KIDDING ME. \u201cyou\u2019ll always be my queen. Now and always,\u201d kisses her fervently, looks pained\u2026 And stabs her with his face down her throat. I figured she\u2019d die in his arms\u2026 Didn\u2019t think he\u2019d fucking stab her while kissing her. And you\u2019ve turned his \u201cyou are my queen\u201d into some stand-in for \u201cI love you,\u201d as it is his expression of devotion to her and of his acceptance of her power over him when he knows she\u2019s most troubled by his threat to that power\u2026Disgusting. He\u2019s KISSING her as he MURDERS her. Ok. Gotta have one last taste huh jonny boy</p>\n\n<p>Daenerys dies because she chooses the Nice Guy over Daario Naharis and that\u2019s tea. Sadly the writers misunderstood that Jon is actually just a nice guy. So why give them this pain jesus christ why do this to me too wtf???</p>\n\n<p>Damn what a shock she has no final words, they fall to the ground, Jon cradles her and cries. Cause I know y'all want me to not be pissed you\u2019ve done this to Dany but to be sad Jon murders a woman he\u2019s in love with. Bullshit. Which is a real tragedy because I adore kit and I do feel for him and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s performing incredibly but I can\u2019t move beyond my rage as Dany to appreciate his grief as Jon but I don\u2019t know if I can ever watch this again to give him that opportunity</p>\n\n<p>They have Jon be in such misery, such heartbreak over this action\u2026but they don\u2019t show his face. They don\u2019t focus on him. Tyrion is focused on when he\u2019s grieving but Jon, no, it\u2019s on Dany\u2019s corpse. Her body is our display and his pain is merely window dressing. His sorrow isn\u2019t respected. It\u2019s the tragedy of it all, this widened shot pulled back that shows the throne behind her with the keep\u2019s walls fallen to the ground, Jon holding her limp body close to him so small in the corner of the shot. Y'all don\u2019t care about his sorrow. You just care that you made him experience it. I feel terribly for these actors and these characters. Why are they doing this to us</p>\n\n<p>Literally the dragon is out of character. Drogon opens the fuck up to destroy Jaime\u2019s life during that loot train battle when Jaime even conceives of trying to take her life. He would not allow Jon to live. Drogon really only gets a consciousness subplot when it\u2019s about saving Jon\u2026 And I guess they had him scream at Viserion to say, I reject this heritage of mine, instead of just, I am willing to die for my cause. He gets huffy at Drogon in the same way like he\u2019s gonna square up. He should\u2019ve been burnt right then and there but apparently Drogon thinks the chase for the throne killed her and that destroying her seat of power is the only closure he wants, he has no need to destroy the man whose blade is in her gut\u2026who lulled her into a false sense of security over how much he loves her\u2026bye. that\u2019s galaxy brain Drogon and it\u2019s whack. Kill jon too wtf</p>\n\n<p>Fucking really they just got me pissed with Arya. Girl shut the fuck up. Yara is my fucking girl though. She stans Daenerys and has her back. A TRUE lesbian icon to the fucking END</p>\n\n<p>Davos LITERALLY just went, \u201cassimilate to our culture\u201d to Grey Worm like what did I say lol. What a joke</p>\n\n<p>Why is Sam here though. He\u2019s a random fucking loser</p>\n\n<p>Who are some of these people. There\u2019s that random no name prince from Dorne</p>\n\n<p>OH I FORGOT. HOW CONVENIENT DANY BURNS SAM\u2019S BROTHER TO LEAVE HIM LORD OF WHATEVER I GUESS bye!</p>\n\n<p>Wow. Tyrion staying alive cause \u201cHe\u2019s getting justice\u201d\u2026 As if he has to feel bad, but think angrily \u201cdon\u2019t let them be like Daenerys\u201d to all those he\u2019s just so burdened to be advising and this is fucking shit. This is justice? Tyrion is still the power in Westeros. Jon and Tyrion shouldn\u2019t escape Unsullied justice, which was shown to be swift. Come on. Drogon is mourning as well\u2026 Come on. </p>\n\n<p>Oh my god. He even wears his hair down now because he has returned to Jon Snow, Ned Stark\u2019s role as queenslayer fulfilled. I fucking SAID this was about <a href=\"http://%E2%80%9D\" https:>making Ned see Jaime\u2019s despair and be confronted with his same conflict</a>. I fuckin said it and I\u2019m goddamn right. Jon should\u2019ve been a dragon on resurrection. I would feel so much more content. This is disgusting. </p>\n\n<p>With Bronn it\u2019s like, the story of nepotism\u2026so damn clear lol. Daenerys, a revolutionary, couldn\u2019t compare to this system of bullshit. Cool beans</p>\n\n<p>And let\u2019s be real, the moves of Sansa and Bran: calculated! Even got Arya the NK kill!  And lol bran the broken\u2026 The propaganda</p>\n\n<p>This small council conversation is the most boring conversation this show has presented me about power. Instead imagine Daenerys ruling and speaking of being mother to all with Jon behind her instead of this lol. She had a chant and then a monologue of delusion as her two scenes\u2026when she had JUST said to this man that she only had fear? He rejected her then. If she is truly fire and blood why doesn\u2019t she have rage here instead of clearly coded psychosis\u2026She may love him sure, but she can crush that inside of her just like Jon did. Where is my mhysa. Done so fucking dirty. She just begs him to be her partner in the new world she wants to usher forth. But she <i>just fuckin went balls out bonkers cause he wouldn\u2019t be with her</i>. Which fucking is it? <i>What do yall want me to believe she wants?</i> Anyway fuck that a final monologue of hers about being mother to all with her stupid man behind her is way more fucking satisfying!</p>\n\n<p>You want me to believe Bran is doing this for the good of the realm\u2026 Abdicating his magical power as the 3ER to reign in peace as a good king will, with a council of great advisors. No. It was calculated, he\u2019s a punk bitch, and this is all status quo bullshit. White men gotta be in power huh. Bronn? Sam? Tyrion, who\u2019s failed at this repeatedly? Davos, a true good egg. The rest of y'all? Fuck outta here. Dany\u2019s magical power as mother of dragons is infinitely superior. I don\u2019t make the rules.</p>\n\n<p>Y'all have to realise\u2026that conversation of the new small council was SO boring. I literally could not pay attention. None of these men have political acumen (meanwhile, all the women they\u2019ve killed off\u2026). But you can\u2019t say that was what the story was about, propping up in power people not within the system\u2019s clutches\u2026when Sansa is out there. In victory. She tells Jon she HAD to do this. The Stark\u2019s needed to push Daenerys into madness so that they might justify ousting her. They use the man in their family without the Stark name to put a dagger through her body\u2026 disgusting. If I\u2019m meant to feel they\u2019ve won, that the Stark\u2019s have proved themselves\u2026 I can\u2019t. This is truly a vulture type of deal. They couldn\u2019t stand the be in tandem with Daenerys but knew they couldn\u2019t beat her\u2026so they destroyed her. I\u2019m so reviled. I\u2019m so\u2026 disgusted. Just really. What the fuck. This is no victory. This is capitalism and white supremacy living in harmony with patriarchy and I\u2019m grossed the FUCK out at the implications of this.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway I got so bored I stopped watching and had to rewind cause I think it might\u2019ve ended with Jon I saw a cloak\u2026.</p>\n\n<p>Okay wait I realised something. Sending him to the Wall fulfills what we wish would\u2019ve happened to Ned Stark against Joffrey\u2026 But they\u2019re so damn insistent on giving Jon a happy ending that he gets to go further North with Tormund and Ghost. Meanwhile\u2026 Daenerys didn\u2019t even get to see it coming. She was blinded by delusion to begin with and then she is kissed passionately by Jon. It\u2019s bad and woman hating!</p>\n\n<p>But so the Starks played calculated against the Targs! Lol. Cause it really was about the names, the \u201cgame\u201d\u2026 Jon is a dragon in love with another dragon and Bran tells him to make him have these doubts about himself and his existence (especially troubling after having been murdered. Tyrion even brings it up in this episode as one of only I believe two instances for Jon to ever comment on it..). Jon makes a mistake thinking Sansa isn\u2019t playing so he tells them. Immediately Daenerys had her life threatened and she was being isolated and feeling very alienated then you made her lose Jon cause you knew maybe he could embrace being a dragon and yall like no, winter is coming, so your dumb brother managed to fall in love with her and that actually makes it better, easier, Daenerys is pushed into this \u201conly fear\u201d, fire and blood mind set. At this point it\u2019s strange to me Jon wouldn\u2019t comfort her\u2026 So. This is a fucking train wreck honestly.</p>\n\n<p>ALL THE POV SHOTS IN MONTAGE. YOU LITERALLY MADE IT ONLY ABOUT THE STARK\u2019S. what a subversion of expectations. I kind of forgot to get invested in other interesting characters simultaneously oh wait</p>\n\n<p>Also I would watch the shit out of an unsullied spinoff with grey worm but that is literally the only one I would be interested in ever. At all. Unless it\u2019s a different world as this one (Jaime\u2019s hand grew back so\u2026I think we can say this is an alternate timeline\u2026the bad one) </p>\n\n<p>Honestly castle black is a great purgatory for Jon but you don\u2019t make him be punished\u2026.I hate it. He gets his heaven, she her hell\u2026 Jon has been raised into self loathing enough to accept that he killed the woman he loved and is still alive so he gets to move on\u2026 She is <i>dead</i>. We barely see him speak on this. just cries to himself for a little bit and I guess now he\u2019s good</p>\n\n<p>I just, like, this is totally imperialist. Sansa knew what would happen, Bran clearly knew, Arya\u2019s a tool so it\u2019s actually cool she goes away but damn to just play Jon like that wrow bran!! The level of unprofessionalism! Honestly though\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Also we were clearly given the ridiculous denial of affection with Ghost previously to upset us enough that we cheer for this moment of reunion and forgive Jon\u2019s actions. He was tempted by the dragon you see but then she was crazy so he killed her and they died out with him\u2026 Sansa queen\u2026bran king\u2026 laugh. But really the denial of Jon saying goodbye to Ghost previously was so typical. They bait us into emotional responses, they deny us joy just to try to redirect it somewhere else. It\u2019s a poisonous and disrespectful point of view to write from</p>\n\n<p>Disturbingly Jon was questioned about Sansa being jealous of him by enough people\u2026 Her smirk is..hmm.. somewhat telling.. Don\u2019t like how they took her character. Why is she a back-dealing, manipulating woman whose goal is to grab power. to Jon\u2019s detriment no less\u2026the destruction of his being, really, cause he really is a soft tender little fuck deep down that just wants to find love</p>\n\n<p>THE CINEMATIC PARALLEL OF SANSA GETTING CROWNED WITH CERSEI\u2019S LOL. game changer. I DO respect her but I cannot support you over the mother of dragons for running the throne I\u2019m sorry! But it\u2019s ridiculous to conceive of a Daenerys who wouldn\u2019t let the people rule themselves so long as they all adhered to some common understandings. Like\u2026 why wouldn\u2019t she? And if she doesn\u2019t, Jon gets to stay happy not guilty forever but go off I guess\u2026.</p>\n\n<p>Just saying though. A power move by the Stark\u2019s I COULD dig but you gave Dany so much pov I couldn\u2019t help but root for her ;) no really though Sansa didn\u2019t get to spend time playing the game\u2026 So it\u2019s just abrupt. And honestly I would\u2019ve preferred the revolutionary girl than the Stark girl. Stark\u2019s are kind of lacking for me then they go on about honour\u2026 Daenerys goes on about justice. Jon coulda been a bridge but y'all chose one and it wasn\u2019t the side with dragons\u2026 Maybe that\u2019s why you hyped her up and got the dragons so cool just to make it all mean nothing cause Ned Stark really is the hero and the Stark\u2019s have retribution. Daenerys is just higher on the coolness factor but I\u2019m saying they could all be simultaneously in power and it would be good storytelling! They didn\u2019t need to resort to killing one another I mean\u2026 boring\u2026 Let women uplift women bye</p>\n\n<p>Jon SMILING as his last character shot??? So he\u2019s FINE. he\u2019s at PEACE. what the fuck??? You want me to believe he can find contentment so soon after this trauma (let alone at all hello). He\u2019s of course our last hero\u2026 I\u2019m so fucking annoyed lol. This man, who I adore truly with all my heart, he should never get to feel a single moment of joy ever again in his undead fuckin zombie-ass life. That neither Drogon nor Grey Worm should\u2019ve let him keep anyways.</p>\n\n<p>But so um yeah this really is trash. How many people rooted for this liberator, as Tyrion calls her, because that\u2019s a great story. And with dragons no less! Instead you reward the people who are the epitome of xenophobic. They only trust northerners, Stark\u2019s only trust Stark\u2019s. Jon had to be one again in the end\u2026but we take it away. He fucks off out the COUNTRY cause he\u2019s really just a Snow. I\u2019m asleep</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s really it huh. Can\u2019t say I feel a single positive emotion. I\u2019m not actually unhappy right now as I read the leaks and knew exactly what this would be. I want to be happy to have gotten a lot right. Just don\u2019t care though.</p>\n\n<p>I think a story of liberation, even existing beside the Stark\u2019s isolationism, is like insanely better. Why could these women not achieve this? For a name, family words? Boring as shit. </p>\n\n<p>The other cooler timelines in my brain are better thanks</p>\n\n<p>#forthethrone lmfao. Of course\u2026well house Targaryen now and forever bitches. Not \u201cstory of how two dragons together make the world go to shit,\u201d the one where actually the exact fucking opposite is true specifically because they can control the power of those dragons. Goddamn. Dragon love saves the world and moves us into a brighter, more equal and loving existence. How dare you deny me this wtf</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m like at a state of such rage that I\u2019m zen. What a trash heap lol!!! I\u2019d have my expectations more subverted if fuckin Robyn Arryn was on the throne\u2026 \ud83e\udd21</p>",

All I\u2019ve seen is a look on her face and it\u2019s\u2026bad. As if she wanted only victory. As if this is something she would revel in having done. Like seriously??? Her Dothraki people are cheering in conquest and she is going to experience no remorse for this destruction? She caged her children when they burned one child! That this act moves her to horror hasn\u2019t changed! Y'all really just want me to be okay with Jon killing her. You want him to be so just. He gets to be upset at her for this. That evil bitch who just wants power AND the mad girl of her mad father. It\u2019s revolting. The rage and sorrow I feel at this\u2026 \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e Indeed Emilia</p>\n\n<p>Oh hold up! I unpaused! She praises them because they\u2019ve fulfilled Drogo\u2019s will! Just when I thought it was enough of a low, she also fulfills the role of her abuser and does her husband\u2019s (ha ha the same guy) final bidding. Amazing! </p>\n\n<p>It occurs to me. Paused again as tyrion appears. Jon has no clue what she\u2019s saying. For all he knows, she\u2019s saying kill them all kill them all as they touch their spears to the ground but really she\u2019s just saying to grey worm, I am giving you this position of rank and honour which while a different name for it sure it isn\u2019t something to see as anything other than an appointment that is culturally significant. Jon isn\u2019t going to question her on this I guarantee it. He\u2019ll just be like damn they\u2019re so violent. She\u2019s a murderer. I\u2019m going to kill her</p>\n\n<p>Oh my god LOL now that she\u2019s mentioned Winterfell he\u2019s like SHE\u2019S GONNA KILL MY SISTER??? I\u2019M GOING TO KILL HER\u2026 Tyrion is hearing SHE\u2019S GONNA KILL YOU even though a CEILING killed the twins for fucks sake and he isn\u2019t on good terms with either! That is an adaptation change\u2026 But y'all couldn\u2019t change Daenerys having tHe MoRaL hIgH gRoUnD?? Damn.. but yeah uhhhhh bad. Shame y'all killed that massively impressive polyglot of a translator huh. </p>\n\n<p>These guys have become so lame. They\u2019re so wrapped up in their white guy hero costumes that they decide she\u2019s unfit to rule, so she acts in an impulsive way to get that rule, then they kill her\u2026 One is going to be, ostensibly, the ruler (Ned was, Tywin was\u2026 Tyrion already was) and one is going to fuck off into a content nothingness for himself. This is infuriating. Cersei wouldn\u2019t listen to her (barely existent) advisors in a show of her power but Daenerys did consult her advisors and relented to them endlessly (while Jon never does and he\u2019s always morally right about his actions) and often they actually failed her. Conveniently now that dude is the true power in westeros, along with miss Queen in the North like why did y'all not change this to the better: Sansa performs her power by playing the Game and becomes hand instead of making her want to be a queen in the end, and uh don\u2019t have this monstrosity of a \u201cwomen go bananas when they\u2019re lonely and grieving\u201d story for Dany and let them have a great rule together. Jon can be king man why is it all or nothing\u2026but then Jon\u2019s trauma for this forces him to not seat the throne so I\u2019m supposed to feel like it\u2019s okay cause neither of them \u201cwin\u201d? Bran does?! With TYRION AND BRONN AND FUCKING SAM TARLY AND FUCKING B R O N N ?! like DUDE\u2026</p>\n\n<p>They don\u2019t even let Cersei go out cool. And they make Daenerys\u2019 end traumatic. So we as women get absolutely no satisfaction (Sansa is one (1) woman in power but it doesn\u2019t even feel earned because she has no POV anymore\u2026but even if so, this would not be satisying enough to negate the other shit). We don\u2019t get to be killed off in a satisfying way as the villain, but we get to be the traumatic hero deaths of a woman dying after her son like Cat or by the hands of her lover like Dany I mean goddamn. Jaime, Ned, they die FOR love. Cat, Dany\u2026they\u2019re killed BECAUSE of love, because their trauma is somehow most compelling when it\u2019s when they\u2019re in agony emotionally while for men it\u2019s when they\u2019re at peace\u2026 Holy fucking shit</p>\n\n<p>IM LAUGHING. JON LITERALLY JUST SAID THE MORAL OF THE STORY. he\u2019s like \u201cwhen you\u2019re born you aren\u2019t stamped with your family words, and she\u2019s not her father\u201d\u2026 Tyrion responds like, she\u2019s a conquering tyrant go kill her\u2026 But Jon that\u2019s what you seal the deal for when you kill her!!! It really fucking is about family words. And how she is now behaving, this woman who looks nothing like the woman we\u2019ve always seen even if she\u2019s speaking Dothraki. She is reduced to her father, who is crazy, and her family words \u201cfire and blood\u201d (even though her birthing dragons literally through fire and blood wasn\u2019t violence and destruction, it was sacrifice and creation\u2026but who cares when you can say \u201cfire bad\u201d). Jesus fucking Christ I hate every moment of this. this is the conversation you were saving Jon for? Why the fuck didn\u2019t he have shit to say in that scene with Daenerys last week</p>\n\n<p>Tyrion literally just said, of Jon riding a dragon, \u201cyou\u2019ve had that power\u201d!!!!! COME ON. You really are just desperate to steal her power away from her. The power of her CHILDREN, as if this last name of his can justify some expertise on this subject with which he fucking knows nothing about (I said it). And Jon rejects this part of him clearly because he\u2019s like \u201cwell we\u2019re our family words so\u2026\u201d and he doesn\u2019t fucking mourn Rhaegal (but I saw that he will pet Ghost in the end\u2026 Of course. Mr Ned Stark 2.0 himself)\u2026 He can\u2019t say a goddamn thing about this and he doesn\u2019t understand this power let alone respect her for it, and it\u2019s appalling he\u2019d act like he can talk on it lol guess he really IS that jackass at the feast\u2026 Feel like I set myself up for failure right there. I\u2019m still disappointed</p>\n\n<p>Oh ha ha he goes into darkness, she emerges from it as he moves to face her. They think this is such Shakespearean shit and it\u2019s garbage. The mere suggestion that Daenerys could rampage against thousands of innocent lives is laughable. I know what\u2019s coming and I\u2019m incredibly upset by this. You know what would truly be subversive at this point? Have Jon speak to Daenerys about this first (why do they let he and Tyrion speak? Lol okay). Let her remain the hero in her own story as she becomes this cartoon villain, and let this be a show where that villain wins. The things we do for love. Then we have to see Jaime as an inversion parallel to her instead of a direct one to Jon but \u201cgone evil\u201d (eye roll. still a bad fucking story. But I bet it\u2019d be remembered much better than this misogyny fest)</p>\n\n<p>Jon just had his first comment. I think this is just about letting Jon yell at her in the writer\u2019s demand to make him the only morally just character. He has to win and also we love yelling at women. Jon doesn\u2019t yell often\u2026so this is very uncomfortable. Men yelling at women really is a nasty thing</p>\n\n<p>Jon\u2019s privilege informs this so much. She has seen slavery and depravity in a way he hasn\u2019t, he doesn\u2019t recognise white supremacy. They made her return to the dothraki promise of Drogo\u2019s will to say that she sees every enemy as this enemy, an enemy to humanity. Jon refuses to see the degrees to which this is true</p>\n\n<p>Wow\u2026 Jon\u2019s gonna use her own words to justify this murder (that he\u2019s always known what was right) and that is THE maximum manpain you could\u2019ve achieved with this action! Literally! He\u2019s now like damn she\u2019s good she just can\u2019t see she\u2019s bad but I can and she\u2019s says I\u2019m good and it\u2019s how I know she\u2019s good and I love her enough to kill her wow wow wowies imagine being this desperate to have a life story about pain when you really know nothing of it come on white dude writers</p>\n\n<p>LOL YOU\u2019RE KIDDING ME. \u201cyou\u2019ll always be my queen. Now and always,\u201d kisses her fervently, looks pained\u2026 And stabs her with his face down her throat. I figured she\u2019d die in his arms\u2026 Didn\u2019t think he\u2019d fucking stab her while kissing her. And you\u2019ve turned his \u201cyou are my queen\u201d into some stand-in for \u201cI love you,\u201d as it is his expression of devotion to her and of his acceptance of her power over him when he knows she\u2019s most troubled by his threat to that power\u2026Disgusting. He\u2019s KISSING her as he MURDERS her. Ok. Gotta have one last taste huh jonny boy</p>\n\n<p>Daenerys dies because she chooses the Nice Guy over Daario Naharis and that\u2019s tea. Sadly the writers misunderstood that Jon is actually just a nice guy. So why give them this pain jesus christ why do this to me too wtf???</p>\n\n<p>Damn what a shock she has no final words, they fall to the ground, Jon cradles her and cries. Cause I know y'all want me to not be pissed you\u2019ve done this to Dany but to be sad Jon murders a woman he\u2019s in love with. Bullshit. Which is a real tragedy because I adore kit and I do feel for him and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s performing incredibly but I can\u2019t move beyond my rage as Dany to appreciate his grief as Jon but I don\u2019t know if I can ever watch this again to give him that opportunity</p>\n\n<p>They have Jon be in such misery, such heartbreak over this action\u2026but they don\u2019t show his face. They don\u2019t focus on him. Tyrion is focused on when he\u2019s grieving but Jon, no, it\u2019s on Dany\u2019s corpse. Her body is our display and his pain is merely window dressing. His sorrow isn\u2019t respected. It\u2019s the tragedy of it all, this widened shot pulled back that shows the throne behind her with the keep\u2019s walls fallen to the ground, Jon holding her limp body close to him so small in the corner of the shot. Y'all don\u2019t care about his sorrow. You just care that you made him experience it. I feel terribly for these actors and these characters. Why are they doing this to us</p>\n\n<p>Literally the dragon is out of character. Drogon opens the fuck up to destroy Jaime\u2019s life during that loot train battle when Jaime even conceives of trying to take her life. He would not allow Jon to live. Drogon really only gets a consciousness subplot when it\u2019s about saving Jon\u2026 And I guess they had him scream at Viserion to say, I reject this heritage of mine, instead of just, I am willing to die for my cause. He gets huffy at Drogon in the same way like he\u2019s gonna square up. He should\u2019ve been burnt right then and there but apparently Drogon thinks the chase for the throne killed her and that destroying her seat of power is the only closure he wants, he has no need to destroy the man whose blade is in her gut\u2026who lulled her into a false sense of security over how much he loves her\u2026bye. that\u2019s galaxy brain Drogon and it\u2019s whack. Kill jon too wtf</p>\n\n<p>Fucking really they just got me pissed with Arya. Girl shut the fuck up. Yara is my fucking girl though. She stans Daenerys and has her back. A TRUE lesbian icon to the fucking END</p>\n\n<p>Davos LITERALLY just went, \u201cassimilate to our culture\u201d to Grey Worm like what did I say lol. What a joke</p>\n\n<p>Why is Sam here though. He\u2019s a random fucking loser</p>\n\n<p>Who are some of these people. There\u2019s that random no name prince from Dorne</p>\n\n<p>OH I FORGOT. HOW CONVENIENT DANY BURNS SAM\u2019S BROTHER TO LEAVE HIM LORD OF WHATEVER I GUESS bye!</p>\n\n<p>Wow. Tyrion staying alive cause \u201cHe\u2019s getting justice\u201d\u2026 As if he has to feel bad, but think angrily \u201cdon\u2019t let them be like Daenerys\u201d to all those he\u2019s just so burdened to be advising and this is fucking shit. This is justice? Tyrion is still the power in Westeros. Jon and Tyrion shouldn\u2019t escape Unsullied justice, which was shown to be swift. Come on. Drogon is mourning as well\u2026 Come on. </p>\n\n<p>Oh my god. He even wears his hair down now because he has returned to Jon Snow, Ned Stark\u2019s role as queenslayer fulfilled. I fucking SAID this was about <a href=\"http://%E2%80%9D\" https:>making Ned see Jaime\u2019s despair and be confronted with his same conflict</a>. I fuckin said it and I\u2019m goddamn right. Jon should\u2019ve been a dragon on resurrection. I would feel so much more content. This is disgusting. </p>\n\n<p>With Bronn it\u2019s like, the story of nepotism\u2026so damn clear lol. Daenerys, a revolutionary, couldn\u2019t compare to this system of bullshit. Cool beans</p>\n\n<p>And let\u2019s be real, the moves of Sansa and Bran: calculated! Even got Arya the NK kill!  And lol bran the broken\u2026 The propaganda</p>\n\n<p>This small council conversation is the most boring conversation this show has presented me about power. Instead imagine Daenerys ruling and speaking of being mother to all with Jon behind her instead of this lol. She had a chant and then a monologue of delusion as her two scenes\u2026when she had JUST said to this man that she only had fear? He rejected her then. If she is truly fire and blood why doesn\u2019t she have rage here instead of clearly coded psychosis\u2026She may love him sure, but she can crush that inside of her just like Jon did. Where is my mhysa. Done so fucking dirty. She just begs him to be her partner in the new world she wants to usher forth. But she <i>just fuckin went balls out bonkers cause he wouldn\u2019t be with her</i>. Which fucking is it? <i>What do yall want me to believe she wants?</i> Anyway fuck that a final monologue of hers about being mother to all with her stupid man behind her is way more fucking satisfying!</p>\n\n<p>You want me to believe Bran is doing this for the good of the realm\u2026 Abdicating his magical power as the 3ER to reign in peace as a good king will, with a council of great advisors. No. It was calculated, he\u2019s a punk bitch, and this is all status quo bullshit. White men gotta be in power huh. Bronn? Sam? Tyrion, who\u2019s failed at this repeatedly? Davos, a true good egg. The rest of y'all? Fuck outta here. Dany\u2019s magical power as mother of dragons is infinitely superior. I don\u2019t make the rules.</p>\n\n<p>Y'all have to realise\u2026that conversation of the new small council was SO boring. I literally could not pay attention. None of these men have political acumen (meanwhile, all the women they\u2019ve killed off\u2026). But you can\u2019t say that was what the story was about, propping up in power people not within the system\u2019s clutches\u2026when Sansa is out there. In victory. She tells Jon she HAD to do this. The Stark\u2019s needed to push Daenerys into madness so that they might justify ousting her. They use the man in their family without the Stark name to put a dagger through her body\u2026 disgusting. If I\u2019m meant to feel they\u2019ve won, that the Stark\u2019s have proved themselves\u2026 I can\u2019t. This is truly a vulture type of deal. They couldn\u2019t stand the be in tandem with Daenerys but knew they couldn\u2019t beat her\u2026so they destroyed her. I\u2019m so reviled. I\u2019m so\u2026 disgusted. Just really. What the fuck. This is no victory. This is capitalism and white supremacy living in harmony with patriarchy and I\u2019m grossed the FUCK out at the implications of this.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway I got so bored I stopped watching and had to rewind cause I think it might\u2019ve ended with Jon I saw a cloak\u2026.</p>\n\n<p>Okay wait I realised something. Sending him to the Wall fulfills what we wish would\u2019ve happened to Ned Stark against Joffrey\u2026 But they\u2019re so damn insistent on giving Jon a happy ending that he gets to go further North with Tormund and Ghost. Meanwhile\u2026 Daenerys didn\u2019t even get to see it coming. She was blinded by delusion to begin with and then she is kissed passionately by Jon. It\u2019s bad and woman hating!</p>\n\n<p>But so the Starks played calculated against the Targs! Lol. Cause it really was about the names, the \u201cgame\u201d\u2026 Jon is a dragon in love with another dragon and Bran tells him to make him have these doubts about himself and his existence (especially troubling after having been murdered. Tyrion even brings it up in this episode as one of only I believe two instances for Jon to ever comment on it..). Jon makes a mistake thinking Sansa isn\u2019t playing so he tells them. Immediately Daenerys had her life threatened and she was being isolated and feeling very alienated then you made her lose Jon cause you knew maybe he could embrace being a dragon and yall like no, winter is coming, so your dumb brother managed to fall in love with her and that actually makes it better, easier, Daenerys is pushed into this \u201conly fear\u201d, fire and blood mind set. At this point it\u2019s strange to me Jon wouldn\u2019t comfort her\u2026 So. This is a fucking train wreck honestly.</p>\n\n<p>ALL THE POV SHOTS IN MONTAGE. YOU LITERALLY MADE IT ONLY ABOUT THE STARK\u2019S. what a subversion of expectations. I kind of forgot to get invested in other interesting characters simultaneously oh wait</p>\n\n<p>Also I would watch the shit out of an unsullied spinoff with grey worm but that is literally the only one I would be interested in ever. At all. Unless it\u2019s a different world as this one (Jaime\u2019s hand grew back so\u2026I think we can say this is an alternate timeline\u2026the bad one) </p>\n\n<p>Honestly castle black is a great purgatory for Jon but you don\u2019t make him be punished\u2026.I hate it. He gets his heaven, she her hell\u2026 Jon has been raised into self loathing enough to accept that he killed the woman he loved and is still alive so he gets to move on\u2026 She is <i>dead</i>. We barely see him speak on this. just cries to himself for a little bit and I guess now he\u2019s good</p>\n\n<p>I just, like, this is totally imperialist. Sansa knew what would happen, Bran clearly knew, Arya\u2019s a tool so it\u2019s actually cool she goes away but damn to just play Jon like that wrow bran!! The level of unprofessionalism! Honestly though\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Also we were clearly given the ridiculous denial of affection with Ghost previously to upset us enough that we cheer for this moment of reunion and forgive Jon\u2019s actions. He was tempted by the dragon you see but then she was crazy so he killed her and they died out with him\u2026 Sansa queen\u2026bran king\u2026 laugh. But really the denial of Jon saying goodbye to Ghost previously was so typical. They bait us into emotional responses, they deny us joy just to try to redirect it somewhere else. It\u2019s a poisonous and disrespectful point of view to write from</p>\n\n<p>Disturbingly Jon was questioned about Sansa being jealous of him by enough people\u2026 Her smirk is..hmm.. somewhat telling.. Don\u2019t like how they took her character. Why is she a back-dealing, manipulating woman whose goal is to grab power. to Jon\u2019s detriment no less\u2026the destruction of his being, really, cause he really is a soft tender little fuck deep down that just wants to find love</p>\n\n<p>THE CINEMATIC PARALLEL OF SANSA GETTING CROWNED WITH CERSEI\u2019S LOL. game changer. I DO respect her but I cannot support you over the mother of dragons for running the throne I\u2019m sorry! But it\u2019s ridiculous to conceive of a Daenerys who wouldn\u2019t let the people rule themselves so long as they all adhered to some common understandings. Like\u2026 why wouldn\u2019t she? And if she doesn\u2019t, Jon gets to stay happy not guilty forever but go off I guess\u2026.</p>\n\n<p>Just saying though. A power move by the Stark\u2019s I COULD dig but you gave Dany so much pov I couldn\u2019t help but root for her ;) no really though Sansa didn\u2019t get to spend time playing the game\u2026 So it\u2019s just abrupt. And honestly I would\u2019ve preferred the revolutionary girl than the Stark girl. Stark\u2019s are kind of lacking for me then they go on about honour\u2026 Daenerys goes on about justice. Jon coulda been a bridge but y'all chose one and it wasn\u2019t the side with dragons\u2026 Maybe that\u2019s why you hyped her up and got the dragons so cool just to make it all mean nothing cause Ned Stark really is the hero and the Stark\u2019s have retribution. Daenerys is just higher on the coolness factor but I\u2019m saying they could all be simultaneously in power and it would be good storytelling! They didn\u2019t need to resort to killing one another I mean\u2026 boring\u2026 Let women uplift women bye</p>\n\n<p>Jon SMILING as his last character shot??? So he\u2019s FINE. he\u2019s at PEACE. what the fuck??? You want me to believe he can find contentment so soon after this trauma (let alone at all hello). He\u2019s of course our last hero\u2026 I\u2019m so fucking annoyed lol. This man, who I adore truly with all my heart, he should never get to feel a single moment of joy ever again in his undead fuckin zombie-ass life. That neither Drogon nor Grey Worm should\u2019ve let him keep anyways.</p>\n\n<p>But so um yeah this really is trash. How many people rooted for this liberator, as Tyrion calls her, because that\u2019s a great story. And with dragons no less! Instead you reward the people who are the epitome of xenophobic. They only trust northerners, Stark\u2019s only trust Stark\u2019s. Jon had to be one again in the end\u2026but we take it away. He fucks off out the COUNTRY cause he\u2019s really just a Snow. I\u2019m asleep</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s really it huh. Can\u2019t say I feel a single positive emotion. I\u2019m not actually unhappy right now as I read the leaks and knew exactly what this would be. I want to be happy to have gotten a lot right. Just don\u2019t care though.</p>\n\n<p>I think a story of liberation, even existing beside the Stark\u2019s isolationism, is like insanely better. Why could these women not achieve this? For a name, family words? Boring as shit. </p>\n\n<p>The other cooler timelines in my brain are better thanks</p>\n\n<p>#forthethrone lmfao. Of course\u2026well house Targaryen now and forever bitches. Not \u201cstory of how two dragons together make the world go to shit,\u201d the one where actually the exact fucking opposite is true specifically because they can control the power of those dragons. Goddamn. Dragon love saves the world and moves us into a brighter, more equal and loving existence. How dare you deny me this wtf</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m like at a state of such rage that I\u2019m zen. What a trash heap lol!!! I\u2019d have my expectations more subverted if fuckin Robyn Arryn was on the throne\u2026 \ud83e\udd21</p>",
                "content": "<p>after previously having only gotten as far as fuckin that like initial scene of tyrion mourning before having to write <a href=\"https://forthemetamyguy.tumblr.com/post/185046644943/so-they-made-jaime-fuck-over-brienne-so-that\">yet another fuckin dissertation about how this is absurd and yall hate women</a>&hellip; here we fuckin go. onto the rest. don&rsquo;t worry im not done complaining about the political ramifications of this garbage :)</p>\n\n<p>ok I got literally like a second further in and Daenerys shows up&hellip; They have her proud of this. All I&rsquo;ve seen is a look on her face and it&rsquo;s&hellip;bad. As if she wanted only victory. As if this is something she would revel in having done. Like seriously??? Her Dothraki people are cheering in conquest and she is going to experience no remorse for this destruction? She caged her children when they burned one child! That this act moves her to horror hasn&rsquo;t changed! Y'all really just want me to be okay with Jon killing her. You want him to be so just. He gets to be upset at her for this. That evil bitch who just wants power AND the mad girl of her mad father. It&rsquo;s revolting. The rage and sorrow I feel at this&hellip; &#129314;&#129326; Indeed Emilia</p>\n\n<p>Oh hold up! I unpaused! She praises them because they&rsquo;ve fulfilled Drogo&rsquo;s will! Just when I thought it was enough of a low, she also fulfills the role of her abuser and does her husband&rsquo;s (ha ha the same guy) final bidding. Amazing! </p>\n\n<p>It occurs to me. Paused again as tyrion appears. Jon has no clue what she&rsquo;s saying. For all he knows, she&rsquo;s saying kill them all kill them all as they touch their spears to the ground but really she&rsquo;s just saying to grey worm, I am giving you this position of rank and honour which while a different name for it sure it isn&rsquo;t something to see as anything other than an appointment that is culturally significant. Jon isn&rsquo;t going to question her on this I guarantee it. He&rsquo;ll just be like damn they&rsquo;re so violent. She&rsquo;s a murderer. I&rsquo;m going to kill her</p>\n\n<p>Oh my god LOL now that she&rsquo;s mentioned Winterfell he&rsquo;s like SHE&rsquo;S GONNA KILL MY SISTER??? I&rsquo;M GOING TO KILL HER&hellip; Tyrion is hearing SHE&rsquo;S GONNA KILL YOU even though a CEILING killed the twins for fucks sake and he isn&rsquo;t on good terms with either! That is an adaptation change&hellip; But y'all couldn&rsquo;t change Daenerys having tHe MoRaL hIgH gRoUnD?? Damn.. but yeah uhhhhh bad. Shame y'all killed that massively impressive polyglot of a translator huh. </p>\n\n<p>These guys have become so lame. They&rsquo;re so wrapped up in their white guy hero costumes that they decide she&rsquo;s unfit to rule, so she acts in an impulsive way to get that rule, then they kill her&hellip; One is going to be, ostensibly, the ruler (Ned was, Tywin was&hellip; Tyrion already was) and one is going to fuck off into a content nothingness for himself. This is infuriating. Cersei wouldn&rsquo;t listen to her (barely existent) advisors in a show of her power but Daenerys did consult her advisors and relented to them endlessly (while Jon never does and he&rsquo;s always morally right about his actions) and often they actually failed her. Conveniently now that dude is the true power in westeros, along with miss Queen in the North like why did y'all not change this to the better: Sansa performs her power by playing the Game and becomes hand instead of making her want to be a queen in the end, and uh don&rsquo;t have this monstrosity of a &ldquo;women go bananas when they&rsquo;re lonely and grieving&rdquo; story for Dany and let them have a great rule together. Jon can be king man why is it all or nothing&hellip;but then Jon&rsquo;s trauma for this forces him to not seat the throne so I&rsquo;m supposed to feel like it&rsquo;s okay cause neither of them &ldquo;win&rdquo;? Bran does?! With TYRION AND BRONN AND FUCKING SAM TARLY AND FUCKING B R O N N ?! like DUDE&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>They don&rsquo;t even let Cersei go out cool. And they make Daenerys&rsquo; end traumatic. So we as women get absolutely no satisfaction (Sansa is one (1) woman in power but it doesn&rsquo;t even feel earned because she has no POV anymore&hellip;but even if so, this would not be satisying enough to negate the other shit). We don&rsquo;t get to be killed off in a satisfying way as the villain, but we get to be the traumatic hero deaths of a woman dying after her son like Cat or by the hands of her lover like Dany I mean goddamn. Jaime, Ned, they die FOR love. Cat, Dany&hellip;they&rsquo;re killed BECAUSE of love, because their trauma is somehow most compelling when it&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re in agony emotionally while for men it&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re at peace&hellip; Holy fucking shit</p>\n\n<p>IM LAUGHING. JON LITERALLY JUST SAID THE MORAL OF THE STORY. he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re born you aren&rsquo;t stamped with your family words, and she&rsquo;s not her father&rdquo;&hellip; Tyrion responds like, she&rsquo;s a conquering tyrant go kill her&hellip; But Jon that&rsquo;s what you seal the deal for when you kill her!!! It really fucking is about family words. And how she is now behaving, this woman who looks nothing like the woman we&rsquo;ve always seen even if she&rsquo;s speaking Dothraki. She is reduced to her father, who is crazy, and her family words &ldquo;fire and blood&rdquo; (even though her birthing dragons literally through fire and blood wasn&rsquo;t violence and destruction, it was sacrifice and creation&hellip;but who cares when you can say &ldquo;fire bad&rdquo;). Jesus fucking Christ I hate every moment of this. this is the conversation you were saving Jon for? Why the fuck didn&rsquo;t he have shit to say in that scene with Daenerys last week</p>\n\n<p>Tyrion literally just said, of Jon riding a dragon, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had that power&rdquo;!!!!! COME ON. You really are just desperate to steal her power away from her. The power of her CHILDREN, as if this last name of his can justify some expertise on this subject with which he fucking knows nothing about (I said it). And Jon rejects this part of him clearly because he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;well we&rsquo;re our family words so&hellip;&rdquo; and he doesn&rsquo;t fucking mourn Rhaegal (but I saw that he will pet Ghost in the end&hellip; Of course. Mr Ned Stark 2.0 himself)&hellip; He can&rsquo;t say a goddamn thing about this and he doesn&rsquo;t understand this power let alone respect her for it, and it&rsquo;s appalling he&rsquo;d act like he can talk on it lol guess he really IS that jackass at the feast&hellip; Feel like I set myself up for failure right there. I&rsquo;m still disappointed</p>\n\n<p>Oh ha ha he goes into darkness, she emerges from it as he moves to face her. They think this is such Shakespearean shit and it&rsquo;s garbage. The mere suggestion that Daenerys could rampage against thousands of innocent lives is laughable. I know what&rsquo;s coming and I&rsquo;m incredibly upset by this. You know what would truly be subversive at this point? Have Jon speak to Daenerys about this first (why do they let he and Tyrion speak? Lol okay). Let her remain the hero in her own story as she becomes this cartoon villain, and let this be a show where that villain wins. The things we do for love. Then we have to see Jaime as an inversion parallel to her instead of a direct one to Jon but &ldquo;gone evil&rdquo; (eye roll. still a bad fucking story. But I bet it&rsquo;d be remembered much better than this misogyny fest)</p>\n\n<p>Jon just had his first comment. I think this is just about letting Jon yell at her in the writer&rsquo;s demand to make him the only morally just character. He has to win and also we love yelling at women. Jon doesn&rsquo;t yell often&hellip;so this is very uncomfortable. Men yelling at women really is a nasty thing</p>\n\n<p>Jon&rsquo;s privilege informs this so much. She has seen slavery and depravity in a way he hasn&rsquo;t, he doesn&rsquo;t recognise white supremacy. They made her return to the dothraki promise of Drogo&rsquo;s will to say that she sees every enemy as this enemy, an enemy to humanity. Jon refuses to see the degrees to which this is true</p>\n\n<p>Wow&hellip; Jon&rsquo;s gonna use her own words to justify this murder (that he&rsquo;s always known what was right) and that is THE maximum manpain you could&rsquo;ve achieved with this action! Literally! He&rsquo;s now like damn she&rsquo;s good she just can&rsquo;t see she&rsquo;s bad but I can and she&rsquo;s says I&rsquo;m good and it&rsquo;s how I know she&rsquo;s good and I love her enough to kill her wow wow wowies imagine being this desperate to have a life story about pain when you really know nothing of it come on white dude writers</p>\n\n<p>LOL YOU&rsquo;RE KIDDING ME. &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll always be my queen. Now and always,&rdquo; kisses her fervently, looks pained&hellip; And stabs her with his face down her throat. I figured she&rsquo;d die in his arms&hellip; Didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d fucking stab her while kissing her. And you&rsquo;ve turned his &ldquo;you are my queen&rdquo; into some stand-in for &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; as it is his expression of devotion to her and of his acceptance of her power over him when he knows she&rsquo;s most troubled by his threat to that power&hellip;Disgusting. He&rsquo;s KISSING her as he MURDERS her. Ok. Gotta have one last taste huh jonny boy</p>\n\n<p>Daenerys dies because she chooses the Nice Guy over Daario Naharis and that&rsquo;s tea. Sadly the writers misunderstood that Jon is actually just a nice guy. So why give them this pain jesus christ why do this to me too wtf???</p>\n\n<p>Damn what a shock she has no final words, they fall to the ground, Jon cradles her and cries. Cause I know y'all want me to not be pissed you&rsquo;ve done this to Dany but to be sad Jon murders a woman he&rsquo;s in love with. Bullshit. Which is a real tragedy because I adore kit and I do feel for him and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s performing incredibly but I can&rsquo;t move beyond my rage as Dany to appreciate his grief as Jon but I don&rsquo;t know if I can ever watch this again to give him that opportunity</p>\n\n<p>They have Jon be in such misery, such heartbreak over this action&hellip;but they don&rsquo;t show his face. They don&rsquo;t focus on him. Tyrion is focused on when he&rsquo;s grieving but Jon, no, it&rsquo;s on Dany&rsquo;s corpse. Her body is our display and his pain is merely window dressing. His sorrow isn&rsquo;t respected. It&rsquo;s the tragedy of it all, this widened shot pulled back that shows the throne behind her with the keep&rsquo;s walls fallen to the ground, Jon holding her limp body close to him so small in the corner of the shot. Y'all don&rsquo;t care about his sorrow. You just care that you made him experience it. I feel terribly for these actors and these characters. Why are they doing this to us</p>\n\n<p>Literally the dragon is out of character. Drogon opens the fuck up to destroy Jaime&rsquo;s life during that loot train battle when Jaime even conceives of trying to take her life. He would not allow Jon to live. Drogon really only gets a consciousness subplot when it&rsquo;s about saving Jon&hellip; And I guess they had him scream at Viserion to say, I reject this heritage of mine, instead of just, I am willing to die for my cause. He gets huffy at Drogon in the same way like he&rsquo;s gonna square up. He should&rsquo;ve been burnt right then and there but apparently Drogon thinks the chase for the throne killed her and that destroying her seat of power is the only closure he wants, he has no need to destroy the man whose blade is in her gut&hellip;who lulled her into a false sense of security over how much he loves her&hellip;bye. that&rsquo;s galaxy brain Drogon and it&rsquo;s whack. Kill jon too wtf</p>\n\n<p>Fucking really they just got me pissed with Arya. Girl shut the fuck up. Yara is my fucking girl though. She stans Daenerys and has her back. A TRUE lesbian icon to the fucking END</p>\n\n<p>Davos LITERALLY just went, &ldquo;assimilate to our culture&rdquo; to Grey Worm like what did I say lol. What a joke</p>\n\n<p>Why is Sam here though. He&rsquo;s a random fucking loser</p>\n\n<p>Who are some of these people. There&rsquo;s that random no name prince from Dorne</p>\n\n<p>OH I FORGOT. HOW CONVENIENT DANY BURNS SAM&rsquo;S BROTHER TO LEAVE HIM LORD OF WHATEVER I GUESS bye!</p>\n\n<p>Wow. Tyrion staying alive cause &ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting justice&rdquo;&hellip; As if he has to feel bad, but think angrily &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let them be like Daenerys&rdquo; to all those he&rsquo;s just so burdened to be advising and this is fucking shit. This is justice? Tyrion is still the power in Westeros. Jon and Tyrion shouldn&rsquo;t escape Unsullied justice, which was shown to be swift. Come on. Drogon is mourning as well&hellip; Come on. </p>\n\n<p>Oh my god. He even wears his hair down now because he has returned to Jon Snow, Ned Stark&rsquo;s role as queenslayer fulfilled. I fucking SAID this was about <a href=\"http://%E2%80%9D\">making Ned see Jaime&rsquo;s despair and be confronted with his same conflict</a>. I fuckin said it and I&rsquo;m goddamn right. Jon should&rsquo;ve been a dragon on resurrection. I would feel so much more content. This is disgusting. </p>\n\n<p>With Bronn it&rsquo;s like, the story of nepotism&hellip;so damn clear lol. Daenerys, a revolutionary, couldn&rsquo;t compare to this system of bullshit. Cool beans</p>\n\n<p>And let&rsquo;s be real, the moves of Sansa and Bran: calculated! Even got Arya the NK kill!  And lol bran the broken&hellip; The propaganda</p>\n\n<p>This small council conversation is the most boring conversation this show has presented me about power. Instead imagine Daenerys ruling and speaking of being mother to all with Jon behind her instead of this lol. She had a chant and then a monologue of delusion as her two scenes&hellip;when she had JUST said to this man that she only had fear? He rejected her then. If she is truly fire and blood why doesn&rsquo;t she have rage here instead of clearly coded psychosis&hellip;She may love him sure, but she can crush that inside of her just like Jon did. Where is my mhysa. Done so fucking dirty. She just begs him to be her partner in the new world she wants to usher forth. But she <i>just fuckin went balls out bonkers cause he wouldn&rsquo;t be with her</i>. Which fucking is it? <i>What do yall want me to believe she wants?</i> Anyway fuck that a final monologue of hers about being mother to all with her stupid man behind her is way more fucking satisfying!</p>\n\n<p>You want me to believe Bran is doing this for the good of the realm&hellip; Abdicating his magical power as the 3ER to reign in peace as a good king will, with a council of great advisors. No. It was calculated, he&rsquo;s a punk bitch, and this is all status quo bullshit. White men gotta be in power huh. Bronn? Sam? Tyrion, who&rsquo;s failed at this repeatedly? Davos, a true good egg. The rest of y'all? Fuck outta here. Dany&rsquo;s magical power as mother of dragons is infinitely superior. I don&rsquo;t make the rules.</p>\n\n<p>Y'all have to realise&hellip;that conversation of the new small council was SO boring. I literally could not pay attention. None of these men have political acumen (meanwhile, all the women they&rsquo;ve killed off&hellip;). But you can&rsquo;t say that was what the story was about, propping up in power people not within the system&rsquo;s clutches&hellip;when Sansa is out there. In victory. She tells Jon she HAD to do this. The Stark&rsquo;s needed to push Daenerys into madness so that they might justify ousting her. They use the man in their family without the Stark name to put a dagger through her body&hellip; disgusting. If I&rsquo;m meant to feel they&rsquo;ve won, that the Stark&rsquo;s have proved themselves&hellip; I can&rsquo;t. This is truly a vulture type of deal. They couldn&rsquo;t stand the be in tandem with Daenerys but knew they couldn&rsquo;t beat her&hellip;so they destroyed her. I&rsquo;m so reviled. I&rsquo;m so&hellip; disgusted. Just really. What the fuck. This is no victory. This is capitalism and white supremacy living in harmony with patriarchy and I&rsquo;m grossed the FUCK out at the implications of this.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway I got so bored I stopped watching and had to rewind cause I think it might&rsquo;ve ended with Jon I saw a cloak&hellip;.</p>\n\n<p>Okay wait I realised something. Sending him to the Wall fulfills what we wish would&rsquo;ve happened to Ned Stark against Joffrey&hellip; But they&rsquo;re so damn insistent on giving Jon a happy ending that he gets to go further North with Tormund and Ghost. Meanwhile&hellip; Daenerys didn&rsquo;t even get to see it coming. She was blinded by delusion to begin with and then she is kissed passionately by Jon. It&rsquo;s bad and woman hating!</p>\n\n<p>But so the Starks played calculated against the Targs! Lol. Cause it really was about the names, the &ldquo;game&rdquo;&hellip; Jon is a dragon in love with another dragon and Bran tells him to make him have these doubts about himself and his existence (especially troubling after having been murdered. Tyrion even brings it up in this episode as one of only I believe two instances for Jon to ever comment on it..). Jon makes a mistake thinking Sansa isn&rsquo;t playing so he tells them. Immediately Daenerys had her life threatened and she was being isolated and feeling very alienated then you made her lose Jon cause you knew maybe he could embrace being a dragon and yall like no, winter is coming, so your dumb brother managed to fall in love with her and that actually makes it better, easier, Daenerys is pushed into this &ldquo;only fear&rdquo;, fire and blood mind set. At this point it&rsquo;s strange to me Jon wouldn&rsquo;t comfort her&hellip; So. This is a fucking train wreck honestly.</p>\n\n<p>ALL THE POV SHOTS IN MONTAGE. YOU LITERALLY MADE IT ONLY ABOUT THE STARK&rsquo;S. what a subversion of expectations. I kind of forgot to get invested in other interesting characters simultaneously oh wait</p>\n\n<p>Also I would watch the shit out of an unsullied spinoff with grey worm but that is literally the only one I would be interested in ever. At all. Unless it&rsquo;s a different world as this one (Jaime&rsquo;s hand grew back so&hellip;I think we can say this is an alternate timeline&hellip;the bad one) </p>\n\n<p>Honestly castle black is a great purgatory for Jon but you don&rsquo;t make him be punished&hellip;.I hate it. He gets his heaven, she her hell&hellip; Jon has been raised into self loathing enough to accept that he killed the woman he loved and is still alive so he gets to move on&hellip; She is <i>dead</i>. We barely see him speak on this. just cries to himself for a little bit and I guess now he&rsquo;s good</p>\n\n<p>I just, like, this is totally imperialist. Sansa knew what would happen, Bran clearly knew, Arya&rsquo;s a tool so it&rsquo;s actually cool she goes away but damn to just play Jon like that wrow bran!! The level of unprofessionalism! Honestly though&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>Also we were clearly given the ridiculous denial of affection with Ghost previously to upset us enough that we cheer for this moment of reunion and forgive Jon&rsquo;s actions. He was tempted by the dragon you see but then she was crazy so he killed her and they died out with him&hellip; Sansa queen&hellip;bran king&hellip; laugh. But really the denial of Jon saying goodbye to Ghost previously was so typical. They bait us into emotional responses, they deny us joy just to try to redirect it somewhere else. It&rsquo;s a poisonous and disrespectful point of view to write from</p>\n\n<p>Disturbingly Jon was questioned about Sansa being jealous of him by enough people&hellip; Her smirk is..hmm.. somewhat telling.. Don&rsquo;t like how they took her character. Why is she a back-dealing, manipulating woman whose goal is to grab power. to Jon&rsquo;s detriment no less&hellip;the destruction of his being, really, cause he really is a soft tender little fuck deep down that just wants to find love</p>\n\n<p>THE CINEMATIC PARALLEL OF SANSA GETTING CROWNED WITH CERSEI&rsquo;S LOL. game changer. I DO respect her but I cannot support you over the mother of dragons for running the throne I&rsquo;m sorry! But it&rsquo;s ridiculous to conceive of a Daenerys who wouldn&rsquo;t let the people rule themselves so long as they all adhered to some common understandings. Like&hellip; why wouldn&rsquo;t she? And if she doesn&rsquo;t, Jon gets to stay happy not guilty forever but go off I guess&hellip;.</p>\n\n<p>Just saying though. A power move by the Stark&rsquo;s I COULD dig but you gave Dany so much pov I couldn&rsquo;t help but root for her ;) no really though Sansa didn&rsquo;t get to spend time playing the game&hellip; So it&rsquo;s just abrupt. And honestly I would&rsquo;ve preferred the revolutionary girl than the Stark girl. Stark&rsquo;s are kind of lacking for me then they go on about honour&hellip; Daenerys goes on about justice. Jon coulda been a bridge but y'all chose one and it wasn&rsquo;t the side with dragons&hellip; Maybe that&rsquo;s why you hyped her up and got the dragons so cool just to make it all mean nothing cause Ned Stark really is the hero and the Stark&rsquo;s have retribution. Daenerys is just higher on the coolness factor but I&rsquo;m saying they could all be simultaneously in power and it would be good storytelling! They didn&rsquo;t need to resort to killing one another I mean&hellip; boring&hellip; Let women uplift women bye</p>\n\n<p>Jon SMILING as his last character shot??? So he&rsquo;s FINE. he&rsquo;s at PEACE. what the fuck??? You want me to believe he can find contentment so soon after this trauma (let alone at all hello). He&rsquo;s of course our last hero&hellip; I&rsquo;m so fucking annoyed lol. This man, who I adore truly with all my heart, he should never get to feel a single moment of joy ever again in his undead fuckin zombie-ass life. That neither Drogon nor Grey Worm should&rsquo;ve let him keep anyways.</p>\n\n<p>But so um yeah this really is trash. How many people rooted for this liberator, as Tyrion calls her, because that&rsquo;s a great story. And with dragons no less! Instead you reward the people who are the epitome of xenophobic. They only trust northerners, Stark&rsquo;s only trust Stark&rsquo;s. Jon had to be one again in the end&hellip;but we take it away. He fucks off out the COUNTRY cause he&rsquo;s really just a Snow. I&rsquo;m asleep</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s really it huh. Can&rsquo;t say I feel a single positive emotion. I&rsquo;m not actually unhappy right now as I read the leaks and knew exactly what this would be. I want to be happy to have gotten a lot right. Just don&rsquo;t care though.</p>\n\n<p>I think a story of liberation, even existing beside the Stark&rsquo;s isolationism, is like insanely better. Why could these women not achieve this? For a name, family words? Boring as shit. </p>\n\n<p>The other cooler timelines in my brain are better thanks</p>\n\n<p>#forthethrone lmfao. Of course&hellip;well house Targaryen now and forever bitches. Not &ldquo;story of how two dragons together make the world go to shit,&rdquo; the one where actually the exact fucking opposite is true specifically because they can control the power of those dragons. Goddamn. Dragon love saves the world and moves us into a brighter, more equal and loving existence. How dare you deny me this wtf</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m like at a state of such rage that I&rsquo;m zen. What a trash heap lol!!! I&rsquo;d have my expectations more subverted if fuckin Robyn Arryn was on the throne&hellip; &#129313;</p>",
