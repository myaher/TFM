You watch as Tyrion and Jorah drink together, reminiscing about old times. Their tales growing more and more far-fetched the more they drank. Though, who were you to say they didn&rsquo;t fight a two headed beast on their journey to meet Daenerys? You would, most likely, be a sane one, but you weren&rsquo;t one to ruin other peoples fun. Especially, since the other men around the two seemed to be much more accepting of the intricacies the two were making up. </p><p>With a small chuckle you make your way back towards the table you&rsquo;ve been sitting at with Daenerys and Missandei. Not surprised to see that the table was empty. After all, Daenerys was the guest of honor at this party and she needed to meet the people that were honoring her. While Missandei was, most likely, with Grey Worm. You know that in time they would be back. So you were more than happy to sit down and rest your head against the wall. </p><p>However, your peaceful silence is soon disturbed by someone sitting across from you. Causing you to turn you gaze to meet the kind, blue eyes of Gendry. Seeing him causes a smile to spread across your face. What little conversation you&rsquo;ve had with him caused you believe him to be a good man. Something you were sure was a correct assessment. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Gendry, what are you doing over here? Shouldn&rsquo;t you be with Arya?&rdquo; you ask with a gentle smile. Even though you haven&rsquo;t been able to talk to him that much, you were still observant. You saw the way Gendry looked at Arya, and understood the look immediately. It was the same way you looked at Dany. </p><p>A blush forming on his cheeks, he rubs the back of his neck before responding. &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s busy talking to Jon. I didn&rsquo;t want to bother her, and I saw that you were sitting alone so I decided to join you. I hope that&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he says with a meek smile. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than fine with me Gendry. You can stay as long as you would like.&rdquo;</p><p>A grin spreads across his face and you couldn&rsquo;t help but grin back. Soon you were talking about random things that the both of you were interested in. Learning that he was a blacksmith causes a smile to spread across your face. </p><p>&ldquo;My father was a blacksmith back in Essos. Could you show me your forge sometime?&rdquo; you ask, and he nods his head with a grin and you couldn&rsquo;t help the laugh that escapes your mouth. Soon he was asking you about the techniques that your father would use to make his weapons. Seemingly fascinated by the way people in Essos made weapons compared to Westeros. </p><p>You both had scooted closer together. It being so loud in the hall you had to basically shout across the table at one another. This was much easier on both of your voices. You didn&rsquo;t even, truly, notice that your hand was resting on his knee as you spoke. Both of you were so caught up in your conversation that everything else seemed to fade away. </p><p>That is until a throat cleared behind you and a calm voice spoke. </p><p>&ldquo;Am I interrupting something?&rdquo; Daenerys asks, with her head tilted to one side.</p><p>You both stand in unison shaking your heads. </p><p>&ldquo;No, of course not, your grace. I was just explaining to Y/N the benefits of combining the methods of both Essos and Westeros forging techniques,&rdquo; Gendry says, his face beet red with embarrassment. </p><p>Daenerys raises a brow in question. You could clearly see the question in her eyes. Why were you so close together if you were talking about something so menial? A question that you know that neither of you could answer. Saying it happened naturally was probably not the best thing to say. Ever. </p><p>You could see the signs of Daenerys becoming annoyed. You know that there was nothing you could say that would change her mind at the moment. Especially, not when you were still standing so close to Gendry. A fact that you quickly rectified by stepping away from him. Something that seemed to appease Daenerys, slightly. However, you could see that she was still stiff. Looking around the room you could see that some people were starting to turn their gazes towards you. </p><p>Not wanting Daenerys to be embarrassed, you whisper a few words to Gendry before taking Daenerys by the arm and leaving the hall. She didn&rsquo;t fight once. Simply following behind you as you made your way towards your shared room. The walk was silent and you could feel your nerves start to rise. Wondering what was going through your loves head. </p><p>The moment you enter your room you felt yourself be pushed down onto the bed. Daenerys straddling your hips, her silver hair hanging like a curtain around you. Violet eyes were assessing you and you did nothing to hide your emotions from her. A fact that causes her to relax.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me the truth. Why were you sitting so closely to Gendry? Why were your faces mere inches apart?&rdquo; Daenerys asks, as she traces her fingers down your arms. </p><p>You swallow before you answer feeling nervous. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t something that we planned, Dany. As we were talking we just drifted closer to hear one another. That&rsquo;s it, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>You watch as she assesses you once more before a smile spreads across her face, and before you can stop yourself you speak once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s not like Gendry was coming onto me like other people at the party. Saying how they could give me a night of my lifetime,&rdquo; you say, with a frown marring your features. Never even noticing the way Daenerys stiffened in response. Until she let&rsquo;s a hiss pass between her teeth as anger flashes across her face.</p><p>&ldquo;People propositioned you. They thought they could take you away from me,&rdquo; Daenerys snarls, her violet eyes flashing. &ldquo;I should go down there and show them exactly why I became the Khaleesi.&rdquo; </p><p>You gentle wrap your hand around her wrist to restrain her from moving. &ldquo;No, Dany, I&rsquo;m fine and nothing could ever make me want to sleep with them. I have you and that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll ever need.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys, simply, smiles closing her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never tire of hearing that from you, but knowing that people tried to take you from me. When they know that you&rsquo;re with me. It makes me <i>very</i> angry, my love,&rdquo; she says, as she opens her eyes to look at you. In a flash her eyes filled with hot possessiveness and desire. \u201cBecause you <i>are</i> mine.\u201d</p><p>Your open your mouth to speak. To affirm that outlandish thing she just said. You couldn\u2019t even comprehend the fact that she even questioned that you were hers. You would <i>always</i> be hers and nothing, and no one, would ever change that. </p><p>You felt her hand grab your hips, gently, and she presses you down onto the bed. Your mind was whirling as she kept her lips attached to your neck. You know that Daenerys was never one to back down from a challenge, you just never knew how much. You grasp the back of her head, as a gasp leaves your lips after her teeth come into the equation. You could feel your breath starting to come in pants. Every time she suckled on your neck you felt yourself arch to meet her touch. You know that she was leaving marks but you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to care. </p><p>You open your mouth to speak, once again, but only a moan makes its way out. Daenerys hearing the sound only applies more pressure onto the patch of skin underneath your collarbone. You couldn\u2019t keep your eyes from fluttering shut at her possessive act. You could feel her hands start to, slowly, work their way up to your thighs. You wanted nothing more than for her to rip off your dress and take you. To fully emerge in the presence of your Khaleesi. </p><p>However, the still functioning portion of your brain finally kicks into gear. With great effort, you open your mouth and speak. </p><p>\u201cDany, if you don\u2019t stop, people will see these tomorrow,\u201d you moan, as your back arches off the bed when her hands make their way under your dress. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she hisses, hotly, against your skin. \u201cLet them see, it just means that they all know that you\u2019re mine.\u201d </p><p>Before you can even think off responding she reattaches her lips to your neck. Whatever you were going to say dies on your lips at the feeling. You felt as she started to unbutton your dress, her lips never leaving your neck. </p><p>You hiss, lightly, at the cold air that suddenly hits your bare flesh. Your still not used to the chilliness of the north. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever be.</p><p>You open your eyes and stare into violet ones that captured your heart. You could see Dany\u2019s devilish smile as she looked up at you. Her sparkling violet eyes staring at you with love and adoration but tinged with burning lust. It was a look you could never get sick of. A look that, even to this day, had your heart racing within your chest. </p><p>You watch, enraptured, as Dany started to move down your body. Leaving burning kisses along the way until she reached your thighs. </p><p>Daenerys spread your thighs apart.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t keep the small whine from escaping your lips when she, gently, presses her lips to the inside of your thigh. You felt yourself buck slightly, only to be restrained by Dany\u2019s firm hand. You felt her other hand slide up your body to tap your chest. You turn your gaze to meet hers and you felt your desire grow at what you saw. </p><p>Another needier, whine leaves your throat at the dark intensity you see within violet orbs. </p><p>She pulls off your smallclothes, leaving you completely bare to her. </p><p>A moan slips out your mouth when you felt her kiss at your inner thighs, once again. She nibbled and suckled, hard and unrelenting \u2013 all but where it needed to be. </p><p>Her hand was working its magic on your body, but you craved for her lips. You craved for the feeling only she could elicit out of you with one swipe of her tongue. You craved for <i>your Daenerys. </i></p><p>\u201cDany,\u201d you whisper, a begging tone working its way into your voice. Hoping that she\u2019ll do what you\u2019re silently asking her to. However, she simply watches with amusement clearly in her eyes. </p><p>You lift your hips, trying to increase the friction between her fingers and your body. Until an idea works its way into your mind, causing a gentle smile to spread across your face. </p><p>You slide your hand down your body and, gently, cup Dany\u2019s face. Causing her to look at you with a raised brow. Without breaking eye contact you begin to speak. </p><p>\u201cDany, please, make love to me. Prove to me that I\u2019m really yours by taking me the way only you can. Show me what it means to be claimed by a dragon.\u201d</p><p>Before you could even react Daenerys began kissing your second pair of lips. A cry left your lips as you work your fingers into Daenerys\u2019s hair. Pressing her down into you, your body arching to meet her. </p><p>You know that you needed more and you voice it without hesitation. </p><p>Looking into your Khaleesi\u2019s eyes your voice was steadier than you thought possible, even though it didn\u2019t lose its begging edge. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys simply nods before she applies more pressure, causing your breath to catch. She laps at your clitoris before her fingers slip into you. One soon became three, working you higher and higher than you ever thought possible. </p><p>It was only a matter of time before that height would soon peak. And you did nothing to stop it. You came with a cry you were sure that the very heavens could hear. Your back arches off the bed until you settle back down. Your body completely spent. Your breaths came in shallow pants as you tried to regain your breathing. </p><p>You felt the bed dip slightly as Daenerys wraps her arms around. Pulling you close to her until you\u2019re nestled in her side. You could feel her lips pressing gentle kisses onto your head. A blissful feeling surrounded the two of you, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way. </p><p>Her soft voice breaks the comfortable silence between the two of you. </p><p>\u201cI want you to wear something with a neckline tomorrow, my love. I want all the people who think they can take you from me to know that you&rsquo;re mine, and I will not give you up without a fight,\u201d she says, as she nuzzles her face into your hair. Causing a small chuckle to escape your lips at the feeling. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d you agree, with a smile on your face. &ldquo;Just as you are mine.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys nods with a beautiful smile on her face. Before a mischievous glint appears in her eyes. She leans towards you and whispers into your ear.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not through with you yet, my love. You wanted to have me show you what it&rsquo;s like to be claimed by a dragon. Well, you&rsquo;re in a for a long night of discovery.&rdquo;</p><p>You felt a slight blush appear on your cheeks, but a tender smile spreads across your face. </p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.&rdquo;</p>",

You could feel her hands start to, slowly, work their way up to your thighs. You wanted nothing more than for her to rip off your dress and take you. To fully emerge in the presence of your Khaleesi. </p><p>However, the still functioning portion of your brain finally kicks into gear. With great effort, you open your mouth and speak. </p><p>\u201cDany, if you don\u2019t stop, people will see these tomorrow,\u201d you moan, as your back arches off the bed when her hands make their way under your dress. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she hisses, hotly, against your skin. \u201cLet them see, it just means that they all know that you\u2019re mine.\u201d </p><p>Before you can even think off responding she reattaches her lips to your neck. Whatever you were going to say dies on your lips at the feeling. You felt as she started to unbutton your dress, her lips never leaving your neck. </p><p>You hiss, lightly, at the cold air that suddenly hits your bare flesh. Your still not used to the chilliness of the north. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever be.</p><p>You open your eyes and stare into violet ones that captured your heart. You could see Dany\u2019s devilish smile as she looked up at you. Her sparkling violet eyes staring at you with love and adoration but tinged with burning lust. It was a look you could never get sick of. A look that, even to this day, had your heart racing within your chest. </p><p>You watch, enraptured, as Dany started to move down your body. Leaving burning kisses along the way until she reached your thighs. </p><p>Daenerys spread your thighs apart.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t keep the small whine from escaping your lips when she, gently, presses her lips to the inside of your thigh. You felt yourself buck slightly, only to be restrained by Dany\u2019s firm hand. You felt her other hand slide up your body to tap your chest. You turn your gaze to meet hers and you felt your desire grow at what you saw. </p><p>Another needier, whine leaves your throat at the dark intensity you see within violet orbs. </p><p>She pulls off your smallclothes, leaving you completely bare to her. </p><p>A moan slips out your mouth when you felt her kiss at your inner thighs, once again. She nibbled and suckled, hard and unrelenting \u2013 all but where it needed to be. </p><p>Her hand was working its magic on your body, but you craved for her lips. You craved for the feeling only she could elicit out of you with one swipe of her tongue. You craved for <i>your Daenerys. </i></p><p>\u201cDany,\u201d you whisper, a begging tone working its way into your voice. Hoping that she\u2019ll do what you\u2019re silently asking her to. However, she simply watches with amusement clearly in her eyes. </p><p>You lift your hips, trying to increase the friction between her fingers and your body. Until an idea works its way into your mind, causing a gentle smile to spread across your face. </p><p>You slide your hand down your body and, gently, cup Dany\u2019s face. Causing her to look at you with a raised brow. Without breaking eye contact you begin to speak. </p><p>\u201cDany, please, make love to me. Prove to me that I\u2019m really yours by taking me the way only you can. Show me what it means to be claimed by a dragon.\u201d</p><p>Before you could even react Daenerys began kissing your second pair of lips. A cry left your lips as you work your fingers into Daenerys\u2019s hair. Pressing her down into you, your body arching to meet her. </p><p>You know that you needed more and you voice it without hesitation. </p><p>Looking into your Khaleesi\u2019s eyes your voice was steadier than you thought possible, even though it didn\u2019t lose its begging edge. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys simply nods before she applies more pressure, causing your breath to catch. She laps at your clitoris before her fingers slip into you. One soon became three, working you higher and higher than you ever thought possible. </p><p>It was only a matter of time before that height would soon peak. And you did nothing to stop it. You came with a cry you were sure that the very heavens could hear. Your back arches off the bed until you settle back down. Your body completely spent. Your breaths came in shallow pants as you tried to regain your breathing. </p><p>You felt the bed dip slightly as Daenerys wraps her arms around. Pulling you close to her until you\u2019re nestled in her side. You could feel her lips pressing gentle kisses onto your head. A blissful feeling surrounded the two of you, and you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. </p><p>Her soft voice breaks the comfortable silence between the two of you. </p><p>\u201cI want you to wear something with a neckline tomorrow, my love. I want all the people who think they can take you from me to know that you\u2019re mine, and I will not give you up without a fight,\u201d she says, as she nuzzles her face into your hair. Causing a small chuckle to escape your lips at the feeling. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d you agree, with a smile on your face. \u201cJust as you are mine.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys nods with a beautiful smile on her face. Before a mischievous glint appears in her eyes. She leans towards you and whispers into your ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not through with you yet, my love. You wanted to have me show you what it\u2019s like to be claimed by a dragon. Well, you\u2019re in a for a long night of discovery.\u201d</p><p>You felt a slight blush appear on your cheeks, but a tender smile spreads across your face. </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d</p></p>",

You watch as Tyrion and Jorah drink together, reminiscing about old times. Their tales growing more and more far-fetched the more they drank. Though, who were you to say they didn\u2019t fight a two headed beast on their journey to meet Daenerys? You would, most likely, be a sane one, but you weren\u2019t one to ruin other peoples fun. Especially, since the other men around the two seemed to be much more accepting of the intricacies the two were making up. </p><p>With a small chuckle you make your way back towards the table you\u2019ve been sitting at with Daenerys and Missandei. Not surprised to see that the table was empty. After all, Daenerys was the guest of honor at this party and she needed to meet the people that were honoring her. While Missandei was, most likely, with Grey Worm. You know that in time they would be back. So you were more than happy to sit down and rest your head against the wall. </p><p>However, your peaceful silence is soon disturbed by someone sitting across from you. Causing you to turn you gaze to meet the kind, blue eyes of Gendry. Seeing him causes a smile to spread across your face. What little conversation you\u2019ve had with him caused you believe him to be a good man. Something you were sure was a correct assessment. </p><p>\u201cHello, Gendry, what are you doing over here? Shouldn\u2019t you be with Arya?\u201d you ask with a gentle smile. Even though you haven\u2019t been able to talk to him that much, you were still observant. You saw the way Gendry looked at Arya, and understood the look immediately. It was the same way you looked at Dany. </p><p>A blush forming on his cheeks, he rubs the back of his neck before responding. \u201cOh, she\u2019s busy talking to Jon. I didn\u2019t want to bother her, and I saw that you were sitting alone so I decided to join you. I hope that\u2019s okay,\u201d he says with a meek smile. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more than fine with me Gendry. You can stay as long as you would like.\u201d</p><p>A grin spreads across his face and you couldn\u2019t help but grin back. Soon you were talking about random things that the both of you were interested in. Learning that he was a blacksmith causes a smile to spread across your face. </p><p>\u201cMy father was a blacksmith back in Essos. Could you show me your forge sometime?\u201d you ask, and he nods his head with a grin and you couldn\u2019t help the laugh that escapes your mouth. Soon he was asking you about the techniques that your father would use to make his weapons. Seemingly fascinated by the way people in Essos made weapons compared to Westeros. </p><p>You both had scooted closer together. It being so loud in the hall you had to basically shout across the table at one another. This was much easier on both of your voices. You didn\u2019t even, truly, notice that your hand was resting on his knee as you spoke. Both of you were so caught up in your conversation that everything else seemed to fade away. </p><p>That is until a throat cleared behind you and a calm voice spoke. </p><p>\u201cAm I interrupting something?\u201d Daenerys asks, with her head tilted to one side.</p><p>You both stand in unison shaking your heads. </p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, your grace. I was just explaining to Y/N the benefits of combining the methods of both Essos and Westeros forging techniques,\u201d Gendry says, his face beet red with embarrassment. </p><p>Daenerys raises a brow in question. You could clearly see the question in her eyes. Why were you so close together if you were talking about something so menial? A question that you know that neither of you could answer. Saying it happened naturally was probably not the best thing to say. Ever. </p><p>You could see the signs of Daenerys becoming annoyed. You know that there was nothing you could say that would change her mind at the moment. Especially, not when you were still standing so close to Gendry. A fact that you quickly rectified by stepping away from him. Something that seemed to appease Daenerys, slightly. However, you could see that she was still stiff. Looking around the room you could see that some people were starting to turn their gazes towards you. </p><p>Not wanting Daenerys to be embarrassed, you whisper a few words to Gendry before taking Daenerys by the arm and leaving the hall. She didn\u2019t fight once. Simply following behind you as you made your way towards your shared room. The walk was silent and you could feel your nerves start to rise. Wondering what was going through your loves head. </p><p>The moment you enter your room you felt yourself be pushed down onto the bed. Daenerys straddling your hips, her silver hair hanging like a curtain around you. Violet eyes were assessing you and you did nothing to hide your emotions from her. A fact that causes her to relax.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth. Why were you sitting so closely to Gendry? Why were your faces mere inches apart?\u201d Daenerys asks, as she traces her fingers down your arms. </p><p>You swallow before you answer feeling nervous. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that we planned, Dany. As we were talking we just drifted closer to hear one another. That\u2019s it, I promise.\u201d</p><p>You watch as she assesses you once more before a smile spreads across her face, and before you can stop yourself you speak once more.</p><p>\u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like Gendry was coming onto me like other people at the party. Saying how they could give me a night of my lifetime,\u201d you say, with a frown marring your features. Never even noticing the way Daenerys stiffened in response. Until she let\u2019s a hiss pass between her teeth as anger flashes across her face.</p><p>\u201cPeople propositioned you. They thought they could take you away from me,\u201d Daenerys snarls, her violet eyes flashing. \u201cI should go down there and show them exactly why I became the Khaleesi.\u201d </p><p>You gentle wrap your hand around her wrist to restrain her from moving. \u201cNo, Dany, I\u2019m fine and nothing could ever make me want to sleep with them. I have you and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever need.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys, simply, smiles closing her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll never tire of hearing that from you, but knowing that people tried to take you from me. When they know that you\u2019re with me. It makes me <i>very</i> angry, my love,\u201d she says, as she opens her eyes to look at you. In a flash her eyes filled with hot possessiveness and desire. \u201cBecause you <i>are</i> mine.\u201d</p><p>Your open your mouth to speak. To affirm that outlandish thing she just said. You couldn\u2019t even comprehend the fact that she even questioned that you were hers. You would <i>always</i> be hers and nothing, and no one, would ever change that. </p><p>You felt her hand grab your hips, gently, and she presses you down onto the bed. Your mind was whirling as she kept her lips attached to your neck. You know that Daenerys was never one to back down from a challenge, you just never knew how much. You grasp the back of her head, as a gasp leaves your lips after her teeth come into the equation. You could feel your breath starting to come in pants. Every time she suckled on your neck you felt yourself arch to meet her touch. You know that she was leaving marks but you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to care. </p><p>You open your mouth to speak, once again, but only a moan makes its way out. Daenerys hearing the sound only applies more pressure onto the patch of skin underneath your collarbone. You couldn\u2019t keep your eyes from fluttering shut at her possessive act. You could feel her hands start to, slowly, work their way up to your thighs. You wanted nothing more than for her to rip off your dress and take you.

You know that there was nothing you could say that would change her mind at the moment. Especially, not when you were still standing so close to Gendry. A fact that you quickly rectified by stepping away from him. Something that seemed to appease Daenerys, slightly. However, you could see that she was still stiff. Looking around the room you could see that some people were starting to turn their gazes towards you. </p><p>Not wanting Daenerys to be embarrassed, you whisper a few words to Gendry before taking Daenerys by the arm and leaving the hall. She didn&rsquo;t fight once. Simply following behind you as you made your way towards your shared room. The walk was silent and you could feel your nerves start to rise. Wondering what was going through your loves head. </p><p>The moment you enter your room you felt yourself be pushed down onto the bed. Daenerys straddling your hips, her silver hair hanging like a curtain around you. Violet eyes were assessing you and you did nothing to hide your emotions from her. A fact that causes her to relax.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me the truth. Why were you sitting so closely to Gendry? Why were your faces mere inches apart?&rdquo; Daenerys asks, as she traces her fingers down your arms. </p><p>You swallow before you answer feeling nervous. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t something that we planned, Dany. As we were talking we just drifted closer to hear one another. That&rsquo;s it, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>You watch as she assesses you once more before a smile spreads across her face, and before you can stop yourself you speak once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s not like Gendry was coming onto me like other people at the party. Saying how they could give me a night of my lifetime,&rdquo; you say, with a frown marring your features. Never even noticing the way Daenerys stiffened in response. Until she let&rsquo;s a hiss pass between her teeth as anger flashes across her face.</p><p>&ldquo;People propositioned you. They thought they could take you away from me,&rdquo; Daenerys snarls, her violet eyes flashing. &ldquo;I should go down there and show them exactly why I became the Khaleesi.&rdquo; </p><p>You gentle wrap your hand around her wrist to restrain her from moving. &ldquo;No, Dany, I&rsquo;m fine and nothing could ever make me want to sleep with them. I have you and that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll ever need.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys, simply, smiles closing her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never tire of hearing that from you, but knowing that people tried to take you from me. When they know that you&rsquo;re with me. It makes me <i>very</i> angry, my love,&rdquo; she says, as she opens her eyes to look at you. In a flash her eyes filled with hot possessiveness and desire. &ldquo;Because you <i>are</i> mine.&rdquo;</p><p>Your open your mouth to speak. To affirm that outlandish thing she just said. You couldn&rsquo;t even comprehend the fact that she even questioned that you were hers. You would <i>always</i> be hers and nothing, and no one, would ever change that. </p><p>You felt her hand grab your hips, gently, and she presses you down onto the bed. Your mind was whirling as she kept her lips attached to your neck. You know that Daenerys was never one to back down from a challenge, you just never knew how much. You grasp the back of her head, as a gasp leaves your lips after her teeth come into the equation. You could feel your breath starting to come in pants. Every time she suckled on your neck you felt yourself arch to meet her touch. You know that she was leaving marks but you couldn&rsquo;t bring yourself to care. </p><p>You open your mouth to speak, once again, but only a moan makes its way out. Daenerys hearing the sound only applies more pressure onto the patch of skin underneath your collarbone. You couldn&rsquo;t keep your eyes from fluttering shut at her possessive act. You could feel her hands start to, slowly, work their way up to your thighs. You wanted nothing more than for her to rip off your dress and take you. To fully emerge in the presence of your Khaleesi. </p><p>However, the still functioning portion of your brain finally kicks into gear. With great effort, you open your mouth and speak. </p><p>&ldquo;Dany, if you don&rsquo;t stop, people will see these tomorrow,&rdquo; you moan, as your back arches off the bed when her hands make their way under your dress. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she hisses, hotly, against your skin. &ldquo;Let them see, it just means that they all know that you&rsquo;re mine.&rdquo; </p><p>Before you can even think off responding she reattaches her lips to your neck. Whatever you were going to say dies on your lips at the feeling. You felt as she started to unbutton your dress, her lips never leaving your neck. </p><p>You hiss, lightly, at the cold air that suddenly hits your bare flesh. Your still not used to the chilliness of the north. You don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll ever be.</p><p>You open your eyes and stare into violet ones that captured your heart. You could see Dany&rsquo;s devilish smile as she looked up at you. Her sparkling violet eyes staring at you with love and adoration but tinged with burning lust. It was a look you could never get sick of. A look that, even to this day, had your heart racing within your chest. </p><p>You watch, enraptured, as Dany started to move down your body. Leaving burning kisses along the way until she reached your thighs. </p><p>Daenerys spread your thighs apart.</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t keep the small whine from escaping your lips when she, gently, presses her lips to the inside of your thigh. You felt yourself buck slightly, only to be restrained by Dany&rsquo;s firm hand. You felt her other hand slide up your body to tap your chest. You turn your gaze to meet hers and you felt your desire grow at what you saw. </p><p>Another needier, whine leaves your throat at the dark intensity you see within violet orbs. </p><p>She pulls off your smallclothes, leaving you completely bare to her. </p><p>A moan slips out your mouth when you felt her kiss at your inner thighs, once again. She nibbled and suckled, hard and unrelenting &ndash; all but where it needed to be. </p><p>Her hand was working its magic on your body, but you craved for her lips. You craved for the feeling only she could elicit out of you with one swipe of her tongue. You craved for <i>your Daenerys. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Dany,&rdquo; you whisper, a begging tone working its way into your voice. Hoping that she&rsquo;ll do what you&rsquo;re silently asking her to. However, she simply watches with amusement clearly in her eyes. </p><p>You lift your hips, trying to increase the friction between her fingers and your body. Until an idea works its way into your mind, causing a gentle smile to spread across your face. </p><p>You slide your hand down your body and, gently, cup Dany&rsquo;s face. Causing her to look at you with a raised brow. Without breaking eye contact you begin to speak. </p><p>&ldquo;Dany, please, make love to me. Prove to me that I&rsquo;m really yours by taking me the way only you can. Show me what it means to be claimed by a dragon.&rdquo;</p><p>Before you could even react Daenerys began kissing your second pair of lips. A cry left your lips as you work your fingers into Daenerys&rsquo;s hair. Pressing her down into you, your body arching to meet her. </p><p>You know that you needed more and you voice it without hesitation. </p><p>Looking into your Khaleesi&rsquo;s eyes your voice was steadier than you thought possible, even though it didn&rsquo;t lose its begging edge. &ldquo;More.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys simply nods before she applies more pressure, causing your breath to catch. She laps at your clitoris before her fingers slip into you. One soon became three, working you higher and higher than you ever thought possible. </p><p>It was only a matter of time before that height would soon peak. And you did nothing to stop it. You came with a cry you were sure that the very heavens could hear. Your back arches off the bed until you settle back down. Your body completely spent. Your breaths came in shallow pants as you tried to regain your breathing. </p><p>You felt the bed dip slightly as Daenerys wraps her arms around. Pulling you close to her until you&rsquo;re nestled in her side. You could feel her lips pressing gentle kisses onto your head. A blissful feeling surrounded the two of you, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way. </p><p>Her soft voice breaks the comfortable silence between the two of you. </p><p>&ldquo;I want you to wear something with a neckline tomorrow, my love. I want all the people who think they can take you from me to know that you&rsquo;re mine, and I will not give you up without a fight,&rdquo; she says, as she nuzzles her face into your hair. Causing a small chuckle to escape your lips at the feeling. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours,&rdquo; you agree, with a smile on your face. &ldquo;Just as you are mine.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys nods with a beautiful smile on her face. Before a mischievous glint appears in her eyes. She leans towards you and whispers into your ear.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not through with you yet, my love. You wanted to have me show you what it&rsquo;s like to be claimed by a dragon. Well, you&rsquo;re in a for a long night of discovery.&rdquo;</p><p>You felt a slight blush appear on your cheeks, but a tender smile spreads across your face. </p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.&rdquo;</p></p>",
