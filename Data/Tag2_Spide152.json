I post about issues I care about (Chronic Illness, GLBTQ &amp; Disability rights, among many others), and lots of fandom stuff. Part of Loki\u2019s Army</p><p>Fan of: Doctor Who, Good Omens, The Silmarillion, Tolkien's Legendarium, LOTR, AHS Murder House &amp; Apocalypse , Star Wars, Star Trek, The Marvel Universe, Game Of Thrones, Harry Potter, The Fantastical Beasts Series, The Hunger Games, Twin Peaks, Westworld, OUAT (seasons 1-3A.) I tend to sympathize/empathize with villains/anti-heros/antagonists with complex characteristics &amp; tragic backstories (doesn\u2019t mean I condone all of their actions). If this is a problem for you, you probably shouldn\u2019t follow me. FYI, I do sometimes post smut.

I will call you out and publicly mess with you. Haters will drop kicked. If you\u2019re a bully type, you\u2019re better off not engaging me.

They shouldn&rsquo;t be paired as a team.</p><p><br/></p><p>WARNING: IT IS LATE. 1AM. I HAD 4 HOURS OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT. TAKE THIS WITH A PINCH OF SALT. ITS JUST RAMBLING.</p><p><br/></p><p>So I got thinking. How old is Harley Keener?</p><p><br/></p><p>So for this, I used two timelines. <a href=\"https://www.mpaa.org/2018/11/the-official-timeline-of-all-the-marvel-movies/\">This</a> and <a href=\"http://amp.timeinc.net/time/5227935/marvel-cinematic-universe-timeline\">this</a>.</p><p>So if they&rsquo;re not toooo accurately. Bare with me.</p><p><br/></p><p>So let&rsquo;s establish a few points that we DO know. </p><p><br/></p><ul><li>Iron Man 3 (Harley&rsquo;s MCU Debut) was in 2012.</li><li>His LITTLE sister is 6.</li><li>Spider-Man HoCo is in 2020 (or 8 years after The Avengers, which is in 2012.)</li><li>Peter is about 16, maybe 15, in HoCo and IW.</li><li>Harley looks 8 to 10 in 2012, and confirmed 6&lt;.</li></ul><p>So just by this we can figure out:</p><ul><li>Peter is born in 2004.</li><li>Harley&rsquo;s sister is born in 2006.</li><li>Harley is 2002 to 2004.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>Ages of them in 2012:</p><p><br/></p><ul><li>Peter: 8</li><li>H&rsquo;s Sister: 6</li><li>Harley: 6&lt;, most likely 8-10</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>So knowing this, it means that Harley would be 16 to 18 in the current timeline. </p><p><br/></p><p>But I noticed one thing. I looked up the <a href=\"https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_at_Stark_Expo\">Stark Expo Attack</a>, where Peter was notably saved by Tony. That&rsquo;s in 2010. So Peter is around 6. Makes sense. (Unless he went with his parents, which I dont remember. I&rsquo;ve heard so many different ages where they die. But a common I&rsquo;ve heard is four?)</p><p><br/></p><p>So I was curious and clicked on <a href=\"https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Spider-Man\">Peter&rsquo;s official wiki</a> for that page and scrolled through. I didnt read his description until afterwards, but this small part caught me off guard:</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"350\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b5d1df2c7ada794727d77da2c993ae8a/tumblr_plz7lt3oxZ1skwjf1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"350\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>It caught me off guard in all honesty. Was my timeline wrong? </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"577\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/55d2df4233f28ba57b42dd830e1a06e2/tumblr_plz7ltk4821skwjf1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"577\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>It would explain why his passport doesn&rsquo;t have a year. It could just be to leave it up to when you&rsquo;re watching it. Them being lazy. Or maybe just not wanting to clear up plot loopholes? I dont know.</p><p><br/></p><p>So I went back up and looked at his description.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"557\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fc87e5736bbca85be2e2a1024aca4e69/tumblr_plz7lshmK01skwjf1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"557\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>Welp. Yup. That confirms it. He IS 16. But my dates are a bit off. But then I noticed that poor baby Peter Parker died months before his birthday. Probably about five or four months. Which sucks. He was almsot 17.</p><p><br/></p><p>Okay, but back to the new knowledge based off the wiki. We can assume that HoCo takes place in 2017, the beginning of his school year. I&rsquo;m pretty sure hes with the same class, but if we are to assume the timeline and give a bit of flexibility. It was months between HoCo and IW, and Peter was 16 in HoCo. Which meant that he was in fact in the same grade as he was when he died. If that makes sense? </p><p><br/></p><p>So let&rsquo;s base everything around IW (even though I want it to be HoCo because that&rsquo;s Peter&rsquo;s first movie. But we gotta go to the closest movie.)</p><p><br/></p><p>Now at this point, we already know their ages and confirmed Peter&rsquo;s age to be correct.</p><p><br/></p><p>So if IW is in 2018, that means that:</p><p><br/></p><ul><li>Peter is born in 2001. </li><li>H&rsquo;s Sister is born in 2003.</li><li>Harley is born from 1999 to 2001.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>It&rsquo;s kind of annoying that a lot of sources say one thing, then another say something else. All it does is just shift around the time, but it kinda just throws everything into a loop.</p><p><br/></p><p>(A side note is though, I laughed when I saw Peter was born in 2001 on the wiki and the timelines all say HoCo is in 2020. Which would make Peter a 19 year old in a sophomore/junior class. I dont know. Its literally 1am.)</p><p><br/></p><p>I turn 18 this year, and it warms my heart how young they are. Especially with the times lines up to ours.</p>",
