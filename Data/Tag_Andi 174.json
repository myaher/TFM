As someone who has panic attacks, if I need help, I don\u2019t care who comes up to me to try to help me, I\u2019ll let them. Plus, Jonah wasn\u2019t in a good state of mind then. I\u2019m pretty sure he wasn\u2019t worried about his and TJ\u2019s feud when he literally thought he was dying. And the person in that situation that was acting friendly was TJ. And from the ping pong scene we can see that TJ didn\u2019t have any idea that Jonah and him had issues, hence him being friendly to Jonah during his panic attack. The second time was at the basketball game. Jonah said \u201cAre they friends?\u201d Of course this could be seen as him wondering that because TJ is the bully and the captain of the basketball team, but it could also be because of his and TJ\u2019s past. And the way he said it wasn\u2019t in a hateful way, but is he really going to try to make a scene or seem off around his friends or in public? The ping pong scene is the first time that him and TJ have been close to being alone with each other where Jonah was in a clear state of mind. So I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s so random. </p>",
