THAT\u2019S SUBTEXT YOU WILLFULLY BLIND SHIPPER.&rdquo; \u00a0That&rsquo;s the text.\n \u00a0That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s being said. \u00a0Bran was talking about R and L. \u00a0If you \ntake that as a hint for Jonerys then that&rsquo;s foreshadowing. \u00a0Bran had no \nmotivations behind that but to tell the audience the truth. \u00a0That&rsquo;s it. \n The thing about foreshadowing though is that they can misdirect. \u00a0False\n hints. &ldquo;Dany\u2019s supposed infertility was mentioned officially three \ntimes but she and Jon spoke about children (or it was mentioned to them)\n a total of five times in this one season. And then they had sex. That\u2019s\n not scene analysis. That\u2019s your \u201csubtext\u201d for you. Chekhov\u2019s gun. If \nit\u2019s mentioned, it must contribute to the story and is essential. If \nDany were just going to remain infertile and never have a child, why \nmention it SO many times?&rdquo; MENTION is text. This too is foreshadowing. &ldquo;And again, that word: TOGETHER - a word that was REPEATED OVER \nAND OVER AGAIN throughout Season 7&rdquo; Subtext is subtle and hidden it \ncertainly wouldn&rsquo;t be repeated over and over again lol. &ldquo;Now, if Political!Jon were true, at the very least, Jon\u2019s \npre-boatsex attire would include the Stark gorget as he\u2019s known to wear \nbecause it would COMMUNICATE to the audience that he\u2019s still a Stark, he\n hasn\u2019t forgotten his family and the North&hellip; &rdquo; Pol!Jon is part of the \nsubtext. What Jon is really thinking. \u00a0What his true motivations are. \nWhat is being HIDDEN from the audience.

Thank you for showing your side of the fandom\u2019s weaknesses and highlighting them for all to see.<br/></p><p>And thankfully, I have the receipts babe. <br/></p><blockquote><p><i>You also don&rsquo;t know what subtext means.

They often remain underneath until the author wants it \nto become known at which point it will become the text. <br/></i></p></blockquote><p>1) How can you sit there and pretend to know what a character on screen is thinking? If we\u2019re basing everything off \u201ccharacter thoughts\u201d then none of us would have any evidence at all because on a television show with no internal monologues, we aren\u2019t privy to a character\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>2) Don\u2019t argue literary devices with someone who studies both English and Film. This is not a fight you will win. As it happens, I DO know what subtext is, but you seem to be having quite a difficult time with the meaning so I\u2019ll explain:</p><p><i>The subtext is the unspoken <b>or</b> less obvious meaning or message in a literary composition, drama,\n speech, or conversation. The subtext comes to be known by the reader or\n audience over time, as it is not immediately or purposefully revealed \nby the story itself. - <a href=\"https://literaryterms.net/subtext/\">Literaryterms.net</a><br/></i></p><p>There can be subtext of 1) an entire story 2) a passage or scene or 3) a single line. Also, you seem to be operating under the impression that \u201csubtext\u201d in film/television can only be through dialogue. This is not true. <br/></p><p>For example, the entire subtext of the novel <i>Animal Farm</i> is firmly anti-communism, criticizing the rise of communism in Russia. Likewise, the subtext of the film Avatar (James Cameron) is a criticism of the genocide of Native Americans by the Europeans.</p><p>But do either of those \u201ctexts\u201d <b><i>ever</i></b> mention communism or Native Americans?? No. Because it\u2019s subtext. <br/></p><blockquote><p><i>What you have \npresented is <b>foreshadowing</b>. And with the Dragon door reaching. How is \nthat even text.</i></p></blockquote><p>*Sigh* (again, \u201csubtext\u201d does not have to mean \u201ctext\u201d as in dialogue. See above examples of subtext as non-dialogue).<br/></p><p><b><i>Foreshadowing</i></b> drives <b><i>subtext</i></b> and they work together, oftentimes with Foreshadowing cluing the reader/viewer in on what the Subtext actually is. And both can work either with dialogue/text, or without. Especially in film/television. In film/television, we\u2019re not limited to only words on a page (or words spoken by the characters). Things such as costumes, music, even the way certain scenes are shot can contribute to foreshadowing and subtext.\u00a0</p><p>For instance, we hear creepy music. This <b><i>foreshadows</i></b> something bad will happen. The <b><i>subtext</i></b> is <i>danger. <br/></i></p><p><i>The Rains of Castamere</i> is an excellent example throughout Season 3 of GOT because by the time we get to the Red Wedding in Episode 9 and we hear that iconic song, we know something terrible will happen. Subtext and Foreshadowing working together in a non-dialogue way.<br/></p><p>By the way, you asked for \u201cendgame\u201d metas:<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1261\" data-orig-height=\"940\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a6afea6e56105beb944dbeefc4b0f88b/tumblr_inline_pn1bz3u8H61vdefr3_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"1261\" data-orig-height=\"940\"/></figure><p>You were looking for metas that pointed to Jon and Daenerys ending up together. And you seem to have confused \u201cSubtext\u201d with \u201cForeshadowing\u201d because \u201cSubtext\u201d does not point to \u201cendgames\u201d. \u201cForeshadowing\u201d gives the audience clues as to what will happen in the future. \u201cSubtext\u201d does not. \u201cSubtext\u201d only shows the audience <b>hidden or less obvious meanings</b> of things. And again, the two often work together. <br/></p><p><b>So please decide which you are looking for, subtext or foreshadowing, and stop bitching when you don\u2019t get what you want because you didn\u2019t know the right word. </b><br/></p><p>And BTW, how is my \u201cdragon door\u201d example \u201creaching?\u201d We get a very clear and purposeful shot of <i>Jon</i> being the one to close the door and of the Targaryen sigil being on the outside of it, with two known Targaryens inside. So far as \u201cendgame\u201d, I already told you what that points to (foreshadowing) - and that\u2019s the continuation of House Targaryen through Jon and Dany and Jon embracing his Targaryen heritage. The \u201csubtext\u201d is, again, <i>together</i>. That\u2019s the meaning behind it. Jon and Dany are <i>united</i> under one symbol, one House, one cause, and one love. <br/></p><p>Just because you don\u2019t <i>want</i> that to be the meaning of that shot, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not. <br/></p><blockquote><p><i><b>Jon and Dany aren&rsquo;t parallels</b>. \u00a0So those metas don&rsquo;t exist. \u00a0\nThose are wrong. <b>They are foils</b>. \u00a0But you don&rsquo;t understand the meaning \nof that or don&rsquo;t want to so of course those metas don&rsquo;t exist. <br/></i></p></blockquote><p>Did. You. Not. Click. On. The. Link. From. The. Other. Ask?? <br/></p><p>Parallel characters, also known as \u201cMirror\u201d characters, function in a similar way to \u201cFoils\u201d in that they are used to highlight qualities of the characters and aspects of their journey. <a href=\"https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/literary-devices/\">Mirror characters</a>: <i>embark on parallel plots, sometimes to achieve a single goal, which tests them and highlights their traits in different ways</i>. <br/></p><p>Jon and Dany have had parallel plots from the very beginning. Again, it\u2019s in <a href=\"https://got-addict.tumblr.com/post/167089167535/jonerys-has-no-foreshadows-no-parallels-nothing\">THIS</a> link so I\u2019m not going to detail every single reason why their plots are parallel to each other. If you are blatanly ignoring those parallels, I have nothing to say to you. <br/></p><p>Also, you seem to be confusing \u201cFoil\u201d with \u201cAntagonists\u201d and as I talked about <a href=\"https://iheartdandelions.tumblr.com/post/176065440186/i-have-some-random-question-but-what-exactly-can\">HERE</a>, that isn\u2019t always the case. You can have Foil characters who are very similar save one key difference and they don\u2019t always have to be antagonists to each other (like my Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom example). And as I pointed out <a href=\"https://iheartdandelions.tumblr.com/post/177532597126/daenerys-as-antagonist\">HERE</a>, Dany is not Jon\u2019s Antagonist.

If we\u2019re basing everything off \u201ccharacter thoughts\u201d then none of us would have any evidence at all because on a television show with no internal monologues, we aren\u2019t privy to a character\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>2) Don\u2019t argue literary devices with someone who studies both English and Film. This is not a fight you will win. As it happens, I DO know what subtext is, but you seem to be having quite a difficult time with the meaning so I\u2019ll explain:</p><p><i>The subtext is the unspoken <b>or</b> less obvious meaning or message in a literary composition, drama,\n speech, or conversation. The subtext comes to be known by the reader or\n audience over time, as it is not immediately or purposefully revealed \nby the story itself. - <a href=\"https://literaryterms.net/subtext/\">Literaryterms.net</a><br></i></p><p>There can be subtext of 1) an entire story 2) a passage or scene or 3) a single line. Also, you seem to be operating under the impression that \u201csubtext\u201d in film/television can only be through dialogue. This is not true. <br></p><p>For example, the entire subtext of the novel <i>Animal Farm</i> is firmly anti-communism, criticizing the rise of communism in Russia. Likewise, the subtext of the film Avatar (James Cameron) is a criticism of the genocide of Native Americans by the Europeans.</p><p>But do either of those \u201ctexts\u201d <b><i>ever</i></b> mention communism or Native Americans?? No. Because it\u2019s subtext. <br></p><blockquote><p><i>What you have \npresented is <b>foreshadowing</b>. And with the Dragon door reaching. How is \nthat even text.</i></p></blockquote><p>*Sigh* (again, \u201csubtext\u201d does not have to mean \u201ctext\u201d as in dialogue. See above examples of subtext as non-dialogue).<br></p><p><b><i>Foreshadowing</i></b> drives <b><i>subtext</i></b> and they work together, oftentimes with Foreshadowing cluing the reader/viewer in on what the Subtext actually is. And both can work either with dialogue/text, or without. Especially in film/television. In film/television, we\u2019re not limited to only words on a page (or words spoken by the characters). Things such as costumes, music, even the way certain scenes are shot can contribute to foreshadowing and subtext.\u00a0</p><p>For instance, we hear creepy music. This <b><i>foreshadows</i></b> something bad will happen. The <b><i>subtext</i></b> is <i>danger. <br></i></p><p><i>The Rains of Castamere</i> is an excellent example throughout Season 3 of GOT because by the time we get to the Red Wedding in Episode 9 and we hear that iconic song, we know something terrible will happen. Subtext and Foreshadowing working together in a non-dialogue way.<br></p><p>By the way, you asked for \u201cendgame\u201d metas:<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1261\" data-orig-height=\"940\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a6afea6e56105beb944dbeefc4b0f88b/tumblr_inline_pn1bz3u8H61vdefr3_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"1261\" data-orig-height=\"940\"></figure><p>You were looking for metas that pointed to Jon and Daenerys ending up together. And you seem to have confused \u201cSubtext\u201d with \u201cForeshadowing\u201d because \u201cSubtext\u201d does not point to \u201cendgames\u201d. \u201cForeshadowing\u201d gives the audience clues as to what will happen in the future. \u201cSubtext\u201d does not. \u201cSubtext\u201d only shows the audience <b>hidden or less obvious meanings</b> of things. And again, the two often work together. <br></p><p><b>So please decide which you are looking for, subtext or foreshadowing, and stop bitching when you don\u2019t get what you want because you didn\u2019t know the right word. </b><br></p><p>And BTW, how is my \u201cdragon door\u201d example \u201creaching?\u201d We get a very clear and purposeful shot of <i>Jon</i> being the one to close the door and of the Targaryen sigil being on the outside of it, with two known Targaryens inside. So far as \u201cendgame\u201d, I already told you what that points to (foreshadowing) - and that\u2019s the continuation of House Targaryen through Jon and Dany and Jon embracing his Targaryen heritage. The \u201csubtext\u201d is, again, <i>together</i>. That\u2019s the meaning behind it. Jon and Dany are <i>united</i> under one symbol, one House, one cause, and one love. <br></p><p>Just because you don\u2019t <i>want</i> that to be the meaning of that shot, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not. <br></p><blockquote><p><i><b>Jon and Dany aren\u2019t parallels</b>. \u00a0So those metas don\u2019t exist. \u00a0\nThose are wrong. <b>They are foils</b>. \u00a0But you don\u2019t understand the meaning \nof that or don\u2019t want to so of course those metas don\u2019t exist. <br></i></p></blockquote><p>Did. You. Not. Click. On. The. Link. From. The. Other. Ask?? <br></p><p>Parallel characters, also known as \u201cMirror\u201d characters, function in a similar way to \u201cFoils\u201d in that they are used to highlight qualities of the characters and aspects of their journey. <a href=\"https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/literary-devices/\">Mirror characters</a>: <i>embark on parallel plots, sometimes to achieve a single goal, which tests them and highlights their traits in different ways</i>. <br></p><p>Jon and Dany have had parallel plots from the very beginning.

You can have Foil characters who are very similar save one key difference and they don\u2019t always have to be antagonists to each other (like my Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom example). And as I pointed out <a href=\"https://iheartdandelions.tumblr.com/post/177532597126/daenerys-as-antagonist\">HERE</a>, Dany is not Jon\u2019s Antagonist.

There is nothing at all to show that Jon is being dishonest with Daenerys in any way or that Jon cares about Northern Independence or that he\u2019s going to Dany\u2019s room for any other reason than that he loves her.</p><p>So anon, why don\u2019t you stop bugging Jonerys/Daenerys blogs, stop bitching when you can\u2019t find metas you want just because you don\u2019t know the difference between literary devices and how they work together, the different ways they can be portrayed in film, and stop acting superior to everyone when you clearly have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. <br></p>",

They often remain underneath until the author wants it \nto become known at which point it will become the text. <br></i></p></blockquote><p>1) How can you sit there and pretend to know what a character on screen is thinking? If we\u2019re basing everything off \u201ccharacter thoughts\u201d then none of us would have any evidence at all because on a television show with no internal monologues, we aren\u2019t privy to a character\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>2) Don\u2019t argue literary devices with someone who studies both English and Film. This is not a fight you will win. As it happens, I DO know what subtext is, but you seem to be having quite a difficult time with the meaning so I\u2019ll explain:</p><p><i>The subtext is the unspoken <b>or</b> less obvious meaning or message in a literary composition, drama,\n speech, or conversation. The subtext comes to be known by the reader or\n audience over time, as it is not immediately or purposefully revealed \nby the story itself. - <a href=\"https://literaryterms.net/subtext/\">Literaryterms.net</a><br></i></p><p>There can be subtext of 1) an entire story 2) a passage or scene or 3) a single line. Also, you seem to be operating under the impression that \u201csubtext\u201d in film/television can only be through dialogue. This is not true. <br></p><p>For example, the entire subtext of the novel <i>Animal Farm</i> is firmly anti-communism, criticizing the rise of communism in Russia. Likewise, the subtext of the film Avatar (James Cameron) is a criticism of the genocide of Native Americans by the Europeans.</p><p>But do either of those \u201ctexts\u201d <b><i>ever</i></b> mention communism or Native Americans?? No. Because it\u2019s subtext. <br></p><blockquote><p><i>What you have \npresented is <b>foreshadowing</b>. And with the Dragon door reaching. How is \nthat even text.</i></p></blockquote><p>*Sigh* (again, \u201csubtext\u201d does not have to mean \u201ctext\u201d as in dialogue. See above examples of subtext as non-dialogue).<br></p><p><b><i>Foreshadowing</i></b> drives <b><i>subtext</i></b> and they work together, oftentimes with Foreshadowing cluing the reader/viewer in on what the Subtext actually is. And both can work either with dialogue/text, or without. Especially in film/television. In film/television, we\u2019re not limited to only words on a page (or words spoken by the characters). Things such as costumes, music, even the way certain scenes are shot can contribute to foreshadowing and subtext.\u00a0</p><p>For instance, we hear creepy music. This <b><i>foreshadows</i></b> something bad will happen. The <b><i>subtext</i></b> is <i>danger. <br></i></p><p><i>The Rains of Castamere</i> is an excellent example throughout Season 3 of GOT because by the time we get to the Red Wedding in Episode 9 and we hear that iconic song, we know something terrible will happen. Subtext and Foreshadowing working together in a non-dialogue way.<br></p><p>By the way, you asked for \u201cendgame\u201d metas:<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1261\" data-orig-height=\"940\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a6afea6e56105beb944dbeefc4b0f88b/tumblr_inline_pn1bz3u8H61vdefr3_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"1261\" data-orig-height=\"940\"></figure><p>You were looking for metas that pointed to Jon and Daenerys ending up together. And you seem to have confused \u201cSubtext\u201d with \u201cForeshadowing\u201d because \u201cSubtext\u201d does not point to \u201cendgames\u201d. \u201cForeshadowing\u201d gives the audience clues as to what will happen in the future. \u201cSubtext\u201d does not. \u201cSubtext\u201d only shows the audience <b>hidden or less obvious meanings</b> of things. And again, the two often work together. <br></p><p><b>So please decide which you are looking for, subtext or foreshadowing, and stop bitching when you don\u2019t get what you want because you didn\u2019t know the right word. </b><br></p><p>And BTW, how is my \u201cdragon door\u201d example \u201creaching?\u201d We get a very clear and purposeful shot of <i>Jon</i> being the one to close the door and of the Targaryen sigil being on the outside of it, with two known Targaryens inside. So far as \u201cendgame\u201d, I already told you what that points to (foreshadowing) - and that\u2019s the continuation of House Targaryen through Jon and Dany and Jon embracing his Targaryen heritage. The \u201csubtext\u201d is, again, <i>together</i>. That\u2019s the meaning behind it. Jon and Dany are <i>united</i> under one symbol, one House, one cause, and one love. <br></p><p>Just because you don\u2019t <i>want</i> that to be the meaning of that shot, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not. <br></p><blockquote><p><i><b>Jon and Dany aren\u2019t parallels</b>. \u00a0So those metas don\u2019t exist. \u00a0\nThose are wrong. <b>They are foils</b>. \u00a0But you don\u2019t understand the meaning \nof that or don\u2019t want to so of course those metas don\u2019t exist. <br></i></p></blockquote><p>Did. You. Not. Click. On. The. Link. From. The. Other. Ask?? <br></p><p>Parallel characters, also known as \u201cMirror\u201d characters, function in a similar way to \u201cFoils\u201d in that they are used to highlight qualities of the characters and aspects of their journey. <a href=\"https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/literary-devices/\">Mirror characters</a>: <i>embark on parallel plots, sometimes to achieve a single goal, which tests them and highlights their traits in different ways</i>. <br></p><p>Jon and Dany have had parallel plots from the very beginning. Again, it\u2019s in <a href=\"https://got-addict.tumblr.com/post/167089167535/jonerys-has-no-foreshadows-no-parallels-nothing\">THIS</a> link so I\u2019m not going to detail every single reason why their plots are parallel to each other. If you are blatanly ignoring those parallels, I have nothing to say to you. <br></p><p>Also, you seem to be confusing \u201cFoil\u201d with \u201cAntagonists\u201d and as I talked about <a href=\"https://iheartdandelions.tumblr.com/post/176065440186/i-have-some-random-question-but-what-exactly-can\">HERE</a>, that isn\u2019t always the case. You can have Foil characters who are very similar save one key difference and they don\u2019t always have to be antagonists to each other (like my Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom example). And as I pointed out <a href=\"https://iheartdandelions.tumblr.com/post/177532597126/daenerys-as-antagonist\">HERE</a>, Dany is not Jon\u2019s Antagonist. She is an equal Protagonist to him. <br></p><p>And going back to \u201cFoils\u201d vs \u201cMirror\u201d - the reason Jon and Dany aren\u2019t considered \u201cfoils\u201d is because Jon isn\u2019t the only protagonist. Dany is one as well. The story is about <i>both</i> their journeys, not just Jon\u2019s with Dany\u2019s story serving to highlight aspects of his story. She\u2019s a major POV character. It\u2019s HER story too. They are mirrors. \u00a0 <br></p><blockquote><p><i>Two pins\n on a costume lol. \u00a0Ok I\u2019ll give you that one. \u00a0Tho not a meta but an \nobservation.\n\u201cOhhhh, and the BIGGEST piece of subtext this season: BRAN\u2019S \nVOICE OVER \u201cHE LOVED HER AND SHE LOVED HIM\u201d OVER THE SHOTS OF JON AND \nDAENERYS. THAT\u2019S SUBTEXT YOU WILLFULLY BLIND SHIPPER.\u201d \u00a0<b>That\u2019s the text.\n \u00a0That\u2019s what\u2019s being said. \u00a0Bran was talking about R and L. \u00a0If you \ntake that as a hint for Jonerys then that\u2019s foreshadowing.</b> \u00a0Bran had no \nmotivations behind that but to tell the audience the truth. \u00a0That\u2019s it. \n The thing about foreshadowing though is that they can misdirect. \u00a0False\n hints. <br></i></p></blockquote><p>Oh my, there is so much wrong here, it\u2019s genuinely mind boggling. <br></p><p>Again, Foreshadowing gives the audience hints of the FUTURE. Jon and Dany\u2019s love for each other isn\u2019t something that will happen in the FUTURE. It\u2019s happening NOW. <br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the text.\u201d - YES. That\u2019s the text. \u201cHe loved her and she loved him.\u201d The TEXT is that Bran is referring to Lyanna and Rhaegar because that is who he is watching in his vision. He\u2019s not having a vision of Jon and Dany on the boat together. So the TEXT is <i>directly</i> referring to Lyanna and Rhaegar. <br></p><p>HOWEVER, you asked for \u201csubtext\u201d. Again, \u201cSubtext\u201d shows \u201chidden meaning\u201d. The hidden meaning isn\u2019t that Lyanna and Rhaegar were in love. That\u2019s not hidden at all. It\u2019s right out in the open. <br></p><p>The \u201cSubtext\u201d comes in when Bran\u2019s words about Rhaegar and Lyanna are voiced OVER the shots of Jon and Daenerys. Why sync that voiceover with footage of two people it supposedly doesn\u2019t refer to? Because that\u2019s the <i>underlying</i> meaning of the scene. That was a very specific choice by the writers (it\u2019s in the scripts written that way) to have those words over Jon and Dany. It\u2019s communicating a different meaning to the audience that way. If those words were said over footage of Lyanna and Rhaegar, there would be no hidden meaning. They would mean just what was said. Lyanna and Rhaegar loved each other. But putting them over footage of other characters creates a <i>second</i> meaning to them to include Jon and Dany.</p><p>\u201c<i>The thing about foreshadowing though is that they can misdirect. \u00a0False\n hints</i>.\u201d</p><p>Seriously? If that\u2019s the hill you want to die on, be my guest. It\u2019s an \u2018I say, you say\u2019 argument and that gets people nowhere. You won\u2019t have any \u201cproof\u201d that they were false hints until the season airs I\u2019m afraid. Until then, nothing is for sure so you can\u2019t just say \u201cfalse hints\u201d and make it proof. That\u2019s not proof. That\u2019s a claim. And you need evidence to back up a claim which you don\u2019t yet have. <br></p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>MENTION is text. This too is foreshadowing.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Yes, mention is the text. The <b><i>text</i></b> says Dany is infertile. The <b><i>subtext</i></b> is that she\u2019s not infertile or that the audience should be asking themselves if this is really true.</p><p><i>Subtext through Questions is subtext created when <b>readers and audiences \nhave questions about a story, such as how a plot is developing or what a\n character will do</b>. -\u00a0 </i>again from: <i><a href=\"https://literaryterms.net/subtext/\">Literaryterms.net</a></i><br></p><p> The <b><i>foreshadowing</i></b> is that she and Jon <i>will</i> have a child. Again, you need to figure out whether you\u2019re looking for subtext or foreshadowing because you keep confusing the two. And again, they are related and often work together in texts but are not the same thing. <br></p><blockquote><p><i>Subtext is subtle and hidden it \ncertainly wouldn\u2019t be repeated over and over again lol.</i></p></blockquote><p>Again: <i>The <a href=\"https://literaryterms.net/subtext/\">subtext</a> is the unspoken <b>OR</b> <b>less obvious meaning or MESSAGE</b> in a literary composition, drama,\n speech, or conversation. The subtext comes to be known by the reader or\n audience <b>over time</b>, as it is not immediately or purposefully revealed \nby the story itself.</i></p><p>The <b>text</b> says the word <i>Together </i>in a number of different circumstances. So <b>on the surface</b>, there are numerous meanings in each of the different instances the word is spoken. The <b>underlying</b> MESSAGE of <i>all</i> these instances <i>throughout</i> the story is that only when the entire country, all the living in Westeros come together, quit their fighting, put aside their differences, and all strive for this common goal, will they defeat the Night King. <br></p><blockquote><p><i>Pol!Jon is part of the \nsubtext. What Jon is really thinking. \u00a0What his true motivations are. \nWhat is being HIDDEN from the audience. If you believe in what you see \nis really what\u2019s happening then there is no subtext for you. \u00a0You don\u2019t \nbelieve it.</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cWhat Jon is really thinking\u201d - again, how can you know what Jon is really thinking when his thoughts are never told to us? You don\u2019t know his thoughts any better than we do. We only have actions and his words and his history to go on. <br></p><p>And as I demonstrated in my example of the Stark gorget which Jon is curiously <i>not</i> wearing when he goes knocking on Dany\u2019s door on the ship, if Jon <i>was</i> being deceitful on behalf of the North, if PoliticalJon was true, to show the audience the subtext of that, Jon would be wearing that gorget. He\u2019d be showing something \u201csubtle\u201d to the audience that he is still aligned with the North, not Daenerys. <br></p><p>But that \u201csubtext\u201d of Jon still being aligned with the North and the Starks and him actually opposing Dany is <i>absent</i> from that scene. There is nothing at all to show that Jon is being dishonest with Daenerys in any way or that Jon cares about Northern Independence or that he\u2019s going to Dany\u2019s room for any other reason than that he loves her.</p><p>So anon, why don\u2019t you stop bugging Jonerys/Daenerys blogs, stop bitching when you can\u2019t find metas you want just because you don\u2019t know the difference between literary devices and how they work together, the different ways they can be portrayed in film, and stop acting superior to everyone when you clearly have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. <br></p>",

THAT&rsquo;S SUBTEXT YOU WILLFULLY BLIND SHIPPER.&rdquo; &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the text.\n &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s being said. &nbsp;Bran was talking about R and L. &nbsp;If you \ntake that as a hint for Jonerys then that&rsquo;s foreshadowing. &nbsp;Bran had no \nmotivations behind that but to tell the audience the truth. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s it. \n The thing about foreshadowing though is that they can misdirect. &nbsp;False\n hints. &ldquo;Dany&rsquo;s supposed infertility was mentioned officially three \ntimes but she and Jon spoke about children (or it was mentioned to them)\n a total of five times in this one season. And then they had sex. That&rsquo;s\n not scene analysis. That&rsquo;s your &ldquo;subtext&rdquo; for you. Chekhov&rsquo;s gun. If \nit&rsquo;s mentioned, it must contribute to the story and is essential. If \nDany were just going to remain infertile and never have a child, why \nmention it SO many times?&rdquo; MENTION is text. This too is foreshadowing. &ldquo;And again, that word: TOGETHER - a word that was REPEATED OVER \nAND OVER AGAIN throughout Season 7&rdquo; Subtext is subtle and hidden it \ncertainly wouldn&rsquo;t be repeated over and over again lol. &ldquo;Now, if Political!Jon were true, at the very least, Jon&rsquo;s \npre-boatsex attire would include the Stark gorget as he&rsquo;s known to wear \nbecause it would COMMUNICATE to the audience that he&rsquo;s still a Stark, he\n hasn&rsquo;t forgotten his family and the North&hellip; &rdquo; Pol!Jon is part of the \nsubtext. What Jon is really thinking. &nbsp;What his true motivations are. \nWhat is being HIDDEN from the audience. If you believe in what you see \nis really what&rsquo;s happening then there is no subtext for you. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t \nbelieve it.&nbsp; <br /></i></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>First off anon, I have to say thank you for this because it so perfectly demonstrates (1) your own entitlement. It&rsquo;s quite funny to observe (2) your growing paranoia that Jonsa actually isn&rsquo;t happening so to create an outlet for your fear and frustration, you&rsquo;ve been spamming the inboxes of Jonerys/Daenerys stans (3) the absolute and complete bias of Jonsas and your tendencies to twist words attempting to make it so you&rsquo;re always right and anyone who opposes you is always wrong (4) your utter misunderstanding of literary devices and trying to use your misunderstandings as if that&rsquo;s proof that you&rsquo;re right. <br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s really a laugh. Thank you for showing your side of the fandom&rsquo;s weaknesses and highlighting them for all to see.<br /></p><p>And thankfully, I have the receipts babe. <br /></p><blockquote><p><i>You also don&rsquo;t know what subtext means. Sub meaning underneath \nand text mean written word. &nbsp;In this case since the medium is tv it&rsquo;s \nunderneath the dialogue. &nbsp;The hidden meaning. &nbsp;<b>What the characters are \nreally thinking and really believe but not saying</b>. &nbsp;What their true \nmotivations are. They often remain underneath until the author wants it \nto become known at which point it will become the text. <br /></i></p></blockquote><p>1) How can you sit there and pretend to know what a character on screen is thinking? If we&rsquo;re basing everything off &ldquo;character thoughts&rdquo; then none of us would have any evidence at all because on a television show with no internal monologues, we aren&rsquo;t privy to a character&rsquo;s thoughts.</p><p>2) Don&rsquo;t argue literary devices with someone who studies both English and Film. This is not a fight you will win. As it happens, I DO know what subtext is, but you seem to be having quite a difficult time with the meaning so I&rsquo;ll explain:</p><p><i>The subtext is the unspoken <b>or</b> less obvious meaning or message in a literary composition, drama,\n speech, or conversation. The subtext comes to be known by the reader or\n audience over time, as it is not immediately or purposefully revealed \nby the story itself. - <a href=\"https://literaryterms.net/subtext/\">Literaryterms.net</a><br /></i></p><p>There can be subtext of 1) an entire story 2) a passage or scene or 3) a single line. Also, you seem to be operating under the impression that &ldquo;subtext&rdquo; in film/television can only be through dialogue. This is not true. <br /></p><p>For example, the entire subtext of the novel <i>Animal Farm</i> is firmly anti-communism, criticizing the rise of communism in Russia. Likewise, the subtext of the film Avatar (James Cameron) is a criticism of the genocide of Native Americans by the Europeans.</p><p>But do either of those &ldquo;texts&rdquo; <b><i>ever</i></b> mention communism or Native Americans?? No. Because it&rsquo;s subtext. <br /></p><blockquote><p><i>What you have \npresented is <b>foreshadowing</b>. And with the Dragon door reaching. How is \nthat even text.</i></p></blockquote><p>*Sigh* (again, &ldquo;subtext&rdquo; does not have to mean &ldquo;text&rdquo; as in dialogue. See above examples of subtext as non-dialogue).<br /></p><p><b><i>Foreshadowing</i></b> drives <b><i>subtext</i></b> and they work together, oftentimes with Foreshadowing cluing the reader/viewer in on what the Subtext actually is. And both can work either with dialogue/text, or without. Especially in film/television. In film/television, we&rsquo;re not limited to only words on a page (or words spoken by the characters). Things such as costumes, music, even the way certain scenes are shot can contribute to foreshadowing and subtext.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, we hear creepy music. This <b><i>foreshadows</i></b> something bad will happen. The <b><i>subtext</i></b> is <i>danger. <br /></i></p><p><i>The Rains of Castamere</i> is an excellent example throughout Season 3 of GOT because by the time we get to the Red Wedding in Episode 9 and we hear that iconic song, we know something terrible will happen. Subtext and Foreshadowing working together in a non-dialogue way.<br /></p><p>By the way, you asked for &ldquo;endgame&rdquo; metas:<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a6afea6e56105beb944dbeefc4b0f88b/tumblr_inline_pn1bz3u8H61vdefr3_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>You were looking for metas that pointed to Jon and Daenerys ending up together. And you seem to have confused &ldquo;Subtext&rdquo; with &ldquo;Foreshadowing&rdquo; because &ldquo;Subtext&rdquo; does not point to &ldquo;endgames&rdquo;. &ldquo;Foreshadowing&rdquo; gives the audience clues as to what will happen in the future. &ldquo;Subtext&rdquo; does not. &ldquo;Subtext&rdquo; only shows the audience <b>hidden or less obvious meanings</b> of things. And again, the two often work together. <br /></p><p><b>So please decide which you are looking for, subtext or foreshadowing, and stop bitching when you don&rsquo;t get what you want because you didn&rsquo;t know the right word. </b><br /></p><p>And BTW, how is my &ldquo;dragon door&rdquo; example &ldquo;reaching?&rdquo; We get a very clear and purposeful shot of <i>Jon</i> being the one to close the door and of the Targaryen sigil being on the outside of it, with two known Targaryens inside. So far as &ldquo;endgame&rdquo;, I already told you what that points to (foreshadowing) - and that&rsquo;s the continuation of House Targaryen through Jon and Dany and Jon embracing his Targaryen heritage. The &ldquo;subtext&rdquo; is, again, <i>together</i>. That&rsquo;s the meaning behind it. Jon and Dany are <i>united</i> under one symbol, one House, one cause, and one love. <br /></p><p>Just because you don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> that to be the meaning of that shot, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not. <br /></p><blockquote><p><i><b>Jon and Dany aren&rsquo;t parallels</b>. &nbsp;So those metas don&rsquo;t exist. &nbsp;\nThose are wrong. <b>They are foils</b>. &nbsp;But you don&rsquo;t understand the meaning \nof that or don&rsquo;t want to so of course those metas don&rsquo;t exist. <br /></i></p></blockquote><p>Did. You. Not. Click. On. The. Link. From. The. Other. Ask?? <br /></p><p>Parallel characters, also known as &ldquo;Mirror&rdquo; characters, function in a similar way to &ldquo;Foils&rdquo; in that they are used to highlight qualities of the characters and aspects of their journey. <a href=\"https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/literary-devices/\">Mirror characters</a>: <i>embark on parallel plots, sometimes to achieve a single goal, which tests them and highlights their traits in different ways</i>. <br /></p><p>Jon and Dany have had parallel plots from the very beginning. Again, it&rsquo;s in <a href=\"https://got-addict.tumblr.com/post/167089167535/jonerys-has-no-foreshadows-no-parallels-nothing\">THIS</a> link so I&rsquo;m not going to detail every single reason why their plots are parallel to each other. If you are blatanly ignoring those parallels, I have nothing to say to you. <br /></p><p>Also, you seem to be confusing &ldquo;Foil&rdquo; with &ldquo;Antagonists&rdquo; and as I talked about <a href=\"https://iheartdandelions.tumblr.com/post/176065440186/i-have-some-random-question-but-what-exactly-can\">HERE</a>, that isn&rsquo;t always the case. You can have Foil characters who are very similar save one key difference and they don&rsquo;t always have to be antagonists to each other (like my Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom example). And as I pointed out <a href=\"https://iheartdandelions.tumblr.com/post/177532597126/daenerys-as-antagonist\">HERE</a>, Dany is not Jon&rsquo;s Antagonist. She is an equal Protagonist to him. <br /></p><p>And going back to &ldquo;Foils&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Mirror&rdquo; - the reason Jon and Dany aren&rsquo;t considered &ldquo;foils&rdquo; is because Jon isn&rsquo;t the only protagonist. Dany is one as well. The story is about <i>both</i> their journeys, not just Jon&rsquo;s with Dany&rsquo;s story serving to highlight aspects of his story. She&rsquo;s a major POV character. It&rsquo;s HER story too. They are mirrors. &nbsp; <br /></p><blockquote><p><i>Two pins\n on a costume lol. &nbsp;Ok I&rsquo;ll give you that one. &nbsp;Tho not a meta but an \nobservation.\n&ldquo;Ohhhh, and the BIGGEST piece of subtext this season: BRAN&rsquo;S \nVOICE OVER &ldquo;HE LOVED HER AND SHE LOVED HIM&rdquo; OVER THE SHOTS OF JON AND \nDAENERYS. THAT&rsquo;S SUBTEXT YOU WILLFULLY BLIND SHIPPER.&rdquo; &nbsp;<b>That&rsquo;s the text.\n &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s being said. &nbsp;Bran was talking about R and L. &nbsp;If you \ntake that as a hint for Jonerys then that&rsquo;s foreshadowing.</b> &nbsp;Bran had no \nmotivations behind that but to tell the audience the truth. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s it. \n The thing about foreshadowing though is that they can misdirect. &nbsp;False\n hints. <br /></i></p></blockquote><p>Oh my, there is so much wrong here, it&rsquo;s genuinely mind boggling. <br /></p><p>Again, Foreshadowing gives the audience hints of the FUTURE. Jon and Dany&rsquo;s love for each other isn&rsquo;t something that will happen in the FUTURE. It&rsquo;s happening NOW. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the text.&rdquo; - YES. That&rsquo;s the text. &ldquo;He loved her and she loved him.&rdquo; The TEXT is that Bran is referring to Lyanna and Rhaegar because that is who he is watching in his vision. He&rsquo;s not having a vision of Jon and Dany on the boat together. So the TEXT is <i>directly</i> referring to Lyanna and Rhaegar. <br /></p><p>HOWEVER, you asked for &ldquo;subtext&rdquo;. Again, &ldquo;Subtext&rdquo; shows &ldquo;hidden meaning&rdquo;. The hidden meaning isn&rsquo;t that Lyanna and Rhaegar were in love. That&rsquo;s not hidden at all. It&rsquo;s right out in the open. <br /></p><p>The &ldquo;Subtext&rdquo; comes in when Bran&rsquo;s words about Rhaegar and Lyanna are voiced OVER the shots of Jon and Daenerys. Why sync that voiceover with footage of two people it supposedly doesn&rsquo;t refer to? Because that&rsquo;s the <i>underlying</i> meaning of the scene. That was a very specific choice by the writers (it&rsquo;s in the scripts written that way) to have those words over Jon and Dany. It&rsquo;s communicating a different meaning to the audience that way. If those words were said over footage of Lyanna and Rhaegar, there would be no hidden meaning. They would mean just what was said. Lyanna and Rhaegar loved each other. But putting them over footage of other characters creates a <i>second</i> meaning to them to include Jon and Dany.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>The thing about foreshadowing though is that they can misdirect. &nbsp;False\n hints</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Seriously? If that&rsquo;s the hill you want to die on, be my guest. It&rsquo;s an &lsquo;I say, you say&rsquo; argument and that gets people nowhere. You won&rsquo;t have any &ldquo;proof&rdquo; that they were false hints until the season airs I&rsquo;m afraid. Until then, nothing is for sure so you can&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;false hints&rdquo; and make it proof. That&rsquo;s not proof. That&rsquo;s a claim. And you need evidence to back up a claim which you don&rsquo;t yet have. <br /></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>MENTION is text. This too is foreshadowing.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>Yes, mention is the text. The <b><i>text</i></b> says Dany is infertile. The <b><i>subtext</i></b> is that she&rsquo;s not infertile or that the audience should be asking themselves if this is really true.</p><p><i>Subtext through Questions is subtext created when <b>readers and audiences \nhave questions about a story, such as how a plot is developing or what a\n character will do</b>. -&nbsp; </i>again from: <i><a href=\"https://literaryterms.net/subtext/\">Literaryterms.net</a></i><br /></p><p> The <b><i>foreshadowing</i></b> is that she and Jon <i>will</i> have a child. Again, you need to figure out whether you&rsquo;re looking for subtext or foreshadowing because you keep confusing the two. And again, they are related and often work together in texts but are not the same thing. <br /></p><blockquote><p><i>Subtext is subtle and hidden it \ncertainly wouldn&rsquo;t be repeated over and over again lol.</i></p></blockquote><p>Again: <i>The <a href=\"https://literaryterms.net/subtext/\">subtext</a> is the unspoken <b>OR</b> <b>less obvious meaning or MESSAGE</b> in a literary composition, drama,\n speech, or conversation. The subtext comes to be known by the reader or\n audience <b>over time</b>, as it is not immediately or purposefully revealed \nby the story itself.</i></p><p>The <b>text</b> says the word <i>Together </i>in a number of different circumstances. So <b>on the surface</b>, there are numerous meanings in each of the different instances the word is spoken. The <b>underlying</b> MESSAGE of <i>all</i> these instances <i>throughout</i> the story is that only when the entire country, all the living in Westeros come together, quit their fighting, put aside their differences, and all strive for this common goal, will they defeat the Night King. <br /></p><blockquote><p><i>Pol!Jon is part of the \nsubtext. What Jon is really thinking. &nbsp;What his true motivations are. \nWhat is being HIDDEN from the audience. If you believe in what you see \nis really what&rsquo;s happening then there is no subtext for you. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t \nbelieve it.</i></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;What Jon is really thinking&rdquo; - again, how can you know what Jon is really thinking when his thoughts are never told to us? You don&rsquo;t know his thoughts any better than we do. We only have actions and his words and his history to go on. <br /></p><p>And as I demonstrated in my example of the Stark gorget which Jon is curiously <i>not</i> wearing when he goes knocking on Dany&rsquo;s door on the ship, if Jon <i>was</i> being deceitful on behalf of the North, if PoliticalJon was true, to show the audience the subtext of that, Jon would be wearing that gorget. He&rsquo;d be showing something &ldquo;subtle&rdquo; to the audience that he is still aligned with the North, not Daenerys. <br /></p><p>But that &ldquo;subtext&rdquo; of Jon still being aligned with the North and the Starks and him actually opposing Dany is <i>absent</i> from that scene. There is nothing at all to show that Jon is being dishonest with Daenerys in any way or that Jon cares about Northern Independence or that he&rsquo;s going to Dany&rsquo;s room for any other reason than that he loves her.</p><p>So anon, why don&rsquo;t you stop bugging Jonerys/Daenerys blogs, stop bitching when you can&rsquo;t find metas you want just because you don&rsquo;t know the difference between literary devices and how they work together, the different ways they can be portrayed in film, and stop acting superior to everyone when you clearly have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about. <br /></p>",

        "question": "Why is it wrong for Sansa to demand loyalty from northern houses who have already sworn fealty to House Stark to help the Starks reclaim their home from the Boltons? The Boltons who helped kill thousands of northerners and even heirs to noble northern houses? But it's not wrong for Dany to arrive in Westeros and demand loyalty and knee bending from people who don't even know her? People who have suffered terribly, who suffered under the reign of her father, people who don't owe her anything?",
        "answer": "<p>Listen, anon who refuses to use their own blog name. I didn\u2019t say it was WRONG. Do you lack reading comprehension? I didn\u2019t say it was wrong. I said she did it imperiously, with no thought for how the Boltons cowed the entire North. Davos even warned her but she went ahead and assumed that every Northern house would gladly rally. They didn\u2019t. Glover was an asshole about it. I think the Northern houses were wrong, but they eventually rallied behind Sansa AND JON.</p><p>I said nothing about Daenerys. You are the one trying to get me to pit Sansa and Daenerys against each other. I have zero interest in doing that. The FACT is that Daenerys demanded exactly ONE family to kneel. The Tarly\u2019s. May I remind you that the Tarly\u2019s served House Tyrell, but when Cersei promised Randyll that he could be Warden of the West he betrayed his liege lord. <br/></p><p>\nBetrayed his liege lord just like House Bolton betrayed THEIR liege lord, House Stark. \n\n<br/></p><p>The smallfolk of Westeros did not suffer under the rule of Daenery\u2019 father. The people of King\u2019s Landing did that is true. They suffered far more, along with ALL of Westeros, from the War of Five Kings which happened many years after Aerys was overthrown. And Cersei has been making the people of King\u2019s Landing suffer quite a bit ever since her husband King Robert died. <br/></p><p>Why do you have such a problem with me criticizing Sansa? Are you aware (you surely are) that anti Dany folks, Sansa fans, and Jonsa fans all call Daenerys horrible names and heap TONS of rage on her. Not even criticism, RAGE. And they freely put it in her tag and then merrily tell her fans that object, that it\u2019s all okay. So deal with my criticism. <br/></p>",
