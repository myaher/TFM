He was trying so hard that it hurt. He kept on telling himself that he had promised her, that he couldn\u2019t disappoint her, that he couldn\u2019t betray her. But the more he tried to fight the monster inside of him, the bigger that monster seemed to grow. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold a kitchen knife without feeling the urge to slid her throat and watch the blood dripping down her dress. He couldn\u2019t sleep next to her without wanting to grab her pillow and watch the fight and life seeping out of her. </p><p>And he hated himself for it.</p><p>She believed in him. She believed he could be a better man. She believed he could walk away from the alter ego his grief had created. She promised to heal him, to fix him, to save him. She didn\u2019t know how hard she was failing. She didn\u2019t know how hard he was failing.</p><p>His fist landed on the wooden desk and a growl escaped his half closed lips. He didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone. He didn\u2019t want to kill anyone. He most of all didn\u2019t want to hurt of kill her. </p><p>But the part of him that needed the thrill, the moment of ultimate power, the moment of being in control of life and death, didn\u2019t care who she was and what he had promised. That part needed blood. It needed death. It needed to take a life.</p><p>His fist slammed on his desk again. And again. And again. A sharp pain spread through his hand and his entire arm. Drops of blood dripped on the expensive wood, staining it forever. He slammed again. And again. And again. But no matter how hard he slammed, no matter how many bones he bruised, no matter how much blood he lost, the monster in his chest just kept on laughing in his face.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cJon?\u201d Sansa rushed into the shared bedroom. Her eyes widened and her jaw dropped and she placed a hand on his back in an attempt to calm him down.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Sansa\u2026\u201d He hissed between his teeth. His chest moved up and down rapidly and he heard his own heart beating. \u201cYou have to get away from me. Now.\u201d He didn\u2019t dare to look at her. He didn\u2019t know how much longer he could fight himself. And he did know that the letter opener was near, within reach. </p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Sansa shook her head. One day her braveness would kill her. One day her life would end because she refused to run away from danger. One day she would die by his hand because she didn\u2019t want to give up on him.</p><p>He hated her for it. He loved her for it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She spoke softly and her hand kept on rubbing his back. \u201cTalk to me, Jon.\u201d Sansa spoke firm and Jon closed his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fight it.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if the words came out as a whisper or a growl. \u201cI can\u2019t fight him.\u201d He let the tears roll down his cheeks. \u201cHe wants to kill. He needs to kill. Someone. You.\u201d</p><p>Sansa kept silent for a moment. Her hand stilled on his back. But she didn\u2019t walk away. She didn\u2019t turn around. She didn\u2019t leave him. Not yet. \u201cWhy?\u201d She took a deep breath and her hand started moving again. </p><p>\u201cThe thrill, the control, the power.

Her glance was filled with fire, with determination, with the kind of willpower Jon wished he possessed right now. \u201cA few hours is all I need.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what she was up to, how she was gonna save him, but what were a few more hours? He could give her a few more hours. He wanted to give her a few more hours. A few more hours to stop him. A few more hours to fight him. A few more hours to save him. He nodded. And while Sansa walked away to who knew where, he kept on repeating the same sentence over and over to pass the time. </p><p>A few more hours. Only a few more hours. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d </p><p>When he opened his eyes again the sun had set. Their shared bedroom was dark, the sheets crumbled because he had fallen asleep on top of them, still fully clothed. \u201cDid it work?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure what she had been doing, where she had been going. He was sure that the few hours she had needed, the few hours he had promised her, had passed. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She stepped closer. \u201cYet.\u201d Her voice wasn\u2019t trembling and when she reached out her hands to help him up her arms weren\u2019t shaking either. </p><p>He placed his hands in hers and leaned on her while he stepped out of the bed. \u201cWhen will you know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen you tell me it worked.\u201d Sansa kneeled down in front of him and double tied his shoe lashes. She stood up again and handed him his jacket. The palm of her hand touched his cheek before she pressed a soft kiss on his lips. \u201cGunthorpe street, 11pm.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cHis name is Martin Kenner. He killed two kids, but the judges let him go because he paid them an awful lot of money.\u201d </p><p>Jon furrowed his eyebrows and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your knife. Take your monster. Satisfy it.\u201d Sansa placed a hand on his chest. \u201cFeed it by killing someone who deserves to die.\u201d </p><p>He widened his eyes and stared at her. \u201cYou want me to kill\u2026\u201d He shook his head, but he felt the monster inside him waking up, stretching out its fingers, already looking forward to finally being unleashed tonight. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m not gonna lose you, Jon.\u201d She stepped back. \u201cAnd if I need to find you people to kill to keep you alive and with me, so be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d Jon took a deep breath. The innocence he had once fallen in love with was gone. The little girl she had once been had grown up. He had chased that innocent girl away. He had killed that part of her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you\u2026\u201d </p><p>She curled her lips up into a mocking smile. \u201cI am who I have to be for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re not a killer. You\u2019re not a murderer. Your heart is filled with love, not with hate.\u201d Jon pleaded, but Sansa didn\u2019t crack, not even a little bit. </p><p>\u201cThe line between hate and love is fine, Jon. I love you. I love you that much that I will let hate into my heart.\u201d Her lips formed a straight line. \u201cI want that man dead, Jon. I want you to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded and he grabbed the back of her neck before he pressed his lips firmly on hers. Every time he thought he couldn\u2019t love her any more than he already did, he discovered that he still could. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d He stepped back and put his jacket on. \u201cAnd you deserve so much more and better than I can give.\u201d He didn\u2019t give her the chance to answer. </p><p>He opened the drawer and reached for his blinking knife. Smoothly, as if it had been only yesterday since he had held it, he hid it in a pocket designed to keep it safe. Without looking over his shoulder he walked through the door, down the stairs and left the house. </p><p>The night was quiet and cold. The wind blew in his face. It was the adrenaline that kept him warm. It was the monster that kept him going. </p><p>He buried his chin in his jacket. His dark curls hid most of his face. He united with the shadows, just like he had done so many years ago. Old habits never fully died. </p><p>This time he didn\u2019t have a reasonable motivation. He didn\u2019t have a broken heart he tried to heal. He didn\u2019t have a goal. He just wanted to kill. </p><p>He slowed down when he reached Gunthorpe street. He let his glance wander over the people crowding the area. He saw a hooker, begging for attention and money. He saw a tramp, hiding under the newspaper from three days ago. He saw a rich man, hopelessly out of place between the gamblers and the vagabonds, pretending he didn\u2019t belong here while his eyes wandered over the women he could take home with him tonight. </p><p>\u201cMister Kenner?\u201d Jon lifted his chin and straightened his back. </p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d The man raised his eyebrows while Jon approached. </p><p>\u201cI have an offer we need to discuss. One you can\u2019t refuse.\u201d Jon didn\u2019t know if the man would fall for the trick. \u201cIf you walk with me for a few minutes I will explain it to you.\u201d</p><p>Martin stared once more at the women fighting for whatever he had in his wallet. \u201cWhy not? None of them will be gone before I get back.\u201d He chuckled and the monster inside Jon started to roar, loudly, clearly and most of all hungry.</p><p>Jon led the man around a corner. Around another one and another one. And when they were out of sight he finally released the beast inside him. He curled his fingers around his knife and he buried his other hand in the man\u2019s hair. Without an explanation, without giving Martin the chance to realize what was happening, the sharp blade slid Kenner\u2019s throat. Jon watched the blood seeping down, staining Kenner\u2019s bright white shirt. Jon watched the lifeless body of the man collapse on the dirty cobbles in this dark neighborhood. Jon could almost feel the soul of the man being freed and descending to hell, where it belonged. </p><p>The monster smiled. It drank in the sight of blood. It devoured the image of the lifeless body. It basked in the adrenaline rushing through Jon\u2019s veins. And for the first time in weeks it calmed down and fell asleep.</p><p>With a satisfied smile on his face Jon put the knife away and walked back home. He greeted some people left and right. He politely declined offered services and invitations to shady bars. He took the shortest route \u00a0and threw the front door open without even attempting to be quiet. </p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Sansa rushed into the hallway. </p><p>\u201cIt worked.\u201d Jon exhaled and then the smile on his face brightened. </p><p>Sansa ran towards him and she threw her arms around his neck. Her lips kissed his and he kissed her back, eagerly. </p><p>He lifted her up and twirled her around. \u201cWhat would I do without you, Sansa Stark?\u201d Jon paused their kiss for a few seconds before he kissed her again. </p><p>\u201cNothing, Jon Snow, absolutely nothing.\u201d Sansa buried her hands in his curls and wrapped her legs around his waist.</p><p>She was right. Without her he\u2019d been nothing. Without her he maybe would have been dead. Without her he would be lost. </p><p>\u201cLet me know when the monster wakes up again. I\u2019m sure this city houses some more garbage it can live without.\u201d She whispered and while she kept on kissing him, he carried her upstairs, towards the bedroom. </p><p>And for the first time in weeks he didn\u2019t think about suffocating her with a pillow or slitting her throat. For the first time in weeks he only thought about making love to her for the rest of the night.</p>",

Her eyes widened and her jaw dropped and she placed a hand on his back in an attempt to calm him down.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Sansa\u2026\u201d He hissed between his teeth. His chest moved up and down rapidly and he heard his own heart beating. \u201cYou have to get away from me. Now.\u201d He didn\u2019t dare to look at her. He didn\u2019t know how much longer he could fight himself. And he did know that the letter opener was near, within reach. </p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Sansa shook her head. One day her braveness would kill her. One day her life would end because she refused to run away from danger. One day she would die by his hand because she didn\u2019t want to give up on him.</p><p>He hated her for it. He loved her for it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She spoke softly and her hand kept on rubbing his back. \u201cTalk to me, Jon.\u201d Sansa spoke firm and Jon closed his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fight it.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if the words came out as a whisper or a growl. \u201cI can\u2019t fight him.\u201d He let the tears roll down his cheeks. \u201cHe wants to kill. He needs to kill. Someone. You.\u201d</p><p>Sansa kept silent for a moment. Her hand stilled on his back. But she didn\u2019t walk away. She didn\u2019t turn around. She didn\u2019t leave him. Not yet. \u201cWhy?\u201d She took a deep breath and her hand started moving again. </p><p>\u201cThe thrill, the control, the power.

I love you that much that I will let hate into my heart.\u201d Her lips formed a straight line. \u201cI want that man dead, Jon.

Her eyes widened and her jaw dropped and she placed a hand on his back in an attempt to calm him down.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Sansa\u2026\u201d He hissed between his teeth. His chest moved up and down rapidly and he heard his own heart beating. \u201cYou have to get away from me. Now.\u201d He didn\u2019t dare to look at her. He didn\u2019t know how much longer he could fight himself. And he did know that the letter opener was near, within reach. </p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Sansa shook her head. One day her braveness would kill her. One day her life would end because she refused to run away from danger. One day she would die by his hand because she didn\u2019t want to give up on him.</p><p>He hated her for it. He loved her for it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She spoke softly and her hand kept on rubbing his back. \u201cTalk to me, Jon.\u201d Sansa spoke firm and Jon closed his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fight it.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if the words came out as a whisper or a growl. \u201cI can\u2019t fight him.\u201d He let the tears roll down his cheeks. \u201cHe wants to kill. He needs to kill. Someone. You.\u201d</p><p>Sansa kept silent for a moment. Her hand stilled on his back. But she didn\u2019t walk away. She didn\u2019t turn around. She didn\u2019t leave him. Not yet. \u201cWhy?\u201d She took a deep breath and her hand started moving again. </p><p>\u201cThe thrill, the control, the power. I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d He shook his head and once more he let his fist land on the bloodied desk. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few hours.\u201d Sansa straightened her back and lifted her chin. \u201cGive me a few hours.\u201d She licked her dry lips and Jon looked up, his eyes meeting hers. Her glance was filled with fire, with determination, with the kind of willpower Jon wished he possessed right now. \u201cA few hours is all I need.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what she was up to, how she was gonna save him, but what were a few more hours? He could give her a few more hours. He wanted to give her a few more hours. A few more hours to stop him. A few more hours to fight him. A few more hours to save him. He nodded. And while Sansa walked away to who knew where, he kept on repeating the same sentence over and over to pass the time. </p><p>A few more hours. Only a few more hours. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d </p><p>When he opened his eyes again the sun had set. Their shared bedroom was dark, the sheets crumbled because he had fallen asleep on top of them, still fully clothed. \u201cDid it work?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure what she had been doing, where she had been going. He was sure that the few hours she had needed, the few hours he had promised her, had passed. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She stepped closer. \u201cYet.\u201d Her voice wasn\u2019t trembling and when she reached out her hands to help him up her arms weren\u2019t shaking either. </p><p>He placed his hands in hers and leaned on her while he stepped out of the bed. \u201cWhen will you know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen you tell me it worked.\u201d Sansa kneeled down in front of him and double tied his shoe lashes. She stood up again and handed him his jacket. The palm of her hand touched his cheek before she pressed a soft kiss on his lips. \u201cGunthorpe street, 11pm.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cHis name is Martin Kenner. He killed two kids, but the judges let him go because he paid them an awful lot of money.\u201d </p><p>Jon furrowed his eyebrows and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your knife. Take your monster. Satisfy it.\u201d Sansa placed a hand on his chest. \u201cFeed it by killing someone who deserves to die.\u201d </p><p>He widened his eyes and stared at her. \u201cYou want me to kill\u2026\u201d He shook his head, but he felt the monster inside him waking up, stretching out its fingers, already looking forward to finally being unleashed tonight. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna lose you, Jon.\u201d She stepped back. \u201cAnd if I need to find you people to kill to keep you alive and with me, so be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d Jon took a deep breath. The innocence he had once fallen in love with was gone. The little girl she had once been had grown up. He had chased that innocent girl away. He had killed that part of her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you\u2026\u201d </p><p>She curled her lips up into a mocking smile. \u201cI am who I have to be for you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a killer. You\u2019re not a murderer. Your heart is filled with love, not with hate.\u201d Jon pleaded, but Sansa didn\u2019t crack, not even a little bit. </p><p>\u201cThe line between hate and love is fine, Jon. I love you. I love you that much that I will let hate into my heart.\u201d Her lips formed a straight line. \u201cI want that man dead, Jon. I want you to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded and he grabbed the back of her neck before he pressed his lips firmly on hers. Every time he thought he couldn\u2019t love her any more than he already did, he discovered that he still could. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d He stepped back and put his jacket on. \u201cAnd you deserve so much more and better than I can give.\u201d He didn\u2019t give her the chance to answer. </p><p>He opened the drawer and reached for his blinking knife. Smoothly, as if it had been only yesterday since he had held it, he hid it in a pocket designed to keep it safe. Without looking over his shoulder he walked through the door, down the stairs and left the house. </p><p>The night was quiet and cold. The wind blew in his face. It was the adrenaline that kept him warm. It was the monster that kept him going. </p><p>He buried his chin in his jacket. His dark curls hid most of his face. He united with the shadows, just like he had done so many years ago. Old habits never fully died. </p><p>This time he didn\u2019t have a reasonable motivation. He didn\u2019t have a broken heart he tried to heal. He didn\u2019t have a goal. He just wanted to kill. </p><p>He slowed down when he reached Gunthorpe street. He let his glance wander over the people crowding the area. He saw a hooker, begging for attention and money. He saw a tramp, hiding under the newspaper from three days ago. He saw a rich man, hopelessly out of place between the gamblers and the vagabonds, pretending he didn\u2019t belong here while his eyes wandered over the women he could take home with him tonight. </p><p>\u201cMister Kenner?\u201d Jon lifted his chin and straightened his back. </p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d The man raised his eyebrows while Jon approached. </p><p>\u201cI have an offer we need to discuss. One you can\u2019t refuse.\u201d Jon didn\u2019t know if the man would fall for the trick. \u201cIf you walk with me for a few minutes I will explain it to you.\u201d</p><p>Martin stared once more at the women fighting for whatever he had in his wallet. \u201cWhy not? None of them will be gone before I get back.\u201d He chuckled and the monster inside Jon started to roar, loudly, clearly and most of all hungry.</p><p>Jon led the man around a corner. Around another one and another one. And when they were out of sight he finally released the beast inside him. He curled his fingers around his knife and he buried his other hand in the man\u2019s hair. Without an explanation, without giving Martin the chance to realize what was happening, the sharp blade slid Kenner\u2019s throat. Jon watched the blood seeping down, staining Kenner\u2019s bright white shirt. Jon watched the lifeless body of the man collapse on the dirty cobbles in this dark neighborhood. Jon could almost feel the soul of the man being freed and descending to hell, where it belonged. </p><p>The monster smiled. It drank in the sight of blood. It devoured the image of the lifeless body. It basked in the adrenaline rushing through Jon\u2019s veins. And for the first time in weeks it calmed down and fell asleep.</p><p>With a satisfied smile on his face Jon put the knife away and walked back home. He greeted some people left and right. He politely declined offered services and invitations to shady bars. He took the shortest route \u00a0and threw the front door open without even attempting to be quiet. </p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Sansa rushed into the hallway. </p><p>\u201cIt worked.\u201d Jon exhaled and then the smile on his face brightened. </p><p>Sansa ran towards him and she threw her arms around his neck. Her lips kissed his and he kissed her back, eagerly. </p><p>He lifted her up and twirled her around. \u201cWhat would I do without you, Sansa Stark?\u201d Jon paused their kiss for a few seconds before he kissed her again. </p><p>\u201cNothing, Jon Snow, absolutely nothing.\u201d Sansa buried her hands in his curls and wrapped her legs around his waist.</p><p>She was right. Without her he\u2019d been nothing. Without her he maybe would have been dead. Without her he would be lost. </p><p>\u201cLet me know when the monster wakes up again. I\u2019m sure this city houses some more garbage it can live without.\u201d She whispered and while she kept on kissing him, he carried her upstairs, towards the bedroom. </p><p>And for the first time in weeks he didn\u2019t think about suffocating her with a pillow or slitting her throat. For the first time in weeks he only thought about making love to her for the rest of the night.</p></p>",

Without her he&rsquo;d been nothing. Without her he maybe would have been dead. Without her he would be lost. </p><p>&ldquo;Let me know when the monster wakes up again. I&rsquo;m sure this city houses some more garbage it can live without.&rdquo; She whispered and while she kept on kissing him, he carried her upstairs, towards the bedroom. </p><p>And for the first time in weeks he didn&rsquo;t think about suffocating her with a pillow or slitting her throat. For the first time in weeks he only thought about making love to her for the rest of the night.</p></p>",

He was trying so hard that it hurt. He kept on telling himself that he had promised her, that he couldn&rsquo;t disappoint her, that he couldn&rsquo;t betray her. But the more he tried to fight the monster inside of him, the bigger that monster seemed to grow. </p>\n<p>He couldn&rsquo;t hold a kitchen knife without feeling the urge to slid her throat and watch the blood dripping down her dress. He couldn&rsquo;t sleep next to her without wanting to grab her pillow and watch the fight and life seeping out of her. </p>\n<p>And he hated himself for it.</p>\n<p>She believed in him. She believed he could be a better man. She believed he could walk away from the alter ego his grief had created. She promised to heal him, to fix him, to save him. She didn&rsquo;t know how hard she was failing. She didn&rsquo;t know how hard he was failing.</p>\n<p>His fist landed on the wooden desk and a growl escaped his half closed lips. He didn&rsquo;t want to hurt anyone. He didn&rsquo;t want to kill anyone. He most of all didn&rsquo;t want to hurt of kill her. </p>\n<p>But the part of him that needed the thrill, the moment of ultimate power, the moment of being in control of life and death, didn&rsquo;t care who she was and what he had promised. That part needed blood. It needed death. It needed to take a life.</p>\n<p>His fist slammed on his desk again. And again. And again. A sharp pain spread through his hand and his entire arm. Drops of blood dripped on the expensive wood, staining it forever. He slammed again. And again. And again. But no matter how hard he slammed, no matter how many bones he bruised, no matter how much blood he lost, the monster in his chest just kept on laughing in his face.</p>\n</p>",

You can read it below or on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15295887\">AO3.</a><br/><br/><i>The terror, of falling down into the darkness washed over Sansa then it was gone. Nothingness surrounded her. The visions would appear.</i><i>Sansa watched the candles again on the second night. Jon was not with her. The sound of waves filled the room. Rough northern waves.</i> <i>She was at the beach house again. Her mouth started to form a smile. She scanned the beach for Jon or Ghost. Her smile faded when she saw a group a young teens in the distance.</i><br/></p><!-- more --><p><i>Then it was the girl and boy, it was not a girl, it was her. That was when Jon was still almost a head taller than her. \u00a0She remembered that day. He had followed her down the beach around a bend. It was warm, the end of summer. She was in a tiny yellow bikini top and little denim shorts. Jon only wore his a pair of basketball shorts. Hair not even growing on his face. He was saying something. Telling her not to go so far. She just laughed. He grumbled telling her that their parents had left him and Robb in charge at the beach house. &ldquo;What do you think I&rsquo;m gonna do, Jon Snow?&rdquo; she asked.\u00a0</i><br/></p><p><i>&ldquo;Gods, I don&rsquo;t know. Just don&rsquo;t go so far. It&rsquo;s bad enough trying to watch Arya,&rdquo; he said running a hand through his dark wavy hair. Sansa remembered admiring his strong muscled chest that day. <br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&hellip;&rdquo; she said.<br/>&ldquo;Then just come back, ok,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The tide might come in&hellip;then your stuck on some rocks&hellip;I don&rsquo;t understand&hellip;what are you doing over here&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The young Sansa twirled her hair and cocked her head to one side, &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m meeting a secret lover,&rdquo; she told him. Jon grew even more frustrated. <br/></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Where? Where is he,&rdquo; Jon asked. The younger Sansa couldn&rsquo;t help her self and laughed out loud. She stepped to Jon placing a hand on his chest.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. I was just going for a walk,&rdquo; she said. </i></p><p><i>Jon grabbed her wrist, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being silly. I&rsquo;m watching over you.&rdquo; Sansa watched the younger versions of herself and Jon stare into each other&rsquo;s eyes. A wave crashed against the large rock they were standing on. Younger Sansa fell towards Jon. There lips meeting. His arms wrapping around her. They kissed for longer than Sansa remembered. Their tongues searching each other&rsquo;s mouths. Jon&rsquo;s hands grasping her waist pulling her closer. Then there were voices in the distance. Arya was calling for them. They both broke apart. Younger Sansa pushed past Jon climbing over the boulders towards her sister&rsquo;s voice. </i></p><p><i>As the image faded, Sansa saw how troubled the younger Jon looked. They never spoke of that moment. So many terrible things happened after. Sansa had forgotten they shared a kiss so many years before. </i></p><p><i>Another vision came in it&rsquo;s place, Jon grew older, the surroundings darker. There was a car and Jon was outside, his hands wrapped around the neck of a woman, Cersei. The Hound was there making sure her guards were dead. Arya again called to Jon who rose to leave. She could see herself in the backseat of the car half-awake/half-drugged. Not long after the car sped away with Jon, Arya, the Hound, and Sansa inside a black van appeared. Tyrion Lannister jumped out with a bodyguard Sansa did not recognize. They looked around at the bodies. He pointed to Cersei&rsquo;s and instructed the man to move it and make sure she was dead. He laughed telling the man, he made sure she was drunk enough by the end of their meeting that when she confronted the Starks it would be an easy kill. Sansa still could hear his laugh as the image faded. More came faster and quicker not all she understood. Men from Essos delivery large crates of something on dark beaches. Tyrion visiting her at the rehab center. Asking if she wanted to be his wife, mocking her in her drugged state. The silver-haired dragon queen yelling at Tyrion, then at Jon, then at a series of men Sansa did not know. All the voices began to shout together. Light and shadows flashing. It took everything in her to toss the heavy blanket back over the candle. She had seen enough. </i></p><p><i>When Jon found her, she was huddled in the bed they had been sharing at the Inn at the Crossroads with a dazed expression. \u00a0He tried to tell her that Jaime Lannister had made good on his promise to expose Daenerys&rsquo; and the Windblown&rsquo;s alleged drug trade. The dragon queen had taken a much-needed hit. There were more Lords and Ladies that could not justify supporting her. </i><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Sansa responded with muffled sounds. Jon pressed her to tell him what had happened. She whispered all she had seen in the glass candle. Jon clutched his fist while he held her. The next morning the glass candle was gone. They left the Inn at the Crossroads for Harrenhal.</i></p><p><i>The large ancient castle had been burnt by dragon fire centuries before. Even though it had been restored, the towers still looked as if they were melting. Giant glass candles, Sansa thought. They were given a large suite of rooms in the East Tower that now acted as a hotel of sorts. She didn&rsquo;t see any more visions but her nightmares returned with a vengeance. The Great Council would be held in less than a week in Harrenhal&rsquo;s Great Keep. Every morning Jon held her when she woke in fear. His eyes would grow dark and he would make love to her. He said to comfort her. They both knew he liked it when she was vulnerable. She liked it when he was on top of her and whispered in her ear that he promised to kill their enemies. </i></p><p>*****<br/><b></b></p><p><b><b>Jon</b></b></p><p>The woman that used to be his sister entered the room Jon was using as an office at the top of the east tower of Harrenhal unannounced. A fierceness showing on her face that mirrored his own. Arya would never not be Jon&rsquo;s sister just as Sansa was never his sister in any real way. At least that&rsquo;s how he preferred to think about it. Watching Arya, Jon decided if he didn&rsquo;t know she was carrying a child, he would never think it. She bounded around the room with more energy than a she-wolf. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Let me kill him,&rdquo; she demanded, standing in front of the desk. Jon didn&rsquo;t look up from the laptop he was working on. \u00a0The Great Council at Harrenhal would begin in two days, there was still much to do.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said hoping Arya would leave him in peace. Instead, she plopped herself down in a chair on her side of the desk.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent Theon to bring him to us,&rdquo; Jon told her.</p><p>&ldquo;And you trust him?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;We should do this ourselves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Theon owes us. Owes Sansa&hellip;&rdquo; Jon prayed he had made the correct decision. Allowing Theon to go retrieve Tyrion Lannister from Dragonstone was a risk. He had not been loyal to their brother Robb in the past. \u00a0Sansa assured Jon that Theon had changed. So, Jon sent him to do their dirty work. He didn&rsquo;t like it but he was not about to let Arya think he was unsure of his own decision.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about this?&rdquo; Jon asked, pushing his laptop across the desk towards Arya. The headline of an article reported a major power outage on Dragonstone. Shrugging, Arya barely looked at the headline. Jon took that as a yes. Pulling his laptop back towards him, &ldquo;There are people on Dragonstone. People who we want to lead,&rdquo; he reminded her.</p><p>&ldquo;The attack was isolated. Just hit the castle. You know&hellip;slow them down a bit. Freeze a few bank accounts&hellip;,&rdquo; she said looking toward the window. Jon eyed her. She was wearing a loose grey t-shirt hanging over black leggings. High-top all-star converse sneakers tapping against the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;hmm&hellip;&rdquo; Jon said. Between Jaime Lannister leaking documents from an on-going investigation about possible drug trafficking by the dragon queen and Arya with the help of her new husband Ned Dayne, encouraging all manner of hacking, they were taking too many risks for Jon&rsquo;s taste. <i>And there would be more to come. </i>&ldquo;Careful Arya&hellip;if they find out it was us&hellip;&rdquo; he started to add.</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&hellip;I don&rsquo;t need to know any more,&rdquo; he said. He rubbed his temples before standing up to walk around the desk. &ldquo;Everyone is watching us. The election is in two days.&rdquo; Arya was quiet. Jon let her think things over for a few moments. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;How is Sansa?&rdquo; he asked. The dream she had had the night before left her upset. Jon hadn&rsquo;t wanted to leave her that morning. He had no choice. There was a long list of lords and ladies to meet, make promises too. \u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&hellip;.she&rsquo;ll be fine. You worry too much&hellip;&rdquo; Arya said twirling the pen between her fingers.</p><p>Jon shook his head, &ldquo;Neither of you should be here. Everything she&rsquo;s been through. And your&hellip;your&hellip;condition,&rdquo; he said pointing to Arya&rsquo;s stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh seven hells Jon, I&rsquo;m pregnant, not invalid,&rdquo; Arya said throwing the pen at his head. Jon ducked. Wanting to tell Arya that he was King in the North and could very well be the next King of the entire realm, he started to open his mouth.</p><p>There was a cell phone beep before he could continue to reprimand her. \u00a0Both Jon and Arya reached for their pockets. Jon looked at his not seeing an alert.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been spotted on the other side of the lake,&rdquo; she said after reading the message she received.</p><p>Jon glared at her, &ldquo;How&hellip;&rdquo; he started to ask before changing track. It didn&rsquo;t matter how she knew. &ldquo;I told you, I don&rsquo;t want you involved.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya ignored him texting a response to whoever, most likely someone from the Brotherhood, had messaged her. A response alert came almost immediately. &ldquo;Looks like they&rsquo;re headed to the Isle of Faces,&rdquo; she after reading the message.</p><p><i>I bloody well know where they&rsquo;re going,</i> Jon thought. He clutched his fist.</p><p>&ldquo;You were going there tonight and not going to tell us,&rdquo; she accused him. Jon didn&rsquo;t answer. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not going to happen,&rdquo; she said. With that Arya jumped up and sauntered out of the room, the door slamming behind her.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; Jon cursed staring at the door.</p><p>There was no doubt in his mind that Arya was headed straight for her sister&rsquo;s rooms. They would both insist on confronting Tyrion Lannister. Sansa would insist on more. Sitting back down at his desk, he rubbed his hands together. Toying with the idea of locking Sansa and Arya in the tower for the night. That was impossible. He was trying to bring justice down on the man who had helped Sansa&rsquo;s tormentors. A man who had actively helped Cersei Lannister imprison Sansa in a rehab center for months. Sansa would get her freedom. She would get the chance to confront him. She would get her kill if it was the last thing Jon did. He knew where ever Sansa went Arya was sure to follow. The whole thing made his head hurt more.</p><p>Night fell sooner than Jon would&rsquo;ve liked. He received confirmation from Theon that he and his men arrived on Isle of Faces with the &lsquo;cargo&rsquo;. Now, he stood on the shores of the God&rsquo;s Eye with Sansa and Arya on either side. They could see the Isle of Faces in the middle of the lake in the distance. The moon was full, it&rsquo;s reflection rippling across the dark water. Stars twinkling in the sky. The half-melted towers and keeps of the great castle of Harrenhal glowing dimly behind them.</p><p>Despite his conviction that Sansa get her kill, Jon had still tried to dissuade the women from joining him on this mission. It was too dangerous, he argued. There was a lot of talk about them being a pack of wolves from both in response. Jon relented if only to make them stop talking like their dead father. The man that used to be his father. The man the Lannister&rsquo;s killed so many years ago. The man that told his children that the 'pack survives&rsquo; everytime they fought amongst themselves. <i>Damnit if Ned Stark wasn&rsquo;t haunting him from the grave.</i></p><p>They rowed across the lake to the isle in silence. If Sansa and Arya insisted on coming Jon had at least ensured they were not seen. \u00a0Giving everyone not directly on their payroll the night off. Coming up with believable alibies for both in the form of private spa treatments. A record of the reservations and payments for appointments they would never keep. The boat rocked in the water. There was a gentle breeze that blew the wisps of Sansa&rsquo;s hair that escaped the dark grey hoody she wore. They all wore dark hoodies and dark jeans and dark sneakers. Backpacks with minimal supplies were in the bottom of the boat. He knew Arya and himself both carried guns and blades. Sansa had a flashlight and water. She had even brought a small first aid kit. Jon laughed at that. He hated taking them here. <i>Wolves kill together</i>, Arya had told him earlier. He tried to explain that he was also a dragon and could handle this on his own. Sansa insisted he could not. The boat bumped along the shore, he hopped out to drag it closer. Holding out a hand he helped Sansa and then Arya out and on to the shore. <br/></p><p>Walking on a narrow path that led from the shore of the island to the center. Every tree they passed had a face carved on it. Every so often Jon saw Sansa shine her flashlight on one of the trees. Faces old with mouths open, bloody sap pouring from their eyes. The stuff of children&rsquo;s nightmares. Sansa stared back at them. Challenging the faces to scare her. She even reached out to touch one or two. Jon tried not to look. As if they could see into the corners of his soul where no light had ever gone. Jon shivered.</p><p>The path wound uphill through the groves of trees, a few oaks and elms between the weirwoods. Arya led the way without a light. More cat than wolf he thought. Jon watched from behind keeping Sansa between them. There was the light of a campfire in the distance and the sound of voices. \u00a0They soon came upon a clearing with dozens of ancient weirwoods circling it.</p><p>In the clearing, there was an RV camper, Jon could see Theon sitting on a lawn chair a shotgun across his lap with two men from what was called the Sacred Order of the Green Men. The men that lived on the island in the middle of this massive lake. People said they practiced the dark arts. By the looks of them, Jon didn&rsquo;t doubt it. A campfire was blazing, there was a cooler between one of the men and Theon. All three had beers in their hands. By the looks of bottles tossed about, these were not their first beers of the night.</p><p>'Took you long enough Starks,&ldquo; Theon said a glint in his eyes and a smirk on his face.</p><p>'Where?&rdquo; Jon said.</p><p>&ldquo;This is a weird place,&rdquo; Theon said looking into the darkness around them. &ldquo;I like it.&rdquo; Jon focused his eyes. Arya prowled the perimeter. He could see a few other men in the shadows of the clearing. Not green men. Men from the Iron Isles, Theon&rsquo;s Ironborn crew. They were grumbling in disagreement. It was too far from the sea for them. Jon shook his head. The last thing they needed was more Ironborn in the area this close to the Great Council.</p><p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, meet the King in the North and his sisters or is it, cousins?&rdquo; Theon laughed. <br/>Jon sighed. Arya stopped moving and rolled her eyes. Theon got up and walked towards the RV with a slight wobble. The shotgun in one hand. &ldquo;Are you fucking both of them yet?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Shut up Theon,&rdquo; Arya said. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m married.&rdquo;</p><p>'Right..&ldquo; Theon laughed again. &quot;Things could change in a few days&hellip;a wolf like you with that pretty boy Ned Dayne&hellip;&rdquo; Arya growled while she moved back to Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s side.</p><p>&ldquo;I asked 'Where is he&rsquo;,&rdquo; Jon said again taking a step towards the Greyjoy. Theon motioned for them to follow him into the RV.</p><p>Jon followed him inside. Theon popped his head out to call for Arya and Sansa, &ldquo;Unless you ladies want to stay out here. I&rsquo;m sure my boys would love to entertain ya.&rdquo; That was all that needed to be said for Sansa and Arya to hurry into the RV. Arya giving one last scowl to some of the Ironborn men.</p><p>Once in the RV, Theon leaned his shotgun against a wall by the door. They sat at the small pop-out table. Jon and Sansa on one side. Theon and a Green man next to him on the other side. Arya leaned against the door with her arms folded. Jon and his former sisters had pulled down the hoods of their dark grey hoodies. The odd Green man remained silent. Perhaps, he was there as assurance. Whatever was agreed upon would be upheld. <br/><br/>The discussion went as Jon expected. Theon wanted certain concessions for having helped him out. Jon reminded Theon of how much trouble he and the Ironborn had caused the Starks by raiding their lands for centuries. Theon thought they were passed all that. <br/><br/>&ldquo;How about investment?&rdquo; Sansa said. Jon turned to face her in surprise. She had not spoken since they left the shore of the God&rsquo;s Eye for the island. Theon smiled and shook his finger at her.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I always liked you, princess,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You understand what a man wants. Shame you&rsquo;re with this one.&rdquo; Theon laughed as he motioned to Jon. Sansa pursed her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Careful,&rdquo; Jon growled. <br/>&ldquo;Alright&hellip;alright..you Starks always too serious. My sister&hellip;you know my sister Asha&hellip;she&rsquo;s one tough cunt&hellip;,&rdquo; Jon nodded trying to get Theon to get on with it. &ldquo;Well, she wants a promise of investment in our shipping business and some energy enterprise she likes,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; Sansa asked before Jon could respond.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh 5 million dragons, 10&hellip;&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;4 million dragons for the shipping and 1 million for the energy,&rdquo; she said. The Green man seemed to not notice the negotiations. Nor did Arya for that matter. Both were engaged in a staring contest with each other.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo; Theon questioned. &ldquo;Thought you had all that money you 'inherited&rsquo; from Petyr Baelish.&rdquo; Theon used air quotes around inherited. Jon&rsquo;s attention turned back to the discussion at hand. Sansa cringed. Before Cersei had her kidnapped, Sansa had Petyr Baelish put on trial for his crimes against the Starks. All his money became her money when he was sentenced to death and killed. Jon narrowed his eyes at Theon, clutching and unclutching his trigger hand. The thought that any of the money would go to the Greyjoys made him beyond frustrated.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, 2 million for the energy enterprise. We get stock in both businesses,&rdquo; She turned her head to her sister. &ldquo;And Arya is on the boards of both companies.&rdquo; Theon dumbfounded looked to Arya who was now fumbling with the pocket of her hoody pretending to re-organize the contents. She pulled out the small gun she was carrying just enough for Theon to see it. He seemed to stumble with his words.<br/>Jon leaned in, &ldquo;What do you say,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is very lucrative considering..&rdquo;</p><p>A smirk returned to Theon&rsquo;s face he turned to Sansa holding out his hand, &ldquo;I like a woman who can make a deal. My sister will be in touch. She likes you Starks.&rdquo; Sansa took his hand and shook on it. Arya moved closer to her sister. Theon rose, &ldquo;Shall we,&rdquo; he said as he made a gallant gesture for the door of the RV before picking up his shotgun and walking out.</p><p>Back outside, the campfire was still roaring. Some of the Ironborn men were tossing empty beer cans into the flames. There was a blue-greenish light radiating from the flames. Jon wondered if it was a trick of the other Green man who was hanging around the periphery.</p><p>&ldquo;Bring the imp,&rdquo; Theon shouted. &ldquo;Time for some fun.&rdquo; He slapped his thigh with his empty hand.</p><p>There were sounds from the bushes. Two more Ironborn appeared dragging a small figure between them. Jon heard Sansa gasped next to him. Arya pulled out her gun. Sansa stepped forward first. She stood in front of the imp, towering over him. She was even taller than one of the Ironborn men that held him. The firelight played with her hair, glints of copper even in this darkness. The shadows highlighting her fine cheekbones. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; Tyrion Lannister stuttered in a raspy voice. He was beaten and bloody. She stared down at him. \u00a0&quot;I can&hellip;I can explain&hellip;&ldquo;</p><p>She laughed and kneeled to face him. &quot;Can you? Did you think Daenerys would love you, if you helped her?&rdquo; she asked. \u00a0&quot;When Jon didn&rsquo;t come to her after I was gone. She would cry on your shoulder and you would comfort her. Or maybe it wasn&rsquo;t that at all&hellip;maybe it&rsquo;s me you wanted&hellip;wait I don&rsquo;t think I care.&ldquo;</p><p>Tyrion became desperate. &quot;Sansa I even moved Cersei&rsquo;s body for you&hellip;to make sure she was dead,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can help you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh to make sure our people couldn&rsquo;t take care of it.&rdquo; she shook her head. &ldquo;To increase our chances of getting caught. Or you just wanted to make sure your own sister was really dead.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion looked at her and then beyond her to Jon and Arya, the flames from the campfire flicking. Arya was admiring her gun for all to see, &ldquo;Sansa you&rsquo;re not a killer,&rdquo; he pleaded.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. Let him loose,&rdquo; she said standing. The Iron born loosened their grip on him. Tyrion stared back at her with a moment of relief. &ldquo;They said you were a giant among men,&rdquo; Sansa said as took a step forward. &ldquo;Run,&rdquo; she said. Tyrion was wide-eyed with fear.</p><p>The bile rose in Jon&rsquo;s stomach urging him to pounce. Arya&rsquo;s hand reached for his arm.</p><p>'This is hers,&ldquo; she told him. The imp turned and started running into the woods. Sansa held her hand out to Theon, who place the shotgun in it. She waiting for a few moments before aiming into the darkness. One shot rang out, then another. There was a loud moaning. They could hear the imp stumble. Sansa walked into the forest following the path Tyrion had run. Jon was right behind her. He turned to see Arya holding herself back, keeping an eye on the Ironborn.</p><p>When he reached Sansa, there were tears streaming down her face. Tyrion was moaning on the ground. He had run further than Jon expected. Sansa stood over him with the shotgun ready to fire. She was telling Tyrion this was his trial. This was his payment for the wrongs he had done. Jon reached for her arm whispering, &quot;You don&rsquo;t have, too.&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;Yes I do,&rdquo; she said. One last shot rang out. Blood splattered all over both of them. Tyrion was silent. Sansa lowered the shotgun. She fell to her knees her hands grasping at the dirty forest floor. Jon fell to his knees beside her.</p><p>There was an odd shifting of the ground. Jon swore that Tyrion&rsquo;s body started to sink into the soft dirt. There was a padding of feet approaching them. Low voices chanting words he couldn&rsquo;t understand. Sansa started breathing heavily. Jon took the shotgun from her and put his arms around her patting her hair. The two Green men appeared holding torches with an eery green glow.</p><p>&ldquo;Take her,&rdquo; the one man said to Jon pointing back towards the direction of the shore. He helped them stand.</p><p>&ldquo;What will you do with the body,&rdquo; Jon asked loosening his grip on Sansa. The man who Jon now noticed looked far more ancient than before, patted his arm.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The old gods bless the king who remembers to make a sacrifice.&rdquo; Sansa nodded seeming to understand. Jon shielded her as the walked back to the clearing to find Arya. He glanced back to see that Tyrion&rsquo;s body had sunk even deeper into the ground.</p><p>Arya was eyeing the Ironborn with another unhappy face when they reached the campfire. Jon tossed the gun to Theon. &ldquo;Clean this shit up. You&rsquo;ll get your investments. Word of this gets out and I&rsquo;ll geld everyone here,&rdquo; he said barely stopping his stride. \u00a0</p><p>Theon laughed again, &ldquo;Not the first man to threaten that Snow,&rdquo; he yelled.</p><p>Jon kept walking, his arm around Sansa who had pulled her hoody back up to hide her tear and blood-streaked face. Arya followed them holding a middle finger up to Theon as she went. &ldquo;Fuckin&rsquo; wolves,&rdquo; Theon murmured kicking a can.</p><p>Jon got them to the boat as quickly as he could. Sansa stared straight ahead as Arya rowed back to the shore near Harrenhal. Her hands kneading together, her long auburn waves sticking out of the hood and blowing in the wind. It was still cold at night even this far south. It wasn&rsquo;t until they reached their suite in the old tower that Jon looked down at his bloody hands then looked at both of them. Blood speckled on their hands and faces. Smears on her cheeks where Jon had tried to wipe away her tears. Dirt in his nails, had he pushed Tyrion into the ground? Jon couldn&rsquo;t even remember.<br/></p><p>He mumbled something about washing to Sansa and moved toward the bathroom. She grabbed his arm to stop him. <i>Oh Sansa, you do not want this. </i>Pulling just a little, so that he would turn toward her. He started to shake his head but her lips found his. His dirty bloody hands moved to her neck then her cheeks. Kissing her as hard as he could, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want this,&rdquo; he said. She kept kissing him. Pulling at their clothes until both their hoodies were off then the t-shirts underneath. Sansa had not said one word since they left the island.</p><p>Pushing her on to the bed. The full weight on his body pressing down on her. His bare chest touching hers. She had not been wearing a bra he realized. Jon never knew Sansa to forgo a bra. \u00a0Deciding he liked it, he grasped her wrists to lift them above her head. Sucking on one nipple and then the other until they were firm. Pushing his hips down harder, forcing her legs apart. He used one hand to hold her wrists together above her head, while the other fumbled with the button on her jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck Sansa,&rdquo; he said before biting her neck. He wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get her pants off with one hand. Releasing her wrists, he lifted himself off the bed in frustration. His dick was throbbing. &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; he commanded. Sansa did as he said. <i>Gods there was bloody smudges all over them. </i>Then he told her to take off her pants and she did that too. Staring at her naked body for a moment. In one swift motion, he turned her around. Forcing her shoulders forward, he guided her onto the bed telling her to get on all fours. She did that too. Jon undid the button on his pants then the zipper. Pulling his hard dick out, he stroked himself while his fingers found her warm wet cunt. He laughed, she was already wet.</p><p>Thrusting into her, she grasped. The first sound she had made. Jon could tell she was trying to stifle her moans. <i>That would not do.</i> He took her hard and fast. Telling her to say his name. She did that too. Everything he asked she did. She even reached her climax when he demanded it while he rubbed her swollen clit and thrust into her. Pulling away from her, he spilled his seed on her back. \u00a0His breath heavy, he put his hands on the bed on either side of her leaning down. Sansa sunk lower onto the bed, curling onto her side. She turned her head and their eyes met. Jon held her gaze, drowning in her blue eyes. With a heave, he stood up to go to the bathroom to get a towel. They were both covered in dirt and blood and now his seed. When he returned he cleaned her back then pulled the covers over her. She fell asleep curled into a ball. Jon laid next to her staring up at the ceiling. They had killed together. \u00a0<i>No, we made a sacrifice. A gift to the Old Gods. \u00a0</i></p><p>He woke that morning to the sound of the shower running and a soft voice singing. The sheets were clean, their bloody clothes were gone. Jon hoped for a moment that it was all a dream. Then he heard Brienne and Satin&rsquo;s voices in the other room of their suite. One was asking the other if everything was burnt. Jon groaned reaching for his mobile phone that someone had put on the nightstand next to the bed. The date said it was the first day of the fifth month. Jon wondered if there was still snow in the far north.</p>",

Her smile faded when she saw a group a young teens in the distance.</i><br></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>Then it was the girl and boy, it was not a girl, it was her. That was when Jon was still almost a head taller than her. \u00a0She remembered that day. He had followed her down the beach around a bend. It was warm, the end of summer. She was in a tiny yellow bikini top and little denim shorts. Jon only wore his a pair of basketball shorts. Hair not even growing on his face. He was saying something. Telling her not to go so far. She just laughed. He grumbled telling her that their parents had left him and Robb in charge at the beach house. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m gonna do, Jon Snow?\u201d she asked.\u00a0</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cGods, I don\u2019t know. Just don\u2019t go so far. It\u2019s bad enough trying to watch Arya,\u201d he said running a hand through his dark wavy hair. Sansa remembered admiring his strong muscled chest that day. <br>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\u201d she said.<br>\u201cThen just come back, ok,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tide might come in\u2026then your stuck on some rocks\u2026I don\u2019t understand\u2026what are you doing over here\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>The young Sansa twirled her hair and cocked her head to one side, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m meeting a secret lover,\u201d she told him. Jon grew even more frustrated. <br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhere? Where is he,\u201d Jon asked. The younger Sansa couldn\u2019t help her self and laughed out loud. She stepped to Jon placing a hand on his chest.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I was just going for a walk,\u201d she said. </i></p><p><i>Jon grabbed her wrist, \u201cI\u2019m not being silly. I\u2019m watching over you.\u201d Sansa watched the younger versions of herself and Jon stare into each other\u2019s eyes. A wave crashed against the large rock they were standing on. Younger Sansa fell towards Jon. There lips meeting. His arms wrapping around her. They kissed for longer than Sansa remembered. Their tongues searching each other\u2019s mouths. Jon\u2019s hands grasping her waist pulling her closer. Then there were voices in the distance. Arya was calling for them. They both broke apart. Younger Sansa pushed past Jon climbing over the boulders towards her sister\u2019s voice. </i></p><p><i>As the image faded, Sansa saw how troubled the younger Jon looked. They never spoke of that moment. So many terrible things happened after. Sansa had forgotten they shared a kiss so many years before. </i></p><p><i>Another vision came in it\u2019s place, Jon grew older, the surroundings darker. There was a car and Jon was outside, his hands wrapped around the neck of a woman, Cersei. The Hound was there making sure her guards were dead. Arya again called to Jon who rose to leave. She could see herself in the backseat of the car half-awake/half-drugged. Not long after the car sped away with Jon, Arya, the Hound, and Sansa inside a black van appeared. Tyrion Lannister jumped out with a bodyguard Sansa did not recognize. They looked around at the bodies. He pointed to Cersei\u2019s and instructed the man to move it and make sure she was dead. He laughed telling the man, he made sure she was drunk enough by the end of their meeting that when she confronted the Starks it would be an easy kill. Sansa still could hear his laugh as the image faded. More came faster and quicker not all she understood. Men from Essos delivery large crates of something on dark beaches. Tyrion visiting her at the rehab center. Asking if she wanted to be his wife, mocking her in her drugged state. The silver-haired dragon queen yelling at Tyrion, then at Jon, then at a series of men Sansa did not know. All the voices began to shout together. Light and shadows flashing. It took everything in her to toss the heavy blanket back over the candle. She had seen enough. </i></p><p><i>When Jon found her, she was huddled in the bed they had been sharing at the Inn at the Crossroads with a dazed expression. \u00a0He tried to tell her that Jaime Lannister had made good on his promise to expose Daenerys\u2019 and the Windblown\u2019s alleged drug trade. The dragon queen had taken a much-needed hit. There were more Lords and Ladies that could not justify supporting her. </i><i><br></i></p><p><i>Sansa responded with muffled sounds. Jon pressed her to tell him what had happened. She whispered all she had seen in the glass candle. Jon clutched his fist while he held her. The next morning the glass candle was gone. They left the Inn at the Crossroads for Harrenhal.</i></p><p><i>The large ancient castle had been burnt by dragon fire centuries before. Even though it had been restored, the towers still looked as if they were melting. Giant glass candles, Sansa thought. They were given a large suite of rooms in the East Tower that now acted as a hotel of sorts. She didn\u2019t see any more visions but her nightmares returned with a vengeance. The Great Council would be held in less than a week in Harrenhal\u2019s Great Keep. Every morning Jon held her when she woke in fear. His eyes would grow dark and he would make love to her. He said to comfort her. They both knew he liked it when she was vulnerable. She liked it when he was on top of her and whispered in her ear that he promised to kill their enemies. </i></p><p>*****<br><b></b></p><p><b><b>Jon</b></b></p><p>The woman that used to be his sister entered the room Jon was using as an office at the top of the east tower of Harrenhal unannounced. A fierceness showing on her face that mirrored his own. Arya would never not be Jon\u2019s sister just as Sansa was never his sister in any real way. At least that\u2019s how he preferred to think about it. Watching Arya, Jon decided if he didn\u2019t know she was carrying a child, he would never think it. She bounded around the room with more energy than a she-wolf. <br></p><p>\u201cLet me kill him,\u201d she demanded, standing in front of the desk. Jon didn\u2019t look up from the laptop he was working on. \u00a0The Great Council at Harrenhal would begin in two days, there was still much to do.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said hoping Arya would leave him in peace. Instead, she plopped herself down in a chair on her side of the desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent Theon to bring him to us,\u201d Jon told her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you trust him?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe should do this ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cTheon owes us. Owes Sansa\u2026\u201d Jon prayed he had made the correct decision. Allowing Theon to go retrieve Tyrion Lannister from Dragonstone was a risk. He had not been loyal to their brother Robb in the past. \u00a0Sansa assured Jon that Theon had changed. So, Jon sent him to do their dirty work. He didn\u2019t like it but he was not about to let Arya think he was unsure of his own decision.</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about this?\u201d Jon asked, pushing his laptop across the desk towards Arya. The headline of an article reported a major power outage on Dragonstone. Shrugging, Arya barely looked at the headline. Jon took that as a yes. Pulling his laptop back towards him, \u201cThere are people on Dragonstone. People who we want to lead,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThe attack was isolated. Just hit the castle. You know\u2026slow them down a bit. Freeze a few bank accounts\u2026,\u201d she said looking toward the window. Jon eyed her. She was wearing a loose grey t-shirt hanging over black leggings. High-top all-star converse sneakers tapping against the floor.</p><p>\u201chmm\u2026\u201d Jon said. Between Jaime Lannister leaking documents from an on-going investigation about possible drug trafficking by the dragon queen and Arya with the help of her new husband Ned Dayne, encouraging all manner of hacking, they were taking too many risks for Jon\u2019s taste. <i>And there would be more to come. </i>\u201cCareful Arya\u2026if they find out it was us\u2026\u201d he started to add.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t us,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t need to know any more,\u201d he said. He rubbed his temples before standing up to walk around the desk. \u201cEveryone is watching us. The election is in two days.\u201d Arya was quiet. Jon let her think things over for a few moments. <br></p><p>\u201cHow is Sansa?\u201d he asked. The dream she had had the night before left her upset. Jon hadn\u2019t wanted to leave her that morning. He had no choice. There was a long list of lords and ladies to meet, make promises too. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026.she\u2019ll be fine. You worry too much\u2026\u201d Arya said twirling the pen between her fingers.</p><p>Jon shook his head, \u201cNeither of you should be here. Everything she\u2019s been through. And your\u2026your\u2026condition,\u201d he said pointing to Arya\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cOh seven hells Jon, I\u2019m pregnant, not invalid,\u201d Arya said throwing the pen at his head. Jon ducked. Wanting to tell Arya that he was King in the North and could very well be the next King of the entire realm, he started to open his mouth.</p><p>There was a cell phone beep before he could continue to reprimand her. \u00a0Both Jon and Arya reached for their pockets. Jon looked at his not seeing an alert.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been spotted on the other side of the lake,\u201d she said after reading the message she received.</p><p>Jon glared at her, \u201cHow\u2026\u201d he started to ask before changing track. It didn\u2019t matter how she knew. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t want you involved.\u201d</p><p>Arya ignored him texting a response to whoever, most likely someone from the Brotherhood, had messaged her. A response alert came almost immediately. \u201cLooks like they\u2019re headed to the Isle of Faces,\u201d she after reading the message.</p><p><i>I bloody well know where they\u2019re going,</i> Jon thought. He clutched his fist.</p><p>\u201cYou were going there tonight and not going to tell us,\u201d she accused him. Jon didn\u2019t answer. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d she said. With that Arya jumped up and sauntered out of the room, the door slamming behind her.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Jon cursed staring at the door.</p><p>There was no doubt in his mind that Arya was headed straight for her sister\u2019s rooms. They would both insist on confronting Tyrion Lannister. Sansa would insist on more. Sitting back down at his desk, he rubbed his hands together. Toying with the idea of locking Sansa and Arya in the tower for the night. That was impossible. He was trying to bring justice down on the man who had helped Sansa\u2019s tormentors. A man who had actively helped Cersei Lannister imprison Sansa in a rehab center for months. Sansa would get her freedom. She would get the chance to confront him. She would get her kill if it was the last thing Jon did. He knew where ever Sansa went Arya was sure to follow. The whole thing made his head hurt more.</p><p>Night fell sooner than Jon would\u2019ve liked. He received confirmation from Theon that he and his men arrived on Isle of Faces with the \u2018cargo\u2019. Now, he stood on the shores of the God\u2019s Eye with Sansa and Arya on either side. They could see the Isle of Faces in the middle of the lake in the distance. The moon was full, it\u2019s reflection rippling across the dark water. Stars twinkling in the sky. The half-melted towers and keeps of the great castle of Harrenhal glowing dimly behind them.</p><p>Despite his conviction that Sansa get her kill, Jon had still tried to dissuade the women from joining him on this mission. It was too dangerous, he argued. There was a lot of talk about them being a pack of wolves from both in response. Jon relented if only to make them stop talking like their dead father. The man that used to be his father. The man the Lannister\u2019s killed so many years ago. The man that told his children that the 'pack survives\u2019 everytime they fought amongst themselves. <i>Damnit if Ned Stark wasn\u2019t haunting him from the grave.</i></p><p>They rowed across the lake to the isle in silence. If Sansa and Arya insisted on coming Jon had at least ensured they were not seen. \u00a0Giving everyone not directly on their payroll the night off. Coming up with believable alibies for both in the form of private spa treatments. A record of the reservations and payments for appointments they would never keep. The boat rocked in the water. There was a gentle breeze that blew the wisps of Sansa\u2019s hair that escaped the dark grey hoody she wore. They all wore dark hoodies and dark jeans and dark sneakers. Backpacks with minimal supplies were in the bottom of the boat. He knew Arya and himself both carried guns and blades. Sansa had a flashlight and water. She had even brought a small first aid kit. Jon laughed at that. He hated taking them here. <i>Wolves kill together</i>, Arya had told him earlier. He tried to explain that he was also a dragon and could handle this on his own. Sansa insisted he could not. The boat bumped along the shore, he hopped out to drag it closer. Holding out a hand he helped Sansa and then Arya out and on to the shore. <br></p><p>Walking on a narrow path that led from the shore of the island to the center. Every tree they passed had a face carved on it. Every so often Jon saw Sansa shine her flashlight on one of the trees. Faces old with mouths open, bloody sap pouring from their eyes. The stuff of children\u2019s nightmares. Sansa stared back at them. Challenging the faces to scare her. She even reached out to touch one or two. Jon tried not to look. As if they could see into the corners of his soul where no light had ever gone. Jon shivered.</p><p>The path wound uphill through the groves of trees, a few oaks and elms between the weirwoods. Arya led the way without a light. More cat than wolf he thought. Jon watched from behind keeping Sansa between them. There was the light of a campfire in the distance and the sound of voices. \u00a0They soon came upon a clearing with dozens of ancient weirwoods circling it.</p><p>In the clearing, there was an RV camper, Jon could see Theon sitting on a lawn chair a shotgun across his lap with two men from what was called the Sacred Order of the Green Men. The men that lived on the island in the middle of this massive lake. People said they practiced the dark arts. By the looks of them, Jon didn\u2019t doubt it. A campfire was blazing, there was a cooler between one of the men and Theon. All three had beers in their hands. By the looks of bottles tossed about, these were not their first beers of the night.</p><p>'Took you long enough Starks,\u201c Theon said a glint in his eyes and a smirk on his face.</p><p>'Where?\u201d Jon said.</p><p>\u201cThis is a weird place,\u201d Theon said looking into the darkness around them. \u201cI like it.\u201d Jon focused his eyes. Arya prowled the perimeter. He could see a few other men in the shadows of the clearing. Not green men. Men from the Iron Isles, Theon\u2019s Ironborn crew. They were grumbling in disagreement. It was too far from the sea for them. Jon shook his head. The last thing they needed was more Ironborn in the area this close to the Great Council.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, meet the King in the North and his sisters or is it, cousins?\u201d Theon laughed. <br>Jon sighed. Arya stopped moving and rolled her eyes. Theon got up and walked towards the RV with a slight wobble. The shotgun in one hand. \u201cAre you fucking both of them yet?\u201d<br><br>\u201cShut up Theon,\u201d Arya said. \u201cYou know I\u2019m married.\u201d</p><p>'Right..\u201c Theon laughed again. \"Things could change in a few days\u2026a wolf like you with that pretty boy Ned Dayne\u2026\u201d Arya growled while she moved back to Jon and Sansa\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cI asked 'Where is he\u2019,\u201d Jon said again taking a step towards the Greyjoy. Theon motioned for them to follow him into the RV.</p><p>Jon followed him inside. Theon popped his head out to call for Arya and Sansa, \u201cUnless you ladies want to stay out here. I\u2019m sure my boys would love to entertain ya.\u201d That was all that needed to be said for Sansa and Arya to hurry into the RV. Arya giving one last scowl to some of the Ironborn men.</p><p>Once in the RV, Theon leaned his shotgun against a wall by the door. They sat at the small pop-out table. Jon and Sansa on one side. Theon and a Green man next to him on the other side. Arya leaned against the door with her arms folded. Jon and his former sisters had pulled down the hoods of their dark grey hoodies. The odd Green man remained silent. Perhaps, he was there as assurance. Whatever was agreed upon would be upheld. <br><br>The discussion went as Jon expected. Theon wanted certain concessions for having helped him out. Jon reminded Theon of how much trouble he and the Ironborn had caused the Starks by raiding their lands for centuries. Theon thought they were passed all that. <br><br>\u201cHow about investment?\u201d Sansa said. Jon turned to face her in surprise. She had not spoken since they left the shore of the God\u2019s Eye for the island. Theon smiled and shook his finger at her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I always liked you, princess,\u201d he said. \u201cYou understand what a man wants. Shame you\u2019re with this one.\u201d Theon laughed as he motioned to Jon. Sansa pursed her lips.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Jon growled. <br>\u201cAlright\u2026alright..you Starks always too serious. My sister\u2026you know my sister Asha\u2026she\u2019s one tough cunt\u2026,\u201d Jon nodded trying to get Theon to get on with it. \u201cWell, she wants a promise of investment in our shipping business and some energy enterprise she likes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Sansa asked before Jon could respond.</p><p>\u201cOh 5 million dragons, 10\u2026\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201c4 million dragons for the shipping and 1 million for the energy,\u201d she said. The Green man seemed to not notice the negotiations. Nor did Arya for that matter. Both were engaged in a staring contest with each other.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Theon questioned. \u201cThought you had all that money you 'inherited\u2019 from Petyr Baelish.\u201d Theon used air quotes around inherited. Jon\u2019s attention turned back to the discussion at hand. Sansa cringed. Before Cersei had her kidnapped, Sansa had Petyr Baelish put on trial for his crimes against the Starks. All his money became her money when he was sentenced to death and killed. Jon narrowed his eyes at Theon, clutching and unclutching his trigger hand. The thought that any of the money would go to the Greyjoys made him beyond frustrated.</p><p>\u201cFine, 2 million for the energy enterprise. We get stock in both businesses,\u201d She turned her head to her sister. \u201cAnd Arya is on the boards of both companies.\u201d Theon dumbfounded looked to Arya who was now fumbling with the pocket of her hoody pretending to re-organize the contents. She pulled out the small gun she was carrying just enough for Theon to see it. He seemed to stumble with his words.<br>Jon leaned in, \u201cWhat do you say,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is very lucrative considering..\u201d</p><p>A smirk returned to Theon\u2019s face he turned to Sansa holding out his hand, \u201cI like a woman who can make a deal. My sister will be in touch. She likes you Starks.\u201d Sansa took his hand and shook on it. Arya moved closer to her sister. Theon rose, \u201cShall we,\u201d he said as he made a gallant gesture for the door of the RV before picking up his shotgun and walking out.</p><p>Back outside, the campfire was still roaring. Some of the Ironborn men were tossing empty beer cans into the flames. There was a blue-greenish light radiating from the flames. Jon wondered if it was a trick of the other Green man who was hanging around the periphery.</p><p>\u201cBring the imp,\u201d Theon shouted. \u201cTime for some fun.\u201d He slapped his thigh with his empty hand.</p><p>There were sounds from the bushes. Two more Ironborn appeared dragging a small figure between them. Jon heard Sansa gasped next to him. Arya pulled out her gun. Sansa stepped forward first. She stood in front of the imp, towering over him. She was even taller than one of the Ironborn men that held him. The firelight played with her hair, glints of copper even in this darkness. The shadows highlighting her fine cheekbones. <br></p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Tyrion Lannister stuttered in a raspy voice. He was beaten and bloody. She stared down at him. \u00a0\"I can\u2026I can explain\u2026\u201c</p><p>She laughed and kneeled to face him. \"Can you? Did you think Daenerys would love you, if you helped her?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\"When Jon didn\u2019t come to her after I was gone. She would cry on your shoulder and you would comfort her. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t that at all\u2026maybe it\u2019s me you wanted\u2026wait I don\u2019t think I care.\u201c</p><p>Tyrion became desperate. \"Sansa I even moved Cersei\u2019s body for you\u2026to make sure she was dead,\u201d he said. \u201cI can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh to make sure our people couldn\u2019t take care of it.\u201d she shook her head. \u201cTo increase our chances of getting caught. Or you just wanted to make sure your own sister was really dead.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion looked at her and then beyond her to Jon and Arya, the flames from the campfire flicking. Arya was admiring her gun for all to see, \u201cSansa you\u2019re not a killer,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Let him loose,\u201d she said standing. The Iron born loosened their grip on him. Tyrion stared back at her with a moment of relief. \u201cThey said you were a giant among men,\u201d Sansa said as took a step forward. \u201cRun,\u201d she said. Tyrion was wide-eyed with fear.</p><p>The bile rose in Jon\u2019s stomach urging him to pounce. Arya\u2019s hand reached for his arm.</p><p>'This is hers,\u201c she told him. The imp turned and started running into the woods. Sansa held her hand out to Theon, who place the shotgun in it. She waiting for a few moments before aiming into the darkness. One shot rang out, then another. There was a loud moaning. They could hear the imp stumble. Sansa walked into the forest following the path Tyrion had run. Jon was right behind her. He turned to see Arya holding herself back, keeping an eye on the Ironborn.</p><p>When he reached Sansa, there were tears streaming down her face. Tyrion was moaning on the ground. He had run further than Jon expected. Sansa stood over him with the shotgun ready to fire. She was telling Tyrion this was his trial. This was his payment for the wrongs he had done. Jon reached for her arm whispering, \"You don\u2019t have, too.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYes I do,\u201d she said. One last shot rang out. Blood splattered all over both of them. Tyrion was silent. Sansa lowered the shotgun. She fell to her knees her hands grasping at the dirty forest floor. Jon fell to his knees beside her.</p><p>There was an odd shifting of the ground. Jon swore that Tyrion\u2019s body started to sink into the soft dirt. There was a padding of feet approaching them. Low voices chanting words he couldn\u2019t understand. Sansa started breathing heavily. Jon took the shotgun from her and put his arms around her patting her hair. The two Green men appeared holding torches with an eery green glow.</p><p>\u201cTake her,\u201d the one man said to Jon pointing back towards the direction of the shore. He helped them stand.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do with the body,\u201d Jon asked loosening his grip on Sansa. The man who Jon now noticed looked far more ancient than before, patted his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old gods bless the king who remembers to make a sacrifice.\u201d Sansa nodded seeming to understand. Jon shielded her as the walked back to the clearing to find Arya. He glanced back to see that Tyrion\u2019s body had sunk even deeper into the ground.</p><p>Arya was eyeing the Ironborn with another unhappy face when they reached the campfire. Jon tossed the gun to Theon. \u201cClean this shit up. You\u2019ll get your investments. Word of this gets out and I\u2019ll geld everyone here,\u201d he said barely stopping his stride. \u00a0</p><p>Theon laughed again, \u201cNot the first man to threaten that Snow,\u201d he yelled.</p><p>Jon kept walking, his arm around Sansa who had pulled her hoody back up to hide her tear and blood-streaked face. Arya followed them holding a middle finger up to Theon as she went. \u201cFuckin\u2019 wolves,\u201d Theon murmured kicking a can.</p><p>Jon got them to the boat as quickly as he could. Sansa stared straight ahead as Arya rowed back to the shore near Harrenhal. Her hands kneading together, her long auburn waves sticking out of the hood and blowing in the wind. It was still cold at night even this far south. It wasn\u2019t until they reached their suite in the old tower that Jon looked down at his bloody hands then looked at both of them. Blood speckled on their hands and faces. Smears on her cheeks where Jon had tried to wipe away her tears. Dirt in his nails, had he pushed Tyrion into the ground? Jon couldn\u2019t even remember.<br></p><p>He mumbled something about washing to Sansa and moved toward the bathroom. She grabbed his arm to stop him. <i>Oh Sansa, you do not want this. </i>Pulling just a little, so that he would turn toward her. He started to shake his head but her lips found his. His dirty bloody hands moved to her neck then her cheeks. Kissing her as hard as he could, \u201cYou don\u2019t want this,\u201d he said. She kept kissing him. Pulling at their clothes until both their hoodies were off then the t-shirts underneath. Sansa had not said one word since they left the island.</p><p>Pushing her on to the bed. The full weight on his body pressing down on her. His bare chest touching hers. She had not been wearing a bra he realized. Jon never knew Sansa to forgo a bra. \u00a0Deciding he liked it, he grasped her wrists to lift them above her head. Sucking on one nipple and then the other until they were firm. Pushing his hips down harder, forcing her legs apart. He used one hand to hold her wrists together above her head, while the other fumbled with the button on her jeans.</p><p>\u201cFuck Sansa,\u201d he said before biting her neck. He wouldn\u2019t be able to get her pants off with one hand. Releasing her wrists, he lifted himself off the bed in frustration. His dick was throbbing. \u201cGet up,\u201d he commanded. Sansa did as he said. <i>Gods there was bloody smudges all over them. </i>Then he told her to take off her pants and she did that too. Staring at her naked body for a moment. In one swift motion, he turned her around. Forcing her shoulders forward, he guided her onto the bed telling her to get on all fours. She did that too. Jon undid the button on his pants then the zipper. Pulling his hard dick out, he stroked himself while his fingers found her warm wet cunt. He laughed, she was already wet.</p><p>Thrusting into her, she grasped. The first sound she had made. Jon could tell she was trying to stifle her moans. <i>That would not do.</i> He took her hard and fast. Telling her to say his name. She did that too. Everything he asked she did. She even reached her climax when he demanded it while he rubbed her swollen clit and thrust into her. Pulling away from her, he spilled his seed on her back. \u00a0His breath heavy, he put his hands on the bed on either side of her leaning down. Sansa sunk lower onto the bed, curling onto her side. She turned her head and their eyes met. Jon held her gaze, drowning in her blue eyes. With a heave, he stood up to go to the bathroom to get a towel. They were both covered in dirt and blood and now his seed. When he returned he cleaned her back then pulled the covers over her. She fell asleep curled into a ball. Jon laid next to her staring up at the ceiling. They had killed together. \u00a0<i>No, we made a sacrifice. A gift to the Old Gods. \u00a0</i></p><p>He woke that morning to the sound of the shower running and a soft voice singing. The sheets were clean, their bloody clothes were gone. Jon hoped for a moment that it was all a dream. Then he heard Brienne and Satin\u2019s voices in the other room of their suite. One was asking the other if everything was burnt. Jon groaned reaching for his mobile phone that someone had put on the nightstand next to the bed. The date said it was the first day of the fifth month. Jon wondered if there was still snow in the far north.</p>",

You can read it below or on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15295887\">AO3.</a><br><br><i>The terror, of falling down into the darkness washed over Sansa then it was gone. Nothingness surrounded her. The visions would appear.</i><i>Sansa watched the candles again on the second night. Jon was not with her. The sound of waves filled the room. Rough northern waves.</i> <i>She was at the beach house again. Her mouth started to form a smile. She scanned the beach for Jon or Ghost. Her smile faded when she saw a group a young teens in the distance.</i><br></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>Then it was the girl and boy, it was not a girl, it was her. That was when Jon was still almost a head taller than her. \u00a0She remembered that day. He had followed her down the beach around a bend. It was warm, the end of summer. She was in a tiny yellow bikini top and little denim shorts. Jon only wore his a pair of basketball shorts. Hair not even growing on his face. He was saying something. Telling her not to go so far. She just laughed. He grumbled telling her that their parents had left him and Robb in charge at the beach house. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m gonna do, Jon Snow?\u201d she asked.\u00a0</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cGods, I don\u2019t know. Just don\u2019t go so far. It\u2019s bad enough trying to watch Arya,\u201d he said running a hand through his dark wavy hair. Sansa remembered admiring his strong muscled chest that day. <br>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\u201d she said.<br>\u201cThen just come back, ok,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tide might come in\u2026then your stuck on some rocks\u2026I don\u2019t understand\u2026what are you doing over here\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>The young Sansa twirled her hair and cocked her head to one side, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m meeting a secret lover,\u201d she told him. Jon grew even more frustrated. <br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhere? Where is he,\u201d Jon asked. The younger Sansa couldn\u2019t help her self and laughed out loud. She stepped to Jon placing a hand on his chest.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I was just going for a walk,\u201d she said. </i></p><p><i>Jon grabbed her wrist, \u201cI\u2019m not being silly. I\u2019m watching over you.\u201d Sansa watched the younger versions of herself and Jon stare into each other\u2019s eyes. A wave crashed against the large rock they were standing on. Younger Sansa fell towards Jon. There lips meeting. His arms wrapping around her. They kissed for longer than Sansa remembered. Their tongues searching each other\u2019s mouths. Jon\u2019s hands grasping her waist pulling her closer. Then there were voices in the distance. Arya was calling for them. They both broke apart. Younger Sansa pushed past Jon climbing over the boulders towards her sister\u2019s voice. </i></p><p><i>As the image faded, Sansa saw how troubled the younger Jon looked. They never spoke of that moment. So many terrible things happened after. Sansa had forgotten they shared a kiss so many years before. </i></p><p><i>Another vision came in it\u2019s place, Jon grew older, the surroundings darker. There was a car and Jon was outside, his hands wrapped around the neck of a woman, Cersei. The Hound was there making sure her guards were dead. Arya again called to Jon who rose to leave. She could see herself in the backseat of the car half-awake/half-drugged. Not long after the car sped away with Jon, Arya, the Hound, and Sansa inside a black van appeared. Tyrion Lannister jumped out with a bodyguard Sansa did not recognize. They looked around at the bodies. He pointed to Cersei\u2019s and instructed the man to move it and make sure she was dead. He laughed telling the man, he made sure she was drunk enough by the end of their meeting that when she confronted the Starks it would be an easy kill. Sansa still could hear his laugh as the image faded. More came faster and quicker not all she understood. Men from Essos delivery large crates of something on dark beaches. Tyrion visiting her at the rehab center. Asking if she wanted to be his wife, mocking her in her drugged state. The silver-haired dragon queen yelling at Tyrion, then at Jon, then at a series of men Sansa did not know. All the voices began to shout together. Light and shadows flashing. It took everything in her to toss the heavy blanket back over the candle. She had seen enough. </i></p><p><i>When Jon found her, she was huddled in the bed they had been sharing at the Inn at the Crossroads with a dazed expression. \u00a0He tried to tell her that Jaime Lannister had made good on his promise to expose Daenerys\u2019 and the Windblown\u2019s alleged drug trade. The dragon queen had taken a much-needed hit. There were more Lords and Ladies that could not justify supporting her. </i><i><br></i></p><p><i>Sansa responded with muffled sounds. Jon pressed her to tell him what had happened. She whispered all she had seen in the glass candle. Jon clutched his fist while he held her. The next morning the glass candle was gone. They left the Inn at the Crossroads for Harrenhal.</i></p><p><i>The large ancient castle had been burnt by dragon fire centuries before. Even though it had been restored, the towers still looked as if they were melting. Giant glass candles, Sansa thought. They were given a large suite of rooms in the East Tower that now acted as a hotel of sorts. She didn\u2019t see any more visions but her nightmares returned with a vengeance. The Great Council would be held in less than a week in Harrenhal\u2019s Great Keep. Every morning Jon held her when she woke in fear. His eyes would grow dark and he would make love to her. He said to comfort her. They both knew he liked it when she was vulnerable. She liked it when he was on top of her and whispered in her ear that he promised to kill their enemies. </i></p><p>*****<br><b></b></p><p><b><b>Jon</b></b></p><p>The woman that used to be his sister entered the room Jon was using as an office at the top of the east tower of Harrenhal unannounced. A fierceness showing on her face that mirrored his own. Arya would never not be Jon\u2019s sister just as Sansa was never his sister in any real way. At least that\u2019s how he preferred to think about it. Watching Arya, Jon decided if he didn\u2019t know she was carrying a child, he would never think it. She bounded around the room with more energy than a she-wolf. <br></p><p>\u201cLet me kill him,\u201d she demanded, standing in front of the desk. Jon didn\u2019t look up from the laptop he was working on. \u00a0The Great Council at Harrenhal would begin in two days, there was still much to do.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said hoping Arya would leave him in peace. Instead, she plopped herself down in a chair on her side of the desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent Theon to bring him to us,\u201d Jon told her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you trust him?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe should do this ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cTheon owes us. Owes Sansa\u2026\u201d Jon prayed he had made the correct decision. Allowing Theon to go retrieve Tyrion Lannister from Dragonstone was a risk. He had not been loyal to their brother Robb in the past. \u00a0Sansa assured Jon that Theon had changed. So, Jon sent him to do their dirty work. He didn\u2019t like it but he was not about to let Arya think he was unsure of his own decision.</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about this?\u201d Jon asked, pushing his laptop across the desk towards Arya. The headline of an article reported a major power outage on Dragonstone. Shrugging, Arya barely looked at the headline. Jon took that as a yes. Pulling his laptop back towards him, \u201cThere are people on Dragonstone. People who we want to lead,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThe attack was isolated. Just hit the castle. You know\u2026slow them down a bit. Freeze a few bank accounts\u2026,\u201d she said looking toward the window. Jon eyed her. She was wearing a loose grey t-shirt hanging over black leggings. High-top all-star converse sneakers tapping against the floor.</p><p>\u201chmm\u2026\u201d Jon said. Between Jaime Lannister leaking documents from an on-going investigation about possible drug trafficking by the dragon queen and Arya with the help of her new husband Ned Dayne, encouraging all manner of hacking, they were taking too many risks for Jon\u2019s taste. <i>And there would be more to come. </i>\u201cCareful Arya\u2026if they find out it was us\u2026\u201d he started to add.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t us,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t need to know any more,\u201d he said. He rubbed his temples before standing up to walk around the desk. \u201cEveryone is watching us. The election is in two days.\u201d Arya was quiet. Jon let her think things over for a few moments. <br></p><p>\u201cHow is Sansa?\u201d he asked. The dream she had had the night before left her upset. Jon hadn\u2019t wanted to leave her that morning. He had no choice. There was a long list of lords and ladies to meet, make promises too. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026.she\u2019ll be fine. You worry too much\u2026\u201d Arya said twirling the pen between her fingers.</p><p>Jon shook his head, \u201cNeither of you should be here. Everything she\u2019s been through. And your\u2026your\u2026condition,\u201d he said pointing to Arya\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cOh seven hells Jon, I\u2019m pregnant, not invalid,\u201d Arya said throwing the pen at his head. Jon ducked. Wanting to tell Arya that he was King in the North and could very well be the next King of the entire realm, he started to open his mouth.</p><p>There was a cell phone beep before he could continue to reprimand her. \u00a0Both Jon and Arya reached for their pockets. Jon looked at his not seeing an alert.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been spotted on the other side of the lake,\u201d she said after reading the message she received.</p><p>Jon glared at her, \u201cHow\u2026\u201d he started to ask before changing track. It didn\u2019t matter how she knew. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t want you involved.\u201d</p><p>Arya ignored him texting a response to whoever, most likely someone from the Brotherhood, had messaged her. A response alert came almost immediately. \u201cLooks like they\u2019re headed to the Isle of Faces,\u201d she after reading the message.</p><p><i>I bloody well know where they\u2019re going,</i> Jon thought. He clutched his fist.</p><p>\u201cYou were going there tonight and not going to tell us,\u201d she accused him. Jon didn\u2019t answer. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d she said. With that Arya jumped up and sauntered out of the room, the door slamming behind her.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Jon cursed staring at the door.</p><p>There was no doubt in his mind that Arya was headed straight for her sister\u2019s rooms. They would both insist on confronting Tyrion Lannister. Sansa would insist on more. Sitting back down at his desk, he rubbed his hands together. Toying with the idea of locking Sansa and Arya in the tower for the night. That was impossible. He was trying to bring justice down on the man who had helped Sansa\u2019s tormentors. A man who had actively helped Cersei Lannister imprison Sansa in a rehab center for months. Sansa would get her freedom. She would get the chance to confront him. She would get her kill if it was the last thing Jon did. He knew where ever Sansa went Arya was sure to follow. The whole thing made his head hurt more.</p><p>Night fell sooner than Jon would\u2019ve liked. He received confirmation from Theon that he and his men arrived on Isle of Faces with the \u2018cargo\u2019. Now, he stood on the shores of the God\u2019s Eye with Sansa and Arya on either side. They could see the Isle of Faces in the middle of the lake in the distance. The moon was full, it\u2019s reflection rippling across the dark water. Stars twinkling in the sky. The half-melted towers and keeps of the great castle of Harrenhal glowing dimly behind them.</p><p>Despite his conviction that Sansa get her kill, Jon had still tried to dissuade the women from joining him on this mission. It was too dangerous, he argued. There was a lot of talk about them being a pack of wolves from both in response. Jon relented if only to make them stop talking like their dead father. The man that used to be his father. The man the Lannister\u2019s killed so many years ago. The man that told his children that the 'pack survives\u2019 everytime they fought amongst themselves. <i>Damnit if Ned Stark wasn\u2019t haunting him from the grave.</i></p><p>They rowed across the lake to the isle in silence. If Sansa and Arya insisted on coming Jon had at least ensured they were not seen. \u00a0Giving everyone not directly on their payroll the night off. Coming up with believable alibies for both in the form of private spa treatments. A record of the reservations and payments for appointments they would never keep. The boat rocked in the water. There was a gentle breeze that blew the wisps of Sansa\u2019s hair that escaped the dark grey hoody she wore. They all wore dark hoodies and dark jeans and dark sneakers. Backpacks with minimal supplies were in the bottom of the boat. He knew Arya and himself both carried guns and blades. Sansa had a flashlight and water. She had even brought a small first aid kit. Jon laughed at that. He hated taking them here. <i>Wolves kill together</i>, Arya had told him earlier. He tried to explain that he was also a dragon and could handle this on his own. Sansa insisted he could not. The boat bumped along the shore, he hopped out to drag it closer. Holding out a hand he helped Sansa and then Arya out and on to the shore. <br></p><p>Walking on a narrow path that led from the shore of the island to the center. Every tree they passed had a face carved on it. Every so often Jon saw Sansa shine her flashlight on one of the trees. Faces old with mouths open, bloody sap pouring from their eyes. The stuff of children\u2019s nightmares. Sansa stared back at them. Challenging the faces to scare her. She even reached out to touch one or two. Jon tried not to look. As if they could see into the corners of his soul where no light had ever gone. Jon shivered.</p><p>The path wound uphill through the groves of trees, a few oaks and elms between the weirwoods. Arya led the way without a light. More cat than wolf he thought. Jon watched from behind keeping Sansa between them. There was the light of a campfire in the distance and the sound of voices. \u00a0They soon came upon a clearing with dozens of ancient weirwoods circling it.</p><p>In the clearing, there was an RV camper, Jon could see Theon sitting on a lawn chair a shotgun across his lap with two men from what was called the Sacred Order of the Green Men. The men that lived on the island in the middle of this massive lake. People said they practiced the dark arts. By the looks of them, Jon didn\u2019t doubt it. A campfire was blazing, there was a cooler between one of the men and Theon. All three had beers in their hands. By the looks of bottles tossed about, these were not their first beers of the night.</p><p>'Took you long enough Starks,\u201c Theon said a glint in his eyes and a smirk on his face.</p><p>'Where?\u201d Jon said.</p><p>\u201cThis is a weird place,\u201d Theon said looking into the darkness around them. \u201cI like it.\u201d Jon focused his eyes. Arya prowled the perimeter. He could see a few other men in the shadows of the clearing. Not green men. Men from the Iron Isles, Theon\u2019s Ironborn crew. They were grumbling in disagreement. It was too far from the sea for them. Jon shook his head. The last thing they needed was more Ironborn in the area this close to the Great Council.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, meet the King in the North and his sisters or is it, cousins?\u201d Theon laughed. <br>Jon sighed. Arya stopped moving and rolled her eyes. Theon got up and walked towards the RV with a slight wobble. The shotgun in one hand. \u201cAre you fucking both of them yet?\u201d<br><br>\u201cShut up Theon,\u201d Arya said. \u201cYou know I\u2019m married.\u201d</p><p>'Right..\u201c Theon laughed again. \"Things could change in a few days\u2026a wolf like you with that pretty boy Ned Dayne\u2026\u201d Arya growled while she moved back to Jon and Sansa\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cI asked 'Where is he\u2019,\u201d Jon said again taking a step towards the Greyjoy. Theon motioned for them to follow him into the RV.</p><p>Jon followed him inside. Theon popped his head out to call for Arya and Sansa, \u201cUnless you ladies want to stay out here. I\u2019m sure my boys would love to entertain ya.\u201d That was all that needed to be said for Sansa and Arya to hurry into the RV. Arya giving one last scowl to some of the Ironborn men.</p><p>Once in the RV, Theon leaned his shotgun against a wall by the door. They sat at the small pop-out table. Jon and Sansa on one side. Theon and a Green man next to him on the other side. Arya leaned against the door with her arms folded. Jon and his former sisters had pulled down the hoods of their dark grey hoodies. The odd Green man remained silent. Perhaps, he was there as assurance. Whatever was agreed upon would be upheld. <br><br>The discussion went as Jon expected. Theon wanted certain concessions for having helped him out. Jon reminded Theon of how much trouble he and the Ironborn had caused the Starks by raiding their lands for centuries. Theon thought they were passed all that. <br><br>\u201cHow about investment?\u201d Sansa said. Jon turned to face her in surprise. She had not spoken since they left the shore of the God\u2019s Eye for the island. Theon smiled and shook his finger at her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I always liked you, princess,\u201d he said. \u201cYou understand what a man wants. Shame you\u2019re with this one.\u201d Theon laughed as he motioned to Jon. Sansa pursed her lips.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Jon growled. <br>\u201cAlright\u2026alright..you Starks always too serious. My sister\u2026you know my sister Asha\u2026she\u2019s one tough cunt\u2026,\u201d Jon nodded trying to get Theon to get on with it. \u201cWell, she wants a promise of investment in our shipping business and some energy enterprise she likes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Sansa asked before Jon could respond.</p><p>\u201cOh 5 million dragons, 10\u2026\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201c4 million dragons for the shipping and 1 million for the energy,\u201d she said. The Green man seemed to not notice the negotiations. Nor did Arya for that matter. Both were engaged in a staring contest with each other.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Theon questioned. \u201cThought you had all that money you 'inherited\u2019 from Petyr Baelish.\u201d Theon used air quotes around inherited. Jon\u2019s attention turned back to the discussion at hand. Sansa cringed. Before Cersei had her kidnapped, Sansa had Petyr Baelish put on trial for his crimes against the Starks. All his money became her money when he was sentenced to death and killed. Jon narrowed his eyes at Theon, clutching and unclutching his trigger hand. The thought that any of the money would go to the Greyjoys made him beyond frustrated.</p><p>\u201cFine, 2 million for the energy enterprise. We get stock in both businesses,\u201d She turned her head to her sister. \u201cAnd Arya is on the boards of both companies.\u201d Theon dumbfounded looked to Arya who was now fumbling with the pocket of her hoody pretending to re-organize the contents. She pulled out the small gun she was carrying just enough for Theon to see it. He seemed to stumble with his words.<br>Jon leaned in, \u201cWhat do you say,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is very lucrative considering..\u201d</p><p>A smirk returned to Theon\u2019s face he turned to Sansa holding out his hand, \u201cI like a woman who can make a deal. My sister will be in touch. She likes you Starks.\u201d Sansa took his hand and shook on it. Arya moved closer to her sister. Theon rose, \u201cShall we,\u201d he said as he made a gallant gesture for the door of the RV before picking up his shotgun and walking out.</p><p>Back outside, the campfire was still roaring. Some of the Ironborn men were tossing empty beer cans into the flames. There was a blue-greenish light radiating from the flames. Jon wondered if it was a trick of the other Green man who was hanging around the periphery.</p><p>\u201cBring the imp,\u201d Theon shouted. \u201cTime for some fun.\u201d He slapped his thigh with his empty hand.</p><p>There were sounds from the bushes. Two more Ironborn appeared dragging a small figure between them. Jon heard Sansa gasped next to him. Arya pulled out her gun. Sansa stepped forward first. She stood in front of the imp, towering over him. She was even taller than one of the Ironborn men that held him. The firelight played with her hair, glints of copper even in this darkness. The shadows highlighting her fine cheekbones. <br></p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Tyrion Lannister stuttered in a raspy voice. He was beaten and bloody. She stared down at him. \u00a0\"I can\u2026I can explain\u2026\u201c</p><p>She laughed and kneeled to face him. \"Can you? Did you think Daenerys would love you, if you helped her?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\"When Jon didn\u2019t come to her after I was gone. She would cry on your shoulder and you would comfort her. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t that at all\u2026maybe it\u2019s me you wanted\u2026wait I don\u2019t think I care.\u201c</p><p>Tyrion became desperate. \"Sansa I even moved Cersei\u2019s body for you\u2026to make sure she was dead,\u201d he said. \u201cI can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh to make sure our people couldn\u2019t take care of it.\u201d she shook her head. \u201cTo increase our chances of getting caught. Or you just wanted to make sure your own sister was really dead.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion looked at her and then beyond her to Jon and Arya, the flames from the campfire flicking. Arya was admiring her gun for all to see, \u201cSansa you\u2019re not a killer,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Let him loose,\u201d she said standing. The Iron born loosened their grip on him. Tyrion stared back at her with a moment of relief. \u201cThey said you were a giant among men,\u201d Sansa said as took a step forward. \u201cRun,\u201d she said. Tyrion was wide-eyed with fear.</p><p>The bile rose in Jon\u2019s stomach urging him to pounce. Arya\u2019s hand reached for his arm.</p><p>'This is hers,\u201c she told him. The imp turned and started running into the woods. Sansa held her hand out to Theon, who place the shotgun in it. She waiting for a few moments before aiming into the darkness. One shot rang out, then another. There was a loud moaning. They could hear the imp stumble. Sansa walked into the forest following the path Tyrion had run. Jon was right behind her. He turned to see Arya holding herself back, keeping an eye on the Ironborn.</p><p>When he reached Sansa, there were tears streaming down her face. Tyrion was moaning on the ground. He had run further than Jon expected. Sansa stood over him with the shotgun ready to fire. She was telling Tyrion this was his trial. This was his payment for the wrongs he had done. Jon reached for her arm whispering, \"You don\u2019t have, too.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYes I do,\u201d she said. One last shot rang out. Blood splattered all over both of them. Tyrion was silent. Sansa lowered the shotgun. She fell to her knees her hands grasping at the dirty forest floor. Jon fell to his knees beside her.</p><p>There was an odd shifting of the ground. Jon swore that Tyrion\u2019s body started to sink into the soft dirt. There was a padding of feet approaching them. Low voices chanting words he couldn\u2019t understand. Sansa started breathing heavily. Jon took the shotgun from her and put his arms around her patting her hair. The two Green men appeared holding torches with an eery green glow.</p><p>\u201cTake her,\u201d the one man said to Jon pointing back towards the direction of the shore. He helped them stand.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do with the body,\u201d Jon asked loosening his grip on Sansa. The man who Jon now noticed looked far more ancient than before, patted his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old gods bless the king who remembers to make a sacrifice.\u201d Sansa nodded seeming to understand. Jon shielded her as the walked back to the clearing to find Arya. He glanced back to see that Tyrion\u2019s body had sunk even deeper into the ground.</p><p>Arya was eyeing the Ironborn with another unhappy face when they reached the campfire. Jon tossed the gun to Theon. \u201cClean this shit up. You\u2019ll get your investments. Word of this gets out and I\u2019ll geld everyone here,\u201d he said barely stopping his stride. \u00a0</p><p>Theon laughed again, \u201cNot the first man to threaten that Snow,\u201d he yelled.</p><p>Jon kept walking, his arm around Sansa who had pulled her hoody back up to hide her tear and blood-streaked face. Arya followed them holding a middle finger up to Theon as she went. \u201cFuckin\u2019 wolves,\u201d Theon murmured kicking a can.</p><p>Jon got them to the boat as quickly as he could. Sansa stared straight ahead as Arya rowed back to the shore near Harrenhal. Her hands kneading together, her long auburn waves sticking out of the hood and blowing in the wind. It was still cold at night even this far south. It wasn\u2019t until they reached their suite in the old tower that Jon looked down at his bloody hands then looked at both of them. Blood speckled on their hands and faces. Smears on her cheeks where Jon had tried to wipe away her tears. Dirt in his nails, had he pushed Tyrion into the ground? Jon couldn\u2019t even remember.<br></p><p>He mumbled something about washing to Sansa and moved toward the bathroom. She grabbed his arm to stop him. <i>Oh Sansa, you do not want this. </i>Pulling just a little, so that he would turn toward her. He started to shake his head but her lips found his. His dirty bloody hands moved to her neck then her cheeks. Kissing her as hard as he could, \u201cYou don\u2019t want this,\u201d he said. She kept kissing him. Pulling at their clothes until both their hoodies were off then the t-shirts underneath. Sansa had not said one word since they left the island.</p><p>Pushing her on to the bed. The full weight on his body pressing down on her. His bare chest touching hers. She had not been wearing a bra he realized. Jon never knew Sansa to forgo a bra. \u00a0Deciding he liked it, he grasped her wrists to lift them above her head. Sucking on one nipple and then the other until they were firm. Pushing his hips down harder, forcing her legs apart. He used one hand to hold her wrists together above her head, while the other fumbled with the button on her jeans.</p><p>\u201cFuck Sansa,\u201d he said before biting her neck. He wouldn\u2019t be able to get her pants off with one hand. Releasing her wrists, he lifted himself off the bed in frustration. His dick was throbbing. \u201cGet up,\u201d he commanded. Sansa did as he said. <i>Gods there was bloody smudges all over them. </i>Then he told her to take off her pants and she did that too. Staring at her naked body for a moment. In one swift motion, he turned her around. Forcing her shoulders forward, he guided her onto the bed telling her to get on all fours. She did that too. Jon undid the button on his pants then the zipper. Pulling his hard dick out, he stroked himself while his fingers found her warm wet cunt. He laughed, she was already wet.</p><p>Thrusting into her, she grasped. The first sound she had made. Jon could tell she was trying to stifle her moans. <i>That would not do.</i> He took her hard and fast. Telling her to say his name. She did that too. Everything he asked she did. She even reached her climax when he demanded it while he rubbed her swollen clit and thrust into her. Pulling away from her, he spilled his seed on her back. \u00a0His breath heavy, he put his hands on the bed on either side of her leaning down. Sansa sunk lower onto the bed, curling onto her side. She turned her head and their eyes met. Jon held her gaze, drowning in her blue eyes. With a heave, he stood up to go to the bathroom to get a towel. They were both covered in dirt and blood and now his seed. When he returned he cleaned her back then pulled the covers over her. She fell asleep curled into a ball. Jon laid next to her staring up at the ceiling. They had killed together. \u00a0<i>No, we made a sacrifice. A gift to the Old Gods. \u00a0</i></p><p>He woke that morning to the sound of the shower running and a soft voice singing. The sheets were clean, their bloody clothes were gone. Jon hoped for a moment that it was all a dream. Then he heard Brienne and Satin\u2019s voices in the other room of their suite. One was asking the other if everything was burnt. Jon groaned reaching for his mobile phone that someone had put on the nightstand next to the bed. The date said it was the first day of the fifth month. Jon wondered if there was still snow in the far north.</p>",

Sansa and Arya won&rsquo;t let him do it alone.<br /><br />This was written for the <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbh8pdnFooJjyjtvjQnE1Eg\">@jonsa-creatives</a> Dark Jon Snow Weekend. You can read it below or on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15295887\">AO3.</a><br /><br /><i>The terror, of falling down into the darkness washed over Sansa then it was gone. Nothingness surrounded her. The visions would appear.</i><i>Sansa watched the candles again on the second night. Jon was not with her. The sound of waves filled the room. Rough northern waves.</i> <i>She was at the beach house again. Her mouth started to form a smile. She scanned the beach for Jon or Ghost. Her smile faded when she saw a group a young teens in the distance.</i><br /></p><p><i>Then it was the girl and boy, it was not a girl, it was her. That was when Jon was still almost a head taller than her. &nbsp;She remembered that day. He had followed her down the beach around a bend. It was warm, the end of summer. She was in a tiny yellow bikini top and little denim shorts. Jon only wore his a pair of basketball shorts. Hair not even growing on his face. He was saying something. Telling her not to go so far. She just laughed. He grumbled telling her that their parents had left him and Robb in charge at the beach house. &ldquo;What do you think I&rsquo;m gonna do, Jon Snow?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;</i><br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Gods, I don&rsquo;t know. Just don&rsquo;t go so far. It&rsquo;s bad enough trying to watch Arya,&rdquo; he said running a hand through his dark wavy hair. Sansa remembered admiring his strong muscled chest that day. <br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&hellip;&rdquo; she said.<br />&ldquo;Then just come back, ok,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The tide might come in&hellip;then your stuck on some rocks&hellip;I don&rsquo;t understand&hellip;what are you doing over here&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The young Sansa twirled her hair and cocked her head to one side, &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m meeting a secret lover,&rdquo; she told him. Jon grew even more frustrated. <br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Where? Where is he,&rdquo; Jon asked. The younger Sansa couldn&rsquo;t help her self and laughed out loud. She stepped to Jon placing a hand on his chest.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. I was just going for a walk,&rdquo; she said. </i></p><p><i>Jon grabbed her wrist, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being silly. I&rsquo;m watching over you.&rdquo; Sansa watched the younger versions of herself and Jon stare into each other&rsquo;s eyes. A wave crashed against the large rock they were standing on. Younger Sansa fell towards Jon. There lips meeting. His arms wrapping around her. They kissed for longer than Sansa remembered. Their tongues searching each other&rsquo;s mouths. Jon&rsquo;s hands grasping her waist pulling her closer. Then there were voices in the distance. Arya was calling for them. They both broke apart. Younger Sansa pushed past Jon climbing over the boulders towards her sister&rsquo;s voice. </i></p><p><i>As the image faded, Sansa saw how troubled the younger Jon looked. They never spoke of that moment. So many terrible things happened after. Sansa had forgotten they shared a kiss so many years before. </i></p><p><i>Another vision came in it&rsquo;s place, Jon grew older, the surroundings darker. There was a car and Jon was outside, his hands wrapped around the neck of a woman, Cersei. The Hound was there making sure her guards were dead. Arya again called to Jon who rose to leave. She could see herself in the backseat of the car half-awake/half-drugged. Not long after the car sped away with Jon, Arya, the Hound, and Sansa inside a black van appeared. Tyrion Lannister jumped out with a bodyguard Sansa did not recognize. They looked around at the bodies. He pointed to Cersei&rsquo;s and instructed the man to move it and make sure she was dead. He laughed telling the man, he made sure she was drunk enough by the end of their meeting that when she confronted the Starks it would be an easy kill. Sansa still could hear his laugh as the image faded. More came faster and quicker not all she understood. Men from Essos delivery large crates of something on dark beaches. Tyrion visiting her at the rehab center. Asking if she wanted to be his wife, mocking her in her drugged state. The silver-haired dragon queen yelling at Tyrion, then at Jon, then at a series of men Sansa did not know. All the voices began to shout together. Light and shadows flashing. It took everything in her to toss the heavy blanket back over the candle. She had seen enough. </i></p><p><i>When Jon found her, she was huddled in the bed they had been sharing at the Inn at the Crossroads with a dazed expression. &nbsp;He tried to tell her that Jaime Lannister had made good on his promise to expose Daenerys&rsquo; and the Windblown&rsquo;s alleged drug trade. The dragon queen had taken a much-needed hit. There were more Lords and Ladies that could not justify supporting her. </i><i><br /></i></p><p><i>Sansa responded with muffled sounds. Jon pressed her to tell him what had happened. She whispered all she had seen in the glass candle. Jon clutched his fist while he held her. The next morning the glass candle was gone. They left the Inn at the Crossroads for Harrenhal.</i></p><p><i>The large ancient castle had been burnt by dragon fire centuries before. Even though it had been restored, the towers still looked as if they were melting. Giant glass candles, Sansa thought. They were given a large suite of rooms in the East Tower that now acted as a hotel of sorts. She didn&rsquo;t see any more visions but her nightmares returned with a vengeance. The Great Council would be held in less than a week in Harrenhal&rsquo;s Great Keep. Every morning Jon held her when she woke in fear. His eyes would grow dark and he would make love to her. He said to comfort her. They both knew he liked it when she was vulnerable. She liked it when he was on top of her and whispered in her ear that he promised to kill their enemies. </i></p><p>*****<br /><b></b></p><p><b><b>Jon</b></b></p><p>The woman that used to be his sister entered the room Jon was using as an office at the top of the east tower of Harrenhal unannounced. A fierceness showing on her face that mirrored his own. Arya would never not be Jon&rsquo;s sister just as Sansa was never his sister in any real way. At least that&rsquo;s how he preferred to think about it. Watching Arya, Jon decided if he didn&rsquo;t know she was carrying a child, he would never think it. She bounded around the room with more energy than a she-wolf. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Let me kill him,&rdquo; she demanded, standing in front of the desk. Jon didn&rsquo;t look up from the laptop he was working on. &nbsp;The Great Council at Harrenhal would begin in two days, there was still much to do.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said hoping Arya would leave him in peace. Instead, she plopped herself down in a chair on her side of the desk.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent Theon to bring him to us,&rdquo; Jon told her.</p><p>&ldquo;And you trust him?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;We should do this ourselves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Theon owes us. Owes Sansa&hellip;&rdquo; Jon prayed he had made the correct decision. Allowing Theon to go retrieve Tyrion Lannister from Dragonstone was a risk. He had not been loyal to their brother Robb in the past. &nbsp;Sansa assured Jon that Theon had changed. So, Jon sent him to do their dirty work. He didn&rsquo;t like it but he was not about to let Arya think he was unsure of his own decision.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about this?&rdquo; Jon asked, pushing his laptop across the desk towards Arya. The headline of an article reported a major power outage on Dragonstone. Shrugging, Arya barely looked at the headline. Jon took that as a yes. Pulling his laptop back towards him, &ldquo;There are people on Dragonstone. People who we want to lead,&rdquo; he reminded her.</p><p>&ldquo;The attack was isolated. Just hit the castle. You know&hellip;slow them down a bit. Freeze a few bank accounts&hellip;,&rdquo; she said looking toward the window. Jon eyed her. She was wearing a loose grey t-shirt hanging over black leggings. High-top all-star converse sneakers tapping against the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;hmm&hellip;&rdquo; Jon said. Between Jaime Lannister leaking documents from an on-going investigation about possible drug trafficking by the dragon queen and Arya with the help of her new husband Ned Dayne, encouraging all manner of hacking, they were taking too many risks for Jon&rsquo;s taste. <i>And there would be more to come. </i>&ldquo;Careful Arya&hellip;if they find out it was us&hellip;&rdquo; he started to add.</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&hellip;I don&rsquo;t need to know any more,&rdquo; he said. He rubbed his temples before standing up to walk around the desk. &ldquo;Everyone is watching us. The election is in two days.&rdquo; Arya was quiet. Jon let her think things over for a few moments. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;How is Sansa?&rdquo; he asked. The dream she had had the night before left her upset. Jon hadn&rsquo;t wanted to leave her that morning. He had no choice. There was a long list of lords and ladies to meet, make promises too. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&hellip;.she&rsquo;ll be fine. You worry too much&hellip;&rdquo; Arya said twirling the pen between her fingers.</p><p>Jon shook his head, &ldquo;Neither of you should be here. Everything she&rsquo;s been through. And your&hellip;your&hellip;condition,&rdquo; he said pointing to Arya&rsquo;s stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh seven hells Jon, I&rsquo;m pregnant, not invalid,&rdquo; Arya said throwing the pen at his head. Jon ducked. Wanting to tell Arya that he was King in the North and could very well be the next King of the entire realm, he started to open his mouth.</p><p>There was a cell phone beep before he could continue to reprimand her. &nbsp;Both Jon and Arya reached for their pockets. Jon looked at his not seeing an alert.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been spotted on the other side of the lake,&rdquo; she said after reading the message she received.</p><p>Jon glared at her, &ldquo;How&hellip;&rdquo; he started to ask before changing track. It didn&rsquo;t matter how she knew. &ldquo;I told you, I don&rsquo;t want you involved.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya ignored him texting a response to whoever, most likely someone from the Brotherhood, had messaged her. A response alert came almost immediately. &ldquo;Looks like they&rsquo;re headed to the Isle of Faces,&rdquo; she after reading the message.</p><p><i>I bloody well know where they&rsquo;re going,</i> Jon thought. He clutched his fist.</p><p>&ldquo;You were going there tonight and not going to tell us,&rdquo; she accused him. Jon didn&rsquo;t answer. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not going to happen,&rdquo; she said. With that Arya jumped up and sauntered out of the room, the door slamming behind her.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; Jon cursed staring at the door.</p><p>There was no doubt in his mind that Arya was headed straight for her sister&rsquo;s rooms. They would both insist on confronting Tyrion Lannister. Sansa would insist on more. Sitting back down at his desk, he rubbed his hands together. Toying with the idea of locking Sansa and Arya in the tower for the night. That was impossible. He was trying to bring justice down on the man who had helped Sansa&rsquo;s tormentors. A man who had actively helped Cersei Lannister imprison Sansa in a rehab center for months. Sansa would get her freedom. She would get the chance to confront him. She would get her kill if it was the last thing Jon did. He knew where ever Sansa went Arya was sure to follow. The whole thing made his head hurt more.</p><p>Night fell sooner than Jon would&rsquo;ve liked. He received confirmation from Theon that he and his men arrived on Isle of Faces with the &lsquo;cargo&rsquo;. Now, he stood on the shores of the God&rsquo;s Eye with Sansa and Arya on either side. They could see the Isle of Faces in the middle of the lake in the distance. The moon was full, it&rsquo;s reflection rippling across the dark water. Stars twinkling in the sky. The half-melted towers and keeps of the great castle of Harrenhal glowing dimly behind them.</p><p>Despite his conviction that Sansa get her kill, Jon had still tried to dissuade the women from joining him on this mission. It was too dangerous, he argued. There was a lot of talk about them being a pack of wolves from both in response. Jon relented if only to make them stop talking like their dead father. The man that used to be his father. The man the Lannister&rsquo;s killed so many years ago. The man that told his children that the 'pack survives&rsquo; everytime they fought amongst themselves. <i>Damnit if Ned Stark wasn&rsquo;t haunting him from the grave.</i></p><p>They rowed across the lake to the isle in silence. If Sansa and Arya insisted on coming Jon had at least ensured they were not seen. &nbsp;Giving everyone not directly on their payroll the night off. Coming up with believable alibies for both in the form of private spa treatments. A record of the reservations and payments for appointments they would never keep. The boat rocked in the water. There was a gentle breeze that blew the wisps of Sansa&rsquo;s hair that escaped the dark grey hoody she wore. They all wore dark hoodies and dark jeans and dark sneakers. Backpacks with minimal supplies were in the bottom of the boat. He knew Arya and himself both carried guns and blades. Sansa had a flashlight and water. She had even brought a small first aid kit. Jon laughed at that. He hated taking them here. <i>Wolves kill together</i>, Arya had told him earlier. He tried to explain that he was also a dragon and could handle this on his own. Sansa insisted he could not. The boat bumped along the shore, he hopped out to drag it closer. Holding out a hand he helped Sansa and then Arya out and on to the shore. <br /></p><p>Walking on a narrow path that led from the shore of the island to the center. Every tree they passed had a face carved on it. Every so often Jon saw Sansa shine her flashlight on one of the trees. Faces old with mouths open, bloody sap pouring from their eyes. The stuff of children&rsquo;s nightmares. Sansa stared back at them. Challenging the faces to scare her. She even reached out to touch one or two. Jon tried not to look. As if they could see into the corners of his soul where no light had ever gone. Jon shivered.</p><p>The path wound uphill through the groves of trees, a few oaks and elms between the weirwoods. Arya led the way without a light. More cat than wolf he thought. Jon watched from behind keeping Sansa between them. There was the light of a campfire in the distance and the sound of voices. &nbsp;They soon came upon a clearing with dozens of ancient weirwoods circling it.</p><p>In the clearing, there was an RV camper, Jon could see Theon sitting on a lawn chair a shotgun across his lap with two men from what was called the Sacred Order of the Green Men. The men that lived on the island in the middle of this massive lake. People said they practiced the dark arts. By the looks of them, Jon didn&rsquo;t doubt it. A campfire was blazing, there was a cooler between one of the men and Theon. All three had beers in their hands. By the looks of bottles tossed about, these were not their first beers of the night.</p><p>'Took you long enough Starks,&ldquo; Theon said a glint in his eyes and a smirk on his face.</p><p>'Where?&rdquo; Jon said.</p><p>&ldquo;This is a weird place,&rdquo; Theon said looking into the darkness around them. &ldquo;I like it.&rdquo; Jon focused his eyes. Arya prowled the perimeter. He could see a few other men in the shadows of the clearing. Not green men. Men from the Iron Isles, Theon&rsquo;s Ironborn crew. They were grumbling in disagreement. It was too far from the sea for them. Jon shook his head. The last thing they needed was more Ironborn in the area this close to the Great Council.</p><p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, meet the King in the North and his sisters or is it, cousins?&rdquo; Theon laughed. <br />Jon sighed. Arya stopped moving and rolled her eyes. Theon got up and walked towards the RV with a slight wobble. The shotgun in one hand. &ldquo;Are you fucking both of them yet?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Shut up Theon,&rdquo; Arya said. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m married.&rdquo;</p><p>'Right..&ldquo; Theon laughed again. \"Things could change in a few days&hellip;a wolf like you with that pretty boy Ned Dayne&hellip;&rdquo; Arya growled while she moved back to Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s side.</p><p>&ldquo;I asked 'Where is he&rsquo;,&rdquo; Jon said again taking a step towards the Greyjoy. Theon motioned for them to follow him into the RV.</p><p>Jon followed him inside. Theon popped his head out to call for Arya and Sansa, &ldquo;Unless you ladies want to stay out here. I&rsquo;m sure my boys would love to entertain ya.&rdquo; That was all that needed to be said for Sansa and Arya to hurry into the RV. Arya giving one last scowl to some of the Ironborn men.</p><p>Once in the RV, Theon leaned his shotgun against a wall by the door. They sat at the small pop-out table. Jon and Sansa on one side. Theon and a Green man next to him on the other side. Arya leaned against the door with her arms folded. Jon and his former sisters had pulled down the hoods of their dark grey hoodies. The odd Green man remained silent. Perhaps, he was there as assurance. Whatever was agreed upon would be upheld. <br /><br />The discussion went as Jon expected. Theon wanted certain concessions for having helped him out. Jon reminded Theon of how much trouble he and the Ironborn had caused the Starks by raiding their lands for centuries. Theon thought they were passed all that. <br /><br />&ldquo;How about investment?&rdquo; Sansa said. Jon turned to face her in surprise. She had not spoken since they left the shore of the God&rsquo;s Eye for the island. Theon smiled and shook his finger at her.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I always liked you, princess,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You understand what a man wants. Shame you&rsquo;re with this one.&rdquo; Theon laughed as he motioned to Jon. Sansa pursed her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Careful,&rdquo; Jon growled. <br />&ldquo;Alright&hellip;alright..you Starks always too serious. My sister&hellip;you know my sister Asha&hellip;she&rsquo;s one tough cunt&hellip;,&rdquo; Jon nodded trying to get Theon to get on with it. &ldquo;Well, she wants a promise of investment in our shipping business and some energy enterprise she likes,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; Sansa asked before Jon could respond.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh 5 million dragons, 10&hellip;&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;4 million dragons for the shipping and 1 million for the energy,&rdquo; she said. The Green man seemed to not notice the negotiations. Nor did Arya for that matter. Both were engaged in a staring contest with each other.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo; Theon questioned. &ldquo;Thought you had all that money you 'inherited&rsquo; from Petyr Baelish.&rdquo; Theon used air quotes around inherited. Jon&rsquo;s attention turned back to the discussion at hand. Sansa cringed. Before Cersei had her kidnapped, Sansa had Petyr Baelish put on trial for his crimes against the Starks. All his money became her money when he was sentenced to death and killed. Jon narrowed his eyes at Theon, clutching and unclutching his trigger hand. The thought that any of the money would go to the Greyjoys made him beyond frustrated.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, 2 million for the energy enterprise. We get stock in both businesses,&rdquo; She turned her head to her sister. &ldquo;And Arya is on the boards of both companies.&rdquo; Theon dumbfounded looked to Arya who was now fumbling with the pocket of her hoody pretending to re-organize the contents. She pulled out the small gun she was carrying just enough for Theon to see it. He seemed to stumble with his words.<br />Jon leaned in, &ldquo;What do you say,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is very lucrative considering..&rdquo;</p><p>A smirk returned to Theon&rsquo;s face he turned to Sansa holding out his hand, &ldquo;I like a woman who can make a deal. My sister will be in touch. She likes you Starks.&rdquo; Sansa took his hand and shook on it. Arya moved closer to her sister. Theon rose, &ldquo;Shall we,&rdquo; he said as he made a gallant gesture for the door of the RV before picking up his shotgun and walking out.</p><p>Back outside, the campfire was still roaring. Some of the Ironborn men were tossing empty beer cans into the flames. There was a blue-greenish light radiating from the flames. Jon wondered if it was a trick of the other Green man who was hanging around the periphery.</p><p>&ldquo;Bring the imp,&rdquo; Theon shouted. &ldquo;Time for some fun.&rdquo; He slapped his thigh with his empty hand.</p><p>There were sounds from the bushes. Two more Ironborn appeared dragging a small figure between them. Jon heard Sansa gasped next to him. Arya pulled out her gun. Sansa stepped forward first. She stood in front of the imp, towering over him. She was even taller than one of the Ironborn men that held him. The firelight played with her hair, glints of copper even in this darkness. The shadows highlighting her fine cheekbones. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; Tyrion Lannister stuttered in a raspy voice. He was beaten and bloody. She stared down at him. &nbsp;\"I can&hellip;I can explain&hellip;&ldquo;</p><p>She laughed and kneeled to face him. \"Can you? Did you think Daenerys would love you, if you helped her?&rdquo; she asked. &nbsp;\"When Jon didn&rsquo;t come to her after I was gone. She would cry on your shoulder and you would comfort her. Or maybe it wasn&rsquo;t that at all&hellip;maybe it&rsquo;s me you wanted&hellip;wait I don&rsquo;t think I care.&ldquo;</p><p>Tyrion became desperate. \"Sansa I even moved Cersei&rsquo;s body for you&hellip;to make sure she was dead,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can help you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh to make sure our people couldn&rsquo;t take care of it.&rdquo; she shook her head. &ldquo;To increase our chances of getting caught. Or you just wanted to make sure your own sister was really dead.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion looked at her and then beyond her to Jon and Arya, the flames from the campfire flicking. Arya was admiring her gun for all to see, &ldquo;Sansa you&rsquo;re not a killer,&rdquo; he pleaded.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. Let him loose,&rdquo; she said standing. The Iron born loosened their grip on him. Tyrion stared back at her with a moment of relief. &ldquo;They said you were a giant among men,&rdquo; Sansa said as took a step forward. &ldquo;Run,&rdquo; she said. Tyrion was wide-eyed with fear.</p><p>The bile rose in Jon&rsquo;s stomach urging him to pounce. Arya&rsquo;s hand reached for his arm.</p><p>'This is hers,&ldquo; she told him. The imp turned and started running into the woods. Sansa held her hand out to Theon, who place the shotgun in it. She waiting for a few moments before aiming into the darkness. One shot rang out, then another. There was a loud moaning. They could hear the imp stumble. Sansa walked into the forest following the path Tyrion had run. Jon was right behind her. He turned to see Arya holding herself back, keeping an eye on the Ironborn.</p><p>When he reached Sansa, there were tears streaming down her face. Tyrion was moaning on the ground. He had run further than Jon expected. Sansa stood over him with the shotgun ready to fire. She was telling Tyrion this was his trial. This was his payment for the wrongs he had done. Jon reached for her arm whispering, \"You don&rsquo;t have, too.&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;Yes I do,&rdquo; she said. One last shot rang out. Blood splattered all over both of them. Tyrion was silent. Sansa lowered the shotgun. She fell to her knees her hands grasping at the dirty forest floor. Jon fell to his knees beside her.</p><p>There was an odd shifting of the ground. Jon swore that Tyrion&rsquo;s body started to sink into the soft dirt. There was a padding of feet approaching them. Low voices chanting words he couldn&rsquo;t understand. Sansa started breathing heavily. Jon took the shotgun from her and put his arms around her patting her hair. The two Green men appeared holding torches with an eery green glow.</p><p>&ldquo;Take her,&rdquo; the one man said to Jon pointing back towards the direction of the shore. He helped them stand.</p><p>&ldquo;What will you do with the body,&rdquo; Jon asked loosening his grip on Sansa. The man who Jon now noticed looked far more ancient than before, patted his arm.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The old gods bless the king who remembers to make a sacrifice.&rdquo; Sansa nodded seeming to understand. Jon shielded her as the walked back to the clearing to find Arya. He glanced back to see that Tyrion&rsquo;s body had sunk even deeper into the ground.</p><p>Arya was eyeing the Ironborn with another unhappy face when they reached the campfire. Jon tossed the gun to Theon. &ldquo;Clean this shit up. You&rsquo;ll get your investments. Word of this gets out and I&rsquo;ll geld everyone here,&rdquo; he said barely stopping his stride. &nbsp;</p><p>Theon laughed again, &ldquo;Not the first man to threaten that Snow,&rdquo; he yelled.</p><p>Jon kept walking, his arm around Sansa who had pulled her hoody back up to hide her tear and blood-streaked face. Arya followed them holding a middle finger up to Theon as she went. &ldquo;Fuckin&rsquo; wolves,&rdquo; Theon murmured kicking a can.</p><p>Jon got them to the boat as quickly as he could. Sansa stared straight ahead as Arya rowed back to the shore near Harrenhal. Her hands kneading together, her long auburn waves sticking out of the hood and blowing in the wind. It was still cold at night even this far south. It wasn&rsquo;t until they reached their suite in the old tower that Jon looked down at his bloody hands then looked at both of them. Blood speckled on their hands and faces. Smears on her cheeks where Jon had tried to wipe away her tears. Dirt in his nails, had he pushed Tyrion into the ground? Jon couldn&rsquo;t even remember.<br /></p><p>He mumbled something about washing to Sansa and moved toward the bathroom. She grabbed his arm to stop him. <i>Oh Sansa, you do not want this. </i>Pulling just a little, so that he would turn toward her. He started to shake his head but her lips found his. His dirty bloody hands moved to her neck then her cheeks. Kissing her as hard as he could, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want this,&rdquo; he said. She kept kissing him. Pulling at their clothes until both their hoodies were off then the t-shirts underneath. Sansa had not said one word since they left the island.</p><p>Pushing her on to the bed. The full weight on his body pressing down on her. His bare chest touching hers. She had not been wearing a bra he realized. Jon never knew Sansa to forgo a bra. &nbsp;Deciding he liked it, he grasped her wrists to lift them above her head. Sucking on one nipple and then the other until they were firm. Pushing his hips down harder, forcing her legs apart. He used one hand to hold her wrists together above her head, while the other fumbled with the button on her jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck Sansa,&rdquo; he said before biting her neck. He wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get her pants off with one hand. Releasing her wrists, he lifted himself off the bed in frustration. His dick was throbbing. &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; he commanded. Sansa did as he said. <i>Gods there was bloody smudges all over them. </i>Then he told her to take off her pants and she did that too. Staring at her naked body for a moment. In one swift motion, he turned her around. Forcing her shoulders forward, he guided her onto the bed telling her to get on all fours. She did that too. Jon undid the button on his pants then the zipper. Pulling his hard dick out, he stroked himself while his fingers found her warm wet cunt. He laughed, she was already wet.</p><p>Thrusting into her, she grasped. The first sound she had made. Jon could tell she was trying to stifle her moans. <i>That would not do.</i> He took her hard and fast. Telling her to say his name. She did that too. Everything he asked she did. She even reached her climax when he demanded it while he rubbed her swollen clit and thrust into her. Pulling away from her, he spilled his seed on her back. &nbsp;His breath heavy, he put his hands on the bed on either side of her leaning down. Sansa sunk lower onto the bed, curling onto her side. She turned her head and their eyes met. Jon held her gaze, drowning in her blue eyes. With a heave, he stood up to go to the bathroom to get a towel. They were both covered in dirt and blood and now his seed. When he returned he cleaned her back then pulled the covers over her. She fell asleep curled into a ball. Jon laid next to her staring up at the ceiling. They had killed together. &nbsp;<i>No, we made a sacrifice. A gift to the Old Gods. &nbsp;</i></p><p>He woke that morning to the sound of the shower running and a soft voice singing. The sheets were clean, their bloody clothes were gone. Jon hoped for a moment that it was all a dream. Then he heard Brienne and Satin&rsquo;s voices in the other room of their suite. One was asking the other if everything was burnt. Jon groaned reaching for his mobile phone that someone had put on the nightstand next to the bed. The date said it was the first day of the fifth month. Jon wondered if there was still snow in the far north.</p>",
