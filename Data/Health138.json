My sister surprised me with the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2CMmmiZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rose gold version</a> and I absolutely love it! I am surprised just how handy I\u2019m already finding it, especially since slipping the ring around my wrist frees up both of my hands which I need pretty much at all times when I\u2019m out and about with two kids in tow.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been sliding the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2CMmmiZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">key ring</a> around my wrist along with my favorite <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Tobspd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wristlet pouch</a> I use to carry the essentials (a couple of diapers, wipes, lip balm, healing ointment, a spare onesie) and it\u2019s perfect!

This blog primarily documents my journey as I attempt to lose over 100 lbs and develop a healthier lifestyle. I am not perfect; in fact, this blog is dedicated mostly to my physical, mental, and emotional struggles. I try to be as real as possible with all my struggles, specifically with being a healthier version of myself. Because of life, I am not the most active blog; however, I am trying to at least reblog or post something once a day and update about my life as often as possible. I hope you join this journey with me because its gonna be a long one!</p><p> Below are my current stats as of March 19, 2019:</p> <p>Age: 22</p> <p>Height: 5'7\"</p> <p>Starting Weight: 295.8lb</p> <p>Current Weight: 295.8lb</p> <p>Total Loss: +/-0.0lb</p>",

I got more black bean salsa and chips along with cheese and pineapple mustard. I&rsquo;m really hoping that keeps me full. This morning I was so tired and therefore couldn&rsquo;t come up with anything to eat so I packed what I could find. This weekend I plan on meal prepping all my meals and snacks for the whole week. So we shall see how that goes&hellip; I have no idea what&rsquo;s for dinner but hopefully it&rsquo;s somewhat healthy. </p>",

I have constant negative thoughts that I'm the worst there (even if I know that there are people with even worse grades) and that I'll not pass any class and they'll kick me out. Just thinking about it triggering my panic attacks. I'm especially worried about my math classes because I feel like prof. really hates me there and he threaten me that I might not pass his classes.
