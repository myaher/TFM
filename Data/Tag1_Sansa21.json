That&rsquo;s not new Brienne isn&rsquo;t exactly a social butterfly, more like a caterpillar never destined to leave her chrysalis. </p><p>She&rsquo;s not sure why no one wants to tell her what&rsquo;s going on, their reluctance to tell her makes her think that somehow it&rsquo;s about her but she can&rsquo;t think of a possible link between her and Jaime getting detention. </p><p>Worry knaws at her stomach, Jaime was a good student but he acted on impulse and easily got into trouble, they were close to graduating and Brienne worries about his record. </p><p>In the end she corners Sansa and demands answers (she stutters but it counts because Sansa spills) </p><p>Jaime had apparently hit Red Ronnett.</p><p>&ldquo;Why!?&rdquo; Brienne asks bewildered, Sansa eyes her warily.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Sansa asks dubiously , &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t think of a reason?&rdquo;</p><p>Brienne searches her memory, they&rsquo;d been set up on a blind date a million years ago and it hadn&rsquo;t gone well, she&rsquo;d been shy and even more self concious and he&rsquo;d taken one look at her and had&hellip;well he had been cruel. </p><p>But it was white noise, Brienne could mostly tune it out. Mostly. But that didn&rsquo;t explain why Jaime had hit him.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I mean, i know jaime has a short fuse but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about you,&rdquo; Sansa says, as if explaining something to a child. &ldquo;Ronnett said something about you and Jaime hit him&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is Jaime alright?&rdquo; Brienne asks urgently.</p><p>Sansa tilts her head, considering, &ldquo;a few bruised knuckles and a two day suspension&rdquo;</p><p>Brienne breathes a sigh of relief, now that she knows he is fine she can be angry at him. What was he doing playing chicken with his student record, she knew that the Lannister name protected Jaime from the bulk of his misdeeds but it always forced brienne&rsquo;s heart into her throat. </p><p>Something caught her attention, &ldquo;why would Jaime care if Ronnett said something about me?&rdquo; Brienne asks, &ldquo;he calls me ugly to my face?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa laughs, it&rsquo;s not a mean laugh, it&rsquo;s born of genuine surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you should ask Jaime,&rdquo; Sansa says still chuckling.</p><p>Brienne is left even more confused. </p></p>",
