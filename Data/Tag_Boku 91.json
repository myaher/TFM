He use to be very disagreeable with it, the fact that it looked like he was always blushing. Over time he had gotten used to it, he had to. But that doesn\u2019t at all mean that he can\u2019t grumble and complain about it.\u00a0</p><p>He had probably complained about every and anything about Antarctica at one point. The cold, the snow, the wind, their base, his coat, and the penguins. <i>God</i>, the penguins. Bakugou had come here for the science. That was it, science was all he really needed, nothing else mattered to him. He would stay in this cold hell for months just for the science and that&rsquo;s what he did but not he did not sign up for the penguins. Of course, he knew there was going to be some chance encounters. How could he <i>not</i> think that but he was entirely wrong on their behavior.</p><p>He had seen penguins before when he was younger. In the zoo exhibit, squawking and screaming as they plunge into the water, droplets of water splashing against the glass. Seeing their habitat, rocky and icy, snow around the corner, dents where they slid through was amazing. Though he was far more invested in the science in the ice.Kirishima was entirely different. He\u2019d smile bright as he waved his camera around hand tightly curled around it as not to drop it, despite it being secured with the strap, and explain for the fifth time that day how much he loved this job.He\u2019d say some sweet shit about animals, about his love for them and the surrounding nature but while Bakugou could admire his dedication, going so far from home into an isolated continent full of ice and with him of all people, he could not get over how much he loved penguins. He just didn\u2019t understand it.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just his insufferable hate for penguins but the fact that the penguins loved and practically fawned over Kirishima (which faintly surprised Bakugou when he first saw it, they\u2019d both thought that maybe the penguins would be scared of him, his shiny sharp teeth a possible threat but they weren\u2019t). Kirishima spent hours later screaming about how he felt so loved and accepted. They\u2019d see him taking his pictures and rush over, squawking and flapping their fins as the surged him. It would be adorable if Bakugou liked penguins, but all he saw was the small hell demons as they swarmed his friend (and no, he wasn\u2019t jealous).\u00a0</p><p><i>Disgusting.</i></p><!-- more --><p>Usually, they\u2019d leave him alone, they\u2019d stalk close, softy squawking and watch him and he\u2019d stare back. Staring with pure anger in his eyes. This would go on for at least an hour (he wouldn\u2019t be the one losing this contest), it happened enough, enough that Kirishima had a whole Instagram of the pictures; him in stare offs with those demons, them standing and staring (the others at the station loved to tease him about it). There was the occasional time he\u2019d befriend some, loners, they\u2019d come by, and softly rub against his knees, soft chirps and he\u2019d pet them, knuckle under their chin as they nuzzled into him. Kiri has far less pictures of that. But even with the vast majority of penguins, most preferred Kiri,and of course Bakugou had his favorites to but there was <i>one</i>. One penguin Bakugou despised with all his being.</p><p>Kiri has stuck to calling him Pep, Bakugou didn\u2019t know or care to as why but he hated that penguin with everything he had to offer.</p><p>He was a smaller fellow, constantly tripping over his feet as he waddled around. It started out soft and nice and fun. He favored Kiri at first, and stuck around the camp more than the others, wandering around curiously and chirping, he loved to watch Kiri take pictures or bite at the bolts in the equipment. But that wasn\u2019t why Bakugou hated him.</p><p>Bakugou, due to his quirk had to take some of his layers off when the wind had slowed and he was overwhelmed with the stuffy warmth and he usually found himself pulling his scarf off and setting it beside him, under his mug of coffee or book. It was a bad habit he had, he can admit that. They needed to say as warm as possible, as to not catch a cold or something worse but it was usually fine, no extreme backlash or punishment, just a gentle reminder from Kiri and everything would be fine.</p><p>But Pep had to mess that up.</p><p>He remembered the day it started up. He had set his scarf off to the side while he made some dinner for him and Kiri (the only good bean soup, Bakugou couldn&rsquo;t wait for real food when they finished in Antarctica), the heat from the pot boiled up at him, steam coating him face, one of the understandable times that Kiri would allow for him to take off some layers. He ignored the vast amount of texts from his friends, Kaminari and the others pleas for them to eat at the station. Kirishima just said he\u2019d need a few more pictures and they would be done. Bakugou could go with a few more samples anyway.\u00a0</p><p>He heard Pep\u2019s small chirps, approaching slowly, Bakugou has very stupidly ignored him, thinking he was looking for Kiri or just inspecting the equipment again. Oh, how he was so wrong. He only knew something happened when he heard the loud clatter of objects falling.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>He turned around just in time to see the small tower of his objects smash against the white floor, snow spraying everywhere. Bakugou had rushed to pick up the objects, carefully inspecting them, searching for any cracks or fractures. He heard the faint call from Kiri, somewhere of in the distant roll of the white hills, \u201cHey what happened? You okay?\u201dBakugou simply waved a hand back at him, \u201cThe equipm-\u201c</p><p><i>Squawk.</i></p><p>\u00a0Oh.</p><p>Everything had made sense at that point. He didn\u2019t even need to look up and see the small penguin fleeing the crime scene, Bakuou\u2019s scarf securely tucked in his beak.</p><p>That damned penguin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou motherfucker!\u201d</p><p>Usually, Bakugou was usually able to control his quirk, in favor of keeping the expensive gloves intact (and making sure he doesn\u2019t get frostbite and lose his finger) but with the anger that surged through him he couldn\u2019t help but let a few explosions leave his palms. He could hear the faint screams of shock from Kirishima.</p><p>\u201cGet back here, you fucking-\u201c</p><p>Kirishima had slid down the hill fast enough to see the start of the small battle. Bakugou letting out his loud disgruntled screams as he chased the small bird, stumbling over his feet and the scarf in between his beak. Pep had already made it quite a ways away from the scene, Bakugou already gaining speed.\u00a0</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop the laugh that left him as he quickly stuffed his hand into his pockets, fumbling with his phone. Oh, he just had to get this on camera.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStop running, you bitch!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Bakugou\u2019s palms lit up with small pops of explosions, his gloves beyond saving at this point. Pep simply squeaked happily and ran faster. Bakugou could hear Kirishima\u2019s laughter in the background.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny! You&rsquo;re enabling this bastard!\u201d\u00a0In the far distance Bakugou could see a small audience of penguins. Anger pulsed through him.\u00a0</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Bakugou to catch up to Pep, grabbing the edge of the scarf and pulling at it. Pep let out a loud squawk before falling backward and screaming up at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGive it back you flightless fuck.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Pep offended, pulls back and lets out a series of fierce honks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t yell at me, you thief!\u201d Bakugou yanks again, attempting to grab more of the scarf just to have his fingers bit at.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOw, you fucker! It&rsquo;s not yours!\u201d Bakugou only got angry squawks in response, he felt the small pops coming off his palms. Pep continued nipping and pulling back the scarf.</p><p>Bakugou growled back and wrapped his hands around Pep\u2019s small body. Pep squirmed, screaming and trying desperately to nip at Bakugou\u2019s fingers. Bakugou growled at him before pulling the scarf out of Pep\u2019s beak, who squawked sadly at the loss.\u00a0</p><p>Bakugou sloppily wrapped it back around his neck, half of it hanging halfway down his back before pointing sternly at the penguin (who was angrily glaring back).\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStop stealing my shit or I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d setting Pep back down and stomping back to the base. Pep let out another honk, nipped at Bakugou\u2019s feet and then fled back to the audience of penguins near Kirishima. Probably to gossip to his friends about angering the tall monster.\u00a0</p><p>Bakugou shoved his hands into his pockets and grumbled about the lack of respect and idiocy of the penguins before picking up the mess that Pep had made.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe sure does seem to like you.\u201d He could hear the smile in Kirishima\u2019s voice. Bakugou simply growled, waving a hand at him, signaling him to leave.</p><p>Kirishima chuckled then dropped down to help pick up the items on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he likes me, I absolutely hate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you just gotta warm up to him, you use to not like me!\u201d With a quick slurp of the soup, Kirishima declared the soup done, pulling out two bowls and passing one to Bakugou who snatched it and took a seat.Kirishima watched as he took a generous pour of the soup, pulling his clothes tighter as the wind picked up.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t a kleptomaniac. That bastard is.\u201d Bakugou angrily scarfed down his food. Kirishima blew the steaming air off his. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I thought coming this far away from the station was smart.\u201d He leaned back, back pressed against the boxes of samples, his scarf flapping in the soft wind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd he ruined my gloves.\u201d The fabric was hanging on, barely, burnt to a crisp by the fabric around his wrist.\u00a0</p><p>Kirishima swallowed down another spoonful before accusingly pointing his spoon at Bakugou, \u201cI don\u2019t think he forced you to use your quirk.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>This sent Bakugou into a spiral. Listing the many things that the Penguins destroyed whilst they stayed in this icy hell.\u00a0</p><p>Kirishima enjoyed the entertainment, agreeing and disagreeing when need be. He barely saw the small mass of black scurry toward them. Kirishima smiled before matching Bakugou\u2019s angry gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s not their fault they are so curious.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Bakugou scoffed before pouring more soup into his bowl, \u201cWell it is their fault if they are being assho-\u201c</p><p>Bakugou let out a choking sound as he fell to the side, dropping his bowl and tainting the snow. It looked that of a murder scene. Bakugou laying on the floor next to the red splatter.

Staring with pure anger in his eyes. This would go on for at least an hour (he wouldn\u2019t be the one losing this contest), it happened enough, enough that Kirishima had a whole Instagram of the pictures; him in stare offs with those demons, them standing and staring (the others at the station loved to tease him about it). There was the occasional time he\u2019d befriend some, loners, they\u2019d come by, and softly rub against his knees, soft chirps and he\u2019d pet them, knuckle under their chin as they nuzzled into him. Kiri has far less pictures of that. But even with the vast majority of penguins, most preferred Kiri,and of course Bakugou had his favorites to but there was <i>one</i>. One penguin Bakugou despised with all his being.</p><p>Kiri has stuck to calling him Pep, Bakugou didn\u2019t know or care to as why but he hated that penguin with everything he had to offer.</p><p>He was a smaller fellow, constantly tripping over his feet as he waddled around. It started out soft and nice and fun. He favored Kiri at first, and stuck around the camp more than the others, wandering around curiously and chirping, he loved to watch Kiri take pictures or bite at the bolts in the equipment. But that wasn\u2019t why Bakugou hated him.</p><p>Bakugou, due to his quirk had to take some of his layers off when the wind had slowed and he was overwhelmed with the stuffy warmth and he usually found himself pulling his scarf off and setting it beside him, under his mug of coffee or book. It was a bad habit he had, he can admit that. They needed to say as warm as possible, as to not catch a cold or something worse but it was usually fine, no extreme backlash or punishment, just a gentle reminder from Kiri and everything would be fine.</p><p>But Pep had to mess that up.</p><p>He remembered the day it started up. He had set his scarf off to the side while he made some dinner for him and Kiri (the only good bean soup, Bakugou couldn\u2019t wait for real food when they finished in Antarctica), the heat from the pot boiled up at him, steam coating him face, one of the understandable times that Kiri would allow for him to take off some layers. He ignored the vast amount of texts from his friends, Kaminari and the others pleas for them to eat at the station. Kirishima just said he\u2019d need a few more pictures and they would be done. Bakugou could go with a few more samples anyway.\u00a0</p><p>He heard Pep\u2019s small chirps, approaching slowly, Bakugou has very stupidly ignored him, thinking he was looking for Kiri or just inspecting the equipment again. Oh, how he was so wrong. He only knew something happened when he heard the loud clatter of objects falling.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>He turned around just in time to see the small tower of his objects smash against the white floor, snow spraying everywhere. Bakugou had rushed to pick up the objects, carefully inspecting them, searching for any cracks or fractures. He heard the faint call from Kiri, somewhere of in the distant roll of the white hills, \u201cHey what happened? You okay?\u201dBakugou simply waved a hand back at him, \u201cThe equipm-\u201c</p><p><i>Squawk.</i></p><p>\u00a0Oh.</p><p>Everything had made sense at that point. He didn\u2019t even need to look up and see the small penguin fleeing the crime scene, Bakuou\u2019s scarf securely tucked in his beak.</p><p>That damned penguin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou motherfucker!\u201d</p><p>Usually, Bakugou was usually able to control his quirk, in favor of keeping the expensive gloves intact (and making sure he doesn\u2019t get frostbite and lose his finger) but with the anger that surged through him he couldn\u2019t help but let a few explosions leave his palms. He could hear the faint screams of shock from Kirishima.</p><p>\u201cGet back here, you fucking-\u201c</p><p>Kirishima had slid down the hill fast enough to see the start of the small battle. Bakugou letting out his loud disgruntled screams as he chased the small bird, stumbling over his feet and the scarf in between his beak. Pep had already made it quite a ways away from the scene, Bakugou already gaining speed.\u00a0</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop the laugh that left him as he quickly stuffed his hand into his pockets, fumbling with his phone. Oh, he just had to get this on camera.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStop running, you bitch!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Bakugou\u2019s palms lit up with small pops of explosions, his gloves beyond saving at this point. Pep simply squeaked happily and ran faster. Bakugou could hear Kirishima\u2019s laughter in the background.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny! You\u2019re enabling this bastard!\u201d\u00a0In the far distance Bakugou could see a small audience of penguins. Anger pulsed through him.\u00a0</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Bakugou to catch up to Pep, grabbing the edge of the scarf and pulling at it. Pep let out a loud squawk before falling backward and screaming up at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGive it back you flightless fuck.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Pep offended, pulls back and lets out a series of fierce honks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t yell at me, you thief!\u201d Bakugou yanks again, attempting to grab more of the scarf just to have his fingers bit at.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOw, you fucker! It\u2019s not yours!\u201d Bakugou only got angry squawks in response, he felt the small pops coming off his palms. Pep continued nipping and pulling back the scarf.</p><p>Bakugou growled back and wrapped his hands around Pep\u2019s small body. Pep squirmed, screaming and trying desperately to nip at Bakugou\u2019s fingers. Bakugou growled at him before pulling the scarf out of Pep\u2019s beak, who squawked sadly at the loss.\u00a0</p><p>Bakugou sloppily wrapped it back around his neck, half of it hanging halfway down his back before pointing sternly at the penguin (who was angrily glaring back).\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStop stealing my shit or I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d setting Pep back down and stomping back to the base. Pep let out another honk, nipped at Bakugou\u2019s feet and then fled back to the audience of penguins near Kirishima. Probably to gossip to his friends about angering the tall monster.\u00a0</p><p>Bakugou shoved his hands into his pockets and grumbled about the lack of respect and idiocy of the penguins before picking up the mess that Pep had made.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe sure does seem to like you.\u201d He could hear the smile in Kirishima\u2019s voice. Bakugou simply growled, waving a hand at him, signaling him to leave.</p><p>Kirishima chuckled then dropped down to help pick up the items on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he likes me, I absolutely hate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you just gotta warm up to him, you use to not like me!\u201d With a quick slurp of the soup, Kirishima declared the soup done, pulling out two bowls and passing one to Bakugou who snatched it and took a seat.Kirishima watched as he took a generous pour of the soup, pulling his clothes tighter as the wind picked up.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t a kleptomaniac. That bastard is.\u201d Bakugou angrily scarfed down his food. Kirishima blew the steaming air off his. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I thought coming this far away from the station was smart.\u201d He leaned back, back pressed against the boxes of samples, his scarf flapping in the soft wind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd he ruined my gloves.\u201d The fabric was hanging on, barely, burnt to a crisp by the fabric around his wrist.\u00a0</p><p>Kirishima swallowed down another spoonful before accusingly pointing his spoon at Bakugou, \u201cI don\u2019t think he forced you to use your quirk.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>This sent Bakugou into a spiral. Listing the many things that the Penguins destroyed whilst they stayed in this icy hell.\u00a0</p><p>Kirishima enjoyed the entertainment, agreeing and disagreeing when need be. He barely saw the small mass of black scurry toward them. Kirishima smiled before matching Bakugou\u2019s angry gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s not their fault they are so curious.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Bakugou scoffed before pouring more soup into his bowl, \u201cWell it is their fault if they are being assho-\u201c</p><p>Bakugou let out a choking sound as he fell to the side, dropping his bowl and tainting the snow. It looked that of a murder scene. Bakugou laying on the floor next to the red splatter. Pep squeaked in achievement pulling the scarf free from Bakugou\u2019s neck and diving away into the snow.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cARE YOU KIDDING ME.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima watched as Bakugou chased the penguin across the white plains, cursing loudly as he ran.</p><p>Bakugou was right about a few things about Antarctica. There were things Kirishima could stand to lose but if he had Bakugou and the penguins he would stand through all of it.\u00a0</p>",

Pep simply squeaked happily and ran faster. Bakugou could hear Kirishima\u2019s laughter in the background.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny! You\u2019re enabling this bastard!\u201d\u00a0In the far distance Bakugou could see a small audience of penguins. Anger pulsed through him.\u00a0</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Bakugou to catch up to Pep, grabbing the edge of the scarf and pulling at it. Pep let out a loud squawk before falling backward and screaming up at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGive it back you flightless fuck.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Pep offended, pulls back and lets out a series of fierce honks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t yell at me, you thief!\u201d Bakugou yanks again, attempting to grab more of the scarf just to have his fingers bit at.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOw, you fucker! It\u2019s not yours!\u201d Bakugou only got angry squawks in response, he felt the small pops coming off his palms. Pep continued nipping and pulling back the scarf.</p><p>Bakugou growled back and wrapped his hands around Pep\u2019s small body. Pep squirmed, screaming and trying desperately to nip at Bakugou\u2019s fingers. Bakugou growled at him before pulling the scarf out of Pep\u2019s beak, who squawked sadly at the loss.\u00a0</p><p>Bakugou sloppily wrapped it back around his neck, half of it hanging halfway down his back before pointing sternly at the penguin (who was angrily glaring back).\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStop stealing my shit or I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d setting Pep back down and stomping back to the base. Pep let out another honk, nipped at Bakugou\u2019s feet and then fled back to the audience of penguins near Kirishima. Probably to gossip to his friends about angering the tall monster.\u00a0</p><p>Bakugou shoved his hands into his pockets and grumbled about the lack of respect and idiocy of the penguins before picking up the mess that Pep had made.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe sure does seem to like you.\u201d He could hear the smile in Kirishima\u2019s voice. Bakugou simply growled, waving a hand at him, signaling him to leave.</p><p>Kirishima chuckled then dropped down to help pick up the items on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he likes me, I absolutely hate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you just gotta warm up to him, you use to not like me!\u201d With a quick slurp of the soup, Kirishima declared the soup done, pulling out two bowls and passing one to Bakugou who snatched it and took a seat.Kirishima watched as he took a generous pour of the soup, pulling his clothes tighter as the wind picked up.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t a kleptomaniac. That bastard is.\u201d Bakugou angrily scarfed down his food. Kirishima blew the steaming air off his. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I thought coming this far away from the station was smart.\u201d He leaned back, back pressed against the boxes of samples, his scarf flapping in the soft wind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd he ruined my gloves.\u201d The fabric was hanging on, barely, burnt to a crisp by the fabric around his wrist.\u00a0</p><p>Kirishima swallowed down another spoonful before accusingly pointing his spoon at Bakugou, \u201cI don\u2019t think he forced you to use your quirk.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>This sent Bakugou into a spiral. Listing the many things that the Penguins destroyed whilst they stayed in this icy hell.\u00a0</p><p>Kirishima enjoyed the entertainment, agreeing and disagreeing when need be. He barely saw the small mass of black scurry toward them. Kirishima smiled before matching Bakugou\u2019s angry gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s not their fault they are so curious.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Bakugou scoffed before pouring more soup into his bowl, \u201cWell it is their fault if they are being assho-\u201c</p><p>Bakugou let out a choking sound as he fell to the side, dropping his bowl and tainting the snow. It looked that of a murder scene. Bakugou laying on the floor next to the red splatter. Pep squeaked in achievement pulling the scarf free from Bakugou\u2019s neck and diving away into the snow.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cARE YOU KIDDING ME.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima watched as Bakugou chased the penguin across the white plains, cursing loudly as he ran.</p><p>Bakugou was right about a few things about Antarctica. There were things Kirishima could stand to lose but if he had Bakugou and the penguins he would stand through all of it.\u00a0</p>",

He use to be very disagreeable with it, the fact that it looked like he was always blushing. Over time he had gotten used to it, he had to. But that doesn&rsquo;t at all mean that he can&rsquo;t grumble and complain about it.&nbsp;</p><p>He had probably complained about every and anything about Antarctica at one point. The cold, the snow, the wind, their base, his coat, and the penguins. <i>God</i>, the penguins. Bakugou had come here for the science. That was it, science was all he really needed, nothing else mattered to him. He would stay in this cold hell for months just for the science and that&rsquo;s what he did but not he did not sign up for the penguins. Of course, he knew there was going to be some chance encounters. How could he <i>not</i> think that but he was entirely wrong on their behavior.</p><p>He had seen penguins before when he was younger. In the zoo exhibit, squawking and screaming as they plunge into the water, droplets of water splashing against the glass. Seeing their habitat, rocky and icy, snow around the corner, dents where they slid through was amazing. Though he was far more invested in the science in the ice.Kirishima was entirely different. He&rsquo;d smile bright as he waved his camera around hand tightly curled around it as not to drop it, despite it being secured with the strap, and explain for the fifth time that day how much he loved this job.He&rsquo;d say some sweet shit about animals, about his love for them and the surrounding nature but while Bakugou could admire his dedication, going so far from home into an isolated continent full of ice and with him of all people, he could not get over how much he loved penguins. He just didn&rsquo;t understand it.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t just his insufferable hate for penguins but the fact that the penguins loved and practically fawned over Kirishima (which faintly surprised Bakugou when he first saw it, they&rsquo;d both thought that maybe the penguins would be scared of him, his shiny sharp teeth a possible threat but they weren&rsquo;t). Kirishima spent hours later screaming about how he felt so loved and accepted. They&rsquo;d see him taking his pictures and rush over, squawking and flapping their fins as the surged him. It would be adorable if Bakugou liked penguins, but all he saw was the small hell demons as they swarmed his friend (and no, he wasn&rsquo;t jealous).&nbsp;</p><p><i>Disgusting.</i></p><p>Usually, they&rsquo;d leave him alone, they&rsquo;d stalk close, softy squawking and watch him and he&rsquo;d stare back. Staring with pure anger in his eyes. This would go on for at least an hour (he wouldn&rsquo;t be the one losing this contest), it happened enough, enough that Kirishima had a whole Instagram of the pictures; him in stare offs with those demons, them standing and staring (the others at the station loved to tease him about it). There was the occasional time he&rsquo;d befriend some, loners, they&rsquo;d come by, and softly rub against his knees, soft chirps and he&rsquo;d pet them, knuckle under their chin as they nuzzled into him. Kiri has far less pictures of that. But even with the vast majority of penguins, most preferred Kiri,and of course Bakugou had his favorites to but there was <i>one</i>. One penguin Bakugou despised with all his being.</p><p>Kiri has stuck to calling him Pep, Bakugou didn&rsquo;t know or care to as why but he hated that penguin with everything he had to offer.</p><p>He was a smaller fellow, constantly tripping over his feet as he waddled around. It started out soft and nice and fun. He favored Kiri at first, and stuck around the camp more than the others, wandering around curiously and chirping, he loved to watch Kiri take pictures or bite at the bolts in the equipment. But that wasn&rsquo;t why Bakugou hated him.</p><p>Bakugou, due to his quirk had to take some of his layers off when the wind had slowed and he was overwhelmed with the stuffy warmth and he usually found himself pulling his scarf off and setting it beside him, under his mug of coffee or book. It was a bad habit he had, he can admit that. They needed to say as warm as possible, as to not catch a cold or something worse but it was usually fine, no extreme backlash or punishment, just a gentle reminder from Kiri and everything would be fine.</p><p>But Pep had to mess that up.</p><p>He remembered the day it started up. He had set his scarf off to the side while he made some dinner for him and Kiri (the only good bean soup, Bakugou couldn&rsquo;t wait for real food when they finished in Antarctica), the heat from the pot boiled up at him, steam coating him face, one of the understandable times that Kiri would allow for him to take off some layers. He ignored the vast amount of texts from his friends, Kaminari and the others pleas for them to eat at the station. Kirishima just said he&rsquo;d need a few more pictures and they would be done. Bakugou could go with a few more samples anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>He heard Pep&rsquo;s small chirps, approaching slowly, Bakugou has very stupidly ignored him, thinking he was looking for Kiri or just inspecting the equipment again. Oh, how he was so wrong. He only knew something happened when he heard the loud clatter of objects falling.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck?&rdquo;</p><p>He turned around just in time to see the small tower of his objects smash against the white floor, snow spraying everywhere. Bakugou had rushed to pick up the objects, carefully inspecting them, searching for any cracks or fractures. He heard the faint call from Kiri, somewhere of in the distant roll of the white hills, &ldquo;Hey what happened? You okay?&rdquo;Bakugou simply waved a hand back at him, &ldquo;The equipm-&ldquo;</p><p><i>Squawk.</i></p><p>&nbsp;Oh.</p><p>Everything had made sense at that point. He didn&rsquo;t even need to look up and see the small penguin fleeing the crime scene, Bakuou&rsquo;s scarf securely tucked in his beak.</p><p>That damned penguin.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You motherfucker!&rdquo;</p><p>Usually, Bakugou was usually able to control his quirk, in favor of keeping the expensive gloves intact (and making sure he doesn&rsquo;t get frostbite and lose his finger) but with the anger that surged through him he couldn&rsquo;t help but let a few explosions leave his palms. He could hear the faint screams of shock from Kirishima.</p><p>&ldquo;Get back here, you fucking-&ldquo;</p><p>Kirishima had slid down the hill fast enough to see the start of the small battle. Bakugou letting out his loud disgruntled screams as he chased the small bird, stumbling over his feet and the scarf in between his beak. Pep had already made it quite a ways away from the scene, Bakugou already gaining speed.&nbsp;</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t stop the laugh that left him as he quickly stuffed his hand into his pockets, fumbling with his phone. Oh, he just had to get this on camera.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop running, you bitch!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Bakugou&rsquo;s palms lit up with small pops of explosions, his gloves beyond saving at this point.
