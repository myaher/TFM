As always, &lt;3 Isabel. </b></i></p><p><i><b>Warnings for what is to come in this series: M 4 Mature(wrap the Willy b4 u get silly), use of crude language, and mention of alcohol and drugs (plz for ur safety don&rsquo;t mix these two together.) </b></i></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Part One:</b> The first show.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><i><strike>Rule number one : no kissing</strike></i></p><p>You swiped the red lipstick across your lips, pressing them together and releasing them slowly. You wanted to go for sultry, sultry was good but you also wanted simple and classic.<i> </i>That&rsquo;s why you settled on black winged eyeliner. A coat of mascara on your eyelashes too, a little bit on the bottom ones too.</p><p>&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t you look sexy!&rdquo; </p><p>Leaning on the door frame stood Mars. It wasn&rsquo;t quite clear how you had become friends; let alone how you met. A small smirk playing on her lips. She was the embodiment of rebellious. She was the girl you would read about or see only in movies. <i>She was your mentor. </i></p><p>&ldquo;You like?&rdquo; </p><p>You immediately began to twirl showing off your outfit ; a simple spaghetti strap a-line dress that ended mid-thigh. A nice pair of chunky heels that you got from the thrift down the road clad on your feet. Your hair straighten and tied up. <i>Even though that took for fucking ever. </i>And lastly your gold Virgin Mary necklace falling to your chest. <i>Simple was good, simple was classy</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Love!&rdquo; </p><p>\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help the nerves in your stomach. Yes, you had done this plenty before but this time it was different. However you tried to push that thought away because it could not, under any circumstance be different. </p><p>He only had to notice you tonight and he would be hooked. <i>He had to be.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t believe we convince Dani to get us these seats, they&rsquo;re absolutely fucking ridiculous.&rdquo; </p><p>You nodded, still feeling your nerves on edge since the moment you saw how close to the stage you were. Dani could only ever manage to snatch side seats. But you were front and center. </p><p>&ldquo;Awfully quiet babe, you okay?&rdquo; </p><p>You nodded once again before mumbling out a, </p><p>&ldquo;Just a bit nervous is all.&rdquo; </p><p>Mars sympathized with you, but not entirely. You had no reason to be, you would be fine. <i>You always were</i>. </p><p>A few hours later and the lights dimmed.  Spotlights turned on once again and the screaming filled your senses. You loved this thrill. You loved concerts, the rush, the adrenaline, and most of all the connection. Seeing the way a musician connects and immerses themselves with a crowd of thousands of people, was and always would be exhilarating; <i>no matter how many shows you had been to.</i></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b><strike>Rule number five:</strike></b><strike> no screaming, only in bed.</strike></p><p>You contained your complete composure, letting a small smile fall on your lips. You had to be happy, but not too happy. Interested but not too interested or he wouldn&rsquo;t spare a second glance. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do good babe.&rdquo; </p><p>Mars patted your back before immersing herself back to her character. She usually would try to go for a crew member but this was now, maybe if it was five months ago she would have. But it wasn&rsquo;t and despite her being strong, she still was recovering. </p><p>The whole show you danced along to the music. Talking a bit to Mars every now and then. Trying so hard not to look at him too much. It was only four songs in and you had caught him looking 3 times. He stayed to the front of you which was absolutely a good sign. </p><p>It was when he was singing Only Angel that you knew you had him wrapped around your finger.  He stooped down to your level watching, now more like admiring the way your body moved fluidly. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an angel, my only angel.&rdquo; </p><p>His right eye fell into a wink and a small smirk played at his lips you immediately pulled away from him and began singing along to the song. The screaming only got louder as the girls beside you tried to figure out to who he sent that wink to.</p><p>&ldquo;Cut it out.&rdquo; </p><p>Mars glared at you and you nodded immediately returning to dancing instead. Forgeting that singing was not good. Interested but not too interested. </p><p>After more subtle flirting and gazes the show had finally ended. He wish everyone a good night and walked off with the rest of the band. </p><p>&ldquo;Only 30 minutes. Remember you only wait thirty minutes, I&rsquo;ll be in the car. Text me when your in okay love? &rdquo; </p><p>You nodded, before taking your hair down and grabbing any fallen pieces and securing it back up. She was a bit worried for you, it had been the first time you guys had done this since then,</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, mum. Now go! He&rsquo;ll never send anyone if I am not alone!&rdquo; </p><p>She rolled her eyes and  smiled before pressing a kiss to your cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;Stay safe and have fun okay love?&rdquo; </p><p>You pressed a chaste kiss and pushed her towards the leaving crowd. Bidding Mars a goodbye.</p><p><i>15 minutes.</i></p><p>You stood there pretending to wait for someone. That&rsquo;s what always did the trick. The waiting game of course. Your back from the stage, and your arms wrapped around yourself. It was a nice show, a part of you would feel disappointed if he never bothered to get you. <i>But you couldn&rsquo;t let it, again this wasn&rsquo;t any different.</i></p><p>&ldquo;S'Quite cold don&rsquo;t know why you wore that lovely.&rdquo; </p><p>You let out a nervous breath letting a small smile fall to your lips before turning around. He looked so good, just like he always did. He stood on the stage, looking down at you. Changed in a pair of joggers and a white long sleeve. That&rsquo;s when you noted he was that type, didn&rsquo;t even bother sending a messenger. This is gonna be fun. </p><p>You held your small smile, rolling your eyes slightly and looking back up to him before sassing back, &ldquo;I had a jacket, my friend took it though. She forgot hers in the car.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo; that an American accent I hear?&rdquo; </p><p>You nodded pressing your lips together. A silence fell for a second. His eyes dragged across your entire body, head to toe. No one was left surprisingly and it was just you and Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Ya enjoy the show lovely?&rdquo; </p><p>A smirk settling on his pink lips. Dimple popping out of his right cheek. You couldn&rsquo;t help the flutter in your heart at the sight. He truly had this aura and that was rare with most musicians. <i>No he was just like everyone else</i></p><p>&ldquo;Why, think it was the best show I&rsquo;ve been to in a while I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo; </p><p>You leaned back on the stage as he now sat, feet not even reaching the floor. Hands behind him, propping him up. Taking notice of the many rings clad on his fingers and how they all looked so beautiful themselves. </p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that peach?&rdquo; </p><p>You turned towards him completely. Tongue swiping over your bottom lip before speaking, </p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo; talking to you, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; </p><p>A raspy chuckle fell from his lips, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but let your smile grow a little wider. </p><p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s ya name lovely?&rdquo; </p><p>Both of your arms went to his sides. Setting yourself in front of him. Admiring his green eyes and the intoxicating scent that lingered of his body; you could definitely get used to that. </p><p>&ldquo;Name is Y/n.&rdquo; </p><p>He reached out pushing back a piece of hair that somehow had managed to fallen. A smile still on his lips. After a while he continued his questioning,</p><p>&ldquo;How old are ya bub?&rdquo; </p><p>You were 19. But for some reason 19 always scared any musician over 21. So you had to cute when answering this or he would never spare a second thought about you,</p><p>&ldquo;Old enough for you, promise.&rdquo; </p><p>\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0</p><p>He pushed you against the door as soon as it slammed shut. Only four blocks away, and no one in the crew said anything about your appearance which was truly a surprise to you. It was a nice hotel, you&rsquo;ve been here once before and prices weren&rsquo;t all too bad;Then again you always stayed in the decent rooms. </p><p>He leaned down to which you stopped him. Pushing his body away from yours. Nerves still settled deep in your tummy, or was it butterflies? <i>Fuck, it was butterflies</i>. Again, he was not any different. Even if he was Harry fucking Styles, the man you had loved since you were a fucking preteen. He was just another musician. <i>Just another fuck</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter love?&rdquo; </p><p>You sat on the bed patting a space next to him. He followed almost immediately and set his arm behind you. </p><p>&ldquo;Just got a rule,&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;S'fine love, go on.&rdquo; </p><p>You reached up playing with the tips of his hair, it was growing back and you couldn&rsquo;t tell what you wanted more. His long hair or his now short hair resembling a somewhat better version of his 2013 hair. </p><p>&ldquo;No kissing.&rdquo; </p><p>His eyes widened a bit, and he let out a laugh thinking you weren&rsquo;t serious. <i>They never did.</i> After a silence fell he cleared his throat before prying, </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re serious.&rdquo; </p><p>You hummed, nodding. It always threw them off. But that rule was there for a reason. It was too intimate, too personal. <i>Too invested for being just a groupie</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo; that all lovely?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yea, it is.&rdquo; And with one more look you got up and went on your knees in from of him. Hands setting on his thighs, his eyes not leaving you and you brought them up to the drawstrings that were tied together. </p><p>&ldquo;Now, can I suck your cock?&rdquo; </p>",

Interested but not too interested or he wouldn\u2019t spare a second glance. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do good babe.\u201d </p><p>Mars patted your back before immersing herself back to her character. She usually would try to go for a crew member but this was now, maybe if it was five months ago she would have. But it wasn\u2019t and despite her being strong, she still was recovering. </p><p>The whole show you danced along to the music. Talking a bit to Mars every now and then. Trying so hard not to look at him too much. It was only four songs in and you had caught him looking 3 times. He stayed to the front of you which was absolutely a good sign. </p><p>It was when he was singing Only Angel that you knew you had him wrapped around your finger.  He stooped down to your level watching, now more like admiring the way your body moved fluidly. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an angel, my only angel.\u201d </p><p>His right eye fell into a wink and a small smirk played at his lips you immediately pulled away from him and began singing along to the song.

Forgeting that singing was not good. Interested but not too interested. </p><p>After more subtle flirting and gazes the show had finally ended. He wish everyone a good night and walked off with the rest of the band. </p><p>\u201cOnly 30 minutes. Remember you only wait thirty minutes, I\u2019ll be in the car. Text me when your in okay love? \u201d </p><p>You nodded, before taking your hair down and grabbing any fallen pieces and securing it back up. She was a bit worried for you, it had been the first time you guys had done this since then,</p><p>\u201cYes, mum. Now go! He\u2019ll never send anyone if I am not alone!\u201d </p><p>She rolled her eyes and  smiled before pressing a kiss to your cheek. </p><p>\u201cStay safe and have fun okay love?\u201d </p><p>You pressed a chaste kiss and pushed her towards the leaving crowd. Bidding Mars a goodbye.</p><p><i>15 minutes.</i></p><p>You stood there pretending to wait for someone. That\u2019s what always did the trick. The waiting game of course. Your back from the stage, and your arms wrapped around yourself. It was a nice show, a part of you would feel disappointed if he never bothered to get you. <i>But you couldn\u2019t let it, again this wasn\u2019t any different.</i></p><p>\u201cS'Quite cold don\u2019t know why you wore that lovely.\u201d </p><p>You let out a nervous breath letting a small smile fall to your lips before turning around. He looked so good, just like he always did. He stood on the stage, looking down at you. Changed in a pair of joggers and a white long sleeve. That\u2019s when you noted he was that type, didn\u2019t even bother sending a messenger. This is gonna be fun. </p><p>You held your small smile, rolling your eyes slightly and looking back up to him before sassing back, \u201cI had a jacket, my friend took it though. She forgot hers in the car.\u201d </p><p>\u201cS\u2019 that an American accent I hear?\u201d </p><p>You nodded pressing your lips together. A silence fell for a second. His eyes dragged across your entire body, head to toe. No one was left surprisingly and it was just you and Harry.</p><p>\u201cYa enjoy the show lovely?\u201d </p><p>A smirk settling on his pink lips. Dimple popping out of his right cheek. You couldn\u2019t help the flutter in your heart at the sight. He truly had this aura and that was rare with most musicians. <i>No he was just like everyone else</i></p><p>\u201cWhy, think it was the best show I\u2019ve been to in a while I\u2019d say.\u201d </p><p>You leaned back on the stage as he now sat, feet not even reaching the floor. Hands behind him, propping him up. Taking notice of the many rings clad on his fingers and how they all looked so beautiful themselves. </p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that peach?\u201d </p><p>You turned towards him completely. Tongue swiping over your bottom lip before speaking, </p><p>\u201cM\u2019 talking to you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d </p><p>A raspy chuckle fell from his lips, and you couldn\u2019t help but let your smile grow a little wider. </p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s ya name lovely?\u201d </p><p>Both of your arms went to his sides. Setting yourself in front of him. Admiring his green eyes and the intoxicating scent that lingered of his body; you could definitely get used to that. </p><p>\u201cName is Y/n.\u201d </p><p>He reached out pushing back a piece of hair that somehow had managed to fallen. A smile still on his lips. After a while he continued his questioning,</p><p>\u201cHow old are ya bub?\u201d </p><p>You were 19. But for some reason 19 always scared any musician over 21. So you had to cute when answering this or he would never spare a second thought about you,</p><p>\u201cOld enough for you, promise.\u201d </p><p>\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0</p><p>He pushed you against the door as soon as it slammed shut. Only four blocks away, and no one in the crew said anything about your appearance which was truly a surprise to you. It was a nice hotel, you\u2019ve been here once before and prices weren\u2019t all too bad;Then again you always stayed in the decent rooms. </p><p>He leaned down to which you stopped him. Pushing his body away from yours. Nerves still settled deep in your tummy, or was it butterflies? <i>Fuck, it was butterflies</i>. Again, he was not any different. Even if he was Harry fucking Styles, the man you had loved since you were a fucking preteen. He was just another musician. <i>Just another fuck</i>.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter love?\u201d </p><p>You sat on the bed patting a space next to him. He followed almost immediately and set his arm behind you. </p><p>\u201cJust got a rule,\u201d </p><p>\u201cS'fine love, go on.\u201d </p><p>You reached up playing with the tips of his hair, it was growing back and you couldn\u2019t tell what you wanted more. His long hair or his now short hair resembling a somewhat better version of his 2013 hair. </p><p>\u201cNo kissing.\u201d </p><p>His eyes widened a bit, and he let out a laugh thinking you weren\u2019t serious. <i>They never did.</i> After a silence fell he cleared his throat before prying, </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d </p><p>You hummed, nodding. It always threw them off. But that rule was there for a reason. It was too intimate, too personal. <i>Too invested for being just a groupie</i>. </p><p>\u201cS\u2019 that all lovely?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYea, it is.\u201d And with one more look you got up and went on your knees in from of him. Hands setting on his thighs, his eyes not leaving you and you brought them up to the drawstrings that were tied together. </p><p>\u201cNow, can I suck your cock?\u201d </p></p>",

But you were front and center. </p><p>&ldquo;Awfully quiet babe, you okay?&rdquo; </p><p>You nodded once again before mumbling out a, </p><p>&ldquo;Just a bit nervous is all.&rdquo; </p><p>Mars sympathized with you, but not entirely. You had no reason to be, you would be fine. <i>You always were</i>. </p><p>A few hours later and the lights dimmed.  Spotlights turned on once again and the screaming filled your senses. You loved this thrill. You loved concerts, the rush, the adrenaline, and most of all the connection. Seeing the way a musician connects and immerses themselves with a crowd of thousands of people, was and always would be exhilarating; <i>no matter how many shows you had been to.</i></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><b><strike>Rule number five:</strike></b><strike> no screaming, only in bed.</strike></p><p>You contained your complete composure, letting a small smile fall on your lips. You had to be happy, but not too happy. Interested but not too interested or he wouldn&rsquo;t spare a second glance. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do good babe.&rdquo; </p><p>Mars patted your back before immersing herself back to her character. She usually would try to go for a crew member but this was now, maybe if it was five months ago she would have. But it wasn&rsquo;t and despite her being strong, she still was recovering. </p><p>The whole show you danced along to the music. Talking a bit to Mars every now and then. Trying so hard not to look at him too much. It was only four songs in and you had caught him looking 3 times. He stayed to the front of you which was absolutely a good sign. </p><p>It was when he was singing Only Angel that you knew you had him wrapped around your finger.  He stooped down to your level watching, now more like admiring the way your body moved fluidly. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an angel, my only angel.&rdquo; </p><p>His right eye fell into a wink and a small smirk played at his lips you immediately pulled away from him and began singing along to the song. The screaming only got louder as the girls beside you tried to figure out to who he sent that wink to.</p><p>&ldquo;Cut it out.&rdquo; </p><p>Mars glared at you and you nodded immediately returning to dancing instead. Forgeting that singing was not good. Interested but not too interested. </p><p>After more subtle flirting and gazes the show had finally ended. He wish everyone a good night and walked off with the rest of the band. </p><p>&ldquo;Only 30 minutes. Remember you only wait thirty minutes, I&rsquo;ll be in the car. Text me when your in okay love? &rdquo; </p><p>You nodded, before taking your hair down and grabbing any fallen pieces and securing it back up. She was a bit worried for you, it had been the first time you guys had done this since then,</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, mum. Now go! He&rsquo;ll never send anyone if I am not alone!&rdquo; </p><p>She rolled her eyes and  smiled before pressing a kiss to your cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;Stay safe and have fun okay love?&rdquo; </p><p>You pressed a chaste kiss and pushed her towards the leaving crowd. Bidding Mars a goodbye.</p><p><i>15 minutes.</i></p><p>You stood there pretending to wait for someone. That&rsquo;s what always did the trick. The waiting game of course. Your back from the stage, and your arms wrapped around yourself. It was a nice show, a part of you would feel disappointed if he never bothered to get you. <i>But you couldn&rsquo;t let it, again this wasn&rsquo;t any different.</i></p><p>&ldquo;S'Quite cold don&rsquo;t know why you wore that lovely.&rdquo; </p><p>You let out a nervous breath letting a small smile fall to your lips before turning around. He looked so good, just like he always did. He stood on the stage, looking down at you. Changed in a pair of joggers and a white long sleeve. That&rsquo;s when you noted he was that type, didn&rsquo;t even bother sending a messenger. This is gonna be fun. </p><p>You held your small smile, rolling your eyes slightly and looking back up to him before sassing back, &ldquo;I had a jacket, my friend took it though. She forgot hers in the car.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo; that an American accent I hear?&rdquo; </p><p>You nodded pressing your lips together. A silence fell for a second. His eyes dragged across your entire body, head to toe. No one was left surprisingly and it was just you and Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Ya enjoy the show lovely?&rdquo; </p><p>A smirk settling on his pink lips. Dimple popping out of his right cheek. You couldn&rsquo;t help the flutter in your heart at the sight. He truly had this aura and that was rare with most musicians. <i>No he was just like everyone else</i></p><p>&ldquo;Why, think it was the best show I&rsquo;ve been to in a while I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo; </p><p>You leaned back on the stage as he now sat, feet not even reaching the floor. Hands behind him, propping him up. Taking notice of the many rings clad on his fingers and how they all looked so beautiful themselves. </p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that peach?&rdquo; </p><p>You turned towards him completely. Tongue swiping over your bottom lip before speaking, </p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo; talking to you, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; </p><p>A raspy chuckle fell from his lips, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but let your smile grow a little wider. </p><p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s ya name lovely?&rdquo; </p><p>Both of your arms went to his sides. Setting yourself in front of him. Admiring his green eyes and the intoxicating scent that lingered of his body; you could definitely get used to that. </p><p>&ldquo;Name is Y/n.&rdquo; </p><p>He reached out pushing back a piece of hair that somehow had managed to fallen. A smile still on his lips. After a while he continued his questioning,</p><p>&ldquo;How old are ya bub?&rdquo; </p><p>You were 19. But for some reason 19 always scared any musician over 21. So you had to cute when answering this or he would never spare a second thought about you,</p><p>&ldquo;Old enough for you, promise.&rdquo; </p><p>&deg;&deg;&deg;</p><p>He pushed you against the door as soon as it slammed shut. Only four blocks away, and no one in the crew said anything about your appearance which was truly a surprise to you. It was a nice hotel, you&rsquo;ve been here once before and prices weren&rsquo;t all too bad;Then again you always stayed in the decent rooms. </p><p>He leaned down to which you stopped him. Pushing his body away from yours. Nerves still settled deep in your tummy, or was it butterflies? <i>Fuck, it was butterflies</i>. Again, he was not any different. Even if he was Harry fucking Styles, the man you had loved since you were a fucking preteen. He was just another musician. <i>Just another fuck</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter love?&rdquo; </p><p>You sat on the bed patting a space next to him. He followed almost immediately and set his arm behind you. </p><p>&ldquo;Just got a rule,&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;S'fine love, go on.&rdquo; </p><p>You reached up playing with the tips of his hair, it was growing back and you couldn&rsquo;t tell what you wanted more. His long hair or his now short hair resembling a somewhat better version of his 2013 hair. </p><p>&ldquo;No kissing.&rdquo; </p><p>His eyes widened a bit, and he let out a laugh thinking you weren&rsquo;t serious. <i>They never did.</i> After a silence fell he cleared his throat before prying, </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re serious.&rdquo; </p><p>You hummed, nodding. It always threw them off. But that rule was there for a reason. It was too intimate, too personal. <i>Too invested for being just a groupie</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo; that all lovely?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yea, it is.&rdquo; And with one more look you got up and went on your knees in from of him. Hands setting on his thighs, his eyes not leaving you and you brought them up to the drawstrings that were tied together. </p><p>&ldquo;Now, can I suck your cock?&rdquo; </p></p>",

His left hand was one nicely, well, decently. Harry was so master. </p><p>Painting his right hand is what always got him, because he wasn\u2019t a lefty. Therefore, it always ended up being a mess.</p><p>He only gets to enjoy having his nails done for a few hours though, he always takes it off before Y/N gets home.</p><p>Deep down, he knows she would still love him, but he\u2019s still afraid. Afraid she will judge him. Afraid she will not want to be with him anymore\u2014or even worse, she will think Harry feels differently about her. And he doesn\u2019t. Harry painting his nails and being bi (which he hasn\u2019t told her about either) isn\u2019t a game changer. Harry loved the relationship he has with Y/N and nothing changes. He just feels sexy with his nails painted, is that so bad? And he doesn\u2019t mind getting on his knees for a man, is that so bad? </p><p>Of course not while he\u2019s with Y/N. She\u2019s his baby. </p><p>Therefore, when Y/N walked into their shared bedroom and Harry was using <i>her</i> black nail polish on <i>his</i> nails\u2014she stood there for a moment, speechless. </p><p>\u201cY/N!-\u201c Harry almost choked. \u201cY/N, this isn\u2019t-it\u2019s not what it looks like-it\u2019s-\u201c</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She asked. \u201cBecause what it looks like is you\u2019re making a mess. You have to have a steady hand. And don\u2019t use so much, you have short nails, that way it won\u2019t drip off onto your skin,\u201d she said, putting her purse down and sitting beside Harry on their bed. \u201cHere, let me see?\u201d </p><p>Harry was&hellip;.shocked?</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He asked.</p><p>She nodded and laughed softly at his messy nails. \u201cOh, baby. I\u2019m gonna have to fix all of these, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>So she got up and went to the bathroom, retrieving the nail polish remover and a few cotton balls. Harry sat there, his hand in hers as she removed all of the nail polish from his finger tips and even the bit that dropped onto his knuckles&hellip;.remember, <i>he\u2019s not a master</i>. </p><p>\u201cYou get a little,\u201d she spoke, dipping the brush into the glass bottle of nail polish and wiping it on the edge before sliding it across Harry\u2019s short nails. \u201cAnd do a layer at a time&hellip;.\u201d she smiled when she finished one hand. \u201cSee?\u201d </p><p>She dipped the brush back into the bottle. \u201cGive me the other.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen when you finish both, the first one will be dry so you can go back and do the second layer\u2014which just helps so it doesn\u2019t chip.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, I usually just take it off,\u201d Harry mumbled timidly.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?! I\u2019m doing an amazing job. You better leave this on for at least a week,\u201d she said, focused on his nails and he smiled. </p><p>When she was done she spread her fingers and moved her hands back and forth, in drying motions. \u201cDo this to help them dry.\u201d </p><p>So he did, feeling absolutely beautiful and sexy and\u2014<i>he wanted to fuck her</i>. </p><p>\u201cLove, you didn\u2019t have to do that&hellip;I\u2019m sorry you saw that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry for what, bubs?\u201d She asked, kissing his cheek softly. \u201cSo long as nothing between me and you changes I\u2019m okay with you painting your nails. <i>I think it\u2019s cute</i>,\u201d she smiled sweetly.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d </p><p>She nodded. \u201cJust as long as you come to me until you practice more because what you had going on was-\u201c </p><p>\u201c<i>Shut up</i>!\u201d Harry giggled loudly. </p><p>Then Y/N gasped with an idea. \u201cHarry, I have an idea.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He asked as she got off of the bed and came back with a lilac nail polish. </p><p>\u201cPractice on me!\u201d </p><p>\u201cP-are you sure?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah! It\u2019ll be so much fun!\u201d </p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t deny the smile twitching at his lips. \u201cWell&hellip;<i>okay</i>, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRemember what I taught you,\u201d she said as he sipped the brush into the glass bottle\u2014then did what she taught him so that the brush wasn\u2019t dripping with paint. Then he delicately brushed over her nail, smiling when it came out perfect. \u201cGood,\u201d Y/N smiled as Harry continued. </p><p>He made few mistakes, and when he did Y/N taught him how to deal with them. Like gently using a dry or unpainted nail go clean off the sides of your nail when the paint drips off to the side, or wiping the brush clean when too much paint is already on the nail\u2014Harry learned a lot.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s nails were nearly dry when Harry spoke. \u201cWell, I guess now is as good a time to tell you as any&hellip;.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell me asked?\u201d She asked, her head tilting to the side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m&hellip;\u201d he took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m bi.\u201d </p><p>She was silent for a moment befor she smiled. \u201cYou are?\u201d </p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>\u201cI-<i>wait</i>. You aren\u2019t breaking up with me, are you?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>. No, I would never, baby. <i>You\u2019re my princess</i>. You know I love you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, okay, good,\u201d she smiled. \u201cWell, in that case, come give your princess some sugar!\u201d She held her arms open for a hug. She hummed as she held him tight. \u201cI love you so much, baby,\u201d she didn\u2019t realize just how much those words meant to Harry\u2014her having said them just after he came out to her\u2014he had tears in his eyes now. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so so proud of you for coming out and being comfortable with yourself and confidence\u2014and I\u2019m so happy and grateful that you felt comfortable enough with me to tell me. Congratulations,\u201d she kissed his cheek. \u201cHow does to feel to be out?\u201d She smiled after they pulled away.</p><p>She frowned when she saw that he was crying, \u201c&hellip;.baby?\u201d </p><p>His painted black finger nails wiped at his tears as he sniffled. </p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d She pouted, taking his hand in hers and using her free hand to wipe his cheeks. \u201c<i>What\u2019s that, huh</i>?\u201d She cooed. </p><p>\u201cI just,\u201d he shook his head and the sight of him crying broke Y/N\u2019s heart. \u201cThank you. You don\u2019t know how afraid I was for you to know that\u2014to even know that I paint my nails. I never planned on telling you any of this and you just,\u201d he shook his head and wiped his eyes once more to stop the tears from sliding down his cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re so accepting and loving and <i>sweet</i> and&hellip;.I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better girlfriend and I\u2019m so grateful to have you, baby. You\u2019re my everything. I love you so so much. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for everything.\u201d </p><p>Now Y/N was crying. \u201c<i>Baby</i>, you don\u2019t have to thank me. I love you. <i>No matter what</i>, okay?\u201d They hugged again, tightly\u2014neither of them wanted to let go. </p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t think any different of me? I don\u2019t want this to change us,\u201d Harry whispered.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s going to change us. I know you like to pain your nails. Do you understand how fun this is gonna be?!\u201d </p><p>Harry rolled his teary eyes with a laugh as he sniffled. What\u2019s he gotten himself into? He let go of her and smiled. \u201c<i>Baby love</i>, I\u2019m serious,\u201d he whined slightly. \u201cYou still love me? Still gonna call me daddy like the good girl you are?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never gonna stop calling you, daddy,\u201d she hummed. \u201cAnd this black nail polish only makes it roll off my tongue easier. You\u2019re fingers look much more desrieable to suck on,\u201d she said, making him laugh.</p><p>\u201cWanna suck on them now, lovey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not, gross. They\u2019ll taste like nail polish and remover! Go wash your hands and lets wait until tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>So Harry went and washed his hands with a smile that turned into a grin once he was alone in the bathroom. Harry\u2019s first time ever coming out couldn\u2019t of gone any better. This is the best day of his life. </p><p>____</p><p><a href=\"https://and-im-okay-with-it.tumblr.com/post/175259280741/masterlist-taking-requests\"><b><i>Masterlist</i></b></a> </p>",

She\u2019s his baby. </p><p>Therefore, when Y/N walked into their shared bedroom and Harry was using <i>her</i> black nail polish on <i>his</i> nails\u2014she stood there for a moment, speechless. </p><p>\u201cY/N!-\u201c Harry almost choked. \u201cY/N, this isn\u2019t-it\u2019s not what it looks like-it\u2019s-\u201c</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She asked. \u201cBecause what it looks like is you\u2019re making a mess. You have to have a steady hand. And don\u2019t use so much, you have short nails, that way it won\u2019t drip off onto your skin,\u201d she said, putting her purse down and sitting beside Harry on their bed. \u201cHere, let me see?\u201d </p><p>Harry was\u2026.shocked?</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He asked.</p><p>She nodded and laughed softly at his messy nails. \u201cOh, baby. I\u2019m gonna have to fix all of these, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>So she got up and went to the bathroom, retrieving the nail polish remover and a few cotton balls. Harry sat there, his hand in hers as she removed all of the nail polish from his finger tips and even the bit that dropped onto his knuckles\u2026.remember, <i>he\u2019s not a master</i>. </p><p>\u201cYou get a little,\u201d she spoke, dipping the brush into the glass bottle of nail polish and wiping it on the edge before sliding it across Harry\u2019s short nails. \u201cAnd do a layer at a time\u2026.\u201d she smiled when she finished one hand. \u201cSee?\u201d </p><p>She dipped the brush back into the bottle. \u201cGive me the other.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen when you finish both, the first one will be dry so you can go back and do the second layer\u2014which just helps so it doesn\u2019t chip.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, I usually just take it off,\u201d Harry mumbled timidly.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?! I\u2019m doing an amazing job. You better leave this on for at least a week,\u201d she said, focused on his nails and he smiled. </p><p>When she was done she spread her fingers and moved her hands back and forth, in drying motions. \u201cDo this to help them dry.\u201d </p><p>So he did, feeling absolutely beautiful and sexy and\u2014<i>he wanted to fuck her</i>. </p><p>\u201cLove, you didn\u2019t have to do that\u2026I\u2019m sorry you saw that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry for what, bubs?\u201d She asked, kissing his cheek softly. \u201cSo long as nothing between me and you changes I\u2019m okay with you painting your nails. <i>I think it\u2019s cute</i>,\u201d she smiled sweetly.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d </p><p>She nodded. \u201cJust as long as you come to me until you practice more because what you had going on was-\u201c </p><p>\u201c<i>Shut up</i>!\u201d Harry giggled loudly. </p><p>Then Y/N gasped with an idea. \u201cHarry, I have an idea.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He asked as she got off of the bed and came back with a lilac nail polish. </p><p>\u201cPractice on me!\u201d </p><p>\u201cP-are you sure?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah! It\u2019ll be so much fun!\u201d </p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t deny the smile twitching at his lips. \u201cWell\u2026<i>okay</i>, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRemember what I taught you,\u201d she said as he sipped the brush into the glass bottle\u2014then did what she taught him so that the brush wasn\u2019t dripping with paint. Then he delicately brushed over her nail, smiling when it came out perfect. \u201cGood,\u201d Y/N smiled as Harry continued. </p><p>He made few mistakes, and when he did Y/N taught him how to deal with them. Like gently using a dry or unpainted nail go clean off the sides of your nail when the paint drips off to the side, or wiping the brush clean when too much paint is already on the nail\u2014Harry learned a lot.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s nails were nearly dry when Harry spoke. \u201cWell, I guess now is as good a time to tell you as any\u2026.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell me asked?\u201d She asked, her head tilting to the side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d he took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m bi.\u201d </p><p>She was silent for a moment befor she smiled. \u201cYou are?\u201d </p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>\u201cI-<i>wait</i>. You aren\u2019t breaking up with me, are you?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>. No, I would never, baby. <i>You\u2019re my princess</i>. You know I love you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, okay, good,\u201d she smiled. \u201cWell, in that case, come give your princess some sugar!\u201d She held her arms open for a hug. She hummed as she held him tight. \u201cI love you so much, baby,\u201d she didn\u2019t realize just how much those words meant to Harry\u2014her having said them just after he came out to her\u2014he had tears in his eyes now. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so so proud of you for coming out and being comfortable with yourself and confidence\u2014and I\u2019m so happy and grateful that you felt comfortable enough with me to tell me. Congratulations,\u201d she kissed his cheek. \u201cHow does to feel to be out?\u201d She smiled after they pulled away.</p><p>She frowned when she saw that he was crying, \u201c\u2026.baby?\u201d </p><p>His painted black finger nails wiped at his tears as he sniffled. </p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d She pouted, taking his hand in hers and using her free hand to wipe his cheeks. \u201c<i>What\u2019s that, huh</i>?\u201d She cooed. </p><p>\u201cI just,\u201d he shook his head and the sight of him crying broke Y/N\u2019s heart. \u201cThank you. You don\u2019t know how afraid I was for you to know that\u2014to even know that I paint my nails. I never planned on telling you any of this and you just,\u201d he shook his head and wiped his eyes once more to stop the tears from sliding down his cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re so accepting and loving and <i>sweet</i> and\u2026.I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better girlfriend and I\u2019m so grateful to have you, baby. You\u2019re my everything. I love you so so much. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for everything.\u201d </p><p>Now Y/N was crying. \u201c<i>Baby</i>, you don\u2019t have to thank me. I love you. <i>No matter what</i>, okay?\u201d They hugged again, tightly\u2014neither of them wanted to let go. </p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t think any different of me? I don\u2019t want this to change us,\u201d Harry whispered.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s going to change us. I know you like to pain your nails. Do you understand how fun this is gonna be?!\u201d </p><p>Harry rolled his teary eyes with a laugh as he sniffled. What\u2019s he gotten himself into? He let go of her and smiled. \u201c<i>Baby love</i>, I\u2019m serious,\u201d he whined slightly. \u201cYou still love me? Still gonna call me daddy like the good girl you are?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never gonna stop calling you, daddy,\u201d she hummed. \u201cAnd this black nail polish only makes it roll off my tongue easier. You\u2019re fingers look much more desrieable to suck on,\u201d she said, making him laugh.</p><p>\u201cWanna suck on them now, lovey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not, gross. They\u2019ll taste like nail polish and remover! Go wash your hands and lets wait until tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>So Harry went and washed his hands with a smile that turned into a grin once he was alone in the bathroom. Harry\u2019s first time ever coming out couldn\u2019t of gone any better. This is the best day of his life. </p><p>____</p><p><a href=\"https://and-im-okay-with-it.tumblr.com/post/175259280741/masterlist-taking-requests\"><b><i>Masterlist</i></b></a> </p></p>",

His left hand was one nicely, well, decently. Harry was so master. </p><p>Painting his right hand is what always got him, because he wasn&rsquo;t a lefty. Therefore, it always ended up being a mess.</p><p>He only gets to enjoy having his nails done for a few hours though, he always takes it off before Y/N gets home.</p><p>Deep down, he knows she would still love him, but he&rsquo;s still afraid.
