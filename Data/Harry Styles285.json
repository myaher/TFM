        "answer": "<p><b>Warning: This is a long answer, so I\u2019ll put in a break for ya\u2019ll.</b></p><!-- more --><p>I\u2019ve talked a lot about how I factor the house placements in just as heavily as the zodiac sign, because they\u2019re very important. With that being said, the zodiac signs still matter. </p>\n\n<p>Harry is an Aquarius, there\u2019s no getting around that. He\u2019s going to act like an Aquarius wherever that energy is in his chart. I hate the stereotypes of someone being a \u201ctypical\u201d embodiment of a sign, because that implies that there can be no characteristics in a personality outside of that. Even with Harry\u2019s water house placements, he\u2019s got A LOT of concentrated Aquarius energy in his chart. </p>\n\n<p>Through my years of studying astrology, I\u2019ve learned a lot about Aquarius and how so many people are attracted to them. The thing is that the reasons people have for being so attracted to them are the very reasons why they end up not being able to have relationships with them. Aquarius is the sign of freedom, one of the four most independent signs, and they are stubborn about their need for freedom. People see a carefree spirit in Aquarius and it\u2019s like a rare jewel that they think they alone be the one to capture and hold onto. The thing is, you can\u2019t.</p><p>Even a committed Aquarius is going to disappear from time to time. If they have more grounding aspects in their chart, maybe you\u2019ll see more of them than other Aquas, but even in a committed, living together, see you every day type of relationship, they will need their space. They\u2019ll need a man or a woman cave to escape to where they can be alone and\u00a0\u201cfree\u201d for a bit. They can\u2019t stand being suffocated. Even in love. They really, really need someone who understands that, in order to be their best selves and to thrive.\u00a0</p><p>With all that being said, I would not say Harry is any different than the\u00a0\u201ctypical\u201d Aquarius even with his water house placements. He\u2019s going to continue to gravitate from place to place, because.. I mean, he can afford to, and that\u2019s the Aqua dream, really. You\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a person who can lock him down in one spot for good, even with his\u00a0\u201chomey\u201d 4th house energy. He finds home among his friends, among his established family (his real family plus anyone else he deems worthy to let in his tight inner circle), among the world. I say among the world, because throughout his life, he\u2019ll continue to find and collect\u00a0\u201cfamily\u201d in little places all over the globe, here and there, and he\u2019ll love them, and he\u2019ll make them his own and spend enough time to establish a connection, and then he\u2019ll disappear for a time, like all Aquas do, and he\u2019ll live his life free and do his thing and then at some point, he\u2019ll drift back their way again, appearing out of nowhere, to spend some time with them, and then he\u2019ll be gone again, and this will forever be his pattern.\u00a0</p><p>I liken all air signs, especially Aqua, to wind (and also lightning).

Harry would be no different in this. While he\u2019s with you, yes, you\u2019ll get to see his loving nature. You\u2019ll get to see the way he loves to cuddle and the way he loves to do things for others. You\u2019ll get to see all his 4th house energy in it\u2019s glory. You\u2019ll get to see his 12th house moon in it\u2019s gentle sensitivity, but.. the minute you start to think\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s mine, I can do with it what I will\u201d and you start to portray signs of excessive possessiveness or neediness is the moment you\u2019re going to get ghosted like you\u2019ve never experienced before in your life. Harry has a ton of concentrated Aquarius energy, remember? He\u2019s a <i>super </i>Aquarius (He has FOUR planets in the sign)<i>. </i>I would advise anyone who attempted a relationship with him to be very aware of this. It doesn\u2019t make him a bad person, at all. He\u2019s a <i>good</i>\u00a0person, but people put a lot of unrealistic expectations on Aquas based on the fact that they have in their head an idea of what a relationship should be, and people don\u2019t like accepting that sometimes, their ideas of what something should be is just plain out <i>wrong</i>. Aquarius are perfect the way they are. It\u2019s other people who can\u2019t just let them be that give them a bad name, in my experience and opinion.</p><p>How is Harry in a relationship? Based on his chart (and considering the breakdown I just gave up there ^ about the\u00a0\u201ctypical\u201d Aquarius personality), I would say he\u2019s lovable when respected for who he is. He will showcase all the good parts of his personality when he\u2019s given the freedom to do so. He\u2019ll be protective, a talker, he\u2019ll be a cuddler, a gentleman, funny, charismatic. There will be times where he\u2019s very serious, structured, easily annoyed (4th house character trait), probably a little too controlling (you\u2019d need to call him on his shit from time to time, and if you approach it in the name of fairness, he\u2019d get it, I think). He\u2019ll be emotionally distant sometimes (12th house moon trait). He can be a very deep, complex person, if given the right environment to showcase that side of himself. He\u2019ll be a bit teary about things. He\u2019d probably want a good cuddle when that happens. Don\u2019t be mistaken, though, in thinking he\u2019s going to want you all over him 24/7. When hurt, he\u2019ll showcase a hard shell that you\u2019d be hard pressed to crack, unless he lets you back into his inner world. I think it would probably take a lot to <i>really</i> hurt him to that point, but do keep in mind, underneath all this magesticness, he\u2019s a sensitive soul.\u00a0</p><p>His rising sign is the way that he portrays his whole chart. It\u2019s the outermost boundary that people see on the regular, and is what filters out the energy of the chart on the day to day. Being that he\u2019s a Libra rising, people are going to think he\u2019s very personable, very chill, and very given to being in relationships. These things are in keeping with his moon energy, although his moon energy is in his blind spot. He\u2019s a lover, for sure. And kinky. I think he\u2019d probably be pretty kinky with his 3rd house mars. He\u2019s going to do what pops in his mind to do, sexually. His body is very much lead by his thoughts. I\u2019m actually really glad he has Saturn conjunct his mercury. If he didn\u2019t, this man would be so all over the place, that no one would be able to keep up with him (sexually or otherwise).

He&rsquo;s a <i>good</i>&nbsp;person, but people put a lot of unrealistic expectations on Aquas based on the fact that they have in their head an idea of what a relationship should be, and people don&rsquo;t like accepting that sometimes, their ideas of what something should be is just plain out <i>wrong</i>. Aquarius are perfect the way they are. It&rsquo;s other people who can&rsquo;t just let them be that give them a bad name, in my experience and opinion.</p><p>How is Harry in a relationship? Based on his chart (and considering the breakdown I just gave up there ^ about the&nbsp;&ldquo;typical&rdquo; Aquarius personality), I would say he&rsquo;s lovable when respected for who he is. He will showcase all the good parts of his personality when he&rsquo;s given the freedom to do so. He&rsquo;ll be protective, a talker, he&rsquo;ll be a cuddler, a gentleman, funny, charismatic. There will be times where he&rsquo;s very serious, structured, easily annoyed (4th house character trait), probably a little too controlling (you&rsquo;d need to call him on his shit from time to time, and if you approach it in the name of fairness, he&rsquo;d get it, I think). He&rsquo;ll be emotionally distant sometimes (12th house moon trait). He can be a very deep, complex person, if given the right environment to showcase that side of himself. He&rsquo;ll be a bit teary about things. He&rsquo;d probably want a good cuddle when that happens. Don&rsquo;t be mistaken, though, in thinking he&rsquo;s going to want you all over him 24/7. When hurt, he&rsquo;ll showcase a hard shell that you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to crack, unless he lets you back into his inner world. I think it would probably take a lot to <i>really</i> hurt him to that point, but do keep in mind, underneath all this magesticness, he&rsquo;s a sensitive soul.&nbsp;</p><p>His rising sign is the way that he portrays his whole chart. It&rsquo;s the outermost boundary that people see on the regular, and is what filters out the energy of the chart on the day to day. Being that he&rsquo;s a Libra rising, people are going to think he&rsquo;s very personable, very chill, and very given to being in relationships. These things are in keeping with his moon energy, although his moon energy is in his blind spot. He&rsquo;s a lover, for sure. And kinky. I think he&rsquo;d probably be pretty kinky with his 3rd house mars. He&rsquo;s going to do what pops in his mind to do, sexually. His body is very much lead by his thoughts. I&rsquo;m actually really glad he has Saturn conjunct his mercury. If he didn&rsquo;t, this man would be so all over the place, that no one would be able to keep up with him (sexually or otherwise). As it is, Saturn at least helps to give him some structure of mind.&nbsp;</p><p>I think that about covers it, yeah?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",

As I opened my eyes, I squinted against the harsh, bright light and it took a few seconds for my eyesight to recover from the glaring lights. Something covered my nose and mouth and I pushed my hand across my face coming into contact with a piece of plastic. My eyes opened with a start and I glanced around the hospital room. The nurse turned around in response to my movements and adjusted my mask for me.<br/><br/>&ldquo;How are you feeling, Grace?&rdquo; she asked, her voice soothing and gentle. <br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; I asked, my voice hoarse and dry. I tried to sit up, but pain shot through my right side and I winced.<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; the nurse urged me, gently pushing me back down into a laying position. &ldquo;You were attacked, but you&rsquo;re safe now. The doctors have cleaned and stitched your wounds, you&rsquo;re going to be fine.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Is my mum here?&rdquo; I questioned, realising I was in the same hospital that she worked in. <br/><br/></p><p>The nurse nodded, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s right outside, I&rsquo;ll go and tell her you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>The nurse walked towards the door and exited the room, outside I could see my parents talking with a Police officer, my dad looked angry and frustrated as he argued with the officer. My mum glanced up at the sound of the door opening and rushed past the nurse to come inside. She was still dressed in her work scrubs, she must have been on shift when I came into hospital. She rushed to my bedside and leaned over, smoothing my hair back. <br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Oh Grace, Sweetheart, how are you feeling?&rdquo; she asked, her voice and face both full of concern. She gripped my hand with her other hand and squeezed it tightly. It was only then when I glanced down did I notice the bruising and cuts on my arm and the memory of what happened came flooding back. <br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;He came at me with a knife,&rdquo; I said, my voice coming out panicked and I wriggled around in my bed feeling myself overwhelmed with panic. <br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Sssh, sssh, Honey, the Police are out looking for the person who did this,&rdquo; she explained to me, soothing my hair backwards. &ldquo;The whole party was shut down, they think someone put drugs in the alcohol because we&rsquo;ve had so many people come into the emergency room tonight with the same drug in their system. The Police are investigating.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>My mum gave me a gentle smile and I knew she&rsquo;d been working on the shift when people from the party had started coming in. I knew she would&rsquo;ve been worried, waiting and hoping that I wasn&rsquo;t the next drugged person to come through the doors. Instead I was worse, I was the next person to be rushed to hospital for being stabbed multiple times. I saw Harry through the window outside my room, he was stood against the far wall watching me with my mum and I felt a wave of calm wash over me. <br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Mum,&rdquo; I croaked out and she looked at me with a smile, &ldquo;Can you send Harry in please? I need to speak to him.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Of course, sweetheart,&rdquo; she nodded and planted a kiss on my forehead before pushing herself away from the bed. <br/><br/></p><p>Mum left my room and I waited as she had a quick conversation with Harry outside. I watched as he spoke to her and glanced at the Police officers still speaking with my dad. I needed to know what had happened tonight, half of the campus had been drugged at the party and I&rsquo;d been attacked by a mysterious person in a mask.\u00a0</p><p>I knew it was Halloween, but I wasn&rsquo;t expected that much of a trick. <br/><br/></p><p>The door opened and Harry stepped inside. His face looked dirty from where he&rsquo;d quickly attempted to wash away what was left of his face paint, leaving blotches of black and white paint in his hairline and eyebrows and beneath his eyes. He closed the door behind him and slowly walked over to my bed. Images of him snapping the guys neck flashed through my mind and I shifted uneasily. <br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; He asked.<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Can everyone stop asking me that?&rdquo; I snapped at him and his head dropped. I winced as the anger caused pain to shoot through my side. &ldquo;I was stabbed multiple times and watched you snap someones neck, so yes I&rsquo;m absolutely brilliant, thanks for asking.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Sssh,&rdquo; Harry hushed, quickly moving to be next to my bed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kill the guy-&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You snapped his neck,&rdquo; I cut him off, arguing. Even though I&rsquo;d been drunk or drugged, I knew what I had seen. <br/><br/></p><p>Harry shook his head, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not dead.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What happened tonight?&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Someone drugged the fog machine which means that every single person at that party was under the effects of a dangerous drug. I don&rsquo;t know what the person who did this was planning, whether they wanted to hurt people or just some people No one will have any idea what happened and they&rsquo;re not going to remember anything,&rdquo; Harry explained, his voice was rough and low. <br/><br/></p><p>I turned my head to look at him accusingly, &ldquo;Like someone erased their memory.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; Harry pleaded, looking at me. &ldquo;I promise you I had nothing to do with this.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;The more I think about it, the more weird I think it is that the drugs didn&rsquo;t seem to have any effect on you or Niall. I guess some people will say we were lucky to have two people there to save the day and set off the fire alarms before something really bad could happen, but then I remember you saying that &lsquo;it&rsquo;s happening&rsquo; almost as though you knew it would. I also think it&rsquo;s weird how when the drugs started to kick in, neither of you were anywhere to be seen and even weirder still, you leave the room and then I&rsquo;m attacked.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I know how this looks,&rdquo; Harry began to explain himself, but I shook my head and he stopped. <br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I want an explanation or I want you to get out.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>Harry let out a shaky breath and turned, walking out of the room. I felt tears sting my eyes as I watched him close the door behind him. I felt betrayed and hurt by what had happened. My life had been put in danger and for what? There was no explanation or answer as to why some twisted individual would decide to drug an entire party full of students and run around the party with a knife and attack people, or was it just me who had been stabbed? <br/><br/></p><p>The door opened again and my mum poked her head inside the room and smiled, &ldquo;You have a visitor.&rdquo; She stepped to the side, allowing for Beth to wheel herself into the room.\u00a0</p><p>She was sat in a wheelchair, dressed in a hospital gown and a dressing gown and slippers. Her blonde hair was messily tied up in a bun on top of her head and she gave me a weak smile as she wheeled herself to my bedside.\u00a0</p><p>My mum smiled from the door, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you two some time to catch up and have a chat, if you need anything we&rsquo;ll be outside.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jane,&rdquo; Beth smiled back at my mum as she closed the door. Beth turned to look at me still smiling. She had a bruise on her left cheek and butterfly stitches stuck onto a small cut on her forehead. She giggled, &ldquo;You look awful.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, you don&rsquo;t look that great yourself,&rdquo; I replied with a small laugh and instantly regretted it when another pain stabbed my side. I winced and groaned, putting my hand on the area as I tried to shift in my bed. &ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;The same as almost everyone else at the party,&rdquo; she began explaining with a small shrug, &ldquo;I got caught up in the middle of a fight between a group of guys, almost everyone was fighting or punching someone. It was like fight night on steroids. Niall made me come into hospital and the doctors found like a thousand drugs in my system, they flushed me out and now I&rsquo;m just nursing a very big hangover. Nothing in comparison to you.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I found you passed out on the sofa at one point, I should&rsquo;ve got us both out of there,&rdquo; I said, remembering finding Beth sprawled out on the sofa. Memories of the guy in the mask watching me flashed through my mind and I shuddered. I turned to look at Beth, &ldquo;You were there when Harry came into the bathroom, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she nodded and kicked her feet up onto the edge of my bed. &ldquo;Harry had just come downstairs to help Niall find me, the last few people were leaving the party. Everyone was just so confused what was going on, the alarm and sprinklers were going off, it was absolute chaos. Harry found us, Niall was just giving me water trying to sober me up and that&rsquo;s when we heard you screaming. I&rsquo;ve never seen someone move as fast as Harry did.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What happened to the guy who was attacking me?&rdquo; I asked, wanting her to confirm that Harry had snapped his neck and that I wasn&rsquo;t going mad. <br/><br/></p><p>Beth shook her head, &ldquo;It all happened so fast and I was still drugged, I honestly couldn&rsquo;t tell you. From what I can remember, Harry punched the guy and kicked the knife away from him then he kind of threw him at Niall while Harry went to you. I feel bad because I just stood there, I didn&rsquo;t know what I could do, I&rsquo;d just seen my best friend being slashed with a knife by some creep in a mask, I went into shock.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;So Harry didn&rsquo;t kill him?&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I mean Harry throws a pretty solid punch,&rdquo; Beth joked with a small laugh, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think it was enough to kill the guy. Although a part of me wish it had been enough. Have you spoken to the Police yet?&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I shook my head and let out a sigh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what I would tell them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be coming in to talk to you anytime soon, your dad was shouting at them saying how you wouldn&rsquo;t be in the right frame of mind to revisit the events so soon,&rdquo; Beth explained and shrugged, &ldquo;He has a point.&rdquo;</p><p>I shuffled to a more comfortable seated position and winced every time pain shot through my side and huffed out in annoyance. I looked at Beth, &ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Have you noticed anything weird about Niall?&rdquo; I asked, knowing if anyone was going to tell me the truth it was going to be Beth.<br/><br/></p><p>She pursed her lips and thought for a few seconds before shaking her head, &ldquo;Not really, no. Do you mean like the fact he puts his milk in his tea first or that he&rsquo;s really loud in bed?&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>I let out a laugh and quickly winced at the pain in my side, shooting Beth a glare for making me laugh. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m just thinking too much about what happened, I just want answers.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>Beth nodded, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get some answers and the Police will find the person who did this, I&rsquo;ll make sure of it and I think it&rsquo;s safe to say your dad is going to make sure of it too.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br/><br/>It was another couple of days until I was allowed to leave the hospital. The doctors came in everyday to check my stitches and make sure I was fully recovering from the effects of the drugs. My dad had told me he&rsquo;d taken the time whilst I was in hospital to make sure the security and alarm system on our house was updated, so I felt safe in my own home.\u00a0</p><p>He&rsquo;d even installed cameras to all of the doors to make sure nothing could happen to me again. I wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure that it was all for my piece of mind, I guessed a lot of it was for his own sake. <br/><br/></p><p>Beth had been allowed to go home from hospital the same day that she&rsquo;d first come to visit me, but she had come back every day to bring me food and keep me updated with the gossip around campus and town. Apparently, I was a big talking point amongst the general gossip about the entire party being drugged and me, the helpless girl who had been cornered and stabbed multiple times. <br/><br/></p><p>The truth is, I&rsquo;d only been stabbed the once, on my side and it had missed all of my vital organs. The doctors praised me for putting up a fight and thrashing around, making it more difficult for my attacker to make an accurate aim for somewhere important that would&rsquo;ve caused a lot more damage. The rest of my injuries were cuts and slashes from where the knife had sliced the skin on my arms and one on my cheek. I was unfortunate to be the only one who had been attacked, but lucky to have survived. <br/><br/></p><p>My dad had finally allowed the Police to come in and interview me about what happened on my last day in hospital. Asking questions about anything they could use to identify the attacker, they&rsquo;d told me that the nurses had taken samples from me for identification when I was first brought into hospital and nothing had come up.\u00a0</p><p>All I was able to tell them was that the person was wearing a white mask and I assumed they were a male based on their body type and the strength they&rsquo;d had when holding me down. I had nothing else to go on, no voice, no facial features, not even a hair colour. <br/><br/></p><p>It was a huge relief when my mum helped me into the front seat of her Volvo 4x4, the car was familiar and the leather seats were so much more comfortable than the bed I had been laying in for the last few days. She drove home slowly, trying her best to avoid bumps and holes in the road. I groaned every time she was unable to miss it and a dull ache shot up my side.\u00a0</p><p>Once we got home, my younger brother came running out of the house to see me whilst my parents got my bags out of the boot. <br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Grace! I drew you a picture,&rdquo; Jake said, greeting me with a gentle hug. He handed me a piece of white paper with a drawing of what he had labelled as me and him with a dog in a field, surrounded by flowers. He was only eight, so the colouring went out of the lines and the writing was scribbled, but I loved it either way.<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jake! I love it,&rdquo; I told him and ruffled my hand in his hair. &ldquo;Do you want to come and help me stick it up in my room?&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; He cheered and grabbed the drawing from me before running back into the house ahead of me. <br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Grace, darling,&rdquo; my dad began talking, taking my arm and helping me up the small steps to our front door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hired someone to come and work for us for the next few weeks. She&rsquo;s going to be a housekeeper to help around the house whilst myself and your mother are working.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Someone to babysit me more like?&rdquo; I responded dryly, glancing up at him as though he didn&rsquo;t expect me to know what he was really doing. <br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only while you&rsquo;re recovering,&rdquo; he said, ignoring my protests. &ldquo;Your mother agrees with me that she could do with the help around the house if she&rsquo;s caring for you and I will be comforted knowing there&rsquo;s someone other than your brother in the house with you when we&rsquo;re both at work.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; I muttered and rolled my eyes.<br/><br/></p><p>I shuffled into the kitchen. I had to shuffle because walking properly was way too painful. I wanted food that wasn&rsquo;t served to me on a tray and pureed so I could swallow without the risk of choking and I wanted something cold and sugary to drink. My mum followed me into the kitchen, helping me by making my food and I stopped when I saw a huge bouquet of roses sitting in a glass vase on the counter. There was a small white envelope resting in the middle of the bouquet. <br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re for you,&rdquo; my mum explained as she gathered food items from the fridge to make me a sandwich. &ldquo;They arrived this morning.&rdquo;<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Who are they from?&rdquo; I asked, picking up the small envelope.<br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sweetheart. They were delivered by a company,&rdquo; she told me.<br/><br/></p><p>I slipped my nail underneath the flap of the envelope and ripped it open.\u00a0</p><p>There was a small white card inside and I pulled it out to read the embossed, silver writing:\u00a0<i>I&rsquo;m sorry, love H x</i>\n\n<br/></p>",

As I opened my eyes, I squinted against the harsh, bright light and it took a few seconds for my eyesight to recover from the glaring lights. Something covered my nose and mouth and I pushed my hand across my face coming into contact with a piece of plastic. My eyes opened with a start and I glanced around the hospital room. The nurse turned around in response to my movements and adjusted my mask for me.<br><br>\u201cHow are you feeling, Grace?\u201d she asked, her voice soothing and gentle. <br><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d I asked, my voice hoarse and dry. I tried to sit up, but pain shot through my right side and I winced.<br><br></p><p>\u201cTake it easy,\u201d the nurse urged me, gently pushing me back down into a laying position. \u201cYou were attacked, but you\u2019re safe now. The doctors have cleaned and stitched your wounds, you\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cIs my mum here?\u201d I questioned, realising I was in the same hospital that she worked in. <br><br></p><p>The nurse nodded, \u201cShe\u2019s right outside, I\u2019ll go and tell her you\u2019re awake.\u201d<br><br></p><p>The nurse walked towards the door and exited the room, outside I could see my parents talking with a Police officer, my dad looked angry and frustrated as he argued with the officer. My mum glanced up at the sound of the door opening and rushed past the nurse to come inside. She was still dressed in her work scrubs, she must have been on shift when I came into hospital. She rushed to my bedside and leaned over, smoothing my hair back. <br><br></p><p>\u201cOh Grace, Sweetheart, how are you feeling?\u201d she asked, her voice and face both full of concern. She gripped my hand with her other hand and squeezed it tightly. It was only then when I glanced down did I notice the bruising and cuts on my arm and the memory of what happened came flooding back. <br><br></p><p>\u201cHe came at me with a knife,\u201d I said, my voice coming out panicked and I wriggled around in my bed feeling myself overwhelmed with panic. <br><br></p><p>\u201cSssh, sssh, Honey, the Police are out looking for the person who did this,\u201d she explained to me, soothing my hair backwards. \u201cThe whole party was shut down, they think someone put drugs in the alcohol because we\u2019ve had so many people come into the emergency room tonight with the same drug in their system. The Police are investigating.\u201d<br><br></p><p>My mum gave me a gentle smile and I knew she\u2019d been working on the shift when people from the party had started coming in. I knew she would\u2019ve been worried, waiting and hoping that I wasn\u2019t the next drugged person to come through the doors. Instead I was worse, I was the next person to be rushed to hospital for being stabbed multiple times. I saw Harry through the window outside my room, he was stood against the far wall watching me with my mum and I felt a wave of calm wash over me. <br><br></p><p>\u201cMum,\u201d I croaked out and she looked at me with a smile, \u201cCan you send Harry in please? I need to speak to him.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cOf course, sweetheart,\u201d she nodded and planted a kiss on my forehead before pushing herself away from the bed. <br><br></p><p>Mum left my room and I waited as she had a quick conversation with Harry outside. I watched as he spoke to her and glanced at the Police officers still speaking with my dad. I needed to know what had happened tonight, half of the campus had been drugged at the party and I\u2019d been attacked by a mysterious person in a mask.\u00a0</p><p>I knew it was Halloween, but I wasn\u2019t expected that much of a trick. <br><br></p><p>The door opened and Harry stepped inside. His face looked dirty from where he\u2019d quickly attempted to wash away what was left of his face paint, leaving blotches of black and white paint in his hairline and eyebrows and beneath his eyes. He closed the door behind him and slowly walked over to my bed. Images of him snapping the guys neck flashed through my mind and I shifted uneasily. <br><br></p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d He asked.<br><br></p><p>\u201cCan everyone stop asking me that?\u201d I snapped at him and his head dropped. I winced as the anger caused pain to shoot through my side. \u201cI was stabbed multiple times and watched you snap someones neck, so yes I\u2019m absolutely brilliant, thanks for asking.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cSssh,\u201d Harry hushed, quickly moving to be next to my bed. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill the guy-\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cYou snapped his neck,\u201d I cut him off, arguing. Even though I\u2019d been drunk or drugged, I knew what I had seen. <br><br></p><p>Harry shook his head, \u201cHe\u2019s not dead.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened tonight?\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cSomeone drugged the fog machine which means that every single person at that party was under the effects of a dangerous drug.

Her blonde hair was messily tied up in a bun on top of her head and she gave me a weak smile as she wheeled herself to my bedside.\u00a0</p><p>My mum smiled from the door, \u201cI\u2019ll give you two some time to catch up and have a chat, if you need anything we\u2019ll be outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jane,\u201d Beth smiled back at my mum as she closed the door.

As I opened my eyes, I squinted against the harsh, bright light and it took a few seconds for my eyesight to recover from the glaring lights. Something covered my nose and mouth and I pushed my hand across my face coming into contact with a piece of plastic. My eyes opened with a start and I glanced around the hospital room. The nurse turned around in response to my movements and adjusted my mask for me.<br><br>\u201cHow are you feeling, Grace?\u201d she asked, her voice soothing and gentle. <br><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d I asked, my voice hoarse and dry. I tried to sit up, but pain shot through my right side and I winced.<br><br></p><p>\u201cTake it easy,\u201d the nurse urged me, gently pushing me back down into a laying position. \u201cYou were attacked, but you\u2019re safe now. The doctors have cleaned and stitched your wounds, you\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cIs my mum here?\u201d I questioned, realising I was in the same hospital that she worked in. <br><br></p><p>The nurse nodded, \u201cShe\u2019s right outside, I\u2019ll go and tell her you\u2019re awake.\u201d<br><br></p><p>The nurse walked towards the door and exited the room, outside I could see my parents talking with a Police officer, my dad looked angry and frustrated as he argued with the officer. My mum glanced up at the sound of the door opening and rushed past the nurse to come inside. She was still dressed in her work scrubs, she must have been on shift when I came into hospital. She rushed to my bedside and leaned over, smoothing my hair back. <br><br></p><p>\u201cOh Grace, Sweetheart, how are you feeling?\u201d she asked, her voice and face both full of concern. She gripped my hand with her other hand and squeezed it tightly. It was only then when I glanced down did I notice the bruising and cuts on my arm and the memory of what happened came flooding back. <br><br></p><p>\u201cHe came at me with a knife,\u201d I said, my voice coming out panicked and I wriggled around in my bed feeling myself overwhelmed with panic. <br><br></p><p>\u201cSssh, sssh, Honey, the Police are out looking for the person who did this,\u201d she explained to me, soothing my hair backwards. \u201cThe whole party was shut down, they think someone put drugs in the alcohol because we\u2019ve had so many people come into the emergency room tonight with the same drug in their system. The Police are investigating.\u201d<br><br></p><p>My mum gave me a gentle smile and I knew she\u2019d been working on the shift when people from the party had started coming in. I knew she would\u2019ve been worried, waiting and hoping that I wasn\u2019t the next drugged person to come through the doors. Instead I was worse, I was the next person to be rushed to hospital for being stabbed multiple times. I saw Harry through the window outside my room, he was stood against the far wall watching me with my mum and I felt a wave of calm wash over me. <br><br></p><p>\u201cMum,\u201d I croaked out and she looked at me with a smile, \u201cCan you send Harry in please? I need to speak to him.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cOf course, sweetheart,\u201d she nodded and planted a kiss on my forehead before pushing herself away from the bed. <br><br></p><p>Mum left my room and I waited as she had a quick conversation with Harry outside. I watched as he spoke to her and glanced at the Police officers still speaking with my dad. I needed to know what had happened tonight, half of the campus had been drugged at the party and I\u2019d been attacked by a mysterious person in a mask.\u00a0</p><p>I knew it was Halloween, but I wasn\u2019t expected that much of a trick. <br><br></p><p>The door opened and Harry stepped inside. His face looked dirty from where he\u2019d quickly attempted to wash away what was left of his face paint, leaving blotches of black and white paint in his hairline and eyebrows and beneath his eyes. He closed the door behind him and slowly walked over to my bed. Images of him snapping the guys neck flashed through my mind and I shifted uneasily. <br><br></p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d He asked.<br><br></p><p>\u201cCan everyone stop asking me that?\u201d I snapped at him and his head dropped. I winced as the anger caused pain to shoot through my side. \u201cI was stabbed multiple times and watched you snap someones neck, so yes I\u2019m absolutely brilliant, thanks for asking.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cSssh,\u201d Harry hushed, quickly moving to be next to my bed. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill the guy-\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cYou snapped his neck,\u201d I cut him off, arguing. Even though I\u2019d been drunk or drugged, I knew what I had seen. <br><br></p><p>Harry shook his head, \u201cHe\u2019s not dead.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened tonight?\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cSomeone drugged the fog machine which means that every single person at that party was under the effects of a dangerous drug. I don\u2019t know what the person who did this was planning, whether they wanted to hurt people or just some people No one will have any idea what happened and they\u2019re not going to remember anything,\u201d Harry explained, his voice was rough and low. <br><br></p><p>I turned my head to look at him accusingly, \u201cLike someone erased their memory.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d Harry pleaded, looking at me. \u201cI promise you I had nothing to do with this.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cThe more I think about it, the more weird I think it is that the drugs didn\u2019t seem to have any effect on you or Niall. I guess some people will say we were lucky to have two people there to save the day and set off the fire alarms before something really bad could happen, but then I remember you saying that \u2018it\u2019s happening\u2019 almost as though you knew it would. I also think it\u2019s weird how when the drugs started to kick in, neither of you were anywhere to be seen and even weirder still, you leave the room and then I\u2019m attacked.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cI know how this looks,\u201d Harry began to explain himself, but I shook my head and he stopped. <br><br></p><p>\u201cI want an explanation or I want you to get out.\u201d<br><br></p><p>Harry let out a shaky breath and turned, walking out of the room. I felt tears sting my eyes as I watched him close the door behind him. I felt betrayed and hurt by what had happened. My life had been put in danger and for what? There was no explanation or answer as to why some twisted individual would decide to drug an entire party full of students and run around the party with a knife and attack people, or was it just me who had been stabbed? <br><br></p><p>The door opened again and my mum poked her head inside the room and smiled, \u201cYou have a visitor.\u201d She stepped to the side, allowing for Beth to wheel herself into the room.\u00a0</p><p>She was sat in a wheelchair, dressed in a hospital gown and a dressing gown and slippers. Her blonde hair was messily tied up in a bun on top of her head and she gave me a weak smile as she wheeled herself to my bedside.\u00a0</p><p>My mum smiled from the door, \u201cI\u2019ll give you two some time to catch up and have a chat, if you need anything we\u2019ll be outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jane,\u201d Beth smiled back at my mum as she closed the door. Beth turned to look at me still smiling. She had a bruise on her left cheek and butterfly stitches stuck onto a small cut on her forehead. She giggled, \u201cYou look awful.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cThanks, you don\u2019t look that great yourself,\u201d I replied with a small laugh and instantly regretted it when another pain stabbed my side. I winced and groaned, putting my hand on the area as I tried to shift in my bed. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cThe same as almost everyone else at the party,\u201d she began explaining with a small shrug, \u201cI got caught up in the middle of a fight between a group of guys, almost everyone was fighting or punching someone. It was like fight night on steroids. Niall made me come into hospital and the doctors found like a thousand drugs in my system, they flushed me out and now I\u2019m just nursing a very big hangover. Nothing in comparison to you.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cI found you passed out on the sofa at one point, I should\u2019ve got us both out of there,\u201d I said, remembering finding Beth sprawled out on the sofa. Memories of the guy in the mask watching me flashed through my mind and I shuddered. I turned to look at Beth, \u201cYou were there when Harry came into the bathroom, weren\u2019t you?\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she nodded and kicked her feet up onto the edge of my bed. \u201cHarry had just come downstairs to help Niall find me, the last few people were leaving the party. Everyone was just so confused what was going on, the alarm and sprinklers were going off, it was absolute chaos. Harry found us, Niall was just giving me water trying to sober me up and that\u2019s when we heard you screaming. I\u2019ve never seen someone move as fast as Harry did.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the guy who was attacking me?\u201d I asked, wanting her to confirm that Harry had snapped his neck and that I wasn\u2019t going mad. <br><br></p><p>Beth shook her head, \u201cIt all happened so fast and I was still drugged, I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you. From what I can remember, Harry punched the guy and kicked the knife away from him then he kind of threw him at Niall while Harry went to you. I feel bad because I just stood there, I didn\u2019t know what I could do, I\u2019d just seen my best friend being slashed with a knife by some creep in a mask, I went into shock.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cSo Harry didn\u2019t kill him?\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cI mean Harry throws a pretty solid punch,\u201d Beth joked with a small laugh, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it was enough to kill the guy. Although a part of me wish it had been enough. Have you spoken to the Police yet?\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I shook my head and let out a sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what I would tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be coming in to talk to you anytime soon, your dad was shouting at them saying how you wouldn\u2019t be in the right frame of mind to revisit the events so soon,\u201d Beth explained and shrugged, \u201cHe has a point.\u201d</p><p>I shuffled to a more comfortable seated position and winced every time pain shot through my side and huffed out in annoyance. I looked at Beth, \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cHave you noticed anything weird about Niall?\u201d I asked, knowing if anyone was going to tell me the truth it was going to be Beth.<br><br></p><p>She pursed her lips and thought for a few seconds before shaking her head, \u201cNot really, no. Do you mean like the fact he puts his milk in his tea first or that he\u2019s really loud in bed?\u201d<br><br></p><p>I let out a laugh and quickly winced at the pain in my side, shooting Beth a glare for making me laugh. \u201cI think I\u2019m just thinking too much about what happened, I just want answers.\u201d<br><br></p><p>Beth nodded, \u201cWe\u2019ll get some answers and the Police will find the person who did this, I\u2019ll make sure of it and I think it\u2019s safe to say your dad is going to make sure of it too.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br><br>It was another couple of days until I was allowed to leave the hospital. The doctors came in everyday to check my stitches and make sure I was fully recovering from the effects of the drugs. My dad had told me he\u2019d taken the time whilst I was in hospital to make sure the security and alarm system on our house was updated, so I felt safe in my own home.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d even installed cameras to all of the doors to make sure nothing could happen to me again. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure that it was all for my piece of mind, I guessed a lot of it was for his own sake. <br><br></p><p>Beth had been allowed to go home from hospital the same day that she\u2019d first come to visit me, but she had come back every day to bring me food and keep me updated with the gossip around campus and town. Apparently, I was a big talking point amongst the general gossip about the entire party being drugged and me, the helpless girl who had been cornered and stabbed multiple times. <br><br></p><p>The truth is, I\u2019d only been stabbed the once, on my side and it had missed all of my vital organs. The doctors praised me for putting up a fight and thrashing around, making it more difficult for my attacker to make an accurate aim for somewhere important that would\u2019ve caused a lot more damage. The rest of my injuries were cuts and slashes from where the knife had sliced the skin on my arms and one on my cheek. I was unfortunate to be the only one who had been attacked, but lucky to have survived. <br><br></p><p>My dad had finally allowed the Police to come in and interview me about what happened on my last day in hospital. Asking questions about anything they could use to identify the attacker, they\u2019d told me that the nurses had taken samples from me for identification when I was first brought into hospital and nothing had come up.\u00a0</p><p>All I was able to tell them was that the person was wearing a white mask and I assumed they were a male based on their body type and the strength they\u2019d had when holding me down. I had nothing else to go on, no voice, no facial features, not even a hair colour. <br><br></p><p>It was a huge relief when my mum helped me into the front seat of her Volvo 4x4, the car was familiar and the leather seats were so much more comfortable than the bed I had been laying in for the last few days. She drove home slowly, trying her best to avoid bumps and holes in the road. I groaned every time she was unable to miss it and a dull ache shot up my side.\u00a0</p><p>Once we got home, my younger brother came running out of the house to see me whilst my parents got my bags out of the boot. <br><br></p><p>\u201cGrace! I drew you a picture,\u201d Jake said, greeting me with a gentle hug. He handed me a piece of white paper with a drawing of what he had labelled as me and him with a dog in a field, surrounded by flowers. He was only eight, so the colouring went out of the lines and the writing was scribbled, but I loved it either way.<br><br></p><p>\u201cThank you, Jake! I love it,\u201d I told him and ruffled my hand in his hair. \u201cDo you want to come and help me stick it up in my room?\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d He cheered and grabbed the drawing from me before running back into the house ahead of me. <br><br></p><p>\u201cGrace, darling,\u201d my dad began talking, taking my arm and helping me up the small steps to our front door. \u201cI\u2019ve hired someone to come and work for us for the next few weeks. She\u2019s going to be a housekeeper to help around the house whilst myself and your mother are working.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cSomeone to babysit me more like?\u201d I responded dryly, glancing up at him as though he didn\u2019t expect me to know what he was really doing. <br><br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only while you\u2019re recovering,\u201d he said, ignoring my protests. \u201cYour mother agrees with me that she could do with the help around the house if she\u2019s caring for you and I will be comforted knowing there\u2019s someone other than your brother in the house with you when we\u2019re both at work.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I muttered and rolled my eyes.<br><br></p><p>I shuffled into the kitchen. I had to shuffle because walking properly was way too painful. I wanted food that wasn\u2019t served to me on a tray and pureed so I could swallow without the risk of choking and I wanted something cold and sugary to drink. My mum followed me into the kitchen, helping me by making my food and I stopped when I saw a huge bouquet of roses sitting in a glass vase on the counter. There was a small white envelope resting in the middle of the bouquet. <br><br></p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re for you,\u201d my mum explained as she gathered food items from the fridge to make me a sandwich. \u201cThey arrived this morning.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cWho are they from?\u201d I asked, picking up the small envelope.<br><br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, sweetheart. They were delivered by a company,\u201d she told me.<br><br></p><p>I slipped my nail underneath the flap of the envelope and ripped it open.\u00a0</p><p>There was a small white card inside and I pulled it out to read the embossed, silver writing:\u00a0<i>I\u2019m sorry, love H x</i>\n\n<br></p>",

I saw Harry through the window outside my room, he was stood against the far wall watching me with my mum and I felt a wave of calm wash over me. <br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mum,&rdquo; I croaked out and she looked at me with a smile, &ldquo;Can you send Harry in please? I need to speak to him.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course, sweetheart,&rdquo; she nodded and planted a kiss on my forehead before pushing herself away from the bed. <br /><br /></p><p>Mum left my room and I waited as she had a quick conversation with Harry outside. I watched as he spoke to her and glanced at the Police officers still speaking with my dad. I needed to know what had happened tonight, half of the campus had been drugged at the party and I&rsquo;d been attacked by a mysterious person in a mask.&nbsp;</p><p>I knew it was Halloween, but I wasn&rsquo;t expected that much of a trick. <br /><br /></p><p>The door opened and Harry stepped inside. His face looked dirty from where he&rsquo;d quickly attempted to wash away what was left of his face paint, leaving blotches of black and white paint in his hairline and eyebrows and beneath his eyes. He closed the door behind him and slowly walked over to my bed. Images of him snapping the guys neck flashed through my mind and I shifted uneasily. <br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; He asked.<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Can everyone stop asking me that?&rdquo; I snapped at him and his head dropped. I winced as the anger caused pain to shoot through my side. &ldquo;I was stabbed multiple times and watched you snap someones neck, so yes I&rsquo;m absolutely brilliant, thanks for asking.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sssh,&rdquo; Harry hushed, quickly moving to be next to my bed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kill the guy-&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You snapped his neck,&rdquo; I cut him off, arguing. Even though I&rsquo;d been drunk or drugged, I knew what I had seen. <br /><br /></p><p>Harry shook his head, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not dead.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What happened tonight?&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Someone drugged the fog machine which means that every single person at that party was under the effects of a dangerous drug. I don&rsquo;t know what the person who did this was planning, whether they wanted to hurt people or just some people No one will have any idea what happened and they&rsquo;re not going to remember anything,&rdquo; Harry explained, his voice was rough and low. <br /><br /></p><p>I turned my head to look at him accusingly, &ldquo;Like someone erased their memory.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; Harry pleaded, looking at me. &ldquo;I promise you I had nothing to do with this.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;The more I think about it, the more weird I think it is that the drugs didn&rsquo;t seem to have any effect on you or Niall. I guess some people will say we were lucky to have two people there to save the day and set off the fire alarms before something really bad could happen, but then I remember you saying that &lsquo;it&rsquo;s happening&rsquo; almost as though you knew it would. I also think it&rsquo;s weird how when the drugs started to kick in, neither of you were anywhere to be seen and even weirder still, you leave the room and then I&rsquo;m attacked.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know how this looks,&rdquo; Harry began to explain himself, but I shook my head and he stopped. <br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I want an explanation or I want you to get out.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>Harry let out a shaky breath and turned, walking out of the room. I felt tears sting my eyes as I watched him close the door behind him. I felt betrayed and hurt by what had happened. My life had been put in danger and for what? There was no explanation or answer as to why some twisted individual would decide to drug an entire party full of students and run around the party with a knife and attack people, or was it just me who had been stabbed? <br /><br /></p><p>The door opened again and my mum poked her head inside the room and smiled, &ldquo;You have a visitor.&rdquo; She stepped to the side, allowing for Beth to wheel herself into the room.&nbsp;</p><p>She was sat in a wheelchair, dressed in a hospital gown and a dressing gown and slippers. Her blonde hair was messily tied up in a bun on top of her head and she gave me a weak smile as she wheeled herself to my bedside.&nbsp;</p><p>My mum smiled from the door, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you two some time to catch up and have a chat, if you need anything we&rsquo;ll be outside.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jane,&rdquo; Beth smiled back at my mum as she closed the door. Beth turned to look at me still smiling. She had a bruise on her left cheek and butterfly stitches stuck onto a small cut on her forehead. She giggled, &ldquo;You look awful.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, you don&rsquo;t look that great yourself,&rdquo; I replied with a small laugh and instantly regretted it when another pain stabbed my side. I winced and groaned, putting my hand on the area as I tried to shift in my bed. &ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;The same as almost everyone else at the party,&rdquo; she began explaining with a small shrug, &ldquo;I got caught up in the middle of a fight between a group of guys, almost everyone was fighting or punching someone. It was like fight night on steroids. Niall made me come into hospital and the doctors found like a thousand drugs in my system, they flushed me out and now I&rsquo;m just nursing a very big hangover. Nothing in comparison to you.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I found you passed out on the sofa at one point, I should&rsquo;ve got us both out of there,&rdquo; I said, remembering finding Beth sprawled out on the sofa. Memories of the guy in the mask watching me flashed through my mind and I shuddered. I turned to look at Beth, &ldquo;You were there when Harry came into the bathroom, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she nodded and kicked her feet up onto the edge of my bed. &ldquo;Harry had just come downstairs to help Niall find me, the last few people were leaving the party. Everyone was just so confused what was going on, the alarm and sprinklers were going off, it was absolute chaos. Harry found us, Niall was just giving me water trying to sober me up and that&rsquo;s when we heard you screaming. I&rsquo;ve never seen someone move as fast as Harry did.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What happened to the guy who was attacking me?&rdquo; I asked, wanting her to confirm that Harry had snapped his neck and that I wasn&rsquo;t going mad. <br /><br /></p><p>Beth shook her head, &ldquo;It all happened so fast and I was still drugged, I honestly couldn&rsquo;t tell you. From what I can remember, Harry punched the guy and kicked the knife away from him then he kind of threw him at Niall while Harry went to you. I feel bad because I just stood there, I didn&rsquo;t know what I could do, I&rsquo;d just seen my best friend being slashed with a knife by some creep in a mask, I went into shock.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;So Harry didn&rsquo;t kill him?&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I mean Harry throws a pretty solid punch,&rdquo; Beth joked with a small laugh, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think it was enough to kill the guy. Although a part of me wish it had been enough. Have you spoken to the Police yet?&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I shook my head and let out a sigh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what I would tell them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be coming in to talk to you anytime soon, your dad was shouting at them saying how you wouldn&rsquo;t be in the right frame of mind to revisit the events so soon,&rdquo; Beth explained and shrugged, &ldquo;He has a point.&rdquo;</p><p>I shuffled to a more comfortable seated position and winced every time pain shot through my side and huffed out in annoyance. I looked at Beth, &ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Have you noticed anything weird about Niall?&rdquo; I asked, knowing if anyone was going to tell me the truth it was going to be Beth.<br /><br /></p><p>She pursed her lips and thought for a few seconds before shaking her head, &ldquo;Not really, no. Do you mean like the fact he puts his milk in his tea first or that he&rsquo;s really loud in bed?&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>I let out a laugh and quickly winced at the pain in my side, shooting Beth a glare for making me laugh. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m just thinking too much about what happened, I just want answers.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>Beth nodded, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get some answers and the Police will find the person who did this, I&rsquo;ll make sure of it and I think it&rsquo;s safe to say your dad is going to make sure of it too.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br /><br />It was another couple of days until I was allowed to leave the hospital. The doctors came in everyday to check my stitches and make sure I was fully recovering from the effects of the drugs. My dad had told me he&rsquo;d taken the time whilst I was in hospital to make sure the security and alarm system on our house was updated, so I felt safe in my own home.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;d even installed cameras to all of the doors to make sure nothing could happen to me again. I wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure that it was all for my piece of mind, I guessed a lot of it was for his own sake. <br /><br /></p><p>Beth had been allowed to go home from hospital the same day that she&rsquo;d first come to visit me, but she had come back every day to bring me food and keep me updated with the gossip around campus and town. Apparently, I was a big talking point amongst the general gossip about the entire party being drugged and me, the helpless girl who had been cornered and stabbed multiple times. <br /><br /></p><p>The truth is, I&rsquo;d only been stabbed the once, on my side and it had missed all of my vital organs. The doctors praised me for putting up a fight and thrashing around, making it more difficult for my attacker to make an accurate aim for somewhere important that would&rsquo;ve caused a lot more damage. The rest of my injuries were cuts and slashes from where the knife had sliced the skin on my arms and one on my cheek. I was unfortunate to be the only one who had been attacked, but lucky to have survived. <br /><br /></p><p>My dad had finally allowed the Police to come in and interview me about what happened on my last day in hospital. Asking questions about anything they could use to identify the attacker, they&rsquo;d told me that the nurses had taken samples from me for identification when I was first brought into hospital and nothing had come up.&nbsp;</p><p>All I was able to tell them was that the person was wearing a white mask and I assumed they were a male based on their body type and the strength they&rsquo;d had when holding me down. I had nothing else to go on, no voice, no facial features, not even a hair colour. <br /><br /></p><p>It was a huge relief when my mum helped me into the front seat of her Volvo 4x4, the car was familiar and the leather seats were so much more comfortable than the bed I had been laying in for the last few days. She drove home slowly, trying her best to avoid bumps and holes in the road. I groaned every time she was unable to miss it and a dull ache shot up my side.&nbsp;</p><p>Once we got home, my younger brother came running out of the house to see me whilst my parents got my bags out of the boot. <br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Grace! I drew you a picture,&rdquo; Jake said, greeting me with a gentle hug. He handed me a piece of white paper with a drawing of what he had labelled as me and him with a dog in a field, surrounded by flowers. He was only eight, so the colouring went out of the lines and the writing was scribbled, but I loved it either way.<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jake! I love it,&rdquo; I told him and ruffled my hand in his hair. &ldquo;Do you want to come and help me stick it up in my room?&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; He cheered and grabbed the drawing from me before running back into the house ahead of me. <br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Grace, darling,&rdquo; my dad began talking, taking my arm and helping me up the small steps to our front door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hired someone to come and work for us for the next few weeks. She&rsquo;s going to be a housekeeper to help around the house whilst myself and your mother are working.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Someone to babysit me more like?&rdquo; I responded dryly, glancing up at him as though he didn&rsquo;t expect me to know what he was really doing. <br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only while you&rsquo;re recovering,&rdquo; he said, ignoring my protests. &ldquo;Your mother agrees with me that she could do with the help around the house if she&rsquo;s caring for you and I will be comforted knowing there&rsquo;s someone other than your brother in the house with you when we&rsquo;re both at work.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; I muttered and rolled my eyes.<br /><br /></p><p>I shuffled into the kitchen. I had to shuffle because walking properly was way too painful. I wanted food that wasn&rsquo;t served to me on a tray and pureed so I could swallow without the risk of choking and I wanted something cold and sugary to drink. My mum followed me into the kitchen, helping me by making my food and I stopped when I saw a huge bouquet of roses sitting in a glass vase on the counter. There was a small white envelope resting in the middle of the bouquet. <br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re for you,&rdquo; my mum explained as she gathered food items from the fridge to make me a sandwich. &ldquo;They arrived this morning.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who are they from?&rdquo; I asked, picking up the small envelope.<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sweetheart. They were delivered by a company,&rdquo; she told me.<br /><br /></p><p>I slipped my nail underneath the flap of the envelope and ripped it open.&nbsp;</p><p>There was a small white card inside and I pulled it out to read the embossed, silver writing:&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;m sorry, love H x</i>\n\n<br /></p>",

A light pink tint coats your cheeks and his dimples deepen, his grin growing wider once he realises what his words can do to you. </p><p>You were laid on Anne&rsquo;s couch, your head rested on Harry&rsquo;s chest with your legs tangled together in a jumbled mess. The television was on, although none of you were paying much attention to it, playing an episode of &lsquo;How I Met Your Mother&rsquo;. Anne&rsquo;s house was home to Harry, regardless of you both having your own house together, and it was quite honestly home to you too. It felt cosy and Anne did everything possible to make sure that you were both comfortable and at ease in the confinement of her home. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you ever think we&rsquo;re going to have a home like this someday?&rdquo; You asked and Harry&rsquo;s attention towards you perked, his fingers gently running through your hair.</p><p>&ldquo;We have a home, baby.&rdquo; He murmurs, his eyebrows furrowing as a line formed between them. &ldquo;You want to move into a house like my mums?&rdquo; You laugh, gently moving to sit comfortably, facing Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;No, although it&rsquo;s lovely, that&rsquo;s not what I meant.&rdquo; He props himself up on his elbows, his crucifix necklace resting on his tattooed chest. &ldquo;I mean a cosy family home, where every relation just comes for a few days to take a breather from the world. Do you think our home will be a safe place?&rdquo; Your ramble tumbles from your lips almost poetically to Harry, his admiration for you, and your future together, swelling in his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course it will be.&rdquo; He smiles, pulling you to straddle him. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m very excited for it to become that way.&rdquo; He reaches for your hand, kissing the back of it feebly. &ldquo;I know we haven&rsquo;t done anything major to kickstart our long, long life together,&rdquo; he exclaims dramatically. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;ll all happen. Don&rsquo;t doubt that for a second.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never have.&rdquo; You grin, leaning forward to press a short kiss onto his awaiting lips. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to agree though, your wedding suit has to be the most phenomenal one you&rsquo;ve ever worn.&rdquo; You laugh, Harry chuckling along as he nods in agreement.</p><p>&ldquo;You bet it will be.&rdquo; He pulls you into his chest, your head resting in the crook of his neck. &ldquo;You know what I can&rsquo;t wait for? To see how cute our babies are going to be.&rdquo; His stomach flutters at the mention of something he&rsquo;s been pondering for a while, your heart skipping a beat.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait either.&rdquo; You reply, pressing a gentle kiss to the skin on his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum, I don&rsquo;t know whether to be sick or to cry at how cute they are.&rdquo; Gemma whispers in a conflicted tone, both of them huddled just outside the livingroom door. </p><p>&ldquo;Gem,&rdquo; Anne starts. &ldquo;I really think she&rsquo;s the one.&rdquo; She grins, pulling Gemma away from the livingroom as the talking dies down. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we just eavesdropped on Harry and Y/N.&rdquo; Anne tuts and rolls her eyes at Gemma. </p><p>&ldquo;It was all for good cause! Just making sure my son is happy.&rdquo; She says, filling up the kettle. &ldquo;Although, I knew that already. I just like being nosy.&rdquo; Anne chuckles, Gemma joining in as she shakes her head at her mum.</p><p>-x</p>",
