S8 could be as good as the earlier seasons, but if they show Arya randomly leaving Westeros or continuing with FM crap or just being someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;sword&rdquo; I think that could be a season ruiner.  Like just the thought of any of that makes me want to scream mainly because it could also be seen as book!Canon up until the end of the book series which is beyond frustrating.  I for one don&rsquo;t trust d&amp;d to stay with Arya&rsquo;s book endgame since so much of her story has already been changed.  I just don&rsquo;t look forward to the headache so I&rsquo;m crossing my fingers and praying to the old gods and R'hollor that my fears are for naught.</p>",

There\u2019s a bit of a \u201cNoah\u2019s arch\u201d aspect to Arya\u2019s journey through the Riverland: it rains and rains and rains, and Yoren\u2019s wagons are \u201c<i>large enough to hold half the animals in the town</i>\u201d (ARYA, ACOK). At some point, water and fire come together: \u201c<i>On the night of their escape, the flames of the burning town had shimmered so brightly on the water that it had seemed that the lake was afire</i>\u201d (ARYA, ACOK). Like water, fire is cleansing and allows rebirth.

A few lantern bugs were coming out, their little lights blinking on and off. The green water was warm as tears, but there was no salt in it. It tasted of summer and mud and growing things. Arya plunged her face down into it to wash off the dust and dirt and sweat of the day. When she leaned back the trickles ran down the back of her neck and under her collar. They felt good.

However, like Daenerys, Arya is ultimately reborn in fire, not water. The scene where Arya return inside the burning barn to save Jaqen H\u2019ghar has some striking similarities to the one where Dany step into the pyre:</p><p><i>And there came a second crack, loud and sharp as thunder, and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted, the logs exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts.</i> \u2013 Dany, AGOT</p><p><i>Arya was running, coughing. She heard the steel crash through the old wood, and again, again. An instant later came a crack as loud as thunder, and the bottom of the wagon came ripping loose in an explosion of splinters.</i> \u2013 Arya, ACOK</p><p>And afterward, when Arya rushes into the tunnel to escape the barn, the scene is described in an ambiguous way, almost like she was a newborn leaving the womb:</p><p><i>Arya rolled headfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet. She got dirt in her mouth but she didn\u2019t care, the taste was fine, the taste was mud and water and worms and life. Under the earth the air was cool and dark. Above was nothing but blood and roaring red and choking smoke and the screams of dying horses. She moved her belt around so Needle would not be in her way, and began to crawl. A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound, like the roar of some monstrous beast, and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up behind her, smelling of hell. Arya held her breath and kissed the mud on the floor of the tunnel and cried. For whom, she could not say.</i> \u2013 Arya, ACOK</p><p>Of course, there\u2019s a lot to unravel here: Dany hatches three dragons; Arya frees three men from the wagon. One of these men is Jaqen H\u2019ghar, who, much like dragons, is linked to eastern magic. Arya rolls \u201cheadfirst into the tunnel\u201d (babies usually come out headfirst of their mother\u2019s \u201ctunnel\u201d) and, like an infant, starts to crawl (\u201cshe moved her belt around (\u2026) and began to crawl\u201d). The earth itself is a bit of a mother\u2019s womb, dark and safe and damp. All the while, above Arya\u2019s head, the burning barn might\u2019ve as well hatched a dragon of its own (the roar of the \u201cmonstrous beast\u201d and the \u201chot smoke and black dust\u201d). Soon after, she starts having warg dreams. She finds her pack and start cleaning up, dragging the \u201crot\u201d out of the water (it\u2019s implied that is was Nymeria who found Catelyn\u2019s body in the river). Arya\u2019s warg business in the Riverland mirror Dany\u2019s in Essos: flood, clean up, start anew. Burn, clean up, start anew. It\u2019s messy, it\u2019s dangerous, but fire cannot kill Daenerys Stormborn and the wild cannot kill Arya Stark.</p>",

She finds her pack and start cleaning up, dragging the \u201crot\u201d out of the water (it\u2019s implied that is was Nymeria who found Catelyn\u2019s body in the river). Arya\u2019s warg business in the Riverland mirror Dany\u2019s in Essos: flood, clean up, start anew. Burn, clean up, start anew.
