Katsuki watched from his seat, tucked away behind a screen Yaoyorozu had decorated the lobby with.

But then she\u2019d managed on her own and it was too late to say anything about it. She wouldn\u2019t be long, he\u2019d thought. He\u2019d just wait it out. And then suddenly it was curfew and every fibre of his being was itching\u2014exploding\u2014to leave.\u00a0</p><p>In the end, Katsuki just couldn\u2019t bring himself to go. An out of body experience, one might say, or a genuine desire not to be labelled a pervert like that stupid Mineta. It didn\u2019t matter how beautiful the girls in class were, they wanted to be heroes just like him. He valued strength, not appearance. They were rivals and equals and everything in between. Nothing more; nothing less.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>But, seriously, why <i>was </i>she training alone after curfew? Embarrassment or dedication? And in those little shorts, too. Was she determined to catch a damn cold?</p><p><i>Ugh,</i> Katsuki didn\u2019t care. He just wanted her to leave so he could go to bed. He was exhausted from tutoring Kirishima and yelling at Deku most of the day. He didn\u2019t feel like arguing with or humiliating Uraraka by showing his face right now. Not even Katsuki had that kind of stamina left in him.\u00a0</p><p>Closing the book in his lap, Katsuki slouched in his seat, legs propped up on an abandoned table. He could see Uraraka through the slits in the wooden screen. Wiping her forehead, she took a loud breath and readied a new stance. Her combat training with Gunhead was really paying off. Though she didn\u2019t yet seem to appreciate it, Uraraka had created a great opportunity to expand on her impressive quirk. Combat allowed her to get in close when necessary, providing better opportunities for touch. She just needed a little confidence.\u00a0</p><p>Sliding her left leg back, Uraraka prepared another kick. She\u2019d been practising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014and struggling\u2014with the same move for a while now. Extending one hand in front of her face, she bounced her back leg, built up a momentum, and then threw it in a clockwise arc. Her stance was too short. The kick struck her open palm, but without the proper stance, Uraraka lost balance quickly. To Katsuki\u2019s surprise, his ever-cheerful classmate let out a low but distinctive curse.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t watch this anymore.</p><p>\u201cYour stance is too short,\u201d he said, peeking out from behind the screen.</p><p>Uraraka screeched like a cartoon mouse baited into a trap. She covered her face to defend against the embarrassment. Katsuki rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cB-Bakugou, when did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, stepping out from behind the screen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She lowered her hands.</p><p>Katsuki cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ve been here the whole time\u2026\u201d</p><p>Realisation dawned on Uraraka like clouds encompassing the sun. The light faded in her eyes, replaced by sheer horror.</p><p>Katsuki offered his hand. She stared long and hard, as though assessing the danger of his palm, and then finally she took it. Once back to her feet, Uraraka\u2019s embarrassment faded, replaced by her usual smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, gesturing to the empty space in front of him. \u201cStand with your back to me.\u201d</p><p>\n\nUraraka blinked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you waitin\u2019 for, a coronation?? Move it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cR-right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow ready your stance.\u201d</p><p>Positioned in front of him, Uraraka slid her left leg back until their heels were in line with each other. Katsuki adjusted her hips, straightening her form until her upper body faced the opposing window. Slowly, taking care not to act inappropriately, Katsuki then pulled Uraraka\u2019s leg towards him, lengthening her stance. He kicked the inside of her heel, widening the distance between her feet.</p><p>\u201cTurn your feet,\u201d he said, patting her leg.\u00a0\u201cPoint your toes outward for balance.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Uraraka did as she was told.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Circling around her, Katsuki held up his hand as though offering a handshake. Her new target. \u201cNow kick me.\u201d</p><p>Uraraka chewed her lip. \u201cAre you\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cKick me, damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere I go! Get ready!\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the determination he\u2019d witnessed during the Sports Festival. Adrenaline rushed through him in sparks of anticipation.\u00a0</p><p>Wait\u2014why were her eyes <i>closed</i>?\u00a0</p><p>Uraraka\u2019s leg came hard, passing Katsuki\u2019s hand and cracking him in the temple. He smashed into the ground, disorientated, a thousand tiny Deku\u2019s floating obnoxiously around his face. Uraraka appeared in his vision, flushed with apologies.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Bakugou!\u201d</p><p>Without thinking, Katsuki reached out for help. She yanked him to his feet\u2014and off them. Katsuki hurtled sideways and upside down. Ah, <i>shit.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cHang on! I\u2019ll fix this!\u201d she yelled.\u00a0</p><p>Before she could end the effects of her quirk, Katsuki kicked off the ceiling, propelling himself right towards her. She opened her arms to catch him. To his surprise, Uraraka took the brunt of his weight, barely staggering backwards. The effects lifted, and Katsuki landed safely on his feet.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He blinked, trying to centre the room around him. Damn it all, his head hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he snapped.\u00a0\u201cWho closes their eyes during a training session?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-sorry! I got a little excited&hellip;\u201d</p><p><i>Excited?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. Do better next time.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNext time?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cTomorrow. We\u2019ll meet again tomorrow.\u201d<br/></p><p>Uraraka\u2019s eyes lit up, that same smile widening until it hurt his cheeks to look at it. Katsuki\u2019s heart gave a long and nauseating leap.\u00a0</p><p>He squeezed her shoulder. \u201cThat was a damn good kick,\u201d he praised. \u201cMy head is spinning.\u201d</p><p>Uraraka\u2019s face ignited like fireworks, those pink cheeks glowing with an amalgam of embarrassment and pride. She rubbed the back of her head, still grinning without a care in the world.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s give it one more try,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p><p>Still grinning, Uraraka stepped back into place. Katsuki stated at her, caught in the trance of his own rapid heartbeat. She was glowing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best!\u201d</p><p>Katsuki now knew what they meant by \u201cseeing stars\u201d.</p>",

Not even Katsuki had that kind of stamina left in him.\u00a0</p><p>Closing the book in his lap, Katsuki slouched in his seat, legs propped up on an abandoned table. He could see Uraraka through the slits in the wooden screen. Wiping her forehead, she took a loud breath and readied a new stance. Her combat training with Gunhead was really paying off. Though she didn\u2019t yet seem to appreciate it, Uraraka had created a great opportunity to expand on her impressive quirk.

Extending one hand in front of her face, she bounced her back leg, built up a momentum, and then threw it in a clockwise arc. Her stance was too short. The kick struck her open palm, but without the proper stance, Uraraka lost balance quickly. To Katsuki\u2019s surprise, his ever-cheerful classmate let out a low but distinctive curse.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t watch this anymore.</p><p>\u201cYour stance is too short,\u201d he said, peeking out from behind the screen.</p><p>Uraraka screeched like a cartoon mouse baited into a trap.

Katsuki adjusted her hips, straightening her form until her upper body faced the opposing window. Slowly, taking care not to act inappropriately, Katsuki then pulled Uraraka\u2019s leg towards him, lengthening her stance. He kicked the inside of her heel, widening the distance between her feet.</p><p>\u201cTurn your feet,\u201d he said, patting her leg.\u00a0\u201cPoint your toes outward for balance.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Uraraka did as she was told.\u00a0<br></p><p>Circling around her, Katsuki held up his hand as though offering a handshake.

He smashed into the ground, disorientated, a thousand tiny Deku\u2019s floating obnoxiously around his face. Uraraka appeared in his vision, flushed with apologies.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Bakugou!\u201d</p><p>Without thinking, Katsuki reached out for help. She yanked him to his feet\u2014and off them. Katsuki hurtled sideways and upside down. Ah, <i>shit.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cHang on! I\u2019ll fix this!\u201d she yelled.\u00a0</p><p>Before she could end the effects of her quirk, Katsuki kicked off the ceiling, propelling himself right towards her.

The effects lifted, and Katsuki landed safely on his feet.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He blinked, trying to centre the room around him.

Katsuki&rsquo;s heart gave a long and nauseating leap.&nbsp;</p><p>He squeezed her shoulder. &ldquo;That was a damn good kick,&rdquo; he praised. &ldquo;My head is spinning.&rdquo;</p><p>Uraraka&rsquo;s face ignited like fireworks, those pink cheeks glowing with an amalgam of embarrassment and pride. She rubbed the back of her head, still grinning without a care in the world.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give it one more try,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Still grinning, Uraraka stepped back into place. Katsuki stated at her, caught in the trance of his own rapid heartbeat. She was glowing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best!&rdquo;</p><p>Katsuki now knew what they meant by &ldquo;seeing stars&rdquo;.</p></p>",

Katsuki watched from his seat, tucked away behind a screen Yaoyorozu had decorated the lobby with. In order to make space, Uraraka had moved furniture, expanding the area to create a safe distance for combat. It was never his intention to hide, she&rsquo;d simply overlooked him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In hindsight, Katsuki could have offered a hand, probably sped up the process. But then she&rsquo;d managed on her own and it was too late to say anything about it. She wouldn&rsquo;t be long, he&rsquo;d thought. He&rsquo;d just wait it out. And then suddenly it was curfew and every fibre of his being was itching&mdash;exploding&mdash;to leave.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the end, Katsuki just couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to go. An out of body experience, one might say, or a genuine desire not to be labelled a pervert like that stupid Mineta. It didn&rsquo;t matter how beautiful the girls in class were, they wanted to be heroes just like him. He valued strength, not appearance. They were rivals and equals and everything in between. Nothing more; nothing less.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",
