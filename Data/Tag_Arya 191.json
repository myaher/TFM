I\u2019ll start by saying that all three characters go through hell and none of them deserve what they endure. They\u2019re all strong. They\u2019re all fascinating characters. It\u2019s possible to praise any or all of them without hating on any other characters.\u00a0</p><p>Its also important to note that asserting that Arya and Dany could have survived what Sansa went through is not a slight on Sansa.
