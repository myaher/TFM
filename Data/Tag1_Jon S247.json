You\u2019ll break my soul.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cBut you know?\u201d He looked up at the moon, at the stars, at the trees, freed from their weight, waving in the wind. \u201cI\u2019ll let you!\u201d He started yelling now. \u201cBecause those few moments, those few kisses, those nights\u2026.\u201d He licked his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s all worth it.\u201d</p><p>A warm hand rested on his back. Her hip touched his. He didn\u2019t know how long she sat there already. Strangely enough he had not seen or felt her coming. But at least he had thrown the truth out and it seemed that she had heard it.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow\u2026\u201d Sansa pressed the palm of her hand to his cheek and turned his face so he was forced to look at her. \u201cHow many times do I need to kiss you to prove that I\u2019m not going anywhere? How often do I need to hold you tightly until the sun rises in the morning to show that I\u2019m here to stay? Which I love you do you think was a lie?\u201d</p><p>Jon stretched out his hand and reached for a strand of bright red hair, twirling it between his fingers and looking at it as if it was the prettiest thing he had had ever seen. \u201cMore often than is possible.\u201d Jon tried to avoid her glance, but he was failing hopelessly. \u201cI\u2019m not good enough, Sansa. I\u2019ve never been and I\u2019ll never be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d Sansa raised her voice and cupped his face before she pressed her lips firmly on his. \u201cYou\u2019re better than good enough! You\u2019ve always been and you\u2019ll always be! I don\u2019t know who made you believe you\u2019re less than anyone else, and if I\u2019ll ever see or meet them they won\u2019t survive to tell you again, but they were wrong.\u201d She paused for a moment and one of her hands went through his hair. \u201cI know that if any other girl would have gotten your love, I\u2019d be jealous. You\u2019re emphatic and kind. You\u2019re understanding. You prefer peace over war. You want to save lives instead of destroying them\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t see yourself as a knight in shining armor or a prince on a white horse.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cBecause you are neither of those.\u201d </p><p>Jon held his breath, longer than he had ever thought himself capable of.</p><p>\u201cYou are the king of my kingdom, my love and my heart. I want you to rule all three of them.\u201d She kissed him again and again and again and eventually Jon wrapped his arms around her and pressed her tighter to his chest.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll be the queen ruling over my court, soul and life.\u201d</p><p>Sansa pulled back and smiled. \u201cWith pleasure, Jon Snow.\u201d She leaned towards him and her lips almost touched his ear while she whispered. \u201cGood luck with coming up with a better speech than the one I just gave you when you ask me to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s cheeks heated up. And this time not because of the cold or his salted tears.</p></p>",

Robb was handsome. Robb was brave. Robb was noble. Robb was intelligent. Maybe Robb had been a little naive, most certainly in love, but he had gotten plenty of it. And he had given even more of it. And never had Robb doubted whether or not he deserved it. Because Robb did. And Robb knew he did.</p><p>But Jon? What did he have to offer? He didn&rsquo;t have a family. He didn&rsquo;t have a fortune in the bank. He wasn&rsquo;t even sure if he&rsquo;d ever find a job that could pay the rent and the other bills. He wasn&rsquo;t brave. He wasn&rsquo;t noble. He was particularly smart either. </p><p>He was impulsive however. Sometimes even reckless. He was too honest for his own good, saying the right things to the wrong people and the wrong things to the right people. He had screamed at Sansa. He had chased her out of the house.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa!&rdquo; He yelled again and eventually he fell down on a bench. Drops of rain started to fall down on his dark black curls and his cheeks heated up because of the cold wind blowing in his face. Or maybe they were heating up because of the salted tears that rolled down.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it, Sansa, please.&rdquo; Jon let out a deep sigh. &ldquo;Not like that.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;I do think we don&rsquo;t go together. I do think you should be dating someone else. I do think you don&rsquo;t belong to me.&rdquo; He buried his face in his hands, but kept on mumbling. &ldquo;But not because I don&rsquo;t want you or don&rsquo;t love you! I do!&rdquo; Jon let out a deep sigh. &ldquo;I love and want you more than anything in the world. And I hate it.&rdquo; </p><p>The silence around him was deafening. No footsteps were running towards him. No high pitched voice screamed his name. No arms were wrapped around his neck. No kisses were planted on his cheeks and lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve got the power to destroy me. One day, when you&rsquo;ll realize that I&rsquo;m just me and you&rsquo;re the most amazing woman on earth you&rsquo;ll destroy me.&rdquo; Jon whispered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll leave me.

Due to the absolute silence she could hear her own heart beating in her chest. </p><p>What if someone pulled a prank on her? What if this audition was fake?

It had seemed too real and when she had googled the composer she had found way more information about him that she had wanted.</p><p>Like that one picture where he was playing his guitar, a frown on his forehead and a concentrated look on his face. His long black curls covered half of his face, but somehow Sansa had been mesmerized by the photo. </p><p>\u201cJon?

I had to get new ones to give you a fair chance.\u201d Finally he looked up and his eyes widened while his jaws dropped when his glance met hers.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow?\u201d Sansa straightened her back and lifted her chin. Her heartbeat had not fully slowed down yet and she could stil feel chicken skin covering her entire body. But with as much confidence as she could muster she walked towards the young man and held out her hand. \u201cI&rsquo;m Sansa Stark. I came here for the audition?\u201d</p><p>Jon kept on staring at her when he placed his hand in hers and shook it. \u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d He let out a deep breath and almost stumbled over his own feet when he walked backwards to continue getting everything ready. \u201cBut you already know that, else you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>Strangely enough his clumsiness eased her nerves a little and Sansa\u2019s smile relaxed slightly while she watched how he placed the guitar on a chair and tried to guess the right height for the microphone. </p><p>His hands trembled a little while he searched for his sheet music. He was not exactly what Sansa had expected, but right now she was not sure if that was a bad or maybe more of a good thing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll like the songs.\u201d Jon looked up and shrugged. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m looking for a singer and the sooner the better, but\u2026\u201d He scratched the back of his neck. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you can say you don\u2019t wanna do this. It\u2019s not just me picking you, it\u2019s you picking me too.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded and despite this being her audition, she got the feeling that she was the one having to make him feel at ease. \u201cI&rsquo;m sure everything will be fine.\u201d She walked towards the music stand and stared at the song, at the tones, at the lyrics. She had never been that good at reading and singing straight from the sheet, but with the right musical arrangement, she would hopefully not fail too badly.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Jon walked to the seat in the corner and reached for his guitar. His fingers tuned the strings a little and then he nodded at her once more. \u201cDo you want something to drink first? Water? Tea?\u201d He swallowed, as if he all of sudden realized he should have asked her this before showing her the sheet music and grabbing his guitar.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ll be fine. I drank something at home and warmed up my voice. I\u2019m ready when you are.\u201d Sansa smiled at him and then she stared at the sheet music again. \u201cYou\u2019ve picked an interesting title here.\u201d She cocked her head slightly. \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s just\u2026\u201d Jon paused for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s just a working title. If this works out between us, we can go over the text and title together and see if we have to change anything.\u201d</p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cI meant it as a compliment, Jon. I like it. It stands out. It\u2019s different.\u201d She reached for the microphone and took it out of the stand. \u201cWhenever you start playing, I\u2019ll start singing.\u201d She smiled once more and waited.</p><p>For a few long seconds nothing happened, but then Jon\u2019s fingers started to move, started to play. The intro of his song echoed through the room, sounding so different from her ticking heals and her high pitched scream. In a way his song was mesmerizing and enchanting and Sansa almost forgot that she was supposed to add the lyrics.</p><p>But as soon as she started singing, she felt everything click and come together. She had no problem following the melody, perfectly harmonizing with the chords from the guitar. And even though the lyrics were brand new to her, she didn\u2019t stutter and didn\u2019t trip over words. This was what her voice was made for. This was what she had been looking for all this time.</p><p>When the song was eventually over she didn\u2019t want to open her eyes, but the silence slowly drove away the magical feeling and she could no longer live in a moment that had already passed. \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnchanting.\u201d Jon finished her sentence and jumped up from his seat, his guitar still in his hands. \u201cThat was perfect. Absolutely perfect.\u201d He placed a hand on her shoulder. \u201cThat was how I wanted the song to sound, how it sounded in my dreams\u2026\u201d He kissed her cheek, but as soon as he realized what he had done he stepped back. \u201cI&rsquo;m sorry, that was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s okay.\u201d Sansa smiled and she pressed the palm of her hand to his cheek. \u201cI recognize a perfect match when I feel one.\u201d She pecked his cheek too and then she stepped back. \u201cOne more song before we grab a coffee to talk over the details of our musical future?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded eagerly and he searched for another sheet of music. </p><p>But that one song turned into three and into ten. And eventually those ten songs turned into a lifetime of songs and love.</p>",

It\u2019s not just me picking you, it\u2019s you picking me too.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded and despite this being her audition, she got the feeling that she was the one having to make him feel at ease. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be fine.\u201d She walked towards the music stand and stared at the song, at the tones, at the lyrics. She had never been that good at reading and singing straight from the sheet, but with the right musical arrangement, she would hopefully not fail too badly.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Jon walked to the seat in the corner and reached for his guitar. His fingers tuned the strings a little and then he nodded at her once more. \u201cDo you want something to drink first? Water? Tea?\u201d He swallowed, as if he all of sudden realized he should have asked her this before showing her the sheet music and grabbing his guitar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I drank something at home and warmed up my voice. I\u2019m ready when you are.\u201d Sansa smiled at him and then she stared at the sheet music again. \u201cYou\u2019ve picked an interesting title here.\u201d She cocked her head slightly. \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Jon paused for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s just a working title. If this works out between us, we can go over the text and title together and see if we have to change anything.\u201d</p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cI meant it as a compliment, Jon. I like it. It stands out. It\u2019s different.\u201d She reached for the microphone and took it out of the stand. \u201cWhenever you start playing, I\u2019ll start singing.\u201d She smiled once more and waited.</p><p>For a few long seconds nothing happened, but then Jon\u2019s fingers started to move, started to play. The intro of his song echoed through the room, sounding so different from her ticking heals and her high pitched scream. In a way his song was mesmerizing and enchanting and Sansa almost forgot that she was supposed to add the lyrics.</p><p>But as soon as she started singing, she felt everything click and come together. She had no problem following the melody, perfectly harmonizing with the chords from the guitar. And even though the lyrics were brand new to her, she didn\u2019t stutter and didn\u2019t trip over words. This was what her voice was made for. This was what she had been looking for all this time.</p><p>When the song was eventually over she didn\u2019t want to open her eyes, but the silence slowly drove away the magical feeling and she could no longer live in a moment that had already passed. \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnchanting.\u201d Jon finished her sentence and jumped up from his seat, his guitar still in his hands. \u201cThat was perfect. Absolutely perfect.\u201d He placed a hand on her shoulder. \u201cThat was how I wanted the song to sound, how it sounded in my dreams\u2026\u201d He kissed her cheek, but as soon as he realized what he had done he stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Sansa smiled and she pressed the palm of her hand to his cheek. \u201cI recognize a perfect match when I feel one.\u201d She pecked his cheek too and then she stepped back. \u201cOne more song before we grab a coffee to talk over the details of our musical future?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded eagerly and he searched for another sheet of music. </p><p>But that one song turned into three and into ten. And eventually those ten songs turned into a lifetime of songs and love.</p></p>",
