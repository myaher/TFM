Hope you like this, it\u2019s always kinda hard for me to imagine Harry being truly angry but I tried \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\udc96</p>\n\n<p>Harry has different stages of being mad, the one you seem to see the most is just him being a bit annoyed. Where he just rolls his eyes a lot and folds his arms across his chest, gives you this look that\u2019s not a full on pout or glare but a mixture of the two that lets you know he\u2019s on the edge of annoyed and extremely irritated. You\u2019ll know when he\u2019s in this mood by the sort of groan that leaves him before he lets out a huff and tosses the empty milk carton into the trash and that\u2019s when you realize you forgot to get more and there wasn\u2019t enough for his morning smoothie. It\u2019s little things such as that that seem to annoy him but you normally can fix this mood with a few kisses to his pouty face and a hug from behind as you swear you\u2019ll go to the store right after your morning shower. </p>\n\n<p>When Harry is upset he is quiet at first, he doesn\u2019t want to discuss it right in that moment because he doesn\u2019t want to say anything that will push either of you down deeper into your feelings. He just takes a few minutes to gather his thoughts and take a few deep breaths, you\u2019ll see him pinch at the bridge of his nose before letting out a breath through it while his hands land on his hips as he closes his eyes and looks up towards the ceiling. You only see this side of Harry when something truly worth discussing happens, like when he tells you to do something that is for your best interests and you just blatantly do the opposite much like the time you ignored his request for you to use his driver and just walked to the venue to meet him before one of his shows and you got bombarded by fans and photographers. Most of the time this results in you getting teary eyed because you never truly intend to make him upset with you, and Harry\u2019s shoulder slumping and a sigh escaping him as he just brings you into his chest and your mumbled apology gets lost in the fabric of his shirt while he just shushes you with a kiss to your forehead. </p>\n\n<p>Harry rarely ever gets to the point where he\u2019s so mad he can\u2019t control himself and just ends up shouting whatever comes to his mind in the heat of the moment. His jaw is clenched, one of his hands running through his hair and tugging at the roots while the other is on his hip and his eyes are burning a hole into the back of your head. This side of Harry only gets shown when he has just reached his limit and often it\u2019s set off by something little but deep down he\u2019s been holding this in for a while, most of the time what he\u2019s truly upset about has little to nothing to do with you. He knows that he\u2019s overreacting but in the moment he couldn\u2019t care less, this normally occurs when the two of you get home from a party that you just so happen to know quite a few people at and Harry\u2019s never been one to share easily so the fact you only spent maybe ten minutes with him the whole time the two of you were there just doesn\u2019t sit well with him. He throws out accusing statements making you roll your eyes as you head into the bedroom to get ready for bed, this only adds to Harry\u2019s anger making him storm after you. You know that by the time you get out of the bath and into your comfy nighty that he will be sitting on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands and when you walk over to stand in front of him all he will do is wrap his arms around your middle and rest his forehead against your tummy, you\u2019ll run your hands through his hair as you lea down to kiss his head while he begins his apology and lets you in on what\u2019s really been going on through that head of his. \ud83d\udc96</p>",

You know that by the time you get out of the bath and into your comfy nighty that he will be sitting on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands and when you walk over to stand in front of him all he will do is wrap his arms around your middle and rest his forehead against your tummy, you\u2019ll run your hands through his hair as you lea down to kiss his head while he begins his apology and lets you in on what\u2019s really been going on through that head of his. \ud83d\udc96</p>",
                "content": "<p>Hi my lovey! Awe thank you I&rsquo;m glad you enjoy these! Hope you like this, it&rsquo;s always kinda hard for me to imagine Harry being truly angry but I tried &#128584;&#128150;</p>\n\n<p>Harry has different stages of being mad, the one you seem to see the most is just him being a bit annoyed. Where he just rolls his eyes a lot and folds his arms across his chest, gives you this look that&rsquo;s not a full on pout or glare but a mixture of the two that lets you know he&rsquo;s on the edge of annoyed and extremely irritated. You&rsquo;ll know when he&rsquo;s in this mood by the sort of groan that leaves him before he lets out a huff and tosses the empty milk carton into the trash and that&rsquo;s when you realize you forgot to get more and there wasn&rsquo;t enough for his morning smoothie. It&rsquo;s little things such as that that seem to annoy him but you normally can fix this mood with a few kisses to his pouty face and a hug from behind as you swear you&rsquo;ll go to the store right after your morning shower. </p>\n\n<p>When Harry is upset he is quiet at first, he doesn&rsquo;t want to discuss it right in that moment because he doesn&rsquo;t want to say anything that will push either of you down deeper into your feelings. He just takes a few minutes to gather his thoughts and take a few deep breaths, you&rsquo;ll see him pinch at the bridge of his nose before letting out a breath through it while his hands land on his hips as he closes his eyes and looks up towards the ceiling. You only see this side of Harry when something truly worth discussing happens, like when he tells you to do something that is for your best interests and you just blatantly do the opposite much like the time you ignored his request for you to use his driver and just walked to the venue to meet him before one of his shows and you got bombarded by fans and photographers. Most of the time this results in you getting teary eyed because you never truly intend to make him upset with you, and Harry&rsquo;s shoulder slumping and a sigh escaping him as he just brings you into his chest and your mumbled apology gets lost in the fabric of his shirt while he just shushes you with a kiss to your forehead. </p>\n\n<p>Harry rarely ever gets to the point where he&rsquo;s so mad he can&rsquo;t control himself and just ends up shouting whatever comes to his mind in the heat of the moment. His jaw is clenched, one of his hands running through his hair and tugging at the roots while the other is on his hip and his eyes are burning a hole into the back of your head. This side of Harry only gets shown when he has just reached his limit and often it&rsquo;s set off by something little but deep down he&rsquo;s been holding this in for a while, most of the time what he&rsquo;s truly upset about has little to nothing to do with you. He knows that he&rsquo;s overreacting but in the moment he couldn&rsquo;t care less, this normally occurs when the two of you get home from a party that you just so happen to know quite a few people at and Harry&rsquo;s never been one to share easily so the fact you only spent maybe ten minutes with him the whole time the two of you were there just doesn&rsquo;t sit well with him. He throws out accusing statements making you roll your eyes as you head into the bedroom to get ready for bed, this only adds to Harry&rsquo;s anger making him storm after you. You know that by the time you get out of the bath and into your comfy nighty that he will be sitting on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands and when you walk over to stand in front of him all he will do is wrap his arms around your middle and rest his forehead against your tummy, you&rsquo;ll run your hands through his hair as you lea down to kiss his head while he begins his apology and lets you in on what&rsquo;s really been going on through that head of his. &#128150;</p>",
