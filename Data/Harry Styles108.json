Yes and no. She was slowly coming out of the shell that Harry catapulted her into because of his self-destructing actions but was also more cautious of anything and everything. Each person she meets had to pass her hierarchal exam where she observed if that person was worth Y/N sharing her past with. Having a relationship with a pop star certainly abided more people her way, most of them being fake and only mean to use her to get closer to Harry. Even when he wasn\u2019t around anymore, he was still influencing her to act on things with him in mind. </p><p>And no, she wasn\u2019t getting over him because it was more of like a seesaw progress, she kept going back and forth between being over him and missing him too much that she really doesn\u2019t consider herself to be <i>over</i> over, you know? She has gone on dates after him, there were some really great guys out there and she felt a connection between maybe two guys, but there wasn\u2019t any sparkle\u2014at least not the one she and Harry had. Although she felt excited going on a date with Alan from time to time, she didn\u2019t exactly feel <i>as</i> thrilled as she was with Harry. She didn\u2019t feel exhilarated with anybody else (thus far) and she was agitated at herself. No matter how much she tried, she couldn\u2019t seem to get him out of her thoughts. Just seeing an apron reminded her of him and how he \u2018<i>used to be a baker\u2019</i>. Y/N was annoyed. </p><p>Speaking of Alan, he had admitted his feelings for Y/N a while back adding on that it was okay if she didn\u2019t feel the same. After all, it was worth a shot. And trust her, she strained her beliefs to tell herself that maybe she could like Alan, see him in a different way other than a best friend type of thing. She\u2019s still trying her absolute hardest and Alan understood that. Feelings don\u2019t just change in an instant \u2013even though it was more than six months since <i>that</i> happened. She scolds herself sometimes when she\u2019s alone because Alan is such a <i>good</i> guy and he\u2019s perfect for her, but she can\u2019t seem to give her heart away\u2014because Harry still has it. </p><p>So they\u2019ve been exclusive for a few weeks, Y/N was testing the waters, going deeper and deeper to see how far she can go before she cowers back in complete abandonment of a new relationship. Her heart was light, she had forgiven Harry for cheating on her. She was personally really really happy and maybe it\u2019s got to do with the fact that she hasn\u2019t seen him face-to-face ever since, but it\u2019s almost as if she has put it behind her. Y/N was rejuvenating herself, as silly as it sounds, in the best way she knew how. That was by throwing away all the negativity and only focusing on the positive. Y/N didn\u2019t like cheaters but she also wasn\u2019t very fond of holding grudges. She believes that people could change with time and six months is a long time for Harry to reflect on his past. </p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>Alan and Y/N decided to go grocery shopping to bake some cupcakes. At times, there were some paparazzi who still deem her important that they felt the need to photograph her whereabouts, even though she\u2019ll probably end up on a postage-sized column on the paper. Not to put herself down, but she was an ordinary girl and she wasn\u2019t dating Harry anymore so she didn\u2019t understand why they still correlated her to him. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>Okay so I just ran out of flour so I\u2019m gonna get that,</i></b><i>\u201d </i>Y/N hums as she directs Alan what to get. \u201c<i><b>I\u2019ll get the dry ingredients and you can get the icing, eggs, vanilla, all the sweet stuff, yeah?\u201d</b></i></p><p>\u201c<i>Yup! I got it, holler at me if you need me to reach something from the top shelf,\u201d</i> He winks at Y/N knowing that standing on her tippy toes wasn\u2019t enough to grab the bag of powder. </p><p>She slaps his arm slightly, amused at his joke and playing offended because of his height shaming. </p><p><b><i>\u201cPffft, watch me do this on my own,\u201d</i></b></p><p>He rolls his eyes before walking away, clutching his stomach from laughing too much. </p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Baking powder, check. Baking soda, check. Icing sugar, check. Ooh, flour!</b></i>\u201d She gasps, halting. She can\u2019t believe that she almost forgot the flour. </p><p>There was only one thing that stood between her and delicious cupcake making and that was the shelf. She could see the yellow bag towering over her, tilting a bit as if to tease her for not having enough height to reach it. She huffs, going on her tiptoes even though she knows she won\u2019t even come close. </p><p>Y/N stresses to put her hands on her hips, mouth opening to do a small whisper-shout for Alan but before she could, a gruff voice comes to her aid. </p><p><i>\u201cNeed help?\u201d</i></p><p>She turns around, mouth dropping open in surprise. She had to grasp the shopping cart handles to steady herself from a heart attack she felt upon seeing her ex-boyfriend, Harry. </p><p>\u201c<i><b>Oh, hi! Yes, please</b></i>,\u201d she feels herself do an awkward wave, giggling uncomfortably. </p><p>He slowly walks over to where she was reaching for the flour. His large hand easily grabs hold of the item, handing it to her. </p><p>\u201c<i>Here ya\u2019 go,</i>\u201d Harry delivers her a charming smile and she swore her heart just melted. </p><p>Funnily enough, this wasn\u2019t how she pictured seeing Harry again. And this wasn\u2019t how she imagined feeling. It was like seeing an old friend after a long time; relived and joyful to see them glowing. She tucks a strand of hair behind her ears, looking down at the tips of her shoes, unsure of what to say to him. </p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019ve missed you. Can we tal\u2013</i>,\u201d Harry begins. </p><p>\u201c<i>I didn\u2019t hear any hollering so I\u2019m guessing you got it all by yourself, little Y/N,</i>\u201d Alan strolls over to her isle, not noticing Harry\u2019s figure and gives a light rub on her head messing up her hair. She pouts at him, mentally counting the items in his arms to see if he got everything. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>No, no\u2013uh, Harry helped me</i></b>,\u201d She gestures towards Harry, fingers attaching themselves to the back of her neck.</p><p>Harry gives a polite wave and a nod, Alan shifts his glance towards him lips set firmly in a thin line. </p><p><i>\u201cAhh, Styles what are you doing here?\u201d</i></p><p>Harry lifts his cart; \u201c<i>I\u2019m shopping,\u201d</i></p><p>There was a silence between the three, Y/N not knowing what to say. </p><p>\u201c<i>Actually, Y/N can I talk to you?\u201d </i>Harry questions her, hoping that she\u2019d let him. Y/N nods, but Alan stays planted on the spot beside her. \u201c<i>Alone</i>?\u201d</p><p>She turns to Alan whispering something in his ear and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little jealous. </p><p>\u201c<i>You sure?</i>\u201d Alan looks deeply into her eyes, searching for any sign of discomfort. She nods again. </p><p>Harry raises his brow and Y/N nods to signal that she was ready when he was. He starts walking towards a different aisle, expecting Y/N to follow him. Just before she could take a step, Alan calls her name softly, vulnerable. </p><p><i>\u201cYou still love him don\u2019t you?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N tries to stall her answer but inevitably nods. He deserves to know the truth, even when it hurts. Alan sighs.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYes, I do. I\u2019m sorry, Al\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>It\u2019s okay, Y/N. You can\u2019t control your feelings</i>,\u201d He pats her shoulder, seeing Harry stop and turn around when he realized that Y/N wasn\u2019t following him from his peripherals. \u201c<i>Besides, I met a girl,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N gasps, pushing his chest lightly. \u201c<b><i>What! Why didn\u2019t you tell me you goof,\u201d </i></b></p><p>Alan laughs at her excitement, nudging her hip with his. \u201c<i>I\u2019ll tell you all about her later. But for now, Prince Charming looks pissed at me for keeping you,</i>\u201d He winks at Y/N. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>Thank you, Alan\u201d</i></b> She gets engulfed by his long arms, feeling murmur something in her hair.</p><p><i>\u201cGo tell him you love him,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N jogs over to Harry with a smile but he doesn\u2019t look too happy. He pays for his four items quickly before walking over to the parking lot area near his car. </p><p><i>\u201cHow long have you guys been dating?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i><b>Wha-? Alan and I are not together,</b></i>\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes widen at the misconception he\u2019d conjured up. </p><p><i>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>There was a pregnant pause before Y/N decided to shoot her shot. She takes a deep breath, telling herself that <i>it\u2019s okay</i> if he didn\u2019t feel the same.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI still love you, Harry</i></b><i>.\u201d</i> She bites her lip, looking nervous into his green eyes while his only stared back at her without saying anything. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWait I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. It\u2019s fine you kno\u2013-hmph\u201d</i></b></p><p>Her lips were clamped shut with Harry\u2019s plump ones. Hands finding her waist and pulling her body impossibly closer to his. It was a short kiss but enough to show each other how they felt. </p><p><i>\u201cI love you too, Y/N.\u201d</i></p>",

She\u2019s still trying her absolute hardest and Alan understood that. Feelings don\u2019t just change in an instant \u2013even though it was more than six months since <i>that</i> happened. She scolds herself sometimes when she\u2019s alone because Alan is such a <i>good</i> guy and he\u2019s perfect for her, but she can\u2019t seem to give her heart away\u2014because Harry still has it. </p><p>So they\u2019ve been exclusive for a few weeks, Y/N was testing the waters, going deeper and deeper to see how far she can go before she cowers back in complete abandonment of a new relationship. Her heart was light, she had forgiven Harry for cheating on her. She was personally really really happy and maybe it\u2019s got to do with the fact that she hasn\u2019t seen him face-to-face ever since, but it\u2019s almost as if she has put it behind her. Y/N was rejuvenating herself, as silly as it sounds, in the best way she knew how. That was by throwing away all the negativity and only focusing on the positive. Y/N didn\u2019t like cheaters but she also wasn\u2019t very fond of holding grudges. She believes that people could change with time and six months is a long time for Harry to reflect on his past. </p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>Alan and Y/N decided to go grocery shopping to bake some cupcakes. At times, there were some paparazzi who still deem her important that they felt the need to photograph her whereabouts, even though she\u2019ll probably end up on a postage-sized column on the paper. Not to put herself down, but she was an ordinary girl and she wasn\u2019t dating Harry anymore so she didn\u2019t understand why they still correlated her to him. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>Okay so I just ran out of flour so I\u2019m gonna get that,</i></b><i>\u201d </i>Y/N hums as she directs Alan what to get. \u201c<i><b>I\u2019ll get the dry ingredients and you can get the icing, eggs, vanilla, all the sweet stuff, yeah?\u201d</b></i></p><p>\u201c<i>Yup! I got it, holler at me if you need me to reach something from the top shelf,\u201d</i> He winks at Y/N knowing that standing on her tippy toes wasn\u2019t enough to grab the bag of powder. </p><p>She slaps his arm slightly, amused at his joke and playing offended because of his height shaming. </p><p><b><i>\u201cPffft, watch me do this on my own,\u201d</i></b></p><p>He rolls his eyes before walking away, clutching his stomach from laughing too much. </p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Baking powder, check. Baking soda, check. Icing sugar, check. Ooh, flour!</b></i>\u201d She gasps, halting. She can\u2019t believe that she almost forgot the flour. </p><p>There was only one thing that stood between her and delicious cupcake making and that was the shelf. She could see the yellow bag towering over her, tilting a bit as if to tease her for not having enough height to reach it. She huffs, going on her tiptoes even though she knows she won\u2019t even come close. </p><p>Y/N stresses to put her hands on her hips, mouth opening to do a small whisper-shout for Alan but before she could, a gruff voice comes to her aid. </p><p><i>\u201cNeed help?\u201d</i></p><p>She turns around, mouth dropping open in surprise. She had to grasp the shopping cart handles to steady herself from a heart attack she felt upon seeing her ex-boyfriend, Harry. </p><p>\u201c<i><b>Oh, hi! Yes, please</b></i>,\u201d she feels herself do an awkward wave, giggling uncomfortably. </p><p>He slowly walks over to where she was reaching for the flour. His large hand easily grabs hold of the item, handing it to her. </p><p>\u201c<i>Here ya\u2019 go,</i>\u201d Harry delivers her a charming smile and she swore her heart just melted. </p><p>Funnily enough, this wasn\u2019t how she pictured seeing Harry again. And this wasn\u2019t how she imagined feeling. It was like seeing an old friend after a long time; relived and joyful to see them glowing. She tucks a strand of hair behind her ears, looking down at the tips of her shoes, unsure of what to say to him. </p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019ve missed you. Can we tal\u2013</i>,\u201d Harry begins. </p><p>\u201c<i>I didn\u2019t hear any hollering so I\u2019m guessing you got it all by yourself, little Y/N,</i>\u201d Alan strolls over to her isle, not noticing Harry\u2019s figure and gives a light rub on her head messing up her hair. She pouts at him, mentally counting the items in his arms to see if he got everything. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>No, no\u2013uh, Harry helped me</i></b>,\u201d She gestures towards Harry, fingers attaching themselves to the back of her neck.</p><p>Harry gives a polite wave and a nod, Alan shifts his glance towards him lips set firmly in a thin line. </p><p><i>\u201cAhh, Styles what are you doing here?\u201d</i></p><p>Harry lifts his cart; \u201c<i>I\u2019m shopping,\u201d</i></p><p>There was a silence between the three, Y/N not knowing what to say. </p><p>\u201c<i>Actually, Y/N can I talk to you?\u201d </i>Harry questions her, hoping that she\u2019d let him. Y/N nods, but Alan stays planted on the spot beside her. \u201c<i>Alone</i>?\u201d</p><p>She turns to Alan whispering something in his ear and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little jealous. </p><p>\u201c<i>You sure?</i>\u201d Alan looks deeply into her eyes, searching for any sign of discomfort. She nods again. </p><p>Harry raises his brow and Y/N nods to signal that she was ready when he was. He starts walking towards a different aisle, expecting Y/N to follow him. Just before she could take a step, Alan calls her name softly, vulnerable. </p><p><i>\u201cYou still love him don\u2019t you?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N tries to stall her answer but inevitably nods. He deserves to know the truth, even when it hurts. Alan sighs.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYes, I do. I\u2019m sorry, Al\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>It\u2019s okay, Y/N. You can\u2019t control your feelings</i>,\u201d He pats her shoulder, seeing Harry stop and turn around when he realized that Y/N wasn\u2019t following him from his peripherals. \u201c<i>Besides, I met a girl,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N gasps, pushing his chest lightly. \u201c<b><i>What! Why didn\u2019t you tell me you goof,\u201d </i></b></p><p>Alan laughs at her excitement, nudging her hip with his. \u201c<i>I\u2019ll tell you all about her later. But for now, Prince Charming looks pissed at me for keeping you,</i>\u201d He winks at Y/N. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>Thank you, Alan\u201d</i></b> She gets engulfed by his long arms, feeling murmur something in her hair.</p><p><i>\u201cGo tell him you love him,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N jogs over to Harry with a smile but he doesn\u2019t look too happy. He pays for his four items quickly before walking over to the parking lot area near his car. </p><p><i>\u201cHow long have you guys been dating?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i><b>Wha-? Alan and I are not together,</b></i>\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes widen at the misconception he\u2019d conjured up. </p><p><i>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>There was a pregnant pause before Y/N decided to shoot her shot. She takes a deep breath, telling herself that <i>it\u2019s okay</i> if he didn\u2019t feel the same.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI still love you, Harry</i></b><i>.\u201d</i> She bites her lip, looking nervous into his green eyes while his only stared back at her without saying anything. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWait I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. It\u2019s fine you kno\u2013-hmph\u201d</i></b></p><p>Her lips were clamped shut with Harry\u2019s plump ones. Hands finding her waist and pulling her body impossibly closer to his. It was a short kiss but enough to show each other how they felt. </p><p><i>\u201cI love you too, Y/N.\u201d</i></p></p>",

Yes and no. She was slowly coming out of the shell that Harry catapulted her into because of his self-destructing actions but was also more cautious of anything and everything. Each person she meets had to pass her hierarchal exam where she observed if that person was worth Y/N sharing her past with. Having a relationship with a pop star certainly abided more people her way, most of them being fake and only mean to use her to get closer to Harry. Even when he wasn&rsquo;t around anymore, he was still influencing her to act on things with him in mind. </p><p>And no, she wasn&rsquo;t getting over him because it was more of like a seesaw progress, she kept going back and forth between being over him and missing him too much that she really doesn&rsquo;t consider herself to be <i>over</i> over, you know? She has gone on dates after him, there were some really great guys out there and she felt a connection between maybe two guys, but there wasn&rsquo;t any sparkle&mdash;at least not the one she and Harry had. Although she felt excited going on a date with Alan from time to time, she didn&rsquo;t exactly feel <i>as</i> thrilled as she was with Harry. She didn&rsquo;t feel exhilarated with anybody else (thus far) and she was agitated at herself. No matter how much she tried, she couldn&rsquo;t seem to get him out of her thoughts. Just seeing an apron reminded her of him and how he &lsquo;<i>used to be a baker&rsquo;</i>. Y/N was annoyed. </p><p>Speaking of Alan, he had admitted his feelings for Y/N a while back adding on that it was okay if she didn&rsquo;t feel the same. After all, it was worth a shot.
