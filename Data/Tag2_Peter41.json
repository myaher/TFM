You and he have been through thick and thin. He always left sorry for you, he was an orphan, yes, but he had Aunt May. You had virtually no one, no family alive. You got through it, especially you found a family who loves you unconditionally.</p><p>You had Tony, the father figure you always wanted. He was serious, playful and caring. He was always to celebrate your achievement and whilst he was a busy man, he was always made sure to call you up to check up on you and always get Happy to fill in any details of you.</p><p>Pepper was your mother figure in your life, so, whenever you had missions, she would immediately see if you\u2019re okay. She would check for any injuries, even if Tony had checked before, before engulfing you into a tight hug, which you readily accept.</p><p>Happy and Rhodey were your uncles, entertaining, fun and somehow adapted asthma with the amount of unnecessary loud sighing they do around you.\u00a0</p><p>Aunt May had loved that she\u2019s practically adopted another nephew who legally has you in her care. You sleep on the top bunk in Peter\u2019s room, but despite being in her care for months, she still finds you asleep on the sofa, afraid you\u2019re invading Peter\u2019s personal bubble.</p><p>But, Peter. Peter was your brother, he was your best friend, but more importantly your brother. You and he acted like any other brothers. You fight over the tv remote, you shared clothes and get annoyed with each other for using something without permission. You two loved and hated each other, protect each other\u2019s back and annoy each other.</p><p>You started high school together as strangers and came out of high school as brothers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMJ and Ned have been flooding the group chat if we could get KFC before the party tonight,\u201d You nudged him with your shoulder,\u00a0\u201cWhat do you say? We make Happy take a detour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get annoyed,\u201d Peter laughs, but giving you a knowing look,\u00a0\u201cOf course, we are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are my boys?\u201d Aunt May screams throughout the apartment that both of you were sure that the whole building could hear her,\u00a0\u201cI need pictures in the living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think this would take?\u201d Peter asked as you chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWe took almost a hundred pictures for prom, bro, that was before we even left home,\u201d You responded,\u00a0\u201cThis is why we\u2019re on a tight schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt she\u2019ll stick with it.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"2210\" data-orig-height=\"143\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_prm5b4QT7L1sngn50_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"2210\" data-orig-height=\"143\"/></figure><p>You and Peter were still wearing your gowns as you both wear your caps, you two were laughing at some stupid jokes that Peter was cracking. Ned had gone out to find his family as MJ went to venture out hers. You and Peter were off as two brothers looking for their family.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook for a crowd,\u201d Peter reasons, thinking of where your family was located,\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019ll flock to see Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete, it\u2019s Tony, how many times does Tony have to say that?\u201d You teased as you go on your tiptoes to see if you could see any familiar features,\u00a0\u201cMaybe we should look for a strawberry hair lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Potts is always easier to find,\u201d Peter agrees.</p><p>\u201cBoys!\u201d You both hear, swirling around to see the group of oddballs radiating towards you and Peter.</p><p>Aunt May was the first to wrap her arms around both you and Peter, sharing the hug as she tightens her grip around you two, for two superheroes, both you and Peter groan at the force. Before she lets go and gives you individual hugs and kisses. Then, in came Tony, who gave you two grins and engulfing you into a hug.</p><p>\u201cMy two favourite nerds,\u201d He teases as both you and Peter tighten the hug.\u00a0</p><p>Soon, Tony was engulfing you and Peter separately, then getting individual hugs from Pepper, Rhodey and even Happy gave you a hug. Then, pictures were being taken, there were too many cameras and phones to look out. The moment had to be captured on May\u2019s, Tony\u2019s, Peter\u2019s and your phone, plus May\u2019s iPad.</p><p>Pictures were full of your family, some with Peter, some without him. Trio pictures to group pictures, but you hadn\u2019t gotten a picture with Peter. Just Peter and you, no May in the middle or Tony in the middle.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNice cap, (Y/n), think you have Parker\u2019s,\u201d Rhodey points out as he sees your cap designed.</p><p>But, when you turn to grin at him, taking your cap off to show it off to the adults,\u00a0\u201cNah, I made it myself.\u201d</p><p>It was a Spiderman design cap, full of red, white and blue. You were beaming happily as Peter turns to look at you as he takes off his cap, he shows to the adults to find that he had designed his cap with your Superhero logo. The adults\u2019 smile turns to a soft frown before they were smiling again.</p><p>These boys in front of them just care too much about each other that they dedicated their cap to each other. Their smile grew bigger when they saw their boys beaming at each other.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBoys, you need another picture!\u201d May waves her hand to signal to get together, push yourself to station yourself next to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnother picture? Another few dozen,\u201d Peter complained but there was a fond smile on his lip as May pretends to be mad at her nephew\u2019s complaint.</p><p>You and he wrap your arms around each other shoulders, gripping each other\u2019s gown as you use your other hand to point at him. Pictures after pictures and changing poses each time. One picture consisted of you two doing your superhero pose and then mocking each other\u2019s superhero pose.</p><p>Some pictures had him carrying you on his back, or you bridal carrying him. Making funny faces or simply a picture capturing you fixing his cap or him straightening your gown.\u00a0</p><p>But, there was one picture for the picture frame that was surely going to be on the wall of the Stark home, Parker apartment and the Avengers base. It was a picture of you and Peter looking at each other, admiration filled eyes.</p><p>A moment shared between two graduating high schoolers, you were talking to him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve made them proud, Pete,\u201d You nodded, referring to your deceased family, Peter\u2019s eyes soften as he grips the area between your neck and shoulder tightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, bro.\u201d</p><p>You grinned at him and he beams back right at you, like a little ray of sunshine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you too.\u201d<br/></p>",
