So tonight they\u2019d ventured out to the local human town, roaming the streets looking as normal as possible. Phil had given Dan clothes to wear, he wasn\u2019t fond of the jeans or shoes as they restricted him, but he quite enjoyed the big green jumper which smelled like Phil.<br/><br/>Phil had his arm around his shoulders as they looked around the small streets. They needed somewhere discreet to pick off a meal, where they wouldn\u2019t be seen. The best bet was a dark alley, or near the edge of town by the forest.<br/><br/>They were in a small area of grass and trees laid out in the town, Phil told him it was something called a park. It was here Dan stopped, sniffing at the air, then let his ears prick and listened closely, standing deadly still. Phil looked at him with a tilt of his head, \u201cNot humans?\u201d He asked, eyes scanning the small area.<br/><br/>Dan scanned the area with sharp eyes, then slipping yellow as he sensed them approaching. \u201cThree. I don\u2019t know what they are yet.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cLet me scout the area, stay here.\u201d Phil hummed, swiftly darting around, perching from a tree.<br/><br/>Vampires. Three, as Dan said. They didn\u2019t seem to be a threat as far as he could tell for now. He returned to Dan\u2019s side, \u201cVampires.\u201d<br/><br/>Dan didn\u2019t look overly worried, but he was a little concerned. \u201cThreatening?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cNot as far as I can tell, it\u2019s a smaller group, likely part of larger pack somewhere outside of town.\u201d Phil shook his head.<br/><br/>\u201cYou call them packs?\u201d Dan asked curiously. Phil shook his head, \u201cA group of vampires is called a clan or a coven. I just call them packs now out of habit, thanks to you\u201d he smiled.<br/><br/>Dan smiled at the new knowledge, then looked sharply at the trees. \u201cThey\u2019re approaching us.\u201d<br/><br/>Phil moved to his side, eyes landing on the tree line where three vampires emerged. Two men, and one woman. All three were pale as paper, with eyes rich in colour. Dan\u2019s ears flattened to his hair, but he knew better than to growl, instead holding a steady gaze. Meanwhile, Phil\u2019s own stance was defensive, standing tall with his shoulders broadened as they approached.<br/><br/>The oldest looking of the three, Phil presumed him to have been in his early 40s when he changed, stepped forward. He inspected the three vampires, his eyebrow raised. It couldn\u2019t be? \u201cDavid?\u201d He stepped forward, shoulders dropping only slightly.<br/><br/>Dan\u2019s eyes flicked to Phil when he said the elder&rsquo;s name. The vampire he now knew as David grinned, \u201cPhil! Long time no see old friend.\u201d<br/><br/>Phil smiled and stepped up, \u201cA long time indeed! You\u2019re a bit far from your old territory my friend.\u201d He offered his wrist, a common vampire greeting was the pressing together of the \u2018pulse\u2019, substituting a human handshake. But by being the first to extend the greeting, and having his hand dominate the handshake subtly, he was politely acknowledging his \u201cclaim\u201d over this area of territory.<br/><br/>His friend smiled, \u201cOnly passing through don\u2019t trouble yourself. You\u2019ve met Carry, haven\u2019t you? And this little lad is James.\u201d He gestured to the youngest of their troop, no older the 16. Dan watched with caution, confused. They all looked such different ages, he thought they stopped ageing.<br/><br/>Phil smiled and nodded. \u201cWonderful.\u201d He looked at the other two, \u201cI have, it\u2019s nice to see you again Carry, you look well, much better than when we met last.\u201d He took her hand and kissed it warmly, a simple greeting for females. Phil ruffled the blonde locks of the smaller vampire, \u201cThe son you wanted.\u201d He smiled warmly. \u201cHe\u2019s ageing well.\u201d<br/><br/>Dan ruffled up when Phil kissed the female&rsquo;s hand, clearly displeased with the action. The younger, James, was staring at him, particularly his ears.<br/><br/>David chuckled, \u201cYes indeed, on death&rsquo;s door so thought I\u2019d give him a breath of life, or unlife anyway.\u201d David glanced at Dan, \u201cYour werewolf seems displeased.\u201d<br/><br/>Phil chuckled and fell back to Dan\u2019s side, ruffling his ears fondly. \u201cWolves are fairly possessive of their pack and their mate.\u201d He smiled, \u201cThis is Dan, Dan this is David, a friend from long ago. He was Carry\u2019s mentor and now partner, and their son, James.\u201d Phil gestured to each vampire in turn.<br/><br/>Dan relaxed when he realised the female and male were a mated pair. She was no threat to him, so instead his interest peaked. \u201cHi.\u201d<br/><br/>David smiled, \u201cHello Daniel, managed to drag Phil out of his isolation I see.\u201d Dan shot Phil a confused look, and Phil cast his eyes back the elder vampire, \u201cThis again, David?\u201d He raised his brow in amusement.<br/><br/>David shrugged, \u201cYou have been avoiding all contact with&hellip; anyone really, for nearly 50 years Phil.\u201d Phil shrugged his shoulders, \u201cOnce I left my family, then my clan, associating with others often brought nothing but bad karma.\u201d<br/><br/>Dan frowned but held his tongue on the questioning for now. The youngest walked up to him, and Dan watched him with careful eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re ears look so soft.\u201d The boy commented, but Dan wasn\u2019t really sure how to respond.<br/><br/>Phil moved beside James wearily, he sensed no threat from the child but was cautious in any case. He met eyes with Dan, trying to convey that there was no threat.<br/><br/>Dan relaxed a little at the reassurance. \u201cCan I touch them?\u201d The boy asked Dan, pulled a weary face, \u201c I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d<br/><br/>Phil placed a soft arm on the young vampire\u2019s arm, \u201cIn this case, best not to young vampire, we don\u2019t want any mishaps, not do we?\u201d <br/><br/>James pouted, but refrained anyway with a nod, returning to his father who was laughing. \u201cNow now James, you wouldn\u2019t like it if a stranger touched your ears now would you?\u201d<br/><br/>Phil smiled at the elder, grateful of his understanding. \u201cHe\u2019s progressing well for such a young one David.\u201d He complimented warmly. David grinned proudly, \u201cHe has a good mentor clearly.\u201d You\u2019ve moved on then at last, with Dan here?\u201d The man asked, not unkindly, but Dan sensed it was a personal question.<br/><br/>Phil cast eyes at the ground, then nodded slowly. \u201cI have. Sometimes fate intervenes, I believe.\u201d When he looked up again, he seemed thoughtful. David was silent for a long moment, then smiled, \u201cWell then, fate has been kind to you my friend, in the end at least.\u201d<br/><br/>Phil smiled, \u201cIndeed.\u201d He stood tall again, the subject changed. \u201cHas there been any word of the old coven? You\u2019re the first I\u2019ve come across in many years.\u201d<br/><br/>David chuckled, \u201cThat would be because you hide in the woods, where vampires belong in the city.\u201d He winked, \u201cBut they are well, some miss your presence more than others I\u2019m sure.\u201d<br/><br/>Phil hummed, \u201cThere\u2019s too much chaos in the city. Humans and hunters are far more advanced than they were years ago.\u201d He chuckled. David shrugged, \u201cBrings a little challenge to unliving.\u201d <br/><br/>Carry spoke up for the first time, \u201cDo you and the wolf lay together?\u201d It was a rather abrupt question, it didn\u2019t seem rude necessarily, more curious and Phil blinked at the suddenness of the question, and turned to her. \u201cYes, we do.\u201d He nodded.<br/><br/>She blinked, \u201cI\u2019ve not heard of that happening before.\u201d David laughed, \u201cOf course it has, just not for a while, we don\u2019t generally mix well as species.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIt\u2019s not hugely common, between the vampire and werewolf species, often they are very hostile towards each other.\u201d Phil smiled, \u201cbut it does happen.\u201d Carry nodded, \u201cYou plan on remaining coupled?\u201d<br/><br/>Dan ruffled up again. He didn\u2019t particularly like being to the subject of her conversation without actually being addressed directly. Phil must have noticed, as he moved back to his side, dropping his arm around Dan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYes, as long as Dan wishes to,\u201d Dan leaned into the touch, relaxing a little.<br/><br/>David grinned, \u201cWell then good luck my friend. We wish to hunt here if that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d<br/><br/>Phil smiled, and nodded, \u201cFeel free. I just ask that you be discreet. We wish to keep our presence in the area as unknown as possible.\u201d David nodded, \u201cOf course, you wish to be left to your peace again?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYes, but please do feel free to stop by if you\u2019re passing through again in future. It has been wonderful to see you, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d he smiled. David moved forward and gripped his arm again. \u201cSee again my friend, hopefully within the next century.\u201d<br/><br/>Phil gripped his arm in response, \u201cI hope so,\u201d he smiled genuinely.<br/><br/>Dan watched the interaction with curiosity, then the vampires wonder off their own way.<br/><br/>Phil let his shoulder relax once they were gone, a small sigh of relief as Dan pressed into his side, \u201cHow\u2019d you know him?\u201d Phil nuzzled his hair softly, \u201cWe were in the same coven all those years ago.\u201d He hummed.<br/><br/>Dan looked up, \u201cWhat\u2019s a vampire coven like?\u201d<br/><br/>Phil thought for a minute, \u201cIt has its ups and down. They\u2019ll always have your back and you\u2019ll always be safe. But sometimes they\u2019re very keen to keep to old traditions.\u201d He shrugged softly, fingers carting through Dan\u2019s soft hair and caressing his ears.<br/><br/>\u201cWhat sort of traditions?\u201d He pressed his head into Phil\u2019s hand.<br/><br/>Phil smiled, \u201cThey\u2019re very particular about bloodlines, and believe that only vampires should only mate with vampires. Males should only mate with females, and that the opinion of the coven should be the opinion of you. Most of the elders also think that biting for awakening purposes shouldn\u2019t be allowed\u201d he hummed.<br/><br/>Dan crinkles his nose, \u201cThat\u2019s weird, why can\u2019t males mate?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThey can if they wish too but it\u2019s heavily frowned upon, from the old covens anyway, as two male vampires can\u2019t reproduce. It\u2019s seen as a weakness to the coven, that you\u2019re not producing offspring which can grow up to protect the coven, increase its strength and someday provide more offspring to repeat the process.\u201d He shrugged.<br/><br/>Dan scoffed, \u201cHow old-fashioned. Two Alphas can\u2019t reproduce but they can mate if they want too, others will keep the pack going.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIt\u2019s very old-fashioned.\u201d Phil shrugged, \u201cThey frowned on many types of mating. Those of the same gender, or those who cross species. Often resorting to violence in extreme cases, usually involving hybrids or humans. I refuse to have any part in it.\u201d He nodded.<br/><br/>Dan tilted his head, \u201cThey would disprove of some matings then? Of ours?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cMost likely, maybe not now, but back then. I don\u2019t care though, I chose my mate, not tradition.\u201d He smiled reassuringly. Dan looked a little conflicted, \u201cBut- I\u2019m separating you from your species.\u201d<br/><br/>Phil shook his head, pressing a kiss to Dan\u2019s head, \u201cYou aren\u2019t separating me, I separated myself. As a result, I have you.\u201d Dan flushed, pressing in close. \u201cYou said something about hybrids?\u201d<br/><br/>Phil curled his arms around him warmly, \u201cYeah, when two species find a way to combine,\u201d he hummed, \u201cIt\u2019s uncommon, but it happens.\u201d<br/><br/>Dan looked up, \u201cIf we had pups, would they be hybrids?\u201d<br/><br/>Phil considered it for a moment, \u201cThey most likely would be yes, but there\u2019s also a chance that might also be full werewolves, like you. Or full vampires, like me\u201d He smiled. \u201cHybrids pups are much more common than adult hybrids, it\u2019s riskier to become a hybrid as an adult, and can be painful, life-threatening in a lot of cases.\u201d He explained from his knowledge or the subject.<br/><br/>\u201cOh. So if I were to bite you, properly, you\u2019d turn into a hybrid?\u201d He asked, curious.<br/><br/>\u201cPretty much, just like if I bit you and chose to inject venom, it would change you. It works similar to if I infect a human, only a human will become a full vampire, not a hybrid.\u201d He nodded.<br/><br/>Dan nodded, \u201cOkay, come on let\u2019s eat.\u201d He pulled Phil in for a deep kiss, \u201cYou can tell me more at the cabin.\u201d He said wagging his tail as they set off into the tree line.</p><hr><p>Phil sunk down into the sofa once they returned to the cabin, a content, full feeling in his stomach. The meal would definitely last him a while, leaving him able to get by on animal blood.</p><p><br/>Dan climbed into his lap with a little hum, snuggling into his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s was necessary.\u201d Phil nodded his agreement and played softly with Dan\u2019s hair. \u201cIt definitely was.\u201d<br/><br/>Dan sat up, \u201cWhat\u2019s the greeting you did? With David?\u201d Phil smiled, pleased that Dan was interested in his culture as he held out his arm, \u201cHold out yours.\u201d Dan did, sitting back to hold his arm out.<br/><br/>\u201cIt\u2019s a common greeting with vampires. You press the pulse of your wrist to the others, and hold the wrist, sort of like a handshake,\u201d he smiled and pressed his wrist to Dan\u2019s, softly holding his forearm. \u201cUsually the more powerful vampire extends the greeting, as a sign of authority, so I did because we inhabit this area, which means no others are supposed to settle or hunt here without my blessing.\u201d He smiled.<br/><br/>Dan gripped his wrist, fascinated with the feeling his own pulse against Phil\u2019s still wrist.<br/><br/>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t have a pulse but you do. That\u2019s a male greeting,\u201d Phil smiled, \u201cWith a female, you kiss the back of her hand if she has a mate,\u201d he lifted Dan\u2019s hand and kissed the back of his hand, \u201cand the pulse point of her wrist if she doesn\u2019t.\u201d He pressed a kiss to Dan\u2019s wrist.<br/><br/>Dan watched, \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d He lifted Phil\u2019s wrist up and kissed the back of his hand, and Phil repeated the action with a fond smile. \u201cI like that you\u2019re so interested in my kind.\u201d<br/><br/>Dan grinned, \u201cWell if my mate\u2019s a vampire, and there\u2019s a chance my pups could be vampires, I would like to understand the culture.\u201d Phil smiled at the admission, his chest swelling with the realisation Dan was very serious about him, and them. \u201cSo you\u2019re okay with the possibility that our future pups could be part vampire?\u201d<br/><br/>Dan smiled confidently, \u201cOr whole vampire,\u201d he put his hand to Phil\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad, and they won\u2019t be either.\u201d<br/><br/>Phil smiled and pecked Dan\u2019s palm softly, \u201cIf they have part of you in them they\u2019ll be wonderful.\u201d <br/><br/>Dan flushed then giggled, as he moved forward and claimed Phil\u2019s lips affectionately, pleased when Phil kissed back, cupping his face.<br/><br/>Dan shuffled into his lap, then he pulled back. \u201cI\u2019ll be going into heat in the next couple days.\u201d<br/><br/>Phil nodded, kissing his mate\u2019s forehead. \u201cI know, and I know that Sam doesn&rsquo;t think I can look after you, and keep you safe. But I can.\u201d<br/><br/>Dan nodded, \u201cI know you can. And it&rsquo;s better for me, that I&rsquo;m not sharing it with an alpha wolf. You&rsquo;re not like Sam, not like the pack. You can control yourself, you can hold me and comfort me, without giving in to your urges.\u201d<br/><br/>Phil smiled, holding him close to his body and cuddling him. \u201cI can, and I&rsquo;ve been learning from the other wolves. Sarah, a sweet omega wolf taught me some bits, about heats. I\u2019ll be there for you.\u201d<br/><br/>Dan looked up with fond eyes, \u201cI want to share it with you, but- not in the traditional way. Not just yet, I need a little more time.\u201d He admitted nervously.<br/><br/>Phil looked up to meet soft brown eyes, \u201cI\u2019ll give you all the time you need love.\u201d<br/><br/>Dan smiled then, curling into his mate\u2019s chest with a content, quiet purr. Even then, he knew he\u2019d made the right decision in Phil.</p>",

They didn\u2019t seem to be a threat as far as he could tell for now. He returned to Dan\u2019s side, \u201cVampires.\u201d<br><br>Dan didn\u2019t look overly worried, but he was a little concerned. \u201cThreatening?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNot as far as I can tell, it\u2019s a smaller group, likely part of larger pack somewhere outside of town.\u201d Phil shook his head.<br><br>\u201cYou call them packs?\u201d Dan asked curiously. Phil shook his head, \u201cA group of vampires is called a clan or a coven.

It couldn\u2019t be? \u201cDavid?\u201d He stepped forward, shoulders dropping only slightly.<br><br>Dan\u2019s eyes flicked to Phil when he said the elder\u2019s name. The vampire he now knew as David grinned, \u201cPhil! Long time no see old friend.\u201d<br><br>Phil smiled and stepped up, \u201cA long time indeed! You\u2019re a bit far from your old territory my friend.\u201d He offered his wrist, a common vampire greeting was the pressing together of the \u2018pulse\u2019, substituting a human handshake. But by being the first to extend the greeting, and having his hand dominate the handshake subtly, he was politely acknowledging his \u201cclaim\u201d over this area of territory.<br><br>His friend smiled, \u201cOnly passing through don\u2019t trouble yourself. You\u2019ve met Carry, haven\u2019t you? And this little lad is James.\u201d He gestured to the youngest of their troop, no older the 16. Dan watched with caution, confused. They all looked such different ages, he thought they stopped ageing.<br><br>Phil smiled and nodded. \u201cWonderful.\u201d He looked at the other two, \u201cI have, it\u2019s nice to see you again Carry, you look well, much better than when we met last.\u201d He took her hand and kissed it warmly, a simple greeting for females. Phil ruffled the blonde locks of the smaller vampire, \u201cThe son you wanted.\u201d He smiled warmly. \u201cHe\u2019s ageing well.\u201d<br><br>Dan ruffled up when Phil kissed the female\u2019s hand, clearly displeased with the action. The younger, James, was staring at him, particularly his ears.<br><br>David chuckled, \u201cYes indeed, on death\u2019s door so thought I\u2019d give him a breath of life, or unlife anyway.\u201d David glanced at Dan, \u201cYour werewolf seems displeased.\u201d<br><br>Phil chuckled and fell back to Dan\u2019s side, ruffling his ears fondly. \u201cWolves are fairly possessive of their pack and their mate.\u201d He smiled, \u201cThis is Dan, Dan this is David, a friend from long ago. He was Carry\u2019s mentor and now partner, and their son, James.\u201d Phil gestured to each vampire in turn.<br><br>Dan relaxed when he realised the female and male were a mated pair. She was no threat to him, so instead his interest peaked. \u201cHi.\u201d<br><br>David smiled, \u201cHello Daniel, managed to drag Phil out of his isolation I see.\u201d Dan shot Phil a confused look, and Phil cast his eyes back the elder vampire, \u201cThis again, David?\u201d He raised his brow in amusement.<br><br>David shrugged, \u201cYou have been avoiding all contact with\u2026 anyone really, for nearly 50 years Phil.\u201d Phil shrugged his shoulders, \u201cOnce I left my family, then my clan, associating with others often brought nothing but bad karma.\u201d<br><br>Dan frowned but held his tongue on the questioning for now. The youngest walked up to him, and Dan watched him with careful eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re ears look so soft.\u201d The boy commented, but Dan wasn\u2019t really sure how to respond.<br><br>Phil moved beside James wearily, he sensed no threat from the child but was cautious in any case. He met eyes with Dan, trying to convey that there was no threat.<br><br>Dan relaxed a little at the reassurance. \u201cCan I touch them?\u201d The boy asked Dan, pulled a weary face, \u201c I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d<br><br>Phil placed a soft arm on the young vampire\u2019s arm, \u201cIn this case, best not to young vampire, we don\u2019t want any mishaps, not do we?\u201d <br><br>James pouted, but refrained anyway with a nod, returning to his father who was laughing. \u201cNow now James, you wouldn\u2019t like it if a stranger touched your ears now would you?\u201d<br><br>Phil smiled at the elder, grateful of his understanding. \u201cHe\u2019s progressing well for such a young one David.\u201d He complimented warmly. David grinned proudly, \u201cHe has a good mentor clearly.\u201d You\u2019ve moved on then at last, with Dan here?\u201d The man asked, not unkindly, but Dan sensed it was a personal question.<br><br>Phil cast eyes at the ground, then nodded slowly. \u201cI have. Sometimes fate intervenes, I believe.\u201d When he looked up again, he seemed thoughtful. David was silent for a long moment, then smiled, \u201cWell then, fate has been kind to you my friend, in the end at least.\u201d<br><br>Phil smiled, \u201cIndeed.\u201d He stood tall again, the subject changed. \u201cHas there been any word of the old coven? You\u2019re the first I\u2019ve come across in many years.\u201d<br><br>David chuckled, \u201cThat would be because you hide in the woods, where vampires belong in the city.\u201d He winked, \u201cBut they are well, some miss your presence more than others I\u2019m sure.\u201d<br><br>Phil hummed, \u201cThere\u2019s too much chaos in the city. Humans and hunters are far more advanced than they were years ago.\u201d He chuckled. David shrugged, \u201cBrings a little challenge to unliving.\u201d <br><br>Carry spoke up for the first time, \u201cDo you and the wolf lay together?\u201d It was a rather abrupt question, it didn\u2019t seem rude necessarily, more curious and Phil blinked at the suddenness of the question, and turned to her. \u201cYes, we do.\u201d He nodded.<br><br>She blinked, \u201cI\u2019ve not heard of that happening before.\u201d David laughed, \u201cOf course it has, just not for a while, we don\u2019t generally mix well as species.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not hugely common, between the vampire and werewolf species, often they are very hostile towards each other.\u201d Phil smiled, \u201cbut it does happen.\u201d Carry nodded, \u201cYou plan on remaining coupled?\u201d<br><br>Dan ruffled up again. He didn\u2019t particularly like being to the subject of her conversation without actually being addressed directly. Phil must have noticed, as he moved back to his side, dropping his arm around Dan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYes, as long as Dan wishes to,\u201d Dan leaned into the touch, relaxing a little.<br><br>David grinned, \u201cWell then good luck my friend. We wish to hunt here if that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d<br><br>Phil smiled, and nodded, \u201cFeel free. I just ask that you be discreet. We wish to keep our presence in the area as unknown as possible.\u201d David nodded, \u201cOf course, you wish to be left to your peace again?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYes, but please do feel free to stop by if you\u2019re passing through again in future. It has been wonderful to see you, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d he smiled. David moved forward and gripped his arm again. \u201cSee again my friend, hopefully within the next century.\u201d<br><br>Phil gripped his arm in response, \u201cI hope so,\u201d he smiled genuinely.<br><br>Dan watched the interaction with curiosity, then the vampires wonder off their own way.<br><br>Phil let his shoulder relax once they were gone, a small sigh of relief as Dan pressed into his side, \u201cHow\u2019d you know him?\u201d Phil nuzzled his hair softly, \u201cWe were in the same coven all those years ago.\u201d He hummed.<br><br>Dan looked up, \u201cWhat\u2019s a vampire coven like?\u201d<br><br>Phil thought for a minute, \u201cIt has its ups and down. They\u2019ll always have your back and you\u2019ll always be safe. But sometimes they\u2019re very keen to keep to old traditions.\u201d He shrugged softly, fingers carting through Dan\u2019s soft hair and caressing his ears.<br><br>\u201cWhat sort of traditions?\u201d He pressed his head into Phil\u2019s hand.<br><br>Phil smiled, \u201cThey\u2019re very particular about bloodlines, and believe that only vampires should only mate with vampires. Males should only mate with females, and that the opinion of the coven should be the opinion of you. Most of the elders also think that biting for awakening purposes shouldn\u2019t be allowed\u201d he hummed.<br><br>Dan crinkles his nose, \u201cThat\u2019s weird, why can\u2019t males mate?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThey can if they wish too but it\u2019s heavily frowned upon, from the old covens anyway, as two male vampires can\u2019t reproduce. It\u2019s seen as a weakness to the coven, that you\u2019re not producing offspring which can grow up to protect the coven, increase its strength and someday provide more offspring to repeat the process.\u201d He shrugged.<br><br>Dan scoffed, \u201cHow old-fashioned. Two Alphas can\u2019t reproduce but they can mate if they want too, others will keep the pack going.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s very old-fashioned.\u201d Phil shrugged, \u201cThey frowned on many types of mating. Those of the same gender, or those who cross species. Often resorting to violence in extreme cases, usually involving hybrids or humans. I refuse to have any part in it.\u201d He nodded.<br><br>Dan tilted his head, \u201cThey would disprove of some matings then? Of ours?\u201d<br><br>\u201cMost likely, maybe not now, but back then. I don\u2019t care though, I chose my mate, not tradition.\u201d He smiled reassuringly. Dan looked a little conflicted, \u201cBut- I\u2019m separating you from your species.\u201d<br><br>Phil shook his head, pressing a kiss to Dan\u2019s head, \u201cYou aren\u2019t separating me, I separated myself. As a result, I have you.\u201d Dan flushed, pressing in close. \u201cYou said something about hybrids?\u201d<br><br>Phil curled his arms around him warmly, \u201cYeah, when two species find a way to combine,\u201d he hummed, \u201cIt\u2019s uncommon, but it happens.\u201d<br><br>Dan looked up, \u201cIf we had pups, would they be hybrids?\u201d<br><br>Phil considered it for a moment, \u201cThey most likely would be yes, but there\u2019s also a chance that might also be full werewolves, like you. Or full vampires, like me\u201d He smiled. \u201cHybrids pups are much more common than adult hybrids, it\u2019s riskier to become a hybrid as an adult, and can be painful, life-threatening in a lot of cases.\u201d He explained from his knowledge or the subject.<br><br>\u201cOh. So if I were to bite you, properly, you\u2019d turn into a hybrid?\u201d He asked, curious.<br><br>\u201cPretty much, just like if I bit you and chose to inject venom, it would change you. It works similar to if I infect a human, only a human will become a full vampire, not a hybrid.\u201d He nodded.<br><br>Dan nodded, \u201cOkay, come on let\u2019s eat.\u201d He pulled Phil in for a deep kiss, \u201cYou can tell me more at the cabin.\u201d He said wagging his tail as they set off into the tree line.</p><hr><p>Phil sunk down into the sofa once they returned to the cabin, a content, full feeling in his stomach. The meal would definitely last him a while, leaving him able to get by on animal blood.</p><p><br>Dan climbed into his lap with a little hum, snuggling into his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s was necessary.\u201d Phil nodded his agreement and played softly with Dan\u2019s hair. \u201cIt definitely was.\u201d<br><br>Dan sat up, \u201cWhat\u2019s the greeting you did? With David?\u201d Phil smiled, pleased that Dan was interested in his culture as he held out his arm, \u201cHold out yours.\u201d Dan did, sitting back to hold his arm out.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s a common greeting with vampires. You press the pulse of your wrist to the others, and hold the wrist, sort of like a handshake,\u201d he smiled and pressed his wrist to Dan\u2019s, softly holding his forearm. \u201cUsually the more powerful vampire extends the greeting, as a sign of authority, so I did because we inhabit this area, which means no others are supposed to settle or hunt here without my blessing.\u201d He smiled.<br><br>Dan gripped his wrist, fascinated with the feeling his own pulse against Phil\u2019s still wrist.<br><br>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t have a pulse but you do. That\u2019s a male greeting,\u201d Phil smiled, \u201cWith a female, you kiss the back of her hand if she has a mate,\u201d he lifted Dan\u2019s hand and kissed the back of his hand, \u201cand the pulse point of her wrist if she doesn\u2019t.\u201d He pressed a kiss to Dan\u2019s wrist.<br><br>Dan watched, \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d He lifted Phil\u2019s wrist up and kissed the back of his hand, and Phil repeated the action with a fond smile. \u201cI like that you\u2019re so interested in my kind.\u201d<br><br>Dan grinned, \u201cWell if my mate\u2019s a vampire, and there\u2019s a chance my pups could be vampires, I would like to understand the culture.\u201d Phil smiled at the admission, his chest swelling with the realisation Dan was very serious about him, and them. \u201cSo you\u2019re okay with the possibility that our future pups could be part vampire?\u201d<br><br>Dan smiled confidently, \u201cOr whole vampire,\u201d he put his hand to Phil\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad, and they won\u2019t be either.\u201d<br><br>Phil smiled and pecked Dan\u2019s palm softly, \u201cIf they have part of you in them they\u2019ll be wonderful.\u201d <br><br>Dan flushed then giggled, as he moved forward and claimed Phil\u2019s lips affectionately, pleased when Phil kissed back, cupping his face.<br><br>Dan shuffled into his lap, then he pulled back. \u201cI\u2019ll be going into heat in the next couple days.\u201d<br><br>Phil nodded, kissing his mate\u2019s forehead. \u201cI know, and I know that Sam doesn\u2019t think I can look after you, and keep you safe. But I can.\u201d<br><br>Dan nodded, \u201cI know you can. And it\u2019s better for me, that I\u2019m not sharing it with an alpha wolf. You\u2019re not like Sam, not like the pack. You can control yourself, you can hold me and comfort me, without giving in to your urges.\u201d<br><br>Phil smiled, holding him close to his body and cuddling him. \u201cI can, and I\u2019ve been learning from the other wolves. Sarah, a sweet omega wolf taught me some bits, about heats. I\u2019ll be there for you.\u201d<br><br>Dan looked up with fond eyes, \u201cI want to share it with you, but- not in the traditional way. Not just yet, I need a little more time.\u201d He admitted nervously.<br><br>Phil looked up to meet soft brown eyes, \u201cI\u2019ll give you all the time you need love.\u201d<br><br>Dan smiled then, curling into his mate\u2019s chest with a content, quiet purr. Even then, he knew he\u2019d made the right decision in Phil.</p>",

So tonight they\u2019d ventured out to the local human town, roaming the streets looking as normal as possible. Phil had given Dan clothes to wear, he wasn\u2019t fond of the jeans or shoes as they restricted him, but he quite enjoyed the big green jumper which smelled like Phil.<br><br>Phil had his arm around his shoulders as they looked around the small streets. They needed somewhere discreet to pick off a meal, where they wouldn\u2019t be seen. The best bet was a dark alley, or near the edge of town by the forest.<br><br>They were in a small area of grass and trees laid out in the town, Phil told him it was something called a park. It was here Dan stopped, sniffing at the air, then let his ears prick and listened closely, standing deadly still. Phil looked at him with a tilt of his head, \u201cNot humans?\u201d He asked, eyes scanning the small area.<br><br>Dan scanned the area with sharp eyes, then slipping yellow as he sensed them approaching. \u201cThree. I don\u2019t know what they are yet.\u201d<br><br>\u201cLet me scout the area, stay here.\u201d Phil hummed, swiftly darting around, perching from a tree.<br><br>Vampires. Three, as Dan said. They didn\u2019t seem to be a threat as far as he could tell for now. He returned to Dan\u2019s side, \u201cVampires.\u201d<br><br>Dan didn\u2019t look overly worried, but he was a little concerned. \u201cThreatening?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNot as far as I can tell, it\u2019s a smaller group, likely part of larger pack somewhere outside of town.\u201d Phil shook his head.<br><br>\u201cYou call them packs?\u201d Dan asked curiously. Phil shook his head, \u201cA group of vampires is called a clan or a coven. I just call them packs now out of habit, thanks to you\u201d he smiled.<br><br>Dan smiled at the new knowledge, then looked sharply at the trees. \u201cThey\u2019re approaching us.\u201d<br><br>Phil moved to his side, eyes landing on the tree line where three vampires emerged. Two men, and one woman. All three were pale as paper, with eyes rich in colour. Dan\u2019s ears flattened to his hair, but he knew better than to growl, instead holding a steady gaze. Meanwhile, Phil\u2019s own stance was defensive, standing tall with his shoulders broadened as they approached.<br><br>The oldest looking of the three, Phil presumed him to have been in his early 40s when he changed, stepped forward. He inspected the three vampires, his eyebrow raised. It couldn\u2019t be? \u201cDavid?\u201d He stepped forward, shoulders dropping only slightly.<br><br>Dan\u2019s eyes flicked to Phil when he said the elder\u2019s name. The vampire he now knew as David grinned, \u201cPhil! Long time no see old friend.\u201d<br><br>Phil smiled and stepped up, \u201cA long time indeed! You\u2019re a bit far from your old territory my friend.\u201d He offered his wrist, a common vampire greeting was the pressing together of the \u2018pulse\u2019, substituting a human handshake. But by being the first to extend the greeting, and having his hand dominate the handshake subtly, he was politely acknowledging his \u201cclaim\u201d over this area of territory.<br><br>His friend smiled, \u201cOnly passing through don\u2019t trouble yourself. You\u2019ve met Carry, haven\u2019t you? And this little lad is James.\u201d He gestured to the youngest of their troop, no older the 16. Dan watched with caution, confused. They all looked such different ages, he thought they stopped ageing.<br><br>Phil smiled and nodded. \u201cWonderful.\u201d He looked at the other two, \u201cI have, it\u2019s nice to see you again Carry, you look well, much better than when we met last.\u201d He took her hand and kissed it warmly, a simple greeting for females. Phil ruffled the blonde locks of the smaller vampire, \u201cThe son you wanted.\u201d He smiled warmly. \u201cHe\u2019s ageing well.\u201d<br><br>Dan ruffled up when Phil kissed the female\u2019s hand, clearly displeased with the action. The younger, James, was staring at him, particularly his ears.<br><br>David chuckled, \u201cYes indeed, on death\u2019s door so thought I\u2019d give him a breath of life, or unlife anyway.\u201d David glanced at Dan, \u201cYour werewolf seems displeased.\u201d<br><br>Phil chuckled and fell back to Dan\u2019s side, ruffling his ears fondly. \u201cWolves are fairly possessive of their pack and their mate.\u201d He smiled, \u201cThis is Dan, Dan this is David, a friend from long ago. He was Carry\u2019s mentor and now partner, and their son, James.\u201d Phil gestured to each vampire in turn.<br><br>Dan relaxed when he realised the female and male were a mated pair. She was no threat to him, so instead his interest peaked. \u201cHi.\u201d<br><br>David smiled, \u201cHello Daniel, managed to drag Phil out of his isolation I see.\u201d Dan shot Phil a confused look, and Phil cast his eyes back the elder vampire, \u201cThis again, David?\u201d He raised his brow in amusement.<br><br>David shrugged, \u201cYou have been avoiding all contact with\u2026 anyone really, for nearly 50 years Phil.\u201d Phil shrugged his shoulders, \u201cOnce I left my family, then my clan, associating with others often brought nothing but bad karma.\u201d<br><br>Dan frowned but held his tongue on the questioning for now. The youngest walked up to him, and Dan watched him with careful eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re ears look so soft.\u201d The boy commented, but Dan wasn\u2019t really sure how to respond.<br><br>Phil moved beside James wearily, he sensed no threat from the child but was cautious in any case. He met eyes with Dan, trying to convey that there was no threat.<br><br>Dan relaxed a little at the reassurance. \u201cCan I touch them?\u201d The boy asked Dan, pulled a weary face, \u201c I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d<br><br>Phil placed a soft arm on the young vampire\u2019s arm, \u201cIn this case, best not to young vampire, we don\u2019t want any mishaps, not do we?\u201d <br><br>James pouted, but refrained anyway with a nod, returning to his father who was laughing. \u201cNow now James, you wouldn\u2019t like it if a stranger touched your ears now would you?\u201d<br><br>Phil smiled at the elder, grateful of his understanding. \u201cHe\u2019s progressing well for such a young one David.\u201d He complimented warmly. David grinned proudly, \u201cHe has a good mentor clearly.\u201d You\u2019ve moved on then at last, with Dan here?\u201d The man asked, not unkindly, but Dan sensed it was a personal question.<br><br>Phil cast eyes at the ground, then nodded slowly. \u201cI have. Sometimes fate intervenes, I believe.\u201d When he looked up again, he seemed thoughtful. David was silent for a long moment, then smiled, \u201cWell then, fate has been kind to you my friend, in the end at least.\u201d<br><br>Phil smiled, \u201cIndeed.\u201d He stood tall again, the subject changed. \u201cHas there been any word of the old coven? You\u2019re the first I\u2019ve come across in many years.\u201d<br><br>David chuckled, \u201cThat would be because you hide in the woods, where vampires belong in the city.\u201d He winked, \u201cBut they are well, some miss your presence more than others I\u2019m sure.\u201d<br><br>Phil hummed, \u201cThere\u2019s too much chaos in the city. Humans and hunters are far more advanced than they were years ago.\u201d He chuckled. David shrugged, \u201cBrings a little challenge to unliving.\u201d <br><br>Carry spoke up for the first time, \u201cDo you and the wolf lay together?\u201d It was a rather abrupt question, it didn\u2019t seem rude necessarily, more curious and Phil blinked at the suddenness of the question, and turned to her. \u201cYes, we do.\u201d He nodded.<br><br>She blinked, \u201cI\u2019ve not heard of that happening before.\u201d David laughed, \u201cOf course it has, just not for a while, we don\u2019t generally mix well as species.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not hugely common, between the vampire and werewolf species, often they are very hostile towards each other.\u201d Phil smiled, \u201cbut it does happen.\u201d Carry nodded, \u201cYou plan on remaining coupled?\u201d<br><br>Dan ruffled up again. He didn\u2019t particularly like being to the subject of her conversation without actually being addressed directly. Phil must have noticed, as he moved back to his side, dropping his arm around Dan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYes, as long as Dan wishes to,\u201d Dan leaned into the touch, relaxing a little.<br><br>David grinned, \u201cWell then good luck my friend. We wish to hunt here if that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d<br><br>Phil smiled, and nodded, \u201cFeel free. I just ask that you be discreet. We wish to keep our presence in the area as unknown as possible.\u201d David nodded, \u201cOf course, you wish to be left to your peace again?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYes, but please do feel free to stop by if you\u2019re passing through again in future. It has been wonderful to see you, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d he smiled. David moved forward and gripped his arm again. \u201cSee again my friend, hopefully within the next century.\u201d<br><br>Phil gripped his arm in response, \u201cI hope so,\u201d he smiled genuinely.<br><br>Dan watched the interaction with curiosity, then the vampires wonder off their own way.<br><br>Phil let his shoulder relax once they were gone, a small sigh of relief as Dan pressed into his side, \u201cHow\u2019d you know him?\u201d Phil nuzzled his hair softly, \u201cWe were in the same coven all those years ago.\u201d He hummed.<br><br>Dan looked up, \u201cWhat\u2019s a vampire coven like?\u201d<br><br>Phil thought for a minute, \u201cIt has its ups and down. They\u2019ll always have your back and you\u2019ll always be safe. But sometimes they\u2019re very keen to keep to old traditions.\u201d He shrugged softly, fingers carting through Dan\u2019s soft hair and caressing his ears.<br><br>\u201cWhat sort of traditions?\u201d He pressed his head into Phil\u2019s hand.<br><br>Phil smiled, \u201cThey\u2019re very particular about bloodlines, and believe that only vampires should only mate with vampires. Males should only mate with females, and that the opinion of the coven should be the opinion of you. Most of the elders also think that biting for awakening purposes shouldn\u2019t be allowed\u201d he hummed.<br><br>Dan crinkles his nose, \u201cThat\u2019s weird, why can\u2019t males mate?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThey can if they wish too but it\u2019s heavily frowned upon, from the old covens anyway, as two male vampires can\u2019t reproduce. It\u2019s seen as a weakness to the coven, that you\u2019re not producing offspring which can grow up to protect the coven, increase its strength and someday provide more offspring to repeat the process.\u201d He shrugged.<br><br>Dan scoffed, \u201cHow old-fashioned. Two Alphas can\u2019t reproduce but they can mate if they want too, others will keep the pack going.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s very old-fashioned.\u201d Phil shrugged, \u201cThey frowned on many types of mating. Those of the same gender, or those who cross species. Often resorting to violence in extreme cases, usually involving hybrids or humans. I refuse to have any part in it.\u201d He nodded.<br><br>Dan tilted his head, \u201cThey would disprove of some matings then? Of ours?\u201d<br><br>\u201cMost likely, maybe not now, but back then. I don\u2019t care though, I chose my mate, not tradition.\u201d He smiled reassuringly. Dan looked a little conflicted, \u201cBut- I\u2019m separating you from your species.\u201d<br><br>Phil shook his head, pressing a kiss to Dan\u2019s head, \u201cYou aren\u2019t separating me, I separated myself. As a result, I have you.\u201d Dan flushed, pressing in close. \u201cYou said something about hybrids?\u201d<br><br>Phil curled his arms around him warmly, \u201cYeah, when two species find a way to combine,\u201d he hummed, \u201cIt\u2019s uncommon, but it happens.\u201d<br><br>Dan looked up, \u201cIf we had pups, would they be hybrids?\u201d<br><br>Phil considered it for a moment, \u201cThey most likely would be yes, but there\u2019s also a chance that might also be full werewolves, like you. Or full vampires, like me\u201d He smiled. \u201cHybrids pups are much more common than adult hybrids, it\u2019s riskier to become a hybrid as an adult, and can be painful, life-threatening in a lot of cases.\u201d He explained from his knowledge or the subject.<br><br>\u201cOh. So if I were to bite you, properly, you\u2019d turn into a hybrid?\u201d He asked, curious.<br><br>\u201cPretty much, just like if I bit you and chose to inject venom, it would change you. It works similar to if I infect a human, only a human will become a full vampire, not a hybrid.\u201d He nodded.<br><br>Dan nodded, \u201cOkay, come on let\u2019s eat.\u201d He pulled Phil in for a deep kiss, \u201cYou can tell me more at the cabin.\u201d He said wagging his tail as they set off into the tree line.</p><hr><p>Phil sunk down into the sofa once they returned to the cabin, a content, full feeling in his stomach. The meal would definitely last him a while, leaving him able to get by on animal blood.</p><p><br>Dan climbed into his lap with a little hum, snuggling into his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s was necessary.\u201d Phil nodded his agreement and played softly with Dan\u2019s hair. \u201cIt definitely was.\u201d<br><br>Dan sat up, \u201cWhat\u2019s the greeting you did? With David?\u201d Phil smiled, pleased that Dan was interested in his culture as he held out his arm, \u201cHold out yours.\u201d Dan did, sitting back to hold his arm out.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s a common greeting with vampires. You press the pulse of your wrist to the others, and hold the wrist, sort of like a handshake,\u201d he smiled and pressed his wrist to Dan\u2019s, softly holding his forearm. \u201cUsually the more powerful vampire extends the greeting, as a sign of authority, so I did because we inhabit this area, which means no others are supposed to settle or hunt here without my blessing.\u201d He smiled.<br><br>Dan gripped his wrist, fascinated with the feeling his own pulse against Phil\u2019s still wrist.<br><br>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t have a pulse but you do. That\u2019s a male greeting,\u201d Phil smiled, \u201cWith a female, you kiss the back of her hand if she has a mate,\u201d he lifted Dan\u2019s hand and kissed the back of his hand, \u201cand the pulse point of her wrist if she doesn\u2019t.\u201d He pressed a kiss to Dan\u2019s wrist.<br><br>Dan watched, \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d He lifted Phil\u2019s wrist up and kissed the back of his hand, and Phil repeated the action with a fond smile. \u201cI like that you\u2019re so interested in my kind.\u201d<br><br>Dan grinned, \u201cWell if my mate\u2019s a vampire, and there\u2019s a chance my pups could be vampires, I would like to understand the culture.\u201d Phil smiled at the admission, his chest swelling with the realisation Dan was very serious about him, and them. \u201cSo you\u2019re okay with the possibility that our future pups could be part vampire?\u201d<br><br>Dan smiled confidently, \u201cOr whole vampire,\u201d he put his hand to Phil\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad, and they won\u2019t be either.\u201d<br><br>Phil smiled and pecked Dan\u2019s palm softly, \u201cIf they have part of you in them they\u2019ll be wonderful.\u201d <br><br>Dan flushed then giggled, as he moved forward and claimed Phil\u2019s lips affectionately, pleased when Phil kissed back, cupping his face.<br><br>Dan shuffled into his lap, then he pulled back. \u201cI\u2019ll be going into heat in the next couple days.\u201d<br><br>Phil nodded, kissing his mate\u2019s forehead. \u201cI know, and I know that Sam doesn\u2019t think I can look after you, and keep you safe. But I can.\u201d<br><br>Dan nodded, \u201cI know you can. And it\u2019s better for me, that I\u2019m not sharing it with an alpha wolf. You\u2019re not like Sam, not like the pack. You can control yourself, you can hold me and comfort me, without giving in to your urges.\u201d<br><br>Phil smiled, holding him close to his body and cuddling him. \u201cI can, and I\u2019ve been learning from the other wolves. Sarah, a sweet omega wolf taught me some bits, about heats. I\u2019ll be there for you.\u201d<br><br>Dan looked up with fond eyes, \u201cI want to share it with you, but- not in the traditional way. Not just yet, I need a little more time.\u201d He admitted nervously.<br><br>Phil looked up to meet soft brown eyes, \u201cI\u2019ll give you all the time you need love.\u201d<br><br>Dan smiled then, curling into his mate\u2019s chest with a content, quiet purr. Even then, he knew he\u2019d made the right decision in Phil.</p>",

So tonight they&rsquo;d ventured out to the local human town, roaming the streets looking as normal as possible. Phil had given Dan clothes to wear, he wasn&rsquo;t fond of the jeans or shoes as they restricted him, but he quite enjoyed the big green jumper which smelled like Phil.<br /><br />Phil had his arm around his shoulders as they looked around the small streets. They needed somewhere discreet to pick off a meal, where they wouldn&rsquo;t be seen. The best bet was a dark alley, or near the edge of town by the forest.<br /><br />They were in a small area of grass and trees laid out in the town, Phil told him it was something called a park. It was here Dan stopped, sniffing at the air, then let his ears prick and listened closely, standing deadly still. Phil looked at him with a tilt of his head, &ldquo;Not humans?&rdquo; He asked, eyes scanning the small area.<br /><br />Dan scanned the area with sharp eyes, then slipping yellow as he sensed them approaching. &ldquo;Three. I don&rsquo;t know what they are yet.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Let me scout the area, stay here.&rdquo; Phil hummed, swiftly darting around, perching from a tree.<br /><br />Vampires. Three, as Dan said. They didn&rsquo;t seem to be a threat as far as he could tell for now. He returned to Dan&rsquo;s side, &ldquo;Vampires.&rdquo;<br /><br />Dan didn&rsquo;t look overly worried, but he was a little concerned. &ldquo;Threatening?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Not as far as I can tell, it&rsquo;s a smaller group, likely part of larger pack somewhere outside of town.&rdquo; Phil shook his head.<br /><br />&ldquo;You call them packs?&rdquo; Dan asked curiously. Phil shook his head, &ldquo;A group of vampires is called a clan or a coven. I just call them packs now out of habit, thanks to you&rdquo; he smiled.<br /><br />Dan smiled at the new knowledge, then looked sharply at the trees. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re approaching us.&rdquo;<br /><br />Phil moved to his side, eyes landing on the tree line where three vampires emerged. Two men, and one woman. All three were pale as paper, with eyes rich in colour. Dan&rsquo;s ears flattened to his hair, but he knew better than to growl, instead holding a steady gaze. Meanwhile, Phil&rsquo;s own stance was defensive, standing tall with his shoulders broadened as they approached.<br /><br />The oldest looking of the three, Phil presumed him to have been in his early 40s when he changed, stepped forward. He inspected the three vampires, his eyebrow raised. It couldn&rsquo;t be? &ldquo;David?&rdquo; He stepped forward, shoulders dropping only slightly.<br /><br />Dan&rsquo;s eyes flicked to Phil when he said the elder&rsquo;s name. The vampire he now knew as David grinned, &ldquo;Phil! Long time no see old friend.&rdquo;<br /><br />Phil smiled and stepped up, &ldquo;A long time indeed! You&rsquo;re a bit far from your old territory my friend.&rdquo; He offered his wrist, a common vampire greeting was the pressing together of the &lsquo;pulse&rsquo;, substituting a human handshake. But by being the first to extend the greeting, and having his hand dominate the handshake subtly, he was politely acknowledging his &ldquo;claim&rdquo; over this area of territory.<br /><br />His friend smiled, &ldquo;Only passing through don&rsquo;t trouble yourself. You&rsquo;ve met Carry, haven&rsquo;t you? And this little lad is James.&rdquo; He gestured to the youngest of their troop, no older the 16. Dan watched with caution, confused. They all looked such different ages, he thought they stopped ageing.<br /><br />Phil smiled and nodded. &ldquo;Wonderful.&rdquo; He looked at the other two, &ldquo;I have, it&rsquo;s nice to see you again Carry, you look well, much better than when we met last.&rdquo; He took her hand and kissed it warmly, a simple greeting for females. Phil ruffled the blonde locks of the smaller vampire, &ldquo;The son you wanted.&rdquo; He smiled warmly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s ageing well.&rdquo;<br /><br />Dan ruffled up when Phil kissed the female&rsquo;s hand, clearly displeased with the action. The younger, James, was staring at him, particularly his ears.<br /><br />David chuckled, &ldquo;Yes indeed, on death&rsquo;s door so thought I&rsquo;d give him a breath of life, or unlife anyway.&rdquo; David glanced at Dan, &ldquo;Your werewolf seems displeased.&rdquo;<br /><br />Phil chuckled and fell back to Dan&rsquo;s side, ruffling his ears fondly. &ldquo;Wolves are fairly possessive of their pack and their mate.&rdquo; He smiled, &ldquo;This is Dan, Dan this is David, a friend from long ago. He was Carry&rsquo;s mentor and now partner, and their son, James.&rdquo; Phil gestured to each vampire in turn.<br /><br />Dan relaxed when he realised the female and male were a mated pair. She was no threat to him, so instead his interest peaked. &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;<br /><br />David smiled, &ldquo;Hello Daniel, managed to drag Phil out of his isolation I see.&rdquo; Dan shot Phil a confused look, and Phil cast his eyes back the elder vampire, &ldquo;This again, David?&rdquo; He raised his brow in amusement.<br /><br />David shrugged, &ldquo;You have been avoiding all contact with&hellip; anyone really, for nearly 50 years Phil.&rdquo; Phil shrugged his shoulders, &ldquo;Once I left my family, then my clan, associating with others often brought nothing but bad karma.&rdquo;<br /><br />Dan frowned but held his tongue on the questioning for now. The youngest walked up to him, and Dan watched him with careful eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re ears look so soft.&rdquo; The boy commented, but Dan wasn&rsquo;t really sure how to respond.<br /><br />Phil moved beside James wearily, he sensed no threat from the child but was cautious in any case. He met eyes with Dan, trying to convey that there was no threat.<br /><br />Dan relaxed a little at the reassurance. &ldquo;Can I touch them?&rdquo; The boy asked Dan, pulled a weary face, &ldquo; I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br /><br />Phil placed a soft arm on the young vampire&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;In this case, best not to young vampire, we don&rsquo;t want any mishaps, not do we?&rdquo; <br /><br />James pouted, but refrained anyway with a nod, returning to his father who was laughing. &ldquo;Now now James, you wouldn&rsquo;t like it if a stranger touched your ears now would you?&rdquo;<br /><br />Phil smiled at the elder, grateful of his understanding. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s progressing well for such a young one David.&rdquo; He complimented warmly. David grinned proudly, &ldquo;He has a good mentor clearly.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ve moved on then at last, with Dan here?&rdquo; The man asked, not unkindly, but Dan sensed it was a personal question.<br /><br />Phil cast eyes at the ground, then nodded slowly. &ldquo;I have.

It has been wonderful to see you, I&rsquo;ve missed you.&rdquo; he smiled. David moved forward and gripped his arm again. &ldquo;See again my friend, hopefully within the next century.&rdquo;<br /><br />Phil gripped his arm in response, &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; he smiled genuinely.<br /><br />Dan watched the interaction with curiosity, then the vampires wonder off their own way.<br /><br />Phil let his shoulder relax once they were gone, a small sigh of relief as Dan pressed into his side, &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know him?&rdquo; Phil nuzzled his hair softly, &ldquo;We were in the same coven all those years ago.&rdquo; He hummed.<br /><br />Dan looked up, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a vampire coven like?&rdquo;<br /><br />Phil thought for a minute, &ldquo;It has its ups and down.

As a result, I have you.&rdquo; Dan flushed, pressing in close. &ldquo;You said something about hybrids?&rdquo;<br /><br />Phil curled his arms around him warmly, &ldquo;Yeah, when two species find a way to combine,&rdquo; he hummed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s uncommon, but it happens.&rdquo;<br /><br />Dan looked up, &ldquo;If we had pups, would they be hybrids?&rdquo;<br /><br />Phil considered it for a moment, &ldquo;They most likely would be yes, but there&rsquo;s also a chance that might also be full werewolves, like you. Or full vampires, like me&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;Hybrids pups are much more common than adult hybrids, it&rsquo;s riskier to become a hybrid as an adult, and can be painful, life-threatening in a lot of cases.&rdquo; He explained from his knowledge or the subject.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh. So if I were to bite you, properly, you&rsquo;d turn into a hybrid?&rdquo; He asked, curious.<br /><br />&ldquo;Pretty much, just like if I bit you and chose to inject venom, it would change you. It works similar to if I infect a human, only a human will become a full vampire, not a hybrid.&rdquo; He nodded.<br /><br />Dan nodded, &ldquo;Okay, come on let&rsquo;s eat.&rdquo; He pulled Phil in for a deep kiss, &ldquo;You can tell me more at the cabin.&rdquo; He said wagging his tail as they set off into the tree line.</p><hr /><p>Phil sunk down into the sofa once they returned to the cabin, a content, full feeling in his stomach. The meal would definitely last him a while, leaving him able to get by on animal blood.</p><p><br />Dan climbed into his lap with a little hum, snuggling into his neck. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s was necessary.&rdquo; Phil nodded his agreement and played softly with Dan&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;It definitely was.&rdquo;<br /><br />Dan sat up, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the greeting you did? With David?&rdquo; Phil smiled, pleased that Dan was interested in his culture as he held out his arm, &ldquo;Hold out yours.&rdquo; Dan did, sitting back to hold his arm out.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a common greeting with vampires. You press the pulse of your wrist to the others, and hold the wrist, sort of like a handshake,&rdquo; he smiled and pressed his wrist to Dan&rsquo;s, softly holding his forearm. &ldquo;Usually the more powerful vampire extends the greeting, as a sign of authority, so I did because we inhabit this area, which means no others are supposed to settle or hunt here without my blessing.&rdquo; He smiled.<br /><br />Dan gripped his wrist, fascinated with the feeling his own pulse against Phil&rsquo;s still wrist.<br /><br />&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t have a pulse but you do. That&rsquo;s a male greeting,&rdquo; Phil smiled, &ldquo;With a female, you kiss the back of her hand if she has a mate,&rdquo; he lifted Dan&rsquo;s hand and kissed the back of his hand, &ldquo;and the pulse point of her wrist if she doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He pressed a kiss to Dan&rsquo;s wrist.<br /><br />Dan watched, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting.&rdquo; He lifted Phil&rsquo;s wrist up and kissed the back of his hand, and Phil repeated the action with a fond smile. &ldquo;I like that you&rsquo;re so interested in my kind.&rdquo;<br /><br />Dan grinned, &ldquo;Well if my mate&rsquo;s a vampire, and there&rsquo;s a chance my pups could be vampires, I would like to understand the culture.&rdquo; Phil smiled at the admission, his chest swelling with the realisation Dan was very serious about him, and them. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re okay with the possibility that our future pups could be part vampire?&rdquo;<br /><br />Dan smiled confidently, &ldquo;Or whole vampire,&rdquo; he put his hand to Phil&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so bad, and they won&rsquo;t be either.&rdquo;<br /><br />Phil smiled and pecked Dan&rsquo;s palm softly, &ldquo;If they have part of you in them they&rsquo;ll be wonderful.&rdquo; <br /><br />Dan flushed then giggled, as he moved forward and claimed Phil&rsquo;s lips affectionately, pleased when Phil kissed back, cupping his face.<br /><br />Dan shuffled into his lap, then he pulled back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be going into heat in the next couple days.&rdquo;<br /><br />Phil nodded, kissing his mate&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;I know, and I know that Sam doesn&rsquo;t think I can look after you, and keep you safe. But I can.&rdquo;<br /><br />Dan nodded, &ldquo;I know you can. And it&rsquo;s better for me, that I&rsquo;m not sharing it with an alpha wolf. You&rsquo;re not like Sam, not like the pack. You can control yourself, you can hold me and comfort me, without giving in to your urges.&rdquo;<br /><br />Phil smiled, holding him close to his body and cuddling him. &ldquo;I can, and I&rsquo;ve been learning from the other wolves. Sarah, a sweet omega wolf taught me some bits, about heats. I&rsquo;ll be there for you.&rdquo;<br /><br />Dan looked up with fond eyes, &ldquo;I want to share it with you, but- not in the traditional way. Not just yet, I need a little more time.&rdquo; He admitted nervously.<br /><br />Phil looked up to meet soft brown eyes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you all the time you need love.&rdquo;<br /><br />Dan smiled then, curling into his mate&rsquo;s chest with a content, quiet purr. Even then, he knew he&rsquo;d made the right decision in Phil.</p>",
