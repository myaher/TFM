I suspect he knows exactly how to handle a baby and is putting on a show both for the Inquisitors and himself - since he does everything via the Force - commanding it silent with the Force, levitating it in the Force so he doesn&rsquo;t have to touch it -\u00a0(Well - not *exactly* how to handle one. But he must know this is not the way.)\u00a0</div></blockquote><blockquote><div>Which is sort of interesting - he handles the baby as impersonally as he handles the suit and most everything else. Not even the battle with Eeth Koth really seemed to interest him (once he realized he was no longer a Jedi? idk), if his killing the guy while he was distracted by the sight of his child is any indication. Idk I&rsquo;m very meh about this issue.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div>It was as though he killed EK that way - right at the moment he sees his child in the hands of an Inquisitor - to prove his last words wrong - he cannot protect his family. Making that point seems to have outweighed any desire for battle. Gah that&rsquo;s more than enough from me<br/></div></blockquote><p>Which raises the question: How much of what Vader does just theatrics and for show? How much of it is an act Anakin is putting on, for his \u201cbenefit\u201d or for the people around him. Is this is part of why he is so obsessed with distinguishing Anakin and Vader as two separate entities, in claiming that Anakin is fully dead? Not to mention of course, at the end of the day, how much does any of this really matter given the stark horror of the acts Vader commits?</p><p>And yeah, I really hear you on that. That\u2019s also why I keep changing my mind about if I want to connect this reply to the scans btw (in case you were wondering why I keep changing how this is formatted). Because I find the questions your observations here raise waaaay more interesting than the issue itself.</p><p>Which is odd, as you\u2019d think a Jedi Master who once sat on the council telling Vader he left that behind and is a husband and a father now, and he will do anything to protect his wife and child - and Vader\u2019s subsequent execution of him - would be way more interesting than it actually was.</p><p>As for you most recent reply that I am very !!! over. Oh gosh, wow. Ok, I am going to pull up some scans from the battle now.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1091\" data-orig-height=\"759\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5746a365d5b9897f2f19dee2e248db0f/tumblr_inline_pd59cguOYt1qgczrc_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1091\" data-orig-height=\"759\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"865\" data-orig-height=\"767\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6496a070bcf5a740ec18719cfd06f4a/tumblr_inline_pd59crq0AZ1qgczrc_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"865\" data-orig-height=\"767\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"538\" data-orig-height=\"615\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b219c557090539d085a9272a03058d1/tumblr_inline_pd59cxNi2e1qgczrc_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"538\" data-orig-height=\"615\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"712\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4bdf180539648ca7cde3b3a129f692a4/tumblr_inline_pd59d5pWRl1qgczrc_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"712\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p>Thinking about it more, there is a refusal to really connect with any of this, to consider what is taking place, instead he must block it out because everything about this situation should be so very personal for Vader. It should be hitting him close to home, and yet he refuses to let it. The fact he can not and will not treat the newborn like a living thing, but rather an object to be controlled with the Force reinforces that.</p><p>These are matters <i>Anakin</i> would understand, not Vader.

This one goes out to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL_eUii_CQbdzoyuVvC-dDQ\">@otterandterrier</a> who got this stuck in my head as a Scoundress song.</i></p><hr><p>They were on the run, again. It was almost a constant these\ndays, like no mission would be complete without including at least one mad dash\nfor their lives.</p><p>As they rounded the corner, Han marveled a little at how\nwell Leia could keep up, given the length of his legs compared to hers. And\ngiven that he\u2019d been on the run nearly his entire life.</p><p>Leia slowed briefly to pick off two of the closest troopers\u2014<i>pew! pew!</i>\u2014then ramped up her pace again\nto catch up with Han. </p><p>His comm buzzed. \u201cLittle busy here, Kid,\u201d he said to Luke.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine, just gotta lose some friends. Yeah, good idea. We\u2019ll catch up.\u201d He\nand Leia ducked down an alley, one Han hoped wouldn\u2019t be another dead end. </p><p>He\u2019d have to remind Luke to downplay this little detour when\nthey got back to base. They\u2019d only recently managed to spring Leia from the\ncage High Command had tried to keep her in after she\u2019d refused to go into\nhiding, and hearing about yet another close brush with Imperial troops might inspire\nthem to ground her again. </p><p>Which would be colossally stupid. Not only was Leia a hell\nof an asset in the field, but confining her to the supply closet again would\njust be a different kind of death sentence. Not that most of them could see\nthat.</p><p>\u201cHa-ha!\u201d Han exclaimed with relief. Not only was the alley free\nand clear, but there was an extra bonus waiting for them\u2014an unattended speeder\nbike. Now they could really make up some time. </p><p>Hotwiring the starter was a quick job, and Han was about to\ntell Leia to hop on when he caught sight of the look she was giving the bike.\nIt was almost\u2014<i>hungry</i>. <br/></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYou know how to drive one of these?\u201d he asked her, and the\nhungry look became a stone-faced glare directed at him.\u00a0 He shook his head. \u201cStupid question.\nI\u2019ll shoot,\u201d he said, and he\u2019d barely gotten on behind her when she took off.</p><p><i>Holy hells. She drives\ncrazier than I do</i>, he thought, as she snaked them through alleys, between\nbuildings. \u201cHold on!\u201d she yelled, taking another sharp curve. Han\u2019s thighs were\ngripping the speeder for dear life, one hand around Leia\u2019s waist and the other\nfiring at the troopers following them.</p><p>Leia\u2019s driving was like\u2014Leia. The best of Leia. Bold, a\nlittle reckless, but with a surprising amount of strategy and control. Always a\nfew steps ahead.</p><p>It was wild. They were wild, screaming through the\nboulevards on their way back to the ship, dodging blaster bolts and hearing the\nwind whip past them at every turn. <br/></p><hr><p>In between blasts, Han had somehow managed to get Luke on\nthe comm. </p><p>\u201cHe made it to Chewie. They\u2019re bringing the <i>Falcon</i> closer,\u201d he yelled in Leia\u2019s ear.\n\u201cOther side of the\u2014<i>the hell</i>?\u201d</p><p>Leia saw it at the same time: looming straight ahead, a\ntraveling fair with a small amusement park, crowded with beings. Both the\nperfect place to throw off their pursuers, and the worst possible place to lead\na pack of Imperial troops. </p><p>She made a hard left, heard Han swear behind her but knew he\nwas still holding on. They needed a hiding place, somewhere to stash the bike\nwhile they blended in among the fair-goers.</p><p>No question this situation was serious business, but Leia\ncouldn\u2019t help feeling a bit exhilarated at the chase. She\u2019d felt wild, free,\nthe speeder bike and the blaster like a part of her being, secure in the\nknowledge that Han was by her side\u2014or in the present case, right behind her\u2014at\nevery turn.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he pointed out, like he\u2019d anticipated what she was\ngoing to do next. She followed his gesture to a small bend off one of the\nalleys ahead and slowed the speeder to a stop.</p><p>\u201cHell of a royal drivin\u2019 school they must\u2019ve had,\u201d Han said,\nand Leia recognized his tone well enough to take it as a compliment. She was\nexamining her hair in the rearview mirror, tucking windblown strands back into\nher braids. \u201cHey, what\u2019re you doin\u2019? No time for primping.\u201d</p><p>She appraised him quickly, recalling how he\u2019d told her\nearlier that she was \u201ctoo polished\u201d to be believable as a fellow smuggler. \u201cYou\nneed to get a little rougher,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cDirty.\u201d</p><p>She flicked a sweaty piece of hair away from his temple. \u201cYou\u2019re\na little too rough to be my date for the fair,\u201d she said. She licked her thumb and rubbed a bit of dirt off his cheek. \u201cNeed to clean up.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d </p><p>But Leia had a new idea. A disguise, of sorts. \u201cGive me your vest,\u201d she said, and\nwhen he did, she put it on over her own. She untucked his shirt, patting it a bit\nwhen she was done. \u201cThere. Now you\u2019re messy with purpose.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, shaking his head. \u201c<i>Now</i> can we go to the fair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d</p><hr><p>It felt so strange to be strolling through the fair, Han\u2019s\narm draped around her shoulders, like they were a couple out on a date. So\nslow. Too slow. Something about running felt better, felt right. </p><p>She used to like lingering in a feeling, taking time to\nabsorb where she was. Savoring it. But there was no savoring back at base, only\ntime. Too much time to fend off the memories that plagued her brain. Too much\ntime for the sadness that overflowed any container in which she tried to hold\nit.</p><p>Here, at least, it was safe to slow down. Han was her\nfriend. He could protect her, she could protect him. And soon enough they\u2019d be\nrunning again.</p><p>They passed the hoverwheel, the \u201cScrambler,\u201d the\nfortune-telling booth. On the other side of the fair was the clearing where the\n<i>Falcon</i> was parked. Just a little ways\nto go, and then they\u2019d be on their way back to base. Another successful\nmission.</p><p>She\u2019d have to remind Luke not to make too much of their\nlittle escape.</p><p>Then she saw one of the agents pursuing them, and\nwithout thinking pulled Han into the closest hiding place she could find.</p><p>\u201cReally playin\u2019 it up, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he joked, and that\u2019s\nwhen she realized she\u2019d pulled him into the kissing booth.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, but directed him with her eyes and\na nod to the space outside the booth. He got it, and nodded.</p><p>His breathing\u2014both of their breathing\u2014suddenly seemed\nimpossibly loud. And Leia was now aware of how very close Han was to her. They were in each other\u2019s air.<br/></p><p>Voices outside the booth came closer, and Leia felt Han\u2019s\narm circle her waist, pulling her to him. His other hand, she knew, was at his\nblaster. She did the same. Pretending couplehood, preparing for battle.<br/></p><p>The voices faded away. Either the agent had left, or he\u2019d\nmanaged to set up a trap for them. Either way, there was only one thing to do.\nHan released her waist, his hazel eyes moving down to her face. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>They burst out of the booth, blasters ready, tearing off\nthrough the rest of the fair, running again. It was madness, it was wild, it\nwas real. It was, in a strange way, joy. They were out on a wire together, the\nclearing just ahead, the troopers behind them again as they broke away from the\ncrowd. </p><p>But Leia no longer cared about the troopers, the danger.\u00a0 </p><p><i>This is what I was\nborn to do. What he was born to do.</i> They were no longer running away, they\nwere running <i>to</i>. To Luke and Chewie, to\nthe <i>Falcon</i>, to the Rebellion, to each\nother. To freedom, to life. <i>Baby, we\u2019ll\nnever go back</i>.</p><hr><blockquote><p><i>Together we can live with the sadness<br/>I\u2019ll love you with all the madness in my soul</i><br/>&ndash;Bruce Springsteen, \u201cBorn to Run\u201d<br/></p></blockquote>",

Another successful\nmission.</p><p>She&rsquo;d have to remind Luke not to make too much of their\nlittle escape.</p><p>Then she saw one of the agents pursuing them, and\nwithout thinking pulled Han into the closest hiding place she could find.</p><p>&ldquo;Really playin&rsquo; it up, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he joked, and that&rsquo;s\nwhen she realized she&rsquo;d pulled him into the kissing booth.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t say anything, but directed him with her eyes and\na nod to the space outside the booth. He got it, and nodded.</p><p>His breathing&mdash;both of their breathing&mdash;suddenly seemed\nimpossibly loud. And Leia was now aware of how very close Han was to her. They were in each other&rsquo;s air.<br /></p><p>Voices outside the booth came closer, and Leia felt Han&rsquo;s\narm circle her waist, pulling her to him. His other hand, she knew, was at his\nblaster. She did the same. Pretending couplehood, preparing for battle.<br /></p><p>The voices faded away. Either the agent had left, or he&rsquo;d\nmanaged to set up a trap for them. Either way, there was only one thing to do.\nHan released her waist, his hazel eyes moving down to her face. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>They burst out of the booth, blasters ready, tearing off\nthrough the rest of the fair, running again. It was madness, it was wild, it\nwas real. It was, in a strange way, joy. They were out on a wire together, the\nclearing just ahead, the troopers behind them again as they broke away from the\ncrowd. </p><p>But Leia no longer cared about the troopers, the danger.&nbsp; </p><p><i>This is what I was\nborn to do. What he was born to do.</i> They were no longer running away, they\nwere running <i>to</i>. To Luke and Chewie, to\nthe <i>Falcon</i>, to the Rebellion, to each\nother. To freedom, to life. <i>Baby, we&rsquo;ll\nnever go back</i>.</p><hr /><blockquote><p><i>Together we can live with the sadness<br />I&rsquo;ll love you with all the madness in my soul</i><br />&ndash;Bruce Springsteen, &ldquo;Born to Run&rdquo;<br /></p></blockquote></p>",

This one goes out to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL_eUii_CQbdzoyuVvC-dDQ\">@otterandterrier</a> who got this stuck in my head as a Scoundress song.</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p>They were on the run, again. It was almost a constant these\ndays, like no mission would be complete without including at least one mad dash\nfor their lives.</p>\n<p>As they rounded the corner, Han marveled a little at how\nwell Leia could keep up, given the length of his legs compared to hers. And\ngiven that he&rsquo;d been on the run nearly his entire life.</p>\n<p>Leia slowed briefly to pick off two of the closest troopers&mdash;<i>pew! pew!</i>&mdash;then ramped up her pace again\nto catch up with Han. </p>\n<p>His comm buzzed. &ldquo;Little busy here, Kid,&rdquo; he said to Luke.\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine, just gotta lose some friends. Yeah, good idea. We&rsquo;ll catch up.&rdquo; He\nand Leia ducked down an alley, one Han hoped wouldn&rsquo;t be another dead end. </p>\n<p>He&rsquo;d have to remind Luke to downplay this little detour when\nthey got back to base. They&rsquo;d only recently managed to spring Leia from the\ncage High Command had tried to keep her in after she&rsquo;d refused to go into\nhiding, and hearing about yet another close brush with Imperial troops might inspire\nthem to ground her again. </p>\n<p>Which would be colossally stupid. Not only was Leia a hell\nof an asset in the field, but confining her to the supply closet again would\njust be a different kind of death sentence. Not that most of them could see\nthat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ha-ha!&rdquo; Han exclaimed with relief. Not only was the alley free\nand clear, but there was an extra bonus waiting for them&mdash;an unattended speeder\nbike. Now they could really make up some time. </p>\n<p>Hotwiring the starter was a quick job, and Han was about to\ntell Leia to hop on when he caught sight of the look she was giving the bike.\nIt was almost&mdash;<i>hungry</i>. <br /></p>\n</p>",
