Pepper laughs by follows her husband and the three of them sit on the couch. Peter is sandwiched between his parents. </p><p>Tony hands Peter and Pepper each a spoon, \u201cI think we need to talk.\u201d </p><p>Pepper nods, \u201cI agree.\u201d She looks at Peter, \u201cPeter?\u201d </p><p>Peter tugs on his sleeves, \u201cOkay.\u201d He curls his legs up under him. Pepper puts an arm around Peter, he leans against her. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d Tony can\u2019t help but wonder at how young Peter sounds. </p><p>\u201cWith what you told me on the phone.\u201d Tony says, \u201cYou said some kid said that you&rsquo;re not using our last name because I wouldn\u2019t want it being ruined by you.\u201d Peter flinches, but nods. Tony\u2019s heart breaks for the kid, \u201cPeter, your mom and I love you so much. You know what he said was wrong right?\u201d</p><p>Peter says nothing for a moment, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Peter says quietly, both of his parents are surprised by his words and say nothing. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m an orphan. My parents and-\u201d he takes a sharp breath, \u201cand May all died. Every parent I\u2019ve very had has died.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice breaks and Tony and Pepper are quick to wrap the boy in a tight hug. \u201cI think I\u2019m cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Peter,\u201d Tony says.</p><p>\u201cAnd besides,\u201d Peter continues, \u201cif I have your last name I\u2019ll be the one carrying your legacy, would you really trust me to do that?\u201d Peter looks at Tony with tears in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d Tony says. \u201cYou\u2019re already the heir to our company and you are already so much smarter than me, kid.

This is based on a suggestion from the comments of that fic.\u00a0</b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18561418/chapters/43996276\">Ao3 - romeoandjulietyouwish</a></b></p><p>Peter wakes up on Monday with a groan. He quickly showers and gets dressed. He pads into the kitchen to the smell of blueberry pancakes. In the kitchen, both his parents, Steve, Bruce, and Bucky are all standing around the kitchen talking. Pepper smiles when she sees Peter.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Peter,\u201d Pepper says, \u201cSteve made us all breakfast.\u201d She hands Peter a plate.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom!\u201d Peter says with a smile before thanking Steve and going to sit next to his dad and Bruce.</p><p>As Peter stabs a bit of pancake onto his fork, Peter turns to Tony, \u201cDad, do I have to go to school today?\u201d</p><p>Tony shakes his head, \u201cOf course you do, kid. What kind of parent would I be if I didn\u2019t make you go to school?\u201d</p><p>Pepper comes and stands over Peter\u2019s shoulder, \u201cIs this about the field trip?\u201d She asks kindly. Peter nods. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be alright, everyone has had a few days to think it over.\u201d</p><p>Tony agrees, \u201cListen to your mother, Peter. It\u2019ll be okay, and if it\u2019s you can call us, okay?\u201d Peter nods and finishes up his pancakes.</p><p>Once he is done eating, Peter packs up his things for school, says goodbye to his parents and his uncles and is out the door by 7:00.</p><p>When Peter arrives at school si is immediately ambushed by several different people. They all ask him the same question, are you really Tony Stark\u2019s son. Peter pushes past them as quickly as possible and into the school. By the time Peter reaches his first class, he just wants to go home.</p><p>\u201cYou alright, man?\u201d Ned asks, leaning over to Peter. Peter nods his head and does his best to give Ned a reassuring smile, but he can hear the two girls behind him talking about him.</p><p>Thankfully class starts soon after and he is given a good distraction, plus it forces everyone to stop talking. But then comes attendance. As the teacher runs down the list, Peter anxiously awaits hearing his name.</p><p>\u201cPeter Parker,\u201d the teacher calls.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Peter says as Flash scoffs.</p><p>\u201cParker?\u201d Flash says, \u201cHis last name is Stark.\u201d Flash smirks, \u201cOh, I get it, Stark doesn\u2019t want his last name being ruined by an orphan like Penis.\u201d Flash taunts. Peter squeezes his hands into fists and stares at the grain of the wood on his desk.</p><p>\u201cThat is enough, Mr. Thompsen,\u201d the teacher says before continuing with attendance.</p><p>Ned reaches over and pats Peter comfortably on the shoulder. Peter keeps his head down for the rest of the class and when the bell rings, he books it to his next class with Ned in tow. He throws himself down into his desk in the next class.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d MJ asks, leaning over to Peter.</p><p>Peter shakes his head, \u201cI thought Flash would just leave me alone once he found out my dad was a superhero, but nooooo. Now everyone is talking about me and I can\u2019t control it and Flash probably told everyone that I\u2019m still using my last name instead of Tony\u2019s and it\u2019s all just a huge mess!\u201d Peter exclaims before laying his head down on his desk.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks,\u201d MJ sympathizes. \u201cBut I promise it\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u2019 Peter moans.</p><p>MJ smirks, \u201cBecause I recorded what you just said and sent it to your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Peter exclaims snapping up. \u201cMJ, please please tell me you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d MJ says, but she\u2019s obviously not. MJ checks her phone as Peter groans, \u201cHe\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter cries as the class fills up. He quickly grabs his phone, tells his teacher that he is going to the bathroom, and nearly sprints out of the classroom. The second the door closes Peter pulls out his phone and calls his dad, he picks up on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cDad, please don\u2019t come to school,\u201d Peter says as he pushes the bathroom door open. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Peter?\u201d Tony asks and in the background, Peter can hear the roar of New York traffic.</p><p>\u201cYes, dad, I promise I\u2019m fine,\u201d Peter says, leaning back against the bathroom wall.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Tony laments.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you even going to do when you get here?\u201d Peter asks, crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cYour mom and I going to talk to your principal about his anti-bullying policy,\u201d Tony says, surprise Peter with his rational course of action.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter says. Peter bits his lip and begins to pace the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, buddy?\u201d Tony asks.</p><p>\u201cUm, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Peter takes a breath. \u201cI just can\u2019t get what this kid said out of my head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony says softly, \u201ctalk to me kid. What did they say?\u201d</p><p>Peter takes a shaky breath and presses his shaking hands against his legs, \u201cHe, um, it was during attendance and he was said, um, something about how I was still using my last name and not yours.\u201d Tony is silent for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not all.\u201d Tony responds after a few seconds, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be this upset if that was all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Peter tugs on the hem of his shirt, \u201che said that the reason I wasn\u2019t using your name was because you wouldn\u2019t want it to be, um, ruined by me.\u201d Peter looks down, tears forming at the edge of his eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony says, his voice so soft it\u2019s almost a whisper. \u201cYou know that\u2019s wrong right? I love you, kid. More than anything thing.\u201d</p><p>Peter sniffs, \u201cI love you too.\u201d Peter wipes his eyes, \u201cI need to go back to class. Will I see you when you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, kid,\u201d Tony says and Peter can hear the smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cUm, goodbye, dad,\u201d Peter says.</p><p>\u201cBye kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter shoves his phone into his back pocket. He pinches the bridge of his nose and squeezes his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, are you okay?\u201d A voice says. Peter looks up to see Flash standing in the door of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you care,\u201d Peter says as he stands and pushes past Flash and out the door. He walks back to class and sits back down next to MJ.</p><p>While the teacher drones on, MJ slides a note onto Peter\u2019s desk.</p><p>Are you okay?</p><p>Peter scribbles a quick response and passes it back.</p><p>I\u2019m okay. My parents are still coming.</p><p>MJ signs at his note and passes it back again.</p><p>Then why do you look like you\u2019ve been crying?</p><p>Peter sighs and passes it back.</p><p>I\u2019ll tell you later.</p><p>MJ nods and turns back to pay attention to the teacher. Peter tries his best to pay attention to the class, but his mind keeps going back to what Flash said and his dad\u2019s response.</p><p>\u201cPeter Parker to the front office please,\u201d a voice on the intercom says, \u201cPeter Parker to the office.\u201d</p><p>The class falls silent and turns to look at Peter. The teacher sighs and gestures for Peter to leave. Peter quickly stands up and walks out of the classroom. When he arrives at the front office, he is met by the secretary.</p><p>\u201cHello, Peter,\u201d the secretary greets with a smile. \u201cYou can go into the office, your parents are waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter says and as he pushes open the door to the principal\u2019s office.</p><p>Tony and Pepper stand when Peter opens the door. Pepper hugs Peter, pressing a quick kiss to the top of his head. Peter hugs his dad and Tony guides Peter to sit in the chair next to him. As there are only two chairs, Tony gives Pepper his and sits on the arm of her chair instead.</p><p>\u201cAlright, so why don\u2019t we begin,\u201d Tony says to the principal, who seems quite starstruck.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes,\u201d the principal pretends to look at a paper on his desk, \u201cwhere would you like to begin.\u201d</p><p>Pepper leans forward, \u201cYour anti-bullying policy.\u201d Pepper\u2019s voice is cold, \u201cOur son has been bullied at this school for years and you have done nothing. Peter told us he could handle it so we left it at that. Until the bully came into our home and gave Peter a panic attack because he was talking about Peter\u2019s family.\u201d At that Pepper can see that Peter is getting tense, so she reaches over and takes his hand. \u201cThen this morning we got a call from Peter\u2019s friend that Peter was being bullied during class about his last name.\u201d</p><p>The principal looks scared, as he should, \u201cI must confess that I have not heard anything about this, Mrs. Stark.\u201d Tony scoffs. Pepper gives him a look and he turns it into a cough. \u201cAnd even if I did there is not much I could do about it.\u201d Peter almost feels sorry for the principal, he has been on the receiving end of Pepper\u2019s glare.</p><p>\u201cDoes it not matter to you that our son feels unsafe at your school?\u201d Pepper asks, standing up.</p><p>\u201cOf course it does, I\u2019m just not sure what I can-\u201d the principal is cut off by Tony standing up beside his wife.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to spell it out for you?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cYour policy is not protecting our son and furthermore, he was being bullied while the class was going on and your teachers did nothing. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>The principal gulps, \u201cI do. Um, we are having a staff meeting on Wednesday and I can assure you that we will be revisiting our bullying policy.\u201d Pepper and Tony sit back down, Tony puts his hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWould either of you like to attend?\u201d</p><p>Pepper and Tony exchange a quick glance and Pepper nods, \u201cYes, I will be there.\u201d Pepper and Tony stand up and Peter follows, \u201cThank you for agreeing to this meeting, I will be seeing you on Wednesday.\u201d Pepper nods and turns around, Tony and Peter are quick to follow her. When the door closes behind them, Pepper tugs Peter into a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Pepper asks her warm hands on either side his face.</p><p>Peter nods, \u201cWhy does everyone keep asking me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re worried about you, kid?\u201d Tony says. Peter nods and Tony gives him another hug. He turns to Pepper, \u201cWhat do you say we take him out for the rest of the day?\u201d</p><p>Pepper sighs, her face softening as she looks at her son and husband, \u201cAlright.\u201d After they sign Peter out, the family piles into Tony\u2019s car. Peter sends off a quick text to Ned and MJ and leans against his mom.</p><p>\u201cThanks, mom,\u201d Peter says.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Pepper responds with a smile.</p>",

What did they say?\u201d</p><p>Peter takes a shaky breath and presses his shaking hands against his legs, \u201cHe, um, it was during attendance and he was said, um, something about how I was still using my last name and not yours.\u201d Tony is silent for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not all.\u201d Tony responds after a few seconds, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be this upset if that was all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Peter tugs on the hem of his shirt, \u201che said that the reason I wasn\u2019t using your name was because you wouldn\u2019t want it to be, um, ruined by me.\u201d Peter looks down, tears forming at the edge of his eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony says, his voice so soft it\u2019s almost a whisper. \u201cYou know that\u2019s wrong right? I love you, kid. More than anything thing.\u201d</p><p>Peter sniffs, \u201cI love you too.\u201d Peter wipes his eyes, \u201cI need to go back to class. Will I see you when you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, kid,\u201d Tony says and Peter can hear the smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cUm, goodbye, dad,\u201d Peter says.</p><p>\u201cBye kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter shoves his phone into his back pocket. He pinches the bridge of his nose and squeezes his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, are you okay?\u201d A voice says. Peter looks up to see Flash standing in the door of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you care,\u201d Peter says as he stands and pushes past Flash and out the door. He walks back to class and sits back down next to MJ.</p><p>While the teacher drones on, MJ slides a note onto Peter\u2019s desk.</p><p>Are you okay?</p><p>Peter scribbles a quick response and passes it back.</p><p>I\u2019m okay. My parents are still coming.</p><p>MJ signs at his note and passes it back again.</p><p>Then why do you look like you\u2019ve been crying?</p><p>Peter sighs and passes it back.</p><p>I\u2019ll tell you later.</p><p>MJ nods and turns back to pay attention to the teacher. Peter tries his best to pay attention to the class, but his mind keeps going back to what Flash said and his dad\u2019s response.</p><p>\u201cPeter Parker to the front office please,\u201d a voice on the intercom says, \u201cPeter Parker to the office.\u201d</p><p>The class falls silent and turns to look at Peter. The teacher sighs and gestures for Peter to leave. Peter quickly stands up and walks out of the classroom. When he arrives at the front office, he is met by the secretary.</p><p>\u201cHello, Peter,\u201d the secretary greets with a smile. \u201cYou can go into the office, your parents are waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter says and as he pushes open the door to the principal\u2019s office.</p><p>Tony and Pepper stand when Peter opens the door. Pepper hugs Peter, pressing a quick kiss to the top of his head. Peter hugs his dad and Tony guides Peter to sit in the chair next to him. As there are only two chairs, Tony gives Pepper his and sits on the arm of her chair instead.</p><p>\u201cAlright, so why don\u2019t we begin,\u201d Tony says to the principal, who seems quite starstruck.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes,\u201d the principal pretends to look at a paper on his desk, \u201cwhere would you like to begin.\u201d</p><p>Pepper leans forward, \u201cYour anti-bullying policy.\u201d Pepper\u2019s voice is cold, \u201cOur son has been bullied at this school for years and you have done nothing. Peter told us he could handle it so we left it at that. Until the bully came into our home and gave Peter a panic attack because he was talking about Peter\u2019s family.\u201d At that Pepper can see that Peter is getting tense, so she reaches over and takes his hand. \u201cThen this morning we got a call from Peter\u2019s friend that Peter was being bullied during class about his last name.\u201d</p><p>The principal looks scared, as he should, \u201cI must confess that I have not heard anything about this, Mrs. Stark.\u201d Tony scoffs. Pepper gives him a look and he turns it into a cough. \u201cAnd even if I did there is not much I could do about it.\u201d Peter almost feels sorry for the principal, he has been on the receiving end of Pepper\u2019s glare.</p><p>\u201cDoes it not matter to you that our son feels unsafe at your school?\u201d Pepper asks, standing up.</p><p>\u201cOf course it does, I\u2019m just not sure what I can-\u201d the principal is cut off by Tony standing up beside his wife.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to spell it out for you?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cYour policy is not protecting our son and furthermore, he was being bullied while the class was going on and your teachers did nothing. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>The principal gulps, \u201cI do. Um, we are having a staff meeting on Wednesday and I can assure you that we will be revisiting our bullying policy.\u201d Pepper and Tony sit back down, Tony puts his hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWould either of you like to attend?\u201d</p><p>Pepper and Tony exchange a quick glance and Pepper nods, \u201cYes, I will be there.\u201d Pepper and Tony stand up and Peter follows, \u201cThank you for agreeing to this meeting, I will be seeing you on Wednesday.\u201d Pepper nods and turns around, Tony and Peter are quick to follow her. When the door closes behind them, Pepper tugs Peter into a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Pepper asks her warm hands on either side his face.</p><p>Peter nods, \u201cWhy does everyone keep asking me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re worried about you, kid?\u201d Tony says. Peter nods and Tony gives him another hug. He turns to Pepper, \u201cWhat do you say we take him out for the rest of the day?\u201d</p><p>Pepper sighs, her face softening as she looks at her son and husband, \u201cAlright.\u201d After they sign Peter out, the family piles into Tony\u2019s car. Peter sends off a quick text to Ned and MJ and leans against his mom.</p><p>\u201cThanks, mom,\u201d Peter says.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Pepper responds with a smile.</p>",

He quickly showers and gets dressed. He pads into the kitchen to the smell of blueberry pancakes. In the kitchen, both his parents, Steve, Bruce, and Bucky are all standing around the kitchen talking. Pepper smiles when she sees Peter.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Peter,\u201d Pepper says, \u201cSteve made us all breakfast.\u201d She hands Peter a plate.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom!\u201d Peter says with a smile before thanking Steve and going to sit next to his dad and Bruce.</p><p>As Peter stabs a bit of pancake onto his fork, Peter turns to Tony, \u201cDad, do I have to go to school today?\u201d</p><p>Tony shakes his head, \u201cOf course you do, kid. What kind of parent would I be if I didn\u2019t make you go to school?\u201d</p><p>Pepper comes and stands over Peter\u2019s shoulder, \u201cIs this about the field trip?\u201d She asks kindly. Peter nods. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be alright, everyone has had a few days to think it over.\u201d</p><p>Tony agrees, \u201cListen to your mother, Peter. It\u2019ll be okay, and if it\u2019s you can call us, okay?\u201d Peter nods and finishes up his pancakes.</p><p>Once he is done eating, Peter packs up his things for school, says goodbye to his parents and his uncles and is out the door by 7:00.</p><p>When Peter arrives at school si is immediately ambushed by several different people. They all ask him the same question, are you really Tony Stark\u2019s son. Peter pushes past them as quickly as possible and into the school. By the time Peter reaches his first class, he just wants to go home.</p><p>\u201cYou alright, man?\u201d Ned asks, leaning over to Peter. Peter nods his head and does his best to give Ned a reassuring smile, but he can hear the two girls behind him talking about him.</p><p>Thankfully class starts soon after and he is given a good distraction, plus it forces everyone to stop talking. But then comes attendance. As the teacher runs down the list, Peter anxiously awaits hearing his name.</p><p>\u201cPeter Parker,\u201d the teacher calls.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Peter says as Flash scoffs.</p><p>\u201cParker?\u201d Flash says, \u201cHis last name is Stark.\u201d Flash smirks, \u201cOh, I get it, Stark doesn\u2019t want his last name being ruined by an orphan like Penis.\u201d Flash taunts. Peter squeezes his hands into fists and stares at the grain of the wood on his desk.</p><p>\u201cThat is enough, Mr. Thompsen,\u201d the teacher says before continuing with attendance.</p><p>Ned reaches over and pats Peter comfortably on the shoulder. Peter keeps his head down for the rest of the class and when the bell rings, he books it to his next class with Ned in tow. He throws himself down into his desk in the next class.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d MJ asks, leaning over to Peter.</p><p>Peter shakes his head, \u201cI thought Flash would just leave me alone once he found out my dad was a superhero, but nooooo. Now everyone is talking about me and I can\u2019t control it and Flash probably told everyone that I\u2019m still using my last name instead of Tony\u2019s and it\u2019s all just a huge mess!\u201d Peter exclaims before laying his head down on his desk.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks,\u201d MJ sympathizes. \u201cBut I promise it\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u2019 Peter moans.</p><p>MJ smirks, \u201cBecause I recorded what you just said and sent it to your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Peter exclaims snapping up. \u201cMJ, please please tell me you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d MJ says, but she\u2019s obviously not. MJ checks her phone as Peter groans, \u201cHe\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter cries as the class fills up. He quickly grabs his phone, tells his teacher that he is going to the bathroom, and nearly sprints out of the classroom. The second the door closes Peter pulls out his phone and calls his dad, he picks up on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cDad, please don\u2019t come to school,\u201d Peter says as he pushes the bathroom door open. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Peter?\u201d Tony asks and in the background, Peter can hear the roar of New York traffic.</p><p>\u201cYes, dad, I promise I\u2019m fine,\u201d Peter says, leaning back against the bathroom wall.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Tony laments.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you even going to do when you get here?\u201d Peter asks, crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cYour mom and I going to talk to your principal about his anti-bullying policy,\u201d Tony says, surprise Peter with his rational course of action.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter says.

As the teacher runs down the list, Peter anxiously awaits hearing his name.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter Parker,&rdquo; the teacher calls.</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Peter says as Flash scoffs.</p><p>&ldquo;Parker?&rdquo; Flash says, &ldquo;His last name is Stark.&rdquo; Flash smirks, &ldquo;Oh, I get it, Stark doesn&rsquo;t want his last name being ruined by an orphan like Penis.&rdquo; Flash taunts. Peter squeezes his hands into fists and stares at the grain of the wood on his desk.</p><p>&ldquo;That is enough, Mr. Thompsen,&rdquo; the teacher says before continuing with attendance.</p><p>Ned reaches over and pats Peter comfortably on the shoulder. Peter keeps his head down for the rest of the class and when the bell rings, he books it to his next class with Ned in tow. He throws himself down into his desk in the next class.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; MJ asks, leaning over to Peter.</p><p>Peter shakes his head, &ldquo;I thought Flash would just leave me alone once he found out my dad was a superhero, but nooooo. Now everyone is talking about me and I can&rsquo;t control it and Flash probably told everyone that I&rsquo;m still using my last name instead of Tony&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s all just a huge mess!&rdquo; Peter exclaims before laying his head down on his desk.</p><p>&ldquo;That sucks,&rdquo; MJ sympathizes. &ldquo;But I promise it&rsquo;s going to be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rsquo; Peter moans.</p><p>MJ smirks, &ldquo;Because I recorded what you just said and sent it to your parents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Peter exclaims snapping up. &ldquo;MJ, please please tell me you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; MJ says, but she&rsquo;s obviously not. MJ checks her phone as Peter groans, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on his way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Peter cries as the class fills up. He quickly grabs his phone, tells his teacher that he is going to the bathroom, and nearly sprints out of the classroom. The second the door closes Peter pulls out his phone and calls his dad, he picks up on the first ring.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, please don&rsquo;t come to school,&rdquo; Peter says as he pushes the bathroom door open. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really, Peter?&rdquo; Tony asks and in the background, Peter can hear the roar of New York traffic.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, dad, I promise I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Peter says, leaning back against the bathroom wall.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; Tony laments.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you even going to do when you get here?&rdquo; Peter asks, crossing his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Your mom and I going to talk to your principal about his anti-bullying policy,&rdquo; Tony says, surprise Peter with his rational course of action.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Peter says. Peter bits his lip and begins to pace the bathroom.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, buddy?&rdquo; Tony asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Peter takes a breath. &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t get what this kid said out of my head?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; Tony says softly, &ldquo;talk to me kid. What did they say?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter takes a shaky breath and presses his shaking hands against his legs, &ldquo;He, um, it was during attendance and he was said, um, something about how I was still using my last name and not yours.&rdquo; Tony is silent for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing that&rsquo;s not all.&rdquo; Tony responds after a few seconds, &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be this upset if that was all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; Peter tugs on the hem of his shirt, &ldquo;he said that the reason I wasn&rsquo;t using your name was because you wouldn&rsquo;t want it to be, um, ruined by me.&rdquo; Peter looks down, tears forming at the edge of his eyelashes.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; Tony says, his voice so soft it&rsquo;s almost a whisper. &ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s wrong right? I love you, kid. More than anything thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter sniffs, &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; Peter wipes his eyes, &ldquo;I need to go back to class. Will I see you when you get here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, kid,&rdquo; Tony says and Peter can hear the smile in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, goodbye, dad,&rdquo; Peter says.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye kid.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shoves his phone into his back pocket. He pinches the bridge of his nose and squeezes his eyes shut.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa, are you okay?&rdquo; A voice says. Peter looks up to see Flash standing in the door of the bathroom.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you care,&rdquo; Peter says as he stands and pushes past Flash and out the door. He walks back to class and sits back down next to MJ.</p><p>While the teacher drones on, MJ slides a note onto Peter&rsquo;s desk.</p><p>Are you okay?</p><p>Peter scribbles a quick response and passes it back.</p><p>I&rsquo;m okay. My parents are still coming.</p><p>MJ signs at his note and passes it back again.</p><p>Then why do you look like you&rsquo;ve been crying?</p><p>Peter sighs and passes it back.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll tell you later.</p><p>MJ nods and turns back to pay attention to the teacher. Peter tries his best to pay attention to the class, but his mind keeps going back to what Flash said and his dad&rsquo;s response.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter Parker to the front office please,&rdquo; a voice on the intercom says, &ldquo;Peter Parker to the office.&rdquo;</p><p>The class falls silent and turns to look at Peter. The teacher sighs and gestures for Peter to leave. Peter quickly stands up and walks out of the classroom. When he arrives at the front office, he is met by the secretary.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Peter,&rdquo; the secretary greets with a smile. &ldquo;You can go into the office, your parents are waiting for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Peter says and as he pushes open the door to the principal&rsquo;s office.</p><p>Tony and Pepper stand when Peter opens the door. Pepper hugs Peter, pressing a quick kiss to the top of his head. Peter hugs his dad and Tony guides Peter to sit in the chair next to him. As there are only two chairs, Tony gives Pepper his and sits on the arm of her chair instead.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, so why don&rsquo;t we begin,&rdquo; Tony says to the principal, who seems quite starstruck.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, yes,&rdquo; the principal pretends to look at a paper on his desk, &ldquo;where would you like to begin.&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper leans forward, &ldquo;Your anti-bullying policy.&rdquo; Pepper&rsquo;s voice is cold, &ldquo;Our son has been bullied at this school for years and you have done nothing. Peter told us he could handle it so we left it at that. Until the bully came into our home and gave Peter a panic attack because he was talking about Peter&rsquo;s family.&rdquo; At that Pepper can see that Peter is getting tense, so she reaches over and takes his hand. &ldquo;Then this morning we got a call from Peter&rsquo;s friend that Peter was being bullied during class about his last name.&rdquo;</p><p>The principal looks scared, as he should, &ldquo;I must confess that I have not heard anything about this, Mrs. Stark.&rdquo; Tony scoffs. Pepper gives him a look and he turns it into a cough. &ldquo;And even if I did there is not much I could do about it.&rdquo; Peter almost feels sorry for the principal, he has been on the receiving end of Pepper&rsquo;s glare.</p><p>&ldquo;Does it not matter to you that our son feels unsafe at your school?&rdquo; Pepper asks, standing up.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course it does, I&rsquo;m just not sure what I can-&rdquo; the principal is cut off by Tony standing up beside his wife.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you need me to spell it out for you?&rdquo; Tony asks. &ldquo;Your policy is not protecting our son and furthermore, he was being bullied while the class was going on and your teachers did nothing. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p><p>The principal gulps, &ldquo;I do. Um, we are having a staff meeting on Wednesday and I can assure you that we will be revisiting our bullying policy.&rdquo; Pepper and Tony sit back down, Tony puts his hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Would either of you like to attend?&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper and Tony exchange a quick glance and Pepper nods, &ldquo;Yes, I will be there.&rdquo; Pepper and Tony stand up and Peter follows, &ldquo;Thank you for agreeing to this meeting, I will be seeing you on Wednesday.&rdquo; Pepper nods and turns around, Tony and Peter are quick to follow her. When the door closes behind them, Pepper tugs Peter into a quick hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Pepper asks her warm hands on either side his face.</p><p>Peter nods, &ldquo;Why does everyone keep asking me that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re worried about you, kid?&rdquo; Tony says. Peter nods and Tony gives him another hug. He turns to Pepper, &ldquo;What do you say we take him out for the rest of the day?&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper sighs, her face softening as she looks at her son and husband, &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; After they sign Peter out, the family piles into Tony&rsquo;s car. Peter sends off a quick text to Ned and MJ and leans against his mom.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, mom,&rdquo; Peter says.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Pepper responds with a smile.</p>",
