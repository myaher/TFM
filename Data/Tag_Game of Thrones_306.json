He was later hanged (supposedly) and buried in an unmarked grave in London.</p>\n<p>As detailed in a newly published book\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<em>The Mythology of the \u2018Princes in the Tower\u2019 </em>by\u00a0Dr John Ashdown-Hill\u00a0\u2013 the latest breakthrough comes in the form of DNA taken from a direct descendant of the maternal grandmother of the two princes, an English opera singer called Elizabeth Roberts.</p>\n<p>The book argues that if the maternal DNA of Roberts matches the skeletons buried at Westminster Abbey, then the likelihood of Richard III being guilty would be considerably higher as it shows that they died near the Tower of London during his reign. If it doesn\u2019t match Roberts, then all the more likely that the boys did not die during Richard III\u2019s lifetime near the Tower.</p>\n<p>However, here\u2019s the bad news: Westminster Abbey is reluctant to agree to any testing of the two skeletons in the urn. Modern tests of the bodies at the Abbey are practically always turned down. </p>\n<p>So, while it is not quite \u201ccase closed\u201d just yet, this vital link of Roberts\u2019 DNA could still get Richard III off the hook\u00a0\u2013 or perhaps condemn him to his villainous reputation.</p>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/dna-could-finally-solve-a-murder-mystery-of-the-english-monarchy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/dna-could-finally-solve-a-murder-mystery-of-the-english-monarchy/</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.viraltvnews.com/game_of_thrones/dna-could-finally-solve-a-murder-mystery-of-the-english-monarchy/\">DNA Could Finally Solve A Murder Mystery Of The English Monarchy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.viraltvnews.com\">Viral TV News</a>.</p>\n<br/><br/>\nfrom WordPress <a href=\"http://www.viraltvnews.com/game_of_thrones/dna-could-finally-solve-a-murder-mystery-of-the-english-monarchy/\">http://www.viraltvnews.com/game_of_thrones/dna-could-finally-solve-a-murder-mystery-of-the-english-monarchy/</a>",
