        "answer": "<p>Under the cut, a Obi-Wan x Mace story. This one is teen rated, no porn for once ^^</p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>Obi-Wan was in Anchoread when it happened. He had come\nto buy some medicines for his eopie, which was waiting for a little eopie that\nhe hoped one day give to Luke. After his purchases, he had decided to offer\nhimself one ale, just one, in a cantina. He didn\u2019t dare keep alcohol in his\nlittle home, he was too aware of the risks of a PTSD veteran with too much\nguilt, no support of friends and family, and too much time on his hands against\nthe possibilities of sweet oblivion.</p><p>So, here he was, nursing that one dark ale and\nlistening to the noises of the cantina around him. The band was on pause and\ncheating some idiots on cards. The barman was trying to convince an old drunk\nto go home to his children\u2026 </p><p>And in a corner, a holopost was transmitting the\nEmpire official channel, where they were displaying a row of Wookies, arranged\nin a row and awaiting executions, as an official was belching a speech about\nthe glorious times to come, now that the Wookie\u2019s illegal rebellion was down.\nHis heart in his throat, Obi-Wan abandoned his ale and stood up to go home. He\ndidn\u2019t need to see this, to add images to his guilt about the rest of the\ngalaxy. </p><p>He almost missed the tell-tale hiss of the lightsaber\nand turned just in time to see on the screen a silhouette, dressed like a\nspacer like any other, but with a mask, jumping on the rescue, melting the\nwookies chains and sending blasters shoots back to the trooper with a\nlightsaber. The mask was probably for the software of facial recognition the\nEmpire was installing more and more everywhere they could, because the purple\nlightsaber was a banner, a cry of rally, which everybody with half a brain cell\nwould recognize. </p><p>Obi-Wan sat down heavily again. </p><p>They were not alone. Yoda and he were not alone. </p><p>Mace Windu was alive and quite busy making a nuisance\nof himself to the Empire. The image was cut down as a technician smarter than\nthe other probably realized letting all the Empire see a supposed dead Jedi\nrescue rebels would be damageable for the moral, or more importantly for his\nhealth. Obi-Wan didn\u2019t need to see the rest to know how it would turn. Sunk\ninto Vapaad, Mace was unstoppable, only treachery could touch him when he\nopened himself to his anger and channelled it into righteousness.</p><p>Obi-Wan exited the cantina quickly and let the desert\nswallowed him. He went straight to the Lars\u2019 homestead, when Owen wasn\u2019t\nparticularly happy to see him, but let him enter when he saw how pale and\nalmost trembling the Jedi was. Obi-Wan told them everything. </p><p>\u201cYou need to go,\u201d the farmer said, surprising the\nJedi. He would have thought Beru would be the one to understand first. </p><p>\u201cFamily is important,\u201d Owen added, \u201cFor some months,\nBeru\u2019s brothers have wanted to visit us to meet Luke and I always found some\npretext, because I find them unbearable. But I will invite them now. Luke will\nbe under the watch of more adults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember his true parentage must\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen, I know. I\u2019m pretty sure a six months old will\nmanage to survive with only a half-dozen caretakers for the length of your\ntravel. Even here. Moisture farmers have raised children for centuries.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s how Obi-Wan left Tatooine, guilt and hope\nraging in his heart despite meditation, and attacked the problem of finding\nMace Windu, a wanted man who had succeed in escaping the Empire\u2019s clutches for\nsix months, despite being probably one of the higher target in Sidious\u2019s book. The\nguilt followed him all the way. </p><p>Guilt because he had left Luke without Jedi\nprotection. </p><p>Guilt because he felt like he had deserted his post. </p><p>Guilt because there was something he hadn\u2019t said to\nOwen and Beru. Mace wasn\u2019t only a surviving Jedi, an ally and a friend. </p><p>Mace was the man of early mornings when they took the\ntime of breakfast together and the first kisses tasted of tea. </p><p>Mace was the man of late nights, when they tumbled to\nbed exhausted by their work, with the only strength to throw away their boots\nand belts, but it was still fine, because the other was there. </p><p>Mace was the man of shared lunches, each on his\ndatapad because there was so much work, but their knees touching under the\ntable and comfort blooming from that small intimacy. </p><p>Mace was the man who had convinced him he was worthy\nof love and filled an empty place in his heart he hadn\u2019t even realized existed.</p><p>Mace was the man who had been his friend first, his\nsupport in difficult times, his sparring partner in late nights of insomnia,\nhis confident, and his lover too. </p><p>Mace. </p><p>Mace was alive. </p><p>Obi-Wan didn\u2019t know what they would do if he found\nhim. <i>When </i>he found him. Would they go\nback to Tatooine? In that case, what of the people Mace could still help in the\ngalaxy? Would they stay together, trying to save all those they could, until\nthe day they would be just a tad too slow and blaster fire would take them? </p><p>Those questions were for later, Obi-Wan tried so hard\nto stay in the moment, in his search. </p><p>He needed three months only, and a little help from\nQueen Organa, to succeed where the newly founded Inquisitors were failing. He\nknew his lover like even Yoda didn\u2019t, understood the way his mind worked, the\nsame way Mace understood him. In a mangrove in an unnamed moon of the Outer Rim,\nObi-Wan started running as fast as he could on the spongy soil with a cry of\njoy and thrown himself in the arms of Mace, who didn\u2019t even seemed surprised\nand closed them around him, taking his lips in the same movement. </p><p>There were so many questions to resolve in the future,\nso many that they would start to buzz quickly in their minds, but for now, they\nleft them blissfully alone, just the two of them, the stumbling to Mace\u2019s\nhidden place, a small cottage, the noises of Obi-Wan when he discovered the two\nprosthesis hands of his lover, memories of Darth Vader\u2019s choices, the kisses he\nput on them, the hundred words of comfort and love. </p><p>There were so many questions but for now, the other\nwas the only answer they needed. </p>",

                "content": "<p>Under the cut, a Obi-Wan x Mace story. This one is teen rated, no porn for once ^^</p><p><br /></p><p>Obi-Wan was in Anchoread when it happened. He had come\nto buy some medicines for his eopie, which was waiting for a little eopie that\nhe hoped one day give to Luke. After his purchases, he had decided to offer\nhimself one ale, just one, in a cantina. He didn&rsquo;t dare keep alcohol in his\nlittle home, he was too aware of the risks of a PTSD veteran with too much\nguilt, no support of friends and family, and too much time on his hands against\nthe possibilities of sweet oblivion.</p><p>So, here he was, nursing that one dark ale and\nlistening to the noises of the cantina around him. The band was on pause and\ncheating some idiots on cards. The barman was trying to convince an old drunk\nto go home to his children&hellip; </p><p>And in a corner, a holopost was transmitting the\nEmpire official channel, where they were displaying a row of Wookies, arranged\nin a row and awaiting executions, as an official was belching a speech about\nthe glorious times to come, now that the Wookie&rsquo;s illegal rebellion was down.\nHis heart in his throat, Obi-Wan abandoned his ale and stood up to go home. He\ndidn&rsquo;t need to see this, to add images to his guilt about the rest of the\ngalaxy. </p><p>He almost missed the tell-tale hiss of the lightsaber\nand turned just in time to see on the screen a silhouette, dressed like a\nspacer like any other, but with a mask, jumping on the rescue, melting the\nwookies chains and sending blasters shoots back to the trooper with a\nlightsaber. The mask was probably for the software of facial recognition the\nEmpire was installing more and more everywhere they could, because the purple\nlightsaber was a banner, a cry of rally, which everybody with half a brain cell\nwould recognize. </p><p>Obi-Wan sat down heavily again. </p><p>They were not alone. Yoda and he were not alone. </p><p>Mace Windu was alive and quite busy making a nuisance\nof himself to the Empire. The image was cut down as a technician smarter than\nthe other probably realized letting all the Empire see a supposed dead Jedi\nrescue rebels would be damageable for the moral, or more importantly for his\nhealth. Obi-Wan didn&rsquo;t need to see the rest to know how it would turn. Sunk\ninto Vapaad, Mace was unstoppable, only treachery could touch him when he\nopened himself to his anger and channelled it into righteousness.</p><p>Obi-Wan exited the cantina quickly and let the desert\nswallowed him. He went straight to the Lars&rsquo; homestead, when Owen wasn&rsquo;t\nparticularly happy to see him, but let him enter when he saw how pale and\nalmost trembling the Jedi was. Obi-Wan told them everything. </p><p>&ldquo;You need to go,&rdquo; the farmer said, surprising the\nJedi. He would have thought Beru would be the one to understand first. </p><p>&ldquo;Family is important,&rdquo; Owen added, &ldquo;For some months,\nBeru&rsquo;s brothers have wanted to visit us to meet Luke and I always found some\npretext, because I find them unbearable.
