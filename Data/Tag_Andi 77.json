        "body": "<h1>Why you should write better women in your gay romance fic</h1><p><i>Let me preface this by saying I\u2019m a man, and I apologize for what I\u2019m sure will be the myriad mistakes I make in this piece</i></p><p>A long time ago I read a theory that proposed an interesting reason behind an interesting phenomenon. Why is it that young straight girls get so passionate about non-canon gay (for the purpose of this post, I am using gay to solely refer to gay males) pairings in fandoms? The theory had three parts:</p><ol><li>The male characters in these stories were often very fully written, with opinions, unique traits, and passion driving their actions, friendships and relationships</li><li>The female characters in these pieces of media were often flat, with significantly less detail and uniqueness put into their characters, and were often nothing more than a goal for the male characters to achieve</li><li>So, when looking for a relationship that had chemistry, satisfying conflict, passion\u2014some real meat on its bones\u2014these fans didnt land on the straight relationships, which often felt inevitable and maybe dull. They landed on the relationship between two male characters and used the passion, depth, and conflict found therein to also extrapolate attraction.</li></ol><p>Now, I don\u2019t know if that theory holds any water\u2014one day I\u2019d like to compare the frequency of non-canon gay fics in a fandom that has few strong female characters with one that is well known for its strong women (ATLA, maybe?)\u2014but I always found it interesting. And it made me pay more attention to the presence of well written, well created female characters in the media I consumed.</p><p>But more importantly, it made me pay more attention to the female characters in the media I <i>created</i>. Though, full honesty, I know I\u2019ve failed to accomplish my goal plenty of times. As someone who mostly writes gay romantic fics, I know full well how easy it is to just&hellip; ignore female characters.</p><p>Most often this isn\u2019t malicious. It\u2019s because 1) the protagonist of a gay story is inevitably male, and 2) the next most important character of this romance\u2014the love interest\u2014is also inevitably male, so 3) right off the bat your female characters are consigned to third place or lower. But thats just the obvious set of causes. Here\u2019s some other, less obvious but more troubling ways I see women get the short shriff in gay stories:</p><ul><li>They fall into the f*ghag/gay best friend trope, and exist only to have that relationship</li><li>They\u2019re ignored because the author wants to prove that a gay character isn\u2019t restricted to female friends</li><li>Their only role is to be the girlfriend/ex who gets in the way of the OTP gay romance (see: the icky tendency to force homophobic traits on female characters so they can be the villain of the love story)</li><li>They harbor a tragic, unreqitable love for the main gay character</li><li>They\u2019re just generally unimportant to the story</li></ul><p>Now, none of these character roles are necessarily horrible in their own own right\u2014except for the third one, seriously, stop turning canon female love interests into homophobic villains just so you can have your dramatic gay story. But, in the aggregate of the way we write fiction, and especially fan fiction, it does a great disservice to representation of female characters. And I say \u2018especially in fan fiction\u2019 because nowadays we have a significantly richer selection of well rounded female characters that are too often flattened out, denied agency and their own goals, so that they can be nothing more than a stepping stone/support system for our gay main character. And it needs to stop.</p><p>Why is it that out of almost 1500 Andi Mack fics on AO3\u2014most of which are Tyrus and Jyrus\u2014probably less than 300 give Andi or Buffy any real importance as characters? They\u2019re two beautifully created characters with traits, flaws, passion and quirks who all too often could be replaced with any generic human without really changing anything in the fraction of stories they do show up in. That\u2019s just a waste.</p><p>Why does it matter? Well it should go without saying that representation is important, especially in a forum like fan-works which are generally aimed at younger, more passionate, more impressionable fans. Those interested in gay stories should be able to see good femal representation too. Also, too often gay men use the abuse and persecution they face as justification to turn around and spew invective at women and minorities, and we need to stop letting that invade and be supported by our writing. </p><p>Outside of the social reasons, incorporating well-rounded women with flaws, goals, and personalities into your stories will simply make those stories better. It will add to realism, it will widen your appeal, and it will improve your writing abilities. Learning to write through the voices and experiences of others will not only improve your storytelling, it will help you learn to become a better person. You might even gain empathy into the experiences of others.</p><p>Now does this mean that you need to rewrite that single-scene oneshot to force in a female character? No. Thats stupid. But for grander stories, with more characters and more scenes, question yourself when you\u2019re not including women. Question yourself if the women you include aren\u2019t as important to the story as the men.

And it made me pay more attention to the presence of well written, well created female characters in the media I consumed.</p><p>But more importantly, it made me pay more attention to the female characters in the media I <i>created</i>. Though, full honesty, I know I\u2019ve failed to accomplish my goal plenty of times. As someone who mostly writes gay romantic fics, I know full well how easy it is to just\u2026 ignore female characters.</p><p>Most often this isn\u2019t malicious. It\u2019s because 1) the protagonist of a gay story is inevitably male, and 2) the next most important character of this romance\u2014the love interest\u2014is also inevitably male, so 3) right off the bat your female characters are consigned to third place or lower. But thats just the obvious set of causes. Here\u2019s some other, less obvious but more troubling ways I see women get the short shriff in gay stories:</p><ul><li>They fall into the f*ghag/gay best friend trope, and exist only to have that relationship</li><li>They\u2019re ignored because the author wants to prove that a gay character isn\u2019t restricted to female friends</li><li>Their only role is to be the girlfriend/ex who gets in the way of the OTP gay romance (see: the icky tendency to force homophobic traits on female characters so they can be the villain of the love story)</li><li>They harbor a tragic, unreqitable love for the main gay character</li><li>They\u2019re just generally unimportant to the story</li></ul><p>Now, none of these character roles are necessarily horrible in their own own right\u2014except for the third one, seriously, stop turning canon female love interests into homophobic villains just so you can have your dramatic gay story. But, in the aggregate of the way we write fiction, and especially fan fiction, it does a great disservice to representation of female characters. And I say \u2018especially in fan fiction\u2019 because nowadays we have a significantly richer selection of well rounded female characters that are too often flattened out, denied agency and their own goals, so that they can be nothing more than a stepping stone/support system for our gay main character. And it needs to stop.</p><p>Why is it that out of almost 1500 Andi Mack fics on AO3\u2014most of which are Tyrus and Jyrus\u2014probably less than 300 give Andi or Buffy any real importance as characters? They\u2019re two beautifully created characters with traits, flaws, passion and quirks who all too often could be replaced with any generic human without really changing anything in the fraction of stories they do show up in. That\u2019s just a waste.</p><p>Why does it matter? Well it should go without saying that representation is important, especially in a forum like fan-works which are generally aimed at younger, more passionate, more impressionable fans. Those interested in gay stories should be able to see good femal representation too. Also, too often gay men use the abuse and persecution they face as justification to turn around and spew invective at women and minorities, and we need to stop letting that invade and be supported by our writing. </p><p>Outside of the social reasons, incorporating well-rounded women with flaws, goals, and personalities into your stories will simply make those stories better. It will add to realism, it will widen your appeal, and it will improve your writing abilities. Learning to write through the voices and experiences of others will not only improve your storytelling, it will help you learn to become a better person. You might even gain empathy into the experiences of others.</p><p>Now does this mean that you need to rewrite that single-scene oneshot to force in a female character? No. Thats stupid. But for grander stories, with more characters and more scenes, question yourself when you\u2019re not including women. Question yourself if the women you include aren\u2019t as important to the story as the men. Correct yourself if you\u2019re treating an entire gender as less important\u2014or worse, villainous\u2014just so you can have your men loving men.</p><p>And for the love of everything, stop leaving 50% of the global population out of your plot.</p></p>",

His voices raises over the sound of the rain that tries to drown out both of their speech. </p><p>\u201cAh, see?! You\u2019re not even <i>over</i> Libby so <i>that\u2019s</i> why you\u2019re jumping back into things with Amber!\u201d Cyrus thinks he\u2019s figured it out. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep running, Jonah, not this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>She\u2019s</i> not the one I\u2019m not over&hellip;\u201d Jonah cries aggravated tears, it being the only warmth he can feel at the moment. </p><p>\u201cAndi?\u201d Cyrus assumes. \u201c\u2018Cause I hate to break it to you, but you guys were never meant to be.\u201d Cyrus\u2019 pettiness comes to show.</p><p>\u201cBut you and I were.\u201d Jonah carefully says the words.</p><p>\u201c<i>Excuse</i> me?\u201d Cyrus doesn\u2019t want to believe that he heard him correctly.</p><p>\u201c<i>We</i>. Were. But I guess not anymore, huh? Guess it\u2019s \u2018cause I\u2019ll never have my chance at a \u2018real\u2019 relationship.\u201d Jonah forces himself to snap, eyes widening when seeing that he\u2019s not the only one crying. </p><p>\u201cJonah what are you saying&hellip;\u201d Cyrus wipes his tears.</p><p>\u201cThat maybe we had a chance, okay?! But it\u2019s not worth it anymore. Come on. Look at me.\u201d Jonah cries. </p><p>\u201cJumping from girl to girl. Clearly I don\u2019t know how to handle myself. Let alone anyone else. And for a second there, I thought you liked me. All those months ago. Maybe you did but you <i>stopped</i>, not that I blame you \u2018cause why <i>bother</i> keeping up. It\u2019s why Andi ended things, and Libby. Soon enough Amber\u2019s going to realize too. I\u2019m a <i>mess</i>, Cyrus-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI never <i>stopped</i>!\u201d Cyrus can\u2019t take hearing him talk like that anymore. \u201cJonah I can <i>promise</i> you I never, stopped.\u201d </p><p>In this moment Cyrus comes face to face with his prior denial. </p><p>\u201c<i>Ever</i>. I was lying to myself when I thought I did. I was scared of losing you, and I did <i>not</i> want to lose you.\u201d Cyrus\u2019 voice trembles. \u201cI would\u2019ve rather lost myself. So that\u2019s what I did, okay? It\u2019s exactly what I did. But with you&hellip;I\u2019m present! <i>No</i> one else has never made me feel so valued, or mattered, and&hellip;!\u201d Several raindrops have poured down and joined the tears on his face. </p><p>Jonah could easily settle things right now. Not just settle, but officiate. Except there\u2019s one thing that he needs to make happen, before he can do that.</p><p>\u201cJonah?! Jonah!\u201d Cyrus yells after him once he sees him resume to walk away, this time making it front of the building, and right inside where he needs to be.</p><p>This is the first and last time he\u2019ll leave Cyrus feeling alone.</p><p><br/></p><p>He was hoping maybe Cyrus would\u2019ve waited. Maybe even come in due to all the rain, and see things for himself. But, things took longer than expected, and when Jonah went back out to check, he was gone, which a part of him deeply understood, and not just because of the weather.</p><p>Not only does he find Cyrus, but Cyrus finds him. Standing on the back porch step of his home, outside in the continuously pouring rain. Rubbing at his tearful eyes, he unlocks and opens the door, moving away so Jonah can step inside, staring him down as he wipes the tears from his face. </p><p>His dire expression demands that he explains himself as to how, and most importantly why.</p><p>\u201cI broke up with Amber&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Chest just about closing in around his heart, Cyrus gasps out a breath, his eyes widening and watching as Jonah steps over directly across from him. </p><p>\u201cYou were right, Cyrus.\u201d He states. \u201cWith Andi, Amber, even Libby&hellip;Nothing felt real. But with you, everything <i>is</i>. Realer than anything I could ever imagine.\u201d </p><p>This is enough to get Cyrus to kiss him, which doesn\u2019t take long to turn either of them sensually energetic, the two moving onto the couch and enjoying not only themselves but one another, as Jonah stays stuck on top of him while returning his kisses repeatedly, the both of them trying to keep it steady and evenly paced, feeling as if maybe they\u2019ve manipulated the concept of time. </p><p>If there\u2019s any moment to be stuck in, they\u2019d surely wouldn\u2019t mind if it were this one. </p><p>Eventually growing worn out, they come to a stop, Cyrus placing his head on top of Jonah\u2019s chest and enjoying with him both the sound of the calming rain outside, and the view of the ceiling above. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking.\u201d Cyrus softly asks to Jonah.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d Jonah looks down into his eyes and smirks. \u201cMm.\u201d He squeezes onto his hand, momentarily glancing at the sight before looking back to him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014things between us probably should\u2019ve happened a lot sooner.\u201d He giggles. </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Chuckling, Cyrus agrees. \u201cI\u2019m just glad it did&hellip;\u201d He grins and climbs directly above him, having Jonah return his smile.</p><p>\u201cCan I be honest with you&hellip;\u201d Jonah whispers, lightly caressing his face and running his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI encourage it.\u201d Cyrus answers, heart growing heavy at the intense look Jonah sends deep into his eyes, and at the long pause that unexpectedly lasts between them.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughs with relief, heart now hammering out of excitement and staying put in his chest.</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Y\u2019know&hellip;If I\u2019m being honest.\u201d He smirks.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Jonah jokes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man of my word.\u201d Cyrus promises, sitting them up across from each other and lightly touching the center of his nose.</p><p>\u201cOne of the many reasons why I love you so much.\u201d Jonah states, making them both giggle and move in towards each other even closer. \u201cYeah?\u201d Their knees now connecting, Cyrus pushes Jonah\u2019s hair back and lightly ruffles it around. </p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Jonah shuts his eyes and goes in for a kiss that Cyrus instantaneously accepts. </p><p>If they <i>were</i> to accumulate the manipulation of time, they wouldn\u2019t dare mess with it, since they know that the best thing they can do at this point, is go seamlessly forward. </p><p>Which, after all, is their best, and only choice.  </p>",

Realer than anything I could ever imagine.&rdquo; </p><p>This is enough to get Cyrus to kiss him, which doesn&rsquo;t take long to turn either of them sensually energetic, the two moving onto the couch and enjoying not only themselves but one another, as Jonah stays stuck on top of him while returning his kisses repeatedly, the both of them trying to keep it steady and evenly paced, feeling as if maybe they&rsquo;ve manipulated the concept of time. </p><p>If there&rsquo;s any moment to be stuck in, they&rsquo;d surely wouldn&rsquo;t mind if it were this one. </p><p>Eventually growing worn out, they come to a stop, Cyrus placing his head on top of Jonah&rsquo;s chest and enjoying with him both the sound of the calming rain outside, and the view of the ceiling above. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you thinking.&rdquo; Cyrus softly asks to Jonah.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; Jonah looks down into his eyes and smirks. &ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; He squeezes onto his hand, momentarily glancing at the sight before looking back to him.</p><p>&ldquo;That&mdash;things between us probably should&rsquo;ve happened a lot sooner.&rdquo; He giggles. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Chuckling, Cyrus agrees. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad it did&hellip;&rdquo; He grins and climbs directly above him, having Jonah return his smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I be honest with you&hellip;&rdquo; Jonah whispers, lightly caressing his face and running his fingers through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I encourage it.&rdquo; Cyrus answers, heart growing heavy at the intense look Jonah sends deep into his eyes, and at the long pause that unexpectedly lasts between them.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus laughs with relief, heart now hammering out of excitement and staying put in his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too. Y&rsquo;know&hellip;If I&rsquo;m being honest.&rdquo; He smirks.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; Jonah jokes.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man of my word.&rdquo; Cyrus promises, sitting them up across from each other and lightly touching the center of his nose.</p><p>&ldquo;One of the many reasons why I love you so much.&rdquo; Jonah states, making them both giggle and move in towards each other even closer. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Their knees now connecting, Cyrus pushes Jonah&rsquo;s hair back and lightly ruffles it around. </p><p>&ldquo;Mm-hm.&rdquo; Jonah shuts his eyes and goes in for a kiss that Cyrus instantaneously accepts. </p><p>If they <i>were</i> to accumulate the manipulation of time, they wouldn&rsquo;t dare mess with it, since they know that the best thing they can do at this point, is go seamlessly forward. </p><p>Which, after all, is their best, and only choice.  </p>",
