Ned Stark wasn\u2019t so noble. Yes, he was friends with king Robert but not with Lannisters and children of king, specially Joffrey, who was under Lannisters influence. Sudden king\u2019s death has bad impact on Stark\u2019s house so Ned claimed Robert\u2019s children bastards and allianced with Robert\u2019s brother - Stannis. He made an act of treason so they cut his head - that is accurate penalty for that kind of crime.<br/></p><p>2. Sansa was as manipulative as Margaery (in the show). She was Joffrey\u2019s fiancee and traitors daughter and there was no evidence that Joffrey was bastard. So what? Made him a monster. Even if no one belives he\u2019s bastard, others will feel sorry for a poor girl. Joffrey cannot marry Sansa, specially when her brother was fighting against him in the same time so Sansa pick another one - Tyrion. Yes, he was an imp but also rich noble with great inheritance and king\u2019s uncle. Not bad for daughter of traitor. <br/></p><p>3. Robb was an idiot. He didn\u2019t win any battle, his commanders did. Only thing he should do is marry a right girl and he failed even on that. Yeah, they sing about great love but this was a move which pissed a lot of people. Like Tywin said why is better to kill ten people at the dinner than thousand on the batterfield.</p><p>4. Tywin was genius. And everybody hates him because of that. Tyrion was jealous because he wasn\u2019t smart like him (and btw he and Sansa actually poisoned Joffrey together) so frustrated Tyrion killed his father. We think because Tywin mistreated him but it doesn\u2019t make sense. If Tywin was ashamed that Tyrion was imp, he could easily killed him many years before. But the first - Tywin was an enemy of Starks.</p><p>5. Poor Margaery - girl with golden heart, who was thinking about common folks (in contrary of Sansa) was viwed as manipulative and \n<a href=\"https://pl.bab.la/slownik/angielski-polski/promiscuous\" title='\"promiscuous\" po polsku'>promiscuous</a>. Well, in this story could be only one innocent virgin and it must be Sansa.</p><p>6. Arya never went to Bravos and was trained as assasin. She spend her years in Castle Black with her half brother (real half brother, all this Aegon nonsence was created later, for various reasons) and this whole thing was just an imagination of tomboy girl who stuck with all this men for years.</p><p>7. Yeah, there were really bad years for Sansa later when nothing went right. The poisoning job didn\u2019t end up like she was planning, when they pick Margaery instead of her for the second time, her aunt died, her mother\u2019s family wasn\u2019t interested in war against Lannisters, her brothers were killed (for real) and her next husband was to busy defending the North from Iron Islanders to pick her cause. What is even more bad, when she supported Stannis hoping that at least him would fight against Lannisters, Ramsey defeated him too. So she run away for her last hope - her half brother Jon.</p><p>8. Jon was her father\u2019s favourite bastard. They shared the same level of intelligence with Robb. But he was loyal and Sansa promised him that he could left the Night Watch (never a fan, he was sent there by Catelyn who was scared that Ned loved him even more than his legitimate children). So Jon went through the wall, came back with Freefolks army, killed the Watchers who disagreed with him (they never killed him - it\u2019s just a myth) and stand against Ramsey. And he almost LOST when finally someting good happened to Sansa - her uncle Littlefinger came with another army and they defeated Ramsey so she can be a widow.</p><p>9. Well, this time Sansa was smarter - she killed her future husband before she married him. Well, Littlefinger was hoping for lucrative marriage with beautiful, young girl but he really underestimated Sansa.</p><p>10. Sansa sent Jon to Daenerys. He\u2019s handsome womanizer so lonely Targaryen easily felt into the trap. Because the North have bigger problem - after all these years of wars people were starving and started rebellion. There is no Night King or zombie army - just a lot of desperate people who attacks castles and nobles. She needs help with that so Dany\u2019s hiring army was ideal solution.So Jon\u00a0 convince Daenerys it would be better to attack from north (specially after losing Highgarden) and before that suppress the common folks rebellion so Targaryen girl in love agreed for that. <br/></p><p>11.

So Jon went through the wall, came back with Freefolks army, killed the Watchers who disagreed with him (they never killed him - it\u2019s just a myth) and stand against Ramsey.

She needs help with that so Dany\u2019s hiring army was ideal solution.So Jon\u00a0 convince Daenerys it would be better to attack from north (specially after losing Highgarden) and before that suppress the common folks rebellion so Targaryen girl in love agreed for that. <br></p><p>11.

                "content": "<p>I&rsquo;ve just read a book about Richard the Third and apparently he wasn&rsquo;t so bad like \nShakespeare wrote so assumed that Game of thrones is written by victorious Starks and play a game ;)</p><p>1. Ned Stark wasn&rsquo;t so noble. Yes, he was friends with king Robert but not with Lannisters and children of king, specially Joffrey, who was under Lannisters influence. Sudden king&rsquo;s death has bad impact on Stark&rsquo;s house so Ned claimed Robert&rsquo;s children bastards and allianced with Robert&rsquo;s brother - Stannis. He made an act of treason so they cut his head - that is accurate penalty for that kind of crime.<br /></p><p>2. Sansa was as manipulative as Margaery (in the show). She was Joffrey&rsquo;s fiancee and traitors daughter and there was no evidence that Joffrey was bastard. So what? Made him a monster. Even if no one belives he&rsquo;s bastard, others will feel sorry for a poor girl. Joffrey cannot marry Sansa, specially when her brother was fighting against him in the same time so Sansa pick another one - Tyrion. Yes, he was an imp but also rich noble with great inheritance and king&rsquo;s uncle. Not bad for daughter of traitor. <br /></p><p>3. Robb was an idiot.

        "body": "<p>It\u2019s hard to talk about Sansa\u2019s narrative and NOT talk about fairy tales, since they are referenced so often and so closely entwined with her story.</p><p>I\u2019ve<a href=\"https://secretlyatargaryen.tumblr.com/post/139264066522/sansa-x-tyrion-as-beauty-and-the-beast\"> talked before</a> about how there are obvious references to the Beauty and the Beast tale in Sansa\u2019s marriage to Tyrion. I\u2019m also quite fond of <a href=\"https://secretlyatargaryen.tumblr.com/post/53290265120/onlyalittlelion-okay-no-but-srsly-tho-venuss\">this interpretation of Sansa and Tyrion as Cupid and Psyche</a>, and that myth has long been considered the prototype of all Beauty and the Beast stories. It also belongs to a class of tale known as\u00a0\u201cthe search for the lost husband,\u201d of which one of the most well known stories is the Norwegian answer to Beauty and the Beast, titled East of the Sun and West of the Moon.</p><p>In the latter story, a young woman is taken by a great white bear to live in his castle, and given all the things she could need in the world. At night, she is visited by a mysterious man whose face she cannot see, and who is always gone by morning. The beats here are much the same as the Cupid and Psyche story. Psyche cannot see her lover\u2019s face but comes to know him as very dear to her, despite being originally told that she would be wed to a monster.</p><p>Does this sound familiar?</p><blockquote><p>\n\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie, Sansa. I am malformed, scarred, and small, but &hellip;&rdquo; she could see him groping &ldquo;&hellip; abed, when the candles are blown out, I am made no worse than other men.
