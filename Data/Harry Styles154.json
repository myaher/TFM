These days, he\nrarely went out to clubs. He spent his free time at home, or with\nfamily. Today, however, he wanted to get the beautiful y/n out of his\nmind. \n</p><p>The\nwhole gang was in attendance. It was Harry&rsquo;s, unofficial, celebration\nof his debut album. The album had been widely popular and extremely\nsuccessful. Harry had been over the moon. Part of him worried that\npeople wouldn&rsquo;t like his new sound, and another part of him felt like\nhis fans wouldn&rsquo;t accept him without the other boys.</p><p>He\nhad struggled with mixed emotions ever since the band had went their\nseparate ways. He missed his mates dearly and wished things could\nhave turned out differently. However, he wished them all nothing but\nthe best! He would always be one of their biggest fans, cheering them\non from the sidelines.</p><p>Harry\nsipped on his whiskey, as he watched his friends chatting. There were\nnothing but laughs between the lot of them. He enjoyed moments like\nthis and wished he could have them more often. He knew he needed to\ntake some more time for himself.</p><p>He\nwas lost in deep thought, when Mitch nudged him. \u201cHey Harry. Isn&rsquo;t\nthat your girlfriend?\u201d He teased.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s\nhead shot up and turned in the direction he was pointing. Sure\nenough, the stunning y/n stood in the corner with a group of her\nfriends. She was wearing a tight black dress and had her hair down up\nin a bun.</p><p>To\nMitch&rsquo;s great pleasure, Harry blushed ever so slightly.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d\nSarah chimed in. \u201cWhat did I miss?? What is this about a\ngirlfriend, Harry??\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s\nnothing!\u201d Harry groaned shooting Mitch a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cOur\nyoung heart throb here is in loveee.\u201d Mitch chuckled.</p><p>\u201cIn\nlove??\u201d Sarah asked wide eyed \u201cSounds serious. Well go on with\nit, tell us about her.\u201d</p><p>Downing\nthe rest of his drink, Harry smirked. \u201cYou know I would, but I need\na refill.\u201d</p><p>He\nstood up and headed to the bar. He smiled when he heard his friends\nprotests from behind him. He was certain that Mitch would fill them\nall in, while he was gone.</p><p>Harry\nordered his drink, and waited at the bar. Out of the corner of his\neye, he noticed the girl approach. She stood in front of the bar,\njust to the left of Harry. He watched her give her order the\nbartender. She was getting drinks for the entire group. She looked\nslightly flushed from the alcohol, and it made her all the more\nalluring.</p><p>When\nhis drink was made, Harry made a decision. Discreetly he asked the\nman behind the counter to pay for both his and her drinks for the\nnight. Giving him a smile, he took the card willingly.</p><p>The\ngirl was beyond surprised, when her drinks were ready. She reached in\nher pocket, but was stopped and told what had happened. Although the\nbartender didn&rsquo;t mention a name, she turned her head to both sides\nand then spotted Harry.</p><p>It\nwouldn&rsquo;t have been obvious that it was him, if not for him staring.\nEmbarrassed, he gave her a shake of his head and turned back to the\nfront.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndidn&rsquo;t have to do that, you know.\u201d She spoke softly from beside\nhim.</p><p>Shocked he turned her way. \u201cWas it that obvious?\u201d He said coolly.</p><p>Laughing\nslightly, she shook her head. Her eyes were dancing with excitement,\nas Harry watched on. \u201cWell, although highly unnecessary, thank you\nfor the kind gesture.\u201d She told him sincerely.</p><p>\u201cThe\npleasure is all mine, love.\u201d He told her honestly.</p><p>Hearing\nher friends calling her name, she briefly turned away. \u201cWell I\nguess I should be getting back to my friends,\u201d she told him. He\nwasn&rsquo;t sure, but he thought he saw sadness in her eyes. She gave him\na warm smile. \u201cThanks again for the drinks. I hope you have a\ngoodnight Harry.\u201d</p><p>Hearing\nhis name roll of her tongue so smoothly, made his heart skip a beat.\nHe watched her walk back to her group, longingly.</p><p>She\nconfounded him. She conformed that she had known his identity, yet\nshe still treated him like any other person. He found it to be quite\nrefreshing, a nice and welcomed change.</p><p>He\nwatched her for a moment longer. Noticing her talking to Eric, he\nstarted to get panicky. He had known that Eric would tell her of\ntheir encounter, and he had hoped that she wouldn&rsquo;t find him strange.\nWhen Eric pointed in Harry&rsquo;s direction, his face grew red.</p><p>He\ndecided to return to his friends. He wanted to disappear into the\ncrowd, or rather have a hole open in the floor and swallow him whole.</p><p>His\nfriends were still laughing and caring on at his expense. They,\nwithout a doubt, had seen what had gone on at the bar. Before long,\nhe had become restless. He decided that it was time to call it a\nnight. He wanted to get out of there before y/n decided to confront\nhim.</p><p>Telling\nhis friends goodbye, he quickly made his way to the exit. Without a\nbackward glance, he left the club.</p><p><br/></p><p>*********************************************</p><h2>YOUR\nPOINT OF VIEW</h2><p><br/></p><p>Against\nyour better judgment, you decided to join Eric at the club. He had\nbegged and pleaded with you for the better part of the day. You were\nbeyond exhausted from the extra hours you had been putting in at\nwork, but he wasn&rsquo;t taking no for an answer.</p><p>You\ndecided to take pity on him and agreed to have one drink with him.\nYou got dressed up, deciding to spend extra care on your appearance.\nNormally, you didn&rsquo;t care how you looked. However, you had a feeling\nsomething might happen tonight.</p><p>It\nhad seemed like you were seeing Harry Styles everywhere you turned.\nYou had always been a big fan of his, ever since his one direction\ndays. You had secretly had the biggest crush on him, and he had\ndefinitely been way more handsome in person.</p><p>You\nhad hoped to have a quiet evening in, maybe with a glass of wine. However, you\nfound yourself in one of the most popular clubs in town. You were\nalready a bit tipsy. Your friends had convinced you to take a few\nshoots already. Deciding to let lose a bit, you gave in.</p><p>You\nhadn&rsquo;t been paying much attention to the large crowd of people, so\nyou had not noticed Harry sitting at the bar alone. Eric declared you\nthe next person to grab drinks for the group and with a sigh you\nagreed.</p><p>Walking\nup to the bar, you were looking towards the ground. Lost in a daze,\nyou gave your order to the young man behind the counter. He gave you\na friendly smile, as he went to fetch your drinks.</p><p>You\nstared at the wall, as you waited. You were getting rather tired from\nthe alcohol and knew you should be calling it a night. You had work\nearly in the morning and had never been a morning person.</p><p>The\nbartender arrived with your drinks quickly. Reaching in your pocket\nyou started to give him your card. He stopped you and shook his hand.\nConfused you listened as he explained.</p><p>\u201cThat\nwont be necessary,\u201d he assured you. \u201cIt&rsquo;s been taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Looking\naround, you wondered who on earth would have done this for you. You\nnoticed from the corner of your eyes a man glancing your way. Upon\nfurther inspection you froze. Harry was just off to your right,\nstaring your way. He gave you a shy smile and turned the other way.</p><p>Boldly\nyou decided to thank him. Approaching him, you smiled. It must have\nbeen all the alcohol that had given you the courage. You would\nnormally never do something like this.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndidn&rsquo;t have to do that, you know.\u201d You spoke softly from beside\nhim.</p><p>\u201cWas\nit that obvious?\u201d He said coolly.</p><p>Laughing\nslightly, you shook your head. He gave you a smirk, and you tried\nyour best to keep your cool. \u201cWell, although highly unnecessary,\nthank you for the kind gesture.\u201d You told him sincerely.</p><p>\u201cThe\npleasure is all mine, love.\u201d He told you honestly.</p><p>Hearing\nyour friends calling your name, you turned towards them\nautomatically. \u201cWell I guess I should be getting back to my\nfriends,\u201d you told him a bit disappointed. \u201cThanks again for the\ndrinks. I hope you have a goodnight Harry.\u201d You told him giving him\na warm smile.</p><p>Turning\naway, you carried the drinks back to your group.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nwas all that about?\u201d Eric asked curious.</p><p>\u201cWhat\ndo you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nsaw you talking to that guy at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh..\nYeah.. It was nothing,\u201d you told him casually. Taking a sip of your\ndrink, you hoped he would drop the subject.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou know him?\u201d</p><p>You\nraised your brows, \u201cDon&rsquo;t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\nShould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s\nHarry Styles.\u201d When he still looked at you confused, you continued.\n\u201cHe&rsquo;s an extremely talented singer and songwriter. Any of this\nringing a bell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ncan&rsquo;t say that it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\ncome on! I play his music for you all the time!\u201d You told him\nexasperated.</p><p>\u201cOhhh\nyeahhh I remember that crap you torture me with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s\nnot crap! It&rsquo;s amazing and beautiful. I can&rsquo;t help it if you don&rsquo;t\nhave good taste in music.\u201d You tell him a bit offended.</p><p>\u201cWhatever\nyou say.\u201d He said automatically. \u201cSo what did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\ndidn&rsquo;t want anything,\u201d you said annoyed.</p><p>\u201cYeah\nright,\u201d he said with a snort.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nwhat is that suppose to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook\nall I know is that I don&rsquo;t like the guy. There&rsquo;s something off about\nhim. He asked about you today, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nwait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday,\nafter you left the coffee house, he came up to me and asked me where\nyou worked.\u201d</p><p>You\nthought that over for a moment. &lsquo;Harry Styles wanted to know where\nyou worked? How strange.&rsquo;</p><p>\u201cHmm..\u201d\nYou stated simply.</p><p>\u201cI\nthink he fancies you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric,\nno one says fancies anymore,\u201d you tease. \u201cBesides, I&rsquo;m sure your\nwrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndoubt it,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou&rsquo;re quite the catch, even if you\ndon&rsquo;t see it.\u201d</p><p>At\nthis, you were not sure what to say. You had always known how Eric\nfelt about you, but you were never able to return the affection. It\nkilled you knowing that you hurt him by not loving him in the way\nthat he so clearly wanted. However, your heart just wasn&rsquo;t into him.\nYou couldn&rsquo;t help the way you felt.</p><p>\u201cWell..\nI should really be calling it a night,\u201d you told him changing the\nsubject.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\nNo! You can&rsquo;t go yet, it&rsquo;s only 11!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nbut some of us have to be up at 6 a.m to open the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d\nhe muttered pouting.</p><p>\u201cOh\ndon&rsquo;t give me that! You better just be glad I came out, even when I&rsquo;m\nbeyond exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow, I know.

These days, he\nrarely went out to clubs. He spent his free time at home, or with\nfamily. Today, however, he wanted to get the beautiful y/n out of his\nmind. \n</p><p>The\nwhole gang was in attendance. It was Harry\u2019s, unofficial, celebration\nof his debut album. The album had been widely popular and extremely\nsuccessful. Harry had been over the moon. Part of him worried that\npeople wouldn\u2019t like his new sound, and another part of him felt like\nhis fans wouldn\u2019t accept him without the other boys.</p><p>He\nhad struggled with mixed emotions ever since the band had went their\nseparate ways. He missed his mates dearly and wished things could\nhave turned out differently. However, he wished them all nothing but\nthe best! He would always be one of their biggest fans, cheering them\non from the sidelines.</p><p>Harry\nsipped on his whiskey, as he watched his friends chatting. There were\nnothing but laughs between the lot of them. He enjoyed moments like\nthis and wished he could have them more often. He knew he needed to\ntake some more time for himself.</p><p>He\nwas lost in deep thought, when Mitch nudged him. \u201cHey Harry. Isn\u2019t\nthat your girlfriend?\u201d He teased.</p><p>Harry\u2019s\nhead shot up and turned in the direction he was pointing. Sure\nenough, the stunning y/n stood in the corner with a group of her\nfriends. She was wearing a tight black dress and had her hair down up\nin a bun.</p><p>To\nMitch\u2019s great pleasure, Harry blushed ever so slightly.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d\nSarah chimed in. \u201cWhat did I miss?? What is this about a\ngirlfriend, Harry??\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nnothing!\u201d Harry groaned shooting Mitch a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cOur\nyoung heart throb here is in loveee.\u201d Mitch chuckled.</p><p>\u201cIn\nlove??\u201d Sarah asked wide eyed \u201cSounds serious. Well go on with\nit, tell us about her.\u201d</p><p>Downing\nthe rest of his drink, Harry smirked. \u201cYou know I would, but I need\na refill.\u201d</p><p>He\nstood up and headed to the bar. He smiled when he heard his friends\nprotests from behind him. He was certain that Mitch would fill them\nall in, while he was gone.</p><p>Harry\nordered his drink, and waited at the bar. Out of the corner of his\neye, he noticed the girl approach. She stood in front of the bar,\njust to the left of Harry. He watched her give her order the\nbartender. She was getting drinks for the entire group. She looked\nslightly flushed from the alcohol, and it made her all the more\nalluring.</p><p>When\nhis drink was made, Harry made a decision. Discreetly he asked the\nman behind the counter to pay for both his and her drinks for the\nnight. Giving him a smile, he took the card willingly.</p><p>The\ngirl was beyond surprised, when her drinks were ready. She reached in\nher pocket, but was stopped and told what had happened. Although the\nbartender didn\u2019t mention a name, she turned her head to both sides\nand then spotted Harry.</p><p>It\nwouldn\u2019t have been obvious that it was him, if not for him staring.\nEmbarrassed, he gave her a shake of his head and turned back to the\nfront.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndidn\u2019t have to do that, you know.\u201d She spoke softly from beside\nhim.</p><p>Shocked he turned her way. \u201cWas it that obvious?\u201d He said coolly.</p><p>Laughing\nslightly, she shook her head. Her eyes were dancing with excitement,\nas Harry watched on. \u201cWell, although highly unnecessary, thank you\nfor the kind gesture.\u201d She told him sincerely.</p><p>\u201cThe\npleasure is all mine, love.\u201d He told her honestly.</p><p>Hearing\nher friends calling her name, she briefly turned away. \u201cWell I\nguess I should be getting back to my friends,\u201d she told him. He\nwasn\u2019t sure, but he thought he saw sadness in her eyes. She gave him\na warm smile. \u201cThanks again for the drinks. I hope you have a\ngoodnight Harry.\u201d</p><p>Hearing\nhis name roll of her tongue so smoothly, made his heart skip a beat.\nHe watched her walk back to her group, longingly.</p><p>She\nconfounded him. She conformed that she had known his identity, yet\nshe still treated him like any other person. He found it to be quite\nrefreshing, a nice and welcomed change.</p><p>He\nwatched her for a moment longer. Noticing her talking to Eric, he\nstarted to get panicky. He had known that Eric would tell her of\ntheir encounter, and he had hoped that she wouldn\u2019t find him strange.\nWhen Eric pointed in Harry\u2019s direction, his face grew red.</p><p>He\ndecided to return to his friends. He wanted to disappear into the\ncrowd, or rather have a hole open in the floor and swallow him whole.</p><p>His\nfriends were still laughing and caring on at his expense. They,\nwithout a doubt, had seen what had gone on at the bar. Before long,\nhe had become restless. He decided that it was time to call it a\nnight. He wanted to get out of there before y/n decided to confront\nhim.</p><p>Telling\nhis friends goodbye, he quickly made his way to the exit. Without a\nbackward glance, he left the club.</p><p><br></p><p>*********************************************</p><h2>YOUR\nPOINT OF VIEW</h2><p><br></p><p>Against\nyour better judgment, you decided to join Eric at the club. He had\nbegged and pleaded with you for the better part of the day. You were\nbeyond exhausted from the extra hours you had been putting in at\nwork, but he wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer.</p><p>You\ndecided to take pity on him and agreed to have one drink with him.\nYou got dressed up, deciding to spend extra care on your appearance.\nNormally, you didn\u2019t care how you looked. However, you had a feeling\nsomething might happen tonight.</p><p>It\nhad seemed like you were seeing Harry Styles everywhere you turned.\nYou had always been a big fan of his, ever since his one direction\ndays. You had secretly had the biggest crush on him, and he had\ndefinitely been way more handsome in person.</p><p>You\nhad hoped to have a quiet evening in, maybe with a glass of wine. However, you\nfound yourself in one of the most popular clubs in town. You were\nalready a bit tipsy. Your friends had convinced you to take a few\nshoots already. Deciding to let lose a bit, you gave in.</p><p>You\nhadn\u2019t been paying much attention to the large crowd of people, so\nyou had not noticed Harry sitting at the bar alone. Eric declared you\nthe next person to grab drinks for the group and with a sigh you\nagreed.</p><p>Walking\nup to the bar, you were looking towards the ground. Lost in a daze,\nyou gave your order to the young man behind the counter. He gave you\na friendly smile, as he went to fetch your drinks.</p><p>You\nstared at the wall, as you waited. You were getting rather tired from\nthe alcohol and knew you should be calling it a night. You had work\nearly in the morning and had never been a morning person.</p><p>The\nbartender arrived with your drinks quickly. Reaching in your pocket\nyou started to give him your card. He stopped you and shook his hand.\nConfused you listened as he explained.</p><p>\u201cThat\nwont be necessary,\u201d he assured you. \u201cIt\u2019s been taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Looking\naround, you wondered who on earth would have done this for you. You\nnoticed from the corner of your eyes a man glancing your way. Upon\nfurther inspection you froze. Harry was just off to your right,\nstaring your way. He gave you a shy smile and turned the other way.</p><p>Boldly\nyou decided to thank him. Approaching him, you smiled. It must have\nbeen all the alcohol that had given you the courage. You would\nnormally never do something like this.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndidn\u2019t have to do that, you know.\u201d You spoke softly from beside\nhim.</p><p>\u201cWas\nit that obvious?\u201d He said coolly.</p><p>Laughing\nslightly, you shook your head. He gave you a smirk, and you tried\nyour best to keep your cool. \u201cWell, although highly unnecessary,\nthank you for the kind gesture.\u201d You told him sincerely.</p><p>\u201cThe\npleasure is all mine, love.\u201d He told you honestly.</p><p>Hearing\nyour friends calling your name, you turned towards them\nautomatically. \u201cWell I guess I should be getting back to my\nfriends,\u201d you told him a bit disappointed. \u201cThanks again for the\ndrinks. I hope you have a goodnight Harry.\u201d You told him giving him\na warm smile.</p><p>Turning\naway, you carried the drinks back to your group.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nwas all that about?\u201d Eric asked curious.</p><p>\u201cWhat\ndo you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nsaw you talking to that guy at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh..\nYeah.. It was nothing,\u201d you told him casually. Taking a sip of your\ndrink, you hoped he would drop the subject.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou know him?\u201d</p><p>You\nraised your brows, \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\nShould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nHarry Styles.\u201d When he still looked at you confused, you continued.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an extremely talented singer and songwriter. Any of this\nringing a bell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ncan\u2019t say that it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\ncome on! I play his music for you all the time!\u201d You told him\nexasperated.</p><p>\u201cOhhh\nyeahhh I remember that crap you torture me with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nnot crap! It\u2019s amazing and beautiful. I can\u2019t help it if you don\u2019t\nhave good taste in music.\u201d You tell him a bit offended.</p><p>\u201cWhatever\nyou say.\u201d He said automatically. \u201cSo what did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\ndidn\u2019t want anything,\u201d you said annoyed.</p><p>\u201cYeah\nright,\u201d he said with a snort.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nwhat is that suppose to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook\nall I know is that I don\u2019t like the guy. There\u2019s something off about\nhim. He asked about you today, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nwait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday,\nafter you left the coffee house, he came up to me and asked me where\nyou worked.\u201d</p><p>You\nthought that over for a moment. \u2018Harry Styles wanted to know where\nyou worked? How strange.\u2019</p><p>\u201cHmm..\u201d\nYou stated simply.</p><p>\u201cI\nthink he fancies you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric,\nno one says fancies anymore,\u201d you tease. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m sure your\nwrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndoubt it,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re quite the catch, even if you\ndon\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>At\nthis, you were not sure what to say. You had always known how Eric\nfelt about you, but you were never able to return the affection. It\nkilled you knowing that you hurt him by not loving him in the way\nthat he so clearly wanted. However, your heart just wasn\u2019t into him.\nYou couldn\u2019t help the way you felt.</p><p>\u201cWell..\nI should really be calling it a night,\u201d you told him changing the\nsubject.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\nNo! You can\u2019t go yet, it\u2019s only 11!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nbut some of us have to be up at 6 a.m to open the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d\nhe muttered pouting.</p><p>\u201cOh\ndon\u2019t give me that! You better just be glad I came out, even when I\u2019m\nbeyond exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow, I know. Coffee tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d\nyou confirmed with a smile.</p><p>Giving\nhim a peck on the cheek, you told the rest of your friends goodbye.\nUpon leaving, you scanned the room. A part of you had hoped Harry was\nstill there, and you could talk to him once more. However, to your\ndisappointment, he was no where in sight. Sighing you left the club\nand walked the short distance to your apartment.</p><p>That\nnight, you fell into a fitful sleep. Your dreams consisted of\npiercing emerald eyes, and smoldering looks. It was not the first\ntime you had a dream of Harry, but there was something different\nabout this one.

He stopped you and shook his hand.\nConfused you listened as he explained.</p><p>\u201cThat\nwont be necessary,\u201d he assured you. \u201cIt\u2019s been taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Looking\naround, you wondered who on earth would have done this for you. You\nnoticed from the corner of your eyes a man glancing your way. Upon\nfurther inspection you froze. Harry was just off to your right,\nstaring your way. He gave you a shy smile and turned the other way.</p><p>Boldly\nyou decided to thank him. Approaching him, you smiled. It must have\nbeen all the alcohol that had given you the courage. You would\nnormally never do something like this.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndidn\u2019t have to do that, you know.\u201d You spoke softly from beside\nhim.</p><p>\u201cWas\nit that obvious?\u201d He said coolly.</p><p>Laughing\nslightly, you shook your head. He gave you a smirk, and you tried\nyour best to keep your cool. \u201cWell, although highly unnecessary,\nthank you for the kind gesture.\u201d You told him sincerely.</p><p>\u201cThe\npleasure is all mine, love.\u201d He told you honestly.</p><p>Hearing\nyour friends calling your name, you turned towards them\nautomatically. \u201cWell I guess I should be getting back to my\nfriends,\u201d you told him a bit disappointed. \u201cThanks again for the\ndrinks. I hope you have a goodnight Harry.\u201d You told him giving him\na warm smile.</p><p>Turning\naway, you carried the drinks back to your group.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nwas all that about?\u201d Eric asked curious.</p><p>\u201cWhat\ndo you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nsaw you talking to that guy at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh..\nYeah.. It was nothing,\u201d you told him casually. Taking a sip of your\ndrink, you hoped he would drop the subject.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou know him?\u201d</p><p>You\nraised your brows, \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\nShould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nHarry Styles.\u201d When he still looked at you confused, you continued.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an extremely talented singer and songwriter. Any of this\nringing a bell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ncan\u2019t say that it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\ncome on! I play his music for you all the time!\u201d You told him\nexasperated.</p><p>\u201cOhhh\nyeahhh I remember that crap you torture me with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nnot crap! It\u2019s amazing and beautiful. I can\u2019t help it if you don\u2019t\nhave good taste in music.\u201d You tell him a bit offended.</p><p>\u201cWhatever\nyou say.\u201d He said automatically. \u201cSo what did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\ndidn\u2019t want anything,\u201d you said annoyed.</p><p>\u201cYeah\nright,\u201d he said with a snort.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nwhat is that suppose to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook\nall I know is that I don\u2019t like the guy. There\u2019s something off about\nhim. He asked about you today, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nwait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday,\nafter you left the coffee house, he came up to me and asked me where\nyou worked.\u201d</p><p>You\nthought that over for a moment. \u2018Harry Styles wanted to know where\nyou worked? How strange.\u2019</p><p>\u201cHmm..\u201d\nYou stated simply.</p><p>\u201cI\nthink he fancies you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric,\nno one says fancies anymore,\u201d you tease. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m sure your\nwrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndoubt it,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re quite the catch, even if you\ndon\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>At\nthis, you were not sure what to say. You had always known how Eric\nfelt about you, but you were never able to return the affection. It\nkilled you knowing that you hurt him by not loving him in the way\nthat he so clearly wanted. However, your heart just wasn\u2019t into him.\nYou couldn\u2019t help the way you felt.</p><p>\u201cWell..\nI should really be calling it a night,\u201d you told him changing the\nsubject.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\nNo! You can\u2019t go yet, it\u2019s only 11!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nbut some of us have to be up at 6 a.m to open the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d\nhe muttered pouting.</p><p>\u201cOh\ndon\u2019t give me that! You better just be glad I came out, even when I\u2019m\nbeyond exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow, I know. Coffee tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d\nyou confirmed with a smile.</p><p>Giving\nhim a peck on the cheek, you told the rest of your friends goodbye.\nUpon leaving, you scanned the room. A part of you had hoped Harry was\nstill there, and you could talk to him once more. However, to your\ndisappointment, he was no where in sight. Sighing you left the club\nand walked the short distance to your apartment.</p><p>That\nnight, you fell into a fitful sleep. Your dreams consisted of\npiercing emerald eyes, and smoldering looks. It was not the first\ntime you had a dream of Harry, but there was something different\nabout this one.

                "content": "<p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>That\nnight, Harry decided to go out with his friends. These days, he\nrarely went out to clubs. He spent his free time at home, or with\nfamily. Today, however, he wanted to get the beautiful y/n out of his\nmind. \n</p><p>The\nwhole gang was in attendance. It was Harry&rsquo;s, unofficial, celebration\nof his debut album. The album had been widely popular and extremely\nsuccessful. Harry had been over the moon. Part of him worried that\npeople wouldn&rsquo;t like his new sound, and another part of him felt like\nhis fans wouldn&rsquo;t accept him without the other boys.</p><p>He\nhad struggled with mixed emotions ever since the band had went their\nseparate ways. He missed his mates dearly and wished things could\nhave turned out differently. However, he wished them all nothing but\nthe best! He would always be one of their biggest fans, cheering them\non from the sidelines.</p><p>Harry\nsipped on his whiskey, as he watched his friends chatting. There were\nnothing but laughs between the lot of them. He enjoyed moments like\nthis and wished he could have them more often. He knew he needed to\ntake some more time for himself.</p><p>He\nwas lost in deep thought, when Mitch nudged him. &ldquo;Hey Harry. Isn&rsquo;t\nthat your girlfriend?&rdquo; He teased.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s\nhead shot up and turned in the direction he was pointing. Sure\nenough, the stunning y/n stood in the corner with a group of her\nfriends. She was wearing a tight black dress and had her hair down up\nin a bun.</p><p>To\nMitch&rsquo;s great pleasure, Harry blushed ever so slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;\nSarah chimed in. &ldquo;What did I miss?? What is this about a\ngirlfriend, Harry??&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nnothing!&rdquo; Harry groaned shooting Mitch a dirty look.</p><p>&ldquo;Our\nyoung heart throb here is in loveee.&rdquo; Mitch chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;In\nlove??&rdquo; Sarah asked wide eyed &ldquo;Sounds serious. Well go on with\nit, tell us about her.&rdquo;</p><p>Downing\nthe rest of his drink, Harry smirked. &ldquo;You know I would, but I need\na refill.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nstood up and headed to the bar. He smiled when he heard his friends\nprotests from behind him. He was certain that Mitch would fill them\nall in, while he was gone.</p><p>Harry\nordered his drink, and waited at the bar. Out of the corner of his\neye, he noticed the girl approach. She stood in front of the bar,\njust to the left of Harry. He watched her give her order the\nbartender. She was getting drinks for the entire group. She looked\nslightly flushed from the alcohol, and it made her all the more\nalluring.</p><p>When\nhis drink was made, Harry made a decision. Discreetly he asked the\nman behind the counter to pay for both his and her drinks for the\nnight. Giving him a smile, he took the card willingly.</p><p>The\ngirl was beyond surprised, when her drinks were ready. She reached in\nher pocket, but was stopped and told what had happened. Although the\nbartender didn&rsquo;t mention a name, she turned her head to both sides\nand then spotted Harry.</p><p>It\nwouldn&rsquo;t have been obvious that it was him, if not for him staring.\nEmbarrassed, he gave her a shake of his head and turned back to the\nfront.</p><p>&ldquo;You\ndidn&rsquo;t have to do that, you know.&rdquo; She spoke softly from beside\nhim.</p><p>Shocked he turned her way. &ldquo;Was it that obvious?&rdquo; He said coolly.</p><p>Laughing\nslightly, she shook her head. Her eyes were dancing with excitement,\nas Harry watched on. &ldquo;Well, although highly unnecessary, thank you\nfor the kind gesture.&rdquo; She told him sincerely.</p><p>&ldquo;The\npleasure is all mine, love.&rdquo; He told her honestly.</p><p>Hearing\nher friends calling her name, she briefly turned away. &ldquo;Well I\nguess I should be getting back to my friends,&rdquo; she told him. He\nwasn&rsquo;t sure, but he thought he saw sadness in her eyes. She gave him\na warm smile. &ldquo;Thanks again for the drinks. I hope you have a\ngoodnight Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing\nhis name roll of her tongue so smoothly, made his heart skip a beat.\nHe watched her walk back to her group, longingly.</p><p>She\nconfounded him. She conformed that she had known his identity, yet\nshe still treated him like any other person. He found it to be quite\nrefreshing, a nice and welcomed change.</p><p>He\nwatched her for a moment longer. Noticing her talking to Eric, he\nstarted to get panicky. He had known that Eric would tell her of\ntheir encounter, and he had hoped that she wouldn&rsquo;t find him strange.\nWhen Eric pointed in Harry&rsquo;s direction, his face grew red.</p><p>He\ndecided to return to his friends. He wanted to disappear into the\ncrowd, or rather have a hole open in the floor and swallow him whole.</p><p>His\nfriends were still laughing and caring on at his expense. They,\nwithout a doubt, had seen what had gone on at the bar. Before long,\nhe had become restless. He decided that it was time to call it a\nnight. He wanted to get out of there before y/n decided to confront\nhim.</p><p>Telling\nhis friends goodbye, he quickly made his way to the exit. Without a\nbackward glance, he left the club.</p><p><br /></p><p>*********************************************</p><h2>YOUR\nPOINT OF VIEW</h2><p><br /></p><p>Against\nyour better judgment, you decided to join Eric at the club. He had\nbegged and pleaded with you for the better part of the day. You were\nbeyond exhausted from the extra hours you had been putting in at\nwork, but he wasn&rsquo;t taking no for an answer.</p><p>You\ndecided to take pity on him and agreed to have one drink with him.\nYou got dressed up, deciding to spend extra care on your appearance.\nNormally, you didn&rsquo;t care how you looked. However, you had a feeling\nsomething might happen tonight.</p><p>It\nhad seemed like you were seeing Harry Styles everywhere you turned.\nYou had always been a big fan of his, ever since his one direction\ndays. You had secretly had the biggest crush on him, and he had\ndefinitely been way more handsome in person.</p><p>You\nhad hoped to have a quiet evening in, maybe with a glass of wine. However, you\nfound yourself in one of the most popular clubs in town. You were\nalready a bit tipsy. Your friends had convinced you to take a few\nshoots already. Deciding to let lose a bit, you gave in.</p><p>You\nhadn&rsquo;t been paying much attention to the large crowd of people, so\nyou had not noticed Harry sitting at the bar alone. Eric declared you\nthe next person to grab drinks for the group and with a sigh you\nagreed.</p><p>Walking\nup to the bar, you were looking towards the ground. Lost in a daze,\nyou gave your order to the young man behind the counter. He gave you\na friendly smile, as he went to fetch your drinks.</p><p>You\nstared at the wall, as you waited. You were getting rather tired from\nthe alcohol and knew you should be calling it a night. You had work\nearly in the morning and had never been a morning person.</p><p>The\nbartender arrived with your drinks quickly. Reaching in your pocket\nyou started to give him your card.
