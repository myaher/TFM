But he was wrong, because the next time the angel looks his way he&rsquo;s practically falling asleep on his own two feet. Aziraphale shakes his head and makes his way over to his old friend- who maybe, over the course of the past few days, has become something more than a friend- and gently takes him by the arm.</p><p>&ldquo;You know there&rsquo;s a sofa in the back,&rdquo; he hums. Crowley allows himself to be led to said piece of furniture.</p><p>&ldquo;Sofa, right.&rdquo; He drops down on it as soon as they reach it and Aziraphale removes the demon&rsquo;s jacket and sunglasses with a tenderness that makes Crowley feel even more at ease; a feat he didn&rsquo;t believe was possible.</p><p>They say the eyes are the window to the soul, and angels are especially gifted at reading what hides behind those windows. The moment Crowley&rsquo;s glasses come off, Aziraphale can tell something&rsquo;s on his mind, and he has a pretty good idea of what it is. But it will wait for now, he decides. There&rsquo;s a more pressing matter at hand. </p><p>While Aziraphale sets the jacket and sunglasses down, Crowley removes his shoes and reclines against the soft cushions beneath him. It takes a real miracle to keep him from falling asleep immediately.

Crowley smiles gratefully.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I rather like sleep,&rdquo; he hums, stifling another yawn. &ldquo;Wonderful invention, absolutely glorious. I could sleep forever really. Or a century.&rdquo; He has slept a century away, the angel remembers that hundred years well. Aziraphale shakes his head in amusement (and perhaps as a method of clearing his head of any thought of the fifteenth century).</p><p>&ldquo;Not quite as glorious as tea, but you do have a point.&rdquo; Crowley&rsquo;s too tired to make a proper response so he simply sticks his tongue out at the angel and hisses before closing his eyes. Aziraphale smiles as he moves to leave the room, offering a quiet <i>&ldquo;sweet dreams, my dear&rdquo;</i>, as he went, but when he gets to the door he can&rsquo;t help but pause and look back at Crowley, curled up and cozy on the couch. </p><p>Aziraphale wants to open up shop and get back to the way things have been since the sixteenth century. He wants to make sure his books are all in order (even though he knows Crowley likely already made sure of that). But perhaps more than those wants there&rsquo;s a need tugging at his heart, and after a few seconds&rsquo; pause he decides to ignore his wants for the time being. He makes his way to the front of the store, makes sure the sign is flipped to close, and returns to the back room with Crowley. He isn&rsquo;t sure if the demon is fully asleep, but he doesn&rsquo;t so much as stir while Aziraphale carefully lifts his head and shoulders so that he can take a seat, letting Crowley&rsquo;s head rest on his lap now.
