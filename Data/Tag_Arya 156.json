Plainly she was but a <b>catspaw </b>&hellip; but whose? Did the <b>boy king</b> himself send her forth, or was she mayhaps an agent of his Hand, Rogar <b>Baratheon</b>, or his <b>mother</b>, the Queen Regent? Some came to believe that the <b>woman was one of the Faceless Men</b>, the infamous guild of sorcerer-assassins from Braavos. In support of this claim, they cited her sudden disappearance, the way she seemed to \u201c<b>melt into the night</b>\u201d after the murder, and the fact that Septon Moon\u2019s guards could not agree on what she looked like. <br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Wiser man and those familiar with the ways of the Faceless Men give this theory little credence. The very <b>clumsiness of Moon\u2019s murder</b> speaks against it being their work, for the Faceless Men take great care to make their killings appear as natural deaths. It is a point of pride with them, the very cornerstone of their art. <b>Slitting a man\u2019s throat </b>and leaving him to stagger forth into the night screaming of murder is beneath them. Most scholars today believe that the killer was no more than a camp follower, acting at the behest of either Lord Rowan or Lord Oakheart, or mayhaps the both of them. Though neither dared desert Moon whilst he live, the alacrity with which the two lords abandoned his cause after his death suggests that their grievance had been with Maegor, not with House Targaryen&hellip;. and indeed, both men would soon return to Oldtown, penitent and obedient, to bend the knee before Prince Jaehaerys at his coronation.

                "content": "<p>We are currently discussing this possible scenario over at <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN2Tk4D3PoYooipN6QjDY2Q\">@delulumeta</a> and while looking at Fire and Blood I came across this story, which is a clear hint at Arya killing D and I just couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation to share this.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<b>Moon</b>&rsquo;s murder removed the <b>last major obstacle</b> to the acession of Jaehaerys Targaryen to the Iron Throne, but from that day to this, debate has raged as to who was responsible for his death. No one truly believed that the woman who attempted to poison the &ldquo;sinful septon&rdquo; and ended by <b>cutting his throat </b>was acting on her won. Plainly she was but a <b>catspaw </b>&hellip; but whose? Did the <b>boy king</b> himself send her forth, or was she mayhaps an agent of his Hand, Rogar <b>Baratheon</b>, or his <b>mother</b>, the Queen Regent? Some came to believe that the <b>woman was one of the Faceless Men</b>, the infamous guild of sorcerer-assassins from Braavos. In support of this claim, they cited her sudden disappearance, the way she seemed to &ldquo;<b>melt into the night</b>&rdquo; after the murder, and the fact that Septon Moon&rsquo;s guards could not agree on what she looked like. <br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Wiser man and those familiar with the ways of the Faceless Men give this theory little credence. The very <b>clumsiness of Moon&rsquo;s murder</b> speaks against it being their work, for the Faceless Men take great care to make their killings appear as natural deaths. It is a point of pride with them, the very cornerstone of their art. <b>Slitting a man&rsquo;s throat </b>and leaving him to stagger forth into the night screaming of murder is beneath them. Most scholars today believe that the killer was no more than a camp follower, acting at the behest of either Lord Rowan or Lord Oakheart, or mayhaps the both of them. Though neither dared desert Moon whilst he live, the alacrity with which the two lords abandoned his cause after his death suggests that their grievance had been with Maegor, not with House Targaryen&hellip;. and indeed, both men would soon return to Oldtown, penitent and obedient, to bend the knee before Prince Jaehaerys at his coronation. (Fire and Blood, The Ascencion of Jaehaerys I).</p></blockquote><p>So, we have a female assassin who is a faceless man or maybe not - just like Arya is a female assassin who is not a real faceless man. She left the House of Black and White before her education was formerly over. Like Arya in the mercy chapter this female assassin kills her target by seducing him and then slitting his throat. In the show the &lsquo;slitting a man&rsquo;s throat&rsquo; has become something like a trademark for Arya. Also the woman meling into the night may evoke the &ldquo;quiet as a shadow&rdquo;-stealthiness that Arya already learned with Syrio Forel. It is also interesting that the word catspaw is used. It could be an allusion to Cat = Catelyn as Arya&rsquo;s mother or to the dagger Arya wears in the show. We don&rsquo;t know the dagger&rsquo;s name in the books yet, but the show gives it as catspaw. <br /></p><p>But why Da&euro;nerys as the victim? Septon Moon is the last obstacle against the acession of Jaehaerys I, a king who clearly has parallels to Jon, Da&euro;nerys is the last obstacle to Jon&rsquo;s acession. It is also interesting that a Baratheon is involved, which might point towards the fact that Gendry will play a role in Arya&rsquo;s decision to save Jon by killing Da&euro;nerys. The mentioning of Jaehaerys&rsquo; mother might point towards Lyanna, Jon&rsquo;s mother, who made Ned promise to protect Jon. This oath of protection will be fulfilled by the next generation, and Arya killing Da&euro;nerys to save Jon is a possible scenario.</p><p>Last, not least, the septon who is killed here is named &ldquo;Moon&rdquo; and I just alert you to these:</p><blockquote><p>\n&ldquo;A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the <b>moon</b>,&rdquo;\n blond Doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire. Jhiqui and Irri \nwere of an age with Dany, Dothraki girls taken as slaves when Drogo \ndestroyed their father&rsquo;s khalasar. Doreah was older, almost twenty. \nMagister Illyrio had found her in a pleasure house in Lys.\n &nbsp;&nbsp; (AGOT, Da&euro;nerys III) <br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n&ldquo;My brother Rhaegar was a \nfierce warrior, my sun-and-stars,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;He died before I was \nborn. Ser Jorah says that he was the last of the dragons.&rdquo;\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Khal Drogo looked down at her. His face was a copper mask, yet \nunder the long black mustache, drooping beneath the weight of its gold \nrings, she thought she glimpsed the shadow of a smile. &ldquo;Is good name, \nDan Ares wife, <b>moon</b> of my life,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;\n (AGOT, Da&euro;nerys V) <br /></p></blockquote><p>These show clearly that Da&euro;nerys is associated with the moon.<br /></p><p>Now there is also a hint in one of Jon&rsquo;s chapter which is usually thought to be a Jon&euro;rys foreshadowing:</p><blockquote><p>\nWhen they emerged north of the Wall, through a thick door made of \nfreshly hewn green wood, the wildling princess paused for a moment to \ngaze out across the snow-covered field where King Stannis had won his \nbattle. Beyond, the haunted forest waited, dark and silent. The light of\n the half-<b>moon</b> turned Val&rsquo;s honey-blond hair a pale silver and \nleft her cheeks as white as snow. She took a deep breath. &ldquo;The air \ntastes sweet.&rdquo; <br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n&ldquo;My tongue is too numb to tell. All I can taste is cold.&rdquo;\n\n(ADWD, Jon&nbsp; VIII)</p></blockquote><p>With the passage from Fire and Blood in mind, this does even sound more ominous, but there is also this:</p><blockquote><p>\n&ldquo;Every man who walks the earth casts a shadow on the world. Some are \nthin and weak, others long and dark. You should look behind you, Lord \nSnow. The <b>moon</b> has kissed you and etched your shadow upon the ice twenty feet tall.&rdquo; (ADWD, Jon VI)</p></blockquote><p>This is usually also seen as a Jon&euro;rys foreshadowing, but again with the killing of the Moon as told in F&amp;B it is also rather ominous - neither shadows nor cold are a nice foreshadowing.</p><p>So, Arya will&nbsp; - maybe for the sake of Gendry Baratheon, Lyanna and Jon himself, not necessarily on his order or wish -&nbsp; kill Da&euro;nerys, probably by slitting her throat with Catspaw. This will be the last obstacle against the acession of Jon as king and it will mean the death of the dragons as well. <br /></p>",
