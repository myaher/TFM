The bride-to-be was probably influenced by their family tradition \u2014 in this house, they never threw away old things, instead they either tried to fix them or hid them somewhere in case they might need them again. Most of those things ended up in the attic.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do it yourself? I&rsquo;m busy,&rdquo; Y/N lied in order to get away with the little favor, only to realize how dumb she sounded. If she was in London, it would made total sense since the big city life was always in a rush. But now that she was in Holmes Chapel, how could she possibly be busy? All the people she wanted to be with were now far away. The only thing she could do was drive around town or bring a book to a coffee shop in her neighborhood to read the day away.</p><p>Marcy only gave Y/N a smile, ignoring the lame excuse as she insisted, &ldquo;I would, but I&rsquo;m allergic to dust. It&rsquo;ll only take a minute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lucky you,&rdquo; Y/N muttered as she rolled her eyes and marched down the stairs to take the books and magazines from her future stepmother.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Marcy thanked her for it before rushing back to the kitchen, probably to check on those cookies in the oven for her own wedding tomorrow morning.\u00a0It was only a small celebration so the family did everything by themselves without hiring any wedding planner. Now that the decoration was all finished, Y/N wasn&rsquo;t much useful around the house since she couldn&rsquo;t cook. Therefore she told herself it was only fair if she did the small favor for Marcy.</p><p>To be honest, Y/N couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time she&rsquo;d gone to the attic. That place used to be her nightmare when she was a little girl. The thought of evil creatures lurking in the dark among dusty old furniture and shelves was the reason she&rsquo;d slept with the light on for an entire month after climbing up there once out of curiosity. Now that she was an adult, it was barely more than a crawl space with low ceiling and mould. She had to hang her head to walk in, trying to locate obstacles in the dark for the only source of light was from the long narrow windows near the ceiling.</p><p>The unsoftened echo of her footsteps on the floor made of timber brought on a claustrophobic feeling, and so she put the books and magazines in the corner to hurry back to the ladder as fast as she could.</p><p>Right before she reached the entrance, Y/N tripped over a small table and almost lost her balance. But she didn&rsquo;t fall, instead she knocked over a dusty carton box which fell onto the floor and created a loud thump that echoed within the confined space. Dust flying all over the place got the girl coughing uncontrollably, still she decided to bend down and clean up the mess she&rsquo;d made.</p><p>The first thing that got her attention was a portrait of her younger self, sketched by her mother. Everything in that box belonged to her mother. Most of them were drawings and souvenirs she&rsquo;d bought on their family trips. Y/N had no idea how long they&rsquo;d been in this attic, but judging from the yellow hue of the paper, she would guess that they had been there since her mother was still alive.</p><p>As a result, Y/N ended up staying in the attic for longer than she&rsquo;d intended to. She sat on the floor, going through the rest of the stuff in the box, feeling whole inside for the fact that most of her mother&rsquo;s sketches were of her face, some others were corners of their house and random objects like a tea set, a bowl of fruits, a flower vase,&hellip;</p><p>There wasn&rsquo;t anything unusual, until&hellip;<i>there was</i>.</p><p>At the bottom of the box lied a little tin box. The girl almost didn&rsquo;t see it for it was hidden too well. For some reason, just looking at it gave her a feeling that there was something inside she had to see.</p><p>With her heart thumping like a drum, she brought it to her lap and carefully opened it. It would&rsquo;ve been a huge disappointment if the box had been empty like she&rsquo;d feared, but her instinct rarely made a mistake. The box contained many letters written to her mother from a man named <i>Dave Hardfield, </i>alongside which was a photo of them together. His lips were on Tam&rsquo;s cheek and Y/N had never seen her mother smile that bright before. At first Y/N assumed the man used to be one of her mother&rsquo;s boyfriends before meeting her dad. However, when she looked at the date on each letter, she discovered the truth that&rsquo;d been hidden for all those years. Those letters, <i>love letters</i> to be exact, had all been written and sent when her parents were married already.</p><p>Y/N found out, to her dismay, there were worse fears than invisible monsters in the attic, it was the ones living within every person including the ones you thought you knew all too well.</p><p>She picked up one of the letters to read through the first few lines just to make sure she didn&rsquo;t draw any conclusion way too soon. But what she learnt wasn&rsquo;t what her heart wished it&rsquo;d be. Her mother had been in love, <i>madly</i> in love, but with another man, <i>not</i> her father.</p><p>She felt a lump in her throat when she read the part about them planning on leaving this town once the divorce had been settled. That letter came just a week before the accident.</p><p>The grip of her hands tightened, nearly tearing the page in two. She was so in shock that her brain stuttered for a moment and breathing became difficult. It took her a while to come back to her sense and gather everything besides the letter to put it back in the tin box before leaving.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t even think as she hurried down the ladder, marching straight to the front door while clutching the letter in her hand. This man, whoever he was, might have the answers to most of the questions she&rsquo;d been asking herself since her mother&rsquo;s death, beginning with what had happened the night of the accident. Y/N walked fast, wasting no time, yet her father appeared without warning to stop her right before she could reach for the doorknob.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; He asked, raising an eyebrow at his daughter, who was quick to hide the letter behind her back.</p><p>&ldquo;To a coffee shop,&rdquo; she said, trying too hard not to let her anxiety show. And maybe she was putting on such a good act that her dad didn&rsquo;t seem to suspect a thing.</p><p>&ldquo;I was hoping you would stay to help us out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will when I get back. Promise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not so fast, young lady.&rdquo; Bradford cleared his throat loudly as he clutched her by the arm when she barely managed to escape. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting strange. Are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo;</p><p>That reply was followed by the fakest laugh she&rsquo;d ever pulled. Even she knew that, how could her father not?</p><p>&ldquo;Is it\u2014&rdquo; The man paused to decide if he should make a guess. It wasn&rsquo;t really a guess since he already knew the truth. It was because of Harry. She&rsquo;d been crying for that boy and hurting for that boy, like she had most of her life. It was obvious. But then again, Bradford pretended like he had no clue. His daughter had never been a sentimental person, not openly at least. Maybe it was one thing they both had in common.</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind&hellip;&rdquo; He sighed, twitching his lips. &ldquo;Be back soon, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Smiling in return, Y/N gave her father a firm nod. &ldquo;Hey dad, can I borrow your car?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. But don&rsquo;t crash it.&rdquo;</p><p>It was meant to be a harmless joke. But as both of them came to realization, they just quietly stared at each other for two seconds long. Bradford handed her his car key, stuttering as he wanted to say something to lighten up the mood. Unfortunately, Y/N didn&rsquo;t hesitate to walk out of the door.</p><p>The truth was, she had no plan at all. She just knew she was going to see the man named Dave Hardfield, whose address was on the letters sent to her mum. She didn&rsquo;t even have the script of the things she should say, or the list of questions about everything she was dying to know. She just wanted to go see the man to learn the truth, whatever it was, even when she wasn&rsquo;t ready to hear it from a complete stranger.</p><p>Funny how one surprise came right after another without a single break. The last person Y/N would expect to show up in Holmes Chapel right now, was waiting right outside her house by his car.</p><p>&ldquo;Isaac?&rdquo; She gasped, walking fast towards the man whose smile was as bright as the sun when he saw her face. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was worried about you. Wanted to make sure you were alright.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&hellip;drove all the way here from London&hellip;to see me?&rdquo;</p><p>He took a deep breath, letting it all out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna tell me I&rsquo;m stupid for doing this, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>To his surprise, she shook her head fast and pulled him into a hug so tight that it almost took his breath away, <i>literally</i>. Y/N didn&rsquo;t seem to care as she kept repeating the words &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; into his shoulder, leaving him no choice but to also wrap his arms around her.</p><p>It finally occurred to her how desperate she was for a hug. It didn&rsquo;t matter whose. She just needed to feel a little bit of comfort after the series of traumatic events that&rsquo;d been after her lately. At least with Isaac she knew there was only peace.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Heartward,&rdquo; she said, pulling away but her hands were still resting on his hips. &ldquo;Wanna come with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a town nearby, only an hour drive from here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>Shocked by the answer, she grabbed him by the wrist when he turned back to unlock his car doors.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not gonna ask me why I&rsquo;m going there?&rdquo; She raised both eyebrows, mouth agape. He, on the other hand, looked as cool as ever.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got an hour in the car, right?&rdquo; Isaac said with a beam as he opened the door on the passenger side for Y/N.</p><p>Now she felt the need to hug him again for she didn&rsquo;t think she could ever repay his kindness. In order to save time, however, she&rsquo;d probably save that later. If they didn&rsquo;t get going right away, they wouldn&rsquo;t be back soon enough for her dad to not suspect a thing.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; She exclaimed with a bright smile, watching Isaac shake his head as he laughed before getting into the vehicle as well.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>For most of her life, Y/N had lived in Holmes Chapel and hadn&rsquo;t realized until now that she&rsquo;d never gone any further than her neighborhood. This was her first journey to a different town in Cheshire. As turned out, it was a lot different from her own. The streets here were narrower and the houses were smaller. While Holmes Chapel had always been simple, Heartward was a maze with the labyrinth of roads, as complex as the human heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you nervous?&rdquo; Isaac&rsquo;s voice pulled Y/N&rsquo;s attention away from the window, back on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo; She snorted, inhaling deeply to let the silence sink back in for a couple seconds before speaking up again. &ldquo;What type of person do you think he is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably kind. I mean, your mother was kind.&rdquo;</p><p>The answer made the girl chuckle as she lifted an eyebrow. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t even know my mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you,&rdquo; he said, his blue eyes sparked with joy.</p><p>In that instant, Y/N felt warm within and she was glad he&rsquo;d shown up at her door. She would still be freaking out right now if she&rsquo;d gone alone. It was rather funny how she&rsquo;d been his damsel in distress countless of times ever since they first met. Sometimes she did think about it and wondered how he still felt about her after everything. Was he nice to the others too or her only? If the latter was the case, then there was another reason for her to believe she didn&rsquo;t deserve someone like him.</p><p>The smile grew on Y/N&rsquo;s face as she watched Isaac&rsquo;s face screw up while he was concentrating on the road ahead. That same smile, sadly, died out the second he brought up the name she&rsquo;d tried to erase from memory.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you talked to Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N gave Isaac a shrug, turning back to the window on her side. &ldquo;I will&hellip;at some point.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t ask any further, thank god for that. The last thing she wanted was for him to figure out what had really happened between her and Harry. Though she no longer felt the pressure to reveal her sexual relationship with him to Isaac or anyone else for that matter, she was still afraid what Isaac might think of her if somehow he found out. Honestly, she felt <i>cheap</i>. Even though her feelings for Harry had always been true, to him she was just a replacement, nothing but a body to get him through the night while his heart stayed missing somebody else. But that was exactly what she&rsquo;d signed up for, so she shouldn&rsquo;t be bitter now that it didn&rsquo;t end the way she wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;Speaking of the devil,&rdquo; the girl muttered under her breath when a couple texts from <b>H</b> popped up on her screen.</p><p>&ldquo;Read it,&rdquo; Isaac said, his eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;He must worry about you a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>Little did he knew, Y/N did want to. She <i>really</i> wanted to.</p><p>Harry had called her a hundred times since this morning and she&rsquo;d fought herself from answering those calls. Maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt if she only read his texts and not reply to them. Nodding in response to Isaac&rsquo;s words, she eventually opened those messages.</p><p>\u2332<b> H: </b><i>If you get this, please text me back.</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>H:</b><i> Let me know you&rsquo;re safe.</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>H:</b> <i>Please call me back, text me, anything.</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>H:</b> <i>I need to talk to you please.</i></p><p>&ldquo;So? How&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N turned off her phone and put it away as she also turned a deaf ear to Isaac&rsquo;s question.</p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told him where I am, right?&rdquo; She asked in concern, only to sigh in relief when he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;If I had, he would be here instead of me.&rdquo; With a slight chuckle, he added, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re really good at ghosting on people, Smiley.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only the ones who deserve it.&rdquo;</p><p>When Y/N received no reply, she turned to see the a goofy grin on the man&rsquo;s face.</p><p>Pinching his lip slightly, Isaac kept his eyes on the road rather on her as he joked, &ldquo;if I hadn&rsquo;t texted you when I was in Italy, we would never have spoken again, right?&rdquo;</p><p>She knew he wasn&rsquo;t serious when he said that, but his expression alone could still pain her heart. A sense of guilt flooded into her hollow chest to replace the comfort she&rsquo;d been feeling this entire time in the car with him. Isaac was too nice to admit that she had hurt him too for coldly turning him down once before. She&rsquo;d been too busy paying attention to how she was feeling and forgotten about him. Why was he still here after everything? Why was he still treating her like the only person in the world who mattered? Why hadn&rsquo;t he asked for anything in return?</p><p>&ldquo;Isaac\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! We&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; The man happily announced as he slowed down and pulled his car over on the side of the road. She wasn&rsquo;t sure if he cut her off on purpose or he genuinely didn&rsquo;t hear her. But maybe this wasn&rsquo;t the time to talk about them.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure this is the place?&rdquo; She asked in disbelief when they both got out of the car at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;It is. I&rsquo;ve checked the address twice,&rdquo; he assured, yet looking just as appalled as she was.</p><p>The house they were looking for was square and grey, with narrow windows that looked far from picturesque. Y/N had to check the address for the third time to make sure it matched the one on the letter. This place looked like it&rsquo;d been abandoned for years. Maybe the owner didn&rsquo;t really care to pay enough attention to making his front yard and porch look even the slightest presentable.</p><p>Exchanging worrying looks with Isaac, she finally found enough courage to press the doorbell. She wasn&rsquo;t sure if anybody was home because through the windows all that she saw was a part of the pitch dark living room as far as natural light could reach.</p><p>Fortunately, just when the two of them thought they might have to leave empty handed, the door slowly creaked open.</p><p>Y/N had never met this man in her life, but his expression when he saw her made her think he had known her his entire life. His face was stern, yet peaceful. And even though his hair was turning grey and the wrinkles were slightly visible on his broad forehead, he still appeared quite handsome for a man his age.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; Y/N spoke after two awkward seconds passing by unnoticed. &ldquo;Are you&hellip;<i>Dave Hardfield</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo; The middle-aged man nodded, his eyes were still round as he stared at her in confusion. &ldquo;You are&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Y/N, Tam&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; she said, handing him the envelope she&rsquo;d been holding the entire time. &ldquo;I found your letter in my attic, and\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>That sentence was left unfinished when Dave opened his arms and dragged her into a hug without warning. Isaac flinched, nearly pulling Y/N back for he feared the man might do something to her, but the moment he spotted the hopeful look on Dave&rsquo;s face, he decided to stay back and remain silent.</p><p>&ldquo;You look just like her.&rdquo;</p><p>Those words from the stranger made Y/N&rsquo;s eyes well up when he loosened his embrace to cup her face. He examined her features, eyes glistened with tears as a smile spread across his chapped lips.</p><p>&ldquo;She has the same beautiful eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow&hellip;that&rsquo;s very&hellip;nice of you. Thank you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Isaac couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle at Y/N&rsquo;s reply, receiving a playful glare when she turned back to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in, you two! come in!&rdquo; Dave said fast, giving Y/N and Isaac no time to hesitate before urging them into his living room. When the door was shut, and the lights were on, Y/N saw the living proof of the saying &rsquo;<i>never judge a book by its cover</i>&rsquo;. The interior was the opposite of the mess she&rsquo;d seen when she first arrived \u2014 tidy and very well-taken care of.</p><p>Dave&rsquo;s living room gave away more than it was supposed to. Every decoration was soft and homely, showing the fact that he probably lived alone. In order to fill the void, he had created a cozy place that made him feel safe and warm so he would&rsquo;t have to come home to remember how lonely he was. Y/N would know that better than anyone.</p><p>Above the fireplace were pictures of him with his children, she assumed, for they were arranged from the left when his twins were babies to the latest one on the right being the three of them together at the girls&rsquo; graduation. There was no photo of the wife.</p><p>Dave sat down on his chair and pointed to the sofa in front of him, telling his two guests to make themselves at home. There was already a tea set on the table, so he made two cups for Y/N and Isaac, saying that he&rsquo;d already had his before they arrived.</p><p>&ldquo;So Y/N, is this your boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Y/N blushed hard when she caught Isaac&rsquo;s stare and turned away quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Isaac, I&rsquo;m her friend from London,&rdquo; said the young man as he reached out to shake Dave&rsquo;s hand, showing his signature Prince Charming smirk. How could anyone not go soft for that?</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, how do you like Holmes Chapel so far, son?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To be honest, I&rsquo;ve been in Heartward for longer than Holmes Chapel.&rdquo; He chuckled, glancing at Y/N who furrowed her eyebrows at him. &ldquo;This one literally dragged me here when I first arrived at her house.&rdquo;</p><p>She pushed his shoulder playfully, laughing along. &ldquo;In my defense, I did ask if he wanted to come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The things we do for these ladies, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Dave&rsquo;s comment made Isaac chuckle, but Y/N had already turned away to hide the fact that she was all flustered.</p><p>As the young people enjoyed their tea, the older man took his own letter out of the envelope, smiling nonchalantly at the memories while rereading what he&rsquo;d written two years ago.</p><p>Y/N gave him a moment to get lost in his happy thoughts before breaking the silence among the three of them. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s true&hellip;you and my mother&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The man&rsquo;s beam slowly turned into a frown as he sighed heavily, putting the letter back into its envelope.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he confessed, eyes locked with the girl who still seemed in denial even though she&rsquo;d known the truth ever since she first read his letter. Her mother, a cheater? The woman she&rsquo;d looked up to her entire life turned out to be that kind of person? It didn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p><p>&ldquo;We were in love,&rdquo; Dave went on despite the look on her face. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t something I was proud of, to fall head over heels for a married woman. But&hellip;I guess we never get to choose whom we fall in love with.&rdquo;</p><p>Isaac&rsquo;s eyes were on Y/N, yet hers were fixed on the man who was speaking. She didn&rsquo;t know how to feel anymore. Should she hate this man for ruining her parents&rsquo; marriage just like how she had hated Marcy for thinking it was her? The problem was, she couldn&rsquo;t grow to hate him, not even the tiniest bit.</p><p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; Dave asked, eyes squinting at Y/N.</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; He sucked in a breath and rubbed his palms together nervously. &ldquo;You were fifteen when I met her. Can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been five years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Were you married at the time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. My ex-wife left me when my girls were only six. They barely remember her.&rdquo;</p><p>The look on his face was heartbreaking still.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Y/N as she wetted her dry lips. &ldquo;Uhm&hellip;where are your children now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re both living in California with their husbands. I&rsquo;m very proud of them,&rdquo; he said with a huge grin. That was enough to tell how much his children meant to him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just four years older than you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re the same age as you!&rdquo; Y/N told Isaac, who responded with a slight laugh for how excited she seemed to discover the coincidence.</p><p>&ldquo;When the girls left home, I was devastated,&rdquo; Dave continued with a sad smile, looking at them both. &ldquo;Tam was the best thing to happen to me at the time. I believe I was also hers. She was unhappy in her marriage, yet she couldn&rsquo;t leave because&hellip;she didn&rsquo;t want to force you to choose between her and your father.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N stayed silent, nodding her head slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;The day of the accident, he found out about us and they got into a fight.&rdquo; His voice grew smaller and weaker as he recalled the tragic event that took away the woman he loved. &ldquo;When I received the news, my whole world fell apart. Even now&hellip;I still blame myself for what happened to her. If I&rsquo;d just given up and let her go, maybe she would still be here.&rdquo;</p><p>So that was how it&rsquo;d happened. Her mother&rsquo;s affair was the reason there&rsquo;d been a fight. That was why she&rsquo;d given her father back the ring and drove away from the damage she&rsquo;d caused. <i>That</i> was the truth \u2014 a hard pill to swallow.</p><p>&ldquo;But you made her happier than my father did&hellip;&rdquo; She spoke after a moment sinking deep in her own thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip;don&rsquo;t hate me?&rdquo; Dave seemed surprised by her reaction. It was certainly not what he&rsquo;d expected.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The girl shook her head. &ldquo;At least now I know she was truly loved. So&hellip;thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Dave didn&rsquo;t say anything else. Y/N didn&rsquo;t ask either. They exchanged heartwarming smiles, and Isaac reached out to hold the hand on her lap, giving her a look that said he was there for her if she wanted emotional support. Maybe that was she needed to feel at peace again.</p><p>The drive home was strangely comforting for all the secrets had been revealed, and what was left was just bare relief. Staring out of the car window, Y/N recorded the last images of Heartward into her mind like a goodbye to the little town. Then she began to wonder how many times her mother had driven down that same road, or if she had remembered the map of Heartward like the back of her hand. Maybe Heartward was her mother&rsquo;s London, the place that wasn&rsquo;t really home, but there lived the man whom her heart would always belong to.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo; The girl chuckled slightly as she watched Isaac stand with his back against the car, one hand still holding hers. Now that she was home safe and he knew that she was safe. She wondered what would happen next. Would they say their goodbyes and he go back to London, maybe back to Italy even?</p><p>The problem was, now she didn&rsquo;t want him to go.</p><p>&ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re okay?&rdquo; He raised both eyebrows, making her toss her head back and crack up.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, how many times do I have to tell you that I am?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, alright, just wanted to be sure,&rdquo; he said, grinning from ear to ear and checking his watch.</p><p>Y/N studied his expression closely, wishing she could ask him to stay, a part of her was still reluctant that she might&rsquo;ve troubled him too much already. Nevertheless, it wasn&rsquo;t her to decide what happened next.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo;</i></p><p>The loud voice caused both Isaac and Y/N to let go of each other&rsquo;s hands as they turned to her front door. Her father rushed towards them, followed by Marcy. Both seemed so distressed that Y/N thought it was quite hilarious.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;ve only been gone for a couple hours.&rdquo;</p><p>Isaac chuckled as he watched the girl trying to break away from her father&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>&ldquo;The car was here and you were gone, so I thought\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I got kidnapped by the ice-cream man?&rdquo; She laughed, holding him by the arms. It was then that Marcy finally noticed the handsome young man standing right behind her future stepdaughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She squealed happily. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your friend, Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Isaac, Y/N&rsquo;s friend from London. You must be the bride.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; The woman shook his hand enthusiastically, giving him a massive smile. &ldquo;Hey, why don&rsquo;t you stay for our wedding? A friend of Y/N&rsquo;s is a friend of ours!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma'am. But I&rsquo;m only here for today. I&rsquo;m leaving now actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like to stay though?&rdquo;</p><p>All eyes were on Y/N when she asked that question. She couldn&rsquo;t really blame them for even she didn&rsquo;t believe in her own words. Her cheeks instantly turned red as she was sure Isaac noticed how shy she was. His smile grew a bit wider.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay for the wedding?&rdquo; He questioned, probably just wanting her to say it again.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; She nodded fast, eyes to the side instead of looking at him. &ldquo;Uhm&hellip;I do need a wedding date.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, but I thought Har\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea!&rdquo; Bradford cut his bride off just in time as he stepped forward to pat the young man on the back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe to drive back to London through the night. Come in, we&rsquo;ll have the guest room ready for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not formally dressed for the wedding\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that. It&rsquo;s just gonna be a family party,&rdquo; Bradford said, rolling his eyes. &ldquo;Besides, you cannot miss an opportunity to see Y/N in a pink dress for the first time since she decided that adolescent angst suited her personality better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; Y/N cried out, causing the other three to dissolve into laughter. Hiding her face with one hand, she sneaked a look at Isaac, who couldn&rsquo;t stop beaming at this point. There was something about the radiant joy on his face that made her feel calm. Holding back a laugh, she watched Marcy pull him into their house.</p><p>Marcy was still baking for the wedding tomorrow, and since she had to do it all on her own, she was thrilled to bits when Isaac offered his help.</p><p>&ldquo;I used to help my mum in the kitchen all the time,&rdquo; said the young man. That was enough to convince her that he was qualified to be the Executive Sous Chef in her kitchen. Bradford intended to join them as well, but Y/N stopped him right before he could volunteer to lend a hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, can we talk in private?&rdquo; She asked, holding onto his arm.</p><p>In this household, they rarely discussed their conflicts and problems, just like old furniture, they put those in a dark corner and pretended they didn&rsquo;t exist until someone suddenly remembered they were still there. But look at what all these secrets they&rsquo;d kept from each other had turned them into? A broken family. They had never been truly happy under the same roof. From now on, something had to change.</p><p>Bradford followed his daughter upstairs to her room where their conversation couldn&rsquo;t be heard. When she asked him to sit down in her chair and shut the door, he knew it was something serious. So serious that someone who had avoided every single heart-to-heart talk in her life like Y/N must initiate this conversation.</p><p>Without further ado, she sat down on the edge of her bed and handed him the letter from Dave Hardfield. Judging by the look on his face, she knew he had never expected her to find out like this, if at all.</p><p>&ldquo;I came to see him today,&rdquo; she spoke at last, tearing down the silence which was only tormenting them both. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I found out about this the day before your graduation, darling. And the accident came right after. This news would&rsquo;ve broken you even more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about after the funeral? What about when I moved to London? You&rsquo;d had so many chances to tell me,&rdquo; she stated. The tears in her eyes were inevitable yet it still hurt him to see her cry. He didn&rsquo;t need to know she&rsquo;d been holding them back since the moment she found those letters in the attic. He didn&rsquo;t need to know what the other man had said to her. All he knew was his little girl had been through so much only to find out the truth about her mother from a stranger.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want you to hate her for this.&rdquo;</p><p>His answer left a lump in her throat as she swallowed her tears and narrowed her eyes at him.</p><p>&ldquo;So you just let me hate you instead?&rdquo;</p><p>When he nodded, her heart nearly cracked open.</p><p>&ldquo;She was a better parent than I am,&rdquo; he said with his head hung low. &ldquo;You used to tell her everything. I can&rsquo;t-I don&rsquo;t remember the last time we sat down and talked like this. Everything I know about you, your mother told me. The bond you two had was so strong, and you looked up to her so much, I couldn&rsquo;t take that idea of her away from you. I wanted you to always think about her as a role model so you would always have a reason to never give up.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N was speechless. She pressed her lips tight and could only nod fast to replace the words she couldn&rsquo;t come up with right now. Bradford scooted his chair closer so he could take her hand and hold it tight, meanwhile wiping away the tears rolling down her flushed cheeks, what he should&rsquo;ve done years ago.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you&hellip;did you ever love her?&rdquo; Her voice trembled as if it was going to break anytime soon.</p><p>&ldquo;I did. I still do,&rdquo; he admitted, his eyes now glistened with tears. &ldquo;My biggest regret was not appreciating her presence in my life. I didn&rsquo;t treat her right because I thought she would always be around, until she wasn&rsquo;t anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;did you hate her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The father shook his head. &ldquo;And I hope you won&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;</p><p>She looked at him through the tears, subconsciously reaching up to touch the locket lying close to her heart which was now racing faster than ever. Letting out a shaky breath, she said, &ldquo;what she did cannot change the fact that she loved me, and she was the nicest person I knew. How can I ever stop loving her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p><p>That one-word reply was so simple yet just enough. It was heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time how they both cried and wiped away each other&rsquo;s tears only to smile again. This was the closest Y/N had ever been to feeling fulfill.</p><p>When she was little, every time her parents fought, she used to wished for a better family with perfect parents who never argued. But maybe this was the best she could get. At least now she knew her imperfect family could finally be a happy one.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Brad!&rdquo;</i> Marcy&rsquo;s voice from downstairs made Bradford and Y/N turn to the door. <i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think you can get away with not helping me!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go.&rdquo; Y/N chuckled as she rose from the bed. But before she could reach the door, Bradford stopped her by the words he hadn&rsquo;t said in too long.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N couldn&rsquo;t keep track on how many nights she&rsquo;d lost sleep over those three words. She had faced the fear that she might not get to hear them back. She had faced the <i>reality</i> that she <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> get to hear them back. To hear them now from the man she thought she should hate most in her life had filled the empty space inside her chest, even if temporarily.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, too,&rdquo; she said almost as a whisper but loud enough for her father to hear. Without waiting for a reaction from him, she rushed into his arms, hugging him for the first time since she was just a little girl.</p><p>Now that she was older, she must accept the fact that her parents weren&rsquo;t heroes and she might not really know the people she&rsquo;d always thought she knew. However, true love was constant. The love for her mother, for Harry, would always be there, no matter what kind of people they turned out to be or what secrets they&rsquo;d kept from her. Just like herself, she knew they had their own pain so she couldn&rsquo;t blame them for their mistakes.</p><p>She might not replicate what she had lost. She wasn&rsquo;t sure anyone could ever fill the shoes of her mother or <i>him</i>. But some love could only be beautiful if kept in memory. Thus from now on, she was willing to let them both go.</p><p><i>.</i></p><p><i>.</i></p><p><i>.</i></p><p>&ldquo;So, this photo was taken on her first day of kindergarten.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Brad! Look at her cute pigtails! I can&rsquo;t believe you never showed me this before!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N sat on the armchair facing the other three on the sofa opposite from her. They had their noses stuck the family photo album. It was like a game to see who could spot the most embarrassing photo of her as a child. Apparently, her dad was winning.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you guys all done?&rdquo; She asked, arms crossed in front of her chest as her face contorted, but nobody flinched.</p><p>&ldquo;Aww, the Donald Duck Halloween costume.&rdquo; Isaac chuckled. He tried to ignore her, yet couldn&rsquo;t help but glance up to catch a glimpse of the look on her face as she scoffed in response to his comment.</p><p>When Y/N picked out a daisy in front of her and tossed it at him, Marcy wasted no time to grab the vase, holding it firmly against her chest.</p><p>&ldquo;The whatever you want, just don&rsquo;t hurt my flowers!&rdquo; She said.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, the fun&rsquo;s over!&rdquo; Y/N rose from her seat to grab the photo album and put it aside. With both hands on her hips, she lifted an eyebrow at the men. &ldquo;Chop chop. Get back to work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; Isaac and Bradford said at the same time as they hurried back to the tasks they&rsquo;d been assigned before getting distracted by those photos.</p><p>Bradford stood up so Y/N could take his place next to Isaac and continue arranging those wedding flowers for Marcy. Meanwhile, the father kept on looking for that cook book he hadn&rsquo;t seen in years, only because Marcy&rsquo;s parents expected him to cook for them tomorrow night. He was just about to head upstairs and search in his room, when his phone began to ring.</p><p>It was Harry.</p><p>The man had hesitated for a long moment before picking up that call. He didn&rsquo;t want to see Y/N&rsquo;s reaction if she caught him speaking to Harry. Even so, he still wanted to know what had happened between them, knowing she would refuse to confide in him, or anyone for that matter.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; He finally answered, keeping his voice down so his family couldn&rsquo;t hear.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Is Bambi, I mean, Y/N&hellip;Is </i><i>Y/N</i><i> there, sir? If she is, can you get her on the phone?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Bradford had known Harry since he was little, and he knew Harry was a good person by nature. However, after seeing the pain his daughter had endured, he now must pick a side.</p><p>Sitting in his living room was the man who made his daughter laugh, on the phone was the one who made her cry. The choice should be fast and simple, yet there was utter guilt within his heart when he decided to keep Harry from the truth.</p><p>&ldquo;She went out a while ago,&rdquo; he lied, his heart fell to silence as a long pause followed right after.</p><p><i>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t wanna talk to me, right?&rdquo; </i>The sadness was clear in Harry&rsquo;s voice when he finally spoke.</p><p>Even though Bradford had no idea Isaac was Harry&rsquo;s best friend, he was aware that Harry&rsquo;s heart would be crushed if he found out Y/N was laughing with another man on the sofa, and the same man would accompany her to the wedding tomorrow. The father had no other choice but to be frank, &ldquo;I think you should wait until after the wedding, when she returns to London. You know, give her time.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was quiet for a while, as if to ponder on his own.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sir&hellip;do you think she still hates me?&rdquo;</i></p><p>For this question, the older man took a deep breath. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Y/N that well, but she can never hate you.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I know I would if I were her.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N always says things she doesn&rsquo;t mean. I thought you would know that better than anyone else.&rdquo; Bradford chuckled slightly. &ldquo;She said she hated you when you left the first time, yet she still sent you those letters.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Letters?&rdquo;</i> Harry sounded like he almost choked on the word. <i>&ldquo;What letters?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;You never received any? That&rsquo;s odd&hellip;She used to check our mailbox everyday, and her mother once told me that she&rsquo;d been writing to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Bradford waited, yet the reply what came after was nothing but silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo; He mumbled, assuming something was wrong with the phone and the young man couldn&rsquo;t hear him well, until Harry cleared his throat and said that he was still listening, he must hang up now regardless.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Can you please ask her to call me back?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry&rsquo;s plea for help sounded so desperate. Now Bradford could only feel sorry for the boy. He looked over his shoulder, into the living room. Y/N and Isaac had long forgotten that they were supposed to be arranging the wedding flowers. They were too busy fooling around by putting daisies in each other&rsquo;s hair while guffawing like children. Seeing the beam on his daughter&rsquo;s face, Bradford was able to empathize with Harry. It definitely wasn&rsquo;t easy to remember how much you loved someone only when came someone else who wiped away their tears and made them smile again.</p><p>&ldquo;Take my advice,&rdquo; the father spoke with a soft reminiscent sigh, turning his back to Y/N and Isaac. &ldquo;Some things are not meant to be said on the phone.&rdquo;</p><p>The two-second pause on Harry&rsquo;s part made Bradford believe his guess was right all along. What Harry wanted to say were the three words that had started this whole mess, and Y/N deserved to hear them in person.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; </i>the young man spoke at last. <i>&ldquo;Thank you so much.&rdquo;</i> And just like that, he muttered his goodbye.</p><p>The call ended with a sense of sorrowful regret, leaving Bradford standing still with messy thoughts flowing through his mind. It was Y/N&rsquo;s voice that pulled him back to reality.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, who was it?&rdquo;</p><p>Turning his head fast, the man locked eyes with his daughter&rsquo;s. For a second, it was Tam that he saw staring back at him, and in that instant he realized how much Y/N resembled her late mother.</p><p>&ldquo;Was it him?&rdquo; Her eyebrows furrowed when he nodded his head as an answer. What was the use of lying when she already knew the truth?</p><p>&ldquo;You should call him back,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;He wanted to talk to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t wanna talk to him.&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s answer turned the man speechless. He parted his lips, yet she was quick to cut him off before he even figured out what else to say. &ldquo;If he calls again, tell him he doesn&rsquo;t have to feel sorry&hellip;It was also my fault for expecting too much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Darling, it&rsquo;s not your f\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell him I won&rsquo;t call him back.&rdquo; Y/N interrupted her father once again. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s really no point in torturing each other anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>From the look in her expressive eyes, the man understood that his daughter was badly hurt by those words of her own, yet she must say them otherwise she could never truly move on.</p><p>In silence, he watched her go back to the living room where Marcy was now instructing Isaac how to arrange those daisies. Even though he respected Y/N&rsquo;s decision, Bradford knew, just like him, a small part of her still wished it was Harry instead.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was quite a wrench to Harry when that call came to an end and he hadn&rsquo;t got to hear her voice. The director got real mad at him for being distracted during filming and checking his phone way too often. Harry made up an excuse that he was just tired, yet none of the people he worked with was convinced. It&rsquo;d been the worst day in his life ever since she left.</p><p>On the drive home, he couldn&rsquo;t stop replaying the conversation with one of his co-stars, who said,<i> &ldquo;I feel like this isn&rsquo;t what you love anymore.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He&rsquo;d thought about that sentence a lot before coming to the conclusion that the man who&rsquo;d said it was completely wrong. This had nothing to do with him being lazy or losing motivation since acting was what he was born to do. He loved his job, and was indeed grateful for all that he had now. But there were also the other things that he loved, one of which was her.</p><p>Now she was 185 miles away from him. And he couldn&rsquo;t even get her on the phone just to explain why he&rsquo;d hesitated to admit that he loved her, to apologize and <i>beg</i> for another chance. He knew he couldn&rsquo;t make it back to the wedding because he&rsquo;d got a commercial to shoot tomorrow morning, and he couldn&rsquo;t wait until after because it&rsquo;d be too long. But maybe her father was right, words would sound much more sincere if they were said in person.</p><p>There was, however, something else that was bothering him. Bradford had mentioned those letters she&rsquo;d written to him when she was younger. At first he&rsquo;d assumed they all had got lost in the mail, yet it seemed too much of a coincidence to be true, unless the universe really didn&rsquo;t want him to read them.</p><p>What if she&rsquo;d never sent those letters? If so, where were they now?</p><p>Harry was too lost in the questions for himself that he almost didn&rsquo;t recognize his assistant who was waiting for him outside his house. The girl had to call out his name to get his attention as he walked right past her.</p><p>&ldquo;Jo? What are you doing here so late?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jeff said you had a rough day on set so he asked me to buy you dinner,&rdquo; said the short brunette as she fixed her glasses and handed the food to her boss. &ldquo;And Miss Ruby Ellis called me a couple times today asking to talk to you, but I told her you were busy. Do you want me to set up a date\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; he cut her off fast, pressing his lips into a small smile. &ldquo;Next time just ignore her calls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;Okay&hellip;One more thing!&rdquo; The girl stopped her boss when he unlocked his door. &ldquo;I brought your laundry into your room and accidentally knocked over the books on your nightstand. I already put them back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jo, you don&rsquo;t have to report everything to me,&rdquo; Harry replied as he chuckled, assuming the girl was new to her job so she was just overly careful.</p><p>Jo shook her head quickly. &ldquo;I was afraid that you would see the books in a different place and think I got intrusive and read your journal or something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My journal?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, the pink notebook with your name at the back.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes went wide as realization hit him like a fast-moving train. He thanked his assistant, saying a fast goodbye before rushing into his house. The first thing he did was run to his bedroom and get Y/N&rsquo;s notebook.</p><p>She&rsquo;d had it since she was nine. He always knew she wrote a lot in there, including her random thoughts, her favorite quotes, her story ideas, almost everything she could come up with; some she&rsquo;d read to him, some she&rsquo;d kept to herself. But he never actually got to read for himself.</p><p>If she was writing letters that she never planned on sending, would there be a better place to keep them?</p><p>Harry felt awful as he brought the pink notebook to his lap and sat down on the bed, inhaling deeply. He wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone to read his most deepest and personal thoughts, surely she wouldn&rsquo;t be happy to find out that he wanted to read hers. He was going to anyway. Desperation had got the best of him.</p><p>With trembling hand, he flipped to the back of the notebook, and immediately spotted his name written in small capital letters at the bottom corner of the hard cover. Harry didn&rsquo;t know why he was smiling as he gently ran his thumb over the word. He missed her too much that such a small detail could make his heart flutter.</p><p>After contemplating it for a whole minute, he took another deep breath and opened it for the first time.</p><p><i>Here goes nothing</i>, said his inner voice.</p><p>The first page, which he&rsquo;d seen once before, was filled with silly doodles made by a nine-year-old, hence they weren&rsquo;t pretty. He still remembered the day she showed him these and got mad when he made fun of her for her awful drawing skill. The memory made Harry chuckle as he turned to the second page where lied the very first entry. The ink was slightly faded due to all the years it&rsquo;d lived by. Her handwriting used to be so easy to read.</p><p>On the first line right below the date, she wrote:</p><p><i>My definition of true happiness is the boy next door. His name is Harry Styles.</i></p>",

Now that the decoration was all finished, Y/N wasn\u2019t much useful around the house since she couldn\u2019t cook. Therefore she told herself it was only fair if she did the small favor for Marcy.</p><p>To be honest, Y/N couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d gone to the attic. That place used to be her nightmare when she was a little girl. The thought of evil creatures lurking in the dark among dusty old furniture and shelves was the reason she\u2019d slept with the light on for an entire month after climbing up there once out of curiosity. Now that she was an adult, it was barely more than a crawl space with low ceiling and mould. She had to hang her head to walk in, trying to locate obstacles in the dark for the only source of light was from the long narrow windows near the ceiling.</p><p>The unsoftened echo of her footsteps on the floor made of timber brought on a claustrophobic feeling, and so she put the books and magazines in the corner to hurry back to the ladder as fast as she could.</p><p>Right before she reached the entrance, Y/N tripped over a small table and almost lost her balance. But she didn\u2019t fall, instead she knocked over a dusty carton box which fell onto the floor and created a loud thump that echoed within the confined space. Dust flying all over the place got the girl coughing uncontrollably, still she decided to bend down and clean up the mess she\u2019d made.</p><p>The first thing that got her attention was a portrait of her younger self, sketched by her mother. Everything in that box belonged to her mother. Most of them were drawings and souvenirs she\u2019d bought on their family trips. Y/N had no idea how long they\u2019d been in this attic, but judging from the yellow hue of the paper, she would guess that they had been there since her mother was still alive.</p><p>As a result, Y/N ended up staying in the attic for longer than she\u2019d intended to. She sat on the floor, going through the rest of the stuff in the box, feeling whole inside for the fact that most of her mother\u2019s sketches were of her face, some others were corners of their house and random objects like a tea set, a bowl of fruits, a flower vase,\u2026</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anything unusual, until\u2026<i>there was</i>.</p><p>At the bottom of the box lied a little tin box. The girl almost didn\u2019t see it for it was hidden too well. For some reason, just looking at it gave her a feeling that there was something inside she had to see.</p><p>With her heart thumping like a drum, she brought it to her lap and carefully opened it. It would\u2019ve been a huge disappointment if the box had been empty like she\u2019d feared, but her instinct rarely made a mistake. The box contained many letters written to her mother from a man named <i>Dave Hardfield, </i>alongside which was a photo of them together. His lips were on Tam\u2019s cheek and Y/N had never seen her mother smile that bright before. At first Y/N assumed the man used to be one of her mother\u2019s boyfriends before meeting her dad. However, when she looked at the date on each letter, she discovered the truth that\u2019d been hidden for all those years. Those letters, <i>love letters</i> to be exact, had all been written and sent when her parents were married already.</p><p>Y/N found out, to her dismay, there were worse fears than invisible monsters in the attic, it was the ones living within every person including the ones you thought you knew all too well.</p><p>She picked up one of the letters to read through the first few lines just to make sure she didn\u2019t draw any conclusion way too soon. But what she learnt wasn\u2019t what her heart wished it\u2019d be. Her mother had been in love, <i>madly</i> in love, but with another man, <i>not</i> her father.</p><p>She felt a lump in her throat when she read the part about them planning on leaving this town once the divorce had been settled. That letter came just a week before the accident.</p><p>The grip of her hands tightened, nearly tearing the page in two. She was so in shock that her brain stuttered for a moment and breathing became difficult. It took her a while to come back to her sense and gather everything besides the letter to put it back in the tin box before leaving.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even think as she hurried down the ladder, marching straight to the front door while clutching the letter in her hand. This man, whoever he was, might have the answers to most of the questions she\u2019d been asking herself since her mother\u2019s death, beginning with what had happened the night of the accident. Y/N walked fast, wasting no time, yet her father appeared without warning to stop her right before she could reach for the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He asked, raising an eyebrow at his daughter, who was quick to hide the letter behind her back.</p><p>\u201cTo a coffee shop,\u201d she said, trying too hard not to let her anxiety show. And maybe she was putting on such a good act that her dad didn\u2019t seem to suspect a thing.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would stay to help us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will when I get back. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, young lady.\u201d Bradford cleared his throat loudly as he clutched her by the arm when she barely managed to escape. \u201cYou\u2019re acting strange. Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p><p>That reply was followed by the fakest laugh she\u2019d ever pulled. Even she knew that, how could her father not?</p><p>\u201cIs it\u2014\u201d The man paused to decide if he should make a guess. It wasn\u2019t really a guess since he already knew the truth. It was because of Harry. She\u2019d been crying for that boy and hurting for that boy, like she had most of her life. It was obvious. But then again, Bradford pretended like he had no clue. His daughter had never been a sentimental person, not openly at least. Maybe it was one thing they both had in common.</p><p>\u201cNever mind\u2026\u201d He sighed, twitching his lips. \u201cBe back soon, alright?\u201d</p><p>Smiling in return, Y/N gave her father a firm nod. \u201cHey dad, can I borrow your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But don\u2019t crash it.\u201d</p><p>It was meant to be a harmless joke. But as both of them came to realization, they just quietly stared at each other for two seconds long. Bradford handed her his car key, stuttering as he wanted to say something to lighten up the mood. Unfortunately, Y/N didn\u2019t hesitate to walk out of the door.</p><p>The truth was, she had no plan at all. She just knew she was going to see the man named Dave Hardfield, whose address was on the letters sent to her mum. She didn\u2019t even have the script of the things she should say, or the list of questions about everything she was dying to know. She just wanted to go see the man to learn the truth, whatever it was, even when she wasn\u2019t ready to hear it from a complete stranger.</p><p>Funny how one surprise came right after another without a single break. The last person Y/N would expect to show up in Holmes Chapel right now, was waiting right outside her house by his car.</p><p>\u201cIsaac?\u201d She gasped, walking fast towards the man whose smile was as bright as the sun when he saw her face. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried about you. Wanted to make sure you were alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2026drove all the way here from London\u2026to see me?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, letting it all out. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna tell me I\u2019m stupid for doing this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>To his surprise, she shook her head fast and pulled him into a hug so tight that it almost took his breath away, <i>literally</i>. Y/N didn\u2019t seem to care as she kept repeating the words \u201cthank you\u201d into his shoulder, leaving him no choice but to also wrap his arms around her.</p><p>It finally occurred to her how desperate she was for a hug. It didn\u2019t matter whose. She just needed to feel a little bit of comfort after the series of traumatic events that\u2019d been after her lately. At least with Isaac she knew there was only peace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Heartward,\u201d she said, pulling away but her hands were still resting on his hips. \u201cWanna come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a town nearby, only an hour drive from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Shocked by the answer, she grabbed him by the wrist when he turned back to unlock his car doors.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna ask me why I\u2019m going there?\u201d She raised both eyebrows, mouth agape. He, on the other hand, looked as cool as ever.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an hour in the car, right?\u201d Isaac said with a beam as he opened the door on the passenger side for Y/N.</p><p>Now she felt the need to hug him again for she didn\u2019t think she could ever repay his kindness. In order to save time, however, she\u2019d probably save that later. If they didn\u2019t get going right away, they wouldn\u2019t be back soon enough for her dad to not suspect a thing.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d She exclaimed with a bright smile, watching Isaac shake his head as he laughed before getting into the vehicle as well.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>For most of her life, Y/N had lived in Holmes Chapel and hadn\u2019t realized until now that she\u2019d never gone any further than her neighborhood. This was her first journey to a different town in Cheshire. As turned out, it was a lot different from her own. The streets here were narrower and the houses were smaller. While Holmes Chapel had always been simple, Heartward was a maze with the labyrinth of roads, as complex as the human heart.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d Isaac\u2019s voice pulled Y/N\u2019s attention away from the window, back on him.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d She snorted, inhaling deeply to let the silence sink back in for a couple seconds before speaking up again. \u201cWhat type of person do you think he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably kind. I mean, your mother was kind.\u201d</p><p>The answer made the girl chuckle as she lifted an eyebrow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you,\u201d he said, his blue eyes sparked with joy.</p><p>In that instant, Y/N felt warm within and she was glad he\u2019d shown up at her door. She would still be freaking out right now if she\u2019d gone alone. It was rather funny how she\u2019d been his damsel in distress countless of times ever since they first met. Sometimes she did think about it and wondered how he still felt about her after everything. Was he nice to the others too or her only? If the latter was the case, then there was another reason for her to believe she didn\u2019t deserve someone like him.</p><p>The smile grew on Y/N\u2019s face as she watched Isaac\u2019s face screw up while he was concentrating on the road ahead. That same smile, sadly, died out the second he brought up the name she\u2019d tried to erase from memory.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Harry?\u201d</p><p>Y/N gave Isaac a shrug, turning back to the window on her side. \u201cI will\u2026at some point.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask any further, thank god for that. The last thing she wanted was for him to figure out what had really happened between her and Harry. Though she no longer felt the pressure to reveal her sexual relationship with him to Isaac or anyone else for that matter, she was still afraid what Isaac might think of her if somehow he found out. Honestly, she felt <i>cheap</i>. Even though her feelings for Harry had always been true, to him she was just a replacement, nothing but a body to get him through the night while his heart stayed missing somebody else. But that was exactly what she\u2019d signed up for, so she shouldn\u2019t be bitter now that it didn\u2019t end the way she wanted.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of the devil,\u201d the girl muttered under her breath when a couple texts from <b>H</b> popped up on her screen.</p><p>\u201cRead it,\u201d Isaac said, his eyebrows furrowed. \u201cHe must worry about you a lot.\u201d</p><p>Little did he knew, Y/N did want to. She <i>really</i> wanted to.</p><p>Harry had called her a hundred times since this morning and she\u2019d fought herself from answering those calls. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t hurt if she only read his texts and not reply to them. Nodding in response to Isaac\u2019s words, she eventually opened those messages.</p><p>\u2332<b> H: </b><i>If you get this, please text me back.</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>H:</b><i> Let me know you\u2019re safe.</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>H:</b> <i>Please call me back, text me, anything.</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>H:</b> <i>I need to talk to you please.</i></p><p>\u201cSo? How\u2019s he?\u201d</p><p>Y/N turned off her phone and put it away as she also turned a deaf ear to Isaac\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told him where I am, right?\u201d She asked in concern, only to sigh in relief when he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIf I had, he would be here instead of me.\u201d With a slight chuckle, he added, \u201cyou\u2019re really good at ghosting on people, Smiley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the ones who deserve it.\u201d</p><p>When Y/N received no reply, she turned to see the a goofy grin on the man\u2019s face.</p><p>Pinching his lip slightly, Isaac kept his eyes on the road rather on her as he joked, \u201cif I hadn\u2019t texted you when I was in Italy, we would never have spoken again, right?\u201d</p><p>She knew he wasn\u2019t serious when he said that, but his expression alone could still pain her heart. A sense of guilt flooded into her hollow chest to replace the comfort she\u2019d been feeling this entire time in the car with him. Isaac was too nice to admit that she had hurt him too for coldly turning him down once before. She\u2019d been too busy paying attention to how she was feeling and forgotten about him. Why was he still here after everything? Why was he still treating her like the only person in the world who mattered? Why hadn\u2019t he asked for anything in return?</p><p>\u201cIsaac\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! We\u2019re here!\u201d The man happily announced as he slowed down and pulled his car over on the side of the road. She wasn\u2019t sure if he cut her off on purpose or he genuinely didn\u2019t hear her. But maybe this wasn\u2019t the time to talk about them.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is the place?\u201d She asked in disbelief when they both got out of the car at the same time.</p><p>\u201cIt is. I\u2019ve checked the address twice,\u201d he assured, yet looking just as appalled as she was.</p><p>The house they were looking for was square and grey, with narrow windows that looked far from picturesque. Y/N had to check the address for the third time to make sure it matched the one on the letter. This place looked like it\u2019d been abandoned for years. Maybe the owner didn\u2019t really care to pay enough attention to making his front yard and porch look even the slightest presentable.</p><p>Exchanging worrying looks with Isaac, she finally found enough courage to press the doorbell. She wasn\u2019t sure if anybody was home because through the windows all that she saw was a part of the pitch dark living room as far as natural light could reach.</p><p>Fortunately, just when the two of them thought they might have to leave empty handed, the door slowly creaked open.</p><p>Y/N had never met this man in her life, but his expression when he saw her made her think he had known her his entire life. His face was stern, yet peaceful. And even though his hair was turning grey and the wrinkles were slightly visible on his broad forehead, he still appeared quite handsome for a man his age.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, sir,\u201d Y/N spoke after two awkward seconds passing by unnoticed. \u201cAre you\u2026<i>Dave Hardfield</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d The middle-aged man nodded, his eyes were still round as he stared at her in confusion. \u201cYou are\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N, Tam\u2019s daughter,\u201d she said, handing him the envelope she\u2019d been holding the entire time. \u201cI found your letter in my attic, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>That sentence was left unfinished when Dave opened his arms and dragged her into a hug without warning. Isaac flinched, nearly pulling Y/N back for he feared the man might do something to her, but the moment he spotted the hopeful look on Dave\u2019s face, he decided to stay back and remain silent.</p><p>\u201cYou look just like her.\u201d</p><p>Those words from the stranger made Y/N\u2019s eyes well up when he loosened his embrace to cup her face. He examined her features, eyes glistened with tears as a smile spread across his chapped lips.</p><p>\u201cShe has the same beautiful eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow\u2026that\u2019s very\u2026nice of you. Thank you\u2026\u201d</p><p>Isaac couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at Y/N\u2019s reply, receiving a playful glare when she turned back to him.</p><p>\u201cCome in, you two! come in!\u201d Dave said fast, giving Y/N and Isaac no time to hesitate before urging them into his living room. When the door was shut, and the lights were on, Y/N saw the living proof of the saying \u2019<i>never judge a book by its cover</i>\u2019. The interior was the opposite of the mess she\u2019d seen when she first arrived \u2014 tidy and very well-taken care of.</p><p>Dave\u2019s living room gave away more than it was supposed to. Every decoration was soft and homely, showing the fact that he probably lived alone. In order to fill the void, he had created a cozy place that made him feel safe and warm so he would\u2019t have to come home to remember how lonely he was. Y/N would know that better than anyone.</p><p>Above the fireplace were pictures of him with his children, she assumed, for they were arranged from the left when his twins were babies to the latest one on the right being the three of them together at the girls\u2019 graduation. There was no photo of the wife.</p><p>Dave sat down on his chair and pointed to the sofa in front of him, telling his two guests to make themselves at home. There was already a tea set on the table, so he made two cups for Y/N and Isaac, saying that he\u2019d already had his before they arrived.</p><p>\u201cSo Y/N, is this your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Y/N blushed hard when she caught Isaac\u2019s stare and turned away quickly.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Isaac, I\u2019m her friend from London,\u201d said the young man as he reached out to shake Dave\u2019s hand, showing his signature Prince Charming smirk. How could anyone not go soft for that?</p><p>\u201cOh, how do you like Holmes Chapel so far, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve been in Heartward for longer than Holmes Chapel.\u201d He chuckled, glancing at Y/N who furrowed her eyebrows at him. \u201cThis one literally dragged me here when I first arrived at her house.\u201d</p><p>She pushed his shoulder playfully, laughing along. \u201cIn my defense, I did ask if he wanted to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe things we do for these ladies, right?\u201d</p><p>Dave\u2019s comment made Isaac chuckle, but Y/N had already turned away to hide the fact that she was all flustered.</p><p>As the young people enjoyed their tea, the older man took his own letter out of the envelope, smiling nonchalantly at the memories while rereading what he\u2019d written two years ago.</p><p>Y/N gave him a moment to get lost in his happy thoughts before breaking the silence among the three of them. \u201cSo it\u2019s true\u2026you and my mother\u2026\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s beam slowly turned into a frown as he sighed heavily, putting the letter back into its envelope.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he confessed, eyes locked with the girl who still seemed in denial even though she\u2019d known the truth ever since she first read his letter. Her mother, a cheater? The woman she\u2019d looked up to her entire life turned out to be that kind of person? It didn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>\u201cWe were in love,\u201d Dave went on despite the look on her face. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I was proud of, to fall head over heels for a married woman. But\u2026I guess we never get to choose whom we fall in love with.\u201d</p><p>Isaac\u2019s eyes were on Y/N, yet hers were fixed on the man who was speaking. She didn\u2019t know how to feel anymore. Should she hate this man for ruining her parents\u2019 marriage just like how she had hated Marcy for thinking it was her? The problem was, she couldn\u2019t grow to hate him, not even the tiniest bit.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Dave asked, eyes squinting at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cTwenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He sucked in a breath and rubbed his palms together nervously. \u201cYou were fifteen when I met her. Can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you married at the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My ex-wife left me when my girls were only six. They barely remember her.\u201d</p><p>The look on his face was heartbreaking still.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Y/N as she wetted her dry lips. \u201cUhm\u2026where are your children now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both living in California with their husbands. I\u2019m very proud of them,\u201d he said with a huge grin. That was enough to tell how much his children meant to him. \u201cThey\u2019re just four years older than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re the same age as you!\u201d Y/N told Isaac, who responded with a slight laugh for how excited she seemed to discover the coincidence.</p><p>\u201cWhen the girls left home, I was devastated,\u201d Dave continued with a sad smile, looking at them both. \u201cTam was the best thing to happen to me at the time. I believe I was also hers. She was unhappy in her marriage, yet she couldn\u2019t leave because\u2026she didn\u2019t want to force you to choose between her and your father.\u201d</p><p>Y/N stayed silent, nodding her head slowly.</p><p>\u201cThe day of the accident, he found out about us and they got into a fight.\u201d His voice grew smaller and weaker as he recalled the tragic event that took away the woman he loved. \u201cWhen I received the news, my whole world fell apart. Even now\u2026I still blame myself for what happened to her. If I\u2019d just given up and let her go, maybe she would still be here.\u201d</p><p>So that was how it\u2019d happened. Her mother\u2019s affair was the reason there\u2019d been a fight. That was why she\u2019d given her father back the ring and drove away from the damage she\u2019d caused. <i>That</i> was the truth \u2014 a hard pill to swallow.</p><p>\u201cBut you made her happier than my father did\u2026\u201d She spoke after a moment sinking deep in her own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026don\u2019t hate me?\u201d Dave seemed surprised by her reaction. It was certainly not what he\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The girl shook her head. \u201cAt least now I know she was truly loved. So\u2026thank you.\u201d</p><p>Dave didn\u2019t say anything else. Y/N didn\u2019t ask either. They exchanged heartwarming smiles, and Isaac reached out to hold the hand on her lap, giving her a look that said he was there for her if she wanted emotional support. Maybe that was she needed to feel at peace again.</p><p>The drive home was strangely comforting for all the secrets had been revealed, and what was left was just bare relief. Staring out of the car window, Y/N recorded the last images of Heartward into her mind like a goodbye to the little town. Then she began to wonder how many times her mother had driven down that same road, or if she had remembered the map of Heartward like the back of her hand. Maybe Heartward was her mother\u2019s London, the place that wasn\u2019t really home, but there lived the man whom her heart would always belong to.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d The girl chuckled slightly as she watched Isaac stand with his back against the car, one hand still holding hers. Now that she was home safe and he knew that she was safe. She wondered what would happen next. Would they say their goodbyes and he go back to London, maybe back to Italy even?</p><p>The problem was, now she didn\u2019t want him to go.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d He raised both eyebrows, making her toss her head back and crack up.</p><p>\u201cJesus, how many times do I have to tell you that I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, just wanted to be sure,\u201d he said, grinning from ear to ear and checking his watch.</p><p>Y/N studied his expression closely, wishing she could ask him to stay, a part of her was still reluctant that she might\u2019ve troubled him too much already. Nevertheless, it wasn\u2019t her to decide what happened next.</p><p><i>\u201cY/N!\u201d</i></p><p>The loud voice caused both Isaac and Y/N to let go of each other\u2019s hands as they turned to her front door. Her father rushed towards them, followed by Marcy. Both seemed so distressed that Y/N thought it was quite hilarious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019ve only been gone for a couple hours.\u201d</p><p>Isaac chuckled as he watched the girl trying to break away from her father\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cThe car was here and you were gone, so I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I got kidnapped by the ice-cream man?\u201d She laughed, holding him by the arms. It was then that Marcy finally noticed the handsome young man standing right behind her future stepdaughter.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She squealed happily. \u201cWho\u2019s your friend, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Isaac, Y/N\u2019s friend from London. You must be the bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d The woman shook his hand enthusiastically, giving him a massive smile. \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you stay for our wedding? A friend of Y/N\u2019s is a friend of ours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma'am. But I\u2019m only here for today. I\u2019m leaving now actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to stay though?\u201d</p><p>All eyes were on Y/N when she asked that question. She couldn\u2019t really blame them for even she didn\u2019t believe in her own words. Her cheeks instantly turned red as she was sure Isaac noticed how shy she was. His smile grew a bit wider.</p><p>\u201cStay for the wedding?\u201d He questioned, probably just wanting her to say it again.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d She nodded fast, eyes to the side instead of looking at him. \u201cUhm\u2026I do need a wedding date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, but I thought Har\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea!\u201d Bradford cut his bride off just in time as he stepped forward to pat the young man on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe to drive back to London through the night. Come in, we\u2019ll have the guest room ready for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not formally dressed for the wedding\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. It\u2019s just gonna be a family party,\u201d Bradford said, rolling his eyes. \u201cBesides, you cannot miss an opportunity to see Y/N in a pink dress for the first time since she decided that adolescent angst suited her personality better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Y/N cried out, causing the other three to dissolve into laughter. Hiding her face with one hand, she sneaked a look at Isaac, who couldn\u2019t stop beaming at this point. There was something about the radiant joy on his face that made her feel calm. Holding back a laugh, she watched Marcy pull him into their house.</p><p>Marcy was still baking for the wedding tomorrow, and since she had to do it all on her own, she was thrilled to bits when Isaac offered his help.</p><p>\u201cI used to help my mum in the kitchen all the time,\u201d said the young man. That was enough to convince her that he was qualified to be the Executive Sous Chef in her kitchen. Bradford intended to join them as well, but Y/N stopped him right before he could volunteer to lend a hand.</p><p>\u201cDad, can we talk in private?\u201d She asked, holding onto his arm.</p><p>In this household, they rarely discussed their conflicts and problems, just like old furniture, they put those in a dark corner and pretended they didn\u2019t exist until someone suddenly remembered they were still there. But look at what all these secrets they\u2019d kept from each other had turned them into? A broken family. They had never been truly happy under the same roof. From now on, something had to change.</p><p>Bradford followed his daughter upstairs to her room where their conversation couldn\u2019t be heard. When she asked him to sit down in her chair and shut the door, he knew it was something serious. So serious that someone who had avoided every single heart-to-heart talk in her life like Y/N must initiate this conversation.</p><p>Without further ado, she sat down on the edge of her bed and handed him the letter from Dave Hardfield. Judging by the look on his face, she knew he had never expected her to find out like this, if at all.</p><p>\u201cI came to see him today,\u201d she spoke at last, tearing down the silence which was only tormenting them both. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out about this the day before your graduation, darling. And the accident came right after. This news would\u2019ve broken you even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about after the funeral? What about when I moved to London? You\u2019d had so many chances to tell me,\u201d she stated. The tears in her eyes were inevitable yet it still hurt him to see her cry. He didn\u2019t need to know she\u2019d been holding them back since the moment she found those letters in the attic. He didn\u2019t need to know what the other man had said to her. All he knew was his little girl had been through so much only to find out the truth about her mother from a stranger.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to hate her for this.\u201d</p><p>His answer left a lump in her throat as she swallowed her tears and narrowed her eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cSo you just let me hate you instead?\u201d</p><p>When he nodded, her heart nearly cracked open.</p><p>\u201cShe was a better parent than I am,\u201d he said with his head hung low. \u201cYou used to tell her everything. I can\u2019t-I don\u2019t remember the last time we sat down and talked like this. Everything I know about you, your mother told me. The bond you two had was so strong, and you looked up to her so much, I couldn\u2019t take that idea of her away from you. I wanted you to always think about her as a role model so you would always have a reason to never give up.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was speechless. She pressed her lips tight and could only nod fast to replace the words she couldn\u2019t come up with right now. Bradford scooted his chair closer so he could take her hand and hold it tight, meanwhile wiping away the tears rolling down her flushed cheeks, what he should\u2019ve done years ago.</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026did you ever love her?\u201d Her voice trembled as if it was going to break anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cI did. I still do,\u201d he admitted, his eyes now glistened with tears. \u201cMy biggest regret was not appreciating her presence in my life. I didn\u2019t treat her right because I thought she would always be around, until she wasn\u2019t anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026did you hate her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The father shook his head. \u201cAnd I hope you won\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him through the tears, subconsciously reaching up to touch the locket lying close to her heart which was now racing faster than ever. Letting out a shaky breath, she said, \u201cwhat she did cannot change the fact that she loved me, and she was the nicest person I knew. How can I ever stop loving her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>That one-word reply was so simple yet just enough. It was heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time how they both cried and wiped away each other\u2019s tears only to smile again. This was the closest Y/N had ever been to feeling fulfill.</p><p>When she was little, every time her parents fought, she used to wished for a better family with perfect parents who never argued. But maybe this was the best she could get. At least now she knew her imperfect family could finally be a happy one.</p><p><i>\u201cBrad!\u201d</i> Marcy\u2019s voice from downstairs made Bradford and Y/N turn to the door. <i>\u201cDon\u2019t think you can get away with not helping me!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better go.\u201d Y/N chuckled as she rose from the bed. But before she could reach the door, Bradford stopped her by the words he hadn\u2019t said in too long.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N couldn\u2019t keep track on how many nights she\u2019d lost sleep over those three words. She had faced the fear that she might not get to hear them back. She had faced the <i>reality</i> that she <i>didn\u2019t</i> get to hear them back. To hear them now from the man she thought she should hate most in her life had filled the empty space inside her chest, even if temporarily.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she said almost as a whisper but loud enough for her father to hear. Without waiting for a reaction from him, she rushed into his arms, hugging him for the first time since she was just a little girl.</p><p>Now that she was older, she must accept the fact that her parents weren\u2019t heroes and she might not really know the people she\u2019d always thought she knew. However, true love was constant. The love for her mother, for Harry, would always be there, no matter what kind of people they turned out to be or what secrets they\u2019d kept from her. Just like herself, she knew they had their own pain so she couldn\u2019t blame them for their mistakes.</p><p>She might not replicate what she had lost. She wasn\u2019t sure anyone could ever fill the shoes of her mother or <i>him</i>. But some love could only be beautiful if kept in memory. Thus from now on, she was willing to let them both go.</p><p><i>.</i></p><p><i>.</i></p><p><i>.</i></p><p>\u201cSo, this photo was taken on her first day of kindergarten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad! Look at her cute pigtails! I can\u2019t believe you never showed me this before!\u201d</p><p>Y/N sat on the armchair facing the other three on the sofa opposite from her. They had their noses stuck the family photo album. It was like a game to see who could spot the most embarrassing photo of her as a child. Apparently, her dad was winning.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys all done?\u201d She asked, arms crossed in front of her chest as her face contorted, but nobody flinched.</p><p>\u201cAww, the Donald Duck Halloween costume.\u201d Isaac chuckled. He tried to ignore her, yet couldn\u2019t help but glance up to catch a glimpse of the look on her face as she scoffed in response to his comment.</p><p>When Y/N picked out a daisy in front of her and tossed it at him, Marcy wasted no time to grab the vase, holding it firmly against her chest.</p><p>\u201cThe whatever you want, just don\u2019t hurt my flowers!\u201d She said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, the fun\u2019s over!\u201d Y/N rose from her seat to grab the photo album and put it aside. With both hands on her hips, she lifted an eyebrow at the men. \u201cChop chop. Get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma'am,\u201d Isaac and Bradford said at the same time as they hurried back to the tasks they\u2019d been assigned before getting distracted by those photos.</p><p>Bradford stood up so Y/N could take his place next to Isaac and continue arranging those wedding flowers for Marcy. Meanwhile, the father kept on looking for that cook book he hadn\u2019t seen in years, only because Marcy\u2019s parents expected him to cook for them tomorrow night. He was just about to head upstairs and search in his room, when his phone began to ring.</p><p>It was Harry.</p><p>The man had hesitated for a long moment before picking up that call. He didn\u2019t want to see Y/N\u2019s reaction if she caught him speaking to Harry. Even so, he still wanted to know what had happened between them, knowing she would refuse to confide in him, or anyone for that matter.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d He finally answered, keeping his voice down so his family couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p><i>\u201cIs Bambi, I mean, Y/N\u2026Is </i><i>Y/N</i><i> there, sir? If she is, can you get her on the phone?\u201d</i></p><p>Bradford had known Harry since he was little, and he knew Harry was a good person by nature. However, after seeing the pain his daughter had endured, he now must pick a side.</p><p>Sitting in his living room was the man who made his daughter laugh, on the phone was the one who made her cry. The choice should be fast and simple, yet there was utter guilt within his heart when he decided to keep Harry from the truth.</p><p>\u201cShe went out a while ago,\u201d he lied, his heart fell to silence as a long pause followed right after.</p><p><i>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t wanna talk to me, right?\u201d </i>The sadness was clear in Harry\u2019s voice when he finally spoke.</p><p>Even though Bradford had no idea Isaac was Harry\u2019s best friend, he was aware that Harry\u2019s heart would be crushed if he found out Y/N was laughing with another man on the sofa, and the same man would accompany her to the wedding tomorrow. The father had no other choice but to be frank, \u201cI think you should wait until after the wedding, when she returns to London. You know, give her time.\u201d</p><p>Harry was quiet for a while, as if to ponder on his own.</p><p><i>\u201cSir\u2026do you think she still hates me?\u201d</i></p><p>For this question, the older man took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know Y/N that well, but she can never hate you.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI know I would if I were her.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cY/N always says things she doesn\u2019t mean. I thought you would know that better than anyone else.\u201d Bradford chuckled slightly. \u201cShe said she hated you when you left the first time, yet she still sent you those letters.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cLetters?\u201d</i> Harry sounded like he almost choked on the word. <i>\u201cWhat letters?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou never received any? That\u2019s odd\u2026She used to check our mailbox everyday, and her mother once told me that she\u2019d been writing to you.\u201d</p><p>Bradford waited, yet the reply what came after was nothing but silence.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d He mumbled, assuming something was wrong with the phone and the young man couldn\u2019t hear him well, until Harry cleared his throat and said that he was still listening, he must hang up now regardless.</p><p><i>\u201cCan you please ask her to call me back?\u201d</i></p><p>Harry\u2019s plea for help sounded so desperate. Now Bradford could only feel sorry for the boy. He looked over his shoulder, into the living room. Y/N and Isaac had long forgotten that they were supposed to be arranging the wedding flowers. They were too busy fooling around by putting daisies in each other\u2019s hair while guffawing like children. Seeing the beam on his daughter\u2019s face, Bradford was able to empathize with Harry. It definitely wasn\u2019t easy to remember how much you loved someone only when came someone else who wiped away their tears and made them smile again.</p><p>\u201cTake my advice,\u201d the father spoke with a soft reminiscent sigh, turning his back to Y/N and Isaac. \u201cSome things are not meant to be said on the phone.\u201d</p><p>The two-second pause on Harry\u2019s part made Bradford believe his guess was right all along. What Harry wanted to say were the three words that had started this whole mess, and Y/N deserved to hear them in person.</p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d </i>the young man spoke at last. <i>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d</i> And just like that, he muttered his goodbye.</p><p>The call ended with a sense of sorrowful regret, leaving Bradford standing still with messy thoughts flowing through his mind. It was Y/N\u2019s voice that pulled him back to reality.</p><p>\u201cDad, who was it?\u201d</p><p>Turning his head fast, the man locked eyes with his daughter\u2019s. For a second, it was Tam that he saw staring back at him, and in that instant he realized how much Y/N resembled her late mother.</p><p>\u201cWas it him?\u201d Her eyebrows furrowed when he nodded his head as an answer. What was the use of lying when she already knew the truth?</p><p>\u201cYou should call him back,\u201d he suggested. \u201cHe wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna talk to him.\u201d Y/N\u2019s answer turned the man speechless. He parted his lips, yet she was quick to cut him off before he even figured out what else to say. \u201cIf he calls again, tell him he doesn\u2019t have to feel sorry\u2026It was also my fault for expecting too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, it\u2019s not your f\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I won\u2019t call him back.\u201d Y/N interrupted her father once again. \u201cThere\u2019s really no point in torturing each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>From the look in her expressive eyes, the man understood that his daughter was badly hurt by those words of her own, yet she must say them otherwise she could never truly move on.</p><p>In silence, he watched her go back to the living room where Marcy was now instructing Isaac how to arrange those daisies. Even though he respected Y/N\u2019s decision, Bradford knew, just like him, a small part of her still wished it was Harry instead.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was quite a wrench to Harry when that call came to an end and he hadn\u2019t got to hear her voice. The director got real mad at him for being distracted during filming and checking his phone way too often. Harry made up an excuse that he was just tired, yet none of the people he worked with was convinced. It\u2019d been the worst day in his life ever since she left.</p><p>On the drive home, he couldn\u2019t stop replaying the conversation with one of his co-stars, who said,<i> \u201cI feel like this isn\u2019t what you love anymore.\u201d</i></p><p>He\u2019d thought about that sentence a lot before coming to the conclusion that the man who\u2019d said it was completely wrong. This had nothing to do with him being lazy or losing motivation since acting was what he was born to do. He loved his job, and was indeed grateful for all that he had now. But there were also the other things that he loved, one of which was her.</p><p>Now she was 185 miles away from him. And he couldn\u2019t even get her on the phone just to explain why he\u2019d hesitated to admit that he loved her, to apologize and <i>beg</i> for another chance. He knew he couldn\u2019t make it back to the wedding because he\u2019d got a commercial to shoot tomorrow morning, and he couldn\u2019t wait until after because it\u2019d be too long. But maybe her father was right, words would sound much more sincere if they were said in person.</p><p>There was, however, something else that was bothering him. Bradford had mentioned those letters she\u2019d written to him when she was younger. At first he\u2019d assumed they all had got lost in the mail, yet it seemed too much of a coincidence to be true, unless the universe really didn\u2019t want him to read them.</p><p>What if she\u2019d never sent those letters? If so, where were they now?</p><p>Harry was too lost in the questions for himself that he almost didn\u2019t recognize his assistant who was waiting for him outside his house. The girl had to call out his name to get his attention as he walked right past her.</p><p>\u201cJo? What are you doing here so late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff said you had a rough day on set so he asked me to buy you dinner,\u201d said the short brunette as she fixed her glasses and handed the food to her boss. \u201cAnd Miss Ruby Ellis called me a couple times today asking to talk to you, but I told her you were busy. Do you want me to set up a date\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine,\u201d he cut her off fast, pressing his lips into a small smile. \u201cNext time just ignore her calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026Okay\u2026One more thing!\u201d The girl stopped her boss when he unlocked his door. \u201cI brought your laundry into your room and accidentally knocked over the books on your nightstand. I already put them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJo, you don\u2019t have to report everything to me,\u201d Harry replied as he chuckled, assuming the girl was new to her job so she was just overly careful.</p><p>Jo shook her head quickly. \u201cI was afraid that you would see the books in a different place and think I got intrusive and read your journal or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy journal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the pink notebook with your name at the back.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes went wide as realization hit him like a fast-moving train. He thanked his assistant, saying a fast goodbye before rushing into his house. The first thing he did was run to his bedroom and get Y/N\u2019s notebook.</p><p>She\u2019d had it since she was nine. He always knew she wrote a lot in there, including her random thoughts, her favorite quotes, her story ideas, almost everything she could come up with; some she\u2019d read to him, some she\u2019d kept to herself. But he never actually got to read for himself.</p><p>If she was writing letters that she never planned on sending, would there be a better place to keep them?</p><p>Harry felt awful as he brought the pink notebook to his lap and sat down on the bed, inhaling deeply. He wouldn\u2019t want anyone to read his most deepest and personal thoughts, surely she wouldn\u2019t be happy to find out that he wanted to read hers. He was going to anyway. Desperation had got the best of him.</p><p>With trembling hand, he flipped to the back of the notebook, and immediately spotted his name written in small capital letters at the bottom corner of the hard cover. Harry didn\u2019t know why he was smiling as he gently ran his thumb over the word. He missed her too much that such a small detail could make his heart flutter.</p><p>After contemplating it for a whole minute, he took another deep breath and opened it for the first time.</p><p><i>Here goes nothing</i>, said his inner voice.</p><p>The first page, which he\u2019d seen once before, was filled with silly doodles made by a nine-year-old, hence they weren\u2019t pretty. He still remembered the day she showed him these and got mad when he made fun of her for her awful drawing skill. The memory made Harry chuckle as he turned to the second page where lied the very first entry. The ink was slightly faded due to all the years it\u2019d lived by. Her handwriting used to be so easy to read.</p><p>On the first line right below the date, she wrote:</p><p><i>My definition of true happiness is the boy next door. His name is Harry Styles.</i></p></p>",

The bride-to-be was probably influenced by their family tradition \u2014 in this house, they never threw away old things, instead they either tried to fix them or hid them somewhere in case they might need them again. Most of those things ended up in the attic.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it yourself? I\u2019m busy,\u201d Y/N lied in order to get away with the little favor, only to realize how dumb she sounded. If she was in London, it would made total sense since the big city life was always in a rush. But now that she was in Holmes Chapel, how could she possibly be busy? All the people she wanted to be with were now far away. The only thing she could do was drive around town or bring a book to a coffee shop in her neighborhood to read the day away.</p><p>Marcy only gave Y/N a smile, ignoring the lame excuse as she insisted, \u201cI would, but I\u2019m allergic to dust. It\u2019ll only take a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you,\u201d Y/N muttered as she rolled her eyes and marched down the stairs to take the books and magazines from her future stepmother.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>Marcy thanked her for it before rushing back to the kitchen, probably to check on those cookies in the oven for her own wedding tomorrow morning.\u00a0It was only a small celebration so the family did everything by themselves without hiring any wedding planner. Now that the decoration was all finished, Y/N wasn\u2019t much useful around the house since she couldn\u2019t cook. Therefore she told herself it was only fair if she did the small favor for Marcy.</p><p>To be honest, Y/N couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d gone to the attic. That place used to be her nightmare when she was a little girl. The thought of evil creatures lurking in the dark among dusty old furniture and shelves was the reason she\u2019d slept with the light on for an entire month after climbing up there once out of curiosity. Now that she was an adult, it was barely more than a crawl space with low ceiling and mould. She had to hang her head to walk in, trying to locate obstacles in the dark for the only source of light was from the long narrow windows near the ceiling.</p><p>The unsoftened echo of her footsteps on the floor made of timber brought on a claustrophobic feeling, and so she put the books and magazines in the corner to hurry back to the ladder as fast as she could.</p><p>Right before she reached the entrance, Y/N tripped over a small table and almost lost her balance. But she didn\u2019t fall, instead she knocked over a dusty carton box which fell onto the floor and created a loud thump that echoed within the confined space. Dust flying all over the place got the girl coughing uncontrollably, still she decided to bend down and clean up the mess she\u2019d made.</p><p>The first thing that got her attention was a portrait of her younger self, sketched by her mother. Everything in that box belonged to her mother. Most of them were drawings and souvenirs she\u2019d bought on their family trips. Y/N had no idea how long they\u2019d been in this attic, but judging from the yellow hue of the paper, she would guess that they had been there since her mother was still alive.</p><p>As a result, Y/N ended up staying in the attic for longer than she\u2019d intended to. She sat on the floor, going through the rest of the stuff in the box, feeling whole inside for the fact that most of her mother\u2019s sketches were of her face, some others were corners of their house and random objects like a tea set, a bowl of fruits, a flower vase,\u2026</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anything unusual, until\u2026<i>there was</i>.</p><p>At the bottom of the box lied a little tin box. The girl almost didn\u2019t see it for it was hidden too well. For some reason, just looking at it gave her a feeling that there was something inside she had to see.</p><p>With her heart thumping like a drum, she brought it to her lap and carefully opened it. It would\u2019ve been a huge disappointment if the box had been empty like she\u2019d feared, but her instinct rarely made a mistake. The box contained many letters written to her mother from a man named <i>Dave Hardfield, </i>alongside which was a photo of them together. His lips were on Tam\u2019s cheek and Y/N had never seen her mother smile that bright before. At first Y/N assumed the man used to be one of her mother\u2019s boyfriends before meeting her dad. However, when she looked at the date on each letter, she discovered the truth that\u2019d been hidden for all those years. Those letters, <i>love letters</i> to be exact, had all been written and sent when her parents were married already.</p><p>Y/N found out, to her dismay, there were worse fears than invisible monsters in the attic, it was the ones living within every person including the ones you thought you knew all too well.</p><p>She picked up one of the letters to read through the first few lines just to make sure she didn\u2019t draw any conclusion way too soon. But what she learnt wasn\u2019t what her heart wished it\u2019d be. Her mother had been in love, <i>madly</i> in love, but with another man, <i>not</i> her father.</p><p>She felt a lump in her throat when she read the part about them planning on leaving this town once the divorce had been settled. That letter came just a week before the accident.</p><p>The grip of her hands tightened, nearly tearing the page in two. She was so in shock that her brain stuttered for a moment and breathing became difficult. It took her a while to come back to her sense and gather everything besides the letter to put it back in the tin box before leaving.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even think as she hurried down the ladder, marching straight to the front door while clutching the letter in her hand. This man, whoever he was, might have the answers to most of the questions she\u2019d been asking herself since her mother\u2019s death, beginning with what had happened the night of the accident. Y/N walked fast, wasting no time, yet her father appeared without warning to stop her right before she could reach for the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He asked, raising an eyebrow at his daughter, who was quick to hide the letter behind her back.</p><p>\u201cTo a coffee shop,\u201d she said, trying too hard not to let her anxiety show. And maybe she was putting on such a good act that her dad didn\u2019t seem to suspect a thing.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would stay to help us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will when I get back. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, young lady.\u201d Bradford cleared his throat loudly as he clutched her by the arm when she barely managed to escape. \u201cYou\u2019re acting strange. Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p><p>That reply was followed by the fakest laugh she\u2019d ever pulled. Even she knew that, how could her father not?</p><p>\u201cIs it\u2014\u201d The man paused to decide if he should make a guess. It wasn\u2019t really a guess since he already knew the truth. It was because of Harry. She\u2019d been crying for that boy and hurting for that boy, like she had most of her life. It was obvious. But then again, Bradford pretended like he had no clue. His daughter had never been a sentimental person, not openly at least. Maybe it was one thing they both had in common.</p><p>\u201cNever mind\u2026\u201d He sighed, twitching his lips. \u201cBe back soon, alright?\u201d</p><p>Smiling in return, Y/N gave her father a firm nod. \u201cHey dad, can I borrow your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But don\u2019t crash it.\u201d</p><p>It was meant to be a harmless joke. But as both of them came to realization, they just quietly stared at each other for two seconds long. Bradford handed her his car key, stuttering as he wanted to say something to lighten up the mood. Unfortunately, Y/N didn\u2019t hesitate to walk out of the door.</p><p>The truth was, she had no plan at all. She just knew she was going to see the man named Dave Hardfield, whose address was on the letters sent to her mum. She didn\u2019t even have the script of the things she should say, or the list of questions about everything she was dying to know. She just wanted to go see the man to learn the truth, whatever it was, even when she wasn\u2019t ready to hear it from a complete stranger.</p><p>Funny how one surprise came right after another without a single break. The last person Y/N would expect to show up in Holmes Chapel right now, was waiting right outside her house by his car.</p><p>\u201cIsaac?\u201d She gasped, walking fast towards the man whose smile was as bright as the sun when he saw her face. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried about you. Wanted to make sure you were alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2026drove all the way here from London\u2026to see me?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, letting it all out. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna tell me I\u2019m stupid for doing this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>To his surprise, she shook her head fast and pulled him into a hug so tight that it almost took his breath away, <i>literally</i>. Y/N didn\u2019t seem to care as she kept repeating the words \u201cthank you\u201d into his shoulder, leaving him no choice but to also wrap his arms around her.</p><p>It finally occurred to her how desperate she was for a hug. It didn\u2019t matter whose. She just needed to feel a little bit of comfort after the series of traumatic events that\u2019d been after her lately. At least with Isaac she knew there was only peace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Heartward,\u201d she said, pulling away but her hands were still resting on his hips. \u201cWanna come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a town nearby, only an hour drive from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Shocked by the answer, she grabbed him by the wrist when he turned back to unlock his car doors.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna ask me why I\u2019m going there?\u201d She raised both eyebrows, mouth agape. He, on the other hand, looked as cool as ever.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an hour in the car, right?\u201d Isaac said with a beam as he opened the door on the passenger side for Y/N.</p><p>Now she felt the need to hug him again for she didn\u2019t think she could ever repay his kindness. In order to save time, however, she\u2019d probably save that later. If they didn\u2019t get going right away, they wouldn\u2019t be back soon enough for her dad to not suspect a thing.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d She exclaimed with a bright smile, watching Isaac shake his head as he laughed before getting into the vehicle as well.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>For most of her life, Y/N had lived in Holmes Chapel and hadn\u2019t realized until now that she\u2019d never gone any further than her neighborhood. This was her first journey to a different town in Cheshire. As turned out, it was a lot different from her own. The streets here were narrower and the houses were smaller. While Holmes Chapel had always been simple, Heartward was a maze with the labyrinth of roads, as complex as the human heart.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d Isaac\u2019s voice pulled Y/N\u2019s attention away from the window, back on him.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d She snorted, inhaling deeply to let the silence sink back in for a couple seconds before speaking up again. \u201cWhat type of person do you think he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably kind. I mean, your mother was kind.\u201d</p><p>The answer made the girl chuckle as she lifted an eyebrow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you,\u201d he said, his blue eyes sparked with joy.</p><p>In that instant, Y/N felt warm within and she was glad he\u2019d shown up at her door. She would still be freaking out right now if she\u2019d gone alone. It was rather funny how she\u2019d been his damsel in distress countless of times ever since they first met. Sometimes she did think about it and wondered how he still felt about her after everything. Was he nice to the others too or her only? If the latter was the case, then there was another reason for her to believe she didn\u2019t deserve someone like him.</p><p>The smile grew on Y/N\u2019s face as she watched Isaac\u2019s face screw up while he was concentrating on the road ahead. That same smile, sadly, died out the second he brought up the name she\u2019d tried to erase from memory.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Harry?\u201d</p><p>Y/N gave Isaac a shrug, turning back to the window on her side. \u201cI will\u2026at some point.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask any further, thank god for that. The last thing she wanted was for him to figure out what had really happened between her and Harry. Though she no longer felt the pressure to reveal her sexual relationship with him to Isaac or anyone else for that matter, she was still afraid what Isaac might think of her if somehow he found out. Honestly, she felt <i>cheap</i>. Even though her feelings for Harry had always been true, to him she was just a replacement, nothing but a body to get him through the night while his heart stayed missing somebody else. But that was exactly what she\u2019d signed up for, so she shouldn\u2019t be bitter now that it didn\u2019t end the way she wanted.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of the devil,\u201d the girl muttered under her breath when a couple texts from <b>H</b> popped up on her screen.</p><p>\u201cRead it,\u201d Isaac said, his eyebrows furrowed. \u201cHe must worry about you a lot.\u201d</p><p>Little did he knew, Y/N did want to. She <i>really</i> wanted to.</p><p>Harry had called her a hundred times since this morning and she\u2019d fought herself from answering those calls. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t hurt if she only read his texts and not reply to them. Nodding in response to Isaac\u2019s words, she eventually opened those messages.</p><p>\u2332<b> H: </b><i>If you get this, please text me back.</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>H:</b><i> Let me know you\u2019re safe.</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>H:</b> <i>Please call me back, text me, anything.</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>H:</b> <i>I need to talk to you please.</i></p><p>\u201cSo? How\u2019s he?\u201d</p><p>Y/N turned off her phone and put it away as she also turned a deaf ear to Isaac\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told him where I am, right?\u201d She asked in concern, only to sigh in relief when he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIf I had, he would be here instead of me.\u201d With a slight chuckle, he added, \u201cyou\u2019re really good at ghosting on people, Smiley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the ones who deserve it.\u201d</p><p>When Y/N received no reply, she turned to see the a goofy grin on the man\u2019s face.</p><p>Pinching his lip slightly, Isaac kept his eyes on the road rather on her as he joked, \u201cif I hadn\u2019t texted you when I was in Italy, we would never have spoken again, right?\u201d</p><p>She knew he wasn\u2019t serious when he said that, but his expression alone could still pain her heart. A sense of guilt flooded into her hollow chest to replace the comfort she\u2019d been feeling this entire time in the car with him. Isaac was too nice to admit that she had hurt him too for coldly turning him down once before. She\u2019d been too busy paying attention to how she was feeling and forgotten about him. Why was he still here after everything? Why was he still treating her like the only person in the world who mattered? Why hadn\u2019t he asked for anything in return?</p><p>\u201cIsaac\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! We\u2019re here!\u201d The man happily announced as he slowed down and pulled his car over on the side of the road. She wasn\u2019t sure if he cut her off on purpose or he genuinely didn\u2019t hear her. But maybe this wasn\u2019t the time to talk about them.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is the place?\u201d She asked in disbelief when they both got out of the car at the same time.</p><p>\u201cIt is. I\u2019ve checked the address twice,\u201d he assured, yet looking just as appalled as she was.</p><p>The house they were looking for was square and grey, with narrow windows that looked far from picturesque. Y/N had to check the address for the third time to make sure it matched the one on the letter. This place looked like it\u2019d been abandoned for years. Maybe the owner didn\u2019t really care to pay enough attention to making his front yard and porch look even the slightest presentable.</p><p>Exchanging worrying looks with Isaac, she finally found enough courage to press the doorbell. She wasn\u2019t sure if anybody was home because through the windows all that she saw was a part of the pitch dark living room as far as natural light could reach.</p><p>Fortunately, just when the two of them thought they might have to leave empty handed, the door slowly creaked open.</p><p>Y/N had never met this man in her life, but his expression when he saw her made her think he had known her his entire life. His face was stern, yet peaceful. And even though his hair was turning grey and the wrinkles were slightly visible on his broad forehead, he still appeared quite handsome for a man his age.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, sir,\u201d Y/N spoke after two awkward seconds passing by unnoticed. \u201cAre you\u2026<i>Dave Hardfield</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d The middle-aged man nodded, his eyes were still round as he stared at her in confusion. \u201cYou are\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N, Tam\u2019s daughter,\u201d she said, handing him the envelope she\u2019d been holding the entire time. \u201cI found your letter in my attic, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>That sentence was left unfinished when Dave opened his arms and dragged her into a hug without warning. Isaac flinched, nearly pulling Y/N back for he feared the man might do something to her, but the moment he spotted the hopeful look on Dave\u2019s face, he decided to stay back and remain silent.</p><p>\u201cYou look just like her.\u201d</p><p>Those words from the stranger made Y/N\u2019s eyes well up when he loosened his embrace to cup her face. He examined her features, eyes glistened with tears as a smile spread across his chapped lips.</p><p>\u201cShe has the same beautiful eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow\u2026that\u2019s very\u2026nice of you. Thank you\u2026\u201d</p><p>Isaac couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at Y/N\u2019s reply, receiving a playful glare when she turned back to him.</p><p>\u201cCome in, you two! come in!\u201d Dave said fast, giving Y/N and Isaac no time to hesitate before urging them into his living room. When the door was shut, and the lights were on, Y/N saw the living proof of the saying \u2019<i>never judge a book by its cover</i>\u2019. The interior was the opposite of the mess she\u2019d seen when she first arrived \u2014 tidy and very well-taken care of.</p><p>Dave\u2019s living room gave away more than it was supposed to. Every decoration was soft and homely, showing the fact that he probably lived alone. In order to fill the void, he had created a cozy place that made him feel safe and warm so he would\u2019t have to come home to remember how lonely he was. Y/N would know that better than anyone.</p><p>Above the fireplace were pictures of him with his children, she assumed, for they were arranged from the left when his twins were babies to the latest one on the right being the three of them together at the girls\u2019 graduation. There was no photo of the wife.</p><p>Dave sat down on his chair and pointed to the sofa in front of him, telling his two guests to make themselves at home. There was already a tea set on the table, so he made two cups for Y/N and Isaac, saying that he\u2019d already had his before they arrived.</p><p>\u201cSo Y/N, is this your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Y/N blushed hard when she caught Isaac\u2019s stare and turned away quickly.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Isaac, I\u2019m her friend from London,\u201d said the young man as he reached out to shake Dave\u2019s hand, showing his signature Prince Charming smirk. How could anyone not go soft for that?</p><p>\u201cOh, how do you like Holmes Chapel so far, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve been in Heartward for longer than Holmes Chapel.\u201d He chuckled, glancing at Y/N who furrowed her eyebrows at him. \u201cThis one literally dragged me here when I first arrived at her house.\u201d</p><p>She pushed his shoulder playfully, laughing along. \u201cIn my defense, I did ask if he wanted to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe things we do for these ladies, right?\u201d</p><p>Dave\u2019s comment made Isaac chuckle, but Y/N had already turned away to hide the fact that she was all flustered.</p><p>As the young people enjoyed their tea, the older man took his own letter out of the envelope, smiling nonchalantly at the memories while rereading what he\u2019d written two years ago.</p><p>Y/N gave him a moment to get lost in his happy thoughts before breaking the silence among the three of them. \u201cSo it\u2019s true\u2026you and my mother\u2026\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s beam slowly turned into a frown as he sighed heavily, putting the letter back into its envelope.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he confessed, eyes locked with the girl who still seemed in denial even though she\u2019d known the truth ever since she first read his letter. Her mother, a cheater? The woman she\u2019d looked up to her entire life turned out to be that kind of person? It didn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>\u201cWe were in love,\u201d Dave went on despite the look on her face. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I was proud of, to fall head over heels for a married woman. But\u2026I guess we never get to choose whom we fall in love with.\u201d</p><p>Isaac\u2019s eyes were on Y/N, yet hers were fixed on the man who was speaking. She didn\u2019t know how to feel anymore. Should she hate this man for ruining her parents\u2019 marriage just like how she had hated Marcy for thinking it was her? The problem was, she couldn\u2019t grow to hate him, not even the tiniest bit.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Dave asked, eyes squinting at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cTwenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He sucked in a breath and rubbed his palms together nervously. \u201cYou were fifteen when I met her. Can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you married at the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My ex-wife left me when my girls were only six. They barely remember her.\u201d</p><p>The look on his face was heartbreaking still.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Y/N as she wetted her dry lips. \u201cUhm\u2026where are your children now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both living in California with their husbands. I\u2019m very proud of them,\u201d he said with a huge grin. That was enough to tell how much his children meant to him. \u201cThey\u2019re just four years older than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re the same age as you!\u201d Y/N told Isaac, who responded with a slight laugh for how excited she seemed to discover the coincidence.</p><p>\u201cWhen the girls left home, I was devastated,\u201d Dave continued with a sad smile, looking at them both. \u201cTam was the best thing to happen to me at the time. I believe I was also hers. She was unhappy in her marriage, yet she couldn\u2019t leave because\u2026she didn\u2019t want to force you to choose between her and your father.\u201d</p><p>Y/N stayed silent, nodding her head slowly.</p><p>\u201cThe day of the accident, he found out about us and they got into a fight.\u201d His voice grew smaller and weaker as he recalled the tragic event that took away the woman he loved. \u201cWhen I received the news, my whole world fell apart. Even now\u2026I still blame myself for what happened to her. If I\u2019d just given up and let her go, maybe she would still be here.\u201d</p><p>So that was how it\u2019d happened. Her mother\u2019s affair was the reason there\u2019d been a fight. That was why she\u2019d given her father back the ring and drove away from the damage she\u2019d caused. <i>That</i> was the truth \u2014 a hard pill to swallow.</p><p>\u201cBut you made her happier than my father did\u2026\u201d She spoke after a moment sinking deep in her own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026don\u2019t hate me?\u201d Dave seemed surprised by her reaction. It was certainly not what he\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The girl shook her head. \u201cAt least now I know she was truly loved. So\u2026thank you.\u201d</p><p>Dave didn\u2019t say anything else. Y/N didn\u2019t ask either. They exchanged heartwarming smiles, and Isaac reached out to hold the hand on her lap, giving her a look that said he was there for her if she wanted emotional support. Maybe that was she needed to feel at peace again.</p><p>The drive home was strangely comforting for all the secrets had been revealed, and what was left was just bare relief. Staring out of the car window, Y/N recorded the last images of Heartward into her mind like a goodbye to the little town. Then she began to wonder how many times her mother had driven down that same road, or if she had remembered the map of Heartward like the back of her hand. Maybe Heartward was her mother\u2019s London, the place that wasn\u2019t really home, but there lived the man whom her heart would always belong to.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d The girl chuckled slightly as she watched Isaac stand with his back against the car, one hand still holding hers. Now that she was home safe and he knew that she was safe. She wondered what would happen next. Would they say their goodbyes and he go back to London, maybe back to Italy even?</p><p>The problem was, now she didn\u2019t want him to go.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d He raised both eyebrows, making her toss her head back and crack up.</p><p>\u201cJesus, how many times do I have to tell you that I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, just wanted to be sure,\u201d he said, grinning from ear to ear and checking his watch.</p><p>Y/N studied his expression closely, wishing she could ask him to stay, a part of her was still reluctant that she might\u2019ve troubled him too much already. Nevertheless, it wasn\u2019t her to decide what happened next.</p><p><i>\u201cY/N!\u201d</i></p><p>The loud voice caused both Isaac and Y/N to let go of each other\u2019s hands as they turned to her front door. Her father rushed towards them, followed by Marcy. Both seemed so distressed that Y/N thought it was quite hilarious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019ve only been gone for a couple hours.\u201d</p><p>Isaac chuckled as he watched the girl trying to break away from her father\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cThe car was here and you were gone, so I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I got kidnapped by the ice-cream man?\u201d She laughed, holding him by the arms. It was then that Marcy finally noticed the handsome young man standing right behind her future stepdaughter.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She squealed happily. \u201cWho\u2019s your friend, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Isaac, Y/N\u2019s friend from London. You must be the bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d The woman shook his hand enthusiastically, giving him a massive smile. \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you stay for our wedding? A friend of Y/N\u2019s is a friend of ours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma'am. But I\u2019m only here for today. I\u2019m leaving now actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to stay though?\u201d</p><p>All eyes were on Y/N when she asked that question. She couldn\u2019t really blame them for even she didn\u2019t believe in her own words. Her cheeks instantly turned red as she was sure Isaac noticed how shy she was. His smile grew a bit wider.</p><p>\u201cStay for the wedding?\u201d He questioned, probably just wanting her to say it again.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d She nodded fast, eyes to the side instead of looking at him. \u201cUhm\u2026I do need a wedding date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, but I thought Har\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea!\u201d Bradford cut his bride off just in time as he stepped forward to pat the young man on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe to drive back to London through the night. Come in, we\u2019ll have the guest room ready for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not formally dressed for the wedding\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. It\u2019s just gonna be a family party,\u201d Bradford said, rolling his eyes. \u201cBesides, you cannot miss an opportunity to see Y/N in a pink dress for the first time since she decided that adolescent angst suited her personality better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Y/N cried out, causing the other three to dissolve into laughter. Hiding her face with one hand, she sneaked a look at Isaac, who couldn\u2019t stop beaming at this point. There was something about the radiant joy on his face that made her feel calm. Holding back a laugh, she watched Marcy pull him into their house.</p><p>Marcy was still baking for the wedding tomorrow, and since she had to do it all on her own, she was thrilled to bits when Isaac offered his help.</p><p>\u201cI used to help my mum in the kitchen all the time,\u201d said the young man. That was enough to convince her that he was qualified to be the Executive Sous Chef in her kitchen. Bradford intended to join them as well, but Y/N stopped him right before he could volunteer to lend a hand.</p><p>\u201cDad, can we talk in private?\u201d She asked, holding onto his arm.</p><p>In this household, they rarely discussed their conflicts and problems, just like old furniture, they put those in a dark corner and pretended they didn\u2019t exist until someone suddenly remembered they were still there. But look at what all these secrets they\u2019d kept from each other had turned them into? A broken family. They had never been truly happy under the same roof. From now on, something had to change.</p><p>Bradford followed his daughter upstairs to her room where their conversation couldn\u2019t be heard. When she asked him to sit down in her chair and shut the door, he knew it was something serious. So serious that someone who had avoided every single heart-to-heart talk in her life like Y/N must initiate this conversation.</p><p>Without further ado, she sat down on the edge of her bed and handed him the letter from Dave Hardfield. Judging by the look on his face, she knew he had never expected her to find out like this, if at all.</p><p>\u201cI came to see him today,\u201d she spoke at last, tearing down the silence which was only tormenting them both. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out about this the day before your graduation, darling. And the accident came right after. This news would\u2019ve broken you even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about after the funeral? What about when I moved to London? You\u2019d had so many chances to tell me,\u201d she stated. The tears in her eyes were inevitable yet it still hurt him to see her cry. He didn\u2019t need to know she\u2019d been holding them back since the moment she found those letters in the attic. He didn\u2019t need to know what the other man had said to her. All he knew was his little girl had been through so much only to find out the truth about her mother from a stranger.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to hate her for this.\u201d</p><p>His answer left a lump in her throat as she swallowed her tears and narrowed her eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cSo you just let me hate you instead?\u201d</p><p>When he nodded, her heart nearly cracked open.</p><p>\u201cShe was a better parent than I am,\u201d he said with his head hung low. \u201cYou used to tell her everything. I can\u2019t-I don\u2019t remember the last time we sat down and talked like this. Everything I know about you, your mother told me. The bond you two had was so strong, and you looked up to her so much, I couldn\u2019t take that idea of her away from you. I wanted you to always think about her as a role model so you would always have a reason to never give up.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was speechless. She pressed her lips tight and could only nod fast to replace the words she couldn\u2019t come up with right now. Bradford scooted his chair closer so he could take her hand and hold it tight, meanwhile wiping away the tears rolling down her flushed cheeks, what he should\u2019ve done years ago.</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026did you ever love her?\u201d Her voice trembled as if it was going to break anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cI did. I still do,\u201d he admitted, his eyes now glistened with tears. \u201cMy biggest regret was not appreciating her presence in my life. I didn\u2019t treat her right because I thought she would always be around, until she wasn\u2019t anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026did you hate her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The father shook his head. \u201cAnd I hope you won\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him through the tears, subconsciously reaching up to touch the locket lying close to her heart which was now racing faster than ever. Letting out a shaky breath, she said, \u201cwhat she did cannot change the fact that she loved me, and she was the nicest person I knew. How can I ever stop loving her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>That one-word reply was so simple yet just enough. It was heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time how they both cried and wiped away each other\u2019s tears only to smile again. This was the closest Y/N had ever been to feeling fulfill.</p><p>When she was little, every time her parents fought, she used to wished for a better family with perfect parents who never argued. But maybe this was the best she could get. At least now she knew her imperfect family could finally be a happy one.</p><p><i>\u201cBrad!\u201d</i> Marcy\u2019s voice from downstairs made Bradford and Y/N turn to the door. <i>\u201cDon\u2019t think you can get away with not helping me!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better go.\u201d Y/N chuckled as she rose from the bed. But before she could reach the door, Bradford stopped her by the words he hadn\u2019t said in too long.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N couldn\u2019t keep track on how many nights she\u2019d lost sleep over those three words. She had faced the fear that she might not get to hear them back. She had faced the <i>reality</i> that she <i>didn\u2019t</i> get to hear them back. To hear them now from the man she thought she should hate most in her life had filled the empty space inside her chest, even if temporarily.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she said almost as a whisper but loud enough for her father to hear. Without waiting for a reaction from him, she rushed into his arms, hugging him for the first time since she was just a little girl.</p><p>Now that she was older, she must accept the fact that her parents weren\u2019t heroes and she might not really know the people she\u2019d always thought she knew. However, true love was constant. The love for her mother, for Harry, would always be there, no matter what kind of people they turned out to be or what secrets they\u2019d kept from her. Just like herself, she knew they had their own pain so she couldn\u2019t blame them for their mistakes.</p><p>She might not replicate what she had lost. She wasn\u2019t sure anyone could ever fill the shoes of her mother or <i>him</i>. But some love could only be beautiful if kept in memory. Thus from now on, she was willing to let them both go.</p><p><i>.</i></p><p><i>.</i></p><p><i>.</i></p><p>\u201cSo, this photo was taken on her first day of kindergarten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad! Look at her cute pigtails! I can\u2019t believe you never showed me this before!\u201d</p><p>Y/N sat on the armchair facing the other three on the sofa opposite from her. They had their noses stuck the family photo album. It was like a game to see who could spot the most embarrassing photo of her as a child. Apparently, her dad was winning.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys all done?\u201d She asked, arms crossed in front of her chest as her face contorted, but nobody flinched.</p><p>\u201cAww, the Donald Duck Halloween costume.\u201d Isaac chuckled. He tried to ignore her, yet couldn\u2019t help but glance up to catch a glimpse of the look on her face as she scoffed in response to his comment.</p><p>When Y/N picked out a daisy in front of her and tossed it at him, Marcy wasted no time to grab the vase, holding it firmly against her chest.</p><p>\u201cThe whatever you want, just don\u2019t hurt my flowers!\u201d She said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, the fun\u2019s over!\u201d Y/N rose from her seat to grab the photo album and put it aside. With both hands on her hips, she lifted an eyebrow at the men. \u201cChop chop. Get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma'am,\u201d Isaac and Bradford said at the same time as they hurried back to the tasks they\u2019d been assigned before getting distracted by those photos.</p><p>Bradford stood up so Y/N could take his place next to Isaac and continue arranging those wedding flowers for Marcy. Meanwhile, the father kept on looking for that cook book he hadn\u2019t seen in years, only because Marcy\u2019s parents expected him to cook for them tomorrow night. He was just about to head upstairs and search in his room, when his phone began to ring.</p><p>It was Harry.</p><p>The man had hesitated for a long moment before picking up that call. He didn\u2019t want to see Y/N\u2019s reaction if she caught him speaking to Harry. Even so, he still wanted to know what had happened between them, knowing she would refuse to confide in him, or anyone for that matter.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d He finally answered, keeping his voice down so his family couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p><i>\u201cIs Bambi, I mean, Y/N\u2026Is </i><i>Y/N</i><i> there, sir? If she is, can you get her on the phone?\u201d</i></p><p>Bradford had known Harry since he was little, and he knew Harry was a good person by nature. However, after seeing the pain his daughter had endured, he now must pick a side.</p><p>Sitting in his living room was the man who made his daughter laugh, on the phone was the one who made her cry. The choice should be fast and simple, yet there was utter guilt within his heart when he decided to keep Harry from the truth.</p><p>\u201cShe went out a while ago,\u201d he lied, his heart fell to silence as a long pause followed right after.</p><p><i>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t wanna talk to me, right?\u201d </i>The sadness was clear in Harry\u2019s voice when he finally spoke.</p><p>Even though Bradford had no idea Isaac was Harry\u2019s best friend, he was aware that Harry\u2019s heart would be crushed if he found out Y/N was laughing with another man on the sofa, and the same man would accompany her to the wedding tomorrow. The father had no other choice but to be frank, \u201cI think you should wait until after the wedding, when she returns to London. You know, give her time.\u201d</p><p>Harry was quiet for a while, as if to ponder on his own.</p><p><i>\u201cSir\u2026do you think she still hates me?\u201d</i></p><p>For this question, the older man took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know Y/N that well, but she can never hate you.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI know I would if I were her.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cY/N always says things she doesn\u2019t mean. I thought you would know that better than anyone else.\u201d Bradford chuckled slightly. \u201cShe said she hated you when you left the first time, yet she still sent you those letters.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cLetters?\u201d</i> Harry sounded like he almost choked on the word. <i>\u201cWhat letters?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou never received any? That\u2019s odd\u2026She used to check our mailbox everyday, and her mother once told me that she\u2019d been writing to you.\u201d</p><p>Bradford waited, yet the reply what came after was nothing but silence.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d He mumbled, assuming something was wrong with the phone and the young man couldn\u2019t hear him well, until Harry cleared his throat and said that he was still listening, he must hang up now regardless.</p><p><i>\u201cCan you please ask her to call me back?\u201d</i></p><p>Harry\u2019s plea for help sounded so desperate. Now Bradford could only feel sorry for the boy. He looked over his shoulder, into the living room. Y/N and Isaac had long forgotten that they were supposed to be arranging the wedding flowers. They were too busy fooling around by putting daisies in each other\u2019s hair while guffawing like children. Seeing the beam on his daughter\u2019s face, Bradford was able to empathize with Harry. It definitely wasn\u2019t easy to remember how much you loved someone only when came someone else who wiped away their tears and made them smile again.</p><p>\u201cTake my advice,\u201d the father spoke with a soft reminiscent sigh, turning his back to Y/N and Isaac. \u201cSome things are not meant to be said on the phone.\u201d</p><p>The two-second pause on Harry\u2019s part made Bradford believe his guess was right all along. What Harry wanted to say were the three words that had started this whole mess, and Y/N deserved to hear them in person.</p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d </i>the young man spoke at last. <i>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d</i> And just like that, he muttered his goodbye.</p><p>The call ended with a sense of sorrowful regret, leaving Bradford standing still with messy thoughts flowing through his mind. It was Y/N\u2019s voice that pulled him back to reality.</p><p>\u201cDad, who was it?\u201d</p><p>Turning his head fast, the man locked eyes with his daughter\u2019s. For a second, it was Tam that he saw staring back at him, and in that instant he realized how much Y/N resembled her late mother.</p><p>\u201cWas it him?\u201d Her eyebrows furrowed when he nodded his head as an answer. What was the use of lying when she already knew the truth?</p><p>\u201cYou should call him back,\u201d he suggested. \u201cHe wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna talk to him.\u201d Y/N\u2019s answer turned the man speechless. He parted his lips, yet she was quick to cut him off before he even figured out what else to say. \u201cIf he calls again, tell him he doesn\u2019t have to feel sorry\u2026It was also my fault for expecting too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, it\u2019s not your f\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I won\u2019t call him back.\u201d Y/N interrupted her father once again. \u201cThere\u2019s really no point in torturing each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>From the look in her expressive eyes, the man understood that his daughter was badly hurt by those words of her own, yet she must say them otherwise she could never truly move on.</p><p>In silence, he watched her go back to the living room where Marcy was now instructing Isaac how to arrange those daisies. Even though he respected Y/N\u2019s decision, Bradford knew, just like him, a small part of her still wished it was Harry instead.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was quite a wrench to Harry when that call came to an end and he hadn\u2019t got to hear her voice. The director got real mad at him for being distracted during filming and checking his phone way too often. Harry made up an excuse that he was just tired, yet none of the people he worked with was convinced. It\u2019d been the worst day in his life ever since she left.</p><p>On the drive home, he couldn\u2019t stop replaying the conversation with one of his co-stars, who said,<i> \u201cI feel like this isn\u2019t what you love anymore.\u201d</i></p><p>He\u2019d thought about that sentence a lot before coming to the conclusion that the man who\u2019d said it was completely wrong. This had nothing to do with him being lazy or losing motivation since acting was what he was born to do. He loved his job, and was indeed grateful for all that he had now. But there were also the other things that he loved, one of which was her.</p><p>Now she was 185 miles away from him. And he couldn\u2019t even get her on the phone just to explain why he\u2019d hesitated to admit that he loved her, to apologize and <i>beg</i> for another chance. He knew he couldn\u2019t make it back to the wedding because he\u2019d got a commercial to shoot tomorrow morning, and he couldn\u2019t wait until after because it\u2019d be too long. But maybe her father was right, words would sound much more sincere if they were said in person.</p><p>There was, however, something else that was bothering him. Bradford had mentioned those letters she\u2019d written to him when she was younger. At first he\u2019d assumed they all had got lost in the mail, yet it seemed too much of a coincidence to be true, unless the universe really didn\u2019t want him to read them.</p><p>What if she\u2019d never sent those letters? If so, where were they now?</p><p>Harry was too lost in the questions for himself that he almost didn\u2019t recognize his assistant who was waiting for him outside his house. The girl had to call out his name to get his attention as he walked right past her.</p><p>\u201cJo? What are you doing here so late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff said you had a rough day on set so he asked me to buy you dinner,\u201d said the short brunette as she fixed her glasses and handed the food to her boss. \u201cAnd Miss Ruby Ellis called me a couple times today asking to talk to you, but I told her you were busy. Do you want me to set up a date\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine,\u201d he cut her off fast, pressing his lips into a small smile. \u201cNext time just ignore her calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026Okay\u2026One more thing!\u201d The girl stopped her boss when he unlocked his door. \u201cI brought your laundry into your room and accidentally knocked over the books on your nightstand. I already put them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJo, you don\u2019t have to report everything to me,\u201d Harry replied as he chuckled, assuming the girl was new to her job so she was just overly careful.</p><p>Jo shook her head quickly. \u201cI was afraid that you would see the books in a different place and think I got intrusive and read your journal or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy journal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the pink notebook with your name at the back.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes went wide as realization hit him like a fast-moving train. He thanked his assistant, saying a fast goodbye before rushing into his house. The first thing he did was run to his bedroom and get Y/N\u2019s notebook.</p><p>She\u2019d had it since she was nine. He always knew she wrote a lot in there, including her random thoughts, her favorite quotes, her story ideas, almost everything she could come up with; some she\u2019d read to him, some she\u2019d kept to herself. But he never actually got to read for himself.</p><p>If she was writing letters that she never planned on sending, would there be a better place to keep them?</p><p>Harry felt awful as he brought the pink notebook to his lap and sat down on the bed, inhaling deeply. He wouldn\u2019t want anyone to read his most deepest and personal thoughts, surely she wouldn\u2019t be happy to find out that he wanted to read hers. He was going to anyway. Desperation had got the best of him.</p><p>With trembling hand, he flipped to the back of the notebook, and immediately spotted his name written in small capital letters at the bottom corner of the hard cover. Harry didn\u2019t know why he was smiling as he gently ran his thumb over the word. He missed her too much that such a small detail could make his heart flutter.</p><p>After contemplating it for a whole minute, he took another deep breath and opened it for the first time.</p><p><i>Here goes nothing</i>, said his inner voice.</p><p>The first page, which he\u2019d seen once before, was filled with silly doodles made by a nine-year-old, hence they weren\u2019t pretty. He still remembered the day she showed him these and got mad when he made fun of her for her awful drawing skill. The memory made Harry chuckle as he turned to the second page where lied the very first entry. The ink was slightly faded due to all the years it\u2019d lived by. Her handwriting used to be so easy to read.</p><p>On the first line right below the date, she wrote:</p><p><i>My definition of true happiness is the boy next door. His name is Harry Styles.</i></p></p>",

The bride-to-be was probably influenced by their family tradition &mdash; in this house, they never threw away old things, instead they either tried to fix them or hid them somewhere in case they might need them again. Most of those things ended up in the attic.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do it yourself? I&rsquo;m busy,&rdquo; Y/N lied in order to get away with the little favor, only to realize how dumb she sounded. If she was in London, it would made total sense since the big city life was always in a rush. But now that she was in Holmes Chapel, how could she possibly be busy? All the people she wanted to be with were now far away. The only thing she could do was drive around town or bring a book to a coffee shop in her neighborhood to read the day away.</p><p>Marcy only gave Y/N a smile, ignoring the lame excuse as she insisted, &ldquo;I would, but I&rsquo;m allergic to dust. It&rsquo;ll only take a minute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lucky you,&rdquo; Y/N muttered as she rolled her eyes and marched down the stairs to take the books and magazines from her future stepmother.&nbsp;</p><p>Marcy thanked her for it before rushing back to the kitchen, probably to check on those cookies in the oven for her own wedding tomorrow morning.&nbsp;It was only a small celebration so the family did everything by themselves without hiring any wedding planner. Now that the decoration was all finished, Y/N wasn&rsquo;t much useful around the house since she couldn&rsquo;t cook. Therefore she told herself it was only fair if she did the small favor for Marcy.</p><p>To be honest, Y/N couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time she&rsquo;d gone to the attic. That place used to be her nightmare when she was a little girl. The thought of evil creatures lurking in the dark among dusty old furniture and shelves was the reason she&rsquo;d slept with the light on for an entire month after climbing up there once out of curiosity. Now that she was an adult, it was barely more than a crawl space with low ceiling and mould. She had to hang her head to walk in, trying to locate obstacles in the dark for the only source of light was from the long narrow windows near the ceiling.</p><p>The unsoftened echo of her footsteps on the floor made of timber brought on a claustrophobic feeling, and so she put the books and magazines in the corner to hurry back to the ladder as fast as she could.</p><p>Right before she reached the entrance, Y/N tripped over a small table and almost lost her balance. But she didn&rsquo;t fall, instead she knocked over a dusty carton box which fell onto the floor and created a loud thump that echoed within the confined space. Dust flying all over the place got the girl coughing uncontrollably, still she decided to bend down and clean up the mess she&rsquo;d made.</p><p>The first thing that got her attention was a portrait of her younger self, sketched by her mother. Everything in that box belonged to her mother. Most of them were drawings and souvenirs she&rsquo;d bought on their family trips. Y/N had no idea how long they&rsquo;d been in this attic, but judging from the yellow hue of the paper, she would guess that they had been there since her mother was still alive.</p><p>As a result, Y/N ended up staying in the attic for longer than she&rsquo;d intended to. She sat on the floor, going through the rest of the stuff in the box, feeling whole inside for the fact that most of her mother&rsquo;s sketches were of her face, some others were corners of their house and random objects like a tea set, a bowl of fruits, a flower vase,&hellip;</p><p>There wasn&rsquo;t anything unusual, until&hellip;<i>there was</i>.</p><p>At the bottom of the box lied a little tin box. The girl almost didn&rsquo;t see it for it was hidden too well. For some reason, just looking at it gave her a feeling that there was something inside she had to see.</p><p>With her heart thumping like a drum, she brought it to her lap and carefully opened it. It would&rsquo;ve been a huge disappointment if the box had been empty like she&rsquo;d feared, but her instinct rarely made a mistake. The box contained many letters written to her mother from a man named <i>Dave Hardfield, </i>alongside which was a photo of them together. His lips were on Tam&rsquo;s cheek and Y/N had never seen her mother smile that bright before. At first Y/N assumed the man used to be one of her mother&rsquo;s boyfriends before meeting her dad. However, when she looked at the date on each letter, she discovered the truth that&rsquo;d been hidden for all those years. Those letters, <i>love letters</i> to be exact, had all been written and sent when her parents were married already.</p><p>Y/N found out, to her dismay, there were worse fears than invisible monsters in the attic, it was the ones living within every person including the ones you thought you knew all too well.</p><p>She picked up one of the letters to read through the first few lines just to make sure she didn&rsquo;t draw any conclusion way too soon. But what she learnt wasn&rsquo;t what her heart wished it&rsquo;d be. Her mother had been in love, <i>madly</i> in love, but with another man, <i>not</i> her father.</p><p>She felt a lump in her throat when she read the part about them planning on leaving this town once the divorce had been settled. That letter came just a week before the accident.</p><p>The grip of her hands tightened, nearly tearing the page in two. She was so in shock that her brain stuttered for a moment and breathing became difficult. It took her a while to come back to her sense and gather everything besides the letter to put it back in the tin box before leaving.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t even think as she hurried down the ladder, marching straight to the front door while clutching the letter in her hand. This man, whoever he was, might have the answers to most of the questions she&rsquo;d been asking herself since her mother&rsquo;s death, beginning with what had happened the night of the accident. Y/N walked fast, wasting no time, yet her father appeared without warning to stop her right before she could reach for the doorknob.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; He asked, raising an eyebrow at his daughter, who was quick to hide the letter behind her back.</p><p>&ldquo;To a coffee shop,&rdquo; she said, trying too hard not to let her anxiety show. And maybe she was putting on such a good act that her dad didn&rsquo;t seem to suspect a thing.</p><p>&ldquo;I was hoping you would stay to help us out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will when I get back. Promise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not so fast, young lady.&rdquo; Bradford cleared his throat loudly as he clutched her by the arm when she barely managed to escape. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting strange. Are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo;</p><p>That reply was followed by the fakest laugh she&rsquo;d ever pulled. Even she knew that, how could her father not?</p><p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;&rdquo; The man paused to decide if he should make a guess. It wasn&rsquo;t really a guess since he already knew the truth. It was because of Harry. She&rsquo;d been crying for that boy and hurting for that boy, like she had most of her life. It was obvious. But then again, Bradford pretended like he had no clue. His daughter had never been a sentimental person, not openly at least. Maybe it was one thing they both had in common.</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind&hellip;&rdquo; He sighed, twitching his lips. &ldquo;Be back soon, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Smiling in return, Y/N gave her father a firm nod. &ldquo;Hey dad, can I borrow your car?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. But don&rsquo;t crash it.&rdquo;</p><p>It was meant to be a harmless joke. But as both of them came to realization, they just quietly stared at each other for two seconds long. Bradford handed her his car key, stuttering as he wanted to say something to lighten up the mood. Unfortunately, Y/N didn&rsquo;t hesitate to walk out of the door.</p><p>The truth was, she had no plan at all. She just knew she was going to see the man named Dave Hardfield, whose address was on the letters sent to her mum. She didn&rsquo;t even have the script of the things she should say, or the list of questions about everything she was dying to know. She just wanted to go see the man to learn the truth, whatever it was, even when she wasn&rsquo;t ready to hear it from a complete stranger.</p><p>Funny how one surprise came right after another without a single break. The last person Y/N would expect to show up in Holmes Chapel right now, was waiting right outside her house by his car.</p><p>&ldquo;Isaac?&rdquo; She gasped, walking fast towards the man whose smile was as bright as the sun when he saw her face. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was worried about you. Wanted to make sure you were alright.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&hellip;drove all the way here from London&hellip;to see me?&rdquo;</p><p>He took a deep breath, letting it all out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna tell me I&rsquo;m stupid for doing this, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>To his surprise, she shook her head fast and pulled him into a hug so tight that it almost took his breath away, <i>literally</i>. Y/N didn&rsquo;t seem to care as she kept repeating the words &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; into his shoulder, leaving him no choice but to also wrap his arms around her.</p><p>It finally occurred to her how desperate she was for a hug. It didn&rsquo;t matter whose. She just needed to feel a little bit of comfort after the series of traumatic events that&rsquo;d been after her lately. At least with Isaac she knew there was only peace.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Heartward,&rdquo; she said, pulling away but her hands were still resting on his hips. &ldquo;Wanna come with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a town nearby, only an hour drive from here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>Shocked by the answer, she grabbed him by the wrist when he turned back to unlock his car doors.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not gonna ask me why I&rsquo;m going there?&rdquo; She raised both eyebrows, mouth agape. He, on the other hand, looked as cool as ever.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got an hour in the car, right?&rdquo; Isaac said with a beam as he opened the door on the passenger side for Y/N.</p><p>Now she felt the need to hug him again for she didn&rsquo;t think she could ever repay his kindness. In order to save time, however, she&rsquo;d probably save that later. If they didn&rsquo;t get going right away, they wouldn&rsquo;t be back soon enough for her dad to not suspect a thing.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; She exclaimed with a bright smile, watching Isaac shake his head as he laughed before getting into the vehicle as well.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>For most of her life, Y/N had lived in Holmes Chapel and hadn&rsquo;t realized until now that she&rsquo;d never gone any further than her neighborhood. This was her first journey to a different town in Cheshire. As turned out, it was a lot different from her own. The streets here were narrower and the houses were smaller. While Holmes Chapel had always been simple, Heartward was a maze with the labyrinth of roads, as complex as the human heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you nervous?&rdquo; Isaac&rsquo;s voice pulled Y/N&rsquo;s attention away from the window, back on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo; She snorted, inhaling deeply to let the silence sink back in for a couple seconds before speaking up again. &ldquo;What type of person do you think he is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably kind. I mean, your mother was kind.&rdquo;</p><p>The answer made the girl chuckle as she lifted an eyebrow. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t even know my mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you,&rdquo; he said, his blue eyes sparked with joy.</p><p>In that instant, Y/N felt warm within and she was glad he&rsquo;d shown up at her door. She would still be freaking out right now if she&rsquo;d gone alone. It was rather funny how she&rsquo;d been his damsel in distress countless of times ever since they first met. Sometimes she did think about it and wondered how he still felt about her after everything. Was he nice to the others too or her only? If the latter was the case, then there was another reason for her to believe she didn&rsquo;t deserve someone like him.</p><p>The smile grew on Y/N&rsquo;s face as she watched Isaac&rsquo;s face screw up while he was concentrating on the road ahead. That same smile, sadly, died out the second he brought up the name she&rsquo;d tried to erase from memory.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you talked to Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N gave Isaac a shrug, turning back to the window on her side. &ldquo;I will&hellip;at some point.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t ask any further, thank god for that. The last thing she wanted was for him to figure out what had really happened between her and Harry. Though she no longer felt the pressure to reveal her sexual relationship with him to Isaac or anyone else for that matter, she was still afraid what Isaac might think of her if somehow he found out. Honestly, she felt <i>cheap</i>. Even though her feelings for Harry had always been true, to him she was just a replacement, nothing but a body to get him through the night while his heart stayed missing somebody else. But that was exactly what she&rsquo;d signed up for, so she shouldn&rsquo;t be bitter now that it didn&rsquo;t end the way she wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;Speaking of the devil,&rdquo; the girl muttered under her breath when a couple texts from <b>H</b> popped up on her screen.</p><p>&ldquo;Read it,&rdquo; Isaac said, his eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;He must worry about you a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>Little did he knew, Y/N did want to. She <i>really</i> wanted to.</p><p>Harry had called her a hundred times since this morning and she&rsquo;d fought herself from answering those calls. Maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt if she only read his texts and not reply to them. Nodding in response to Isaac&rsquo;s words, she eventually opened those messages.</p><p>&#9010;<b> H: </b><i>If you get this, please text me back.</i></p><p>&#9010; <b>H:</b><i> Let me know you&rsquo;re safe.</i></p><p>&#9010; <b>H:</b> <i>Please call me back, text me, anything.</i></p><p>&#9010; <b>H:</b> <i>I need to talk to you please.</i></p><p>&ldquo;So? How&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N turned off her phone and put it away as she also turned a deaf ear to Isaac&rsquo;s question.</p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told him where I am, right?&rdquo; She asked in concern, only to sigh in relief when he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;If I had, he would be here instead of me.&rdquo; With a slight chuckle, he added, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re really good at ghosting on people, Smiley.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only the ones who deserve it.&rdquo;</p><p>When Y/N received no reply, she turned to see the a goofy grin on the man&rsquo;s face.</p><p>Pinching his lip slightly, Isaac kept his eyes on the road rather on her as he joked, &ldquo;if I hadn&rsquo;t texted you when I was in Italy, we would never have spoken again, right?&rdquo;</p><p>She knew he wasn&rsquo;t serious when he said that, but his expression alone could still pain her heart. A sense of guilt flooded into her hollow chest to replace the comfort she&rsquo;d been feeling this entire time in the car with him. Isaac was too nice to admit that she had hurt him too for coldly turning him down once before. She&rsquo;d been too busy paying attention to how she was feeling and forgotten about him. Why was he still here after everything? Why was he still treating her like the only person in the world who mattered? Why hadn&rsquo;t he asked for anything in return?</p><p>&ldquo;Isaac&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! We&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; The man happily announced as he slowed down and pulled his car over on the side of the road. She wasn&rsquo;t sure if he cut her off on purpose or he genuinely didn&rsquo;t hear her. But maybe this wasn&rsquo;t the time to talk about them.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure this is the place?&rdquo; She asked in disbelief when they both got out of the car at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;It is. I&rsquo;ve checked the address twice,&rdquo; he assured, yet looking just as appalled as she was.</p><p>The house they were looking for was square and grey, with narrow windows that looked far from picturesque. Y/N had to check the address for the third time to make sure it matched the one on the letter. This place looked like it&rsquo;d been abandoned for years. Maybe the owner didn&rsquo;t really care to pay enough attention to making his front yard and porch look even the slightest presentable.</p><p>Exchanging worrying looks with Isaac, she finally found enough courage to press the doorbell. She wasn&rsquo;t sure if anybody was home because through the windows all that she saw was a part of the pitch dark living room as far as natural light could reach.</p><p>Fortunately, just when the two of them thought they might have to leave empty handed, the door slowly creaked open.</p><p>Y/N had never met this man in her life, but his expression when he saw her made her think he had known her his entire life. His face was stern, yet peaceful. And even though his hair was turning grey and the wrinkles were slightly visible on his broad forehead, he still appeared quite handsome for a man his age.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; Y/N spoke after two awkward seconds passing by unnoticed. &ldquo;Are you&hellip;<i>Dave Hardfield</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo; The middle-aged man nodded, his eyes were still round as he stared at her in confusion. &ldquo;You are&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Y/N, Tam&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; she said, handing him the envelope she&rsquo;d been holding the entire time. &ldquo;I found your letter in my attic, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>That sentence was left unfinished when Dave opened his arms and dragged her into a hug without warning. Isaac flinched, nearly pulling Y/N back for he feared the man might do something to her, but the moment he spotted the hopeful look on Dave&rsquo;s face, he decided to stay back and remain silent.</p><p>&ldquo;You look just like her.&rdquo;</p><p>Those words from the stranger made Y/N&rsquo;s eyes well up when he loosened his embrace to cup her face. He examined her features, eyes glistened with tears as a smile spread across his chapped lips.</p><p>&ldquo;She has the same beautiful eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow&hellip;that&rsquo;s very&hellip;nice of you. Thank you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Isaac couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle at Y/N&rsquo;s reply, receiving a playful glare when she turned back to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in, you two! come in!&rdquo; Dave said fast, giving Y/N and Isaac no time to hesitate before urging them into his living room. When the door was shut, and the lights were on, Y/N saw the living proof of the saying &rsquo;<i>never judge a book by its cover</i>&rsquo;. The interior was the opposite of the mess she&rsquo;d seen when she first arrived &mdash; tidy and very well-taken care of.</p><p>Dave&rsquo;s living room gave away more than it was supposed to. Every decoration was soft and homely, showing the fact that he probably lived alone. In order to fill the void, he had created a cozy place that made him feel safe and warm so he would&rsquo;t have to come home to remember how lonely he was. Y/N would know that better than anyone.</p><p>Above the fireplace were pictures of him with his children, she assumed, for they were arranged from the left when his twins were babies to the latest one on the right being the three of them together at the girls&rsquo; graduation. There was no photo of the wife.</p><p>Dave sat down on his chair and pointed to the sofa in front of him, telling his two guests to make themselves at home. There was already a tea set on the table, so he made two cups for Y/N and Isaac, saying that he&rsquo;d already had his before they arrived.</p><p>&ldquo;So Y/N, is this your boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Y/N blushed hard when she caught Isaac&rsquo;s stare and turned away quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Isaac, I&rsquo;m her friend from London,&rdquo; said the young man as he reached out to shake Dave&rsquo;s hand, showing his signature Prince Charming smirk. How could anyone not go soft for that?</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, how do you like Holmes Chapel so far, son?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To be honest, I&rsquo;ve been in Heartward for longer than Holmes Chapel.&rdquo; He chuckled, glancing at Y/N who furrowed her eyebrows at him. &ldquo;This one literally dragged me here when I first arrived at her house.&rdquo;</p><p>She pushed his shoulder playfully, laughing along. &ldquo;In my defense, I did ask if he wanted to come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The things we do for these ladies, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Dave&rsquo;s comment made Isaac chuckle, but Y/N had already turned away to hide the fact that she was all flustered.</p><p>As the young people enjoyed their tea, the older man took his own letter out of the envelope, smiling nonchalantly at the memories while rereading what he&rsquo;d written two years ago.</p><p>Y/N gave him a moment to get lost in his happy thoughts before breaking the silence among the three of them. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s true&hellip;you and my mother&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The man&rsquo;s beam slowly turned into a frown as he sighed heavily, putting the letter back into its envelope.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he confessed, eyes locked with the girl who still seemed in denial even though she&rsquo;d known the truth ever since she first read his letter. Her mother, a cheater? The woman she&rsquo;d looked up to her entire life turned out to be that kind of person? It didn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p><p>&ldquo;We were in love,&rdquo; Dave went on despite the look on her face. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t something I was proud of, to fall head over heels for a married woman. But&hellip;I guess we never get to choose whom we fall in love with.&rdquo;</p><p>Isaac&rsquo;s eyes were on Y/N, yet hers were fixed on the man who was speaking. She didn&rsquo;t know how to feel anymore. Should she hate this man for ruining her parents&rsquo; marriage just like how she had hated Marcy for thinking it was her? The problem was, she couldn&rsquo;t grow to hate him, not even the tiniest bit.</p><p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; Dave asked, eyes squinting at Y/N.</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; He sucked in a breath and rubbed his palms together nervously. &ldquo;You were fifteen when I met her. Can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been five years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Were you married at the time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. My ex-wife left me when my girls were only six. They barely remember her.&rdquo;</p><p>The look on his face was heartbreaking still.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Y/N as she wetted her dry lips. &ldquo;Uhm&hellip;where are your children now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re both living in California with their husbands. I&rsquo;m very proud of them,&rdquo; he said with a huge grin. That was enough to tell how much his children meant to him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just four years older than you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re the same age as you!&rdquo; Y/N told Isaac, who responded with a slight laugh for how excited she seemed to discover the coincidence.</p><p>&ldquo;When the girls left home, I was devastated,&rdquo; Dave continued with a sad smile, looking at them both. &ldquo;Tam was the best thing to happen to me at the time. I believe I was also hers. She was unhappy in her marriage, yet she couldn&rsquo;t leave because&hellip;she didn&rsquo;t want to force you to choose between her and your father.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N stayed silent, nodding her head slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;The day of the accident, he found out about us and they got into a fight.&rdquo; His voice grew smaller and weaker as he recalled the tragic event that took away the woman he loved. &ldquo;When I received the news, my whole world fell apart. Even now&hellip;I still blame myself for what happened to her. If I&rsquo;d just given up and let her go, maybe she would still be here.&rdquo;</p><p>So that was how it&rsquo;d happened. Her mother&rsquo;s affair was the reason there&rsquo;d been a fight. That was why she&rsquo;d given her father back the ring and drove away from the damage she&rsquo;d caused. <i>That</i> was the truth &mdash; a hard pill to swallow.</p><p>&ldquo;But you made her happier than my father did&hellip;&rdquo; She spoke after a moment sinking deep in her own thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip;don&rsquo;t hate me?&rdquo; Dave seemed surprised by her reaction. It was certainly not what he&rsquo;d expected.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The girl shook her head. &ldquo;At least now I know she was truly loved. So&hellip;thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Dave didn&rsquo;t say anything else. Y/N didn&rsquo;t ask either. They exchanged heartwarming smiles, and Isaac reached out to hold the hand on her lap, giving her a look that said he was there for her if she wanted emotional support. Maybe that was she needed to feel at peace again.</p><p>The drive home was strangely comforting for all the secrets had been revealed, and what was left was just bare relief. Staring out of the car window, Y/N recorded the last images of Heartward into her mind like a goodbye to the little town. Then she began to wonder how many times her mother had driven down that same road, or if she had remembered the map of Heartward like the back of her hand. Maybe Heartward was her mother&rsquo;s London, the place that wasn&rsquo;t really home, but there lived the man whom her heart would always belong to.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo; The girl chuckled slightly as she watched Isaac stand with his back against the car, one hand still holding hers. Now that she was home safe and he knew that she was safe. She wondered what would happen next. Would they say their goodbyes and he go back to London, maybe back to Italy even?</p><p>The problem was, now she didn&rsquo;t want him to go.</p><p>&ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re okay?&rdquo; He raised both eyebrows, making her toss her head back and crack up.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, how many times do I have to tell you that I am?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, alright, just wanted to be sure,&rdquo; he said, grinning from ear to ear and checking his watch.</p><p>Y/N studied his expression closely, wishing she could ask him to stay, a part of her was still reluctant that she might&rsquo;ve troubled him too much already. Nevertheless, it wasn&rsquo;t her to decide what happened next.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo;</i></p><p>The loud voice caused both Isaac and Y/N to let go of each other&rsquo;s hands as they turned to her front door. Her father rushed towards them, followed by Marcy. Both seemed so distressed that Y/N thought it was quite hilarious.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;ve only been gone for a couple hours.&rdquo;</p><p>Isaac chuckled as he watched the girl trying to break away from her father&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>&ldquo;The car was here and you were gone, so I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I got kidnapped by the ice-cream man?&rdquo; She laughed, holding him by the arms. It was then that Marcy finally noticed the handsome young man standing right behind her future stepdaughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She squealed happily. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your friend, Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Isaac, Y/N&rsquo;s friend from London. You must be the bride.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; The woman shook his hand enthusiastically, giving him a massive smile. &ldquo;Hey, why don&rsquo;t you stay for our wedding? A friend of Y/N&rsquo;s is a friend of ours!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma'am. But I&rsquo;m only here for today. I&rsquo;m leaving now actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like to stay though?&rdquo;</p><p>All eyes were on Y/N when she asked that question. She couldn&rsquo;t really blame them for even she didn&rsquo;t believe in her own words. Her cheeks instantly turned red as she was sure Isaac noticed how shy she was. His smile grew a bit wider.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay for the wedding?&rdquo; He questioned, probably just wanting her to say it again.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; She nodded fast, eyes to the side instead of looking at him. &ldquo;Uhm&hellip;I do need a wedding date.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, but I thought Har&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea!&rdquo; Bradford cut his bride off just in time as he stepped forward to pat the young man on the back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe to drive back to London through the night. Come in, we&rsquo;ll have the guest room ready for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not formally dressed for the wedding&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that. It&rsquo;s just gonna be a family party,&rdquo; Bradford said, rolling his eyes. &ldquo;Besides, you cannot miss an opportunity to see Y/N in a pink dress for the first time since she decided that adolescent angst suited her personality better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; Y/N cried out, causing the other three to dissolve into laughter. Hiding her face with one hand, she sneaked a look at Isaac, who couldn&rsquo;t stop beaming at this point. There was something about the radiant joy on his face that made her feel calm. Holding back a laugh, she watched Marcy pull him into their house.</p><p>Marcy was still baking for the wedding tomorrow, and since she had to do it all on her own, she was thrilled to bits when Isaac offered his help.</p><p>&ldquo;I used to help my mum in the kitchen all the time,&rdquo; said the young man. That was enough to convince her that he was qualified to be the Executive Sous Chef in her kitchen. Bradford intended to join them as well, but Y/N stopped him right before he could volunteer to lend a hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, can we talk in private?&rdquo; She asked, holding onto his arm.</p><p>In this household, they rarely discussed their conflicts and problems, just like old furniture, they put those in a dark corner and pretended they didn&rsquo;t exist until someone suddenly remembered they were still there. But look at what all these secrets they&rsquo;d kept from each other had turned them into? A broken family. They had never been truly happy under the same roof. From now on, something had to change.</p><p>Bradford followed his daughter upstairs to her room where their conversation couldn&rsquo;t be heard. When she asked him to sit down in her chair and shut the door, he knew it was something serious. So serious that someone who had avoided every single heart-to-heart talk in her life like Y/N must initiate this conversation.</p><p>Without further ado, she sat down on the edge of her bed and handed him the letter from Dave Hardfield. Judging by the look on his face, she knew he had never expected her to find out like this, if at all.</p><p>&ldquo;I came to see him today,&rdquo; she spoke at last, tearing down the silence which was only tormenting them both. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I found out about this the day before your graduation, darling. And the accident came right after. This news would&rsquo;ve broken you even more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about after the funeral? What about when I moved to London? You&rsquo;d had so many chances to tell me,&rdquo; she stated. The tears in her eyes were inevitable yet it still hurt him to see her cry. He didn&rsquo;t need to know she&rsquo;d been holding them back since the moment she found those letters in the attic. He didn&rsquo;t need to know what the other man had said to her. All he knew was his little girl had been through so much only to find out the truth about her mother from a stranger.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want you to hate her for this.&rdquo;</p><p>His answer left a lump in her throat as she swallowed her tears and narrowed her eyes at him.</p><p>&ldquo;So you just let me hate you instead?&rdquo;</p><p>When he nodded, her heart nearly cracked open.</p><p>&ldquo;She was a better parent than I am,&rdquo; he said with his head hung low. &ldquo;You used to tell her everything. I can&rsquo;t-I don&rsquo;t remember the last time we sat down and talked like this. Everything I know about you, your mother told me. The bond you two had was so strong, and you looked up to her so much, I couldn&rsquo;t take that idea of her away from you. I wanted you to always think about her as a role model so you would always have a reason to never give up.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N was speechless. She pressed her lips tight and could only nod fast to replace the words she couldn&rsquo;t come up with right now. Bradford scooted his chair closer so he could take her hand and hold it tight, meanwhile wiping away the tears rolling down her flushed cheeks, what he should&rsquo;ve done years ago.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you&hellip;did you ever love her?&rdquo; Her voice trembled as if it was going to break anytime soon.</p><p>&ldquo;I did. I still do,&rdquo; he admitted, his eyes now glistened with tears. &ldquo;My biggest regret was not appreciating her presence in my life. I didn&rsquo;t treat her right because I thought she would always be around, until she wasn&rsquo;t anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;did you hate her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The father shook his head. &ldquo;And I hope you won&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;</p><p>She looked at him through the tears, subconsciously reaching up to touch the locket lying close to her heart which was now racing faster than ever. Letting out a shaky breath, she said, &ldquo;what she did cannot change the fact that she loved me, and she was the nicest person I knew. How can I ever stop loving her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p><p>That one-word reply was so simple yet just enough. It was heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time how they both cried and wiped away each other&rsquo;s tears only to smile again. This was the closest Y/N had ever been to feeling fulfill.</p><p>When she was little, every time her parents fought, she used to wished for a better family with perfect parents who never argued. But maybe this was the best she could get. At least now she knew her imperfect family could finally be a happy one.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Brad!&rdquo;</i> Marcy&rsquo;s voice from downstairs made Bradford and Y/N turn to the door. <i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think you can get away with not helping me!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go.&rdquo; Y/N chuckled as she rose from the bed. But before she could reach the door, Bradford stopped her by the words he hadn&rsquo;t said in too long.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N couldn&rsquo;t keep track on how many nights she&rsquo;d lost sleep over those three words. She had faced the fear that she might not get to hear them back. She had faced the <i>reality</i> that she <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> get to hear them back. To hear them now from the man she thought she should hate most in her life had filled the empty space inside her chest, even if temporarily.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, too,&rdquo; she said almost as a whisper but loud enough for her father to hear. Without waiting for a reaction from him, she rushed into his arms, hugging him for the first time since she was just a little girl.</p><p>Now that she was older, she must accept the fact that her parents weren&rsquo;t heroes and she might not really know the people she&rsquo;d always thought she knew. However, true love was constant. The love for her mother, for Harry, would always be there, no matter what kind of people they turned out to be or what secrets they&rsquo;d kept from her. Just like herself, she knew they had their own pain so she couldn&rsquo;t blame them for their mistakes.</p><p>She might not replicate what she had lost. She wasn&rsquo;t sure anyone could ever fill the shoes of her mother or <i>him</i>. But some love could only be beautiful if kept in memory. Thus from now on, she was willing to let them both go.</p><p><i>.</i></p><p><i>.</i></p><p><i>.</i></p><p>&ldquo;So, this photo was taken on her first day of kindergarten.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Brad! Look at her cute pigtails! I can&rsquo;t believe you never showed me this before!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N sat on the armchair facing the other three on the sofa opposite from her. They had their noses stuck the family photo album. It was like a game to see who could spot the most embarrassing photo of her as a child. Apparently, her dad was winning.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you guys all done?&rdquo; She asked, arms crossed in front of her chest as her face contorted, but nobody flinched.</p><p>&ldquo;Aww, the Donald Duck Halloween costume.&rdquo; Isaac chuckled. He tried to ignore her, yet couldn&rsquo;t help but glance up to catch a glimpse of the look on her face as she scoffed in response to his comment.</p><p>When Y/N picked out a daisy in front of her and tossed it at him, Marcy wasted no time to grab the vase, holding it firmly against her chest.</p><p>&ldquo;The whatever you want, just don&rsquo;t hurt my flowers!&rdquo; She said.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, the fun&rsquo;s over!&rdquo; Y/N rose from her seat to grab the photo album and put it aside. With both hands on her hips, she lifted an eyebrow at the men. &ldquo;Chop chop. Get back to work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; Isaac and Bradford said at the same time as they hurried back to the tasks they&rsquo;d been assigned before getting distracted by those photos.</p><p>Bradford stood up so Y/N could take his place next to Isaac and continue arranging those wedding flowers for Marcy. Meanwhile, the father kept on looking for that cook book he hadn&rsquo;t seen in years, only because Marcy&rsquo;s parents expected him to cook for them tomorrow night. He was just about to head upstairs and search in his room, when his phone began to ring.</p><p>It was Harry.</p><p>The man had hesitated for a long moment before picking up that call. He didn&rsquo;t want to see Y/N&rsquo;s reaction if she caught him speaking to Harry. Even so, he still wanted to know what had happened between them, knowing she would refuse to confide in him, or anyone for that matter.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; He finally answered, keeping his voice down so his family couldn&rsquo;t hear.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Is Bambi, I mean, Y/N&hellip;Is </i><i>Y/N</i><i> there, sir? If she is, can you get her on the phone?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Bradford had known Harry since he was little, and he knew Harry was a good person by nature. However, after seeing the pain his daughter had endured, he now must pick a side.</p><p>Sitting in his living room was the man who made his daughter laugh, on the phone was the one who made her cry. The choice should be fast and simple, yet there was utter guilt within his heart when he decided to keep Harry from the truth.</p><p>&ldquo;She went out a while ago,&rdquo; he lied, his heart fell to silence as a long pause followed right after.</p><p><i>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t wanna talk to me, right?&rdquo; </i>The sadness was clear in Harry&rsquo;s voice when he finally spoke.</p><p>Even though Bradford had no idea Isaac was Harry&rsquo;s best friend, he was aware that Harry&rsquo;s heart would be crushed if he found out Y/N was laughing with another man on the sofa, and the same man would accompany her to the wedding tomorrow. The father had no other choice but to be frank, &ldquo;I think you should wait until after the wedding, when she returns to London. You know, give her time.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was quiet for a while, as if to ponder on his own.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sir&hellip;do you think she still hates me?&rdquo;</i></p><p>For this question, the older man took a deep breath. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Y/N that well, but she can never hate you.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I know I would if I were her.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N always says things she doesn&rsquo;t mean. I thought you would know that better than anyone else.&rdquo; Bradford chuckled slightly. &ldquo;She said she hated you when you left the first time, yet she still sent you those letters.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Letters?&rdquo;</i> Harry sounded like he almost choked on the word. <i>&ldquo;What letters?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;You never received any? That&rsquo;s odd&hellip;She used to check our mailbox everyday, and her mother once told me that she&rsquo;d been writing to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Bradford waited, yet the reply what came after was nothing but silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo; He mumbled, assuming something was wrong with the phone and the young man couldn&rsquo;t hear him well, until Harry cleared his throat and said that he was still listening, he must hang up now regardless.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Can you please ask her to call me back?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry&rsquo;s plea for help sounded so desperate. Now Bradford could only feel sorry for the boy. He looked over his shoulder, into the living room. Y/N and Isaac had long forgotten that they were supposed to be arranging the wedding flowers. They were too busy fooling around by putting daisies in each other&rsquo;s hair while guffawing like children. Seeing the beam on his daughter&rsquo;s face, Bradford was able to empathize with Harry. It definitely wasn&rsquo;t easy to remember how much you loved someone only when came someone else who wiped away their tears and made them smile again.</p><p>&ldquo;Take my advice,&rdquo; the father spoke with a soft reminiscent sigh, turning his back to Y/N and Isaac. &ldquo;Some things are not meant to be said on the phone.&rdquo;</p><p>The two-second pause on Harry&rsquo;s part made Bradford believe his guess was right all along. What Harry wanted to say were the three words that had started this whole mess, and Y/N deserved to hear them in person.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; </i>the young man spoke at last. <i>&ldquo;Thank you so much.&rdquo;</i> And just like that, he muttered his goodbye.</p><p>The call ended with a sense of sorrowful regret, leaving Bradford standing still with messy thoughts flowing through his mind. It was Y/N&rsquo;s voice that pulled him back to reality.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, who was it?&rdquo;</p><p>Turning his head fast, the man locked eyes with his daughter&rsquo;s. For a second, it was Tam that he saw staring back at him, and in that instant he realized how much Y/N resembled her late mother.</p><p>&ldquo;Was it him?&rdquo; Her eyebrows furrowed when he nodded his head as an answer. What was the use of lying when she already knew the truth?</p><p>&ldquo;You should call him back,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;He wanted to talk to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t wanna talk to him.&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s answer turned the man speechless. He parted his lips, yet she was quick to cut him off before he even figured out what else to say. &ldquo;If he calls again, tell him he doesn&rsquo;t have to feel sorry&hellip;It was also my fault for expecting too much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Darling, it&rsquo;s not your f&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell him I won&rsquo;t call him back.&rdquo; Y/N interrupted her father once again. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s really no point in torturing each other anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>From the look in her expressive eyes, the man understood that his daughter was badly hurt by those words of her own, yet she must say them otherwise she could never truly move on.</p><p>In silence, he watched her go back to the living room where Marcy was now instructing Isaac how to arrange those daisies. Even though he respected Y/N&rsquo;s decision, Bradford knew, just like him, a small part of her still wished it was Harry instead.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was quite a wrench to Harry when that call came to an end and he hadn&rsquo;t got to hear her voice. The director got real mad at him for being distracted during filming and checking his phone way too often. Harry made up an excuse that he was just tired, yet none of the people he worked with was convinced. It&rsquo;d been the worst day in his life ever since she left.</p><p>On the drive home, he couldn&rsquo;t stop replaying the conversation with one of his co-stars, who said,<i> &ldquo;I feel like this isn&rsquo;t what you love anymore.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He&rsquo;d thought about that sentence a lot before coming to the conclusion that the man who&rsquo;d said it was completely wrong. This had nothing to do with him being lazy or losing motivation since acting was what he was born to do. He loved his job, and was indeed grateful for all that he had now. But there were also the other things that he loved, one of which was her.</p><p>Now she was 185 miles away from him. And he couldn&rsquo;t even get her on the phone just to explain why he&rsquo;d hesitated to admit that he loved her, to apologize and <i>beg</i> for another chance. He knew he couldn&rsquo;t make it back to the wedding because he&rsquo;d got a commercial to shoot tomorrow morning, and he couldn&rsquo;t wait until after because it&rsquo;d be too long. But maybe her father was right, words would sound much more sincere if they were said in person.</p><p>There was, however, something else that was bothering him. Bradford had mentioned those letters she&rsquo;d written to him when she was younger. At first he&rsquo;d assumed they all had got lost in the mail, yet it seemed too much of a coincidence to be true, unless the universe really didn&rsquo;t want him to read them.</p><p>What if she&rsquo;d never sent those letters? If so, where were they now?</p><p>Harry was too lost in the questions for himself that he almost didn&rsquo;t recognize his assistant who was waiting for him outside his house. The girl had to call out his name to get his attention as he walked right past her.</p><p>&ldquo;Jo? What are you doing here so late?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jeff said you had a rough day on set so he asked me to buy you dinner,&rdquo; said the short brunette as she fixed her glasses and handed the food to her boss. &ldquo;And Miss Ruby Ellis called me a couple times today asking to talk to you, but I told her you were busy. Do you want me to set up a date&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; he cut her off fast, pressing his lips into a small smile. &ldquo;Next time just ignore her calls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;Okay&hellip;One more thing!&rdquo; The girl stopped her boss when he unlocked his door. &ldquo;I brought your laundry into your room and accidentally knocked over the books on your nightstand. I already put them back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jo, you don&rsquo;t have to report everything to me,&rdquo; Harry replied as he chuckled, assuming the girl was new to her job so she was just overly careful.</p><p>Jo shook her head quickly. &ldquo;I was afraid that you would see the books in a different place and think I got intrusive and read your journal or something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My journal?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, the pink notebook with your name at the back.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes went wide as realization hit him like a fast-moving train. He thanked his assistant, saying a fast goodbye before rushing into his house. The first thing he did was run to his bedroom and get Y/N&rsquo;s notebook.</p><p>She&rsquo;d had it since she was nine. He always knew she wrote a lot in there, including her random thoughts, her favorite quotes, her story ideas, almost everything she could come up with; some she&rsquo;d read to him, some she&rsquo;d kept to herself. But he never actually got to read for himself.</p><p>If she was writing letters that she never planned on sending, would there be a better place to keep them?</p><p>Harry felt awful as he brought the pink notebook to his lap and sat down on the bed, inhaling deeply. He wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone to read his most deepest and personal thoughts, surely she wouldn&rsquo;t be happy to find out that he wanted to read hers. He was going to anyway. Desperation had got the best of him.</p><p>With trembling hand, he flipped to the back of the notebook, and immediately spotted his name written in small capital letters at the bottom corner of the hard cover. Harry didn&rsquo;t know why he was smiling as he gently ran his thumb over the word. He missed her too much that such a small detail could make his heart flutter.</p><p>After contemplating it for a whole minute, he took another deep breath and opened it for the first time.</p><p><i>Here goes nothing</i>, said his inner voice.</p><p>The first page, which he&rsquo;d seen once before, was filled with silly doodles made by a nine-year-old, hence they weren&rsquo;t pretty. He still remembered the day she showed him these and got mad when he made fun of her for her awful drawing skill. The memory made Harry chuckle as he turned to the second page where lied the very first entry. The ink was slightly faded due to all the years it&rsquo;d lived by. Her handwriting used to be so easy to read.</p><p>On the first line right below the date, she wrote:</p><p><i>My definition of true happiness is the boy next door. His name is Harry Styles.</i></p></p>",

The bride-to-be was probably influenced by their family tradition &mdash; in this house, they never threw away old things, instead they either tried to fix them or hid them somewhere in case they might need them again. Most of those things ended up in the attic.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do it yourself?

All the people she wanted to be with were now far away. The only thing she could do was drive around town or bring a book to a coffee shop in her neighborhood to read the day away.</p>\n<p>Marcy only gave Y/N a smile, ignoring the lame excuse as she insisted, &ldquo;I would, but I&rsquo;m allergic to dust.
