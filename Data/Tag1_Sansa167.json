        "body": "<p>So I just wanted to jot down some of my thoughts on Sansa\u2019s relationships with her siblings.\u00a0</p><p>In Season 1/Book1, her relationship with Arya is that of rival siblings who don\u2019t get along. A lot of people notice that Sansa is closer to their mother and Arya feels left out, and often feels as though her mother is trying to force her into a role of a lady and to be more like Sansa. She obviously has a closer relationship to her father, in comparison, who encouraged her to be herself. Where Arya feels like she\u2019s left out from a relationship with her mother, Sansa feels like she\u2019s left out from a relationship with her father. Both children love their parents and are loved in turn, but their parents have made it sort of obvious that they understand and get along with one child more than the other. Sansa idealizes her mother, and tries to imitate her, and expects Arya to do the same since they are both the same gender. However, Arya idealizes her father, and resists conforming to societal expectations.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s important to note that they are children. Sansa is 11-12 depending on books or seasons, when we meet her, and Arya is 9-10. We are introduced to Sansa through Arya\u2019s perspective, and since she\u2019s such a lovable character, we automatically see Sansa as her antithesis, since they are such opposites. But BOTH are bratty kids. Sansa is snobby, and Arya is rebellious. Neither wants to understand the other.\u00a0</p><p>Her relationship with her other siblings is easier: She is closer to Robb, or as close as she can be to her brothers, and she is an older sibling to Bran and Rickon, without the tension that she has with Arya. She understands that they have different roles in society, and is able to interact with them normally.\u00a0</p><p>Her relationship with Jon is different. Because Jon is her father\u2019s bastard son, and is disliked by Catelyn, Sansa imitates this behavior to some degree. She knows her mother doesn\u2019t like Jon, and at worst, is indifferent with some teasing. Perhaps, if her relationship with her father was stronger/closer like the one he has with Arya, this would have been different. But as it is, Sansa\u2019s education and parenting was basically left up to Catelyn, and Ned is the father who will tell her she looks pretty and that he\u2019ll give her a good husband one day. This is not to say that she didn\u2019t have a relationship with Jon. In the books, we do know that when Jon thinks of Sansa, he remembers that she taught him how to talk to girls and how to dance. So we can think that either they had initially had a good relationship before Sansa understood what a bastard was, and why her mother disliked Jon, or we can think that even while she knew that Jon was a bastard, she sometimes still interacted with him without being bratty. Which isn\u2019t unbelievable.\u00a0</p><p>A lot of people use the situation at the crossings as evidence that Sansa is a bad sibling. On that score, I have only to quote what Ned said to Arya, which was Sansa was put in the position of having to call the prince a liar in front of the king and queen. She was already betrothed to Joffrey, and was trying to set up a rapport with him in some fashion. A lot of criticism is that Sansa fell in love with Joffrey because she wanted to be queen. Well Sansa was a preteen, and I liken her initial behavior with Joffrey as the same as Anna from Frozen when she met Hans for the first time. Her fantasy was finally coming true and her life was finally starting, at least in her mind. Anyways, Sansa is the one who loses the most, as Lady dies &ndash; which incidentally pushes her further from her father and sister since she blames them for her death. Which isn\u2019t entirely unfounded; her father did kill Lady and Arya\u2019s wolf was the one that bit Joffrey. It doesn\u2019t help that Arya blames Sansa for Mycah\u2019s murder (or at least holds Sansa to some level of responsibility &ndash; like the queen and Joffrey and the hound). I want to be super clear when i say that Sansa had nothing to do with that &ndash; Mycah was already run down by the time they were having the meeting with the king.\u00a0</p><p>So at this point we have Sansa\u2019s relationship with her father and sister super distant. Ned can\u2019t bridge the gap because he doesn\u2019t understand how to be a parent to Sansa. He understand\u2019s Arya because they are similar, but Sansa is different. She\u2019s a lady who was raised and influenced by his southern wife and a septa. This doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t Northern. She is very proud of the fact that she understands houses of the north and reading and writing better than her brothers (though Arya is better at math than her). But Sansa prepared for a life in the south. Which is why she puts a lot of effort into repairing her relationship with her fiance. At this point, and actually throughout the entire first book, Ned has said nothing against Joffrey. Sansa is doing what she is meant to be doing.\u00a0</p><p>Now in the books &ndash; not the shows &ndash; Sansa goes to the queen to tell her Ned plans to return them home. She has no idea that Ned went to the queen to tell her he knew about her infidelity. Why would she, Ned didn\u2019t confide in anyone. He hasn\u2019t told her anything besides the fact that she was leaving kingslanding and that the betrothal she has be working on for the past year was over. Going behind her fathers back to tell the queen, while it sounds bad, is equivalent to say asking your friend\u2019s parent if you could stay for a sleepover when your parents already said you can\u2019t. And if you say, well she still shouldn\u2019t have done that, well I want to say again that Ned killed Lady. Those wolves have deep relationships with the Starks. Ned, who claimed to be very close to Robert, did nothing besides a half-hearted attempt at convincing the king to spare her. he didn\u2019t suggest sending her north, he didn\u2019t pack up and leave right away, he didn\u2019t do anything but kill his daughter\u2019s direwolf.\u00a0</p><p>As viewers/readers, we know the Lannisters are bad news. But to a character like Sansa, they aren\u2019t even the ruling family, the Baratheons are. Any fault can be put on Robert\u2019s feet since he is the king. She has no idea that Robert has little say in the going ons of the realm since he\u2019s in so much debt to the Lannisters, and that he\u2019s outnumbered by Lannister men. But the death of Lady is put more a the feet of Robert than Cersei, especially since at this point, Sansa still lives in the fantasy that Queens are supposed to be kind and gracious (and why wouldn\u2019t she think that; her idols are figures like good Queen Alysanne and she hasn\u2019t ever heard of Cersei doing anything bad). It won\u2019t be until Cersei starts showing her true colors that she puts the blame of lady\u2019s death on Cersei.\u00a0</p><p>In Book2-3/Season 2-3, we get a bit more of a glimpse on Sansa\u2019s relationship with Robb. Robb is Sansa\u2019s knight in shining armor. (while we can\u2019t exactly say he started a war for her &ndash; he started a war for their father &ndash; we knows that he continued south because he wanted her back (and he wanted Joffrey off the throne, but it would have been easier to hold the north than lead a campaign south) But she knows that he is fighting a war and that she would return to him if he won. I want to say that i completely understand Robb not giving up Jamie for his sister. He is the king and he has to think about the good of his people before anything else. However, Sansa does see on some level what she\u2019s worth when Robb marries the wrong girl (Talisa/Jeyne). He loses most of his army to marry a woman, rather than risk that army to return his sister to him. Now, Robb (books and shows) is a child. He little more than 15 in the books, 17-18 in the shows. if we can be sympathetic to him for being a kid and making mistakes, we can be understanding to a little girl who was even younger.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame Robb; he had bad advisors, in the books he had plans to go back North and reclaim it from the iron born after the wedding, and in the show, he had plans to take Casterly rock and send men to the North after securing the frey army. But Roose bolton suggested he detour on the way and none of his other advisors, besides telling him he\u2019s an idiot who lost the North, ever really did anything. Sansa doens\u2019t blame her brother either &ndash; in the preview of Winds of Winter, she remarks how young a boy is and says that if her brother was alive he would be that young. She maintains that her brother was her hero, even if he failed.\u00a0</p><p>While George barely mentioned Sansa in the last two books, because of her central role in the show, I have high hopes for Sansa in the coming books.\u00a0</p><p>And those are just some of my thoughts on Sansa\u2019s relationships with her siblings.\u00a0</p>",

She\u2019s a lady who was raised and influenced by his southern wife and a septa. This doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t Northern. She is very proud of the fact that she understands houses of the north and reading and writing better than her brothers (though Arya is better at math than her). But Sansa prepared for a life in the south. Which is why she puts a lot of effort into repairing her relationship with her fiance. At this point, and actually throughout the entire first book, Ned has said nothing against Joffrey. Sansa is doing what she is meant to be doing.\u00a0</p><p>Now in the books \u2013 not the shows \u2013 Sansa goes to the queen to tell her Ned plans to return them home. She has no idea that Ned went to the queen to tell her he knew about her infidelity. Why would she, Ned didn\u2019t confide in anyone. He hasn\u2019t told her anything besides the fact that she was leaving kingslanding and that the betrothal she has be working on for the past year was over. Going behind her fathers back to tell the queen, while it sounds bad, is equivalent to say asking your friend\u2019s parent if you could stay for a sleepover when your parents already said you can\u2019t. And if you say, well she still shouldn\u2019t have done that, well I want to say again that Ned killed Lady. Those wolves have deep relationships with the Starks. Ned, who claimed to be very close to Robert, did nothing besides a half-hearted attempt at convincing the king to spare her. he didn\u2019t suggest sending her north, he didn\u2019t pack up and leave right away, he didn\u2019t do anything but kill his daughter\u2019s direwolf.\u00a0</p><p>As viewers/readers, we know the Lannisters are bad news. But to a character like Sansa, they aren\u2019t even the ruling family, the Baratheons are. Any fault can be put on Robert\u2019s feet since he is the king. She has no idea that Robert has little say in the going ons of the realm since he\u2019s in so much debt to the Lannisters, and that he\u2019s outnumbered by Lannister men. But the death of Lady is put more a the feet of Robert than Cersei, especially since at this point, Sansa still lives in the fantasy that Queens are supposed to be kind and gracious (and why wouldn\u2019t she think that; her idols are figures like good Queen Alysanne and she hasn\u2019t ever heard of Cersei doing anything bad). It won\u2019t be until Cersei starts showing her true colors that she puts the blame of lady\u2019s death on Cersei.\u00a0</p><p>In Book2-3/Season 2-3, we get a bit more of a glimpse on Sansa\u2019s relationship with Robb. Robb is Sansa\u2019s knight in shining armor. (while we can\u2019t exactly say he started a war for her \u2013 he started a war for their father \u2013 we knows that he continued south because he wanted her back (and he wanted Joffrey off the throne, but it would have been easier to hold the north than lead a campaign south) But she knows that he is fighting a war and that she would return to him if he won. I want to say that i completely understand Robb not giving up Jamie for his sister. He is the king and he has to think about the good of his people before anything else. However, Sansa does see on some level what she\u2019s worth when Robb marries the wrong girl (Talisa/Jeyne). He loses most of his army to marry a woman, rather than risk that army to return his sister to him. Now, Robb (books and shows) is a child. He little more than 15 in the books, 17-18 in the shows. if we can be sympathetic to him for being a kid and making mistakes, we can be understanding to a little girl who was even younger.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame Robb; he had bad advisors, in the books he had plans to go back North and reclaim it from the iron born after the wedding, and in the show, he had plans to take Casterly rock and send men to the North after securing the frey army. But Roose bolton suggested he detour on the way and none of his other advisors, besides telling him he\u2019s an idiot who lost the North, ever really did anything. Sansa doens\u2019t blame her brother either \u2013 in the preview of Winds of Winter, she remarks how young a boy is and says that if her brother was alive he would be that young. She maintains that her brother was her hero, even if he failed.\u00a0</p><p>While George barely mentioned Sansa in the last two books, because of her central role in the show, I have high hopes for Sansa in the coming books.\u00a0</p><p>And those are just some of my thoughts on Sansa\u2019s relationships with her siblings.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p>So I just wanted to jot down some of my thoughts on Sansa&rsquo;s relationships with her siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>In Season 1/Book1, her relationship with Arya is that of rival siblings who don&rsquo;t get along. A lot of people notice that Sansa is closer to their mother and Arya feels left out, and often feels as though her mother is trying to force her into a role of a lady and to be more like Sansa. She obviously has a closer relationship to her father, in comparison, who encouraged her to be herself. Where Arya feels like she&rsquo;s left out from a relationship with her mother, Sansa feels like she&rsquo;s left out from a relationship with her father. Both children love their parents and are loved in turn, but their parents have made it sort of obvious that they understand and get along with one child more than the other. Sansa idealizes her mother, and tries to imitate her, and expects Arya to do the same since they are both the same gender. However, Arya idealizes her father, and resists conforming to societal expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that they are children. Sansa is 11-12 depending on books or seasons, when we meet her, and Arya is 9-10. We are introduced to Sansa through Arya&rsquo;s perspective, and since she&rsquo;s such a lovable character, we automatically see Sansa as her antithesis, since they are such opposites. But BOTH are bratty kids. Sansa is snobby, and Arya is rebellious. Neither wants to understand the other.&nbsp;</p><p>Her relationship with her other siblings is easier: She is closer to Robb, or as close as she can be to her brothers, and she is an older sibling to Bran and Rickon, without the tension that she has with Arya. She understands that they have different roles in society, and is able to interact with them normally.&nbsp;</p><p>Her relationship with Jon is different. Because Jon is her father&rsquo;s bastard son, and is disliked by Catelyn, Sansa imitates this behavior to some degree. She knows her mother doesn&rsquo;t like Jon, and at worst, is indifferent with some teasing. Perhaps, if her relationship with her father was stronger/closer like the one he has with Arya, this would have been different. But as it is, Sansa&rsquo;s education and parenting was basically left up to Catelyn, and Ned is the father who will tell her she looks pretty and that he&rsquo;ll give her a good husband one day. This is not to say that she didn&rsquo;t have a relationship with Jon. In the books, we do know that when Jon thinks of Sansa, he remembers that she taught him how to talk to girls and how to dance. So we can think that either they had initially had a good relationship before Sansa understood what a bastard was, and why her mother disliked Jon, or we can think that even while she knew that Jon was a bastard, she sometimes still interacted with him without being bratty. Which isn&rsquo;t unbelievable.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of people use the situation at the crossings as evidence that Sansa is a bad sibling. On that score, I have only to quote what Ned said to Arya, which was Sansa was put in the position of having to call the prince a liar in front of the king and queen. She was already betrothed to Joffrey, and was trying to set up a rapport with him in some fashion. A lot of criticism is that Sansa fell in love with Joffrey because she wanted to be queen. Well Sansa was a preteen, and I liken her initial behavior with Joffrey as the same as Anna from Frozen when she met Hans for the first time. Her fantasy was finally coming true and her life was finally starting, at least in her mind. Anyways, Sansa is the one who loses the most, as Lady dies &ndash; which incidentally pushes her further from her father and sister since she blames them for her death. Which isn&rsquo;t entirely unfounded; her father did kill Lady and Arya&rsquo;s wolf was the one that bit Joffrey. It doesn&rsquo;t help that Arya blames Sansa for Mycah&rsquo;s murder (or at least holds Sansa to some level of responsibility &ndash; like the queen and Joffrey and the hound). I want to be super clear when i say that Sansa had nothing to do with that &ndash; Mycah was already run down by the time they were having the meeting with the king.&nbsp;</p><p>So at this point we have Sansa&rsquo;s relationship with her father and sister super distant. Ned can&rsquo;t bridge the gap because he doesn&rsquo;t understand how to be a parent to Sansa. He understand&rsquo;s Arya because they are similar, but Sansa is different.

I have not yet lost hope that Sansa&rsquo;s first time in the books will be with Jon - and will be a nice, tender and passionate experience. I also think that GRRM is not the type who thinks that a woman&rsquo;s storyline becomes that much more interesting if rape is included (*eye roll*)&hellip;</p><p>And there is the fact that Tyrion did not sleep with her on their wedding night and there might be the Doylist reason for that, that Sansa&rsquo;s claim that comes with her ability to produce children must be untouched by anyone.

So she might stay a maiden until the very end.</p><p>You know I would totally support Sansa to have a nice experience (although she is still too young in the books, so preferably not before ADOS), but a) the options available to her right now are bad and b) I think that by the time she&rsquo;ll be old enough she will already have reunited with Jon. That means, that she&rsquo;ll be in love (even if she doesn&rsquo;t admit it to herself) and wouldn&rsquo;t want to have a first time with someone different.</p><p>So, I do fear that GRRM might mess up the topos of the hero and his maiden love but I must admit that I don&rsquo;t see any possibility his this might be nice for Sansa. I&rsquo;d rather have her inexperienced with Jon than getting an experience that can only be bad under her circumstances.</p><p>However it will play out: Jon will have the memory of Ygritte, a relationship that was genuine after all, while Sansa probably won&rsquo;t have something like that, but even if their journey to each other mirrors the other&rsquo;s there is no need for a 100% match, at least not imho.</p><p>So under the circumstances I definitely prefer her as an inexperienced girl, although I don&rsquo;t think highly of the 'hero and untouched maiden&rsquo; trope.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",
