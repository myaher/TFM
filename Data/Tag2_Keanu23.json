(Keanu Reeves Imagine)</h1><h2>This was requested.</h2><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Summary:</b> You and Keanu Reeves fall in love while starring in a movie together. You start a relationship with the older man and people form their own opinions about it.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>There is an age gap in this imagine, but  the reader is of age and it is very much legal.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"360\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"just-do-nothing:CWIehSG_u8aGbX2WLGkQnQ:ZfgIMe2Odq9ak\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f73b0b55c40ac01d02067b1c4ed0b316/tumblr_oua3ybTwAw1w8p7s7o1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"360\"/></figure><p>You were on your way to your boyfriend\u2019s house. You were worried because you hadn\u2019t heard from him in several days and that was unlike him. You spoke everyday, but something seemed off with the older man.</p><p>You were dating Keanu Reeves. You\u2019d met on the set of a movie that you worked on together. You and Keanu had so much in common. He was laid back and very private, which was something you could relate to. Sure, you might be an actress, but that didn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t enjoy your privacy. You and Keanu spent so much time together while making the film. You would even hang out a lot off set. You enjoyed each other\u2019s company. He made you happy and you felt that you did the same for him. You could just be yourselves around each other. It wasn\u2019t surprising that feelings developed between you both. Keanu was 54 while you were 30, but the age difference didn\u2019t bother you. It was just a number after all.</p><p>You\u2019d played minor roles here and there prior to this movie, but this was your big breakout role. The movie ended up being a huge success and you\u2019d become famous overnight. You found your name being mentioned in several different magazines and your picture plastered on the front covers. It was definitely different than what you were used to, but you were happy that you were being recognized. Maybe people would take you seriously and you would be cast in more serious roles. That had always been your goal as an actress.</p><p>However, the fame also brought along unwanted attention and talk. When the media found out about your relationship with Keanu, they latched onto it. The paparazzi would follow you two around, trying to snag pictures of you together.  You both were being talked about in gossip magazines and blogs, which was annoying. They mostly spoke of the obvious age difference between the two of you. Some people viewed the relationship as you trying to gain more fame by dating a well known actor while others saw it as Keanu just trying to revive his own career, which was absolutely ridiculous. Keanu didn\u2019t have to revive his career because it was already thriving. People had to find something to talk about and ridicule though. You tried to ignore it all because you viewed it as utter bullshit. As long as you and Keanu knew the truth then who cared what people said?</p><p>You pulled into Keanu\u2019s driveway and typed in the code to open his gate. You drove inside once it opened up for you and you parked your car before getting out. You walked up to his door and rang the doorbell. He\u2019d given you a key to use, but you thought that it might be a bad idea to use it since you hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to him in days. You waited a minute before you rang the doorbell again. The door finally opened a few moments later, revealing a casually dressed Keanu. How the man managed to still look breathtaking in such casual wear was beyond you.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d you greeted him with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cY/N, hey,\u201d he greeted you back.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d You asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d he replied and opened the door more as he moved aside so that you could come in.</p><p>You stepped inside his house and waited for him to close the door again. He then led you into his living room. He took a seat on the couch and you sat beside him. The atmosphere felt so awkward and you couldn\u2019t figure out why. This was so unusual for you and Keanu. Everything usually felt so right and natural between the two of you.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong, Keanu?\u201d You asked, not bothering with beating around the bush.</p><p>\u201cNo, why do you ask?\u201d He asked you as he looked at you.</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t seen you in several days or even heard from you,\u201d you replied. \u201cThat\u2019s not like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been busy is all,\u201d he said and shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been MIA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s all it is?\u201d You asked him. \u201cBecause I feel like there\u2019s something more to it.\u201d</p><p>Keanu sighed as he sat back on the couch. You could tell something was bothering him and he seemed to be battling with it. You sat there patiently and waited for him to speak. He would tell you when he was ready.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just&hellip;do you think I\u2019m dragging you down?\u201d He asked you and you raised your brow in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You asked him. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Keanu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m obviously older,\u201d he began to explain. \u201cI\u2019m 54 and you\u2019re only 30. You\u2019re still in your prime, Y/N, and I\u2019ve passed mine. Don\u2019t you think that being with me would just hold you back?\u201d</p><p>You looked at Keanu as if he were speaking a different language because what he was saying was just preposterous. Why would he think that he was holding you back? He never acted like the whole age difference bothered him before. You both saw yourselves as old souls and didn\u2019t let something like a number come between you. Where would he come up with this?</p><p>It hit you suddenly. He had to have read it somewhere. It was the only logical explanation because you knew he wouldn\u2019t come up with something like that on his own.</p><p>\u201cYou read that somewhere didn\u2019t you?\u201d You asked him and he didn\u2019t say anything. That was answer enough for you. \u201cKeanu, you cant seriously believe the bullshit that the media come up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI usually don\u2019t,\u201d he finally spoke and then sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s just&hellip;maybe they\u2019re right. You\u2019ll eventually realize that I\u2019m older and that I\u2019m holding you back&hellip;and you\u2019ll leave me.\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t believe what you were hearing. Keanu couldn\u2019t seriously believe all of that. He knew you better than those gossip rags, but he was letting them get inside his head and plant false facts inside.</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you this,\u201d you began to speak and turned to face him better. \u201cHave I done anything to make you think all of this? That I\u2019ll just up and leave you?\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment then shook his head. \u201cNo, you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you only fear all of this after reading about it in some gossip magazine or blog?\u201d You asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied and looked at you then he sighed again. \u201cI\u2019m being a jackass aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but giggle and shook your head at him. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re being a jackass, babe. You\u2019re just letting the media and gossip get to you when you shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s understandable, but you should know that it\u2019s comeplete bullshit what they\u2019re saying. Who cares what they think? They don\u2019t know anything about us, Keanu. They only see what they want to because they don\u2019t know the real story. They have to fabricate things.\u201d</p><p>Keanu nodded and ran a hand through his beard, which was a nervous habit of his or something he did when he was thinking. \u201cWhat is the real story then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real story is that I love you, Keanu,\u201d you told him without even hesitating. It was the first time you had told him that and you meant it. \u201cThat girl that they make me out to be in those articles is not the real me. The real me is the person sitting right here, telling you that she loves you and she can\u2019t imagine not being with you. I can be myself around you. I don\u2019t have to pretend to be someone else. You make me a better person.\u201d</p><p>Keanu smiled as you spoke, letting your words sink into his brain and knock out the nonsense he had read before. He shouldn\u2019t have let the gossip get to him. He usually didn\u2019t, but he cared about you so much and he was so worried about losing you. It made him insecure reading that stuff, but he should\u2019ve known better. He took your hand in his and kissed it before he squeezed it.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Y/N,\u201d he said as he looked into your eyes, making sure you knew that he meant it. \u201cYou\u2019re an amazing woman and I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re in my life. I\u2019m lucky to have you and that you put up with my bullshit. I\u2019m sorry that I ignored you like that and let that stuff get to me.\u201d</p><p>You smiled when Keanu told you that he loved you. It made your heart skip a beat as cliche as that might sound. It was true though. He had that affect on you and you absolutely loved it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d you told him and moved closer to him so that you could cuddle into him. He moved his arm so that it was wrapped around you and pulled you closer. \u201cI forgive you. Just don\u2019t do that again. Just remember that I love you and I\u2019m not going anywhere. You\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me,\u201d he replied and smiled as he leaned his head down to kiss you.</p><p>You kissed him back and made sure to pour all of the love you had for him into it so that he knew that you truly did love him.</p>",

(Keanu Reeves Imagine)</h1><h2>This was requested.</h2><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Summary:</b> You and Keanu Reeves fall in love while starring in a movie together. You start a relationship with the older man and people form their own opinions about it.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>There is an age gap in this imagine, but  the reader is of age and it is very much legal.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"360\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"just-do-nothing:CWIehSG_u8aGbX2WLGkQnQ:ZfgIMe2Odq9ak\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f73b0b55c40ac01d02067b1c4ed0b316/tumblr_oua3ybTwAw1w8p7s7o1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"360\"></figure><p>You were on your way to your boyfriend\u2019s house. You were worried because you hadn\u2019t heard from him in several days and that was unlike him. You spoke everyday, but something seemed off with the older man.</p><p>You were dating Keanu Reeves. You\u2019d met on the set of a movie that you worked on together. You and Keanu had so much in common. He was laid back and very private, which was something you could relate to. Sure, you might be an actress, but that didn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t enjoy your privacy. You and Keanu spent so much time together while making the film. You would even hang out a lot off set. You enjoyed each other\u2019s company. He made you happy and you felt that you did the same for him. You could just be yourselves around each other. It wasn\u2019t surprising that feelings developed between you both. Keanu was 54 while you were 30, but the age difference didn\u2019t bother you. It was just a number after all.</p><p>You\u2019d played minor roles here and there prior to this movie, but this was your big breakout role. The movie ended up being a huge success and you\u2019d become famous overnight. You found your name being mentioned in several different magazines and your picture plastered on the front covers. It was definitely different than what you were used to, but you were happy that you were being recognized. Maybe people would take you seriously and you would be cast in more serious roles. That had always been your goal as an actress.</p><p>However, the fame also brought along unwanted attention and talk. When the media found out about your relationship with Keanu, they latched onto it. The paparazzi would follow you two around, trying to snag pictures of you together.  You both were being talked about in gossip magazines and blogs, which was annoying. They mostly spoke of the obvious age difference between the two of you. Some people viewed the relationship as you trying to gain more fame by dating a well known actor while others saw it as Keanu just trying to revive his own career, which was absolutely ridiculous. Keanu didn\u2019t have to revive his career because it was already thriving. People had to find something to talk about and ridicule though. You tried to ignore it all because you viewed it as utter bullshit. As long as you and Keanu knew the truth then who cared what people said?</p><p>You pulled into Keanu\u2019s driveway and typed in the code to open his gate. You drove inside once it opened up for you and you parked your car before getting out. You walked up to his door and rang the doorbell. He\u2019d given you a key to use, but you thought that it might be a bad idea to use it since you hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to him in days. You waited a minute before you rang the doorbell again. The door finally opened a few moments later, revealing a casually dressed Keanu. How the man managed to still look breathtaking in such casual wear was beyond you.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d you greeted him with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cY/N, hey,\u201d he greeted you back.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d You asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d he replied and opened the door more as he moved aside so that you could come in.</p><p>You stepped inside his house and waited for him to close the door again. He then led you into his living room. He took a seat on the couch and you sat beside him. The atmosphere felt so awkward and you couldn\u2019t figure out why. This was so unusual for you and Keanu. Everything usually felt so right and natural between the two of you.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong, Keanu?\u201d You asked, not bothering with beating around the bush.</p><p>\u201cNo, why do you ask?\u201d He asked you as he looked at you.</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t seen you in several days or even heard from you,\u201d you replied. \u201cThat\u2019s not like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been busy is all,\u201d he said and shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been MIA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s all it is?\u201d You asked him. \u201cBecause I feel like there\u2019s something more to it.\u201d</p><p>Keanu sighed as he sat back on the couch. You could tell something was bothering him and he seemed to be battling with it. You sat there patiently and waited for him to speak. He would tell you when he was ready.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026do you think I\u2019m dragging you down?\u201d He asked you and you raised your brow in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You asked him. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Keanu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m obviously older,\u201d he began to explain. \u201cI\u2019m 54 and you\u2019re only 30. You\u2019re still in your prime, Y/N, and I\u2019ve passed mine. Don\u2019t you think that being with me would just hold you back?\u201d</p><p>You looked at Keanu as if he were speaking a different language because what he was saying was just preposterous. Why would he think that he was holding you back? He never acted like the whole age difference bothered him before. You both saw yourselves as old souls and didn\u2019t let something like a number come between you. Where would he come up with this?</p><p>It hit you suddenly. He had to have read it somewhere. It was the only logical explanation because you knew he wouldn\u2019t come up with something like that on his own.</p><p>\u201cYou read that somewhere didn\u2019t you?\u201d You asked him and he didn\u2019t say anything. That was answer enough for you. \u201cKeanu, you cant seriously believe the bullshit that the media come up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI usually don\u2019t,\u201d he finally spoke and then sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026maybe they\u2019re right. You\u2019ll eventually realize that I\u2019m older and that I\u2019m holding you back\u2026and you\u2019ll leave me.\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t believe what you were hearing. Keanu couldn\u2019t seriously believe all of that. He knew you better than those gossip rags, but he was letting them get inside his head and plant false facts inside.</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you this,\u201d you began to speak and turned to face him better. \u201cHave I done anything to make you think all of this? That I\u2019ll just up and leave you?\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment then shook his head. \u201cNo, you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you only fear all of this after reading about it in some gossip magazine or blog?\u201d You asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied and looked at you then he sighed again. \u201cI\u2019m being a jackass aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but giggle and shook your head at him. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re being a jackass, babe. You\u2019re just letting the media and gossip get to you when you shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s understandable, but you should know that it\u2019s comeplete bullshit what they\u2019re saying. Who cares what they think? They don\u2019t know anything about us, Keanu. They only see what they want to because they don\u2019t know the real story. They have to fabricate things.\u201d</p><p>Keanu nodded and ran a hand through his beard, which was a nervous habit of his or something he did when he was thinking. \u201cWhat is the real story then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real story is that I love you, Keanu,\u201d you told him without even hesitating. It was the first time you had told him that and you meant it. \u201cThat girl that they make me out to be in those articles is not the real me. The real me is the person sitting right here, telling you that she loves you and she can\u2019t imagine not being with you. I can be myself around you. I don\u2019t have to pretend to be someone else. You make me a better person.\u201d</p><p>Keanu smiled as you spoke, letting your words sink into his brain and knock out the nonsense he had read before. He shouldn\u2019t have let the gossip get to him. He usually didn\u2019t, but he cared about you so much and he was so worried about losing you. It made him insecure reading that stuff, but he should\u2019ve known better. He took your hand in his and kissed it before he squeezed it.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Y/N,\u201d he said as he looked into your eyes, making sure you knew that he meant it. \u201cYou\u2019re an amazing woman and I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re in my life. I\u2019m lucky to have you and that you put up with my bullshit. I\u2019m sorry that I ignored you like that and let that stuff get to me.\u201d</p><p>You smiled when Keanu told you that he loved you. It made your heart skip a beat as cliche as that might sound. It was true though. He had that affect on you and you absolutely loved it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d you told him and moved closer to him so that you could cuddle into him. He moved his arm so that it was wrapped around you and pulled you closer. \u201cI forgive you. Just don\u2019t do that again. Just remember that I love you and I\u2019m not going anywhere. You\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me,\u201d he replied and smiled as he leaned his head down to kiss you.</p><p>You kissed him back and made sure to pour all of the love you had for him into it so that he knew that you truly did love him.</p></p>",
