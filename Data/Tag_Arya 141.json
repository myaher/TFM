A lot of the hostile tension between the sisters start after the Trident fiasco and certain stans really love to use passages of Sansa's ill feelings towards A*rya post-trident when her anger comes from the death of her wolf and Sansa's own daddy issues.",
        "answer": "<blockquote><p>\n(2) While Sansa\u2019s hostility was harsh and misplaced, the fandom has \ngreatly exaggerated this and has built up their entire dynamic solely by\n this event without exploring their relationship outside of it. Reading \nsome passages of Sansa\u2019s and Arya\u2019s post AGOT, I got the impression \nthat, while they weren\u2019t close, they do love each other and think of \neach other fondly throughout their journey and I would love to read \nGRRM\u2019s version of their reunion. <br/></p></blockquote><p>Dear nonny,</p><p>anyone who has siblings knows that they can be annoying as hell, different from yourself in almost every important way and still very dear to your heart. And anway while I thought it was perfectly acceptable to prank my older sister, I would have defended her against any other person! Now, that my sister and I are adults we actually have a very close and nice relationship and she has my back - and we are still very, very different.<br/></p><p>I do think that part of the misunderstanding in regard to Arya and Sansa is due to the PoV trap. We see Sansa for the first time through Arya\u2019s eyes, and it is obvious that Arya as the rebellious and unruly sister rejects the ease with which Sansa lives up to expectations. And honestly we can feel for her. The reason that some Arya fans hate Sansa is that they well remember this feeling of inadequacy that gets hold of you when you see another older girl excelling in things you yourself are not particularly good at and yet seem to be the only important activitiy for a woman. I guess in today\u2019s society it is better than in the rigid society of almost-medieval Westeros, but I do believe that many, many people can relate to that particular feeling.

                "content": "<p><blockquote><p>\n(2) While Sansa&rsquo;s hostility was harsh and misplaced, the fandom has \ngreatly exaggerated this and has built up their entire dynamic solely by\n this event without exploring their relationship outside of it. Reading \nsome passages of Sansa&rsquo;s and Arya&rsquo;s post AGOT, I got the impression \nthat, while they weren&rsquo;t close, they do love each other and think of \neach other fondly throughout their journey and I would love to read \nGRRM&rsquo;s version of their reunion. <br /></p></blockquote><p>Dear nonny,</p><p>anyone who has siblings knows that they can be annoying as hell, different from yourself in almost every important way and still very dear to your heart. And anway while I thought it was perfectly acceptable to prank my older sister, I would have defended her against any other person! Now, that my sister and I are adults we actually have a very close and nice relationship and she has my back - and we are still very, very different.<br /></p><p>I do think that part of the misunderstanding in regard to Arya and Sansa is due to the PoV trap. We see Sansa for the first time through Arya&rsquo;s eyes, and it is obvious that Arya as the rebellious and unruly sister rejects the ease with which Sansa lives up to expectations. And honestly we can feel for her. The reason that some Arya fans hate Sansa is that they well remember this feeling of inadequacy that gets hold of you when you see another older girl excelling in things you yourself are not particularly good at and yet seem to be the only important activitiy for a woman. I guess in today&rsquo;s society it is better than in the rigid society of almost-medieval Westeros, but I do believe that many, many people can relate to that particular feeling. It is part of growing up, that older children are better at some things, and coping with this and finding what we excel at is what makes us grow. So, Arya&rsquo;s PoV is extremely relatable, but it is also unreliable, because her feelings positively hinder her to realise that Sansa is not a bad sister. In the very first Arya chapter, Sansa covers up for her - which she is accustomed to do. <br /></p><blockquote><p>\n&ldquo;Jon says he looks like a girl,&rdquo; Arya said.\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Sansa sighed as she stitched. &ldquo;Poor Jon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He gets jealous because he&rsquo;s a bastard.&rdquo;\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s our brother,&rdquo; Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></p><p>Septa Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp \neyes, and a thin lipless mouth made for frowning. It was frowning now. \n&ldquo;What are you talking about, children?&rdquo;\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Our half brother,&rdquo; Sansa corrected, soft \nand precise. She smiled for the septa. &ldquo;Arya and I were remarking on how\n pleased we were to have the princess with us today,&rdquo; she said.\n\n(AGOT, Arya I)</p></blockquote><p>Sansa deflects Septa Mordane. She prevents that everyone in the room gets alerted to the fact that Jon and Arya were criticizing the crown prince. She&rsquo;s got Arya&rsquo;s back here, but Arya doesn&rsquo;t realise this. <br /></p><p>Anyway, I could go on about this and you are quite right, that we have the incident at the Trident in the first Sansa chapter does not help at all. Some fans refuse to see that deep down Arya and Sansa love each other. I&rsquo;m sure that <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwWZHOYYX4qznCWYcc2asUw\">@kellyvela</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> have explained this and you can check their blogs. <br /></p><p>There is the PoV trap, there is the fact, that we see only into Sansa&rsquo;s head the day the fall-out with her sister happens, and there is the way we are guided by that bastard GRRM to misread and misinterpret the signs that point towards the sisters&rsquo; love for each other. <br /></p><blockquote><p>\nShe remembered a summer&rsquo;s snow in Winterfell when Arya and Bran \nhad ambushed her as she emerged from the keep one morning. They&rsquo;d each \nhad a dozen snowballs to hand, and she&rsquo;d had none. Bran had been perched\n on the roof of the covered bridge, out of reach, but Sansa had chased Arya\n through the stables and around the kitchen until both of them were \nbreathless. She might even have caught her, but she&rsquo;d slipped on some \nice. Her sister came back to see if she was hurt. When she said she \nwasn&rsquo;t, Arya hit her in the face with another snowball, but Sansa\n grabbed her leg and pulled her down and was rubbing snow in her hair \nwhen Jory came along and pulled them apart, laughing. (ASOS, Sansa VII)</p></blockquote><p>This is where you can see it. The younger siblings prank the older sister, a snow fight enses and Sansa slips. What does Arya do? &nbsp;\n\n\n<b>Her sister came back to see if she was hurt. </b>That is perfectly normal sibling behaviour. As is that the fight continues directly after Sansa tells Arya that she is not hurt! I honestly don&rsquo;t know how people get the idea that the sisters hate each other&hellip;..</p><p>\nI would just alert you to the fact, that there is even more, and that is tropes. \n\nAnd this is really cleverly done. Because with Arya&rsquo;s and Sansa&rsquo;s relationship GRRM plays into several ideas in our heads about the Cinderella trope. And we all know, who is the good girl in the Cinderella tale, don&rsquo;t we?</p><p>If you look at it, it is all there, apart from the fact that they are real siblings and not step-sister. The &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; sister who gets scolded by the mother, and snubbed by the older sister (or so it seems to Arya), the older sister who is into dance and music and excells in it (and who does not get her hands dirty). In Sansa&rsquo;s first chapter we see Sansa recoil from a mud-splattered Arya. Also Cinderella-Arya is fond of running, has friends with the servants, you name it. Then there is the father, who favours the &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; sister. He is the one that loves Cinderella, and it is only after he dies, that her life becomes hell. I have answered several questions already on Ned and his failure to be as good as a father to Arya as to Sansa. <br /></p><p>So these tropes are strong! We are supposed to root for Cinderella - Arya, and this is what we do. How charming that she learns the sword as well! It makes it so easy to like her (and I like her as well, I love Arya, and I loved her before I appreciated Sansa). <br /></p><p>Only, GRRM gives us hints that the Cinderella trope is not applicable in Arya&rsquo;s and Sansa&rsquo;s case.

As a group, we write individually but we come together to share our collective experiences with different media. For TGE Watches, we talk about movies and TV shows. TGE Plays, we play games together. For TGE Reads, we select a book, read it, and then discuss it together. We are hoping through our collective knowledge and know-how to share these geeky interests with our readers, viewers, and listeners. \n\nListen to our podcast at https://www.thegeekembassy.com/category/podcast",
