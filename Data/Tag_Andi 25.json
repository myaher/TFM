        "answer": "<p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Can you tell that the first part is very GMW inspired from that episode where maya and riley are fighting. again I changed some stuff I hope it&rsquo;s okay! </p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being ridiculous, TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus groaned, hiding his head in his hands, getting up from the swing and holding onto the pole.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m being ridiculous, am I? Wow, very original comment there, Goodman,&rdquo; TJ said angrily, the swing he was sitting on swaying slightly. From behind the slide, Buffy peeked over, looking at the two boys while Andi, Jonah, Marty and Amber crouched, hidden from view. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad, guys,&rdquo; Buffy said worriedly, shaking her head. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Cyrus and TJ,&rdquo; Jonah said, smiling slightly. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, they love each other too much,&rdquo; Marty added, high fiving Jonah. </p><p>Buffy shook her head, turning back to the swings, where Cyrus was walking away. </p><p>&ldquo;And where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; TJ yelled, turning around to face Cyrus. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not messing up the importance of the swings with this petty argument!&rdquo; Cyrus yelled back. TJ moved forward and pointed between him and the swings. </p><p>&ldquo;You come back here and mess it up!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No guys, this one is really, really bad. Like, worse than Costume Day bad,&rdquo; Buffy said, turning back to the crouched group. </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be fine, Cyrus and TJ can survive anything,&rdquo; Andi said, waving her hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, they&rsquo;re gonna marry each other one day!&rdquo; Amber said, earning a fist bump from Andi. </p><p>&ldquo;You make such a huge deal out of nothing. I just said I&rsquo;m busy with my English project, why do you have to be so difficult?&rdquo; Cyrus said, walking up to TJ. </p><p>&ldquo;Thats not why I&rsquo;m mad, Cyrus! It&rsquo;s the fact that it&rsquo;s so clear you&rsquo;re making every excuse to not hang out these days, instead of just straight up telling me,&rdquo; TJ said, pinching the bridge of his nose. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being ridiculous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re being oblivious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just for one minute, can you get your head out of the dirt and see that other things matter other than you?&rdquo; Cyrus yelled, and TJ was taken aback. Cyrus almost wanted to clamp a hand over his mouth as soon as he realised what he had said. But it was too late. </p><p>TJ just nodded. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m the self centered one?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus was silent, trying to find the words to say. But before he could, TJ beat him to it. </p><p>&ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re being difficult.&rdquo;</p><p>Immediately, all remorse Cyrus felt for what he said flew out the window. &ldquo;Are you serious right now?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ huffed in annoyance, walking away from Cyrus. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; Cyrus yelled, running after TJ. TJ just turned around sharply. </p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye Cyrus,&rdquo; He said, before walking away. </p><p>Cyrus scoffed, and yelled after him. &ldquo;Oh yeah, walking away. Really mature!&rdquo;</p><p>After TJ had gone, Cyrus kicked the rocks near the swing, plonking himself into one, the anger eating him alive. &ldquo;Jerk,&rdquo; He whispered, swinging slowly. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, you guys saying it won&rsquo;t be so bad?&rdquo; Buffy said, turning to the group. The others nodded, looking up, as Buffy sighed and pointed. All of them stood up and looked at Cyrus swinging alone, TJ nowhere in sight.</p><p>They had to fix this. </p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Cy?&rdquo; Andi said softly, as she pushed open the door of his room, Buffy and Jonah standing behind her. Cyrus had spent a couple minutes swinging alone before finally getting up to go home. Andi, Buffy and Jonah had decided to go after Cyrus, while Amber and Marty spoke to TJ. </p><p>Cyrus was lying in bed, his phone in his hand, constantly tapping away at the screen. He looked up at the sound of Andi&rsquo;s voice expectantly, but visibly deflated when he saw it was just his friends. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you texted TJ?&rdquo; Buffy asked, sitting down at the foot of the bed. Andi joined her, Jonah sitting on the beanbag near Cyrus&rsquo; head. </p><p>Cyrus scoffed. &ldquo;Why should I text him? He&rsquo;s the one being ridiculous,&rdquo; He said, before shooting up, narrowing his eyes. &ldquo;Wait, how do you guys know we fought?&rdquo;</p><p>The three of them exchanged glances, looking sheepishly at the ground, and Cyrus sighed, hiding his head in the pillow. </p><p>&ldquo;You guys were behind the slide, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>They all nodded. Cyrus groaned, turning over into his stomach. Buffy patted his back. </p><p>&ldquo;But what happened? We only came near the end of it all,&rdquo; Jonah asked, looking at Cyrus. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna talk about it,&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled, peeking out of the pillow. Andi sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;You should talk about it Cy, maybe you can figure out what needs to be done.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus just groaned. &ldquo;And what makes you think I wanna talk to him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One thing being that we know for a fact you have been writing and deleting texts to TJ since you got back,&rdquo; Buffy said, raising an eyebrow. &ldquo;We know that this fight has upset you. And it&rsquo;s worse than other ones. But why?&rdquo; Andi said, lying down beside Cyrus. </p><p>Sighing, Cyrus turned onto his back, and Buffy and Jonah joined them on the bed, lying down together. </p><p>&ldquo;TJ and I were supposed to go out today, but in the last minute I needed to help out Leo with the English project we&rsquo;ve been assigned. So me and Leo have been spending a lot of time together, right? And TJ hasn&rsquo;t said anything all this time, but for some reason he just snapped today. Who knows why.&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah took a minute to think before saying, &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s jealous? I mean, you and Leo have gotten pretty close.&rdquo; But Buffy shook her head. </p><p>&ldquo;No, can&rsquo;t be. Well, maybe not completely. Cuz Cyrus is much closer to you than Leo, and TJ isn&rsquo;t jealous of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Yeah, if it was jealousy, you&rsquo;d be a more likely person he&rsquo;d be jealous of.&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah nodded thoughtfully, leaning back. </p><p>&ldquo;So what could it be?&rdquo; Andi said, sighing. </p><p>Cyrus just shrugged, his face softening. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right though. We have been growing distant lately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what do you make of that?&rdquo; Buffy asked. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but none of the things I&rsquo;m thinking are good,&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled, shaking his head. &ldquo;Maybe this is it, you know? This is the end. Might as well accept it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are not going to just let something like an argument tear you guys apart,&rdquo; Andi said definitively. But Cyrus just shook his head. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Andi. I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I don&rsquo;t want it to be the end, because I,&rdquo; Cyrus caught himself, biting his lip. Jonah looked at him curiously. </p><p>&ldquo;What is it Cyrus?&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;What is it TJ?&rdquo; Amber said, leaning back in the chair in TJ&rsquo;s room. Marty lay back on TJ&rsquo;s bed, tossing the basketball up and down. TJ was pacing next to the window. Amber and Marty had found him pacing, rock music blaring through his battered headphones. After some heated words, they had finally managed to calm TJ down enough so that he could talk. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; TJ mumbled, and Marty caught the ball, sitting up and looking at TJ, unimpressed. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clearly not nothing, Teej. Cyrus was saying stuff like you were making a mountain out of a molehill. What?&rdquo; He asked, seeing Amber&rsquo;s shocked expression. </p><p>&ldquo;You know actual English,&rdquo; She whispered, and Marty tossed the basketball at her, TJ cracking a small smile. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you know, I&rsquo;m not an idiot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? I just thought you were a slightly less impressive TikTok e-boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My e-boy status aside,&rdquo; Marty mumbled, flashing Amber a dirty look before turning back to TJ. &ldquo;Something must have happened.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked over at Marty, who was looking at him with a small smile, and sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still, just tell us,&rdquo; Amber said, looking encouragingly at TJ. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think it&rsquo;s me being jealous about Cyrus and Leo hanging out so much cuz of their English project,&rdquo; TJ started with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;But believe it or not, it isn&rsquo;t that. Well, not exactly.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty and Amber listened patiently as TJ collected his thoughts, his voice getting choked up. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been growing apart. And we entered high school in a relationship. But you know what they say about high school and middle school relationships. And seeing Leo and him, it just made me realise how much better Cyrus deserves than me,&rdquo; TJ said, his voice cracking. &ldquo;And you know, a year is a long time for a relationship. Maybe we just reached our end.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that TJ,&rdquo; Amber started. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just assume these things. You two need to talk this out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he wants to talk to me Amber, for good reason. I really did burst at him for nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>But Amber wouldn&rsquo;t hear it. She nodded at Marty, who leapt up and snatched TJ&rsquo;s phone from his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what are you-&rdquo; TJ started, but Marty was tying away at a message, hit send and threw the phone onto the bed. When TJ scrambled to pick it up, he saw Cyrus&rsquo; chat open. </p><p><b>TJ</b>: hey can we talk? </p><p><b>Underdog</b>\ud83d\udc9a: yeah we should</p><p>TJ was about to launch at Marty, but seeing Cyrus reply gave him a bit of hope and he shakily typed out another message, Amber and Marty looking at him approvingly. </p><p><b>TJ</b>: spoon tomorrow morning? like 9? </p><p><b>Underdog</b>\ud83d\udc9a: cool. see you</p><p>*</p><p>As Cyrus waited for TJ in the booth, he was constantly tapping his foot and checking his phone every two seconds. He hadnt slept well, the &lsquo;what if&rsquo;s haunting his dreams, all his attempts ending in fighting, breakdowns and distance. Now that he had time to calm down from the explosion, he looked around, trying to avert his eyes from the damage. Trying to find whether there was anything he could salvage. </p><p>He had entertained the thought that maybe he should let them go, that every relationship came to an end, but he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to follow through on it. Specifically because of a few words he had finally understood the meaning of. </p><p>The door of the Spoon opened, pulling Cyrus out of his thoughts, as he turned to see TJ, hands stuffed in his hoodie pockets, walk up to him. He looked tired. Sad. If the situation hadnt been what it was, Cyrus wouldn&rsquo;t have hesitated in pulling him into a never-ending hug. </p><p>TJ slid into the seat opposite to him, pulling at the skin on his thumb. &ldquo;Hey Cyrus,&rdquo; He said, his voice small. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus replied, his voice struggling to remain steady. </p><p>Silence fell between them, the two unsure of who should start. Finally, TJ sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for snapping yesterday. I, I don&rsquo;t know what happened. I guess, there were just some things I&rsquo;d been keeping in, that it just burst out of me.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus looked up at TJ, who was looking at his hands, pulling the skin of his thumb raw. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry too, TJ. I didn&rsquo;t mean what I said.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ flashed his a small smile, looking back at his hands. Cyrus narrowed his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;But what happened? Why did you suddenly just snap, Teej?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked away, avoiding Cyrus&rsquo; eyes. Cyrus took a deep breath. </p><p>&ldquo;Is it because you&rsquo;re jealous of Leo? Because you really don&rsquo;t have to be,&rdquo; Cyrus began, but TJ cut him off. </p><p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that, Cy. Its,&rdquo; He hesitated, looking back up. &ldquo;Look, I don&rsquo;t care that you hang out with Leo a lot. But, it made me realise that you deserve so much better than me, you know? You&rsquo;re so amazing, Cy. And anyone would be so lucky to be with you. There are so many people out there better for you, and I&rsquo;m just holding you back,&rdquo; TJ said, sniffing. Cyrus just listened, stunned into silence. </p><p>TJ laughed bitterly. &ldquo;You know, with all that talk about what high school does to middle school relationships, I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t happen to us. But, we don&rsquo;t know everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Cyrus said, interrupting TJ. &ldquo;Are you breaking up with me?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked up sadly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to Cy, but you deserve better than me, a guy who snaps at nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey that isn&rsquo;t your decision,&rdquo; Cyrus said firmly, reaching over to grab TJ&rsquo;s hand, stopping him from pulling at his skin more. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to say that I deserve better than you, especially when that is not at all true. Yesterday, after our fight, I kept thinking to myself, 'Maybe this is the end.&rsquo; But I couldn&rsquo;t accept it,&rdquo; Cyrus said softly, covering his and TJ&rsquo;s asked hands with his other hand. &ldquo;I had no idea you felt this way, and I&rsquo;m sorry. I should have noticed. And we have drifted apart a bit. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault, Cyrus,&rdquo; TJ said, finally looking Cyrus in the eye. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe not, but still, I am. But you don&rsquo;t get to walk away from me and say it&rsquo;s for my own good. I decide what&rsquo;s good enough for me. And you, TJ Kippen,&rdquo; Cyrus said, reaching up to tuck TJ&rsquo;s hair back. &ldquo;You are one of the best things to have happened to me. You know why?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked curiousky at Cyrus, tilting his head to one side. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smiled, breathing in. &ldquo;Because I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>A soft smile spread across TJ&rsquo;s face, as he got up and moved to Cyrus&rsquo; side of the booth, enveloping him in a hug, burrowing his head in Cyrus&rsquo; shoulder. Cyrus cradled TJ&rsquo;s head, holding on tight. </p><p>TJ pulled away, leaning his head against Cyrus&rsquo; as he whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~~</p><p><i>Hope you liked it!</i></p><p><b><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\">Send me prompts for fics!</a></b></p>",

Wow, very original comment there, Goodman,\u201d TJ said angrily, the swing he was sitting on swaying slightly. From behind the slide, Buffy peeked over, looking at the two boys while Andi, Jonah, Marty and Amber crouched, hidden from view. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad, guys,\u201d Buffy said worriedly, shaking her head. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Cyrus and TJ,\u201d Jonah said, smiling slightly. </p><p>\u201cYeah, they love each other too much,\u201d Marty added, high fiving Jonah. </p><p>Buffy shook her head, turning back to the swings, where Cyrus was walking away. </p><p>\u201cAnd where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d TJ yelled, turning around to face Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not messing up the importance of the swings with this petty argument!\u201d Cyrus yelled back.

Like, worse than Costume Day bad,\u201d Buffy said, turning back to the crouched group. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine, Cyrus and TJ can survive anything,\u201d Andi said, waving her hand. </p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re gonna marry each other one day!\u201d Amber said, earning a fist bump from Andi. </p><p>\u201cYou make such a huge deal out of nothing. I just said I\u2019m busy with my English project, why do you have to be so difficult?\u201d Cyrus said, walking up to TJ. </p><p>\u201cThats not why I\u2019m mad, Cyrus! It\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s so clear you\u2019re making every excuse to not hang out these days, instead of just straight up telling me,\u201d TJ said, pinching the bridge of his nose. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re being oblivious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for one minute, can you get your head out of the dirt and see that other things matter other than you?\u201d Cyrus yelled, and TJ was taken aback. Cyrus almost wanted to clamp a hand over his mouth as soon as he realised what he had said. But it was too late. </p><p>TJ just nodded. \u201cSo I\u2019m the self centered one?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was silent, trying to find the words to say. But before he could, TJ beat him to it. </p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re being difficult.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, all remorse Cyrus felt for what he said flew out the window. \u201cAre you serious right now?\u201d</p><p>TJ huffed in annoyance, walking away from Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cHey! Where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Cyrus yelled, running after TJ. TJ just turned around sharply. </p><p>\u201cGoodbye Cyrus,\u201d He said, before walking away. </p><p>Cyrus scoffed, and yelled after him. \u201cOh yeah, walking away. Really mature!\u201d</p><p>After TJ had gone, Cyrus kicked the rocks near the swing, plonking himself into one, the anger eating him alive. \u201cJerk,\u201d He whispered, swinging slowly. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah, you guys saying it won\u2019t be so bad?\u201d Buffy said, turning to the group. The others nodded, looking up, as Buffy sighed and pointed. All of them stood up and looked at Cyrus swinging alone, TJ nowhere in sight.</p><p>They had to fix this. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cCy?\u201d Andi said softly, as she pushed open the door of his room, Buffy and Jonah standing behind her. Cyrus had spent a couple minutes swinging alone before finally getting up to go home. Andi, Buffy and Jonah had decided to go after Cyrus, while Amber and Marty spoke to TJ. </p><p>Cyrus was lying in bed, his phone in his hand, constantly tapping away at the screen. He looked up at the sound of Andi\u2019s voice expectantly, but visibly deflated when he saw it was just his friends. </p><p>\u201cHave you texted TJ?\u201d Buffy asked, sitting down at the foot of the bed. Andi joined her, Jonah sitting on the beanbag near Cyrus\u2019 head. </p><p>Cyrus scoffed. \u201cWhy should I text him? He\u2019s the one being ridiculous,\u201d He said, before shooting up, narrowing his eyes. \u201cWait, how do you guys know we fought?\u201d</p><p>The three of them exchanged glances, looking sheepishly at the ground, and Cyrus sighed, hiding his head in the pillow. </p><p>\u201cYou guys were behind the slide, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>They all nodded. Cyrus groaned, turning over into his stomach. Buffy patted his back. </p><p>\u201cBut what happened? We only came near the end of it all,\u201d Jonah asked, looking at Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, peeking out of the pillow. Andi sighed. </p><p>\u201cYou should talk about it Cy, maybe you can figure out what needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just groaned. \u201cAnd what makes you think I wanna talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing being that we know for a fact you have been writing and deleting texts to TJ since you got back,\u201d Buffy said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cWe know that this fight has upset you. And it\u2019s worse than other ones. But why?\u201d Andi said, lying down beside Cyrus. </p><p>Sighing, Cyrus turned onto his back, and Buffy and Jonah joined them on the bed, lying down together. </p><p>\u201cTJ and I were supposed to go out today, but in the last minute I needed to help out Leo with the English project we\u2019ve been assigned. So me and Leo have been spending a lot of time together, right? And TJ hasn\u2019t said anything all this time, but for some reason he just snapped today. Who knows why.\u201d</p><p>Jonah took a minute to think before saying, \u201cMaybe he\u2019s jealous? I mean, you and Leo have gotten pretty close.\u201d But Buffy shook her head. </p><p>\u201cNo, can\u2019t be. Well, maybe not completely. Cuz Cyrus is much closer to you than Leo, and TJ isn\u2019t jealous of you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded in agreement. \u201cYeah, if it was jealousy, you\u2019d be a more likely person he\u2019d be jealous of.\u201d</p><p>Jonah nodded thoughtfully, leaning back. </p><p>\u201cSo what could it be?\u201d Andi said, sighing. </p><p>Cyrus just shrugged, his face softening. \u201cHe\u2019s right though. We have been growing distant lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you make of that?\u201d Buffy asked. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but none of the things I\u2019m thinking are good,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, shaking his head. \u201cMaybe this is it, you know? This is the end. Might as well accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to just let something like an argument tear you guys apart,\u201d Andi said definitively. But Cyrus just shook his head. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Andi. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want it to be the end, because I,\u201d Cyrus caught himself, biting his lip. Jonah looked at him curiously. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cWhat is it TJ?\u201d Amber said, leaning back in the chair in TJ\u2019s room. Marty lay back on TJ\u2019s bed, tossing the basketball up and down. TJ was pacing next to the window. Amber and Marty had found him pacing, rock music blaring through his battered headphones. After some heated words, they had finally managed to calm TJ down enough so that he could talk. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d TJ mumbled, and Marty caught the ball, sitting up and looking at TJ, unimpressed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clearly not nothing, Teej. Cyrus was saying stuff like you were making a mountain out of a molehill. What?\u201d He asked, seeing Amber\u2019s shocked expression. </p><p>\u201cYou know actual English,\u201d She whispered, and Marty tossed the basketball at her, TJ cracking a small smile. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I just thought you were a slightly less impressive TikTok e-boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy e-boy status aside,\u201d Marty mumbled, flashing Amber a dirty look before turning back to TJ. \u201cSomething must have happened.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked over at Marty, who was looking at him with a small smile, and sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, just tell us,\u201d Amber said, looking encouragingly at TJ. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think it\u2019s me being jealous about Cyrus and Leo hanging out so much cuz of their English project,\u201d TJ started with a bitter laugh. \u201cBut believe it or not, it isn\u2019t that. Well, not exactly.\u201d</p><p>Marty and Amber listened patiently as TJ collected his thoughts, his voice getting choked up. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been growing apart. And we entered high school in a relationship. But you know what they say about high school and middle school relationships. And seeing Leo and him, it just made me realise how much better Cyrus deserves than me,\u201d TJ said, his voice cracking. \u201cAnd you know, a year is a long time for a relationship. Maybe we just reached our end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that TJ,\u201d Amber started. \u201cYou can\u2019t just assume these things. You two need to talk this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to talk to me Amber, for good reason. I really did burst at him for nothing.\u201d</p><p>But Amber wouldn\u2019t hear it. She nodded at Marty, who leapt up and snatched TJ\u2019s phone from his hand. </p><p>\u201cHey, what are you-\u201d TJ started, but Marty was tying away at a message, hit send and threw the phone onto the bed. When TJ scrambled to pick it up, he saw Cyrus\u2019 chat open. </p><p><b>TJ</b>: hey can we talk? </p><p><b>Underdog</b>\ud83d\udc9a: yeah we should</p><p>TJ was about to launch at Marty, but seeing Cyrus reply gave him a bit of hope and he shakily typed out another message, Amber and Marty looking at him approvingly. </p><p><b>TJ</b>: spoon tomorrow morning? like 9? </p><p><b>Underdog</b>\ud83d\udc9a: cool. see you</p><p>*</p><p>As Cyrus waited for TJ in the booth, he was constantly tapping his foot and checking his phone every two seconds. He hadnt slept well, the \u2018what if\u2019s haunting his dreams, all his attempts ending in fighting, breakdowns and distance. Now that he had time to calm down from the explosion, he looked around, trying to avert his eyes from the damage.

Like, worse than Costume Day bad,\u201d Buffy said, turning back to the crouched group. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine, Cyrus and TJ can survive anything,\u201d Andi said, waving her hand. </p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re gonna marry each other one day!\u201d Amber said, earning a fist bump from Andi. </p><p>\u201cYou make such a huge deal out of nothing. I just said I\u2019m busy with my English project, why do you have to be so difficult?\u201d Cyrus said, walking up to TJ. </p><p>\u201cThats not why I\u2019m mad, Cyrus! It\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s so clear you\u2019re making every excuse to not hang out these days, instead of just straight up telling me,\u201d TJ said, pinching the bridge of his nose. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re being oblivious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for one minute, can you get your head out of the dirt and see that other things matter other than you?\u201d Cyrus yelled, and TJ was taken aback. Cyrus almost wanted to clamp a hand over his mouth as soon as he realised what he had said. But it was too late. </p><p>TJ just nodded. \u201cSo I\u2019m the self centered one?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was silent, trying to find the words to say. But before he could, TJ beat him to it. </p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re being difficult.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, all remorse Cyrus felt for what he said flew out the window. \u201cAre you serious right now?\u201d</p><p>TJ huffed in annoyance, walking away from Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cHey! Where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Cyrus yelled, running after TJ. TJ just turned around sharply. </p><p>\u201cGoodbye Cyrus,\u201d He said, before walking away. </p><p>Cyrus scoffed, and yelled after him. \u201cOh yeah, walking away. Really mature!\u201d</p><p>After TJ had gone, Cyrus kicked the rocks near the swing, plonking himself into one, the anger eating him alive. \u201cJerk,\u201d He whispered, swinging slowly. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah, you guys saying it won\u2019t be so bad?\u201d Buffy said, turning to the group. The others nodded, looking up, as Buffy sighed and pointed. All of them stood up and looked at Cyrus swinging alone, TJ nowhere in sight.</p><p>They had to fix this. </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cCy?\u201d Andi said softly, as she pushed open the door of his room, Buffy and Jonah standing behind her. Cyrus had spent a couple minutes swinging alone before finally getting up to go home. Andi, Buffy and Jonah had decided to go after Cyrus, while Amber and Marty spoke to TJ. </p><p>Cyrus was lying in bed, his phone in his hand, constantly tapping away at the screen. He looked up at the sound of Andi\u2019s voice expectantly, but visibly deflated when he saw it was just his friends. </p><p>\u201cHave you texted TJ?\u201d Buffy asked, sitting down at the foot of the bed. Andi joined her, Jonah sitting on the beanbag near Cyrus\u2019 head. </p><p>Cyrus scoffed. \u201cWhy should I text him? He\u2019s the one being ridiculous,\u201d He said, before shooting up, narrowing his eyes. \u201cWait, how do you guys know we fought?\u201d</p><p>The three of them exchanged glances, looking sheepishly at the ground, and Cyrus sighed, hiding his head in the pillow. </p><p>\u201cYou guys were behind the slide, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>They all nodded. Cyrus groaned, turning over into his stomach. Buffy patted his back. </p><p>\u201cBut what happened? We only came near the end of it all,\u201d Jonah asked, looking at Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, peeking out of the pillow. Andi sighed. </p><p>\u201cYou should talk about it Cy, maybe you can figure out what needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just groaned. \u201cAnd what makes you think I wanna talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing being that we know for a fact you have been writing and deleting texts to TJ since you got back,\u201d Buffy said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cWe know that this fight has upset you. And it\u2019s worse than other ones. But why?\u201d Andi said, lying down beside Cyrus. </p><p>Sighing, Cyrus turned onto his back, and Buffy and Jonah joined them on the bed, lying down together. </p><p>\u201cTJ and I were supposed to go out today, but in the last minute I needed to help out Leo with the English project we\u2019ve been assigned. So me and Leo have been spending a lot of time together, right? And TJ hasn\u2019t said anything all this time, but for some reason he just snapped today. Who knows why.\u201d</p><p>Jonah took a minute to think before saying, \u201cMaybe he\u2019s jealous? I mean, you and Leo have gotten pretty close.\u201d But Buffy shook her head. </p><p>\u201cNo, can\u2019t be. Well, maybe not completely. Cuz Cyrus is much closer to you than Leo, and TJ isn\u2019t jealous of you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded in agreement. \u201cYeah, if it was jealousy, you\u2019d be a more likely person he\u2019d be jealous of.\u201d</p><p>Jonah nodded thoughtfully, leaning back. </p><p>\u201cSo what could it be?\u201d Andi said, sighing. </p><p>Cyrus just shrugged, his face softening. \u201cHe\u2019s right though. We have been growing distant lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you make of that?\u201d Buffy asked. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but none of the things I\u2019m thinking are good,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, shaking his head. \u201cMaybe this is it, you know? This is the end. Might as well accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to just let something like an argument tear you guys apart,\u201d Andi said definitively. But Cyrus just shook his head. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Andi. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want it to be the end, because I,\u201d Cyrus caught himself, biting his lip. Jonah looked at him curiously. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cWhat is it TJ?\u201d Amber said, leaning back in the chair in TJ\u2019s room. Marty lay back on TJ\u2019s bed, tossing the basketball up and down. TJ was pacing next to the window. Amber and Marty had found him pacing, rock music blaring through his battered headphones. After some heated words, they had finally managed to calm TJ down enough so that he could talk. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d TJ mumbled, and Marty caught the ball, sitting up and looking at TJ, unimpressed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clearly not nothing, Teej. Cyrus was saying stuff like you were making a mountain out of a molehill. What?\u201d He asked, seeing Amber\u2019s shocked expression. </p><p>\u201cYou know actual English,\u201d She whispered, and Marty tossed the basketball at her, TJ cracking a small smile. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I just thought you were a slightly less impressive TikTok e-boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy e-boy status aside,\u201d Marty mumbled, flashing Amber a dirty look before turning back to TJ. \u201cSomething must have happened.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked over at Marty, who was looking at him with a small smile, and sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, just tell us,\u201d Amber said, looking encouragingly at TJ. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think it\u2019s me being jealous about Cyrus and Leo hanging out so much cuz of their English project,\u201d TJ started with a bitter laugh. \u201cBut believe it or not, it isn\u2019t that. Well, not exactly.\u201d</p><p>Marty and Amber listened patiently as TJ collected his thoughts, his voice getting choked up. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been growing apart. And we entered high school in a relationship. But you know what they say about high school and middle school relationships. And seeing Leo and him, it just made me realise how much better Cyrus deserves than me,\u201d TJ said, his voice cracking. \u201cAnd you know, a year is a long time for a relationship. Maybe we just reached our end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that TJ,\u201d Amber started. \u201cYou can\u2019t just assume these things. You two need to talk this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to talk to me Amber, for good reason. I really did burst at him for nothing.\u201d</p><p>But Amber wouldn\u2019t hear it. She nodded at Marty, who leapt up and snatched TJ\u2019s phone from his hand. </p><p>\u201cHey, what are you-\u201d TJ started, but Marty was tying away at a message, hit send and threw the phone onto the bed. When TJ scrambled to pick it up, he saw Cyrus\u2019 chat open. </p><p><b>TJ</b>: hey can we talk? </p><p><b>Underdog</b>\ud83d\udc9a: yeah we should</p><p>TJ was about to launch at Marty, but seeing Cyrus reply gave him a bit of hope and he shakily typed out another message, Amber and Marty looking at him approvingly. </p><p><b>TJ</b>: spoon tomorrow morning? like 9? </p><p><b>Underdog</b>\ud83d\udc9a: cool. see you</p><p>*</p><p>As Cyrus waited for TJ in the booth, he was constantly tapping his foot and checking his phone every two seconds. He hadnt slept well, the \u2018what if\u2019s haunting his dreams, all his attempts ending in fighting, breakdowns and distance. Now that he had time to calm down from the explosion, he looked around, trying to avert his eyes from the damage. Trying to find whether there was anything he could salvage. </p><p>He had entertained the thought that maybe he should let them go, that every relationship came to an end, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to follow through on it. Specifically because of a few words he had finally understood the meaning of. </p><p>The door of the Spoon opened, pulling Cyrus out of his thoughts, as he turned to see TJ, hands stuffed in his hoodie pockets, walk up to him. He looked tired. Sad. If the situation hadnt been what it was, Cyrus wouldn\u2019t have hesitated in pulling him into a never-ending hug. </p><p>TJ slid into the seat opposite to him, pulling at the skin on his thumb. \u201cHey Cyrus,\u201d He said, his voice small. </p><p>\u201cHey TJ,\u201d Cyrus replied, his voice struggling to remain steady. </p><p>Silence fell between them, the two unsure of who should start. Finally, TJ sighed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for snapping yesterday. I, I don\u2019t know what happened. I guess, there were just some things I\u2019d been keeping in, that it just burst out of me.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked up at TJ, who was looking at his hands, pulling the skin of his thumb raw. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry too, TJ. I didn\u2019t mean what I said.\u201d</p><p>TJ flashed his a small smile, looking back at his hands. Cyrus narrowed his eyes. </p><p>\u201cBut what happened? Why did you suddenly just snap, Teej?\u201d</p><p>TJ looked away, avoiding Cyrus\u2019 eyes. Cyrus took a deep breath. </p><p>\u201cIs it because you\u2019re jealous of Leo? Because you really don\u2019t have to be,\u201d Cyrus began, but TJ cut him off. </p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that, Cy. Its,\u201d He hesitated, looking back up. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t care that you hang out with Leo a lot. But, it made me realise that you deserve so much better than me, you know? You\u2019re so amazing, Cy. And anyone would be so lucky to be with you. There are so many people out there better for you, and I\u2019m just holding you back,\u201d TJ said, sniffing. Cyrus just listened, stunned into silence. </p><p>TJ laughed bitterly. \u201cYou know, with all that talk about what high school does to middle school relationships, I thought it wouldn\u2019t happen to us. But, we don\u2019t know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Cyrus said, interrupting TJ. \u201cAre you breaking up with me?\u201d</p><p>TJ looked up sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to Cy, but you deserve better than me, a guy who snaps at nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey that isn\u2019t your decision,\u201d Cyrus said firmly, reaching over to grab TJ\u2019s hand, stopping him from pulling at his skin more. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to say that I deserve better than you, especially when that is not at all true. Yesterday, after our fight, I kept thinking to myself, 'Maybe this is the end.\u2019 But I couldn\u2019t accept it,\u201d Cyrus said softly, covering his and TJ\u2019s asked hands with his other hand. \u201cI had no idea you felt this way, and I\u2019m sorry. I should have noticed. And we have drifted apart a bit. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Cyrus,\u201d TJ said, finally looking Cyrus in the eye. </p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but still, I am. But you don\u2019t get to walk away from me and say it\u2019s for my own good. I decide what\u2019s good enough for me. And you, TJ Kippen,\u201d Cyrus said, reaching up to tuck TJ\u2019s hair back. \u201cYou are one of the best things to have happened to me. You know why?\u201d</p><p>TJ looked curiousky at Cyrus, tilting his head to one side. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, breathing in. \u201cBecause I love you.\u201d</p><p>A soft smile spread across TJ\u2019s face, as he got up and moved to Cyrus\u2019 side of the booth, enveloping him in a hug, burrowing his head in Cyrus\u2019 shoulder. Cyrus cradled TJ\u2019s head, holding on tight. </p><p>TJ pulled away, leaning his head against Cyrus\u2019 as he whispered. </p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p><i>Hope you liked it!</i></p><p><b><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\">Send me prompts for fics!</a></b></p>",

I guess, there were just some things I&rsquo;d been keeping in, that it just burst out of me.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus looked up at TJ, who was looking at his hands, pulling the skin of his thumb raw. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry too, TJ. I didn&rsquo;t mean what I said.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ flashed his a small smile, looking back at his hands. Cyrus narrowed his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;But what happened? Why did you suddenly just snap, Teej?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked away, avoiding Cyrus&rsquo; eyes. Cyrus took a deep breath. </p><p>&ldquo;Is it because you&rsquo;re jealous of Leo? Because you really don&rsquo;t have to be,&rdquo; Cyrus began, but TJ cut him off. </p><p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that, Cy. Its,&rdquo; He hesitated, looking back up. &ldquo;Look, I don&rsquo;t care that you hang out with Leo a lot. But, it made me realise that you deserve so much better than me, you know? You&rsquo;re so amazing, Cy. And anyone would be so lucky to be with you. There are so many people out there better for you, and I&rsquo;m just holding you back,&rdquo; TJ said, sniffing. Cyrus just listened, stunned into silence. </p><p>TJ laughed bitterly. &ldquo;You know, with all that talk about what high school does to middle school relationships, I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t happen to us. But, we don&rsquo;t know everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Cyrus said, interrupting TJ. &ldquo;Are you breaking up with me?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked up sadly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to Cy, but you deserve better than me, a guy who snaps at nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey that isn&rsquo;t your decision,&rdquo; Cyrus said firmly, reaching over to grab TJ&rsquo;s hand, stopping him from pulling at his skin more. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to say that I deserve better than you, especially when that is not at all true. Yesterday, after our fight, I kept thinking to myself, 'Maybe this is the end.&rsquo; But I couldn&rsquo;t accept it,&rdquo; Cyrus said softly, covering his and TJ&rsquo;s asked hands with his other hand. &ldquo;I had no idea you felt this way, and I&rsquo;m sorry. I should have noticed. And we have drifted apart a bit. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault, Cyrus,&rdquo; TJ said, finally looking Cyrus in the eye. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe not, but still, I am. But you don&rsquo;t get to walk away from me and say it&rsquo;s for my own good. I decide what&rsquo;s good enough for me. And you, TJ Kippen,&rdquo; Cyrus said, reaching up to tuck TJ&rsquo;s hair back. &ldquo;You are one of the best things to have happened to me. You know why?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked curiousky at Cyrus, tilting his head to one side. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smiled, breathing in. &ldquo;Because I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>A soft smile spread across TJ&rsquo;s face, as he got up and moved to Cyrus&rsquo; side of the booth, enveloping him in a hug, burrowing his head in Cyrus&rsquo; shoulder. Cyrus cradled TJ&rsquo;s head, holding on tight. </p><p>TJ pulled away, leaning his head against Cyrus&rsquo; as he whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~~</p><p><i>Hope you liked it!</i></p><p><b><a href=\"https://green-lemonboys.tumblr.com/post/184971730799/so-i-am-extremely-uninspired-lol\">Send me prompts for fics!</a></b></p>",

        "answer": "<p>{Got kind of carried away, it ended up being a first kiss confession type fic rather than Cyrus teaching him how to back, but it&rsquo;s still good I swear.}</p><p>-</p><p>It was at eight o\u2019clock sunday night when Jonah got a desperate text from none other than Cyrus Goodman, practically begging him for his help. Jonah didn\u2019t actually know why Cyrus needed help. He didn&rsquo;t ask. No, instead, he was at his house with no knowledge of what he was actually about to do.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Cyrus grinned, opening the door. He hurriedly pulled Jonah into the house with no hesitation.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Jonah looked around for a threat. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Cyrus shrieked. This made him on alert, suddenly. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Cy?\u201d Jonah asked urgently, grabbing onto Cyrus\u2019s shoulders. Of course, because they were both dramatic, they continued to panic.</p><p>\u201cI lost a bet and now I have to do all this before tomorrow and I\u2019m freaking out because I can\u2019t tell Andi and Buffy because they\u2019ll call me dumb for making bets and now I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d He waved his arms around. \u201cDoomed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in danger?\u201d Jonah\u2019s eyes widened. This sounded somewhat like a terrifying gang situation, now, and he was evidently worried.</p><p>\u201cSocially!\u201d Cyrus piped.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 what?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so,\u201d Cyrus grabbed his arm, leading him into the kitchen. \u201cI made a bet with TJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d Jonah raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhy? About what?\u201d Cyrus was giving him a weird look, but he didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds. He was acting weird, and Jonah wondered if TJ had tried making Cyrus do something he didn&rsquo;t want to do. </p><p>\u201cNothing, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Cyrus shook his head. \u201cI just need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Jonah asked. Cyrus blinked. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d He answered, chuckling. \u201cI thought you were in eminent danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Cyrus giggled. He started pulling things out of the pantry. What were they doing? \u201cWe\u2019re making muffins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuffins?\u201d Jonah tilted his head in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Cyrus laughed. \u201cMost of mine and TJ\u2019s bets end in muffins. It\u2019s kinda our thing.\u201d Our thing. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jonah nodded. Him and TJ did spend a lot of time together. Of course they had a thing. That shouldn\u2019t bother Jonah. It didn\u2019t bother him. \u201cAnd this involves me how?\u201d Cyrus threw an apron at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to bake?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 no?\u201d Jonah answered, questioningly. </p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Cyrus grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cHow many muffins are we making exactly?\u201d Jonah asked, looking at all the ingredients spread over the counter. </p><p>\u201cFour dozen.\u201d Cyrus answered, grabbing bowls and muffins pans, adding them to the cluttered counter.</p><p>\u201cFour\u2026 dozen?\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s like what\u2026 forty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty-eight,\u201d Cyrus stared at him. \u201cDid you not know how many a dozen was?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I know what a dozen is!\u201d Jonah said. Because he didn\u2019t, and Cyrus didn\u2019t need to know that. \u201cAnyways, that\u2019s still a lot.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to make so much?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re for the basketball team,\u201d He answered. \u201cThey eat a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d Jonah nodded back. \u201cWhat kind of muffins are we making?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was going to make pistachio,\u201d He mumbled.</p><p>\u201cPistachio is good.\u201d Jonah nodded. </p><p>\u201cBut then I thought, \u2018what if people had nut allergies,\u2019\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSo I was going to make half chocolate chip and half pistachio.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGoing to?\u201d He raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus sighed. \u201cThen I thought about all of the vegans!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegans?\u201d Jonah asked. </p><p>\u201cYes, vegans,\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cSo I had to make a vegan batch.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow, Cy, what about people allergic to gluten?\u201d Jonah said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cThe last batch is gluten free.\u201d Jonah stared at him, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou have everything figured out then?\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHey, don&rsquo;t laugh,\u201d Cyrus rolled his eyes. \u201cI just want everyone to be able to have some.\u201d Jonah nodded slowly, smiling at him. </p><p>\u201cYou may be extra, but you&rsquo;re a thoughtful person.\u201d He said quietly, almost a whisper. Suddenly, the atmosphere seemed to completely shift and Cyrus was blushing like crazy.</p><p>\u201cUh, right, we should start, it&rsquo;s almost ten,\u201d He turned away. Jonah frowned but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cLet&rsquo;s bake until the sun rises!\u201d </p><p>-</p><p>It took two hours to put all of the batter together and finally get them into the oven. Don&rsquo;t ask them how it took that long, they don&rsquo;t either. Not that they&rsquo;d admit to playing around the entire time. Nonetheless, they were laughing uncontrollably and covered in flour and eggs once they were done. </p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Cyrus wheezed. \u201cWe completely trashed the kitchen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d Jonah laughed, pointing at his clothes. \u201cThere&rsquo;s more batter on you than in the muffin tins!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too!\u201d Cyrus giggled. Then, they broke into another fit of laughter.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Cyrus breathed. \u201cWe have to clean this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jonah was still laughing as he leaned forward, grabbing a towel. Cyrus inhaled, staring at Jonah, his face inches from his. Jonah smiled, his face falling as Cyrus turned away. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ll do the dishes, you can put all the ingredients away and wipe the counters.\u201d Cyrus murmured, turning to the sink and turning it on. Jonah sighed, grabbing the bags of flour and sugar, sealing them, then put them into the pantry. </p><p>\u201cCyrus?\u201d Jonah asked, after a few minutes of cleaning. Something was nagging at Jonah, and he had to ask.</p><p>\u201cMhm?\u201d Cyrus mumbled, not looking up from the bowl he was scrubbing. </p><p>\u201cWhat was the bet?\u201d He asked, wiping down the counter with a damp cloth. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus asked, dropping the bowl into the sink with a loud thud. </p><p>\u201cBetween you and TJ,\u201d Jonah mumbled. \u201cWhat was the bet that you lost?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cyrus stayed silent for a moment. \u201cI was supposed to tell my crush I liked him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jonah blinked. Did Cyrus like someone? That was news to him. He knew Cyrus was gay, he told him that much, but Jonah never actually knew if Cyrus liked anyone. Apparently, he did. Jonah didn&rsquo;t really like that though, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cI think it was to get me back because I tried to get him to ask out Marty a few weeks ago.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d Jonah raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cThat&rsquo;s a long story.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jonah laughed. \u201cSo you&rsquo;re both trying to get the other one to ask out your crushes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cBut Marty actually seems to like TJ.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour crush doesn&rsquo;t like you?\u201d Jonah frowned. How could anyone not like Cyrus? He was, well, Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cyrus shook his head. \u201cHe doesn&rsquo;t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well,\u201d Jonah frowned. It could only be one person, right? The thought made Jonah uneasy. \u201cIs it TJ? Is that why you couldn&rsquo;t tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d Cyrus looked at Jonah, laughing. \u201cNo! It&rsquo;s not TJ.\u201d For some reason, Jonah was relieved. </p><p>\u201cOh, good, I mean, not good, I mean- I don&rsquo;t know what I mean.\u201d Jonah rambled, his face heating immensely. </p><p>\u201cJonah,\u201d Cyrus frowned, stepping forward slightly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, du-duh,\u201d Jonah choked out. \u201cI&rsquo;m just curious, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care so much about who I like?\u201d Cyrus asked, tilting his head. His expression seemed confused, but also slightly hopefully. Jonah chewed on his lip nervously. </p><p>\u201cI just, you know, I&rsquo;m supportive!\u201d Jonah said, not entirely knowing what he means by that. \u201cIf it&rsquo;s Gus or Walker or someone else\u2026 you can.. you can tell me.\u201d What if it was Gus? Or Walker? It&rsquo;d be weird if he liked Gus, Gus was one of Jonah&rsquo;s friends as well as a fellow Space Otter. Walker would be weird too, just because Walker was just so cool, and it&rsquo;d be the second time Walker technically stole someone from him. Well, no, people weren&rsquo;t property, that wasn&rsquo;t the right way to put it, but Walker had kind of took Andi away from him in a romantic sense. Wait, did Jonah just insinuate that Cyrus was his? </p><p>\u201cJonah, are you\u2026 are you jealous?\u201d Cyrus asked, raising his eyebrows. Jonah&rsquo;s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, no of course not just curious!\u201d Jonah argued frantically. </p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d Cyrus stared at him. \u201cI can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t believe him!\u201d </p><p>\u201cBelieve who? What the hell are we talking about?\u201d Jonah frowned, his heart racing.</p><p>\u201cTJ!\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cHe said you totally reciprocated my feelings for you, and I didn&rsquo;t believe him! But I was wrong and he was right!\u201d At this, Jonah&rsquo;s heart soared.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Jonah blinked. \u201cYou have feelings for me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jonah watched as Cyrus&rsquo;s face changed into a surprisingly bright shade of red. \u201cUh, yeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you just\u2026 admit my feelings to you yourself?\u201d Jonah stared at Cyrus, still kind of shocked by this entire interaction. </p><p>\u201cUh&hellip; I guess so,\u201d Cyrus bit on his lip. \u201cSo, you do, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI do what?\u201d Jonah asked, confused. </p><p>\u201cReciprocate my feelings\u2026\u201d Cyrus paused. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, yeah,\u201d Jonah nodded. He wondered if somehow actual real life butterflies climbed into his stomach. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Cyrus nodded, lifting himself on the counter. \u201cDoes that mean\u2026\u201d He stopped. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jonah stared up at him. </p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Cyrus asked.</p><p>\u201cWe can kiss?\u201d Jonah mumbled, his cheeks burning. Not only was there butterflies flapping around in his intestines, but his heart felt like it was going to beat out of his body. Cyrus laughed. </p><p>\u201cThat easy?\u201d Cyrus raised his eyebrows. \u201cJust like that? After crushing on you forever, we just kiss right here in my kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;ve&hellip; liked me for a long time?\u201d Jonah asked, staring at Cyrus with intensity. </p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, you&rsquo;re kind of amazing.\u201d Cyrus mumbled back, clearly flustered by the fact that he just admitted to that.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jonah nodded, his face breaking out into a grin. \u201cI&rsquo;m going to kiss you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m not objecting.\u201d Cyrus chuckled, his laughter cut off by lips pressing against his. Jonah shut his eyes, moving forward as he kissed the boy in front of him. Cyrus was sitting on the counter, so he had lean forward to properly kiss him. While doing so, he cupped Cyrus&rsquo;s face in his hands gently, feeling Cyrus&rsquo;s arms go around his neck. Cyrus pressed forward in the kiss, melting into him before an alarm rang through the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cThey&rsquo;re done\u2026\u201d Jonah pulled away slightly, looking at Cyrus. Their faces were both a bright shade of red, and smiles played out across their faces. </p><p>\u201cLet them cook a little longer,\u201d Cyrus murmured, pulling Jonah closer. \u201cI won the bet anyways.\u201d </p><p>They ended up burning every single muffin.</p>",

Jonah didn\u2019t actually know why Cyrus needed help. He didn\u2019t ask. No, instead, he was at his house with no knowledge of what he was actually about to do.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Cyrus grinned, opening the door.

Of course, because they were both dramatic, they continued to panic.</p><p>\u201cI lost a bet and now I have to do all this before tomorrow and I\u2019m freaking out because I can\u2019t tell Andi and Buffy because they\u2019ll call me dumb for making bets and now I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d He waved his arms around. \u201cDoomed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in danger?\u201d Jonah\u2019s eyes widened.

About what?\u201d Cyrus was giving him a weird look, but he didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds. He was acting weird, and Jonah wondered if TJ had tried making Cyrus do something he didn\u2019t want to do. </p><p>\u201cNothing, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Cyrus shook his head. \u201cI just need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Jonah asked.

Jonah didn\u2019t actually know why Cyrus needed help. He didn\u2019t ask. No, instead, he was at his house with no knowledge of what he was actually about to do.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Cyrus grinned, opening the door. He hurriedly pulled Jonah into the house with no hesitation.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Jonah looked around for a threat. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Cyrus shrieked. This made him on alert, suddenly. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Cy?\u201d Jonah asked urgently, grabbing onto Cyrus\u2019s shoulders. Of course, because they were both dramatic, they continued to panic.</p><p>\u201cI lost a bet and now I have to do all this before tomorrow and I\u2019m freaking out because I can\u2019t tell Andi and Buffy because they\u2019ll call me dumb for making bets and now I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d He waved his arms around. \u201cDoomed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in danger?\u201d Jonah\u2019s eyes widened. This sounded somewhat like a terrifying gang situation, now, and he was evidently worried.</p><p>\u201cSocially!\u201d Cyrus piped.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 what?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so,\u201d Cyrus grabbed his arm, leading him into the kitchen. \u201cI made a bet with TJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d Jonah raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhy? About what?\u201d Cyrus was giving him a weird look, but he didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds. He was acting weird, and Jonah wondered if TJ had tried making Cyrus do something he didn\u2019t want to do. </p><p>\u201cNothing, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Cyrus shook his head. \u201cI just need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Jonah asked. Cyrus blinked. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d He answered, chuckling. \u201cI thought you were in eminent danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Cyrus giggled. He started pulling things out of the pantry. What were they doing? \u201cWe\u2019re making muffins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuffins?\u201d Jonah tilted his head in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Cyrus laughed. \u201cMost of mine and TJ\u2019s bets end in muffins. It\u2019s kinda our thing.\u201d Our thing. </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jonah nodded. Him and TJ did spend a lot of time together. Of course they had a thing. That shouldn\u2019t bother Jonah. It didn\u2019t bother him. \u201cAnd this involves me how?\u201d Cyrus threw an apron at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to bake?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 no?\u201d Jonah answered, questioningly. </p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Cyrus grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cHow many muffins are we making exactly?\u201d Jonah asked, looking at all the ingredients spread over the counter. </p><p>\u201cFour dozen.\u201d Cyrus answered, grabbing bowls and muffins pans, adding them to the cluttered counter.</p><p>\u201cFour\u2026 dozen?\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s like what\u2026 forty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty-eight,\u201d Cyrus stared at him. \u201cDid you not know how many a dozen was?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I know what a dozen is!\u201d Jonah said. Because he didn\u2019t, and Cyrus didn\u2019t need to know that. \u201cAnyways, that\u2019s still a lot.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to make so much?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re for the basketball team,\u201d He answered. \u201cThey eat a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d Jonah nodded back. \u201cWhat kind of muffins are we making?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was going to make pistachio,\u201d He mumbled.</p><p>\u201cPistachio is good.\u201d Jonah nodded. </p><p>\u201cBut then I thought, \u2018what if people had nut allergies,\u2019\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSo I was going to make half chocolate chip and half pistachio.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGoing to?\u201d He raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus sighed. \u201cThen I thought about all of the vegans!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegans?\u201d Jonah asked. </p><p>\u201cYes, vegans,\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cSo I had to make a vegan batch.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow, Cy, what about people allergic to gluten?\u201d Jonah said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cThe last batch is gluten free.\u201d Jonah stared at him, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou have everything figured out then?\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t laugh,\u201d Cyrus rolled his eyes. \u201cI just want everyone to be able to have some.\u201d Jonah nodded slowly, smiling at him. </p><p>\u201cYou may be extra, but you\u2019re a thoughtful person.\u201d He said quietly, almost a whisper. Suddenly, the atmosphere seemed to completely shift and Cyrus was blushing like crazy.</p><p>\u201cUh, right, we should start, it\u2019s almost ten,\u201d He turned away. Jonah frowned but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s bake until the sun rises!\u201d </p><p>-</p><p>It took two hours to put all of the batter together and finally get them into the oven. Don\u2019t ask them how it took that long, they don\u2019t either. Not that they\u2019d admit to playing around the entire time. Nonetheless, they were laughing uncontrollably and covered in flour and eggs once they were done. </p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Cyrus wheezed. \u201cWe completely trashed the kitchen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d Jonah laughed, pointing at his clothes. \u201cThere\u2019s more batter on you than in the muffin tins!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too!\u201d Cyrus giggled. Then, they broke into another fit of laughter.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Cyrus breathed. \u201cWe have to clean this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jonah was still laughing as he leaned forward, grabbing a towel. Cyrus inhaled, staring at Jonah, his face inches from his. Jonah smiled, his face falling as Cyrus turned away. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the dishes, you can put all the ingredients away and wipe the counters.\u201d Cyrus murmured, turning to the sink and turning it on. Jonah sighed, grabbing the bags of flour and sugar, sealing them, then put them into the pantry. </p><p>\u201cCyrus?\u201d Jonah asked, after a few minutes of cleaning. Something was nagging at Jonah, and he had to ask.</p><p>\u201cMhm?\u201d Cyrus mumbled, not looking up from the bowl he was scrubbing. </p><p>\u201cWhat was the bet?\u201d He asked, wiping down the counter with a damp cloth. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus asked, dropping the bowl into the sink with a loud thud. </p><p>\u201cBetween you and TJ,\u201d Jonah mumbled. \u201cWhat was the bet that you lost?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cyrus stayed silent for a moment. \u201cI was supposed to tell my crush I liked him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jonah blinked. Did Cyrus like someone? That was news to him. He knew Cyrus was gay, he told him that much, but Jonah never actually knew if Cyrus liked anyone. Apparently, he did. Jonah didn\u2019t really like that though, but he didn\u2019t say anything. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cI think it was to get me back because I tried to get him to ask out Marty a few weeks ago.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d Jonah raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s a long story.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jonah laughed. \u201cSo you\u2019re both trying to get the other one to ask out your crushes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cBut Marty actually seems to like TJ.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour crush doesn\u2019t like you?\u201d Jonah frowned. How could anyone not like Cyrus? He was, well, Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cyrus shook his head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well,\u201d Jonah frowned. It could only be one person, right? The thought made Jonah uneasy. \u201cIs it TJ? Is that why you couldn\u2019t tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d Cyrus looked at Jonah, laughing. \u201cNo! It\u2019s not TJ.\u201d For some reason, Jonah was relieved. </p><p>\u201cOh, good, I mean, not good, I mean- I don\u2019t know what I mean.\u201d Jonah rambled, his face heating immensely. </p><p>\u201cJonah,\u201d Cyrus frowned, stepping forward slightly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, du-duh,\u201d Jonah choked out. \u201cI\u2019m just curious, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care so much about who I like?\u201d Cyrus asked, tilting his head. His expression seemed confused, but also slightly hopefully. Jonah chewed on his lip nervously. </p><p>\u201cI just, you know, I\u2019m supportive!\u201d Jonah said, not entirely knowing what he means by that. \u201cIf it\u2019s Gus or Walker or someone else\u2026 you can.. you can tell me.\u201d What if it was Gus? Or Walker? It\u2019d be weird if he liked Gus, Gus was one of Jonah\u2019s friends as well as a fellow Space Otter. Walker would be weird too, just because Walker was just so cool, and it\u2019d be the second time Walker technically stole someone from him. Well, no, people weren\u2019t property, that wasn\u2019t the right way to put it, but Walker had kind of took Andi away from him in a romantic sense. Wait, did Jonah just insinuate that Cyrus was his? </p><p>\u201cJonah, are you\u2026 are you jealous?\u201d Cyrus asked, raising his eyebrows. Jonah\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, no of course not just curious!\u201d Jonah argued frantically. </p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d Cyrus stared at him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t believe him!\u201d </p><p>\u201cBelieve who? What the hell are we talking about?\u201d Jonah frowned, his heart racing.</p><p>\u201cTJ!\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cHe said you totally reciprocated my feelings for you, and I didn\u2019t believe him! But I was wrong and he was right!\u201d At this, Jonah\u2019s heart soared.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Jonah blinked. \u201cYou have feelings for me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jonah watched as Cyrus\u2019s face changed into a surprisingly bright shade of red. \u201cUh, yeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you just\u2026 admit my feelings to you yourself?\u201d Jonah stared at Cyrus, still kind of shocked by this entire interaction. </p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 I guess so,\u201d Cyrus bit on his lip. \u201cSo, you do, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI do what?\u201d Jonah asked, confused. </p><p>\u201cReciprocate my feelings\u2026\u201d Cyrus paused. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, yeah,\u201d Jonah nodded. He wondered if somehow actual real life butterflies climbed into his stomach. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Cyrus nodded, lifting himself on the counter. \u201cDoes that mean\u2026\u201d He stopped. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jonah stared up at him. </p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Cyrus asked.</p><p>\u201cWe can kiss?\u201d Jonah mumbled, his cheeks burning. Not only was there butterflies flapping around in his intestines, but his heart felt like it was going to beat out of his body. Cyrus laughed. </p><p>\u201cThat easy?\u201d Cyrus raised his eyebrows. \u201cJust like that?

Because he didn&rsquo;t, and Cyrus didn&rsquo;t need to know that. &ldquo;Anyways, that&rsquo;s still a lot.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Cyrus nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I need your help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you need to make so much?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re for the basketball team,&rdquo; He answered. &ldquo;They eat a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Noted,&rdquo; Jonah nodded back. &ldquo;What kind of muffins are we making?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I was going to make pistachio,&rdquo; He mumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;Pistachio is good.&rdquo; Jonah nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;But then I thought, &lsquo;what if people had nut allergies,&rsquo;&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;So I was going to make half chocolate chip and half pistachio.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Going to?&rdquo; He raised his eyebrows. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Cyrus sighed. &ldquo;Then I thought about all of the vegans!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Vegans?&rdquo; Jonah asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, vegans,&rdquo; Cyrus nodded. &ldquo;So I had to make a vegan batch.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wow, Cy, what about people allergic to gluten?&rdquo; Jonah said sarcastically.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Cyrus nodded. &ldquo;The last batch is gluten free.&rdquo; Jonah stared at him, trying not to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;You have everything figured out then?&rdquo; He chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; Cyrus rolled his eyes. &ldquo;I just want everyone to be able to have some.&rdquo; Jonah nodded slowly, smiling at him. </p><p>&ldquo;You may be extra, but you&rsquo;re a thoughtful person.&rdquo; He said quietly, almost a whisper. Suddenly, the atmosphere seemed to completely shift and Cyrus was blushing like crazy.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, right, we should start, it&rsquo;s almost ten,&rdquo; He turned away. Jonah frowned but he nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bake until the sun rises!&rdquo; </p><p>-</p><p>It took two hours to put all of the batter together and finally get them into the oven. Don&rsquo;t ask them how it took that long, they don&rsquo;t either. Not that they&rsquo;d admit to playing around the entire time. Nonetheless, they were laughing uncontrollably and covered in flour and eggs once they were done. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; Cyrus wheezed. &ldquo;We completely trashed the kitchen.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; Jonah laughed, pointing at his clothes. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more batter on you than in the muffin tins!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You too!&rdquo; Cyrus giggled. Then, they broke into another fit of laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; Cyrus breathed. &ldquo;We have to clean this up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Jonah was still laughing as he leaned forward, grabbing a towel. Cyrus inhaled, staring at Jonah, his face inches from his. Jonah smiled, his face falling as Cyrus turned away. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the dishes, you can put all the ingredients away and wipe the counters.&rdquo; Cyrus murmured, turning to the sink and turning it on. Jonah sighed, grabbing the bags of flour and sugar, sealing them, then put them into the pantry. </p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus?&rdquo; Jonah asked, after a few minutes of cleaning. Something was nagging at Jonah, and he had to ask.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm?&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled, not looking up from the bowl he was scrubbing. </p><p>&ldquo;What was the bet?&rdquo; He asked, wiping down the counter with a damp cloth. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, dropping the bowl into the sink with a loud thud. </p><p>&ldquo;Between you and TJ,&rdquo; Jonah mumbled. &ldquo;What was the bet that you lost?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Cyrus stayed silent for a moment. &ldquo;I was supposed to tell my crush I liked him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Jonah blinked. Did Cyrus like someone? That was news to him. He knew Cyrus was gay, he told him that much, but Jonah never actually knew if Cyrus liked anyone. Apparently, he did. Jonah didn&rsquo;t really like that though, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Cyrus nodded. &ldquo;I think it was to get me back because I tried to get him to ask out Marty a few weeks ago.&rdquo; He chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Marty?&rdquo; Jonah raised his eyebrows. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Cyrus nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a long story.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Jonah laughed. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re both trying to get the other one to ask out your crushes?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Cyrus nodded. &ldquo;But Marty actually seems to like TJ.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your crush doesn&rsquo;t like you?&rdquo; Jonah frowned. How could anyone not like Cyrus? He was, well, Cyrus. </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Cyrus shook his head. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Jonah frowned. It could only be one person, right? The thought made Jonah uneasy. &ldquo;Is it TJ? Is that why you couldn&rsquo;t tell him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ?&rdquo; Cyrus looked at Jonah, laughing. &ldquo;No! It&rsquo;s not TJ.&rdquo; For some reason, Jonah was relieved. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, good, I mean, not good, I mean- I don&rsquo;t know what I mean.&rdquo; Jonah rambled, his face heating immensely. </p><p>&ldquo;Jonah,&rdquo; Cyrus frowned, stepping forward slightly. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, du-duh,&rdquo; Jonah choked out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just curious, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you care so much about who I like?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, tilting his head. His expression seemed confused, but also slightly hopefully. Jonah chewed on his lip nervously. </p><p>&ldquo;I just, you know, I&rsquo;m supportive!&rdquo; Jonah said, not entirely knowing what he means by that. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Gus or Walker or someone else&hellip; you can.. you can tell me.&rdquo; What if it was Gus? Or Walker? It&rsquo;d be weird if he liked Gus, Gus was one of Jonah&rsquo;s friends as well as a fellow Space Otter. Walker would be weird too, just because Walker was just so cool, and it&rsquo;d be the second time Walker technically stole someone from him. Well, no, people weren&rsquo;t property, that wasn&rsquo;t the right way to put it, but Walker had kind of took Andi away from him in a romantic sense. Wait, did Jonah just insinuate that Cyrus was his? </p><p>&ldquo;Jonah, are you&hellip; are you jealous?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, raising his eyebrows. Jonah&rsquo;s eyes widened.</p><p>&ldquo;What? No, no of course not just curious!&rdquo; Jonah argued frantically. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god!&rdquo; Cyrus stared at him. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t believe him!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Believe who? What the hell are we talking about?&rdquo; Jonah frowned, his heart racing.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ!&rdquo; Cyrus said. &ldquo;He said you totally reciprocated my feelings for you, and I didn&rsquo;t believe him! But I was wrong and he was right!&rdquo; At this, Jonah&rsquo;s heart soared.</p><p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo; Jonah blinked. &ldquo;You have feelings for me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Jonah watched as Cyrus&rsquo;s face changed into a surprisingly bright shade of red. &ldquo;Uh, yeah, I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And did you just&hellip; admit my feelings to you yourself?&rdquo; Jonah stared at Cyrus, still kind of shocked by this entire interaction. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip; I guess so,&rdquo; Cyrus bit on his lip. &ldquo;So, you do, right?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I do what?&rdquo; Jonah asked, confused. </p><p>&ldquo;Reciprocate my feelings&hellip;&rdquo; Cyrus paused. &ldquo;For you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, right, yeah,&rdquo; Jonah nodded. He wondered if somehow actual real life butterflies climbed into his stomach. &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Cyrus nodded, lifting himself on the counter. &ldquo;Does that mean&hellip;&rdquo; He stopped. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Jonah stared up at him. </p><p>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; Cyrus asked.</p><p>&ldquo;We can kiss?&rdquo; Jonah mumbled, his cheeks burning. Not only was there butterflies flapping around in his intestines, but his heart felt like it was going to beat out of his body. Cyrus laughed. </p><p>&ldquo;That easy?&rdquo; Cyrus raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;Just like that? After crushing on you forever, we just kiss right here in my kitchen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve&hellip; liked me for a long time?&rdquo; Jonah asked, staring at Cyrus with intensity. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, yeah, you&rsquo;re kind of amazing.&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled back, clearly flustered by the fact that he just admitted to that.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jonah nodded, his face breaking out into a grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kiss you now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not objecting.&rdquo; Cyrus chuckled, his laughter cut off by lips pressing against his. Jonah shut his eyes, moving forward as he kissed the boy in front of him. Cyrus was sitting on the counter, so he had lean forward to properly kiss him. While doing so, he cupped Cyrus&rsquo;s face in his hands gently, feeling Cyrus&rsquo;s arms go around his neck. Cyrus pressed forward in the kiss, melting into him before an alarm rang through the kitchen. </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re done&hellip;&rdquo; Jonah pulled away slightly, looking at Cyrus. Their faces were both a bright shade of red, and smiles played out across their faces. </p><p>&ldquo;Let them cook a little longer,&rdquo; Cyrus murmured, pulling Jonah closer. &ldquo;I won the bet anyways.&rdquo; </p><p>They ended up burning every single muffin.</p>",
