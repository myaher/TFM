My personal headcanon is Jon and NK will duel but it will be Jamie who will end up killing the Night King, making it\u00a0\u201cmore of a contest\u201d with his left hand and thereby earning the name of Kingslayer again but this time, the realm and generations to come will sing songs about Jamie the Night Kingslayer with pride and adoration. Jamie will be hailed as one of the greatest knights the realm has ever seen.\u00a0</p><p>Something else also happened in Season 4 that makes me believe Jamie will be revered and\u00a0\u201csongs about his heroic deeds\u201d will be sung in Westeros for years to come mainly because of the following scenes in S4E04 Oathkeeper.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/769ba32333c25efed8141152b821c680/tumblr_inline_pk5nhhnCH51s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\"/></figure><p>The scene above is when Brienne and Jamie talk about finding Sansa Stark and Jamie gives Brienne, the Valyrian steel sword Oathkeeper.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Brienne: Ser Jamie Lannister.

Brienne then becomes Sansa\u2019s sword shield (much like Jonquil Darke was to the Good Queen Alysanne in Fire and Blood).</p><p>I like to think that years down the line, one of the first things that will be sung about Ser Jamie Lannister will be his defiance of Cersei\u2019s orders, giving Brienne, Oathkeeper, forged from Ned Stark\u2019s Ice to protect Ned Stark\u2019s daughter, who became the greatest Queen of Westeros. (I am positive we will see Sansa becoming The Queen in S8)</p><p>In the songs about Jon and Sansa, Ser Jamie Lannister\u2019s name will be sung for his heroic deed in helping find and protect Sansa Stark and also hopefully Jon in S8.</p><p>One of Jamie\u2019s heroic deeds is happening as he speaks about\u00a0\u201cthere\u2019s still room in mine\u201d and we don\u2019t even realize it until later, after the conclusion of the story, when Sansa will actually become Queen.</p><p>Jamie and Brienne\u2019s interaction in Season 4 is modeled around Jamie and Ser Loras Tyrell\u2019s interaction in Jamie II AFFC from the books. And it is this interaction that further foreshadows that Jamie will be remembered in songs.</p><p>We have Jamie II in AFFC, where he is sitting in the common room of the White Sword Tower, <b>with a cup of Dornish red</b> and <b>the White Book</b>.</p><blockquote><p><b>He was turning pages with the stump of his sword hand</b> when the <b>Knight of Flowers </b>entered, removed his cloak and swordbelt and hung them on a wall peg next to Jaime\u2019s.</p></blockquote><p>The Knight of Flowers, <b>Ser Loras Tyrell</b>, who is a Jon stand-in, and Jamie converse about the various Kingsguards who have achieved various feats in their lifetimes and their great deeds have been inscribed in the pages of the White Book (Book of Brothers in the show).</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMost deserved to be forgotten. <b>The heroes will always be remembered. The best.</b><br/></p><p><b>\u201cThe best and the worst\u201d. So one of us is like to live in song. \u201cAnd a few who were a bit of both. Like him.\u201d</b> He tapped the page he had been reading.<br/></p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Ser Loras craned his head around to see. \u201cTen black pellets on a scarlet field. I do not know those arms.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThey belonged to <b>Criston Cole</b>, who served the first Viserys and the second <b>Aegon</b>.\u201d Jaime closed the White Book.<br/></p><p><b>\u201cThey called him Kingmaker</b>\u201d.<br/></p><p>-Jamie II, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>Ser Loras Tyrell is dead on the show and gravely injured, the last time we hear of him in the books. <b>So \u201cone of us is like to live in song\u201d most likely indicates Jamie Lannister here, who gets to live in \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d or as I like to call it \u201cA Song of Jon and Sansa\u201d.</b></p><p>What\u2019s really interesting about this particular conversation is the talk about <b>Ser Criston Cole.\u00a0</b></p><p>There are 3 times in all the books that his name pops up, <b>twice in A Soiled Knight and once in Jamie II in AFFC</b>.</p><p><b>Ser Criston Cole was Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during King Viserys I Targaryen\u2019s rule and was thought to be instrumental in bringing about the first Dance of the Dragons by supporting Aegon II\u2019s cause by going against his alleged lover, Queen Rhaenyra.\u00a0</b></p><p>The following is a conversation between Ser Arys Oakheart, who accompanies Myrcella to Dorne and Arianne Martell, when they are plotting to put Myrcella on the Iron Throne by usurping Tommen.<br/></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The first Viserys intended his daughter Rhaenyra to follow him, do you deny it? But as the king lay dying the Lord Commander of his Kingsguard decided that it should be otherwise.</p><p>&rdquo;<b>Ser</b> <b>Criston</b> <b>Cole</b>.\u00a0<b>Criston the Kingmaker</b> had set brother against sister and divided the Kingsguard against itself, bringing on the terrible war the singers named the Dance of the Dragons. Some claimed he acted from ambition, for Prince Aegon was more tractable than his willful older sister. Others allowed him nobler motives, and argued that he was defending ancient Andal custom. A few whispered that <b>Ser Criston</b> had been Princess Rhaenyra&rsquo;s lover before he took the white and wanted vengeance on the woman who had spurned him. &ldquo;The Kingmaker wrought grave harm,&rdquo; Ser Arys said, &ldquo;and gravely did he pay for it, but &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip; but perhaps the Seven sent you here so that one white knight might make right what another set awry. You do know that when my father returns to the Water Gardens he plans to take Myrcella with him?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>-The Soiled Knight, AFFC</p></blockquote><p><i>I think Ser Criston Cole is foreshadowing for Jamie</i>. Jamie is the <b>Soiled Knight</b>, infamous as the Kingslayer for killing the Mad King Aerys, and will play a part in the second Dance with Dragons when he chooses the North (I pledged to ride North and I\u00a0intend to honor that pledge from S7E07) and the Starks (Sansa Stark is my last chance at honor, ASOS). Ser Criston Cole choosing Aegon II over Queen Rhaenyra in a way mirrors Jamie choosing the Starks over Cersei.\u00a0</p><p>(Queen Rhaenyra vs Aegon II, of course, also mirrors Daenerys vs Jon in Dance of the Dragons 2.0 that is incoming in S8)\u00a0</p><p>Like Ser Criston Cole, who was a bit of both best and worst, Jamie started the story as the Kingslayer,\u00a0pushed Bran out of the window, but has slowly made a turnaround after he lost his sword hand, following his capture by Robb Stark. In the books and show (S6), he has been striving to maintain peace in the Riverlands. In the show we saw, Jamie trying to take out Daenerys, in a suicidal attempt, to prevent further destruction and loss of lives of the Lannister Army during the Field of Fire 2.0.\u00a0</p><p>The conversation between Jamie Lannister and Ser Loras Tyrell, in Jamie II AFFC, ends with talk about Ser Criston Cole being the Kingmaker. I think this foreshadows Jamie being the Kingmaker and also the Queenmaker. <b>The chapter that immediately follows Jamie II is Cersei IV, where Cersei remembers Maggy the Frog and her prophecy about the YMBQ coming to cast her down and take all that she holds dear.</b>\u00a0</p><p>How ironic will it be that Jamie, Cersei\u2019s brother and lover, is the one instrumental in saving and protecting Sansa Stark who ends up becoming the prophesied YMBQ to cast Cersei down? And in pure GRRM fashion, I think, that feat in and of itself deserves to be sung about. Jamie gets to end the story as a hero.</p><p>One thing is for sure, whoever Jamie Lannister supports will have a strong case to win the throne. He not only is a great fighter but has powers of persuasion to draw the most recalcitrant Lords into his own fold (think Edmure Tully, Randyll Tarly).</p><p>Another thing that subtly foreshadowed Jamie becoming the Kingmaker and perhaps Hand of the King was this official cover image of GOT Season 2. This is major tinfoil but I think there might be something to it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3236\" data-orig-height=\"2173\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/255998f5c16a5708e50639f4df58f771/tumblr_inline_pk5qjgSsab1s6u549_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3236\" data-orig-height=\"2173\"/></figure><p>Season 2 was about War of the Five Kings, five factions clamouring for the Iron Throne&hellip;but look closer.</p><p><b>That\u2019s a left hand holding the crown of the King of the Seven Kingdoms.</b></p><p>A LEFT HAND!!!!</p><p>And we all know what happened in the following season (Season 3), right?</p><p>Jamie Lannister loses his right hand in Episode 3 Walk of Punishment.</p><p>Also, I would really like Jamie Lannister to survive the series and become Lord of Casterly Rock, marry Brienne and father a brood of golden-haired babies.</p><p>I am tagging <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8NZouulBUWzXsJGADWT5Nw\">@julibf</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT1SV8HoRe8FXp734zNagMQ\">@silentbutsweet77</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK4SFD522ZJeP1tFEY-MW0Q\">@fedonciadale</a> since they seem to be positively inclined to Jamie as the Hand theory.</p>",

Of the Lannisters, I think, Jamie is most likely going to be the one to survive and end up playing a huge role not only during the Great War but also in the post-war rehabilitation of Westeros, perhaps as Hand to King Aegon/Jon of Houses Stark and Targaryen.</p><p>There seems to be a plethora of show evidence for Jamie as Hand of the King that <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8NZouulBUWzXsJGADWT5Nw\">@julibf</a>\u00a0 gathered <a href=\"https://julibf.tumblr.com/post/181149716081/jaime-as-the-hand-of-the-king\">here</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK4SFD522ZJeP1tFEY-MW0Q\">@fedonciadale</a> talked about pieces of evidence from the books that could potentially foreshadow the same\u00a0<a href=\"https://fedonciadale.tumblr.com/post/177910323045/jaime-lannister-as-hand-of-the-king\">here</a>.</p><p>Jamie served as the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during both Joffrey\u2019s and Tommen\u2019s reign. The Kingsguards have a famous book called the Book of Brothers that chronicles all the heroic deeds of the great Kingsguards.\u00a0</p><p>In <b>S4E01 Two Swords</b>, Joffrey mocks Jamie about his lack of heroic deeds when they are in the Tower of the Kingsguard room discussing Kingsguard duty for Joffrey\u2019s wedding with Margaery that takes place in the next episode.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b69e505948aef34cc981d4eaea5b3550/tumblr_inline_pk5mpgSgj01s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\"></figure><blockquote><p>Joffrey: Ser Jamie Lannister. <b>Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.</b></p><p>Jamie: <b>There\u2019s still time.</b></p><p>Joffrey: Is there? <b>For a 40-year-old knight with one hand. How can you protect me with that?</b></p><p>Jamie: <b>I use my left hand now, Your Grace.

Where Jamie failed in protecting Joffrey, he will succeed in protecting Jon. My personal headcanon is Jon and NK will duel but it will be Jamie who will end up killing the Night King, making it\u00a0\u201cmore of a contest\u201d with his left hand and thereby earning the name of Kingslayer again but this time, the realm and generations to come will sing songs about Jamie the Night Kingslayer with pride and adoration. Jamie will be hailed as one of the greatest knights the realm has ever seen.\u00a0</p><p>Something else also happened in Season 4 that makes me believe Jamie will be revered and\u00a0\u201csongs about his heroic deeds\u201d will be sung in Westeros for years to come mainly because of the following scenes in S4E04 Oathkeeper.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/769ba32333c25efed8141152b821c680/tumblr_inline_pk5nhhnCH51s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\"></figure><p>The scene above is when Brienne and Jamie talk about finding Sansa Stark and Jamie gives Brienne, the Valyrian steel sword Oathkeeper.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Brienne: Ser Jamie Lannister.

                "content": "<p>As I mentioned <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/181110488463/a-trail-of-trailers-dd-have-been-hinting-at-dark\">here</a>, D&amp;D (and GRRM) have been hinting at a possible Stark-Lannister Coalition to stand together against the two elemental dangers of&nbsp;&ldquo;Ice&rdquo; (NK and his army of the dead) and&nbsp;&ldquo;Fire&rdquo; (Daenerys, her dragons, Dothraki horde and the Unsullied) for a while now. Of the Lannisters, I think, Jamie is most likely going to be the one to survive and end up playing a huge role not only during the Great War but also in the post-war rehabilitation of Westeros, perhaps as Hand to King Aegon/Jon of Houses Stark and Targaryen.</p><p>There seems to be a plethora of show evidence for Jamie as Hand of the King that <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8NZouulBUWzXsJGADWT5Nw\">@julibf</a>&nbsp; gathered <a href=\"https://julibf.tumblr.com/post/181149716081/jaime-as-the-hand-of-the-king\">here</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK4SFD522ZJeP1tFEY-MW0Q\">@fedonciadale</a> talked about pieces of evidence from the books that could potentially foreshadow the same&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fedonciadale.tumblr.com/post/177910323045/jaime-lannister-as-hand-of-the-king\">here</a>.</p><p>Jamie served as the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during both Joffrey&rsquo;s and Tommen&rsquo;s reign. The Kingsguards have a famous book called the Book of Brothers that chronicles all the heroic deeds of the great Kingsguards.&nbsp;</p><p>In <b>S4E01 Two Swords</b>, Joffrey mocks Jamie about his lack of heroic deeds when they are in the Tower of the Kingsguard room discussing Kingsguard duty for Joffrey&rsquo;s wedding with Margaery that takes place in the next episode.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b69e505948aef34cc981d4eaea5b3550/tumblr_inline_pk5mpgSgj01s6u549_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Joffrey: Ser Jamie Lannister. <b>Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.</b></p><p>Jamie: <b>There&rsquo;s still time.</b></p><p>Joffrey: Is there? <b>For a 40-year-old knight with one hand. How can you protect me with that?</b></p><p>Jamie: <b>I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest.</b></p></blockquote><p>Joffrey dies in the next episode and Jamie is unable to protect him when he dies of the poisoning.</p><p>&lt;donning my tinfoil hat&hellip;&gt;</p><p>Since Jon and Joffrey are foils of each other, I would like to believe that in S8, when Jon and the rest will be fighting the Night King, Jamie and his left hand will come in handy in successfully protecting Jon, the rightful King. Where Jamie failed in protecting Joffrey, he will succeed in protecting Jon. My personal headcanon is Jon and NK will duel but it will be Jamie who will end up killing the Night King, making it&nbsp;&ldquo;more of a contest&rdquo; with his left hand and thereby earning the name of Kingslayer again but this time, the realm and generations to come will sing songs about Jamie the Night Kingslayer with pride and adoration. Jamie will be hailed as one of the greatest knights the realm has ever seen.&nbsp;</p><p>Something else also happened in Season 4 that makes me believe Jamie will be revered and&nbsp;&ldquo;songs about his heroic deeds&rdquo; will be sung in Westeros for years to come mainly because of the following scenes in S4E04 Oathkeeper.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/769ba32333c25efed8141152b821c680/tumblr_inline_pk5nhhnCH51s6u549_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The scene above is when Brienne and Jamie talk about finding Sansa Stark and Jamie gives Brienne, the Valyrian steel sword Oathkeeper.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Brienne: Ser Jamie Lannister. Knighted and named the Kingsguard in his sixteenth year. At the sack of King&rsquo;s Landing, murdered his King, Aerys the second. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon&hellip;..thereafter known as the Kingslayer.</p><p>Jamie: It&rsquo;s the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. <b>And there&rsquo;s still room left in mine.</b></p></blockquote><p>As Jamie says the last line, the camera shows him turning to face Oathkeeper.</p><p>Jamie gives Brienne Oathkeeper and says&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;it was reforged from Ned Stark&rsquo;s sword and you will use it to defend Ned Stark&rsquo;s daughter&rdquo;.</b></p><p>Jamie provides Brienne with newly made armour, a Valyrian steel sword Oathkeeper and Podrick Payne to send her off in a quest to find Sansa Stark and protect her.</p><p>This is <b>heroic</b> because in the same episode, S4E04, we have Cersei asking Jamie to find that &ldquo;murderous little bitch&rdquo; Sansa Stark and bring her head back to KL.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d0f73705c4b52f74630230b07225b8e8/tumblr_inline_pk5otuXybj1s6u549_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&nbsp;Instead of heeding to his lover and sister, Cersei&rsquo;s wishes, Jamie defies her orders and sends Brienne off to find Sansa.</p><p>In S6, we actually get to see Brienne and Podrick, rescuing Sansa from Ramsay&rsquo;s men and hounds&nbsp;and take her safely back to Castle Black to reunite with Jon. Brienne then becomes Sansa&rsquo;s sword shield (much like Jonquil Darke was to the Good Queen Alysanne in Fire and Blood).</p><p>I like to think that years down the line, one of the first things that will be sung about Ser Jamie Lannister will be his defiance of Cersei&rsquo;s orders, giving Brienne, Oathkeeper, forged from Ned Stark&rsquo;s Ice to protect Ned Stark&rsquo;s daughter, who became the greatest Queen of Westeros. (I am positive we will see Sansa becoming The Queen in S8)</p><p>In the songs about Jon and Sansa, Ser Jamie Lannister&rsquo;s name will be sung for his heroic deed in helping find and protect Sansa Stark and also hopefully Jon in S8.</p><p>One of Jamie&rsquo;s heroic deeds is happening as he speaks about&nbsp;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s still room in mine&rdquo; and we don&rsquo;t even realize it until later, after the conclusion of the story, when Sansa will actually become Queen.</p><p>Jamie and Brienne&rsquo;s interaction in Season 4 is modeled around Jamie and Ser Loras Tyrell&rsquo;s interaction in Jamie II AFFC from the books. And it is this interaction that further foreshadows that Jamie will be remembered in songs.</p><p>We have Jamie II in AFFC, where he is sitting in the common room of the White Sword Tower, <b>with a cup of Dornish red</b> and <b>the White Book</b>.</p><blockquote><p><b>He was turning pages with the stump of his sword hand</b> when the <b>Knight of Flowers </b>entered, removed his cloak and swordbelt and hung them on a wall peg next to Jaime&rsquo;s.</p></blockquote><p>The Knight of Flowers, <b>Ser Loras Tyrell</b>, who is a Jon stand-in, and Jamie converse about the various Kingsguards who have achieved various feats in their lifetimes and their great deeds have been inscribed in the pages of the White Book (Book of Brothers in the show).</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Most deserved to be forgotten. <b>The heroes will always be remembered. The best.</b><br /></p><p><b>&ldquo;The best and the worst&rdquo;. So one of us is like to live in song. &ldquo;And a few who were a bit of both. Like him.&rdquo;</b> He tapped the page he had been reading.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Ser Loras craned his head around to see. &ldquo;Ten black pellets on a scarlet field. I do not know those arms.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They belonged to <b>Criston Cole</b>, who served the first Viserys and the second <b>Aegon</b>.&rdquo; Jaime closed the White Book.<br /></p><p><b>&ldquo;They called him Kingmaker</b>&rdquo;.<br /></p><p>-Jamie II, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>Ser Loras Tyrell is dead on the show and gravely injured, the last time we hear of him in the books. <b>So &ldquo;one of us is like to live in song&rdquo; most likely indicates Jamie Lannister here, who gets to live in &ldquo;A Song of Ice and Fire&rdquo; or as I like to call it &ldquo;A Song of Jon and Sansa&rdquo;.</b></p><p>What&rsquo;s really interesting about this particular conversation is the talk about <b>Ser Criston Cole.&nbsp;</b></p><p>There are 3 times in all the books that his name pops up, <b>twice in A Soiled Knight and once in Jamie II in AFFC</b>.</p><p><b>Ser Criston Cole was Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during King Viserys I Targaryen&rsquo;s rule and was thought to be instrumental in bringing about the first Dance of the Dragons by supporting Aegon II&rsquo;s cause by going against his alleged lover, Queen Rhaenyra.&nbsp;</b></p><p>The following is a conversation between Ser Arys Oakheart, who accompanies Myrcella to Dorne and Arianne Martell, when they are plotting to put Myrcella on the Iron Throne by usurping Tommen.<br /></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The first Viserys intended his daughter Rhaenyra to follow him, do you deny it? But as the king lay dying the Lord Commander of his Kingsguard decided that it should be otherwise.</p><p>&rdquo;<b>Ser</b> <b>Criston</b> <b>Cole</b>.&nbsp;<b>Criston the Kingmaker</b> had set brother against sister and divided the Kingsguard against itself, bringing on the terrible war the singers named the Dance of the Dragons. Some claimed he acted from ambition, for Prince Aegon was more tractable than his willful older sister. Others allowed him nobler motives, and argued that he was defending ancient Andal custom. A few whispered that <b>Ser Criston</b> had been Princess Rhaenyra&rsquo;s lover before he took the white and wanted vengeance on the woman who had spurned him. &ldquo;The Kingmaker wrought grave harm,&rdquo; Ser Arys said, &ldquo;and gravely did he pay for it, but &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip; but perhaps the Seven sent you here so that one white knight might make right what another set awry. You do know that when my father returns to the Water Gardens he plans to take Myrcella with him?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>-The Soiled Knight, AFFC</p></blockquote><p><i>I think Ser Criston Cole is foreshadowing for Jamie</i>. Jamie is the <b>Soiled Knight</b>, infamous as the Kingslayer for killing the Mad King Aerys, and will play a part in the second Dance with Dragons when he chooses the North (I pledged to ride North and I&nbsp;intend to honor that pledge from S7E07) and the Starks (Sansa Stark is my last chance at honor, ASOS). Ser Criston Cole choosing Aegon II over Queen Rhaenyra in a way mirrors Jamie choosing the Starks over Cersei.&nbsp;</p><p>(Queen Rhaenyra vs Aegon II, of course, also mirrors Daenerys vs Jon in Dance of the Dragons 2.0 that is incoming in S8)&nbsp;</p><p>Like Ser Criston Cole, who was a bit of both best and worst, Jamie started the story as the Kingslayer,&nbsp;pushed Bran out of the window, but has slowly made a turnaround after he lost his sword hand, following his capture by Robb Stark. In the books and show (S6), he has been striving to maintain peace in the Riverlands. In the show we saw, Jamie trying to take out Daenerys, in a suicidal attempt, to prevent further destruction and loss of lives of the Lannister Army during the Field of Fire 2.0.&nbsp;</p><p>The conversation between Jamie Lannister and Ser Loras Tyrell, in Jamie II AFFC, ends with talk about Ser Criston Cole being the Kingmaker. I think this foreshadows Jamie being the Kingmaker and also the Queenmaker. <b>The chapter that immediately follows Jamie II is Cersei IV, where Cersei remembers Maggy the Frog and her prophecy about the YMBQ coming to cast her down and take all that she holds dear.</b>&nbsp;</p><p>How ironic will it be that Jamie, Cersei&rsquo;s brother and lover, is the one instrumental in saving and protecting Sansa Stark who ends up becoming the prophesied YMBQ to cast Cersei down? And in pure GRRM fashion, I think, that feat in and of itself deserves to be sung about. Jamie gets to end the story as a hero.</p><p>One thing is for sure, whoever Jamie Lannister supports will have a strong case to win the throne. He not only is a great fighter but has powers of persuasion to draw the most recalcitrant Lords into his own fold (think Edmure Tully, Randyll Tarly).</p><p>Another thing that subtly foreshadowed Jamie becoming the Kingmaker and perhaps Hand of the King was this official cover image of GOT Season 2.

That card typically has a woman being calm and serene while in the presence of a lion. From what I understand the Strength Tarot Card is all about remaining gentle in the face of brute force. It's kind of surprising how that can fit with Sansa's storyline. I'm not sure if it's deliberate but I thought that it was a thought worth sharing. Thanks.",

I\u2019m not sure if Arya still has this romanticized notion of what being a Lord is, someone who fights in wars and has adventures, but it mostly involves management of your castle and lands.

Sansa would not remove herself from that obligation. Maybe she tricks Arya a little? Arya hits Sansa during their lesson and Sansa pretends to be hurt worse than she is. Arya starts to apologize and Sansa pushes her down. Sansa makes a point to Arya about Cersei and how tricky and manipulative she is. How they can\u2019t fight Cersei the same way they will fight the Night King and Cersei might be just as dangerous as he is.</p><p>My highest hope for next season is for Arya and Sansa to be there for each other.
