He glanced around in confusion and spotted Steve just parking\nhis bike with the other Avengers\u2019 vehicles that Tony\u2019d provided.</p><p>\u201cHey, Steve,\u201d he greeted, the blond smiling back as he got\noff his bike. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen my red Audi, have you? I think I managed to\nmisplace it.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he was just being blind and Steve would point the car\nout on the next row over or something. If not, he\u2019d have to ask JARVIS.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I think Clint mentioned taking it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>Tony had provided a dozen different vehicles that any of the\nAvengers were free to use at their leisure. Why did Clint need his red Audi?</p><p>Steve just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHe said he wanted to see how fast it could go. He figured you\nwouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Tony pushed down the wave of unease rising up from within\nhis chest.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, of course not.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just take a different car to his meeting. That was\nfine. It wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t have plenty.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cHey, J? Where\u2019s the new armor piece I sent off for fabrication\nyesterday? I can\u2019t finish these repairs until I have it.\u201d</p><p>Delays weren\u2019t the norm for fabrication on the armor. Tony\nhad his own, personal fab unit. </p><p>\u201cApologies, Sir. I\u2019m afraid the piece is still queued following\nseveral specs for a new device Dr. Banner is attempting to create to measure gamma\nparticle interaction.\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Brucie doing using my fabrication machine and not\nthe Avengers\u2019 one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears he has split his submitted specs between both\nmachines to cut down on production time. Shall I halt production on Dr. Banner\u2019s\nitems and bump the armor piece up to first priority?\u201d</p><p>Something in Tony\u2019s chest twisted.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. The repairs can wait a day or two. It\u2019s\nfine. Let\u2019s just hope no one attacks the city, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, Sir.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Steve called in greeting as the genius stepped out\nonto the communal floor. There were a number of large crates spread throughout\nthe room, most already open. Steve was elbow deep in one of them. \u201cYou\u2019re back!\nHow was your flight in?\u201d</p><p>Tony pulled the tie from around his neck and threw it over\nthe back of a chair.</p><p>\u201cExhausting. I always hate fights back from Japan. What\u2019s\nall this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome stuff of Howard and Peggy\u2019s that SHIELD sent over for\nyou a couple hours ago. It\u2019s mostly old notes and professional stuff, but I\ncouldn\u2019t help digging into it anyway. I hope that\u2019s okay? I couldn\u2019t stand\nhaving stuff that was theirs right in front of me and not <i>knowing</i>.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart gave a little lurch. The last time SHIELD had sent\nhim crates containing things from his father, they had contained some <i>very</i> personal things. If some of this\nstuff was Aunt Peggy\u2019s\u2026</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d he said with a too-wide smile to hide\nthe curl of trepidation he couldn\u2019t quite suppress. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m just about\nthe last person who can judge when it comes to resisting temptation.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cFriend Stark!\u201d Thor\u2019s friendly bellow echoed through the air.\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d</p><p>Tony hid a wince as he finished shaking hands with the representatives\nof the company SI was trying to buy out. They were a mid-level software\ndeveloper, but Tony could take their designs a lot farther. At least if he\ncould get them for the right price. The last thing he needed was an interruption\nbefore the meeting had even <i>started</i>.\nHe shot Pepper an apologetic look and moved to intercept Thor by the door.</p><p>\u201cThor,\u201d he greeted, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d The Avengers\nusually stayed well clear of SI\u2019s business floors. \u201cI thought you were still in\nAsgard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I only just returned. However, I am afraid I may have\ncaused some damage to the landing pad upon my return and wished to inform you immediately.\u201d</p><p>Tony immediately felt a rush of dread.</p><p>\u201cHow much damage, exactly? Was anyone hurt?\u201d</p><p>All he could see in his head was great chunks of metal and\nsteel beaming falling from the sky and onto innocent passersby.</p><p>\u201cNothing extensive, I assure you. However, I am unsure of its\ncurrent structural integrity. Hence, my haste. I didn\u2019t think it was a thing to\nbe left waiting.\u201d</p><p>Tony failed to see how a <i>loss\nof structural integrity</i> did not quality was anything extensive. He needed\nto get a look at it himself.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d he agreed. \u201cGive me a minute here and I\u2019ll\nbe right up.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to the room and, pointedly ignoring Pepper\u2019s disapproving\nfrown, made his apologies to the other company\u2019s representatives. He understood\nher frustration. This was not going to help their position in getting a better\ndeal at all.</p><p>As he was shaking hands with the final member of the team,\nan older man snowy white hair who looked to be in his nineties at least, the\nman held fast to his hand and leaned in close.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to draw a line somewhere, kiddo,\u201d he\nsaid in an amused voice to match his crooked grin. \u201cI hope you know that.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared at him for a long moment before managing to pull\nhimself back together. Was it that obvious?</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Lee. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>As he left with Thor, the older gentleman\u2019s advice tumbled\naround his head. Tony knew things weren\u2019t great as they were, that he was\nletting things slide that he really shouldn\u2019t, but he couldn\u2019t help it. The\nAvengers were one of the best things to ever happen to him and it wasn\u2019t like\nthey <i>meant</i> any of what they did to be\nhurtful. Tony had told them to make themselves at home. He could hardly blame\nthem for doing just that.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t want to lose them.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cIs that- Is that mine?\u201d Tony asked, staring at the beautiful\nemerald necklace around Natasha\u2019s neck.</p><p>It played off her hair and skin tone just right, the strands\nof precious stone subtly guiding the eye toward the low dip of the front of her\ngown. She smiled at him as she slid across the seat and further into the limo\nthat would take the team to the gala.</p><p>\u201cI spotted it in your vanity closet while I was helping you\napply the concealer for you bruise,\u201d she explained, \u201cand I just couldn\u2019t\nresist. I knew <i>you</i> weren\u2019t going to\nbe wearing it, after all, and something this gorgeous is wasted as decoration.\nYou don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>Tony swallowed roughly. How many times had he sat beside his\nmother while she did her make up for an event just like the one they were going\nto and watched her clip that very same necklace on, smoothing the stones out\nwith her delicate fingers?

This was not going to help their position in getting a better\ndeal at all.</p><p>As he was shaking hands with the final member of the team,\nan older man snowy white hair who looked to be in his nineties at least, the\nman held fast to his hand and leaned in close.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to have to draw a line somewhere, kiddo,&rdquo; he\nsaid in an amused voice to match his crooked grin. &ldquo;I hope you know that.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony stared at him for a long moment before managing to pull\nhimself back together. Was it that obvious?</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Lee. I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind.&rdquo;</p><p>As he left with Thor, the older gentleman&rsquo;s advice tumbled\naround his head. Tony knew things weren&rsquo;t great as they were, that he was\nletting things slide that he really shouldn&rsquo;t, but he couldn&rsquo;t help it. The\nAvengers were one of the best things to ever happen to him and it wasn&rsquo;t like\nthey <i>meant</i> any of what they did to be\nhurtful. Tony had told them to make themselves at home. He could hardly blame\nthem for doing just that.</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t want to lose them.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that- Is that mine?&rdquo; Tony asked, staring at the beautiful\nemerald necklace around Natasha&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>It played off her hair and skin tone just right, the strands\nof precious stone subtly guiding the eye toward the low dip of the front of her\ngown. She smiled at him as she slid across the seat and further into the limo\nthat would take the team to the gala.</p><p>&ldquo;I spotted it in your vanity closet while I was helping you\napply the concealer for you bruise,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and I just couldn&rsquo;t\nresist. I knew <i>you</i> weren&rsquo;t going to\nbe wearing it, after all, and something this gorgeous is wasted as decoration.\nYou don&rsquo;t mind, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony swallowed roughly. How many times had he sat beside his\nmother while she did her make up for an event just like the one they were going\nto and watched her clip that very same necklace on, smoothing the stones out\nwith her delicate fingers? How many times had she told him the story about how\nit had been her mother&rsquo;s and that, one day, Tony would get a chance to pass it\non to his own daughter?</p><p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; he managed to get out through a throat\nthat suddenly felt too-tight. &ldquo;Just make sure you put it back when you&rsquo;re done\nwith it.&rdquo;</p>",

                "content": "<p><b>STORY COMPLETE: Chapter 22</b></p><p>The stroll to the teal and magenta counter is measured, the diner unsettling with it&rsquo;s empty chairs and hastily reset tables. The kitchen clatters with the distant sounds of a busboy washing dishes. He leans into Loki&rsquo;s side and threads their fingers, momentarily hypnotized by the tower of pies, lit up like heaven and spinning around the display case.</p><p>Cherry red menus litter the counter beside a dimple-cheeked mascot girl, and it&rsquo;s all so fucking sad. An overdone theme park of a restaurant frozen forever in a bizarre imitation of an era that probably sucked for the people that lived it. A temple to backwards thinking, idolizing a &lsquo;simpler&rsquo; time when society would have called them sexual deviants, sick perverts no different than pedophiles and rapists. His family would have been a lab experiment or a cautionary tale at pray-the-gay-away camp. Still could be, if they aren&rsquo;t careful.</p><p>He clutches the ring box in his pocket and wonders how stupid this will all seem in a few hundred years. So much worry and stress over such a simple thing. Two people drawn and repelled by each other like opposite poles of a magnet. Always pulled but never, ever in sync. He pries the box open and feels around until he thinks it&rsquo;s facing the right direction.</p><p>Loki turns to him, face drawn and serious.</p><p>&ldquo;May I kneel, sir?&rdquo; he asks, and Tony&rsquo;s brain does a hard reboot. The ring stays in his pocket.</p><p>He looks over his shoulder at the table full of aliens. &ldquo;Here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing untoward.&rdquo; Loki promises, &ldquo;May I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Dropping to his knees with all the grace of a ballet dancer, Loki kisses his hand and does that wrist flick thing. A rumpled plastic wrapper crinkles in his hand and he rips it open. Smirking, he presents a shiny, red, razzleberry ring pop.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you marry me, Mr. Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony laughs, too loud in the nearly abandoned restaurant.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so fucking crazy.&rdquo; he snickers, and Loki flushes.</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>His partner is nervous although he can&rsquo;t fathom why. There&rsquo;s only one answer.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so damn lucky I already bought us real ones.&rdquo; he says, pulling the ring box out of his pocket and showing off the simple gold bands.</p><p>\n\n<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15091862/chapters/34994054\">[Read on AO3]</a> or <a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041285/1/Reparations\">[Read on FFN]</a> (links contain explicit content)\n\n<br /></p>",

Thank you for giving each and every one of us someone to identify with and find encouragement and strength in. You\u2019ve touched so many people\u2019s lives and made the world a little better in all its chaos. </p><p>Thank you for giving me Spider-Man, who was just like me, a geeky kid that didn\u2019t mean to get thrown into sticky situations, that gets scared sometimes, and tries to be strong for others. Thank you for showing me that it\u2019s okay to be afraid, and it\u2019s okay to not know what you\u2019re doing all the time, and it\u2019s okay to be funny when I probably shouldn\u2019t. </p><p>Thank you for giving me Thor, who showed me that just being strong didn\u2019t make you a hero, that you have to be compassionate, aware of others, and ready to help. Thank you for showing me the power of camaraderie and teamwork and confidence. </p><p>Thank you for giving me Captain America, who showed me that even when everything is exploding around us, our morals make us who we are. Thank you for teaching us to watch out for others when they can\u2019t watch out for themselves, even if we have to take on men twice our size to do it. </p><p>Thank you for giving me Iron Man, who\u2019s shown us money isn\u2019t everything, and your mind and heart are what matters. He reminded us that even heroes break down and get anxious and upset and stressed, and that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when the going gets rough.</p><p>Thank you for Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Shuri, Okoye, Nakia, Gamora, Valkyrie, Captain Marvel, Peggy Carter, and so many more amazing, powerful women, who can kick the ass of any man that dare cross them. Thank you for giving us representation for all the little girls out there who are tired of seeing just a dainty princess that needs a man to be rescued. Thank you for showing the girls that we can be strong for ourselves and strong for each other. </p><p>I could go on and on and on. Stan Lee, thank you. </p>",

Saving people is a full time job.</b></i></p><p><i><b>Word Count: 3,780</b></i></p><p><i><b>Pairings: Clint, Tony and reader (platonic)</b></i></p><p><i><b>Warnings: Drunk people, maybe swearing, bad tips. \u00a0Tip your servers folks&hellip;It\u2019s how they live.</b></i></p><p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><p><i>I literally started this three days before I had surgery and finished a few days afterwards. I did my best, but I\u2019m a little tired still. Sorry, nonnie, but I hope you like it.\u00a0</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p>The pub was pure insanity tonight. The patrons were loud, rowdy, and for some reason, way more rude than normal. Your regulars could barely get to you behind the bar, becoming more and more annoyed every time some young college punk would kick their chair, bellowing over their shoulders for you to refill their mug.</p><p>Nights like these were the worst. You knew by the end of this shift that you would not only be exhausted, but most likely pissed off by the lack of tips that you knew you would be shorted. \u00a0Drunk people were terrible. They were sloppy and belligerent. They never tipped well, and they always seem to think that \u201ctheir friend\u201d had settle up the bill before they left. \u00a0It was nights like these that you prayed someone rich would come and take you away, pay all of your debt, take you around the world, and save you from this life.</p><p>\u201cCome on, dude!\u201d You jump back as a glass of beer splashes across your jeans, the result of a local kid animatedly telling a story to his friends.</p><p>\u201cChill out, it\u2019s only beer. Relax already.\u201d He leans over the bar, putting on his best puppy dogs eyes. \u201cDo you think I could get another one, though?\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cNo. I told you if you spilled another one you were done. Sorry, that\u2019s the rules.\u201d You pick up the glass from the counter, and throw it into the sink.</p><p>\u201cOkay, whatever\u2026bitch.\u201d He goes to turn away but is grabbed by a thick hand who forcefully turns him around to you.</p><p>\u201cTell the lady you\u2019re sorry, pay your tab, and get out.\u201d You didn\u2019t even have to look up to know who\u2019s voice it was. </p><p>\u201cI just wanted a beer, bro.\u201d The kid grunts out as his stomach is pressed into the counter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and she just wanted to serve people who weren\u2019t assholes, yet here we are.\u201d</p><p>You smile sweetly as the kid reaches back into his pocket bringing his wallet to the counter. \u00a0He thumbs through a couple of tens dropping them down, then sliding over a few singles to your side of the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhoa there&hellip;what is like, like two percent\u201d? I think we can do better than that. I\u2019m pretty sure I saw another ten in there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut she\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she served your ass with a smile, and didn\u2019t hit you. For that she deserves to be paid. Hand me that tip jar, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>Clint was by far one of your best regulars. Why he ever came to this junky old place was beyond you. He said that he loved that it was old school, not to flashy, and the people were down to earth. He came in every Friday, sometimes Saturday if he had gone on a tough mission that week, or was just overly anxious.</p><p>He sent a quick smile and wink your way as you reached over the counter, handing him the barely filled jar from your hands. </p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d He asks as he looks into your jar, filled with barely fifteen bucks and few piles of change.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough night.\u201d You say, pointing over to the large group at the other end of the floor. \u201cThey were already drunk when they got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell this won\u2019t do.\u201d He pats the kid on his back, and gives him the nod of approval. The kid goes to leave but Clint pulls him back.</p><p>\u201cLeave the pizza coupon, too.\u201d You laugh under your breath when the kid opens his wallet, pulling out the small piece of paper, throwing it into the bar.</p><p>\u201cCan I leave now?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, and go tell your friends not to even think about dipping without paying their tab, and leaving a tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they do, I\u2019ll find each and every one of you. I have the time, resources, and the money to follow through with it. I get bored easily.\u201d You grab the tip jar back laughing as Tony pushes the young man off back towards the door. \u201cGo forth young man. Go use your brains for good, or&hellip;get laid or something. What do you kids do these days? Don\u2019t tell me, just get out and go do it.\u201d He waves his hand, already over the interaction. </p><p>\u201cNice of you to join us, Mr. Stark.\u201d You greet him with a sassy smile, handing him his drink of choice.</p><p>\u201cI hate when you call me that.\u201d He says smirking over his drink. \u201cYou make a good drink, kid.\u201d</p><p>You point your finger his way scolding him.</p><p>\u201cI hate when you call me kid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll stop. As long as you don\u2019t mind me calling you something equally as embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll stop too, as long as you don\u2019t mind me spitting in your drink while I pour.\u201d</p><p>Glaring at each other in a small standoff, you wait for him to break, and you know he will. </p><p>\u201cUgh, fine. You win. It won\u2019t happen again, squirt.\u201d</p><p>You point at his drink, motioning your fingers for him to give it you. </p><p>\u201cYou need that refreshed?\u201d Clint chuckles as he watches you swish your mouth back and forth.</p><p>\u201cAlright children. That\u2019s enough.\u201d </p><p>You hear a voice call out to you at the other end of the counter. Another patron waving money at you, asking for a drink. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me gentleman, I\u2019m being beckoned for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck&hellip;and bring back nachos!\u201d Clint yells out as you wave your hand in the air. </p><p>As you refill the entirety of the large parties drinks, you can\u2019t help but cringe when you hear a small argument from behind you. Everytime these college kids showed up there was a damn fight. Drinks will be thrown, hair is pulled, and it always ends up with an ice pack on a bloody nose, and you spending half the night online ordering new bar stools to replace the ones that were smashed over some idiots heads. Everyone pulls out their inner Chuck Norris when they\u2019re drunk. It\u2019s so obnoxious.</p><p>Only tonight, you\u2019re not as concerned. Say what you will about Tony and Clint. Sure they liked to mind their business and talk shop while they drank, but if there was ever a need for them to step in, they did, no questions asked.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a problem over here, boys?\u201d You lean forward, hands tight on the counters edge. \u201cNo fighting, is that understood? You want to have words, take it outside.\u201d</p><p>You glare at the two and wait patiently for them to break away from each other. </p><p>Clint watches them walk away, turning to you slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhooo. Something is in the air tonight, huh?\u201d \u00a0He raised a brow in annoyance looking over at Tony.</p><p>\u201cSeems so.\u201d He chucks back his drink and hits it against the bar, sliding it over for you to catch. \u201cScotch me, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother round for the man in red. Barton?\u201d You nod at the archer who lifts his bottle. </p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d </p><p>Clint\u2019s face lights up as one of your co-workers drops his plate of nachos in front of him.</p><p>\u201cSo good.\u201d He does a small shimmy on the barstool as he starts to place the first nacho in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I think that group of chicks that were downing all the apple martini\u2019s just walked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! Ughhhh, damn it&hellip;that was like a hundred dollar tab. What is happening tonight?\u201d</p><p>You drop your head in frustration onto the bar. </p><p>I love my job, I love my job, I love my job.</p><p>\u201cAwe, cheer up buttercup, the night will get bet\u2026\u201d</p><p>The sound of your yelp was barely heard over the music playing and the sounds of the voices surrounding you. As you lift your head slowly, Clint grits his teeth. You were soaked, beer dripping through your hair, down your shirt, ice covering the counter.</p><p>You look up to see the two jackasses from earlier standing in front of you arguing, pushing each other\u2019s chest, grunting like apes.</p><p>\u201cCould this night get any worse?\u201d You shake out your hands, grabbing a towel from the back of your belt. </p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t see how it could.\u201d Tony shakes his head, offering a hand in cleaning up the bar where he sits.</p><p>\u201cGet off of me!\u201d You barely have a moment to get clean before your two guys are at it again, pushing and shoving, one of their backs pressed over the counter.</p><p>\u201cHey! Uh huh! Take it outside!\u201d You push them both off the bar but they\u2019re much bigger than you, not to mention they have have that brute strength that all intoxicated people seem to get well after they\u2019ve had a bit too many.</p><p>Just as one goes to swing, the other one ducks from the blow. His hand finding the edge of Clint\u2019s nachos, sending them full speed into your chest. </p><p>\u201cAwe, nachos\u2026\u201d Clint whines out, as you give him a death stare. </p><p>He promptly stands up, Tony joining him, each gathering one of the boys. Dragging them out by their ears, hair, and collars.</p><p>You stand there completely stunned by what had just occurred.</p><p>As Clint and Tony come back in, sitting back on their stools, they both stare at you unsure of what to do next.</p><p>\u201cI stand corrected? Apparently, it can get worse for you.\u201d Tony states as he hands you a few napkins, as if it would actually help.</p><p>\u201cClint! Are you kidding me right now?\u201d You eyes bulge as you look down to see Clint, nacho in hand, scraping the cheese and sour cream from the skin on your chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m starving, and their paid for. Five second rule only applies to floor food, not neck food.\u201d</p><p>You look to Tony shaking his head in disapproval.</p><p>\u201cYou are a complete animal, Barton.\u201d </p><p>You look to the side at your friend who covers her mouth. </p><p>\u201cIf you laugh right now, I might cry.\u201d She hands you a clean rag and helps pick off chunks of cheese and bacon.</p><p>\u201cDo you have another shirt at least?\u201d </p><p>The look you gave her was one of a solid no.</p><p>\u201cYou know what we have to do, right?\u201d She looks at the clock and you follow her eyes to it.</p><p>You pick up the tip jar and start to count the funds.</p><p>\u201cHow short are you?\u201d \u00a0She presses when she notices your face drop.</p><p>\u201cFifty bucks.\u201d You whisper. </p><p>\u201cTake my half tonight. You earned it.\u201d She pushed the jar towards you and you push it back.</p><p>\u201cNo way. You have been dealing with those assholes all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have, too.\u201d She pulls out the cash and shoves it in your pocket. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, I\u2019m not going to let you leave here tonight empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Pulling the money back out you hand it back to her. \u201cKeep it for now. Let\u2019s give it the hour, and I\u2019ll reassess.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>You purse your lips, hating yourself for what you were about to do. You needed the money badly, but you knew it wasn\u2019t coming tonight. Better call it while you can.</p><p>Placing your hands on the bar, you pinch your mouth tightly, and close your eyes. </p><p>\u201cLast call!\u201d </p><p>The grunts, complaints, and yells that come from the surrounding crowd were almost ear piercing.</p><p>As you wipe down your top with a fresh wet cloth, you can\u2019t help but to notice two men staring in your direction. </p><p>\u201cSomething on your mind boys?\u201d You lift your brows as they look back and forth from each other to you.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t eavesdropping, I swear\u2026\u201d Clint mumbles out before being interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d Tony raises his hand, unashamed. \u201cHow much do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d You shake your head and turn towards the liquor filling another order. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a number.\u201d He argues back. He sighs, rubbing his hand down his face tiredly. \u201cLook&hellip;you can either tell me, or you can let me guess&hellip;but you know what\u2019s going to happen if I do. I\u2019m going to guess to high, you know that, right? Then I\u2019m going to have to dig through your personal life, find which bank you use\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to override the system and hack to get your account numbers\u2026\u201d Clint adds in, agreeing with Tony.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;I\u2019ll transfer an ungodly amount of money, you\u2019ll find out, get mad at me&hellip;probably spit in my drinks, ban us from coming\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll get mad because I can\u2019t get my nachos, and you know I only like them the way you guys make them here\u2026\u201d Clint leans back folding his arms, already pouting.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to hear all about it and buy the bar to keep him happy. I mean, it\u2019s just a whole process&hellip;and to be honest, it&rsquo;s a pain in the ass, what with all the paperwork and stuff. If you can help me out, do this old man a solid and just tell me how much you need, it would make my life\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur lives\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hell of a lot easier. Plus, Pepper hates when I buy things spur of the moment. You wouldn\u2019t want me to fight with Pepper&hellip;would you?\u201d Tony blinks his dark brown eyes your way while Clint puffs out his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI hate you both. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d They collectively say.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Tony requests yet again. </p><p>\u201cI need fifty bucks to pay for my car. It\u2019s in the shop. Another ten for an Uber to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d He slaps his hands on the bar and reaches behind his back for his wallet.</p><p>He slides a crisp hundred your way, and you promptly slide it back. </p><p>\u201cUh huh. To much.\u201d </p><p>He slides it back and sighs when you cross your arms and refuse to take it.</p><p>Clint smirks as he watches Tony slide it slowly towards you again, and you back up to avoid contact with it.</p><p>\u201cJust reach out. Gimme your hand, just&hellip;just lean forward, touch the bill&hellip;why are you not taking it?\u201d </p><p>He stares at Clint and looks completely bewildered. </p><p>\u201cBarton&hellip;what\u2019s happening here? What do I do? I\u2019ve never had someone not take free money from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard the woman, it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, think of it as a investment for tomorrow night\u2019s shift. In case we have a replay of tonight\u2019s events.\u201d He snaps his fingers before he points to you, proud of his idea. </p><p>\u201cSort of a&hellip;back up fund if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright, princess\u2026\u201d</p><p>Clint grits his teeth, sucking a breath through them and shakes his head, knowing that would not sit well with you.</p><p>You open your mouth to respond with fire in your eyes, but Clint reaches forward to stop you. </p><p>\u201cHow about we discuss the terms of the money, and then figure out where we went wrong&hellip;yeah?\u201d</p><p>They both look at you and wait for your response.</p><p>\u201cThis is to much. I need sixty tops, and I WILL pay you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pay you back or no deal. I make my own way. I always have. I won\u2019t take money that I didn\u2019t earn. That\u2019s the deal, take it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I can respect that. It\u2019s honorable. Although, I do think you\u2019ve earned it with the cheese down your shirt and all.\u201d</p><p>Clint starts to agree but becomes distracted as a group of girls pays their tab, leaving a few quarters in the tip jar.</p><p>He turns to look at Tony, and Tony rubs his eyebrows in disbelief. </p><p>\u201cWe have work to do my feathered friend.\u201d He pats his shoulder, turning your way with a devious grin.</p><p>\u201cGet ready to earn your money.\u201d </p><p>Your eyes widen as he jumps on top of his barstool and stands proudly on the counter.</p><p>\u201cClint&hellip;what is he doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI hope you can handle a crowded bar.\u201d Clint cracks his neck, standing up shaking his limbs. </p><p>\u201cClint&hellip;what are YOU doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wants to take tequila shots with the some of the Avengers!\u201d Tony yells out between his cupped hands.</p><p>The masses turn toward the bar, their eyes bulge when they see Tony with a bottle of tequila, and a bucket of limes. </p><p>Like a celebrity sighting at a premier, patrons run towards the bar excitedly screaming for shots.</p><p>\u201cAlright you little delinquents. Here\u2019s the deal. You pay for your shot up front, you pick your avenger of choice. You tip ahead of time. The bigger the tip, the better the service. \u00a0The top five tips of the night will get to lick salt off of one of our bodies. Are we ready?\u201d</p><p>Tony looks down to you and nods, laughing as the look of \u00a0shock is still clearly plastered on your face.</p><p>\u201cYou may want to keep track of those big tips, dear.\u201d </p><p>You glance to the right at your already giddy partner in crime as she pulls out a notepad and a pen.</p><p>\u201cUmm, who\u2019s first I guess?\u201d \u00a0The roar the crowd makes you laugh as they line up three to four deep.</p><p>Tony was three shots in. Clint, six as they requested that the music be turned up so that they could get people to dance. </p><p>It had been forty five minutes, and your excitement grew at the sight of the tip jar filling.</p><p>\u201cI think you made your quota.\u201d Clint leans over the bar and giggles. \u201cEveryone seems to be behaving. You want to take back that last call and see where the crowd takes us?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. You may want to slow down though. You still promised the top tippers some one on one time. Don\u2019t forget!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two want to keep chit chatting&hellip;or should we get back to making and taking drinks?\u201d</p><p>Twenty more more minutes in and your bottles are just about empty. \u00a0You motion to Clint, who now is covered in lipstick of multiple shades from neck to forehead, victim of a million selfies from all the girls in town.</p><p>\u201cIs it time?\u201d He yells across the bar.</p><p>Hitting Tony on his arm, he grabs his attention and motions to the now almost bare bar.</p><p>\u201cAlright alright. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s that time of night, kiddies. Before we empty this joint, let\u2019s all take a minute and thank the lovely young lady here for providing us with this evening of fun. Thank you, Y/N, it\u2019s been a pleasure.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The pub raises a glass to you as you bow thankfully to the crowd of people. You then begin to chuckle as Clint jumps to the top of the bar, asking for the notepad with the highest tippers on it.</p><p>\u201cNow comes the fun part. I need&hellip;what do I need&hellip;I need&hellip;someone to tell me who the best tippers were so we can get this party started for those lucky enough to join Tony and I in one last shot of shenanigans before the night ends. I\u2019m way too drunk to read this, or add for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimmie that, you hooligan.\u201d Tony grabs the notepad, reading off the top five names with the highest tips given. They ranged from two to four hundred dollars, one willing to pay five hundred if she could take a shot of of both of their necks, stomachs and Clint\u2019s biceps, to which they both agreed.</p><p>The names were called and they all lined up, shots poured, limes given and salt shakers passed.</p><p>\u201cHave fun, guys!\u201d Laughs could be heard from all parties as Clint would shiver and giggle each time someone licked the salt off of him. Apparently the Avenger was quite ticklish, which was a surprise to all. Tony would just smile, yelling for more salt or bigger limes after each one, encouraging them to have fun, shouting how it was a once in a lifetime experience.</p><p>They had completely turned your night around. Your nightmare of a shift had been turned into one of the best nights you had ever had. </p><p>As you watch the last patron leave, your best friend locks the door and flips the closed sign over.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the grand total?\u201d Tony questions, wiping his neck down, offering Clint a cloth, too. \u201cYou missed a few spots there, Legolas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s not going anywhere, Barton.\u201d You point, holding your stomach as you laugh. That\u2019s a bite, and that one is a hickey.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, she really sucked hard.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said?\u201d You and Tony both mumble under your breath.</p><p>\u201cBetter have been worth the teasing I\u2019m going to get from Nat all week.\u201d Clint points to the jar, making grabby hands for it.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you need for tonight?\u201d Tony looks up from under his eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cSixty at least.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re good, because you made about a thousand over that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d He reaches his hand in the air for you to hit.</p><p>\u201cDo Barton and I know how to handle things, or what?\u201d Tony leans back in his chair, folding his arms, quite proud of himself.</p><p>\u201cYou do, you do&hellip;and I am eternally grateful. I don\u2019t know how to thank you. You guys saved me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about free drinks from now on?\u201d Tony asks as he tosses a peanut from the bar into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cFree Nachos?\u201d Clint requests with hope on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to run that by the boss, but he might be okay with it after tonight.\u201d</p><p>As you wipe down the counter the phone rings suddenly, all of you curious as to who could be calling anyone at this ungodly hour.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, It\u2019s Pepper! Everyone be cool, be cool! Hey sweetheart, what are you doing up at this time?\u201d Tony pulls out the charm like no other, blinking his eyelashes, giving the most innocent grin.</p><p>\u201cYou did not just buy a bar!\u201d She yells out, the facetime conversation heard by all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just dreaming, sweetheart. Go back to bed and we\u2019ll talk in the morning\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Pep..\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you hang up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Honey.\u201d He presses the button, smiling wide into the screen and places his phone gently on the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou are in so much trouble tomorrow.\u201d Clint laughs into his glass, clinking it with Tony\u2019s as they down the rest of the leftover shots.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOn the bright side though&hellip;free nachos!\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVoRn0Y6fH_fqa5qDidsWSQ\">@schilj79</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> @awkward-sydney <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp757tS4u6WsQaOYvTJ33bQ\">@lordemjay</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLKe0ai32q0pHD9A1g2R2g\">@lovemarvelousfics</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfzvEX9P8FUtHkeUq7TMR5Q\">@elishamcloughlin</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m08K--JEIOUffGaqd6YUOCw\">@quotemeow</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb4rvr_8QAxikDvWTjb7nQA\">@alycu1</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\">@redqueen1221</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ_Zchr0deSRcaAmStu3qEg\">@candrian</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgAWpDg3BsQqc2-GXo3Sl7Q\">@diinofayce</a>\u00a0@mrs&mdash;nicole</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcYT6_R0xPDdJM1tM8shgdg\">@buckysbrat</a> @time-travel-bouquet <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muAIH7bv13MuZ6fSfzbvPbA\">@papi-chulo-bucky</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOR0JtBHkDYVanGVvN7ZtPA\">@captain-ak84</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JaOhLc7o7BDEgZtGxYWiQ\">@loricameback</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzaTi-rD3DLEuZf2J_eykQ\">@stanclub</a> @anneof1000days <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNdb_9F70ptIcaMt4VvvLlg\">@sweetpca</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwGSKhEKHC4g-VdlD6iIfTw\">@shynara51</a></p><p>@whimsicalrobots <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw1HAQ82D8ohK3AKFhpUilQ\">@sgtpenny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moJMdNKRU2dqNTDmZCl-Tsg\">@louisianaspell</a>\u00a0@feelmyroarrrr <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m30xJtKKXuOZ2RRtdlRMdBw\">@yknott81</a></p><p>@friendly-neighborhood-lich-queen <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_E8B-m08tpTS-Bhyig957w\">@belbow</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ2xFPoZFg--W0MjDcyCPHQ\">@mizzzpink</a></p><p>@fuckmeupsebastian @samstuffworld @10robins \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-f_IwpQt9ftNkEyTFNXqWA\">@a-dd-i-c-t-ed</a></p>",

Relax already.\u201d He leans over the bar, putting on his best puppy dogs eyes. \u201cDo you think I could get another one, though?\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cNo. I told you if you spilled another one you were done. Sorry, that\u2019s the rules.\u201d You pick up the glass from the counter, and throw it into the sink.</p><p>\u201cOkay, whatever\u2026bitch.\u201d He goes to turn away but is grabbed by a thick hand who forcefully turns him around to you.</p><p>\u201cTell the lady you\u2019re sorry, pay your tab, and get out.\u201d You didn\u2019t even have to look up to know who\u2019s voice it was. </p><p>\u201cI just wanted a beer, bro.\u201d The kid grunts out as his stomach is pressed into the counter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and she just wanted to serve people who weren\u2019t assholes, yet here we are.\u201d</p><p>You smile sweetly as the kid reaches back into his pocket bringing his wallet to the counter. \u00a0He thumbs through a couple of tens dropping them down, then sliding over a few singles to your side of the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhoa there\u2026what is like, like two percent\u201d? I think we can do better than that. I\u2019m pretty sure I saw another ten in there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut she\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she served your ass with a smile, and didn\u2019t hit you. For that she deserves to be paid. Hand me that tip jar, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>Clint was by far one of your best regulars. Why he ever came to this junky old place was beyond you. He said that he loved that it was old school, not to flashy, and the people were down to earth. He came in every Friday, sometimes Saturday if he had gone on a tough mission that week, or was just overly anxious.</p><p>He sent a quick smile and wink your way as you reached over the counter, handing him the barely filled jar from your hands. </p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d He asks as he looks into your jar, filled with barely fifteen bucks and few piles of change.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough night.\u201d You say, pointing over to the large group at the other end of the floor. \u201cThey were already drunk when they got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell this won\u2019t do.\u201d He pats the kid on his back, and gives him the nod of approval. The kid goes to leave but Clint pulls him back.</p><p>\u201cLeave the pizza coupon, too.\u201d You laugh under your breath when the kid opens his wallet, pulling out the small piece of paper, throwing it into the bar.</p><p>\u201cCan I leave now?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, and go tell your friends not to even think about dipping without paying their tab, and leaving a tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they do, I\u2019ll find each and every one of you. I have the time, resources, and the money to follow through with it. I get bored easily.\u201d You grab the tip jar back laughing as Tony pushes the young man off back towards the door. \u201cGo forth young man. Go use your brains for good, or\u2026get laid or something. What do you kids do these days? Don\u2019t tell me, just get out and go do it.\u201d He waves his hand, already over the interaction. </p><p>\u201cNice of you to join us, Mr. Stark.\u201d You greet him with a sassy smile, handing him his drink of choice.</p><p>\u201cI hate when you call me that.\u201d He says smirking over his drink. \u201cYou make a good drink, kid.\u201d</p><p>You point your finger his way scolding him.</p><p>\u201cI hate when you call me kid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll stop. As long as you don\u2019t mind me calling you something equally as embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll stop too, as long as you don\u2019t mind me spitting in your drink while I pour.\u201d</p><p>Glaring at each other in a small standoff, you wait for him to break, and you know he will. </p><p>\u201cUgh, fine. You win. It won\u2019t happen again, squirt.\u201d</p><p>You point at his drink, motioning your fingers for him to give it you. </p><p>\u201cYou need that refreshed?\u201d Clint chuckles as he watches you swish your mouth back and forth.</p><p>\u201cAlright children. That\u2019s enough.\u201d </p><p>You hear a voice call out to you at the other end of the counter. Another patron waving money at you, asking for a drink. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me gentleman, I\u2019m being beckoned for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck\u2026and bring back nachos!\u201d Clint yells out as you wave your hand in the air. </p><p>As you refill the entirety of the large parties drinks, you can\u2019t help but cringe when you hear a small argument from behind you. Everytime these college kids showed up there was a damn fight. Drinks will be thrown, hair is pulled, and it always ends up with an ice pack on a bloody nose, and you spending half the night online ordering new bar stools to replace the ones that were smashed over some idiots heads. Everyone pulls out their inner Chuck Norris when they\u2019re drunk. It\u2019s so obnoxious.</p><p>Only tonight, you\u2019re not as concerned. Say what you will about Tony and Clint. Sure they liked to mind their business and talk shop while they drank, but if there was ever a need for them to step in, they did, no questions asked.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a problem over here, boys?\u201d You lean forward, hands tight on the counters edge. \u201cNo fighting, is that understood? You want to have words, take it outside.\u201d</p><p>You glare at the two and wait patiently for them to break away from each other. </p><p>Clint watches them walk away, turning to you slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhooo. Something is in the air tonight, huh?\u201d \u00a0He raised a brow in annoyance looking over at Tony.</p><p>\u201cSeems so.\u201d He chucks back his drink and hits it against the bar, sliding it over for you to catch. \u201cScotch me, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother round for the man in red. Barton?\u201d You nod at the archer who lifts his bottle. </p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d </p><p>Clint\u2019s face lights up as one of your co-workers drops his plate of nachos in front of him.</p><p>\u201cSo good.\u201d He does a small shimmy on the barstool as he starts to place the first nacho in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I think that group of chicks that were downing all the apple martini\u2019s just walked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! Ughhhh, damn it\u2026that was like a hundred dollar tab. What is happening tonight?\u201d</p><p>You drop your head in frustration onto the bar. </p><p>I love my job, I love my job, I love my job.</p><p>\u201cAwe, cheer up buttercup, the night will get bet\u2026\u201d</p><p>The sound of your yelp was barely heard over the music playing and the sounds of the voices surrounding you. As you lift your head slowly, Clint grits his teeth. You were soaked, beer dripping through your hair, down your shirt, ice covering the counter.</p><p>You look up to see the two jackasses from earlier standing in front of you arguing, pushing each other\u2019s chest, grunting like apes.</p><p>\u201cCould this night get any worse?\u201d You shake out your hands, grabbing a towel from the back of your belt. </p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t see how it could.\u201d Tony shakes his head, offering a hand in cleaning up the bar where he sits.</p><p>\u201cGet off of me!\u201d You barely have a moment to get clean before your two guys are at it again, pushing and shoving, one of their backs pressed over the counter.</p><p>\u201cHey! Uh huh! Take it outside!\u201d You push them both off the bar but they\u2019re much bigger than you, not to mention they have have that brute strength that all intoxicated people seem to get well after they\u2019ve had a bit too many.</p><p>Just as one goes to swing, the other one ducks from the blow. His hand finding the edge of Clint\u2019s nachos, sending them full speed into your chest. </p><p>\u201cAwe, nachos\u2026\u201d Clint whines out, as you give him a death stare. </p><p>He promptly stands up, Tony joining him, each gathering one of the boys. Dragging them out by their ears, hair, and collars.</p><p>You stand there completely stunned by what had just occurred.</p><p>As Clint and Tony come back in, sitting back on their stools, they both stare at you unsure of what to do next.</p><p>\u201cI stand corrected? Apparently, it can get worse for you.\u201d Tony states as he hands you a few napkins, as if it would actually help.</p><p>\u201cClint! Are you kidding me right now?\u201d You eyes bulge as you look down to see Clint, nacho in hand, scraping the cheese and sour cream from the skin on your chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m starving, and their paid for. Five second rule only applies to floor food, not neck food.\u201d</p><p>You look to Tony shaking his head in disapproval.</p><p>\u201cYou are a complete animal, Barton.\u201d </p><p>You look to the side at your friend who covers her mouth. </p><p>\u201cIf you laugh right now, I might cry.\u201d She hands you a clean rag and helps pick off chunks of cheese and bacon.</p><p>\u201cDo you have another shirt at least?\u201d </p><p>The look you gave her was one of a solid no.</p><p>\u201cYou know what we have to do, right?\u201d She looks at the clock and you follow her eyes to it.</p><p>You pick up the tip jar and start to count the funds.</p><p>\u201cHow short are you?\u201d \u00a0She presses when she notices your face drop.</p><p>\u201cFifty bucks.\u201d You whisper. </p><p>\u201cTake my half tonight. You earned it.\u201d She pushed the jar towards you and you push it back.</p><p>\u201cNo way. You have been dealing with those assholes all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have, too.\u201d She pulls out the cash and shoves it in your pocket. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, I\u2019m not going to let you leave here tonight empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Pulling the money back out you hand it back to her. \u201cKeep it for now. Let\u2019s give it the hour, and I\u2019ll reassess.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>You purse your lips, hating yourself for what you were about to do. You needed the money badly, but you knew it wasn\u2019t coming tonight. Better call it while you can.</p><p>Placing your hands on the bar, you pinch your mouth tightly, and close your eyes. </p><p>\u201cLast call!\u201d </p><p>The grunts, complaints, and yells that come from the surrounding crowd were almost ear piercing.</p><p>As you wipe down your top with a fresh wet cloth, you can\u2019t help but to notice two men staring in your direction. </p><p>\u201cSomething on your mind boys?\u201d You lift your brows as they look back and forth from each other to you.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t eavesdropping, I swear\u2026\u201d Clint mumbles out before being interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d Tony raises his hand, unashamed. \u201cHow much do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d You shake your head and turn towards the liquor filling another order. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a number.\u201d He argues back. He sighs, rubbing his hand down his face tiredly. \u201cLook\u2026you can either tell me, or you can let me guess\u2026but you know what\u2019s going to happen if I do. I\u2019m going to guess to high, you know that, right? Then I\u2019m going to have to dig through your personal life, find which bank you use\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to override the system and hack to get your account numbers\u2026\u201d Clint adds in, agreeing with Tony.</p><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll transfer an ungodly amount of money, you\u2019ll find out, get mad at me\u2026probably spit in my drinks, ban us from coming\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll get mad because I can\u2019t get my nachos, and you know I only like them the way you guys make them here\u2026\u201d Clint leans back folding his arms, already pouting.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to hear all about it and buy the bar to keep him happy. I mean, it\u2019s just a whole process\u2026and to be honest, it\u2019s a pain in the ass, what with all the paperwork and stuff. If you can help me out, do this old man a solid and just tell me how much you need, it would make my life\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur lives\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hell of a lot easier. Plus, Pepper hates when I buy things spur of the moment. You wouldn\u2019t want me to fight with Pepper\u2026would you?\u201d Tony blinks his dark brown eyes your way while Clint puffs out his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI hate you both. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d They collectively say.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Tony requests yet again. </p><p>\u201cI need fifty bucks to pay for my car. It\u2019s in the shop. Another ten for an Uber to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d He slaps his hands on the bar and reaches behind his back for his wallet.</p><p>He slides a crisp hundred your way, and you promptly slide it back. </p><p>\u201cUh huh. To much.\u201d </p><p>He slides it back and sighs when you cross your arms and refuse to take it.</p><p>Clint smirks as he watches Tony slide it slowly towards you again, and you back up to avoid contact with it.</p><p>\u201cJust reach out. Gimme your hand, just\u2026just lean forward, touch the bill\u2026why are you not taking it?\u201d </p><p>He stares at Clint and looks completely bewildered. </p><p>\u201cBarton\u2026what\u2019s happening here? What do I do? I\u2019ve never had someone not take free money from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard the woman, it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, think of it as a investment for tomorrow night\u2019s shift. In case we have a replay of tonight\u2019s events.\u201d He snaps his fingers before he points to you, proud of his idea. </p><p>\u201cSort of a\u2026back up fund if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright, princess\u2026\u201d</p><p>Clint grits his teeth, sucking a breath through them and shakes his head, knowing that would not sit well with you.</p><p>You open your mouth to respond with fire in your eyes, but Clint reaches forward to stop you. </p><p>\u201cHow about we discuss the terms of the money, and then figure out where we went wrong\u2026yeah?\u201d</p><p>They both look at you and wait for your response.</p><p>\u201cThis is to much. I need sixty tops, and I WILL pay you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pay you back or no deal. I make my own way. I always have. I won\u2019t take money that I didn\u2019t earn. That\u2019s the deal, take it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I can respect that. It\u2019s honorable. Although, I do think you\u2019ve earned it with the cheese down your shirt and all.\u201d</p><p>Clint starts to agree but becomes distracted as a group of girls pays their tab, leaving a few quarters in the tip jar.</p><p>He turns to look at Tony, and Tony rubs his eyebrows in disbelief. </p><p>\u201cWe have work to do my feathered friend.\u201d He pats his shoulder, turning your way with a devious grin.</p><p>\u201cGet ready to earn your money.\u201d </p><p>Your eyes widen as he jumps on top of his barstool and stands proudly on the counter.</p><p>\u201cClint\u2026what is he doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI hope you can handle a crowded bar.\u201d Clint cracks his neck, standing up shaking his limbs. </p><p>\u201cClint\u2026what are YOU doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wants to take tequila shots with the some of the Avengers!\u201d Tony yells out between his cupped hands.</p><p>The masses turn toward the bar, their eyes bulge when they see Tony with a bottle of tequila, and a bucket of limes. </p><p>Like a celebrity sighting at a premier, patrons run towards the bar excitedly screaming for shots.</p><p>\u201cAlright you little delinquents. Here\u2019s the deal. You pay for your shot up front, you pick your avenger of choice. You tip ahead of time. The bigger the tip, the better the service. \u00a0The top five tips of the night will get to lick salt off of one of our bodies. Are we ready?\u201d</p><p>Tony looks down to you and nods, laughing as the look of \u00a0shock is still clearly plastered on your face.</p><p>\u201cYou may want to keep track of those big tips, dear.\u201d </p><p>You glance to the right at your already giddy partner in crime as she pulls out a notepad and a pen.</p><p>\u201cUmm, who\u2019s first I guess?\u201d \u00a0The roar the crowd makes you laugh as they line up three to four deep.</p><p>Tony was three shots in. Clint, six as they requested that the music be turned up so that they could get people to dance. </p><p>It had been forty five minutes, and your excitement grew at the sight of the tip jar filling.</p><p>\u201cI think you made your quota.\u201d Clint leans over the bar and giggles. \u201cEveryone seems to be behaving. You want to take back that last call and see where the crowd takes us?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. You may want to slow down though. You still promised the top tippers some one on one time. Don\u2019t forget!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two want to keep chit chatting\u2026or should we get back to making and taking drinks?\u201d</p><p>Twenty more more minutes in and your bottles are just about empty. \u00a0You motion to Clint, who now is covered in lipstick of multiple shades from neck to forehead, victim of a million selfies from all the girls in town.</p><p>\u201cIs it time?\u201d He yells across the bar.</p><p>Hitting Tony on his arm, he grabs his attention and motions to the now almost bare bar.</p><p>\u201cAlright alright. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s that time of night, kiddies. Before we empty this joint, let\u2019s all take a minute and thank the lovely young lady here for providing us with this evening of fun. Thank you, Y/N, it\u2019s been a pleasure.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The pub raises a glass to you as you bow thankfully to the crowd of people. You then begin to chuckle as Clint jumps to the top of the bar, asking for the notepad with the highest tippers on it.</p><p>\u201cNow comes the fun part. I need\u2026what do I need\u2026I need\u2026someone to tell me who the best tippers were so we can get this party started for those lucky enough to join Tony and I in one last shot of shenanigans before the night ends. I\u2019m way too drunk to read this, or add for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimmie that, you hooligan.\u201d Tony grabs the notepad, reading off the top five names with the highest tips given. They ranged from two to four hundred dollars, one willing to pay five hundred if she could take a shot of of both of their necks, stomachs and Clint\u2019s biceps, to which they both agreed.</p><p>The names were called and they all lined up, shots poured, limes given and salt shakers passed.</p><p>\u201cHave fun, guys!\u201d Laughs could be heard from all parties as Clint would shiver and giggle each time someone licked the salt off of him. Apparently the Avenger was quite ticklish, which was a surprise to all. Tony would just smile, yelling for more salt or bigger limes after each one, encouraging them to have fun, shouting how it was a once in a lifetime experience.</p><p>They had completely turned your night around. Your nightmare of a shift had been turned into one of the best nights you had ever had. </p><p>As you watch the last patron leave, your best friend locks the door and flips the closed sign over.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the grand total?\u201d Tony questions, wiping his neck down, offering Clint a cloth, too. \u201cYou missed a few spots there, Legolas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s not going anywhere, Barton.\u201d You point, holding your stomach as you laugh. That\u2019s a bite, and that one is a hickey.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, she really sucked hard.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said?\u201d You and Tony both mumble under your breath.</p><p>\u201cBetter have been worth the teasing I\u2019m going to get from Nat all week.\u201d Clint points to the jar, making grabby hands for it.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you need for tonight?\u201d Tony looks up from under his eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cSixty at least.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re good, because you made about a thousand over that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d He reaches his hand in the air for you to hit.</p><p>\u201cDo Barton and I know how to handle things, or what?\u201d Tony leans back in his chair, folding his arms, quite proud of himself.</p><p>\u201cYou do, you do\u2026and I am eternally grateful. I don\u2019t know how to thank you. You guys saved me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about free drinks from now on?\u201d Tony asks as he tosses a peanut from the bar into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cFree Nachos?\u201d Clint requests with hope on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to run that by the boss, but he might be okay with it after tonight.\u201d</p><p>As you wipe down the counter the phone rings suddenly, all of you curious as to who could be calling anyone at this ungodly hour.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, It\u2019s Pepper! Everyone be cool, be cool! Hey sweetheart, what are you doing up at this time?\u201d Tony pulls out the charm like no other, blinking his eyelashes, giving the most innocent grin.</p><p>\u201cYou did not just buy a bar!\u201d She yells out, the facetime conversation heard by all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just dreaming, sweetheart. Go back to bed and we\u2019ll talk in the morning\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Pep..\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you hang up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Honey.\u201d He presses the button, smiling wide into the screen and places his phone gently on the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou are in so much trouble tomorrow.\u201d Clint laughs into his glass, clinking it with Tony\u2019s as they down the rest of the leftover shots.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOn the bright side though\u2026free nachos!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVoRn0Y6fH_fqa5qDidsWSQ\">@schilj79</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> @awkward-sydney <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp757tS4u6WsQaOYvTJ33bQ\">@lordemjay</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLKe0ai32q0pHD9A1g2R2g\">@lovemarvelousfics</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfzvEX9P8FUtHkeUq7TMR5Q\">@elishamcloughlin</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m08K--JEIOUffGaqd6YUOCw\">@quotemeow</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb4rvr_8QAxikDvWTjb7nQA\">@alycu1</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\">@redqueen1221</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ_Zchr0deSRcaAmStu3qEg\">@candrian</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgAWpDg3BsQqc2-GXo3Sl7Q\">@diinofayce</a>\u00a0@mrs\u2014nicole</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcYT6_R0xPDdJM1tM8shgdg\">@buckysbrat</a> @time-travel-bouquet <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muAIH7bv13MuZ6fSfzbvPbA\">@papi-chulo-bucky</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOR0JtBHkDYVanGVvN7ZtPA\">@captain-ak84</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JaOhLc7o7BDEgZtGxYWiQ\">@loricameback</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzaTi-rD3DLEuZf2J_eykQ\">@stanclub</a> @anneof1000days <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNdb_9F70ptIcaMt4VvvLlg\">@sweetpca</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwGSKhEKHC4g-VdlD6iIfTw\">@shynara51</a></p><p>@whimsicalrobots <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw1HAQ82D8ohK3AKFhpUilQ\">@sgtpenny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moJMdNKRU2dqNTDmZCl-Tsg\">@louisianaspell</a>\u00a0@feelmyroarrrr <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m30xJtKKXuOZ2RRtdlRMdBw\">@yknott81</a></p><p>@friendly-neighborhood-lich-queen <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_E8B-m08tpTS-Bhyig957w\">@belbow</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ2xFPoZFg--W0MjDcyCPHQ\">@mizzzpink</a></p><p>@fuckmeupsebastian @samstuffworld @10robins \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-f_IwpQt9ftNkEyTFNXqWA\">@a-dd-i-c-t-ed</a></p></p>",

I did my best, but I\u2019m a little tired still. Sorry, nonnie, but I hope you like it.\u00a0</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>The pub was pure insanity tonight. The patrons were loud, rowdy, and for some reason, way more rude than normal. Your regulars could barely get to you behind the bar, becoming more and more annoyed every time some young college punk would kick their chair, bellowing over their shoulders for you to refill their mug.</p><p>Nights like these were the worst. You knew by the end of this shift that you would not only be exhausted, but most likely pissed off by the lack of tips that you knew you would be shorted. \u00a0Drunk people were terrible. They were sloppy and belligerent. They never tipped well, and they always seem to think that \u201ctheir friend\u201d had settle up the bill before they left. \u00a0It was nights like these that you prayed someone rich would come and take you away, pay all of your debt, take you around the world, and save you from this life.</p><p>\u201cCome on, dude!\u201d You jump back as a glass of beer splashes across your jeans, the result of a local kid animatedly telling a story to his friends.</p><p>\u201cChill out, it\u2019s only beer. Relax already.\u201d He leans over the bar, putting on his best puppy dogs eyes. \u201cDo you think I could get another one, though?\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cNo. I told you if you spilled another one you were done. Sorry, that\u2019s the rules.\u201d You pick up the glass from the counter, and throw it into the sink.</p><p>\u201cOkay, whatever\u2026bitch.\u201d He goes to turn away but is grabbed by a thick hand who forcefully turns him around to you.</p><p>\u201cTell the lady you\u2019re sorry, pay your tab, and get out.\u201d You didn\u2019t even have to look up to know who\u2019s voice it was. </p><p>\u201cI just wanted a beer, bro.\u201d The kid grunts out as his stomach is pressed into the counter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and she just wanted to serve people who weren\u2019t assholes, yet here we are.\u201d</p><p>You smile sweetly as the kid reaches back into his pocket bringing his wallet to the counter. \u00a0He thumbs through a couple of tens dropping them down, then sliding over a few singles to your side of the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhoa there\u2026what is like, like two percent\u201d? I think we can do better than that. I\u2019m pretty sure I saw another ten in there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut she\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she served your ass with a smile, and didn\u2019t hit you. For that she deserves to be paid. Hand me that tip jar, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>Clint was by far one of your best regulars. Why he ever came to this junky old place was beyond you. He said that he loved that it was old school, not to flashy, and the people were down to earth. He came in every Friday, sometimes Saturday if he had gone on a tough mission that week, or was just overly anxious.</p><p>He sent a quick smile and wink your way as you reached over the counter, handing him the barely filled jar from your hands. </p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d He asks as he looks into your jar, filled with barely fifteen bucks and few piles of change.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough night.\u201d You say, pointing over to the large group at the other end of the floor. \u201cThey were already drunk when they got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell this won\u2019t do.\u201d He pats the kid on his back, and gives him the nod of approval. The kid goes to leave but Clint pulls him back.</p><p>\u201cLeave the pizza coupon, too.\u201d You laugh under your breath when the kid opens his wallet, pulling out the small piece of paper, throwing it into the bar.</p><p>\u201cCan I leave now?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, and go tell your friends not to even think about dipping without paying their tab, and leaving a tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they do, I\u2019ll find each and every one of you. I have the time, resources, and the money to follow through with it. I get bored easily.\u201d You grab the tip jar back laughing as Tony pushes the young man off back towards the door. \u201cGo forth young man. Go use your brains for good, or\u2026get laid or something. What do you kids do these days? Don\u2019t tell me, just get out and go do it.\u201d He waves his hand, already over the interaction. </p><p>\u201cNice of you to join us, Mr. Stark.\u201d You greet him with a sassy smile, handing him his drink of choice.</p><p>\u201cI hate when you call me that.\u201d He says smirking over his drink. \u201cYou make a good drink, kid.\u201d</p><p>You point your finger his way scolding him.</p><p>\u201cI hate when you call me kid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll stop. As long as you don\u2019t mind me calling you something equally as embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll stop too, as long as you don\u2019t mind me spitting in your drink while I pour.\u201d</p><p>Glaring at each other in a small standoff, you wait for him to break, and you know he will. </p><p>\u201cUgh, fine. You win. It won\u2019t happen again, squirt.\u201d</p><p>You point at his drink, motioning your fingers for him to give it you. </p><p>\u201cYou need that refreshed?\u201d Clint chuckles as he watches you swish your mouth back and forth.</p><p>\u201cAlright children. That\u2019s enough.\u201d </p><p>You hear a voice call out to you at the other end of the counter. Another patron waving money at you, asking for a drink. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me gentleman, I\u2019m being beckoned for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck\u2026and bring back nachos!\u201d Clint yells out as you wave your hand in the air. </p><p>As you refill the entirety of the large parties drinks, you can\u2019t help but cringe when you hear a small argument from behind you. Everytime these college kids showed up there was a damn fight. Drinks will be thrown, hair is pulled, and it always ends up with an ice pack on a bloody nose, and you spending half the night online ordering new bar stools to replace the ones that were smashed over some idiots heads. Everyone pulls out their inner Chuck Norris when they\u2019re drunk. It\u2019s so obnoxious.</p><p>Only tonight, you\u2019re not as concerned. Say what you will about Tony and Clint. Sure they liked to mind their business and talk shop while they drank, but if there was ever a need for them to step in, they did, no questions asked.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a problem over here, boys?\u201d You lean forward, hands tight on the counters edge. \u201cNo fighting, is that understood? You want to have words, take it outside.\u201d</p><p>You glare at the two and wait patiently for them to break away from each other. </p><p>Clint watches them walk away, turning to you slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhooo. Something is in the air tonight, huh?\u201d \u00a0He raised a brow in annoyance looking over at Tony.</p><p>\u201cSeems so.\u201d He chucks back his drink and hits it against the bar, sliding it over for you to catch. \u201cScotch me, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother round for the man in red. Barton?\u201d You nod at the archer who lifts his bottle. </p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d </p><p>Clint\u2019s face lights up as one of your co-workers drops his plate of nachos in front of him.</p><p>\u201cSo good.\u201d He does a small shimmy on the barstool as he starts to place the first nacho in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I think that group of chicks that were downing all the apple martini\u2019s just walked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! Ughhhh, damn it\u2026that was like a hundred dollar tab. What is happening tonight?\u201d</p><p>You drop your head in frustration onto the bar. </p><p>I love my job, I love my job, I love my job.</p><p>\u201cAwe, cheer up buttercup, the night will get bet\u2026\u201d</p><p>The sound of your yelp was barely heard over the music playing and the sounds of the voices surrounding you. As you lift your head slowly, Clint grits his teeth. You were soaked, beer dripping through your hair, down your shirt, ice covering the counter.</p><p>You look up to see the two jackasses from earlier standing in front of you arguing, pushing each other\u2019s chest, grunting like apes.</p><p>\u201cCould this night get any worse?\u201d You shake out your hands, grabbing a towel from the back of your belt. </p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t see how it could.\u201d Tony shakes his head, offering a hand in cleaning up the bar where he sits.</p><p>\u201cGet off of me!\u201d You barely have a moment to get clean before your two guys are at it again, pushing and shoving, one of their backs pressed over the counter.</p><p>\u201cHey! Uh huh! Take it outside!\u201d You push them both off the bar but they\u2019re much bigger than you, not to mention they have have that brute strength that all intoxicated people seem to get well after they\u2019ve had a bit too many.</p><p>Just as one goes to swing, the other one ducks from the blow. His hand finding the edge of Clint\u2019s nachos, sending them full speed into your chest. </p><p>\u201cAwe, nachos\u2026\u201d Clint whines out, as you give him a death stare. </p><p>He promptly stands up, Tony joining him, each gathering one of the boys. Dragging them out by their ears, hair, and collars.</p><p>You stand there completely stunned by what had just occurred.</p><p>As Clint and Tony come back in, sitting back on their stools, they both stare at you unsure of what to do next.</p><p>\u201cI stand corrected? Apparently, it can get worse for you.\u201d Tony states as he hands you a few napkins, as if it would actually help.</p><p>\u201cClint! Are you kidding me right now?\u201d You eyes bulge as you look down to see Clint, nacho in hand, scraping the cheese and sour cream from the skin on your chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m starving, and their paid for. Five second rule only applies to floor food, not neck food.\u201d</p><p>You look to Tony shaking his head in disapproval.</p><p>\u201cYou are a complete animal, Barton.\u201d </p><p>You look to the side at your friend who covers her mouth. </p><p>\u201cIf you laugh right now, I might cry.\u201d She hands you a clean rag and helps pick off chunks of cheese and bacon.</p><p>\u201cDo you have another shirt at least?\u201d </p><p>The look you gave her was one of a solid no.</p><p>\u201cYou know what we have to do, right?\u201d She looks at the clock and you follow her eyes to it.</p><p>You pick up the tip jar and start to count the funds.</p><p>\u201cHow short are you?\u201d \u00a0She presses when she notices your face drop.</p><p>\u201cFifty bucks.\u201d You whisper. </p><p>\u201cTake my half tonight. You earned it.\u201d She pushed the jar towards you and you push it back.</p><p>\u201cNo way. You have been dealing with those assholes all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have, too.\u201d She pulls out the cash and shoves it in your pocket. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, I\u2019m not going to let you leave here tonight empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Pulling the money back out you hand it back to her. \u201cKeep it for now. Let\u2019s give it the hour, and I\u2019ll reassess.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>You purse your lips, hating yourself for what you were about to do. You needed the money badly, but you knew it wasn\u2019t coming tonight. Better call it while you can.</p><p>Placing your hands on the bar, you pinch your mouth tightly, and close your eyes. </p><p>\u201cLast call!\u201d </p><p>The grunts, complaints, and yells that come from the surrounding crowd were almost ear piercing.</p><p>As you wipe down your top with a fresh wet cloth, you can\u2019t help but to notice two men staring in your direction. </p><p>\u201cSomething on your mind boys?\u201d You lift your brows as they look back and forth from each other to you.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t eavesdropping, I swear\u2026\u201d Clint mumbles out before being interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d Tony raises his hand, unashamed. \u201cHow much do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d You shake your head and turn towards the liquor filling another order. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a number.\u201d He argues back. He sighs, rubbing his hand down his face tiredly. \u201cLook\u2026you can either tell me, or you can let me guess\u2026but you know what\u2019s going to happen if I do. I\u2019m going to guess to high, you know that, right? Then I\u2019m going to have to dig through your personal life, find which bank you use\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to override the system and hack to get your account numbers\u2026\u201d Clint adds in, agreeing with Tony.</p><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll transfer an ungodly amount of money, you\u2019ll find out, get mad at me\u2026probably spit in my drinks, ban us from coming\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll get mad because I can\u2019t get my nachos, and you know I only like them the way you guys make them here\u2026\u201d Clint leans back folding his arms, already pouting.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to hear all about it and buy the bar to keep him happy. I mean, it\u2019s just a whole process\u2026and to be honest, it\u2019s a pain in the ass, what with all the paperwork and stuff. If you can help me out, do this old man a solid and just tell me how much you need, it would make my life\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur lives\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hell of a lot easier. Plus, Pepper hates when I buy things spur of the moment. You wouldn\u2019t want me to fight with Pepper\u2026would you?\u201d Tony blinks his dark brown eyes your way while Clint puffs out his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI hate you both. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d They collectively say.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Tony requests yet again. </p><p>\u201cI need fifty bucks to pay for my car. It\u2019s in the shop. Another ten for an Uber to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d He slaps his hands on the bar and reaches behind his back for his wallet.</p><p>He slides a crisp hundred your way, and you promptly slide it back. </p><p>\u201cUh huh. To much.\u201d </p><p>He slides it back and sighs when you cross your arms and refuse to take it.</p><p>Clint smirks as he watches Tony slide it slowly towards you again, and you back up to avoid contact with it.</p><p>\u201cJust reach out. Gimme your hand, just\u2026just lean forward, touch the bill\u2026why are you not taking it?\u201d </p><p>He stares at Clint and looks completely bewildered. </p><p>\u201cBarton\u2026what\u2019s happening here? What do I do? I\u2019ve never had someone not take free money from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard the woman, it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, think of it as a investment for tomorrow night\u2019s shift. In case we have a replay of tonight\u2019s events.\u201d He snaps his fingers before he points to you, proud of his idea. </p><p>\u201cSort of a\u2026back up fund if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright, princess\u2026\u201d</p><p>Clint grits his teeth, sucking a breath through them and shakes his head, knowing that would not sit well with you.</p><p>You open your mouth to respond with fire in your eyes, but Clint reaches forward to stop you. </p><p>\u201cHow about we discuss the terms of the money, and then figure out where we went wrong\u2026yeah?\u201d</p><p>They both look at you and wait for your response.</p><p>\u201cThis is to much. I need sixty tops, and I WILL pay you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pay you back or no deal. I make my own way. I always have. I won\u2019t take money that I didn\u2019t earn. That\u2019s the deal, take it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I can respect that. It\u2019s honorable. Although, I do think you\u2019ve earned it with the cheese down your shirt and all.\u201d</p><p>Clint starts to agree but becomes distracted as a group of girls pays their tab, leaving a few quarters in the tip jar.</p><p>He turns to look at Tony, and Tony rubs his eyebrows in disbelief. </p><p>\u201cWe have work to do my feathered friend.\u201d He pats his shoulder, turning your way with a devious grin.</p><p>\u201cGet ready to earn your money.\u201d </p><p>Your eyes widen as he jumps on top of his barstool and stands proudly on the counter.</p><p>\u201cClint\u2026what is he doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI hope you can handle a crowded bar.\u201d Clint cracks his neck, standing up shaking his limbs. </p><p>\u201cClint\u2026what are YOU doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wants to take tequila shots with the some of the Avengers!\u201d Tony yells out between his cupped hands.</p><p>The masses turn toward the bar, their eyes bulge when they see Tony with a bottle of tequila, and a bucket of limes. </p><p>Like a celebrity sighting at a premier, patrons run towards the bar excitedly screaming for shots.</p><p>\u201cAlright you little delinquents. Here\u2019s the deal. You pay for your shot up front, you pick your avenger of choice. You tip ahead of time. The bigger the tip, the better the service. \u00a0The top five tips of the night will get to lick salt off of one of our bodies. Are we ready?\u201d</p><p>Tony looks down to you and nods, laughing as the look of \u00a0shock is still clearly plastered on your face.</p><p>\u201cYou may want to keep track of those big tips, dear.\u201d </p><p>You glance to the right at your already giddy partner in crime as she pulls out a notepad and a pen.</p><p>\u201cUmm, who\u2019s first I guess?\u201d \u00a0The roar the crowd makes you laugh as they line up three to four deep.</p><p>Tony was three shots in. Clint, six as they requested that the music be turned up so that they could get people to dance. </p><p>It had been forty five minutes, and your excitement grew at the sight of the tip jar filling.</p><p>\u201cI think you made your quota.\u201d Clint leans over the bar and giggles. \u201cEveryone seems to be behaving. You want to take back that last call and see where the crowd takes us?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. You may want to slow down though. You still promised the top tippers some one on one time. Don\u2019t forget!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two want to keep chit chatting\u2026or should we get back to making and taking drinks?\u201d</p><p>Twenty more more minutes in and your bottles are just about empty. \u00a0You motion to Clint, who now is covered in lipstick of multiple shades from neck to forehead, victim of a million selfies from all the girls in town.</p><p>\u201cIs it time?\u201d He yells across the bar.</p><p>Hitting Tony on his arm, he grabs his attention and motions to the now almost bare bar.</p><p>\u201cAlright alright. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s that time of night, kiddies. Before we empty this joint, let\u2019s all take a minute and thank the lovely young lady here for providing us with this evening of fun. Thank you, Y/N, it\u2019s been a pleasure.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The pub raises a glass to you as you bow thankfully to the crowd of people. You then begin to chuckle as Clint jumps to the top of the bar, asking for the notepad with the highest tippers on it.</p><p>\u201cNow comes the fun part. I need\u2026what do I need\u2026I need\u2026someone to tell me who the best tippers were so we can get this party started for those lucky enough to join Tony and I in one last shot of shenanigans before the night ends. I\u2019m way too drunk to read this, or add for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimmie that, you hooligan.\u201d Tony grabs the notepad, reading off the top five names with the highest tips given. They ranged from two to four hundred dollars, one willing to pay five hundred if she could take a shot of of both of their necks, stomachs and Clint\u2019s biceps, to which they both agreed.</p><p>The names were called and they all lined up, shots poured, limes given and salt shakers passed.</p><p>\u201cHave fun, guys!\u201d Laughs could be heard from all parties as Clint would shiver and giggle each time someone licked the salt off of him. Apparently the Avenger was quite ticklish, which was a surprise to all. Tony would just smile, yelling for more salt or bigger limes after each one, encouraging them to have fun, shouting how it was a once in a lifetime experience.</p><p>They had completely turned your night around. Your nightmare of a shift had been turned into one of the best nights you had ever had. </p><p>As you watch the last patron leave, your best friend locks the door and flips the closed sign over.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the grand total?\u201d Tony questions, wiping his neck down, offering Clint a cloth, too. \u201cYou missed a few spots there, Legolas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s not going anywhere, Barton.\u201d You point, holding your stomach as you laugh.

I don\u2019t know how to thank you. You guys saved me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about free drinks from now on?\u201d Tony asks as he tosses a peanut from the bar into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cFree Nachos?\u201d Clint requests with hope on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to run that by the boss, but he might be okay with it after tonight.\u201d</p><p>As you wipe down the counter the phone rings suddenly, all of you curious as to who could be calling anyone at this ungodly hour.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, It\u2019s Pepper! Everyone be cool, be cool! Hey sweetheart, what are you doing up at this time?\u201d Tony pulls out the charm like no other, blinking his eyelashes, giving the most innocent grin.</p><p>\u201cYou did not just buy a bar!\u201d She yells out, the facetime conversation heard by all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just dreaming, sweetheart. Go back to bed and we\u2019ll talk in the morning\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Pep..\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you hang up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Honey.\u201d He presses the button, smiling wide into the screen and places his phone gently on the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou are in so much trouble tomorrow.\u201d Clint laughs into his glass, clinking it with Tony\u2019s as they down the rest of the leftover shots.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOn the bright side though\u2026free nachos!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVoRn0Y6fH_fqa5qDidsWSQ\">@schilj79</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> @awkward-sydney <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp757tS4u6WsQaOYvTJ33bQ\">@lordemjay</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLKe0ai32q0pHD9A1g2R2g\">@lovemarvelousfics</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfzvEX9P8FUtHkeUq7TMR5Q\">@elishamcloughlin</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m08K--JEIOUffGaqd6YUOCw\">@quotemeow</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb4rvr_8QAxikDvWTjb7nQA\">@alycu1</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\">@redqueen1221</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ_Zchr0deSRcaAmStu3qEg\">@candrian</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgAWpDg3BsQqc2-GXo3Sl7Q\">@diinofayce</a>\u00a0@mrs\u2014nicole</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcYT6_R0xPDdJM1tM8shgdg\">@buckysbrat</a> @time-travel-bouquet <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muAIH7bv13MuZ6fSfzbvPbA\">@papi-chulo-bucky</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOR0JtBHkDYVanGVvN7ZtPA\">@captain-ak84</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JaOhLc7o7BDEgZtGxYWiQ\">@loricameback</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzaTi-rD3DLEuZf2J_eykQ\">@stanclub</a> @anneof1000days <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNdb_9F70ptIcaMt4VvvLlg\">@sweetpca</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwGSKhEKHC4g-VdlD6iIfTw\">@shynara51</a></p><p>@whimsicalrobots <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw1HAQ82D8ohK3AKFhpUilQ\">@sgtpenny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moJMdNKRU2dqNTDmZCl-Tsg\">@louisianaspell</a>\u00a0@feelmyroarrrr <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m30xJtKKXuOZ2RRtdlRMdBw\">@yknott81</a></p><p>@friendly-neighborhood-lich-queen <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_E8B-m08tpTS-Bhyig957w\">@belbow</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ2xFPoZFg--W0MjDcyCPHQ\">@mizzzpink</a></p><p>@fuckmeupsebastian @samstuffworld @10robins \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-f_IwpQt9ftNkEyTFNXqWA\">@a-dd-i-c-t-ed</a></p></p>",

I did my best, but I&rsquo;m a little tired still. Sorry, nonnie, but I hope you like it.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p>The pub was pure insanity tonight. The patrons were loud, rowdy, and for some reason, way more rude than normal. Your regulars could barely get to you behind the bar, becoming more and more annoyed every time some young college punk would kick their chair, bellowing over their shoulders for you to refill their mug.</p><p>Nights like these were the worst. You knew by the end of this shift that you would not only be exhausted, but most likely pissed off by the lack of tips that you knew you would be shorted. &nbsp;Drunk people were terrible. They were sloppy and belligerent. They never tipped well, and they always seem to think that &ldquo;their friend&rdquo; had settle up the bill before they left. &nbsp;It was nights like these that you prayed someone rich would come and take you away, pay all of your debt, take you around the world, and save you from this life.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, dude!&rdquo; You jump back as a glass of beer splashes across your jeans, the result of a local kid animatedly telling a story to his friends.</p><p>&ldquo;Chill out, it&rsquo;s only beer. Relax already.&rdquo; He leans over the bar, putting on his best puppy dogs eyes. &ldquo;Do you think I could get another one, though?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No. I told you if you spilled another one you were done. Sorry, that&rsquo;s the rules.&rdquo; You pick up the glass from the counter, and throw it into the sink.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, whatever&hellip;bitch.&rdquo; He goes to turn away but is grabbed by a thick hand who forcefully turns him around to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell the lady you&rsquo;re sorry, pay your tab, and get out.&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t even have to look up to know who&rsquo;s voice it was. </p><p>&ldquo;I just wanted a beer, bro.&rdquo; The kid grunts out as his stomach is pressed into the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, and she just wanted to serve people who weren&rsquo;t assholes, yet here we are.&rdquo;</p><p>You smile sweetly as the kid reaches back into his pocket bringing his wallet to the counter. &nbsp;He thumbs through a couple of tens dropping them down, then sliding over a few singles to your side of the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa there&hellip;what is like, like two percent&rdquo;? I think we can do better than that. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I saw another ten in there.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But she&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But she served your ass with a smile, and didn&rsquo;t hit you. For that she deserves to be paid. Hand me that tip jar, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p>Clint was by far one of your best regulars. Why he ever came to this junky old place was beyond you. He said that he loved that it was old school, not to flashy, and the people were down to earth. He came in every Friday, sometimes Saturday if he had gone on a tough mission that week, or was just overly anxious.</p><p>He sent a quick smile and wink your way as you reached over the counter, handing him the barely filled jar from your hands. </p><p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; He asks as he looks into your jar, filled with barely fifteen bucks and few piles of change.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a rough night.&rdquo; You say, pointing over to the large group at the other end of the floor. &ldquo;They were already drunk when they got here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well this won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo; He pats the kid on his back, and gives him the nod of approval. The kid goes to leave but Clint pulls him back.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave the pizza coupon, too.&rdquo; You laugh under your breath when the kid opens his wallet, pulling out the small piece of paper, throwing it into the bar.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I leave now?&rdquo; He asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and go tell your friends not to even think about dipping without paying their tab, and leaving a tip.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If they do, I&rsquo;ll find each and every one of you. I have the time, resources, and the money to follow through with it. I get bored easily.&rdquo; You grab the tip jar back laughing as Tony pushes the young man off back towards the door. &ldquo;Go forth young man. Go use your brains for good, or&hellip;get laid or something. What do you kids do these days? Don&rsquo;t tell me, just get out and go do it.&rdquo; He waves his hand, already over the interaction. </p><p>&ldquo;Nice of you to join us, Mr. Stark.&rdquo; You greet him with a sassy smile, handing him his drink of choice.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate when you call me that.&rdquo; He says smirking over his drink. &ldquo;You make a good drink, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>You point your finger his way scolding him.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate when you call me kid.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll stop. As long as you don&rsquo;t mind me calling you something equally as embarrassing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay then. I&rsquo;ll stop too, as long as you don&rsquo;t mind me spitting in your drink while I pour.&rdquo;</p><p>Glaring at each other in a small standoff, you wait for him to break, and you know he will. </p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, fine. You win. It won&rsquo;t happen again, squirt.&rdquo;</p><p>You point at his drink, motioning your fingers for him to give it you. </p><p>&ldquo;You need that refreshed?&rdquo; Clint chuckles as he watches you swish your mouth back and forth.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright children. That&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo; </p><p>You hear a voice call out to you at the other end of the counter. Another patron waving money at you, asking for a drink. </p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me gentleman, I&rsquo;m being beckoned for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good luck&hellip;and bring back nachos!&rdquo; Clint yells out as you wave your hand in the air. </p><p>As you refill the entirety of the large parties drinks, you can&rsquo;t help but cringe when you hear a small argument from behind you. Everytime these college kids showed up there was a damn fight. Drinks will be thrown, hair is pulled, and it always ends up with an ice pack on a bloody nose, and you spending half the night online ordering new bar stools to replace the ones that were smashed over some idiots heads. Everyone pulls out their inner Chuck Norris when they&rsquo;re drunk. It&rsquo;s so obnoxious.</p><p>Only tonight, you&rsquo;re not as concerned. Say what you will about Tony and Clint. Sure they liked to mind their business and talk shop while they drank, but if there was ever a need for them to step in, they did, no questions asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Do we have a problem over here, boys?&rdquo; You lean forward, hands tight on the counters edge. &ldquo;No fighting, is that understood? You want to have words, take it outside.&rdquo;</p><p>You glare at the two and wait patiently for them to break away from each other. </p><p>Clint watches them walk away, turning to you slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;Whooo. Something is in the air tonight, huh?&rdquo; &nbsp;He raised a brow in annoyance looking over at Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Seems so.&rdquo; He chucks back his drink and hits it against the bar, sliding it over for you to catch. &ldquo;Scotch me, love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Another round for the man in red. Barton?&rdquo; You nod at the archer who lifts his bottle. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo; </p><p>Clint&rsquo;s face lights up as one of your co-workers drops his plate of nachos in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;So good.&rdquo; He does a small shimmy on the barstool as he starts to place the first nacho in his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I think that group of chicks that were downing all the apple martini&rsquo;s just walked out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! Ughhhh, damn it&hellip;that was like a hundred dollar tab. What is happening tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>You drop your head in frustration onto the bar. </p><p>I love my job, I love my job, I love my job.</p><p>&ldquo;Awe, cheer up buttercup, the night will get bet&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The sound of your yelp was barely heard over the music playing and the sounds of the voices surrounding you. As you lift your head slowly, Clint grits his teeth. You were soaked, beer dripping through your hair, down your shirt, ice covering the counter.</p><p>You look up to see the two jackasses from earlier standing in front of you arguing, pushing each other&rsquo;s chest, grunting like apes.</p><p>&ldquo;Could this night get any worse?&rdquo; You shake out your hands, grabbing a towel from the back of your belt. </p><p>&ldquo;To be honest, I don&rsquo;t see how it could.&rdquo; Tony shakes his head, offering a hand in cleaning up the bar where he sits.</p><p>&ldquo;Get off of me!&rdquo; You barely have a moment to get clean before your two guys are at it again, pushing and shoving, one of their backs pressed over the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Uh huh! Take it outside!&rdquo; You push them both off the bar but they&rsquo;re much bigger than you, not to mention they have have that brute strength that all intoxicated people seem to get well after they&rsquo;ve had a bit too many.</p><p>Just as one goes to swing, the other one ducks from the blow. His hand finding the edge of Clint&rsquo;s nachos, sending them full speed into your chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Awe, nachos&hellip;&rdquo; Clint whines out, as you give him a death stare. </p><p>He promptly stands up, Tony joining him, each gathering one of the boys. Dragging them out by their ears, hair, and collars.</p><p>You stand there completely stunned by what had just occurred.</p><p>As Clint and Tony come back in, sitting back on their stools, they both stare at you unsure of what to do next.</p><p>&ldquo;I stand corrected? Apparently, it can get worse for you.&rdquo; Tony states as he hands you a few napkins, as if it would actually help.</p><p>&ldquo;Clint! Are you kidding me right now?&rdquo; You eyes bulge as you look down to see Clint, nacho in hand, scraping the cheese and sour cream from the skin on your chest.</p><p>&ldquo;What? I&rsquo;m starving, and their paid for. Five second rule only applies to floor food, not neck food.&rdquo;</p><p>You look to Tony shaking his head in disapproval.</p><p>&ldquo;You are a complete animal, Barton.&rdquo; </p><p>You look to the side at your friend who covers her mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;If you laugh right now, I might cry.&rdquo; She hands you a clean rag and helps pick off chunks of cheese and bacon.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have another shirt at least?&rdquo; </p><p>The look you gave her was one of a solid no.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what we have to do, right?&rdquo; She looks at the clock and you follow her eyes to it.</p><p>You pick up the tip jar and start to count the funds.</p><p>&ldquo;How short are you?&rdquo; &nbsp;She presses when she notices your face drop.</p><p>&ldquo;Fifty bucks.&rdquo; You whisper. </p><p>&ldquo;Take my half tonight. You earned it.&rdquo; She pushed the jar towards you and you push it back.</p><p>&ldquo;No way. You have been dealing with those assholes all night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have, too.&rdquo; She pulls out the cash and shoves it in your pocket. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my best friend, I&rsquo;m not going to let you leave here tonight empty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Pulling the money back out you hand it back to her. &ldquo;Keep it for now. Let&rsquo;s give it the hour, and I&rsquo;ll reassess.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>You purse your lips, hating yourself for what you were about to do. You needed the money badly, but you knew it wasn&rsquo;t coming tonight. Better call it while you can.</p><p>Placing your hands on the bar, you pinch your mouth tightly, and close your eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Last call!&rdquo; </p><p>The grunts, complaints, and yells that come from the surrounding crowd were almost ear piercing.</p><p>As you wipe down your top with a fresh wet cloth, you can&rsquo;t help but to notice two men staring in your direction. </p><p>&ldquo;Something on your mind boys?&rdquo; You lift your brows as they look back and forth from each other to you.</p><p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t eavesdropping, I swear&hellip;&rdquo; Clint mumbles out before being interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;I was.&rdquo; Tony raises his hand, unashamed. &ldquo;How much do you need?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; You shake your head and turn towards the liquor filling another order. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a number.&rdquo; He argues back. He sighs, rubbing his hand down his face tiredly. &ldquo;Look&hellip;you can either tell me, or you can let me guess&hellip;but you know what&rsquo;s going to happen if I do. I&rsquo;m going to guess to high, you know that, right? Then I&rsquo;m going to have to dig through your personal life, find which bank you use&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to override the system and hack to get your account numbers&hellip;&rdquo; Clint adds in, agreeing with Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ll transfer an ungodly amount of money, you&rsquo;ll find out, get mad at me&hellip;probably spit in my drinks, ban us from coming&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll get mad because I can&rsquo;t get my nachos, and you know I only like them the way you guys make them here&hellip;&rdquo; Clint leans back folding his arms, already pouting.</p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll have to hear all about it and buy the bar to keep him happy. I mean, it&rsquo;s just a whole process&hellip;and to be honest, it&rsquo;s a pain in the ass, what with all the paperwork and stuff. If you can help me out, do this old man a solid and just tell me how much you need, it would make my life&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our lives&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A hell of a lot easier. Plus, Pepper hates when I buy things spur of the moment. You wouldn&rsquo;t want me to fight with Pepper&hellip;would you?&rdquo; Tony blinks his dark brown eyes your way while Clint puffs out his lower lip.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate you both. You know that, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; They collectively say.</p><p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; Tony requests yet again. </p><p>&ldquo;I need fifty bucks to pay for my car. It&rsquo;s in the shop. Another ten for an Uber to get home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; He slaps his hands on the bar and reaches behind his back for his wallet.</p><p>He slides a crisp hundred your way, and you promptly slide it back. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh huh. To much.&rdquo; </p><p>He slides it back and sighs when you cross your arms and refuse to take it.</p><p>Clint smirks as he watches Tony slide it slowly towards you again, and you back up to avoid contact with it.</p><p>&ldquo;Just reach out. Gimme your hand, just&hellip;just lean forward, touch the bill&hellip;why are you not taking it?&rdquo; </p><p>He stares at Clint and looks completely bewildered. </p><p>&ldquo;Barton&hellip;what&rsquo;s happening here? What do I do? I&rsquo;ve never had someone not take free money from me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You heard the woman, it&rsquo;s too much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, think of it as a investment for tomorrow night&rsquo;s shift. In case we have a replay of tonight&rsquo;s events.&rdquo; He snaps his fingers before he points to you, proud of his idea. </p><p>&ldquo;Sort of a&hellip;back up fund if you will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, princess&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Clint grits his teeth, sucking a breath through them and shakes his head, knowing that would not sit well with you.</p><p>You open your mouth to respond with fire in your eyes, but Clint reaches forward to stop you. </p><p>&ldquo;How about we discuss the terms of the money, and then figure out where we went wrong&hellip;yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>They both look at you and wait for your response.</p><p>&ldquo;This is to much. I need sixty tops, and I WILL pay you back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I pay you back or no deal. I make my own way. I always have. I won&rsquo;t take money that I didn&rsquo;t earn. That&rsquo;s the deal, take it or leave it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. I can respect that. It&rsquo;s honorable. Although, I do think you&rsquo;ve earned it with the cheese down your shirt and all.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint starts to agree but becomes distracted as a group of girls pays their tab, leaving a few quarters in the tip jar.</p><p>He turns to look at Tony, and Tony rubs his eyebrows in disbelief. </p><p>&ldquo;We have work to do my feathered friend.&rdquo; He pats his shoulder, turning your way with a devious grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Get ready to earn your money.&rdquo; </p><p>Your eyes widen as he jumps on top of his barstool and stands proudly on the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;Clint&hellip;what is he doing?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I hope you can handle a crowded bar.&rdquo; Clint cracks his neck, standing up shaking his limbs. </p><p>&ldquo;Clint&hellip;what are YOU doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who wants to take tequila shots with the some of the Avengers!&rdquo; Tony yells out between his cupped hands.</p><p>The masses turn toward the bar, their eyes bulge when they see Tony with a bottle of tequila, and a bucket of limes. </p><p>Like a celebrity sighting at a premier, patrons run towards the bar excitedly screaming for shots.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright you little delinquents. Here&rsquo;s the deal. You pay for your shot up front, you pick your avenger of choice. You tip ahead of time. The bigger the tip, the better the service. &nbsp;The top five tips of the night will get to lick salt off of one of our bodies. Are we ready?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looks down to you and nods, laughing as the look of &nbsp;shock is still clearly plastered on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;You may want to keep track of those big tips, dear.&rdquo; </p><p>You glance to the right at your already giddy partner in crime as she pulls out a notepad and a pen.</p><p>&ldquo;Umm, who&rsquo;s first I guess?&rdquo; &nbsp;The roar the crowd makes you laugh as they line up three to four deep.</p><p>Tony was three shots in. Clint, six as they requested that the music be turned up so that they could get people to dance. </p><p>It had been forty five minutes, and your excitement grew at the sight of the tip jar filling.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you made your quota.&rdquo; Clint leans over the bar and giggles. &ldquo;Everyone seems to be behaving. You want to take back that last call and see where the crowd takes us?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay. You may want to slow down though. You still promised the top tippers some one on one time. Don&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You two want to keep chit chatting&hellip;or should we get back to making and taking drinks?&rdquo;</p><p>Twenty more more minutes in and your bottles are just about empty. &nbsp;You motion to Clint, who now is covered in lipstick of multiple shades from neck to forehead, victim of a million selfies from all the girls in town.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it time?&rdquo; He yells across the bar.</p><p>Hitting Tony on his arm, he grabs his attention and motions to the now almost bare bar.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright alright. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s that time of night, kiddies. Before we empty this joint, let&rsquo;s all take a minute and thank the lovely young lady here for providing us with this evening of fun. Thank you, Y/N, it&rsquo;s been a pleasure.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>The pub raises a glass to you as you bow thankfully to the crowd of people. You then begin to chuckle as Clint jumps to the top of the bar, asking for the notepad with the highest tippers on it.</p><p>&ldquo;Now comes the fun part. I need&hellip;what do I need&hellip;I need&hellip;someone to tell me who the best tippers were so we can get this party started for those lucky enough to join Tony and I in one last shot of shenanigans before the night ends. I&rsquo;m way too drunk to read this, or add for that matter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gimmie that, you hooligan.&rdquo; Tony grabs the notepad, reading off the top five names with the highest tips given. They ranged from two to four hundred dollars, one willing to pay five hundred if she could take a shot of of both of their necks, stomachs and Clint&rsquo;s biceps, to which they both agreed.</p><p>The names were called and they all lined up, shots poured, limes given and salt shakers passed.</p><p>&ldquo;Have fun, guys!&rdquo; Laughs could be heard from all parties as Clint would shiver and giggle each time someone licked the salt off of him. Apparently the Avenger was quite ticklish, which was a surprise to all. Tony would just smile, yelling for more salt or bigger limes after each one, encouraging them to have fun, shouting how it was a once in a lifetime experience.</p><p>They had completely turned your night around. Your nightmare of a shift had been turned into one of the best nights you had ever had. </p><p>As you watch the last patron leave, your best friend locks the door and flips the closed sign over.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s the grand total?&rdquo; Tony questions, wiping his neck down, offering Clint a cloth, too. &ldquo;You missed a few spots there, Legolas.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That one&rsquo;s not going anywhere, Barton.&rdquo; You point, holding your stomach as you laugh. That&rsquo;s a bite, and that one is a hickey.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, she really sucked hard.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he said?&rdquo; You and Tony both mumble under your breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Better have been worth the teasing I&rsquo;m going to get from Nat all week.&rdquo; Clint points to the jar, making grabby hands for it.</p><p>&ldquo;How much did you need for tonight?&rdquo; Tony looks up from under his eyelashes.</p><p>&ldquo;Sixty at least.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re good, because you made about a thousand over that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; He reaches his hand in the air for you to hit.</p><p>&ldquo;Do Barton and I know how to handle things, or what?&rdquo; Tony leans back in his chair, folding his arms, quite proud of himself.</p><p>&ldquo;You do, you do&hellip;and I am eternally grateful. I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you. You guys saved me tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How about free drinks from now on?&rdquo; Tony asks as he tosses a peanut from the bar into his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Free Nachos?&rdquo; Clint requests with hope on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to run that by the boss, but he might be okay with it after tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>As you wipe down the counter the phone rings suddenly, all of you curious as to who could be calling anyone at this ungodly hour.</p><p>&ldquo;Ooooh, It&rsquo;s Pepper! Everyone be cool, be cool! Hey sweetheart, what are you doing up at this time?&rdquo; Tony pulls out the charm like no other, blinking his eyelashes, giving the most innocent grin.</p><p>&ldquo;You did not just buy a bar!&rdquo; She yells out, the facetime conversation heard by all.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just dreaming, sweetheart. Go back to bed and we&rsquo;ll talk in the morning&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Pep..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hang up!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good night, Honey.&rdquo; He presses the button, smiling wide into the screen and places his phone gently on the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;You are in so much trouble tomorrow.&rdquo; Clint laughs into his glass, clinking it with Tony&rsquo;s as they down the rest of the leftover shots.</p><p>&ldquo;Yup.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;On the bright side though&hellip;free nachos!&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVoRn0Y6fH_fqa5qDidsWSQ\">@schilj79</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> @awkward-sydney <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp757tS4u6WsQaOYvTJ33bQ\">@lordemjay</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLKe0ai32q0pHD9A1g2R2g\">@lovemarvelousfics</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfzvEX9P8FUtHkeUq7TMR5Q\">@elishamcloughlin</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m08K--JEIOUffGaqd6YUOCw\">@quotemeow</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb4rvr_8QAxikDvWTjb7nQA\">@alycu1</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\">@redqueen1221</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ_Zchr0deSRcaAmStu3qEg\">@candrian</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgAWpDg3BsQqc2-GXo3Sl7Q\">@diinofayce</a>&nbsp;@mrs&mdash;nicole</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcYT6_R0xPDdJM1tM8shgdg\">@buckysbrat</a> @time-travel-bouquet <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muAIH7bv13MuZ6fSfzbvPbA\">@papi-chulo-bucky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOR0JtBHkDYVanGVvN7ZtPA\">@captain-ak84</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JaOhLc7o7BDEgZtGxYWiQ\">@loricameback</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzaTi-rD3DLEuZf2J_eykQ\">@stanclub</a> @anneof1000days <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNdb_9F70ptIcaMt4VvvLlg\">@sweetpca</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwGSKhEKHC4g-VdlD6iIfTw\">@shynara51</a></p><p>@whimsicalrobots <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw1HAQ82D8ohK3AKFhpUilQ\">@sgtpenny</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moJMdNKRU2dqNTDmZCl-Tsg\">@louisianaspell</a>&nbsp;@feelmyroarrrr <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m30xJtKKXuOZ2RRtdlRMdBw\">@yknott81</a></p><p>@friendly-neighborhood-lich-queen <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_E8B-m08tpTS-Bhyig957w\">@belbow</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ2xFPoZFg--W0MjDcyCPHQ\">@mizzzpink</a></p><p>@fuckmeupsebastian @samstuffworld @10robins &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-f_IwpQt9ftNkEyTFNXqWA\">@a-dd-i-c-t-ed</a></p></p>",

You knew by the end of this shift that you would not only be exhausted, but most likely pissed off by the lack of tips that you knew you would be shorted. &nbsp;Drunk people were terrible. They were sloppy and belligerent. They never tipped well, and they always seem to think that &ldquo;their friend&rdquo; had settle up the bill before they left. &nbsp;It was nights like these that you prayed someone rich would come and take you away, pay all of your debt, take you around the world, and save you from this life.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Come on, dude!&rdquo; You jump back as a glass of beer splashes across your jeans, the result of a local kid animatedly telling a story to his friends.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Chill out, it&rsquo;s only beer.
