I\u2019d like to know what question he was answering there. If anyone knows or has screenshots of the Q&amp;A before it was deleted please tell me because now I\u2019m questioning if maybe he did get them confused. He said he saw them out of order and had confusedly claimed Jaime \u201cbetrayed the north\u201d when it was the scene of him leaving Brienne I believe. Also he didn\u2019t say anything about Gendry at all and I\u2019m hoping with all my heart he\u2019s in the episode given the clues we have of that. </p><p>Now I really want to know what question was that he answered about Arya!!!

Nothing major that I haven\u2019t mentioned.\n\nIn the epilogue, the unsullied leave to cross the sea and start liberating slave cities on their own, because thats Dany\u2019s plan before Jon kills her - - she has this big speech scene, after sacking King\u2019s Landing, where she\u2019s talking about wrecking the world, liberating all of the slaves from their masters.\n\nWhen they\u2019re deciding who to elect as king, Sam suggests holding a democratic election and the other nobles laugh at him. That\u2019s before they vote on Bran.\n\nThe Golden Company gets absolutely wrecked by the Unsullied. Arya tries to save civilians while KL is being sacked but fails, and leaves. Dany\u2019s whole plan for every combat situation is let Drogon handle it including the scorpions, which works fine for some reason even though she lost a dragon to one last episode.\n\nAll of that\u2019s out of order, obviously, but yeah.\u201d</p><p>\nSo really no more added context as he says it\u2019s out of order how he says it. 6 more days!!!</p>\n\n<p data-npf='{\"type\":\"link\",\"url\":\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Ffreefolk%2Fcomments%2Fbkc8xd%2Fcompilation_of_spoilers_for_got_episodes_46%2F&amp;t=Y2MxYTI5NDE1OTQyZjNmNTlmMmM5MjY5ZjIzNmI5MzUyYzQ3MmVlNiw5MjhkMGIwYmRmNzJjYWQ5MWZhNGU4ZjhjM2JkNThmOTZhOTg5Y2I5\",\"display_url\":\"https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/bkc8xd/compilation_of_spoilers_for_got_episodes_46/\",\"title\":\"r/freefolk - Compilation of Spoilers for GOT Episodes 4-6\",\"description\":\"9,454 votes and 18,225 comments so far on Reddit\",\"site_name\":\"reddit\",\"poster\":[{\"url\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/76f5638f5cf59fd05d462686d4588740/tumblr_prgnicJtsC1qd47fy_540.jpg\",\"type\":\"image/jpeg\",\"width\":751,\"height\":545}]}' class=\"npf_link\"><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Ffreefolk%2Fcomments%2Fbkc8xd%2Fcompilation_of_spoilers_for_got_episodes_46%2F&amp;t=Y2MxYTI5NDE1OTQyZjNmNTlmMmM5MjY5ZjIzNmI5MzUyYzQ3MmVlNiw5MjhkMGIwYmRmNzJjYWQ5MWZhNGU4ZjhjM2JkNThmOTZhOTg5Y2I5\" target=\"_blank\">r/freefolk - Compilation of Spoilers for GOT Episodes 4-6</a></p>",

I saw someone mention that we&rsquo;ve seen Arya working at target practice several times this season for no discernible reason, even after the Battle of Winterfell. It could just be throwaway scenes because there&rsquo;s every chance that D&amp;D don&rsquo;t really know what to do with her if she doesn&rsquo;t have a weapon in her hand.</p><p>But considering what we saw of her in 8x03 and 8x05, she&rsquo;s taken on a very traditional heroic role, more than any other person on the show. So Arya being a dragonslayer wouldn&rsquo;t be completely out of left field. I just question the logistics. Unless there&rsquo;s a scorpion laying around that hasn&rsquo;t been destroyed, she&rsquo;s not going to kill Drogon with an arrow or a knife through the eye.
