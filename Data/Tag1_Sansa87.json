We know that Cersei spoke with Tyrion and they may be working together. Given the possible leak that Tyrion is executed for betrayal, I have a theory about what may happen:</p><p>Cersei is going to kidnap Sansa to coerce Jon into betraying Daenerys. She wants to unite the Westerosi armies against the threat that Daenerys poses.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think she will ultimately succeed in the way she plans, especially since she is also unaware Jon is a contender to the throne, but I do think it will set into motion a series of events that will change the course of the war.</p><p>Cersei will make a brilliant tactical decision, but ultimately be undone by Lyanna&rsquo;s ghost. What harm could she do to Cersei now? A lot, as it turns out.</p></p>",
