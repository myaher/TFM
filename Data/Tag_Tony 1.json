You stood there arms hugging yourself as you slowly looked around. You knew how the Avengers compound looked like from the movies, but actually being here was extremely different. You can still hardly comprehend yourself what was happening.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d Peter called out from the desk. You snapped your head towards him, his arms on the top of the desk while the receptionist was getting paperwork prepared. You walked towards Peter with your arms still around you.</p><p>\u201cUhm whats up?\u201d Peter shifted his eyes towards the receptionist, you looked towards her awaiting any instruction.</p><p>\u201cHello, due to security protocols, before entering with Mr. Parker as a guest, we need fingerprint scans, a DNA sample and a photo for identification purposes\u201d the receptionist informed you as she pushed forward a digital fingerprint scanner.</p><p>You moved your right hand up and placed your fingers on the scanner as a flash of green washed over them.</p><p>\u201cHuh.. honestly, I thought Tony would have more security measures than this.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cOh, He does, but Mr. Parker here has clearance to bring in a guest. So the security measures are not as extreme\u201d They said while the receptionist slid over the prick for the DNA scan.</p><p>You turned your head towards Peter who had a goofy grin on his face.</p><p><i>Tony really does love him. How pure.</i></p><p>After the receptionist took your photo you were able to follow Peter, not really knowing where exactly he was taking you. \u201cDid you hear her? I have clearance, Mr. Stark doesn&rsquo;t allow that for just anyone!\u201d</p><p>You giggled at his enthusiasm of being so trusted by Tony.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great Peter\u201d</p><p>You walked a bit towards the compound, passing agents, and training facilities until you entered a more private section.</p><p>\u201cNow entering, Peter Parker\u2026 Now entering Y/N Y/L/N\u201d You heard Friday say probably knowing your name because of the process you just had to go through.</p><p>From the looks of it, it looked like the living quarters of the facility, you recognized the living room that Peter had brought you too. As soon as Peter walked into the living room he spun around walking backwards for a bit before stopping. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I brought you here. If you end up being a bad guy Mr. Stark is totally going to kill me!\u201d</p><p>You stopped, leaving a good chunk of distance between yourself and Peter. \u201cTrust me Peter. Tony is going to want to hear this\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear what now?\u201d you heard from behind.</p><p>You turned around as you saw Tony walk in with a grey shirt and a zipped up black hoodie. His sun glasses in his hand as he was wiping them clean.</p><p>\u201cWhoa..\u201d you said to yourself.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!! H-hi, how are you doing sir\u201d Tony looked towards Peter and nodded his head towards him \u201cKid\u201d he then looked towards you and scrunched his eyes as you were unfamiliar to him.</p><p>\u201cOther kid\u201d He spoke nodding towards you as well.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me, why was I <i>summoned</i> here by a couple of teenagers\u201d he said as he put his glasses back on and folded his arms.</p><p>You stared at Tony in shock, fangirling internally that RDJ in Tony Stark form, was in front of you. Peter looked at you then back at Tony, realizing that he should probably say something.</p><p>\u201cW-Well, you see.. Mr. Stark\u2026\u201d Peter took a deep breath before beginning his ramble. \u201cApparently, we arn\u2019t really people, we\u2019re based off of comic books, at least in Y/Ns dimension.. I-I guess that\u2019s true and she\u2026 I-I actually don&rsquo;t really know why she&rsquo;s here but she came to me and really begged for my help and now she&rsquo;s here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Tony scrunched his eyebrows at Peter, quickly glancing at you then back to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>He totally did not get any of that.</p><p>You shook your head snapping out of it.</p><p>\u201cSorry, uhhh Hi. I guess, my name is Y/N Y/L/N, wha-what Peter is trying to say here is.. I&rsquo;m not from this dimension. You\u2019re a genius, i\u2019m sure you&rsquo;ve heard about the multi-verse. Well, it&rsquo;s a real thing and somehow I was transported here, into your dimension.\u201d</p><p>Tony arched an eyebrow up and stifled out a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cFunny, your friend here is funny Parker\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my friend\u201d Peter spoke up. Tony shook his head in confusion at Peter.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not? Then who the hell is he and why is she here\u201d Tony was a bit more defensive now knowing that a total stranger was in the Avengers facility.</p><p>\u201cTony, i\u2019m serious\u201d You said, which caused Tony to direct a questionable look towards you for calling him Tony.</p><p>\u201cS-sorry.. I mean\u2026 Mr. Stark. But I\u2019m serious. I\u2019m not from here. I\u2019m from another dimension, universe, alternate timeline, I don&rsquo;t know! I just know that this. is not. my world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should listen to her Mr. Stark. She knows things\u201d You three were still standing in a triangle position in the living room of the Avengers compound. By now Peter had dropped his backpack onto the couch, becoming more and more curious of your story as he slowly inched closer to you.</p><p>\u201cYou know things?\u201d</p><p>You nodded. Hoping to get Tony on your side. Maybe that way Peter will be more trusting of you.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 convince me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvince you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvince me to help you.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Peter who must have noticed your worried face and anxiousness because he gave you a reassuring nod.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, in my world, you aren\u2019t real. You, Peter, Steve, you all exist through movies and <i>comic books</i> as fictional characters. You\u2019re portrayed by Hollywood actors. In my world, we\u2019ve been following your story since 2008, when you first became Iron Man. I\u2019m literally just a regular girl. I don&rsquo;t know why I was brought here. I literally just graduated high school like 2 days ago\u2026 in 2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u20142019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeahhh thats another thing. Whoever or whatever transported me into this world also somehow brought me back in time to 2017. So I know exactly what\u2019s to occur in your future, and I believe that i\u2019m here to prevent whats supposed to happen..\u201d</p><p>There was a small pause as Tony took everything in. Peter pursed his lips a bit looking at Tony, trying to decipher was he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cCrazy right?\u2014 I had a hard time believing it too \u2014\u201c He began to intervene.</p><p>Then suddenly, Tony unfolded his arms and threw them up. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You said quickly. You took a quick step forward.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Stark. I\u2019m telling the truth. Please, you need to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows things Mr. Stark..\u201d Peter wanted believe that the multi-verse was real.</p><p>\u201cI can prove it to you! If-if you and Pepper were to ever have a kid, you would want to name them Morgan! The reason you were signed the accords is because a woman approached you about her son who she blamed you for his death in Sokovia.\u201d You rambled saying things no one else would know. Hoping he would give you a chance.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that.\u201d he said quickly and warily.</p><p>\u201cLike I said\u2026movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s say I believed you. What is it that you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t know. To figure out what happened to me? To let me help you. I\u2019m not exactly sure. I just know that I would feel a helluva a lot better if you were willing to help me\u201d</p><p>There was a pause between the 3 of you. You felt as if you could feel Tonys mind debating whether or not to believe you. Meanwhile, Peter can sense the anticipation, his spidey-sense for some reason being extremely attuned to you.</p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d Tony said as he turned around and walked away.</p><p>You jumped at his sudden movement and hastily followed behind him \u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you\u201d he said as he continued walking.</p><p><i>Damn he walks fast.</i></p><p>You were trailing behind him confused.</p><p>\u201cReally? Thank you so much Mr. Stark! You have no idea what this means to me\u2014 uhhh but uh where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Tony suddenly stopped and turned around to you. You had to quickly stop yourself so you wouldn\u2019t crash into his back. Peter on the other hand gently ran into you, putting his hands around your waist to gently move you to the side so the crash wouldn&rsquo;t be too impactful. So much for spider senses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you need a place to stay. So\u2026 this is me helping you.\u201d He said opening a door that led to a bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2026 you&rsquo;re letting me stay here?\u201d You were in awe, not seeing this coming at all. Honestly, you thought you would have to fend for yourself.</p><p>\u201cLike I said.. helping you.\u201d Tony said swaying his right hand towards the open bedroom, directing you inside.</p><p>You smiled wide as you walked in.</p><p>\u201cNo way, thank you so much To- I mean, Mr. Stark. \u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask around to my contacts, see what kind of, uhh multiverse information I can get.\u201d</p><p>You were so grateful and in awe that you almost forgot the reason you asked Peter to bring you here.</p><p>\u201cWait, Mr. Stark, theres something you should know\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cUhp, uhp, uhp\u201d he said making a stop motion with his hand. \u201cIs this about the future?\u201d</p><p>You nodded biting your lower lip.</p><p>\u201cDo not say anything about the future until I find out more information. As curious as I am it\u2019s better if I don\u2019t know\u2026yet\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhp uhp uhp\u201d he lowered his head so his eyes were looking at you through the top of his glasses. \u201cDoes it happen soon?\u201d</p><p>You cocked your head to the side in a semi shrug. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it can wait..\u201d</p><p>You let out a deep breath. Knowing that while it probably can wait, you\u2019ve seen what happens, and you wanted to stop it. Knowing that you would bring it up again very soon.</p><p>\u201cOkay. But you need to call Steve. He and his team need to be here. It\u2019s serious.\u201d</p><p>Tony eyed you. Putting two and two together that if what you were saying was true then you probably knew about the phone Steve had give him.</p><p>\u201cKid\u201d Tony said to Peter.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on her\u2026.\u201d He continued as he walked away, leaving you in your temporary room with Peter standing with his hands in his pockets. You let out a sigh, unsure how seriously Tony took you.</p><p>You flailed your arms to either side, only for them to come back down and make a soft slapping sound against you. \u201cThanks, Peter\u2026 for believing me. I-I don\u2019t know what would have happened if you didn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>Peter nodded, smiling.</p><p>\u201cSo what happens? \u201c he asked leaning against the wall next to the door frame.</p><p>You were walking around the room, touching the desk, the bed, the TV, taking it all in. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big thing that happens in the future?\u201d Peter was curious. When you had first asked him to bring you to Tony you were adamant, determined to inform him of the future.</p><p>You shook your head.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s right. I shouldn&rsquo;t say anything.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. An awkward silence looming. His spidey-senses were becoming more acquired to your feelings, something that has never happened before with Peter. He knew he would bring it up later, but maybe for now, it would be weird if you knew.</p><p>\u201cYou know. My room is right next to yours.\u201d</p><p>You sat down on the bed, leaning back slightly with your arms behind you supporting you. \u201cYour room? Don\u2019t you live with May?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean I do. But Mr. Stark made me a room for whenever I do stay, for training purposes or whatever\u2026 maybe.. maybe I can stay here tonight. You know, so you aren\u2019t by yourself, plus.. i\u2019d like to know more about your world\u201d</p><p>You lips turned into a sly smile, content that Peter was befriending you. \u201cDon\u2019t you have school in the morning?\u201d you teased. </p><p>Peter shrugged</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the last day anyway. I\u2019ll have Mr. Stark send in some excuse, it usually works.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at Peter, in awe at how genuine and caring he was.</p><p>\u201cThat would be really great Peter\u2026 thank you\u2026\u201d You yawned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I haven&rsquo;t slept in a while\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don&rsquo;t you take a nap? I should probably head home and help May out with a few things before coming here.\u201d</p><p>You nodded as Peter made his way to the door, grabbing the door handle to close it on his way out.</p><p>\u201cThanks again Peter, Peter Parker..\u201d his name rolling off your tongue in a way that was no longer strange. You had accepted the fact that you were here now. You were glad that the only people who would notice you were missing were gone all summer. So it gave you time to figure everything out.</p><p>It was only 12pm, and you weren\u2019t sure if it was the dimension hopping but you were exhausted and emotional. The adrenaline rush from before was keeping you from feeling this, but now that you were alone it really hit you. These emotions, and questions that should have come when you first arrived were now rushing in.</p><p>You were really in another dimension. Your family and Summer were left behind. You laid down on the bed hugging a pillow for comfort. You knew you had at least all summer to figure out what happened but what if you couldn\u2019t? As much as being here was awesome, your life was there. It wasn\u2019t about your feelings, it was about theirs. How would they feel if you disappeared and never came back? They would be devastated. That was your main worry. How they would feel. For the first time in a while you cried. You cried knowing this could be the only time you do, you wouldn&rsquo;t let this thought consume you. Tony could help you, he had to. You cried until you fell asleep with a tension in your heart.</p><p>_________</p><p>\u201cHey..\u201d you heard faintly.</p><p>You were groggy and your eyes felt puffy.</p><p>\u201cY/N..\u201d</p><p><i>Peter??</i></p><p>For a minute you had forgotten what happened. Then it all suddenly flooded in. You gasped and rocked yourself up, making yourself dizzy.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, are you alright?\u201d You looked at the voice, distinguishing it as Peter as he carefully walked to you and put a hand on your shoulder.</p><p>You brought your hand to your head.</p><p>\u201cSo it wasn&rsquo;t a dream\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head as he stayed looking over you with his hand still on you.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d You asked looking for a clock around the room.</p><p>\u201c6pm, you slept for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, that was one long nap.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled at your remark and then pulled his hand away only to hold it out for you to grab.</p><p>You extended your arm, meeting your hand with his as he gently pulled you to your feet.</p><p><i>Wow, he looks good.</i></p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah! Of course!\u201d You said a bit too enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026 your eyes are puffy. Were you, crying?\u201d If you didn&rsquo;t know any better you would think he cared, even if he barely knew you.</p><p>You shrugged you shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI got sucked into a whole other dimension. I just needed to process my emotions, you know? Let it all out.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>He then smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>You blinked a bit, then scrunched your brows and cocked your head as you thought about it.</p><p>\u201cActually, i\u2019m starving\u2026\u201d Your hands on your stomach.</p><p>Peter turned halfway towards the door \u201cCome on, I know a place\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, is it Delmars?\u201d You said teasingly.</p><p>You walked next to him shoulder to shoulder but letting him lead as he took you out.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it is extremely weird how you know these things\u2026 but yes. It is Delmars..\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>You were currently stuffing your face with the sandwich you just bought at Delmars. Peter had brought the both of you to a roof top overlooking New York.</p><p><i>This is so cool.</i></p><p>\u201cCan I say something?\u201d You asked.</p><p>Peter nodded as he took another bite of his sandwich.</p><p>\u201cBack where i\u2019m from, I don\u2019t have a lot of friends. Well, I actually only have one friend, Summer. I\u2019m just not good at making friends you know? But, here\u2026 as weird as it may sound, I feel comfortable around you. I mean maybe it\u2019s the movies, but even then, I feel like I know you\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, as if agreeing with you.</p><p>\u201cI-I kinda get that sense too. I mean, I feel like I should be less trusting but, since you&rsquo;ve come here my Spidey-sense have been turned up to 100 around you.\u201d</p><p>You were taken back, not understanding. \u201cWhat? Like i\u2019m-i\u2019m dangerous?\u201d</p><p>Peters eyes widened realizing what that sounded like.</p><p>\u201cNo! No! I just mean, I can sorta sense what you\u2019re feeling, like my senses are attuned to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026. interesting\u201d You didn&rsquo;t want to mention that maybe it was for a reason that you had somehow landed in an area the Spider-Man would so happen to be surveilling, as if it was for a reason. As if it was on purpose.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you know what happens to me?\u201d You knew he was asking about his future. Of course you knew what was coming but it\u2019s Peter, no matter how trusting you were of him you couldn&rsquo;t tell him.</p><p>\u201cI do. But, I can\u2019t tell you. I\u2019m sorry\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cI figured\u2026 you know\u2026 multiverse timeline stuff\u201d he smirked amused by this.</p><p>\u201cHey.. Ned, MJ and I are hanging out this tomorrow.. did you want to come along?\u201d he asked changing the subject. </p><p>You loved that he was including you. At the same time you wanted to make sure Thanos was stopped.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know Peter. I should probably check in with Tony tomorrow. I need to be sure he understands the severity of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on Y/N. You and I both know Tony will let you know as soon as he knows anything\u201d</p><p>You got up from your spot, dusting yourself off.</p><p>\u201cFine\u2026 i\u2019ll join.\u201d Peter grinned like a 5 year old. \u201cBut, if i\u2019m going to be here then I want to be trained\u201d </p><p>\u201cTrained? Like&hellip; to fight?\u201d</p><p>You nodded \u201cYeah, to fight, to defend myself. I mean i\u2019ve been kickboxing for a year, but I want to be out in the field if I need to be.\u201d</p><p>Peter paused unsure on how to respond. \u201cI don\u2019t know&hellip; you\u2019ll get hurt\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if i\u2019m trained, I can\u2019t just be a bystander in my own story&hellip; but i\u2019m freezing, why don&rsquo;t we continue this conversation back at the compound\u201d Peter nodded as he got himself up.</p><p>\u201cI need to start my nightly patrol soon anyways.\u201d He reached over his shoulder into his backpack that he had brought with him and pulled out his mask pulling it over his head.</p><p>\u201cWha-what are you doing? We walked here\u2026.\u201d You said knowing where he was going with this.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s faster this way!\u201d He held his hand waiting for you to grab it.</p><p><i>Fucking shit. Here we go again.</i></p><p>You grabbed his hand and he pulled you over to him grabbing you by the waist as you held on tightly to him. You heard a sudden <i>thwip</i> and then you were off into the sky, and just like the first time, with each new web made and grabbed onto your heart dropped, your eyes squeezed shut as you felt the wind rushing through your ears, and just like the first time, but even more so this time, Peter could sense your slight fear and he rubbed your back with his thumb assuringly, letting you know that he had you. </p><p>Only this time, it was as <i>sorta</i> friends and not strangers.</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p style=\"\">Taglist:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbk1MbqCXninj69EroN1JDw\">@wonders-of-the-multiverse</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSXLEsLqnkUqfL4UL5-Fs9A\">@sher-lockedmarvel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWsoQMG2B4L2MsNdmZVI3iA\">@gcfbunny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBqCYEvWTmMCCVgl1Rdb50A\">@vinadee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt5Mrd7qjtHJL4rFHiu1Z0A\">@lunalustrix</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjOYeai7a9ZbRDnEAMKp1qg\">@cubedtriangle</a></p>",

You stood there arms hugging yourself as you slowly looked around. You knew how the Avengers compound looked like from the movies, but actually being here was extremely different. You can still hardly comprehend yourself what was happening.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d Peter called out from the desk. You snapped your head towards him, his arms on the top of the desk while the receptionist was getting paperwork prepared. You walked towards Peter with your arms still around you.</p><p>\u201cUhm whats up?\u201d Peter shifted his eyes towards the receptionist, you looked towards her awaiting any instruction.</p><p>\u201cHello, due to security protocols, before entering with Mr. Parker as a guest, we need fingerprint scans, a DNA sample and a photo for identification purposes\u201d the receptionist informed you as she pushed forward a digital fingerprint scanner.</p><p>You moved your right hand up and placed your fingers on the scanner as a flash of green washed over them.</p><p>\u201cHuh.. honestly, I thought Tony would have more security measures than this.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cOh, He does, but Mr. Parker here has clearance to bring in a guest. So the security measures are not as extreme\u201d They said while the receptionist slid over the prick for the DNA scan.</p><p>You turned your head towards Peter who had a goofy grin on his face.</p><p><i>Tony really does love him. How pure.</i></p><p>After the receptionist took your photo you were able to follow Peter, not really knowing where exactly he was taking you. \u201cDid you hear her? I have clearance, Mr. Stark doesn\u2019t allow that for just anyone!\u201d</p><p>You giggled at his enthusiasm of being so trusted by Tony.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great Peter\u201d</p><p>You walked a bit towards the compound, passing agents, and training facilities until you entered a more private section.</p><p>\u201cNow entering, Peter Parker\u2026 Now entering Y/N Y/L/N\u201d You heard Friday say probably knowing your name because of the process you just had to go through.</p><p>From the looks of it, it looked like the living quarters of the facility, you recognized the living room that Peter had brought you too. As soon as Peter walked into the living room he spun around walking backwards for a bit before stopping. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I brought you here. If you end up being a bad guy Mr. Stark is totally going to kill me!\u201d</p><p>You stopped, leaving a good chunk of distance between yourself and Peter. \u201cTrust me Peter. Tony is going to want to hear this\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear what now?\u201d you heard from behind.</p><p>You turned around as you saw Tony walk in with a grey shirt and a zipped up black hoodie. His sun glasses in his hand as he was wiping them clean.</p><p>\u201cWhoa..\u201d you said to yourself.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!! H-hi, how are you doing sir\u201d Tony looked towards Peter and nodded his head towards him \u201cKid\u201d he then looked towards you and scrunched his eyes as you were unfamiliar to him.</p><p>\u201cOther kid\u201d He spoke nodding towards you as well.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me, why was I <i>summoned</i> here by a couple of teenagers\u201d he said as he put his glasses back on and folded his arms.</p><p>You stared at Tony in shock, fangirling internally that RDJ in Tony Stark form, was in front of you. Peter looked at you then back at Tony, realizing that he should probably say something.</p><p>\u201cW-Well, you see.. Mr. Stark\u2026\u201d Peter took a deep breath before beginning his ramble. \u201cApparently, we arn\u2019t really people, we\u2019re based off of comic books, at least in Y/Ns dimension.. I-I guess that\u2019s true and she\u2026 I-I actually don\u2019t really know why she\u2019s here but she came to me and really begged for my help and now she\u2019s here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Tony scrunched his eyebrows at Peter, quickly glancing at you then back to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>He totally did not get any of that.</p><p>You shook your head snapping out of it.</p><p>\u201cSorry, uhhh Hi. I guess, my name is Y/N Y/L/N, wha-what Peter is trying to say here is.. I\u2019m not from this dimension. You\u2019re a genius, i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about the multi-verse. Well, it\u2019s a real thing and somehow I was transported here, into your dimension.\u201d</p><p>Tony arched an eyebrow up and stifled out a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cFunny, your friend here is funny Parker\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my friend\u201d Peter spoke up. Tony shook his head in confusion at Peter.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not? Then who the hell is he and why is she here\u201d Tony was a bit more defensive now knowing that a total stranger was in the Avengers facility.</p><p>\u201cTony, i\u2019m serious\u201d You said, which caused Tony to direct a questionable look towards you for calling him Tony.</p><p>\u201cS-sorry.. I mean\u2026 Mr. Stark. But I\u2019m serious. I\u2019m not from here. I\u2019m from another dimension, universe, alternate timeline, I don\u2019t know! I just know that this. is not. my world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should listen to her Mr. Stark. She knows things\u201d You three were still standing in a triangle position in the living room of the Avengers compound. By now Peter had dropped his backpack onto the couch, becoming more and more curious of your story as he slowly inched closer to you.</p><p>\u201cYou know things?\u201d</p><p>You nodded. Hoping to get Tony on your side. Maybe that way Peter will be more trusting of you.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 convince me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvince you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvince me to help you.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Peter who must have noticed your worried face and anxiousness because he gave you a reassuring nod.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, in my world, you aren\u2019t real. You, Peter, Steve, you all exist through movies and <i>comic books</i> as fictional characters. You\u2019re portrayed by Hollywood actors. In my world, we\u2019ve been following your story since 2008, when you first became Iron Man. I\u2019m literally just a regular girl. I don\u2019t know why I was brought here. I literally just graduated high school like 2 days ago\u2026 in 2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u20142019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeahhh thats another thing. Whoever or whatever transported me into this world also somehow brought me back in time to 2017. So I know exactly what\u2019s to occur in your future, and I believe that i\u2019m here to prevent whats supposed to happen..\u201d</p><p>There was a small pause as Tony took everything in. Peter pursed his lips a bit looking at Tony, trying to decipher was he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cCrazy right?\u2014 I had a hard time believing it too \u2014\u201c He began to intervene.</p><p>Then suddenly, Tony unfolded his arms and threw them up. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You said quickly. You took a quick step forward.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Stark. I\u2019m telling the truth. Please, you need to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows things Mr. Stark..\u201d Peter wanted believe that the multi-verse was real.</p><p>\u201cI can prove it to you! If-if you and Pepper were to ever have a kid, you would want to name them Morgan! The reason you were signed the accords is because a woman approached you about her son who she blamed you for his death in Sokovia.\u201d You rambled saying things no one else would know. Hoping he would give you a chance.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that.\u201d he said quickly and warily.</p><p>\u201cLike I said\u2026movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s say I believed you. What is it that you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t know. To figure out what happened to me? To let me help you. I\u2019m not exactly sure. I just know that I would feel a helluva a lot better if you were willing to help me\u201d</p><p>There was a pause between the 3 of you. You felt as if you could feel Tonys mind debating whether or not to believe you. Meanwhile, Peter can sense the anticipation, his spidey-sense for some reason being extremely attuned to you.</p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d Tony said as he turned around and walked away.</p><p>You jumped at his sudden movement and hastily followed behind him \u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you\u201d he said as he continued walking.</p><p><i>Damn he walks fast.</i></p><p>You were trailing behind him confused.</p><p>\u201cReally? Thank you so much Mr. Stark! You have no idea what this means to me\u2014 uhhh but uh where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Tony suddenly stopped and turned around to you. You had to quickly stop yourself so you wouldn\u2019t crash into his back. Peter on the other hand gently ran into you, putting his hands around your waist to gently move you to the side so the crash wouldn\u2019t be too impactful. So much for spider senses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you need a place to stay. So\u2026 this is me helping you.\u201d He said opening a door that led to a bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2026 you\u2019re letting me stay here?\u201d You were in awe, not seeing this coming at all. Honestly, you thought you would have to fend for yourself.</p><p>\u201cLike I said.. helping you.\u201d Tony said swaying his right hand towards the open bedroom, directing you inside.</p><p>You smiled wide as you walked in.</p><p>\u201cNo way, thank you so much To- I mean, Mr. Stark. \u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask around to my contacts, see what kind of, uhh multiverse information I can get.\u201d</p><p>You were so grateful and in awe that you almost forgot the reason you asked Peter to bring you here.</p><p>\u201cWait, Mr. Stark, theres something you should know\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cUhp, uhp, uhp\u201d he said making a stop motion with his hand. \u201cIs this about the future?\u201d</p><p>You nodded biting your lower lip.</p><p>\u201cDo not say anything about the future until I find out more information. As curious as I am it\u2019s better if I don\u2019t know\u2026yet\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhp uhp uhp\u201d he lowered his head so his eyes were looking at you through the top of his glasses. \u201cDoes it happen soon?\u201d</p><p>You cocked your head to the side in a semi shrug. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it can wait..\u201d</p><p>You let out a deep breath. Knowing that while it probably can wait, you\u2019ve seen what happens, and you wanted to stop it. Knowing that you would bring it up again very soon.</p><p>\u201cOkay. But you need to call Steve. He and his team need to be here. It\u2019s serious.\u201d</p><p>Tony eyed you. Putting two and two together that if what you were saying was true then you probably knew about the phone Steve had give him.</p><p>\u201cKid\u201d Tony said to Peter.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on her\u2026.\u201d He continued as he walked away, leaving you in your temporary room with Peter standing with his hands in his pockets. You let out a sigh, unsure how seriously Tony took you.</p><p>You flailed your arms to either side, only for them to come back down and make a soft slapping sound against you. \u201cThanks, Peter\u2026 for believing me. I-I don\u2019t know what would have happened if you didn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>Peter nodded, smiling.</p><p>\u201cSo what happens? \u201c he asked leaning against the wall next to the door frame.</p><p>You were walking around the room, touching the desk, the bed, the TV, taking it all in. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big thing that happens in the future?\u201d Peter was curious. When you had first asked him to bring you to Tony you were adamant, determined to inform him of the future.</p><p>You shook your head.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s right. I shouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. An awkward silence looming. His spidey-senses were becoming more acquired to your feelings, something that has never happened before with Peter. He knew he would bring it up later, but maybe for now, it would be weird if you knew.</p><p>\u201cYou know. My room is right next to yours.\u201d</p><p>You sat down on the bed, leaning back slightly with your arms behind you supporting you. \u201cYour room? Don\u2019t you live with May?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean I do. But Mr. Stark made me a room for whenever I do stay, for training purposes or whatever\u2026 maybe.. maybe I can stay here tonight. You know, so you aren\u2019t by yourself, plus.. i\u2019d like to know more about your world\u201d</p><p>You lips turned into a sly smile, content that Peter was befriending you. \u201cDon\u2019t you have school in the morning?\u201d you teased. </p><p>Peter shrugged</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the last day anyway. I\u2019ll have Mr. Stark send in some excuse, it usually works.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at Peter, in awe at how genuine and caring he was.</p><p>\u201cThat would be really great Peter\u2026 thank you\u2026\u201d You yawned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t slept in a while\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a nap? I should probably head home and help May out with a few things before coming here.\u201d</p><p>You nodded as Peter made his way to the door, grabbing the door handle to close it on his way out.</p><p>\u201cThanks again Peter, Peter Parker..\u201d his name rolling off your tongue in a way that was no longer strange. You had accepted the fact that you were here now. You were glad that the only people who would notice you were missing were gone all summer. So it gave you time to figure everything out.</p><p>It was only 12pm, and you weren\u2019t sure if it was the dimension hopping but you were exhausted and emotional. The adrenaline rush from before was keeping you from feeling this, but now that you were alone it really hit you. These emotions, and questions that should have come when you first arrived were now rushing in.</p><p>You were really in another dimension. Your family and Summer were left behind. You laid down on the bed hugging a pillow for comfort. You knew you had at least all summer to figure out what happened but what if you couldn\u2019t? As much as being here was awesome, your life was there. It wasn\u2019t about your feelings, it was about theirs. How would they feel if you disappeared and never came back? They would be devastated. That was your main worry. How they would feel. For the first time in a while you cried. You cried knowing this could be the only time you do, you wouldn\u2019t let this thought consume you. Tony could help you, he had to. You cried until you fell asleep with a tension in your heart.</p><p>_________</p><p>\u201cHey..\u201d you heard faintly.</p><p>You were groggy and your eyes felt puffy.</p><p>\u201cY/N..\u201d</p><p><i>Peter??</i></p><p>For a minute you had forgotten what happened. Then it all suddenly flooded in. You gasped and rocked yourself up, making yourself dizzy.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, are you alright?\u201d You looked at the voice, distinguishing it as Peter as he carefully walked to you and put a hand on your shoulder.</p><p>You brought your hand to your head.</p><p>\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t a dream\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head as he stayed looking over you with his hand still on you.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d You asked looking for a clock around the room.</p><p>\u201c6pm, you slept for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, that was one long nap.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled at your remark and then pulled his hand away only to hold it out for you to grab.</p><p>You extended your arm, meeting your hand with his as he gently pulled you to your feet.</p><p><i>Wow, he looks good.</i></p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah! Of course!\u201d You said a bit too enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026 your eyes are puffy. Were you, crying?\u201d If you didn\u2019t know any better you would think he cared, even if he barely knew you.</p><p>You shrugged you shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI got sucked into a whole other dimension. I just needed to process my emotions, you know? Let it all out.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>He then smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>You blinked a bit, then scrunched your brows and cocked your head as you thought about it.</p><p>\u201cActually, i\u2019m starving\u2026\u201d Your hands on your stomach.</p><p>Peter turned halfway towards the door \u201cCome on, I know a place\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, is it Delmars?\u201d You said teasingly.</p><p>You walked next to him shoulder to shoulder but letting him lead as he took you out.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it is extremely weird how you know these things\u2026 but yes. It is Delmars..\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>You were currently stuffing your face with the sandwich you just bought at Delmars. Peter had brought the both of you to a roof top overlooking New York.</p><p><i>This is so cool.</i></p><p>\u201cCan I say something?\u201d You asked.</p><p>Peter nodded as he took another bite of his sandwich.</p><p>\u201cBack where i\u2019m from, I don\u2019t have a lot of friends. Well, I actually only have one friend, Summer. I\u2019m just not good at making friends you know? But, here\u2026 as weird as it may sound, I feel comfortable around you. I mean maybe it\u2019s the movies, but even then, I feel like I know you\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, as if agreeing with you.</p><p>\u201cI-I kinda get that sense too. I mean, I feel like I should be less trusting but, since you\u2019ve come here my Spidey-sense have been turned up to 100 around you.\u201d</p><p>You were taken back, not understanding. \u201cWhat? Like i\u2019m-i\u2019m dangerous?\u201d</p><p>Peters eyes widened realizing what that sounded like.</p><p>\u201cNo! No! I just mean, I can sorta sense what you\u2019re feeling, like my senses are attuned to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026. interesting\u201d You didn\u2019t want to mention that maybe it was for a reason that you had somehow landed in an area the Spider-Man would so happen to be surveilling, as if it was for a reason. As if it was on purpose.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you know what happens to me?\u201d You knew he was asking about his future. Of course you knew what was coming but it\u2019s Peter, no matter how trusting you were of him you couldn\u2019t tell him.</p><p>\u201cI do. But, I can\u2019t tell you. I\u2019m sorry\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cI figured\u2026 you know\u2026 multiverse timeline stuff\u201d he smirked amused by this.</p><p>\u201cHey.. Ned, MJ and I are hanging out this tomorrow.. did you want to come along?\u201d he asked changing the subject. </p><p>You loved that he was including you. At the same time you wanted to make sure Thanos was stopped.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know Peter. I should probably check in with Tony tomorrow. I need to be sure he understands the severity of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on Y/N. You and I both know Tony will let you know as soon as he knows anything\u201d</p><p>You got up from your spot, dusting yourself off.</p><p>\u201cFine\u2026 i\u2019ll join.\u201d Peter grinned like a 5 year old. \u201cBut, if i\u2019m going to be here then I want to be trained\u201d </p><p>\u201cTrained? Like\u2026 to fight?\u201d</p><p>You nodded \u201cYeah, to fight, to defend myself. I mean i\u2019ve been kickboxing for a year, but I want to be out in the field if I need to be.\u201d</p><p>Peter paused unsure on how to respond. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 you\u2019ll get hurt\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if i\u2019m trained, I can\u2019t just be a bystander in my own story\u2026 but i\u2019m freezing, why don\u2019t we continue this conversation back at the compound\u201d Peter nodded as he got himself up.</p><p>\u201cI need to start my nightly patrol soon anyways.\u201d He reached over his shoulder into his backpack that he had brought with him and pulled out his mask pulling it over his head.</p><p>\u201cWha-what are you doing? We walked here\u2026.\u201d You said knowing where he was going with this.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s faster this way!\u201d He held his hand waiting for you to grab it.</p><p><i>Fucking shit. Here we go again.</i></p><p>You grabbed his hand and he pulled you over to him grabbing you by the waist as you held on tightly to him. You heard a sudden <i>thwip</i> and then you were off into the sky, and just like the first time, with each new web made and grabbed onto your heart dropped, your eyes squeezed shut as you felt the wind rushing through your ears, and just like the first time, but even more so this time, Peter could sense your slight fear and he rubbed your back with his thumb assuringly, letting you know that he had you. </p><p>Only this time, it was as <i>sorta</i> friends and not strangers.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p style=\"\">Taglist:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbk1MbqCXninj69EroN1JDw\">@wonders-of-the-multiverse</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSXLEsLqnkUqfL4UL5-Fs9A\">@sher-lockedmarvel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWsoQMG2B4L2MsNdmZVI3iA\">@gcfbunny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBqCYEvWTmMCCVgl1Rdb50A\">@vinadee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt5Mrd7qjtHJL4rFHiu1Z0A\">@lunalustrix</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjOYeai7a9ZbRDnEAMKp1qg\">@cubedtriangle</a></p>",

You stood there arms hugging yourself as you slowly looked around. You knew how the Avengers compound looked like from the movies, but actually being here was extremely different. You can still hardly comprehend yourself what was happening.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d Peter called out from the desk. You snapped your head towards him, his arms on the top of the desk while the receptionist was getting paperwork prepared. You walked towards Peter with your arms still around you.</p><p>\u201cUhm whats up?\u201d Peter shifted his eyes towards the receptionist, you looked towards her awaiting any instruction.</p><p>\u201cHello, due to security protocols, before entering with Mr. Parker as a guest, we need fingerprint scans, a DNA sample and a photo for identification purposes\u201d the receptionist informed you as she pushed forward a digital fingerprint scanner.</p><p>You moved your right hand up and placed your fingers on the scanner as a flash of green washed over them.</p><p>\u201cHuh.. honestly, I thought Tony would have more security measures than this.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cOh, He does, but Mr. Parker here has clearance to bring in a guest. So the security measures are not as extreme\u201d They said while the receptionist slid over the prick for the DNA scan.</p><p>You turned your head towards Peter who had a goofy grin on his face.</p><p><i>Tony really does love him. How pure.</i></p><p>After the receptionist took your photo you were able to follow Peter, not really knowing where exactly he was taking you. \u201cDid you hear her? I have clearance, Mr. Stark doesn\u2019t allow that for just anyone!\u201d</p><p>You giggled at his enthusiasm of being so trusted by Tony.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great Peter\u201d</p><p>You walked a bit towards the compound, passing agents, and training facilities until you entered a more private section.</p><p>\u201cNow entering, Peter Parker\u2026 Now entering Y/N Y/L/N\u201d You heard Friday say probably knowing your name because of the process you just had to go through.</p><p>From the looks of it, it looked like the living quarters of the facility, you recognized the living room that Peter had brought you too. As soon as Peter walked into the living room he spun around walking backwards for a bit before stopping. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I brought you here. If you end up being a bad guy Mr. Stark is totally going to kill me!\u201d</p><p>You stopped, leaving a good chunk of distance between yourself and Peter. \u201cTrust me Peter. Tony is going to want to hear this\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear what now?\u201d you heard from behind.</p><p>You turned around as you saw Tony walk in with a grey shirt and a zipped up black hoodie. His sun glasses in his hand as he was wiping them clean.</p><p>\u201cWhoa..\u201d you said to yourself.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!! H-hi, how are you doing sir\u201d Tony looked towards Peter and nodded his head towards him \u201cKid\u201d he then looked towards you and scrunched his eyes as you were unfamiliar to him.</p><p>\u201cOther kid\u201d He spoke nodding towards you as well.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me, why was I <i>summoned</i> here by a couple of teenagers\u201d he said as he put his glasses back on and folded his arms.</p><p>You stared at Tony in shock, fangirling internally that RDJ in Tony Stark form, was in front of you. Peter looked at you then back at Tony, realizing that he should probably say something.</p><p>\u201cW-Well, you see.. Mr. Stark\u2026\u201d Peter took a deep breath before beginning his ramble. \u201cApparently, we arn\u2019t really people, we\u2019re based off of comic books, at least in Y/Ns dimension.. I-I guess that\u2019s true and she\u2026 I-I actually don\u2019t really know why she\u2019s here but she came to me and really begged for my help and now she\u2019s here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Tony scrunched his eyebrows at Peter, quickly glancing at you then back to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>He totally did not get any of that.</p><p>You shook your head snapping out of it.</p><p>\u201cSorry, uhhh Hi. I guess, my name is Y/N Y/L/N, wha-what Peter is trying to say here is.. I\u2019m not from this dimension. You\u2019re a genius, i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about the multi-verse. Well, it\u2019s a real thing and somehow I was transported here, into your dimension.\u201d</p><p>Tony arched an eyebrow up and stifled out a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cFunny, your friend here is funny Parker\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my friend\u201d Peter spoke up. Tony shook his head in confusion at Peter.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not? Then who the hell is he and why is she here\u201d Tony was a bit more defensive now knowing that a total stranger was in the Avengers facility.</p><p>\u201cTony, i\u2019m serious\u201d You said, which caused Tony to direct a questionable look towards you for calling him Tony.</p><p>\u201cS-sorry.. I mean\u2026 Mr. Stark. But I\u2019m serious. I\u2019m not from here. I\u2019m from another dimension, universe, alternate timeline, I don\u2019t know! I just know that this. is not. my world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should listen to her Mr. Stark. She knows things\u201d You three were still standing in a triangle position in the living room of the Avengers compound. By now Peter had dropped his backpack onto the couch, becoming more and more curious of your story as he slowly inched closer to you.</p><p>\u201cYou know things?\u201d</p><p>You nodded. Hoping to get Tony on your side. Maybe that way Peter will be more trusting of you.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 convince me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvince you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvince me to help you.\u201d</p><p>You looked at Peter who must have noticed your worried face and anxiousness because he gave you a reassuring nod.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, in my world, you aren\u2019t real. You, Peter, Steve, you all exist through movies and <i>comic books</i> as fictional characters. You\u2019re portrayed by Hollywood actors. In my world, we\u2019ve been following your story since 2008, when you first became Iron Man. I\u2019m literally just a regular girl. I don\u2019t know why I was brought here. I literally just graduated high school like 2 days ago\u2026 in 2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u20142019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeahhh thats another thing. Whoever or whatever transported me into this world also somehow brought me back in time to 2017. So I know exactly what\u2019s to occur in your future, and I believe that i\u2019m here to prevent whats supposed to happen..\u201d</p><p>There was a small pause as Tony took everything in. Peter pursed his lips a bit looking at Tony, trying to decipher was he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cCrazy right?\u2014 I had a hard time believing it too \u2014\u201c He began to intervene.</p><p>Then suddenly, Tony unfolded his arms and threw them up. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You said quickly. You took a quick step forward.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Stark. I\u2019m telling the truth. Please, you need to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows things Mr. Stark..\u201d Peter wanted believe that the multi-verse was real.</p><p>\u201cI can prove it to you! If-if you and Pepper were to ever have a kid, you would want to name them Morgan! The reason you were signed the accords is because a woman approached you about her son who she blamed you for his death in Sokovia.\u201d You rambled saying things no one else would know. Hoping he would give you a chance.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that.\u201d he said quickly and warily.</p><p>\u201cLike I said\u2026movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s say I believed you. What is it that you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t know. To figure out what happened to me? To let me help you. I\u2019m not exactly sure. I just know that I would feel a helluva a lot better if you were willing to help me\u201d</p><p>There was a pause between the 3 of you. You felt as if you could feel Tonys mind debating whether or not to believe you. Meanwhile, Peter can sense the anticipation, his spidey-sense for some reason being extremely attuned to you.</p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d Tony said as he turned around and walked away.</p><p>You jumped at his sudden movement and hastily followed behind him \u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you\u201d he said as he continued walking.</p><p><i>Damn he walks fast.</i></p><p>You were trailing behind him confused.</p><p>\u201cReally? Thank you so much Mr. Stark! You have no idea what this means to me\u2014 uhhh but uh where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Tony suddenly stopped and turned around to you. You had to quickly stop yourself so you wouldn\u2019t crash into his back. Peter on the other hand gently ran into you, putting his hands around your waist to gently move you to the side so the crash wouldn\u2019t be too impactful. So much for spider senses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you need a place to stay. So\u2026 this is me helping you.\u201d He said opening a door that led to a bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2026 you\u2019re letting me stay here?\u201d You were in awe, not seeing this coming at all. Honestly, you thought you would have to fend for yourself.</p><p>\u201cLike I said.. helping you.\u201d Tony said swaying his right hand towards the open bedroom, directing you inside.</p><p>You smiled wide as you walked in.</p><p>\u201cNo way, thank you so much To- I mean, Mr. Stark. \u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask around to my contacts, see what kind of, uhh multiverse information I can get.\u201d</p><p>You were so grateful and in awe that you almost forgot the reason you asked Peter to bring you here.</p><p>\u201cWait, Mr. Stark, theres something you should know\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cUhp, uhp, uhp\u201d he said making a stop motion with his hand. \u201cIs this about the future?\u201d</p><p>You nodded biting your lower lip.</p><p>\u201cDo not say anything about the future until I find out more information. As curious as I am it\u2019s better if I don\u2019t know\u2026yet\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhp uhp uhp\u201d he lowered his head so his eyes were looking at you through the top of his glasses. \u201cDoes it happen soon?\u201d</p><p>You cocked your head to the side in a semi shrug. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it can wait..\u201d</p><p>You let out a deep breath. Knowing that while it probably can wait, you\u2019ve seen what happens, and you wanted to stop it. Knowing that you would bring it up again very soon.</p><p>\u201cOkay. But you need to call Steve. He and his team need to be here. It\u2019s serious.\u201d</p><p>Tony eyed you. Putting two and two together that if what you were saying was true then you probably knew about the phone Steve had give him.</p><p>\u201cKid\u201d Tony said to Peter.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on her\u2026.\u201d He continued as he walked away, leaving you in your temporary room with Peter standing with his hands in his pockets. You let out a sigh, unsure how seriously Tony took you.</p><p>You flailed your arms to either side, only for them to come back down and make a soft slapping sound against you. \u201cThanks, Peter\u2026 for believing me. I-I don\u2019t know what would have happened if you didn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>Peter nodded, smiling.</p><p>\u201cSo what happens? \u201c he asked leaning against the wall next to the door frame.</p><p>You were walking around the room, touching the desk, the bed, the TV, taking it all in. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big thing that happens in the future?\u201d Peter was curious. When you had first asked him to bring you to Tony you were adamant, determined to inform him of the future.</p><p>You shook your head.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s right. I shouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. An awkward silence looming. His spidey-senses were becoming more acquired to your feelings, something that has never happened before with Peter. He knew he would bring it up later, but maybe for now, it would be weird if you knew.</p><p>\u201cYou know. My room is right next to yours.\u201d</p><p>You sat down on the bed, leaning back slightly with your arms behind you supporting you. \u201cYour room? Don\u2019t you live with May?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean I do. But Mr. Stark made me a room for whenever I do stay, for training purposes or whatever\u2026 maybe.. maybe I can stay here tonight. You know, so you aren\u2019t by yourself, plus.. i\u2019d like to know more about your world\u201d</p><p>You lips turned into a sly smile, content that Peter was befriending you. \u201cDon\u2019t you have school in the morning?\u201d you teased. </p><p>Peter shrugged</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the last day anyway. I\u2019ll have Mr. Stark send in some excuse, it usually works.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at Peter, in awe at how genuine and caring he was.</p><p>\u201cThat would be really great Peter\u2026 thank you\u2026\u201d You yawned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t slept in a while\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a nap? I should probably head home and help May out with a few things before coming here.\u201d</p><p>You nodded as Peter made his way to the door, grabbing the door handle to close it on his way out.</p><p>\u201cThanks again Peter, Peter Parker..\u201d his name rolling off your tongue in a way that was no longer strange. You had accepted the fact that you were here now. You were glad that the only people who would notice you were missing were gone all summer. So it gave you time to figure everything out.</p><p>It was only 12pm, and you weren\u2019t sure if it was the dimension hopping but you were exhausted and emotional. The adrenaline rush from before was keeping you from feeling this, but now that you were alone it really hit you. These emotions, and questions that should have come when you first arrived were now rushing in.</p><p>You were really in another dimension. Your family and Summer were left behind. You laid down on the bed hugging a pillow for comfort. You knew you had at least all summer to figure out what happened but what if you couldn\u2019t? As much as being here was awesome, your life was there. It wasn\u2019t about your feelings, it was about theirs. How would they feel if you disappeared and never came back? They would be devastated. That was your main worry. How they would feel. For the first time in a while you cried. You cried knowing this could be the only time you do, you wouldn\u2019t let this thought consume you. Tony could help you, he had to. You cried until you fell asleep with a tension in your heart.</p><p>_________</p><p>\u201cHey..\u201d you heard faintly.</p><p>You were groggy and your eyes felt puffy.</p><p>\u201cY/N..\u201d</p><p><i>Peter??</i></p><p>For a minute you had forgotten what happened. Then it all suddenly flooded in. You gasped and rocked yourself up, making yourself dizzy.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, are you alright?\u201d You looked at the voice, distinguishing it as Peter as he carefully walked to you and put a hand on your shoulder.</p><p>You brought your hand to your head.</p><p>\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t a dream\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head as he stayed looking over you with his hand still on you.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d You asked looking for a clock around the room.</p><p>\u201c6pm, you slept for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, that was one long nap.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled at your remark and then pulled his hand away only to hold it out for you to grab.</p><p>You extended your arm, meeting your hand with his as he gently pulled you to your feet.</p><p><i>Wow, he looks good.</i></p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah! Of course!\u201d You said a bit too enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026 your eyes are puffy. Were you, crying?\u201d If you didn\u2019t know any better you would think he cared, even if he barely knew you.</p><p>You shrugged you shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI got sucked into a whole other dimension. I just needed to process my emotions, you know? Let it all out.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>He then smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>You blinked a bit, then scrunched your brows and cocked your head as you thought about it.</p><p>\u201cActually, i\u2019m starving\u2026\u201d Your hands on your stomach.</p><p>Peter turned halfway towards the door \u201cCome on, I know a place\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, is it Delmars?\u201d You said teasingly.</p><p>You walked next to him shoulder to shoulder but letting him lead as he took you out.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it is extremely weird how you know these things\u2026 but yes. It is Delmars..\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>You were currently stuffing your face with the sandwich you just bought at Delmars. Peter had brought the both of you to a roof top overlooking New York.</p><p><i>This is so cool.</i></p><p>\u201cCan I say something?\u201d You asked.</p><p>Peter nodded as he took another bite of his sandwich.</p><p>\u201cBack where i\u2019m from, I don\u2019t have a lot of friends. Well, I actually only have one friend, Summer. I\u2019m just not good at making friends you know? But, here\u2026 as weird as it may sound, I feel comfortable around you. I mean maybe it\u2019s the movies, but even then, I feel like I know you\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, as if agreeing with you.</p><p>\u201cI-I kinda get that sense too. I mean, I feel like I should be less trusting but, since you\u2019ve come here my Spidey-sense have been turned up to 100 around you.\u201d</p><p>You were taken back, not understanding. \u201cWhat? Like i\u2019m-i\u2019m dangerous?\u201d</p><p>Peters eyes widened realizing what that sounded like.</p><p>\u201cNo! No! I just mean, I can sorta sense what you\u2019re feeling, like my senses are attuned to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026. interesting\u201d You didn\u2019t want to mention that maybe it was for a reason that you had somehow landed in an area the Spider-Man would so happen to be surveilling, as if it was for a reason. As if it was on purpose.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you know what happens to me?\u201d You knew he was asking about his future. Of course you knew what was coming but it\u2019s Peter, no matter how trusting you were of him you couldn\u2019t tell him.</p><p>\u201cI do. But, I can\u2019t tell you. I\u2019m sorry\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cI figured\u2026 you know\u2026 multiverse timeline stuff\u201d he smirked amused by this.</p><p>\u201cHey.. Ned, MJ and I are hanging out this tomorrow.. did you want to come along?\u201d he asked changing the subject. </p><p>You loved that he was including you. At the same time you wanted to make sure Thanos was stopped.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know Peter. I should probably check in with Tony tomorrow. I need to be sure he understands the severity of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on Y/N. You and I both know Tony will let you know as soon as he knows anything\u201d</p><p>You got up from your spot, dusting yourself off.</p><p>\u201cFine\u2026 i\u2019ll join.\u201d Peter grinned like a 5 year old. \u201cBut, if i\u2019m going to be here then I want to be trained\u201d </p><p>\u201cTrained? Like\u2026 to fight?\u201d</p><p>You nodded \u201cYeah, to fight, to defend myself. I mean i\u2019ve been kickboxing for a year, but I want to be out in the field if I need to be.\u201d</p><p>Peter paused unsure on how to respond. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 you\u2019ll get hurt\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if i\u2019m trained, I can\u2019t just be a bystander in my own story\u2026 but i\u2019m freezing, why don\u2019t we continue this conversation back at the compound\u201d Peter nodded as he got himself up.</p><p>\u201cI need to start my nightly patrol soon anyways.\u201d He reached over his shoulder into his backpack that he had brought with him and pulled out his mask pulling it over his head.</p><p>\u201cWha-what are you doing? We walked here\u2026.\u201d You said knowing where he was going with this.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s faster this way!\u201d He held his hand waiting for you to grab it.</p><p><i>Fucking shit. Here we go again.</i></p><p>You grabbed his hand and he pulled you over to him grabbing you by the waist as you held on tightly to him. You heard a sudden <i>thwip</i> and then you were off into the sky, and just like the first time, with each new web made and grabbed onto your heart dropped, your eyes squeezed shut as you felt the wind rushing through your ears, and just like the first time, but even more so this time, Peter could sense your slight fear and he rubbed your back with his thumb assuringly, letting you know that he had you. </p><p>Only this time, it was as <i>sorta</i> friends and not strangers.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p style=\"\">Taglist:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbk1MbqCXninj69EroN1JDw\">@wonders-of-the-multiverse</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSXLEsLqnkUqfL4UL5-Fs9A\">@sher-lockedmarvel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWsoQMG2B4L2MsNdmZVI3iA\">@gcfbunny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBqCYEvWTmMCCVgl1Rdb50A\">@vinadee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt5Mrd7qjtHJL4rFHiu1Z0A\">@lunalustrix</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjOYeai7a9ZbRDnEAMKp1qg\">@cubedtriangle</a></p>",

You stood there arms hugging yourself as you slowly looked around. You knew how the Avengers compound looked like from the movies, but actually being here was extremely different. You can still hardly comprehend yourself what was happening.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; Peter called out from the desk. You snapped your head towards him, his arms on the top of the desk while the receptionist was getting paperwork prepared. You walked towards Peter with your arms still around you.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm whats up?&rdquo; Peter shifted his eyes towards the receptionist, you looked towards her awaiting any instruction.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, due to security protocols, before entering with Mr. Parker as a guest, we need fingerprint scans, a DNA sample and a photo for identification purposes&rdquo; the receptionist informed you as she pushed forward a digital fingerprint scanner.</p><p>You moved your right hand up and placed your fingers on the scanner as a flash of green washed over them.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh.. honestly, I thought Tony would have more security measures than this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, He does, but Mr. Parker here has clearance to bring in a guest. So the security measures are not as extreme&rdquo; They said while the receptionist slid over the prick for the DNA scan.</p><p>You turned your head towards Peter who had a goofy grin on his face.</p><p><i>Tony really does love him. How pure.</i></p><p>After the receptionist took your photo you were able to follow Peter, not really knowing where exactly he was taking you. &ldquo;Did you hear her? I have clearance, Mr. Stark doesn&rsquo;t allow that for just anyone!&rdquo;</p><p>You giggled at his enthusiasm of being so trusted by Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great Peter&rdquo;</p><p>You walked a bit towards the compound, passing agents, and training facilities until you entered a more private section.</p><p>&ldquo;Now entering, Peter Parker&hellip; Now entering Y/N Y/L/N&rdquo; You heard Friday say probably knowing your name because of the process you just had to go through.</p><p>From the looks of it, it looked like the living quarters of the facility, you recognized the living room that Peter had brought you too. As soon as Peter walked into the living room he spun around walking backwards for a bit before stopping. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I brought you here. If you end up being a bad guy Mr. Stark is totally going to kill me!&rdquo;</p><p>You stopped, leaving a good chunk of distance between yourself and Peter. &ldquo;Trust me Peter. Tony is going to want to hear this&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hear what now?&rdquo; you heard from behind.</p><p>You turned around as you saw Tony walk in with a grey shirt and a zipped up black hoodie. His sun glasses in his hand as he was wiping them clean.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa..&rdquo; you said to yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark!! H-hi, how are you doing sir&rdquo; Tony looked towards Peter and nodded his head towards him &ldquo;Kid&rdquo; he then looked towards you and scrunched his eyes as you were unfamiliar to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Other kid&rdquo; He spoke nodding towards you as well.</p><p>&ldquo;So, tell me, why was I <i>summoned</i> here by a couple of teenagers&rdquo; he said as he put his glasses back on and folded his arms.</p><p>You stared at Tony in shock, fangirling internally that RDJ in Tony Stark form, was in front of you. Peter looked at you then back at Tony, realizing that he should probably say something.</p><p>&ldquo;W-Well, you see.. Mr. Stark&hellip;&rdquo; Peter took a deep breath before beginning his ramble. &ldquo;Apparently, we arn&rsquo;t really people, we&rsquo;re based off of comic books, at least in Y/Ns dimension.. I-I guess that&rsquo;s true and she&hellip; I-I actually don&rsquo;t really know why she&rsquo;s here but she came to me and really begged for my help and now she&rsquo;s here&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Tony scrunched his eyebrows at Peter, quickly glancing at you then back to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what?&rdquo;</p><p>He totally did not get any of that.</p><p>You shook your head snapping out of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, uhhh Hi. I guess, my name is Y/N Y/L/N, wha-what Peter is trying to say here is.. I&rsquo;m not from this dimension. You&rsquo;re a genius, i&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard about the multi-verse. Well, it&rsquo;s a real thing and somehow I was transported here, into your dimension.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony arched an eyebrow up and stifled out a chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Funny, your friend here is funny Parker&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not my friend&rdquo; Peter spoke up. Tony shook his head in confusion at Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not? Then who the hell is he and why is she here&rdquo; Tony was a bit more defensive now knowing that a total stranger was in the Avengers facility.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, i&rsquo;m serious&rdquo; You said, which caused Tony to direct a questionable look towards you for calling him Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;S-sorry.. I mean&hellip; Mr. Stark. But I&rsquo;m serious. I&rsquo;m not from here. I&rsquo;m from another dimension, universe, alternate timeline, I don&rsquo;t know! I just know that this. is not. my world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should listen to her Mr. Stark. She knows things&rdquo; You three were still standing in a triangle position in the living room of the Avengers compound. By now Peter had dropped his backpack onto the couch, becoming more and more curious of your story as he slowly inched closer to you.</p><p>&ldquo;You know things?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded. Hoping to get Tony on your side. Maybe that way Peter will be more trusting of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip; convince me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Convince you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Convince me to help you.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at Peter who must have noticed your worried face and anxiousness because he gave you a reassuring nod.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, well, in my world, you aren&rsquo;t real. You, Peter, Steve, you all exist through movies and <i>comic books</i> as fictional characters. You&rsquo;re portrayed by Hollywood actors. In my world, we&rsquo;ve been following your story since 2008, when you first became Iron Man. I&rsquo;m literally just a regular girl. I don&rsquo;t know why I was brought here. I literally just graduated high school like 2 days ago&hellip; in 2019.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;2019?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeahhh thats another thing. Whoever or whatever transported me into this world also somehow brought me back in time to 2017. So I know exactly what&rsquo;s to occur in your future, and I believe that i&rsquo;m here to prevent whats supposed to happen..&rdquo;</p><p>There was a small pause as Tony took everything in. Peter pursed his lips a bit looking at Tony, trying to decipher was he was thinking.</p><p>&ldquo;Crazy right?&mdash; I had a hard time believing it too &mdash;&ldquo; He began to intervene.</p><p>Then suddenly, Tony unfolded his arms and threw them up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You said quickly. You took a quick step forward.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Stark. I&rsquo;m telling the truth. Please, you need to believe me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She knows things Mr. Stark..&rdquo; Peter wanted believe that the multi-verse was real.</p><p>&ldquo;I can prove it to you! If-if you and Pepper were to ever have a kid, you would want to name them Morgan! The reason you were signed the accords is because a woman approached you about her son who she blamed you for his death in Sokovia.&rdquo; You rambled saying things no one else would know. Hoping he would give you a chance.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know that.&rdquo; he said quickly and warily.</p><p>&ldquo;Like I said&hellip;movies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Let&rsquo;s say I believed you. What is it that you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I- I don&rsquo;t know. To figure out what happened to me? To let me help you. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure. I just know that I would feel a helluva a lot better if you were willing to help me&rdquo;</p><p>There was a pause between the 3 of you. You felt as if you could feel Tonys mind debating whether or not to believe you. Meanwhile, Peter can sense the anticipation, his spidey-sense for some reason being extremely attuned to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright&rdquo; Tony said as he turned around and walked away.</p><p>You jumped at his sudden movement and hastily followed behind him &ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you&rdquo; he said as he continued walking.</p><p><i>Damn he walks fast.</i></p><p>You were trailing behind him confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Thank you so much Mr. Stark! You have no idea what this means to me&mdash; uhhh but uh where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony suddenly stopped and turned around to you. You had to quickly stop yourself so you wouldn&rsquo;t crash into his back. Peter on the other hand gently ran into you, putting his hands around your waist to gently move you to the side so the crash wouldn&rsquo;t be too impactful. So much for spider senses.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming you need a place to stay. So&hellip; this is me helping you.&rdquo; He said opening a door that led to a bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait&hellip; you&rsquo;re letting me stay here?&rdquo; You were in awe, not seeing this coming at all. Honestly, you thought you would have to fend for yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;Like I said.. helping you.&rdquo; Tony said swaying his right hand towards the open bedroom, directing you inside.</p><p>You smiled wide as you walked in.</p><p>&ldquo;No way, thank you so much To- I mean, Mr. Stark. &ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask around to my contacts, see what kind of, uhh multiverse information I can get.&rdquo;</p><p>You were so grateful and in awe that you almost forgot the reason you asked Peter to bring you here.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, Mr. Stark, theres something you should know&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhp, uhp, uhp&rdquo; he said making a stop motion with his hand. &ldquo;Is this about the future?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded biting your lower lip.</p><p>&ldquo;Do not say anything about the future until I find out more information. As curious as I am it&rsquo;s better if I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;yet&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhp uhp uhp&rdquo; he lowered his head so his eyes were looking at you through the top of his glasses. &ldquo;Does it happen soon?&rdquo;</p><p>You cocked your head to the side in a semi shrug. &ldquo;I guess not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then it can wait..&rdquo;</p><p>You let out a deep breath. Knowing that while it probably can wait, you&rsquo;ve seen what happens, and you wanted to stop it. Knowing that you would bring it up again very soon.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. But you need to call Steve. He and his team need to be here. It&rsquo;s serious.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony eyed you. Putting two and two together that if what you were saying was true then you probably knew about the phone Steve had give him.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid&rdquo; Tony said to Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep an eye on her&hellip;.&rdquo; He continued as he walked away, leaving you in your temporary room with Peter standing with his hands in his pockets. You let out a sigh, unsure how seriously Tony took you.</p><p>You flailed your arms to either side, only for them to come back down and make a soft slapping sound against you. &ldquo;Thanks, Peter&hellip; for believing me. I-I don&rsquo;t know what would have happened if you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter nodded, smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;So what happens? &ldquo; he asked leaning against the wall next to the door frame.</p><p>You were walking around the room, touching the desk, the bed, the TV, taking it all in. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big thing that happens in the future?&rdquo; Peter was curious. When you had first asked him to bring you to Tony you were adamant, determined to inform him of the future.</p><p>You shook your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s right. I shouldn&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded. An awkward silence looming. His spidey-senses were becoming more acquired to your feelings, something that has never happened before with Peter. He knew he would bring it up later, but maybe for now, it would be weird if you knew.</p><p>&ldquo;You know. My room is right next to yours.&rdquo;</p><p>You sat down on the bed, leaning back slightly with your arms behind you supporting you. &ldquo;Your room? Don&rsquo;t you live with May?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I mean I do. But Mr. Stark made me a room for whenever I do stay, for training purposes or whatever&hellip; maybe.. maybe I can stay here tonight. You know, so you aren&rsquo;t by yourself, plus.. i&rsquo;d like to know more about your world&rdquo;</p><p>You lips turned into a sly smile, content that Peter was befriending you. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have school in the morning?&rdquo; you teased. </p><p>Peter shrugged</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last day anyway. I&rsquo;ll have Mr. Stark send in some excuse, it usually works.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled at Peter, in awe at how genuine and caring he was.</p><p>&ldquo;That would be really great Peter&hellip; thank you&hellip;&rdquo; You yawned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I haven&rsquo;t slept in a while&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take a nap? I should probably head home and help May out with a few things before coming here.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded as Peter made his way to the door, grabbing the door handle to close it on his way out.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks again Peter, Peter Parker..&rdquo; his name rolling off your tongue in a way that was no longer strange. You had accepted the fact that you were here now. You were glad that the only people who would notice you were missing were gone all summer. So it gave you time to figure everything out.</p><p>It was only 12pm, and you weren&rsquo;t sure if it was the dimension hopping but you were exhausted and emotional. The adrenaline rush from before was keeping you from feeling this, but now that you were alone it really hit you. These emotions, and questions that should have come when you first arrived were now rushing in.</p><p>You were really in another dimension. Your family and Summer were left behind. You laid down on the bed hugging a pillow for comfort. You knew you had at least all summer to figure out what happened but what if you couldn&rsquo;t? As much as being here was awesome, your life was there. It wasn&rsquo;t about your feelings, it was about theirs. How would they feel if you disappeared and never came back? They would be devastated. That was your main worry. How they would feel. For the first time in a while you cried. You cried knowing this could be the only time you do, you wouldn&rsquo;t let this thought consume you. Tony could help you, he had to. You cried until you fell asleep with a tension in your heart.</p><p>_________</p><p>&ldquo;Hey..&rdquo; you heard faintly.</p><p>You were groggy and your eyes felt puffy.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N..&rdquo;</p><p><i>Peter??</i></p><p>For a minute you had forgotten what happened. Then it all suddenly flooded in. You gasped and rocked yourself up, making yourself dizzy.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, are you alright?&rdquo; You looked at the voice, distinguishing it as Peter as he carefully walked to you and put a hand on your shoulder.</p><p>You brought your hand to your head.</p><p>&ldquo;So it wasn&rsquo;t a dream&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head as he stayed looking over you with his hand still on you.</p><p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; You asked looking for a clock around the room.</p><p>&ldquo;6pm, you slept for a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Man, that was one long nap.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter chuckled at your remark and then pulled his hand away only to hold it out for you to grab.</p><p>You extended your arm, meeting your hand with his as he gently pulled you to your feet.</p><p><i>Wow, he looks good.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah! Of course!&rdquo; You said a bit too enthusiastically.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip; your eyes are puffy. Were you, crying?&rdquo; If you didn&rsquo;t know any better you would think he cared, even if he barely knew you.</p><p>You shrugged you shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;I got sucked into a whole other dimension. I just needed to process my emotions, you know? Let it all out.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll figure it out.&rdquo;</p><p>He then smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;You hungry?&rdquo;</p><p>You blinked a bit, then scrunched your brows and cocked your head as you thought about it.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, i&rsquo;m starving&hellip;&rdquo; Your hands on your stomach.</p><p>Peter turned halfway towards the door &ldquo;Come on, I know a place&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, is it Delmars?&rdquo; You said teasingly.</p><p>You walked next to him shoulder to shoulder but letting him lead as he took you out.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, it is extremely weird how you know these things&hellip; but yes. It is Delmars..&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>You were currently stuffing your face with the sandwich you just bought at Delmars. Peter had brought the both of you to a roof top overlooking New York.</p><p><i>This is so cool.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Can I say something?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>Peter nodded as he took another bite of his sandwich.</p><p>&ldquo;Back where i&rsquo;m from, I don&rsquo;t have a lot of friends. Well, I actually only have one friend, Summer. I&rsquo;m just not good at making friends you know? But, here&hellip; as weird as it may sound, I feel comfortable around you. I mean maybe it&rsquo;s the movies, but even then, I feel like I know you&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded, as if agreeing with you.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I kinda get that sense too. I mean, I feel like I should be less trusting but, since you&rsquo;ve come here my Spidey-sense have been turned up to 100 around you.&rdquo;</p><p>You were taken back, not understanding. &ldquo;What? Like i&rsquo;m-i&rsquo;m dangerous?&rdquo;</p><p>Peters eyes widened realizing what that sounded like.</p><p>&ldquo;No! No! I just mean, I can sorta sense what you&rsquo;re feeling, like my senses are attuned to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &hellip;. interesting&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t want to mention that maybe it was for a reason that you had somehow landed in an area the Spider-Man would so happen to be surveilling, as if it was for a reason. As if it was on purpose.</p><p>&ldquo;So, do you know what happens to me?&rdquo; You knew he was asking about his future. Of course you knew what was coming but it&rsquo;s Peter, no matter how trusting you were of him you couldn&rsquo;t tell him.</p><p>&ldquo;I do. But, I can&rsquo;t tell you. I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shrugged. &ldquo;I figured&hellip; you know&hellip; multiverse timeline stuff&rdquo; he smirked amused by this.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.. Ned, MJ and I are hanging out this tomorrow.. did you want to come along?&rdquo; he asked changing the subject. </p><p>You loved that he was including you. At the same time you wanted to make sure Thanos was stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know Peter. I should probably check in with Tony tomorrow. I need to be sure he understands the severity of this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on Y/N. You and I both know Tony will let you know as soon as he knows anything&rdquo;</p><p>You got up from your spot, dusting yourself off.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine&hellip; i&rsquo;ll join.&rdquo; Peter grinned like a 5 year old. &ldquo;But, if i&rsquo;m going to be here then I want to be trained&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Trained? Like&hellip; to fight?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded &ldquo;Yeah, to fight, to defend myself. I mean i&rsquo;ve been kickboxing for a year, but I want to be out in the field if I need to be.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter paused unsure on how to respond. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; you&rsquo;ll get hurt&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not if i&rsquo;m trained, I can&rsquo;t just be a bystander in my own story&hellip; but i&rsquo;m freezing, why don&rsquo;t we continue this conversation back at the compound&rdquo; Peter nodded as he got himself up.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to start my nightly patrol soon anyways.&rdquo; He reached over his shoulder into his backpack that he had brought with him and pulled out his mask pulling it over his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Wha-what are you doing? We walked here&hellip;.&rdquo; You said knowing where he was going with this.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s faster this way!&rdquo; He held his hand waiting for you to grab it.</p><p><i>Fucking shit. Here we go again.</i></p><p>You grabbed his hand and he pulled you over to him grabbing you by the waist as you held on tightly to him. You heard a sudden <i>thwip</i> and then you were off into the sky, and just like the first time, with each new web made and grabbed onto your heart dropped, your eyes squeezed shut as you felt the wind rushing through your ears, and just like the first time, but even more so this time, Peter could sense your slight fear and he rubbed your back with his thumb assuringly, letting you know that he had you. </p><p>Only this time, it was as <i>sorta</i> friends and not strangers.</p><p><br /></p><p>Taglist:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbk1MbqCXninj69EroN1JDw\">@wonders-of-the-multiverse</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSXLEsLqnkUqfL4UL5-Fs9A\">@sher-lockedmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWsoQMG2B4L2MsNdmZVI3iA\">@gcfbunny</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBqCYEvWTmMCCVgl1Rdb50A\">@vinadee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt5Mrd7qjtHJL4rFHiu1Z0A\">@lunalustrix</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjOYeai7a9ZbRDnEAMKp1qg\">@cubedtriangle</a></p>",

You can still hardly comprehend yourself what was happening.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; Peter called out from the desk. You snapped your head towards him, his arms on the top of the desk while the receptionist was getting paperwork prepared. You walked towards Peter with your arms still around you.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Uhm whats up?&rdquo; Peter shifted his eyes towards the receptionist, you looked towards her awaiting any instruction.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hello, due to security protocols, before entering with Mr. Parker as a guest, we need fingerprint scans, a DNA sample and a photo for identification purposes&rdquo; the receptionist informed you as she pushed forward a digital fingerprint scanner.</p>\n<p>You moved your right hand up and placed your fingers on the scanner as a flash of green washed over them.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Huh.. honestly, I thought Tony would have more security measures than this.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
