Also, as an incentive, he has agreed to let participation in the play count as the arts course requirement!\u201d</p><p>Lucas sees many of the students sit a bit straighter at this. Normally the arts requirement was fulfilled by taking either a painting or cinema class, both of which were taught by Monsieur Robart, a stern, elderly man who had a reputation for failing at least half of his students every year. The chance to skip out on his classes was an interesting prospect, to say the least.</p><p>Daphn\u00e9 smiles and says, \u201cSo after much consideration between us girls,\u201d gesturing towards Alexia, Imane, Emma, and Manon, \u201cwe\u2019ve decided that what better play to perform than one rooted in Parisian history? The play that we\u2019ll put on this year is none other than the Phantom of the Opera!\u201d</p><p>Whispers of excitement go around the room, and Daphn\u00e9 continues, encouraged by the response. \u201cWe\u2019ll hold auditions here in foyer tomorrow after classes, and everyone, regardless of singing or acting ability, is encouraged to try out! There will also be positions open for those that wish to help with production and technical aspects of the performance.\u201d</p><p>Alexia steps in and says, \u201cif you\u2019re interested in trying out, a piece of paper is going around now for you to write your names on.\u201d</p><p>Yann leans over to Lucas and mutters, \u201cAre we doing this?\u201d</p><p>Basile interrupts with a hissed, \u201cYes, of course we are! This is my one chance to prove myself to Daphn\u00e9!\u201d</p><p>Yann rolls his eyes and continues, \u201cWhat do you think, Lucas? Personally, I don\u2019t want to be stuck with Monsieur Robart. And we could just be a part of the production crew?\u201d</p><p>Lucas thinks for a second, that is true, and he can\u2019t really afford to fail any classes.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he responds, \u201cbut only the production crew. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m singing.\u201d</p><p>Basile lets out an excited whoop, rushing out of his seat to greet Daphn\u00e9, no doubt to pester her about helping out. Arthur shakes his head exasperatedly before reaching for the audition paper. \u201cI\u2019ll just write all our names down next to production crew, yeah?\u201d Lucas and Yann nod.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d starts Yann, \u201cit should be interesting, right?\u201d Lucas hums in agreement, unaware of just how interesting this was going to get.</p><p>This is boring, Lucas thinks. Auditions had been going fairly smoothly, the group quickly deciding that Manon fit the role of Christine Daa\u00e9, the female lead, the best. Her voice was steady and warm, and she acted out Christine\u2019s sad backstory with astonishing realism. Alexia was to play Meg Giry, Christine\u2019s bubbly and sweet friend, while Imane was casted as her mother, Madame Giry, the stern and respected ballet instructor of the opera.</p><p>The group then casted Chlo\u00e9 as Carlotta, the rather shrill and demanding Prima Donna that competed with Christine. Lucas thought the role suited her, honestly. Lastly, the opera directors Andr\u00e9 and Firmin were filled by Yann and Basile. Daphne forced them two to try out (Basile needed very little convincing), and the group decided they were a hilarious duo. Lucas looked at Yann, betrayed for leaving him to join the cast, to which Yann shrugged and mouthed a \u201csorry.\u201d</p><p>The biggest problem the group was having now was finding Raoul, the wealthy love interest of Christine and the Phantom\u2019s competition. Raoul was supposed to be a handsome character with a gentle voice and warm demeanor, but so far, none of the boys who auditioned fit the bill. Lucas was playing on his phone, bored with how long this was all taking, when he hears Daphn\u00e9 nervously pipe, \u201cLucas? Would you please come up here and sing a few lines?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shoots his head up so fast, he thought he heard his neck crack. \u201cUm. I\u2019m on the production team, I thought? I, uh, really can\u2019t sing Daphn\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Daphn\u00e9 continues undeterred, \u201cWell, just let us be the judge of that, yeah? Just a few lines, please, Lucas. Please?\u201d</p><p>Lucas hesitates as he feels the whole room\u2019s eyes on him, before slowly pocketing his phone and making his way to the front of the room. \u201cJust these couple of lines, please Lucas, whenever you\u2019re ready,\u201d Daphn\u00e9 says, shoving the lyrics to \u2018All I Ask of You\u2019 into Lucas\u2019s hands.</p><p>Manon stands opposite of him, planning to sing Christine\u2019s parts, and gives him an encouraging smile. Lucas takes a deep breath and sings, \u201cNo more talk of darkness, forget these wide-eyed fears. I\u2019m here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Lucas is sitting in the back of the room now sulking, Yann and Arthur teasing him. \u201cWho knew you could sing so well Lucas? Or should we say Raoul?\u201d</p><p>After Lucas sang, Daphne shrieked that he was perfect for the role, and adamantly refused Lucas to work on production, saying it would be a waste of talent. The gang, the stupid friends that they were, Lucas thought furiously, backed Daphn\u00e9 whole-heartedly, saying Lucas had to do the role. So due to peer-pressure, Lucas was now one the male leads.</p><p>Another two hours had passed, the rest of the roles being easily distributed. The group was now faced with the biggest problem of all: the Phantom. The Phantom had to be older, mysterious, and of course, have a voice that could hypnotize. None of the first and second year boys had these qualities, most of them being simply not intimidating enough to play such a dark role.</p><p>Daphn\u00e9 was growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress, turning to Emma to desperately ask, \u201cDo you think Alex would work? Or maybe one of his third year friends?\u201d</p><p>Emma sends a quick text to Alex, while Alexia and Imane try to calm Daphn\u00e9 down. Alex shows up in the foyer less than thirty minutes later, two guys in tow. Yann nudges Lucas to look up from his phone, who promptly almost drops it. One of Alex\u2019s friends Lucas vaguely remembers meeting, probably when he was too high to function at some party. The other guy, however, Lucas had never seen before, and he certainly would\u2019ve remembered this face. He was tall and lanky, with wild chestnut-colored hair and sharp facial features. His eyes though, were what caught Lucas off-guard. Even though the whole room was looking at him, the guy\u2019s eyes flicked directly to Lucas, the gray-blue irises staring minutely before darting away. Daphn\u00e9 rushes to Alex and his friends, speaking lowly and quickly to them.</p><p>Alex then shoves the god-like boy toward the front. Lucas finds himself holding his breath as the unknown boy stands up front, shoulders hunched, Manon shuffling hesitantly to stand beside him at Daphn\u00e9\u2019s request. Daphn\u00e9 gives them the lyrics for Phantom\u2019s main song \u2018Music of the Night\u2019 and directs Emma to turn on the music. Lucas shivers as the first deep notes pour through. Manon gets into character, turning into the curious and unsure Christine, but the greatest change was in the blue-eyed boy. He straightens his shoulders and stands to his full height, looking tall and imposing. Gone was the nervous sort of air he carried when he first walked in the foyer, and instead there was something intense and mysterious in his aura\u2026almost dangerous, Lucas thinks. He then opens his mouth to sing, and Lucas feels as though lightning struck him. The voice isn\u2019t overly deep, but it\u2019s masculine and smooth, holding commanding undertones that makes Lucas squirm in ways he\u2019s unwilling to think about right now.</p><p>The boy\u2019s long arms lead Manon this way and that as he sings, Manon looking hypnotized. Lucas wasn\u2019t entirely sure that Manon was still acting. Daphn\u00e9 eventually directs Emma to stop the music and the boy stops singing immediately, turning back into his hunched self as he moves back to stand next to Alex.</p><p>Daphn\u00e9 claps delightedly, saying, \u201cWell I think we\u2019ve found our Phantom, haven\u2019t we?\u201d She\u2019s met with stunned murmurs of agreement, most people very impressed with the performance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all for tonight everyone! We\u2019ll see the cast and crew next Monday after classes for our first rehearsal, and have a great weekend!\u201d People begin to make their way out of the foyer and Lucas loses sight of the mysterious boy immediately. He waves goodbye to the gang and makes his way to the coloc in a daze. He falls asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow, and if he dreams of gray-blue eyes and a soothing voice, well, only he would know.</p><p>\n \u00a0\u201cOpen up your mind, let your fantasies unwind\u2026In this darkness that you know you cannot fight\u2026 The darkness of the music of the night.\u201d\n</p>",

And we could just be a part of the production crew?\u201d</p><p>Lucas thinks for a second, that is true, and he can\u2019t really afford to fail any classes.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he responds, \u201cbut only the production crew. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m singing.\u201d</p><p>Basile lets out an excited whoop, rushing out of his seat to greet Daphn\u00e9, no doubt to pester her about helping out. Arthur shakes his head exasperatedly before reaching for the audition paper. \u201cI\u2019ll just write all our names down next to production crew, yeah?\u201d Lucas and Yann nod.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d starts Yann, \u201cit should be interesting, right?\u201d Lucas hums in agreement, unaware of just how interesting this was going to get.</p><p>This is boring, Lucas thinks. Auditions had been going fairly smoothly, the group quickly deciding that Manon fit the role of Christine Daa\u00e9, the female lead, the best. Her voice was steady and warm, and she acted out Christine\u2019s sad backstory with astonishing realism. Alexia was to play Meg Giry, Christine\u2019s bubbly and sweet friend, while Imane was casted as her mother, Madame Giry, the stern and respected ballet instructor of the opera.</p><p>The group then casted Chlo\u00e9 as Carlotta, the rather shrill and demanding Prima Donna that competed with Christine. Lucas thought the role suited her, honestly. Lastly, the opera directors Andr\u00e9 and Firmin were filled by Yann and Basile. Daphne forced them two to try out (Basile needed very little convincing), and the group decided they were a hilarious duo. Lucas looked at Yann, betrayed for leaving him to join the cast, to which Yann shrugged and mouthed a \u201csorry.\u201d</p><p>The biggest problem the group was having now was finding Raoul, the wealthy love interest of Christine and the Phantom\u2019s competition. Raoul was supposed to be a handsome character with a gentle voice and warm demeanor, but so far, none of the boys who auditioned fit the bill. Lucas was playing on his phone, bored with how long this was all taking, when he hears Daphn\u00e9 nervously pipe, \u201cLucas? Would you please come up here and sing a few lines?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shoots his head up so fast, he thought he heard his neck crack. \u201cUm. I\u2019m on the production team, I thought? I, uh, really can\u2019t sing Daphn\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Daphn\u00e9 continues undeterred, \u201cWell, just let us be the judge of that, yeah? Just a few lines, please, Lucas. Please?\u201d</p><p>Lucas hesitates as he feels the whole room\u2019s eyes on him, before slowly pocketing his phone and making his way to the front of the room. \u201cJust these couple of lines, please Lucas, whenever you\u2019re ready,\u201d Daphn\u00e9 says, shoving the lyrics to \u2018All I Ask of You\u2019 into Lucas\u2019s hands.</p><p>Manon stands opposite of him, planning to sing Christine\u2019s parts, and gives him an encouraging smile. Lucas takes a deep breath and sings, \u201cNo more talk of darkness, forget these wide-eyed fears. I\u2019m here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Lucas is sitting in the back of the room now sulking, Yann and Arthur teasing him. \u201cWho knew you could sing so well Lucas? Or should we say Raoul?\u201d</p><p>After Lucas sang, Daphne shrieked that he was perfect for the role, and adamantly refused Lucas to work on production, saying it would be a waste of talent. The gang, the stupid friends that they were, Lucas thought furiously, backed Daphn\u00e9 whole-heartedly, saying Lucas had to do the role. So due to peer-pressure, Lucas was now one the male leads.</p><p>Another two hours had passed, the rest of the roles being easily distributed. The group was now faced with the biggest problem of all: the Phantom. The Phantom had to be older, mysterious, and of course, have a voice that could hypnotize. None of the first and second year boys had these qualities, most of them being simply not intimidating enough to play such a dark role.</p><p>Daphn\u00e9 was growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress, turning to Emma to desperately ask, \u201cDo you think Alex would work? Or maybe one of his third year friends?\u201d</p><p>Emma sends a quick text to Alex, while Alexia and Imane try to calm Daphn\u00e9 down. Alex shows up in the foyer less than thirty minutes later, two guys in tow. Yann nudges Lucas to look up from his phone, who promptly almost drops it. One of Alex\u2019s friends Lucas vaguely remembers meeting, probably when he was too high to function at some party. The other guy, however, Lucas had never seen before, and he certainly would\u2019ve remembered this face. He was tall and lanky, with wild chestnut-colored hair and sharp facial features. His eyes though, were what caught Lucas off-guard. Even though the whole room was looking at him, the guy\u2019s eyes flicked directly to Lucas, the gray-blue irises staring minutely before darting away. Daphn\u00e9 rushes to Alex and his friends, speaking lowly and quickly to them.</p><p>Alex then shoves the god-like boy toward the front. Lucas finds himself holding his breath as the unknown boy stands up front, shoulders hunched, Manon shuffling hesitantly to stand beside him at Daphn\u00e9\u2019s request. Daphn\u00e9 gives them the lyrics for Phantom\u2019s main song \u2018Music of the Night\u2019 and directs Emma to turn on the music. Lucas shivers as the first deep notes pour through. Manon gets into character, turning into the curious and unsure Christine, but the greatest change was in the blue-eyed boy. He straightens his shoulders and stands to his full height, looking tall and imposing. Gone was the nervous sort of air he carried when he first walked in the foyer, and instead there was something intense and mysterious in his aura\u2026almost dangerous, Lucas thinks. He then opens his mouth to sing, and Lucas feels as though lightning struck him. The voice isn\u2019t overly deep, but it\u2019s masculine and smooth, holding commanding undertones that makes Lucas squirm in ways he\u2019s unwilling to think about right now.</p><p>The boy\u2019s long arms lead Manon this way and that as he sings, Manon looking hypnotized. Lucas wasn\u2019t entirely sure that Manon was still acting. Daphn\u00e9 eventually directs Emma to stop the music and the boy stops singing immediately, turning back into his hunched self as he moves back to stand next to Alex.</p><p>Daphn\u00e9 claps delightedly, saying, \u201cWell I think we\u2019ve found our Phantom, haven\u2019t we?\u201d She\u2019s met with stunned murmurs of agreement, most people very impressed with the performance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all for tonight everyone! We\u2019ll see the cast and crew next Monday after classes for our first rehearsal, and have a great weekend!\u201d People begin to make their way out of the foyer and Lucas loses sight of the mysterious boy immediately. He waves goodbye to the gang and makes his way to the coloc in a daze. He falls asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow, and if he dreams of gray-blue eyes and a soothing voice, well, only he would know.</p><p>\n \u00a0\u201cOpen up your mind, let your fantasies unwind\u2026In this darkness that you know you cannot fight\u2026 The darkness of the music of the night.\u201d\n</p>",

The gang, the stupid friends that they were, Lucas thought furiously, backed Daphn&eacute; whole-heartedly, saying Lucas had to do the role. So due to peer-pressure, Lucas was now one the male leads.</p><p>Another two hours had passed, the rest of the roles being easily distributed. The group was now faced with the biggest problem of all: the Phantom. The Phantom had to be older, mysterious, and of course, have a voice that could hypnotize. None of the first and second year boys had these qualities, most of them being simply not intimidating enough to play such a dark role.</p><p>Daphn&eacute; was growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress, turning to Emma to desperately ask, &ldquo;Do you think Alex would work? Or maybe one of his third year friends?&rdquo;</p><p>Emma sends a quick text to Alex, while Alexia and Imane try to calm Daphn&eacute; down. Alex shows up in the foyer less than thirty minutes later, two guys in tow. Yann nudges Lucas to look up from his phone, who promptly almost drops it. One of Alex&rsquo;s friends Lucas vaguely remembers meeting, probably when he was too high to function at some party. The other guy, however, Lucas had never seen before, and he certainly would&rsquo;ve remembered this face. He was tall and lanky, with wild chestnut-colored hair and sharp facial features. His eyes though, were what caught Lucas off-guard. Even though the whole room was looking at him, the guy&rsquo;s eyes flicked directly to Lucas, the gray-blue irises staring minutely before darting away. Daphn&eacute; rushes to Alex and his friends, speaking lowly and quickly to them.</p><p>Alex then shoves the god-like boy toward the front. Lucas finds himself holding his breath as the unknown boy stands up front, shoulders hunched, Manon shuffling hesitantly to stand beside him at Daphn&eacute;&rsquo;s request. Daphn&eacute; gives them the lyrics for Phantom&rsquo;s main song &lsquo;Music of the Night&rsquo; and directs Emma to turn on the music. Lucas shivers as the first deep notes pour through. Manon gets into character, turning into the curious and unsure Christine, but the greatest change was in the blue-eyed boy. He straightens his shoulders and stands to his full height, looking tall and imposing. Gone was the nervous sort of air he carried when he first walked in the foyer, and instead there was something intense and mysterious in his aura&hellip;almost dangerous, Lucas thinks. He then opens his mouth to sing, and Lucas feels as though lightning struck him. The voice isn&rsquo;t overly deep, but it&rsquo;s masculine and smooth, holding commanding undertones that makes Lucas squirm in ways he&rsquo;s unwilling to think about right now.</p><p>The boy&rsquo;s long arms lead Manon this way and that as he sings, Manon looking hypnotized. Lucas wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure that Manon was still acting. Daphn&eacute; eventually directs Emma to stop the music and the boy stops singing immediately, turning back into his hunched self as he moves back to stand next to Alex.</p><p>Daphn&eacute; claps delightedly, saying, &ldquo;Well I think we&rsquo;ve found our Phantom, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; She&rsquo;s met with stunned murmurs of agreement, most people very impressed with the performance.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all for tonight everyone! We&rsquo;ll see the cast and crew next Monday after classes for our first rehearsal, and have a great weekend!&rdquo; People begin to make their way out of the foyer and Lucas loses sight of the mysterious boy immediately. He waves goodbye to the gang and makes his way to the coloc in a daze. He falls asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow, and if he dreams of gray-blue eyes and a soothing voice, well, only he would know.</p><p>\n &nbsp;&ldquo;Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind&hellip;In this darkness that you know you cannot fight&hellip; The darkness of the music of the night.&rdquo;\n</p>",

Hopefully they'll take what they learned from S3 and S4 and improve what needs to be improved (like social media and the handling of some stories and characters that didn't work so well in S4 especially)",
