Just because they lived together and he loved her or <i>whatever</i>, didn&rsquo;t mean she could boss him the fuck around.</p><p>He growled, glaring at the beautiful woman in front of him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m. Fine,&rdquo; he hissed, the anger laced through his tone.</p><p>&ldquo;You had a fever last night! The last thing you need to be doing is \ngoing into your office and getting everyone else sick!&rdquo; Admittedly, he \nprobably also had a fever right now, but like hell he was going to tell \nher that. It wasn&rsquo;t like it was hindering him from getting shit done!</p><p>He flared his nostrils, glaring at her. &ldquo;And what about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I live with you,&rdquo; she snorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m immune.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how colds work, Cheeks,&rdquo; he teased, a large grin pulled across his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Even so, you&rsquo;re going to get sicker if you keep going to work like \nthis. What are you going to do when you&rsquo;re feverish and collapse in the \nfield?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like hell that will happen-&rdquo; he started to yell back, already feeling a little dizzy from using so much air.</p><p>Uraraka sighed and stepped closer to him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wobbling around, \nKatsuki,&rdquo; she said and gently placed her hand on his forehead. &ldquo;And \nyou&rsquo;re definitely burning up!&rdquo;</p><p>He hated how gentle her her touch was and his forehead did feel clammy against her cool hand. Fuck. Bakugou Katsuki didn&rsquo;t get <i>sick</i>, he was fucking above that. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare try and tell me you&rsquo;re fine because you&rsquo;re not. I&rsquo;m not letting you out of this apartment!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ochako,&rdquo; he growled, glaring at her still. He could go into work, \nget some paperwork done and be home and in bed early enough to recover \nfrom this shitty cold trying to ruin his life.</p><p>She smirked, folding her arms over her chest. &ldquo;What will you do if \nyou get everyone in your office sick? Won&rsquo;t Best Jeanist be angry if you\n spread your cold to everyone?&rdquo;</p><p>Ugh. She was right, which he hated. He would never hear the end of it\n if he got everyone sick. He was stubborn though and the last thing he \nwanted was to give in; though with the way she was starting to spin a \nbit, he thought his body might not give him much of a choice.</p><p>He stumbled forward and she immediately caught up, placing her palm \nagainst his chest, keeping one finger raised, threatening to activate \nher quirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me your phone,&rdquo; she said, gently touching at the strap on his hero costume.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phone&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Katsuki.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ochako.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Phone</i>. You know if I use my quirk on you it might make you \nfeel even worse.&rdquo; She lowered her finger, looking as though she was \nabout to tap his chest. The idea of floating currently sounded awful, so\n Bakugou huffed, pulling out his phone.</p><p>She yanked it from his hand and scrolled through his contacts, \ntapping at the screen. &ldquo;Hello, this Uravity calling on behalf of Ground \nZero,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s running a high fever and will not be coming into \nwork today.&rdquo; There was a brief pause and if Bakugou didn&rsquo;t feel so damn \ngroggy he might&rsquo;ve been able to try and figure out what Best Jeanist was\n saying. His low tone echoed on the other end of the phone and Bakugou \nhated that the idiot was probably pleased Uraraka convinced him to not \ncome in. &ldquo;Oh! No need to thank me,&rdquo; she giggled, confirming Bakugou&rsquo;s \nthoughts. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll take good care of him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oi!&rdquo; he growled, reaching for his phone, however Uraraka held her \nhand up, pushing his hands away. He could fucking take care of himself, \neven if he was sick. But before he could even grab for the phone, \nUraraka tapped the end call button, handing him back the device.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s grateful you&rsquo;re listening to me for once.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For once!&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;I listen to you all the damn time, Ochako!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; she scoffed. &ldquo;So now will you listen to me about getting back into bed?&rdquo;</p><p>He yanked his large grenade gloves off and slammed them back into the\n closet. &ldquo;Fine, but you better not touch my kitchen!&rdquo; he muttered, \nfeeling woozy just thinking about eating something gross she might make.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on, even I can heat up some soup,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>He really wasn&rsquo;t so sure about that.</p><p>He reached out and grabbed the chair to their dining set and plopped \ndown in the seat, coughing at his full volume. His chest was tight and \nhis head did feel like it was clogged.</p><p>&ldquo;See! You&rsquo;re <i>dying</i>!&rdquo; she said, rushing to the stove. She grabbed a small pot and some canned soup from the cabinet. &ldquo;Maybe I should make tea too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh&hellip;&rdquo; he grunted, letting his head fall to his arms, burying himself against the table.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky today is my day off,&rdquo; she said, humming while she added water into the pot, getting the soup ready.</p><p>Lucky was one word for it.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kinda nice, you know,&rdquo; she smiled, gently stirring the soup in the pot, letting it simmer gently on the stove.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Me fuckin&rsquo; dying!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so you admit it?&rdquo; she hummed, turning around to raise her eyebrow at him.</p><p>He rolled his eyes and glared at her. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go to work, did I?&rdquo;</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at how angry he was. He hated that her \nlaugh made him feel a little bit warmer despite the fever sending chills\n up and down his entire body. &ldquo;I had to <i>force</i> you to not go!&rdquo; she\n said, pulling a bowl from the cabinet. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she hummed, &ldquo;I like \nhaving the chance to take care of my boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>Ew. He hated that. He didn&rsquo;t need to be <i>taken care of</i>. They \ntook care of each other plenty, on equal footing. He wasn&rsquo;t some child \nthat she needed to coddle and treat like a baby. Fuck that.</p><p>&ldquo;Forget the soup,&rdquo; he snarled, pushing the chair out to stand up.</p><p>&ldquo;What? But it&rsquo;s almost done!&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you to fuckin&rsquo;&hellip; take care of me!&rdquo; he snapped, pushing the chair back into the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Katsuki&hellip;&rdquo; she sighed, moving the soup off of the burner. She \nslowly made her way over to him and took his hand. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to \noffend you. I love you and I wanted you to feel better and I was happy \nthat I could maybe try and do something to help you.&rdquo;</p><p>He growled, squeezing her hand back. &ldquo;You know I&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off, coughing once more. The awful feeling burned in his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Hate feeling useless?&rdquo; she said, finishing his sentence.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Fuck&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not useless, Katsuki!&rdquo; she giggled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick! It happens to everyone. Please just eat this soup.&rdquo;</p><p>He took a seat back at the table and rolled his eyes. He hated this. \nFuck, he hated it so much. He hated that she was doing so much shit for \nhim on her day off and that his arms felt like lead and he wanted to \ndrag his goddamn feet everywhere.</p><p>Being sick was the worst&hellip; especially because he rarely fucking got \nsick and when he did, it felt like a ton of bricks were slamming into \nhis chest over and over.</p><p>She placed the bowl and spoon in front of him and took a seat across \nfrom him. He also hated the concern in her gentle, brown eyes. He didn&rsquo;t\n need her looking so worried, then she was certain to get sick herself.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you quit&hellip; worryin&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered, slurping up the soup. He \nwrinkled his nose. How could this girl mess up easy-make soup? It was \nfar too watery.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it not good?&rdquo; she asked, more concern fluttering across her eyes.\n He couldn&rsquo;t keep having her look at him like this so he just needed to \nsuffer even more.</p><p>He slurped it down, and shook his head. &ldquo;S'fine, Cheeks. Stop looking at me like I&rsquo;m dying of the plague.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You kinda are&hellip;&rdquo; she teased, gently poking at his hand with her \nfinger. &ldquo;I seriously think you should consider going to the doctor if \nyou&rsquo;re not better in a day or two,&rdquo; she hummed, her tone taking on a \nslight sing song. &ldquo;But knowing you, you won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; she shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; he grumbled. The last thing he wanted to do what go to \nthe stupid doctor. He pushed the now empty bowl away from him and stood \nback up.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno, I might take a nap or some shit,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Well take some medicine before you go,&rdquo; she said, scurrying over to \nthe small cabinet where they kept a few bottles of aspirin and cold \nmedication. &ldquo;Remember when you thought you wouldn&rsquo;t ever need these?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t really fuckin&rsquo; need them!&rdquo; he snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop being so damn stubborn!&rdquo; she yelled, thrusting the pulls into his hand. &ldquo;Just take them and get some rest!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine! I fuckin&rsquo; get it!&rdquo; He tossed the pills into his mouth and threw back a large glass of water, swallowing it.</p><p>Napping did seem like a much better alternative suddenly. Uraraka was\n going to keep yelling at him if he didn&rsquo;t listen to her. Why didn&rsquo;t he \nhave a quirk to make himself magically better instead of suffering \nthrough this stupid disease?</p><p>He just hated being treated like he was fuckin&rsquo; dying.</p><p>Making his way back to their bedroom, he flopped onto the bed, \npulling the blankets over his body. &ldquo;Now go away. You got what you \nfucking wanted.&rdquo; He turned away from her, huffing out angrily while she \nstood in the doorway.</p><p>She sighed, slowly walking forward to sit down on the side of the \nbed, tucking strands of her hair behind her ear. She reached forward and\n gently stroked through his messy blond locks, her fingers gently \nmassaging his scalp. &ldquo;Katsuki&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You know I do it \nbecause I&rsquo;m worried about you. If you went out in the field like this, \nyou could be seriously injured or over work your body too much&hellip;&rdquo; she \nexplained.</p><p>He groaned, rolling his eyes. The problem was she was right and \nBakugou hated that she was right and he just wanted to do his job and \nnot feel like a goddamn fucking invalid.</p><p>The medicine was already starting to make him drowsy, but he rolled \nover, turning back to face her. &ldquo;I get it Cheeks. I just&hellip; fuckin&rsquo; hate\n being sick.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like feeling useless. But&hellip; \nKatsuki&hellip;&rdquo; She lifted the covers up and slid herself underneath with \nhim. She brushed her soft fingers over his cheek, smiling at him. \n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only human. Sometimes I think you forget that,&rdquo; she teased.</p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t wrong. He didn&rsquo;t view himself as human. He was a goddamn <i>hero</i>,\n and he worked hard to be one. He worked hard to push himself to be the \nbest he could be&hellip; and yeah, maybe this was his body&rsquo;s way of telling \nhim to slow down.</p><p>He gently grabbed her wrist, pulling her hand to his lips, kissing her palm. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be human,&rdquo; he grumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; she giggled, scooting even close to him, rubbing her nose \nagainst his. &ldquo;You are. And if you&rsquo;re sick&hellip; it&rsquo;s okay to ask for help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh. Whatever Cheeks. I guess&hellip; if anyone is gonna be doing this \nshit for me&hellip; I&rsquo;m&hellip; glad it&rsquo;s you&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered, the words more \npainful to say than the headache he was nursing.</p><p>She blushed, and he at the very least thought the words were worth \nsaying, if only to see the cute look on her face. He hated the idea of \nasking for help, but if anyone was going to do it, he would want it to \nbe her. She was his partner, his equal, and no one knew him better than \nshe did.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll help you, even if you hate it a lot,&rdquo; she teased, \ngently pressing her lips to his, kissing him gently. For a moment, he \nreturned the kiss, loving her soft lips on his own, but suddenly, he \nremembered that he was sick and immediately pushed her back.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi! You&rsquo;re gonna get sick, idiot!&rdquo; he growled. The last thing he wanted was her catching this.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you! As your girlfriend, I&rsquo;m immune.&rdquo;</p><p>~~</p><p>Well, that was a big fat lie.</p><p>Only a few days later, Uraraka awoke with a heavy cough and slight fever. Shivering, she pressed against him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi, Ochako&hellip; you&rsquo;re sick.&rdquo;</p><p><i>His</i> cold hadn&rsquo;t completely disappeared either, his nose was still a little stuffed and his cough had lingered.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right&hellip;&rdquo; she mumbled, nuzzling against his neck, her gloved hands pressing close to his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to work today,&rdquo; he stated, doing the same thing she did to him a few days prior.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she said softly, her eyes closing against him. That was far \ntoo easy. Though then again, she did seem utterly exhausted, the cold \nhitting her hard.</p><p>He smirked. &ldquo;What happened to being immune?&rdquo; he teased, gently stroking through her brown locks</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;guess I was wrong,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Now you can take care of me.&rdquo;</p><p>He rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Was this a secret plan of yours to be lazy in bed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What!? No!&rdquo; she said, a coughing fit picking up. &ldquo;Do you really think I would fake sick for that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just teasin&rsquo; Cheeks,&rdquo; he muttered and kissed her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Mean,&rdquo; she sighed, yawning as she sniffled against him, already \ndrifting off back into sleep, the cold making her shiver more. He knew \nshe probably needed to take some of that cold medicine, which meant she \nalso needed to eat.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he whispered, chuckling to himself. &ldquo;At least I make better \nsoup than you.&rdquo; She groaned, weakly hitting her hand against his chest.</p><p>In the end, he supposed they did take perfect care of each other.</p>",

He could fucking take care of himself, \neven if he was sick. But before he could even grab for the phone, \nUraraka tapped the end call button, handing him back the device.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s grateful you\u2019re listening to me for once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor once!\u201d he snorted. \u201cI listen to you all the damn time, Ochako!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cSo now will you listen to me about getting back into bed?\u201d</p><p>He yanked his large grenade gloves off and slammed them back into the\n closet. \u201cFine, but you better not touch my kitchen!\u201d he muttered, \nfeeling woozy just thinking about eating something gross she might make.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, even I can heat up some soup,\u201d she said.</p><p>He really wasn\u2019t so sure about that.</p><p>He reached out and grabbed the chair to their dining set and plopped \ndown in the seat, coughing at his full volume. His chest was tight and \nhis head did feel like it was clogged.</p><p>\u201cSee! You\u2019re <i>dying</i>!\u201d she said, rushing to the stove. She grabbed a small pot and some canned soup from the cabinet. \u201cMaybe I should make tea too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d he grunted, letting his head fall to his arms, burying himself against the table.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky today is my day off,\u201d she said, humming while she added water into the pot, getting the soup ready.</p><p>Lucky was one word for it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kinda nice, you know,\u201d she smiled, gently stirring the soup in the pot, letting it simmer gently on the stove.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Me fuckin\u2019 dying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you admit it?\u201d she hummed, turning around to raise her eyebrow at him.</p><p>He rolled his eyes and glared at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to work, did I?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but laugh at how angry he was. He hated that her \nlaugh made him feel a little bit warmer despite the fever sending chills\n up and down his entire body. \u201cI had to <i>force</i> you to not go!\u201d she\n said, pulling a bowl from the cabinet. \u201cAnyway,\u201d she hummed, \u201cI like \nhaving the chance to take care of my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Ew. He hated that. He didn\u2019t need to be <i>taken care of</i>. They \ntook care of each other plenty, on equal footing. He wasn\u2019t some child \nthat she needed to coddle and treat like a baby. Fuck that.</p><p>\u201cForget the soup,\u201d he snarled, pushing the chair out to stand up.</p><p>\u201cWhat? But it\u2019s almost done!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to fuckin\u2019\u2026 take care of me!\u201d he snapped, pushing the chair back into the table.</p><p>\u201cOh Katsuki\u2026\u201d she sighed, moving the soup off of the burner. She \nslowly made her way over to him and took his hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to \noffend you. I love you and I wanted you to feel better and I was happy \nthat I could maybe try and do something to help you.\u201d</p><p>He growled, squeezing her hand back. \u201cYou know I\u2026\u201d he trailed off, coughing once more. The awful feeling burned in his chest.</p><p>\u201cHate feeling useless?\u201d she said, finishing his sentence.</p><p>\u201c\u2026Fuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not useless, Katsuki!\u201d she giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re sick! It happens to everyone. Please just eat this soup.\u201d</p><p>He took a seat back at the table and rolled his eyes. He hated this. \nFuck, he hated it so much. He hated that she was doing so much shit for \nhim on her day off and that his arms felt like lead and he wanted to \ndrag his goddamn feet everywhere.</p><p>Being sick was the worst\u2026 especially because he rarely fucking got \nsick and when he did, it felt like a ton of bricks were slamming into \nhis chest over and over.</p><p>She placed the bowl and spoon in front of him and took a seat across \nfrom him. He also hated the concern in her gentle, brown eyes. He didn\u2019t\n need her looking so worried, then she was certain to get sick herself.</p><p>\u201cWill you quit\u2026 worryin\u2019\u2026\u201d he muttered, slurping up the soup. He \nwrinkled his nose. How could this girl mess up easy-make soup? It was \nfar too watery.</p><p>\u201cIs it not good?\u201d she asked, more concern fluttering across her eyes.\n He couldn\u2019t keep having her look at him like this so he just needed to \nsuffer even more.</p><p>He slurped it down, and shook his head. \u201cS'fine, Cheeks. Stop looking at me like I\u2019m dying of the plague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kinda are\u2026\u201d she teased, gently poking at his hand with her \nfinger. \u201cI seriously think you should consider going to the doctor if \nyou\u2019re not better in a day or two,\u201d she hummed, her tone taking on a \nslight sing song. \u201cBut knowing you, you won\u2019t do it,\u201d she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he grumbled. The last thing he wanted to do what go to \nthe stupid doctor. He pushed the now empty bowl away from him and stood \nback up.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno, I might take a nap or some shit,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWell take some medicine before you go,\u201d she said, scurrying over to \nthe small cabinet where they kept a few bottles of aspirin and cold \nmedication. \u201cRemember when you thought you wouldn\u2019t ever need these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t really fuckin\u2019 need them!\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cStop being so damn stubborn!\u201d she yelled, thrusting the pulls into his hand. \u201cJust take them and get some rest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine! I fuckin\u2019 get it!\u201d He tossed the pills into his mouth and threw back a large glass of water, swallowing it.</p><p>Napping did seem like a much better alternative suddenly. Uraraka was\n going to keep yelling at him if he didn\u2019t listen to her. Why didn\u2019t he \nhave a quirk to make himself magically better instead of suffering \nthrough this stupid disease?</p><p>He just hated being treated like he was fuckin\u2019 dying.</p><p>Making his way back to their bedroom, he flopped onto the bed, \npulling the blankets over his body. \u201cNow go away. You got what you \nfucking wanted.\u201d He turned away from her, huffing out angrily while she \nstood in the doorway.</p><p>She sighed, slowly walking forward to sit down on the side of the \nbed, tucking strands of her hair behind her ear. She reached forward and\n gently stroked through his messy blond locks, her fingers gently \nmassaging his scalp. \u201cKatsuki\u2026\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou know I do it \nbecause I\u2019m worried about you. If you went out in the field like this, \nyou could be seriously injured or over work your body too much\u2026\u201d she \nexplained.</p><p>He groaned, rolling his eyes. The problem was she was right and \nBakugou hated that she was right and he just wanted to do his job and \nnot feel like a goddamn fucking invalid.</p><p>The medicine was already starting to make him drowsy, but he rolled \nover, turning back to face her. \u201cI get it Cheeks. I just\u2026 fuckin\u2019 hate\n being sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t like feeling useless. But\u2026 \nKatsuki\u2026\u201d She lifted the covers up and slid herself underneath with \nhim. She brushed her soft fingers over his cheek, smiling at him. \n\u201cYou\u2019re only human. Sometimes I think you forget that,\u201d she teased.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wrong. He didn\u2019t view himself as human. He was a goddamn <i>hero</i>,\n and he worked hard to be one. He worked hard to push himself to be the \nbest he could be\u2026 and yeah, maybe this was his body\u2019s way of telling \nhim to slow down.</p><p>He gently grabbed her wrist, pulling her hand to his lips, kissing her palm. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be human,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d she giggled, scooting even close to him, rubbing her nose \nagainst his. \u201cYou are. And if you\u2019re sick\u2026 it\u2019s okay to ask for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. Whatever Cheeks. I guess\u2026 if anyone is gonna be doing this \nshit for me\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 glad it\u2019s you\u2026\u201d he muttered, the words more \npainful to say than the headache he was nursing.</p><p>She blushed, and he at the very least thought the words were worth \nsaying, if only to see the cute look on her face. He hated the idea of \nasking for help, but if anyone was going to do it, he would want it to \nbe her. She was his partner, his equal, and no one knew him better than \nshe did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll help you, even if you hate it a lot,\u201d she teased, \ngently pressing her lips to his, kissing him gently. For a moment, he \nreturned the kiss, loving her soft lips on his own, but suddenly, he \nremembered that he was sick and immediately pushed her back.</p><p>\u201cOi! You\u2019re gonna get sick, idiot!\u201d he growled. The last thing he wanted was her catching this.</p><p>\u201cI told you! As your girlfriend, I\u2019m immune.\u201d</p><p>~~</p><p>Well, that was a big fat lie.</p><p>Only a few days later, Uraraka awoke with a heavy cough and slight fever. Shivering, she pressed against him.</p><p>\u201cOi, Ochako\u2026 you\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><p><i>His</i> cold hadn\u2019t completely disappeared either, his nose was still a little stuffed and his cough had lingered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d she mumbled, nuzzling against his neck, her gloved hands pressing close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to work today,\u201d he stated, doing the same thing she did to him a few days prior.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said softly, her eyes closing against him. That was far \ntoo easy. Though then again, she did seem utterly exhausted, the cold \nhitting her hard.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cWhat happened to being immune?\u201d he teased, gently stroking through her brown locks</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026guess I was wrong,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNow you can take care of me.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cWas this a secret plan of yours to be lazy in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!? No!\u201d she said, a coughing fit picking up. \u201cDo you really think I would fake sick for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust teasin\u2019 Cheeks,\u201d he muttered and kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cMean,\u201d she sighed, yawning as she sniffled against him, already \ndrifting off back into sleep, the cold making her shiver more. He knew \nshe probably needed to take some of that cold medicine, which meant she \nalso needed to eat.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he whispered, chuckling to himself. \u201cAt least I make better \nsoup than you.\u201d She groaned, weakly hitting her hand against his chest.</p><p>In the end, he supposed they did take perfect care of each other.</p>",

He wasn\u2019t in \nthe mood to face the wrath of his slightly overprotective girlfriend \nwhen it came to these sorts of things.</small></p><p><small>\u201cBakugou Katsuki just where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</small></p><p><small>He halted, frozen in place while catching the gaze of a very frustrated Uraraka Ochako. And here he thought he\u2019d been quiet.</small></p>[[MORE]]<p>She was a heavy sleeper, always snoring and drooling a little bit. Disgusting, but so damn her and so damn <i>cute</i>. He was weak to her, and though he always tried to deny it, it was easy to see through his damn transparent lies.</p><p>Somehow, he\u2019d woken her up in an attempt to sneak out of their apartment. Fuckin\u2019 demon woman.</p><p>He looked her up and down, noting how she looked like she just rolled\n out of bed. Her brown hair was disheveled, pieces flying every which \nway from the back of her head. Her tank top was twisted around her \nstomach, the side of her breast peeking through the white fabric.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t feel like ultra shit, he would\u2019ve ravaged her right there against the door.</p><p>\u201cMove Cheeks,\u201d he snorted. \u201cI\u2019m going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re getting back into bed and calling Best Jeanist.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. Just because they lived together and he loved her or <i>whatever</i>, didn\u2019t mean she could boss him the fuck around.</p><p>He growled, glaring at the beautiful woman in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m. Fine,\u201d he hissed, the anger laced through his tone.</p><p>\u201cYou had a fever last night! The last thing you need to be doing is \ngoing into your office and getting everyone else sick!\u201d Admittedly, he \nprobably also had a fever right now, but like hell he was going to tell \nher that. It wasn\u2019t like it was hindering him from getting shit done!</p><p>He flared his nostrils, glaring at her. \u201cAnd what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live with you,\u201d she snorted. \u201cI\u2019m immune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s how colds work, Cheeks,\u201d he teased, a large grin pulled across his face.</p><p>\u201cEven so, you\u2019re going to get sicker if you keep going to work like \nthis. What are you going to do when you\u2019re feverish and collapse in the \nfield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell that will happen-\u201d he started to yell back, already feeling a little dizzy from using so much air.</p><p>Uraraka sighed and stepped closer to him. \u201cYou\u2019re wobbling around, \nKatsuki,\u201d she said and gently placed her hand on his forehead. \u201cAnd \nyou\u2019re definitely burning up!\u201d</p><p>He hated how gentle her her touch was and his forehead did feel clammy against her cool hand. Fuck. Bakugou Katsuki didn\u2019t get <i>sick</i>, he was fucking above that. \u201cI\u2019m-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare try and tell me you\u2019re fine because you\u2019re not. I\u2019m not letting you out of this apartment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOchako,\u201d he growled, glaring at her still. He could go into work, \nget some paperwork done and be home and in bed early enough to recover \nfrom this shitty cold trying to ruin his life.</p><p>She smirked, folding her arms over her chest. \u201cWhat will you do if \nyou get everyone in your office sick? Won\u2019t Best Jeanist be angry if you\n spread your cold to everyone?\u201d</p><p>Ugh. She was right, which he hated. He would never hear the end of it\n if he got everyone sick. He was stubborn though and the last thing he \nwanted was to give in; though with the way she was starting to spin a \nbit, he thought his body might not give him much of a choice.</p><p>He stumbled forward and she immediately caught up, placing her palm \nagainst his chest, keeping one finger raised, threatening to activate \nher quirk.</p><p>\u201cGive me your phone,\u201d she said, gently touching at the strap on his hero costume.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatsuki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOchako.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Phone</i>. You know if I use my quirk on you it might make you \nfeel even worse.\u201d She lowered her finger, looking as though she was \nabout to tap his chest. The idea of floating currently sounded awful, so\n Bakugou huffed, pulling out his phone.</p><p>She yanked it from his hand and scrolled through his contacts, \ntapping at the screen. \u201cHello, this Uravity calling on behalf of Ground \nZero,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s running a high fever and will not be coming into \nwork today.\u201d There was a brief pause and if Bakugou didn\u2019t feel so damn \ngroggy he might\u2019ve been able to try and figure out what Best Jeanist was\n saying. His low tone echoed on the other end of the phone and Bakugou \nhated that the idiot was probably pleased Uraraka convinced him to not \ncome in. \u201cOh! No need to thank me,\u201d she giggled, confirming Bakugou\u2019s \nthoughts. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll take good care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi!\u201d he growled, reaching for his phone, however Uraraka held her \nhand up, pushing his hands away. He could fucking take care of himself, \neven if he was sick. But before he could even grab for the phone, \nUraraka tapped the end call button, handing him back the device.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s grateful you\u2019re listening to me for once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor once!\u201d he snorted. \u201cI listen to you all the damn time, Ochako!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cSo now will you listen to me about getting back into bed?\u201d</p><p>He yanked his large grenade gloves off and slammed them back into the\n closet. \u201cFine, but you better not touch my kitchen!\u201d he muttered, \nfeeling woozy just thinking about eating something gross she might make.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, even I can heat up some soup,\u201d she said.</p><p>He really wasn\u2019t so sure about that.</p><p>He reached out and grabbed the chair to their dining set and plopped \ndown in the seat, coughing at his full volume. His chest was tight and \nhis head did feel like it was clogged.</p><p>\u201cSee! You\u2019re <i>dying</i>!\u201d she said, rushing to the stove. She grabbed a small pot and some canned soup from the cabinet. \u201cMaybe I should make tea too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d he grunted, letting his head fall to his arms, burying himself against the table.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky today is my day off,\u201d she said, humming while she added water into the pot, getting the soup ready.</p><p>Lucky was one word for it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kinda nice, you know,\u201d she smiled, gently stirring the soup in the pot, letting it simmer gently on the stove.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Me fuckin\u2019 dying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you admit it?\u201d she hummed, turning around to raise her eyebrow at him.</p><p>He rolled his eyes and glared at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to work, did I?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but laugh at how angry he was. He hated that her \nlaugh made him feel a little bit warmer despite the fever sending chills\n up and down his entire body. \u201cI had to <i>force</i> you to not go!\u201d she\n said, pulling a bowl from the cabinet. \u201cAnyway,\u201d she hummed, \u201cI like \nhaving the chance to take care of my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Ew. He hated that. He didn\u2019t need to be <i>taken care of</i>. They \ntook care of each other plenty, on equal footing. He wasn\u2019t some child \nthat she needed to coddle and treat like a baby. Fuck that.</p><p>\u201cForget the soup,\u201d he snarled, pushing the chair out to stand up.</p><p>\u201cWhat? But it\u2019s almost done!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to fuckin\u2019\u2026 take care of me!\u201d he snapped, pushing the chair back into the table.</p><p>\u201cOh Katsuki\u2026\u201d she sighed, moving the soup off of the burner. She \nslowly made her way over to him and took his hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to \noffend you. I love you and I wanted you to feel better and I was happy \nthat I could maybe try and do something to help you.\u201d</p><p>He growled, squeezing her hand back. \u201cYou know I\u2026\u201d he trailed off, coughing once more. The awful feeling burned in his chest.</p><p>\u201cHate feeling useless?\u201d she said, finishing his sentence.</p><p>\u201c\u2026Fuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not useless, Katsuki!\u201d she giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re sick! It happens to everyone. Please just eat this soup.\u201d</p><p>He took a seat back at the table and rolled his eyes. He hated this. \nFuck, he hated it so much. He hated that she was doing so much shit for \nhim on her day off and that his arms felt like lead and he wanted to \ndrag his goddamn feet everywhere.</p><p>Being sick was the worst\u2026 especially because he rarely fucking got \nsick and when he did, it felt like a ton of bricks were slamming into \nhis chest over and over.</p><p>She placed the bowl and spoon in front of him and took a seat across \nfrom him. He also hated the concern in her gentle, brown eyes. He didn\u2019t\n need her looking so worried, then she was certain to get sick herself.</p><p>\u201cWill you quit\u2026 worryin\u2019\u2026\u201d he muttered, slurping up the soup. He \nwrinkled his nose. How could this girl mess up easy-make soup? It was \nfar too watery.</p><p>\u201cIs it not good?\u201d she asked, more concern fluttering across her eyes.\n He couldn\u2019t keep having her look at him like this so he just needed to \nsuffer even more.</p><p>He slurped it down, and shook his head. \u201cS'fine, Cheeks. Stop looking at me like I\u2019m dying of the plague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kinda are\u2026\u201d she teased, gently poking at his hand with her \nfinger. \u201cI seriously think you should consider going to the doctor if \nyou\u2019re not better in a day or two,\u201d she hummed, her tone taking on a \nslight sing song. \u201cBut knowing you, you won\u2019t do it,\u201d she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he grumbled. The last thing he wanted to do what go to \nthe stupid doctor. He pushed the now empty bowl away from him and stood \nback up.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno, I might take a nap or some shit,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWell take some medicine before you go,\u201d she said, scurrying over to \nthe small cabinet where they kept a few bottles of aspirin and cold \nmedication. \u201cRemember when you thought you wouldn\u2019t ever need these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t really fuckin\u2019 need them!\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cStop being so damn stubborn!\u201d she yelled, thrusting the pulls into his hand. \u201cJust take them and get some rest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine! I fuckin\u2019 get it!\u201d He tossed the pills into his mouth and threw back a large glass of water, swallowing it.</p><p>Napping did seem like a much better alternative suddenly. Uraraka was\n going to keep yelling at him if he didn\u2019t listen to her. Why didn\u2019t he \nhave a quirk to make himself magically better instead of suffering \nthrough this stupid disease?</p><p>He just hated being treated like he was fuckin\u2019 dying.</p><p>Making his way back to their bedroom, he flopped onto the bed, \npulling the blankets over his body. \u201cNow go away. You got what you \nfucking wanted.\u201d He turned away from her, huffing out angrily while she \nstood in the doorway.</p><p>She sighed, slowly walking forward to sit down on the side of the \nbed, tucking strands of her hair behind her ear. She reached forward and\n gently stroked through his messy blond locks, her fingers gently \nmassaging his scalp. \u201cKatsuki\u2026\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou know I do it \nbecause I\u2019m worried about you. If you went out in the field like this, \nyou could be seriously injured or over work your body too much\u2026\u201d she \nexplained.</p><p>He groaned, rolling his eyes. The problem was she was right and \nBakugou hated that she was right and he just wanted to do his job and \nnot feel like a goddamn fucking invalid.</p><p>The medicine was already starting to make him drowsy, but he rolled \nover, turning back to face her. \u201cI get it Cheeks. I just\u2026 fuckin\u2019 hate\n being sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t like feeling useless. But\u2026 \nKatsuki\u2026\u201d She lifted the covers up and slid herself underneath with \nhim. She brushed her soft fingers over his cheek, smiling at him. \n\u201cYou\u2019re only human. Sometimes I think you forget that,\u201d she teased.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wrong. He didn\u2019t view himself as human. He was a goddamn <i>hero</i>,\n and he worked hard to be one. He worked hard to push himself to be the \nbest he could be\u2026 and yeah, maybe this was his body\u2019s way of telling \nhim to slow down.</p><p>He gently grabbed her wrist, pulling her hand to his lips, kissing her palm. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be human,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d she giggled, scooting even close to him, rubbing her nose \nagainst his. \u201cYou are. And if you\u2019re sick\u2026 it\u2019s okay to ask for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. Whatever Cheeks. I guess\u2026 if anyone is gonna be doing this \nshit for me\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 glad it\u2019s you\u2026\u201d he muttered, the words more \npainful to say than the headache he was nursing.</p><p>She blushed, and he at the very least thought the words were worth \nsaying, if only to see the cute look on her face. He hated the idea of \nasking for help, but if anyone was going to do it, he would want it to \nbe her. She was his partner, his equal, and no one knew him better than \nshe did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll help you, even if you hate it a lot,\u201d she teased, \ngently pressing her lips to his, kissing him gently. For a moment, he \nreturned the kiss, loving her soft lips on his own, but suddenly, he \nremembered that he was sick and immediately pushed her back.</p><p>\u201cOi! You\u2019re gonna get sick, idiot!\u201d he growled. The last thing he wanted was her catching this.</p><p>\u201cI told you! As your girlfriend, I\u2019m immune.\u201d</p><p>~~</p><p>Well, that was a big fat lie.</p><p>Only a few days later, Uraraka awoke with a heavy cough and slight fever. Shivering, she pressed against him.</p><p>\u201cOi, Ochako\u2026 you\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><p><i>His</i> cold hadn\u2019t completely disappeared either, his nose was still a little stuffed and his cough had lingered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d she mumbled, nuzzling against his neck, her gloved hands pressing close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to work today,\u201d he stated, doing the same thing she did to him a few days prior.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said softly, her eyes closing against him. That was far \ntoo easy. Though then again, she did seem utterly exhausted, the cold \nhitting her hard.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cWhat happened to being immune?\u201d he teased, gently stroking through her brown locks</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026guess I was wrong,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNow you can take care of me.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cWas this a secret plan of yours to be lazy in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!? No!\u201d she said, a coughing fit picking up. \u201cDo you really think I would fake sick for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust teasin\u2019 Cheeks,\u201d he muttered and kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cMean,\u201d she sighed, yawning as she sniffled against him, already \ndrifting off back into sleep, the cold making her shiver more. He knew \nshe probably needed to take some of that cold medicine, which meant she \nalso needed to eat.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he whispered, chuckling to himself. \u201cAt least I make better \nsoup than you.\u201d She groaned, weakly hitting her hand against his chest.</p><p>In the end, he supposed they did take perfect care of each other.</p>",

He wasn&rsquo;t in \nthe mood to face the wrath of his slightly overprotective girlfriend \nwhen it came to these sorts of things.</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Bakugou Katsuki just where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>He halted, frozen in place while catching the gaze of a very frustrated Uraraka Ochako. And here he thought he&rsquo;d been quiet.</small></p><p>She was a heavy sleeper, always snoring and drooling a little bit. Disgusting, but so damn her and so damn <i>cute</i>. He was weak to her, and though he always tried to deny it, it was easy to see through his damn transparent lies.</p><p>Somehow, he&rsquo;d woken her up in an attempt to sneak out of their apartment. Fuckin&rsquo; demon woman.</p><p>He looked her up and down, noting how she looked like she just rolled\n out of bed. Her brown hair was disheveled, pieces flying every which \nway from the back of her head. Her tank top was twisted around her \nstomach, the side of her breast peeking through the white fabric.</p><p>If he didn&rsquo;t feel like ultra shit, he would&rsquo;ve ravaged her right there against the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Move Cheeks,&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not. You&rsquo;re getting back into bed and calling Best Jeanist.&rdquo;</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. Just because they lived together and he loved her or <i>whatever</i>, didn&rsquo;t mean she could boss him the fuck around.</p><p>He growled, glaring at the beautiful woman in front of him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m. Fine,&rdquo; he hissed, the anger laced through his tone.</p><p>&ldquo;You had a fever last night! The last thing you need to be doing is \ngoing into your office and getting everyone else sick!&rdquo; Admittedly, he \nprobably also had a fever right now, but like hell he was going to tell \nher that. It wasn&rsquo;t like it was hindering him from getting shit done!</p><p>He flared his nostrils, glaring at her. &ldquo;And what about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I live with you,&rdquo; she snorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m immune.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how colds work, Cheeks,&rdquo; he teased, a large grin pulled across his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Even so, you&rsquo;re going to get sicker if you keep going to work like \nthis. What are you going to do when you&rsquo;re feverish and collapse in the \nfield?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like hell that will happen-&rdquo; he started to yell back, already feeling a little dizzy from using so much air.</p><p>Uraraka sighed and stepped closer to him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wobbling around, \nKatsuki,&rdquo; she said and gently placed her hand on his forehead. &ldquo;And \nyou&rsquo;re definitely burning up!&rdquo;</p><p>He hated how gentle her her touch was and his forehead did feel clammy against her cool hand. Fuck. Bakugou Katsuki didn&rsquo;t get <i>sick</i>, he was fucking above that. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare try and tell me you&rsquo;re fine because you&rsquo;re not. I&rsquo;m not letting you out of this apartment!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ochako,&rdquo; he growled, glaring at her still. He could go into work, \nget some paperwork done and be home and in bed early enough to recover \nfrom this shitty cold trying to ruin his life.</p><p>She smirked, folding her arms over her chest. &ldquo;What will you do if \nyou get everyone in your office sick? Won&rsquo;t Best Jeanist be angry if you\n spread your cold to everyone?&rdquo;</p><p>Ugh. She was right, which he hated. He would never hear the end of it\n if he got everyone sick. He was stubborn though and the last thing he \nwanted was to give in; though with the way she was starting to spin a \nbit, he thought his body might not give him much of a choice.</p><p>He stumbled forward and she immediately caught up, placing her palm \nagainst his chest, keeping one finger raised, threatening to activate \nher quirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me your phone,&rdquo; she said, gently touching at the strap on his hero costume.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phone&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Katsuki.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ochako.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Phone</i>. You know if I use my quirk on you it might make you \nfeel even worse.&rdquo; She lowered her finger, looking as though she was \nabout to tap his chest. The idea of floating currently sounded awful, so\n Bakugou huffed, pulling out his phone.</p><p>She yanked it from his hand and scrolled through his contacts, \ntapping at the screen. &ldquo;Hello, this Uravity calling on behalf of Ground \nZero,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s running a high fever and will not be coming into \nwork today.&rdquo; There was a brief pause and if Bakugou didn&rsquo;t feel so damn \ngroggy he might&rsquo;ve been able to try and figure out what Best Jeanist was\n saying. His low tone echoed on the other end of the phone and Bakugou \nhated that the idiot was probably pleased Uraraka convinced him to not \ncome in. &ldquo;Oh! No need to thank me,&rdquo; she giggled, confirming Bakugou&rsquo;s \nthoughts. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll take good care of him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oi!&rdquo; he growled, reaching for his phone, however Uraraka held her \nhand up, pushing his hands away. He could fucking take care of himself, \neven if he was sick. But before he could even grab for the phone, \nUraraka tapped the end call button, handing him back the device.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s grateful you&rsquo;re listening to me for once.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For once!&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;I listen to you all the damn time, Ochako!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; she scoffed. &ldquo;So now will you listen to me about getting back into bed?&rdquo;</p><p>He yanked his large grenade gloves off and slammed them back into the\n closet. &ldquo;Fine, but you better not touch my kitchen!&rdquo; he muttered, \nfeeling woozy just thinking about eating something gross she might make.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on, even I can heat up some soup,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>He really wasn&rsquo;t so sure about that.</p><p>He reached out and grabbed the chair to their dining set and plopped \ndown in the seat, coughing at his full volume. His chest was tight and \nhis head did feel like it was clogged.</p><p>&ldquo;See! You&rsquo;re <i>dying</i>!&rdquo; she said, rushing to the stove. She grabbed a small pot and some canned soup from the cabinet. &ldquo;Maybe I should make tea too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh&hellip;&rdquo; he grunted, letting his head fall to his arms, burying himself against the table.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky today is my day off,&rdquo; she said, humming while she added water into the pot, getting the soup ready.</p><p>Lucky was one word for it.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kinda nice, you know,&rdquo; she smiled, gently stirring the soup in the pot, letting it simmer gently on the stove.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Me fuckin&rsquo; dying!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so you admit it?&rdquo; she hummed, turning around to raise her eyebrow at him.</p><p>He rolled his eyes and glared at her. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go to work, did I?&rdquo;</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at how angry he was. He hated that her \nlaugh made him feel a little bit warmer despite the fever sending chills\n up and down his entire body. &ldquo;I had to <i>force</i> you to not go!&rdquo; she\n said, pulling a bowl from the cabinet. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she hummed, &ldquo;I like \nhaving the chance to take care of my boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>Ew. He hated that. He didn&rsquo;t need to be <i>taken care of</i>. They \ntook care of each other plenty, on equal footing. He wasn&rsquo;t some child \nthat she needed to coddle and treat like a baby. Fuck that.</p><p>&ldquo;Forget the soup,&rdquo; he snarled, pushing the chair out to stand up.</p><p>&ldquo;What? But it&rsquo;s almost done!&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you to fuckin&rsquo;&hellip; take care of me!&rdquo; he snapped, pushing the chair back into the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Katsuki&hellip;&rdquo; she sighed, moving the soup off of the burner. She \nslowly made her way over to him and took his hand. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to \noffend you. I love you and I wanted you to feel better and I was happy \nthat I could maybe try and do something to help you.&rdquo;</p><p>He growled, squeezing her hand back. &ldquo;You know I&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off, coughing once more. The awful feeling burned in his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Hate feeling useless?&rdquo; she said, finishing his sentence.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Fuck&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not useless, Katsuki!&rdquo; she giggled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick! It happens to everyone. Please just eat this soup.&rdquo;</p><p>He took a seat back at the table and rolled his eyes. He hated this. \nFuck, he hated it so much.

He \nwrinkled his nose. How could this girl mess up easy-make soup? It was \nfar too watery.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it not good?&rdquo; she asked, more concern fluttering across her eyes.\n He couldn&rsquo;t keep having her look at him like this so he just needed to \nsuffer even more.</p><p>He slurped it down, and shook his head. &ldquo;S'fine, Cheeks.
