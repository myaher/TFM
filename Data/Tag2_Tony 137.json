Not to  take him away again.</p><p>&ldquo;Did this man take you away from your family?&rdquo; When Peter nods, Tony&rsquo;s horrified at the thought of what this child might have endured under this man&rsquo;s<br />care. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s has stopped thrashing around at this point and is just limp in Tony&rsquo;s arms, crying silently. Tony gets a better look at him, seeing the scars, cuts<br />and bruises around his face. He&rsquo;s positive he&rsquo;d find the same injuries all over his body too. </p><p>Tony doesn&rsquo;t know why, but he has a sudden need to protect this kid. More so th an any of the other kids he saved. He loosens up his arms, but brings Peter<br />in closer to his chest, trying to convey as much comfort and warmth he can through the suit. It&rsquo;d be better for him to hold the kid in his actual arms,<br />but he&rsquo;s still not sure if this is all one elaborate trap. </p><p>&ldquo;Shh, I&rsquo;m gonna take you, but somewhere safe and then we can find your parents, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>At this point Peter has just accepted the fact that this man now had control over him and whether or not what he was saying was true, it didn&rsquo;t matter<br />because Peter was never going to be strong enough to escape from Iron Man&rsquo;s hold, similar to how he couldn&rsquo;t escape from the man who kidnapped him. </p><p>Tony carries Peter in his arms as he flies out of there. He has no idea what he kind of situation he just put himself in with this kid, but the sudden need<br />to take care of this boy washes away any doubts he has. </p>",
