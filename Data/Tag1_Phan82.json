Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star.

Phil was still in a state of disbelief about this entire situation if he was being honest. If you would have asked Phil of one year ago where he would be right now, he\u2019d say still working at the BBC with PJ, Gemma, and Louise. He wouldn\u2019t have even considered Spike yet. But here he is, laying in bed with Daniel Howell, his head resting on Phil\u2019s chest as he scrolls through Instagram.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSome photos from my party last night are surfacing.\u201d Dan adds on, making the point by clicking on the photo posted by some celebrity that Phil\u2019s actually never heard of before. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember taking this photo.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil snorts as he looks at the photo of Dan stood with the female. Dan\u2019s got a cocktail in hand and Phil\u2019s not quite sure what one it was. Probably the third or forth.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan double taps the photo to like it and then continues scrolling. \u201cHer name is Anna.\u201d Dan said, stopping on a photo of Ariana Grande and double clicking that as well. \u201cShe worked on our set.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan scrolled further and further and somehow ended up US Weekly Magazine\u2019s Instagram, looking at the photo of him from the night before at the party. \u201cI wanna know who gives these magazines my photos.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI don\u2019t do it. I know Marianne doesn\u2019t. I just wanna know who does.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil swallowed, his stomach knotting a bit and his heart beginning to race. \u201cDo you think anyone took photos of us\u2026you know, kissing?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan turned his head and sat away from Phil a little bit. Phil looked at him and bit his lip. \u201cNo.\u201d Dan said, his voice stiff. Almost like he was trying to tell himself the answer too. \u201cNo one would.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Phil asked. He really just needed to know if there was any chance of their kiss being leaked.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cPhil, people were probably doing lines in my bathroom. If they are going to leak a photo of us kissing, that would be pretty damn hypocritical.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan quickly tossed his phone to side and then turned on the bed so he was resting on his elbow, looking up at Phil. \u201cI just don\u2019t want the tabloids to see us before we\u2019re ready.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cMe too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThere was a silence between them and Phil watched Dan\u2019s face for any signs of any uncomfortable feelings he might be going through in his head. \u201cMy last relationship got outed before we were ready.\u201d Dan said, his voice staggering a bit. \u201cKellin and I were just enjoying our time together. I really liked him and he really liked me and then we stupidly walked out of a cafe holding hands and the media ate up on it. Our relationship was never the same.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know why he asked that. He shouldn\u2019t have really. It wasn\u2019t his business. He doesn\u2019t have to know anything about Dan\u2019s past.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell,\u201d Dan begins. \u201cKellin didn\u2019t like it because he wanted to remain as private as possible. He didn\u2019t want to do anything besides just when we were alone and it bit a pretty big strain on us. Especially when we were working on a movie together at the time. So being on set and seeing him and knowing we were dating but I couldn\u2019t touch him was extremely difficult.\u201d Dan looked down at his shirt and Phil watched as he began to pick a stray string on his hem as he spoke. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know this but Kellin cheated on me anyway the last few months we were together with the woman he\u2019s with now. When he told me about her, I was under the impression that he was using her as a vice to get the tabloids and paparazzi off our back. But I was stupid and young and I thought it would be fine. But it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure you saw our fight over social media.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil actually hadn\u2019t seen much of the fight but he\u2019d heard about it. He\u2019d heard that it wasn\u2019t pretty and it did in fact stir a lot of news. For a short time, he even remembers hearing people around work talking about who\u2019s side they were one.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut that was the past.\u201d Dan says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re my future and even though it\u2019s only been a short time, you\u2019re already making me the happiest I\u2019ve been in a long time.\u201d Dan paused and Phil continued to listen, his heart bursting with fondness and love at the seams. \u201cI knew when I first saw you that you were going to be important to me. That\u2019s why I invited you out of literally anyone else to show me around London. I know that was a shitshow but I was in such a bad mental place when you met me. And talking with you has helped me stay grounded. You\u2019ve helped me realize that I can handle everything that\u2019s happening around me. And I\u2019ll never be able to thank you enough.\u201d Dan let out a laugh. \u201cGod, this sounds so cheesy but you actually saved my life, Phil.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at Dan and watched as the first tear made its why down Dan\u2019s cheek. He was smiling at Phil but at the same time, more and more tears fell down his cheek. Phil reached over and wiped it away with his thumb, feeling the wetness spread under his touch. \u201cI think I knew you were going to be important to me the first time I saw you.\u201d Phil said. \u201cI knew you were the one for me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI knew you were the one for me too.\u201d Dan said, as he leaned away from Phil and reached up, wiping the rest of his tears away with his hands. \u201cGod, we sound so disgusting right now.\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil let out a laugh and reached up, wiping away his own unshed tears. \u201cI think we have a right to be in this case.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMaybe so.\u201d Dan said, sitting up in bed. \u201cBut I think Marianne is coming over tonight for some drinks and to catch me up about what my week looks like so I need to shower after our activities today.\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil felt his cheeks flush. He\u2019d forgotten about that morning, the way Dan\u2019s mouth felt on him. He felt his heart flutter and he willed himself to calm down. There were going to be many more times to do that before he leaves.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI probably should too.\u201d Phil said. \u201cI think I still smell like airplane and I don\u2019t know how you haven\u2019t gotten sick because of it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWant to shower with me?\u201d Dan asks, standing up and beginning to walk to the edge of the bed. \u201cCome on! It\u2019ll be nice.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil didn\u2019t need to be asked twice as he shot up from the bed and followed Dan to the bathroom where Dan shut the door behind them.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil waited as Dan bent over and drew the water in the tub before turning around and smiling at Phil. \u201cI\u2019ll get in first and then when you\u2019re ready, you can get in second.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan pushed down his sweatpants into a pile on the floor and then lifted his shirt off. Phil caught a quick glance of his naked body before he turned and stepped behind the glass door into the shower and shut it.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly stripped himself and then did the same, following suit with his clothing. He stepped forward and slowly pushed open the door before stepping in and immediately being hugged by Dan\u2019s arms.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan maneuvered them so they were both under the warm mist as he shut the door and then rest his forehead against Phil\u2019s. Phil smiled at him through the waterfall before he leaned forward and captured their lips again.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil would never grow tired of the way their lips moulded perfectly together and the way that Dan knew exactly how to kiss and how just amazing every kiss was. Phil reached one hand up and rested it on Dan\u2019s jaw as his other hand moved around Dan\u2019s back and cupped Dan\u2019s ass.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a surprised yelp before moving forward and resting their bodies closer together. Phil felt Dan\u2019s hardness resting against his hip and he mewled at the thought of doing anything with Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut his thoughts were short lived as Dan let out a little snort and then pulled back and turned around quickly in Phil\u2019s arms as he bent down in front of Phil and picked up his shampoo from the edge of the tub. \u201cActually have to shower and try to get clean.\u201d Phil felt himself let out a huff of frustration as Dan stood back up and turned as he handed the bottle to Phil. \u201cWash my hair and I was yours?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDeal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil squirted a generous amount of the scent of the orange gel in his hand brought him back to his flat, where he found Dan\u2019s shampoo sitting in his shower and it instantly reminded him of Dan and his heart ached.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe reached up and rans his hands through Dan\u2019s curls, lathering it up as Dan shut his eyes, putting his entire trust until Phil. Which, in hindsight was a bad thing as Phil watched in slow motion as a white drop of the shampoo cascaded from Dan\u2019s curl and landed right on Dan\u2019s eyelash. He went to move it away when Dan opened his eyes and immediately yelped out. \u201cFucking hell!\u201d He yelled, ducking his head under the rinse as washing everything away as it swirled down the drain.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil found himself wincing and feeling immediately bad for not trying to stop Dan from getting shampoo in his eye. \u201cDid you get it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan turned around from under the mist and opened his eyes as he looked at Phil and Phil cringed harder as he saw Dan\u2019s completely red and bloodshot right eye. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt too bad.\u201d Dan says. \u201cOn the brightside, the redness will go away and it also didn\u2019t hurt as bad as getting jizz in my eye.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his mouth drop open. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten cum in your eye before.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a laugh and reached up, bringing his hands up so his fingers pet down the soft bit of hair of Phil had on his chest. \u201cThat is a long story that I am not getting into but just know that cum in the eye stings really fucking bad.\u201d Phil snorted and Dan continued to laugh. Dan reached for the shampoo and began squirting some in his hand. \u201cMy turn for revenge.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPlease don\u2019t get anything in my eyes. They\u2019re delicate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo promises.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan didn\u2019t actually get anything in his eyes and he was incredibly grateful for that even if he did still feel bad about getting some in Dan\u2019s. They each took turns washing their own bodies and then just as they were getting done, Dan suddenly reached out and grabbed for Phil again, just resting their bodies together.\u00a0</p><p>\tThere was nothing sexual about it. It was just raw intimacy as Dan rested his chin on Phil\u2019s shoulder and let out a contented sigh. \u201cI never want you to leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI have to.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan says, his voice a bit sad. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I want you to leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave either.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough.\u201d Dan says, pulling away and resting his hands on Phil\u2019s arm as they stood still under the mist that was now growing cool. \u201cBut please don\u2019t give up on me, or this. I know for a while you\u2019re going to face speculation on Twitter and Instagram but\u2026please don\u2019t give up on me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil leaned forward and connected their lips once more into a kiss before pulling back and looking at Dan. Dan gave him a sad smile before he ducked around and turned the water off.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan got out first and grabbed a towel from his closet before he tossed one to Phil who wrapped it around himself.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey got dressed quickly, which was a good thing considering that not long after they were both dressed and Phil had his hair all done and Dan was just beginning to blow dry his, the doorbell rang and Dan rushed down to let Marianne in.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was awkward for a bit, Phil had to admit as they all sat poolside next around a small table next to Dan\u2019s pool. Dan had fixed them both a few drinks before they all sat down and Marianne immediately got into Dan\u2019s plans for the next week and a half.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil didn\u2019t listen as they spoke, mostly because he didn\u2019t understand hardly anything they were saying and he also just felt like it wasn\u2019t his place to know all of Dan\u2019s plans. However, he was ripped from his thoughts as he heard his name being said by Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201c\u2026Phil can come with me to this one though, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was pointing to something on Marianne\u2019s iPad screen as it sat on the table and Phil felt his pulse pick up. What was Dan referring to? Where was Phil going?\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, he could go to technically any of these besides the closed film promotion shoot with US Weekly but this would be the easiest for him to go unnoticed if that is what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what are you guys talking about?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan and Marianne both looked up at him. \u201cI have a party I have to attend in West Hollywood tomorrow night so did you want to come?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat type of a party is it?\u201d Phil asked, looking at Dan with some hope in his eyes that it wouldn\u2019t be a rager with orgies, drugs, and whatever else happens.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s another black tie party but this one is just more of a meet and greet for us in the film but I have the option to bring a plus one so you can be my plus one. It\u2019ll be super lowkey. No photography is even allowed inside so we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a small breath of relief and then smirked. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan reached across the table and placed his hands over Phil\u2019s. It was all the reassurance that Phil needed that even though he was beginning the early stages of being a part of Dan\u2019s lifestyle, Dan was still going to help him every step of the way. Much like how he is helping Dan feel better about being in this lifestyle.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt some weird way, they were like each other saviors and that made Phil feel really good. Less than three months ago, he\u2019d never have imagined that he would be here right now, in Los Angeles, agreeing to go to a party with his boyfriend who just so happens to be the Daniel Howell. It all feels surreal. And maybe it is a bit surreal. But Phil knows one thing is for sure, he\u2019s not afraid of his future anymore. He\u2019s not afraid of where he\u2019ll be in the next year.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s not going to be alone, wallowing in his own misery over being 32 and single. He\u2019s going to be with Dan, who he knows already he wants to be with for a long time. And that\u2019s all that matters to him right now is knowing Dan is still standing by his side and he\u2019s standing by Dan\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd if he\u2019s being honest, it feels pretty fucking great.\u00a0</p>",

Phil was still in a state of disbelief about this entire situation if he was being honest. If you would have asked Phil of one year ago where he would be right now, he\u2019d say still working at the BBC with PJ, Gemma, and Louise. He wouldn\u2019t have even considered Spike yet. But here he is, laying in bed with Daniel Howell, his head resting on Phil\u2019s chest as he scrolls through Instagram.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSome photos from my party last night are surfacing.\u201d Dan adds on, making the point by clicking on the photo posted by some celebrity that Phil\u2019s actually never heard of before. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember taking this photo.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil snorts as he looks at the photo of Dan stood with the female. Dan\u2019s got a cocktail in hand and Phil\u2019s not quite sure what one it was. Probably the third or forth.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan double taps the photo to like it and then continues scrolling. \u201cHer name is Anna.\u201d Dan said, stopping on a photo of Ariana Grande and double clicking that as well. \u201cShe worked on our set.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan scrolled further and further and somehow ended up US Weekly Magazine\u2019s Instagram, looking at the photo of him from the night before at the party. \u201cI wanna know who gives these magazines my photos.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI don\u2019t do it. I know Marianne doesn\u2019t. I just wanna know who does.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil swallowed, his stomach knotting a bit and his heart beginning to race. \u201cDo you think anyone took photos of us\u2026you know, kissing?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan turned his head and sat away from Phil a little bit. Phil looked at him and bit his lip. \u201cNo.\u201d Dan said, his voice stiff. Almost like he was trying to tell himself the answer too. \u201cNo one would.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Phil asked. He really just needed to know if there was any chance of their kiss being leaked.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cPhil, people were probably doing lines in my bathroom. If they are going to leak a photo of us kissing, that would be pretty damn hypocritical.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan quickly tossed his phone to side and then turned on the bed so he was resting on his elbow, looking up at Phil. \u201cI just don\u2019t want the tabloids to see us before we\u2019re ready.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cMe too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThere was a silence between them and Phil watched Dan\u2019s face for any signs of any uncomfortable feelings he might be going through in his head. \u201cMy last relationship got outed before we were ready.\u201d Dan said, his voice staggering a bit. \u201cKellin and I were just enjoying our time together. I really liked him and he really liked me and then we stupidly walked out of a cafe holding hands and the media ate up on it. Our relationship was never the same.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know why he asked that. He shouldn\u2019t have really. It wasn\u2019t his business. He doesn\u2019t have to know anything about Dan\u2019s past.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell,\u201d Dan begins. \u201cKellin didn\u2019t like it because he wanted to remain as private as possible. He didn\u2019t want to do anything besides just when we were alone and it bit a pretty big strain on us. Especially when we were working on a movie together at the time. So being on set and seeing him and knowing we were dating but I couldn\u2019t touch him was extremely difficult.\u201d Dan looked down at his shirt and Phil watched as he began to pick a stray string on his hem as he spoke. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know this but Kellin cheated on me anyway the last few months we were together with the woman he\u2019s with now. When he told me about her, I was under the impression that he was using her as a vice to get the tabloids and paparazzi off our back. But I was stupid and young and I thought it would be fine. But it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure you saw our fight over social media.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil actually hadn\u2019t seen much of the fight but he\u2019d heard about it. He\u2019d heard that it wasn\u2019t pretty and it did in fact stir a lot of news. For a short time, he even remembers hearing people around work talking about who\u2019s side they were one.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut that was the past.\u201d Dan says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re my future and even though it\u2019s only been a short time, you\u2019re already making me the happiest I\u2019ve been in a long time.\u201d Dan paused and Phil continued to listen, his heart bursting with fondness and love at the seams. \u201cI knew when I first saw you that you were going to be important to me. That\u2019s why I invited you out of literally anyone else to show me around London. I know that was a shitshow but I was in such a bad mental place when you met me. And talking with you has helped me stay grounded. You\u2019ve helped me realize that I can handle everything that\u2019s happening around me. And I\u2019ll never be able to thank you enough.\u201d Dan let out a laugh. \u201cGod, this sounds so cheesy but you actually saved my life, Phil.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at Dan and watched as the first tear made its why down Dan\u2019s cheek. He was smiling at Phil but at the same time, more and more tears fell down his cheek. Phil reached over and wiped it away with his thumb, feeling the wetness spread under his touch. \u201cI think I knew you were going to be important to me the first time I saw you.\u201d Phil said. \u201cI knew you were the one for me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI knew you were the one for me too.\u201d Dan said, as he leaned away from Phil and reached up, wiping the rest of his tears away with his hands. \u201cGod, we sound so disgusting right now.\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil let out a laugh and reached up, wiping away his own unshed tears. \u201cI think we have a right to be in this case.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMaybe so.\u201d Dan said, sitting up in bed. \u201cBut I think Marianne is coming over tonight for some drinks and to catch me up about what my week looks like so I need to shower after our activities today.\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil felt his cheeks flush. He\u2019d forgotten about that morning, the way Dan\u2019s mouth felt on him. He felt his heart flutter and he willed himself to calm down. There were going to be many more times to do that before he leaves.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI probably should too.\u201d Phil said. \u201cI think I still smell like airplane and I don\u2019t know how you haven\u2019t gotten sick because of it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWant to shower with me?\u201d Dan asks, standing up and beginning to walk to the edge of the bed. \u201cCome on! It\u2019ll be nice.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil didn\u2019t need to be asked twice as he shot up from the bed and followed Dan to the bathroom where Dan shut the door behind them.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil waited as Dan bent over and drew the water in the tub before turning around and smiling at Phil. \u201cI\u2019ll get in first and then when you\u2019re ready, you can get in second.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan pushed down his sweatpants into a pile on the floor and then lifted his shirt off. Phil caught a quick glance of his naked body before he turned and stepped behind the glass door into the shower and shut it.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly stripped himself and then did the same, following suit with his clothing. He stepped forward and slowly pushed open the door before stepping in and immediately being hugged by Dan\u2019s arms.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan maneuvered them so they were both under the warm mist as he shut the door and then rest his forehead against Phil\u2019s. Phil smiled at him through the waterfall before he leaned forward and captured their lips again.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil would never grow tired of the way their lips moulded perfectly together and the way that Dan knew exactly how to kiss and how just amazing every kiss was. Phil reached one hand up and rested it on Dan\u2019s jaw as his other hand moved around Dan\u2019s back and cupped Dan\u2019s ass.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a surprised yelp before moving forward and resting their bodies closer together. Phil felt Dan\u2019s hardness resting against his hip and he mewled at the thought of doing anything with Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut his thoughts were short lived as Dan let out a little snort and then pulled back and turned around quickly in Phil\u2019s arms as he bent down in front of Phil and picked up his shampoo from the edge of the tub. \u201cActually have to shower and try to get clean.\u201d Phil felt himself let out a huff of frustration as Dan stood back up and turned as he handed the bottle to Phil. \u201cWash my hair and I was yours?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDeal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil squirted a generous amount of the scent of the orange gel in his hand brought him back to his flat, where he found Dan\u2019s shampoo sitting in his shower and it instantly reminded him of Dan and his heart ached.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe reached up and rans his hands through Dan\u2019s curls, lathering it up as Dan shut his eyes, putting his entire trust until Phil. Which, in hindsight was a bad thing as Phil watched in slow motion as a white drop of the shampoo cascaded from Dan\u2019s curl and landed right on Dan\u2019s eyelash. He went to move it away when Dan opened his eyes and immediately yelped out. \u201cFucking hell!\u201d He yelled, ducking his head under the rinse as washing everything away as it swirled down the drain.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil found himself wincing and feeling immediately bad for not trying to stop Dan from getting shampoo in his eye. \u201cDid you get it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan turned around from under the mist and opened his eyes as he looked at Phil and Phil cringed harder as he saw Dan\u2019s completely red and bloodshot right eye. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt too bad.\u201d Dan says. \u201cOn the brightside, the redness will go away and it also didn\u2019t hurt as bad as getting jizz in my eye.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his mouth drop open. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten cum in your eye before.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a laugh and reached up, bringing his hands up so his fingers pet down the soft bit of hair of Phil had on his chest. \u201cThat is a long story that I am not getting into but just know that cum in the eye stings really fucking bad.\u201d Phil snorted and Dan continued to laugh. Dan reached for the shampoo and began squirting some in his hand. \u201cMy turn for revenge.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPlease don\u2019t get anything in my eyes. They\u2019re delicate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo promises.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan didn\u2019t actually get anything in his eyes and he was incredibly grateful for that even if he did still feel bad about getting some in Dan\u2019s. They each took turns washing their own bodies and then just as they were getting done, Dan suddenly reached out and grabbed for Phil again, just resting their bodies together.\u00a0</p><p>\tThere was nothing sexual about it. It was just raw intimacy as Dan rested his chin on Phil\u2019s shoulder and let out a contented sigh. \u201cI never want you to leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI have to.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan says, his voice a bit sad. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I want you to leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave either.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough.\u201d Dan says, pulling away and resting his hands on Phil\u2019s arm as they stood still under the mist that was now growing cool. \u201cBut please don\u2019t give up on me, or this. I know for a while you\u2019re going to face speculation on Twitter and Instagram but\u2026please don\u2019t give up on me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil leaned forward and connected their lips once more into a kiss before pulling back and looking at Dan. Dan gave him a sad smile before he ducked around and turned the water off.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan got out first and grabbed a towel from his closet before he tossed one to Phil who wrapped it around himself.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey got dressed quickly, which was a good thing considering that not long after they were both dressed and Phil had his hair all done and Dan was just beginning to blow dry his, the doorbell rang and Dan rushed down to let Marianne in.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was awkward for a bit, Phil had to admit as they all sat poolside next around a small table next to Dan\u2019s pool. Dan had fixed them both a few drinks before they all sat down and Marianne immediately got into Dan\u2019s plans for the next week and a half.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil didn\u2019t listen as they spoke, mostly because he didn\u2019t understand hardly anything they were saying and he also just felt like it wasn\u2019t his place to know all of Dan\u2019s plans. However, he was ripped from his thoughts as he heard his name being said by Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201c\u2026Phil can come with me to this one though, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was pointing to something on Marianne\u2019s iPad screen as it sat on the table and Phil felt his pulse pick up. What was Dan referring to? Where was Phil going?\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, he could go to technically any of these besides the closed film promotion shoot with US Weekly but this would be the easiest for him to go unnoticed if that is what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what are you guys talking about?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan and Marianne both looked up at him. \u201cI have a party I have to attend in West Hollywood tomorrow night so did you want to come?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat type of a party is it?\u201d Phil asked, looking at Dan with some hope in his eyes that it wouldn\u2019t be a rager with orgies, drugs, and whatever else happens.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s another black tie party but this one is just more of a meet and greet for us in the film but I have the option to bring a plus one so you can be my plus one. It\u2019ll be super lowkey. No photography is even allowed inside so we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a small breath of relief and then smirked. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan reached across the table and placed his hands over Phil\u2019s. It was all the reassurance that Phil needed that even though he was beginning the early stages of being a part of Dan\u2019s lifestyle, Dan was still going to help him every step of the way.

Phil was still in a state of disbelief about this entire situation if he was being honest. If you would have asked Phil of one year ago where he would be right now, he\u2019d say still working at the BBC with PJ, Gemma, and Louise. He wouldn\u2019t have even considered Spike yet. But here he is, laying in bed with Daniel Howell, his head resting on Phil\u2019s chest as he scrolls through Instagram.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSome photos from my party last night are surfacing.\u201d Dan adds on, making the point by clicking on the photo posted by some celebrity that Phil\u2019s actually never heard of before. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember taking this photo.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil snorts as he looks at the photo of Dan stood with the female. Dan\u2019s got a cocktail in hand and Phil\u2019s not quite sure what one it was. Probably the third or forth.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan double taps the photo to like it and then continues scrolling. \u201cHer name is Anna.\u201d Dan said, stopping on a photo of Ariana Grande and double clicking that as well. \u201cShe worked on our set.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan scrolled further and further and somehow ended up US Weekly Magazine\u2019s Instagram, looking at the photo of him from the night before at the party. \u201cI wanna know who gives these magazines my photos.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI don\u2019t do it. I know Marianne doesn\u2019t. I just wanna know who does.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil swallowed, his stomach knotting a bit and his heart beginning to race. \u201cDo you think anyone took photos of us\u2026you know, kissing?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan turned his head and sat away from Phil a little bit. Phil looked at him and bit his lip. \u201cNo.\u201d Dan said, his voice stiff. Almost like he was trying to tell himself the answer too. \u201cNo one would.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Phil asked. He really just needed to know if there was any chance of their kiss being leaked.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cPhil, people were probably doing lines in my bathroom. If they are going to leak a photo of us kissing, that would be pretty damn hypocritical.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan quickly tossed his phone to side and then turned on the bed so he was resting on his elbow, looking up at Phil. \u201cI just don\u2019t want the tabloids to see us before we\u2019re ready.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cMe too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThere was a silence between them and Phil watched Dan\u2019s face for any signs of any uncomfortable feelings he might be going through in his head. \u201cMy last relationship got outed before we were ready.\u201d Dan said, his voice staggering a bit. \u201cKellin and I were just enjoying our time together. I really liked him and he really liked me and then we stupidly walked out of a cafe holding hands and the media ate up on it. Our relationship was never the same.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know why he asked that. He shouldn\u2019t have really. It wasn\u2019t his business. He doesn\u2019t have to know anything about Dan\u2019s past.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell,\u201d Dan begins. \u201cKellin didn\u2019t like it because he wanted to remain as private as possible. He didn\u2019t want to do anything besides just when we were alone and it bit a pretty big strain on us. Especially when we were working on a movie together at the time. So being on set and seeing him and knowing we were dating but I couldn\u2019t touch him was extremely difficult.\u201d Dan looked down at his shirt and Phil watched as he began to pick a stray string on his hem as he spoke. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know this but Kellin cheated on me anyway the last few months we were together with the woman he\u2019s with now. When he told me about her, I was under the impression that he was using her as a vice to get the tabloids and paparazzi off our back. But I was stupid and young and I thought it would be fine. But it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure you saw our fight over social media.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil actually hadn\u2019t seen much of the fight but he\u2019d heard about it. He\u2019d heard that it wasn\u2019t pretty and it did in fact stir a lot of news. For a short time, he even remembers hearing people around work talking about who\u2019s side they were one.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut that was the past.\u201d Dan says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re my future and even though it\u2019s only been a short time, you\u2019re already making me the happiest I\u2019ve been in a long time.\u201d Dan paused and Phil continued to listen, his heart bursting with fondness and love at the seams. \u201cI knew when I first saw you that you were going to be important to me. That\u2019s why I invited you out of literally anyone else to show me around London. I know that was a shitshow but I was in such a bad mental place when you met me. And talking with you has helped me stay grounded. You\u2019ve helped me realize that I can handle everything that\u2019s happening around me. And I\u2019ll never be able to thank you enough.\u201d Dan let out a laugh. \u201cGod, this sounds so cheesy but you actually saved my life, Phil.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at Dan and watched as the first tear made its why down Dan\u2019s cheek. He was smiling at Phil but at the same time, more and more tears fell down his cheek. Phil reached over and wiped it away with his thumb, feeling the wetness spread under his touch. \u201cI think I knew you were going to be important to me the first time I saw you.\u201d Phil said. \u201cI knew you were the one for me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI knew you were the one for me too.\u201d Dan said, as he leaned away from Phil and reached up, wiping the rest of his tears away with his hands. \u201cGod, we sound so disgusting right now.\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil let out a laugh and reached up, wiping away his own unshed tears. \u201cI think we have a right to be in this case.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMaybe so.\u201d Dan said, sitting up in bed. \u201cBut I think Marianne is coming over tonight for some drinks and to catch me up about what my week looks like so I need to shower after our activities today.\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil felt his cheeks flush. He\u2019d forgotten about that morning, the way Dan\u2019s mouth felt on him. He felt his heart flutter and he willed himself to calm down. There were going to be many more times to do that before he leaves.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI probably should too.\u201d Phil said. \u201cI think I still smell like airplane and I don\u2019t know how you haven\u2019t gotten sick because of it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWant to shower with me?\u201d Dan asks, standing up and beginning to walk to the edge of the bed. \u201cCome on! It\u2019ll be nice.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil didn\u2019t need to be asked twice as he shot up from the bed and followed Dan to the bathroom where Dan shut the door behind them.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil waited as Dan bent over and drew the water in the tub before turning around and smiling at Phil. \u201cI\u2019ll get in first and then when you\u2019re ready, you can get in second.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan pushed down his sweatpants into a pile on the floor and then lifted his shirt off. Phil caught a quick glance of his naked body before he turned and stepped behind the glass door into the shower and shut it.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly stripped himself and then did the same, following suit with his clothing. He stepped forward and slowly pushed open the door before stepping in and immediately being hugged by Dan\u2019s arms.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan maneuvered them so they were both under the warm mist as he shut the door and then rest his forehead against Phil\u2019s. Phil smiled at him through the waterfall before he leaned forward and captured their lips again.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil would never grow tired of the way their lips moulded perfectly together and the way that Dan knew exactly how to kiss and how just amazing every kiss was. Phil reached one hand up and rested it on Dan\u2019s jaw as his other hand moved around Dan\u2019s back and cupped Dan\u2019s ass.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a surprised yelp before moving forward and resting their bodies closer together. Phil felt Dan\u2019s hardness resting against his hip and he mewled at the thought of doing anything with Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut his thoughts were short lived as Dan let out a little snort and then pulled back and turned around quickly in Phil\u2019s arms as he bent down in front of Phil and picked up his shampoo from the edge of the tub. \u201cActually have to shower and try to get clean.\u201d Phil felt himself let out a huff of frustration as Dan stood back up and turned as he handed the bottle to Phil. \u201cWash my hair and I was yours?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDeal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil squirted a generous amount of the scent of the orange gel in his hand brought him back to his flat, where he found Dan\u2019s shampoo sitting in his shower and it instantly reminded him of Dan and his heart ached.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe reached up and rans his hands through Dan\u2019s curls, lathering it up as Dan shut his eyes, putting his entire trust until Phil. Which, in hindsight was a bad thing as Phil watched in slow motion as a white drop of the shampoo cascaded from Dan\u2019s curl and landed right on Dan\u2019s eyelash. He went to move it away when Dan opened his eyes and immediately yelped out. \u201cFucking hell!\u201d He yelled, ducking his head under the rinse as washing everything away as it swirled down the drain.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil found himself wincing and feeling immediately bad for not trying to stop Dan from getting shampoo in his eye. \u201cDid you get it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan turned around from under the mist and opened his eyes as he looked at Phil and Phil cringed harder as he saw Dan\u2019s completely red and bloodshot right eye. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt too bad.\u201d Dan says. \u201cOn the brightside, the redness will go away and it also didn\u2019t hurt as bad as getting jizz in my eye.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his mouth drop open. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten cum in your eye before.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a laugh and reached up, bringing his hands up so his fingers pet down the soft bit of hair of Phil had on his chest. \u201cThat is a long story that I am not getting into but just know that cum in the eye stings really fucking bad.\u201d Phil snorted and Dan continued to laugh. Dan reached for the shampoo and began squirting some in his hand. \u201cMy turn for revenge.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPlease don\u2019t get anything in my eyes. They\u2019re delicate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo promises.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan didn\u2019t actually get anything in his eyes and he was incredibly grateful for that even if he did still feel bad about getting some in Dan\u2019s. They each took turns washing their own bodies and then just as they were getting done, Dan suddenly reached out and grabbed for Phil again, just resting their bodies together.\u00a0</p><p>\tThere was nothing sexual about it. It was just raw intimacy as Dan rested his chin on Phil\u2019s shoulder and let out a contented sigh. \u201cI never want you to leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI have to.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan says, his voice a bit sad. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I want you to leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave either.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough.\u201d Dan says, pulling away and resting his hands on Phil\u2019s arm as they stood still under the mist that was now growing cool. \u201cBut please don\u2019t give up on me, or this. I know for a while you\u2019re going to face speculation on Twitter and Instagram but\u2026please don\u2019t give up on me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil leaned forward and connected their lips once more into a kiss before pulling back and looking at Dan. Dan gave him a sad smile before he ducked around and turned the water off.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan got out first and grabbed a towel from his closet before he tossed one to Phil who wrapped it around himself.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey got dressed quickly, which was a good thing considering that not long after they were both dressed and Phil had his hair all done and Dan was just beginning to blow dry his, the doorbell rang and Dan rushed down to let Marianne in.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was awkward for a bit, Phil had to admit as they all sat poolside next around a small table next to Dan\u2019s pool. Dan had fixed them both a few drinks before they all sat down and Marianne immediately got into Dan\u2019s plans for the next week and a half.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil didn\u2019t listen as they spoke, mostly because he didn\u2019t understand hardly anything they were saying and he also just felt like it wasn\u2019t his place to know all of Dan\u2019s plans. However, he was ripped from his thoughts as he heard his name being said by Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201c\u2026Phil can come with me to this one though, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was pointing to something on Marianne\u2019s iPad screen as it sat on the table and Phil felt his pulse pick up. What was Dan referring to? Where was Phil going?\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, he could go to technically any of these besides the closed film promotion shoot with US Weekly but this would be the easiest for him to go unnoticed if that is what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what are you guys talking about?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan and Marianne both looked up at him. \u201cI have a party I have to attend in West Hollywood tomorrow night so did you want to come?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat type of a party is it?\u201d Phil asked, looking at Dan with some hope in his eyes that it wouldn\u2019t be a rager with orgies, drugs, and whatever else happens.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s another black tie party but this one is just more of a meet and greet for us in the film but I have the option to bring a plus one so you can be my plus one. It\u2019ll be super lowkey. No photography is even allowed inside so we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a small breath of relief and then smirked. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan reached across the table and placed his hands over Phil\u2019s. It was all the reassurance that Phil needed that even though he was beginning the early stages of being a part of Dan\u2019s lifestyle, Dan was still going to help him every step of the way. Much like how he is helping Dan feel better about being in this lifestyle.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt some weird way, they were like each other saviors and that made Phil feel really good. Less than three months ago, he\u2019d never have imagined that he would be here right now, in Los Angeles, agreeing to go to a party with his boyfriend who just so happens to be the Daniel Howell. It all feels surreal. And maybe it is a bit surreal. But Phil knows one thing is for sure, he\u2019s not afraid of his future anymore. He\u2019s not afraid of where he\u2019ll be in the next year.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s not going to be alone, wallowing in his own misery over being 32 and single. He\u2019s going to be with Dan, who he knows already he wants to be with for a long time. And that\u2019s all that matters to him right now is knowing Dan is still standing by his side and he\u2019s standing by Dan\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd if he\u2019s being honest, it feels pretty fucking great.\u00a0</p>",

I know Marianne doesn&rsquo;t. I just wanna know who does.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil swallowed, his stomach knotting a bit and his heart beginning to race. &ldquo;Do you think anyone took photos of us&hellip;you know, kissing?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan turned his head and sat away from Phil a little bit. Phil looked at him and bit his lip. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Dan said, his voice stiff. Almost like he was trying to tell himself the answer too. &ldquo;No one would.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Phil asked. He really just needed to know if there was any chance of their kiss being leaked.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nodded. &ldquo;Phil, people were probably doing lines in my bathroom. If they are going to leak a photo of us kissing, that would be pretty damn hypocritical.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan quickly tossed his phone to side and then turned on the bed so he was resting on his elbow, looking up at Phil. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want the tabloids to see us before we&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nodded. &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tThere was a silence between them and Phil watched Dan&rsquo;s face for any signs of any uncomfortable feelings he might be going through in his head. &ldquo;My last relationship got outed before we were ready.&rdquo; Dan said, his voice staggering a bit. &ldquo;Kellin and I were just enjoying our time together. I really liked him and he really liked me and then we stupidly walked out of a cafe holding hands and the media ate up on it. Our relationship was never the same.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil doesn&rsquo;t know why he asked that. He shouldn&rsquo;t have really. It wasn&rsquo;t his business. He doesn&rsquo;t have to know anything about Dan&rsquo;s past.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dan begins. &ldquo;Kellin didn&rsquo;t like it because he wanted to remain as private as possible. He didn&rsquo;t want to do anything besides just when we were alone and it bit a pretty big strain on us. Especially when we were working on a movie together at the time. So being on set and seeing him and knowing we were dating but I couldn&rsquo;t touch him was extremely difficult.&rdquo; Dan looked down at his shirt and Phil watched as he began to pick a stray string on his hem as he spoke. &ldquo;A lot of people don&rsquo;t know this but Kellin cheated on me anyway the last few months we were together with the woman he&rsquo;s with now. When he told me about her, I was under the impression that he was using her as a vice to get the tabloids and paparazzi off our back. But I was stupid and young and I thought it would be fine. But it wasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m sure you saw our fight over social media.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil actually hadn&rsquo;t seen much of the fight but he&rsquo;d heard about it. He&rsquo;d heard that it wasn&rsquo;t pretty and it did in fact stir a lot of news. For a short time, he even remembers hearing people around work talking about who&rsquo;s side they were one.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;But that was the past.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re my future and even though it&rsquo;s only been a short time, you&rsquo;re already making me the happiest I&rsquo;ve been in a long time.&rdquo; Dan paused and Phil continued to listen, his heart bursting with fondness and love at the seams. &ldquo;I knew when I first saw you that you were going to be important to me. That&rsquo;s why I invited you out of literally anyone else to show me around London. I know that was a shitshow but I was in such a bad mental place when you met me. And talking with you has helped me stay grounded. You&rsquo;ve helped me realize that I can handle everything that&rsquo;s happening around me. And I&rsquo;ll never be able to thank you enough.&rdquo; Dan let out a laugh. &ldquo;God, this sounds so cheesy but you actually saved my life, Phil.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looked at Dan and watched as the first tear made its why down Dan&rsquo;s cheek. He was smiling at Phil but at the same time, more and more tears fell down his cheek. Phil reached over and wiped it away with his thumb, feeling the wetness spread under his touch. &ldquo;I think I knew you were going to be important to me the first time I saw you.&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I knew you were the one for me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I knew you were the one for me too.&rdquo; Dan said, as he leaned away from Phil and reached up, wiping the rest of his tears away with his hands. &ldquo;God, we sound so disgusting right now.&rdquo;&nbsp;\t</p><p>\tPhil let out a laugh and reached up, wiping away his own unshed tears. &ldquo;I think we have a right to be in this case.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Maybe so.&rdquo; Dan said, sitting up in bed. &ldquo;But I think Marianne is coming over tonight for some drinks and to catch me up about what my week looks like so I need to shower after our activities today.&rdquo;&nbsp;\t</p><p>\tPhil felt his cheeks flush. He&rsquo;d forgotten about that morning, the way Dan&rsquo;s mouth felt on him. He felt his heart flutter and he willed himself to calm down. There were going to be many more times to do that before he leaves.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I probably should too.&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I think I still smell like airplane and I don&rsquo;t know how you haven&rsquo;t gotten sick because of it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Want to shower with me?&rdquo; Dan asks, standing up and beginning to walk to the edge of the bed. &ldquo;Come on! It&rsquo;ll be nice.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil didn&rsquo;t need to be asked twice as he shot up from the bed and followed Dan to the bathroom where Dan shut the door behind them.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil waited as Dan bent over and drew the water in the tub before turning around and smiling at Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get in first and then when you&rsquo;re ready, you can get in second.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan pushed down his sweatpants into a pile on the floor and then lifted his shirt off. Phil caught a quick glance of his naked body before he turned and stepped behind the glass door into the shower and shut it.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil quickly stripped himself and then did the same, following suit with his clothing. He stepped forward and slowly pushed open the door before stepping in and immediately being hugged by Dan&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan maneuvered them so they were both under the warm mist as he shut the door and then rest his forehead against Phil&rsquo;s. Phil smiled at him through the waterfall before he leaned forward and captured their lips again.&nbsp;\t</p><p>\tPhil would never grow tired of the way their lips moulded perfectly together and the way that Dan knew exactly how to kiss and how just amazing every kiss was. Phil reached one hand up and rested it on Dan&rsquo;s jaw as his other hand moved around Dan&rsquo;s back and cupped Dan&rsquo;s ass.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan let out a surprised yelp before moving forward and resting their bodies closer together. Phil felt Dan&rsquo;s hardness resting against his hip and he mewled at the thought of doing anything with Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut his thoughts were short lived as Dan let out a little snort and then pulled back and turned around quickly in Phil&rsquo;s arms as he bent down in front of Phil and picked up his shampoo from the edge of the tub. &ldquo;Actually have to shower and try to get clean.&rdquo; Phil felt himself let out a huff of frustration as Dan stood back up and turned as he handed the bottle to Phil. &ldquo;Wash my hair and I was yours?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil squirted a generous amount of the scent of the orange gel in his hand brought him back to his flat, where he found Dan&rsquo;s shampoo sitting in his shower and it instantly reminded him of Dan and his heart ached.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe reached up and rans his hands through Dan&rsquo;s curls, lathering it up as Dan shut his eyes, putting his entire trust until Phil. Which, in hindsight was a bad thing as Phil watched in slow motion as a white drop of the shampoo cascaded from Dan&rsquo;s curl and landed right on Dan&rsquo;s eyelash. He went to move it away when Dan opened his eyes and immediately yelped out. &ldquo;Fucking hell!&rdquo; He yelled, ducking his head under the rinse as washing everything away as it swirled down the drain.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil found himself wincing and feeling immediately bad for not trying to stop Dan from getting shampoo in his eye. &ldquo;Did you get it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan turned around from under the mist and opened his eyes as he looked at Phil and Phil cringed harder as he saw Dan&rsquo;s completely red and bloodshot right eye. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t hurt too bad.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;On the brightside, the redness will go away and it also didn&rsquo;t hurt as bad as getting jizz in my eye.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil felt his mouth drop open. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotten cum in your eye before.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan let out a laugh and reached up, bringing his hands up so his fingers pet down the soft bit of hair of Phil had on his chest. &ldquo;That is a long story that I am not getting into but just know that cum in the eye stings really fucking bad.&rdquo; Phil snorted and Dan continued to laugh. Dan reached for the shampoo and began squirting some in his hand. &ldquo;My turn for revenge.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t get anything in my eyes. They&rsquo;re delicate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No promises.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan didn&rsquo;t actually get anything in his eyes and he was incredibly grateful for that even if he did still feel bad about getting some in Dan&rsquo;s. They each took turns washing their own bodies and then just as they were getting done, Dan suddenly reached out and grabbed for Phil again, just resting their bodies together.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThere was nothing sexual about it. It was just raw intimacy as Dan rested his chin on Phil&rsquo;s shoulder and let out a contented sigh. &ldquo;I never want you to leave.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I have to.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Dan says, his voice a bit sad. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I want you to leave.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to leave either.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be tough.&rdquo; Dan says, pulling away and resting his hands on Phil&rsquo;s arm as they stood still under the mist that was now growing cool. &ldquo;But please don&rsquo;t give up on me, or this. I know for a while you&rsquo;re going to face speculation on Twitter and Instagram but&hellip;please don&rsquo;t give up on me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil leaned forward and connected their lips once more into a kiss before pulling back and looking at Dan. Dan gave him a sad smile before he ducked around and turned the water off.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan got out first and grabbed a towel from his closet before he tossed one to Phil who wrapped it around himself.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThey got dressed quickly, which was a good thing considering that not long after they were both dressed and Phil had his hair all done and Dan was just beginning to blow dry his, the doorbell rang and Dan rushed down to let Marianne in.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt was awkward for a bit, Phil had to admit as they all sat poolside next around a small table next to Dan&rsquo;s pool. Dan had fixed them both a few drinks before they all sat down and Marianne immediately got into Dan&rsquo;s plans for the next week and a half.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil didn&rsquo;t listen as they spoke, mostly because he didn&rsquo;t understand hardly anything they were saying and he also just felt like it wasn&rsquo;t his place to know all of Dan&rsquo;s plans. However, he was ripped from his thoughts as he heard his name being said by Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;&hellip;Phil can come with me to this one though, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe was pointing to something on Marianne&rsquo;s iPad screen as it sat on the table and Phil felt his pulse pick up. What was Dan referring to? Where was Phil going?&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well, he could go to technically any of these besides the closed film promotion shoot with US Weekly but this would be the easiest for him to go unnoticed if that is what you&rsquo;re thinking.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what are you guys talking about?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan and Marianne both looked up at him. &ldquo;I have a party I have to attend in West Hollywood tomorrow night so did you want to come?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What type of a party is it?&rdquo; Phil asked, looking at Dan with some hope in his eyes that it wouldn&rsquo;t be a rager with orgies, drugs, and whatever else happens.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s another black tie party but this one is just more of a meet and greet for us in the film but I have the option to bring a plus one so you can be my plus one. It&rsquo;ll be super lowkey. No photography is even allowed inside so we&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil let out a small breath of relief and then smirked. &ldquo;If you say so.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan reached across the table and placed his hands over Phil&rsquo;s. It was all the reassurance that Phil needed that even though he was beginning the early stages of being a part of Dan&rsquo;s lifestyle, Dan was still going to help him every step of the way. Much like how he is helping Dan feel better about being in this lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt some weird way, they were like each other saviors and that made Phil feel really good. Less than three months ago, he&rsquo;d never have imagined that he would be here right now, in Los Angeles, agreeing to go to a party with his boyfriend who just so happens to be the Daniel Howell. It all feels surreal. And maybe it is a bit surreal. But Phil knows one thing is for sure, he&rsquo;s not afraid of his future anymore. He&rsquo;s not afraid of where he&rsquo;ll be in the next year.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s not going to be alone, wallowing in his own misery over being 32 and single. He&rsquo;s going to be with Dan, who he knows already he wants to be with for a long time. And that&rsquo;s all that matters to him right now is knowing Dan is still standing by his side and he&rsquo;s standing by Dan&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAnd if he&rsquo;s being honest, it feels pretty fucking great.&nbsp;</p>",
