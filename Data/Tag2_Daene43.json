I am disappointed by some aspects of the show myself, but I am not disappointed nor surprised nor angry about the Daenerys Mad Queen twist. I am sad, because I think after all she\u2019s been through, she would deserve better. On the other hand, I have always seen that coming since I have paid attention to those small details, to the foreshadowing&hellip; and I actually like the Mad Queen twist, because it is typically Game of Thrones. It is shocking to turn someone you have been rooting for for so long and you love into a villain. That is exactly what Game of Thrones does to people. I wish she didn\u2019t go mad&hellip; for all those people\u2019s sake&hellip; for her own sake. But I have seen it coming and as a Game of Thrones fan, I even like it actually, even though it is brutal and it left me emotionally numb and heartbroken.\u00a0</p><p>But here is my point. I do feel like the last season is rushed. I think that what they did in those 5 episodes so far should have much longer approach. I would say&hellip; one season for the Night King storyline and other season for the actual King\u2019s Landing storyline&hellip; it would save us a lot of disappointment I guess. And maybe if those signs of Dany\u2019s madness were a bit more subtle and not so obvious, it would also make more sense for Tyrion and Jon to follow her even at this point. Since they needed to rush things, they did hurt the show BUT&hellip; I kind of hate when people say that it was out of character for Dany to burn those innocent people and that\u00a0\u201cforeshadowing does not mean a good character development\u201d but lets face it.\u00a0</p><p>In what case is madness actually in someone\u2019s character? Let\u2019s imagine it. You have just lost half of your army, two of your best friends, your two children, man you considered a friend and advisor tried to betray and murder you. You feel alone and lost and unloved. And then, you see the Red Keep that was built by your ancesters, it is laughing in your face, reminding you of all the misery you had to come through to finally get there and you are starting to realize it was all for nothing. And then suddenly&hellip; it is just too much to handle. It is too much to bare, all those horrible things you have been through, all the trauma, all those losses. And you lose it. You lose your mind, because it is just TOO much to handle. Your brain has had enough. Game over.\u00a0</p><p>It totally makes sense. Because madness does not make sense. It is the opposite of sense. You can be completely normal and the next day&hellip; you decide to murder someone. Madness is not something that sends a letter to everyone saying \u201c<i>Hello, I am going to invade someone\u2019s mind so beware</i>!\u201d It is not really someone you can fight, especially not when you are alone or you at least feel like you are alone. <b>Madness is NOT a choice</b>. Any mental illness is not a choice. She did not chose to go mad, she lost her mind as same as her father did. If madness runs in your family, it is even worse. Targaryens were fucking each other for generations, the degeneration is a real problem too, by the way. The fact she never did anything like this before does not have to do anything with it. Going mad is something you cannot really say no to, if it is already invading your mind. <b>This is why the foreshadowing is enough for me</b>.\u00a0</p><p>I have many issues with this last season&hellip; but this particular aspect is not one of them. And I know that a lot of people will not agree with me, but it is how I see it. Probably also because I personally struggle with mental illness and I feel like if you are on edge once, it is really hard not to fall into it or go back. I totally hate that she killed so many people, I am not justifying what she did by this post in any way&hellip; This is simply my interpretation and my feelings and things that I believe to be true, so if you feel like you need to tell me I am a total bitch, feel free to do so, but I don\u2019t really care.\u00a0</p>",
