I\u2019d like to know your opinion about my musings.</p><p>So, I think it\u2019s obvious that the show - at least in its final episodes - had double standards when it came to Daenerys in order to paint her in a bad light.

In all of these plots, people are trying to resolve their disagreements in vain: sometimes war is inevitable.</p><p>What makes me uncomfortable is that, as far as I\u2019m aware, Daenerys is the only character whose choice of war (or, more precisely, Fire and Blood) is possibly being framed negatively. I say \u201cpossibly\u201d because we don\u2019t have TWOW in our hands to be sure, but you can see that\u2019s a possibility considering how a significant part of the fandom has come to the conclusion that she just can\u2019t be a peacetime queen, she has shown her \u201ctrue colors\u201d. This opinion never sat well with me because, as I said, lots of characters are heading towards this direction, and Daenerys herself only arrived at that place after having made many efforts to make amends, but they weren\u2019t meant to last because some wars need to be fought on. It is a specific situation that will likely bring out her more violent impulses, yet it doesn\u2019t define her character as a whole. I\u2019ve read arguments about how the peace was worth it in Meereen and how Daenerys is now going backwards, but I simply disagree with them and, considering the pattern in the narrative and the anti-slavery ideas in Fevre Dream, I lean towards GRRM disagreeing as well (I\u2019d really like to know if his main inspiration for Daenerys\u2019 storyline was the American Civil War or the Iraq war, because knowing that would really clarify what he is trying to convey with her storyline). In any case, again, why is she the only character whose decision to fight the just (and inevitable) war is being framed as a step too far, a turn to the darkness?</p><p><b>a)</b> In this case, I think it\u2019s worth considering the Doylist viewpoint. ASOIAF was supposed to be a trilogy of books about Westeros first and foremost. Daenerys was supposed to live among the Dothraki, birth her dragons, get an army and get to Westeros in the beginning of the third book. As we know, GRRM is a \u201cgardener\u201d, so, as he had more ideas for the characters in Westeros, he had to create more stories for Daenerys as well, and one of them was her ruling in Meereen. This brings me back to your essay about her: being the fire of the song of ice and fire, why isn\u2019t her anti-slavery war in Essos given as much importance as the War for the Dawn? Why should it be a mid-point for the character to realize that her endgame is Westeros? If Jon\u2019s struggles against the Others represent the battle against the supernatural form of slavery and the ice part of the story, why shouldn\u2019t Daenerys\u2019 narrative be the battle against the human form of slavery and the fire part of the story? I\u2019d argue both are just wars, though the WftD is an easier, more black-and-white, standard fantasy conflict, while the war in Slaver\u2019s Bay has more nuance (one may argue that the characters revolving Daenerys are not fleshed out enough or dumbed down military speaking or one may point out the racist aspects of Daenerys\u2019 story, but the socioeconomic situation is indeed complex) and is more controversial, which only reinforces the need to continue developing this story and, most importantly, Daenerys\u2019 political career (which I\u2019ll get to later).</p><p>These questions show that GRRM also has his architect side. Daenerys\u2019 endgame is Westeros because he\u2019s already said his story is about Westeros. Therefore, he needs to transition her to a mindset that\u2019ll propel her to finally leave, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s considered (or cared enough about) certain negative implications that I laid out above (and it\u2019s not exhaustive, other writers have talked a lot more about it).</p><p><b>b)</b> We also need to consider how the show factors into those speculations and how we look at the story, because, like it or not, GRRM still told the ending to D&amp;D, even if in a very simplified manner. Before season eight aired, I was fine with the idea that all of the six main characters were going through the darkest phases of their journeys, but that Daenerys\u2019 in particular would cause more collateral damage as a natural consequence of the power she wields. After season eight, however, I started to reflect if GRRM may have double standards against Daenerys as well. In any case, the show has made it very likely that her fire and blood phase will culminate with her burning of King\u2019s Landing. On the one hand, this could be dramatically interesting, but on the other hand, it could amplify those very double standards against her. I\u2019ll explain:</p><p><i>b1) </i>As of ADWD, Daenerys hasn\u2019t yet been exposed to the atrocities her father has committed (in part because she refuses to do so). What better (if deeply tragic) way to do so than have her directly confronting the legacy he\u2019s left behind - namely, the wildfire caches all over the city? It would shatter her sense of purpose in life and lead her to question herself and her sanity. It would lead her to be critical of the Targaryen legacy and how she wants to engage with it and how she uses it to define herself. It would make her feel more lonely and isolated than ever, especially since one of her core wishes is to belong somewhere, to have a place to call home\u2026 And no one would embrace her if they think she did it on purpose. I can see this being dramatically really interesting.</p><p><i>b2</i>) But I have my reservations about this: 1) If this happens, Daenerys will be in need for redemption and this doesn\u2019t feel right to me (similar to how I feel about Arya). 1.1) She is not and has never been morally flawed as characters like Jaime or Theon or even Tyrion and Sandor. As of ADWD, she\u2019s only committed two morally ambiguous acts (ie crucifying the 163 masters and torturing the wineseller\u2019s daughters). She\u2019s always had her heart in the right place and, if this tragedy happened, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily turn her darker, she\u2019d be a victim of circumstance (and I say so because I don\u2019t see how her actions are any different than the other leaders fighting in the Wot5K, again the double standards\u2026). I dislike how this would frame her outcome in such a moralistic way, especially considering how her character and arc have been paralleled with Jon\u2019s and I\u2019ve yet to see any theories of his character taking a dark turn. 1.2) She\u2019s one of the characters who better embody the books\u2019 idea that you have to do the right thing even if you don\u2019t get anything in return. And yet, not only her war in Essos will be given less narrative importance compared to the WftD (because it will be treated as a middle stage to her fire and blood phase), but when she arrives in the protagonist-centered Westeros, she will be committing war crimes (even if accidentally in the case of the burning of KL)? I\u2019m not a fan of this scenario because it strengthens the idea that she can\u2019t be a peacetime queen because her choice in her final ADWD chapter was fire and blood (which as I\u2019ve said ignores all the time she spent trying to make peace). 2) Also, I\u2019ve noticed a tendency of fandom also demonizing the Targaryen dynasty as a whole, the dragons and the Iron Throne (which to them serves the same thematic purpose as the Ring of LoTR) and I don\u2019t buy their interpretation either because we\u2019ve already seen previous kings who did right by Westeros sitting on the Iron Throne and using their dragons. Having Daenerys fail so spectacularly to restore her family\u2019s dynasty and destroy its most important symbol (the Iron Throne) does not say much about the dynasty\u2019s nature or even the corrupting nature of power as they\u2019d like to believe, it mainly creates sexist implications (that I\u2019ll discuss below). Of course, this depends on how it\u2019s framed: if the dynasty\u2019s end is meant to be a tragedy because of Aerys II\u2019s actions, then I\u2019d buy it; if the dynasty\u2019s end is meant to be a better course of action for Westeros, then it does not work. I wonder why the Targaryens are so vilified when every other house is also working under the parameters of feudalism. Feudalism as a whole should be criticized. Why are the North or Dorne in any better conditions under the governments of House Stark and House Martell? And if GRRM wanted to make an statement about how it\u2019s bad for one individual to accumulate so much power under a centralized government, he really failed, because the Targaryen dynasty is made of successes as much as failures. 3) I\u2019d still expect Daenerys to choose a diplomatic course of action before ultimately deciding to use her dragons on Team Aegon. Heck, it\u2019s still mind-blowing to me to know how the Yunkish masters have burned a lot more things in ADWD than Daenerys and then envision a scenario where she decides to go fire and blood and then accidentally burns everything. GRRM will have to be careful with how he executes this plot if this happens, precisely because it doesn\u2019t gel that well with her previous characterization.</p><p><i>b3</i>) If Daenerys burning KL comes to pass (and the show made it seem very likely that it will), then Daenerys is most likely another queen who failed, which is another tired plot point as well. Anyone who\u2019s read F&amp;B knows that Aerea and Rhaella Targaryen, Rhaena Targaryen, Rhaenys Targaryen, Rhaenyra Targaryen and Daena Targaryen were all considered as queens but were ultimately passed over for their male relatives. It\u2019s a shame that GRRM had so many opportunities to let women rule and chose not to, so why can\u2019t Daenerys be the ultimate change for the dynasty? Related to that point, why can\u2019t she succeed in re-establishing her dynasty when Aegon the Conqueror could? You can\u2019t escape the gender aspect of her potential failure, and having Sansa end as QITN doesn\u2019t fix that, it only makes one question the double standard that plagues House Targaryen and not the others. Finally, in hindsight of the historical (and GRRM\u2019s) pattern of setting female rulers aside and of everything that might happen to Daenerys in the books, having Aegon take the throne and get the love from the smallfolk Daenerys craves for only adds salt to the wounds.</p><p><i>b4</i>) Of course, all I\u2019m supposing that happened in the show and will also happen in the books is that Daenerys will burn King\u2019s Landing. Will she be made a villain and implied mad as well after a lot of stupid foreshadowing in which male characters only told us what the writers wanted the viewers to see, rather than the writers actually showing signs of madness? Will she willingly burn a city full of innocents? Will she be robbed of her perspective by waving away all her actions as \u201cTargaryen madness\u201d (another way of the fandom demonizing the Targaryens, which the text doesn\u2019t really support if you look closely)? Will GRRM not pay attention to how those actions could undermine the book series\u2019 main themes (not that the fucking show has conveyed any themes in a consistent manner, but that\u2019s a bigger issue)? Will he have it happen at a point that\u2019ll leave Daenerys with no chance to redeem herself and end her story with her legacy forever tarnished in-universe, general awareness and pop culture? Will he make Jon Snow look good even after killing her (if that\u2019s how she dies)? Will he make her work within a system that never gave her a chance and have her last appearance be drenched in Nazi symbolism? Because of the double standard that\u2019s also present in the books affecting how Daenerys is perceived, I\u2019m no longer a fan of the theory of her burning King\u2019s Landing. But, if it happens (and it won\u2019t happen without its share of issues), please, GRRM, let her voice be heard, pay attention to her previous characterization, reflect on how those actions will be tied to the book series\u2019 themes and give her a chance to redeem herself and ultimately end on the side of the heroes (because that\u2019s what she is, and that\u2019s important to acknowledge because of her previous acts, the series\u2019 themes and how she compares - or doesn\u2019t - to the actual villains of the story).</p><p>Anyway, I agree with you that it was great to see Daenerys rule in Meereen and that it\u2019d a shame if GRRM doesn\u2019t recognize that in the future books. I\u2019m not sure the original Daenerys as he envisioned was going to be as revolutionary as Daenerys is, but, considering the OTL as it is, if their trajectories have changed, then naturally their endgames must be different as well (fitting with GRRM\u2019s gardener identity).</p><p>I\u2019d argue that Daenerys\u2019 ending should emphasize her as a political force. Therefore, if one must have her have her dark phase and then burn King\u2019s Landing (and not allow her to continue the Targaryen dynasty, which I would have liked to see), then have Daenerys decide to turn back east with her three dragons to continue the good fight after concluding that Essos has never felt like home, but it was where she did put the effort to build trees, while Westeros was the dream and home of her ancestors, who do not need to wholly define her. It is the end of the Targaryen dynasty, but not with her death. Why I\u2019d choose an ending like this: 1) The circular ending matches show!Jon\u2019s, whose ending I thought would be fitting for book!Jon\u2019s as well; 2) She ends her journey being more critical of external influences and more aware of her needs and actual experiences instead of simply taking on Viserys\u2019 and her ancestors\u2019 dreams to find an ultimately failed sense of belonging. She\u2019s the one in charge of her journey from now on, which is an existential victory of sorts. The continent where she made and can still make a difference is Essos, and she\u2019ll return aware of that, and with a more realistic and resilient sense of purpose; 3) It emphasizes her role as a queen and a revolutionary, not only as a savior (to people who have been in the abstract for her for most of her life); 4) It won\u2019t be a totally happy ending. She\u2019ll be left scarred from the events she witnessed in Westeros, from the burning of King\u2019s Landing to the fight against the Others to the rejection she experiences from the lords and smallfolk alike. She\u2019ll always feel like she needs to atone for her mistakes and she\u2019ll be another Targaryen queen who failed. She still won\u2019t have found a place and people to call her \u201chome\u201d. 5) That being said, she\u2019s alive, in a position of power, more aware of herself and her place in the world and with the possibility of continuing to do good. And she\u2019s also mentally stable and a hero, far from a villain.</p><p>So, what did you think? Do you think there are double standards against Daenerys in the books as well, especially in regards to how the inevitability of the wars is framed? What did you think of my observations about the (likely) upcoming burning of King\u2019s Landing? Would you rather have her sit on the Iron Throne, go back to Essos or something else entirely? Please tell me what you think! I really enjoy your posts and they are the reason why I felt the need to gather my thoughts.</p>",

As we know, GRRM is a \u201cgardener\u201d, so, as he had more ideas for the characters in Westeros, he had to create more stories for Daenerys as well, and one of them was her ruling in Meereen. This brings me back to your essay about her: being the fire of the song of ice and fire, why isn\u2019t her anti-slavery war in Essos given as much importance as the War for the Dawn? Why should it be a mid-point for the character to realize that her endgame is Westeros? If Jon\u2019s struggles against the Others represent the battle against the supernatural form of slavery and the ice part of the story, why shouldn\u2019t Daenerys\u2019 narrative be the battle against the human form of slavery and the fire part of the story? I\u2019d argue both are just wars, though the WftD is an easier, more black-and-white, standard fantasy conflict, while the war in Slaver\u2019s Bay has more nuance (one may argue that the characters revolving Daenerys are not fleshed out enough or dumbed down military speaking or one may point out the racist aspects of Daenerys\u2019 story, but the socioeconomic situation is indeed complex) and is more controversial, which only reinforces the need to continue developing this story and, most importantly, Daenerys\u2019 political career (which I\u2019ll get to later).</p><p>These questions show that GRRM also has his architect side. Daenerys\u2019 endgame is Westeros because he\u2019s already said his story is about Westeros. Therefore, he needs to transition her to a mindset that\u2019ll propel her to finally leave, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s considered (or cared enough about) certain negative implications that I laid out above (and it\u2019s not exhaustive, other writers have talked a lot more about it).</p><p><b>b)</b> We also need to consider how the show factors into those speculations and how we look at the story, because, like it or not, GRRM still told the ending to D&amp;D, even if in a very simplified manner. Before season eight aired, I was fine with the idea that all of the six main characters were going through the darkest phases of their journeys, but that Daenerys\u2019 in particular would cause more collateral damage as a natural consequence of the power she wields. After season eight, however, I started to reflect if GRRM may have double standards against Daenerys as well. In any case, the show has made it very likely that her fire and blood phase will culminate with her burning of King\u2019s Landing. On the one hand, this could be dramatically interesting, but on the other hand, it could amplify those very double standards against her. I\u2019ll explain:</p><p><i>b1) </i>As of ADWD, Daenerys hasn\u2019t yet been exposed to the atrocities her father has committed (in part because she refuses to do so). What better (if deeply tragic) way to do so than have her directly confronting the legacy he\u2019s left behind - namely, the wildfire caches all over the city? It would shatter her sense of purpose in life and lead her to question herself and her sanity. It would lead her to be critical of the Targaryen legacy and how she wants to engage with it and how she uses it to define herself. It would make her feel more lonely and isolated than ever, especially since one of her core wishes is to belong somewhere, to have a place to call home\u2026 And no one would embrace her if they think she did it on purpose. I can see this being dramatically really interesting.</p><p><i>b2</i>) But I have my reservations about this: 1) If this happens, Daenerys will be in need for redemption and this doesn\u2019t feel right to me (similar to how I feel about Arya). 1.1) She is not and has never been morally flawed as characters like Jaime or Theon or even Tyrion and Sandor. As of ADWD, she\u2019s only committed two morally ambiguous acts (ie crucifying the 163 masters and torturing the wineseller\u2019s daughters). She\u2019s always had her heart in the right place and, if this tragedy happened, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily turn her darker, she\u2019d be a victim of circumstance (and I say so because I don\u2019t see how her actions are any different than the other leaders fighting in the Wot5K, again the double standards\u2026). I dislike how this would frame her outcome in such a moralistic way, especially considering how her character and arc have been paralleled with Jon\u2019s and I\u2019ve yet to see any theories of his character taking a dark turn. 1.2) She\u2019s one of the characters who better embody the books\u2019 idea that you have to do the right thing even if you don\u2019t get anything in return. And yet, not only her war in Essos will be given less narrative importance compared to the WftD (because it will be treated as a middle stage to her fire and blood phase), but when she arrives in the protagonist-centered Westeros, she will be committing war crimes (even if accidentally in the case of the burning of KL)? I\u2019m not a fan of this scenario because it strengthens the idea that she can\u2019t be a peacetime queen because her choice in her final ADWD chapter was fire and blood (which as I\u2019ve said ignores all the time she spent trying to make peace). 2) Also, I\u2019ve noticed a tendency of fandom also demonizing the Targaryen dynasty as a whole, the dragons and the Iron Throne (which to them serves the same thematic purpose as the Ring of LoTR) and I don\u2019t buy their interpretation either because we\u2019ve already seen previous kings who did right by Westeros sitting on the Iron Throne and using their dragons. Having Daenerys fail so spectacularly to restore her family\u2019s dynasty and destroy its most important symbol (the Iron Throne) does not say much about the dynasty\u2019s nature or even the corrupting nature of power as they\u2019d like to believe, it mainly creates sexist implications (that I\u2019ll discuss below). Of course, this depends on how it\u2019s framed: if the dynasty\u2019s end is meant to be a tragedy because of Aerys II\u2019s actions, then I\u2019d buy it; if the dynasty\u2019s end is meant to be a better course of action for Westeros, then it does not work. I wonder why the Targaryens are so vilified when every other house is also working under the parameters of feudalism. Feudalism as a whole should be criticized. Why are the North or Dorne in any better conditions under the governments of House Stark and House Martell? And if GRRM wanted to make an statement about how it\u2019s bad for one individual to accumulate so much power under a centralized government, he really failed, because the Targaryen dynasty is made of successes as much as failures. 3) I\u2019d still expect Daenerys to choose a diplomatic course of action before ultimately deciding to use her dragons on Team Aegon. Heck, it\u2019s still mind-blowing to me to know how the Yunkish masters have burned a lot more things in ADWD than Daenerys and then envision a scenario where she decides to go fire and blood and then accidentally burns everything. GRRM will have to be careful with how he executes this plot if this happens, precisely because it doesn\u2019t gel that well with her previous characterization.</p><p><i>b3</i>) If Daenerys burning KL comes to pass (and the show made it seem very likely that it will), then Daenerys is most likely another queen who failed, which is another tired plot point as well. Anyone who\u2019s read F&amp;B knows that Aerea and Rhaella Targaryen, Rhaena Targaryen, Rhaenys Targaryen, Rhaenyra Targaryen and Daena Targaryen were all considered as queens but were ultimately passed over for their male relatives. It\u2019s a shame that GRRM had so many opportunities to let women rule and chose not to, so why can\u2019t Daenerys be the ultimate change for the dynasty? Related to that point, why can\u2019t she succeed in re-establishing her dynasty when Aegon the Conqueror could? You can\u2019t escape the gender aspect of her potential failure, and having Sansa end as QITN doesn\u2019t fix that, it only makes one question the double standard that plagues House Targaryen and not the others. Finally, in hindsight of the historical (and GRRM\u2019s) pattern of setting female rulers aside and of everything that might happen to Daenerys in the books, having Aegon take the throne and get the love from the smallfolk Daenerys craves for only adds salt to the wounds.</p><p><i>b4</i>) Of course, all I\u2019m supposing that happened in the show and will also happen in the books is that Daenerys will burn King\u2019s Landing. Will she be made a villain and implied mad as well after a lot of stupid foreshadowing in which male characters only told us what the writers wanted the viewers to see, rather than the writers actually showing signs of madness? Will she willingly burn a city full of innocents? Will she be robbed of her perspective by waving away all her actions as \u201cTargaryen madness\u201d (another way of the fandom demonizing the Targaryens, which the text doesn\u2019t really support if you look closely)? Will GRRM not pay attention to how those actions could undermine the book series\u2019 main themes (not that the fucking show has conveyed any themes in a consistent manner, but that\u2019s a bigger issue)? Will he have it happen at a point that\u2019ll leave Daenerys with no chance to redeem herself and end her story with her legacy forever tarnished in-universe, general awareness and pop culture? Will he make Jon Snow look good even after killing her (if that\u2019s how she dies)? Will he make her work within a system that never gave her a chance and have her last appearance be drenched in Nazi symbolism? Because of the double standard that\u2019s also present in the books affecting how Daenerys is perceived, I\u2019m no longer a fan of the theory of her burning King\u2019s Landing. But, if it happens (and it won\u2019t happen without its share of issues), please, GRRM, let her voice be heard, pay attention to her previous characterization, reflect on how those actions will be tied to the book series\u2019 themes and give her a chance to redeem herself and ultimately end on the side of the heroes (because that\u2019s what she is, and that\u2019s important to acknowledge because of her previous acts, the series\u2019 themes and how she compares - or doesn\u2019t - to the actual villains of the story).</p><p>Anyway, I agree with you that it was great to see Daenerys rule in Meereen and that it\u2019d a shame if GRRM doesn\u2019t recognize that in the future books. I\u2019m not sure the original Daenerys as he envisioned was going to be as revolutionary as Daenerys is, but, considering the OTL as it is, if their trajectories have changed, then naturally their endgames must be different as well (fitting with GRRM\u2019s gardener identity).</p><p>I\u2019d argue that Daenerys\u2019 ending should emphasize her as a political force. Therefore, if one must have her have her dark phase and then burn King\u2019s Landing (and not allow her to continue the Targaryen dynasty, which I would have liked to see), then have Daenerys decide to turn back east with her three dragons to continue the good fight after concluding that Essos has never felt like home, but it was where she did put the effort to build trees, while Westeros was the dream and home of her ancestors, who do not need to wholly define her. It is the end of the Targaryen dynasty, but not with her death. Why I\u2019d choose an ending like this: 1) The circular ending matches show!Jon\u2019s, whose ending I thought would be fitting for book!Jon\u2019s as well; 2) She ends her journey being more critical of external influences and more aware of her needs and actual experiences instead of simply taking on Viserys\u2019 and her ancestors\u2019 dreams to find an ultimately failed sense of belonging. She\u2019s the one in charge of her journey from now on, which is an existential victory of sorts. The continent where she made and can still make a difference is Essos, and she\u2019ll return aware of that, and with a more realistic and resilient sense of purpose; 3) It emphasizes her role as a queen and a revolutionary, not only as a savior (to people who have been in the abstract for her for most of her life); 4) It won\u2019t be a totally happy ending. She\u2019ll be left scarred from the events she witnessed in Westeros, from the burning of King\u2019s Landing to the fight against the Others to the rejection she experiences from the lords and smallfolk alike. She\u2019ll always feel like she needs to atone for her mistakes and she\u2019ll be another Targaryen queen who failed. She still won\u2019t have found a place and people to call her \u201chome\u201d. 5) That being said, she\u2019s alive, in a position of power, more aware of herself and her place in the world and with the possibility of continuing to do good. And she\u2019s also mentally stable and a hero, far from a villain.</p><p>So, what did you think? Do you think there are double standards against Daenerys in the books as well, especially in regards to how the inevitability of the wars is framed? What did you think of my observations about the (likely) upcoming burning of King\u2019s Landing? Would you rather have her sit on the Iron Throne, go back to Essos or something else entirely? Please tell me what you think! I really enjoy your posts and they are the reason why I felt the need to gather my thoughts.</p>",

I\u2019ve read your \u201c<a href=\"https://khaleesirin.tumblr.com/post/185602049569/daenerys-targaryen-is-the-great-other-before\">Daenerys Targaryen is the Great Othe</a>r\u201d analysis, I thought it was particularly amazing (because the standard is high as it is), it gave me a new lens to look at and analyze Daenerys\u2019 story and it propelled me to reflect further about her arc and themes in relation to the other characters\u2019. I\u2019d like to know your opinion about my musings.</p><p>So, I think it\u2019s obvious that the show - at least in its final episodes - had double standards when it came to Daenerys in order to paint her in a bad light. However, I wonder if that won\u2019t also be the case in the books, to a lesser extent.</p><p>One of the major themes permeating FeastDance as a whole is false peace, which you can see with the Lannisters and the Tyrells squabbling over Tommen; the several factions in the Night\u2019s Watch; the Freys in the Riverlands; the Boltons and the former Stark vassals (especially the Manderlys); Dorne\u2019s supposed allegiance to the Iron Throne (and also Arianne\u2019s years-long resentment); the situation in the Vale with Littlefinger as Lord Protector; Team Aegon out of public sight (for the most part); and, of course, Daenerys\u2019 campaign in Slaver\u2019s Bay. In all of these plots, people are trying to resolve their disagreements in vain: sometimes war is inevitable.</p><p>What makes me uncomfortable is that, as far as I\u2019m aware, Daenerys is the only character whose choice of war (or, more precisely, Fire and Blood) is possibly being framed negatively. I say \u201cpossibly\u201d because we don\u2019t have TWOW in our hands to be sure, but you can see that\u2019s a possibility considering how a significant part of the fandom has come to the conclusion that she just can\u2019t be a peacetime queen, she has shown her \u201ctrue colors\u201d. This opinion never sat well with me because, as I said, lots of characters are heading towards this direction, and Daenerys herself only arrived at that place after having made many efforts to make amends, but they weren\u2019t meant to last because some wars need to be fought on. It is a specific situation that will likely bring out her more violent impulses, yet it doesn\u2019t define her character as a whole. I\u2019ve read arguments about how the peace was worth it in Meereen and how Daenerys is now going backwards, but I simply disagree with them and, considering the pattern in the narrative and the anti-slavery ideas in Fevre Dream, I lean towards GRRM disagreeing as well (I\u2019d really like to know if his main inspiration for Daenerys\u2019 storyline was the American Civil War or the Iraq war, because knowing that would really clarify what he is trying to convey with her storyline). In any case, again, why is she the only character whose decision to fight the just (and inevitable) war is being framed as a step too far, a turn to the darkness?</p><p><b>a)</b> In this case, I think it\u2019s worth considering the Doylist viewpoint. ASOIAF was supposed to be a trilogy of books about Westeros first and foremost. Daenerys was supposed to live among the Dothraki, birth her dragons, get an army and get to Westeros in the beginning of the third book. As we know, GRRM is a \u201cgardener\u201d, so, as he had more ideas for the characters in Westeros, he had to create more stories for Daenerys as well, and one of them was her ruling in Meereen.

Why should it be a mid-point for the character to realize that her endgame is Westeros? If Jon\u2019s struggles against the Others represent the battle against the supernatural form of slavery and the ice part of the story, why shouldn\u2019t Daenerys\u2019 narrative be the battle against the human form of slavery and the fire part of the story? I\u2019d argue both are just wars, though the WftD is an easier, more black-and-white, standard fantasy conflict, while the war in Slaver\u2019s Bay has more nuance (one may argue that the characters revolving Daenerys are not fleshed out enough or dumbed down military speaking or one may point out the racist aspects of Daenerys\u2019 story, but the socioeconomic situation is indeed complex) and is more controversial, which only reinforces the need to continue developing this story and, most importantly, Daenerys\u2019 political career (which I\u2019ll get to later).</p><p>These questions show that GRRM also has his architect side. Daenerys\u2019 endgame is Westeros because he\u2019s already said his story is about Westeros. Therefore, he needs to transition her to a mindset that\u2019ll propel her to finally leave, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s considered (or cared enough about) certain negative implications that I laid out above (and it\u2019s not exhaustive, other writers have talked a lot more about it).</p><p><b>b)</b> We also need to consider how the show factors into those speculations and how we look at the story, because, like it or not, GRRM still told the ending to D&amp;D, even if in a very simplified manner.

Will she be robbed of her perspective by waving away all her actions as \u201cTargaryen madness\u201d (another way of the fandom demonizing the Targaryens, which the text doesn\u2019t really support if you look closely)? Will GRRM not pay attention to how those actions could undermine the book series\u2019 main themes (not that the fucking show has conveyed any themes in a consistent manner, but that\u2019s a bigger issue)? Will he have it happen at a point that\u2019ll leave Daenerys with no chance to redeem herself and end her story with her legacy forever tarnished in-universe, general awareness and pop culture? Will he make Jon Snow look good even after killing her (if that\u2019s how she dies)? Will he make her work within a system that never gave her a chance and have her last appearance be drenched in Nazi symbolism? Because of the double standard that\u2019s also present in the books affecting how Daenerys is perceived, I\u2019m no longer a fan of the theory of her burning King\u2019s Landing. But, if it happens (and it won\u2019t happen without its share of issues), please, GRRM, let her voice be heard, pay attention to her previous characterization, reflect on how those actions will be tied to the book series\u2019 themes and give her a chance to redeem herself and ultimately end on the side of the heroes (because that\u2019s what she is, and that\u2019s important to acknowledge because of her previous acts, the series\u2019 themes and how she compares - or doesn\u2019t - to the actual villains of the story).</p><p>Anyway, I agree with you that it was great to see Daenerys rule in Meereen and that it\u2019d a shame if GRRM doesn\u2019t recognize that in the future books. I\u2019m not sure the original Daenerys as he envisioned was going to be as revolutionary as Daenerys is, but, considering the OTL as it is, if their trajectories have changed, then naturally their endgames must be different as well (fitting with GRRM\u2019s gardener identity).</p><p>I\u2019d argue that Daenerys\u2019 ending should emphasize her as a political force. Therefore, if one must have her have her dark phase and then burn King\u2019s Landing (and not allow her to continue the Targaryen dynasty, which I would have liked to see), then have Daenerys decide to turn back east with her three dragons to continue the good fight after concluding that Essos has never felt like home, but it was where she did put the effort to build trees, while Westeros was the dream and home of her ancestors, who do not need to wholly define her. It is the end of the Targaryen dynasty, but not with her death. Why I\u2019d choose an ending like this: 1) The circular ending matches show!Jon\u2019s, whose ending I thought would be fitting for book!Jon\u2019s as well; 2) She ends her journey being more critical of external influences and more aware of her needs and actual experiences instead of simply taking on Viserys\u2019 and her ancestors\u2019 dreams to find an ultimately failed sense of belonging. She\u2019s the one in charge of her journey from now on, which is an existential victory of sorts. The continent where she made and can still make a difference is Essos, and she\u2019ll return aware of that, and with a more realistic and resilient sense of purpose; 3) It emphasizes her role as a queen and a revolutionary, not only as a savior (to people who have been in the abstract for her for most of her life); 4) It won\u2019t be a totally happy ending. She\u2019ll be left scarred from the events she witnessed in Westeros, from the burning of King\u2019s Landing to the fight against the Others to the rejection she experiences from the lords and smallfolk alike. She\u2019ll always feel like she needs to atone for her mistakes and she\u2019ll be another Targaryen queen who failed. She still won\u2019t have found a place and people to call her \u201chome\u201d. 5) That being said, she\u2019s alive, in a position of power, more aware of herself and her place in the world and with the possibility of continuing to do good. And she\u2019s also mentally stable and a hero, far from a villain.</p><p>So, what did you think? Do you think there are double standards against Daenerys in the books as well, especially in regards to how the inevitability of the wars is framed? What did you think of my observations about the (likely) upcoming burning of King\u2019s Landing? Would you rather have her sit on the Iron Throne, go back to Essos or something else entirely? Please tell me what you think! I really enjoy your posts and they are the reason why I felt the need to gather my thoughts.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Hi, khaleesirin! I&rsquo;ve read your &ldquo;<a href=\"https://khaleesirin.tumblr.com/post/185602049569/daenerys-targaryen-is-the-great-other-before\">Daenerys Targaryen is the Great Othe</a>r&rdquo; analysis, I thought it was particularly amazing (because the standard is high as it is), it gave me a new lens to look at and analyze Daenerys&rsquo; story and it propelled me to reflect further about her arc and themes in relation to the other characters&rsquo;. I&rsquo;d like to know your opinion about my musings.</p><p>So, I think it&rsquo;s obvious that the show - at least in its final episodes - had double standards when it came to Daenerys in order to paint her in a bad light. However, I wonder if that won&rsquo;t also be the case in the books, to a lesser extent.</p><p>One of the major themes permeating FeastDance as a whole is false peace, which you can see with the Lannisters and the Tyrells squabbling over Tommen; the several factions in the Night&rsquo;s Watch; the Freys in the Riverlands; the Boltons and the former Stark vassals (especially the Manderlys); Dorne&rsquo;s supposed allegiance to the Iron Throne (and also Arianne&rsquo;s years-long resentment); the situation in the Vale with Littlefinger as Lord Protector; Team Aegon out of public sight (for the most part); and, of course, Daenerys&rsquo; campaign in Slaver&rsquo;s Bay. In all of these plots, people are trying to resolve their disagreements in vain: sometimes war is inevitable.</p><p>What makes me uncomfortable is that, as far as I&rsquo;m aware, Daenerys is the only character whose choice of war (or, more precisely, Fire and Blood) is possibly being framed negatively. I say &ldquo;possibly&rdquo; because we don&rsquo;t have TWOW in our hands to be sure, but you can see that&rsquo;s a possibility considering how a significant part of the fandom has come to the conclusion that she just can&rsquo;t be a peacetime queen, she has shown her &ldquo;true colors&rdquo;. This opinion never sat well with me because, as I said, lots of characters are heading towards this direction, and Daenerys herself only arrived at that place after having made many efforts to make amends, but they weren&rsquo;t meant to last because some wars need to be fought on. It is a specific situation that will likely bring out her more violent impulses, yet it doesn&rsquo;t define her character as a whole. I&rsquo;ve read arguments about how the peace was worth it in Meereen and how Daenerys is now going backwards, but I simply disagree with them and, considering the pattern in the narrative and the anti-slavery ideas in Fevre Dream, I lean towards GRRM disagreeing as well (I&rsquo;d really like to know if his main inspiration for Daenerys&rsquo; storyline was the American Civil War or the Iraq war, because knowing that would really clarify what he is trying to convey with her storyline). In any case, again, why is she the only character whose decision to fight the just (and inevitable) war is being framed as a step too far, a turn to the darkness?</p><p><b>a)</b> In this case, I think it&rsquo;s worth considering the Doylist viewpoint. ASOIAF was supposed to be a trilogy of books about Westeros first and foremost. Daenerys was supposed to live among the Dothraki, birth her dragons, get an army and get to Westeros in the beginning of the third book. As we know, GRRM is a &ldquo;gardener&rdquo;, so, as he had more ideas for the characters in Westeros, he had to create more stories for Daenerys as well, and one of them was her ruling in Meereen. This brings me back to your essay about her: being the fire of the song of ice and fire, why isn&rsquo;t her anti-slavery war in Essos given as much importance as the War for the Dawn? Why should it be a mid-point for the character to realize that her endgame is Westeros? If Jon&rsquo;s struggles against the Others represent the battle against the supernatural form of slavery and the ice part of the story, why shouldn&rsquo;t Daenerys&rsquo; narrative be the battle against the human form of slavery and the fire part of the story? I&rsquo;d argue both are just wars, though the WftD is an easier, more black-and-white, standard fantasy conflict, while the war in Slaver&rsquo;s Bay has more nuance (one may argue that the characters revolving Daenerys are not fleshed out enough or dumbed down military speaking or one may point out the racist aspects of Daenerys&rsquo; story, but the socioeconomic situation is indeed complex) and is more controversial, which only reinforces the need to continue developing this story and, most importantly, Daenerys&rsquo; political career (which I&rsquo;ll get to later).</p><p>These questions show that GRRM also has his architect side. Daenerys&rsquo; endgame is Westeros because he&rsquo;s already said his story is about Westeros. Therefore, he needs to transition her to a mindset that&rsquo;ll propel her to finally leave, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s considered (or cared enough about) certain negative implications that I laid out above (and it&rsquo;s not exhaustive, other writers have talked a lot more about it).</p><p><b>b)</b> We also need to consider how the show factors into those speculations and how we look at the story, because, like it or not, GRRM still told the ending to D&amp;D, even if in a very simplified manner. Before season eight aired, I was fine with the idea that all of the six main characters were going through the darkest phases of their journeys, but that Daenerys&rsquo; in particular would cause more collateral damage as a natural consequence of the power she wields. After season eight, however, I started to reflect if GRRM may have double standards against Daenerys as well. In any case, the show has made it very likely that her fire and blood phase will culminate with her burning of King&rsquo;s Landing. On the one hand, this could be dramatically interesting, but on the other hand, it could amplify those very double standards against her. I&rsquo;ll explain:</p><p><i>b1) </i>As of ADWD, Daenerys hasn&rsquo;t yet been exposed to the atrocities her father has committed (in part because she refuses to do so). What better (if deeply tragic) way to do so than have her directly confronting the legacy he&rsquo;s left behind - namely, the wildfire caches all over the city? It would shatter her sense of purpose in life and lead her to question herself and her sanity. It would lead her to be critical of the Targaryen legacy and how she wants to engage with it and how she uses it to define herself. It would make her feel more lonely and isolated than ever, especially since one of her core wishes is to belong somewhere, to have a place to call home&hellip; And no one would embrace her if they think she did it on purpose. I can see this being dramatically really interesting.</p><p><i>b2</i>) But I have my reservations about this: 1) If this happens, Daenerys will be in need for redemption and this doesn&rsquo;t feel right to me (similar to how I feel about Arya). 1.1) She is not and has never been morally flawed as characters like Jaime or Theon or even Tyrion and Sandor. As of ADWD, she&rsquo;s only committed two morally ambiguous acts (ie crucifying the 163 masters and torturing the wineseller&rsquo;s daughters). She&rsquo;s always had her heart in the right place and, if this tragedy happened, it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily turn her darker, she&rsquo;d be a victim of circumstance (and I say so because I don&rsquo;t see how her actions are any different than the other leaders fighting in the Wot5K, again the double standards&hellip;). I dislike how this would frame her outcome in such a moralistic way, especially considering how her character and arc have been paralleled with Jon&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;ve yet to see any theories of his character taking a dark turn. 1.2) She&rsquo;s one of the characters who better embody the books&rsquo; idea that you have to do the right thing even if you don&rsquo;t get anything in return. And yet, not only her war in Essos will be given less narrative importance compared to the WftD (because it will be treated as a middle stage to her fire and blood phase), but when she arrives in the protagonist-centered Westeros, she will be committing war crimes (even if accidentally in the case of the burning of KL)? I&rsquo;m not a fan of this scenario because it strengthens the idea that she can&rsquo;t be a peacetime queen because her choice in her final ADWD chapter was fire and blood (which as I&rsquo;ve said ignores all the time she spent trying to make peace). 2) Also, I&rsquo;ve noticed a tendency of fandom also demonizing the Targaryen dynasty as a whole, the dragons and the Iron Throne (which to them serves the same thematic purpose as the Ring of LoTR) and I don&rsquo;t buy their interpretation either because we&rsquo;ve already seen previous kings who did right by Westeros sitting on the Iron Throne and using their dragons. Having Daenerys fail so spectacularly to restore her family&rsquo;s dynasty and destroy its most important symbol (the Iron Throne) does not say much about the dynasty&rsquo;s nature or even the corrupting nature of power as they&rsquo;d like to believe, it mainly creates sexist implications (that I&rsquo;ll discuss below). Of course, this depends on how it&rsquo;s framed: if the dynasty&rsquo;s end is meant to be a tragedy because of Aerys II&rsquo;s actions, then I&rsquo;d buy it; if the dynasty&rsquo;s end is meant to be a better course of action for Westeros, then it does not work. I wonder why the Targaryens are so vilified when every other house is also working under the parameters of feudalism. Feudalism as a whole should be criticized. Why are the North or Dorne in any better conditions under the governments of House Stark and House Martell? And if GRRM wanted to make an statement about how it&rsquo;s bad for one individual to accumulate so much power under a centralized government, he really failed, because the Targaryen dynasty is made of successes as much as failures. 3) I&rsquo;d still expect Daenerys to choose a diplomatic course of action before ultimately deciding to use her dragons on Team Aegon. Heck, it&rsquo;s still mind-blowing to me to know how the Yunkish masters have burned a lot more things in ADWD than Daenerys and then envision a scenario where she decides to go fire and blood and then accidentally burns everything. GRRM will have to be careful with how he executes this plot if this happens, precisely because it doesn&rsquo;t gel that well with her previous characterization.</p><p><i>b3</i>) If Daenerys burning KL comes to pass (and the show made it seem very likely that it will), then Daenerys is most likely another queen who failed, which is another tired plot point as well. Anyone who&rsquo;s read F&amp;B knows that Aerea and Rhaella Targaryen, Rhaena Targaryen, Rhaenys Targaryen, Rhaenyra Targaryen and Daena Targaryen were all considered as queens but were ultimately passed over for their male relatives. It&rsquo;s a shame that GRRM had so many opportunities to let women rule and chose not to, so why can&rsquo;t Daenerys be the ultimate change for the dynasty? Related to that point, why can&rsquo;t she succeed in re-establishing her dynasty when Aegon the Conqueror could? You can&rsquo;t escape the gender aspect of her potential failure, and having Sansa end as QITN doesn&rsquo;t fix that, it only makes one question the double standard that plagues House Targaryen and not the others. Finally, in hindsight of the historical (and GRRM&rsquo;s) pattern of setting female rulers aside and of everything that might happen to Daenerys in the books, having Aegon take the throne and get the love from the smallfolk Daenerys craves for only adds salt to the wounds.</p><p><i>b4</i>) Of course, all I&rsquo;m supposing that happened in the show and will also happen in the books is that Daenerys will burn King&rsquo;s Landing. Will she be made a villain and implied mad as well after a lot of stupid foreshadowing in which male characters only told us what the writers wanted the viewers to see, rather than the writers actually showing signs of madness? Will she willingly burn a city full of innocents? Will she be robbed of her perspective by waving away all her actions as &ldquo;Targaryen madness&rdquo; (another way of the fandom demonizing the Targaryens, which the text doesn&rsquo;t really support if you look closely)? Will GRRM not pay attention to how those actions could undermine the book series&rsquo; main themes (not that the fucking show has conveyed any themes in a consistent manner, but that&rsquo;s a bigger issue)? Will he have it happen at a point that&rsquo;ll leave Daenerys with no chance to redeem herself and end her story with her legacy forever tarnished in-universe, general awareness and pop culture? Will he make Jon Snow look good even after killing her (if that&rsquo;s how she dies)? Will he make her work within a system that never gave her a chance and have her last appearance be drenched in Nazi symbolism?
