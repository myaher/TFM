        "body": "<p>Jon, on the back of Rhaegal, wandered endlessly through the mashed peas, the icy wind whipping his face. He could see nothing except the night and the fog as far as the eye could see, as if the whole world had been covered in a few seconds. In the dim light, he thought he could distinguish the shape of another dragon, further down. Was it Dany and Drogon?<br/>Suddenly, a torrent of intense blue flames was propelled like a geyser toward him, forcing him to do a maneuver to Rhaegal to avoid it. Forced to flee the flames, Rhaegal was flying fast, Jon clutching himself as he could and glancing back. It was him. The Night King was there, perched on the huge blue-eyed Viserion, pursuing him relentlessly and trying to cover him with his endless blue fire. Jon could feel the stinging heat of the flames coming up against his back. The blue fire was getting closer and closer. Animated by the necromantic magic of the king of the dead, Viserion seemed even faster than during his lifetime, and also much stronger.<br/>Then, Drogon&rsquo;s imposing and majestic figure rises from the blizzard, roaring loudly, and violently hits Viserion, almost failing to bring down the Night King. Jon, surprised, cast another look. Daenerys, looking more than determined, throws herself with Drogon in the fight. The dance of dragons begins between Drogon and Viserion, the two large reptiles agglomerated to each other and spinning in a deadly dance in the sky, inflicting each other violent claws, bites, and other attacks of extreme savagery. The Night King, sure of himself, looks at Daenerys, and vice versa. The Queen of Dragons, furious and sad to see her child transformed, glares at the Night King. The king of the walkers seized his spear of ice, ready to throw it on the young queen despite the tumult of the two dragons. The Night King throws his spear with force, but Daenerys bends down just in time to see the ice weapon pass right over her and fall into the void. Viserion, indefatigable, closes his jaw on the wing of Drogon, while the latter, in a burst of fury, strongly bites the neck of Viserion. From the back of Rhaegal, Jon observes with apprehension and decides to come to the aid of his queen and goes with his dragon towards the aerial combat. But as he approaches, Viserion releases his hold on Drogon&rsquo;s wing and spits a mighty torrent of blue flames toward Rhaegal, who is brutally hit in the face. Rhaegal, roaring with pain, deviated from his race, Jon tried to force himself hard not to fall and manages to move away Rhaegal and masters it despite his pain. Having seen this, Daenerys, even more furious, continues the fight with Drogon against Viserion and the Night King. However, Viserion manages to free himself from the grip of his former dragon brother and disappears with his rider in the dark of the blizzard, leaving Jon and Daenerys lost on their dragons in the middle of the storm, and hearing all around them the threatening choes of Viserion, lurking all around them but without them being able to see it.<br/>******** <br/>In the crypts of Winterfell, fear and silence dominate. Mothers try as much as they can to reassure their terrified children, as does Gilly with Little Sam. Varys, sitting against a wall, remains pensive, dark, sometimes listening to what&rsquo;s going on. Sansa and Missandei also wait without saying anything. Tyrion himself rummages inward and paces, taking a sip of his bottle of wine. Sansa watches him, saying nothing.<br/>_ &ldquo;If only we were up there, we could see how it evolves &hellip;. we could even do something &hellip;.&rdquo; Tyrion muses. Varys sighs and Tyrion hears him, turning to him. &ldquo;What? At the battle of the Nera, I led the troops through the gate &hellip;.&rdquo; said the dwarf.<br/>_ &ldquo;And you got face being slashed in two.&rdquo; Varys reminded him, much to Tyrion&rsquo;s annoyance.<br/>_ &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, but at least we won &hellip;. If I was up there &hellip;.&rdquo;<br/>_ &ldquo;They would kill you.&rdquo; Sansa said to Tyrion unceremoniously. &ldquo;There is nothing we can do.&rdquo;<br/>Tyrion, annoyed, drops his wine bottle and gets closer to talk to Sansa.<br/>_ &ldquo;You would be surprised at things I could do to not join the army of the dead.&rdquo;<br/>_ &ldquo;Your remarks would not make any difference, that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here &hellip; Because we can not do anything. The most heroic thing we can do now is &hellip;. look at the truth in the face.&rdquo; Sansa adds. Tyrion listens to it, recognizing that she may mark a point.<br/>_ &ldquo;Maybe we should have stayed married.&rdquo; said Tyrion, taking another sip. Sansa smiles slightly and responds.<br/>_ &ldquo;You were the best of them &hellip; but it would not work between us &hellip;&rdquo;<br/>_&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asks Tyrion, puzzled. Sansa then announces his answer immediately.<br/>_ &ldquo;The Queen of Dragons &hellip;. your loyalty to her would become a problem.&rdquo;<br/>_&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Missandei suddenly replied, somberly, towards Sansa. &ldquo;If the queen of dragons were not there, there would be no more trouble &hellip; we would all be dead already.&rdquo; With these words, Missandei moves away, leaving Sansa, Tyrion and Varys, silent and thoughtful. Suddenly, the doors of the crypt open, surprising everyone, but the tensions subside a little when Samwell Tarly arrives, but alive, to the great relief of Gilly who comes to hug him with love.<br/>_&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Tyrion asks for this step. The fearful face of Sam makes him fear the worst, like all in the crypt.<br/>_&ldquo;We &hellip; we have been defeated. The dead have reached the walls.&rdquo;<br/>Faced with this news, the fear is gaining a little more inhabitants. Gilly takes Little Sam in her arms and tries to comfort him. Varys and Missandei exchange a really worried look, as do Sansa and Tyrion.<br/>_ &ldquo;Is there not a way for women and children to get out of this crypt, is there another way out?&rdquo; Tyrion asks Sansa. The young lady of Winterfell, despite the stress, thinks and remembers some stories told by her parents about the age of the crypts and the many secret passages it can conceal.<br/>**********<br/>On the ramparts, all prepare for defense. The wights, in endless hordes, crash against the gates and the ramparts, climbing one another, forming noisy and massive mounds to reach the top of the walls of the city. The archers, Davos and Arya shoot a lot of arrows and shoot down dozens of creatures, but their numbers keep growing. At the top of the ramparts, Brienne, Tormund, Sandor, Beric, Jaime, Gendry and Podrick are preparing for the arrival of the first creatures. In the courtyard, Lyanna and Jorah Mormont, leading the rest of the surviving soldiers, are preparing for the brutal entrance of the dead by the city gate, which is already shaking under the numerous hammering of the living corpses. From the rear of the battlefield and out of reach of archery fire, the twelve white walkers, lined up and armed, contemplate the army of the dead assaulting the city.<br/>**********<br/>In the sacred wood, Theon, Alys and the Ironborn soldiers formed a real circle of protection around the big tree at the foot of which is Bran, neutral and impassive. Theon shows deep concern about the progress of the battle.<br/>_ &ldquo;They have reached the ramparts &hellip;.&rdquo; said the young ironborn prince. Bran nods without saying a word. Theon goes to him to talk to him. &ldquo;Bran &hellip;. I wanted to tell you that everything I did &hellip;.&rdquo;<br/>_ &ldquo;Everything you did led you to where you should be today &hellip;. home.&rdquo; Bran interrupted Theon, without showing any animosity towards him. Theon seems moved by the young man&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Now forgive me, but I must leave you.&rdquo;<br/>_&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asks Theon, perplexed. Bran does not answer and turns to the tree, puts his hand on it, near the face engraved in the bark. Bran&rsquo;s eyes flinch, turning white and milky, and the young man plunges into another trance, seeming to look deep into the memories of this ancestral tree.<br/>******** <br/>The wights eventually reached the heights of the walls. If Arya, Sandor, Beric, Gendry, Brienne, Tormund, Jaime and Podrick manage to repel the firsts on their arrival, very quickly, the first defenders are swept by the blades of the dead and they land in the precincts of the city. The archers and Davos find themselves also having to fight for their survival. Despite their former rivalry, Sandor and Brienne help each other against the wights that attack them, forming an effective and devastating duo. Jaime is overwhelmed by three dead but Brienne intervenes and saves it. With his fiery sword, Beric sets a dead man on fire and lets him fall on others, who in turn burn themselves. Using her faceless man talents, Arya quickly reveals herself to be formidable, with rapid movements and precise attacks with daggers and spears, managing to repel several wights alone. She even saves Gendry&rsquo;s life by piercing the skull of the zombie that had stuck him against a wall and threatened to tear his face to death.<br/>But despite all these efforts, the first dead have already sprung up in Winterfell&rsquo;s courtyard. The gates finally give way when a giant shatters the wood and makes the doors fall violently, behind him hordes of wights spilling in groups into the city. Lyanna, Jorah, and the defenders of the court find themselves fighting, too, with the energy of despair. Unfortunately, the giant charges and strikes violently around him. Lyanna is unfortunately hit by a blow and falls to the side. In the bitter struggle, Brienne grabs Podrick by the shoulder.<br/>_&ldquo;Go to the crypts, tell them that the defenses are pierced and that they must flee!&rdquo;<br/>Podrick wants to insist on not giving up Brienne, but she pushes him backwards so that he leaves, while two wights jump on her. Podrick begins to run reluctantly and tears to the eye, seeing Brienne stay behind and repel the two creatures fiercely with the intervention of Tormund and Jaime. Arya and the other defenders, despite their resistance, are forced back and down to the yard. Seeing that the defenses of the ramparts were repulsed, the twelve white walkers advanced, standing now just in front of the gates of the city, watching with their ice eyes.<br/>********* <br/>In the sky covered by the blizzard, Daenerys and Jon manage to stay together with their dragons, but still under the invisible and omnipresent threat of the Night King, who almost seems to play with their nerves.<br/>Suddenly, Viserion appeared from behind, attacking Rhaegal with his teeth and scratching his chest deeply. Jon clings as best he can to keep from falling out of the dragon and the two flying creatures stomp on each other. Daenerys on Drogon sees it and immediately rushes to Jon&rsquo;s rescue. She thinks to spit the flames of Drogon but changed her mind very quickly, she will not take the risk of touching Jon and Rhaegal. On the back of Viserion, The Night King drew his sword of ice, and Jon, seeing him do, draws Long Claw. In aerial combat, Viserion manages to grab Rhaegal&rsquo;s neck and bites him deeply. That&rsquo;s when Daenerys and Drogon arrive at full speed, violently striking Viserion, and disarming the Night King who falls into the void, disappearing into the blizzard. Having seen it fall, Jon manages to move a little Rhaegal, very hurt, while Drogon, bigger, in turn persecutes Viserion.<br/>_ &ldquo;GO ON!! KILL HIM!!&rdquo; Daenerys yells at Jon, mentioning the Night King. The latter having fallen from his terrible mount, he was now more vulnerable. Jon seizes the opportunity and trusts Daenerys and Drogon, though reluctant for a moment to leave them, he finally leads Rhaegal to the ground, while Daenerys and Drogon continue the aerial fight against the fallen dragon. But curiously, after a few bites and scratches, Viserion manages to free himself from the fight and Daenerys does not understand why, seeing him flying away and disappeaing in the blizzard, without her being able to catch him up.<br/>********* <br/>In the courtyard and in the city, the dead are pouring in hundreds and the carnage continues. Although wounded by the giant, Lyanna Mormont manages to get up, armed with her ax and rushes, screaming to the giant who continues to hit and crush all the men who come within reach. The giant seesher, seizes her in his hand and begins to compress the girl in her armor. Spitting blood and feeling death come, Lyanna, in a last gesture, pierces the eye of the giant with her dragonglass dagger, killing him instantly. The giant collapses into a heap of inert bones, and Lyanna falling beside him, dead. Harassed by wights, Jorah caught a glimpse of the scene, desperate.<br/>_ &ldquo;LYANNA!!&rdquo; he screams while managing to repel an undead.<br/>******** <br/>In the crypts, all begin to hear the muffled sounds of fighting noises and screams approaching each other little by little. Samwell alongside Gilly and their son, Varys and Missandei, Tyrion and Sansa, all are not reassured. The sudden arrival of Podrick, also wounded and in panic, is not to reassure them.<br/>_ &ldquo;The &hellip;. The defenses are pierced! The city is invaded!&rdquo; the young squire blows to the end. Tyrion reassures him as he can and forces him to take a few seconds of breath. Given the gravity of the situation, Sansa makes a decision and turns to Varys and Missandei, having successfully remembered the location of the secret tunnel in the crypt.<br/>_ &ldquo;Have everyone evacuate, let everyone follow me, we will take the passage leading out of the city.&rdquo;<br/>_ &ldquo;My lady, are you sure?&rdquo; Varys asked. But suddenly, the violent drumming of dead against the barricaded doors of the crypts leaves no place for hesitation.<br/>_&ldquo;They are here!&rdquo; Exclaims Gilly with fear.<br/>_ &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, come on!!&rdquo; insisted Tyrion in agreement with Sansa. All in the crypts are busy getting up and following the lady of Winterfell passing in front and lighting a torch to guide them in the dark.<br/>******** <br/>In Winterfell, the dead continue to spread throughout the city, devastating and slaughtering everything in their path without distinction. Brienne, Jaime, Tormund and Gendry continue to fight with determination, despite the physical exhaustion and the unstoppable advance of the dead on them. Sandor, in front of the fire and the chaos, remains paralyzed in a corner, breathing noisily and blood covering his face. Beric, while fighting, tries to bring him back to reality.<br/>_ &ldquo;CLEGANE! CLEGANE! It&rsquo;s not the moment! We need you!&rdquo;<br/>_&ldquo;Fuck off! You don&rsquo;t understand, you moron? We can&rsquo;t beat them Death is in front, and we can do nothing against her!&rdquo;<br/>Beric then hears Arya and sees her scramble like a devil against the wights and manage to drop several from the heights of the walls. Despite a visible injury to the head, the young Stark girl continues to fight.<br/>_ &ldquo;Go tell that to her!&rdquo; says Beric, pointing her to Sandor. The latter, seeing her doing and surrounded by more and more wights, reacts and rushes to her aid, followed by Beric. But suddenly, they stop abruptly their advance. Four white walkers appear, passing the gates of Winterfell in a slow but steady march, and immediately put their blue eyes on them. Beric takes a stand with his fiery sword, as does Sandor with his ax. Two of the white walkers grab their ice lances and advance towards them. The fight begins, Beric and Sandor finding themselves fighting a walker each and having to avoid their powerful blows. Two other white walkers advance towards Brienne and Jaime, who side by side, decide to face the ice creatures and start the fight too. Unfortunately, Beric is in trouble against the walker and is pushed back. Jorah intervenes to help him and also faces the monster. Sandor, too, despite his talent as a warrior, is hit violently and pushed back. All of a sudden, Arya comes up from behind and clings to the back of the walker, trying to stab him with her dagger. But the walker reacts immediately, stopping the young woman&rsquo;s wrist and throwing her over his shoulder. Arya rolls on the ground and immediatly rise with her agility, dagger in hand, and standing between Sandor and the white walker, her concentrated face and a dark look. Arya tries a new attack, but the walker is fast and blocks it, hitting her again and sending her to the ground. Sandor intervenes to help her, but the walker pushes him too, even hurting him on the shoulder with his blade of ice. As Sandor recoils, hurt, Arya takes advantage of the diversion to jump and push her dagger into the white walker&rsquo;s neck, paralyzing him instantly and reducing him into thousands of fragments of ice that collapse on the ground.<br/>Brienne is struggling with one of the white walkers, but having to back down against the powerful attacks of the monster. Jaime wants to help, but is cornered by another. While Brienne is going to receive a blow, Tormund comes screaming like a ferocious beast, throwing his whole body against the walker to destabilize him and makes him fall to the ground.<br/>_ &ldquo;GO!&rdquo; Tormund screams at Brienne and Jaime while trying to restrain the walker, who with a violent setback pushes Tormund away from him. The wildling chief is sounded on the ground, but regains his senses and with great sword blows, attacks relentlessly the walker forced to parry the blows. But the walker manages to disarm him, cutting Tormund&rsquo;s hand in the process, then stab him in the chest. Flowing blood, Tormund, frozen in pain but clenching his teeth, retains the blade of ice in his flesh with his only hand, and gives a last look at Brienne, who can not help but be horrified by the sacrifice of the wildling. Jaime manages to avoid a blow of the walker and grabs Brienne by the wrist to force her to follow him.<br/>_ &ldquo;For the northn, you motherfucker &hellip;.&rdquo; Tormund addresses the walker, spitting at him. The white walker remains impassive and lets Tormund fall back, which collapses into a pool of blood, his lifeless gaze fixed towards the sky. Everywhere else, Arya, Gendry, Davos, Sandor, Beric, Jorah and Ghost are also forced to retreat to the crypts, whose doors were, to their astonishment, destroyed. Already, surviving soldiers begin to rush in to escape.<br/>_ &ldquo;Everyone in the crypts!&rdquo; yells Arya to the others while protecting the retreat, she too being aware of the secret underground leading outside the walls of the city. Gendry, Davos, Sandor, Beric, Brienne, Jorah and Jaime remain with her to defend the positions with other troops against the advance of the dead towards them. Then, Jorah manages to make his way and starts running towards the sacred wood.<br/>_ &ldquo;Ser Jorah! Where are you going ?!&rdquo; yells Jaime while fighting.<br/>_ &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get Bran and the others, do not wait for me!&rdquo; he replied, running towards the sacred wood and also attracting a maximum of wights on him.<br/>********* <br/>Outside the walls, Jon and Rhaegal manage to emerge from the blizzard to find themselves a few meters above the ground. Jon can contemplate with horror the field of battle covered with a sea of \u200b\u200bcorpses and farther away, Winterfell in flames and besieging on all sides by the dead. Then he saw him &hellip;. Standing in the middle of the battlefield, the Night King stands there, standing, impassive, and almost seems to be waiting for him. For Jon, this is the opportunity.<br/>Jon makes Rhaegal spit fire, with all his strength, and the torrent of flames covers the Night King, who did not try to avoid it. A few seconds pass and with astonishment, Jon sees the Night King emerging from the flames, unharmed, and addressing to him what looks almost like a smirk. Suddenly, Viserion rises again from the mist, at great speed, and hits Rhaegal with full force. Jon is unhinged instantly and falls from several meters into the snow, still dampening his fall. The two dragons begin a fight almost on the ground, violent and fierce. Jon, dizzy, manages to get back on his feet, in the middle of the field of snow and corpses, and a hundred yards away from him, the Night King facing him. Jon picks up Long Claw who has fallen beside him and is ready to fight. But the young man is horrified at the sight of three white walkers arriving and standing behind the Night King. The latter, seeing in Jon&rsquo;s gesture a challenge, seems to have ordered the others to stay behind and walks alone toward Jon, unsheathing his blade of ice, amid the ashes and smoke. Jon, both hands firmly on Long Claw&rsquo;s, stands ready and dodges the Night King&rsquo;s first attack by rolling on the side. The duel starts.</p>",

            "comment": "<p>Jon, on the back of Rhaegal, wandered endlessly through the mashed peas, the icy wind whipping his face. He could see nothing except the night and the fog as far as the eye could see, as if the whole world had been covered in a few seconds. In the dim light, he thought he could distinguish the shape of another dragon, further down. Was it Dany and Drogon?<br>Suddenly, a torrent of intense blue flames was propelled like a geyser toward him, forcing him to do a maneuver to Rhaegal to avoid it. Forced to flee the flames, Rhaegal was flying fast, Jon clutching himself as he could and glancing back. It was him. The Night King was there, perched on the huge blue-eyed Viserion, pursuing him relentlessly and trying to cover him with his endless blue fire. Jon could feel the stinging heat of the flames coming up against his back. The blue fire was getting closer and closer. Animated by the necromantic magic of the king of the dead, Viserion seemed even faster than during his lifetime, and also much stronger.<br>Then, Drogon\u2019s imposing and majestic figure rises from the blizzard, roaring loudly, and violently hits Viserion, almost failing to bring down the Night King. Jon, surprised, cast another look. Daenerys, looking more than determined, throws herself with Drogon in the fight. The dance of dragons begins between Drogon and Viserion, the two large reptiles agglomerated to each other and spinning in a deadly dance in the sky, inflicting each other violent claws, bites, and other attacks of extreme savagery. The Night King, sure of himself, looks at Daenerys, and vice versa. The Queen of Dragons, furious and sad to see her child transformed, glares at the Night King. The king of the walkers seized his spear of ice, ready to throw it on the young queen despite the tumult of the two dragons. The Night King throws his spear with force, but Daenerys bends down just in time to see the ice weapon pass right over her and fall into the void. Viserion, indefatigable, closes his jaw on the wing of Drogon, while the latter, in a burst of fury, strongly bites the neck of Viserion. From the back of Rhaegal, Jon observes with apprehension and decides to come to the aid of his queen and goes with his dragon towards the aerial combat. But as he approaches, Viserion releases his hold on Drogon\u2019s wing and spits a mighty torrent of blue flames toward Rhaegal, who is brutally hit in the face. Rhaegal, roaring with pain, deviated from his race, Jon tried to force himself hard not to fall and manages to move away Rhaegal and masters it despite his pain. Having seen this, Daenerys, even more furious, continues the fight with Drogon against Viserion and the Night King. However, Viserion manages to free himself from the grip of his former dragon brother and disappears with his rider in the dark of the blizzard, leaving Jon and Daenerys lost on their dragons in the middle of the storm, and hearing all around them the threatening choes of Viserion, lurking all around them but without them being able to see it.<br>******** <br>In the crypts of Winterfell, fear and silence dominate. Mothers try as much as they can to reassure their terrified children, as does Gilly with Little Sam. Varys, sitting against a wall, remains pensive, dark, sometimes listening to what\u2019s going on. Sansa and Missandei also wait without saying anything. Tyrion himself rummages inward and paces, taking a sip of his bottle of wine. Sansa watches him, saying nothing.<br>_ \u201cIf only we were up there, we could see how it evolves \u2026. we could even do something \u2026.\u201d Tyrion muses. Varys sighs and Tyrion hears him, turning to him. \u201cWhat? At the battle of the Nera, I led the troops through the gate \u2026.\u201d said the dwarf.<br>_ \u201cAnd you got face being slashed in two.\u201d Varys reminded him, much to Tyrion\u2019s annoyance.<br>_ \u201cThat\u2019s right, but at least we won \u2026. If I was up there \u2026.\u201d<br>_ \u201cThey would kill you.\u201d Sansa said to Tyrion unceremoniously. \u201cThere is nothing we can do.\u201d<br>Tyrion, annoyed, drops his wine bottle and gets closer to talk to Sansa.<br>_ \u201cYou would be surprised at things I could do to not join the army of the dead.\u201d<br>_ \u201cYour remarks would not make any difference, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here \u2026 Because we can not do anything. The most heroic thing we can do now is \u2026. look at the truth in the face.\u201d Sansa adds. Tyrion listens to it, recognizing that she may mark a point.<br>_ \u201cMaybe we should have stayed married.\u201d said Tyrion, taking another sip. Sansa smiles slightly and responds.<br>_ \u201cYou were the best of them \u2026 but it would not work between us \u2026\u201d<br>_\u201cWhy not?\u201d asks Tyrion, puzzled. Sansa then announces his answer immediately.<br>_ \u201cThe Queen of Dragons \u2026. your loyalty to her would become a problem.\u201d<br>_\u201cYes,\u201d Missandei suddenly replied, somberly, towards Sansa. \u201cIf the queen of dragons were not there, there would be no more trouble \u2026 we would all be dead already.\u201d With these words, Missandei moves away, leaving Sansa, Tyrion and Varys, silent and thoughtful. Suddenly, the doors of the crypt open, surprising everyone, but the tensions subside a little when Samwell Tarly arrives, but alive, to the great relief of Gilly who comes to hug him with love.<br>_\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Tyrion asks for this step. The fearful face of Sam makes him fear the worst, like all in the crypt.<br>_\u201cWe \u2026 we have been defeated. The dead have reached the walls.\u201d<br>Faced with this news, the fear is gaining a little more inhabitants. Gilly takes Little Sam in her arms and tries to comfort him. Varys and Missandei exchange a really worried look, as do Sansa and Tyrion.<br>_ \u201cIs there not a way for women and children to get out of this crypt, is there another way out?\u201d Tyrion asks Sansa. The young lady of Winterfell, despite the stress, thinks and remembers some stories told by her parents about the age of the crypts and the many secret passages it can conceal.<br>**********<br>On the ramparts, all prepare for defense. The wights, in endless hordes, crash against the gates and the ramparts, climbing one another, forming noisy and massive mounds to reach the top of the walls of the city. The archers, Davos and Arya shoot a lot of arrows and shoot down dozens of creatures, but their numbers keep growing. At the top of the ramparts, Brienne, Tormund, Sandor, Beric, Jaime, Gendry and Podrick are preparing for the arrival of the first creatures. In the courtyard, Lyanna and Jorah Mormont, leading the rest of the surviving soldiers, are preparing for the brutal entrance of the dead by the city gate, which is already shaking under the numerous hammering of the living corpses. From the rear of the battlefield and out of reach of archery fire, the twelve white walkers, lined up and armed, contemplate the army of the dead assaulting the city.<br>**********<br>In the sacred wood, Theon, Alys and the Ironborn soldiers formed a real circle of protection around the big tree at the foot of which is Bran, neutral and impassive. Theon shows deep concern about the progress of the battle.<br>_ \u201cThey have reached the ramparts \u2026.\u201d said the young ironborn prince. Bran nods without saying a word. Theon goes to him to talk to him. \u201cBran \u2026. I wanted to tell you that everything I did \u2026.\u201d<br>_ \u201cEverything you did led you to where you should be today \u2026. home.\u201d Bran interrupted Theon, without showing any animosity towards him. Theon seems moved by the young man\u2019s words. \u201cNow forgive me, but I must leave you.\u201d<br>_\u201cWhat?\u201d asks Theon, perplexed. Bran does not answer and turns to the tree, puts his hand on it, near the face engraved in the bark. Bran\u2019s eyes flinch, turning white and milky, and the young man plunges into another trance, seeming to look deep into the memories of this ancestral tree.<br>******** <br>The wights eventually reached the heights of the walls. If Arya, Sandor, Beric, Gendry, Brienne, Tormund, Jaime and Podrick manage to repel the firsts on their arrival, very quickly, the first defenders are swept by the blades of the dead and they land in the precincts of the city. The archers and Davos find themselves also having to fight for their survival. Despite their former rivalry, Sandor and Brienne help each other against the wights that attack them, forming an effective and devastating duo. Jaime is overwhelmed by three dead but Brienne intervenes and saves it. With his fiery sword, Beric sets a dead man on fire and lets him fall on others, who in turn burn themselves. Using her faceless man talents, Arya quickly reveals herself to be formidable, with rapid movements and precise attacks with daggers and spears, managing to repel several wights alone. She even saves Gendry\u2019s life by piercing the skull of the zombie that had stuck him against a wall and threatened to tear his face to death.<br>But despite all these efforts, the first dead have already sprung up in Winterfell\u2019s courtyard. The gates finally give way when a giant shatters the wood and makes the doors fall violently, behind him hordes of wights spilling in groups into the city. Lyanna, Jorah, and the defenders of the court find themselves fighting, too, with the energy of despair. Unfortunately, the giant charges and strikes violently around him. Lyanna is unfortunately hit by a blow and falls to the side. In the bitter struggle, Brienne grabs Podrick by the shoulder.<br>_\u201cGo to the crypts, tell them that the defenses are pierced and that they must flee!\u201d<br>Podrick wants to insist on not giving up Brienne, but she pushes him backwards so that he leaves, while two wights jump on her. Podrick begins to run reluctantly and tears to the eye, seeing Brienne stay behind and repel the two creatures fiercely with the intervention of Tormund and Jaime. Arya and the other defenders, despite their resistance, are forced back and down to the yard. Seeing that the defenses of the ramparts were repulsed, the twelve white walkers advanced, standing now just in front of the gates of the city, watching with their ice eyes.<br>********* <br>In the sky covered by the blizzard, Daenerys and Jon manage to stay together with their dragons, but still under the invisible and omnipresent threat of the Night King, who almost seems to play with their nerves.<br>Suddenly, Viserion appeared from behind, attacking Rhaegal with his teeth and scratching his chest deeply. Jon clings as best he can to keep from falling out of the dragon and the two flying creatures stomp on each other. Daenerys on Drogon sees it and immediately rushes to Jon\u2019s rescue. She thinks to spit the flames of Drogon but changed her mind very quickly, she will not take the risk of touching Jon and Rhaegal. On the back of Viserion, The Night King drew his sword of ice, and Jon, seeing him do, draws Long Claw. In aerial combat, Viserion manages to grab Rhaegal\u2019s neck and bites him deeply. That\u2019s when Daenerys and Drogon arrive at full speed, violently striking Viserion, and disarming the Night King who falls into the void, disappearing into the blizzard. Having seen it fall, Jon manages to move a little Rhaegal, very hurt, while Drogon, bigger, in turn persecutes Viserion.<br>_ \u201cGO ON!! KILL HIM!!\u201d Daenerys yells at Jon, mentioning the Night King. The latter having fallen from his terrible mount, he was now more vulnerable. Jon seizes the opportunity and trusts Daenerys and Drogon, though reluctant for a moment to leave them, he finally leads Rhaegal to the ground, while Daenerys and Drogon continue the aerial fight against the fallen dragon. But curiously, after a few bites and scratches, Viserion manages to free himself from the fight and Daenerys does not understand why, seeing him flying away and disappeaing in the blizzard, without her being able to catch him up.<br>********* <br>In the courtyard and in the city, the dead are pouring in hundreds and the carnage continues. Although wounded by the giant, Lyanna Mormont manages to get up, armed with her ax and rushes, screaming to the giant who continues to hit and crush all the men who come within reach. The giant seesher, seizes her in his hand and begins to compress the girl in her armor. Spitting blood and feeling death come, Lyanna, in a last gesture, pierces the eye of the giant with her dragonglass dagger, killing him instantly. The giant collapses into a heap of inert bones, and Lyanna falling beside him, dead. Harassed by wights, Jorah caught a glimpse of the scene, desperate.<br>_ \u201cLYANNA!!\u201d he screams while managing to repel an undead.<br>******** <br>In the crypts, all begin to hear the muffled sounds of fighting noises and screams approaching each other little by little. Samwell alongside Gilly and their son, Varys and Missandei, Tyrion and Sansa, all are not reassured. The sudden arrival of Podrick, also wounded and in panic, is not to reassure them.<br>_ \u201cThe \u2026. The defenses are pierced! The city is invaded!\u201d the young squire blows to the end. Tyrion reassures him as he can and forces him to take a few seconds of breath. Given the gravity of the situation, Sansa makes a decision and turns to Varys and Missandei, having successfully remembered the location of the secret tunnel in the crypt.<br>_ \u201cHave everyone evacuate, let everyone follow me, we will take the passage leading out of the city.\u201d<br>_ \u201cMy lady, are you sure?\u201d Varys asked. But suddenly, the violent drumming of dead against the barricaded doors of the crypts leaves no place for hesitation.<br>_\u201cThey are here!\u201d Exclaims Gilly with fear.<br>_ \u201cLet\u2019s go, come on!!\u201d insisted Tyrion in agreement with Sansa. All in the crypts are busy getting up and following the lady of Winterfell passing in front and lighting a torch to guide them in the dark.<br>******** <br>In Winterfell, the dead continue to spread throughout the city, devastating and slaughtering everything in their path without distinction. Brienne, Jaime, Tormund and Gendry continue to fight with determination, despite the physical exhaustion and the unstoppable advance of the dead on them. Sandor, in front of the fire and the chaos, remains paralyzed in a corner, breathing noisily and blood covering his face. Beric, while fighting, tries to bring him back to reality.<br>_ \u201cCLEGANE! CLEGANE! It\u2019s not the moment! We need you!\u201d<br>_\u201cFuck off! You don\u2019t understand, you moron? We can\u2019t beat them Death is in front, and we can do nothing against her!\u201d<br>Beric then hears Arya and sees her scramble like a devil against the wights and manage to drop several from the heights of the walls. Despite a visible injury to the head, the young Stark girl continues to fight.<br>_ \u201cGo tell that to her!\u201d says Beric, pointing her to Sandor. The latter, seeing her doing and surrounded by more and more wights, reacts and rushes to her aid, followed by Beric. But suddenly, they stop abruptly their advance. Four white walkers appear, passing the gates of Winterfell in a slow but steady march, and immediately put their blue eyes on them. Beric takes a stand with his fiery sword, as does Sandor with his ax. Two of the white walkers grab their ice lances and advance towards them. The fight begins, Beric and Sandor finding themselves fighting a walker each and having to avoid their powerful blows. Two other white walkers advance towards Brienne and Jaime, who side by side, decide to face the ice creatures and start the fight too. Unfortunately, Beric is in trouble against the walker and is pushed back. Jorah intervenes to help him and also faces the monster. Sandor, too, despite his talent as a warrior, is hit violently and pushed back. All of a sudden, Arya comes up from behind and clings to the back of the walker, trying to stab him with her dagger. But the walker reacts immediately, stopping the young woman\u2019s wrist and throwing her over his shoulder. Arya rolls on the ground and immediatly rise with her agility, dagger in hand, and standing between Sandor and the white walker, her concentrated face and a dark look. Arya tries a new attack, but the walker is fast and blocks it, hitting her again and sending her to the ground. Sandor intervenes to help her, but the walker pushes him too, even hurting him on the shoulder with his blade of ice. As Sandor recoils, hurt, Arya takes advantage of the diversion to jump and push her dagger into the white walker\u2019s neck, paralyzing him instantly and reducing him into thousands of fragments of ice that collapse on the ground.<br>Brienne is struggling with one of the white walkers, but having to back down against the powerful attacks of the monster. Jaime wants to help, but is cornered by another. While Brienne is going to receive a blow, Tormund comes screaming like a ferocious beast, throwing his whole body against the walker to destabilize him and makes him fall to the ground.<br>_ \u201cGO!\u201d Tormund screams at Brienne and Jaime while trying to restrain the walker, who with a violent setback pushes Tormund away from him. The wildling chief is sounded on the ground, but regains his senses and with great sword blows, attacks relentlessly the walker forced to parry the blows. But the walker manages to disarm him, cutting Tormund\u2019s hand in the process, then stab him in the chest. Flowing blood, Tormund, frozen in pain but clenching his teeth, retains the blade of ice in his flesh with his only hand, and gives a last look at Brienne, who can not help but be horrified by the sacrifice of the wildling. Jaime manages to avoid a blow of the walker and grabs Brienne by the wrist to force her to follow him.<br>_ \u201cFor the northn, you motherfucker \u2026.\u201d Tormund addresses the walker, spitting at him. The white walker remains impassive and lets Tormund fall back, which collapses into a pool of blood, his lifeless gaze fixed towards the sky. Everywhere else, Arya, Gendry, Davos, Sandor, Beric, Jorah and Ghost are also forced to retreat to the crypts, whose doors were, to their astonishment, destroyed. Already, surviving soldiers begin to rush in to escape.<br>_ \u201cEveryone in the crypts!\u201d yells Arya to the others while protecting the retreat, she too being aware of the secret underground leading outside the walls of the city. Gendry, Davos, Sandor, Beric, Brienne, Jorah and Jaime remain with her to defend the positions with other troops against the advance of the dead towards them. Then, Jorah manages to make his way and starts running towards the sacred wood.<br>_ \u201cSer Jorah! Where are you going ?!\u201d yells Jaime while fighting.<br>_ \u201cI\u2019m going to get Bran and the others, do not wait for me!\u201d he replied, running towards the sacred wood and also attracting a maximum of wights on him.<br>********* <br>Outside the walls, Jon and Rhaegal manage to emerge from the blizzard to find themselves a few meters above the ground. Jon can contemplate with horror the field of battle covered with a sea of \u200b\u200bcorpses and farther away, Winterfell in flames and besieging on all sides by the dead. Then he saw him \u2026. Standing in the middle of the battlefield, the Night King stands there, standing, impassive, and almost seems to be waiting for him. For Jon, this is the opportunity.<br>Jon makes Rhaegal spit fire, with all his strength, and the torrent of flames covers the Night King, who did not try to avoid it. A few seconds pass and with astonishment, Jon sees the Night King emerging from the flames, unharmed, and addressing to him what looks almost like a smirk. Suddenly, Viserion rises again from the mist, at great speed, and hits Rhaegal with full force. Jon is unhinged instantly and falls from several meters into the snow, still dampening his fall. The two dragons begin a fight almost on the ground, violent and fierce. Jon, dizzy, manages to get back on his feet, in the middle of the field of snow and corpses, and a hundred yards away from him, the Night King facing him. Jon picks up Long Claw who has fallen beside him and is ready to fight. But the young man is horrified at the sight of three white walkers arriving and standing behind the Night King. The latter, seeing in Jon\u2019s gesture a challenge, seems to have ordered the others to stay behind and walks alone toward Jon, unsheathing his blade of ice, amid the ashes and smoke. Jon, both hands firmly on Long Claw\u2019s, stands ready and dodges the Night King\u2019s first attack by rolling on the side. The duel starts.</p>",

If I was up there \u2026.\u201d<br>_ \u201cThey would kill you.\u201d Sansa said to Tyrion unceremoniously. \u201cThere is nothing we can do.\u201d<br>Tyrion, annoyed, drops his wine bottle and gets closer to talk to Sansa.<br>_ \u201cYou would be surprised at things I could do to not join the army of the dead.\u201d<br>_ \u201cYour remarks would not make any difference, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here \u2026 Because we can not do anything. The most heroic thing we can do now is \u2026. look at the truth in the face.\u201d Sansa adds. Tyrion listens to it, recognizing that she may mark a point.<br>_ \u201cMaybe we should have stayed married.\u201d said Tyrion, taking another sip. Sansa smiles slightly and responds.<br>_ \u201cYou were the best of them \u2026 but it would not work between us \u2026\u201d<br>_\u201cWhy not?\u201d asks Tyrion, puzzled. Sansa then announces his answer immediately.<br>_ \u201cThe Queen of Dragons \u2026. your loyalty to her would become a problem.\u201d<br>_\u201cYes,\u201d Missandei suddenly replied, somberly, towards Sansa. \u201cIf the queen of dragons were not there, there would be no more trouble \u2026 we would all be dead already.\u201d With these words, Missandei moves away, leaving Sansa, Tyrion and Varys, silent and thoughtful. Suddenly, the doors of the crypt open, surprising everyone, but the tensions subside a little when Samwell Tarly arrives, but alive, to the great relief of Gilly who comes to hug him with love.<br>_\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Tyrion asks for this step. The fearful face of Sam makes him fear the worst, like all in the crypt.<br>_\u201cWe \u2026 we have been defeated. The dead have reached the walls.\u201d<br>Faced with this news, the fear is gaining a little more inhabitants. Gilly takes Little Sam in her arms and tries to comfort him. Varys and Missandei exchange a really worried look, as do Sansa and Tyrion.<br>_ \u201cIs there not a way for women and children to get out of this crypt, is there another way out?\u201d Tyrion asks Sansa. The young lady of Winterfell, despite the stress, thinks and remembers some stories told by her parents about the age of the crypts and the many secret passages it can conceal.<br>**********<br>On the ramparts, all prepare for defense. The wights, in endless hordes, crash against the gates and the ramparts, climbing one another, forming noisy and massive mounds to reach the top of the walls of the city. The archers, Davos and Arya shoot a lot of arrows and shoot down dozens of creatures, but their numbers keep growing. At the top of the ramparts, Brienne, Tormund, Sandor, Beric, Jaime, Gendry and Podrick are preparing for the arrival of the first creatures. In the courtyard, Lyanna and Jorah Mormont, leading the rest of the surviving soldiers, are preparing for the brutal entrance of the dead by the city gate, which is already shaking under the numerous hammering of the living corpses. From the rear of the battlefield and out of reach of archery fire, the twelve white walkers, lined up and armed, contemplate the army of the dead assaulting the city.<br>**********<br>In the sacred wood, Theon, Alys and the Ironborn soldiers formed a real circle of protection around the big tree at the foot of which is Bran, neutral and impassive. Theon shows deep concern about the progress of the battle.<br>_ \u201cThey have reached the ramparts \u2026.\u201d said the young ironborn prince. Bran nods without saying a word. Theon goes to him to talk to him. \u201cBran \u2026. I wanted to tell you that everything I did \u2026.\u201d<br>_ \u201cEverything you did led you to where you should be today \u2026. home.\u201d Bran interrupted Theon, without showing any animosity towards him. Theon seems moved by the young man\u2019s words. \u201cNow forgive me, but I must leave you.\u201d<br>_\u201cWhat?\u201d asks Theon, perplexed. Bran does not answer and turns to the tree, puts his hand on it, near the face engraved in the bark. Bran\u2019s eyes flinch, turning white and milky, and the young man plunges into another trance, seeming to look deep into the memories of this ancestral tree.<br>******** <br>The wights eventually reached the heights of the walls. If Arya, Sandor, Beric, Gendry, Brienne, Tormund, Jaime and Podrick manage to repel the firsts on their arrival, very quickly, the first defenders are swept by the blades of the dead and they land in the precincts of the city. The archers and Davos find themselves also having to fight for their survival. Despite their former rivalry, Sandor and Brienne help each other against the wights that attack them, forming an effective and devastating duo. Jaime is overwhelmed by three dead but Brienne intervenes and saves it. With his fiery sword, Beric sets a dead man on fire and lets him fall on others, who in turn burn themselves. Using her faceless man talents, Arya quickly reveals herself to be formidable, with rapid movements and precise attacks with daggers and spears, managing to repel several wights alone. She even saves Gendry\u2019s life by piercing the skull of the zombie that had stuck him against a wall and threatened to tear his face to death.<br>But despite all these efforts, the first dead have already sprung up in Winterfell\u2019s courtyard. The gates finally give way when a giant shatters the wood and makes the doors fall violently, behind him hordes of wights spilling in groups into the city. Lyanna, Jorah, and the defenders of the court find themselves fighting, too, with the energy of despair. Unfortunately, the giant charges and strikes violently around him. Lyanna is unfortunately hit by a blow and falls to the side. In the bitter struggle, Brienne grabs Podrick by the shoulder.<br>_\u201cGo to the crypts, tell them that the defenses are pierced and that they must flee!\u201d<br>Podrick wants to insist on not giving up Brienne, but she pushes him backwards so that he leaves, while two wights jump on her. Podrick begins to run reluctantly and tears to the eye, seeing Brienne stay behind and repel the two creatures fiercely with the intervention of Tormund and Jaime. Arya and the other defenders, despite their resistance, are forced back and down to the yard. Seeing that the defenses of the ramparts were repulsed, the twelve white walkers advanced, standing now just in front of the gates of the city, watching with their ice eyes.<br>********* <br>In the sky covered by the blizzard, Daenerys and Jon manage to stay together with their dragons, but still under the invisible and omnipresent threat of the Night King, who almost seems to play with their nerves.<br>Suddenly, Viserion appeared from behind, attacking Rhaegal with his teeth and scratching his chest deeply. Jon clings as best he can to keep from falling out of the dragon and the two flying creatures stomp on each other. Daenerys on Drogon sees it and immediately rushes to Jon\u2019s rescue. She thinks to spit the flames of Drogon but changed her mind very quickly, she will not take the risk of touching Jon and Rhaegal. On the back of Viserion, The Night King drew his sword of ice, and Jon, seeing him do, draws Long Claw. In aerial combat, Viserion manages to grab Rhaegal\u2019s neck and bites him deeply. That\u2019s when Daenerys and Drogon arrive at full speed, violently striking Viserion, and disarming the Night King who falls into the void, disappearing into the blizzard. Having seen it fall, Jon manages to move a little Rhaegal, very hurt, while Drogon, bigger, in turn persecutes Viserion.<br>_ \u201cGO ON!! KILL HIM!!\u201d Daenerys yells at Jon, mentioning the Night King. The latter having fallen from his terrible mount, he was now more vulnerable. Jon seizes the opportunity and trusts Daenerys and Drogon, though reluctant for a moment to leave them, he finally leads Rhaegal to the ground, while Daenerys and Drogon continue the aerial fight against the fallen dragon. But curiously, after a few bites and scratches, Viserion manages to free himself from the fight and Daenerys does not understand why, seeing him flying away and disappeaing in the blizzard, without her being able to catch him up.<br>********* <br>In the courtyard and in the city, the dead are pouring in hundreds and the carnage continues. Although wounded by the giant, Lyanna Mormont manages to get up, armed with her ax and rushes, screaming to the giant who continues to hit and crush all the men who come within reach. The giant seesher, seizes her in his hand and begins to compress the girl in her armor. Spitting blood and feeling death come, Lyanna, in a last gesture, pierces the eye of the giant with her dragonglass dagger, killing him instantly. The giant collapses into a heap of inert bones, and Lyanna falling beside him, dead. Harassed by wights, Jorah caught a glimpse of the scene, desperate.<br>_ \u201cLYANNA!!\u201d he screams while managing to repel an undead.<br>******** <br>In the crypts, all begin to hear the muffled sounds of fighting noises and screams approaching each other little by little. Samwell alongside Gilly and their son, Varys and Missandei, Tyrion and Sansa, all are not reassured. The sudden arrival of Podrick, also wounded and in panic, is not to reassure them.<br>_ \u201cThe \u2026. The defenses are pierced! The city is invaded!\u201d the young squire blows to the end. Tyrion reassures him as he can and forces him to take a few seconds of breath. Given the gravity of the situation, Sansa makes a decision and turns to Varys and Missandei, having successfully remembered the location of the secret tunnel in the crypt.<br>_ \u201cHave everyone evacuate, let everyone follow me, we will take the passage leading out of the city.\u201d<br>_ \u201cMy lady, are you sure?\u201d Varys asked. But suddenly, the violent drumming of dead against the barricaded doors of the crypts leaves no place for hesitation.<br>_\u201cThey are here!\u201d Exclaims Gilly with fear.<br>_ \u201cLet\u2019s go, come on!!\u201d insisted Tyrion in agreement with Sansa. All in the crypts are busy getting up and following the lady of Winterfell passing in front and lighting a torch to guide them in the dark.<br>******** <br>In Winterfell, the dead continue to spread throughout the city, devastating and slaughtering everything in their path without distinction. Brienne, Jaime, Tormund and Gendry continue to fight with determination, despite the physical exhaustion and the unstoppable advance of the dead on them. Sandor, in front of the fire and the chaos, remains paralyzed in a corner, breathing noisily and blood covering his face. Beric, while fighting, tries to bring him back to reality.<br>_ \u201cCLEGANE! CLEGANE! It\u2019s not the moment! We need you!\u201d<br>_\u201cFuck off! You don\u2019t understand, you moron? We can\u2019t beat them Death is in front, and we can do nothing against her!\u201d<br>Beric then hears Arya and sees her scramble like a devil against the wights and manage to drop several from the heights of the walls. Despite a visible injury to the head, the young Stark girl continues to fight.<br>_ \u201cGo tell that to her!\u201d says Beric, pointing her to Sandor. The latter, seeing her doing and surrounded by more and more wights, reacts and rushes to her aid, followed by Beric. But suddenly, they stop abruptly their advance. Four white walkers appear, passing the gates of Winterfell in a slow but steady march, and immediately put their blue eyes on them. Beric takes a stand with his fiery sword, as does Sandor with his ax. Two of the white walkers grab their ice lances and advance towards them. The fight begins, Beric and Sandor finding themselves fighting a walker each and having to avoid their powerful blows. Two other white walkers advance towards Brienne and Jaime, who side by side, decide to face the ice creatures and start the fight too. Unfortunately, Beric is in trouble against the walker and is pushed back. Jorah intervenes to help him and also faces the monster. Sandor, too, despite his talent as a warrior, is hit violently and pushed back. All of a sudden, Arya comes up from behind and clings to the back of the walker, trying to stab him with her dagger. But the walker reacts immediately, stopping the young woman\u2019s wrist and throwing her over his shoulder. Arya rolls on the ground and immediatly rise with her agility, dagger in hand, and standing between Sandor and the white walker, her concentrated face and a dark look. Arya tries a new attack, but the walker is fast and blocks it, hitting her again and sending her to the ground. Sandor intervenes to help her, but the walker pushes him too, even hurting him on the shoulder with his blade of ice. As Sandor recoils, hurt, Arya takes advantage of the diversion to jump and push her dagger into the white walker\u2019s neck, paralyzing him instantly and reducing him into thousands of fragments of ice that collapse on the ground.<br>Brienne is struggling with one of the white walkers, but having to back down against the powerful attacks of the monster. Jaime wants to help, but is cornered by another. While Brienne is going to receive a blow, Tormund comes screaming like a ferocious beast, throwing his whole body against the walker to destabilize him and makes him fall to the ground.<br>_ \u201cGO!\u201d Tormund screams at Brienne and Jaime while trying to restrain the walker, who with a violent setback pushes Tormund away from him. The wildling chief is sounded on the ground, but regains his senses and with great sword blows, attacks relentlessly the walker forced to parry the blows. But the walker manages to disarm him, cutting Tormund\u2019s hand in the process, then stab him in the chest. Flowing blood, Tormund, frozen in pain but clenching his teeth, retains the blade of ice in his flesh with his only hand, and gives a last look at Brienne, who can not help but be horrified by the sacrifice of the wildling. Jaime manages to avoid a blow of the walker and grabs Brienne by the wrist to force her to follow him.<br>_ \u201cFor the northn, you motherfucker \u2026.\u201d Tormund addresses the walker, spitting at him. The white walker remains impassive and lets Tormund fall back, which collapses into a pool of blood, his lifeless gaze fixed towards the sky. Everywhere else, Arya, Gendry, Davos, Sandor, Beric, Jorah and Ghost are also forced to retreat to the crypts, whose doors were, to their astonishment, destroyed. Already, surviving soldiers begin to rush in to escape.<br>_ \u201cEveryone in the crypts!\u201d yells Arya to the others while protecting the retreat, she too being aware of the secret underground leading outside the walls of the city. Gendry, Davos, Sandor, Beric, Brienne, Jorah and Jaime remain with her to defend the positions with other troops against the advance of the dead towards them. Then, Jorah manages to make his way and starts running towards the sacred wood.<br>_ \u201cSer Jorah! Where are you going ?!\u201d yells Jaime while fighting.<br>_ \u201cI\u2019m going to get Bran and the others, do not wait for me!\u201d he replied, running towards the sacred wood and also attracting a maximum of wights on him.<br>********* <br>Outside the walls, Jon and Rhaegal manage to emerge from the blizzard to find themselves a few meters above the ground. Jon can contemplate with horror the field of battle covered with a sea of \u200b\u200bcorpses and farther away, Winterfell in flames and besieging on all sides by the dead. Then he saw him \u2026. Standing in the middle of the battlefield, the Night King stands there, standing, impassive, and almost seems to be waiting for him. For Jon, this is the opportunity.<br>Jon makes Rhaegal spit fire, with all his strength, and the torrent of flames covers the Night King, who did not try to avoid it. A few seconds pass and with astonishment, Jon sees the Night King emerging from the flames, unharmed, and addressing to him what looks almost like a smirk. Suddenly, Viserion rises again from the mist, at great speed, and hits Rhaegal with full force. Jon is unhinged instantly and falls from several meters into the snow, still dampening his fall. The two dragons begin a fight almost on the ground, violent and fierce. Jon, dizzy, manages to get back on his feet, in the middle of the field of snow and corpses, and a hundred yards away from him, the Night King facing him. Jon picks up Long Claw who has fallen beside him and is ready to fight. But the young man is horrified at the sight of three white walkers arriving and standing behind the Night King. The latter, seeing in Jon\u2019s gesture a challenge, seems to have ordered the others to stay behind and walks alone toward Jon, unsheathing his blade of ice, amid the ashes and smoke. Jon, both hands firmly on Long Claw\u2019s, stands ready and dodges the Night King\u2019s first attack by rolling on the side. The duel starts.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Jon, on the back of Rhaegal, wandered endlessly through the mashed peas, the icy wind whipping his face. He could see nothing except the night and the fog as far as the eye could see, as if the whole world had been covered in a few seconds. In the dim light, he thought he could distinguish the shape of another dragon, further down. Was it Dany and Drogon?<br />Suddenly, a torrent of intense blue flames was propelled like a geyser toward him, forcing him to do a maneuver to Rhaegal to avoid it. Forced to flee the flames, Rhaegal was flying fast, Jon clutching himself as he could and glancing back. It was him. The Night King was there, perched on the huge blue-eyed Viserion, pursuing him relentlessly and trying to cover him with his endless blue fire. Jon could feel the stinging heat of the flames coming up against his back. The blue fire was getting closer and closer. Animated by the necromantic magic of the king of the dead, Viserion seemed even faster than during his lifetime, and also much stronger.<br />Then, Drogon&rsquo;s imposing and majestic figure rises from the blizzard, roaring loudly, and violently hits Viserion, almost failing to bring down the Night King. Jon, surprised, cast another look. Daenerys, looking more than determined, throws herself with Drogon in the fight. The dance of dragons begins between Drogon and Viserion, the two large reptiles agglomerated to each other and spinning in a deadly dance in the sky, inflicting each other violent claws, bites, and other attacks of extreme savagery. The Night King, sure of himself, looks at Daenerys, and vice versa. The Queen of Dragons, furious and sad to see her child transformed, glares at the Night King. The king of the walkers seized his spear of ice, ready to throw it on the young queen despite the tumult of the two dragons. The Night King throws his spear with force, but Daenerys bends down just in time to see the ice weapon pass right over her and fall into the void. Viserion, indefatigable, closes his jaw on the wing of Drogon, while the latter, in a burst of fury, strongly bites the neck of Viserion. From the back of Rhaegal, Jon observes with apprehension and decides to come to the aid of his queen and goes with his dragon towards the aerial combat. But as he approaches, Viserion releases his hold on Drogon&rsquo;s wing and spits a mighty torrent of blue flames toward Rhaegal, who is brutally hit in the face. Rhaegal, roaring with pain, deviated from his race, Jon tried to force himself hard not to fall and manages to move away Rhaegal and masters it despite his pain. Having seen this, Daenerys, even more furious, continues the fight with Drogon against Viserion and the Night King. However, Viserion manages to free himself from the grip of his former dragon brother and disappears with his rider in the dark of the blizzard, leaving Jon and Daenerys lost on their dragons in the middle of the storm, and hearing all around them the threatening choes of Viserion, lurking all around them but without them being able to see it.<br />******** <br />In the crypts of Winterfell, fear and silence dominate. Mothers try as much as they can to reassure their terrified children, as does Gilly with Little Sam. Varys, sitting against a wall, remains pensive, dark, sometimes listening to what&rsquo;s going on. Sansa and Missandei also wait without saying anything. Tyrion himself rummages inward and paces, taking a sip of his bottle of wine. Sansa watches him, saying nothing.<br />_ &ldquo;If only we were up there, we could see how it evolves &hellip;. we could even do something &hellip;.&rdquo; Tyrion muses. Varys sighs and Tyrion hears him, turning to him. &ldquo;What? At the battle of the Nera, I led the troops through the gate &hellip;.&rdquo; said the dwarf.<br />_ &ldquo;And you got face being slashed in two.&rdquo; Varys reminded him, much to Tyrion&rsquo;s annoyance.<br />_ &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, but at least we won &hellip;. If I was up there &hellip;.&rdquo;<br />_ &ldquo;They would kill you.&rdquo; Sansa said to Tyrion unceremoniously. &ldquo;There is nothing we can do.&rdquo;<br />Tyrion, annoyed, drops his wine bottle and gets closer to talk to Sansa.<br />_ &ldquo;You would be surprised at things I could do to not join the army of the dead.&rdquo;<br />_ &ldquo;Your remarks would not make any difference, that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here &hellip; Because we can not do anything.

Sandor, in front of the fire and the chaos, remains paralyzed in a corner, breathing noisily and blood covering his face. Beric, while fighting, tries to bring him back to reality.<br />_ &ldquo;CLEGANE! CLEGANE! It&rsquo;s not the moment! We need you!&rdquo;<br />_&ldquo;Fuck off! You don&rsquo;t understand, you moron? We can&rsquo;t beat them Death is in front, and we can do nothing against her!&rdquo;<br />Beric then hears Arya and sees her scramble like a devil against the wights and manage to drop several from the heights of the walls. Despite a visible injury to the head, the young Stark girl continues to fight.<br />_ &ldquo;Go tell that to her!&rdquo; says Beric, pointing her to Sandor. The latter, seeing her doing and surrounded by more and more wights, reacts and rushes to her aid, followed by Beric. But suddenly, they stop abruptly their advance. Four white walkers appear, passing the gates of Winterfell in a slow but steady march, and immediately put their blue eyes on them. Beric takes a stand with his fiery sword, as does Sandor with his ax. Two of the white walkers grab their ice lances and advance towards them. The fight begins, Beric and Sandor finding themselves fighting a walker each and having to avoid their powerful blows. Two other white walkers advance towards Brienne and Jaime, who side by side, decide to face the ice creatures and start the fight too. Unfortunately, Beric is in trouble against the walker and is pushed back. Jorah intervenes to help him and also faces the monster. Sandor, too, despite his talent as a warrior, is hit violently and pushed back. All of a sudden, Arya comes up from behind and clings to the back of the walker, trying to stab him with her dagger. But the walker reacts immediately, stopping the young woman&rsquo;s wrist and throwing her over his shoulder. Arya rolls on the ground and immediatly rise with her agility, dagger in hand, and standing between Sandor and the white walker, her concentrated face and a dark look. Arya tries a new attack, but the walker is fast and blocks it, hitting her again and sending her to the ground. Sandor intervenes to help her, but the walker pushes him too, even hurting him on the shoulder with his blade of ice. As Sandor recoils, hurt, Arya takes advantage of the diversion to jump and push her dagger into the white walker&rsquo;s neck, paralyzing him instantly and reducing him into thousands of fragments of ice that collapse on the ground.<br />Brienne is struggling with one of the white walkers, but having to back down against the powerful attacks of the monster. Jaime wants to help, but is cornered by another. While Brienne is going to receive a blow, Tormund comes screaming like a ferocious beast, throwing his whole body against the walker to destabilize him and makes him fall to the ground.<br />_ &ldquo;GO!&rdquo; Tormund screams at Brienne and Jaime while trying to restrain the walker, who with a violent setback pushes Tormund away from him. The wildling chief is sounded on the ground, but regains his senses and with great sword blows, attacks relentlessly the walker forced to parry the blows. But the walker manages to disarm him, cutting Tormund&rsquo;s hand in the process, then stab him in the chest. Flowing blood, Tormund, frozen in pain but clenching his teeth, retains the blade of ice in his flesh with his only hand, and gives a last look at Brienne, who can not help but be horrified by the sacrifice of the wildling. Jaime manages to avoid a blow of the walker and grabs Brienne by the wrist to force her to follow him.<br />_ &ldquo;For the northn, you motherfucker &hellip;.&rdquo; Tormund addresses the walker, spitting at him. The white walker remains impassive and lets Tormund fall back, which collapses into a pool of blood, his lifeless gaze fixed towards the sky. Everywhere else, Arya, Gendry, Davos, Sandor, Beric, Jorah and Ghost are also forced to retreat to the crypts, whose doors were, to their astonishment, destroyed. Already, surviving soldiers begin to rush in to escape.<br />_ &ldquo;Everyone in the crypts!&rdquo; yells Arya to the others while protecting the retreat, she too being aware of the secret underground leading outside the walls of the city. Gendry, Davos, Sandor, Beric, Brienne, Jorah and Jaime remain with her to defend the positions with other troops against the advance of the dead towards them. Then, Jorah manages to make his way and starts running towards the sacred wood.<br />_ &ldquo;Ser Jorah! Where are you going ?!&rdquo; yells Jaime while fighting.<br />_ &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get Bran and the others, do not wait for me!&rdquo; he replied, running towards the sacred wood and also attracting a maximum of wights on him.<br />********* <br />Outside the walls, Jon and Rhaegal manage to emerge from the blizzard to find themselves a few meters above the ground. Jon can contemplate with horror the field of battle covered with a sea of &#8203;&#8203;corpses and farther away, Winterfell in flames and besieging on all sides by the dead. Then he saw him &hellip;. Standing in the middle of the battlefield, the Night King stands there, standing, impassive, and almost seems to be waiting for him. For Jon, this is the opportunity.<br />Jon makes Rhaegal spit fire, with all his strength, and the torrent of flames covers the Night King, who did not try to avoid it. A few seconds pass and with astonishment, Jon sees the Night King emerging from the flames, unharmed, and addressing to him what looks almost like a smirk. Suddenly, Viserion rises again from the mist, at great speed, and hits Rhaegal with full force. Jon is unhinged instantly and falls from several meters into the snow, still dampening his fall. The two dragons begin a fight almost on the ground, violent and fierce. Jon, dizzy, manages to get back on his feet, in the middle of the field of snow and corpses, and a hundred yards away from him, the Night King facing him. Jon picks up Long Claw who has fallen beside him and is ready to fight. But the young man is horrified at the sight of three white walkers arriving and standing behind the Night King. The latter, seeing in Jon&rsquo;s gesture a challenge, seems to have ordered the others to stay behind and walks alone toward Jon, unsheathing his blade of ice, amid the ashes and smoke. Jon, both hands firmly on Long Claw&rsquo;s, stands ready and dodges the Night King&rsquo;s first attack by rolling on the side. The duel starts.</p>",
