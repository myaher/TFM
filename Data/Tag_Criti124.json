        "body": "<p>Shaun Gilmore seems larger-than-life and over the top, but in the glimpses we get of him, he\u2019s also just so complex and amazing and god I love him so much that it was inevitable I\u2019d eventually write 1000+ words of meta about him and why he\u2019s such a cool character.</p><p>So here it goes: Shaun Geddmore is a boy from a tiny town in the desert. His parents are sweet and loving, but perhaps don\u2019t understand him the way he\u2019d like \u2014 they know him as\u00a0\u201cbrave\u201d but don\u2019t believe that he would singlehandedly protect a city. Shaun cryptically suggests that\u00a0it\u2019s \u201ctaken a while\u201d for them to be proud of him. At some point in his young adulthood, he has a boyfriend (as shown by the letters under his bed), but this does nothing to deter him from leaving as \u201csoon as [he] had the opportunity to leave,\u201d called to the big cities of Tal\u2019dorei.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>At some point, before or after he leaves, he discovers his strange powers, finding runes appearing on his skin and fantastic power running through his veins. We have no idea where he learns what this rare condition means, or how he learns to keep it carefully hidden even while making his livelihood from his arcane powers. Presumably, it\u2019s around the same time where he learned the basics of his craft, including how to fight.\u00a0</p><p>Regardless, though, Shaun leaves\u00a0for a different continent. A big city, with different languages spoken on the streets, with people of much lighter skin than him, and so much colder than his homeland. He changes his name to fit in, and opens up his shop. And he loves it \u2014 seems to love flirting with his clients and making money. Single items probably sell for more than his parents made in their entire lives. And maybe he forgets his parents a little; we know that he barely comes to visit, despite the ease at which he could teleport there. Maybe it\u2019s hard to find the time or the energy when he works so hard. Maybe he finds the difference between his life in Emon and his life back in Shandal too jolting; they wouldn\u2019t understand what he does or why it makes him so happy. Maybe he wants to live in the moment and visiting home feels like returning to his past.\u00a0</p><p>Because if nothing else, Shaun takes life as it comes. He sees Emon destroyed \u2014 this beautiful town where he\u2019s started a life he couldn\u2019t have imagined as a child \u2014 and he immediately fights, taking on a one-on-one dragon just to rescue people, stumbling back to his shop, his beautiful shop reduced to rubble, with Salda and her children in tow. He spends months in Whitestone single-handedly maintaining the barrier in a state of half-exhaustion, and still fights alongside Vox Machina to defeat Thordak.\u00a0</p><p>All this time, he watches Vax, the man with whom he\u2019s flirted, who kissed him once, who said they couldn\u2019t be together, struggle with mortality and fear and the uncertainty of his new love. And Shaun supports him and loves him and helps him discover his wings so that he might fly away from him. He does it all with a smile and a laugh because\u00a0\u201cthe heart wants what it wants,\u201d because of his endless belief that life will be okay. Vox Machina will kill the dragons, they\u2019ll come back, he\u2019ll set up shop again, and they\u2019ll keep &ldquo;pimping out [his] name.\u201d He refuses to let Vax leave his side before the Thordak fight without a\u00a0\u201ctil next time\u201d and even at the campaign\u2019s end, when we see him in 113, he\u2019s still reassuring Vax that\u00a0\u201cit\u2019ll be an honour knowing you still.\u201d</p><p>And certainly, some of this optimism is a mask, a refusal to acknowledge or admit his own feelings. Shaun values his appearance, both physically in his dress and makeup, and emotionally in his semblance of optimism, control, and happiness. He doesn\u2019t let many people close to him; Matt jokes, when we first see Gilmore on-stream, that \u201cno one\u2019s on a first-name basis with Gilmore,\u201d and, true to this, it takes dozens of episodes for Vox Machina to start calling him Shaun. Within minutes of Pike bringing him back from the brink of death after he fights Thordak, he attempts to cast Prestidigitation to clean himself up; he does the same after learning of Vax\u2019s death in the Search for Grog. Throughout the Chroma Conclave arc, he adamantly denies his exhaustion, despite the worries of his friends. He only jokes that he wants the &quot;dragon business\u201d to end so that he can return to his shop, that he\u2019s been keeping a tab for how much Vox Machina owes him.</p><p>This is another mask he seems to put on, that of a hardnosed shopkeeper who puts money over sentimentality. But a shopkeeper like that wouldn\u2019t sponsor a &quot;bunch of bumblefucks\u201d who constantly forget their promise to advertise his brand, or let them haggle him down in prices just because he finds Vax pretty.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019d go so far to say that in the background of Vox Machina\u2019s adventures is a small character arc in which Shaun acknowledges that he loves helping people.\u00a0Despite his bravery in the initial dragon attack, he doesn\u2019t admit how altruistic he was; in response to Vax\u2019s praise, he responds only \u201cI could have saved more.\u201d It takes his service towards Whitestone to acknowledge that it\u00a0\u201cfeels nice to be helping others\u201d; he explains:\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s been a long time since I put my energy and talents towards anything beyond making shiny things.\u201d His appearance in the Search for Grog provides a sort of conclusion of this arc. Vox Machina find Shaun using his magic to provide entertainment for children, to help people who\u00a0\u201chave lost far more\u201d than him.

            "comment": "<p>Shaun Gilmore seems larger-than-life and over the top, but in the glimpses we get of him, he\u2019s also just so complex and amazing and god I love him so much that it was inevitable I\u2019d eventually write 1000+ words of meta about him and why he\u2019s such a cool character.</p><p>So here it goes: Shaun Geddmore is a boy from a tiny town in the desert. His parents are sweet and loving, but perhaps don\u2019t understand him the way he\u2019d like \u2014 they know him as\u00a0\u201cbrave\u201d but don\u2019t believe that he would singlehandedly protect a city. Shaun cryptically suggests that\u00a0it\u2019s \u201ctaken a while\u201d for them to be proud of him. At some point in his young adulthood, he has a boyfriend (as shown by the letters under his bed), but this does nothing to deter him from leaving as \u201csoon as [he] had the opportunity to leave,\u201d called to the big cities of Tal\u2019dorei.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>At some point, before or after he leaves, he discovers his strange powers, finding runes appearing on his skin and fantastic power running through his veins. We have no idea where he learns what this rare condition means, or how he learns to keep it carefully hidden even while making his livelihood from his arcane powers. Presumably, it\u2019s around the same time where he learned the basics of his craft, including how to fight.\u00a0</p><p>Regardless, though, Shaun leaves\u00a0for a different continent. A big city, with different languages spoken on the streets, with people of much lighter skin than him, and so much colder than his homeland. He changes his name to fit in, and opens up his shop. And he loves it \u2014 seems to love flirting with his clients and making money. Single items probably sell for more than his parents made in their entire lives. And maybe he forgets his parents a little; we know that he barely comes to visit, despite the ease at which he could teleport there. Maybe it\u2019s hard to find the time or the energy when he works so hard. Maybe he finds the difference between his life in Emon and his life back in Shandal too jolting; they wouldn\u2019t understand what he does or why it makes him so happy. Maybe he wants to live in the moment and visiting home feels like returning to his past.\u00a0</p><p>Because if nothing else, Shaun takes life as it comes. He sees Emon destroyed \u2014 this beautiful town where he\u2019s started a life he couldn\u2019t have imagined as a child \u2014 and he immediately fights, taking on a one-on-one dragon just to rescue people, stumbling back to his shop, his beautiful shop reduced to rubble, with Salda and her children in tow. He spends months in Whitestone single-handedly maintaining the barrier in a state of half-exhaustion, and still fights alongside Vox Machina to defeat Thordak.\u00a0</p><p>All this time, he watches Vax, the man with whom he\u2019s flirted, who kissed him once, who said they couldn\u2019t be together, struggle with mortality and fear and the uncertainty of his new love. And Shaun supports him and loves him and helps him discover his wings so that he might fly away from him. He does it all with a smile and a laugh because\u00a0\u201cthe heart wants what it wants,\u201d because of his endless belief that life will be okay. Vox Machina will kill the dragons, they\u2019ll come back, he\u2019ll set up shop again, and they\u2019ll keep \u201cpimping out [his] name.\u201d He refuses to let Vax leave his side before the Thordak fight without a\u00a0\u201ctil next time\u201d and even at the campaign\u2019s end, when we see him in 113, he\u2019s still reassuring Vax that\u00a0\u201cit\u2019ll be an honour knowing you still.\u201d</p><p>And certainly, some of this optimism is a mask, a refusal to acknowledge or admit his own feelings. Shaun values his appearance, both physically in his dress and makeup, and emotionally in his semblance of optimism, control, and happiness. He doesn\u2019t let many people close to him; Matt jokes, when we first see Gilmore on-stream, that \u201cno one\u2019s on a first-name basis with Gilmore,\u201d and, true to this, it takes dozens of episodes for Vox Machina to start calling him Shaun. Within minutes of Pike bringing him back from the brink of death after he fights Thordak, he attempts to cast Prestidigitation to clean himself up; he does the same after learning of Vax\u2019s death in the Search for Grog. Throughout the Chroma Conclave arc, he adamantly denies his exhaustion, despite the worries of his friends. He only jokes that he wants the \"dragon business\u201d to end so that he can return to his shop, that he\u2019s been keeping a tab for how much Vox Machina owes him.</p><p>This is another mask he seems to put on, that of a hardnosed shopkeeper who puts money over sentimentality. But a shopkeeper like that wouldn\u2019t sponsor a \"bunch of bumblefucks\u201d who constantly forget their promise to advertise his brand, or let them haggle him down in prices just because he finds Vax pretty.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019d go so far to say that in the background of Vox Machina\u2019s adventures is a small character arc in which Shaun acknowledges that he loves helping people.\u00a0Despite his bravery in the initial dragon attack, he doesn\u2019t admit how altruistic he was; in response to Vax\u2019s praise, he responds only \u201cI could have saved more.\u201d It takes his service towards Whitestone to acknowledge that it\u00a0\u201cfeels nice to be helping others\u201d; he explains:\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s been a long time since I put my energy and talents towards anything beyond making shiny things.\u201d His appearance in the Search for Grog provides a sort of conclusion of this arc. Vox Machina find Shaun using his magic to provide entertainment for children, to help people who\u00a0\u201chave lost far more\u201d than him. And even if he still hides his grief (he has\u00a0\u201can audience to perform for,\u201d after all), his open desire to help others, to travel even further than Tal\u2019dorei to take care of people who are suffering, to use his endless charm for unabashed good \u2014 that shows real growth in character.</p><p>Anyways, that\u2019s why I love him.
