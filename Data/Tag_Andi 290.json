Hehe\u2026</p><hr><p><b>Monday</b><br/></p><p>Amber slapped him upside the head, \u201cAre you fucking stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d TJ rubbed at the spot she had just bruised him. Though he probably deserved that.</p><p>\u201cCyrus Goodman is a good boy TJ! I will not tolerate my dumbass brother causing unnecessary drama!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s a good guy,\u201d TJ muttered, crossing his arms defensively, \u201cWhich is why I have to stay away from him.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Amber threw her arms up, exasperated, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes boys Amber!\u201d TJ cried out. He has been avoiding Cyrus ever since he told him the previous day in a heart wrenching confession. TJ didn\u2019t return any of his calls and actually did a 180 when he saw Cyrus walking down the sidewalk. He wasn\u2019t being very subtle, and TJ knew that.</p><p>Amber glared at her brother, \u201cIs that a problem TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d TJ said in a duh voice, \u201cBut probably not in the way you\u2019re thinking. I\u2019m not a one of those stupid homophobes Ams.\u201d</p><p>His sister was extremely tempted to slap him again, \u201cWell you could have fooled me! Cyrus is basically crying his eyes out cause he thinks you hate him now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d TJ didn\u2019t mean for that to happen. He just couldn\u2019t handle knowing that Cyrus liked boys because\u2026 well because that meant that he had a chance. Well, he didn\u2019t really have a chance because Cyrus was so pure and amazing and beautiful. And he deserved the world. He deserved someone equally as great. Someone who he didn\u2019t have to wait for to become even a slightly decent person. Someone who wasn\u2019t TJ. He couldn\u2019t stand to be around Cyrus because his heart hurt knowing they could be a possibility that would never become a reality. And until he was over his own dumb heartbreak, he couldn\u2019t face Cyrus. That\u2019s another thing that he was that Cyrus didn\u2019t need in a boyfriend, selfish.</p><p>Amber sighed, patting her brother on the shoulder, \u201cYeah. He\u2019s really upset. Broke down in his milkshake this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for that to happen,\u201d TJ\u2019s voice was smaller than Amber had ever heard it before, and that included the times that their parents had yelled at them for hours on end about useless things just to take out some of their pent up anger, \u201cI just\u2026 I can\u2019t see him right now Ams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d She rubbed his arm soothingly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong then?\u201d</p><p>TJ just continued to stare down at his lap, \u201cI\u2026 I like him a lot.\u201d</p><p>Amber jumped up, smiling, \u201cTJ that\u2019s awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo its not,\u201d TJ scowled, \u201cHe deserves more. I don\u2019t even stand a chance compared to literally everyone else out there.\u201d</p><p>Amber frowned, \u201cTJ Kippen! Do not talk badly about yourself like that! Cyrus would be honored to date someone like you so get your head outta your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really know how to put things delicately don\u2019t ya sis,\u201d TJ offered a small smile, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Amber rolled her eyes and ruffled her brothers head, \u201cYou\u2019re a work in progress TJ, I\u2019ll admit. But progress is still something, and Cyrus is the most patient and understanding person we know. He won\u2019t mind that you\u2019re a little rough around the edges still. And he knows that you\u2019re a good person deep down. Deep, deep, <i>deep</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay I get it Amber,\u201d TJ groaned and pushed her out of his room.</p><p>He sent Cyrus a text later that night that read:</p><p><i>Thank you for telling me. It means a lot. I don\u2019t hate you</i>.</p><p>He\u2019s never been that great with words.</p><p><b>Tuesday</b></p><p>Cyrus contemplated not going to school, but ultimately the need to get a good education for his future won out. At least he knew that TJ didn\u2019t hate him. But that did nothing to explain why he was avoiding him though. Cyrus couldn\u2019t think of why he was being so distant.</p><p>Well that was a lie. Cyrus did have one theory. TJ must have figured out that he had a crush on him and he was trying to figure out how to let him down easily. That was the only explanation. That or TJ was worried that Cyrus would develop a crush on him, but it was already too late for that.</p><p>But if space is what TJ needed, then who was Cyrus to go against his wishes. He would respect TJ\u2019s decision and he would get over this stupid crush so that they could be friends again. </p><p>\u201cI still think you should just talk to him,\u201d Andi rubbed his arm soothingly.</p><p>Buffy slammed a hand on the table, \u201cForget him! TJ isn\u2019t worth it Cyrus. You deserve a friend who doesn\u2019t avoid you because of something like this.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just put his forehead back down on the table. He would just have to avoid all places he knew TJ was likely to show up. He could reroute his entire schedule, right?</p><p><b>Wednesday</b></p><p>TJ hadn\u2019t seen Cyrus all week. He normally bumped into him on his way to math class, when the other boy would give him a thumbs up for encouragement. And he would sometimes see Cyrus at lunch time.

If you thought I hated you before,\u201d She started, backing him up into a locker, \u201cIt is nothing compared to the pure detestation that I have for you now.\u201d</p><p>TJ put his hands up in a surrendering motion, \u201cBuffy. How lovely it is to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the shit TJ!\u201d She sneered, \u201cHow dare you do that to Cyrus? After everything he did for you? \u00a0He was being open with you, and now that you know he\u2019s,\u201d She looked around to make sure no one was listening, \u201cNow that you know he\u2019s gay you avoid him? It\u2019s so typical! You probably think Cyrus likes you, right? It would be just like you and your ego to think so highly of yourself like that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy Driscoll?\u201d TJ could help but snap back with the same amount of venom, \u201cWhy would I ever think he would like someone like me?

Are you only smart when it comes to math?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I have a great GPA,\u201d Buffy puffed her chest a bit before shaking her head. Her face still had a bit of confusion left on it, \u201cBut I still don\u2019t understand this. Why are you avoiding him then?\u201d</p><p>TJ looked to the side of her, avoiding eye contact, \u201cFigure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Buffy said exasperatedly, \u201cThis is going to get nowhere if you don\u2019t tell me what the problem is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then I\u2019m leaving,\u201d TJ tried to push past her but Buffy was quicker, wiping an arm out to grab TJ.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast. I won\u2019t sit around doing nothing while Cyrus drives himself up the wall trying to figure out how to fix this.\u201d Buffy turned the boy to face her, \u201cWhat did he do wrong?\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head, frustrated, \u201cNothing! He did nothing wrong. It\u2019s me. I can\u2019t be around him and just be his friends anymore. I\u2019m the problem! But then again, what\u2019s new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ\u2026\u201d Buffy let go of his arm, but it wasn\u2019t like he was going to try to escape again. She approached him cautiously, as if he were a skittish cat, \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with you. Do you\u2026\u201d She paused, taking a moment to consider her next words, \u201cDo you like Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>TJ turned to leave again, but this time Buffy rushed to block his path. He let out a sigh, \u201cCan you please just let me go? You\u2019re right. As usual. Happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m right then why are you avoiding him?\u201d Buffy looked at him in disbelief, \u201cYou do realize that you actually have a chance with him, right?\u201d</p><p>TJ let out a laugh that sounded crooked, \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong Driscoll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d She demanded, and TJ knew that he wasn\u2019t going to get away without an explanation. He literally talked to Amber about this the other night, why was everyone so annoying?</p><p>\u201cYou said it yourself,\u201d TJ\u2019s voice was hard, \u201cI\u2019m nothing but an egotistical ass, why would you want that dating one of your best friends? I know I wouldn\u2019t want that for him. So, there. Are we done?\u201d</p><p>Buffy looked a little at loss for words, \u201cTJ-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. I don\u2019t want your sympathies or the whole \u2018No! Don\u2019t treat yourself like that\u2019 speech, okay? I already got that from my sister an-\u201d</p><p>Buffy cut him off with a scoff, \u201cActually I was going to say that you were a stupid idiot. But I guess you already know that. Listen, you\u2019re not perfect. But no one is, and if you make Cyrus smile like you normally do, I don\u2019t really see a problem with giving it a shot. As long as he\u2019s happy who cares if you\u2019re not perfect? You\u2019ll be perfect to him, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffy-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d She smirked, back to her usual posture, \u201cIt\u2019s super mushy, and we don\u2019t really have conversations like this. But I mean it. So get your head out of your ass TJ and fix this before I break your arm.\u201d</p><p>She sounded eerily like his sister.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s back,\u201d TJ smiles, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d She narrows her eyes, \u201cI mean it. Don\u2019t mention it. To anybody.\u201d</p><p><b>Friday</b></p><p>Cyrus wasn\u2019t usually the one to mope. Complain endlessly? Yeah that sounded like something he\u2019d do. But mope around silently? Nope.</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Buffy laid a comforting hand on him, \u201cDrink your shake. Everything will be okay.\u201d</p><p>Instead he banged his head against the table, \u201cHow can you be so sure Buffy? This is like apocalypse level bad. He hates me, I know he said he doesn\u2019t but it\u2019s obvious he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re being dramatic,\u201d Andi laughed, \u201cWhich is actually an improvement from your little silent act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t hate you,\u201d Buffy forced his head up, \u201cTrust me. I\u2019m always right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if you\u2019re not about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right about this,\u201d Buffy forced a tater tot in his mouth, \u201cDon\u2019t question my abilities.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus chewed slowly as Andi gave him a reassuring smile, \u201cAgain, I think you should just talk to him. At least then you might be able to figure out what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed angrily, \u201cI already know what\u2019s wrong. He figured out that I like him and now he\u2019s avoiding me so he doesn\u2019t have to let me down.\u201d</p><p>Both the girls stared at him, eyebrows raised.</p><p>Cyrus smiled sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck, \u201cI never told you guys that, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Buffy huffed out, \u201cNo you didn\u2019t. But I had my suspicions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Andi giggled, \u201cYou talked about him all the time. It was just a constant stream of things TJ did that, no offense, anyone could do.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, banging his head back on the table with a loud thump, \u201cThis is not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to him.\u201d Buffy said suddenly. It made Cyrus whip his head up.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Just the other day you said to forget him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Buffy crossed her arms smugly, \u201cThings have changed. I have acquired new knowledge. I think you should talk to him. And tell him how you feel, it\u2019s the only way to clear the air.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shook his head furiously, \u201cNo! Why would I do that? He\u2019ll definitely hate me then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you just trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus! Everything will be fine. Just tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to kill my self esteem even more?\u201d He looked at her in disbelief, \u201cI thought you were my friend. Friends keep friends from doing stupid things! It\u2019s in the rules of friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Buffy turned to face him with a serious expression, \u201cThis is not a stupid thing. It\u2019s been like a week Cyrus. Have confidence and just own up to it.\u201d</p><p>He had nothing else to say after that.</p><p><b>Saturday</b></p><p>It happened by chance. They both bumped into each other on a street that neither of them ever really went down on their way to a place neither of them really went to. It was work of the cruel mistress fate.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Cyrus waved.</p><p>TJ played with his fingers behind his back, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>It was silent for another moment. The tension was so thick you could feel it if you waved your hand around a bit. What do you say to someone after you don\u2019t see them for a week? After you\u2019ve avoided them for a week? After you know for a fact that you should come clean about your secret feelings, but you\u2019re too scared to? Neither boy knew quite how to start. They both opened their mouths at the same time, minds forcing them to go somewhere.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p><hr><p>Still taking prompts! And of course if you want to chat im lonely and stuff sooooo &lt;3333</p>",

He has been avoiding Cyrus ever since he told him the previous day in a heart wrenching confession. TJ didn\u2019t return any of his calls and actually did a 180 when he saw Cyrus walking down the sidewalk. He wasn\u2019t being very subtle, and TJ knew that.</p><p>Amber glared at her brother, \u201cIs that a problem TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d TJ said in a duh voice, \u201cBut probably not in the way you\u2019re thinking. I\u2019m not a one of those stupid homophobes Ams.\u201d</p><p>His sister was extremely tempted to slap him again, \u201cWell you could have fooled me! Cyrus is basically crying his eyes out cause he thinks you hate him now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d TJ didn\u2019t mean for that to happen. He just couldn\u2019t handle knowing that Cyrus liked boys because\u2026 well because that meant that he had a chance. Well, he didn\u2019t really have a chance because Cyrus was so pure and amazing and beautiful. And he deserved the world. He deserved someone equally as great. Someone who he didn\u2019t have to wait for to become even a slightly decent person. Someone who wasn\u2019t TJ. He couldn\u2019t stand to be around Cyrus because his heart hurt knowing they could be a possibility that would never become a reality. And until he was over his own dumb heartbreak, he couldn\u2019t face Cyrus. That\u2019s another thing that he was that Cyrus didn\u2019t need in a boyfriend, selfish.</p><p>Amber sighed, patting her brother on the shoulder, \u201cYeah. He\u2019s really upset. Broke down in his milkshake this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for that to happen,\u201d TJ\u2019s voice was smaller than Amber had ever heard it before, and that included the times that their parents had yelled at them for hours on end about useless things just to take out some of their pent up anger, \u201cI just\u2026 I can\u2019t see him right now Ams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d She rubbed his arm soothingly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong then?\u201d</p><p>TJ just continued to stare down at his lap, \u201cI\u2026 I like him a lot.\u201d</p><p>Amber jumped up, smiling, \u201cTJ that\u2019s awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo its not,\u201d TJ scowled, \u201cHe deserves more. I don\u2019t even stand a chance compared to literally everyone else out there.\u201d</p><p>Amber frowned, \u201cTJ Kippen! Do not talk badly about yourself like that! Cyrus would be honored to date someone like you so get your head outta your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really know how to put things delicately don\u2019t ya sis,\u201d TJ offered a small smile, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Amber rolled her eyes and ruffled her brothers head, \u201cYou\u2019re a work in progress TJ, I\u2019ll admit. But progress is still something, and Cyrus is the most patient and understanding person we know. He won\u2019t mind that you\u2019re a little rough around the edges still. And he knows that you\u2019re a good person deep down. Deep, deep, <i>deep</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay I get it Amber,\u201d TJ groaned and pushed her out of his room.</p><p>He sent Cyrus a text later that night that read:</p><p><i>Thank you for telling me. It means a lot. I don\u2019t hate you</i>.</p><p>He\u2019s never been that great with words.</p><p><b>Tuesday</b></p><p>Cyrus contemplated not going to school, but ultimately the need to get a good education for his future won out. At least he knew that TJ didn\u2019t hate him. But that did nothing to explain why he was avoiding him though. Cyrus couldn\u2019t think of why he was being so distant.</p><p>Well that was a lie. Cyrus did have one theory. TJ must have figured out that he had a crush on him and he was trying to figure out how to let him down easily. That was the only explanation. That or TJ was worried that Cyrus would develop a crush on him, but it was already too late for that.</p><p>But if space is what TJ needed, then who was Cyrus to go against his wishes. He would respect TJ\u2019s decision and he would get over this stupid crush so that they could be friends again. </p><p>\u201cI still think you should just talk to him,\u201d Andi rubbed his arm soothingly.</p><p>Buffy slammed a hand on the table, \u201cForget him! TJ isn\u2019t worth it Cyrus. You deserve a friend who doesn\u2019t avoid you because of something like this.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just put his forehead back down on the table. He would just have to avoid all places he knew TJ was likely to show up. He could reroute his entire schedule, right?</p><p><b>Wednesday</b></p><p>TJ hadn\u2019t seen Cyrus all week.

He figured out that I like him and now he\u2019s avoiding me so he doesn\u2019t have to let me down.\u201d</p><p>Both the girls stared at him, eyebrows raised.</p><p>Cyrus smiled sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck, \u201cI never told you guys that, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Buffy huffed out, \u201cNo you didn\u2019t. But I had my suspicions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Andi giggled, \u201cYou talked about him all the time. It was just a constant stream of things TJ did that, no offense, anyone could do.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, banging his head back on the table with a loud thump, \u201cThis is not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to him.\u201d Buffy said suddenly. It made Cyrus whip his head up.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Just the other day you said to forget him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Buffy crossed her arms smugly, \u201cThings have changed. I have acquired new knowledge. I think you should talk to him. And tell him how you feel, it\u2019s the only way to clear the air.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shook his head furiously, \u201cNo! Why would I do that? He\u2019ll definitely hate me then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you just trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus! Everything will be fine. Just tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to kill my self esteem even more?\u201d He looked at her in disbelief, \u201cI thought you were my friend.

Have confidence and just own up to it.\u201d</p><p>He had nothing else to say after that.</p><p><b>Saturday</b></p><p>It happened by chance. They both bumped into each other on a street that neither of them ever really went down on their way to a place neither of them really went to. It was work of the cruel mistress fate.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Cyrus waved.</p><p>TJ played with his fingers behind his back, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>It was silent for another moment.

Hehe\u2026</p><hr><p><b>Monday</b><br></p><p>Amber slapped him upside the head, \u201cAre you fucking stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d TJ rubbed at the spot she had just bruised him. Though he probably deserved that.</p><p>\u201cCyrus Goodman is a good boy TJ! I will not tolerate my dumbass brother causing unnecessary drama!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s a good guy,\u201d TJ muttered, crossing his arms defensively, \u201cWhich is why I have to stay away from him.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Amber threw her arms up, exasperated, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes boys Amber!\u201d TJ cried out. He has been avoiding Cyrus ever since he told him the previous day in a heart wrenching confession. TJ didn\u2019t return any of his calls and actually did a 180 when he saw Cyrus walking down the sidewalk. He wasn\u2019t being very subtle, and TJ knew that.</p><p>Amber glared at her brother, \u201cIs that a problem TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d TJ said in a duh voice, \u201cBut probably not in the way you\u2019re thinking. I\u2019m not a one of those stupid homophobes Ams.\u201d</p><p>His sister was extremely tempted to slap him again, \u201cWell you could have fooled me! Cyrus is basically crying his eyes out cause he thinks you hate him now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d TJ didn\u2019t mean for that to happen. He just couldn\u2019t handle knowing that Cyrus liked boys because\u2026 well because that meant that he had a chance. Well, he didn\u2019t really have a chance because Cyrus was so pure and amazing and beautiful. And he deserved the world. He deserved someone equally as great. Someone who he didn\u2019t have to wait for to become even a slightly decent person. Someone who wasn\u2019t TJ. He couldn\u2019t stand to be around Cyrus because his heart hurt knowing they could be a possibility that would never become a reality. And until he was over his own dumb heartbreak, he couldn\u2019t face Cyrus. That\u2019s another thing that he was that Cyrus didn\u2019t need in a boyfriend, selfish.</p><p>Amber sighed, patting her brother on the shoulder, \u201cYeah. He\u2019s really upset. Broke down in his milkshake this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for that to happen,\u201d TJ\u2019s voice was smaller than Amber had ever heard it before, and that included the times that their parents had yelled at them for hours on end about useless things just to take out some of their pent up anger, \u201cI just\u2026 I can\u2019t see him right now Ams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d She rubbed his arm soothingly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong then?\u201d</p><p>TJ just continued to stare down at his lap, \u201cI\u2026 I like him a lot.\u201d</p><p>Amber jumped up, smiling, \u201cTJ that\u2019s awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo its not,\u201d TJ scowled, \u201cHe deserves more. I don\u2019t even stand a chance compared to literally everyone else out there.\u201d</p><p>Amber frowned, \u201cTJ Kippen! Do not talk badly about yourself like that! Cyrus would be honored to date someone like you so get your head outta your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really know how to put things delicately don\u2019t ya sis,\u201d TJ offered a small smile, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Amber rolled her eyes and ruffled her brothers head, \u201cYou\u2019re a work in progress TJ, I\u2019ll admit. But progress is still something, and Cyrus is the most patient and understanding person we know. He won\u2019t mind that you\u2019re a little rough around the edges still. And he knows that you\u2019re a good person deep down. Deep, deep, <i>deep</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay I get it Amber,\u201d TJ groaned and pushed her out of his room.</p><p>He sent Cyrus a text later that night that read:</p><p><i>Thank you for telling me. It means a lot. I don\u2019t hate you</i>.</p><p>He\u2019s never been that great with words.</p><p><b>Tuesday</b></p><p>Cyrus contemplated not going to school, but ultimately the need to get a good education for his future won out. At least he knew that TJ didn\u2019t hate him. But that did nothing to explain why he was avoiding him though. Cyrus couldn\u2019t think of why he was being so distant.</p><p>Well that was a lie. Cyrus did have one theory. TJ must have figured out that he had a crush on him and he was trying to figure out how to let him down easily. That was the only explanation. That or TJ was worried that Cyrus would develop a crush on him, but it was already too late for that.</p><p>But if space is what TJ needed, then who was Cyrus to go against his wishes. He would respect TJ\u2019s decision and he would get over this stupid crush so that they could be friends again. </p><p>\u201cI still think you should just talk to him,\u201d Andi rubbed his arm soothingly.</p><p>Buffy slammed a hand on the table, \u201cForget him! TJ isn\u2019t worth it Cyrus. You deserve a friend who doesn\u2019t avoid you because of something like this.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just put his forehead back down on the table. He would just have to avoid all places he knew TJ was likely to show up. He could reroute his entire schedule, right?</p><p><b>Wednesday</b></p><p>TJ hadn\u2019t seen Cyrus all week. He normally bumped into him on his way to math class, when the other boy would give him a thumbs up for encouragement. And he would sometimes see Cyrus at lunch time. TJ would swing by his table to say a quick hi. But he was nowhere to be seen. It was almost as if Cyrus was avoiding him now.</p><p>TJ sulked, twirling his pen absentmindedly and not paying the least bit of attention to his history teacher droning on. How was he going to fix this? There was no way he could manage this level of damage control now. He was doomed.</p><p>How could he let Cyrus ever think for a moment that TJ would be anything but enamored with him? Cyrus wasn\u2019t stupid. He could probably tell that something was still off with TJ, but unfortunately he probably mistook his nervous fidgeting as a subconscious uncomfortable tick. And being the amazing person that Cyrus was, he probably was giving TJ an out to not hang out with him anymore. Which of course was the exact opposite of what he wanted! Who would voluntarily leave Cyrus?</p><p>What was he going to do?</p><p><b>Thursday</b></p><p>Buffy looked absolutely murderous. Her eyes had an almost feral gleam to them, as if she were going to tear TJ\u2019s jugular out with her teeth. All of this was, of course, warranted though.</p><p>\u201cTJ Kippen. If you thought I hated you before,\u201d She started, backing him up into a locker, \u201cIt is nothing compared to the pure detestation that I have for you now.\u201d</p><p>TJ put his hands up in a surrendering motion, \u201cBuffy. How lovely it is to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the shit TJ!\u201d She sneered, \u201cHow dare you do that to Cyrus? After everything he did for you? \u00a0He was being open with you, and now that you know he\u2019s,\u201d She looked around to make sure no one was listening, \u201cNow that you know he\u2019s gay you avoid him? It\u2019s so typical! You probably think Cyrus likes you, right? It would be just like you and your ego to think so highly of yourself like that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy Driscoll?\u201d TJ could help but snap back with the same amount of venom, \u201cWhy would I ever think he would like someone like me? As if I deserve him.\u201d</p><p>Buffy backed up a bit, her face morphing into something akin to shock, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said,\u201d TJ rolled his eyes, \u201cCan you not figure it out? Are you only smart when it comes to math?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I have a great GPA,\u201d Buffy puffed her chest a bit before shaking her head. Her face still had a bit of confusion left on it, \u201cBut I still don\u2019t understand this. Why are you avoiding him then?\u201d</p><p>TJ looked to the side of her, avoiding eye contact, \u201cFigure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Buffy said exasperatedly, \u201cThis is going to get nowhere if you don\u2019t tell me what the problem is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then I\u2019m leaving,\u201d TJ tried to push past her but Buffy was quicker, wiping an arm out to grab TJ.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast. I won\u2019t sit around doing nothing while Cyrus drives himself up the wall trying to figure out how to fix this.\u201d Buffy turned the boy to face her, \u201cWhat did he do wrong?\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head, frustrated, \u201cNothing! He did nothing wrong. It\u2019s me. I can\u2019t be around him and just be his friends anymore. I\u2019m the problem! But then again, what\u2019s new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ\u2026\u201d Buffy let go of his arm, but it wasn\u2019t like he was going to try to escape again. She approached him cautiously, as if he were a skittish cat, \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with you. Do you\u2026\u201d She paused, taking a moment to consider her next words, \u201cDo you like Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>TJ turned to leave again, but this time Buffy rushed to block his path. He let out a sigh, \u201cCan you please just let me go? You\u2019re right. As usual. Happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m right then why are you avoiding him?\u201d Buffy looked at him in disbelief, \u201cYou do realize that you actually have a chance with him, right?\u201d</p><p>TJ let out a laugh that sounded crooked, \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong Driscoll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d She demanded, and TJ knew that he wasn\u2019t going to get away without an explanation. He literally talked to Amber about this the other night, why was everyone so annoying?</p><p>\u201cYou said it yourself,\u201d TJ\u2019s voice was hard, \u201cI\u2019m nothing but an egotistical ass, why would you want that dating one of your best friends? I know I wouldn\u2019t want that for him. So, there. Are we done?\u201d</p><p>Buffy looked a little at loss for words, \u201cTJ-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. I don\u2019t want your sympathies or the whole \u2018No! Don\u2019t treat yourself like that\u2019 speech, okay? I already got that from my sister an-\u201d</p><p>Buffy cut him off with a scoff, \u201cActually I was going to say that you were a stupid idiot. But I guess you already know that. Listen, you\u2019re not perfect. But no one is, and if you make Cyrus smile like you normally do, I don\u2019t really see a problem with giving it a shot. As long as he\u2019s happy who cares if you\u2019re not perfect? You\u2019ll be perfect to him, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffy-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d She smirked, back to her usual posture, \u201cIt\u2019s super mushy, and we don\u2019t really have conversations like this. But I mean it. So get your head out of your ass TJ and fix this before I break your arm.\u201d</p><p>She sounded eerily like his sister.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s back,\u201d TJ smiles, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d She narrows her eyes, \u201cI mean it. Don\u2019t mention it. To anybody.\u201d</p><p><b>Friday</b></p><p>Cyrus wasn\u2019t usually the one to mope. Complain endlessly? Yeah that sounded like something he\u2019d do. But mope around silently? Nope.</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Buffy laid a comforting hand on him, \u201cDrink your shake. Everything will be okay.\u201d</p><p>Instead he banged his head against the table, \u201cHow can you be so sure Buffy? This is like apocalypse level bad. He hates me, I know he said he doesn\u2019t but it\u2019s obvious he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re being dramatic,\u201d Andi laughed, \u201cWhich is actually an improvement from your little silent act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t hate you,\u201d Buffy forced his head up, \u201cTrust me. I\u2019m always right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if you\u2019re not about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right about this,\u201d Buffy forced a tater tot in his mouth, \u201cDon\u2019t question my abilities.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus chewed slowly as Andi gave him a reassuring smile, \u201cAgain, I think you should just talk to him. At least then you might be able to figure out what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed angrily, \u201cI already know what\u2019s wrong. He figured out that I like him and now he\u2019s avoiding me so he doesn\u2019t have to let me down.\u201d</p><p>Both the girls stared at him, eyebrows raised.</p><p>Cyrus smiled sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck, \u201cI never told you guys that, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Buffy huffed out, \u201cNo you didn\u2019t. But I had my suspicions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Andi giggled, \u201cYou talked about him all the time. It was just a constant stream of things TJ did that, no offense, anyone could do.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, banging his head back on the table with a loud thump, \u201cThis is not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to him.\u201d Buffy said suddenly. It made Cyrus whip his head up.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Just the other day you said to forget him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Buffy crossed her arms smugly, \u201cThings have changed. I have acquired new knowledge. I think you should talk to him. And tell him how you feel, it\u2019s the only way to clear the air.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shook his head furiously, \u201cNo! Why would I do that? He\u2019ll definitely hate me then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you just trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus! Everything will be fine. Just tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to kill my self esteem even more?\u201d He looked at her in disbelief, \u201cI thought you were my friend. Friends keep friends from doing stupid things! It\u2019s in the rules of friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Buffy turned to face him with a serious expression, \u201cThis is not a stupid thing. It\u2019s been like a week Cyrus.

Cyrus is basically crying his eyes out cause he thinks you hate him now!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is?&rdquo; TJ didn&rsquo;t mean for that to happen. He just couldn&rsquo;t handle knowing that Cyrus liked boys because&hellip; well because that meant that he had a chance. Well, he didn&rsquo;t really have a chance because Cyrus was so pure and amazing and beautiful. And he deserved the world. He deserved someone equally as great. Someone who he didn&rsquo;t have to wait for to become even a slightly decent person. Someone who wasn&rsquo;t TJ. He couldn&rsquo;t stand to be around Cyrus because his heart hurt knowing they could be a possibility that would never become a reality. And until he was over his own dumb heartbreak, he couldn&rsquo;t face Cyrus. That&rsquo;s another thing that he was that Cyrus didn&rsquo;t need in a boyfriend, selfish.</p><p>Amber sighed, patting her brother on the shoulder, &ldquo;Yeah. He&rsquo;s really upset. Broke down in his milkshake this afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean for that to happen,&rdquo; TJ&rsquo;s voice was smaller than Amber had ever heard it before, and that included the times that their parents had yelled at them for hours on end about useless things just to take out some of their pent up anger, &ldquo;I just&hellip; I can&rsquo;t see him right now Ams.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; She rubbed his arm soothingly, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong then?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ just continued to stare down at his lap, &ldquo;I&hellip; I like him a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber jumped up, smiling, &ldquo;TJ that&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No its not,&rdquo; TJ scowled, &ldquo;He deserves more. I don&rsquo;t even stand a chance compared to literally everyone else out there.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber frowned, &ldquo;TJ Kippen! Do not talk badly about yourself like that! Cyrus would be honored to date someone like you so get your head outta your ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You really know how to put things delicately don&rsquo;t ya sis,&rdquo; TJ offered a small smile, &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber rolled her eyes and ruffled her brothers head, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a work in progress TJ, I&rsquo;ll admit. But progress is still something, and Cyrus is the most patient and understanding person we know. He won&rsquo;t mind that you&rsquo;re a little rough around the edges still. And he knows that you&rsquo;re a good person deep down. Deep, deep, <i>deep</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay I get it Amber,&rdquo; TJ groaned and pushed her out of his room.</p><p>He sent Cyrus a text later that night that read:</p><p><i>Thank you for telling me. It means a lot. I don&rsquo;t hate you</i>.</p><p>He&rsquo;s never been that great with words.</p><p><b>Tuesday</b></p><p>Cyrus contemplated not going to school, but ultimately the need to get a good education for his future won out. At least he knew that TJ didn&rsquo;t hate him. But that did nothing to explain why he was avoiding him though. Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t think of why he was being so distant.</p><p>Well that was a lie. Cyrus did have one theory. TJ must have figured out that he had a crush on him and he was trying to figure out how to let him down easily. That was the only explanation. That or TJ was worried that Cyrus would develop a crush on him, but it was already too late for that.</p><p>But if space is what TJ needed, then who was Cyrus to go against his wishes. He would respect TJ&rsquo;s decision and he would get over this stupid crush so that they could be friends again. </p><p>&ldquo;I still think you should just talk to him,&rdquo; Andi rubbed his arm soothingly.</p><p>Buffy slammed a hand on the table, &ldquo;Forget him! TJ isn&rsquo;t worth it Cyrus. You deserve a friend who doesn&rsquo;t avoid you because of something like this.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus just put his forehead back down on the table. He would just have to avoid all places he knew TJ was likely to show up. He could reroute his entire schedule, right?</p><p><b>Wednesday</b></p><p>TJ hadn&rsquo;t seen Cyrus all week. He normally bumped into him on his way to math class, when the other boy would give him a thumbs up for encouragement. And he would sometimes see Cyrus at lunch time. TJ would swing by his table to say a quick hi. But he was nowhere to be seen. It was almost as if Cyrus was avoiding him now.</p><p>TJ sulked, twirling his pen absentmindedly and not paying the least bit of attention to his history teacher droning on. How was he going to fix this? There was no way he could manage this level of damage control now. He was doomed.</p><p>How could he let Cyrus ever think for a moment that TJ would be anything but enamored with him? Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t stupid. He could probably tell that something was still off with TJ, but unfortunately he probably mistook his nervous fidgeting as a subconscious uncomfortable tick. And being the amazing person that Cyrus was, he probably was giving TJ an out to not hang out with him anymore. Which of course was the exact opposite of what he wanted! Who would voluntarily leave Cyrus?</p><p>What was he going to do?</p><p><b>Thursday</b></p><p>Buffy looked absolutely murderous. Her eyes had an almost feral gleam to them, as if she were going to tear TJ&rsquo;s jugular out with her teeth. All of this was, of course, warranted though.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ Kippen. If you thought I hated you before,&rdquo; She started, backing him up into a locker, &ldquo;It is nothing compared to the pure detestation that I have for you now.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ put his hands up in a surrendering motion, &ldquo;Buffy. How lovely it is to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cut the shit TJ!&rdquo; She sneered, &ldquo;How dare you do that to Cyrus? After everything he did for you? &nbsp;He was being open with you, and now that you know he&rsquo;s,&rdquo; She looked around to make sure no one was listening, &ldquo;Now that you know he&rsquo;s gay you avoid him? It&rsquo;s so typical! You probably think Cyrus likes you, right? It would be just like you and your ego to think so highly of yourself like that, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you crazy Driscoll?&rdquo; TJ could help but snap back with the same amount of venom, &ldquo;Why would I ever think he would like someone like me? As if I deserve him.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy backed up a bit, her face morphing into something akin to shock, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I meant what I said,&rdquo; TJ rolled his eyes, &ldquo;Can you not figure it out? Are you only smart when it comes to math?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you know that I have a great GPA,&rdquo; Buffy puffed her chest a bit before shaking her head. Her face still had a bit of confusion left on it, &ldquo;But I still don&rsquo;t understand this. Why are you avoiding him then?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked to the side of her, avoiding eye contact, &ldquo;Figure it out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; Buffy said exasperatedly, &ldquo;This is going to get nowhere if you don&rsquo;t tell me what the problem is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Then I&rsquo;m leaving,&rdquo; TJ tried to push past her but Buffy was quicker, wiping an arm out to grab TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;Not so fast. I won&rsquo;t sit around doing nothing while Cyrus drives himself up the wall trying to figure out how to fix this.&rdquo; Buffy turned the boy to face her, &ldquo;What did he do wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shook his head, frustrated, &ldquo;Nothing! He did nothing wrong. It&rsquo;s me. I can&rsquo;t be around him and just be his friends anymore. I&rsquo;m the problem! But then again, what&rsquo;s new?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ&hellip;&rdquo; Buffy let go of his arm, but it wasn&rsquo;t like he was going to try to escape again. She approached him cautiously, as if he were a skittish cat, &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s wrong with you. Do you&hellip;&rdquo; She paused, taking a moment to consider her next words, &ldquo;Do you like Cyrus?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ turned to leave again, but this time Buffy rushed to block his path. He let out a sigh, &ldquo;Can you please just let me go? You&rsquo;re right. As usual. Happy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m right then why are you avoiding him?&rdquo; Buffy looked at him in disbelief, &ldquo;You do realize that you actually have a chance with him, right?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ let out a laugh that sounded crooked, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong Driscoll.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Explain.&rdquo; She demanded, and TJ knew that he wasn&rsquo;t going to get away without an explanation. He literally talked to Amber about this the other night, why was everyone so annoying?</p><p>&ldquo;You said it yourself,&rdquo; TJ&rsquo;s voice was hard, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nothing but an egotistical ass, why would you want that dating one of your best friends? I know I wouldn&rsquo;t want that for him. So, there. Are we done?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy looked a little at loss for words, &ldquo;TJ-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look. I don&rsquo;t want your sympathies or the whole &lsquo;No! Don&rsquo;t treat yourself like that&rsquo; speech, okay? I already got that from my sister an-&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy cut him off with a scoff, &ldquo;Actually I was going to say that you were a stupid idiot. But I guess you already know that. Listen, you&rsquo;re not perfect. But no one is, and if you make Cyrus smile like you normally do, I don&rsquo;t really see a problem with giving it a shot. As long as he&rsquo;s happy who cares if you&rsquo;re not perfect? You&rsquo;ll be perfect to him, and that&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Buffy-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; She smirked, back to her usual posture, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s super mushy, and we don&rsquo;t really have conversations like this. But I mean it. So get your head out of your ass TJ and fix this before I break your arm.&rdquo;</p><p>She sounded eerily like his sister.</p><p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s back,&rdquo; TJ smiles, &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; She narrows her eyes, &ldquo;I mean it. Don&rsquo;t mention it. To anybody.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Friday</b></p><p>Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t usually the one to mope. Complain endlessly? Yeah that sounded like something he&rsquo;d do. But mope around silently? Nope.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus,&rdquo; Buffy laid a comforting hand on him, &ldquo;Drink your shake. Everything will be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Instead he banged his head against the table, &ldquo;How can you be so sure Buffy? This is like apocalypse level bad. He hates me, I know he said he doesn&rsquo;t but it&rsquo;s obvious he does.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re being dramatic,&rdquo; Andi laughed, &ldquo;Which is actually an improvement from your little silent act.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And he doesn&rsquo;t hate you,&rdquo; Buffy forced his head up, &ldquo;Trust me. I&rsquo;m always right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what if you&rsquo;re not about this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right about this,&rdquo; Buffy forced a tater tot in his mouth, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t question my abilities.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus chewed slowly as Andi gave him a reassuring smile, &ldquo;Again, I think you should just talk to him. At least then you might be able to figure out what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>He swallowed angrily, &ldquo;I already know what&rsquo;s wrong. He figured out that I like him and now he&rsquo;s avoiding me so he doesn&rsquo;t have to let me down.&rdquo;</p><p>Both the girls stared at him, eyebrows raised.</p><p>Cyrus smiled sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck, &ldquo;I never told you guys that, did I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Buffy huffed out, &ldquo;No you didn&rsquo;t. But I had my suspicions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Andi giggled, &ldquo;You talked about him all the time. It was just a constant stream of things TJ did that, no offense, anyone could do.&rdquo;</p><p>He groaned, banging his head back on the table with a loud thump, &ldquo;This is not helping.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should talk to him.&rdquo; Buffy said suddenly. It made Cyrus whip his head up.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Just the other day you said to forget him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Buffy crossed her arms smugly, &ldquo;Things have changed. I have acquired new knowledge. I think you should talk to him. And tell him how you feel, it&rsquo;s the only way to clear the air.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus shook his head furiously, &ldquo;No! Why would I do that? He&rsquo;ll definitely hate me then!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you just trust me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus! Everything will be fine. Just tell him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you trying to kill my self esteem even more?&rdquo; He looked at her in disbelief, &ldquo;I thought you were my friend. Friends keep friends from doing stupid things! It&rsquo;s in the rules of friendship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Buffy turned to face him with a serious expression, &ldquo;This is not a stupid thing. It&rsquo;s been like a week Cyrus. Have confidence and just own up to it.&rdquo;</p><p>He had nothing else to say after that.</p><p><b>Saturday</b></p><p>It happened by chance. They both bumped into each other on a street that neither of them ever really went down on their way to a place neither of them really went to. It was work of the cruel mistress fate.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Cyrus waved.</p><p>TJ played with his fingers behind his back, &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;</p><p>It was silent for another moment. The tension was so thick you could feel it if you waved your hand around a bit. What do you say to someone after you don&rsquo;t see them for a week? After you&rsquo;ve avoided them for a week? After you know for a fact that you should come clean about your secret feelings, but you&rsquo;re too scared to? Neither boy knew quite how to start. They both opened their mouths at the same time, minds forcing them to go somewhere.</p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip;&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Still taking prompts! And of course if you want to chat im lonely and stuff sooooo &lt;3333</p>",

I will not tolerate my dumbass brother causing unnecessary drama!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s a good guy,&rdquo; TJ muttered, crossing his arms defensively, &ldquo;Which is why I have to stay away from him.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
