But what are your Muffy predictions for the rest of season 3? I know they\u2019ll probably end up together but what do you think the writers will do with them leading up to that point? Do you have any predictions for them if AM gets a season 4?",
        "answer": "<p>Actually anon, we know for a fact that they end up together thanks to a casting notice for 3x17 posted all the way back in October:</p><p>\n\n<i><b>RACHEL Female, 13-16, Any Ethnicity, Marty\u2019s girlfriend, Jealous when Marty runs into Buffy at the Bowling Alley. She questions whether or not Buffy and Marty have feelings for each other. Co-Star</b></i>\n\n<br/></p><p>Right after 3x17 comes the wedding in 3x18 and Marty is there so we know either at the bowling alley itself or soon afterwards Machel sinks and Muffy rises. So really their story is just getting together and then having some coupley moments after they canon. Basically we have: marathon in 3x14, bowling alley and jealous Rachel in 3x17, Marty as Buffy\u2019s wedding date in 3x18, Buffy and Marty at the school when some pro or semi-pro basketball players visit in what\u2019s most likely 3x20, and then Muffy at the house party in 3x21. One mystery for their story line is whether we\u2019ll see a Muffy kiss, Garren has already hinted at it so we\u2019ll see if it happens at some point.</p><p>I think the Muffy story line will probably be the most satisfying story line, ship related or not, that we\u2019ll get in 3c as they\u2019ll get ample screen time and the show can tell their story in text rather than subtext. It\u2019s darkly funny to me that Marty happened to overlap so much with Ham as they were both in eps 14, 17, and 18 so Marty is likely to benefit with some longer cuts of his scenes in those eps. Which makes sense since Ham\u2019s story line would have been largely tied to the wedding and Marty\u2019s arc is structured to make sure he\u2019s at the wedding.\u00a0</p><p>And it looks like the writers invented a completely new Muffy C plot for what\u2019s likely to be 3x20 involving the basketball players visiting Jefferson which I\u2019d guess is because Disney is really pushing Sofia as their next big star and the writers probably wanted to add a bit more depth to their arc since Garren could only be on set for so long while still being on GH. since 3x20 was probably Ham\u2019s biggest ep since he was the only guest star that ep once again Garren benefits from Stoney\u2019s arrest. Garren was on set for 9 confirmed days of filming, including the re-shoots, so we\u2019re probably looking at something around 15 minutes give or take a few minutes of screen time for him in 3c spread out over 5 eps. Thanks to Stoney\u2019s arrest and the re-shoots Marty probably ended up with around 4ish minutes more screentime than he would have originally gotten.\u00a0</p><p>In the unlikely event of a S4, Muffy would be a big winner. With Sofia\u2019s star rising and with them having Garren available for the entire season we\u2019d be looking at a lot more of them. Garren only returned in 3x10 but he still ended up with 7 eps in S3 which is almost as much as Luke\u2019s 9 and in S4 he\u2019d definitely have more eps than Luke so we\u2019d probably be looking at something in the range of 9-11 Marty eps. They\u2019d have to do something to give Marty depth but I have no idea what that would be though we can rule out panic attacks, learning disabilities, and family financial problems. There\u2019d have to be some drama for them but the endgames have been locked in place for a while now so the show would struggle on that front since the audience won\u2019t want to see them split up nor would any other new boy or girl be a plausible threat</p>",

She questions whether or not Buffy and Marty have feelings for each other. Co-Star</b></i>\n\n<br></p><p>Right after 3x17 comes the wedding in 3x18 and Marty is there so we know either at the bowling alley itself or soon afterwards Machel sinks and Muffy rises. So really their story is just getting together and then having some coupley moments after they canon. Basically we have: marathon in 3x14, bowling alley and jealous Rachel in 3x17, Marty as Buffy\u2019s wedding date in 3x18, Buffy and Marty at the school when some pro or semi-pro basketball players visit in what\u2019s most likely 3x20, and then Muffy at the house party in 3x21. One mystery for their story line is whether we\u2019ll see a Muffy kiss, Garren has already hinted at it so we\u2019ll see if it happens at some point.</p><p>I think the Muffy story line will probably be the most satisfying story line, ship related or not, that we\u2019ll get in 3c as they\u2019ll get ample screen time and the show can tell their story in text rather than subtext. It\u2019s darkly funny to me that Marty happened to overlap so much with Ham as they were both in eps 14, 17, and 18 so Marty is likely to benefit with some longer cuts of his scenes in those eps. Which makes sense since Ham\u2019s story line would have been largely tied to the wedding and Marty\u2019s arc is structured to make sure he\u2019s at the wedding.\u00a0</p><p>And it looks like the writers invented a completely new Muffy C plot for what\u2019s likely to be 3x20 involving the basketball players visiting Jefferson which I\u2019d guess is because Disney is really pushing Sofia as their next big star and the writers probably wanted to add a bit more depth to their arc since Garren could only be on set for so long while still being on GH. since 3x20 was probably Ham\u2019s biggest ep since he was the only guest star that ep once again Garren benefits from Stoney\u2019s arrest. Garren was on set for 9 confirmed days of filming, including the re-shoots, so we\u2019re probably looking at something around 15 minutes give or take a few minutes of screen time for him in 3c spread out over 5 eps. Thanks to Stoney\u2019s arrest and the re-shoots Marty probably ended up with around 4ish minutes more screentime than he would have originally gotten.\u00a0</p><p>In the unlikely event of a S4, Muffy would be a big winner. With Sofia\u2019s star rising and with them having Garren available for the entire season we\u2019d be looking at a lot more of them. Garren only returned in 3x10 but he still ended up with 7 eps in S3 which is almost as much as Luke\u2019s 9 and in S4 he\u2019d definitely have more eps than Luke so we\u2019d probably be looking at something in the range of 9-11 Marty eps. They\u2019d have to do something to give Marty depth but I have no idea what that would be though we can rule out panic attacks, learning disabilities, and family financial problems. There\u2019d have to be some drama for them but the endgames have been locked in place for a while now so the show would struggle on that front since the audience won\u2019t want to see them split up nor would any other new boy or girl be a plausible threat</p>",
