        "title": "ARYA STARK: OF WHALES, SHELLS AND DRAGONS",
        "body": "<p>In a previous post<b>\u00a0(\u201cThe scrub\u201d),</b> I briefly mentioned that Arya\u2019s story arc in ACOK\n(and ASOS, to some extent) had some Noah\u2019s arch elements to it. I won\u2019t dig too\nfar into it since\u00a0others discussed this before. However, I\u2019d\nlike to expand on another biblical myth perhaps found in Arya\u2019s storyline \u2013\nthis time in Braavos (then I\u2019ll get to the dragon stuff). </p><p>Arya\u2019s POV in AFFC opens with her\naboard the <i>Titan\u2019s Daughter</i>, as they\napproach the Isles of Braavos and must pass beneath the giant statue of the <i>Titan of Braavos</i>: </p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink\nflesh of little highborn girls</b>,&rdquo; Nan would end, and Sansa would give a\nstupid squeak. But Maester Luwin said the Titan was only a statue, and Old\nNan&rsquo;s stories were only stories.</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><i>&ldquo;I\nhope your Titan isn&rsquo;t hungry,&rdquo; Arya told him.</i></p><p><i> &ldquo;Hungry?&rdquo; Denyo said, confused.</i></p><p><i> &ldquo;It takes no matter.&rdquo; <b>Even if the Titan did eat juicy pink girl\nflesh, Arya would not fear him. She was a scrawny thing, no proper meal for a\ngiant,</b> and almost eleven, practically a woman grown</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><i>Wind\nand wave had the Titan&rsquo;s Daughter hard in hand now, driving her swiftly toward\nthe channel. Her double bank of oars stroked smoothly, lashing the sea to white\nfoam as the Titan&rsquo;s shadow fell upon them. For a moment it seemed as though\nthey must surely smash up against the stones beneath his legs. Huddled by Denyo\nat the prow, Arya could taste salt where the spray had touched her face. She\nhad to look straight up to see the Titan&rsquo;s head. <b>&ldquo;The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn\ngirls,&rdquo; she heard Old Nan say again, </b>but she was not a little girl,\nand she would not be frightened of a stupid statue. - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>Arya keeps remembering Old Nan\u2019s\ntale about the Titan\u2019s eating \u201chabits\u201d, and even after they\u2019ve sailed behind it,\nthe danger of being \u201cdevoured\u201d still linger: </p><p><i>&ldquo;The\nArsenal of Braavos,&rdquo; Denyo named it, as proud as if he&rsquo;d built it.\n&ldquo;They can build a war galley there in a day.&rdquo; Arya could see dozens\nof galleys tied up at quays and perched on launching slips. The painted prows\nof others poked from innumerable wooden sheds along the stony shores, <b>like hounds in a kennel, lean and mean and\nhungry</b>, waiting for a hunter&rsquo;s horn to call them forth.</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><b><i>The mouths </i></b><i>of\nlesser canals<b> opened to either side,</b>\nand others still smaller off of those. - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>That\u2019s because Arya really is being\n(symbolically) swallowed by something here. The parallels with \u201cJonah and the\nwhale\u201d become a bit more apparent with these:</p><p><i>The\ngalleys passed to either side of them, so close that <b>she could hear the muffled sound of drums from within their purple\nhulls, bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom, like the beat of living hearts</b>.</i></p><p>(Where we get the impression that\nArya\u2019s inside some giant living creature)</p><p>&amp;</p><p><i>A\nharbor was visible off to her right, a tangle of piers and quays crowded with <b>big-bellied <strike>whales</strike> whalers</b> out\nof Ibben - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>It\u2019s interesting, because Arya\u2019s\nPOV chapters in ACOK open with her wishing that King\u2019s Landing would flood. During\nher travels in the Riverlands with Gendry, Lommy and Hot Pie, the rain pours nonstop,\neffectively causing a flood. In AFFC, she finds herself in the flooded city of\nBraavos \u2013 </p><p><i>Another\nharbor, more distant, was off to her left, <b>beyond\na sinking point of land where the tops of half-drowned buildings thrust\nthemselves above the water.</b> Arya had never seen so many big buildings all\ntogether in one place. King&rsquo;s Landing had the Red Keep and the Great Sept of\nBaelor and the Dragonpit -\u00a0</i>Arya, AFFC</p><p> \u2013 only this time, her life jacket isn\u2019t a boat\n(Noah\u2019s arch), it\u2019s a whale\u2019s belly. </p><p>The thing with being inside a \u201cwhale\u2019s\nbelly\u201d is, it allows Arya to go unseen. The myth itself is generally considered\na metaphor of rebirth (which I\u2019ll get to in a moment), but the whale\u2019s belly\nalso provides safety and secrecy while traveling. When Cat of the canals start\nselling oysters, clams and cockles, she can go anywhere she wants:</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oysters,\nclams, and cockles&rdquo; were Cat&rsquo;s magic words, and <b>like all good magic words they could take her almost anywhere. </b>She\nhad boarded ships from Lys and Oldtown and the Port of Ibben and sold her\noysters right on deck.</i>\n(\u2026)<i> One time, when Brea took to her bed\nwith her moon blood, Cat had pushed her barrow to the Purple Harbor to sell\ncrabs and prawns to oarsmen off the Sealord&rsquo;s pleasure barge, covered stem to\nstern with laughing faces. Other days she followed the sweetwater river to the\nMoon Pool. </i>(\u2026)<i> But she always\nreturned to the Ragman&rsquo;s Harbor. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>We see here that the \u201cwhale\u2019s belly\u201d\ncan take other forms; i.e., a bivalve\u2019s shell (hiding in a belly vs hiding in a\nshell). Indeed, there\u2019s some textual clues here and there linking Cat to what\u2019s\ninside said shell(s):</p><p><i>Farther\ndown the docks she came on Tagganaro sitting with his back against a piling,\nnext to Casso, King of Seals. He bought some mussels from her, and Casso barked\nand let her shake his flipper. <b>&ldquo;You\ncome work with me, Cat,&rdquo; urged Tagganaro as he was sucking mussels from\ntheir shells.</b> He had been looking for a new partner ever since the Drunken\nDaughter put her knife through Little Narbo&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;<b>I give you more than Brusco,</b> and you would not smell like\nfish.&rdquo;</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><i>&ldquo;Which\none was this, now? <b>The Queen o&rsquo; Cockles,\nwas it?</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> &ldquo;<b>The\nBlack Pearl</b>,&rdquo; she told them. Merry claimed the Black Pearl was the\nmost famous courtesan of all. &ldquo;<b>She&rsquo;s\ndescended from the dragons, that one</b>,&rdquo; the woman had told Cat. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>In the first citation, we have\nTagganaro trying to \u201cslurp\u201d Cat from her shell, same as he\u2019s doing with his mussels,\nand in the second, the \u201cQueen o\u2019Cokles\u201d (a courtesan, but it could also be\napplied to Cat, oddly, especially since moments before Cat was asked by another\nsailor how much she wanted for the \u201ccockle between her legs\u201d), named after what\u2019s\nfound inside cockles (pearls).

            "comment": "<p><p>In a previous post<b>\u00a0(\u201cThe scrub\u201d),</b> I briefly mentioned that Arya\u2019s story arc in ACOK\n(and ASOS, to some extent) had some Noah\u2019s arch elements to it. I won\u2019t dig too\nfar into it since\u00a0others discussed this before. However, I\u2019d\nlike to expand on another biblical myth perhaps found in Arya\u2019s storyline \u2013\nthis time in Braavos (then I\u2019ll get to the dragon stuff). </p><p>Arya\u2019s POV in AFFC opens with her\naboard the <i>Titan\u2019s Daughter</i>, as they\napproach the Isles of Braavos and must pass beneath the giant statue of the <i>Titan of Braavos</i>: </p><p><i>\u201c<b>The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink\nflesh of little highborn girls</b>,\u201d Nan would end, and Sansa would give a\nstupid squeak. But Maester Luwin said the Titan was only a statue, and Old\nNan\u2019s stories were only stories.</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><i>\u201cI\nhope your Titan isn\u2019t hungry,\u201d Arya told him.</i></p><p><i> \u201cHungry?\u201d Denyo said, confused.</i></p><p><i> \u201cIt takes no matter.\u201d <b>Even if the Titan did eat juicy pink girl\nflesh, Arya would not fear him. She was a scrawny thing, no proper meal for a\ngiant,</b> and almost eleven, practically a woman grown</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><i>Wind\nand wave had the Titan\u2019s Daughter hard in hand now, driving her swiftly toward\nthe channel. Her double bank of oars stroked smoothly, lashing the sea to white\nfoam as the Titan\u2019s shadow fell upon them. For a moment it seemed as though\nthey must surely smash up against the stones beneath his legs. Huddled by Denyo\nat the prow, Arya could taste salt where the spray had touched her face. She\nhad to look straight up to see the Titan\u2019s head. <b>\u201cThe Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn\ngirls,\u201d she heard Old Nan say again, </b>but she was not a little girl,\nand she would not be frightened of a stupid statue. - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>Arya keeps remembering Old Nan\u2019s\ntale about the Titan\u2019s eating \u201chabits\u201d, and even after they\u2019ve sailed behind it,\nthe danger of being \u201cdevoured\u201d still linger: </p><p><i>\u201cThe\nArsenal of Braavos,\u201d Denyo named it, as proud as if he\u2019d built it.\n\u201cThey can build a war galley there in a day.\u201d Arya could see dozens\nof galleys tied up at quays and perched on launching slips. The painted prows\nof others poked from innumerable wooden sheds along the stony shores, <b>like hounds in a kennel, lean and mean and\nhungry</b>, waiting for a hunter\u2019s horn to call them forth.</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><b><i>The mouths </i></b><i>of\nlesser canals<b> opened to either side,</b>\nand others still smaller off of those. - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>That\u2019s because Arya really is being\n(symbolically) swallowed by something here. The parallels with \u201cJonah and the\nwhale\u201d become a bit more apparent with these:</p><p><i>The\ngalleys passed to either side of them, so close that <b>she could hear the muffled sound of drums from within their purple\nhulls, bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom, like the beat of living hearts</b>.</i></p><p>(Where we get the impression that\nArya\u2019s inside some giant living creature)</p><p>&amp;</p><p><i>A\nharbor was visible off to her right, a tangle of piers and quays crowded with <b>big-bellied <strike>whales</strike> whalers</b> out\nof Ibben - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>It\u2019s interesting, because Arya\u2019s\nPOV chapters in ACOK open with her wishing that King\u2019s Landing would flood. During\nher travels in the Riverlands with Gendry, Lommy and Hot Pie, the rain pours nonstop,\neffectively causing a flood. In AFFC, she finds herself in the flooded city of\nBraavos \u2013 </p><p><i>Another\nharbor, more distant, was off to her left, <b>beyond\na sinking point of land where the tops of half-drowned buildings thrust\nthemselves above the water.</b> Arya had never seen so many big buildings all\ntogether in one place. King\u2019s Landing had the Red Keep and the Great Sept of\nBaelor and the Dragonpit -\u00a0</i>Arya, AFFC</p><p> \u2013 only this time, her life jacket isn\u2019t a boat\n(Noah\u2019s arch), it\u2019s a whale\u2019s belly. </p><p>The thing with being inside a \u201cwhale\u2019s\nbelly\u201d is, it allows Arya to go unseen. The myth itself is generally considered\na metaphor of rebirth (which I\u2019ll get to in a moment), but the whale\u2019s belly\nalso provides safety and secrecy while traveling. When Cat of the canals start\nselling oysters, clams and cockles, she can go anywhere she wants:</p><p><i>\u201cOysters,\nclams, and cockles\u201d were Cat\u2019s magic words, and <b>like all good magic words they could take her almost anywhere. </b>She\nhad boarded ships from Lys and Oldtown and the Port of Ibben and sold her\noysters right on deck.</i>\n(\u2026)<i> One time, when Brea took to her bed\nwith her moon blood, Cat had pushed her barrow to the Purple Harbor to sell\ncrabs and prawns to oarsmen off the Sealord\u2019s pleasure barge, covered stem to\nstern with laughing faces. Other days she followed the sweetwater river to the\nMoon Pool. </i>(\u2026)<i> But she always\nreturned to the Ragman\u2019s Harbor. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>We see here that the \u201cwhale\u2019s belly\u201d\ncan take other forms; i.e., a bivalve\u2019s shell (hiding in a belly vs hiding in a\nshell). Indeed, there\u2019s some textual clues here and there linking Cat to what\u2019s\ninside said shell(s):</p><p><i>Farther\ndown the docks she came on Tagganaro sitting with his back against a piling,\nnext to Casso, King of Seals. He bought some mussels from her, and Casso barked\nand let her shake his flipper. <b>\u201cYou\ncome work with me, Cat,\u201d urged Tagganaro as he was sucking mussels from\ntheir shells.</b> He had been looking for a new partner ever since the Drunken\nDaughter put her knife through Little Narbo\u2019s hand. \u201c<b>I give you more than Brusco,</b> and you would not smell like\nfish.\u201d</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><i>\u201cWhich\none was this, now? <b>The Queen o\u2019 Cockles,\nwas it?</b>\u201d</i></p><p><i> \u201c<b>The\nBlack Pearl</b>,\u201d she told them. Merry claimed the Black Pearl was the\nmost famous courtesan of all. \u201c<b>She\u2019s\ndescended from the dragons, that one</b>,\u201d the woman had told Cat. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>In the first citation, we have\nTagganaro trying to \u201cslurp\u201d Cat from her shell, same as he\u2019s doing with his mussels,\nand in the second, the \u201cQueen o\u2019Cokles\u201d (a courtesan, but it could also be\napplied to Cat, oddly, especially since moments before Cat was asked by another\nsailor how much she wanted for the \u201ccockle between her legs\u201d), named after what\u2019s\nfound inside cockles (pearls). The \u201cBlack Pearl\u201d, actually, symbolizes <strike>Arya</strike>\nCat very well here, because that\u2019s essentially what she is (a black pearl hidden\ninside a shell/a princess hidden inside a whale\u2019s belly). </p><p>Which brings me to my third tinfoil\nword cake: any other \u201cblack pearl\u201d inside its shell in asoiaf?

Daenerys\u2019s mistake was believing that she was\nsacrificing a <i>horse </i>in exchange for her\nhusband\u2019s life. Arya\u2019s mistake was killing Dareon: </p><p><i>\u201cDareon\nis dead. The black singer who was sleeping at the Happy Port. He was really a\ndeserter from the Night\u2019s Watch. Someone slit his throat and pushed him into a\ncanal, but they kept his boots.\u201d</i></p><p><i> \u201cGood boots are hard to find.\u201d</i></p><p><i> \u201cJust so.\u201d She tried to keep her\nface still.</i></p><p><i> \u201cWho could have done this thing, I\nwonder?\u201d</i></p><p><i> \u201cArya of House Stark.\u201d She watched\nhis eyes, his mouth, the muscles of his jaw. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>Daenerys and Arya are both given a\nbitter, milky beverage to drink:</p><p><i>She\ntasted sour milk, and something else, something thick and bitter.</i> \u2013 Daenerys, AGOT</p><p><i>On\nher way across the city Arya had wondered what the kindly man would say when\nshe told him about Dareon. Maybe he would be angry with her, or maybe he would\nbe pleased that she had given the singer the gift of the Many-Faced God. She\nhad played this talk out in her head half a hundred times, like a mummer in a\nshow. But she had never thought <b>warm\nmilk.</b></i></p><p> <i>When the\nmilk came, Arya drank it down. <b>It\nsmelled a little burnt and had a bitter aftertaste.</b></i> \u2013 Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>Basically, this is Arya\u2019s first \u201cfailed\u201d\nhatching. Milk is a liquid strongly linked to motherhood. Here, the milk is\nspoiled, which may or may not indicate a failed attempt at giving birth. </p><p>Overall, where Daenerys is a mother\nfigure, Arya is the child, the dragon hatchling looking <i>for </i>her mother:</p><p><i>It\nwas the other dream she hated, the one where she had two feet instead of four.\nIn that one <b>she was always looking for\nher mother, stumbling through a wasted land of mud and blood and fire</b>. It\nwas always raining in that dream, and she could hear her mother screaming, but\na monster with a dog\u2019s head would not let her go save her.</i> \u2013 Arya, AFFC</p><p>Perhaps it\u2019s not a coincidence that\nDany and Drogon are separated from each other around roughly the same time\nwhere Arya dreams of her mother at the Red Wedding. Perhaps it\u2019s not a coincidence\nthat Arya\u2019s looking for her mother in a \u201cwasted land of mud and blood and fire\u201d,\nwhereas Drogon was born in blood, fire, and right by the Red Waste. This is all\nvery intriguing. But anyway, I\u2019ll conclude for now with a quote from our\nfavorite witches and wizards\u2019 story: </p><p><b><i>\u201cNever tickle a sleeping\ndragon\u201d</i></b></p><p><b></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"228\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"daeneryskairipa:WUTmvQiJ8H8qkAViOoXd7Q:ZQifVs2P3g4tr\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"183\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dominobambino13:iQDgz8XmAVnprju92yGrYg:Zv46gr2OwOgGY\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b15056ef5a95b4b78ed7c767259ee3d5/tumblr_oup1nwOWF71swr7fmo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"183\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"228\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"daeneryskairipa:WUTmvQiJ8H8qkAViOoXd7Q:ZQifVs2P3g4tr\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",

                "content_raw": "<p><p>In a previous post<b>\u00a0(\u201cThe scrub\u201d),</b> I briefly mentioned that Arya\u2019s story arc in ACOK\n(and ASOS, to some extent) had some Noah\u2019s arch elements to it. I won\u2019t dig too\nfar into it since\u00a0others discussed this before. However, I\u2019d\nlike to expand on another biblical myth perhaps found in Arya\u2019s storyline \u2013\nthis time in Braavos (then I\u2019ll get to the dragon stuff). </p><p>Arya\u2019s POV in AFFC opens with her\naboard the <i>Titan\u2019s Daughter</i>, as they\napproach the Isles of Braavos and must pass beneath the giant statue of the <i>Titan of Braavos</i>: </p><p><i>\u201c<b>The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink\nflesh of little highborn girls</b>,\u201d Nan would end, and Sansa would give a\nstupid squeak. But Maester Luwin said the Titan was only a statue, and Old\nNan\u2019s stories were only stories.</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><i>\u201cI\nhope your Titan isn\u2019t hungry,\u201d Arya told him.</i></p><p><i> \u201cHungry?\u201d Denyo said, confused.</i></p><p><i> \u201cIt takes no matter.\u201d <b>Even if the Titan did eat juicy pink girl\nflesh, Arya would not fear him. She was a scrawny thing, no proper meal for a\ngiant,</b> and almost eleven, practically a woman grown</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><i>Wind\nand wave had the Titan\u2019s Daughter hard in hand now, driving her swiftly toward\nthe channel. Her double bank of oars stroked smoothly, lashing the sea to white\nfoam as the Titan\u2019s shadow fell upon them. For a moment it seemed as though\nthey must surely smash up against the stones beneath his legs. Huddled by Denyo\nat the prow, Arya could taste salt where the spray had touched her face. She\nhad to look straight up to see the Titan\u2019s head. <b>\u201cThe Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn\ngirls,\u201d she heard Old Nan say again, </b>but she was not a little girl,\nand she would not be frightened of a stupid statue. - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>Arya keeps remembering Old Nan\u2019s\ntale about the Titan\u2019s eating \u201chabits\u201d, and even after they\u2019ve sailed behind it,\nthe danger of being \u201cdevoured\u201d still linger: </p><p><i>\u201cThe\nArsenal of Braavos,\u201d Denyo named it, as proud as if he\u2019d built it.\n\u201cThey can build a war galley there in a day.\u201d Arya could see dozens\nof galleys tied up at quays and perched on launching slips. The painted prows\nof others poked from innumerable wooden sheds along the stony shores, <b>like hounds in a kennel, lean and mean and\nhungry</b>, waiting for a hunter\u2019s horn to call them forth.</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><b><i>The mouths </i></b><i>of\nlesser canals<b> opened to either side,</b>\nand others still smaller off of those. - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>That\u2019s because Arya really is being\n(symbolically) swallowed by something here. The parallels with \u201cJonah and the\nwhale\u201d become a bit more apparent with these:</p><p><i>The\ngalleys passed to either side of them, so close that <b>she could hear the muffled sound of drums from within their purple\nhulls, bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom, like the beat of living hearts</b>.</i></p><p>(Where we get the impression that\nArya\u2019s inside some giant living creature)</p><p>&amp;</p><p><i>A\nharbor was visible off to her right, a tangle of piers and quays crowded with <b>big-bellied <strike>whales</strike> whalers</b> out\nof Ibben - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>It\u2019s interesting, because Arya\u2019s\nPOV chapters in ACOK open with her wishing that King\u2019s Landing would flood. During\nher travels in the Riverlands with Gendry, Lommy and Hot Pie, the rain pours nonstop,\neffectively causing a flood. In AFFC, she finds herself in the flooded city of\nBraavos \u2013 </p><p><i>Another\nharbor, more distant, was off to her left, <b>beyond\na sinking point of land where the tops of half-drowned buildings thrust\nthemselves above the water.</b> Arya had never seen so many big buildings all\ntogether in one place. King\u2019s Landing had the Red Keep and the Great Sept of\nBaelor and the Dragonpit -\u00a0</i>Arya, AFFC</p><p> \u2013 only this time, her life jacket isn\u2019t a boat\n(Noah\u2019s arch), it\u2019s a whale\u2019s belly. </p><p>The thing with being inside a \u201cwhale\u2019s\nbelly\u201d is, it allows Arya to go unseen. The myth itself is generally considered\na metaphor of rebirth (which I\u2019ll get to in a moment), but the whale\u2019s belly\nalso provides safety and secrecy while traveling. When Cat of the canals start\nselling oysters, clams and cockles, she can go anywhere she wants:</p><p><i>\u201cOysters,\nclams, and cockles\u201d were Cat\u2019s magic words, and <b>like all good magic words they could take her almost anywhere. </b>She\nhad boarded ships from Lys and Oldtown and the Port of Ibben and sold her\noysters right on deck.</i>\n(\u2026)<i> One time, when Brea took to her bed\nwith her moon blood, Cat had pushed her barrow to the Purple Harbor to sell\ncrabs and prawns to oarsmen off the Sealord\u2019s pleasure barge, covered stem to\nstern with laughing faces. Other days she followed the sweetwater river to the\nMoon Pool. </i>(\u2026)<i> But she always\nreturned to the Ragman\u2019s Harbor. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>We see here that the \u201cwhale\u2019s belly\u201d\ncan take other forms; i.e., a bivalve\u2019s shell (hiding in a belly vs hiding in a\nshell). Indeed, there\u2019s some textual clues here and there linking Cat to what\u2019s\ninside said shell(s):</p><p><i>Farther\ndown the docks she came on Tagganaro sitting with his back against a piling,\nnext to Casso, King of Seals. He bought some mussels from her, and Casso barked\nand let her shake his flipper. <b>\u201cYou\ncome work with me, Cat,\u201d urged Tagganaro as he was sucking mussels from\ntheir shells.</b> He had been looking for a new partner ever since the Drunken\nDaughter put her knife through Little Narbo\u2019s hand. \u201c<b>I give you more than Brusco,</b> and you would not smell like\nfish.\u201d</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><i>\u201cWhich\none was this, now? <b>The Queen o\u2019 Cockles,\nwas it?</b>\u201d</i></p><p><i> \u201c<b>The\nBlack Pearl</b>,\u201d she told them. Merry claimed the Black Pearl was the\nmost famous courtesan of all. \u201c<b>She\u2019s\ndescended from the dragons, that one</b>,\u201d the woman had told Cat. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>In the first citation, we have\nTagganaro trying to \u201cslurp\u201d Cat from her shell, same as he\u2019s doing with his mussels,\nand in the second, the \u201cQueen o\u2019Cokles\u201d (a courtesan, but it could also be\napplied to Cat, oddly, especially since moments before Cat was asked by another\nsailor how much she wanted for the \u201ccockle between her legs\u201d), named after what\u2019s\nfound inside cockles (pearls). The \u201cBlack Pearl\u201d, actually, symbolizes <strike>Arya</strike>\nCat very well here, because that\u2019s essentially what she is (a black pearl hidden\ninside a shell/a princess hidden inside a whale\u2019s belly). </p><p>Which brings me to my third tinfoil\nword cake: any other \u201cblack pearl\u201d inside its shell in asoiaf? How about Drogon\u2019s\negg? </p><p><i>She\nchewed on her lip, hoping. <b>If I had\nwings I could fly back to Winterfell and see for myself. And if it was true,\nI\u2019d just fly away, fly up past the moon and the shining stars, and see all the\nthings in Old Nan\u2019s stories, dragons and sea monsters and the Titan of Braavos,\nand maybe I wouldn\u2019t ever fly back unless I wanted to.</b></i> \u2013 Arya, ACOK</p><p>I\u2019ve mentioned before that the\nstory of Jonas and the whale was generally accepted as a metaphor for rebirth. In<b>\u00a0\u201cThe scrub\u201d</b>, I talked about the\nparallels between the hatching of Dany\u2019s dragons, Dany\u2019s metaphorical rebirth,\nand Arya\u2019s rebirth beneath the burning shed. I think Arya is a dragon-like figure:\nshe\u2019s dangerous, deadly and magical. And she hasn\u2019t hatched yet. </p><p>Let\u2019s admit right off the bat that\nthere\u2019s something witchy about Arya, even if we disregard the whole faceless\nman thing: in AGOT, she has this thing with a black cat. In Harrenhal, ACOK,\nshe practices sword fighting with a broomstick. Eats worm. Think of herself as\nthe \u201cghost of Harrenhal\u201d. Mingles with brews and potions (starting with the conspicuous\n\u201cweasel soup\u201d in Harrenhal, then at the House of Black and White with the waif).\nDoes most of her \u201cmischiefs\u201d at night. In ADWD, the waif gives her a face with\na wart that sprouts black hairs. </p><p>And shaves her head, too, like a\ncertain someone named \u201cEgg\u201d. </p><p>Then there\u2019s some interesting references\nto dragons (or water dragons, as Arya is more a creature of water than fire):</p><p><i>Slender\nboats slid in and out among them, <b>wrought\nin the shapes of water serpents with painted heads and upraised tails. Those\nwere not rowed but poled, she saw, by men who stood at their sterns in cloaks\nof grey and brown and deep moss green.</b></i> \u2013 Arya, ACOK</p><p>The men wear cloaks of \u201cgrey\u201d, \u201cbrown\nand deep moss green\u201d \u2013 Arya\u2019s colors. Grey is a color of house Stark. Arya thinks\nof herself as an \u201coak tree\u201d in ASOS after being garbed in brown socking and a\ngreen dress (and seems to associate with trees in general). Back in the\nRiverlands, she tries to find her way North by the \u201cway\u201d the moss grows on\ntrees. Several times. </p><p><i>\u00a0</i><i>The\nmists gave way before them, ragged grey curtains parted by their prow. The\nTitan\u2019s Daughter cleaved through the grey-green waters on <b>billowing purple wings</b>.</i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><i>Two\ngalleys had come out to meet them. <b>They\nseemed to skim upon the water like dragonflies,</b> their pale oars flashing. - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>Arya\u2019s \u201cNeedle\u201d: in ACOK, Rhaegal\u2019s\nteeth are compared to needles: </p><p><i>Beneath\nDany\u2019s gentle fingers, green Rhaegal stared at the stranger with eyes of molten\ngold. When his mouth opened, <b>his teeth\ngleamed like black needles</b>.</i>\n\u2013 Daenerys, ACOK</p><p>But as we said, that part of Arya\nremains dormant for now. In AGOT, we get Doreah\u2019s story about the origins of\ndragons: the moon was an egg, it came too close to the sun, cracked open, and\ndragons poured from it. Fast forward to Arya\u2019s POV chapters in AFFC, where the\nmoon is omnipresent:</p><p><i>That\nis the Temple of the Moonsingers.\u201c</i></p><p><i> It was one of those that Arya had spied from\nthe lagoon, a <b>mighty mass of snow-white\nmarble topped by a huge silvered dome whose milk glass windows showed all the\nphases of the moon</b>. A pair of <b>marble\nmaidens </b>flanked its gates, tall as the Sealords, supporting a\ncrescent-shaped lintel. - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><i>\"All\nmen must serve.\u201d And so she did, three days of every thirty. <b>When the moon was black</b> she was no one,\na servant of the Many-Faced God in a robe of black and white. She walked beside\nthe kindly man through the fragrant darkness, carrying her iron lantern. She\nwashed the dead, went through their clothes, and counted out their coins. Some\ndays she still helped Umma cook, chopping big white mushrooms and boning fish. <b>But only when the moon was black. </b></i></p><p>(\u2026)</p><p><i>One\ntime, when Brea took to her bed with her <b>moon\nblood</b>, Cat had pushed her barrow to the Purple Harbor to sell crabs and\nprawns to oarsmen off the Sealord\u2019s pleasure barge, covered stem to stern with\nlaughing faces. Other days she followed the sweetwater river to the <b>Moon Pool</b>. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>And speaking of menstrual blood, it\u2019s\nbrought up again later in Cat\u2019s chapter:</p><p><i>The\nother whores said that the Sailor\u2019s Wife visited the Isle of the Gods on the\ndays <b>when her flower was in bloom</b>,\nand knew all the gods who lived there, even the ones that Braavos had\nforgotten. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>The moon is obviously linked with\nfeminity and fertility here: as the kindly man tells Arya when she first sets\nfoot in the House of Black and White, \u201c<i>Many\nhave served Him of Many Faces through the centuries, but only a few of His\nservants have been women. Women bring life into the world. We bring the gift of\ndeath.</i>\u201d (Arya, AFFC) Hence, Arya only returns there when the moon is black (when her\nfeminity \u201cdisappears\u201d). Cat\u2019s life at the canals revolves around the moon\u2019s cycle:\nBrea\u2019s moon blood brings Cat at Purple Harbor and to the Moon Pool. The black\nmoon brings her to the House of Black and White. Notice that Cat doesn\u2019t sell\nclams and oysters and cockles in Purple Harbor. She sells the bigger, fancier\nfish, the kind that doesn\u2019t hide inside shells. Each time the moon \u201cbleeds\u201d,\nCat gets a bit closer to hatching. Then, around the end of the chapter, we get\nthis:</p><p><b><i>The swollen red sun hung in the sky</i></b><i>\nbehind the row of masts when Cat took her leave of the Happy Port, with a <b>plump purse of coins</b> and a barrow empty\nbut for salt and seaweed. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s just me overthinking it,\nbut \u201cswollen red sun\u201d reminds me awfully of a pregnant woman\u2019s belly, one that\u2019s\nnearly full to burst, like the \u201cplump purse of coins\u201d Cat carries. We also had\nan \u201cinjured\u201d (swollen/bruised), blood red sun in AGOT, the night Daenerys\nmiscarried Rhaego: </p><p><i>Outside,\nthe <b>sun was low</b> on the horizon, the\nsky a <b>bruised red</b>.</i> \u2013 Daenerys, AGOT</p><p>And this would\u2019ve been the moment\nwhere Daenerys and Arya slipped. Daenerys\u2019s mistake was believing that she was\nsacrificing a <i>horse </i>in exchange for her\nhusband\u2019s life. Arya\u2019s mistake was killing Dareon: </p><p><i>\u201cDareon\nis dead. The black singer who was sleeping at the Happy Port. He was really a\ndeserter from the Night\u2019s Watch.

Maybe he would be angry with her, or maybe he would\nbe pleased that she had given the singer the gift of the Many-Faced God.

But she had never thought <b>warm\nmilk.</b></i></p><p> <i>When the\nmilk came, Arya drank it down. <b>It\nsmelled a little burnt and had a bitter aftertaste.</b></i> \u2013 Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>Basically, this is Arya\u2019s first \u201cfailed\u201d\nhatching. Milk is a liquid strongly linked to motherhood. Here, the milk is\nspoiled, which may or may not indicate a failed attempt at giving birth. </p><p>Overall, where Daenerys is a mother\nfigure, Arya is the child, the dragon hatchling looking <i>for </i>her mother:</p><p><i>It\nwas the other dream she hated, the one where she had two feet instead of four.\nIn that one <b>she was always looking for\nher mother, stumbling through a wasted land of mud and blood and fire</b>. It\nwas always raining in that dream, and she could hear her mother screaming, but\na monster with a dog\u2019s head would not let her go save her.</i> \u2013 Arya, AFFC</p><p>Perhaps it\u2019s not a coincidence that\nDany and Drogon are separated from each other around roughly the same time\nwhere Arya dreams of her mother at the Red Wedding. Perhaps it\u2019s not a coincidence\nthat Arya\u2019s looking for her mother in a \u201cwasted land of mud and blood and fire\u201d,\nwhereas Drogon was born in blood, fire, and right by the Red Waste.

                "content": "<p><p>In a previous post<b>&nbsp;(&ldquo;The scrub&rdquo;),</b> I briefly mentioned that Arya&rsquo;s story arc in ACOK\n(and ASOS, to some extent) had some Noah&rsquo;s arch elements to it. I won&rsquo;t dig too\nfar into it since&nbsp;others discussed this before. However, I&rsquo;d\nlike to expand on another biblical myth perhaps found in Arya&rsquo;s storyline &ndash;\nthis time in Braavos (then I&rsquo;ll get to the dragon stuff). </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s POV in AFFC opens with her\naboard the <i>Titan&rsquo;s Daughter</i>, as they\napproach the Isles of Braavos and must pass beneath the giant statue of the <i>Titan of Braavos</i>: </p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink\nflesh of little highborn girls</b>,&rdquo; Nan would end, and Sansa would give a\nstupid squeak. But Maester Luwin said the Titan was only a statue, and Old\nNan&rsquo;s stories were only stories.</i></p><p>(&hellip;)</p><p><i>&ldquo;I\nhope your Titan isn&rsquo;t hungry,&rdquo; Arya told him.</i></p><p><i> &ldquo;Hungry?&rdquo; Denyo said, confused.</i></p><p><i> &ldquo;It takes no matter.&rdquo; <b>Even if the Titan did eat juicy pink girl\nflesh, Arya would not fear him. She was a scrawny thing, no proper meal for a\ngiant,</b> and almost eleven, practically a woman grown</i></p><p>(&hellip;)</p><p><i>Wind\nand wave had the Titan&rsquo;s Daughter hard in hand now, driving her swiftly toward\nthe channel. Her double bank of oars stroked smoothly, lashing the sea to white\nfoam as the Titan&rsquo;s shadow fell upon them. For a moment it seemed as though\nthey must surely smash up against the stones beneath his legs. Huddled by Denyo\nat the prow, Arya could taste salt where the spray had touched her face. She\nhad to look straight up to see the Titan&rsquo;s head. <b>&ldquo;The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn\ngirls,&rdquo; she heard Old Nan say again, </b>but she was not a little girl,\nand she would not be frightened of a stupid statue. - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>Arya keeps remembering Old Nan&rsquo;s\ntale about the Titan&rsquo;s eating &ldquo;habits&rdquo;, and even after they&rsquo;ve sailed behind it,\nthe danger of being &ldquo;devoured&rdquo; still linger: </p><p><i>&ldquo;The\nArsenal of Braavos,&rdquo; Denyo named it, as proud as if he&rsquo;d built it.\n&ldquo;They can build a war galley there in a day.&rdquo; Arya could see dozens\nof galleys tied up at quays and perched on launching slips. The painted prows\nof others poked from innumerable wooden sheds along the stony shores, <b>like hounds in a kennel, lean and mean and\nhungry</b>, waiting for a hunter&rsquo;s horn to call them forth.</i></p><p>(&hellip;)</p><p><b><i>The mouths </i></b><i>of\nlesser canals<b> opened to either side,</b>\nand others still smaller off of those. - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>That&rsquo;s because Arya really is being\n(symbolically) swallowed by something here. The parallels with &ldquo;Jonah and the\nwhale&rdquo; become a bit more apparent with these:</p><p><i>The\ngalleys passed to either side of them, so close that <b>she could hear the muffled sound of drums from within their purple\nhulls, bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom, like the beat of living hearts</b>.</i></p><p>(Where we get the impression that\nArya&rsquo;s inside some giant living creature)</p><p>&amp;</p><p><i>A\nharbor was visible off to her right, a tangle of piers and quays crowded with <b>big-bellied <strike>whales</strike> whalers</b> out\nof Ibben - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>It&rsquo;s interesting, because Arya&rsquo;s\nPOV chapters in ACOK open with her wishing that King&rsquo;s Landing would flood. During\nher travels in the Riverlands with Gendry, Lommy and Hot Pie, the rain pours nonstop,\neffectively causing a flood. In AFFC, she finds herself in the flooded city of\nBraavos &ndash; </p><p><i>Another\nharbor, more distant, was off to her left, <b>beyond\na sinking point of land where the tops of half-drowned buildings thrust\nthemselves above the water.</b> Arya had never seen so many big buildings all\ntogether in one place. King&rsquo;s Landing had the Red Keep and the Great Sept of\nBaelor and the Dragonpit -&nbsp;</i>Arya, AFFC</p><p> &ndash; only this time, her life jacket isn&rsquo;t a boat\n(Noah&rsquo;s arch), it&rsquo;s a whale&rsquo;s belly. </p><p>The thing with being inside a &ldquo;whale&rsquo;s\nbelly&rdquo; is, it allows Arya to go unseen. The myth itself is generally considered\na metaphor of rebirth (which I&rsquo;ll get to in a moment), but the whale&rsquo;s belly\nalso provides safety and secrecy while traveling. When Cat of the canals start\nselling oysters, clams and cockles, she can go anywhere she wants:</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oysters,\nclams, and cockles&rdquo; were Cat&rsquo;s magic words, and <b>like all good magic words they could take her almost anywhere. </b>She\nhad boarded ships from Lys and Oldtown and the Port of Ibben and sold her\noysters right on deck.</i>\n(&hellip;)<i> One time, when Brea took to her bed\nwith her moon blood, Cat had pushed her barrow to the Purple Harbor to sell\ncrabs and prawns to oarsmen off the Sealord&rsquo;s pleasure barge, covered stem to\nstern with laughing faces. Other days she followed the sweetwater river to the\nMoon Pool. </i>(&hellip;)<i> But she always\nreturned to the Ragman&rsquo;s Harbor. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>We see here that the &ldquo;whale&rsquo;s belly&rdquo;\ncan take other forms; i.e., a bivalve&rsquo;s shell (hiding in a belly vs hiding in a\nshell). Indeed, there&rsquo;s some textual clues here and there linking Cat to what&rsquo;s\ninside said shell(s):</p><p><i>Farther\ndown the docks she came on Tagganaro sitting with his back against a piling,\nnext to Casso, King of Seals. He bought some mussels from her, and Casso barked\nand let her shake his flipper. <b>&ldquo;You\ncome work with me, Cat,&rdquo; urged Tagganaro as he was sucking mussels from\ntheir shells.</b> He had been looking for a new partner ever since the Drunken\nDaughter put her knife through Little Narbo&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;<b>I give you more than Brusco,</b> and you would not smell like\nfish.&rdquo;</i></p><p>(&hellip;)</p><p><i>&ldquo;Which\none was this, now? <b>The Queen o&rsquo; Cockles,\nwas it?</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> &ldquo;<b>The\nBlack Pearl</b>,&rdquo; she told them. Merry claimed the Black Pearl was the\nmost famous courtesan of all. &ldquo;<b>She&rsquo;s\ndescended from the dragons, that one</b>,&rdquo; the woman had told Cat. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>In the first citation, we have\nTagganaro trying to &ldquo;slurp&rdquo; Cat from her shell, same as he&rsquo;s doing with his mussels,\nand in the second, the &ldquo;Queen o&rsquo;Cokles&rdquo; (a courtesan, but it could also be\napplied to Cat, oddly, especially since moments before Cat was asked by another\nsailor how much she wanted for the &ldquo;cockle between her legs&rdquo;), named after what&rsquo;s\nfound inside cockles (pearls). The &ldquo;Black Pearl&rdquo;, actually, symbolizes <strike>Arya</strike>\nCat very well here, because that&rsquo;s essentially what she is (a black pearl hidden\ninside a shell/a princess hidden inside a whale&rsquo;s belly). </p><p>Which brings me to my third tinfoil\nword cake: any other &ldquo;black pearl&rdquo; inside its shell in asoiaf? How about Drogon&rsquo;s\negg? </p><p><i>She\nchewed on her lip, hoping. <b>If I had\nwings I could fly back to Winterfell and see for myself. And if it was true,\nI&rsquo;d just fly away, fly up past the moon and the shining stars, and see all the\nthings in Old Nan&rsquo;s stories, dragons and sea monsters and the Titan of Braavos,\nand maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t ever fly back unless I wanted to.</b></i> &ndash; Arya, ACOK</p><p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned before that the\nstory of Jonas and the whale was generally accepted as a metaphor for rebirth. In<b>&nbsp;&ldquo;The scrub&rdquo;</b>, I talked about the\nparallels between the hatching of Dany&rsquo;s dragons, Dany&rsquo;s metaphorical rebirth,\nand Arya&rsquo;s rebirth beneath the burning shed. I think Arya is a dragon-like figure:\nshe&rsquo;s dangerous, deadly and magical. And she hasn&rsquo;t hatched yet. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s admit right off the bat that\nthere&rsquo;s something witchy about Arya, even if we disregard the whole faceless\nman thing: in AGOT, she has this thing with a black cat. In Harrenhal, ACOK,\nshe practices sword fighting with a broomstick. Eats worm. Think of herself as\nthe &ldquo;ghost of Harrenhal&rdquo;. Mingles with brews and potions (starting with the conspicuous\n&ldquo;weasel soup&rdquo; in Harrenhal, then at the House of Black and White with the waif).\nDoes most of her &ldquo;mischiefs&rdquo; at night. In ADWD, the waif gives her a face with\na wart that sprouts black hairs. </p><p>And shaves her head, too, like a\ncertain someone named &ldquo;Egg&rdquo;. </p><p>Then there&rsquo;s some interesting references\nto dragons (or water dragons, as Arya is more a creature of water than fire):</p><p><i>Slender\nboats slid in and out among them, <b>wrought\nin the shapes of water serpents with painted heads and upraised tails. Those\nwere not rowed but poled, she saw, by men who stood at their sterns in cloaks\nof grey and brown and deep moss green.</b></i> &ndash; Arya, ACOK</p><p>The men wear cloaks of &ldquo;grey&rdquo;, &ldquo;brown\nand deep moss green&rdquo; &ndash; Arya&rsquo;s colors. Grey is a color of house Stark. Arya thinks\nof herself as an &ldquo;oak tree&rdquo; in ASOS after being garbed in brown socking and a\ngreen dress (and seems to associate with trees in general). Back in the\nRiverlands, she tries to find her way North by the &ldquo;way&rdquo; the moss grows on\ntrees. Several times. </p><p><i>&nbsp;</i><i>The\nmists gave way before them, ragged grey curtains parted by their prow. The\nTitan&rsquo;s Daughter cleaved through the grey-green waters on <b>billowing purple wings</b>.</i></p><p>(&hellip;)</p><p><i>Two\ngalleys had come out to meet them. <b>They\nseemed to skim upon the water like dragonflies,</b> their pale oars flashing. - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s &ldquo;Needle&rdquo;: in ACOK, Rhaegal&rsquo;s\nteeth are compared to needles: </p><p><i>Beneath\nDany&rsquo;s gentle fingers, green Rhaegal stared at the stranger with eyes of molten\ngold. When his mouth opened, <b>his teeth\ngleamed like black needles</b>.</i>\n&ndash; Daenerys, ACOK</p><p>But as we said, that part of Arya\nremains dormant for now. In AGOT, we get Doreah&rsquo;s story about the origins of\ndragons: the moon was an egg, it came too close to the sun, cracked open, and\ndragons poured from it. Fast forward to Arya&rsquo;s POV chapters in AFFC, where the\nmoon is omnipresent:</p><p><i>That\nis the Temple of the Moonsingers.&ldquo;</i></p><p><i> It was one of those that Arya had spied from\nthe lagoon, a <b>mighty mass of snow-white\nmarble topped by a huge silvered dome whose milk glass windows showed all the\nphases of the moon</b>. A pair of <b>marble\nmaidens </b>flanked its gates, tall as the Sealords, supporting a\ncrescent-shaped lintel. - </i>Arya, AFFC</p><p>(&hellip;)</p><p><i>\"All\nmen must serve.&rdquo; And so she did, three days of every thirty. <b>When the moon was black</b> she was no one,\na servant of the Many-Faced God in a robe of black and white. She walked beside\nthe kindly man through the fragrant darkness, carrying her iron lantern. She\nwashed the dead, went through their clothes, and counted out their coins. Some\ndays she still helped Umma cook, chopping big white mushrooms and boning fish. <b>But only when the moon was black. </b></i></p><p>(&hellip;)</p><p><i>One\ntime, when Brea took to her bed with her <b>moon\nblood</b>, Cat had pushed her barrow to the Purple Harbor to sell crabs and\nprawns to oarsmen off the Sealord&rsquo;s pleasure barge, covered stem to stern with\nlaughing faces. Other days she followed the sweetwater river to the <b>Moon Pool</b>. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>And speaking of menstrual blood, it&rsquo;s\nbrought up again later in Cat&rsquo;s chapter:</p><p><i>The\nother whores said that the Sailor&rsquo;s Wife visited the Isle of the Gods on the\ndays <b>when her flower was in bloom</b>,\nand knew all the gods who lived there, even the ones that Braavos had\nforgotten. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>The moon is obviously linked with\nfeminity and fertility here: as the kindly man tells Arya when she first sets\nfoot in the House of Black and White, &ldquo;<i>Many\nhave served Him of Many Faces through the centuries, but only a few of His\nservants have been women. Women bring life into the world. We bring the gift of\ndeath.</i>&rdquo; (Arya, AFFC) Hence, Arya only returns there when the moon is black (when her\nfeminity &ldquo;disappears&rdquo;). Cat&rsquo;s life at the canals revolves around the moon&rsquo;s cycle:\nBrea&rsquo;s moon blood brings Cat at Purple Harbor and to the Moon Pool. The black\nmoon brings her to the House of Black and White. Notice that Cat doesn&rsquo;t sell\nclams and oysters and cockles in Purple Harbor. She sells the bigger, fancier\nfish, the kind that doesn&rsquo;t hide inside shells. Each time the moon &ldquo;bleeds&rdquo;,\nCat gets a bit closer to hatching. Then, around the end of the chapter, we get\nthis:</p><p><b><i>The swollen red sun hung in the sky</i></b><i>\nbehind the row of masts when Cat took her leave of the Happy Port, with a <b>plump purse of coins</b> and a barrow empty\nbut for salt and seaweed. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just me overthinking it,\nbut &ldquo;swollen red sun&rdquo; reminds me awfully of a pregnant woman&rsquo;s belly, one that&rsquo;s\nnearly full to burst, like the &ldquo;plump purse of coins&rdquo; Cat carries. We also had\nan &ldquo;injured&rdquo; (swollen/bruised), blood red sun in AGOT, the night Daenerys\nmiscarried Rhaego: </p><p><i>Outside,\nthe <b>sun was low</b> on the horizon, the\nsky a <b>bruised red</b>.</i> &ndash; Daenerys, AGOT</p><p>And this would&rsquo;ve been the moment\nwhere Daenerys and Arya slipped. Daenerys&rsquo;s mistake was believing that she was\nsacrificing a <i>horse </i>in exchange for her\nhusband&rsquo;s life. Arya&rsquo;s mistake was killing Dareon: </p><p><i>&ldquo;Dareon\nis dead. The black singer who was sleeping at the Happy Port. He was really a\ndeserter from the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Someone slit his throat and pushed him into a\ncanal, but they kept his boots.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> &ldquo;Good boots are hard to find.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> &ldquo;Just so.&rdquo; She tried to keep her\nface still.</i></p><p><i> &ldquo;Who could have done this thing, I\nwonder?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> &ldquo;Arya of House Stark.&rdquo; She watched\nhis eyes, his mouth, the muscles of his jaw. - </i>Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>Daenerys and Arya are both given a\nbitter, milky beverage to drink:</p><p><i>She\ntasted sour milk, and something else, something thick and bitter.</i> &ndash; Daenerys, AGOT</p><p><i>On\nher way across the city Arya had wondered what the kindly man would say when\nshe told him about Dareon. Maybe he would be angry with her, or maybe he would\nbe pleased that she had given the singer the gift of the Many-Faced God. She\nhad played this talk out in her head half a hundred times, like a mummer in a\nshow. But she had never thought <b>warm\nmilk.</b></i></p><p> <i>When the\nmilk came, Arya drank it down. <b>It\nsmelled a little burnt and had a bitter aftertaste.</b></i> &ndash; Cat of the canals, AFFC</p><p>Basically, this is Arya&rsquo;s first &ldquo;failed&rdquo;\nhatching. Milk is a liquid strongly linked to motherhood. Here, the milk is\nspoiled, which may or may not indicate a failed attempt at giving birth. </p><p>Overall, where Daenerys is a mother\nfigure, Arya is the child, the dragon hatchling looking <i>for </i>her mother:</p><p><i>It\nwas the other dream she hated, the one where she had two feet instead of four.\nIn that one <b>she was always looking for\nher mother, stumbling through a wasted land of mud and blood and fire</b>. It\nwas always raining in that dream, and she could hear her mother screaming, but\na monster with a dog&rsquo;s head would not let her go save her.</i> &ndash; Arya, AFFC</p><p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s not a coincidence that\nDany and Drogon are separated from each other around roughly the same time\nwhere Arya dreams of her mother at the Red Wedding. Perhaps it&rsquo;s not a coincidence\nthat Arya&rsquo;s looking for her mother in a &ldquo;wasted land of mud and blood and fire&rdquo;,\nwhereas Drogon was born in blood, fire, and right by the Red Waste. This is all\nvery intriguing. But anyway, I&rsquo;ll conclude for now with a quote from our\nfavorite witches and wizards&rsquo; story: </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Never tickle a sleeping\ndragon&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b></b></p><figure data-tumblr-attribution=\"daeneryskairipa:WUTmvQiJ8H8qkAViOoXd7Q:ZQifVs2P3g4tr\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-attribution=\"daeneryskairipa:WUTmvQiJ8H8qkAViOoXd7Q:ZQifVs2P3g4tr\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",

        "body": "<h1>A non-shippers unbiased Jon-sa/erys opinion&hellip;</h1><p>Okay, I know I\u2019m not completely unbiased here, becasue I\u2019m not much of a Dany fan (and won\u2019t be until she starts being honest about her intentions). BUT since all of my shipping energy is devoted to Braime and Gendrya I just don\u2019t have anything left for other ships! Because of this I am neither Team Jonsa or Team Jonerys, but it has become such a huge part of the fandom its hard not to form an opinion.\u00a0</p><p>First I think its important to make sure we\u2019re separating our actors from our characters, because while Kit has great chemistry with both Sophie and Emilia, JON has great chemistry with Sansa, but watching him with Dany last season was about as exciting as watching paint dry&hellip;</p><p>I\u2019ll come back to that, but let\u2019s start with Jonsa first:\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m really not here for anymore incest in GoT, and while I know that technically they\u2019re only cousins and not siblings, they were still raised in the same home as half brother and sister, even though they didn\u2019t have much of a relationship in their youth. However, detractors of this ship who use their familial relationship to completely write off the the ship are forgetting a little something&hellip; GRRM. He doesn\u2019t seem to have to have the same compunction about this topic as the anti\u2019s do, in his original outline for the books he had a storyline where Arya (yikes, I can\u2019t even think about it!) and Jon fall in love and are tortured by this love UNTIL they find out about Jon\u2019s true parentage. Now we know he moved on from that storyline, but did he move on, or just pivot? Another part of the original outline was that Arya was going to be part of an unwitting love triangle, as Tyrion, who abandons his family to fight on the side of the Stark&rsquo;s develops feelings for her, albeit unrequited&hellip; now can we think about a different Stark family member that GRRM pivoted a messy, and complicated relationship with Tyrion to? So if he salvaged some semblance of his original outline by transferring plot points to Sansa, its not out of the question that he would do the same for other plot points. Also people who say there\u2019s no canonical evidence for Jonsa are choosing not to pay attention. I mean, you don\u2019t gaze longingly at your\u00a0\u201csister\u2019s\u201d lips, after kissing her on the forehead! Go find the gif, I\u2019m not kidding, he kisses her forehead, looks her in the eye\u2019s then looks down at her lips, and just pauses there! Anti\u2019s you might not want it to happen, but it very possibly could happen\u00a0</p><p>Now, onto Jonerys:\u00a0</p><p>(I know they\u2019re technically related too, but they weren\u2019t raised together, so it doesn\u2019t factor into my opinion, thats just what this ridiculous show has done to me!!) I know I said I\u2019m not much of a Dany fan, but I\u2019m going to put that aside, and just look at the evidence provided to us in the show. I think Jon and Dany\u2019s relationship, as presented in season 7 is legit, meaning I\u2019m not really here for the political!jon theories (not because it\u2019s not an interesting idea, I just don\u2019t think D&amp;D are that creative)&hellip; so, I think Jon comes to care about Dany (yes, even if he also cares for Sansa - you can have feelings for two people at once) and I think Dany\u2019s feelings for Jon are also real. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are end game, it just means that going into the last season we\u2019re going to see from Dany where her true priorities lie. When she learns there is a surviving Targaryen that has a more legitimate claim to the throne than she does (this is putting aside the fact that I don\u2019t think she has a claim at all, nor does Jon for that matter - but that\u2019s a topic for a different post, lol!) this is the moment that will tell us what kind of person Dany is, and will end up being. She\u2019s either going to acknowledge the claim, or fight against it - there\u2019s really no other option. If she fights against it then I don\u2019t exactly see their relationship surviving that? So she\u2019ll have to decide if love or power is what she wants more. Now I think if D&amp;D had 100% say over how the show ends then they\u2019d have Jon, despite learning of his parentage,\u00a0\u201cgive\u201d the throne to Dany, or at least marry her and rule together (I\u2019ve not seen such huge Dany stan\u2019s as D&amp;D since Jorah!!) Dany would be the hero!! But since we know they\u2019re beholden to GRRM\u2019s ending for the books, I think he\u2019s got a little more imagination than that. I don\u2019t know if Dany will go all Mad Queen, I don\u2019t even necessarily think she\u2019d be a bad ruler (though I do agree with Daario that\u2019s she\u2019s more of a conqueror than a ruler, but\u00a0  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af) but I just don\u2019t think GRRM would end his series so predictably. The only reason I think Jon should\u00a0\u201cwin\u201d is becasue he doesn\u2019t want to rule, and in stories like this it\u2019s always the people who have leadership thrust upon them that do the best job, the one\u2019s who rule because its the right thing to do, and not out of a lust for power.

            "comment": "<p><h1>A non-shippers unbiased Jon-sa/erys opinion\u2026</h1><p>Okay, I know I\u2019m not completely unbiased here, becasue I\u2019m not much of a Dany fan (and won\u2019t be until she starts being honest about her intentions). BUT since all of my shipping energy is devoted to Braime and Gendrya I just don\u2019t have anything left for other ships! Because of this I am neither Team Jonsa or Team Jonerys, but it has become such a huge part of the fandom its hard not to form an opinion.\u00a0</p><p>First I think its important to make sure we\u2019re separating our actors from our characters, because while Kit has great chemistry with both Sophie and Emilia, JON has great chemistry with Sansa, but watching him with Dany last season was about as exciting as watching paint dry\u2026</p><p>I\u2019ll come back to that, but let\u2019s start with Jonsa first:\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m really not here for anymore incest in GoT, and while I know that technically they\u2019re only cousins and not siblings, they were still raised in the same home as half brother and sister, even though they didn\u2019t have much of a relationship in their youth. However, detractors of this ship who use their familial relationship to completely write off the the ship are forgetting a little something\u2026 GRRM. He doesn\u2019t seem to have to have the same compunction about this topic as the anti\u2019s do, in his original outline for the books he had a storyline where Arya (yikes, I can\u2019t even think about it!) and Jon fall in love and are tortured by this love UNTIL they find out about Jon\u2019s true parentage. Now we know he moved on from that storyline, but did he move on, or just pivot? Another part of the original outline was that Arya was going to be part of an unwitting love triangle, as Tyrion, who abandons his family to fight on the side of the Stark\u2019s develops feelings for her, albeit unrequited\u2026 now can we think about a different Stark family member that GRRM pivoted a messy, and complicated relationship with Tyrion to? So if he salvaged some semblance of his original outline by transferring plot points to Sansa, its not out of the question that he would do the same for other plot points. Also people who say there\u2019s no canonical evidence for Jonsa are choosing not to pay attention. I mean, you don\u2019t gaze longingly at your\u00a0\u201csister\u2019s\u201d lips, after kissing her on the forehead! Go find the gif, I\u2019m not kidding, he kisses her forehead, looks her in the eye\u2019s then looks down at her lips, and just pauses there! Anti\u2019s you might not want it to happen, but it very possibly could happen\u00a0</p><p>Now, onto Jonerys:\u00a0</p><p>(I know they\u2019re technically related too, but they weren\u2019t raised together, so it doesn\u2019t factor into my opinion, thats just what this ridiculous show has done to me!!) I know I said I\u2019m not much of a Dany fan, but I\u2019m going to put that aside, and just look at the evidence provided to us in the show. I think Jon and Dany\u2019s relationship, as presented in season 7 is legit, meaning I\u2019m not really here for the political!jon theories (not because it\u2019s not an interesting idea, I just don\u2019t think D&amp;D are that creative)\u2026 so, I think Jon comes to care about Dany (yes, even if he also cares for Sansa - you can have feelings for two people at once) and I think Dany\u2019s feelings for Jon are also real. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are end game, it just means that going into the last season we\u2019re going to see from Dany where her true priorities lie. When she learns there is a surviving Targaryen that has a more legitimate claim to the throne than she does (this is putting aside the fact that I don\u2019t think she has a claim at all, nor does Jon for that matter - but that\u2019s a topic for a different post, lol!) this is the moment that will tell us what kind of person Dany is, and will end up being. She\u2019s either going to acknowledge the claim, or fight against it - there\u2019s really no other option. If she fights against it then I don\u2019t exactly see their relationship surviving that? So she\u2019ll have to decide if love or power is what she wants more. Now I think if D&amp;D had 100% say over how the show ends then they\u2019d have Jon, despite learning of his parentage,\u00a0\u201cgive\u201d the throne to Dany, or at least marry her and rule together (I\u2019ve not seen such huge Dany stan\u2019s as D&amp;D since Jorah!!) Dany would be the hero!! But since we know they\u2019re beholden to GRRM\u2019s ending for the books, I think he\u2019s got a little more imagination than that. I don\u2019t know if Dany will go all Mad Queen, I don\u2019t even necessarily think she\u2019d be a bad ruler (though I do agree with Daario that\u2019s she\u2019s more of a conqueror than a ruler, but\u00a0  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af) but I just don\u2019t think GRRM would end his series so predictably. The only reason I think Jon should\u00a0\u201cwin\u201d is becasue he doesn\u2019t want to rule, and in stories like this it\u2019s always the people who have leadership thrust upon them that do the best job, the one\u2019s who rule because its the right thing to do, and not out of a lust for power. By that estimation I\u2019d be just as happy if Sam, or Gendry, or Davos ended up King (actually Davos would make a great King\u2026 side note, this blog is now a Davos for King blog, lol) Okay, I said before I\u2019d get back to the\u00a0\u201cwatching paint dry\u201d comment, and here it it, its true, they were boring!

As has been painfully obvious over the last two seasons, D&amp;D/Cogman\u2019s version of\u00a0 empowered, true leader Sansa is a character who picks a fight with everyone because she knows best. That\u2019s their version of bad-ass Sansa. <br/></p><p>Everyone was excited about Jon and Sansa reuniting in season 6. But that soon leads to Sansa lying to Jon, keeping important information from him and arguing with him about every single decision he makes. Everyone was excited about the Stark sisters reuniting in season 7 and it being all about the sisterhood etc. - and then D&amp;D decided to write Arya threatening Sansa and Sansa going so far as to nearly execute her sister until she realized that LF was playing her. Considering that Sansa could not get along with either Jon or Arya in seasons 6 and 7, do people really think that she is going to be besties with Danaerys Targaryen in season 8? <br/></p><p>I think we have enough hints that Dany and Sansa are going to clash next season. D&amp;D\u2019s random comparison of Dany executing two strangers with Sansa executing her mentor of 7 seasons in the DVD commentary for the season 7 finale indicates that we are going to get some cringy writing for Dany next season as she faces off against Sansa. Jon and Arya fans have already sat through some shitty writing for our faves as Sansa was propped up at their expense. Expect the same for Dany next season. <br/></p><p>Then we have the EW article which also indicates that these two characters are going to feud:</p><blockquote><p>\n<b>How these fan favorites get along drives much of the drama this season \n</b>(okay, here\u2019s one specific tease from the premiere \u2014 <b>Sansa isn\u2019t \nthrilled that Jon bent the knee to his fancy new Targaryen girlfriend, \n</b>at least not at first).\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>I am pretty certain that Sansa is going to have an issue with Jon bending the knee until the Army of the dead gets there and everyone realizes what the real priority is. LF dying last season does not mean that all the issues Sansa has with Jon is going to magically go away. As per Sophie turner:</p><blockquote><p>\n<b>How will Sansa fare next season without Littlefinger in her ear?</b><br/>\nIt\u2019s going to be tricky for her, because at the end of last season, <b>she \nfelt that she had everything set up. She had her family back together. </b>\n<b>They were in control of the North again. This season, there\u2019s a new \nthreat, and all of a sudden she finds herself somewhat back in the deep \nend. </b>And without Littlefinger, it\u2019s a test for her of whether she can \nget through it. It\u2019s a big challenge for her, without this master \nmanipulator having her back. This season is more a passionate fight for \nher than a political, manipulative kind of fight.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/game-of-thrones-sophie-turner-season-8-premiere-date-1202632602/\">https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/game-of-thrones-sophie-turner-season-8-premiere-date-1202632602/</a><br/></p><p>Sansa already knows about the WW and Cersei. So what new threat is she talking about here? Unlike Jon and the rest of the Starks, Sansa has been all about being in charge of the North over the last two seasons. And Dany - a foreign Targaryen is now going to control the North. I doubt the show Sansa that we have seen is going to be pleased about this. I think the new threat that Sophie is talking about here is Dany. <br/></p><p>As per the EW article, Tyrion seems to be the character trying to keep everyone focused on the goal at hand:</p><blockquote><p>Tyrion Lannister will try to maintain an uneasy multi-house alliance as they face off against the Army of the Dead<br/></p></blockquote><p>Tyrion seems like the right character to try to make peace between Sansa and Dany considering both characters seem to respect his intellect and he is a Lannister fighting for a Targaryen. I am guessing that the first two episodes will be full of drama and conflict as these characters fight over the business of who should rule whom until the AOTD attack in episode 3. <br/></p><p>If Dany fans are looking forward to her bonding with a Stark sibling, I don\u2019t think they should be counting on show Sansa or show Bran who is now all about being the 3ER. They should be looking at Arya. Mainly because, as we saw last season on the show, Arya trusts Jon implicitly. She stands up for Jon when Sansa complains and was prepared to chop off some heads when the lords speak treason against him. As Sansa herself says, when she was discussing deposing Jon with LF, Arya would chose Jon. If Jon vouches for Dany, then Arya would be okay with her and if Jon thinks that bending the knee was the right decision, Arya would support him on that. Like Jon, Arya is not fanatical about who gets to rule the North. <br/></p><p>Besides, Arya and Dany have much in common. A propensity to help the weak and powerless in society, a desire to hand out justice and avenge injustice, Arya\u2019s fascination with dragons and admiration for Visenya etc. I am sure they will find much to like about each once they get to know each other. <br/></p><p>So it\u2019s most likely that we see Sansa being angry at Jon/Dany, then Jaime gets there and everyone is pissed at him and then Dany starts getting angry at everyone else with Tyrion/Jon trying to maintain the peace.

As has been painfully obvious over the last two seasons, D&amp;D/Cogman\u2019s version of\u00a0 empowered, true leader Sansa is a character who picks a fight with everyone because she knows best. That\u2019s their version of bad-ass Sansa. <br></p><p>Everyone was excited about Jon and Sansa reuniting in season 6. But that soon leads to Sansa lying to Jon, keeping important information from him and arguing with him about every single decision he makes. Everyone was excited about the Stark sisters reuniting in season 7 and it being all about the sisterhood etc. - and then D&amp;D decided to write Arya threatening Sansa and Sansa going so far as to nearly execute her sister until she realized that LF was playing her. Considering that Sansa could not get along with either Jon or Arya in seasons 6 and 7, do people really think that she is going to be besties with Danaerys Targaryen in season 8? <br></p><p>I think we have enough hints that Dany and Sansa are going to clash next season. D&amp;D\u2019s random comparison of Dany executing two strangers with Sansa executing her mentor of 7 seasons in the DVD commentary for the season 7 finale indicates that we are going to get some cringy writing for Dany next season as she faces off against Sansa. Jon and Arya fans have already sat through some shitty writing for our faves as Sansa was propped up at their expense. Expect the same for Dany next season. <br></p><p>Then we have the EW article which also indicates that these two characters are going to feud:</p><blockquote><p>\n<b>How these fan favorites get along drives much of the drama this season \n</b>(okay, here\u2019s one specific tease from the premiere \u2014 <b>Sansa isn\u2019t \nthrilled that Jon bent the knee to his fancy new Targaryen girlfriend, \n</b>at least not at first).\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>I am pretty certain that Sansa is going to have an issue with Jon bending the knee until the Army of the dead gets there and everyone realizes what the real priority is. LF dying last season does not mean that all the issues Sansa has with Jon is going to magically go away. As per Sophie turner:</p><blockquote><p>\n<b>How will Sansa fare next season without Littlefinger in her ear?</b><br>\nIt\u2019s going to be tricky for her, because at the end of last season, <b>she \nfelt that she had everything set up. She had her family back together. </b>\n<b>They were in control of the North again. This season, there\u2019s a new \nthreat, and all of a sudden she finds herself somewhat back in the deep \nend. </b>And without Littlefinger, it\u2019s a test for her of whether she can \nget through it. It\u2019s a big challenge for her, without this master \nmanipulator having her back.

So what new threat is she talking about here? Unlike Jon and the rest of the Starks, Sansa has been all about being in charge of the North over the last two seasons. And Dany - a foreign Targaryen is now going to control the North. I doubt the show Sansa that we have seen is going to be pleased about this. I think the new threat that Sophie is talking about here is Dany. <br></p><p>As per the EW article, Tyrion seems to be the character trying to keep everyone focused on the goal at hand:</p><blockquote><p>Tyrion Lannister will try to maintain an uneasy multi-house alliance as they face off against the Army of the Dead<br></p></blockquote><p>Tyrion seems like the right character to try to make peace between Sansa and Dany considering both characters seem to respect his intellect and he is a Lannister fighting for a Targaryen. I am guessing that the first two episodes will be full of drama and conflict as these characters fight over the business of who should rule whom until the AOTD attack in episode 3. <br></p><p>If Dany fans are looking forward to her bonding with a Stark sibling, I don\u2019t think they should be counting on show Sansa or show Bran who is now all about being the 3ER. They should be looking at Arya. Mainly because, as we saw last season on the show, Arya trusts Jon implicitly. She stands up for Jon when Sansa complains and was prepared to chop off some heads when the lords speak treason against him. As Sansa herself says, when she was discussing deposing Jon with LF, Arya would chose Jon. If Jon vouches for Dany, then Arya would be okay with her and if Jon thinks that bending the knee was the right decision, Arya would support him on that. Like Jon, Arya is not fanatical about who gets to rule the North. <br></p><p>Besides, Arya and Dany have much in common. A propensity to help the weak and powerless in society, a desire to hand out justice and avenge injustice, Arya\u2019s fascination with dragons and admiration for Visenya etc. I am sure they will find much to like about each once they get to know each other. <br></p><p>So it\u2019s most likely that we see Sansa being angry at Jon/Dany, then Jaime gets there and everyone is pissed at him and then Dany starts getting angry at everyone else with Tyrion/Jon trying to maintain the peace.
