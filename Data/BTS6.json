I know, some of you told me you wanted her to be with Nam but in my mind, she can only love Hobi.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t he deserve all the love in the world, our little sunshine? (Yes ok, Nam too). Anyway, have fun reading it. Tell me what you thought of this serie if you want, or not. It\u2019s up to you! Here it is.</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"ariescults-moved:MmIQye2V7xjTFNoGrRqYZQ:ZN7wfd2Tt4oEY\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"512\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a5e75cd0cf34ab8510069bf3673f3023/tumblr_p2afmtGGV21ws9xlgo1_500.gif\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"512\"/></figure><p><b><br/></b></p><p>You have to admit, your day was amazing. \u00a0First day with so many smiles and laughter in a long time. It had started with a little physiotherapy session for your leg, which hurt to be honest but it has to be done. You are happy to be able to walk for long distances now, to dance almost like before, to move normally. There will be always 2 movements that you won\u2019t be able to do with your ankle: inversion and eversion. Those movements are impossible because of the metal plates and screw that keeps your bones together. Those impossible movements are the ones that will keep you away from the stage forever. You\u2019ll have to live with it, you have no other choice. But it\u2019s ok, you will find a way, your way.</p><p>Then you had a lunch date with Nam. He brought you to a little Japanese restaurant with sliding paper doors, painted with pink flowers and japanese script. You\u2019ve drink tea and eat fancy food, talked about life just like you always do. \u00a0Having a conversation with him is always interesting. He\u2019s so brilliant and the way he sees things is often like you so, you just complete each other\u2019s opinion. It makes your conversation mutually rewarding and enriching. You talked philosophy and exchanged your thoughts on politic and on \u201cthe Seungri case\u201d. \u00a0You also laughed and behaved like children, foolishly challenging each other (the one who drinks his hot tea the quickest, the one who eats the slowest, who will be able to put the word \u00abpoop emoji\u00bb in the conversation with the waitress, etc). He walked back with you to your place after a 2 hours meal, kissed your cheeks before leaving and add \u201cgood luck for your conversation with Hobi tonight\u201d before turning around on his feets and leaved with a beautiful dimple smile. You didn\u2019t talk about it with him, Hobi probably did.</p><!-- more --><p>This afternoon at 16h00, you haven\u2019t told anybody about it but, you had a meeting with the rector of the Seoul university. He offered you a one year contract, starting right now if you want because you can work from home. Your task would be to assist the teachers of the modern dance department by being the second evaluator of the students examinations. Basically, you wouldn\u2019t be in direct contact with students for now, just watching videos of their choreography and attribute them a score that will count for 50% of their marks on each evaluations, basically a good responsibility. You haven\u2019t decided yet, you don\u2019t know what you will do to be honest. It\u2019s a good job with good conditions and it keeps your passion for dance alive. You are just scared that you\u2019ll find it boring, the fact that you are not directly in the dance studio, where the action is. You will need to analyse it with Taemin, his opinion matters to you.</p><p>When you arrived home, you took a long shower, washed your hair, put on some loose pants and a t-shirt of your brother, placed your hair on the top of your head with in a messy bun and stayed bareface. Hoseok had texted you, wondering if you had eaten, offering to bring something on his way to your place. You agreed, sometimes it\u2019s easier to talk with a table between you.</p><p>You were so nervous to meet him, nervous about the things he had to say. According to him, there are things he needs to tell you that will hurt you. A lot of things have hurt you recently. As they say, you had to hit rock bottom. The only way you can go now, is up. </p><p>Waiting for Hoseok, you sat down to meditate for a few minutes but you have probably fell asleep because suddenly, the buzz of the intercom woke you up. </p><p>\u201cMiss Jeon, there is a man named Jung Hoseok here, may I let him in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you may ajussi. Thank you\u201d.</p><p>You have almost 2 minutes before Hoseok will reach your apartment. You take that time to nervously brush your teeth, use a washcloth of cold water on your face and apply some mascara. You have no more time to redo your hair, you can hear 3 light knock on the door. </p><p>\u201cGood evening y/n\u201d, he says with a sad smile.</p><p>\u201cHi Hobi\u201d.</p><p>As you can see his sadness and his tiredness, you take a step back to look at him from head to toes. You want to analyse every single detail, to make sure he\u2019s not sick or something. He has a big houseplant in one hand, a gift bag in another one and a take-out food. </p><p>\u201cMay I come in?\u201d He asked, smiling shyly. Hoseok being shy, you see him more and more like that recently but you can\u2019t get use to it. He\u2019s so beautiful with that timid smile that your heart beat faster.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, I have no manners, of course you can come in\u201d. You moved to the side to let him enter. He looked everywhere and smiled brightly.</p><p>\u201cThis place looks peaceful, I love it. May I have a visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, have a view while I take care of the take out. It smells Tha\u00ef food, Mmmmm. Come in the kitchen just over there when you are done\u201d, you said, pointing in the good direction.</p><p>He placed the gifs on the little table by the door and started to visit right away. He talked to you on his way to the living room.</p><p>\u00abYou are not afraid I will discover some of your secrets? Or that I will steal something?\u00bb</p><p>\u00abNo, not afraid at all. You can open all the drawers if you want, I don\u2019t care. Almost everything here is new, I ordered from the net. Can you believe I forgot to buy glasses and cups? We\u2019ll have to drink directly from the bottle\u00bb.</p><p>He was too busy to answer, he took you at your words because you heard him open the drawers in the washroom, this is so him. After a few minutes of complete silence, he was still not coming to join you. You decided to go and see what he was up to. You found him sitting in the big bamboo rocking chair of your bedroom, your favorite room of the apartment. \u00a0All the furniture is in bamboo and wood, dyed in a light shade of grey, almost white. The walls, the bedding and the decorations are grey/white as well, only a blanket and a few cushions are colored with your favorite color. It\u2019s a large and bright room that lets the sun in through its garden doors. It\u2019s a peaceful place to sit and enjoy the view of the mountain in the background of your private floral little backyard. Hoseok is sitting there, with big tears in his eyes, looking outside of the window. \u00a0He heard you coming in more than he saw you and started to talk right away..</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve messed up everything y/n. Everything\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cHobi, talk to me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>You came in front of him and kneeled down, taking his hand in yours but he removed them as soon as he felt your contact.</p><p>\u201cHobi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so happy to break up with Chae. So, happy that finally I could start something with you, and now everything is ruined again\u201d. He said snuffling.</p><p>\u201cYou left her to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously\u201d.</p><p>You stood up and placed your little fist on your hips, frowning your eyebrows. He finds you beautiful like that and it made him even more sad, thinking everything was lost for good.</p><p>\u201cJung Hoseok, don\u2019t talk to me like that, obviously obviously\u201d you repeated after him, \u201cas you can see, nothing is that obvious between us\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry y/n, you will never forgive me this\u201d. He cried and kept saying that he screwed everything and other things that you couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>You need to place some distance between you and him, he doesn\u2019t want to take your hand anyway. You took a few steps back and when you felt your bed behind your calf you sat down, always looking at Hobi\u2019s eyes and face. He\u2019s in pain, you can tell. Seeing him like that hurts you more than you could have imagine. At this very moment, you would be able to negotiate your whole entire life for him to smile just 5 minutes again.</p><p>\u201cHoseok, please tell me everything. Please, you&rsquo;re driving me crazy\u201d.</p><p>He finally needed to touch you, to take your hands in his. In his head, it\u2019s the last time you will accept to touch him. \u00a0He came and sit beside you on the bed, took your hand in his, wrist resting on his thigh. You hate to see him like that, about to burst. You placed your free arm around him and laid your head on his shoulder and started to caress his back softly. You don\u2019t know what he has to say but you need to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cY/n\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to start, this is so big\u201d.</p><p>\u00abYou killed somebody? Worse, you killed a cat? You will go to jail soon?\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abWHAAAAAT? No! Girl, of course not. Who do you think I am?\u00bb</p><p>You know Hobi, he would have never done something like that of course. </p><p>\u00abWell then, start to talk, my imagination is playing with my head right now. Start with the beginning ok? One step at the time and we\u2019ll get there. Let\u2019s start with the night we talked together, you were not sure at all who you would pick if Chae was crying like I was\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOk, let\u2019s start there. You\u2019re right love, but not totally.\u00bb</p><p>Love. He called you love. Hearing that word in his mouth made you so soft inside, you were melting like ice cream under the summer sun.</p><p>\u201cI never said I would choose her over you. I was just too much in pain to think straight, to see things correctly. I said I needed to take a step back. I knew you were in love with me and I didn\u2019t want to play with your feelings. But you are not wrong either, my new feelings for her were messing up with my head. I had to get over you at some point and start something with her, but then I learned you loved me back, you see, the big mess there?\u201d</p><p>You see it, indeed. You not only see it but \u00abfeel\u00bb direct in your heart.</p><p>\u201cWell, ok, i guess\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I woke up the morning after, you were already gone for your hospital appointments. I was so glad you were there when I came back that night, although I couldn\u2019t tell you anything. I wanted to break up with Chae first.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath in. You decided that he was calm enough so you stopped to stroke his back but didn\u2019t change position.</p><p>\u201cFor me, it was clear, you were the one, YOU and nobody else. But, I wanted to break up with her first so we can start together perfectly. \u00a0I was screaming inside for you to wait for me. Thinking that we would be reunited soon made me happy but as soon as I realized the sadness in your eyes, I went down myself. That\u2019s when I kissed your cheek and went in my room\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYou could have give me a sign you know, so I could stop crying\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNo, because I wanted us to start on a pure way, perfectly free from everything. I didn\u2019t want you to be the third girl and also have to tell our kids later that I was a cheater\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOur kids? Ok well, that\u2019s a good point I guess. But we did kiss while you were with her\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWe did, I know. I never said I was perfect\u201d.</p><p>You completely understand. You will never regret that kiss though, just thinking about the taste of his tongue is enough to make you want another one right now. </p><p>\u201cThen, you chose to spend the few next days with Taemin, which I completely understand. To be honest, if you had stayed, I would have betrayed myself and declared my love\u201d.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s bringing us to that night, when you broke up with her\u2026. right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d</p><p>He started to cry again, tears coming from his eyes. </p><p>\u201cOmg, I can\u2019t believe I thought it was a good idea to tell you this. You will be so sad and disappointed. I hope you will forgive me\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHobi, spit it, please I am dying to know.\u201d \u00a0You can\u2019t wait any longer. He took a deep breath in and started to tell you.</p><p>\u201cWhen I arrived at her dorms, we went in her room and started to talk, she was peculiarly happy that night. I stopped her and told her I had something important to say. I told her I was not in love with her, that I never was. Actually, I never told her I loved her but anyway\u2026 \u00a0I add that the real love of my life was somebody else and that I wanted to start something with her. \u00a0When she tried to negotiate, asking for another chance, I told her I was sorry but it was a final decision. I told her, it was a long time love story and that she can\u2019t compete with the real love of my life\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOh! My! God! Hobi, this is so beautiful. I am the one, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at your comment.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re the one but I\u2019m not done love\u2026 I\u2019m not done. That\u2019s when she served me a bomb on a silver platter\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOh! No! I see where you are going with this\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me she was pregnant from my child\u201d.</p><p>You cannot believe it. Several thoughts are messing up with your brain right now. Mostly, you don\u2019t want him to ever have sex with her, even though you cannot be mad because, she was his girlfriend. Nevertheless, thinking about them kissing is enough to feel your head spin fast, you don\u2019t want to imagine anything else. Plus, is it possible? Can he have a baby with her?</p><p>He was crying, big tears flooding his cheeks, sobbing. He was desperately grabbing your shirt with his free hand like a little child would do, not knowing what else to do.</p><p>\u201cWait Hoseok, let\u2019s think about it. Let\u2019s analyse ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have analysed it all the way possible, me, the managers, the lawyer of Big Hits. We used a condom for god\u2019s sake. But there was a tiny, mini, little fraction of a percentage that it could have been true\u00bb.</p><p>Because you were analyzing this fast in your head, you didn\u2019t realised he was speaking with the past, conditional tense. In your mind, there\u2019s no possibility it can be true. It was not so long ago since their first date. Not even a month. Not even the time to realise your periods were late, well in your case. And if you realised you are late, it probably means you were not in the good period to procreate. Unless she has irregular periods. You will have to calculate this with a calendar but like that, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. Plus, they used a condom&hellip;</p><p>He became calm again and add:</p><p>\u00abI see you are calculating jelly bean, wait for the rest of the story. \u00a0But no, she is not pregnant. Let me finish&hellip;\u00bb \u00a0</p><p>\u00abWait Hobi, how many times did you slept with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce only, 4 days after our first date. We never had the occasion to be alone after that, our schedules being what they are\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHoseok, it was almost impossible that you were the father then if she was pregnant. If you want my opinion, she tried to hooked you the only way she could. How could she have known she was pregnant in such a short time? She told you this not even 3 weeks after you had sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had not thought so coldly on the spot, probably shocked because of the pregnancy test I saw, it was positive. Anyway, as soon as I told the staff the morning after, they consulted the lawyers of the company that consulted a gynecologist and there was an infime percentage it could have been true. Still, I was panicking. I felt like I was in a nightmare. I didn\u2019t want to have a child with a woman I don\u2019t love.\u00bb</p><p>\u201cI am not saying she was not pregnant. I am saying she may have been before you slept with her, if she was\u2026 Also, technically, if you used a condom, chances were almost nonexistent\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI know, I don\u2019t want to give you too much information that could hurt you but you know, after we removed the condom, if we touch the girl \u00abthere\u00bb with semen on our fingers, some spermatozoids can swim their way up\u00bb</p><p>\u00abOh! I figured Hoseok, I figured\u2026 but what can I say, i didn\u2019t believe it for a second. Tell me what you told her about the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you told her about that baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say congratulations if it\u2019s what you mean. I told her that if the child is mine, I would take responsibility. That\u2019s the only thing I said before I left\u00bb.</p><p>You were so proud of the answer he gave that a big smile appeared on your face. He told her he would take his responsibility but he didn\u2019t flinch at her manipulation attempt. He stared at you, surprised by your reaction. He thought you would be destroyed by the news.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong with my face?\u201d You asked him when you realised he was fixing you.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing wrong with your face. Nothing at all\u201d he said, serious.</p><p>\u201cOk, continue your story please\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about it. Big Hits lawyers called her lawyer, they asked for a blood test. That\u2019s when she said she have lost the baby. That is the freshest news I had and it was this morning\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abShe was never pregnant Hoseok. Never\u00bb.</p><p>He was so calm all of sudden. Serious, scared and concentrated on your face.</p><p>\u00aby/n, you are so calm\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abTo be honest Hobi, I\u2019m still waiting for a good reason for us to be over? Why do you keep saying that you ruined everything between us\u201d?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ruined?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would it be? Because you had the bad idea to put your penis inside her vagina?\u201d</p><p>His face took the exact expression you thought he would take. Shocked, mouth in a \u201co\u2019 shape, tilting his head to the side.</p><p>\u201cUh! \u00a0But, I almost got her pregnant\u00bb.</p><p>\u201cHobi, you had the right to have sex with your girlfriend. \u00a0You had a safe and reasonable sexual behavior, why should I be mad at you? \u00a0What hurts me is the love you had for her while I was so in love with you, the admiration in your eyes. That killed me, it still does. Of course, I wish you would have keep it in your pants love, but at the same time you were in a relationship with her. But man, 72 hours later, really?\u201d.</p><p>\u00abHey, she thought I was old-fashioned, not wanting to have sex on the first date, that I should live my life taking more risks\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abHoseok, nobody should ever disrespect a decision like that. I think it was a good decision because it was how you felt. Plus, you are nothing like dull or boring\u00bb. </p><p>Big tears came in the corner of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry I hurt you. So sorry\u201d.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok Hoseokie, it\u2019s behind us now\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s behind us? You are still up to have a relationship with me\u201d.</p><p>You tilt your head on the side and took your chin between your v-shaped fingers, mimicking his \u201cthinking\u201d expression.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Jung Hoseok, you will have to verify if I want to be your girlfriend soon. If you are capable to convince me that you love me and only me, I might be into it. \u00a0Maybe tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. \u00a0We don\u2019t want all this drama to be the set up for our new \u201cpossible\u201d life together, right?</p><p>\u201cAre you saying\u2026\u201d</p><p>You placed a finger in his beautiful lips and add:</p><p>\u00abWhy did you keep saying you ruined everything? Because for me, the only thing I see is a man being trapped by a manipulative woman the day he split with her. You told her you would take your responsibility as a father if it was true. If you would have told her to get an abortion or denied your responsibilities, you would have disappointed me big time. What could you do more? Hobi, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, you used a condom. Of course the lawyers of Big Hits have told you there was a tiny percentage of possibility, they have no choice. They have to tell you this because something like that may have happened in the medical literature. But it\u2019s not common You must have been crazy thinking she was pregnant\u2026 \u00bb.</p><p>\u00abYou are not disappointed at me?\u00bb</p><p>\u00abI won\u2019t lie. I wish you haven\u2019t slept with her at all. But, as I said, you were in a relationship. I am disappointed because we haven\u2019t talk to each other before. I am sad I saw admiration in your eyes when you were talking about her. But I was in a relationship too, not so long ago remember?\u00bb</p><p>\u00abI know, I still hate that man you introduced to us last year.\u00bb </p><p>\u00abI also believed it was impossible with you and tried with somebody else\u2026 I have no right to be mad at you for this when I did the exact same\u00bb.</p><p>When you realised that your hand was still in his, you took it back and smiled. </p><p>\u00abY/n, you are saying that, it\u2019s still possible between us. That I haven\u2019t ruined it all?\u00bb</p><p>\u00abHoseok, I will repeat what I just said. You will have to prove me that I am the only one you want. That I am the only one that you love. If I am convinced, it may be possible\u00bb you smiled at him.</p><p>You don\u2019t want to seems too rude or too demanding. You just don\u2019t want your relation to start \u00abofficially\u00bb the day he told you all this. \u00a0Just like him, you want the day that will be marked by a big X on the calendar will only remind you good memories. But you really don\u2019t want him to doubt for real so you told him:</p><p>\u00abHobi, the chances are really on your side you know because I, Jeon y/n, am so much in love with you that it hurts \u00bb</p><p>You were very happy when you heard the voice of Taemin and Jimin calling your name from the front door. Happy because you don\u2019t trust the fact that you or Hobi would have been able to wait for the next day to push things further.</p><p>\u00abY/n? Ladybug? Where are you?\u00bb</p><p>You heard Jimin making some noises with ustencils in the kitchen before he said.</p><p>\u00abHey, you ordered Tha\u00ef food?\u00bb</p><p>You kissed Hoseok\u2019s temple softly and whispered in his ears:</p><p>\u00abI don\u2019t know if I am happy or annoyed by them right now\u00bb.</p><p>Of course Taemin chose that exact moment to appear in the doorframe, when your lips are still on his temple. He went crazy.</p><p>\u00abJimin, Jiminie! Baby, we\u2019ll be godfathers soon, they were about to makeout\u00bb</p><p>\u00abOh! My! God!\u00bb Hoseok said.</p><p>Jimin came in the room and said, trying to keep his cool beside an overexcited Taemin.</p><p>\u00abI love your place, it\u2019s wonderful. We\u2019ll have a lot of couple diner here, right? Just the 4 of us?\u00bb</p><p>You see something changing in Taemin\u2019s eyes, for a nanosecond he was mad. You and Hobi stood up and when you went close to the boys, Taemin told Hobi, with a big smile, trying to act cute but still having a message to deliver:</p><p>\u00abYou break her heart again Jung Hoseok and I swear to god you\u2019ll be hang by the penis and peeled alive. You\u2019ve been noticed, thank you\u00bb.</p><p>You see Hoseok swallowing his saliva nervously before he answered:</p><p>\u00abIt\u2019s not my intention Taemin sunbaenim, believe me, I know she suffered enough lately. From now on, I hope it will be happiness only in her heart\u00bb</p><p>You and Hobi didn\u2019t take the time to explain the boys you were not \u00abofficially\u00bb a couple yet. They wouldn&rsquo;t have believed you anyway because the two of you couldn\u2019t stop holding hands, hug and smiled at each other like the young lovers do. In both your hearts, you knew it was just a matter of time anyway before you will be officially a couple. The sooner the better.</p><h2>2 days later, the night before the boys will quit for a 5 days trip</h2><p>3 gentle knock on your door, so gentle you were unsure you heard correctly. The security guard didn\u2019t call you via intercom after all, you must haven\u2019t heard correctly. The visitor repeat his gesture, there is no more doubt now. When you opened the door and saw Hoseok, you were overwhelmed by a lot of mixed feelings. Mostly relieved, after 2 days, you were starting to ask yourself what was taking him so long. Hoseok is not so patient, normally.</p><p>\u00abIt\u2019s been 43 hours since last time I saw you. You needed all that time to make sure I was the one\u00bb you said with a teasing voice as soon as you opened up the door.</p><p>\u00abWho said you are the one\u00bb? He answered, lifting only one eyebrow, obviously acting.</p><p>\u00abWell I hope I am, Jung Hoseok, I certainly hope I am\u00bb.</p><p>He came in your apartment and closed the door behind him, leaning his back against the door frame with his hands behind his back, looking at you in the eyes.</p><p>\u00abYou are so beautiful Hoseok. You are so, so perfectly beautiful\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abHey, I am the one suppose to convince the other, remember?\u00bb.</p><p>You came closer and encircled your arms around his waist, all your weight against him, gluing every little part of your body that could be. As soon as your bodies met, your nose took place in the crook of his neck and his cheek found his way against your temple. It was a soft but very demanding embrace, filled with love and desire. Still, he kept his hands crossed on his back.</p><p>\u00abHey, you missed me that much, huh?\u00bb He teased.</p><p>\u00abHobi, shut up please and kiss me\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abWhat?\u00bb He asked, really uncertain he heard.</p><p>\u00abLet me make myself clear, if you really want to use those beautiful lips and that equally beautiful tongue, I haven\u2019t checked though, make good use of them and kiss me\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abI thought I had to convince you that I love you, that you were the only one\u00bb</p><p>\u00abAm I your first choice baby\u00bb?</p><p>\u00abYou are my only choice y/n\u00bb</p><p>\u00abGood\u00bb</p><p>You didn\u2019t wait for him to kiss you, you kissed him. When you felt one of his hand on your side and the other one on your neck, you knew you were up to a passionate night with the man that you love and that loves you just as much.</p><p>\u00abYou know what my love?\u00bb he asked once you were lying on the bed, half of your clothes on the floor, hands all over each other, eager to finally make love. </p><p>\u00abTell me\u00bb You kissed his neck, your arms keeping him close above you.</p><p>\u00abI ain\u2019t really into sex the first night\u00bb he was teasing you, you could tell, barely able to contain his laughter. You started to laughed.</p><p>\u00abThat\u2019s a shame, I might forget all the little things I wanted to do to you next time\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abWell then, we may proceed\u00bb He licked your lower lip and bite it, not so gently.</p><p>\u00abThat\u2019s what I thought\u00bb.</p><p>If you ever have questioned your love for him, which never happened, at that very moment all your doubt died, like that. This is exactly the relation you\u2019ve been dreaming of, filled with laughter, complicity, passion, trust and love. There is no doubt in your mind he loves you, love is strong, love has won.</p>",

You didn\u2019t talk about it with him, Hobi probably did.</p>[[MORE]]<p>This afternoon at 16h00, you haven\u2019t told anybody about it but, you had a meeting with the rector of the Seoul university. He offered you a one year contract, starting right now if you want because you can work from home. Your task would be to assist the teachers of the modern dance department by being the second evaluator of the students examinations. Basically, you wouldn\u2019t be in direct contact with students for now, just watching videos of their choreography and attribute them a score that will count for 50% of their marks on each evaluations, basically a good responsibility. You haven\u2019t decided yet, you don\u2019t know what you will do to be honest. It\u2019s a good job with good conditions and it keeps your passion for dance alive. You are just scared that you\u2019ll find it boring, the fact that you are not directly in the dance studio, where the action is. You will need to analyse it with Taemin, his opinion matters to you.</p><p>When you arrived home, you took a long shower, washed your hair, put on some loose pants and a t-shirt of your brother, placed your hair on the top of your head with in a messy bun and stayed bareface. Hoseok had texted you, wondering if you had eaten, offering to bring something on his way to your place. You agreed, sometimes it\u2019s easier to talk with a table between you.</p><p>You were so nervous to meet him, nervous about the things he had to say. According to him, there are things he needs to tell you that will hurt you. A lot of things have hurt you recently. As they say, you had to hit rock bottom. The only way you can go now, is up. </p><p>Waiting for Hoseok, you sat down to meditate for a few minutes but you have probably fell asleep because suddenly, the buzz of the intercom woke you up. </p><p>\u201cMiss Jeon, there is a man named Jung Hoseok here, may I let him in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you may ajussi. Thank you\u201d.</p><p>You have almost 2 minutes before Hoseok will reach your apartment. You take that time to nervously brush your teeth, use a washcloth of cold water on your face and apply some mascara. You have no more time to redo your hair, you can hear 3 light knock on the door. </p><p>\u201cGood evening y/n\u201d, he says with a sad smile.</p><p>\u201cHi Hobi\u201d.</p><p>As you can see his sadness and his tiredness, you take a step back to look at him from head to toes. You want to analyse every single detail, to make sure he\u2019s not sick or something. He has a big houseplant in one hand, a gift bag in another one and a take-out food. </p><p>\u201cMay I come in?\u201d He asked, smiling shyly. Hoseok being shy, you see him more and more like that recently but you can\u2019t get use to it. He\u2019s so beautiful with that timid smile that your heart beat faster.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, I have no manners, of course you can come in\u201d. You moved to the side to let him enter. He looked everywhere and smiled brightly.</p><p>\u201cThis place looks peaceful, I love it. May I have a visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, have a view while I take care of the take out. It smells Tha\u00ef food, Mmmmm. Come in the kitchen just over there when you are done\u201d, you said, pointing in the good direction.</p><p>He placed the gifs on the little table by the door and started to visit right away. He talked to you on his way to the living room.</p><p>\u00abYou are not afraid I will discover some of your secrets? Or that I will steal something?\u00bb</p><p>\u00abNo, not afraid at all. You can open all the drawers if you want, I don\u2019t care. Almost everything here is new, I ordered from the net. Can you believe I forgot to buy glasses and cups? We\u2019ll have to drink directly from the bottle\u00bb.</p><p>He was too busy to answer, he took you at your words because you heard him open the drawers in the washroom, this is so him. After a few minutes of complete silence, he was still not coming to join you. You decided to go and see what he was up to. You found him sitting in the big bamboo rocking chair of your bedroom, your favorite room of the apartment. \u00a0All the furniture is in bamboo and wood, dyed in a light shade of grey, almost white. The walls, the bedding and the decorations are grey/white as well, only a blanket and a few cushions are colored with your favorite color. It\u2019s a large and bright room that lets the sun in through its garden doors. It\u2019s a peaceful place to sit and enjoy the view of the mountain in the background of your private floral little backyard. Hoseok is sitting there, with big tears in his eyes, looking outside of the window. \u00a0He heard you coming in more than he saw you and started to talk right away..</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve messed up everything y/n. Everything\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cHobi, talk to me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>You came in front of him and kneeled down, taking his hand in yours but he removed them as soon as he felt your contact.</p><p>\u201cHobi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so happy to break up with Chae. So, happy that finally I could start something with you, and now everything is ruined again\u201d. He said snuffling.</p><p>\u201cYou left her to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously\u201d.</p><p>You stood up and placed your little fist on your hips, frowning your eyebrows. He finds you beautiful like that and it made him even more sad, thinking everything was lost for good.</p><p>\u201cJung Hoseok, don\u2019t talk to me like that, obviously obviously\u201d you repeated after him, \u201cas you can see, nothing is that obvious between us\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry y/n, you will never forgive me this\u201d. He cried and kept saying that he screwed everything and other things that you couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>You need to place some distance between you and him, he doesn\u2019t want to take your hand anyway. You took a few steps back and when you felt your bed behind your calf you sat down, always looking at Hobi\u2019s eyes and face. He\u2019s in pain, you can tell. Seeing him like that hurts you more than you could have imagine. At this very moment, you would be able to negotiate your whole entire life for him to smile just 5 minutes again.</p><p>\u201cHoseok, please tell me everything. Please, you\u2019re driving me crazy\u201d.</p><p>He finally needed to touch you, to take your hands in his. In his head, it\u2019s the last time you will accept to touch him. \u00a0He came and sit beside you on the bed, took your hand in his, wrist resting on his thigh. You hate to see him like that, about to burst. You placed your free arm around him and laid your head on his shoulder and started to caress his back softly. You don\u2019t know what he has to say but you need to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cY/n\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to start, this is so big\u201d.</p><p>\u00abYou killed somebody? Worse, you killed a cat? You will go to jail soon?\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abWHAAAAAT? No! Girl, of course not. Who do you think I am?\u00bb</p><p>You know Hobi, he would have never done something like that of course. </p><p>\u00abWell then, start to talk, my imagination is playing with my head right now. Start with the beginning ok? One step at the time and we\u2019ll get there. Let\u2019s start with the night we talked together, you were not sure at all who you would pick if Chae was crying like I was\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOk, let\u2019s start there. You\u2019re right love, but not totally.\u00bb</p><p>Love. He called you love. Hearing that word in his mouth made you so soft inside, you were melting like ice cream under the summer sun.</p><p>\u201cI never said I would choose her over you. I was just too much in pain to think straight, to see things correctly. I said I needed to take a step back. I knew you were in love with me and I didn\u2019t want to play with your feelings. But you are not wrong either, my new feelings for her were messing up with my head. I had to get over you at some point and start something with her, but then I learned you loved me back, you see, the big mess there?\u201d</p><p>You see it, indeed. You not only see it but \u00abfeel\u00bb direct in your heart.</p><p>\u201cWell, ok, i guess\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I woke up the morning after, you were already gone for your hospital appointments. I was so glad you were there when I came back that night, although I couldn\u2019t tell you anything. I wanted to break up with Chae first.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath in. You decided that he was calm enough so you stopped to stroke his back but didn\u2019t change position.</p><p>\u201cFor me, it was clear, you were the one, YOU and nobody else. But, I wanted to break up with her first so we can start together perfectly. \u00a0I was screaming inside for you to wait for me. Thinking that we would be reunited soon made me happy but as soon as I realized the sadness in your eyes, I went down myself. That\u2019s when I kissed your cheek and went in my room\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYou could have give me a sign you know, so I could stop crying\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNo, because I wanted us to start on a pure way, perfectly free from everything. I didn\u2019t want you to be the third girl and also have to tell our kids later that I was a cheater\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOur kids? Ok well, that\u2019s a good point I guess. But we did kiss while you were with her\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWe did, I know. I never said I was perfect\u201d.</p><p>You completely understand. You will never regret that kiss though, just thinking about the taste of his tongue is enough to make you want another one right now. </p><p>\u201cThen, you chose to spend the few next days with Taemin, which I completely understand. To be honest, if you had stayed, I would have betrayed myself and declared my love\u201d.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s bringing us to that night, when you broke up with her\u2026. right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d</p><p>He started to cry again, tears coming from his eyes. </p><p>\u201cOmg, I can\u2019t believe I thought it was a good idea to tell you this. You will be so sad and disappointed. I hope you will forgive me\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHobi, spit it, please I am dying to know.\u201d \u00a0You can\u2019t wait any longer. He took a deep breath in and started to tell you.</p><p>\u201cWhen I arrived at her dorms, we went in her room and started to talk, she was peculiarly happy that night. I stopped her and told her I had something important to say. I told her I was not in love with her, that I never was. Actually, I never told her I loved her but anyway\u2026 \u00a0I add that the real love of my life was somebody else and that I wanted to start something with her. \u00a0When she tried to negotiate, asking for another chance, I told her I was sorry but it was a final decision. I told her, it was a long time love story and that she can\u2019t compete with the real love of my life\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOh! My! God! Hobi, this is so beautiful. I am the one, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at your comment.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re the one but I\u2019m not done love\u2026 I\u2019m not done. That\u2019s when she served me a bomb on a silver platter\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOh! No! I see where you are going with this\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me she was pregnant from my child\u201d.</p><p>You cannot believe it. Several thoughts are messing up with your brain right now. Mostly, you don\u2019t want him to ever have sex with her, even though you cannot be mad because, she was his girlfriend. Nevertheless, thinking about them kissing is enough to feel your head spin fast, you don\u2019t want to imagine anything else. Plus, is it possible? Can he have a baby with her?</p><p>He was crying, big tears flooding his cheeks, sobbing. He was desperately grabbing your shirt with his free hand like a little child would do, not knowing what else to do.</p><p>\u201cWait Hoseok, let\u2019s think about it. Let\u2019s analyse ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have analysed it all the way possible, me, the managers, the lawyer of Big Hits. We used a condom for god\u2019s sake. But there was a tiny, mini, little fraction of a percentage that it could have been true\u00bb.</p><p>Because you were analyzing this fast in your head, you didn\u2019t realised he was speaking with the past, conditional tense. In your mind, there\u2019s no possibility it can be true. It was not so long ago since their first date. Not even a month. Not even the time to realise your periods were late, well in your case. And if you realised you are late, it probably means you were not in the good period to procreate. Unless she has irregular periods. You will have to calculate this with a calendar but like that, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. Plus, they used a condom\u2026</p><p>He became calm again and add:</p><p>\u00abI see you are calculating jelly bean, wait for the rest of the story. \u00a0But no, she is not pregnant. Let me finish\u2026\u00bb \u00a0</p><p>\u00abWait Hobi, how many times did you slept with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce only, 4 days after our first date. We never had the occasion to be alone after that, our schedules being what they are\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHoseok, it was almost impossible that you were the father then if she was pregnant. If you want my opinion, she tried to hooked you the only way she could. How could she have known she was pregnant in such a short time? She told you this not even 3 weeks after you had sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had not thought so coldly on the spot, probably shocked because of the pregnancy test I saw, it was positive. Anyway, as soon as I told the staff the morning after, they consulted the lawyers of the company that consulted a gynecologist and there was an infime percentage it could have been true. Still, I was panicking. I felt like I was in a nightmare. I didn\u2019t want to have a child with a woman I don\u2019t love.\u00bb</p><p>\u201cI am not saying she was not pregnant. I am saying she may have been before you slept with her, if she was\u2026 Also, technically, if you used a condom, chances were almost nonexistent\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI know, I don\u2019t want to give you too much information that could hurt you but you know, after we removed the condom, if we touch the girl \u00abthere\u00bb with semen on our fingers, some spermatozoids can swim their way up\u00bb</p><p>\u00abOh! I figured Hoseok, I figured\u2026 but what can I say, i didn\u2019t believe it for a second. Tell me what you told her about the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you told her about that baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say congratulations if it\u2019s what you mean. I told her that if the child is mine, I would take responsibility. That\u2019s the only thing I said before I left\u00bb.</p><p>You were so proud of the answer he gave that a big smile appeared on your face. He told her he would take his responsibility but he didn\u2019t flinch at her manipulation attempt. He stared at you, surprised by your reaction. He thought you would be destroyed by the news.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong with my face?\u201d You asked him when you realised he was fixing you.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing wrong with your face. Nothing at all\u201d he said, serious.</p><p>\u201cOk, continue your story please\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about it. Big Hits lawyers called her lawyer, they asked for a blood test. That\u2019s when she said she have lost the baby. That is the freshest news I had and it was this morning\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abShe was never pregnant Hoseok. Never\u00bb.</p><p>He was so calm all of sudden. Serious, scared and concentrated on your face.</p><p>\u00aby/n, you are so calm\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abTo be honest Hobi, I\u2019m still waiting for a good reason for us to be over? Why do you keep saying that you ruined everything between us\u201d?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ruined?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would it be? Because you had the bad idea to put your penis inside her vagina?\u201d</p><p>His face took the exact expression you thought he would take. Shocked, mouth in a \u201co\u2019 shape, tilting his head to the side.</p><p>\u201cUh! \u00a0But, I almost got her pregnant\u00bb.</p><p>\u201cHobi, you had the right to have sex with your girlfriend. \u00a0You had a safe and reasonable sexual behavior, why should I be mad at you? \u00a0What hurts me is the love you had for her while I was so in love with you, the admiration in your eyes. That killed me, it still does. Of course, I wish you would have keep it in your pants love, but at the same time you were in a relationship with her. But man, 72 hours later, really?\u201d.</p><p>\u00abHey, she thought I was old-fashioned, not wanting to have sex on the first date, that I should live my life taking more risks\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abHoseok, nobody should ever disrespect a decision like that. I think it was a good decision because it was how you felt. Plus, you are nothing like dull or boring\u00bb. </p><p>Big tears came in the corner of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry I hurt you. So sorry\u201d.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok Hoseokie, it\u2019s behind us now\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s behind us? You are still up to have a relationship with me\u201d.</p><p>You tilt your head on the side and took your chin between your v-shaped fingers, mimicking his \u201cthinking\u201d expression.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Jung Hoseok, you will have to verify if I want to be your girlfriend soon. If you are capable to convince me that you love me and only me, I might be into it. \u00a0Maybe tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. \u00a0We don\u2019t want all this drama to be the set up for our new \u201cpossible\u201d life together, right?</p><p>\u201cAre you saying\u2026\u201d</p><p>You placed a finger in his beautiful lips and add:</p><p>\u00abWhy did you keep saying you ruined everything? Because for me, the only thing I see is a man being trapped by a manipulative woman the day he split with her. You told her you would take your responsibility as a father if it was true. If you would have told her to get an abortion or denied your responsibilities, you would have disappointed me big time. What could you do more? Hobi, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, you used a condom. Of course the lawyers of Big Hits have told you there was a tiny percentage of possibility, they have no choice. They have to tell you this because something like that may have happened in the medical literature. But it\u2019s not common You must have been crazy thinking she was pregnant\u2026 \u00bb.</p><p>\u00abYou are not disappointed at me?\u00bb</p><p>\u00abI won\u2019t lie. I wish you haven\u2019t slept with her at all. But, as I said, you were in a relationship. I am disappointed because we haven\u2019t talk to each other before. I am sad I saw admiration in your eyes when you were talking about her. But I was in a relationship too, not so long ago remember?\u00bb</p><p>\u00abI know, I still hate that man you introduced to us last year.\u00bb </p><p>\u00abI also believed it was impossible with you and tried with somebody else\u2026 I have no right to be mad at you for this when I did the exact same\u00bb.</p><p>When you realised that your hand was still in his, you took it back and smiled. </p><p>\u00abY/n, you are saying that, it\u2019s still possible between us. That I haven\u2019t ruined it all?\u00bb</p><p>\u00abHoseok, I will repeat what I just said. You will have to prove me that I am the only one you want. That I am the only one that you love. If I am convinced, it may be possible\u00bb you smiled at him.</p><p>You don\u2019t want to seems too rude or too demanding. You just don\u2019t want your relation to start \u00abofficially\u00bb the day he told you all this. \u00a0Just like him, you want the day that will be marked by a big X on the calendar will only remind you good memories. But you really don\u2019t want him to doubt for real so you told him:</p><p>\u00abHobi, the chances are really on your side you know because I, Jeon y/n, am so much in love with you that it hurts \u00bb</p><p>You were very happy when you heard the voice of Taemin and Jimin calling your name from the front door. Happy because you don\u2019t trust the fact that you or Hobi would have been able to wait for the next day to push things further.</p><p>\u00abY/n? Ladybug? Where are you?\u00bb</p><p>You heard Jimin making some noises with ustencils in the kitchen before he said.</p><p>\u00abHey, you ordered Tha\u00ef food?\u00bb</p><p>You kissed Hoseok\u2019s temple softly and whispered in his ears:</p><p>\u00abI don\u2019t know if I am happy or annoyed by them right now\u00bb.</p><p>Of course Taemin chose that exact moment to appear in the doorframe, when your lips are still on his temple. He went crazy.</p><p>\u00abJimin, Jiminie! Baby, we\u2019ll be godfathers soon, they were about to makeout\u00bb</p><p>\u00abOh! My! God!\u00bb Hoseok said.</p><p>Jimin came in the room and said, trying to keep his cool beside an overexcited Taemin.</p><p>\u00abI love your place, it\u2019s wonderful. We\u2019ll have a lot of couple diner here, right? Just the 4 of us?\u00bb</p><p>You see something changing in Taemin\u2019s eyes, for a nanosecond he was mad. You and Hobi stood up and when you went close to the boys, Taemin told Hobi, with a big smile, trying to act cute but still having a message to deliver:</p><p>\u00abYou break her heart again Jung Hoseok and I swear to god you\u2019ll be hang by the penis and peeled alive. You\u2019ve been noticed, thank you\u00bb.</p><p>You see Hoseok swallowing his saliva nervously before he answered:</p><p>\u00abIt\u2019s not my intention Taemin sunbaenim, believe me, I know she suffered enough lately. From now on, I hope it will be happiness only in her heart\u00bb</p><p>You and Hobi didn\u2019t take the time to explain the boys you were not \u00abofficially\u00bb a couple yet. They wouldn\u2019t have believed you anyway because the two of you couldn\u2019t stop holding hands, hug and smiled at each other like the young lovers do. In both your hearts, you knew it was just a matter of time anyway before you will be officially a couple. The sooner the better.</p><h2>2 days later, the night before the boys will quit for a 5 days trip</h2><p>3 gentle knock on your door, so gentle you were unsure you heard correctly. The security guard didn\u2019t call you via intercom after all, you must haven\u2019t heard correctly. The visitor repeat his gesture, there is no more doubt now. When you opened the door and saw Hoseok, you were overwhelmed by a lot of mixed feelings. Mostly relieved, after 2 days, you were starting to ask yourself what was taking him so long. Hoseok is not so patient, normally.</p><p>\u00abIt\u2019s been 43 hours since last time I saw you. You needed all that time to make sure I was the one\u00bb you said with a teasing voice as soon as you opened up the door.</p><p>\u00abWho said you are the one\u00bb? He answered, lifting only one eyebrow, obviously acting.</p><p>\u00abWell I hope I am, Jung Hoseok, I certainly hope I am\u00bb.</p><p>He came in your apartment and closed the door behind him, leaning his back against the door frame with his hands behind his back, looking at you in the eyes.</p><p>\u00abYou are so beautiful Hoseok. You are so, so perfectly beautiful\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abHey, I am the one suppose to convince the other, remember?\u00bb.</p><p>You came closer and encircled your arms around his waist, all your weight against him, gluing every little part of your body that could be. As soon as your bodies met, your nose took place in the crook of his neck and his cheek found his way against your temple. It was a soft but very demanding embrace, filled with love and desire. Still, he kept his hands crossed on his back.</p><p>\u00abHey, you missed me that much, huh?\u00bb He teased.</p><p>\u00abHobi, shut up please and kiss me\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abWhat?\u00bb He asked, really uncertain he heard.</p><p>\u00abLet me make myself clear, if you really want to use those beautiful lips and that equally beautiful tongue, I haven\u2019t checked though, make good use of them and kiss me\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abI thought I had to convince you that I love you, that you were the only one\u00bb</p><p>\u00abAm I your first choice baby\u00bb?</p><p>\u00abYou are my only choice y/n\u00bb</p><p>\u00abGood\u00bb</p><p>You didn\u2019t wait for him to kiss you, you kissed him. When you felt one of his hand on your side and the other one on your neck, you knew you were up to a passionate night with the man that you love and that loves you just as much.</p><p>\u00abYou know what my love?\u00bb he asked once you were lying on the bed, half of your clothes on the floor, hands all over each other, eager to finally make love. </p><p>\u00abTell me\u00bb You kissed his neck, your arms keeping him close above you.</p><p>\u00abI ain\u2019t really into sex the first night\u00bb he was teasing you, you could tell, barely able to contain his laughter. You started to laughed.</p><p>\u00abThat\u2019s a shame, I might forget all the little things I wanted to do to you next time\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abWell then, we may proceed\u00bb He licked your lower lip and bite it, not so gently.</p><p>\u00abThat\u2019s what I thought\u00bb.</p><p>If you ever have questioned your love for him, which never happened, at that very moment all your doubt died, like that. This is exactly the relation you\u2019ve been dreaming of, filled with laughter, complicity, passion, trust and love. There is no doubt in your mind he loves you, love is strong, love has won.</p>",

I know, some of you told me you wanted her to be with Nam but in my mind, she can only love Hobi.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t he deserve all the love in the world, our little sunshine? (Yes ok, Nam too). Anyway, have fun reading it. Tell me what you thought of this serie if you want, or not. It\u2019s up to you!

It had started with a little physiotherapy session for your leg, which hurt to be honest but it has to be done. You are happy to be able to walk for long distances now, to dance almost like before, to move normally. There will be always 2 movements that you won\u2019t be able to do with your ankle: inversion and eversion. Those movements are impossible because of the metal plates and screw that keeps your bones together. Those impossible movements are the ones that will keep you away from the stage forever. You\u2019ll have to live with it, you have no other choice. But it\u2019s ok, you will find a way, your way.</p><p>Then you had a lunch date with Nam. He brought you to a little Japanese restaurant with sliding paper doors, painted with pink flowers and japanese script. You\u2019ve drink tea and eat fancy food, talked about life just like you always do. \u00a0Having a conversation with him is always interesting. He\u2019s so brilliant and the way he sees things is often like you so, you just complete each other\u2019s opinion. It makes your conversation mutually rewarding and enriching. You talked philosophy and exchanged your thoughts on politic and on \u201cthe Seungri case\u201d. \u00a0You also laughed and behaved like children, foolishly challenging each other (the one who drinks his hot tea the quickest, the one who eats the slowest, who will be able to put the word \u00abpoop emoji\u00bb in the conversation with the waitress, etc). He walked back with you to your place after a 2 hours meal, kissed your cheeks before leaving and add \u201cgood luck for your conversation with Hobi tonight\u201d before turning around on his feets and leaved with a beautiful dimple smile. You didn\u2019t talk about it with him, Hobi probably did.</p>[[MORE]]<p>This afternoon at 16h00, you haven\u2019t told anybody about it but, you had a meeting with the rector of the Seoul university. He offered you a one year contract, starting right now if you want because you can work from home. Your task would be to assist the teachers of the modern dance department by being the second evaluator of the students examinations. Basically, you wouldn\u2019t be in direct contact with students for now, just watching videos of their choreography and attribute them a score that will count for 50% of their marks on each evaluations, basically a good responsibility. You haven\u2019t decided yet, you don\u2019t know what you will do to be honest. It\u2019s a good job with good conditions and it keeps your passion for dance alive. You are just scared that you\u2019ll find it boring, the fact that you are not directly in the dance studio, where the action is. You will need to analyse it with Taemin, his opinion matters to you.</p><p>When you arrived home, you took a long shower, washed your hair, put on some loose pants and a t-shirt of your brother, placed your hair on the top of your head with in a messy bun and stayed bareface. Hoseok had texted you, wondering if you had eaten, offering to bring something on his way to your place. You agreed, sometimes it\u2019s easier to talk with a table between you.</p><p>You were so nervous to meet him, nervous about the things he had to say. According to him, there are things he needs to tell you that will hurt you. A lot of things have hurt you recently. As they say, you had to hit rock bottom. The only way you can go now, is up. </p><p>Waiting for Hoseok, you sat down to meditate for a few minutes but you have probably fell asleep because suddenly, the buzz of the intercom woke you up. </p><p>\u201cMiss Jeon, there is a man named Jung Hoseok here, may I let him in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you may ajussi. Thank you\u201d.</p><p>You have almost 2 minutes before Hoseok will reach your apartment. You take that time to nervously brush your teeth, use a washcloth of cold water on your face and apply some mascara. You have no more time to redo your hair, you can hear 3 light knock on the door. </p><p>\u201cGood evening y/n\u201d, he says with a sad smile.</p><p>\u201cHi Hobi\u201d.</p><p>As you can see his sadness and his tiredness, you take a step back to look at him from head to toes. You want to analyse every single detail, to make sure he\u2019s not sick or something. He has a big houseplant in one hand, a gift bag in another one and a take-out food. </p><p>\u201cMay I come in?\u201d He asked, smiling shyly. Hoseok being shy, you see him more and more like that recently but you can\u2019t get use to it. He\u2019s so beautiful with that timid smile that your heart beat faster.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, I have no manners, of course you can come in\u201d. You moved to the side to let him enter. He looked everywhere and smiled brightly.</p><p>\u201cThis place looks peaceful, I love it. May I have a visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, have a view while I take care of the take out. It smells Tha\u00ef food, Mmmmm. Come in the kitchen just over there when you are done\u201d, you said, pointing in the good direction.</p><p>He placed the gifs on the little table by the door and started to visit right away. He talked to you on his way to the living room.</p><p>\u00abYou are not afraid I will discover some of your secrets? Or that I will steal something?\u00bb</p><p>\u00abNo, not afraid at all. You can open all the drawers if you want, I don\u2019t care. Almost everything here is new, I ordered from the net. Can you believe I forgot to buy glasses and cups? We\u2019ll have to drink directly from the bottle\u00bb.</p><p>He was too busy to answer, he took you at your words because you heard him open the drawers in the washroom, this is so him. After a few minutes of complete silence, he was still not coming to join you. You decided to go and see what he was up to. You found him sitting in the big bamboo rocking chair of your bedroom, your favorite room of the apartment. \u00a0All the furniture is in bamboo and wood, dyed in a light shade of grey, almost white. The walls, the bedding and the decorations are grey/white as well, only a blanket and a few cushions are colored with your favorite color. It\u2019s a large and bright room that lets the sun in through its garden doors. It\u2019s a peaceful place to sit and enjoy the view of the mountain in the background of your private floral little backyard. Hoseok is sitting there, with big tears in his eyes, looking outside of the window. \u00a0He heard you coming in more than he saw you and started to talk right away..</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve messed up everything y/n. Everything\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cHobi, talk to me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>You came in front of him and kneeled down, taking his hand in yours but he removed them as soon as he felt your contact.</p><p>\u201cHobi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so happy to break up with Chae. So, happy that finally I could start something with you, and now everything is ruined again\u201d. He said snuffling.</p><p>\u201cYou left her to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously\u201d.</p><p>You stood up and placed your little fist on your hips, frowning your eyebrows. He finds you beautiful like that and it made him even more sad, thinking everything was lost for good.</p><p>\u201cJung Hoseok, don\u2019t talk to me like that, obviously obviously\u201d you repeated after him, \u201cas you can see, nothing is that obvious between us\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry y/n, you will never forgive me this\u201d. He cried and kept saying that he screwed everything and other things that you couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>You need to place some distance between you and him, he doesn\u2019t want to take your hand anyway. You took a few steps back and when you felt your bed behind your calf you sat down, always looking at Hobi\u2019s eyes and face. He\u2019s in pain, you can tell. Seeing him like that hurts you more than you could have imagine. At this very moment, you would be able to negotiate your whole entire life for him to smile just 5 minutes again.</p><p>\u201cHoseok, please tell me everything. Please, you\u2019re driving me crazy\u201d.</p><p>He finally needed to touch you, to take your hands in his. In his head, it\u2019s the last time you will accept to touch him. \u00a0He came and sit beside you on the bed, took your hand in his, wrist resting on his thigh. You hate to see him like that, about to burst. You placed your free arm around him and laid your head on his shoulder and started to caress his back softly. You don\u2019t know what he has to say but you need to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cY/n\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to start, this is so big\u201d.</p><p>\u00abYou killed somebody? Worse, you killed a cat? You will go to jail soon?\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abWHAAAAAT? No! Girl, of course not. Who do you think I am?\u00bb</p><p>You know Hobi, he would have never done something like that of course. </p><p>\u00abWell then, start to talk, my imagination is playing with my head right now. Start with the beginning ok? One step at the time and we\u2019ll get there. Let\u2019s start with the night we talked together, you were not sure at all who you would pick if Chae was crying like I was\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOk, let\u2019s start there. You\u2019re right love, but not totally.\u00bb</p><p>Love. He called you love. Hearing that word in his mouth made you so soft inside, you were melting like ice cream under the summer sun.</p><p>\u201cI never said I would choose her over you. I was just too much in pain to think straight, to see things correctly. I said I needed to take a step back. I knew you were in love with me and I didn\u2019t want to play with your feelings. But you are not wrong either, my new feelings for her were messing up with my head. I had to get over you at some point and start something with her, but then I learned you loved me back, you see, the big mess there?\u201d</p><p>You see it, indeed. You not only see it but \u00abfeel\u00bb direct in your heart.</p><p>\u201cWell, ok, i guess\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I woke up the morning after, you were already gone for your hospital appointments. I was so glad you were there when I came back that night, although I couldn\u2019t tell you anything. I wanted to break up with Chae first.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath in. You decided that he was calm enough so you stopped to stroke his back but didn\u2019t change position.</p><p>\u201cFor me, it was clear, you were the one, YOU and nobody else. But, I wanted to break up with her first so we can start together perfectly. \u00a0I was screaming inside for you to wait for me. Thinking that we would be reunited soon made me happy but as soon as I realized the sadness in your eyes, I went down myself. That\u2019s when I kissed your cheek and went in my room\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYou could have give me a sign you know, so I could stop crying\u201d.</p><p>\u201cNo, because I wanted us to start on a pure way, perfectly free from everything. I didn\u2019t want you to be the third girl and also have to tell our kids later that I was a cheater\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOur kids? Ok well, that\u2019s a good point I guess. But we did kiss while you were with her\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWe did, I know. I never said I was perfect\u201d.</p><p>You completely understand. You will never regret that kiss though, just thinking about the taste of his tongue is enough to make you want another one right now. </p><p>\u201cThen, you chose to spend the few next days with Taemin, which I completely understand. To be honest, if you had stayed, I would have betrayed myself and declared my love\u201d.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s bringing us to that night, when you broke up with her\u2026. right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d</p><p>He started to cry again, tears coming from his eyes. </p><p>\u201cOmg, I can\u2019t believe I thought it was a good idea to tell you this. You will be so sad and disappointed. I hope you will forgive me\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHobi, spit it, please I am dying to know.\u201d \u00a0You can\u2019t wait any longer. He took a deep breath in and started to tell you.</p><p>\u201cWhen I arrived at her dorms, we went in her room and started to talk, she was peculiarly happy that night. I stopped her and told her I had something important to say. I told her I was not in love with her, that I never was. Actually, I never told her I loved her but anyway\u2026 \u00a0I add that the real love of my life was somebody else and that I wanted to start something with her. \u00a0When she tried to negotiate, asking for another chance, I told her I was sorry but it was a final decision. I told her, it was a long time love story and that she can\u2019t compete with the real love of my life\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOh! My! God! Hobi, this is so beautiful. I am the one, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at your comment.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re the one but I\u2019m not done love\u2026 I\u2019m not done. That\u2019s when she served me a bomb on a silver platter\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOh! No! I see where you are going with this\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me she was pregnant from my child\u201d.</p><p>You cannot believe it. Several thoughts are messing up with your brain right now. Mostly, you don\u2019t want him to ever have sex with her, even though you cannot be mad because, she was his girlfriend. Nevertheless, thinking about them kissing is enough to feel your head spin fast, you don\u2019t want to imagine anything else. Plus, is it possible? Can he have a baby with her?</p><p>He was crying, big tears flooding his cheeks, sobbing. He was desperately grabbing your shirt with his free hand like a little child would do, not knowing what else to do.</p><p>\u201cWait Hoseok, let\u2019s think about it. Let\u2019s analyse ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have analysed it all the way possible, me, the managers, the lawyer of Big Hits. We used a condom for god\u2019s sake. But there was a tiny, mini, little fraction of a percentage that it could have been true\u00bb.</p><p>Because you were analyzing this fast in your head, you didn\u2019t realised he was speaking with the past, conditional tense. In your mind, there\u2019s no possibility it can be true. It was not so long ago since their first date. Not even a month. Not even the time to realise your periods were late, well in your case. And if you realised you are late, it probably means you were not in the good period to procreate. Unless she has irregular periods. You will have to calculate this with a calendar but like that, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. Plus, they used a condom\u2026</p><p>He became calm again and add:</p><p>\u00abI see you are calculating jelly bean, wait for the rest of the story. \u00a0But no, she is not pregnant. Let me finish\u2026\u00bb \u00a0</p><p>\u00abWait Hobi, how many times did you slept with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce only, 4 days after our first date. We never had the occasion to be alone after that, our schedules being what they are\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHoseok, it was almost impossible that you were the father then if she was pregnant. If you want my opinion, she tried to hooked you the only way she could. How could she have known she was pregnant in such a short time? She told you this not even 3 weeks after you had sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had not thought so coldly on the spot, probably shocked because of the pregnancy test I saw, it was positive. Anyway, as soon as I told the staff the morning after, they consulted the lawyers of the company that consulted a gynecologist and there was an infime percentage it could have been true. Still, I was panicking. I felt like I was in a nightmare. I didn\u2019t want to have a child with a woman I don\u2019t love.\u00bb</p><p>\u201cI am not saying she was not pregnant. I am saying she may have been before you slept with her, if she was\u2026 Also, technically, if you used a condom, chances were almost nonexistent\u201d.</p><p>\u201cI know, I don\u2019t want to give you too much information that could hurt you but you know, after we removed the condom, if we touch the girl \u00abthere\u00bb with semen on our fingers, some spermatozoids can swim their way up\u00bb</p><p>\u00abOh! I figured Hoseok, I figured\u2026 but what can I say, i didn\u2019t believe it for a second. Tell me what you told her about the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you told her about that baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say congratulations if it\u2019s what you mean. I told her that if the child is mine, I would take responsibility. That\u2019s the only thing I said before I left\u00bb.</p><p>You were so proud of the answer he gave that a big smile appeared on your face. He told her he would take his responsibility but he didn\u2019t flinch at her manipulation attempt. He stared at you, surprised by your reaction. He thought you would be destroyed by the news.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong with my face?\u201d You asked him when you realised he was fixing you.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing wrong with your face. Nothing at all\u201d he said, serious.</p><p>\u201cOk, continue your story please\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about it. Big Hits lawyers called her lawyer, they asked for a blood test. That\u2019s when she said she have lost the baby. That is the freshest news I had and it was this morning\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abShe was never pregnant Hoseok. Never\u00bb.</p><p>He was so calm all of sudden. Serious, scared and concentrated on your face.</p><p>\u00aby/n, you are so calm\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abTo be honest Hobi, I\u2019m still waiting for a good reason for us to be over? Why do you keep saying that you ruined everything between us\u201d?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ruined?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would it be? Because you had the bad idea to put your penis inside her vagina?\u201d</p><p>His face took the exact expression you thought he would take. Shocked, mouth in a \u201co\u2019 shape, tilting his head to the side.</p><p>\u201cUh! \u00a0But, I almost got her pregnant\u00bb.</p><p>\u201cHobi, you had the right to have sex with your girlfriend. \u00a0You had a safe and reasonable sexual behavior, why should I be mad at you? \u00a0What hurts me is the love you had for her while I was so in love with you, the admiration in your eyes. That killed me, it still does. Of course, I wish you would have keep it in your pants love, but at the same time you were in a relationship with her. But man, 72 hours later, really?\u201d.</p><p>\u00abHey, she thought I was old-fashioned, not wanting to have sex on the first date, that I should live my life taking more risks\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abHoseok, nobody should ever disrespect a decision like that. I think it was a good decision because it was how you felt. Plus, you are nothing like dull or boring\u00bb. </p><p>Big tears came in the corner of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry I hurt you. So sorry\u201d.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok Hoseokie, it\u2019s behind us now\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s behind us? You are still up to have a relationship with me\u201d.</p><p>You tilt your head on the side and took your chin between your v-shaped fingers, mimicking his \u201cthinking\u201d expression.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Jung Hoseok, you will have to verify if I want to be your girlfriend soon. If you are capable to convince me that you love me and only me, I might be into it. \u00a0Maybe tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. \u00a0We don\u2019t want all this drama to be the set up for our new \u201cpossible\u201d life together, right?</p><p>\u201cAre you saying\u2026\u201d</p><p>You placed a finger in his beautiful lips and add:</p><p>\u00abWhy did you keep saying you ruined everything? Because for me, the only thing I see is a man being trapped by a manipulative woman the day he split with her. You told her you would take your responsibility as a father if it was true. If you would have told her to get an abortion or denied your responsibilities, you would have disappointed me big time. What could you do more? Hobi, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, you used a condom. Of course the lawyers of Big Hits have told you there was a tiny percentage of possibility, they have no choice. They have to tell you this because something like that may have happened in the medical literature. But it\u2019s not common You must have been crazy thinking she was pregnant\u2026 \u00bb.</p><p>\u00abYou are not disappointed at me?\u00bb</p><p>\u00abI won\u2019t lie. I wish you haven\u2019t slept with her at all. But, as I said, you were in a relationship. I am disappointed because we haven\u2019t talk to each other before. I am sad I saw admiration in your eyes when you were talking about her. But I was in a relationship too, not so long ago remember?\u00bb</p><p>\u00abI know, I still hate that man you introduced to us last year.\u00bb </p><p>\u00abI also believed it was impossible with you and tried with somebody else\u2026 I have no right to be mad at you for this when I did the exact same\u00bb.</p><p>When you realised that your hand was still in his, you took it back and smiled. </p><p>\u00abY/n, you are saying that, it\u2019s still possible between us. That I haven\u2019t ruined it all?\u00bb</p><p>\u00abHoseok, I will repeat what I just said. You will have to prove me that I am the only one you want. That I am the only one that you love. If I am convinced, it may be possible\u00bb you smiled at him.</p><p>You don\u2019t want to seems too rude or too demanding. You just don\u2019t want your relation to start \u00abofficially\u00bb the day he told you all this. \u00a0Just like him, you want the day that will be marked by a big X on the calendar will only remind you good memories. But you really don\u2019t want him to doubt for real so you told him:</p><p>\u00abHobi, the chances are really on your side you know because I, Jeon y/n, am so much in love with you that it hurts \u00bb</p><p>You were very happy when you heard the voice of Taemin and Jimin calling your name from the front door. Happy because you don\u2019t trust the fact that you or Hobi would have been able to wait for the next day to push things further.</p><p>\u00abY/n? Ladybug? Where are you?\u00bb</p><p>You heard Jimin making some noises with ustencils in the kitchen before he said.</p><p>\u00abHey, you ordered Tha\u00ef food?\u00bb</p><p>You kissed Hoseok\u2019s temple softly and whispered in his ears:</p><p>\u00abI don\u2019t know if I am happy or annoyed by them right now\u00bb.</p><p>Of course Taemin chose that exact moment to appear in the doorframe, when your lips are still on his temple. He went crazy.</p><p>\u00abJimin, Jiminie! Baby, we\u2019ll be godfathers soon, they were about to makeout\u00bb</p><p>\u00abOh! My! God!\u00bb Hoseok said.</p><p>Jimin came in the room and said, trying to keep his cool beside an overexcited Taemin.</p><p>\u00abI love your place, it\u2019s wonderful. We\u2019ll have a lot of couple diner here, right? Just the 4 of us?\u00bb</p><p>You see something changing in Taemin\u2019s eyes, for a nanosecond he was mad. You and Hobi stood up and when you went close to the boys, Taemin told Hobi, with a big smile, trying to act cute but still having a message to deliver:</p><p>\u00abYou break her heart again Jung Hoseok and I swear to god you\u2019ll be hang by the penis and peeled alive. You\u2019ve been noticed, thank you\u00bb.</p><p>You see Hoseok swallowing his saliva nervously before he answered:</p><p>\u00abIt\u2019s not my intention Taemin sunbaenim, believe me, I know she suffered enough lately. From now on, I hope it will be happiness only in her heart\u00bb</p><p>You and Hobi didn\u2019t take the time to explain the boys you were not \u00abofficially\u00bb a couple yet. They wouldn\u2019t have believed you anyway because the two of you couldn\u2019t stop holding hands, hug and smiled at each other like the young lovers do. In both your hearts, you knew it was just a matter of time anyway before you will be officially a couple. The sooner the better.</p><h2>2 days later, the night before the boys will quit for a 5 days trip</h2><p>3 gentle knock on your door, so gentle you were unsure you heard correctly. The security guard didn\u2019t call you via intercom after all, you must haven\u2019t heard correctly. The visitor repeat his gesture, there is no more doubt now. When you opened the door and saw Hoseok, you were overwhelmed by a lot of mixed feelings. Mostly relieved, after 2 days, you were starting to ask yourself what was taking him so long. Hoseok is not so patient, normally.</p><p>\u00abIt\u2019s been 43 hours since last time I saw you. You needed all that time to make sure I was the one\u00bb you said with a teasing voice as soon as you opened up the door.</p><p>\u00abWho said you are the one\u00bb? He answered, lifting only one eyebrow, obviously acting.</p><p>\u00abWell I hope I am, Jung Hoseok, I certainly hope I am\u00bb.</p><p>He came in your apartment and closed the door behind him, leaning his back against the door frame with his hands behind his back, looking at you in the eyes.</p><p>\u00abYou are so beautiful Hoseok. You are so, so perfectly beautiful\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abHey, I am the one suppose to convince the other, remember?\u00bb.</p><p>You came closer and encircled your arms around his waist, all your weight against him, gluing every little part of your body that could be. As soon as your bodies met, your nose took place in the crook of his neck and his cheek found his way against your temple. It was a soft but very demanding embrace, filled with love and desire. Still, he kept his hands crossed on his back.</p><p>\u00abHey, you missed me that much, huh?\u00bb He teased.</p><p>\u00abHobi, shut up please and kiss me\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abWhat?\u00bb He asked, really uncertain he heard.</p><p>\u00abLet me make myself clear, if you really want to use those beautiful lips and that equally beautiful tongue, I haven\u2019t checked though, make good use of them and kiss me\u00bb.</p><p>\u00abI thought I had to convince you that I love you, that you were the only one\u00bb</p><p>\u00abAm I your first choice baby\u00bb?</p><p>\u00abYou are my only choice y/n\u00bb</p><p>\u00abGood\u00bb</p><p>You didn\u2019t wait for him to kiss you, you kissed him. When you felt one of his hand on your side and the other one on your neck, you knew you were up to a passionate night with the man that you love and that loves you just as much.</p><p>\u00abYou know what my love?\u00bb he asked once you were lying on the bed, half of your clothes on the floor, hands all over each other, eager to finally make love. </p><p>\u00abTell me\u00bb You kissed his neck, your arms keeping him close above you.</p><p>\u00abI ain\u2019t really into sex the first night\u00bb he was teasing you, you could tell, barely able to contain his laughter.

I know, some of you told me you wanted her to be with Nam but in my mind, she can only love Hobi.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t he deserve all the love in the world, our little sunshine? (Yes ok, Nam too). Anyway, have fun reading it. Tell me what you thought of this serie if you want, or not. It&rsquo;s up to you! Here it is.</b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b><br /></b></p><p>You have to admit, your day was amazing. &nbsp;First day with so many smiles and laughter in a long time. It had started with a little physiotherapy session for your leg, which hurt to be honest but it has to be done. You are happy to be able to walk for long distances now, to dance almost like before, to move normally. There will be always 2 movements that you won&rsquo;t be able to do with your ankle: inversion and eversion. Those movements are impossible because of the metal plates and screw that keeps your bones together. Those impossible movements are the ones that will keep you away from the stage forever. You&rsquo;ll have to live with it, you have no other choice. But it&rsquo;s ok, you will find a way, your way.</p><p>Then you had a lunch date with Nam. He brought you to a little Japanese restaurant with sliding paper doors, painted with pink flowers and japanese script. You&rsquo;ve drink tea and eat fancy food, talked about life just like you always do. &nbsp;Having a conversation with him is always interesting. He&rsquo;s so brilliant and the way he sees things is often like you so, you just complete each other&rsquo;s opinion. It makes your conversation mutually rewarding and enriching. You talked philosophy and exchanged your thoughts on politic and on &ldquo;the Seungri case&rdquo;. &nbsp;You also laughed and behaved like children, foolishly challenging each other (the one who drinks his hot tea the quickest, the one who eats the slowest, who will be able to put the word &laquo;poop emoji&raquo; in the conversation with the waitress, etc). He walked back with you to your place after a 2 hours meal, kissed your cheeks before leaving and add &ldquo;good luck for your conversation with Hobi tonight&rdquo; before turning around on his feets and leaved with a beautiful dimple smile. You didn&rsquo;t talk about it with him, Hobi probably did.</p><p>This afternoon at 16h00, you haven&rsquo;t told anybody about it but, you had a meeting with the rector of the Seoul university. He offered you a one year contract, starting right now if you want because you can work from home. Your task would be to assist the teachers of the modern dance department by being the second evaluator of the students examinations. Basically, you wouldn&rsquo;t be in direct contact with students for now, just watching videos of their choreography and attribute them a score that will count for 50% of their marks on each evaluations, basically a good responsibility. You haven&rsquo;t decided yet, you don&rsquo;t know what you will do to be honest. It&rsquo;s a good job with good conditions and it keeps your passion for dance alive. You are just scared that you&rsquo;ll find it boring, the fact that you are not directly in the dance studio, where the action is. You will need to analyse it with Taemin, his opinion matters to you.</p><p>When you arrived home, you took a long shower, washed your hair, put on some loose pants and a t-shirt of your brother, placed your hair on the top of your head with in a messy bun and stayed bareface. Hoseok had texted you, wondering if you had eaten, offering to bring something on his way to your place. You agreed, sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to talk with a table between you.</p><p>You were so nervous to meet him, nervous about the things he had to say. According to him, there are things he needs to tell you that will hurt you. A lot of things have hurt you recently. As they say, you had to hit rock bottom. The only way you can go now, is up. </p><p>Waiting for Hoseok, you sat down to meditate for a few minutes but you have probably fell asleep because suddenly, the buzz of the intercom woke you up. </p><p>&ldquo;Miss Jeon, there is a man named Jung Hoseok here, may I let him in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you may ajussi. Thank you&rdquo;.</p><p>You have almost 2 minutes before Hoseok will reach your apartment. You take that time to nervously brush your teeth, use a washcloth of cold water on your face and apply some mascara. You have no more time to redo your hair, you can hear 3 light knock on the door. </p><p>&ldquo;Good evening y/n&rdquo;, he says with a sad smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Hobi&rdquo;.</p><p>As you can see his sadness and his tiredness, you take a step back to look at him from head to toes. You want to analyse every single detail, to make sure he&rsquo;s not sick or something. He has a big houseplant in one hand, a gift bag in another one and a take-out food. </p><p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; He asked, smiling shyly. Hoseok being shy, you see him more and more like that recently but you can&rsquo;t get use to it. He&rsquo;s so beautiful with that timid smile that your heart beat faster.</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry, I have no manners, of course you can come in&rdquo;. You moved to the side to let him enter. He looked everywhere and smiled brightly.</p><p>&ldquo;This place looks peaceful, I love it. May I have a visit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go, have a view while I take care of the take out. It smells Tha&iuml; food, Mmmmm. Come in the kitchen just over there when you are done&rdquo;, you said, pointing in the good direction.</p><p>He placed the gifs on the little table by the door and started to visit right away. He talked to you on his way to the living room.</p><p>&laquo;You are not afraid I will discover some of your secrets? Or that I will steal something?&raquo;</p><p>&laquo;No, not afraid at all. You can open all the drawers if you want, I don&rsquo;t care. Almost everything here is new, I ordered from the net. Can you believe I forgot to buy glasses and cups? We&rsquo;ll have to drink directly from the bottle&raquo;.</p><p>He was too busy to answer, he took you at your words because you heard him open the drawers in the washroom, this is so him. After a few minutes of complete silence, he was still not coming to join you. You decided to go and see what he was up to. You found him sitting in the big bamboo rocking chair of your bedroom, your favorite room of the apartment. &nbsp;All the furniture is in bamboo and wood, dyed in a light shade of grey, almost white. The walls, the bedding and the decorations are grey/white as well, only a blanket and a few cushions are colored with your favorite color. It&rsquo;s a large and bright room that lets the sun in through its garden doors. It&rsquo;s a peaceful place to sit and enjoy the view of the mountain in the background of your private floral little backyard. Hoseok is sitting there, with big tears in his eyes, looking outside of the window. &nbsp;He heard you coming in more than he saw you and started to talk right away..</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve messed up everything y/n. Everything&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hobi, talk to me. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p><p>You came in front of him and kneeled down, taking his hand in yours but he removed them as soon as he felt your contact.</p><p>&ldquo;Hobi, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was so happy to break up with Chae. So, happy that finally I could start something with you, and now everything is ruined again&rdquo;. He said snuffling.</p><p>&ldquo;You left her to be with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously&rdquo;.</p><p>You stood up and placed your little fist on your hips, frowning your eyebrows. He finds you beautiful like that and it made him even more sad, thinking everything was lost for good.</p><p>&ldquo;Jung Hoseok, don&rsquo;t talk to me like that, obviously obviously&rdquo; you repeated after him, &ldquo;as you can see, nothing is that obvious between us&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry y/n, you will never forgive me this&rdquo;. He cried and kept saying that he screwed everything and other things that you couldn&rsquo;t hear.</p><p>You need to place some distance between you and him, he doesn&rsquo;t want to take your hand anyway. You took a few steps back and when you felt your bed behind your calf you sat down, always looking at Hobi&rsquo;s eyes and face. He&rsquo;s in pain, you can tell. Seeing him like that hurts you more than you could have imagine. At this very moment, you would be able to negotiate your whole entire life for him to smile just 5 minutes again.</p><p>&ldquo;Hoseok, please tell me everything. Please, you&rsquo;re driving me crazy&rdquo;.</p><p>He finally needed to touch you, to take your hands in his. In his head, it&rsquo;s the last time you will accept to touch him. &nbsp;He came and sit beside you on the bed, took your hand in his, wrist resting on his thigh. You hate to see him like that, about to burst. You placed your free arm around him and laid your head on his shoulder and started to caress his back softly. You don&rsquo;t know what he has to say but you need to comfort him.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how to start, this is so big&rdquo;.</p><p>&laquo;You killed somebody? Worse, you killed a cat? You will go to jail soon?&raquo;.</p><p>&laquo;WHAAAAAT? No! Girl, of course not. Who do you think I am?&raquo;</p><p>You know Hobi, he would have never done something like that of course. </p><p>&laquo;Well then, start to talk, my imagination is playing with my head right now. Start with the beginning ok? One step at the time and we&rsquo;ll get there. Let&rsquo;s start with the night we talked together, you were not sure at all who you would pick if Chae was crying like I was&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, let&rsquo;s start there. You&rsquo;re right love, but not totally.&raquo;</p><p>Love. He called you love. Hearing that word in his mouth made you so soft inside, you were melting like ice cream under the summer sun.</p><p>&ldquo;I never said I would choose her over you. I was just too much in pain to think straight, to see things correctly. I said I needed to take a step back. I knew you were in love with me and I didn&rsquo;t want to play with your feelings. But you are not wrong either, my new feelings for her were messing up with my head. I had to get over you at some point and start something with her, but then I learned you loved me back, you see, the big mess there?&rdquo;</p><p>You see it, indeed. You not only see it but &laquo;feel&raquo; direct in your heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, ok, i guess&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I woke up the morning after, you were already gone for your hospital appointments. I was so glad you were there when I came back that night, although I couldn&rsquo;t tell you anything. I wanted to break up with Chae first.&rdquo;</p><p>He took a deep breath in. You decided that he was calm enough so you stopped to stroke his back but didn&rsquo;t change position.</p><p>&ldquo;For me, it was clear, you were the one, YOU and nobody else. But, I wanted to break up with her first so we can start together perfectly. &nbsp;I was screaming inside for you to wait for me. Thinking that we would be reunited soon made me happy but as soon as I realized the sadness in your eyes, I went down myself. That&rsquo;s when I kissed your cheek and went in my room&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;You could have give me a sign you know, so I could stop crying&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;No, because I wanted us to start on a pure way, perfectly free from everything. I didn&rsquo;t want you to be the third girl and also have to tell our kids later that I was a cheater&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Our kids? Ok well, that&rsquo;s a good point I guess. But we did kiss while you were with her&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;We did, I know. I never said I was perfect&rdquo;.</p><p>You completely understand. You will never regret that kiss though, just thinking about the taste of his tongue is enough to make you want another one right now. </p><p>&ldquo;Then, you chose to spend the few next days with Taemin, which I completely understand. To be honest, if you had stayed, I would have betrayed myself and declared my love&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s bringing us to that night, when you broke up with her&hellip;. right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</p><p>He started to cry again, tears coming from his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Omg, I can&rsquo;t believe I thought it was a good idea to tell you this. You will be so sad and disappointed. I hope you will forgive me&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Hobi, spit it, please I am dying to know.&rdquo; &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t wait any longer. He took a deep breath in and started to tell you.</p><p>&ldquo;When I arrived at her dorms, we went in her room and started to talk, she was peculiarly happy that night. I stopped her and told her I had something important to say. I told her I was not in love with her, that I never was. Actually, I never told her I loved her but anyway&hellip; &nbsp;I add that the real love of my life was somebody else and that I wanted to start something with her. &nbsp;When she tried to negotiate, asking for another chance, I told her I was sorry but it was a final decision. I told her, it was a long time love story and that she can&rsquo;t compete with the real love of my life&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! My! God! Hobi, this is so beautiful. I am the one, right?&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled at your comment.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re the one but I&rsquo;m not done love&hellip; I&rsquo;m not done. That&rsquo;s when she served me a bomb on a silver platter&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! No! I see where you are going with this&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She told me she was pregnant from my child&rdquo;.</p><p>You cannot believe it. Several thoughts are messing up with your brain right now. Mostly, you don&rsquo;t want him to ever have sex with her, even though you cannot be mad because, she was his girlfriend. Nevertheless, thinking about them kissing is enough to feel your head spin fast, you don&rsquo;t want to imagine anything else. Plus, is it possible? Can he have a baby with her?</p><p>He was crying, big tears flooding his cheeks, sobbing. He was desperately grabbing your shirt with his free hand like a little child would do, not knowing what else to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait Hoseok, let&rsquo;s think about it. Let&rsquo;s analyse ok?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have analysed it all the way possible, me, the managers, the lawyer of Big Hits. We used a condom for god&rsquo;s sake. But there was a tiny, mini, little fraction of a percentage that it could have been true&raquo;.</p><p>Because you were analyzing this fast in your head, you didn&rsquo;t realised he was speaking with the past, conditional tense. In your mind, there&rsquo;s no possibility it can be true. It was not so long ago since their first date. Not even a month. Not even the time to realise your periods were late, well in your case. And if you realised you are late, it probably means you were not in the good period to procreate. Unless she has irregular periods. You will have to calculate this with a calendar but like that, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. Plus, they used a condom&hellip;</p><p>He became calm again and add:</p><p>&laquo;I see you are calculating jelly bean, wait for the rest of the story. &nbsp;But no, she is not pregnant. Let me finish&hellip;&raquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;Wait Hobi, how many times did you slept with her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Once only, 4 days after our first date. We never had the occasion to be alone after that, our schedules being what they are&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Hoseok, it was almost impossible that you were the father then if she was pregnant. If you want my opinion, she tried to hooked you the only way she could. How could she have known she was pregnant in such a short time? She told you this not even 3 weeks after you had sex.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had not thought so coldly on the spot, probably shocked because of the pregnancy test I saw, it was positive. Anyway, as soon as I told the staff the morning after, they consulted the lawyers of the company that consulted a gynecologist and there was an infime percentage it could have been true. Still, I was panicking. I felt like I was in a nightmare. I didn&rsquo;t want to have a child with a woman I don&rsquo;t love.&raquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not saying she was not pregnant. I am saying she may have been before you slept with her, if she was&hellip; Also, technically, if you used a condom, chances were almost nonexistent&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I don&rsquo;t want to give you too much information that could hurt you but you know, after we removed the condom, if we touch the girl &laquo;there&raquo; with semen on our fingers, some spermatozoids can swim their way up&raquo;</p><p>&laquo;Oh! I figured Hoseok, I figured&hellip; but what can I say, i didn&rsquo;t believe it for a second. Tell me what you told her about the baby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What have you told her about that baby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say congratulations if it&rsquo;s what you mean. I told her that if the child is mine, I would take responsibility. That&rsquo;s the only thing I said before I left&raquo;.</p><p>You were so proud of the answer he gave that a big smile appeared on your face. He told her he would take his responsibility but he didn&rsquo;t flinch at her manipulation attempt. He stared at you, surprised by your reaction. He thought you would be destroyed by the news.</p><p>&ldquo;What? What&rsquo;s wrong with my face?&rdquo; You asked him when you realised he was fixing you.</p><p>&ldquo;There is nothing wrong with your face. Nothing at all&rdquo; he said, serious.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, continue your story please&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it. Big Hits lawyers called her lawyer, they asked for a blood test. That&rsquo;s when she said she have lost the baby. That is the freshest news I had and it was this morning&raquo;.</p><p>&laquo;She was never pregnant Hoseok. Never&raquo;.</p><p>He was so calm all of sudden. Serious, scared and concentrated on your face.</p><p>&laquo;y/n, you are so calm&raquo;.</p><p>&laquo;To be honest Hobi, I&rsquo;m still waiting for a good reason for us to be over? Why do you keep saying that you ruined everything between us&rdquo;?</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not ruined?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why would it be? Because you had the bad idea to put your penis inside her vagina?&rdquo;</p><p>His face took the exact expression you thought he would take. Shocked, mouth in a &ldquo;o&rsquo; shape, tilting his head to the side.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh! &nbsp;But, I almost got her pregnant&raquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Hobi, you had the right to have sex with your girlfriend. &nbsp;You had a safe and reasonable sexual behavior, why should I be mad at you? &nbsp;What hurts me is the love you had for her while I was so in love with you, the admiration in your eyes. That killed me, it still does. Of course, I wish you would have keep it in your pants love, but at the same time you were in a relationship with her. But man, 72 hours later, really?&rdquo;.</p><p>&laquo;Hey, she thought I was old-fashioned, not wanting to have sex on the first date, that I should live my life taking more risks&raquo;.</p><p>&laquo;Hoseok, nobody should ever disrespect a decision like that. I think it was a good decision because it was how you felt. Plus, you are nothing like dull or boring&raquo;. </p><p>Big tears came in the corner of his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry I hurt you. So sorry&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok Hoseokie, it&rsquo;s behind us now&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean it&rsquo;s behind us? You are still up to have a relationship with me&rdquo;.</p><p>You tilt your head on the side and took your chin between your v-shaped fingers, mimicking his &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; expression.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Jung Hoseok, you will have to verify if I want to be your girlfriend soon. If you are capable to convince me that you love me and only me, I might be into it. &nbsp;Maybe tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t want all this drama to be the set up for our new &ldquo;possible&rdquo; life together, right?</p><p>&ldquo;Are you saying&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You placed a finger in his beautiful lips and add:</p><p>&laquo;Why did you keep saying you ruined everything? Because for me, the only thing I see is a man being trapped by a manipulative woman the day he split with her. You told her you would take your responsibility as a father if it was true. If you would have told her to get an abortion or denied your responsibilities, you would have disappointed me big time. What could you do more? Hobi, you didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong, you used a condom. Of course the lawyers of Big Hits have told you there was a tiny percentage of possibility, they have no choice. They have to tell you this because something like that may have happened in the medical literature. But it&rsquo;s not common You must have been crazy thinking she was pregnant&hellip; &raquo;.</p><p>&laquo;You are not disappointed at me?&raquo;</p><p>&laquo;I won&rsquo;t lie. I wish you haven&rsquo;t slept with her at all. But, as I said, you were in a relationship. I am disappointed because we haven&rsquo;t talk to each other before. I am sad I saw admiration in your eyes when you were talking about her. But I was in a relationship too, not so long ago remember?&raquo;</p><p>&laquo;I know, I still hate that man you introduced to us last year.&raquo; </p><p>&laquo;I also believed it was impossible with you and tried with somebody else&hellip; I have no right to be mad at you for this when I did the exact same&raquo;.</p><p>When you realised that your hand was still in his, you took it back and smiled. </p><p>&laquo;Y/n, you are saying that, it&rsquo;s still possible between us. That I haven&rsquo;t ruined it all?&raquo;</p><p>&laquo;Hoseok, I will repeat what I just said. You will have to prove me that I am the only one you want. That I am the only one that you love. If I am convinced, it may be possible&raquo; you smiled at him.</p><p>You don&rsquo;t want to seems too rude or too demanding. You just don&rsquo;t want your relation to start &laquo;officially&raquo; the day he told you all this. &nbsp;Just like him, you want the day that will be marked by a big X on the calendar will only remind you good memories. But you really don&rsquo;t want him to doubt for real so you told him:</p><p>&laquo;Hobi, the chances are really on your side you know because I, Jeon y/n, am so much in love with you that it hurts &raquo;</p><p>You were very happy when you heard the voice of Taemin and Jimin calling your name from the front door. Happy because you don&rsquo;t trust the fact that you or Hobi would have been able to wait for the next day to push things further.</p><p>&laquo;Y/n? Ladybug? Where are you?&raquo;</p><p>You heard Jimin making some noises with ustencils in the kitchen before he said.</p><p>&laquo;Hey, you ordered Tha&iuml; food?&raquo;</p><p>You kissed Hoseok&rsquo;s temple softly and whispered in his ears:</p><p>&laquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I am happy or annoyed by them right now&raquo;.</p><p>Of course Taemin chose that exact moment to appear in the doorframe, when your lips are still on his temple. He went crazy.</p><p>&laquo;Jimin, Jiminie! Baby, we&rsquo;ll be godfathers soon, they were about to makeout&raquo;</p><p>&laquo;Oh! My! God!&raquo; Hoseok said.</p><p>Jimin came in the room and said, trying to keep his cool beside an overexcited Taemin.</p><p>&laquo;I love your place, it&rsquo;s wonderful. We&rsquo;ll have a lot of couple diner here, right? Just the 4 of us?&raquo;</p><p>You see something changing in Taemin&rsquo;s eyes, for a nanosecond he was mad. You and Hobi stood up and when you went close to the boys, Taemin told Hobi, with a big smile, trying to act cute but still having a message to deliver:</p><p>&laquo;You break her heart again Jung Hoseok and I swear to god you&rsquo;ll be hang by the penis and peeled alive. You&rsquo;ve been noticed, thank you&raquo;.</p><p>You see Hoseok swallowing his saliva nervously before he answered:</p><p>&laquo;It&rsquo;s not my intention Taemin sunbaenim, believe me, I know she suffered enough lately. From now on, I hope it will be happiness only in her heart&raquo;</p><p>You and Hobi didn&rsquo;t take the time to explain the boys you were not &laquo;officially&raquo; a couple yet. They wouldn&rsquo;t have believed you anyway because the two of you couldn&rsquo;t stop holding hands, hug and smiled at each other like the young lovers do. In both your hearts, you knew it was just a matter of time anyway before you will be officially a couple. The sooner the better.</p><h2>2 days later, the night before the boys will quit for a 5 days trip</h2><p>3 gentle knock on your door, so gentle you were unsure you heard correctly. The security guard didn&rsquo;t call you via intercom after all, you must haven&rsquo;t heard correctly. The visitor repeat his gesture, there is no more doubt now. When you opened the door and saw Hoseok, you were overwhelmed by a lot of mixed feelings. Mostly relieved, after 2 days, you were starting to ask yourself what was taking him so long. Hoseok is not so patient, normally.</p><p>&laquo;It&rsquo;s been 43 hours since last time I saw you. You needed all that time to make sure I was the one&raquo; you said with a teasing voice as soon as you opened up the door.</p><p>&laquo;Who said you are the one&raquo;? He answered, lifting only one eyebrow, obviously acting.</p><p>&laquo;Well I hope I am, Jung Hoseok, I certainly hope I am&raquo;.</p><p>He came in your apartment and closed the door behind him, leaning his back against the door frame with his hands behind his back, looking at you in the eyes.</p><p>&laquo;You are so beautiful Hoseok. You are so, so perfectly beautiful&raquo;.</p><p>&laquo;Hey, I am the one suppose to convince the other, remember?&raquo;.</p><p>You came closer and encircled your arms around his waist, all your weight against him, gluing every little part of your body that could be. As soon as your bodies met, your nose took place in the crook of his neck and his cheek found his way against your temple. It was a soft but very demanding embrace, filled with love and desire. Still, he kept his hands crossed on his back.</p><p>&laquo;Hey, you missed me that much, huh?&raquo; He teased.</p><p>&laquo;Hobi, shut up please and kiss me&raquo;.</p><p>&laquo;What?&raquo; He asked, really uncertain he heard.</p><p>&laquo;Let me make myself clear, if you really want to use those beautiful lips and that equally beautiful tongue, I haven&rsquo;t checked though, make good use of them and kiss me&raquo;.</p><p>&laquo;I thought I had to convince you that I love you, that you were the only one&raquo;</p><p>&laquo;Am I your first choice baby&raquo;?</p><p>&laquo;You are my only choice y/n&raquo;</p><p>&laquo;Good&raquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t wait for him to kiss you, you kissed him. When you felt one of his hand on your side and the other one on your neck, you knew you were up to a passionate night with the man that you love and that loves you just as much.</p><p>&laquo;You know what my love?&raquo; he asked once you were lying on the bed, half of your clothes on the floor, hands all over each other, eager to finally make love. </p><p>&laquo;Tell me&raquo; You kissed his neck, your arms keeping him close above you.</p><p>&laquo;I ain&rsquo;t really into sex the first night&raquo; he was teasing you, you could tell, barely able to contain his laughter. You started to laughed.</p><p>&laquo;That&rsquo;s a shame, I might forget all the little things I wanted to do to you next time&raquo;.</p><p>&laquo;Well then, we may proceed&raquo; He licked your lower lip and bite it, not so gently.</p><p>&laquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought&raquo;.</p><p>If you ever have questioned your love for him, which never happened, at that very moment all your doubt died, like that. This is exactly the relation you&rsquo;ve been dreaming of, filled with laughter, complicity, passion, trust and love. There is no doubt in your mind he loves you, love is strong, love has won.</p>",

I know, some of you told me you wanted her to be with Nam but in my mind, she can only love Hobi.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t he deserve all the love in the world, our little sunshine? (Yes ok, Nam too). Anyway, have fun reading it. Tell me what you thought of this serie if you want, or not. It&rsquo;s up to you! Here it is.</b></p>\n<figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b><br /></b></p>\n<p>You have to admit, your day was amazing. &nbsp;First day with so many smiles and laughter in a long time. It had started with a little physiotherapy session for your leg, which hurt to be honest but it has to be done. You are happy to be able to walk for long distances now, to dance almost like before, to move normally. There will be always 2 movements that you won&rsquo;t be able to do with your ankle: inversion and eversion. Those movements are impossible because of the metal plates and screw that keeps your bones together. Those impossible movements are the ones that will keep you away from the stage forever. You&rsquo;ll have to live with it, you have no other choice. But it&rsquo;s ok, you will find a way, your way.</p>\n<p>Then you had a lunch date with Nam. He brought you to a little Japanese restaurant with sliding paper doors, painted with pink flowers and japanese script. You&rsquo;ve drink tea and eat fancy food, talked about life just like you always do. &nbsp;Having a conversation with him is always interesting. He&rsquo;s so brilliant and the way he sees things is often like you so, you just complete each other&rsquo;s opinion. It makes your conversation mutually rewarding and enriching. You talked philosophy and exchanged your thoughts on politic and on &ldquo;the Seungri case&rdquo;. &nbsp;You also laughed and behaved like children, foolishly challenging each other (the one who drinks his hot tea the quickest, the one who eats the slowest, who will be able to put the word &laquo;poop emoji&raquo; in the conversation with the waitress, etc). He walked back with you to your place after a 2 hours meal, kissed your cheeks before leaving and add &ldquo;good luck for your conversation with Hobi tonight&rdquo; before turning around on his feets and leaved with a beautiful dimple smile. You didn&rsquo;t talk about it with him, Hobi probably did.</p>\n</p>",
