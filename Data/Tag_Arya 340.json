        "body": "<p><b>Arya x Gendry Week; Day 2: caught Red-Handed</b></p><p>&ldquo;So why don\u2019t you tell me about your friend?&rdquo;<br/>Arya stared at her sister, not really knowing what to answer to the question that lingered in the air. Since she started hanging out with Gendry after he arrived in Winterfell, her family decided that there was something other than friendship going on between the two of them but there was nothing happening. Yes, sometimes she liked to admire his ocean blue eyes or the outlines of his muscles when he worked but nothing strange was going on. Absolutely nothing.<br/>&ldquo;He is my friend. That&rsquo;s all there is to say. What do you want me to tell you?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to tell me anything&rdquo;, Sansa said, her eyes showing the thoughts that she didn&rsquo;t dare to say out loud. &ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t look like friends, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Yea, but that is what we are. Friends. I don&rsquo;t understand why everyone in Winterfell keeps assuming that Gendry is my secret lover. We just like to spar with each other and talk about swords. It is not that hard to grasp.&rdquo;<br/>Her sister looked at her as if she was stupid. Sansa was the one person at home that truly believed that Gendry and Arya had something going on between the two of them, but she just grinned at her sister&rsquo;s futile attempts to hide her true feelings regarding her &ldquo;friend&rdquo;.<br/>&ldquo;Sure Arya. When you two start doing a different kind of &quot;sparring&rdquo;, just tell me I was right, as usual.&ldquo;<br/>With this remark, Sansa left the room leaving Arya gaping at the wall, \u00a0shocked at her sister&rsquo;s intelligent, but also improper use of words.</p><p>Arya watched him hitting the metal at the forge, again and again, bending the material at his will. \u00a0He\u2019s strong, she thought, as she continued to watch him do his work.<br/>&quot;How did the meeting with your sister go?&rdquo;, Gendry asked, wiping the sweat of his forehead and making Arya &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; from her inner world.<br/>&ldquo;It went well. Sansa talked about the usual stuff&rdquo;, Arya blurted, desperately wanting to change the course that the conversation was headed. &ldquo; Why do you ask?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;You seem a little bit distracted. It looks like the conversation got you thinking about something&rdquo;, he uttered, sitting beside her on the table filled with swords and shields to fix.<br/>&ldquo;Sansa likes to put people confused about their feelings regarding anyone or anything. Who is she to assume who I want and don&rsquo;t want to fuck?&rdquo;, Arya snarled, noticing the words that came out of her mouth a bit too late.<br/>Gendry&rsquo;s eyes darted to Arya, stunned by what he had just heard. He also knew about the rumors that lived in the people&rsquo;s mouths, rumors about his relationship with Arya.<br/>&ldquo;Gendry, I&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t mean to say that&rdquo;, she stuttered, something that she only did when she was feeling mortified<br/>Without a warning, his mouth was pressed to hers, leaving her astonished at the outcome of their conversation. Soon enough, her astonishment left the room only to be replaced with a sense of lust so strong that almost turned her body into a quivering mess.

        "body": "<h1>Eye Contact</h1><p>Gendry was early for supper that day, he stood near one of the tall walls in the Winterfell hall waiting for the rest to arrive. His fingers kept tugging his shirt down and the little sounds his boots made kept betraying he was fidgeting, despite having lunched and dinned with the Royals for weeks. He approached the table when Davos, Jon and Lady Sansa walked through the doors, and silently sat down beside the elder of the group when he took his place on the left side of Jon.</p><p>Jon asked about Gendry&rsquo;s day and joked about them going hunting the following morning. Lady Sansa smiled at that. They all knew he was rubbish at it, his feet hit the ground with too much force, and it had been decided he would stay on his horse for the duration of the hunt when he alone, had managed to scare two boars and a stag one morning. Gendry never minded the teasing, it made Jon smile, and Jon had seldom smiled in a long time.</p><p>Arya walked in late as she always did. Any other day she would have entered the hall with Gendry following suit, but not that day. &rsquo;<i>Because you are stubborn and she has gone mad&rsquo; </i>Gendry told himself as he looked down and ate his stew. Halfway through the meal, however, Davos seemed to decide he had had enough.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cEating.\u201d Gendry answered with the false confusion that Davos saw right through.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do, then? To the little lady, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy&rsquo;d you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the little lady is staring at you and grabbing the hilt of her sword, and we both know she is more than capable of murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201c Arya would never murder me\u201d Gendry snorted. \u201cIt&rsquo;s not my fault she&rsquo;s gone mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you did something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did nothing.\u201d He looked up to catch Arya looking straight at him, he smiled and got a grimace in return. \u201cSee,\u201d he told Davos \u201cI did nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, why does she keep staring like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she&rsquo;s gone mental.\u201d Gendry said stabbing a carrot that was just a tad too raw with excessive force. To his utter embarrassment, the traitorous vegetable slipped from his plate and flew directly to the Lady Sansa&rsquo;s wine-filled cup, making the Dornish red spill on her face. Gendry froze, the apologies he was going to blabber died in his throat, Arya&rsquo;s hand instinctively gripped her brand new sword, and Jon \u2026 Jon started laughing.

Gendry supposed he did not know what to expect but still it was annoying as all get out. Gendry was barely paying him any mind, watching the girl that had attracted all of their attentions (the whole room really, it wasn\u2019t just their trio), with her spontaneous shout. Somehow it was louder than Lommy and Hot Pie\u2019s bickering over how they\u2019d tell the story of the scar that was forming on his forehead. There was bears in some version, but none of it was true. Gendry was certain they just didn\u2019t want to get him in trouble for assaulting someone, which technically he\u2019d done. Only because they were threatening these two fucking morons.<b><br/></b></p><p>Gendry was tough, the bruises that would form on his chest by the morning hardly bothered him, but the pulsing wound on his forehead, that really really hurt. Before he\u2019d been trying his best to distract himself from it. Now, he was merely interested in her eyes. Gray, like an approaching storm, silver like the steel of a machine. Oh but she was hardly a machine. No, that would be stupid. She had a pulse, unlike most of his company. Aside from these two.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s leaving,\u201d Hot Pie whispered across Lommy\u2019s lap into Gendry\u2019s ear. He furrowed his eyebrows and glanced to his smaller, rotund friend. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already gone,\u201d He said. She\u2019d been gone for several minutes. The girl. What had the clerk announced when she left? Arry? Rya? Something\u2026 like that. </p><p>\u201cNot her her! The other clerk! She\u2019s gone! Now\u2019s our chance!\u201d Hot Pie said, before practically leaping to his feet and scurrying across the room, vaguely sneaky. It wasn\u2019t, but it looked like what Hot Pie thought sneaky was. Lommy was already joining Hot Pie when Gendry called for them to stop. Whisper called.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d No response, just more \u201csneaking\u201d. He followed, lumbering to his feet, the blood pounding in his forehead. He really needed to lie down. They slipped around the counter, and when Gendry met them, Hot Pie was slowly opening the door. \u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d Gendry repeated. They looked at him. Clearly they had discussed this while he had been obsessing over her eyes. This is what he got for not listening to him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re finding out her name and shit from the papers. Obviously.\u201d Lommy answered, and just like that they were inside the door. Gendry swore under his breath and looked around, whirling his head back and forth to try and catch sight of anyone around, like you know, hospital employees. Nothing. He swore again, then followed in. Now on the opposite side of the counter from where they had been. A few of the other people waiting noticed, but they didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cThis is so creepy and stalkery!\u201d Gendry protested, but they weren\u2019t listening to him. They looked through all of the papers, rooting through binders quickly. He shook his head and began to look through them too, the ones right where the clerks had been standing.</p><p>A bell rung, the sound of the door opening, and a woman and a little girl walked in, the girl looking that special kind of miserable that only a very sick person can quite reach. Lommy and Hot Pie quickly ducked underneath the counter and hissed at him to pretend to be a clerk. He looked at them, miffed at their ability to get him into the worst fucking situations.</p><p>\u201cEXCUSE ME,\u201d The mother announced loudly, calling everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cMy girl needs help. Now.\u201d Gendry\u2019s mind raced. What the fuck did clerks do. Hand paperwork out. He had to find that. He did, fortunately quickly, and looked up to the woman, putting it out on the counter.</p><p>\u201cJust fill that out, I think.\u201d Gendry said. Then he tried to smile like a helpful clerk. The woman was very confused, judging by the expression and gestured towards her forehead. Right. He was bleeding profusely. He moved his own hand up and winced as he touched it. \u201cThis? Nothing. Please, take a seat.\u201d They did hesitantly. He also wasn\u2019t in hospital scrubs. Gendry looked down to a tittering Lommy and Hot Pie, and swore at them. Then he looked back to the papers, and found it. </p><p>\u201cArya Stark,\u201d He whispered, and suddenly knowing her name. That made it all okay. Every bit of it. He knew her name, Arya. Arya Stark. It was wonderful, he could sing it aloud like in West Side Story. A cough came from behind him, and he and his two friends all turned simultaneously. There a clerk was standing, tapping her foot, arms crossed. </p><p>\u201cWe were just going!\u201d Hot Pie assured her, as they scrambled away. Arya Stark. With the gray eyes. Fuck he was not going to forget that for a long time.</p>",

Now.\u201d Gendry\u2019s mind raced. What the fuck did clerks do. Hand paperwork out. He had to find that. He did, fortunately quickly, and looked up to the woman, putting it out on the counter.</p><p>\u201cJust fill that out, I think.\u201d Gendry said. Then he tried to smile like a helpful clerk. The woman was very confused, judging by the expression and gestured towards her forehead. Right. He was bleeding profusely. He moved his own hand up and winced as he touched it. \u201cThis? Nothing. Please, take a seat.\u201d They did hesitantly. He also wasn\u2019t in hospital scrubs. Gendry looked down to a tittering Lommy and Hot Pie, and swore at them.

Arya Stark. It was wonderful, he could sing it aloud like in West Side Story. A cough came from behind him, and he and his two friends all turned simultaneously. There a clerk was standing, tapping her foot, arms crossed. </p><p>\u201cWe were just going!\u201d Hot Pie assured her, as they scrambled away. Arya Stark. With the gray eyes.

                "content": "<p><b>Arya x Gendry Week; Day 2: Caught Red-Handed</b></p><p><b>A continuation of yesterday!</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;She was so hot, dude, dude!&rdquo; Lommy would not shut up. Gendry supposed he did not know what to expect but still it was annoying as all get out. Gendry was barely paying him any mind, watching the girl that had attracted all of their attentions (the whole room really, it wasn&rsquo;t just their trio), with her spontaneous shout. Somehow it was louder than Lommy and Hot Pie&rsquo;s bickering over how they&rsquo;d tell the story of the scar that was forming on his forehead. There was bears in some version, but none of it was true. Gendry was certain they just didn&rsquo;t want to get him in trouble for assaulting someone, which technically he&rsquo;d done. Only because they were threatening these two fucking morons.<b><br /></b></p><p>Gendry was tough, the bruises that would form on his chest by the morning hardly bothered him, but the pulsing wound on his forehead, that really really hurt. Before he&rsquo;d been trying his best to distract himself from it. Now, he was merely interested in her eyes. Gray, like an approaching storm, silver like the steel of a machine. Oh but she was hardly a machine. No, that would be stupid. She had a pulse, unlike most of his company. Aside from these two.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s leaving,&rdquo; Hot Pie whispered across Lommy&rsquo;s lap into Gendry&rsquo;s ear. He furrowed his eyebrows and glanced to his smaller, rotund friend. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s already gone,&rdquo; He said. She&rsquo;d been gone for several minutes. The girl. What had the clerk announced when she left? Arry? Rya? Something&hellip; like that. </p><p>&ldquo;Not her her! The other clerk! She&rsquo;s gone! Now&rsquo;s our chance!&rdquo; Hot Pie said, before practically leaping to his feet and scurrying across the room, vaguely sneaky. It wasn&rsquo;t, but it looked like what Hot Pie thought sneaky was. Lommy was already joining Hot Pie when Gendry called for them to stop. Whisper called.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing!&rdquo; No response, just more &ldquo;sneaking&rdquo;. He followed, lumbering to his feet, the blood pounding in his forehead. He really needed to lie down. They slipped around the counter, and when Gendry met them, Hot Pie was slowly opening the door. &ldquo;What are you doing!&rdquo; Gendry repeated. They looked at him. Clearly they had discussed this while he had been obsessing over her eyes. This is what he got for not listening to him.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re finding out her name and shit from the papers. Obviously.&rdquo; Lommy answered, and just like that they were inside the door. Gendry swore under his breath and looked around, whirling his head back and forth to try and catch sight of anyone around, like you know, hospital employees. Nothing. He swore again, then followed in. Now on the opposite side of the counter from where they had been.

A thousand memories rushed to her mind like a flood, not leaving a single crevice in her tormented head for peace or calmness.</p><p>\u201c Are you alright?
