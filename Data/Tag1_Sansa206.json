I know you have many asks so no rush at all :) I saw a gifset recently with a Willas quote comparing Sansa to glass roses and it reminded me very much of the winter roses associated with Lyanna especially a part of them being displayed in windows and in GoT the blue roses in the stained glass of the throne room. I'm not at this passage in the books yet (first time reading right now) so I was wondering if you know of any metas expanding on these potential parallels? Thank you for your time!",

        "question": "You know those tales where two star crossed lovers are forbidden from seeing each other, but the girl/boy defies their family for love, and in the end, the family realizes they were keeping true love at bay? I think that was Sansa and what she believed when she went to Cersei. But it was a subverted trope in the end. Instead of the family being wrong in the end, they were actually right and Sansa ends up in an abusive relationship with a boy she thought was her prince charming. (part 1)",
        "answer": "<blockquote><p>\n\nNormally in these stories, one roots for the star crossed lovers to unite and change the minds of the ignorant family. But in this case, Joffrey was no Prince Charming and Sansa, believing he was &amp; that she was having true love taken from her (just like in the tales), rushes to intervene, in order to hold onto a love story she thought existed. And Joffrey certainly played the role of a perfect gentleman save for the Trident. It was easy to bury that horrid act under mountains of kindness. (pt 2)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Yes absolutely. Sansa thought she was fighting for her love by asking Cersei to intervene but the thing is I don\u2019t think she thought she was in a song. Those stories influenced her greatly sure but in this case, she went to Cersei after she saw that Ned willing to accomodate Arya by bringing her water dancer. He was breaking a betrothal without explaining why while simultaneously rewarding Arya. It was the Trident all over again, only this time Sansa didn\u2019t want to obediently weep. If Ned bothered to talk to her like he talked to Arya, Sansa would have never gone to Cersei because she wasn\u2019t unreasonable or stupid.\u00a0</p><p>In fact I\u2019ll go as far as to say that scene had little to do with Joffrey and a lot to do with Sansa\u2019s daddy issues. She was never close to Ned despite being as perfect a lady as anyone can be. Meanwhile in Sansa\u2019s eyes Arya could break every rule and Ned would be warm and loving the way he rarely was with Sansa. It made Sansa feel inadequate and was a big part of her self esteem issues.</p>",
