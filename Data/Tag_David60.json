It's likely I do not sail your ship, but I don't wank and expect visitors to play nicely as well. That includes not adding hate or negativity to my posts, altering them to suit your own ships, or removing my original comments. If you do, you will be blocked.\nIRL they call me Doctor. Yep, I'm that old. Sometimes I write things that other people watch. It's all good! I like mocha latte with bourbon. A lot.",

He used the chameleon arch to become John Smith, a perfectly ordinary human being, a man with his head in the clouds perhaps a bit too much. He was a school teacher who dreamed of being a Lord of Time. His dreams were filled with fantastical, almost fairytale-like adventures with monsters and aliens and a tiny, enormous, impossible box that travels anywhere and anywhen in the universe. And she was there, in his dreams. Her face was in his dreams, even before he knew her (he had proof, too; he drew her in his Journal of Impossible Things before he met her). She made John Smith fall in love and showed the Doctor what it was like to be normal for once. They were married and the Doctor almost had a chance at an ordinary, simple, beautiful life. But they found him, and John Smith had to wake up from his dream of an ordinary life and become the Doctor again. He left her behind, because she was just a fairytale. He didn\u2019t know he would meet her again.</p><p><b>John II</b> \u2013 <i>Fobwatched Twelfth Doctor \u2013 Peter Capaldi \u2013 #Journal-of-Impossible-Things-Volume-II / #The-Newest-Time-Lord \u2013 Doctor Who, Time Traveler\u2019s Wife Whoniverse</i></p><p>Anna finds out she is pregnant, and Anna and the Doctor decide it is best to use the chameleon arch to turn him back into John Smith, and settle down on Earth until the baby is old enough for it to be safe for them to travel together. They live in the 21st century, which takes some getting used to for John, since he was from 1913, but he adjusts quickly. He gets a job as a schoolteacher again and continues to write his dreams down in his updated version of the Journal of Impossible Things, only this time knowing it is all real. Anna secretly works for UNIT to do her best to keep trouble away from the Doctor and the baby while the Doctor is human and the baby is young, trying to give them as normal a life as possible. Except for Him, of course. Their sentient ex-war machine \u201cLiving Construct\u201d companion who has basically taken on the role of nanny while they\u2019re grounded on Earth. That part is still a little unusual. Also that the Doctor still talks to his son through his watch, and sometimes the Doctor\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger (from another life), literally, shows up.</p><p><b>John III</b> \u2013 <i>Human John \u2013 Eddie Redmayne \u2013 #Journal-of-Impossible-Things-Volume-III / #A-Life-Of-His-Own \u2013 Doctor Who, Time Traveler\u2019s Wife Whoniverse</i></p><p>After the Doctor gets stuck in the confession dial for four and a half billion years, he has a lot of emotional issues to sort out. He can deal with the pain fine, but what he can\u2019t deal with his the pain his own pain is causing his empathic wife. She can literally feel what he feels, and he can\u2019t stand to let her go through all that pain, so the deal was that she would live on Earth until he recovered enough from the trauma. He wouldn\u2019t be alone. He had Tavin, and he would of course have companions like he always does. He promised he would not be alone. He wouldn\u2019t let her be alone, either, of course. He found a couple on Earth, Sydney and Verity Lambert, in the year 1982. After the birth of their first son, they were unable to have any more children due to complications with the first pregnancy, but they really wanted their son to have a sibling. The Doctor helped them have another child, if it could be John. So he put John\u2019s personality into the new embryo. John was a test-tube baby, but no one knew that except his parents (and the Doctor and Anna). John\u2019s memories of his other lives were suppressed, but they still leaked out, usually in the form of dreams that he wrote down, like always.

He used the chameleon arch to become John Smith, a perfectly ordinary human being, a man with his head in the clouds perhaps a bit too much. He was a school teacher who dreamed of being a Lord of Time. His dreams were filled with fantastical, almost fairytale-like adventures with monsters and aliens and a tiny, enormous, impossible box that travels anywhere and anywhen in the universe. And she was there, in his dreams. Her face was in his dreams, even before he knew her (he had proof, too; he drew her in his Journal of Impossible Things before he met her). She made John Smith fall in love and showed the Doctor what it was like to be normal for once. They were married and the Doctor almost had a chance at an ordinary, simple, beautiful life. But they found him, and John Smith had to wake up from his dream of an ordinary life and become the Doctor again. He left her behind, because she was just a fairytale. He didn\u2019t know he would meet her again.</p><p><b>John II</b> \u2013 <i>Fobwatched Twelfth Doctor \u2013 Peter Capaldi \u2013 #Journal-of-Impossible-Things-Volume-II / #The-Newest-Time-Lord \u2013 Doctor Who, Time Traveler\u2019s Wife Whoniverse</i></p><p>Anna finds out she is pregnant, and Anna and the Doctor decide it is best to use the chameleon arch to turn him back into John Smith, and settle down on Earth until the baby is old enough for it to be safe for them to travel together. They live in the 21st century, which takes some getting used to for John, since he was from 1913, but he adjusts quickly. He gets a job as a schoolteacher again and continues to write his dreams down in his updated version of the Journal of Impossible Things, only this time knowing it is all real. Anna secretly works for UNIT to do her best to keep trouble away from the Doctor and the baby while the Doctor is human and the baby is young, trying to give them as normal a life as possible. Except for Him, of course. Their sentient ex-war machine \u201cLiving Construct\u201d companion who has basically taken on the role of nanny while they\u2019re grounded on Earth. That part is still a little unusual. Also that the Doctor still talks to his son through his watch, and sometimes the Doctor\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger (from another life), literally, shows up.</p><p><b>John III</b> \u2013 <i>Human John \u2013 Eddie Redmayne \u2013 #Journal-of-Impossible-Things-Volume-III / #A-Life-Of-His-Own \u2013 Doctor Who, Time Traveler\u2019s Wife Whoniverse</i></p><p>After the Doctor gets stuck in the confession dial for four and a half billion years, he has a lot of emotional issues to sort out. He can deal with the pain fine, but what he can\u2019t deal with his the pain his own pain is causing his empathic wife. She can literally feel what he feels, and he can\u2019t stand to let her go through all that pain, so the deal was that she would live on Earth until he recovered enough from the trauma. He wouldn\u2019t be alone. He had Tavin, and he would of course have companions like he always does. He promised he would not be alone. He wouldn\u2019t let her be alone, either, of course. He found a couple on Earth, Sydney and Verity Lambert, in the year 1982. After the birth of their first son, they were unable to have any more children due to complications with the first pregnancy, but they really wanted their son to have a sibling. The Doctor helped them have another child, if it could be John. So he put John\u2019s personality into the new embryo. John was a test-tube baby, but no one knew that except his parents (and the Doctor and Anna). John\u2019s memories of his other lives were suppressed, but they still leaked out, usually in the form of dreams that he wrote down, like always. When he was in his twenties, he was a school teacher as a History teacher at the same school that Anna works at. They started dating, and not long after that Anna helped John\u2019s suppressed memories come to the surface. They got married and had five children together and adopted a sixth, Terra Verity, their identical twins Aiden Daniel and Calder Sydney and their adopted Zygon triplet Pete Basil, Martha Skye, and Sarah Jane II.</p><p><b>John IV</b> \u2013 <i>TARDIS Matrix Ghost \u2013 Eddie Redmayne / Peter Capaldi / David Tennant \u2013 #Journal-of-Impossible-Things-Volume-IV / #In-the-Matrix \u2013 Doctor Who, Time Traveler\u2019s Wife Whoniverse</i></p><p>Anna died of old age after the human John died, and Anna was reborn as a man, going by the name of Sean.

He used the chameleon arch to become John Smith, a perfectly ordinary human being, a man with his head in the clouds perhaps a bit too much. He was a school teacher who dreamed of being a Lord of Time. His dreams were filled with fantastical, almost fairytale-like adventures with monsters and aliens and a tiny, enormous, impossible box that travels anywhere and anywhen in the universe. And she was there, in his dreams. Her face was in his dreams, even before he knew her (he had proof, too; he drew her in his Journal of Impossible Things before he met her). She made John Smith fall in love and showed the Doctor what it was like to be normal for once. They were married and the Doctor almost had a chance at an ordinary, simple, beautiful life. But they found him, and John Smith had to wake up from his dream of an ordinary life and become the Doctor again. He left her behind, because she was just a fairytale.

They were 22-32 during the Enterprise NX-01\u2019s mission (Star Trek: Enterprise). Their host at the time was Tenn, who was 35-45 at the time.</i></b></p><p>Jon was the only offspring of the Don symbiont. Their parent symbiont has had a total of five hosts, two of whom had spouses. Mina Don, the first host, had a husband who was an unjoined Trill named Nathan, and they had a son named Quin, who is Jon\u2019s brother. After Mina was Jasper, who had a wife named Alison, and they had a daughter, Jon\u2019s sister, named Hailey. After that, there was Carrie, Clara and Yasmin.</p><p>Jon so far has had a total of eight hosts, as well as being briefly joined to a wolf, later named Eyolf, between his second and third hosts, and his sixth host was briefly merged with that same wolf due to a transporter malfunction. His hosts were Tenn, Beyrd, Eyolf (the wolf), Smyth, Frazyr, Sylvest, Kara, Karolf (Kara and Eyolf transporter malfunction), Myrln, and Jonas.</p><p>The Jon symbiont had only one biological offspring, named Blume, who was later joined to the son of one of Jon\u2019s hosts with his wife, Anna. The symbionts Bae and Nel were also joined to sons of Anna and Jon\u2019s hosts. The only symbiont to have had hosts before Anna and Jon\u2019s sons was Bae, who had two hosts, one was a female named Erosa and the other was a male named Coop, before being joined to the son of Anna and Beyrd Jon, Tavin. Bae&rsquo;s host after Tavin was named Wilbur. Anna had nine (so far) biological children with various hosts of Jon, and has adopted ten children with him in addition to that, as well as of course Jon\u2019s own biological offspring who was joined to one of their sons, and the two unrelated symbionts also joined to their sons, and their subsequent hosts. Kara Jon also had a daughter with a version of Anna from an alternate reality (referred to as Sean or \u201cSean II\u201d), named Rosalyn. More details about the children of Jon\u2019s hosts will be found below.</p><p>Anna Winden was married to the symbiont, and by extension, all of Jon\u2019s hosts, despite the taboo against reassociation that could get Jon exiled and not allowed to have any more hosts. They kept it a secret from the Symbiosis Commission and other Trill until the law was repealed during the time of Jon\u2019s sixth host, Kara. Anna is a Fae, an alien seemingly native to Earth despite the knowledge of the species being mostly obscured to humans, the dominant species of the planet. The Fae are an intelligent, sentient race, and seem to be highly advanced, though they like to keep hidden. Anna was originally a human who got turned into a fae. She has only met one other fae, her late husband named Finn, who was the one who turned her into a fae by accident. He was supposedly born as a fae, as far as Anna knows.</p><p><b>Tenn Jon</b> \u2013 <i>#Jon-I \u2013 David Tennant \u2013 Star Trek: Enterprise, Trekverse</i></p><p><b><i>Tenn Antinem was born on the planet Trill in 2116, and was 35 during the time of Enterprise NX-01\u2019s mission (Star Trek: Enterprise). He was joined to Jon in the 2144 at the age of 28, and was the first host of the Jon symbiont.</i></b></p><p>He was born to Basil and Idris Antinem. He became a history teacher before being joined to the symbiont Jon. After Tenn was joined, he met and married Anna Winden. They had three children together, two daughters named Diana and Connor, and a son named Lowell. They are half Trill and half Fae. Tenn Jon continued to be a history teacher after being joined. Tenn died in the year 2224 at the age of 108. He was joined to Jon for 80 years. Before his death (of old-age), he and Anna got to meet Beyrd, who would be selected as Jon\u2019s new host.</p><p><b>Beyrd Jon</b> \u2013 <i>#Jon-II \u2013 Peter Capaldi \u2013 Star Trek, Trekverse</i></p><p><b><i>Beyrd Cae was born on the planet Trill in the year 2184. He is joined to Jon in 2224 at the age of 40, which is fairly old for a host to be first joined.</i></b></p><p>His parents were Gerald and Nancy Cae. Beyrd is a Trill musician and got a Doctorate in Music before being joined. Just before he was joined to Jon, he met the previous host, Tenn, and Jon\u2019s wife, Anna, who wanted to continue to be married to Jon. Beyrd and Anna went on one date before he was joined to Jon. After he was joined with the Jon symbiont, he and Anna got married. They kept it a secret from the Symbiosis Commission and other Trills because of the taboo against reassociation that could result in him being exiled and the Jon symbiont no longer allowed to have any hosts after him. He and Anna had a son named Tavin. Tavin was half Trill and half Fae. Tavin was joined to the Bae symbiont, who previously had two other hosts, the first one was Erosa and the second was Coop.</p><p>Beyrd and Anna crash-landed on a planet called Symarill in the year 2254, when Beyrd was 70. Beyrd was severely injured and there was no chance of him recovering. He couldn\u2019t stay alive long enough for them to be rescued, but the symbiont was unharmed inside of him. Of course, if Beyrd dies and Jon doesn\u2019t get a new host, Jon would die with him, but Beyrd and Anna were the only two on the planet and she couldn\u2019t perform the operation on herself. There was an injured wolf nearby, and Anna helped heal the injured wolf and he agreed to host Jon, which kept Jon alive long enough for them to be rescued.</p><p><b>Eyolf</b> \u2013 <i>#Wolf-Jon \u2013 A wolf \u2013 Star Trek: Discovery, Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Animated Series, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Generations, Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek: Insurrection, Star Trek: Nemesis, Trekverse</i></p><p><b><i>The First of the Sentient Symarillion Wolves was born on the planet Symarill in the year 2250, and briefly joined to Jon in the year 2254. He is alive and with Anna and Jon for hundreds of years (throughout DISC, TOS/TAS, TNG/DS9/VOY).</i></b></p><p>The wolf didn\u2019t have a name before he met Anna and Jon after they crash-landed on his home planet of Symarill. He was four years old when he met them. When he first met Anna, he was injured by the same meteors that made Jon and Anna\u2019s ship crash, and it killed most of his pack. His parents, the pack alpha male and female, and his brother, were killed. He and his sister survived, but he didn\u2019t know that at first. Anna found the wolf and she helped heal his injured leg and with his permission, he took on the Jon symbiont temporarily after Beyrd\u2019s death, until they were able to be rescued. He was able to keep Jon alive long enough for the rescue ship to get there, and they were able to get Jon into his next host, Smyth, in enough time that it did not kill the wolf.</p><p>He was changed by the experience, though, smarter and completely loyal to Anna and Jon. He stayed with them, and they gave him the name Eyolf, which meant \u201cLucky Wolf.\u201d He\u2019s a very important part of their family. He helped them raise their children Aiden, Calder and adopted Changeling son Pete. He also had a family of his own with a female wolf from Symarill named Patience. They had five puppies together, three sons named Alfred, Albert, and David, and two daughters named Esme and Georgia. Anna and Jon helped them raise them, as well as his sister, her mate, and their children, who they discovered had survived the falling meteors when Anna, Eyolf and Smyth Jon first returned to the planet. Their children, their children\u2019s mates, Eyolf\u2019s sister and her mate\u2019s children, and the family\u2019s descendants are who go on to create an entire species of sentient wolves on Symarill who later become warp-capable and join the Federation. Anna, Jon and Eyolf still visit the planet often.</p><p>Anna, Smyth Jon, and Eyolf met versions of themselves from another reality. At the time it was the Doctor (The Twelfth Doctor) and Anna (fobwatched!Patience II). When Eyolf\u2019s wolf body dies, they go back to that universe, where they meet the Twelfth Doctor again, as well as Sean I (Patience III), and HoloJohn (formerly fobwatched!Doctor\u2019s personality that is really an alternate version of Jon, in this case taking the form of their current host, Smyth. He had a human body but his body died and they saved his consciousness inside of the TARDIS, their living ship, and she\u2019s projecting him as a hologram. Twelve and John are both married to Anna, or Patience, who in this case is actually Sean), as well as Bill and Nardole, the Doctor\u2019s companions at the time. Nardole has at least some robotic parts and John is a hologram, and the Doctor has been thinking about how to transfer John\u2019s consciousness from inside the TARDIS to a robotic body, and he agrees to help them save Eyolf by trying the procedure on him first, and they successfully transferred Eyolf\u2019s consciousness from his dying wolf body into a robotic wolf body. Eyolf stays with Anna and Jon for hundreds of years after that in his robotic wolf form.</p><p>Eyolf and Jon\u2019s sixth host, Kara, were accidentally merged into one being, called Karolf, in a transporter accident and had to stay like that for several months before they were able to figure out how to reverse it.</p><p><b>Smyth Jon</b> \u2013 <i>#Jon-III \u2013 Eddie Redmayne \u2013 Star Trek: Discovery, Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Animated Series, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Trekverse / Star Trek: Remake Film, Star Trek: Into Darkness, Star Trek: Beyond, the Kelvin Timeline</i></p><p><b><i>Smyth Artemis was born on the planet Trill in the year 2229 and he was joined to the Jon symbiont in the year 2254 at the age of 25. He was 27 during the Discovery\u2019s mission (Star Trek: Discovery), 37-42 during the Enterprise NCC-1701\u2019s five year mission (Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Animated Series) and is 44-64 during Enterprise NCC-1701\u2019s additional adventures and Enterprise NCC-1701-A\u2019s mission (Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country).</i></b></p><p><b><i>Smyth was 29-34 during the Enterprise NCC-1701\u2019s missions in the Kelvin Timeline (Star Trek, Star Trek: Into Darkness, Star Trek: Beyond)</i></b></p><p>His parents were Sydney and Verity Artemis. Due to the sudden death of Beyrd, Jon and Anna were unable to meet Smyth before the joining, but he adapted well anyway. After he was joined with the Jon symbiont, he and Anna also got married in private and they had two children together, identical twin sons named Aidan and Calder, and they adopted a third son, a changeling named Pete. Smyth is an astrozoologist with experience in stellar cartography, as well, and was on the Enterprise 1701 briefly in stellar cartography and in exobiology. He was a lieutenant in Starfleet at the time, and got as far as commander in his lifetime, but never wanted to be the captain of a Federation Starship, only his own small private one he has with his wife that is not much larger than a shuttlepod. Smyth Jon met Frazyr Hines, who would become Jon&rsquo;s next host, briefly before he died from an illness due to old age in the year 2349.</p><p><i>In my game on Star Trek Online, John Smith went to the academy with Chekov, and he becomes captain of the USS Ambrosius.</i></p><p><b>Frazyr Jon</b> \u2013 <i>#Jon-IV \u2013 Hadley Fraser \u2013 Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Generations, Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek: Insurrection, Star Trek: Nemesis, Trekverse</i></p><p><b><i>Frazyr Hines was born on the planet Trill in the year 2322 and he was joined to the Jon symbiont in the year 2349 at the age of 27. Although he was a citizen of the 24th century, Frazyr was recruited by time travelers from the 31st century to be a Temporal Agent, enforcing the Temporal Accord and preserving the timeline from those who seek to change it, during the Temporal Cold War. He was given a 31st century timeship made to look like a small personal ship from the 24th century, his home timezone, and given a job working for the 24th century Federation&rsquo;s Department of Temporal Investigations.</i></b></p><p>During Enterprise NCC-1701-C, Enterprise NCC-1701-D, and Enterprise NCC-1701-E\u2019s missions (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Generations, Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek: Insurrection and Star Trek: Nemesis), during the investigation of the Wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant and the war with the Dominion (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine), and during the time the Starship Voyager was lost in the Delta Quadrant (Star Trek: Voyager), Frazyr would\u2019ve been 42-57, but he was traveling throughout different time periods, so that time is a bit fuzzy and he was not there through all of it.</p><p>Frazyr and Anna traveled to many different points in time and space during this time.

The eggs hatch and they raise their four beautiful beebies together. Eventually the beebies are reunited with the rest of the hivemind and teach them to only implant their eggs in people when they have their permission, and Kara and Anna take them to Symarill where the wolves gladly agree to host the eggs of the bee hivemind.

He has no idea how he got there or if he was alive before the child&rsquo;s birth. Perhaps he was created with him. All his life Smyth would be visited by what he was told was an imaginary friend, but felt more like a part of himself. Sometimes his friend would be gone for weeks at a time, and only ever stayed one day before disappearing again, and come back at random intervals, but he would always come back to him. Smyth always knew he was real. Jon told him that when he was gone from Smyth, he would share someone else&rsquo;s mind, but it would always be a random person, he hopped from mind to mind every night, and it was never like how it was with Smyth. He would always either have no control at all over the body he was inhabiting, being only an observer in the back of someone&rsquo;s mind, or he would have too much control, where he couldn&rsquo;t contact the body&rsquo;s original inhabitant at all, and they would have no memory of the day he was there when he left. He discovered this when he hopped into the body of people who knew each other back to back. During the times he had total control, he had no idea what to do. He would do his best to blend in, do what they would&rsquo;ve done and not mess anything in their life up. It was never like that with Smyth. They had equal control and total communication when they were together. When Smyth was a teenager, they started experimenting with it, and the Jon Entity began to be able to control whose mind he hops into. Once Smyth and Jon were sure Jon could control who he hops into, they went to the Academy. When they were accepted in, they got a doctor from the Planetary Union (or Starfleet, or whatever) to examine Smyth while Jon was there and actually detect him. It wasn&rsquo;t an imaginary friend, or schizophrenia, or dissociative identity disorder, as he was sometimes told when he was younger, it was an energy lifeform cohabitating inside his neural pathways, sharing his mind and control of his body in a symbiotic relationship. The Planetary Union (or the Federation or whatever) has never come in contact with Jon&rsquo;s species before. They request special permission to find nine other people willing to work with Jon as stable hosts, as they found that ten hosts was the smallest amount possible for Jon to be able to consistently hop into without problems. The ten hosts, and of course Jon, all became very close, almost like family, and once they all graduated they were all assigned to the same ship so that Jon wouldn&rsquo;t have to find new hosts. Sometimes Jon hops into Smyth&rsquo;s dog Eyolf.</i></p>",

After Mina was Jasper, who had a wife named Alison, and they had a daughter, Jon\u2019s sister, named Hailey. After that, there was Carrie, Clara and Yasmin.</p><p>Jon so far has had a total of eight hosts, as well as being briefly joined to a wolf, later named Eyolf, between his second and third hosts, and his sixth host was briefly merged with that same wolf due to a transporter malfunction. His hosts were Tenn, Beyrd, Eyolf (the wolf), Smyth, Frazyr, Sylvest, Kara, Karolf (Kara and Eyolf transporter malfunction), Myrln, and Jonas.</p><p>The Jon symbiont had only one biological offspring, named Blume, who was later joined to the son of one of Jon\u2019s hosts with his wife, Anna. The symbionts Bae and Nel were also joined to sons of Anna and Jon\u2019s hosts. The only symbiont to have had hosts before Anna and Jon\u2019s sons was Bae, who had two hosts, one was a female named Erosa and the other was a male named Coop, before being joined to the son of Anna and Beyrd Jon, Tavin. Bae\u2019s host after Tavin was named Wilbur. Anna had nine (so far) biological children with various hosts of Jon, and has adopted ten children with him in addition to that, as well as of course Jon\u2019s own biological offspring who was joined to one of their sons, and the two unrelated symbionts also joined to their sons, and their subsequent hosts. Kara Jon also had a daughter with a version of Anna from an alternate reality (referred to as Sean or \u201cSean II\u201d), named Rosalyn. More details about the children of Jon\u2019s hosts will be found below.</p><p>Anna Winden was married to the symbiont, and by extension, all of Jon\u2019s hosts, despite the taboo against reassociation that could get Jon exiled and not allowed to have any more hosts. They kept it a secret from the Symbiosis Commission and other Trill until the law was repealed during the time of Jon\u2019s sixth host, Kara. Anna is a Fae, an alien seemingly native to Earth despite the knowledge of the species being mostly obscured to humans, the dominant species of the planet. The Fae are an intelligent, sentient race, and seem to be highly advanced, though they like to keep hidden. Anna was originally a human who got turned into a fae. She has only met one other fae, her late husband named Finn, who was the one who turned her into a fae by accident.

His parents, the pack alpha male and female, and his brother, were killed. He and his sister survived, but he didn\u2019t know that at first. Anna found the wolf and she helped heal his injured leg and with his permission, he took on the Jon symbiont temporarily after Beyrd\u2019s death, until they were able to be rescued. He was able to keep Jon alive long enough for the rescue ship to get there, and they were able to get Jon into his next host, Smyth, in enough time that it did not kill the wolf.</p><p>He was changed by the experience, though, smarter and completely loyal to Anna and Jon. He stayed with them, and they gave him the name Eyolf, which meant \u201cLucky Wolf.\u201d He\u2019s a very important part of their family. He helped them raise their children Aiden, Calder and adopted Changeling son Pete. He also had a family of his own with a female wolf from Symarill named Patience. They had five puppies together, three sons named Alfred, Albert, and David, and two daughters named Esme and Georgia. Anna and Jon helped them raise them, as well as his sister, her mate, and their children, who they discovered had survived the falling meteors when Anna, Eyolf and Smyth Jon first returned to the planet. Their children, their children\u2019s mates, Eyolf\u2019s sister and her mate\u2019s children, and the family\u2019s descendants are who go on to create an entire species of sentient wolves on Symarill who later become warp-capable and join the Federation.

Many of the wolves on Symarill have continued Sylvest\u2019s work with parasites and other symbiotic lifeforms.</p><p><b>Kara Jon</b> \u2013 <i>#Jon-VI \u2013 Melissa Benoist \u2013 Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Generations, Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek: Insurrection, Star Trek: Nemesis, Trek-verse</i></p><p><b><i>Kara Sanders was born on the planet Trill in the year 2341.

She has a sister named Alex and a cousin named Clark who she is close with. She\u2019s always known what she wanted. She wanted to work for Starfleet and to become a Joined Trill. She starts preparing herself right away and spends her childhood getting herself ready for Starfleet Academy and the Symbiosis Commission. She always gets top grades in school, and she goes through the Academy to become a Starfleet engineer serving aboard starships and exploring strange new worlds.</i></p><p><i>In the year 2365 during the second season of TNG, Kara successfully goes through the Symbiosis Commission\u2019s screening process and is chosen to be Jon\u2019s sixth host.

Sylvest dies at the age of 70, and Jon is joined with Kara, their sixth host, at the age of 24, the youngest host to have ever been joined to Jon.</i></p><p><i>Kara and Anna get married in secret, of course. At some point, I\u2019m not exactly sure on the details of where in her timeline it is, a bee-like alien who is a part of a hivemind implants its eggs into Kara. They know nothing about what kind of alien it is apart from what little they can tell from their scans. Kara and Anna decide to see it through and host the eggs and care for the babies, especially if the parent or parents never come back. There are four eggs. Their ship\u2019s doctor said if there are any signs that the babies will severely harm or kill Kara at any point they can always take the eggs out and hope (or not hope) they can survive without her, but they never need to. The eggs hatch and they raise their four beautiful beebies together. Eventually the beebies are reunited with the rest of the hivemind and teach them to only implant their eggs in people when they have their permission, and Kara and Anna take them to Symarill where the wolves gladly agree to host the eggs of the bee hivemind. Kara and Anna visit Symarill a lot. Kara probably borrows Frazyr\u2019s time machine more than once when he is in their time period. Since she was him, she\u2019ll remember when and where to go. She always returns it.</i></p><p><i>Also at some point, Anna and Kara visit their other selves from the Doctor Whoniverse, and Kara and Sean II (Patience VI) have a baby together named Rosalyn, who switches off between realities and is raised by Kara Jon and Jon\u2019s Anna, John IV, Sean II and the Eighteenth Doctor. Anna and Kara also probably have babies where they are pregnant together at some point, and probably not but Jon\u2019s Anna might also at some point have John IV and/or Eighteen\u2019s baby/babies.</i></p><p><i>During Voyager seasons 6-7, a transporter malfunction combines Kara and Eyolf into one person, Karolf, for several months.

He has no idea how he got there or if he was alive before the child\u2019s birth. Perhaps he was created with him. All his life Smyth would be visited by what he was told was an imaginary friend, but felt more like a part of himself. Sometimes his friend would be gone for weeks at a time, and only ever stayed one day before disappearing again, and come back at random intervals, but he would always come back to him. Smyth always knew he was real. Jon told him that when he was gone from Smyth, he would share someone else\u2019s mind, but it would always be a random person, he hopped from mind to mind every night, and it was never like how it was with Smyth. He would always either have no control at all over the body he was inhabiting, being only an observer in the back of someone\u2019s mind, or he would have too much control, where he couldn\u2019t contact the body\u2019s original inhabitant at all, and they would have no memory of the day he was there when he left. He discovered this when he hopped into the body of people who knew each other back to back. During the times he had total control, he had no idea what to do. He would do his best to blend in, do what they would\u2019ve done and not mess anything in their life up. It was never like that with Smyth. They had equal control and total communication when they were together. When Smyth was a teenager, they started experimenting with it, and the Jon Entity began to be able to control whose mind he hops into. Once Smyth and Jon were sure Jon could control who he hops into, they went to the Academy. When they were accepted in, they got a doctor from the Planetary Union (or Starfleet, or whatever) to examine Smyth while Jon was there and actually detect him. It wasn\u2019t an imaginary friend, or schizophrenia, or dissociative identity disorder, as he was sometimes told when he was younger, it was an energy lifeform cohabitating inside his neural pathways, sharing his mind and control of his body in a symbiotic relationship. The Planetary Union (or the Federation or whatever) has never come in contact with Jon\u2019s species before. They request special permission to find nine other people willing to work with Jon as stable hosts, as they found that ten hosts was the smallest amount possible for Jon to be able to consistently hop into without problems. The ten hosts, and of course Jon, all became very close, almost like family, and once they all graduated they were all assigned to the same ship so that Jon wouldn\u2019t have to find new hosts. Sometimes Jon hops into Smyth\u2019s dog Eyolf.</i></p></p>",

They were 22-32 during the Enterprise NX-01\u2019s mission (Star Trek: Enterprise). Their host at the time was Tenn, who was 35-45 at the time.</i></b></p><p>Jon was the only offspring of the Don symbiont. Their parent symbiont has had a total of five hosts, two of whom had spouses. Mina Don, the first host, had a husband who was an unjoined Trill named Nathan, and they had a son named Quin, who is Jon\u2019s brother. After Mina was Jasper, who had a wife named Alison, and they had a daughter, Jon\u2019s sister, named Hailey. After that, there was Carrie, Clara and Yasmin.</p><p>Jon so far has had a total of eight hosts, as well as being briefly joined to a wolf, later named Eyolf, between his second and third hosts, and his sixth host was briefly merged with that same wolf due to a transporter malfunction. His hosts were Tenn, Beyrd, Eyolf (the wolf), Smyth, Frazyr, Sylvest, Kara, Karolf (Kara and Eyolf transporter malfunction), Myrln, and Jonas.</p><p>The Jon symbiont had only one biological offspring, named Blume, who was later joined to the son of one of Jon\u2019s hosts with his wife, Anna. The symbionts Bae and Nel were also joined to sons of Anna and Jon\u2019s hosts. The only symbiont to have had hosts before Anna and Jon\u2019s sons was Bae, who had two hosts, one was a female named Erosa and the other was a male named Coop, before being joined to the son of Anna and Beyrd Jon, Tavin. Bae\u2019s host after Tavin was named Wilbur. Anna had nine (so far) biological children with various hosts of Jon, and has adopted ten children with him in addition to that, as well as of course Jon\u2019s own biological offspring who was joined to one of their sons, and the two unrelated symbionts also joined to their sons, and their subsequent hosts. Kara Jon also had a daughter with a version of Anna from an alternate reality (referred to as Sean or \u201cSean II\u201d), named Rosalyn. More details about the children of Jon\u2019s hosts will be found below.</p><p>Anna Winden was married to the symbiont, and by extension, all of Jon\u2019s hosts, despite the taboo against reassociation that could get Jon exiled and not allowed to have any more hosts. They kept it a secret from the Symbiosis Commission and other Trill until the law was repealed during the time of Jon\u2019s sixth host, Kara. Anna is a Fae, an alien seemingly native to Earth despite the knowledge of the species being mostly obscured to humans, the dominant species of the planet. The Fae are an intelligent, sentient race, and seem to be highly advanced, though they like to keep hidden. Anna was originally a human who got turned into a fae. She has only met one other fae, her late husband named Finn, who was the one who turned her into a fae by accident. He was supposedly born as a fae, as far as Anna knows.</p><p><b>Tenn Jon</b> \u2013 <i>#Jon-I \u2013 David Tennant \u2013 Star Trek: Enterprise, Trekverse</i></p><p><b><i>Tenn Antinem was born on the planet Trill in 2116, and was 35 during the time of Enterprise NX-01\u2019s mission (Star Trek: Enterprise). He was joined to Jon in the 2144 at the age of 28, and was the first host of the Jon symbiont.</i></b></p><p>He was born to Basil and Idris Antinem. He became a history teacher before being joined to the symbiont Jon. After Tenn was joined, he met and married Anna Winden. They had three children together, two daughters named Diana and Connor, and a son named Lowell. They are half Trill and half Fae. Tenn Jon continued to be a history teacher after being joined. Tenn died in the year 2224 at the age of 108. He was joined to Jon for 80 years. Before his death (of old-age), he and Anna got to meet Beyrd, who would be selected as Jon\u2019s new host.</p><p><b>Beyrd Jon</b> \u2013 <i>#Jon-II \u2013 Peter Capaldi \u2013 Star Trek, Trekverse</i></p><p><b><i>Beyrd Cae was born on the planet Trill in the year 2184. He is joined to Jon in 2224 at the age of 40, which is fairly old for a host to be first joined.</i></b></p><p>His parents were Gerald and Nancy Cae. Beyrd is a Trill musician and got a Doctorate in Music before being joined. Just before he was joined to Jon, he met the previous host, Tenn, and Jon\u2019s wife, Anna, who wanted to continue to be married to Jon. Beyrd and Anna went on one date before he was joined to Jon. After he was joined with the Jon symbiont, he and Anna got married. They kept it a secret from the Symbiosis Commission and other Trills because of the taboo against reassociation that could result in him being exiled and the Jon symbiont no longer allowed to have any hosts after him. He and Anna had a son named Tavin. Tavin was half Trill and half Fae. Tavin was joined to the Bae symbiont, who previously had two other hosts, the first one was Erosa and the second was Coop.</p><p>Beyrd and Anna crash-landed on a planet called Symarill in the year 2254, when Beyrd was 70. Beyrd was severely injured and there was no chance of him recovering. He couldn\u2019t stay alive long enough for them to be rescued, but the symbiont was unharmed inside of him. Of course, if Beyrd dies and Jon doesn\u2019t get a new host, Jon would die with him, but Beyrd and Anna were the only two on the planet and she couldn\u2019t perform the operation on herself. There was an injured wolf nearby, and Anna helped heal the injured wolf and he agreed to host Jon, which kept Jon alive long enough for them to be rescued.</p><p><b>Eyolf</b> \u2013 <i>#Wolf-Jon \u2013 A wolf \u2013 Star Trek: Discovery, Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Animated Series, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Generations, Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek: Insurrection, Star Trek: Nemesis, Trekverse</i></p><p><b><i>The First of the Sentient Symarillion Wolves was born on the planet Symarill in the year 2250, and briefly joined to Jon in the year 2254.

He was four years old when he met them. When he first met Anna, he was injured by the same meteors that made Jon and Anna\u2019s ship crash, and it killed most of his pack. His parents, the pack alpha male and female, and his brother, were killed. He and his sister survived, but he didn\u2019t know that at first. Anna found the wolf and she helped heal his injured leg and with his permission, he took on the Jon symbiont temporarily after Beyrd\u2019s death, until they were able to be rescued. He was able to keep Jon alive long enough for the rescue ship to get there, and they were able to get Jon into his next host, Smyth, in enough time that it did not kill the wolf.</p><p>He was changed by the experience, though, smarter and completely loyal to Anna and Jon. He stayed with them, and they gave him the name Eyolf, which meant \u201cLucky Wolf.\u201d He\u2019s a very important part of their family. He helped them raise their children Aiden, Calder and adopted Changeling son Pete. He also had a family of his own with a female wolf from Symarill named Patience. They had five puppies together, three sons named Alfred, Albert, and David, and two daughters named Esme and Georgia. Anna and Jon helped them raise them, as well as his sister, her mate, and their children, who they discovered had survived the falling meteors when Anna, Eyolf and Smyth Jon first returned to the planet. Their children, their children\u2019s mates, Eyolf\u2019s sister and her mate\u2019s children, and the family\u2019s descendants are who go on to create an entire species of sentient wolves on Symarill who later become warp-capable and join the Federation. Anna, Jon and Eyolf still visit the planet often.</p><p>Anna, Smyth Jon, and Eyolf met versions of themselves from another reality. At the time it was the Doctor (The Twelfth Doctor) and Anna (fobwatched!Patience II). When Eyolf\u2019s wolf body dies, they go back to that universe, where they meet the Twelfth Doctor again, as well as Sean I (Patience III), and HoloJohn (formerly fobwatched!Doctor\u2019s personality that is really an alternate version of Jon, in this case taking the form of their current host, Smyth. He had a human body but his body died and they saved his consciousness inside of the TARDIS, their living ship, and she\u2019s projecting him as a hologram. Twelve and John are both married to Anna, or Patience, who in this case is actually Sean), as well as Bill and Nardole, the Doctor\u2019s companions at the time. Nardole has at least some robotic parts and John is a hologram, and the Doctor has been thinking about how to transfer John\u2019s consciousness from inside the TARDIS to a robotic body, and he agrees to help them save Eyolf by trying the procedure on him first, and they successfully transferred Eyolf\u2019s consciousness from his dying wolf body into a robotic wolf body. Eyolf stays with Anna and Jon for hundreds of years after that in his robotic wolf form.</p><p>Eyolf and Jon\u2019s sixth host, Kara, were accidentally merged into one being, called Karolf, in a transporter accident and had to stay like that for several months before they were able to figure out how to reverse it.</p><p><b>Smyth Jon</b> \u2013 <i>#Jon-III \u2013 Eddie Redmayne \u2013 Star Trek: Discovery, Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Animated Series, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Trekverse / Star Trek: Remake Film, Star Trek: Into Darkness, Star Trek: Beyond, the Kelvin Timeline</i></p><p><b><i>Smyth Artemis was born on the planet Trill in the year 2229 and he was joined to the Jon symbiont in the year 2254 at the age of 25.

Smyth is an astrozoologist with experience in stellar cartography, as well, and was on the Enterprise 1701 briefly in stellar cartography and in exobiology. He was a lieutenant in Starfleet at the time, and got as far as commander in his lifetime, but never wanted to be the captain of a Federation Starship, only his own small private one he has with his wife that is not much larger than a shuttlepod.

He has no idea how he got there or if he was alive before the child\u2019s birth. Perhaps he was created with him. All his life Smyth would be visited by what he was told was an imaginary friend, but felt more like a part of himself. Sometimes his friend would be gone for weeks at a time, and only ever stayed one day before disappearing again, and come back at random intervals, but he would always come back to him. Smyth always knew he was real. Jon told him that when he was gone from Smyth, he would share someone else\u2019s mind, but it would always be a random person, he hopped from mind to mind every night, and it was never like how it was with Smyth. He would always either have no control at all over the body he was inhabiting, being only an observer in the back of someone\u2019s mind, or he would have too much control, where he couldn\u2019t contact the body\u2019s original inhabitant at all, and they would have no memory of the day he was there when he left. He discovered this when he hopped into the body of people who knew each other back to back. During the times he had total control, he had no idea what to do. He would do his best to blend in, do what they would\u2019ve done and not mess anything in their life up. It was never like that with Smyth. They had equal control and total communication when they were together. When Smyth was a teenager, they started experimenting with it, and the Jon Entity began to be able to control whose mind he hops into. Once Smyth and Jon were sure Jon could control who he hops into, they went to the Academy. When they were accepted in, they got a doctor from the Planetary Union (or Starfleet, or whatever) to examine Smyth while Jon was there and actually detect him. It wasn\u2019t an imaginary friend, or schizophrenia, or dissociative identity disorder, as he was sometimes told when he was younger, it was an energy lifeform cohabitating inside his neural pathways, sharing his mind and control of his body in a symbiotic relationship. The Planetary Union (or the Federation or whatever) has never come in contact with Jon\u2019s species before. They request special permission to find nine other people willing to work with Jon as stable hosts, as they found that ten hosts was the smallest amount possible for Jon to be able to consistently hop into without problems. The ten hosts, and of course Jon, all became very close, almost like family, and once they all graduated they were all assigned to the same ship so that Jon wouldn\u2019t have to find new hosts. Sometimes Jon hops into Smyth\u2019s dog Eyolf.</i></p></p>",

Bae&rsquo;s host after Tavin was named Wilbur. Anna had nine (so far) biological children with various hosts of Jon, and has adopted ten children with him in addition to that, as well as of course Jon&rsquo;s own biological offspring who was joined to one of their sons, and the two unrelated symbionts also joined to their sons, and their subsequent hosts. Kara Jon also had a daughter with a version of Anna from an alternate reality (referred to as Sean or &ldquo;Sean II&rdquo;), named Rosalyn.

Anna is a Fae, an alien seemingly native to Earth despite the knowledge of the species being mostly obscured to humans, the dominant species of the planet. The Fae are an intelligent, sentient race, and seem to be highly advanced, though they like to keep hidden. Anna was originally a human who got turned into a fae.

He stayed with them, and they gave him the name Eyolf, which meant &ldquo;Lucky Wolf.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s a very important part of their family. He helped them raise their children Aiden, Calder and adopted Changeling son Pete. He also had a family of his own with a female wolf from Symarill named Patience. They had five puppies together, three sons named Alfred, Albert, and David, and two daughters named Esme and Georgia. Anna and Jon helped them raise them, as well as his sister, her mate, and their children, who they discovered had survived the falling meteors when Anna, Eyolf and Smyth Jon first returned to the planet. Their children, their children&rsquo;s mates, Eyolf&rsquo;s sister and her mate&rsquo;s children, and the family&rsquo;s descendants are who go on to create an entire species of sentient wolves on Symarill who later become warp-capable and join the Federation. Anna, Jon and Eyolf still visit the planet often.</p><p>Anna, Smyth Jon, and Eyolf met versions of themselves from another reality.

She always gets top grades in school, and she goes through the Academy to become a Starfleet engineer serving aboard starships and exploring strange new worlds.</i></p><p><i>In the year 2365 during the second season of TNG, Kara successfully goes through the Symbiosis Commission&rsquo;s screening process and is chosen to be Jon&rsquo;s sixth host. She meets Sylvest Jon and goes on a date with Anna to get to know her future wife. Sylvest dies at the age of 70, and Jon is joined with Kara, their sixth host, at the age of 24, the youngest host to have ever been joined to Jon.</i></p><p><i>Kara and Anna get married in secret, of course. At some point, I&rsquo;m not exactly sure on the details of where in her timeline it is, a bee-like alien who is a part of a hivemind implants its eggs into Kara. They know nothing about what kind of alien it is apart from what little they can tell from their scans. Kara and Anna decide to see it through and host the eggs and care for the babies, especially if the parent or parents never come back. There are four eggs. Their ship&rsquo;s doctor said if there are any signs that the babies will severely harm or kill Kara at any point they can always take the eggs out and hope (or not hope) they can survive without her, but they never need to. The eggs hatch and they raise their four beautiful beebies together. Eventually the beebies are reunited with the rest of the hivemind and teach them to only implant their eggs in people when they have their permission, and Kara and Anna take them to Symarill where the wolves gladly agree to host the eggs of the bee hivemind. Kara and Anna visit Symarill a lot. Kara probably borrows Frazyr&rsquo;s time machine more than once when he is in their time period. Since she was him, she&rsquo;ll remember when and where to go. She always returns it.</i></p><p><i>Also at some point, Anna and Kara visit their other selves from the Doctor Whoniverse, and Kara and Sean II (Patience VI) have a baby together named Rosalyn, who switches off between realities and is raised by Kara Jon and Jon&rsquo;s Anna, John IV, Sean II and the Eighteenth Doctor. Anna and Kara also probably have babies where they are pregnant together at some point, and probably not but Jon&rsquo;s Anna might also at some point have John IV and/or Eighteen&rsquo;s baby/babies.</i></p><p><i>During Voyager seasons 6-7, a transporter malfunction combines Kara and Eyolf into one person, Karolf, for several months. When they are finally separated again, they can both still remember each other&rsquo;s memories.</i></p><p><i>Sometime after Nemesis, the law against Reassociation is repealed and Kara and Anna have a public Trill wedding with Kara&rsquo;s family to celebrate.</i></p><p><i>In the year 2441 Kara dies at the age of 101. Kara and Jon were joined for 76 years. She briefly meets Myrln, who will be Jon&rsquo;s next host, before she dies. She lived the longest any of Jon&rsquo;s hosts have lived.</i></p><p><i>In my game on Star Trek Online, Kara was an engineer and she becomes captain of the USS Kryptonius.</i></p><p><b>Myrln Jon</b> &ndash; <i>#Jon-VII &ndash; Colin Morgan &ndash; Star Trek, Trek-verse</i></p><p><i>Myrln Jeth was born on the planet Trill in the year 2416 to parents Ambrosius and Aurelia Jeth. He met Kara, Jon&rsquo;s previous host, and Jon&rsquo;s wife Anna in 2441, shortly before Kara died. He was selected to be Jon&rsquo;s next host and was joined with Jon when Kara died. Myrln was a scientist and became a Federation Ambassador. He died met Jonas Frere, who would be selected to be Jon&rsquo;s next host, in the year 2491 at the age of 75. He was joined to Jon for 50 years.</i></p><p><b>Jonas Jon</b> &ndash; <i>#Jon-VIII &ndash; Nick Jonas &ndash; Star Trek, Trek-verse</i></p><p><i>Jonas Frere was born on the planet Trill in the year 2467 to the parents Denise and Paul Frere. He met Myrln and Anna in the year 2491 at the age of 24, shortly before Myrln died and he was joined with Jon. He eventually became a captain of a Federation Starship and later a Starfleet Admiral.</i></p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p><b>Jon and Hosts in the Mirror Universe:</b></p><p><b>Noj Krad</b> &ndash; <i>#Mirror-Smyth &ndash; Eddie Redmayne &ndash; Star Trek: The Original Series, Trek Mirror Universe</i></p><p><i>Noj Krad was the Mirror Universe&rsquo;s version of Smyth Jon.</i></p><p><b>Noj Arak Krad</b> &ndash; <i>#Mirror-Kara &ndash; Melissa Benoist &ndash; Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Trek Mirror Universe</i></p><p><i>Arak Krad was the Mirror Universe&rsquo;s version of Kara Jon.</i></p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p><b>The Orville-Verse (can also be modified for other similar Sci-Fi universes, including Star Trek)</b></p><p><i>(Partially inspired by the plot of the novel and movie &lsquo;Every Day&rsquo;)</i></p><p><i>The Jon Entity has no memories before sharing the mind of a newborn baby named Smyth on the day of his birth. He has no idea how he got there or if he was alive before the child&rsquo;s birth. Perhaps he was created with him. All his life Smyth would be visited by what he was told was an imaginary friend, but felt more like a part of himself. Sometimes his friend would be gone for weeks at a time, and only ever stayed one day before disappearing again, and come back at random intervals, but he would always come back to him. Smyth always knew he was real. Jon told him that when he was gone from Smyth, he would share someone else&rsquo;s mind, but it would always be a random person, he hopped from mind to mind every night, and it was never like how it was with Smyth. He would always either have no control at all over the body he was inhabiting, being only an observer in the back of someone&rsquo;s mind, or he would have too much control, where he couldn&rsquo;t contact the body&rsquo;s original inhabitant at all, and they would have no memory of the day he was there when he left. He discovered this when he hopped into the body of people who knew each other back to back. During the times he had total control, he had no idea what to do. He would do his best to blend in, do what they would&rsquo;ve done and not mess anything in their life up. It was never like that with Smyth. They had equal control and total communication when they were together. When Smyth was a teenager, they started experimenting with it, and the Jon Entity began to be able to control whose mind he hops into. Once Smyth and Jon were sure Jon could control who he hops into, they went to the Academy. When they were accepted in, they got a doctor from the Planetary Union (or Starfleet, or whatever) to examine Smyth while Jon was there and actually detect him. It wasn&rsquo;t an imaginary friend, or schizophrenia, or dissociative identity disorder, as he was sometimes told when he was younger, it was an energy lifeform cohabitating inside his neural pathways, sharing his mind and control of his body in a symbiotic relationship. The Planetary Union (or the Federation or whatever) has never come in contact with Jon&rsquo;s species before. They request special permission to find nine other people willing to work with Jon as stable hosts, as they found that ten hosts was the smallest amount possible for Jon to be able to consistently hop into without problems. The ten hosts, and of course Jon, all became very close, almost like family, and once they all graduated they were all assigned to the same ship so that Jon wouldn&rsquo;t have to find new hosts. Sometimes Jon hops into Smyth&rsquo;s dog Eyolf.</i></p></p>",
