She feels weak down to her bones, and can feel dampness on her cheeks.She hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d been crying. The tips of Nott\u2019s - Veth\u2019s? Jester still isn\u2019t sure what she prefers - claws are shaking slightly against her arm with emotion. The sadness hasn\u2019t lessened. The <i>guilt</i> hasn\u2019t lessened.</p><!-- more --><p>She pulls away gently from the two of them. Nott lets go of her arms as she goes and stops crowding around Kiri, but simply turns around and leans into Yeza\u2019s side. He looks confused; a little worried, but places a hand tentatively on her arm and rubs it comfortingly. Jester glances back down at Kiri, who is staring at her with wide, dark eyes, head tilted to the side in curiosity. It\u2019s a mirror to Yeza\u2019s expression, a mix of confusion and worry, and Jester feels something tug in her chest at the pure innocence of it all.</p><p>For all that Kiri had experienced with the Mighty Nein, she was just a child. That was part of why they had found her a home in Hupperdook. She needed a stable place to call home, somewhere where she could live out her childhood in relative safety and come home to a warm bed and a meal everyday. Jester had those things not too many years ago. She knows Fjord hadn\u2019t, and she also knows that Fjord\u2019s covered in scars, physical and otherwise. Kiri deserved safety, deserved to be sheltered from the harsher world until she was old enough to handle it. Jester had taught her how to tell people off, to get them to leave her alone. Fjord had handed her a dagger. They\u2019d done their best in the interim, but Hupperdook had been the long-term solution. And yet, here she is, only a few months later, coming back to shatter that safety, that shelter from the horrors of Wildmount.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kiri\u2026\u201d Jester sighs. She sniffles, and wipes the back of her hand across her tear-stained face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kiri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kiri repeats back. The feathers along her neck ruffle up and she shifts back a little, looking guilty. It\u2019s an expression that twists in Jester\u2019s gut.</p><p>\u201cOh no Kiri! You didn\u2019t do anything wrong!\u201d Jester reassures her, scooting forward on her knees to cup the side of Kiri\u2019s face, the feather soft under her fingers, \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Kiri chirps, still in Jester\u2019s voice. She blinks slowly up at Jester. Expectantly. Still confused.</p><p>It\u2019s too hard to say. The words get caught in her throat every time, guilt choking them down. She should have been there. She should have been there, she should have fought harder against the Shepherds, she should have bought a diamond the moment she realized she needed one while they were still in Zadash. All the power of the Traveller coursing through her veins, and all she could do was tuck a single card into the soil. Molly had been her partner in crime, her <i>brother</i>, and she hadn\u2019t been there when he - when all of the Nein - needed her most.</p><p>Something must be showing on her face as she stares down at Kiri, because the girl thrills softly, gently, like she\u2019s approaching a small, timid animal. The feathers on the top of her head brush against Jester\u2019s chin as she leans in, and Jester feels small wings rise up past her sides, small clawed fingers at the end clutching at the back of her cloak.\u201cOkay. Okay,\u201d Kiri trills, and Jester feels a sob wrench its way out of her chest.</p><p>Her hands reach up, wrapping into the back of Kiri\u2019s tiny tunic. She doesn\u2019t wail, or sob, not after the first one. Because Kiri is a child, and Jester is an adult, and she needs to be strong. She is strong. She can do it. Kiri needs to know what happened and Jester is strong.</p><p>\u201cI will be okay, Kiri,\u201d Jester murmurs, separating them again. <i>Look at her. She needs you to be strong for her. Let her see you.</i> \u201cBut something very, very sad happened.\u201d</p><p>Kiri\u2019s eyes, wide as saucers already, widen even further. She opens her beak and low growling noise comes out, and it takes Jester a second to place it as the growls of the crocodile-creatures in the swamp, the ones they had rescued her from.</p><p>\u201cWorse than that,\u201d Jester says weakly, and clasps Kiri\u2019s small talon in her own hand. It\u2019s trembling. \u201cWe went somewhere dangerous after we said goodbye to you and your little family and - and something very bad happened.\u201d She takes a deep, deep breath, and out of the corner of her eye she can see Nott\u2019s head turn back towards them. Her golden eyes are swollen and puffy, darker green around the edges. She detaches from Yeza, placing a hand on Jester\u2019s shoulder. It helps just enough to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cMolly didn\u2019t make it back.\u201d</p><p>Her voice cracks at the end and her vision immediately goes blurry as more tears force their way out. Nott\u2019s hand tightens, and Kiri\u2019s hand shakes even harder in her grasp. It\u2019s awful. This is the worst thing Jester\u2019s ever had to do. She\u2019s holding the hand of one of her favourite people in the world and not elbow-deep in a demon\u2019s chest cavity, but this is the worst. She can feel the grief and the guilt churning in her upper chest, constricting her windpipe and winding down and out to the rest of her body. It\u2019s hot and cold at the same time, burning.</p><p>Kiri trembles against her chest, and lets out a low wail that chills Jester as the grief burns. It\u2019s long and drawn out and painstakingly sorrow-filled. It\u2019s not a noise Jester\u2019s ever heard in her life, and she immediately knows she never wants to hear it again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kiri,\u201d She repeats, and then again. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry. I wanted you to know - I know it hurts so badly but you deserved to know, he was your family too, and-\u201d</p><p>Kiri chirps over her. Her face is sorrow stricken, but in Nott\u2019s cheery voice she belts out, \u201cWelcome to the Mighty Nein!\u201d A pause. Jester\u2019s choked up, tear-strained voice; \u201cYour family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur family,\u201d Nott murmurs over Jester\u2019s shoulder. Jester nods.</p><p>\u201cOur family.\u201d She chokes out, and tightens her grip on Kiri\u2019s hand, pulling her in closer.</p><p>\u201cTake care of them,\u201d Kiri says, Molly\u2019s voice wrapping around the three of them. Try as Jester might to keep it in, another sob forces its way out of her throat.</p><p>\u201cTake care of them,\u201d Kiri repeats, and Jester can feel her tears start to soak into the front of her dress. \u201cTake care of them.\u201d<br/></p>",

It\u2019s a mirror to Yeza\u2019s expression, a mix of confusion and worry, and Jester feels something tug in her chest at the pure innocence of it all.</p><p>For all that Kiri had experienced with the Mighty Nein, she was just a child. That was part of why they had found her a home in Hupperdook. She needed a stable place to call home, somewhere where she could live out her childhood in relative safety and come home to a warm bed and a meal everyday. Jester had those things not too many years ago. She knows Fjord hadn\u2019t, and she also knows that Fjord\u2019s covered in scars, physical and otherwise. Kiri deserved safety, deserved to be sheltered from the harsher world until she was old enough to handle it. Jester had taught her how to tell people off, to get them to leave her alone. Fjord had handed her a dagger. They\u2019d done their best in the interim, but Hupperdook had been the long-term solution. And yet, here she is, only a few months later, coming back to shatter that safety, that shelter from the horrors of Wildmount.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kiri\u2026\u201d Jester sighs. She sniffles, and wipes the back of her hand across her tear-stained face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kiri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kiri repeats back. The feathers along her neck ruffle up and she shifts back a little, looking guilty. It\u2019s an expression that twists in Jester\u2019s gut.</p><p>\u201cOh no Kiri! You didn\u2019t do anything wrong!\u201d Jester reassures her, scooting forward on her knees to cup the side of Kiri\u2019s face, the feather soft under her fingers, \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Kiri chirps, still in Jester\u2019s voice. She blinks slowly up at Jester. Expectantly. Still confused.</p><p>It\u2019s too hard to say. The words get caught in her throat every time, guilt choking them down. She should have been there. She should have been there, she should have fought harder against the Shepherds, she should have bought a diamond the moment she realized she needed one while they were still in Zadash. All the power of the Traveller coursing through her veins, and all she could do was tuck a single card into the soil. Molly had been her partner in crime, her <i>brother</i>, and she hadn\u2019t been there when he - when all of the Nein - needed her most.</p><p>Something must be showing on her face as she stares down at Kiri, because the girl thrills softly, gently, like she\u2019s approaching a small, timid animal. The feathers on the top of her head brush against Jester\u2019s chin as she leans in, and Jester feels small wings rise up past her sides, small clawed fingers at the end clutching at the back of her cloak.\u201cOkay. Okay,\u201d Kiri trills, and Jester feels a sob wrench its way out of her chest.</p><p>Her hands reach up, wrapping into the back of Kiri\u2019s tiny tunic. She doesn\u2019t wail, or sob, not after the first one. Because Kiri is a child, and Jester is an adult, and she needs to be strong. She is strong. She can do it. Kiri needs to know what happened and Jester is strong.</p><p>\u201cI will be okay, Kiri,\u201d Jester murmurs, separating them again. <i>Look at her. She needs you to be strong for her. Let her see you.</i> \u201cBut something very, very sad happened.\u201d</p><p>Kiri\u2019s eyes, wide as saucers already, widen even further. She opens her beak and low growling noise comes out, and it takes Jester a second to place it as the growls of the crocodile-creatures in the swamp, the ones they had rescued her from.</p><p>\u201cWorse than that,\u201d Jester says weakly, and clasps Kiri\u2019s small talon in her own hand. It\u2019s trembling. \u201cWe went somewhere dangerous after we said goodbye to you and your little family and - and something very bad happened.\u201d She takes a deep, deep breath, and out of the corner of her eye she can see Nott\u2019s head turn back towards them. Her golden eyes are swollen and puffy, darker green around the edges. She detaches from Yeza, placing a hand on Jester\u2019s shoulder. It helps just enough to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cMolly didn\u2019t make it back.\u201d</p><p>Her voice cracks at the end and her vision immediately goes blurry as more tears force their way out. Nott\u2019s hand tightens, and Kiri\u2019s hand shakes even harder in her grasp. It\u2019s awful. This is the worst thing Jester\u2019s ever had to do. She\u2019s holding the hand of one of her favourite people in the world and not elbow-deep in a demon\u2019s chest cavity, but this is the worst. She can feel the grief and the guilt churning in her upper chest, constricting her windpipe and winding down and out to the rest of her body. It\u2019s hot and cold at the same time, burning.</p><p>Kiri trembles against her chest, and lets out a low wail that chills Jester as the grief burns. It\u2019s long and drawn out and painstakingly sorrow-filled. It\u2019s not a noise Jester\u2019s ever heard in her life, and she immediately knows she never wants to hear it again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kiri,\u201d She repeats, and then again. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry. I wanted you to know - I know it hurts so badly but you deserved to know, he was your family too, and-\u201d</p><p>Kiri chirps over her. Her face is sorrow stricken, but in Nott\u2019s cheery voice she belts out, \u201cWelcome to the Mighty Nein!\u201d A pause. Jester\u2019s choked up, tear-strained voice; \u201cYour family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur family,\u201d Nott murmurs over Jester\u2019s shoulder. Jester nods.</p><p>\u201cOur family.\u201d She chokes out, and tightens her grip on Kiri\u2019s hand, pulling her in closer.</p><p>\u201cTake care of them,\u201d Kiri says, Molly\u2019s voice wrapping around the three of them. Try as Jester might to keep it in, another sob forces its way out of her throat.</p><p>\u201cTake care of them,\u201d Kiri repeats, and Jester can feel her tears start to soak into the front of her dress. \u201cTake care of them.\u201d<br></p>",
