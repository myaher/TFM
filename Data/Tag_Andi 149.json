It is certainly the largest step Disney Channel has taken as far as intersectionality and feminist themes, but I think it would be unfair to choose one series to be the\u00a0\u201cfirst\u201d to hold that title, considering how many other shows laid the ground work for Andi Mack to be what it is today. Choosing one definitive\u00a0\u201cfirst\u201d makes it feel like a race to me, when in fact it is a never-ending journey.</p><p>That\u2019s So Raven is a great example of that. One of the few series on the network to have a black main cast, and with episodes tackling racism, body image, and foster care - it was a big step towards progress as well. Along with that would be shows like Lizzie McGuire, The Proud Family, etc. Even in more recent years - the work Zendaya put into making sure KC Undercover centered around a black family and had feminist messages was super important in making Andi Mack what it is.</p><p>And while Andi Mack does have themes of intersectionality and feminism - it hasn\u2019t really covered all of its bases. The show features racial diversity, different cultural traditions and belief systems, gay characters, some disability representation, and undertones of themes involving racism, feminism and equality - but many of the people who are most marginalized or who already experience the most intolerance are not represented. We don\u2019t see any black or brown characters with dark skin. We don\u2019t see any Muslim characters. We don\u2019t see any fat characters. We don\u2019t see any characters with visible physical disabilities. We don\u2019t really see any poor characters (unless you count Amber).\u00a0We don\u2019t see any openly transgender or nonbinary characters.\u00a0</p><p>And while I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s Andi Mack\u2019s job to represent <i>everyone </i>to that degree, I think it just goes to show how much more progress there is to be made when it comes to normalizing intersectionality on TV in general, but especially in children\u2019s TV.\u00a0 Like I said in my pieces about sexuality on the show, we should NEVER erase the progress this show has made or what it stands for. The same goes for all of the shows that came before it with feminist themes and diversity. But the fact still stands that there is a long way to go and any shows that come after Andi Mack which cares about these same themes will still owe a lot of credit to this series for fighting for the ability to tell these stories.</p><p>I have another piece in my drafts that I\u2019m working on which I\u2019m going to address the way Andi Mack handles feminist themes through subtext so I\u2019m not going to address that part as much here, but that will be coming eventually. It ties into this point very well but I think it will be better for me to split it into two. (Plus the other piece is in response to an ask that I got like 3 days before this one so I should really answer them eventually).</p>",

It is certainly the largest step Disney Channel has taken as far as intersectionality and feminist themes, but I think it would be unfair to choose one series to be the\u00a0\u201cfirst\u201d to hold that title, considering how many other shows laid the ground work for Andi Mack to be what it is today.

One of the few series on the network to have a black main cast, and with episodes tackling racism, body image, and foster care - it was a big step towards progress as well.

To live in a world of impossible powers and unimaginable adventure? Well, Cyrus hadn\u2019t. He was fine living a peaceful life as a shepherd in the small village in Greece where he had been born, enjoying his life with his two best friends, Andi and Buffy. But you don\u2019t always get what you want. That\u2019s what he had learned from Apollo.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>You know that trick Greek gods like to pull when they come to the land of mortals? You know, making themselves look old and feeble to see if anyone would help them? Yeah, that trick.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>And Cyrus couldn\u2019t resist because he loved being helpful! When he saw a limping old man walking through town, he couldn\u2019t NOT ask if he could give him a meal and a bed for the night. He wasn\u2019t an animal!</h2><h2>So Cyrus has taken the god Apollo, disguised as an old man into his house so that he could get warm.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cWould you like anything to eat\u201d, Cyrus had asked the god as he helped him into the only chair he had in his small house.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cA bowl of soup would be nice, if you wouldn\u2019t mind\u201d, the god had said, barely hiding a grin from Cyrus as he went into the part of the house he used as his kitchen. He should\u2019ve known then that something was up, but had ignored it to be polite.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>Cyrus got a bowl and filled it with cold soup from last night. He wished he could warm it up, but he had run out of fire wood and Buffy wouldn\u2019t be back for a few hours. The man assured him that it was fine and started eating.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>And eating.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>And eating.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>The man had silently ate what was left in the pot from the night before(nearly three-quarters of a pot!) in the matter of a few hours.</h2><h2>Cyrus had planning to have that last him all week, saving up his food for a meeting in town that Saturday, but he tampered down his irritation, justifying the man\u2019s actions by telling himself it was what he got for bringing in a hungry old man inside the house.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>But then the man said, \u201cIs that all you have?\u201d</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>Cyrus jaw dropped. He was about to say something when the small door opened.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>In came his two best friends, Andi with flower crowns and bracelets and Buffy trailing along with an armful of fire wood.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cCyrus\u2014Oh. Who\u2019s this?\u201d, Andi asked, looking at the man curiously. Buffy frowned and raised her eyebrow, shooting a disapproving look in Cyrus\u2019s direction.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cOh, um this is, um. Sorry sir, what was your name again?\u201d, Cyrus asked the food-stealing old man in front of him, silently cursing that he was so polite.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>The man only smiled as stood up. As he raised himself to his full height, transforming into a blond, muscled young man with tan skin and golden eyes. He grinned at the three mortals in front of him, showing perfect shining white teeth.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cI am Apollo\u201d, Apollo said haughtily. \u201cI had originally planned to visit this nasty old man who was bothering Demeter about something, but I stumbled into you instead.\u201d He continued, his glowing eyes landing on Cyrus. \u201cAh, just as well, I was looking for an assistant anyway. And I guess I could give you two as Eros\u2019s helpers, or maybe his mother would be more enclined for you two&hellip;\u201d</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cWait, excuse me?\u201d, Buffy asked, incredulous as the god started trailing off.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cI\u201d, the god said, proudly. \u201cAm giving you three the gift of eternal life!\u201d</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>His declaration was met with blank stares.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cWhy?\u201d, Andi finally asked.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m feeling generous! Anyone would love to become a god, even a minor one, so are you ready to become servants to the gods?\u201d</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>The three looked at each other. Gods? Immortal life? They could be working together for ever. The girls had excited looks on their faces, but Cyrus was a little skeptical. But seeing his friends faces, how could he say no. Besides, it couldn\u2019t be that bad, right?</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>The three mortals took one final look at each other and nodded to Apollo.</h2><h2>Immediately they were swept up into a swirling vortex of golds and yellows and reds and then suddenly, they were standing in the courtyard of a magnificent palace, the building reaching higher than the three of them could see. All around them was beautiful homes and gardens and temples and they were overwhelmed.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>Then, they felt a warmth in their chests. They started to glow and they were heated from the inside out. The heat and the light came to its apex and then receded into whatever place it had come from.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cThere\u201d, Apollo said. \u201cYou are now gods.\u201d</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d, Andi asked, but the god just rolled his eyes.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cWhat are we supposed to do now?\u201d, Cyrus asked.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cThat!\u201d, came a thundering voice. \u201cIs an excellent question.\u201d</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>In front of them appeared a young girl, about sixteen, shining like the moon on the darkest night.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cMy brother\u201d, the lady Artemis said, \u201cWho have you brought here today?\u201d</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>The three friends bowed to the lady as she approached, less surprised but still in awe of the goddess.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cSister Artemis! I\u2019m glad you have come. I\u2019m sure one of these girls would prove useful in your hunt!\u201d</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>One of them? They were being split up? He was about to raise the question when he saw the look on Buffy\u2019s face. Artemis\u2019s hunt was legendary, a place for young women to run with the awe-inspiring goddess. Buffy had grown up hunting with her brothers, it was something she had only dreamed about. For her happiness, Cyrus could stand not seeing them everyday. And if anyone deserved to be in the hunt, it was Buffy.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>Artemis seemed to agree. \u201cYou\u201d, she said, looking intently at the newly-made minor goddess. \u201cYou have a strong heart and great skills. You would be a fine addition to the hunt. But I must warn you that you can not have any romantic relationship while you are in the hunt. Do you still wish to join?\u201d</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>Buffy looked into the goddess\u2019s eyes, determined. \u201cI understand, my lady. And I would wish to join your ranks.\u201d</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>After that it was a flurry of goodbyes and promises that they would see each other plenty, from both the lifelong friends and the gods, and then Buffy and her patron were gone.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>Andi was about to ask about her role, when a woman draped in flowers came down the path with a lady in a dress made of wheat. These two women were of course Persephone and her mother Demeter.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>The two women stopped in front of the new godlings. The flowers on Andi\u2019s arms and head seemed to catch Persephone\u2019s eye and they were suddenly discussing flower arrangements. It wasn\u2019t long before Andi was also swept away, the new haindmaiden of the goddess of flowers and springtime.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do now?\u201d, Cyrus wondered aloud, forgetting about the god on his left.</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>\u201cWell I thought that would be obvious\u201d, Apollo said, grinning. \u201cYou will be working for me.\u201d</h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>And that was what Cyrus was doing. And honestly? He loved it. He loved helping a doctor make a new medication, he loved helping a poet complete one last play, he even liked taking care of Apollo\u2019s sun horses. Apollo was a little annoying, but overall, he was a good patron. </h2><h2><br/></h2><h2>The prophecies, though. Those were trouble.</h2>",

To live in a world of impossible powers and unimaginable adventure? Well, Cyrus hadn\u2019t. He was fine living a peaceful life as a shepherd in the small village in Greece where he had been born, enjoying his life with his two best friends, Andi and Buffy. But you don\u2019t always get what you want. That\u2019s what he had learned from Apollo.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>You know that trick Greek gods like to pull when they come to the land of mortals? You know, making themselves look old and feeble to see if anyone would help them? Yeah, that trick.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>And Cyrus couldn\u2019t resist because he loved being helpful! When he saw a limping old man walking through town, he couldn\u2019t NOT ask if he could give him a meal and a bed for the night. He wasn\u2019t an animal!</h2><h2>So Cyrus has taken the god Apollo, disguised as an old man into his house so that he could get warm.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cWould you like anything to eat\u201d, Cyrus had asked the god as he helped him into the only chair he had in his small house.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cA bowl of soup would be nice, if you wouldn\u2019t mind\u201d, the god had said, barely hiding a grin from Cyrus as he went into the part of the house he used as his kitchen. He should\u2019ve known then that something was up, but had ignored it to be polite.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Cyrus got a bowl and filled it with cold soup from last night. He wished he could warm it up, but he had run out of fire wood and Buffy wouldn\u2019t be back for a few hours. The man assured him that it was fine and started eating.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>And eating.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>And eating.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>The man had silently ate what was left in the pot from the night before(nearly three-quarters of a pot!) in the matter of a few hours.</h2><h2>Cyrus had planning to have that last him all week, saving up his food for a meeting in town that Saturday, but he tampered down his irritation, justifying the man\u2019s actions by telling himself it was what he got for bringing in a hungry old man inside the house.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>But then the man said, \u201cIs that all you have?\u201d</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Cyrus jaw dropped. He was about to say something when the small door opened.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>In came his two best friends, Andi with flower crowns and bracelets and Buffy trailing along with an armful of fire wood.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cCyrus\u2014Oh. Who\u2019s this?\u201d, Andi asked, looking at the man curiously. Buffy frowned and raised her eyebrow, shooting a disapproving look in Cyrus\u2019s direction.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cOh, um this is, um. Sorry sir, what was your name again?\u201d, Cyrus asked the food-stealing old man in front of him, silently cursing that he was so polite.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>The man only smiled as stood up. As he raised himself to his full height, transforming into a blond, muscled young man with tan skin and golden eyes. He grinned at the three mortals in front of him, showing perfect shining white teeth.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cI am Apollo\u201d, Apollo said haughtily. \u201cI had originally planned to visit this nasty old man who was bothering Demeter about something, but I stumbled into you instead.\u201d He continued, his glowing eyes landing on Cyrus. \u201cAh, just as well, I was looking for an assistant anyway. And I guess I could give you two as Eros\u2019s helpers, or maybe his mother would be more enclined for you two\u2026\u201d</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cWait, excuse me?\u201d, Buffy asked, incredulous as the god started trailing off.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cI\u201d, the god said, proudly. \u201cAm giving you three the gift of eternal life!\u201d</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>His declaration was met with blank stares.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cWhy?\u201d, Andi finally asked.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m feeling generous! Anyone would love to become a god, even a minor one, so are you ready to become servants to the gods?\u201d</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>The three looked at each other. Gods? Immortal life? They could be working together for ever. The girls had excited looks on their faces, but Cyrus was a little skeptical. But seeing his friends faces, how could he say no. Besides, it couldn\u2019t be that bad, right?</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>The three mortals took one final look at each other and nodded to Apollo.</h2><h2>Immediately they were swept up into a swirling vortex of golds and yellows and reds and then suddenly, they were standing in the courtyard of a magnificent palace, the building reaching higher than the three of them could see. All around them was beautiful homes and gardens and temples and they were overwhelmed.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Then, they felt a warmth in their chests. They started to glow and they were heated from the inside out. The heat and the light came to its apex and then receded into whatever place it had come from.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cThere\u201d, Apollo said. \u201cYou are now gods.\u201d</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d, Andi asked, but the god just rolled his eyes.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cWhat are we supposed to do now?\u201d, Cyrus asked.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cThat!\u201d, came a thundering voice. \u201cIs an excellent question.\u201d</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>In front of them appeared a young girl, about sixteen, shining like the moon on the darkest night.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cMy brother\u201d, the lady Artemis said, \u201cWho have you brought here today?\u201d</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>The three friends bowed to the lady as she approached, less surprised but still in awe of the goddess.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cSister Artemis! I\u2019m glad you have come. I\u2019m sure one of these girls would prove useful in your hunt!\u201d</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>One of them? They were being split up? He was about to raise the question when he saw the look on Buffy\u2019s face. Artemis\u2019s hunt was legendary, a place for young women to run with the awe-inspiring goddess. Buffy had grown up hunting with her brothers, it was something she had only dreamed about. For her happiness, Cyrus could stand not seeing them everyday. And if anyone deserved to be in the hunt, it was Buffy.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Artemis seemed to agree. \u201cYou\u201d, she said, looking intently at the newly-made minor goddess. \u201cYou have a strong heart and great skills. You would be a fine addition to the hunt. But I must warn you that you can not have any romantic relationship while you are in the hunt. Do you still wish to join?\u201d</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Buffy looked into the goddess\u2019s eyes, determined. \u201cI understand, my lady. And I would wish to join your ranks.\u201d</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>After that it was a flurry of goodbyes and promises that they would see each other plenty, from both the lifelong friends and the gods, and then Buffy and her patron were gone.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Andi was about to ask about her role, when a woman draped in flowers came down the path with a lady in a dress made of wheat. These two women were of course Persephone and her mother Demeter.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>The two women stopped in front of the new godlings. The flowers on Andi\u2019s arms and head seemed to catch Persephone\u2019s eye and they were suddenly discussing flower arrangements. It wasn\u2019t long before Andi was also swept away, the new haindmaiden of the goddess of flowers and springtime.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do now?\u201d, Cyrus wondered aloud, forgetting about the god on his left.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>\u201cWell I thought that would be obvious\u201d, Apollo said, grinning. \u201cYou will be working for me.\u201d</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>And that was what Cyrus was doing. And honestly? He loved it. He loved helping a doctor make a new medication, he loved helping a poet complete one last play, he even liked taking care of Apollo\u2019s sun horses. Apollo was a little annoying, but overall, he was a good patron. </h2><h2><br></h2><h2>The prophecies, though. Those were trouble.</h2></p>",
