Until he no longer had the pressing urge to get out of town every chance\nhe got, visiting Eleanor on the weekly. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Final exams rolled in way too fast and left him feeling\nwholly unprepared. No matter how many study dates and trips to the library he\nset up, it never seemed to be enough. Law books were big and heavy, pulling on\nhim with every step that brought him closer to the exam halls. Eleanor, whose\nexams didn\u2019t start until the day after his, stayed with him and made him a full\nfry for breakfast the morning before his first test. It was her way of trying\nto offer her support when she knew that as a neurosciences student she was\ncompletely useless when it came to helping him study. </p><!-- more --><p>Although he liked to think he was fully over Rosie by May,\nit still gave him some sort of satisfaction when Eleanor gave a resolute \u201cyes\u201d\nto his ex\u2019s polite \u201cyou alright?\u201d as they sat at the kitchen table. </p><p>He wondered how she would greet Phil if she knew the ins and\nouts of their agreement. His phone lit up, signalling a new Snap from Davis.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Summer was a gift from god.</p><p>After missing their November weekend together Dan and\nEleanor spent a whole week exploring Rome in early August, completely avoiding\nthe topics of love lives and university and focusing on sunshine and gelato and\nthe ancient history they were walking around in on their flipflops. They held\nhands the way they\u2019d done in primary school, before they hit puberty and girls\nand boys weren\u2019t supposed to do that kind of stuff anymore. Before they cared\nabout what anyone thought of their relationship.</p><p>Dan neglected to mention to her that on the last night, when\nshe went to the bathroom as they were having a couple of drinks at the hotel\nbar, an Irish boy slipped him a napkin with a string of numbers on it\naccompanied by the words, \u201cif you\u2019re not interested feel free to bin this, but\notherwise, text me\u201d. Dan shoved it in his pocket, where it stayed until he got\nback to his parents\u2019 house in London and he unpacked his suitcase. He stood\nwith the paper in his hand for a minute or so, and then another few minutes\nstaring at the new contact in his phone. </p><p>Sat cross-legged on the bed he carefully crafted a message.\nAs he was typing it took everything from his willpower not to close the app and\ngo to google. To just type in that one name that he\u2019d put into that bar so many\ntimes before. Instead, he resolutely tapped the \u2018send\u2019 button and then\nproceeded to put his phone under his pillow to leave it there for the next\ncouple of hours.</p><p>When Nicholas replied he was almost surprised. They spent\nthe next couple of weeks texting and although Dan had initially been sceptical,\nthe more he learnt about Nick, the more he felt that there might be something\nand he might not need to be stuck on his Christmas dates for the rest of his\nlife. </p><p>Nick was nice. Genuinely nice. He was a good listener, made\njokes at the right time, and had an intricate knowledge of all kinds of animals\nas he was studying to become a vet. Dan found himself looking forward to the\nevenings when Nick got home from placement and the two of them could Skype call\nbefore they went to bed. Long nights were spent lying on his back on the\ncarpet, feet propped up against the side of his desk, phone tucked comfortably\nbetween his shoulder and his ear. He could hear the Irish boy smile through the\nphone. </p><p>He liked Nick. He really did. But when in early October he\nasked him that dreaded question, \u201cso, what are we?\u201d, Dan couldn\u2019t stop his\nfight or flight response from kicking in. Unsure of whether he feared commitment\nto a boy or commitment to anyone at all, he broke it off. </p><p>From there on, things went downhill. Fast.</p><p>One of the boys Dan lived with dropped out, meaning they had\nto either find a new flatmate or a new place, and the others\u2019 half-hearted\nsearch for a house stressed him out. University was pulling on him like a ball\non a chain and the words danced before his eyes on the nights he tried to catch\nup with the stacks of work accumulating on his desk. Eleanor\u2019s ugly selfies\nsent over snapchat were only doing so much to put a smile on his face, their\neffects diminishing with every day.</p><p>Two weeks after Reuben had left, Dan sent in his student\nwithdrawal form.</p><p>Three days later, he found the courage to tell his parents,\nsat on Eleanor\u2019s bed with one hand in hers and the other hand clutching the\nphone held to his ear. Everything was falling apart, but the one constant he\ncould always count on was his best friend always being right by his side.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dan moved back home hesitantly. His old bedroom felt too\nsmall for him and his hometown was full of eyes watching him, knowing he didn\u2019t\nbelong there anymore. </p><p>What did he actually want to do with his life? He had no\nidea, really. His new job at an electronics shop was not it though, that was\nfor damn sure. It had him drifting through the days, every week feeling like\nthe last, endless and exhausting. To pass the time he messed around with the\nproducts when he got bored, feeling professional when he pressed buttons on the\nDJ sets knowing what they did, and adjusting camera lenses with expert eyes. In\nthose moments he felt for a moment like he was on the right path, just not\nknowing where it would lead him yet.</p><p>In mid-December Dan used his first wages to buy one of those\nfancy cameras. He spent hours in his bedroom sat cross-legged on the floor\nadjusting settings and filming little test videos, the reality of his world\nforgotten for a precious while.</p><p>Four days before Christmas Dan planted the camera up on one\nof his book shelves, fixed his hair in the mirror for exactly two minutes\nlonger than necessary, and then pressed the record button. </p><p>He filmed his first video in one go, with rambling tangents\nand awkward pauses to edit out later, which he did the day after, when he got\nhome from work. He was tired. After a nine-hour day the last thing his eyes\nwanted to do was focus deeply on something for another couple of hours. One by\none his family members went to bed, the sounds of their bedroom doors closing\nreaching Dan even through his headphones. In the morning, when his alarm would\ngo off at half seven again, he\u2019d hate himself for this, but that felt well\nworth it when he clicked \u2018upload\u2019 and watched the bar load up to a 100%. It was\ntwo in the morning when his first ever YouTube video went live.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dan and Eleanor had bought tickets for the ballet in early\nDecember almost out of habit. There had been no discussing it, just Eleanor\nasking if he\u2019d already bought them or if she should. On the day before\nChristmas Eve she picked him up in her car, blasting Mariah Carey so loud Dan\ncould hear it the moment he stepped out the front door. She was wearing a\nbeautiful silver dress and had her hair braided back so her elegant hoop\nearrings were clearly visible. He complimented her as he plopped down in the\npassenger seat of her Volkswagen. </p><p>He tried to play it cool, but it was difficult to do so when\nhe\u2019d been looking forward to this night for months. It felt on the verge of\npathetic, but his monotonous job left him with plenty of headspace to\ncontemplate all that could happen and might be in the future. He\u2019d lived this\nday and the next dozens of times over in his head stood behind the counter\nsmiling artificially at customers as he rang up their purchases. \u00a0</p><p>They knew their way around the theatre by now. They knew\nwhere to find the coat room, and the fact that it cost 50p per coat, and they\nknew the quickest route up to the balcony and the toilet closest to it. Dan ran\nhis hands over the balustrade as they walked to their spots. The place was\nstill fully lit, giving him a view of the seats and the stage below. Two little\ngirls were on stage in front of the curtains, doing pirouettes and falling out\nof them with big grins decorating their little faces. He stood and watched them\nfor a moment, until he felt Eleanor demonstratively lean over the railing next\nto him. \u201cYou excited?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d He said without tearing his gaze away from\nthe kids.</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to him at all since last year?\u201d </p><p>Dan shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t even have his number. I don\u2019t\nknow his last name or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought you had a somewhat regulated plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re both single by Christmas, we spend the night\ntogether. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole plan.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re a bit of a disaster, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He said. He sighed deeply, leaning further down\nuntil his chin came to rest on his hands. \u201cI\u2019ve given up trying to sort this\nout, I\u2019m just along for the ride now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, but without needing to look over Dan\nknew she was rolling her eyes at him. </p><p>They watched the girls dance until they were ushered off the\nstage and the lights started to dim. The hall had filled up quite a bit since\nthey\u2019d turned their back on the balcony, and they had to shuffle past grumbly\nchic people annoyed they had to move their legs to let them past. It was Dan and\nEl\u2019s third year. They were used to the rich people by now.</p><p>The lead dancers had all changed. He recognised the previous\nlead as one of the background dancers, along with a couple of others who\u2019d had\nbig roles the years before. Phil was nowhere to be found. Dan had a heavy\nfeeling in his stomach as he watched them float across the stage. Eleanor\nnoticed too, taking her best friend\u2019s hand in hers and squeezing it tightly.\nThey exchanged a short glance, but Dan couldn\u2019t bear looking her in the eyes\nfor too long, too embarrassed about his situation and the hope he\u2019d displayed\nbefore the show. She knew he\u2019d been excited for their meeting and Phil\u2019s not\nbeing there made him feel ashamed, naive almost. His eyes absentmindedly\nfollowed the ballerinas, not really taking anything in.</p><p>Eleanor kept a firm grip on his hand, pulling him downstairs\nto the bar and pushing a glass of champagne into his hand. She wasn\u2019t sure what\nto say either, clearly. Dan could see the radars in her head spin as she tried\nto come up with a way to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d </p><p>He saw Eleanor\u2019s eyes light up before he turned and faced\nthe person who\u2019d said his name.</p><p>Phil was wearing slacks and a button-down shirt, his hair\nneatly swept to one side. He looked older, more mature. Dan was glad Eleanor had\nmade him dress up that year, so he knew he looked good. He subconsciously\nreached up and tugged on his tie a bit as he looked the dancer up and down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d He managed to say.</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might not be here this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on the team anymore. Not as a dancer, at least.\nI\u2019ve taken up that coaching position like I told you I might last year, I\u2019m\nassistant coach now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s not that spectacular, I\u2019m not sure if it\ndeserves congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve done better for yourself than I have.\u201d Dan\nsaid. It was out there before he could stop himself, and the moment he\u2019d said\nit he was afraid he\u2019d enclosed too much information about his personal life.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me all about it after the show,\u201d Phil said, \u201cI\nhave to get back to the team now. I was just coming to say hi and make sure you\nknew I was here. Backdoor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d </p><p>He watched Phil leave before turning around to face Eleanor,\nwho had a smug look on her face. \u201cSee, it\u2019s all fine.\u201d She said.</p><p>\u201cYou say that now, but you were afraid he wouldn\u2019t be here\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She admitted. She touched her champagne glass to\nhis, \u201cCheers to another fun night for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd cheers for hopefully one for you. You deserve one.\u201d </p><p>He meant it. After Nicola cheated on her six months into\ntheir relationship she\u2019d stayed away from boys for a while, but a week earlier\nshe\u2019d said she might try and pull on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of December, for the\nfirst time in months. He watched her eye a guy standing behind them as she\nnodded and took a sip of her drink. \u201cI sure do.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help but break into a smile when he watched\nPhil approach. He was stopped a few times along the way to shake hands and\nreceive pats on the shoulder, but eventually he made it over and to Dan\u2019s\nsurprise he leaned in and kissed him right in front of everyone. \u201cAre you ready\nto go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, can you just leave?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s walk.\u201d</p><p>The moment they stepped out into the cold Dan glanced over\nto see if Phil would change his mind about walking, but he didn\u2019t. They both\nput up the collars on their coats and bowed their heads against the wind. Dan\nhad his hands shoved deep into his pockets until he felt Phil\u2019s fingers brush\nagainst his wrist. Wordlessly, their fingers intertwined and fell between their\ntwo bodies.</p><p>\u201cIt was a good performance.\u201d Dan said eventually.</p><p>He saw Phil nod from the corner of his eye, \u201cThey trained\ntheir little hearts out. The lead got sick three days ago, so this was the\nunderstudy performing. She\u2019d never had this big a role before and was so\nnervous, bless her.\u201d He smiled to himself.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start coaching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the start of the new schoolyear, this September. I\nstill dance too, just not on this team anymore. I\u2019ve stopped competing too, I\u2019m\njust doing it for fun on the side now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must\u2019ve been a transition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I struggled with it a bit. Still do, really. I miss\nit, but I know this is where I need to be and what I need to be doing.\u201d</p><p>Dan stayed quiet. His mind drifted to his own situation, how\nhe was far from where he needed to be. He bit his lip, face numb with the cold.</p><p>Phil squeezed his hand. The only comfort he could offer\nwithout asking too much about his life outside of their Christmas dates.</p><p>The hotel was a twenty-minute walk from the theatre, and\nwhen they finally stepped into the lobby Dan\u2019s whole body started stinging as\nthe warmth from inside hit him. Next to him, Phil rubbed his hands together and\nblew on them. His cheeks were bright red, shimmering in the bright lights. Dan\ncouldn\u2019t help remarking in his mind that he looked cute and kissable.</p><p>They took the lift up. Hand-in-hand once again, eyes shyly\nmeeting through their reflections in the mirror. The third time and still it\nfelt new and exciting.</p><p>There was only one big, king-sized bed in the room this\nyear. Phil\u2019s suitcase was on the floor by the desk with a couple of items\nstrewn over the chair. </p><p>\u201cSo, I have a suggestion. You can say no if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Dan said, raising his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI brought a really nice bath bomb. From Lush. The bath is\nfairly spacious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Phil grabbed him by his tie and pulled him in, their lips\ntouching together gently. </p><p>They got undressed as the bath ran in the other room. Phil\nwas still as toned and gorgeous as he had been the years before and Dan\u2019s\nfingers itched to reach out and touch him. He had to have patience. Soon\nenough, they\u2019d be bunched up in the bath, with no other choice but to touch\neach other.</p><p>The bath bomb fizzed and coloured the water a pale, glittery\nblue. Phil lined up the little hotel shampoos and soaps on the side, his\nmuscles flexing under his taut skin as he moved. Dan\u2019s eyes were glued to him,\nmesmerised. </p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d </p><p>Phil got in first, settling in comfortably before beckoning\nDan over. The latter was hesitant, trying to be elegant about it and almost\nslipping in the process. A small tidal wave splashed over the side of the bath\nas he steadied himself on the tap. Phil laughed. He was relaxed, with his head\nresting against the wall and his arms stretched out over the sides of the bath.\nThe hot water made Dan want to relax, but the situation was so foreign and new\nto him that he was struggling to keep his composure altogether and was happy\nenough when he finally settled down with his knees pulled into his chest.</p><p>The bath water being blue obscured most areas Dan was\ninsecure about from sight, and soon enough he was relaxing his legs, stretching\nthem out alongside Phil\u2019s. \u201cSo, how was your year?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>He was good at asking those questions that could be answered\nby pretty much anything, leaving the decision as to where to draw the line with\nDan once again. \u201cGood,\u201d the latter said hesitantly, \u201cit was a ride.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed, \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m- I was in university before. I dropped out.\u201d Phil\ndidn\u2019t seem to judge him, just nodding encouragingly for Dan to go on. \u201cSo, I\nwork in a store now. Trying to, you know, sort out my life and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do when you\u2019re older?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, die maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s valid. But before that?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know, honestly.\u201d</p><p>Phil decided not to press anymore, and Dan quickly took the\nopportunity to ask about his year.</p><p>\u201cIt was good. I went on my last Europe tour as a member of\nthe team instead of a coach, so that was a bit bittersweet. I\u2019m excited to\ncoach though. Oh, I finally moved out, too. Was about time.\u201d He laughed, the\nwater moving off him in little waves.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dan put on his underwear before he dried any other part of\nhis body. Phil had no such inclination, stood in the middle of the hotel room\nstark-naked while drying his hair. The bed looked cosy and inviting, and\nalthough the room was warm enough Dan longed to curl up under the covers for a\nwhile.</p><p>Wearing just his pants he crawled into bed and pulled the\nduvet up to his chin. While he waited for the other to finish up, he grabbed\nthe remote control off the bedside table and turned the TV on to a radio\nstation that was playing Christmas songs. The only thing this atmosphere needed\nto be perfect was a little scented candle, but Dan would settle for this.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ve been waiting pretty much all year to make out with\nyou. Do you mind doing that for a while before we decide what to do with the\nrest of our night?\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned, \u201cI think I\u2019m alright with that.\u201d</p><p>Phil slipped under the covers with him and pushed him down\nonto his back. Dan laced his fingers through Phil\u2019s mildly damp hair as they\nkissed. Maybe his flight response to Nicholas\u2019 question had had less to do with\nthe question of commitment to either a boy or anyone, and more to do with the\nfact that he was already committed to something. To a 24 hours period just\nbefore Christmas.</p><p>Phil\u2019s hands were a bit cold roaming his sides. They sent\nshivers down his spine, but he did nothing to stop them. </p><p>Soon enough they were both warmed up and their almost naked\nbodies moved together, arousal already showing. Every time Phil\u2019s hips touched\nagainst Dan\u2019s thigh it sent a pleasant shiver to his dick, his fingers\ntightening against Phil\u2019s hair and skin. It was pretty clear that \u2018what they\nwould be doing with the rest of their night\u2019 wasn\u2019t much of a question, really.\nWith the way hands and mouths were moving this was only going in one direction.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips had trailed off, going from Dan\u2019s neck to his\nchest and down to his belly. Looking down at him Dan watched the trail of faint\nhickeys grace down from his throat to the waistband of his boxers. Phil had\nalready moved on, his breath ghosting over the bulge in the fabric and his\nhands moving up Dan\u2019s thighs with confidence. </p><p>Although one part of his brain was focused solely on the\nfact that <i>a very attractive boy was about\nto give him a blowjob</i>, the other part of him couldn\u2019t help but think about\nwhat would happen after. The memory of last year was still fresh in his mind to\nput a slight damper on his excitement. He wanted to try again. The thought of\nactually having sex with Phil made his whole body tingle, but it was also\nscary. It was like losing his virginity all over again, where he had no idea\nwhat he was doing, and he just had to surrender all control to another, more\nexperienced party.</p><p>For a few minutes though, Dan\u2019s mind was completely taken\noff anything he could possibly worry about as Phil pulled down his underwear\nand put his mouth on him. He started by teasing along the shaft with his\ntongue, one hand holding him firmly by the base and the other with fingertips\nbarely grazing along his balls. Dan opened his eyes for a moment, glancing down\nat the sight below him. A soft sound escaped from the back of his throat before\nhis eyes closed again.</p><p>Phil was an expert. His mouth and hands moved just right,\nand much sooner than he wanted to Dan had to nudge him off to stop him from\nfinishing him off. \u201cCan we try last year again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to?\u201d Phil sat up on his heels. He\nneeded no further explanation; he knew what Dan meant.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I want to try, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say something stupid, but as it didn\u2019t work\nlast time, are you sure you really want it? Don\u2019t do it for me, I\u2019m doing\nperfectly fine without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, yes, I mean- I really want it. I do. I\u2019m just scared of\nthe pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go very slow. The moment it doesn\u2019t feel nice you give\nme a shout and I stop or take a step back, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Dan breathed.</p><p>The two of them kicked off their boxers, Dan pulling Phil\nback down for a quick kiss, but neither of them had much patience for a make\nout session knowing what was on the table now.</p><p>Phil had lube at the ready, spreading it on his fingers and\npressing soft butterfly kisses to Dan\u2019s abdomen as his hand moved down. Dan\nclosed his eyes. He felt more vulnerable than he ever had before. He was\nclutching at the sheets, but Phil carefully took one of his hands in his and\nsaid in a hushed tone, \u201cSqueeze my hand. Let me know if I do something wrong.\u201d</p><p>He kissed Dan\u2019s thigh while he pushed a finger in. Dan made\na sound and Phil\u2019s movements stilled, but he squeezed his hand, urging him to\ngo on. </p><p>He took it slow. Like he promised. He gave Dan time to\nadjust before putting a second finger in, and eventually let go of Dan\u2019s hand\nto tease his dick a bit, moving up and down in excruciatingly slow strokes. His\nwhole body was on fire, feelings things he\u2019d never felt before.</p><p>Eventually, after what felt like forever, Phil called him\nback to attention by pulling his fingers out and putting both hands on his\nhips, \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re well enough prepared, if you\u2019re still up for\nit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes followed Phil as he hopped off the bed and got a\ncondom from his suitcase. He tore open the wrapper and rolled the condom onto\nhimself with practised fingers, putting some extra lube on himself after. The\nactions of someone who\u2019d done this before and knew the pitfalls.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded. His throat was slightly closed up with nerves,\nbut as Phil settled in between his legs he felt no urge to move away. Rather,\nhe felt an impatient pull in his stomach, his dick twitching at the thought of\nwhat was about to happen. </p><p>The moment Phil\u2019s tip grazed his entrance Dan closed his\neyes and let his head fall back. He focused on relaxing, aided by Phil\u2019s\nsoothing hand on his side, rubbing circled into his skin with his thumb. Being\nfilled up felt weird, and it just kept coming until finally he felt Phil bottom\nout. He was given a few moments to adjust, catch his breath, which he took\nreluctantly. He wanted to move on. Desperate already even though he only had to\nwait a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d He muttered hoarsely.</p><p>Phil started slow. A practice run.</p><p>His hands were firmly holding on to Dan\u2019s hips as he started\nspeeding up little by little. Every time his hips touched against Dan and he\nwas fully filled up, Dan let out a shaky breath. He had no idea how long Phil\nwas going to last, but he didn\u2019t think he had a lot of time in him. His dick\nwas aching to be touched but he knew he\u2019d come very quickly if he gave into the\nurge.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Phil asked. The question came out\nbreathily, the words clearly an effort to utter.</p><p>\u201cGood. Too good, maybe.\u201d Phil gave him a questioning look,\nbut Dan took a few seconds to recover before he continued, \u201cI\u2019m getting close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d There was nothing in him that could muster up\neven the slightest bit of politeness. Phil didn\u2019t need any. His hand reached down,\nand fingers wrapped firmly around him. It only took a few firm strokes in time\nwith his hips to make Dan emit a desperate little sound and come all over his\nown belly. Phil followed shortly after, pushed over the edge by Dan\u2019s muscles\ncontracting around him.</p><p>Dan flinched when Phil pulled out. He felt overstimulated\nand sore, but completely satisfied. It was a tired, content kind of\nsatisfaction, making him want to finally curl up and go to sleep. \u201cWhat time is\nit?\u201d He whispered, following Phil\u2019s movements as the other went into the\nbathroom through half-closed eyes. </p><p>\u201cNearing half eleven.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed as much as his sleepy state allowed him to and\nclosed his eyes fully, \u201cI usually don\u2019t go to sleep for another two hours or\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go to sleep now, if you want.\u201d Phil\u2019s voice came\nfrom the other room.</p><p>\u201cHmm, up to you.\u201d</p><p>Phil returned, putting his underwear back on and slipping\nback under the covers with Dan, \u201cIf we go to sleep now we\u2019ll have loads of time\ntogether tomorrow. I\u2019m not leaving till the evening. If you want that, of\ncourse.\u201d</p><p>That woke Dan up. He opened his eyes and raised his head,\nbut Phil had turned the light off and the room was dark. \u201cOf course I want\nthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay. Sleep now, then. We\u2019ll have a lot of time\ntomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Dan turned around, picking his underwear off the floor and\nwiggling into them under the duvet. When he was done, Phil crawled up beside\nhim and wrapped his arms around him from behind. \u201cThis okay?\u201d He asked. His\nwarm breath stroked along Dan\u2019s neck, making his skin raise into goosebumps.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He whispered back.</p><p>He fell asleep with Phil\u2019s arms tightly wrapped around him,\nsoothed by his even breathing against his skin.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>When Dan woke up Phil was still fast asleep. He snuck out\nfrom under his arm and tiptoed to the bathroom, where it still smelt like fruit\nand mint or whatever the bath bomb had been. After peeing Dan put a bit of\nPhil\u2019s toothpaste in his mouth and sloshed it around for a bit; it would have\nto do. </p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d He was greeted by Phil, lying on his back with\none arm thrown over his face to protect his eyes from the sunlight, when he\nwalked back into the bedroom. </p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to order some room service and chill in bed while we\neat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d He leant down and kissed the top of Phil\u2019s\nhead without really thinking, not realising himself until he met the other\u2019s\neyes. Phil pulled him down with a hand on the back of his neck and pecked his\nlips.</p><p>They ordered room service on the hotel website, Dan getting\npancakes and Phil some vegan waffles. While they waited for it to arrive Dan\ngot dressed, splashing some water in his face and attempting to bring his hair\nto some kind of order. He startled when he felt hands touching his belly. Phil\nhad appeared behind him, wrapping his arms around Dan\u2019s waist and now resting\nhis chin on his shoulder. \u201cWhat do you want to do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything. I wouldn\u2019t mind staying in and just hanging out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, just talking, getting to know each other?\u201d Dan asked.\nIt was meant as a joke, but when Phil shrugged he nodded, \u201cAlright, sure.\u201d</p><p>They ate their breakfast sat cross-legged on the big double\nbed. Soft Christmas music played on the TV as they started chatting, carefully\nat first but quickly becoming more free in their questions and stories. </p><p>In the middle of one of his stories Phil suddenly called his\ndad \u2018Mr Lester\u2019, bringing the hand that was just about to put a bite of pancake\ninto Dan\u2019s mouth to an abrupt halt. Phil hadn\u2019t noticed, his lively\nstorytelling not stuttering for even a second. </p><p>But Dan had a name.</p><p>He had a full name to plug into the Google search bar rather\nthan just the name of the ballet company. He wasn\u2019t sure whether to try his\nabsolute hardest to forget it as soon as possible, or whether to save it to his\nlong-term memory and tattoo it onto his brain. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>At about half two, when Phil was lying flat on his back with\nDan\u2019s head resting on his belly, both staring at the ceiling and half at the\nother\u2019s hands gesturing in the air as they spoke, Dan\u2019s phone started ringing.\nThey both raised their heads, disturbed.</p><p>It was Eleanor. A picture of her and Dan as little kids in a\nplaypark illuminated the screen.</p><p>\u201cEl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny-boy, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Dan glanced over to the bed, where Phil had grabbed\nhis own phone and was scrolling through some missed messages.</p><p>\u201cI told your mum you\u2019re hanging out with a mate, but I can\u2019t\nhold her off forever.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Christmas crafts.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realised the time.\u201d </p><p>It was quiet on the other end for a moment, \u201cBring him.\u201d She\nsaid finally.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Dan, bring him.\u201d</p><p>It was a weird crossroad to be at. He had 24 hours with\nPhil, but he also had a best friend and a mum waiting for their Christmas\ntradition, and he\u2019d already let them down by being late. Last year in November\nhe\u2019d been at the same fork in the road, he realised, and he\u2019d made the wrong\ndecision then. He\u2019d chosen Rosie over Eleanor and he still hated himself for\nthat. It was clear-cut, really.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for forgetting the time, I\u2019ll be over as soon as\nI can. Get the crafts ready, I\u2019m feeling the creative juices flowing.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor laughed, the sound sending a relieved warmth to\nDan\u2019s heart. \u201cAlright, alright. See you soon. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d When Dan turned back to the bed he wasn\u2019t\nsure how to break the news. He bit his lip and sat down, awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a Christmas tradition with my mum and my best\nfriend. It\u2019s bad enough that I forgot about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Phil nodded. His smile said that he meant it,\n\u201cMy bus leaves at ten, we can have dinner together if you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me at the hotel entrance at seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, all good. Have a good day, Dan.\u201d</p><p>Dan bit the inside of his cheek. This was the right thing to\ndo, and he was looking forward to crafts, as he did each year, but this still\nfelt bittersweet. </p><p>When Phil opened his arms he happily fell into them, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry.\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about it. The day after is not\nusually a part of our tradition, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it would\u2019ve been nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it would\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Eleanor hugged him when he came in. Her arms were familiar\nand welcoming, and decidedly not upset with him. \u201cHow was your day, huh?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, \u201cMost excellent, thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear all about it. As soon as we\u2019re not with your\nmum anymore, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? You know about my thing, I want to hear\nabout your night.\u201d She winked at him and spun on her heel, walking to the\nliving room. \u201cEleanor, you bitch, you can\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, there you are! Did you have a good time with your\nfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, it was lovely.\u201d Dan said, doing his best to hide\nthe grin on his face that was mirrored by his best friend to his left. </p><p>Eleanor, always right beside him.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Scrolling was a bit more difficult than usual after the Glue\nAccident, but Eleanor managed it as she showed Dan Facebook pictures of a boy\nwith blonde curls and a toned dancer\u2019s body. They\u2019d done two hours of crafts\nwith Dan\u2019s mum and then quickly retreated to Dan\u2019s room with two steaming mugs\nof hot chocolate, now stood forgotten on the bedside table. </p><p>Cam seemed nice enough, but it was clear that Eleanor didn\u2019t\ncare much for his niceness: he\u2019d given her his number at the end of the night,\nbut when Dan asked her if she\u2019d put it into her phone she said she didn\u2019t even\nremember where she put the note. The night had but a content grin on her face\nthat was enough for now. A reminder that she still had it and that Nicola was a\nstupid idiot who was missing out, like Dan had been telling her for the past\ncouple of months.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about you? Why were you still with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here all day. Not leaving till nine tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you were going to spend the day with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still here?\u201d With every word she was sitting up a bit\nstraighter.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBros before hoes. Mums before- I don\u2019t know- bums? You know\nwhat I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, crafts over. Go back to him, God. Your mum and I will\nstill be here tonight and tomorrow and all the time after that.\u201d</p><p>Dan was quiet for a moment. \u201cEl,\u201d He said then, softly, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry about last November.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to explain what he meant. She gave him a sad\nsmile and a playful push against the shoulder that meant more than it led on,\n\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really am. I shouldn\u2019t have prioritised Rosie over you,\nand that was so fucking dumb of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you were an idiot. Still are, really.\u201d Eleanor\nagreed.</p><p>Dan grinned, \u201cYeah, alright, alright, calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve it though.\u201d She said, laughing along. Her hand,\nstill on his shoulder, shook him gently, \u201cGo. It\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll hang out tonight\nand watch Home Alone. After he\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You came to crafts, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wanted to miss it.\u201d He scrambled to his\nfeet and kissed the top of her head. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too, idiot.\u201d She shook her head at him as he left\nthe room.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>It was six o\u2019clock when he made it into the hotel lobby and\nthe realisation that he had no way of getting upstairs or contacting Phil to\nlet him in. He stood, probably suspiciously, next to the check-in desk for just\na little too long, before his stupid foggy brain finally thought of something\nto do.</p><p>\u201cEl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you calling me? Go have sex or something.\u201d She\nwhispered the last part, probably still at his house, near his mum.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have his phone number. Can you see if you can find\nCam\u2019s and ask him for Phil\u2019s number for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You want me to ask a guy I slept with last night\nfor one of his friends\u2019 phone numbers? Do you want me to break the guy\u2019s\nheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him it\u2019s a gay emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA <i>gay</i> emergency,\nhuh?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face flushed red, \u201cAt this point, I can\u2019t really deny\nanything anymore, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, this is not what I called you for, El.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gay. I\u2019m just- not straight. Bi, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find Cam\u2019s number. Tell him it\u2019s a bi emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you\u2019re so lucky to have me.\u201d</p><p>After they hung up the phone Dan spent another couple of\nawkward minutes hanging around the check-in desk, giving the lady behind it a\nnod that he hoped was reassuring and friendly.</p><p>Just before his standing around started going from \u2018weird\u2019\nto \u2018scary\u2019, Eleanor texted him. Just a string of numbers. Presumably Phil\u2019s\nphone number. Phil Lester\u2019s phone number.</p><p>What was he even supposed to say? What did you put in a\nfirst text to someone you\u2019d known for two years but had only really seen three\ntimes?</p><p><i>Hey, it\u2019s Dan. I\u2019m\nback at the hotel if you want to hang out now? Am in the lobby.</i></p><p>His finger hovered over the \u2018send\u2019 button, and after a\nglance at the clock \u2013 twenty past six \u2013 he pressed it.</p><p>The lady behind the desk was really starting to give him\nlooks now, so he moved to near the lifts, which was maybe even more suspicious.\nThankfully, a minute or two later, one of the lifts opened and Phil appeared,\nnow dressed in some casual jeans and a T shirt. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were your crafts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, I\u2019m a master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are. Want to go straight to the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it just so happens that I know of an exquisite Pizza\nHut around the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, really? How did you become acquainted with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh well, I just Google Maps-ed it a minute and a half ago.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>It was a short walk. Five minutes, maybe. Dan felt some\nweird sense of pride walking next to Phil, boasting with the cute guy he\u2019d\nmanaged to get to\u2026 take him on a date? He wasn\u2019t sure what this was, until\nfingertips touched his hand palm and fingers intertwined with his. He glanced\nto his side and the two boys made eye contact, grinning at each other, each\ncontent with what had just occurred between them.</p><p>Dan\u2019s secondary school had had a pizza hut right around the\ncorner, meaning he was very, very closely acquainted with how things worked in\nthere. Phil, who\u2019d been on a ballet diet most of his life, had only stepped\nfoot inside a Pizza Hut maybe three times, had no idea what was going on from the\nmoment he walked in.</p><p>\u201cThe salad bar is free?\u201d He asked quietly, \u201cDan,\u201d he did a\nlittle jog to catch up with the other, \u201cDan, it\u2019s free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. The bacon bits are vegan, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bacon bits?\u201d</p><p>Dan was enjoying being the one with more experience on\nsomething for once, albeit with the workings of a cheap pizza place.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to look at the menu, knowing his order by\nheart. Amusedly, he watched Phil study his options with his finger tracing the\nletters as he read them. \u201cIs this one any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, the pan? Sure. I\u2019m a classic fan though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll be adventurous and get a pan.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d ordered Dan got some more entertainment from\nwatching Phil squint at the salad bar options, carefully picking up some\ntomatoes and then loading up on bacon bits. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d He asked, by which\ntime it was already far too late to dump the whole lot back into the bowl.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re vegan. My friend who\u2019s vegan has them all the\ntime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Phil made the classic mistake of overloading on the salad\nbar, so he couldn\u2019t finish his pizza. Dan gladly made use of this by eating the\nlast 3 slices. </p><p>The boundaries had been moved, and for some reason instead\nof making it more awkward, as it had been before when they weren\u2019t sure where\nthe lines were drawn, they spoke more easily and fluently. Phil even opened up\nabout his childhood, and how he\u2019d started dancing.</p><p>Dan had to try his best to not stare at him fondly, leaning\nhis head on one hand, while he listened. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>It was a quarter to eight. They had exactly an hour and\nfifteen minutes to get Phil\u2019s stuff packed up and get him on the bus, yet the\nmoment they left Pizza Hut, they headed in the exact opposite direction of the\nhotel.</p><p>Their fingers were intertwined, hands swinging between them\nas they walked. </p><p>They got ice cream at a place Dan loved, sitting outside on\na freezing December night despite the odd looks they were getting. By the end\nof it Dan couldn\u2019t feel his tongue, but it was worth it to see the happy smile\non Phil\u2019s face, and the way his cheeks had gone red and rosy from the cold air.</p><p>Eventually they had to reluctantly make their way back to\nthe hotel. Hand in hand once again.</p><p>Dan watched him throw his things into the suitcase on the\nfloor and zip it up with the effortless movements of someone who\u2019d done this\nmany times before. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you next year?\u201d Dan asked. He felt hope and hurt\nburning in his heart at once.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here. I hope you will be, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if I can find the time to pop by.\u201d Dan said. A\nweak attempt at a joke while he felt like a small part of him had just been\nzipped up into a suitcase headed north.</p><p>Downstairs by the bus, the other dancers greeted Dan like a\nfriend with pats on the back and smiling nods. \u201cSee you next year, Dan.\u201d One of\nthem told him.</p><p>A fair assertion, or so Dan hoped.</p>",

His phone lit up, signalling a new Snap from Davis.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Summer was a gift from god.</p><p>After missing their November weekend together Dan and\nEleanor spent a whole week exploring Rome in early August, completely avoiding\nthe topics of love lives and university and focusing on sunshine and gelato and\nthe ancient history they were walking around in on their flipflops. They held\nhands the way they\u2019d done in primary school, before they hit puberty and girls\nand boys weren\u2019t supposed to do that kind of stuff anymore. Before they cared\nabout what anyone thought of their relationship.</p><p>Dan neglected to mention to her that on the last night, when\nshe went to the bathroom as they were having a couple of drinks at the hotel\nbar, an Irish boy slipped him a napkin with a string of numbers on it\naccompanied by the words, \u201cif you\u2019re not interested feel free to bin this, but\notherwise, text me\u201d. Dan shoved it in his pocket, where it stayed until he got\nback to his parents\u2019 house in London and he unpacked his suitcase. He stood\nwith the paper in his hand for a minute or so, and then another few minutes\nstaring at the new contact in his phone. </p><p>Sat cross-legged on the bed he carefully crafted a message.\nAs he was typing it took everything from his willpower not to close the app and\ngo to google. To just type in that one name that he\u2019d put into that bar so many\ntimes before. Instead, he resolutely tapped the \u2018send\u2019 button and then\nproceeded to put his phone under his pillow to leave it there for the next\ncouple of hours.</p><p>When Nicholas replied he was almost surprised. They spent\nthe next couple of weeks texting and although Dan had initially been sceptical,\nthe more he learnt about Nick, the more he felt that there might be something\nand he might not need to be stuck on his Christmas dates for the rest of his\nlife. </p><p>Nick was nice. Genuinely nice. He was a good listener, made\njokes at the right time, and had an intricate knowledge of all kinds of animals\nas he was studying to become a vet. Dan found himself looking forward to the\nevenings when Nick got home from placement and the two of them could Skype call\nbefore they went to bed. Long nights were spent lying on his back on the\ncarpet, feet propped up against the side of his desk, phone tucked comfortably\nbetween his shoulder and his ear. He could hear the Irish boy smile through the\nphone. </p><p>He liked Nick. He really did. But when in early October he\nasked him that dreaded question, \u201cso, what are we?\u201d, Dan couldn\u2019t stop his\nfight or flight response from kicking in. Unsure of whether he feared commitment\nto a boy or commitment to anyone at all, he broke it off. </p><p>From there on, things went downhill. Fast.</p><p>One of the boys Dan lived with dropped out, meaning they had\nto either find a new flatmate or a new place, and the others\u2019 half-hearted\nsearch for a house stressed him out. University was pulling on him like a ball\non a chain and the words danced before his eyes on the nights he tried to catch\nup with the stacks of work accumulating on his desk. Eleanor\u2019s ugly selfies\nsent over snapchat were only doing so much to put a smile on his face, their\neffects diminishing with every day.</p><p>Two weeks after Reuben had left, Dan sent in his student\nwithdrawal form.</p><p>Three days later, he found the courage to tell his parents,\nsat on Eleanor\u2019s bed with one hand in hers and the other hand clutching the\nphone held to his ear. Everything was falling apart, but the one constant he\ncould always count on was his best friend always being right by his side.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Dan moved back home hesitantly. His old bedroom felt too\nsmall for him and his hometown was full of eyes watching him, knowing he didn\u2019t\nbelong there anymore. </p><p>What did he actually want to do with his life? He had no\nidea, really. His new job at an electronics shop was not it though, that was\nfor damn sure. It had him drifting through the days, every week feeling like\nthe last, endless and exhausting. To pass the time he messed around with the\nproducts when he got bored, feeling professional when he pressed buttons on the\nDJ sets knowing what they did, and adjusting camera lenses with expert eyes. In\nthose moments he felt for a moment like he was on the right path, just not\nknowing where it would lead him yet.</p><p>In mid-December Dan used his first wages to buy one of those\nfancy cameras. He spent hours in his bedroom sat cross-legged on the floor\nadjusting settings and filming little test videos, the reality of his world\nforgotten for a precious while.</p><p>Four days before Christmas Dan planted the camera up on one\nof his book shelves, fixed his hair in the mirror for exactly two minutes\nlonger than necessary, and then pressed the record button. </p><p>He filmed his first video in one go, with rambling tangents\nand awkward pauses to edit out later, which he did the day after, when he got\nhome from work. He was tired. After a nine-hour day the last thing his eyes\nwanted to do was focus deeply on something for another couple of hours. One by\none his family members went to bed, the sounds of their bedroom doors closing\nreaching Dan even through his headphones. In the morning, when his alarm would\ngo off at half seven again, he\u2019d hate himself for this, but that felt well\nworth it when he clicked \u2018upload\u2019 and watched the bar load up to a 100%. It was\ntwo in the morning when his first ever YouTube video went live.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Dan and Eleanor had bought tickets for the ballet in early\nDecember almost out of habit. There had been no discussing it, just Eleanor\nasking if he\u2019d already bought them or if she should. On the day before\nChristmas Eve she picked him up in her car, blasting Mariah Carey so loud Dan\ncould hear it the moment he stepped out the front door. She was wearing a\nbeautiful silver dress and had her hair braided back so her elegant hoop\nearrings were clearly visible. He complimented her as he plopped down in the\npassenger seat of her Volkswagen. </p><p>He tried to play it cool, but it was difficult to do so when\nhe\u2019d been looking forward to this night for months. It felt on the verge of\npathetic, but his monotonous job left him with plenty of headspace to\ncontemplate all that could happen and might be in the future. He\u2019d lived this\nday and the next dozens of times over in his head stood behind the counter\nsmiling artificially at customers as he rang up their purchases. \u00a0</p><p>They knew their way around the theatre by now. They knew\nwhere to find the coat room, and the fact that it cost 50p per coat, and they\nknew the quickest route up to the balcony and the toilet closest to it. Dan ran\nhis hands over the balustrade as they walked to their spots. The place was\nstill fully lit, giving him a view of the seats and the stage below. Two little\ngirls were on stage in front of the curtains, doing pirouettes and falling out\nof them with big grins decorating their little faces. He stood and watched them\nfor a moment, until he felt Eleanor demonstratively lean over the railing next\nto him. \u201cYou excited?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d He said without tearing his gaze away from\nthe kids.</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to him at all since last year?\u201d </p><p>Dan shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t even have his number. I don\u2019t\nknow his last name or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought you had a somewhat regulated plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re both single by Christmas, we spend the night\ntogether. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole plan.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re a bit of a disaster, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He said. He sighed deeply, leaning further down\nuntil his chin came to rest on his hands. \u201cI\u2019ve given up trying to sort this\nout, I\u2019m just along for the ride now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, but without needing to look over Dan\nknew she was rolling her eyes at him. </p><p>They watched the girls dance until they were ushered off the\nstage and the lights started to dim. The hall had filled up quite a bit since\nthey\u2019d turned their back on the balcony, and they had to shuffle past grumbly\nchic people annoyed they had to move their legs to let them past. It was Dan and\nEl\u2019s third year. They were used to the rich people by now.</p><p>The lead dancers had all changed. He recognised the previous\nlead as one of the background dancers, along with a couple of others who\u2019d had\nbig roles the years before. Phil was nowhere to be found. Dan had a heavy\nfeeling in his stomach as he watched them float across the stage. Eleanor\nnoticed too, taking her best friend\u2019s hand in hers and squeezing it tightly.\nThey exchanged a short glance, but Dan couldn\u2019t bear looking her in the eyes\nfor too long, too embarrassed about his situation and the hope he\u2019d displayed\nbefore the show. She knew he\u2019d been excited for their meeting and Phil\u2019s not\nbeing there made him feel ashamed, naive almost. His eyes absentmindedly\nfollowed the ballerinas, not really taking anything in.</p><p>Eleanor kept a firm grip on his hand, pulling him downstairs\nto the bar and pushing a glass of champagne into his hand. She wasn\u2019t sure what\nto say either, clearly. Dan could see the radars in her head spin as she tried\nto come up with a way to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d </p><p>He saw Eleanor\u2019s eyes light up before he turned and faced\nthe person who\u2019d said his name.</p><p>Phil was wearing slacks and a button-down shirt, his hair\nneatly swept to one side. He looked older, more mature. Dan was glad Eleanor had\nmade him dress up that year, so he knew he looked good. He subconsciously\nreached up and tugged on his tie a bit as he looked the dancer up and down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d He managed to say.</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might not be here this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on the team anymore. Not as a dancer, at least.\nI\u2019ve taken up that coaching position like I told you I might last year, I\u2019m\nassistant coach now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s not that spectacular, I\u2019m not sure if it\ndeserves congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve done better for yourself than I have.\u201d Dan\nsaid. It was out there before he could stop himself, and the moment he\u2019d said\nit he was afraid he\u2019d enclosed too much information about his personal life.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me all about it after the show,\u201d Phil said, \u201cI\nhave to get back to the team now. I was just coming to say hi and make sure you\nknew I was here. Backdoor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d </p><p>He watched Phil leave before turning around to face Eleanor,\nwho had a smug look on her face. \u201cSee, it\u2019s all fine.\u201d She said.</p><p>\u201cYou say that now, but you were afraid he wouldn\u2019t be here\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She admitted. She touched her champagne glass to\nhis, \u201cCheers to another fun night for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd cheers for hopefully one for you. You deserve one.\u201d </p><p>He meant it. After Nicola cheated on her six months into\ntheir relationship she\u2019d stayed away from boys for a while, but a week earlier\nshe\u2019d said she might try and pull on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of December, for the\nfirst time in months. He watched her eye a guy standing behind them as she\nnodded and took a sip of her drink. \u201cI sure do.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help but break into a smile when he watched\nPhil approach. He was stopped a few times along the way to shake hands and\nreceive pats on the shoulder, but eventually he made it over and to Dan\u2019s\nsurprise he leaned in and kissed him right in front of everyone. \u201cAre you ready\nto go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, can you just leave?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s walk.\u201d</p><p>The moment they stepped out into the cold Dan glanced over\nto see if Phil would change his mind about walking, but he didn\u2019t. They both\nput up the collars on their coats and bowed their heads against the wind. Dan\nhad his hands shoved deep into his pockets until he felt Phil\u2019s fingers brush\nagainst his wrist. Wordlessly, their fingers intertwined and fell between their\ntwo bodies.</p><p>\u201cIt was a good performance.\u201d Dan said eventually.</p><p>He saw Phil nod from the corner of his eye, \u201cThey trained\ntheir little hearts out. The lead got sick three days ago, so this was the\nunderstudy performing. She\u2019d never had this big a role before and was so\nnervous, bless her.\u201d He smiled to himself.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start coaching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the start of the new schoolyear, this September. I\nstill dance too, just not on this team anymore. I\u2019ve stopped competing too, I\u2019m\njust doing it for fun on the side now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must\u2019ve been a transition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I struggled with it a bit. Still do, really. I miss\nit, but I know this is where I need to be and what I need to be doing.\u201d</p><p>Dan stayed quiet. His mind drifted to his own situation, how\nhe was far from where he needed to be. He bit his lip, face numb with the cold.</p><p>Phil squeezed his hand. The only comfort he could offer\nwithout asking too much about his life outside of their Christmas dates.</p><p>The hotel was a twenty-minute walk from the theatre, and\nwhen they finally stepped into the lobby Dan\u2019s whole body started stinging as\nthe warmth from inside hit him. Next to him, Phil rubbed his hands together and\nblew on them. His cheeks were bright red, shimmering in the bright lights. Dan\ncouldn\u2019t help remarking in his mind that he looked cute and kissable.</p><p>They took the lift up. Hand-in-hand once again, eyes shyly\nmeeting through their reflections in the mirror. The third time and still it\nfelt new and exciting.</p><p>There was only one big, king-sized bed in the room this\nyear. Phil\u2019s suitcase was on the floor by the desk with a couple of items\nstrewn over the chair. </p><p>\u201cSo, I have a suggestion. You can say no if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Dan said, raising his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI brought a really nice bath bomb. From Lush. The bath is\nfairly spacious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Phil grabbed him by his tie and pulled him in, their lips\ntouching together gently. </p><p>They got undressed as the bath ran in the other room. Phil\nwas still as toned and gorgeous as he had been the years before and Dan\u2019s\nfingers itched to reach out and touch him. He had to have patience. Soon\nenough, they\u2019d be bunched up in the bath, with no other choice but to touch\neach other.</p><p>The bath bomb fizzed and coloured the water a pale, glittery\nblue. Phil lined up the little hotel shampoos and soaps on the side, his\nmuscles flexing under his taut skin as he moved. Dan\u2019s eyes were glued to him,\nmesmerised. </p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d </p><p>Phil got in first, settling in comfortably before beckoning\nDan over. The latter was hesitant, trying to be elegant about it and almost\nslipping in the process. A small tidal wave splashed over the side of the bath\nas he steadied himself on the tap. Phil laughed. He was relaxed, with his head\nresting against the wall and his arms stretched out over the sides of the bath.\nThe hot water made Dan want to relax, but the situation was so foreign and new\nto him that he was struggling to keep his composure altogether and was happy\nenough when he finally settled down with his knees pulled into his chest.</p><p>The bath water being blue obscured most areas Dan was\ninsecure about from sight, and soon enough he was relaxing his legs, stretching\nthem out alongside Phil\u2019s. \u201cSo, how was your year?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>He was good at asking those questions that could be answered\nby pretty much anything, leaving the decision as to where to draw the line with\nDan once again. \u201cGood,\u201d the latter said hesitantly, \u201cit was a ride.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed, \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m- I was in university before. I dropped out.\u201d Phil\ndidn\u2019t seem to judge him, just nodding encouragingly for Dan to go on. \u201cSo, I\nwork in a store now. Trying to, you know, sort out my life and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do when you\u2019re older?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, die maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s valid. But before that?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know, honestly.\u201d</p><p>Phil decided not to press anymore, and Dan quickly took the\nopportunity to ask about his year.</p><p>\u201cIt was good. I went on my last Europe tour as a member of\nthe team instead of a coach, so that was a bit bittersweet. I\u2019m excited to\ncoach though. Oh, I finally moved out, too. Was about time.\u201d He laughed, the\nwater moving off him in little waves.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Dan put on his underwear before he dried any other part of\nhis body. Phil had no such inclination, stood in the middle of the hotel room\nstark-naked while drying his hair. The bed looked cosy and inviting, and\nalthough the room was warm enough Dan longed to curl up under the covers for a\nwhile.</p><p>Wearing just his pants he crawled into bed and pulled the\nduvet up to his chin. While he waited for the other to finish up, he grabbed\nthe remote control off the bedside table and turned the TV on to a radio\nstation that was playing Christmas songs. The only thing this atmosphere needed\nto be perfect was a little scented candle, but Dan would settle for this.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ve been waiting pretty much all year to make out with\nyou. Do you mind doing that for a while before we decide what to do with the\nrest of our night?\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned, \u201cI think I\u2019m alright with that.\u201d</p><p>Phil slipped under the covers with him and pushed him down\nonto his back. Dan laced his fingers through Phil\u2019s mildly damp hair as they\nkissed. Maybe his flight response to Nicholas\u2019 question had had less to do with\nthe question of commitment to either a boy or anyone, and more to do with the\nfact that he was already committed to something. To a 24 hours period just\nbefore Christmas.</p><p>Phil\u2019s hands were a bit cold roaming his sides. They sent\nshivers down his spine, but he did nothing to stop them. </p><p>Soon enough they were both warmed up and their almost naked\nbodies moved together, arousal already showing. Every time Phil\u2019s hips touched\nagainst Dan\u2019s thigh it sent a pleasant shiver to his dick, his fingers\ntightening against Phil\u2019s hair and skin. It was pretty clear that \u2018what they\nwould be doing with the rest of their night\u2019 wasn\u2019t much of a question, really.\nWith the way hands and mouths were moving this was only going in one direction.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips had trailed off, going from Dan\u2019s neck to his\nchest and down to his belly. Looking down at him Dan watched the trail of faint\nhickeys grace down from his throat to the waistband of his boxers. Phil had\nalready moved on, his breath ghosting over the bulge in the fabric and his\nhands moving up Dan\u2019s thighs with confidence. </p><p>Although one part of his brain was focused solely on the\nfact that <i>a very attractive boy was about\nto give him a blowjob</i>, the other part of him couldn\u2019t help but think about\nwhat would happen after. The memory of last year was still fresh in his mind to\nput a slight damper on his excitement. He wanted to try again. The thought of\nactually having sex with Phil made his whole body tingle, but it was also\nscary. It was like losing his virginity all over again, where he had no idea\nwhat he was doing, and he just had to surrender all control to another, more\nexperienced party.</p><p>For a few minutes though, Dan\u2019s mind was completely taken\noff anything he could possibly worry about as Phil pulled down his underwear\nand put his mouth on him. He started by teasing along the shaft with his\ntongue, one hand holding him firmly by the base and the other with fingertips\nbarely grazing along his balls. Dan opened his eyes for a moment, glancing down\nat the sight below him. A soft sound escaped from the back of his throat before\nhis eyes closed again.</p><p>Phil was an expert. His mouth and hands moved just right,\nand much sooner than he wanted to Dan had to nudge him off to stop him from\nfinishing him off. \u201cCan we try last year again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to?\u201d Phil sat up on his heels. He\nneeded no further explanation; he knew what Dan meant.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I want to try, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say something stupid, but as it didn\u2019t work\nlast time, are you sure you really want it? Don\u2019t do it for me, I\u2019m doing\nperfectly fine without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, yes, I mean- I really want it. I do. I\u2019m just scared of\nthe pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go very slow. The moment it doesn\u2019t feel nice you give\nme a shout and I stop or take a step back, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Dan breathed.</p><p>The two of them kicked off their boxers, Dan pulling Phil\nback down for a quick kiss, but neither of them had much patience for a make\nout session knowing what was on the table now.</p><p>Phil had lube at the ready, spreading it on his fingers and\npressing soft butterfly kisses to Dan\u2019s abdomen as his hand moved down. Dan\nclosed his eyes. He felt more vulnerable than he ever had before. He was\nclutching at the sheets, but Phil carefully took one of his hands in his and\nsaid in a hushed tone, \u201cSqueeze my hand. Let me know if I do something wrong.\u201d</p><p>He kissed Dan\u2019s thigh while he pushed a finger in. Dan made\na sound and Phil\u2019s movements stilled, but he squeezed his hand, urging him to\ngo on. </p><p>He took it slow. Like he promised. He gave Dan time to\nadjust before putting a second finger in, and eventually let go of Dan\u2019s hand\nto tease his dick a bit, moving up and down in excruciatingly slow strokes. His\nwhole body was on fire, feelings things he\u2019d never felt before.</p><p>Eventually, after what felt like forever, Phil called him\nback to attention by pulling his fingers out and putting both hands on his\nhips, \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re well enough prepared, if you\u2019re still up for\nit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes followed Phil as he hopped off the bed and got a\ncondom from his suitcase. He tore open the wrapper and rolled the condom onto\nhimself with practised fingers, putting some extra lube on himself after. The\nactions of someone who\u2019d done this before and knew the pitfalls.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded. His throat was slightly closed up with nerves,\nbut as Phil settled in between his legs he felt no urge to move away. Rather,\nhe felt an impatient pull in his stomach, his dick twitching at the thought of\nwhat was about to happen. </p><p>The moment Phil\u2019s tip grazed his entrance Dan closed his\neyes and let his head fall back. He focused on relaxing, aided by Phil\u2019s\nsoothing hand on his side, rubbing circled into his skin with his thumb. Being\nfilled up felt weird, and it just kept coming until finally he felt Phil bottom\nout. He was given a few moments to adjust, catch his breath, which he took\nreluctantly. He wanted to move on. Desperate already even though he only had to\nwait a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d He muttered hoarsely.</p><p>Phil started slow. A practice run.</p><p>His hands were firmly holding on to Dan\u2019s hips as he started\nspeeding up little by little. Every time his hips touched against Dan and he\nwas fully filled up, Dan let out a shaky breath. He had no idea how long Phil\nwas going to last, but he didn\u2019t think he had a lot of time in him. His dick\nwas aching to be touched but he knew he\u2019d come very quickly if he gave into the\nurge.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Phil asked. The question came out\nbreathily, the words clearly an effort to utter.</p><p>\u201cGood. Too good, maybe.\u201d Phil gave him a questioning look,\nbut Dan took a few seconds to recover before he continued, \u201cI\u2019m getting close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d There was nothing in him that could muster up\neven the slightest bit of politeness. Phil didn\u2019t need any. His hand reached down,\nand fingers wrapped firmly around him. It only took a few firm strokes in time\nwith his hips to make Dan emit a desperate little sound and come all over his\nown belly. Phil followed shortly after, pushed over the edge by Dan\u2019s muscles\ncontracting around him.</p><p>Dan flinched when Phil pulled out. He felt overstimulated\nand sore, but completely satisfied. It was a tired, content kind of\nsatisfaction, making him want to finally curl up and go to sleep. \u201cWhat time is\nit?\u201d He whispered, following Phil\u2019s movements as the other went into the\nbathroom through half-closed eyes. </p><p>\u201cNearing half eleven.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed as much as his sleepy state allowed him to and\nclosed his eyes fully, \u201cI usually don\u2019t go to sleep for another two hours or\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go to sleep now, if you want.\u201d Phil\u2019s voice came\nfrom the other room.</p><p>\u201cHmm, up to you.\u201d</p><p>Phil returned, putting his underwear back on and slipping\nback under the covers with Dan, \u201cIf we go to sleep now we\u2019ll have loads of time\ntogether tomorrow. I\u2019m not leaving till the evening. If you want that, of\ncourse.\u201d</p><p>That woke Dan up. He opened his eyes and raised his head,\nbut Phil had turned the light off and the room was dark. \u201cOf course I want\nthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay. Sleep now, then. We\u2019ll have a lot of time\ntomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Dan turned around, picking his underwear off the floor and\nwiggling into them under the duvet. When he was done, Phil crawled up beside\nhim and wrapped his arms around him from behind. \u201cThis okay?\u201d He asked. His\nwarm breath stroked along Dan\u2019s neck, making his skin raise into goosebumps.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He whispered back.</p><p>He fell asleep with Phil\u2019s arms tightly wrapped around him,\nsoothed by his even breathing against his skin.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>When Dan woke up Phil was still fast asleep. He snuck out\nfrom under his arm and tiptoed to the bathroom, where it still smelt like fruit\nand mint or whatever the bath bomb had been. After peeing Dan put a bit of\nPhil\u2019s toothpaste in his mouth and sloshed it around for a bit; it would have\nto do. </p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d He was greeted by Phil, lying on his back with\none arm thrown over his face to protect his eyes from the sunlight, when he\nwalked back into the bedroom. </p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to order some room service and chill in bed while we\neat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d He leant down and kissed the top of Phil\u2019s\nhead without really thinking, not realising himself until he met the other\u2019s\neyes. Phil pulled him down with a hand on the back of his neck and pecked his\nlips.</p><p>They ordered room service on the hotel website, Dan getting\npancakes and Phil some vegan waffles. While they waited for it to arrive Dan\ngot dressed, splashing some water in his face and attempting to bring his hair\nto some kind of order. He startled when he felt hands touching his belly. Phil\nhad appeared behind him, wrapping his arms around Dan\u2019s waist and now resting\nhis chin on his shoulder. \u201cWhat do you want to do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything. I wouldn\u2019t mind staying in and just hanging out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, just talking, getting to know each other?\u201d Dan asked.\nIt was meant as a joke, but when Phil shrugged he nodded, \u201cAlright, sure.\u201d</p><p>They ate their breakfast sat cross-legged on the big double\nbed. Soft Christmas music played on the TV as they started chatting, carefully\nat first but quickly becoming more free in their questions and stories. </p><p>In the middle of one of his stories Phil suddenly called his\ndad \u2018Mr Lester\u2019, bringing the hand that was just about to put a bite of pancake\ninto Dan\u2019s mouth to an abrupt halt. Phil hadn\u2019t noticed, his lively\nstorytelling not stuttering for even a second. </p><p>But Dan had a name.</p><p>He had a full name to plug into the Google search bar rather\nthan just the name of the ballet company. He wasn\u2019t sure whether to try his\nabsolute hardest to forget it as soon as possible, or whether to save it to his\nlong-term memory and tattoo it onto his brain. </p><p>\u2013</p><p>At about half two, when Phil was lying flat on his back with\nDan\u2019s head resting on his belly, both staring at the ceiling and half at the\nother\u2019s hands gesturing in the air as they spoke, Dan\u2019s phone started ringing.\nThey both raised their heads, disturbed.</p><p>It was Eleanor. A picture of her and Dan as little kids in a\nplaypark illuminated the screen.</p><p>\u201cEl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny-boy, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Dan glanced over to the bed, where Phil had grabbed\nhis own phone and was scrolling through some missed messages.</p><p>\u201cI told your mum you\u2019re hanging out with a mate, but I can\u2019t\nhold her off forever.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Christmas crafts.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realised the time.\u201d </p><p>It was quiet on the other end for a moment, \u201cBring him.\u201d She\nsaid finally.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Dan, bring him.\u201d</p><p>It was a weird crossroad to be at. He had 24 hours with\nPhil, but he also had a best friend and a mum waiting for their Christmas\ntradition, and he\u2019d already let them down by being late. Last year in November\nhe\u2019d been at the same fork in the road, he realised, and he\u2019d made the wrong\ndecision then. He\u2019d chosen Rosie over Eleanor and he still hated himself for\nthat. It was clear-cut, really.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for forgetting the time, I\u2019ll be over as soon as\nI can. Get the crafts ready, I\u2019m feeling the creative juices flowing.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor laughed, the sound sending a relieved warmth to\nDan\u2019s heart. \u201cAlright, alright. See you soon. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d When Dan turned back to the bed he wasn\u2019t\nsure how to break the news. He bit his lip and sat down, awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a Christmas tradition with my mum and my best\nfriend. It\u2019s bad enough that I forgot about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Phil nodded. His smile said that he meant it,\n\u201cMy bus leaves at ten, we can have dinner together if you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me at the hotel entrance at seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, all good. Have a good day, Dan.\u201d</p><p>Dan bit the inside of his cheek. This was the right thing to\ndo, and he was looking forward to crafts, as he did each year, but this still\nfelt bittersweet. </p><p>When Phil opened his arms he happily fell into them, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry.\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about it. The day after is not\nusually a part of our tradition, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it would\u2019ve been nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it would\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Eleanor hugged him when he came in. Her arms were familiar\nand welcoming, and decidedly not upset with him. \u201cHow was your day, huh?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, \u201cMost excellent, thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear all about it. As soon as we\u2019re not with your\nmum anymore, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? You know about my thing, I want to hear\nabout your night.\u201d She winked at him and spun on her heel, walking to the\nliving room. \u201cEleanor, you bitch, you can\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, there you are! Did you have a good time with your\nfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, it was lovely.\u201d Dan said, doing his best to hide\nthe grin on his face that was mirrored by his best friend to his left. </p><p>Eleanor, always right beside him.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Scrolling was a bit more difficult than usual after the Glue\nAccident, but Eleanor managed it as she showed Dan Facebook pictures of a boy\nwith blonde curls and a toned dancer\u2019s body. They\u2019d done two hours of crafts\nwith Dan\u2019s mum and then quickly retreated to Dan\u2019s room with two steaming mugs\nof hot chocolate, now stood forgotten on the bedside table. </p><p>Cam seemed nice enough, but it was clear that Eleanor didn\u2019t\ncare much for his niceness: he\u2019d given her his number at the end of the night,\nbut when Dan asked her if she\u2019d put it into her phone she said she didn\u2019t even\nremember where she put the note. The night had but a content grin on her face\nthat was enough for now. A reminder that she still had it and that Nicola was a\nstupid idiot who was missing out, like Dan had been telling her for the past\ncouple of months.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about you? Why were you still with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here all day. Not leaving till nine tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you were going to spend the day with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still here?\u201d With every word she was sitting up a bit\nstraighter.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBros before hoes. Mums before- I don\u2019t know- bums? You know\nwhat I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, crafts over. Go back to him, God. Your mum and I will\nstill be here tonight and tomorrow and all the time after that.\u201d</p><p>Dan was quiet for a moment. \u201cEl,\u201d He said then, softly, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry about last November.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to explain what he meant. She gave him a sad\nsmile and a playful push against the shoulder that meant more than it led on,\n\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really am. I shouldn\u2019t have prioritised Rosie over you,\nand that was so fucking dumb of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you were an idiot. Still are, really.\u201d Eleanor\nagreed.</p><p>Dan grinned, \u201cYeah, alright, alright, calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve it though.\u201d She said, laughing along. Her hand,\nstill on his shoulder, shook him gently, \u201cGo. It\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll hang out tonight\nand watch Home Alone. After he\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You came to crafts, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wanted to miss it.\u201d He scrambled to his\nfeet and kissed the top of her head. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too, idiot.\u201d She shook her head at him as he left\nthe room.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>It was six o\u2019clock when he made it into the hotel lobby and\nthe realisation that he had no way of getting upstairs or contacting Phil to\nlet him in. He stood, probably suspiciously, next to the check-in desk for just\na little too long, before his stupid foggy brain finally thought of something\nto do.</p><p>\u201cEl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you calling me? Go have sex or something.\u201d She\nwhispered the last part, probably still at his house, near his mum.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have his phone number. Can you see if you can find\nCam\u2019s and ask him for Phil\u2019s number for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You want me to ask a guy I slept with last night\nfor one of his friends\u2019 phone numbers? Do you want me to break the guy\u2019s\nheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him it\u2019s a gay emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA <i>gay</i> emergency,\nhuh?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face flushed red, \u201cAt this point, I can\u2019t really deny\nanything anymore, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, this is not what I called you for, El.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gay. I\u2019m just- not straight. Bi, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find Cam\u2019s number. Tell him it\u2019s a bi emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you\u2019re so lucky to have me.\u201d</p><p>After they hung up the phone Dan spent another couple of\nawkward minutes hanging around the check-in desk, giving the lady behind it a\nnod that he hoped was reassuring and friendly.</p><p>Just before his standing around started going from \u2018weird\u2019\nto \u2018scary\u2019, Eleanor texted him. Just a string of numbers. Presumably Phil\u2019s\nphone number. Phil Lester\u2019s phone number.</p><p>What was he even supposed to say? What did you put in a\nfirst text to someone you\u2019d known for two years but had only really seen three\ntimes?</p><p><i>Hey, it\u2019s Dan. I\u2019m\nback at the hotel if you want to hang out now? Am in the lobby.</i></p><p>His finger hovered over the \u2018send\u2019 button, and after a\nglance at the clock \u2013 twenty past six \u2013 he pressed it.</p><p>The lady behind the desk was really starting to give him\nlooks now, so he moved to near the lifts, which was maybe even more suspicious.\nThankfully, a minute or two later, one of the lifts opened and Phil appeared,\nnow dressed in some casual jeans and a T shirt. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were your crafts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, I\u2019m a master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are. Want to go straight to the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it just so happens that I know of an exquisite Pizza\nHut around the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, really? How did you become acquainted with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh well, I just Google Maps-ed it a minute and a half ago.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>It was a short walk. Five minutes, maybe. Dan felt some\nweird sense of pride walking next to Phil, boasting with the cute guy he\u2019d\nmanaged to get to\u2026 take him on a date? He wasn\u2019t sure what this was, until\nfingertips touched his hand palm and fingers intertwined with his. He glanced\nto his side and the two boys made eye contact, grinning at each other, each\ncontent with what had just occurred between them.</p><p>Dan\u2019s secondary school had had a pizza hut right around the\ncorner, meaning he was very, very closely acquainted with how things worked in\nthere. Phil, who\u2019d been on a ballet diet most of his life, had only stepped\nfoot inside a Pizza Hut maybe three times, had no idea what was going on from the\nmoment he walked in.</p><p>\u201cThe salad bar is free?\u201d He asked quietly, \u201cDan,\u201d he did a\nlittle jog to catch up with the other, \u201cDan, it\u2019s free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. The bacon bits are vegan, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bacon bits?\u201d</p><p>Dan was enjoying being the one with more experience on\nsomething for once, albeit with the workings of a cheap pizza place.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to look at the menu, knowing his order by\nheart. Amusedly, he watched Phil study his options with his finger tracing the\nletters as he read them. \u201cIs this one any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, the pan? Sure. I\u2019m a classic fan though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll be adventurous and get a pan.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d ordered Dan got some more entertainment from\nwatching Phil squint at the salad bar options, carefully picking up some\ntomatoes and then loading up on bacon bits. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d He asked, by which\ntime it was already far too late to dump the whole lot back into the bowl.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re vegan. My friend who\u2019s vegan has them all the\ntime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Phil made the classic mistake of overloading on the salad\nbar, so he couldn\u2019t finish his pizza. Dan gladly made use of this by eating the\nlast 3 slices. </p><p>The boundaries had been moved, and for some reason instead\nof making it more awkward, as it had been before when they weren\u2019t sure where\nthe lines were drawn, they spoke more easily and fluently. Phil even opened up\nabout his childhood, and how he\u2019d started dancing.</p><p>Dan had to try his best to not stare at him fondly, leaning\nhis head on one hand, while he listened. </p><p>\u2013</p><p>It was a quarter to eight. They had exactly an hour and\nfifteen minutes to get Phil\u2019s stuff packed up and get him on the bus, yet the\nmoment they left Pizza Hut, they headed in the exact opposite direction of the\nhotel.</p><p>Their fingers were intertwined, hands swinging between them\nas they walked. </p><p>They got ice cream at a place Dan loved, sitting outside on\na freezing December night despite the odd looks they were getting. By the end\nof it Dan couldn\u2019t feel his tongue, but it was worth it to see the happy smile\non Phil\u2019s face, and the way his cheeks had gone red and rosy from the cold air.</p><p>Eventually they had to reluctantly make their way back to\nthe hotel. Hand in hand once again.</p><p>Dan watched him throw his things into the suitcase on the\nfloor and zip it up with the effortless movements of someone who\u2019d done this\nmany times before. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you next year?\u201d Dan asked. He felt hope and hurt\nburning in his heart at once.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here. I hope you will be, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if I can find the time to pop by.\u201d Dan said. A\nweak attempt at a joke while he felt like a small part of him had just been\nzipped up into a suitcase headed north.</p><p>Downstairs by the bus, the other dancers greeted Dan like a\nfriend with pats on the back and smiling nods. \u201cSee you next year, Dan.\u201d One of\nthem told him.</p><p>A fair assertion, or so Dan hoped.</p>",

He tried to avoid running into her, sometimes going as\nfar as skipping dinner because she was sat in the kitchen, until he no longer\nfelt his phone burning in his pocket watching her tending to her pans at the\nstove. Until he no longer had the pressing urge to get out of town every chance\nhe got, visiting Eleanor on the weekly. </p><p>\u2013</p><p>Final exams rolled in way too fast and left him feeling\nwholly unprepared. No matter how many study dates and trips to the library he\nset up, it never seemed to be enough. Law books were big and heavy, pulling on\nhim with every step that brought him closer to the exam halls. Eleanor, whose\nexams didn\u2019t start until the day after his, stayed with him and made him a full\nfry for breakfast the morning before his first test. It was her way of trying\nto offer her support when she knew that as a neurosciences student she was\ncompletely useless when it came to helping him study. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Although he liked to think he was fully over Rosie by May,\nit still gave him some sort of satisfaction when Eleanor gave a resolute \u201cyes\u201d\nto his ex\u2019s polite \u201cyou alright?\u201d as they sat at the kitchen table. </p><p>He wondered how she would greet Phil if she knew the ins and\nouts of their agreement. His phone lit up, signalling a new Snap from Davis.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Summer was a gift from god.</p><p>After missing their November weekend together Dan and\nEleanor spent a whole week exploring Rome in early August, completely avoiding\nthe topics of love lives and university and focusing on sunshine and gelato and\nthe ancient history they were walking around in on their flipflops. They held\nhands the way they\u2019d done in primary school, before they hit puberty and girls\nand boys weren\u2019t supposed to do that kind of stuff anymore. Before they cared\nabout what anyone thought of their relationship.</p><p>Dan neglected to mention to her that on the last night, when\nshe went to the bathroom as they were having a couple of drinks at the hotel\nbar, an Irish boy slipped him a napkin with a string of numbers on it\naccompanied by the words, \u201cif you\u2019re not interested feel free to bin this, but\notherwise, text me\u201d. Dan shoved it in his pocket, where it stayed until he got\nback to his parents\u2019 house in London and he unpacked his suitcase. He stood\nwith the paper in his hand for a minute or so, and then another few minutes\nstaring at the new contact in his phone. </p><p>Sat cross-legged on the bed he carefully crafted a message.\nAs he was typing it took everything from his willpower not to close the app and\ngo to google. To just type in that one name that he\u2019d put into that bar so many\ntimes before. Instead, he resolutely tapped the \u2018send\u2019 button and then\nproceeded to put his phone under his pillow to leave it there for the next\ncouple of hours.</p><p>When Nicholas replied he was almost surprised. They spent\nthe next couple of weeks texting and although Dan had initially been sceptical,\nthe more he learnt about Nick, the more he felt that there might be something\nand he might not need to be stuck on his Christmas dates for the rest of his\nlife. </p><p>Nick was nice. Genuinely nice. He was a good listener, made\njokes at the right time, and had an intricate knowledge of all kinds of animals\nas he was studying to become a vet. Dan found himself looking forward to the\nevenings when Nick got home from placement and the two of them could Skype call\nbefore they went to bed. Long nights were spent lying on his back on the\ncarpet, feet propped up against the side of his desk, phone tucked comfortably\nbetween his shoulder and his ear. He could hear the Irish boy smile through the\nphone. </p><p>He liked Nick. He really did. But when in early October he\nasked him that dreaded question, \u201cso, what are we?\u201d, Dan couldn\u2019t stop his\nfight or flight response from kicking in. Unsure of whether he feared commitment\nto a boy or commitment to anyone at all, he broke it off. </p><p>From there on, things went downhill. Fast.</p><p>One of the boys Dan lived with dropped out, meaning they had\nto either find a new flatmate or a new place, and the others\u2019 half-hearted\nsearch for a house stressed him out. University was pulling on him like a ball\non a chain and the words danced before his eyes on the nights he tried to catch\nup with the stacks of work accumulating on his desk. Eleanor\u2019s ugly selfies\nsent over snapchat were only doing so much to put a smile on his face, their\neffects diminishing with every day.</p><p>Two weeks after Reuben had left, Dan sent in his student\nwithdrawal form.</p><p>Three days later, he found the courage to tell his parents,\nsat on Eleanor\u2019s bed with one hand in hers and the other hand clutching the\nphone held to his ear. Everything was falling apart, but the one constant he\ncould always count on was his best friend always being right by his side.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Dan moved back home hesitantly. His old bedroom felt too\nsmall for him and his hometown was full of eyes watching him, knowing he didn\u2019t\nbelong there anymore. </p><p>What did he actually want to do with his life? He had no\nidea, really. His new job at an electronics shop was not it though, that was\nfor damn sure. It had him drifting through the days, every week feeling like\nthe last, endless and exhausting. To pass the time he messed around with the\nproducts when he got bored, feeling professional when he pressed buttons on the\nDJ sets knowing what they did, and adjusting camera lenses with expert eyes. In\nthose moments he felt for a moment like he was on the right path, just not\nknowing where it would lead him yet.</p><p>In mid-December Dan used his first wages to buy one of those\nfancy cameras. He spent hours in his bedroom sat cross-legged on the floor\nadjusting settings and filming little test videos, the reality of his world\nforgotten for a precious while.</p><p>Four days before Christmas Dan planted the camera up on one\nof his book shelves, fixed his hair in the mirror for exactly two minutes\nlonger than necessary, and then pressed the record button. </p><p>He filmed his first video in one go, with rambling tangents\nand awkward pauses to edit out later, which he did the day after, when he got\nhome from work. He was tired. After a nine-hour day the last thing his eyes\nwanted to do was focus deeply on something for another couple of hours. One by\none his family members went to bed, the sounds of their bedroom doors closing\nreaching Dan even through his headphones. In the morning, when his alarm would\ngo off at half seven again, he\u2019d hate himself for this, but that felt well\nworth it when he clicked \u2018upload\u2019 and watched the bar load up to a 100%. It was\ntwo in the morning when his first ever YouTube video went live.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Dan and Eleanor had bought tickets for the ballet in early\nDecember almost out of habit. There had been no discussing it, just Eleanor\nasking if he\u2019d already bought them or if she should. On the day before\nChristmas Eve she picked him up in her car, blasting Mariah Carey so loud Dan\ncould hear it the moment he stepped out the front door. She was wearing a\nbeautiful silver dress and had her hair braided back so her elegant hoop\nearrings were clearly visible. He complimented her as he plopped down in the\npassenger seat of her Volkswagen. </p><p>He tried to play it cool, but it was difficult to do so when\nhe\u2019d been looking forward to this night for months. It felt on the verge of\npathetic, but his monotonous job left him with plenty of headspace to\ncontemplate all that could happen and might be in the future. He\u2019d lived this\nday and the next dozens of times over in his head stood behind the counter\nsmiling artificially at customers as he rang up their purchases. \u00a0</p><p>They knew their way around the theatre by now. They knew\nwhere to find the coat room, and the fact that it cost 50p per coat, and they\nknew the quickest route up to the balcony and the toilet closest to it. Dan ran\nhis hands over the balustrade as they walked to their spots. The place was\nstill fully lit, giving him a view of the seats and the stage below. Two little\ngirls were on stage in front of the curtains, doing pirouettes and falling out\nof them with big grins decorating their little faces. He stood and watched them\nfor a moment, until he felt Eleanor demonstratively lean over the railing next\nto him. \u201cYou excited?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d He said without tearing his gaze away from\nthe kids.</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to him at all since last year?\u201d </p><p>Dan shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t even have his number. I don\u2019t\nknow his last name or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought you had a somewhat regulated plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re both single by Christmas, we spend the night\ntogether. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole plan.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re a bit of a disaster, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He said. He sighed deeply, leaning further down\nuntil his chin came to rest on his hands. \u201cI\u2019ve given up trying to sort this\nout, I\u2019m just along for the ride now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, but without needing to look over Dan\nknew she was rolling her eyes at him. </p><p>They watched the girls dance until they were ushered off the\nstage and the lights started to dim. The hall had filled up quite a bit since\nthey\u2019d turned their back on the balcony, and they had to shuffle past grumbly\nchic people annoyed they had to move their legs to let them past. It was Dan and\nEl\u2019s third year. They were used to the rich people by now.</p><p>The lead dancers had all changed. He recognised the previous\nlead as one of the background dancers, along with a couple of others who\u2019d had\nbig roles the years before. Phil was nowhere to be found. Dan had a heavy\nfeeling in his stomach as he watched them float across the stage. Eleanor\nnoticed too, taking her best friend\u2019s hand in hers and squeezing it tightly.\nThey exchanged a short glance, but Dan couldn\u2019t bear looking her in the eyes\nfor too long, too embarrassed about his situation and the hope he\u2019d displayed\nbefore the show. She knew he\u2019d been excited for their meeting and Phil\u2019s not\nbeing there made him feel ashamed, naive almost. His eyes absentmindedly\nfollowed the ballerinas, not really taking anything in.</p><p>Eleanor kept a firm grip on his hand, pulling him downstairs\nto the bar and pushing a glass of champagne into his hand. She wasn\u2019t sure what\nto say either, clearly. Dan could see the radars in her head spin as she tried\nto come up with a way to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d </p><p>He saw Eleanor\u2019s eyes light up before he turned and faced\nthe person who\u2019d said his name.</p><p>Phil was wearing slacks and a button-down shirt, his hair\nneatly swept to one side. He looked older, more mature. Dan was glad Eleanor had\nmade him dress up that year, so he knew he looked good. He subconsciously\nreached up and tugged on his tie a bit as he looked the dancer up and down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d He managed to say.</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might not be here this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on the team anymore. Not as a dancer, at least.\nI\u2019ve taken up that coaching position like I told you I might last year, I\u2019m\nassistant coach now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s not that spectacular, I\u2019m not sure if it\ndeserves congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve done better for yourself than I have.\u201d Dan\nsaid. It was out there before he could stop himself, and the moment he\u2019d said\nit he was afraid he\u2019d enclosed too much information about his personal life.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me all about it after the show,\u201d Phil said, \u201cI\nhave to get back to the team now. I was just coming to say hi and make sure you\nknew I was here. Backdoor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d </p><p>He watched Phil leave before turning around to face Eleanor,\nwho had a smug look on her face. \u201cSee, it\u2019s all fine.\u201d She said.</p><p>\u201cYou say that now, but you were afraid he wouldn\u2019t be here\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She admitted. She touched her champagne glass to\nhis, \u201cCheers to another fun night for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd cheers for hopefully one for you. You deserve one.\u201d </p><p>He meant it. After Nicola cheated on her six months into\ntheir relationship she\u2019d stayed away from boys for a while, but a week earlier\nshe\u2019d said she might try and pull on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of December, for the\nfirst time in months. He watched her eye a guy standing behind them as she\nnodded and took a sip of her drink. \u201cI sure do.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help but break into a smile when he watched\nPhil approach. He was stopped a few times along the way to shake hands and\nreceive pats on the shoulder, but eventually he made it over and to Dan\u2019s\nsurprise he leaned in and kissed him right in front of everyone. \u201cAre you ready\nto go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, can you just leave?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s walk.\u201d</p><p>The moment they stepped out into the cold Dan glanced over\nto see if Phil would change his mind about walking, but he didn\u2019t. They both\nput up the collars on their coats and bowed their heads against the wind. Dan\nhad his hands shoved deep into his pockets until he felt Phil\u2019s fingers brush\nagainst his wrist. Wordlessly, their fingers intertwined and fell between their\ntwo bodies.</p><p>\u201cIt was a good performance.\u201d Dan said eventually.</p><p>He saw Phil nod from the corner of his eye, \u201cThey trained\ntheir little hearts out. The lead got sick three days ago, so this was the\nunderstudy performing. She\u2019d never had this big a role before and was so\nnervous, bless her.\u201d He smiled to himself.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start coaching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the start of the new schoolyear, this September. I\nstill dance too, just not on this team anymore. I\u2019ve stopped competing too, I\u2019m\njust doing it for fun on the side now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must\u2019ve been a transition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I struggled with it a bit. Still do, really. I miss\nit, but I know this is where I need to be and what I need to be doing.\u201d</p><p>Dan stayed quiet. His mind drifted to his own situation, how\nhe was far from where he needed to be. He bit his lip, face numb with the cold.</p><p>Phil squeezed his hand. The only comfort he could offer\nwithout asking too much about his life outside of their Christmas dates.</p><p>The hotel was a twenty-minute walk from the theatre, and\nwhen they finally stepped into the lobby Dan\u2019s whole body started stinging as\nthe warmth from inside hit him. Next to him, Phil rubbed his hands together and\nblew on them. His cheeks were bright red, shimmering in the bright lights. Dan\ncouldn\u2019t help remarking in his mind that he looked cute and kissable.</p><p>They took the lift up. Hand-in-hand once again, eyes shyly\nmeeting through their reflections in the mirror. The third time and still it\nfelt new and exciting.</p><p>There was only one big, king-sized bed in the room this\nyear. Phil\u2019s suitcase was on the floor by the desk with a couple of items\nstrewn over the chair. </p><p>\u201cSo, I have a suggestion. You can say no if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Dan said, raising his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI brought a really nice bath bomb. From Lush. The bath is\nfairly spacious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Phil grabbed him by his tie and pulled him in, their lips\ntouching together gently. </p><p>They got undressed as the bath ran in the other room. Phil\nwas still as toned and gorgeous as he had been the years before and Dan\u2019s\nfingers itched to reach out and touch him. He had to have patience. Soon\nenough, they\u2019d be bunched up in the bath, with no other choice but to touch\neach other.</p><p>The bath bomb fizzed and coloured the water a pale, glittery\nblue. Phil lined up the little hotel shampoos and soaps on the side, his\nmuscles flexing under his taut skin as he moved. Dan\u2019s eyes were glued to him,\nmesmerised. </p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d </p><p>Phil got in first, settling in comfortably before beckoning\nDan over. The latter was hesitant, trying to be elegant about it and almost\nslipping in the process. A small tidal wave splashed over the side of the bath\nas he steadied himself on the tap. Phil laughed. He was relaxed, with his head\nresting against the wall and his arms stretched out over the sides of the bath.\nThe hot water made Dan want to relax, but the situation was so foreign and new\nto him that he was struggling to keep his composure altogether and was happy\nenough when he finally settled down with his knees pulled into his chest.</p><p>The bath water being blue obscured most areas Dan was\ninsecure about from sight, and soon enough he was relaxing his legs, stretching\nthem out alongside Phil\u2019s. \u201cSo, how was your year?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>He was good at asking those questions that could be answered\nby pretty much anything, leaving the decision as to where to draw the line with\nDan once again. \u201cGood,\u201d the latter said hesitantly, \u201cit was a ride.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed, \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m- I was in university before. I dropped out.\u201d Phil\ndidn\u2019t seem to judge him, just nodding encouragingly for Dan to go on. \u201cSo, I\nwork in a store now. Trying to, you know, sort out my life and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do when you\u2019re older?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, die maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s valid. But before that?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know, honestly.\u201d</p><p>Phil decided not to press anymore, and Dan quickly took the\nopportunity to ask about his year.</p><p>\u201cIt was good. I went on my last Europe tour as a member of\nthe team instead of a coach, so that was a bit bittersweet. I\u2019m excited to\ncoach though. Oh, I finally moved out, too. Was about time.\u201d He laughed, the\nwater moving off him in little waves.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Dan put on his underwear before he dried any other part of\nhis body. Phil had no such inclination, stood in the middle of the hotel room\nstark-naked while drying his hair. The bed looked cosy and inviting, and\nalthough the room was warm enough Dan longed to curl up under the covers for a\nwhile.</p><p>Wearing just his pants he crawled into bed and pulled the\nduvet up to his chin. While he waited for the other to finish up, he grabbed\nthe remote control off the bedside table and turned the TV on to a radio\nstation that was playing Christmas songs. The only thing this atmosphere needed\nto be perfect was a little scented candle, but Dan would settle for this.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ve been waiting pretty much all year to make out with\nyou. Do you mind doing that for a while before we decide what to do with the\nrest of our night?\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned, \u201cI think I\u2019m alright with that.\u201d</p><p>Phil slipped under the covers with him and pushed him down\nonto his back. Dan laced his fingers through Phil\u2019s mildly damp hair as they\nkissed. Maybe his flight response to Nicholas\u2019 question had had less to do with\nthe question of commitment to either a boy or anyone, and more to do with the\nfact that he was already committed to something. To a 24 hours period just\nbefore Christmas.</p><p>Phil\u2019s hands were a bit cold roaming his sides. They sent\nshivers down his spine, but he did nothing to stop them. </p><p>Soon enough they were both warmed up and their almost naked\nbodies moved together, arousal already showing. Every time Phil\u2019s hips touched\nagainst Dan\u2019s thigh it sent a pleasant shiver to his dick, his fingers\ntightening against Phil\u2019s hair and skin. It was pretty clear that \u2018what they\nwould be doing with the rest of their night\u2019 wasn\u2019t much of a question, really.\nWith the way hands and mouths were moving this was only going in one direction.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips had trailed off, going from Dan\u2019s neck to his\nchest and down to his belly. Looking down at him Dan watched the trail of faint\nhickeys grace down from his throat to the waistband of his boxers. Phil had\nalready moved on, his breath ghosting over the bulge in the fabric and his\nhands moving up Dan\u2019s thighs with confidence. </p><p>Although one part of his brain was focused solely on the\nfact that <i>a very attractive boy was about\nto give him a blowjob</i>, the other part of him couldn\u2019t help but think about\nwhat would happen after. The memory of last year was still fresh in his mind to\nput a slight damper on his excitement. He wanted to try again. The thought of\nactually having sex with Phil made his whole body tingle, but it was also\nscary. It was like losing his virginity all over again, where he had no idea\nwhat he was doing, and he just had to surrender all control to another, more\nexperienced party.</p><p>For a few minutes though, Dan\u2019s mind was completely taken\noff anything he could possibly worry about as Phil pulled down his underwear\nand put his mouth on him. He started by teasing along the shaft with his\ntongue, one hand holding him firmly by the base and the other with fingertips\nbarely grazing along his balls. Dan opened his eyes for a moment, glancing down\nat the sight below him. A soft sound escaped from the back of his throat before\nhis eyes closed again.</p><p>Phil was an expert. His mouth and hands moved just right,\nand much sooner than he wanted to Dan had to nudge him off to stop him from\nfinishing him off. \u201cCan we try last year again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to?\u201d Phil sat up on his heels. He\nneeded no further explanation; he knew what Dan meant.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I want to try, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say something stupid, but as it didn\u2019t work\nlast time, are you sure you really want it? Don\u2019t do it for me, I\u2019m doing\nperfectly fine without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, yes, I mean- I really want it. I do. I\u2019m just scared of\nthe pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go very slow. The moment it doesn\u2019t feel nice you give\nme a shout and I stop or take a step back, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Dan breathed.</p><p>The two of them kicked off their boxers, Dan pulling Phil\nback down for a quick kiss, but neither of them had much patience for a make\nout session knowing what was on the table now.</p><p>Phil had lube at the ready, spreading it on his fingers and\npressing soft butterfly kisses to Dan\u2019s abdomen as his hand moved down. Dan\nclosed his eyes. He felt more vulnerable than he ever had before. He was\nclutching at the sheets, but Phil carefully took one of his hands in his and\nsaid in a hushed tone, \u201cSqueeze my hand. Let me know if I do something wrong.\u201d</p><p>He kissed Dan\u2019s thigh while he pushed a finger in. Dan made\na sound and Phil\u2019s movements stilled, but he squeezed his hand, urging him to\ngo on. </p><p>He took it slow. Like he promised. He gave Dan time to\nadjust before putting a second finger in, and eventually let go of Dan\u2019s hand\nto tease his dick a bit, moving up and down in excruciatingly slow strokes. His\nwhole body was on fire, feelings things he\u2019d never felt before.</p><p>Eventually, after what felt like forever, Phil called him\nback to attention by pulling his fingers out and putting both hands on his\nhips, \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re well enough prepared, if you\u2019re still up for\nit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes followed Phil as he hopped off the bed and got a\ncondom from his suitcase. He tore open the wrapper and rolled the condom onto\nhimself with practised fingers, putting some extra lube on himself after. The\nactions of someone who\u2019d done this before and knew the pitfalls.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded. His throat was slightly closed up with nerves,\nbut as Phil settled in between his legs he felt no urge to move away. Rather,\nhe felt an impatient pull in his stomach, his dick twitching at the thought of\nwhat was about to happen. </p><p>The moment Phil\u2019s tip grazed his entrance Dan closed his\neyes and let his head fall back. He focused on relaxing, aided by Phil\u2019s\nsoothing hand on his side, rubbing circled into his skin with his thumb. Being\nfilled up felt weird, and it just kept coming until finally he felt Phil bottom\nout. He was given a few moments to adjust, catch his breath, which he took\nreluctantly. He wanted to move on. Desperate already even though he only had to\nwait a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d He muttered hoarsely.</p><p>Phil started slow. A practice run.</p><p>His hands were firmly holding on to Dan\u2019s hips as he started\nspeeding up little by little. Every time his hips touched against Dan and he\nwas fully filled up, Dan let out a shaky breath. He had no idea how long Phil\nwas going to last, but he didn\u2019t think he had a lot of time in him. His dick\nwas aching to be touched but he knew he\u2019d come very quickly if he gave into the\nurge.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Phil asked. The question came out\nbreathily, the words clearly an effort to utter.</p><p>\u201cGood. Too good, maybe.\u201d Phil gave him a questioning look,\nbut Dan took a few seconds to recover before he continued, \u201cI\u2019m getting close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d There was nothing in him that could muster up\neven the slightest bit of politeness. Phil didn\u2019t need any. His hand reached down,\nand fingers wrapped firmly around him. It only took a few firm strokes in time\nwith his hips to make Dan emit a desperate little sound and come all over his\nown belly. Phil followed shortly after, pushed over the edge by Dan\u2019s muscles\ncontracting around him.</p><p>Dan flinched when Phil pulled out. He felt overstimulated\nand sore, but completely satisfied. It was a tired, content kind of\nsatisfaction, making him want to finally curl up and go to sleep. \u201cWhat time is\nit?\u201d He whispered, following Phil\u2019s movements as the other went into the\nbathroom through half-closed eyes. </p><p>\u201cNearing half eleven.\u201d</p><p>Dan laughed as much as his sleepy state allowed him to and\nclosed his eyes fully, \u201cI usually don\u2019t go to sleep for another two hours or\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go to sleep now, if you want.\u201d Phil\u2019s voice came\nfrom the other room.</p><p>\u201cHmm, up to you.\u201d</p><p>Phil returned, putting his underwear back on and slipping\nback under the covers with Dan, \u201cIf we go to sleep now we\u2019ll have loads of time\ntogether tomorrow. I\u2019m not leaving till the evening. If you want that, of\ncourse.\u201d</p><p>That woke Dan up. He opened his eyes and raised his head,\nbut Phil had turned the light off and the room was dark. \u201cOf course I want\nthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay. Sleep now, then. We\u2019ll have a lot of time\ntomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Dan turned around, picking his underwear off the floor and\nwiggling into them under the duvet. When he was done, Phil crawled up beside\nhim and wrapped his arms around him from behind. \u201cThis okay?\u201d He asked. His\nwarm breath stroked along Dan\u2019s neck, making his skin raise into goosebumps.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He whispered back.</p><p>He fell asleep with Phil\u2019s arms tightly wrapped around him,\nsoothed by his even breathing against his skin.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>When Dan woke up Phil was still fast asleep. He snuck out\nfrom under his arm and tiptoed to the bathroom, where it still smelt like fruit\nand mint or whatever the bath bomb had been. After peeing Dan put a bit of\nPhil\u2019s toothpaste in his mouth and sloshed it around for a bit; it would have\nto do. </p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d He was greeted by Phil, lying on his back with\none arm thrown over his face to protect his eyes from the sunlight, when he\nwalked back into the bedroom. </p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to order some room service and chill in bed while we\neat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d He leant down and kissed the top of Phil\u2019s\nhead without really thinking, not realising himself until he met the other\u2019s\neyes. Phil pulled him down with a hand on the back of his neck and pecked his\nlips.</p><p>They ordered room service on the hotel website, Dan getting\npancakes and Phil some vegan waffles. While they waited for it to arrive Dan\ngot dressed, splashing some water in his face and attempting to bring his hair\nto some kind of order. He startled when he felt hands touching his belly. Phil\nhad appeared behind him, wrapping his arms around Dan\u2019s waist and now resting\nhis chin on his shoulder. \u201cWhat do you want to do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything. I wouldn\u2019t mind staying in and just hanging out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, just talking, getting to know each other?\u201d Dan asked.\nIt was meant as a joke, but when Phil shrugged he nodded, \u201cAlright, sure.\u201d</p><p>They ate their breakfast sat cross-legged on the big double\nbed. Soft Christmas music played on the TV as they started chatting, carefully\nat first but quickly becoming more free in their questions and stories. </p><p>In the middle of one of his stories Phil suddenly called his\ndad \u2018Mr Lester\u2019, bringing the hand that was just about to put a bite of pancake\ninto Dan\u2019s mouth to an abrupt halt. Phil hadn\u2019t noticed, his lively\nstorytelling not stuttering for even a second. </p><p>But Dan had a name.</p><p>He had a full name to plug into the Google search bar rather\nthan just the name of the ballet company. He wasn\u2019t sure whether to try his\nabsolute hardest to forget it as soon as possible, or whether to save it to his\nlong-term memory and tattoo it onto his brain. </p><p>\u2013</p><p>At about half two, when Phil was lying flat on his back with\nDan\u2019s head resting on his belly, both staring at the ceiling and half at the\nother\u2019s hands gesturing in the air as they spoke, Dan\u2019s phone started ringing.\nThey both raised their heads, disturbed.</p><p>It was Eleanor. A picture of her and Dan as little kids in a\nplaypark illuminated the screen.</p><p>\u201cEl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny-boy, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Dan glanced over to the bed, where Phil had grabbed\nhis own phone and was scrolling through some missed messages.</p><p>\u201cI told your mum you\u2019re hanging out with a mate, but I can\u2019t\nhold her off forever.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Christmas crafts.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realised the time.\u201d </p><p>It was quiet on the other end for a moment, \u201cBring him.\u201d She\nsaid finally.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Dan, bring him.\u201d</p><p>It was a weird crossroad to be at. He had 24 hours with\nPhil, but he also had a best friend and a mum waiting for their Christmas\ntradition, and he\u2019d already let them down by being late. Last year in November\nhe\u2019d been at the same fork in the road, he realised, and he\u2019d made the wrong\ndecision then. He\u2019d chosen Rosie over Eleanor and he still hated himself for\nthat. It was clear-cut, really.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for forgetting the time, I\u2019ll be over as soon as\nI can. Get the crafts ready, I\u2019m feeling the creative juices flowing.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor laughed, the sound sending a relieved warmth to\nDan\u2019s heart. \u201cAlright, alright. See you soon. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d When Dan turned back to the bed he wasn\u2019t\nsure how to break the news. He bit his lip and sat down, awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a Christmas tradition with my mum and my best\nfriend. It\u2019s bad enough that I forgot about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Phil nodded. His smile said that he meant it,\n\u201cMy bus leaves at ten, we can have dinner together if you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me at the hotel entrance at seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, all good. Have a good day, Dan.\u201d</p><p>Dan bit the inside of his cheek. This was the right thing to\ndo, and he was looking forward to crafts, as he did each year, but this still\nfelt bittersweet. </p><p>When Phil opened his arms he happily fell into them, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry.\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about it. The day after is not\nusually a part of our tradition, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it would\u2019ve been nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it would\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Eleanor hugged him when he came in. Her arms were familiar\nand welcoming, and decidedly not upset with him. \u201cHow was your day, huh?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, \u201cMost excellent, thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear all about it. As soon as we\u2019re not with your\nmum anymore, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? You know about my thing, I want to hear\nabout your night.\u201d She winked at him and spun on her heel, walking to the\nliving room. \u201cEleanor, you bitch, you can\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, there you are! Did you have a good time with your\nfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, it was lovely.\u201d Dan said, doing his best to hide\nthe grin on his face that was mirrored by his best friend to his left. </p><p>Eleanor, always right beside him.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Scrolling was a bit more difficult than usual after the Glue\nAccident, but Eleanor managed it as she showed Dan Facebook pictures of a boy\nwith blonde curls and a toned dancer\u2019s body. They\u2019d done two hours of crafts\nwith Dan\u2019s mum and then quickly retreated to Dan\u2019s room with two steaming mugs\nof hot chocolate, now stood forgotten on the bedside table. </p><p>Cam seemed nice enough, but it was clear that Eleanor didn\u2019t\ncare much for his niceness: he\u2019d given her his number at the end of the night,\nbut when Dan asked her if she\u2019d put it into her phone she said she didn\u2019t even\nremember where she put the note. The night had but a content grin on her face\nthat was enough for now. A reminder that she still had it and that Nicola was a\nstupid idiot who was missing out, like Dan had been telling her for the past\ncouple of months.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about you? Why were you still with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here all day. Not leaving till nine tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you were going to spend the day with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still here?\u201d With every word she was sitting up a bit\nstraighter.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBros before hoes. Mums before- I don\u2019t know- bums? You know\nwhat I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, crafts over. Go back to him, God. Your mum and I will\nstill be here tonight and tomorrow and all the time after that.\u201d</p><p>Dan was quiet for a moment. \u201cEl,\u201d He said then, softly, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry about last November.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to explain what he meant. She gave him a sad\nsmile and a playful push against the shoulder that meant more than it led on,\n\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really am. I shouldn\u2019t have prioritised Rosie over you,\nand that was so fucking dumb of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you were an idiot. Still are, really.\u201d Eleanor\nagreed.</p><p>Dan grinned, \u201cYeah, alright, alright, calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve it though.\u201d She said, laughing along. Her hand,\nstill on his shoulder, shook him gently, \u201cGo. It\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll hang out tonight\nand watch Home Alone. After he\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You came to crafts, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wanted to miss it.\u201d He scrambled to his\nfeet and kissed the top of her head. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too, idiot.\u201d She shook her head at him as he left\nthe room.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>It was six o\u2019clock when he made it into the hotel lobby and\nthe realisation that he had no way of getting upstairs or contacting Phil to\nlet him in. He stood, probably suspiciously, next to the check-in desk for just\na little too long, before his stupid foggy brain finally thought of something\nto do.</p><p>\u201cEl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you calling me? Go have sex or something.\u201d She\nwhispered the last part, probably still at his house, near his mum.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have his phone number. Can you see if you can find\nCam\u2019s and ask him for Phil\u2019s number for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You want me to ask a guy I slept with last night\nfor one of his friends\u2019 phone numbers? Do you want me to break the guy\u2019s\nheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him it\u2019s a gay emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA <i>gay</i> emergency,\nhuh?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face flushed red, \u201cAt this point, I can\u2019t really deny\nanything anymore, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, this is not what I called you for, El.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gay. I\u2019m just- not straight. Bi, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find Cam\u2019s number. Tell him it\u2019s a bi emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you\u2019re so lucky to have me.\u201d</p><p>After they hung up the phone Dan spent another couple of\nawkward minutes hanging around the check-in desk, giving the lady behind it a\nnod that he hoped was reassuring and friendly.</p><p>Just before his standing around started going from \u2018weird\u2019\nto \u2018scary\u2019, Eleanor texted him. Just a string of numbers. Presumably Phil\u2019s\nphone number. Phil Lester\u2019s phone number.</p><p>What was he even supposed to say? What did you put in a\nfirst text to someone you\u2019d known for two years but had only really seen three\ntimes?</p><p><i>Hey, it\u2019s Dan. I\u2019m\nback at the hotel if you want to hang out now? Am in the lobby.</i></p><p>His finger hovered over the \u2018send\u2019 button, and after a\nglance at the clock \u2013 twenty past six \u2013 he pressed it.</p><p>The lady behind the desk was really starting to give him\nlooks now, so he moved to near the lifts, which was maybe even more suspicious.\nThankfully, a minute or two later, one of the lifts opened and Phil appeared,\nnow dressed in some casual jeans and a T shirt. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were your crafts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, I\u2019m a master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are. Want to go straight to the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it just so happens that I know of an exquisite Pizza\nHut around the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, really? How did you become acquainted with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh well, I just Google Maps-ed it a minute and a half ago.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>It was a short walk. Five minutes, maybe. Dan felt some\nweird sense of pride walking next to Phil, boasting with the cute guy he\u2019d\nmanaged to get to\u2026 take him on a date? He wasn\u2019t sure what this was, until\nfingertips touched his hand palm and fingers intertwined with his. He glanced\nto his side and the two boys made eye contact, grinning at each other, each\ncontent with what had just occurred between them.</p><p>Dan\u2019s secondary school had had a pizza hut right around the\ncorner, meaning he was very, very closely acquainted with how things worked in\nthere. Phil, who\u2019d been on a ballet diet most of his life, had only stepped\nfoot inside a Pizza Hut maybe three times, had no idea what was going on from the\nmoment he walked in.</p><p>\u201cThe salad bar is free?\u201d He asked quietly, \u201cDan,\u201d he did a\nlittle jog to catch up with the other, \u201cDan, it\u2019s free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. The bacon bits are vegan, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bacon bits?\u201d</p><p>Dan was enjoying being the one with more experience on\nsomething for once, albeit with the workings of a cheap pizza place.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to look at the menu, knowing his order by\nheart. Amusedly, he watched Phil study his options with his finger tracing the\nletters as he read them. \u201cIs this one any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, the pan? Sure. I\u2019m a classic fan though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll be adventurous and get a pan.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d ordered Dan got some more entertainment from\nwatching Phil squint at the salad bar options, carefully picking up some\ntomatoes and then loading up on bacon bits. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d He asked, by which\ntime it was already far too late to dump the whole lot back into the bowl.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re vegan. My friend who\u2019s vegan has them all the\ntime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Phil made the classic mistake of overloading on the salad\nbar, so he couldn\u2019t finish his pizza. Dan gladly made use of this by eating the\nlast 3 slices. </p><p>The boundaries had been moved, and for some reason instead\nof making it more awkward, as it had been before when they weren\u2019t sure where\nthe lines were drawn, they spoke more easily and fluently. Phil even opened up\nabout his childhood, and how he\u2019d started dancing.</p><p>Dan had to try his best to not stare at him fondly, leaning\nhis head on one hand, while he listened. </p><p>\u2013</p><p>It was a quarter to eight. They had exactly an hour and\nfifteen minutes to get Phil\u2019s stuff packed up and get him on the bus, yet the\nmoment they left Pizza Hut, they headed in the exact opposite direction of the\nhotel.</p><p>Their fingers were intertwined, hands swinging between them\nas they walked. </p><p>They got ice cream at a place Dan loved, sitting outside on\na freezing December night despite the odd looks they were getting. By the end\nof it Dan couldn\u2019t feel his tongue, but it was worth it to see the happy smile\non Phil\u2019s face, and the way his cheeks had gone red and rosy from the cold air.</p><p>Eventually they had to reluctantly make their way back to\nthe hotel. Hand in hand once again.</p><p>Dan watched him throw his things into the suitcase on the\nfloor and zip it up with the effortless movements of someone who\u2019d done this\nmany times before. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you next year?\u201d Dan asked. He felt hope and hurt\nburning in his heart at once.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here. I hope you will be, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if I can find the time to pop by.\u201d Dan said. A\nweak attempt at a joke while he felt like a small part of him had just been\nzipped up into a suitcase headed north.</p><p>Downstairs by the bus, the other dancers greeted Dan like a\nfriend with pats on the back and smiling nods. \u201cSee you next year, Dan.\u201d One of\nthem told him.</p><p>A fair assertion, or so Dan hoped.</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Summary: </b>Every year Dan goes to a ballet performance of the Nutcracker around Christmas (he even starts to enjoy it after a while), but what he&rsquo;s really waiting for is the nights he gets to spend with one of the lead dancers after the show.</p><p><b>Rating: </b>M</p><p><b>Word count: </b>7.3K (20.3K total so far)</p><p><b>[A/N] Hope you enjoy my Christmas mini-series!</b></p><hr /><p><a href=\"http://daniactuallysnuffledthatpopcorn.tumblr.com/post/181326626495/home-for-christmas-part-2-of-4\" target=\"_blank\">&lt;&ndash; part two</a></p><p><a href=\"http://daniactuallysnuffledthatpopcorn.tumblr.com/post/181301007450/home-for-christmas-part-1-of-4\" target=\"_blank\">Start at the beginning</a></p><hr /><p>As the new year crawled by Dan found himself tempted to\ngoogle Phil&rsquo;s name more and more with each passing day. </p><p>When university started back up after Christmas break and he\nfound himself surrounded by the people who had to get used to seeing him\nwithout Rosie he caught himself just before pressing enter multiple times,\nerasing the words he&rsquo;d typed and turning off his phone screen before he could\nchange his mind again. He tried to avoid running into her, sometimes going as\nfar as skipping dinner because she was sat in the kitchen, until he no longer\nfelt his phone burning in his pocket watching her tending to her pans at the\nstove. Until he no longer had the pressing urge to get out of town every chance\nhe got, visiting Eleanor on the weekly. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Final exams rolled in way too fast and left him feeling\nwholly unprepared. No matter how many study dates and trips to the library he\nset up, it never seemed to be enough. Law books were big and heavy, pulling on\nhim with every step that brought him closer to the exam halls. Eleanor, whose\nexams didn&rsquo;t start until the day after his, stayed with him and made him a full\nfry for breakfast the morning before his first test. It was her way of trying\nto offer her support when she knew that as a neurosciences student she was\ncompletely useless when it came to helping him study. </p><p>Although he liked to think he was fully over Rosie by May,\nit still gave him some sort of satisfaction when Eleanor gave a resolute &ldquo;yes&rdquo;\nto his ex&rsquo;s polite &ldquo;you alright?&rdquo; as they sat at the kitchen table. </p><p>He wondered how she would greet Phil if she knew the ins and\nouts of their agreement. His phone lit up, signalling a new Snap from Davis.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Summer was a gift from god.</p><p>After missing their November weekend together Dan and\nEleanor spent a whole week exploring Rome in early August, completely avoiding\nthe topics of love lives and university and focusing on sunshine and gelato and\nthe ancient history they were walking around in on their flipflops. They held\nhands the way they&rsquo;d done in primary school, before they hit puberty and girls\nand boys weren&rsquo;t supposed to do that kind of stuff anymore. Before they cared\nabout what anyone thought of their relationship.</p><p>Dan neglected to mention to her that on the last night, when\nshe went to the bathroom as they were having a couple of drinks at the hotel\nbar, an Irish boy slipped him a napkin with a string of numbers on it\naccompanied by the words, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re not interested feel free to bin this, but\notherwise, text me&rdquo;. Dan shoved it in his pocket, where it stayed until he got\nback to his parents&rsquo; house in London and he unpacked his suitcase. He stood\nwith the paper in his hand for a minute or so, and then another few minutes\nstaring at the new contact in his phone. </p><p>Sat cross-legged on the bed he carefully crafted a message.\nAs he was typing it took everything from his willpower not to close the app and\ngo to google. To just type in that one name that he&rsquo;d put into that bar so many\ntimes before. Instead, he resolutely tapped the &lsquo;send&rsquo; button and then\nproceeded to put his phone under his pillow to leave it there for the next\ncouple of hours.</p><p>When Nicholas replied he was almost surprised. They spent\nthe next couple of weeks texting and although Dan had initially been sceptical,\nthe more he learnt about Nick, the more he felt that there might be something\nand he might not need to be stuck on his Christmas dates for the rest of his\nlife. </p><p>Nick was nice. Genuinely nice. He was a good listener, made\njokes at the right time, and had an intricate knowledge of all kinds of animals\nas he was studying to become a vet. Dan found himself looking forward to the\nevenings when Nick got home from placement and the two of them could Skype call\nbefore they went to bed. Long nights were spent lying on his back on the\ncarpet, feet propped up against the side of his desk, phone tucked comfortably\nbetween his shoulder and his ear. He could hear the Irish boy smile through the\nphone. </p><p>He liked Nick. He really did. But when in early October he\nasked him that dreaded question, &ldquo;so, what are we?&rdquo;, Dan couldn&rsquo;t stop his\nfight or flight response from kicking in. Unsure of whether he feared commitment\nto a boy or commitment to anyone at all, he broke it off. </p><p>From there on, things went downhill. Fast.</p><p>One of the boys Dan lived with dropped out, meaning they had\nto either find a new flatmate or a new place, and the others&rsquo; half-hearted\nsearch for a house stressed him out. University was pulling on him like a ball\non a chain and the words danced before his eyes on the nights he tried to catch\nup with the stacks of work accumulating on his desk. Eleanor&rsquo;s ugly selfies\nsent over snapchat were only doing so much to put a smile on his face, their\neffects diminishing with every day.</p><p>Two weeks after Reuben had left, Dan sent in his student\nwithdrawal form.</p><p>Three days later, he found the courage to tell his parents,\nsat on Eleanor&rsquo;s bed with one hand in hers and the other hand clutching the\nphone held to his ear. Everything was falling apart, but the one constant he\ncould always count on was his best friend always being right by his side.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dan moved back home hesitantly. His old bedroom felt too\nsmall for him and his hometown was full of eyes watching him, knowing he didn&rsquo;t\nbelong there anymore. </p><p>What did he actually want to do with his life? He had no\nidea, really. His new job at an electronics shop was not it though, that was\nfor damn sure. It had him drifting through the days, every week feeling like\nthe last, endless and exhausting. To pass the time he messed around with the\nproducts when he got bored, feeling professional when he pressed buttons on the\nDJ sets knowing what they did, and adjusting camera lenses with expert eyes. In\nthose moments he felt for a moment like he was on the right path, just not\nknowing where it would lead him yet.</p><p>In mid-December Dan used his first wages to buy one of those\nfancy cameras. He spent hours in his bedroom sat cross-legged on the floor\nadjusting settings and filming little test videos, the reality of his world\nforgotten for a precious while.</p><p>Four days before Christmas Dan planted the camera up on one\nof his book shelves, fixed his hair in the mirror for exactly two minutes\nlonger than necessary, and then pressed the record button. </p><p>He filmed his first video in one go, with rambling tangents\nand awkward pauses to edit out later, which he did the day after, when he got\nhome from work. He was tired. After a nine-hour day the last thing his eyes\nwanted to do was focus deeply on something for another couple of hours. One by\none his family members went to bed, the sounds of their bedroom doors closing\nreaching Dan even through his headphones. In the morning, when his alarm would\ngo off at half seven again, he&rsquo;d hate himself for this, but that felt well\nworth it when he clicked &lsquo;upload&rsquo; and watched the bar load up to a 100%. It was\ntwo in the morning when his first ever YouTube video went live.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dan and Eleanor had bought tickets for the ballet in early\nDecember almost out of habit. There had been no discussing it, just Eleanor\nasking if he&rsquo;d already bought them or if she should. On the day before\nChristmas Eve she picked him up in her car, blasting Mariah Carey so loud Dan\ncould hear it the moment he stepped out the front door. She was wearing a\nbeautiful silver dress and had her hair braided back so her elegant hoop\nearrings were clearly visible. He complimented her as he plopped down in the\npassenger seat of her Volkswagen. </p><p>He tried to play it cool, but it was difficult to do so when\nhe&rsquo;d been looking forward to this night for months. It felt on the verge of\npathetic, but his monotonous job left him with plenty of headspace to\ncontemplate all that could happen and might be in the future. He&rsquo;d lived this\nday and the next dozens of times over in his head stood behind the counter\nsmiling artificially at customers as he rang up their purchases. &nbsp;</p><p>They knew their way around the theatre by now. They knew\nwhere to find the coat room, and the fact that it cost 50p per coat, and they\nknew the quickest route up to the balcony and the toilet closest to it. Dan ran\nhis hands over the balustrade as they walked to their spots. The place was\nstill fully lit, giving him a view of the seats and the stage below. Two little\ngirls were on stage in front of the curtains, doing pirouettes and falling out\nof them with big grins decorating their little faces. He stood and watched them\nfor a moment, until he felt Eleanor demonstratively lean over the railing next\nto him. &ldquo;You excited?&rdquo; She asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess.&rdquo; He said without tearing his gaze away from\nthe kids.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you spoken to him at all since last year?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan shook his head, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even have his number. I don&rsquo;t\nknow his last name or anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? I thought you had a somewhat regulated plan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re both single by Christmas, we spend the night\ntogether. That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s the whole plan.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit of a disaster, Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He said. He sighed deeply, leaning further down\nuntil his chin came to rest on his hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given up trying to sort this\nout, I&rsquo;m just along for the ride now.&rdquo;</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t respond, but without needing to look over Dan\nknew she was rolling her eyes at him. </p><p>They watched the girls dance until they were ushered off the\nstage and the lights started to dim. The hall had filled up quite a bit since\nthey&rsquo;d turned their back on the balcony, and they had to shuffle past grumbly\nchic people annoyed they had to move their legs to let them past. It was Dan and\nEl&rsquo;s third year. They were used to the rich people by now.</p><p>The lead dancers had all changed. He recognised the previous\nlead as one of the background dancers, along with a couple of others who&rsquo;d had\nbig roles the years before. Phil was nowhere to be found. Dan had a heavy\nfeeling in his stomach as he watched them float across the stage. Eleanor\nnoticed too, taking her best friend&rsquo;s hand in hers and squeezing it tightly.\nThey exchanged a short glance, but Dan couldn&rsquo;t bear looking her in the eyes\nfor too long, too embarrassed about his situation and the hope he&rsquo;d displayed\nbefore the show. She knew he&rsquo;d been excited for their meeting and Phil&rsquo;s not\nbeing there made him feel ashamed, naive almost. His eyes absentmindedly\nfollowed the ballerinas, not really taking anything in.</p><p>Eleanor kept a firm grip on his hand, pulling him downstairs\nto the bar and pushing a glass of champagne into his hand. She wasn&rsquo;t sure what\nto say either, clearly. Dan could see the radars in her head spin as she tried\nto come up with a way to comfort him.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; </p><p>He saw Eleanor&rsquo;s eyes light up before he turned and faced\nthe person who&rsquo;d said his name.</p><p>Phil was wearing slacks and a button-down shirt, his hair\nneatly swept to one side. He looked older, more mature. Dan was glad Eleanor had\nmade him dress up that year, so he knew he looked good. He subconsciously\nreached up and tugged on his tie a bit as he looked the dancer up and down.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you.&rdquo; He managed to say.</p><p>&ldquo;You too.&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you might not be here this year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not on the team anymore. Not as a dancer, at least.\nI&rsquo;ve taken up that coaching position like I told you I might last year, I&rsquo;m\nassistant coach now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, congratulations.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that spectacular, I&rsquo;m not sure if it\ndeserves congratulations.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve done better for yourself than I have.&rdquo; Dan\nsaid. It was out there before he could stop himself, and the moment he&rsquo;d said\nit he was afraid he&rsquo;d enclosed too much information about his personal life.</p><p>&ldquo;You can tell me all about it after the show,&rdquo; Phil said, &ldquo;I\nhave to get back to the team now. I was just coming to say hi and make sure you\nknew I was here. Backdoor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, see you there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo; </p><p>He watched Phil leave before turning around to face Eleanor,\nwho had a smug look on her face. &ldquo;See, it&rsquo;s all fine.&rdquo; She said.</p><p>&ldquo;You say that now, but you were afraid he wouldn&rsquo;t be here\ntoo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; She admitted. She touched her champagne glass to\nhis, &ldquo;Cheers to another fun night for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And cheers for hopefully one for you. You deserve one.&rdquo; </p><p>He meant it. After Nicola cheated on her six months into\ntheir relationship she&rsquo;d stayed away from boys for a while, but a week earlier\nshe&rsquo;d said she might try and pull on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of December, for the\nfirst time in months. He watched her eye a guy standing behind them as she\nnodded and took a sip of her drink. &ldquo;I sure do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but break into a smile when he watched\nPhil approach. He was stopped a few times along the way to shake hands and\nreceive pats on the shoulder, but eventually he made it over and to Dan&rsquo;s\nsurprise he leaned in and kissed him right in front of everyone. &ldquo;Are you ready\nto go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, can you just leave?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nodded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk.&rdquo;</p><p>The moment they stepped out into the cold Dan glanced over\nto see if Phil would change his mind about walking, but he didn&rsquo;t. They both\nput up the collars on their coats and bowed their heads against the wind. Dan\nhad his hands shoved deep into his pockets until he felt Phil&rsquo;s fingers brush\nagainst his wrist. Wordlessly, their fingers intertwined and fell between their\ntwo bodies.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a good performance.&rdquo; Dan said eventually.</p><p>He saw Phil nod from the corner of his eye, &ldquo;They trained\ntheir little hearts out. The lead got sick three days ago, so this was the\nunderstudy performing. She&rsquo;d never had this big a role before and was so\nnervous, bless her.&rdquo; He smiled to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;When did you start coaching?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With the start of the new schoolyear, this September. I\nstill dance too, just not on this team anymore. I&rsquo;ve stopped competing too, I&rsquo;m\njust doing it for fun on the side now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That must&rsquo;ve been a transition.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I struggled with it a bit. Still do, really. I miss\nit, but I know this is where I need to be and what I need to be doing.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stayed quiet. His mind drifted to his own situation, how\nhe was far from where he needed to be. He bit his lip, face numb with the cold.</p><p>Phil squeezed his hand. The only comfort he could offer\nwithout asking too much about his life outside of their Christmas dates.</p><p>The hotel was a twenty-minute walk from the theatre, and\nwhen they finally stepped into the lobby Dan&rsquo;s whole body started stinging as\nthe warmth from inside hit him. Next to him, Phil rubbed his hands together and\nblew on them. His cheeks were bright red, shimmering in the bright lights. Dan\ncouldn&rsquo;t help remarking in his mind that he looked cute and kissable.</p><p>They took the lift up. Hand-in-hand once again, eyes shyly\nmeeting through their reflections in the mirror. The third time and still it\nfelt new and exciting.</p><p>There was only one big, king-sized bed in the room this\nyear. Phil&rsquo;s suitcase was on the floor by the desk with a couple of items\nstrewn over the chair. </p><p>&ldquo;So, I have a suggestion. You can say no if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Dan said, raising his eyebrows.</p><p>&ldquo;I brought a really nice bath bomb. From Lush. The bath is\nfairly spacious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil grabbed him by his tie and pulled him in, their lips\ntouching together gently. </p><p>They got undressed as the bath ran in the other room. Phil\nwas still as toned and gorgeous as he had been the years before and Dan&rsquo;s\nfingers itched to reach out and touch him. He had to have patience. Soon\nenough, they&rsquo;d be bunched up in the bath, with no other choice but to touch\neach other.</p><p>The bath bomb fizzed and coloured the water a pale, glittery\nblue. Phil lined up the little hotel shampoos and soaps on the side, his\nmuscles flexing under his taut skin as he moved. Dan&rsquo;s eyes were glued to him,\nmesmerised. </p><p>&ldquo;You good?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil got in first, settling in comfortably before beckoning\nDan over. The latter was hesitant, trying to be elegant about it and almost\nslipping in the process. A small tidal wave splashed over the side of the bath\nas he steadied himself on the tap. Phil laughed. He was relaxed, with his head\nresting against the wall and his arms stretched out over the sides of the bath.\nThe hot water made Dan want to relax, but the situation was so foreign and new\nto him that he was struggling to keep his composure altogether and was happy\nenough when he finally settled down with his knees pulled into his chest.</p><p>The bath water being blue obscured most areas Dan was\ninsecure about from sight, and soon enough he was relaxing his legs, stretching\nthem out alongside Phil&rsquo;s. &ldquo;So, how was your year?&rdquo; Phil asked.</p><p>He was good at asking those questions that could be answered\nby pretty much anything, leaving the decision as to where to draw the line with\nDan once again. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; the latter said hesitantly, &ldquo;it was a ride.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughed, &ldquo;Yeah, me too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m- I was in university before. I dropped out.&rdquo; Phil\ndidn&rsquo;t seem to judge him, just nodding encouragingly for Dan to go on. &ldquo;So, I\nwork in a store now. Trying to, you know, sort out my life and all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want to do when you&rsquo;re older?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, die maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s valid. But before that?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shrugged, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, honestly.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil decided not to press anymore, and Dan quickly took the\nopportunity to ask about his year.</p><p>&ldquo;It was good. I went on my last Europe tour as a member of\nthe team instead of a coach, so that was a bit bittersweet. I&rsquo;m excited to\ncoach though. Oh, I finally moved out, too. Was about time.&rdquo; He laughed, the\nwater moving off him in little waves.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dan put on his underwear before he dried any other part of\nhis body. Phil had no such inclination, stood in the middle of the hotel room\nstark-naked while drying his hair. The bed looked cosy and inviting, and\nalthough the room was warm enough Dan longed to curl up under the covers for a\nwhile.</p><p>Wearing just his pants he crawled into bed and pulled the\nduvet up to his chin. While he waited for the other to finish up, he grabbed\nthe remote control off the bedside table and turned the TV on to a radio\nstation that was playing Christmas songs. The only thing this atmosphere needed\nto be perfect was a little scented candle, but Dan would settle for this.</p><p>&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ve been waiting pretty much all year to make out with\nyou. Do you mind doing that for a while before we decide what to do with the\nrest of our night?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan grinned, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m alright with that.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil slipped under the covers with him and pushed him down\nonto his back. Dan laced his fingers through Phil&rsquo;s mildly damp hair as they\nkissed. Maybe his flight response to Nicholas&rsquo; question had had less to do with\nthe question of commitment to either a boy or anyone, and more to do with the\nfact that he was already committed to something. To a 24 hours period just\nbefore Christmas.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s hands were a bit cold roaming his sides. They sent\nshivers down his spine, but he did nothing to stop them. </p><p>Soon enough they were both warmed up and their almost naked\nbodies moved together, arousal already showing. Every time Phil&rsquo;s hips touched\nagainst Dan&rsquo;s thigh it sent a pleasant shiver to his dick, his fingers\ntightening against Phil&rsquo;s hair and skin. It was pretty clear that &lsquo;what they\nwould be doing with the rest of their night&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t much of a question, really.\nWith the way hands and mouths were moving this was only going in one direction.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s lips had trailed off, going from Dan&rsquo;s neck to his\nchest and down to his belly. Looking down at him Dan watched the trail of faint\nhickeys grace down from his throat to the waistband of his boxers. Phil had\nalready moved on, his breath ghosting over the bulge in the fabric and his\nhands moving up Dan&rsquo;s thighs with confidence. </p><p>Although one part of his brain was focused solely on the\nfact that <i>a very attractive boy was about\nto give him a blowjob</i>, the other part of him couldn&rsquo;t help but think about\nwhat would happen after. The memory of last year was still fresh in his mind to\nput a slight damper on his excitement. He wanted to try again. The thought of\nactually having sex with Phil made his whole body tingle, but it was also\nscary. It was like losing his virginity all over again, where he had no idea\nwhat he was doing, and he just had to surrender all control to another, more\nexperienced party.</p><p>For a few minutes though, Dan&rsquo;s mind was completely taken\noff anything he could possibly worry about as Phil pulled down his underwear\nand put his mouth on him. He started by teasing along the shaft with his\ntongue, one hand holding him firmly by the base and the other with fingertips\nbarely grazing along his balls. Dan opened his eyes for a moment, glancing down\nat the sight below him. A soft sound escaped from the back of his throat before\nhis eyes closed again.</p><p>Phil was an expert. His mouth and hands moved just right,\nand much sooner than he wanted to Dan had to nudge him off to stop him from\nfinishing him off. &ldquo;Can we try last year again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want to?&rdquo; Phil sat up on his heels. He\nneeded no further explanation; he knew what Dan meant.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I want to try, at least.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to say something stupid, but as it didn&rsquo;t work\nlast time, are you sure you really want it? Don&rsquo;t do it for me, I&rsquo;m doing\nperfectly fine without it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, yes, I mean- I really want it. I do. I&rsquo;m just scared of\nthe pain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go very slow. The moment it doesn&rsquo;t feel nice you give\nme a shout and I stop or take a step back, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Dan breathed.</p><p>The two of them kicked off their boxers, Dan pulling Phil\nback down for a quick kiss, but neither of them had much patience for a make\nout session knowing what was on the table now.</p><p>Phil had lube at the ready, spreading it on his fingers and\npressing soft butterfly kisses to Dan&rsquo;s abdomen as his hand moved down. Dan\nclosed his eyes. He felt more vulnerable than he ever had before. He was\nclutching at the sheets, but Phil carefully took one of his hands in his and\nsaid in a hushed tone, &ldquo;Squeeze my hand. Let me know if I do something wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>He kissed Dan&rsquo;s thigh while he pushed a finger in. Dan made\na sound and Phil&rsquo;s movements stilled, but he squeezed his hand, urging him to\ngo on. </p><p>He took it slow. Like he promised. He gave Dan time to\nadjust before putting a second finger in, and eventually let go of Dan&rsquo;s hand\nto tease his dick a bit, moving up and down in excruciatingly slow strokes. His\nwhole body was on fire, feelings things he&rsquo;d never felt before.</p><p>Eventually, after what felt like forever, Phil called him\nback to attention by pulling his fingers out and putting both hands on his\nhips, &ldquo;You doing okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re well enough prepared, if you&rsquo;re still up for\nit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes followed Phil as he hopped off the bed and got a\ncondom from his suitcase. He tore open the wrapper and rolled the condom onto\nhimself with practised fingers, putting some extra lube on himself after. The\nactions of someone who&rsquo;d done this before and knew the pitfalls.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nodded. His throat was slightly closed up with nerves,\nbut as Phil settled in between his legs he felt no urge to move away. Rather,\nhe felt an impatient pull in his stomach, his dick twitching at the thought of\nwhat was about to happen. </p><p>The moment Phil&rsquo;s tip grazed his entrance Dan closed his\neyes and let his head fall back. He focused on relaxing, aided by Phil&rsquo;s\nsoothing hand on his side, rubbing circled into his skin with his thumb. Being\nfilled up felt weird, and it just kept coming until finally he felt Phil bottom\nout. He was given a few moments to adjust, catch his breath, which he took\nreluctantly. He wanted to move on. Desperate already even though he only had to\nwait a few seconds.</p><p>&ldquo;Go.&rdquo; He muttered hoarsely.</p><p>Phil started slow. A practice run.</p><p>His hands were firmly holding on to Dan&rsquo;s hips as he started\nspeeding up little by little. Every time his hips touched against Dan and he\nwas fully filled up, Dan let out a shaky breath. He had no idea how long Phil\nwas going to last, but he didn&rsquo;t think he had a lot of time in him. His dick\nwas aching to be touched but he knew he&rsquo;d come very quickly if he gave into the\nurge.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you doing?&rdquo; Phil asked. The question came out\nbreathily, the words clearly an effort to utter.</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Too good, maybe.&rdquo; Phil gave him a questioning look,\nbut Dan took a few seconds to recover before he continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting close.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Touch me.&rdquo; There was nothing in him that could muster up\neven the slightest bit of politeness. Phil didn&rsquo;t need any. His hand reached down,\nand fingers wrapped firmly around him. It only took a few firm strokes in time\nwith his hips to make Dan emit a desperate little sound and come all over his\nown belly. Phil followed shortly after, pushed over the edge by Dan&rsquo;s muscles\ncontracting around him.</p><p>Dan flinched when Phil pulled out. He felt overstimulated\nand sore, but completely satisfied. It was a tired, content kind of\nsatisfaction, making him want to finally curl up and go to sleep. &ldquo;What time is\nit?&rdquo; He whispered, following Phil&rsquo;s movements as the other went into the\nbathroom through half-closed eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Nearing half eleven.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan laughed as much as his sleepy state allowed him to and\nclosed his eyes fully, &ldquo;I usually don&rsquo;t go to sleep for another two hours or\nso.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can go to sleep now, if you want.&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s voice came\nfrom the other room.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, up to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil returned, putting his underwear back on and slipping\nback under the covers with Dan, &ldquo;If we go to sleep now we&rsquo;ll have loads of time\ntogether tomorrow. I&rsquo;m not leaving till the evening. If you want that, of\ncourse.&rdquo;</p><p>That woke Dan up. He opened his eyes and raised his head,\nbut Phil had turned the light off and the room was dark. &ldquo;Of course I want\nthat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Okay. Sleep now, then. We&rsquo;ll have a lot of time\ntomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan turned around, picking his underwear off the floor and\nwiggling into them under the duvet. When he was done, Phil crawled up beside\nhim and wrapped his arms around him from behind. &ldquo;This okay?&rdquo; He asked. His\nwarm breath stroked along Dan&rsquo;s neck, making his skin raise into goosebumps.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He whispered back.</p><p>He fell asleep with Phil&rsquo;s arms tightly wrapped around him,\nsoothed by his even breathing against his skin.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>When Dan woke up Phil was still fast asleep. He snuck out\nfrom under his arm and tiptoed to the bathroom, where it still smelt like fruit\nand mint or whatever the bath bomb had been. After peeing Dan put a bit of\nPhil&rsquo;s toothpaste in his mouth and sloshed it around for a bit; it would have\nto do. </p><p>&ldquo;Morning.&rdquo; He was greeted by Phil, lying on his back with\none arm thrown over his face to protect his eyes from the sunlight, when he\nwalked back into the bedroom. </p><p>&ldquo;Morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Want to order some room service and chill in bed while we\neat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds good.&rdquo; He leant down and kissed the top of Phil&rsquo;s\nhead without really thinking, not realising himself until he met the other&rsquo;s\neyes. Phil pulled him down with a hand on the back of his neck and pecked his\nlips.</p><p>They ordered room service on the hotel website, Dan getting\npancakes and Phil some vegan waffles. While they waited for it to arrive Dan\ngot dressed, splashing some water in his face and attempting to bring his hair\nto some kind of order. He startled when he felt hands touching his belly. Phil\nhad appeared behind him, wrapping his arms around Dan&rsquo;s waist and now resting\nhis chin on his shoulder. &ldquo;What do you want to do today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind staying in and just hanging out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, just talking, getting to know each other?&rdquo; Dan asked.\nIt was meant as a joke, but when Phil shrugged he nodded, &ldquo;Alright, sure.&rdquo;</p><p>They ate their breakfast sat cross-legged on the big double\nbed. Soft Christmas music played on the TV as they started chatting, carefully\nat first but quickly becoming more free in their questions and stories. </p><p>In the middle of one of his stories Phil suddenly called his\ndad &lsquo;Mr Lester&rsquo;, bringing the hand that was just about to put a bite of pancake\ninto Dan&rsquo;s mouth to an abrupt halt. Phil hadn&rsquo;t noticed, his lively\nstorytelling not stuttering for even a second. </p><p>But Dan had a name.</p><p>He had a full name to plug into the Google search bar rather\nthan just the name of the ballet company. He wasn&rsquo;t sure whether to try his\nabsolute hardest to forget it as soon as possible, or whether to save it to his\nlong-term memory and tattoo it onto his brain. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>At about half two, when Phil was lying flat on his back with\nDan&rsquo;s head resting on his belly, both staring at the ceiling and half at the\nother&rsquo;s hands gesturing in the air as they spoke, Dan&rsquo;s phone started ringing.\nThey both raised their heads, disturbed.</p><p>It was Eleanor. A picture of her and Dan as little kids in a\nplaypark illuminated the screen.</p><p>&ldquo;El?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Danny-boy, where are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; Dan glanced over to the bed, where Phil had grabbed\nhis own phone and was scrolling through some missed messages.</p><p>&ldquo;I told your mum you&rsquo;re hanging out with a mate, but I can&rsquo;t\nhold her off forever.&rdquo;</p><p>Fuck. Christmas crafts.</p><p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t realised the time.&rdquo; </p><p>It was quiet on the other end for a moment, &ldquo;Bring him.&rdquo; She\nsaid finally.</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;ll come back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really, Dan, bring him.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a weird crossroad to be at. He had 24 hours with\nPhil, but he also had a best friend and a mum waiting for their Christmas\ntradition, and he&rsquo;d already let them down by being late. Last year in November\nhe&rsquo;d been at the same fork in the road, he realised, and he&rsquo;d made the wrong\ndecision then. He&rsquo;d chosen Rosie over Eleanor and he still hated himself for\nthat. It was clear-cut, really.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for forgetting the time, I&rsquo;ll be over as soon as\nI can. Get the crafts ready, I&rsquo;m feeling the creative juices flowing.&rdquo;</p><p>Eleanor laughed, the sound sending a relieved warmth to\nDan&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;Alright, alright. See you soon. Love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love you, too.&rdquo; When Dan turned back to the bed he wasn&rsquo;t\nsure how to break the news. He bit his lip and sat down, awkwardly.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to go?&rdquo; Phil asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a Christmas tradition with my mum and my best\nfriend. It&rsquo;s bad enough that I forgot about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Phil nodded. His smile said that he meant it,\n&ldquo;My bus leaves at ten, we can have dinner together if you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love that, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Meet me at the hotel entrance at seven?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, all good. Have a good day, Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan bit the inside of his cheek. This was the right thing to\ndo, and he was looking forward to crafts, as he did each year, but this still\nfelt bittersweet. </p><p>When Phil opened his arms he happily fell into them, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nsorry.&rdquo; He said.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, don&rsquo;t worry about it. The day after is not\nusually a part of our tradition, after all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, but it would&rsquo;ve been nice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it would&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Eleanor hugged him when he came in. Her arms were familiar\nand welcoming, and decidedly not upset with him. &ldquo;How was your day, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>He grinned, &ldquo;Most excellent, thanks for asking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to hear all about it. As soon as we&rsquo;re not with your\nmum anymore, that is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding? You know about my thing, I want to hear\nabout your night.&rdquo; She winked at him and spun on her heel, walking to the\nliving room. &ldquo;Eleanor, you bitch, you can&rsquo;t do this to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can, and I will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, there you are! Did you have a good time with your\nfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, it was lovely.&rdquo; Dan said, doing his best to hide\nthe grin on his face that was mirrored by his best friend to his left. </p><p>Eleanor, always right beside him.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Scrolling was a bit more difficult than usual after the Glue\nAccident, but Eleanor managed it as she showed Dan Facebook pictures of a boy\nwith blonde curls and a toned dancer&rsquo;s body. They&rsquo;d done two hours of crafts\nwith Dan&rsquo;s mum and then quickly retreated to Dan&rsquo;s room with two steaming mugs\nof hot chocolate, now stood forgotten on the bedside table. </p><p>Cam seemed nice enough, but it was clear that Eleanor didn&rsquo;t\ncare much for his niceness: he&rsquo;d given her his number at the end of the night,\nbut when Dan asked her if she&rsquo;d put it into her phone she said she didn&rsquo;t even\nremember where she put the note. The night had but a content grin on her face\nthat was enough for now. A reminder that she still had it and that Nicola was a\nstupid idiot who was missing out, like Dan had been telling her for the past\ncouple of months.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what about you? Why were you still with him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here all day. Not leaving till nine tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, you were going to spend the day with him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still here?&rdquo; With every word she was sitting up a bit\nstraighter.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bros before hoes. Mums before- I don&rsquo;t know- bums? You know\nwhat I mean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, crafts over. Go back to him, God. Your mum and I will\nstill be here tonight and tomorrow and all the time after that.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan was quiet for a moment. &ldquo;El,&rdquo; He said then, softly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nsorry about last November.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t need to explain what he meant. She gave him a sad\nsmile and a playful push against the shoulder that meant more than it led on,\n&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I really am. I shouldn&rsquo;t have prioritised Rosie over you,\nand that was so fucking dumb of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you were an idiot. Still are, really.&rdquo; Eleanor\nagreed.</p><p>Dan grinned, &ldquo;Yeah, alright, alright, calm down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You deserve it though.&rdquo; She said, laughing along. Her hand,\nstill on his shoulder, shook him gently, &ldquo;Go. It&rsquo;s okay, we&rsquo;ll hang out tonight\nand watch Home Alone. After he&rsquo;s left.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. You came to crafts, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to miss it.&rdquo; He scrambled to his\nfeet and kissed the top of her head. &ldquo;Love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love you, too, idiot.&rdquo; She shook her head at him as he left\nthe room.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>It was six o&rsquo;clock when he made it into the hotel lobby and\nthe realisation that he had no way of getting upstairs or contacting Phil to\nlet him in. He stood, probably suspiciously, next to the check-in desk for just\na little too long, before his stupid foggy brain finally thought of something\nto do.</p><p>&ldquo;El?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you calling me? Go have sex or something.&rdquo; She\nwhispered the last part, probably still at his house, near his mum.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have his phone number. Can you see if you can find\nCam&rsquo;s and ask him for Phil&rsquo;s number for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? You want me to ask a guy I slept with last night\nfor one of his friends&rsquo; phone numbers? Do you want me to break the guy&rsquo;s\nheart?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell him it&rsquo;s a gay emergency.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A <i>gay</i> emergency,\nhuh?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s face flushed red, &ldquo;At this point, I can&rsquo;t really deny\nanything anymore, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, this is not what I called you for, El.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gay. I&rsquo;m just- not straight. Bi, maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find Cam&rsquo;s number. Tell him it&rsquo;s a bi emergency.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an angel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, and you&rsquo;re so lucky to have me.&rdquo;</p><p>After they hung up the phone Dan spent another couple of\nawkward minutes hanging around the check-in desk, giving the lady behind it a\nnod that he hoped was reassuring and friendly.</p><p>Just before his standing around started going from &lsquo;weird&rsquo;\nto &lsquo;scary&rsquo;, Eleanor texted him. Just a string of numbers. Presumably Phil&rsquo;s\nphone number. Phil Lester&rsquo;s phone number.</p><p>What was he even supposed to say? What did you put in a\nfirst text to someone you&rsquo;d known for two years but had only really seen three\ntimes?</p><p><i>Hey, it&rsquo;s Dan. I&rsquo;m\nback at the hotel if you want to hang out now? Am in the lobby.</i></p><p>His finger hovered over the &lsquo;send&rsquo; button, and after a\nglance at the clock &ndash; twenty past six &ndash; he pressed it.</p><p>The lady behind the desk was really starting to give him\nlooks now, so he moved to near the lifts, which was maybe even more suspicious.\nThankfully, a minute or two later, one of the lifts opened and Phil appeared,\nnow dressed in some casual jeans and a T shirt. &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How were your crafts?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent, I&rsquo;m a master.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you are. Want to go straight to the restaurant?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. Where are we going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it just so happens that I know of an exquisite Pizza\nHut around the corner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm, really? How did you become acquainted with it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah well, I just Google Maps-ed it a minute and a half ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>It was a short walk. Five minutes, maybe. Dan felt some\nweird sense of pride walking next to Phil, boasting with the cute guy he&rsquo;d\nmanaged to get to&hellip; take him on a date? He wasn&rsquo;t sure what this was, until\nfingertips touched his hand palm and fingers intertwined with his. He glanced\nto his side and the two boys made eye contact, grinning at each other, each\ncontent with what had just occurred between them.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s secondary school had had a pizza hut right around the\ncorner, meaning he was very, very closely acquainted with how things worked in\nthere. Phil, who&rsquo;d been on a ballet diet most of his life, had only stepped\nfoot inside a Pizza Hut maybe three times, had no idea what was going on from the\nmoment he walked in.</p><p>&ldquo;The salad bar is free?&rdquo; He asked quietly, &ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; he did a\nlittle jog to catch up with the other, &ldquo;Dan, it&rsquo;s free?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. The bacon bits are vegan, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The bacon bits?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan was enjoying being the one with more experience on\nsomething for once, albeit with the workings of a cheap pizza place.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t need to look at the menu, knowing his order by\nheart. Amusedly, he watched Phil study his options with his finger tracing the\nletters as he read them. &ldquo;Is this one any good?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, the pan? Sure. I&rsquo;m a classic fan though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be adventurous and get a pan.&rdquo;</p><p>After they&rsquo;d ordered Dan got some more entertainment from\nwatching Phil squint at the salad bar options, carefully picking up some\ntomatoes and then loading up on bacon bits. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo; He asked, by which\ntime it was already far too late to dump the whole lot back into the bowl.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, they&rsquo;re vegan. My friend who&rsquo;s vegan has them all the\ntime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil made the classic mistake of overloading on the salad\nbar, so he couldn&rsquo;t finish his pizza. Dan gladly made use of this by eating the\nlast 3 slices. </p><p>The boundaries had been moved, and for some reason instead\nof making it more awkward, as it had been before when they weren&rsquo;t sure where\nthe lines were drawn, they spoke more easily and fluently. Phil even opened up\nabout his childhood, and how he&rsquo;d started dancing.</p><p>Dan had to try his best to not stare at him fondly, leaning\nhis head on one hand, while he listened. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>It was a quarter to eight. They had exactly an hour and\nfifteen minutes to get Phil&rsquo;s stuff packed up and get him on the bus, yet the\nmoment they left Pizza Hut, they headed in the exact opposite direction of the\nhotel.</p><p>Their fingers were intertwined, hands swinging between them\nas they walked. </p><p>They got ice cream at a place Dan loved, sitting outside on\na freezing December night despite the odd looks they were getting. By the end\nof it Dan couldn&rsquo;t feel his tongue, but it was worth it to see the happy smile\non Phil&rsquo;s face, and the way his cheeks had gone red and rosy from the cold air.</p><p>Eventually they had to reluctantly make their way back to\nthe hotel. Hand in hand once again.</p><p>Dan watched him throw his things into the suitcase on the\nfloor and zip it up with the effortless movements of someone who&rsquo;d done this\nmany times before. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you next year?&rdquo; Dan asked. He felt hope and hurt\nburning in his heart at once.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here. I hope you will be, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I can find the time to pop by.&rdquo; Dan said. A\nweak attempt at a joke while he felt like a small part of him had just been\nzipped up into a suitcase headed north.</p><p>Downstairs by the bus, the other dancers greeted Dan like a\nfriend with pats on the back and smiling nods. &ldquo;See you next year, Dan.&rdquo; One of\nthem told him.</p><p>A fair assertion, or so Dan hoped.</p>",

He tried to avoid running into her, sometimes going as\nfar as skipping dinner because she was sat in the kitchen, until he no longer\nfelt his phone burning in his pocket watching her tending to her pans at the\nstove. Until he no longer had the pressing urge to get out of town every chance\nhe got, visiting Eleanor on the weekly. </p>\n<p>&ndash;</p>\n<p>Final exams rolled in way too fast and left him feeling\nwholly unprepared. No matter how many study dates and trips to the library he\nset up, it never seemed to be enough. Law books were big and heavy, pulling on\nhim with every step that brought him closer to the exam halls. Eleanor, whose\nexams didn&rsquo;t start until the day after his, stayed with him and made him a full\nfry for breakfast the morning before his first test. It was her way of trying\nto offer her support when she knew that as a neurosciences student she was\ncompletely useless when it came to helping him study. </p>\n</p>",
