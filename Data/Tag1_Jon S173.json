Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/40766213\">AO3</a>. <br/></p><p>Her boots made\nthe snow crunch. Jon had taken her by the elbow and had steered her outside. He\nwas leading them to the godswood with determined strides. <i>He wants an honest answer. That is why he wants to talk at the godswood. <br/></i></p><!-- more --><p>Sansa\u2019s pulse\nbeat like a hammer in her ears. She was filled with dread and hope at the same\ntime. When Jon had looked at her, his gaze had set her blood on fire. Her hope\nhad soared. But her fear had been ice cold on her back as well. The fear that\nthis was just politics. She felt as if she could not breathe properly, as if anything\nmore than a shallow breath would break the fragile balance in her veins and\nmake her collapse. As if only the topmost part of her lungs was able to\nbreathe, the rest was filled with ice. Still, white mist formed at her mouth,\nso she must be breathing. She loved him so much. Everyone was talking over her\nhead about her claim, her fate, and he was the one who wanted her answer. </p><p><i>I will say yes, anyway. He\u2019ll probably tell me\nit is all politics, that he needs this marriage. But he cares for me, he might\nlearn to love me.</i> She\nalmost giggled. <i>He will give me a choice,\nand this shows me he cares for me, and that he might learn to love me. More men\nshould realise that this is the best opening for a proposal. Just leave the\nlady a choice.</i></p><p>When they\nreached the weirwood, Jon\u2019s determination suddenly faltered. He had let go of\nher elbow and touched the stem of the tree, the red leaves painting dancing\nshadows on his face.</p><p>He looked\nat her face, searchingly, while Sansa tried to control her breathing. <i>I don\u2019t want him to be frightened. I should\nstay calm.</i> But she could feel her cheeks burning and felt vulnerable and exposed\nas if Jon could see all her secret desires. Unbidden she thought about the\nnight, when she had poured her heart out to Ghost\u2019s ears. She chided herself. <i>Thinking about that won\u2019t help.</i></p><p>Finally,\nJon opened his mouth, and barked an embarrassed laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to\nstart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\nthe subject of our conversation was a given.\u201d Sansa remarked.</p><p>Jon flushed.</p><p>She laid her\nhand on his arm, even though her head told her to be more careful and guard her\nheart. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nJon, I couldn\u2019t help myself. Why don\u2019t you start with this proposal and\u2026 then\nwe proceed to the easier problems like the White Walkers?\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled\nwanly. \u201cYou want me to start with the most difficult?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI might\nhave blundered,\u201d he said and then he grimaced. \u201cNo, I blundered. I made a mess\nabout the negotiatins with Daenerys.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nlooked at him, confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. It was Daenerys who read your\nletters and then changed her terms for an alliance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\ndidn\u2019t tell the whole truth at the council. There is something you must know\nabout why the alliance with Daenerys failed, and I must tell you and I don\u2019t\nknow how.\u201d He sucked in a deep breath. \u201cI was so confused\u2026 and heart-broken and\nI acted rashly without thinking and if it had not been for Davos, I might have\ndied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nJon, this doesn\u2019t make any sense to me? You talk in riddles.\u201d Her dread clearly\nhad the upper hand now, an ice-cold hand at the small of her back that stole the\nwarmth from her body and filled her lungs. She breathed shallowly.</p><p>Jon\nsearched her face, he must have heard the strain in her voice. \u201cSansa, I\u2026.\u201d he\nbegan and stopped himself again.</p><p>He gave her\na lopsided grin. \u201cI\u2019m so unsure, if I should start with what will probably make\nyou very angry and might hurt you or what might be welcome, maybe\u2026.\u201d</p><p><i>What does he mean?</i> She shivered and then decided to be brave. \u201cJust\nget it over with, Jon. I have no idea, what you are talking about. Maybe start with\nthe worst.\u201d She braced herself. </p><p>\u201cI thought\nyou were to marry Sweetrobin or even worse Littlefinger.\u201d He stopped again.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she\ntried to coax him.</p><p>\u201cI left\nthat out just now. I \u2026\u201d He inhaled slowly and then it all come out in a rush. \u201cI\nthought that I had to make a marriage alliance as well. I planned to marry Daenerys\nto get that alliance, to save Winterfell, you all. I would probably be married\nby now, if Daenerys hadn\u2019t read these letters and Sam hadn\u2019t found me with the\nnews about my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon, I gathered\nthat much at the council.\u201d <i>Why is he so\nagitated?</i> </p><p>Then it hit\nher. \u201cOh Jon, have you fallen for her?\u201d The ice blade of her dread crept up to\nher shoulders. She felt sorry for him and at the same time, despair washed over\nher. <i>He still left her and came here to\nsave us, to save Winterfell. </i>That was the tiny voice of her hope, small but\ninsistent.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d\nJon protested. \u201cbut I slept with her and she could only read my letters because\nshe went through my clothing.\u201d</p><p>Sansa felt as\nif the breath was knocked out of her lungs. She was unable to say anything. Jon\nlooked at her with desperate and pleading eyes, she didn\u2019t quite know what it\nwas he wanted. <i>My forgiveness? For what?</i></p><p>\u201cWhy were\nthe letters in your clothes?\u201d, she asked finally, this tiny riddle somehow\nbegging to be solved.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\nwanted them close to my heart,\u201d Jon whispered almost inaudibly. </p><p>\u201cClose to\nyour heart?\u201d she repeated. The icy dagger retreated from her shoulder blades,\nas if her body had understood what her brain had not yet grasped. A ray of sunshine\nfell through the red leaves of the weirwood and danced on Jon\u2019s head, giving\nhis black hair a sheen.</p><p>\u201cYour\nletter, where you told me that you miss me, I thought that would be the only\nthing I could ever have.\u201d Jon\u2019s voice was still very low.</p><p>He took her\nhand and she immediately felt the warmth of his hand, welcome, familiar and\nnew. The warmth spread from her hand to her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI love you\nso much, Sansa. I left Winterfell to battle my feelings, but to no avail. I\nknew I had no right, and yet I was so deperate about Lord Royce\u2019s letter. I was\nnot thinking clearly.\u201d</p><p>His thumb\nstroked hers, and he looked into her eyes. \u201cI am still not thinking clearly. I\ncan hardly believe, that I can tell you how I feel. That I am your cousin, free\nto love you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa could\nnot help herself, a warm bubble of laughter somehow rose in her throat.</p><p>Jon looked\nat her, suddenly shy and uncertain. He dropped her hand.</p><p>But Sansa boldly\ntook his hand again and held on to it, craving his warmth. </p><p>\u201cYou\navoided me, the woman you thought your sister and slept with your aunt. You thought\nI would wed another and were ready to sacrifice yourself, thinking you could\nnever tell me how you feel.\u201d She had to laugh again.</p><p>Jon looked\nat her, still uncertain. She would have to find the words to make him\nunderstand.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she\nsaid, trying to put all her love in this one word. \u201cJon, when Bran told me that\nyou are Lyanna\u2019s son, I cried. I cried so hard! Do you know why?\u201d</p><p>Jon shook\nhis head.</p><p>\u201cWhen Arya\nasked me, I told her that I cried for father and mother, that my mother never\nknew that father did not sire a bastard. That for all their love, he never told\nher the truth. But that was not the only reason I cried. I cried, because I\nfinally understood. I cried, relieved that I was not punished by the Gods after\nall, that I was not some monster with unholy desires, that I would be allowed\nto love you.\u201d</p><p>She felt\nthe heat in her face, her heart suddenly light and full of joy. She smiled at\nhim and saw a smile creep on his face.</p><p>\u201cI still\ndon\u2019t see how this makes you laugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon, don\u2019t\nyou see? My father did not love my mother when he married her and yet he never sired\na bastard, but he did not tell her the truth. And you love me, and yet you slept\nwith another woman, your aunt on top of that, and yet you told me the truth.\nTell me, you do see that this is funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit,\nperhaps. You are not angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could\nI be? You did not know, Jon, you did not know! But now, the truth has set us\nfree.\u201d</p><p>Boldly she\nstepped closer to him, into the shadow of the red leaves. \u201cI do think, that honesty\nis a good beginning.\u201d</p><p>She\nhesitated only for a short moment, and then she touched her lips to his, shyly at\nfirst. The ice dagger vanished completely, when Jon\u2019s arms went around her. He\nanswered her kiss, ardently and with passion, pressing his lips to hers. Sansa\nfelt a rush of warmth, of heat even and then she tasted him. His mouth tasted sweet,\nintoxicating, and she knew her senses had waited for this, his warmth near to\nher body, his smell in her nose, the red leaves throwing dancing shadows on them\nand the sound of this breath when they finally broke their kiss.</p><p>Jon pressed\nhimself close to her and whispered in her ear. </p><p>\u201cDid you\ntell Ghost about loving me? Or was that a dream I conjured up when I was close\nto death beyond the wall?\u201d</p><p>Sansa suppressed\na giggle. \u201cThat traitorous wolf. He was supposed to keep this a secret.\u201d </p><p>Then she felt\nherself blush. \u201cDid you warg into him? Did you perchance hear everything I\nsaid?\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything if you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nburied her face in his shoulders. \u201cAs long as it stays between you, me and\nGhost.\u201d She didn\u2019t even know where she got the courage to say that.</p><p>Jon kissed\nher again, pressing her close to himself, his hands on the small of her back. When\nthey broke apart again, Sansa took a deep breath. Finally, she felt that all\nthe ice in her lungs had retreated to make room for the brisk, but fresh air. She\ninhaled deeply.</p><p>\u201cCan I take\nthis as a yes, Lady Sansa?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>She nodded.\nHer eyes felt with tears and she laughed again. \u201cI always thought I would only\nbe married for my claim, never for love.\u201d</p><p>She took\nhis hand in hers. \u201cSince we have discussed marriage in abundance, we should\nprobably return to discuss the less difficult subjects and inform the council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t\nwe pretend to have long and hard negotiations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly\ndo you mean by that, your Grace?\u201d Sansa asked. \u201cDo explain this to me, a\nbackward Northern girl, what do they mean in the South when they say\nnegotiations?\u201d</p><p>Jon blushed.\n</p><p><i>I must remember that. </i>She smiled.</p><p>They went\nback to the castle, their steps light, it was only shortly before they entered\nagain, that Sansa tugged at Jon\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d, she\nasked, blushing.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is\nour secret, isn\u2019t it? Mine and yours and Ghost\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we\nare happy about this marriage?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nnodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try\nto be my usual brooding self,\u201d he smiled. \u201cBut anyone with eyes can see that\nyou are radiant and beautiful, Sansa.\u201d</p><p>He gave her\na quick kiss on her cheek.</p>",

He\u2019ll probably tell me\nit is all politics, that he needs this marriage. But he cares for me, he might\nlearn to love me.</i> She\nalmost giggled. <i>He will give me a choice,\nand this shows me he cares for me, and that he might learn to love me. More men\nshould realise that this is the best opening for a proposal. Just leave the\nlady a choice.</i></p><p>When they\nreached the weirwood, Jon\u2019s determination suddenly faltered. He had let go of\nher elbow and touched the stem of the tree, the red leaves painting dancing\nshadows on his face.</p><p>He looked\nat her face, searchingly, while Sansa tried to control her breathing. <i>I don\u2019t want him to be frightened. I should\nstay calm.</i> But she could feel her cheeks burning and felt vulnerable and exposed\nas if Jon could see all her secret desires. Unbidden she thought about the\nnight, when she had poured her heart out to Ghost\u2019s ears. She chided herself. <i>Thinking about that won\u2019t help.</i></p><p>Finally,\nJon opened his mouth, and barked an embarrassed laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to\nstart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\nthe subject of our conversation was a given.\u201d Sansa remarked.</p><p>Jon flushed.</p><p>She laid her\nhand on his arm, even though her head told her to be more careful and guard her\nheart. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nJon, I couldn\u2019t help myself. Why don\u2019t you start with this proposal and\u2026 then\nwe proceed to the easier problems like the White Walkers?\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled\nwanly. \u201cYou want me to start with the most difficult?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI might\nhave blundered,\u201d he said and then he grimaced. \u201cNo, I blundered. I made a mess\nabout the negotiatins with Daenerys.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nlooked at him, confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. It was Daenerys who read your\nletters and then changed her terms for an alliance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\ndidn\u2019t tell the whole truth at the council. There is something you must know\nabout why the alliance with Daenerys failed, and I must tell you and I don\u2019t\nknow how.\u201d He sucked in a deep breath. \u201cI was so confused\u2026 and heart-broken and\nI acted rashly without thinking and if it had not been for Davos, I might have\ndied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nJon, this doesn\u2019t make any sense to me? You talk in riddles.\u201d Her dread clearly\nhad the upper hand now, an ice-cold hand at the small of her back that stole the\nwarmth from her body and filled her lungs. She breathed shallowly.</p><p>Jon\nsearched her face, he must have heard the strain in her voice. \u201cSansa, I\u2026.\u201d he\nbegan and stopped himself again.</p><p>He gave her\na lopsided grin. \u201cI\u2019m so unsure, if I should start with what will probably make\nyou very angry and might hurt you or what might be welcome, maybe\u2026.\u201d</p><p><i>What does he mean?</i> She shivered and then decided to be brave. \u201cJust\nget it over with, Jon. I have no idea, what you are talking about. Maybe start with\nthe worst.\u201d She braced herself. </p><p>\u201cI thought\nyou were to marry Sweetrobin or even worse Littlefinger.\u201d He stopped again.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she\ntried to coax him.</p><p>\u201cI left\nthat out just now. I \u2026\u201d He inhaled slowly and then it all come out in a rush. \u201cI\nthought that I had to make a marriage alliance as well. I planned to marry Daenerys\nto get that alliance, to save Winterfell, you all. I would probably be married\nby now, if Daenerys hadn\u2019t read these letters and Sam hadn\u2019t found me with the\nnews about my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon, I gathered\nthat much at the council.\u201d <i>Why is he so\nagitated?</i> </p><p>Then it hit\nher. \u201cOh Jon, have you fallen for her?\u201d The ice blade of her dread crept up to\nher shoulders. She felt sorry for him and at the same time, despair washed over\nher. <i>He still left her and came here to\nsave us, to save Winterfell. </i>That was the tiny voice of her hope, small but\ninsistent.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d\nJon protested. \u201cbut I slept with her and she could only read my letters because\nshe went through my clothing.\u201d</p><p>Sansa felt as\nif the breath was knocked out of her lungs. She was unable to say anything. Jon\nlooked at her with desperate and pleading eyes, she didn\u2019t quite know what it\nwas he wanted. <i>My forgiveness? For what?</i></p><p>\u201cWhy were\nthe letters in your clothes?\u201d, she asked finally, this tiny riddle somehow\nbegging to be solved.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\nwanted them close to my heart,\u201d Jon whispered almost inaudibly. </p><p>\u201cClose to\nyour heart?\u201d she repeated. The icy dagger retreated from her shoulder blades,\nas if her body had understood what her brain had not yet grasped. A ray of sunshine\nfell through the red leaves of the weirwood and danced on Jon\u2019s head, giving\nhis black hair a sheen.</p><p>\u201cYour\nletter, where you told me that you miss me, I thought that would be the only\nthing I could ever have.\u201d Jon\u2019s voice was still very low.</p><p>He took her\nhand and she immediately felt the warmth of his hand, welcome, familiar and\nnew. The warmth spread from her hand to her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI love you\nso much, Sansa. I left Winterfell to battle my feelings, but to no avail. I\nknew I had no right, and yet I was so deperate about Lord Royce\u2019s letter. I was\nnot thinking clearly.\u201d</p><p>His thumb\nstroked hers, and he looked into her eyes. \u201cI am still not thinking clearly. I\ncan hardly believe, that I can tell you how I feel. That I am your cousin, free\nto love you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa could\nnot help herself, a warm bubble of laughter somehow rose in her throat.</p><p>Jon looked\nat her, suddenly shy and uncertain. He dropped her hand.</p><p>But Sansa boldly\ntook his hand again and held on to it, craving his warmth. </p><p>\u201cYou\navoided me, the woman you thought your sister and slept with your aunt. You thought\nI would wed another and were ready to sacrifice yourself, thinking you could\nnever tell me how you feel.\u201d She had to laugh again.</p><p>Jon looked\nat her, still uncertain. She would have to find the words to make him\nunderstand.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she\nsaid, trying to put all her love in this one word. \u201cJon, when Bran told me that\nyou are Lyanna\u2019s son, I cried. I cried so hard! Do you know why?\u201d</p><p>Jon shook\nhis head.</p><p>\u201cWhen Arya\nasked me, I told her that I cried for father and mother, that my mother never\nknew that father did not sire a bastard. That for all their love, he never told\nher the truth. But that was not the only reason I cried. I cried, because I\nfinally understood. I cried, relieved that I was not punished by the Gods after\nall, that I was not some monster with unholy desires, that I would be allowed\nto love you.\u201d</p><p>She felt\nthe heat in her face, her heart suddenly light and full of joy. She smiled at\nhim and saw a smile creep on his face.</p><p>\u201cI still\ndon\u2019t see how this makes you laugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon, don\u2019t\nyou see? My father did not love my mother when he married her and yet he never sired\na bastard, but he did not tell her the truth. And you love me, and yet you slept\nwith another woman, your aunt on top of that, and yet you told me the truth.\nTell me, you do see that this is funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit,\nperhaps. You are not angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could\nI be? You did not know, Jon, you did not know! But now, the truth has set us\nfree.\u201d</p><p>Boldly she\nstepped closer to him, into the shadow of the red leaves. \u201cI do think, that honesty\nis a good beginning.\u201d</p><p>She\nhesitated only for a short moment, and then she touched her lips to his, shyly at\nfirst. The ice dagger vanished completely, when Jon\u2019s arms went around her. He\nanswered her kiss, ardently and with passion, pressing his lips to hers. Sansa\nfelt a rush of warmth, of heat even and then she tasted him. His mouth tasted sweet,\nintoxicating, and she knew her senses had waited for this, his warmth near to\nher body, his smell in her nose, the red leaves throwing dancing shadows on them\nand the sound of this breath when they finally broke their kiss.</p><p>Jon pressed\nhimself close to her and whispered in her ear. </p><p>\u201cDid you\ntell Ghost about loving me? Or was that a dream I conjured up when I was close\nto death beyond the wall?\u201d</p><p>Sansa suppressed\na giggle. \u201cThat traitorous wolf. He was supposed to keep this a secret.\u201d </p><p>Then she felt\nherself blush. \u201cDid you warg into him? Did you perchance hear everything I\nsaid?\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything if you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nburied her face in his shoulders. \u201cAs long as it stays between you, me and\nGhost.\u201d She didn\u2019t even know where she got the courage to say that.</p><p>Jon kissed\nher again, pressing her close to himself, his hands on the small of her back. When\nthey broke apart again, Sansa took a deep breath. Finally, she felt that all\nthe ice in her lungs had retreated to make room for the brisk, but fresh air. She\ninhaled deeply.</p><p>\u201cCan I take\nthis as a yes, Lady Sansa?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>She nodded.\nHer eyes felt with tears and she laughed again. \u201cI always thought I would only\nbe married for my claim, never for love.\u201d</p><p>She took\nhis hand in hers. \u201cSince we have discussed marriage in abundance, we should\nprobably return to discuss the less difficult subjects and inform the council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t\nwe pretend to have long and hard negotiations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly\ndo you mean by that, your Grace?\u201d Sansa asked. \u201cDo explain this to me, a\nbackward Northern girl, what do they mean in the South when they say\nnegotiations?\u201d</p><p>Jon blushed.\n</p><p><i>I must remember that. </i>She smiled.</p><p>They went\nback to the castle, their steps light, it was only shortly before they entered\nagain, that Sansa tugged at Jon\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d, she\nasked, blushing.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is\nour secret, isn\u2019t it? Mine and yours and Ghost\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we\nare happy about this marriage?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nnodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try\nto be my usual brooding self,\u201d he smiled. \u201cBut anyone with eyes can see that\nyou are radiant and beautiful, Sansa.\u201d</p><p>He gave her\na quick kiss on her cheek.</p>",

                "content": "<p>So, I finally reached the point where Jon and Sansa can talk freely&hellip;. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/40766213\">AO3</a>. <br /></p><p>Her boots made\nthe snow crunch. Jon had taken her by the elbow and had steered her outside. He\nwas leading them to the godswood with determined strides. <i>He wants an honest answer. That is why he wants to talk at the godswood. <br /></i></p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s pulse\nbeat like a hammer in her ears. She was filled with dread and hope at the same\ntime. When Jon had looked at her, his gaze had set her blood on fire. Her hope\nhad soared. But her fear had been ice cold on her back as well. The fear that\nthis was just politics. She felt as if she could not breathe properly, as if anything\nmore than a shallow breath would break the fragile balance in her veins and\nmake her collapse. As if only the topmost part of her lungs was able to\nbreathe, the rest was filled with ice. Still, white mist formed at her mouth,\nso she must be breathing. She loved him so much. Everyone was talking over her\nhead about her claim, her fate, and he was the one who wanted her answer. </p><p><i>I will say yes, anyway. He&rsquo;ll probably tell me\nit is all politics, that he needs this marriage. But he cares for me, he might\nlearn to love me.</i> She\nalmost giggled. <i>He will give me a choice,\nand this shows me he cares for me, and that he might learn to love me. More men\nshould realise that this is the best opening for a proposal. Just leave the\nlady a choice.</i></p><p>When they\nreached the weirwood, Jon&rsquo;s determination suddenly faltered. He had let go of\nher elbow and touched the stem of the tree, the red leaves painting dancing\nshadows on his face.</p><p>He looked\nat her face, searchingly, while Sansa tried to control her breathing. <i>I don&rsquo;t want him to be frightened. I should\nstay calm.</i> But she could feel her cheeks burning and felt vulnerable and exposed\nas if Jon could see all her secret desires. Unbidden she thought about the\nnight, when she had poured her heart out to Ghost&rsquo;s ears. She chided herself. <i>Thinking about that won&rsquo;t help.</i></p><p>Finally,\nJon opened his mouth, and barked an embarrassed laugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where to\nstart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought\nthe subject of our conversation was a given.&rdquo; Sansa remarked.</p><p>Jon flushed.</p><p>She laid her\nhand on his arm, even though her head told her to be more careful and guard her\nheart. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry\nJon, I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. Why don&rsquo;t you start with this proposal and&hellip; then\nwe proceed to the easier problems like the White Walkers?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon smiled\nwanly. &ldquo;You want me to start with the most difficult?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I might\nhave blundered,&rdquo; he said and then he grimaced. &ldquo;No, I blundered. I made a mess\nabout the negotiatins with Daenerys.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa\nlooked at him, confused. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. It was Daenerys who read your\nletters and then changed her terms for an alliance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I\ndidn&rsquo;t tell the whole truth at the council. There is something you must know\nabout why the alliance with Daenerys failed, and I must tell you and I don&rsquo;t\nknow how.&rdquo; He sucked in a deep breath. &ldquo;I was so confused&hellip; and heart-broken and\nI acted rashly without thinking and if it had not been for Davos, I might have\ndied.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry\nJon, this doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me? You talk in riddles.&rdquo; Her dread clearly\nhad the upper hand now, an ice-cold hand at the small of her back that stole the\nwarmth from her body and filled her lungs. She breathed shallowly.</p><p>Jon\nsearched her face, he must have heard the strain in her voice. &ldquo;Sansa, I&hellip;.&rdquo; he\nbegan and stopped himself again.</p><p>He gave her\na lopsided grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so unsure, if I should start with what will probably make\nyou very angry and might hurt you or what might be welcome, maybe&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p><i>What does he mean?</i> She shivered and then decided to be brave. &ldquo;Just\nget it over with, Jon. I have no idea, what you are talking about. Maybe start with\nthe worst.&rdquo; She braced herself. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought\nyou were to marry Sweetrobin or even worse Littlefinger.&rdquo; He stopped again.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she\ntried to coax him.</p><p>&ldquo;I left\nthat out just now. I &hellip;&rdquo; He inhaled slowly and then it all come out in a rush. &ldquo;I\nthought that I had to make a marriage alliance as well. I planned to marry Daenerys\nto get that alliance, to save Winterfell, you all. I would probably be married\nby now, if Daenerys hadn&rsquo;t read these letters and Sam hadn&rsquo;t found me with the\nnews about my parents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon, I gathered\nthat much at the council.&rdquo; <i>Why is he so\nagitated?</i> </p><p>Then it hit\nher. &ldquo;Oh Jon, have you fallen for her?&rdquo; The ice blade of her dread crept up to\nher shoulders. She felt sorry for him and at the same time, despair washed over\nher. <i>He still left her and came here to\nsave us, to save Winterfell. </i>That was the tiny voice of her hope, small but\ninsistent.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo;\nJon protested. &ldquo;but I slept with her and she could only read my letters because\nshe went through my clothing.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa felt as\nif the breath was knocked out of her lungs. She was unable to say anything. Jon\nlooked at her with desperate and pleading eyes, she didn&rsquo;t quite know what it\nwas he wanted. <i>My forgiveness? For what?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Why were\nthe letters in your clothes?&rdquo;, she asked finally, this tiny riddle somehow\nbegging to be solved.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I\nwanted them close to my heart,&rdquo; Jon whispered almost inaudibly. </p><p>&ldquo;Close to\nyour heart?&rdquo; she repeated. The icy dagger retreated from her shoulder blades,\nas if her body had understood what her brain had not yet grasped. A ray of sunshine\nfell through the red leaves of the weirwood and danced on Jon&rsquo;s head, giving\nhis black hair a sheen.</p><p>&ldquo;Your\nletter, where you told me that you miss me, I thought that would be the only\nthing I could ever have.&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s voice was still very low.</p><p>He took her\nhand and she immediately felt the warmth of his hand, welcome, familiar and\nnew. The warmth spread from her hand to her shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you\nso much, Sansa. I left Winterfell to battle my feelings, but to no avail. I\nknew I had no right, and yet I was so deperate about Lord Royce&rsquo;s letter. I was\nnot thinking clearly.&rdquo;</p><p>His thumb\nstroked hers, and he looked into her eyes. &ldquo;I am still not thinking clearly. I\ncan hardly believe, that I can tell you how I feel. That I am your cousin, free\nto love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa could\nnot help herself, a warm bubble of laughter somehow rose in her throat.</p><p>Jon looked\nat her, suddenly shy and uncertain. He dropped her hand.</p><p>But Sansa boldly\ntook his hand again and held on to it, craving his warmth. </p><p>&ldquo;You\navoided me, the woman you thought your sister and slept with your aunt. You thought\nI would wed another and were ready to sacrifice yourself, thinking you could\nnever tell me how you feel.&rdquo; She had to laugh again.</p><p>Jon looked\nat her, still uncertain. She would have to find the words to make him\nunderstand.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she\nsaid, trying to put all her love in this one word. &ldquo;Jon, when Bran told me that\nyou are Lyanna&rsquo;s son, I cried. I cried so hard! Do you know why?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon shook\nhis head.</p><p>&ldquo;When Arya\nasked me, I told her that I cried for father and mother, that my mother never\nknew that father did not sire a bastard. That for all their love, he never told\nher the truth. But that was not the only reason I cried. I cried, because I\nfinally understood. I cried, relieved that I was not punished by the Gods after\nall, that I was not some monster with unholy desires, that I would be allowed\nto love you.&rdquo;</p><p>She felt\nthe heat in her face, her heart suddenly light and full of joy. She smiled at\nhim and saw a smile creep on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;I still\ndon&rsquo;t see how this makes you laugh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon, don&rsquo;t\nyou see? My father did not love my mother when he married her and yet he never sired\na bastard, but he did not tell her the truth. And you love me, and yet you slept\nwith another woman, your aunt on top of that, and yet you told me the truth.\nTell me, you do see that this is funny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A bit,\nperhaps. You are not angry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How could\nI be? You did not know, Jon, you did not know! But now, the truth has set us\nfree.&rdquo;</p><p>Boldly she\nstepped closer to him, into the shadow of the red leaves. &ldquo;I do think, that honesty\nis a good beginning.&rdquo;</p><p>She\nhesitated only for a short moment, and then she touched her lips to his, shyly at\nfirst. The ice dagger vanished completely, when Jon&rsquo;s arms went around her. He\nanswered her kiss, ardently and with passion, pressing his lips to hers. Sansa\nfelt a rush of warmth, of heat even and then she tasted him. His mouth tasted sweet,\nintoxicating, and she knew her senses had waited for this, his warmth near to\nher body, his smell in her nose, the red leaves throwing dancing shadows on them\nand the sound of this breath when they finally broke their kiss.</p><p>Jon pressed\nhimself close to her and whispered in her ear. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you\ntell Ghost about loving me?

        "answer": "<p>This is another one of these asks that I have been looking at for days not knowing how to answer it. As much as\u00a0\u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019 is an interesting concept to explore, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as likely to happen as many seem to believe but I completely understand why people want it to happen so much and there is definitely lines and events in the story that support it. People want it because as much as many don\u2019t think it fits with Jon\u2019s character, the story has presented the need for Jon to be smarter than his father and brother, and essentially to not repeat the same mistakes they did. Ned was blinded by his honor and stumbled down because of it, and Robb was blinded by love and stumbled down. If\u00a0\u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019 isn\u2019t happening right now, it ultimately means that there is no learning curve. Jon is just making most of his decisions based on the things that got both his father and brother killed (His honor is presented as being the reason for most of his decisions, and his\u00a0\u2018\u2019love\u2019\u2019 for Daenerys led him to give her the North even though she showed no proof of being a capable ruler, and has already stated her wish to fight the white walkers). In theory, we should be seeing Jon be more politically aware than these who came before him, and make better and smarter decisions. However, we aren\u2019t\u2026and that can be frustrating for a lot of people who are into his character arc. So, they designed a theory that blatantly showcases him actively going a step further than his brother and father.\u00a0</p><p>However, that isn\u2019t the only reason some people would want\u00a0\u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019. A lot of people who are into this theory pair Sansa and Jon together and the quickest way for them to get together  at this point is for Jon to not be truly in love with Daenerys, and actually be manipulating her. That would mean that Jon being into Sansa since they reunited is still possible. There\u2019s not enough time for their relationship to go from familial to romantic, but there is enough time for it to go from romantic but in denial (and present in subtexts only) to just romantic. Like\u2026.there\u2019s a limited amount of episodes, so him being deeply in love with someone, than having a bunch of shit go down, and then be put with another character who he thought was his sibling at the end just won\u2019t seem convincing to anyone. Therefore, \u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019 only makes Jonsa more possible and palatable. That is the reason, much to the annoyance of a lot of Jonsa fans, that people instantly dismiss\u00a0\u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019 and even\u00a0\u2018\u2019Dark!Dany\u2019\u2019 as Jonsa theories because these are ideas that actively make it more possible for Jon to end up with Sansa at the end, even though one of these happening doesn\u2019t mean they all of these would happen. So essentially, the theory that is\u00a0\u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019 was created because it would make Jon a more interesting, complex and better character, and because it would rectify Jon sleeping with Dany as being non-romantic, which is kinda needed for Jonsa to happen in a satisfying manner.\u00a0</p><p>So with all of that being said, is\u00a0\u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019 likely to happen? Well\u2026there is some base to it. Facts are that the story presented Ned Stark\u2019s extreme honor and Jon replicating it as being a bad thing. The narrative essentially showed that it was a bad thing through Ned Stark\u2019s arc in season one, where he would have prevailed at least the challenges he had to face if it wasn\u2019t for his extreme values. Then, at different point in the story, we had characters point to Jon that him inheriting his father\u2019s honor isn\u2019t that much of a good thing (Stannis Baratheon and Sansa Stark more specifically). They both make it clear that honor is what got his father killed. So, if Jon doesn\u2019t learn from his father\u2019s mistakes and manages to stay alive at the end\u2026.then that means that the story is contradicting itself, and if he dies, then there\u2019s no substantial message beyond what initially happened with his father. Both cases are just quite unsatisfactory narratively and thematically speaking. There has to be something more. There\u2019s also the fact that we\u2019ve seen him get with someone with the goal of fitting in better with the wildlings who he was trying to spy on. That wasn\u2019t honorable at all, and while he did fall in love with that character progressively, his initial motivation was still present. He\u2019s been shown to do that kind of stuff in order to protect what he needs to protect (I\u2019m not referring to boatsex by the way, just the general idea of \u2018\u2019Political!Jon vs his past acts). The only difference, and that\u2019s an important one for his character, is that the first time, it was something he was ordered to do by someone else, whereas the second time (if Political!Jon is turns out to be true), he\u2019s the one to do it himself, and it\u2019s in that fact that lies the learning curve.\u00a0His character is even linked with the wildlings, who in theory had an impact on him. Tormund at one point even states\u00a0\u2018\u2019You\u2019ve spent too much time with us. You can never be a kneeler again.\u2019\u2019. Then later on in the story, Daenerys asks Jon\u00a0\u2018\u2019If their survival is more important than your pride?\u2019\u2019, which is ironically something that Jon asked Mance Raider a while back, and here was Mance\u2019s answer:\u00a0\u2018\u2019Pride? Fuck my pride. It isn\u2019t about that. They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king, it\u2019s all gone.\u2019\u2019. Then, if you just think at everyone who died in order for the North to achieve independence and all these who died to get the North back from the Bolton, it only makes the fact that it belongs to the Starks that much more important. To have Jon give it to some stranger who he barely knows who has shown time and again to be incapable is just\u2026it essentially undermines all that he went through and all that he should have in theory learned the past few seasons becomes kinda meaningless. There\u2019s even the whole thing with how everything before the word but is bullshit, and then you have Jon \u2018\u2019coincidentally\u2019\u2019 putting the word \u2018\u2019but\u2019\u2019 right after saying he\u2019ll bend the knee to Daenerys.</p><p>And that\u2019s not even going on about how the romance between Jon and Daenerys remains completely unconvincing. If the actors and writers were trying to present this whole mess as them starting to like each other, I might have come around to the idea of it being played straight, but in reality, we have different actors talking about how they are in love with each other, and they can\u2019t even be consistent when talking about the moment they supposedly started loving the other. Jon and Dany legitimately know very little about each other. There\u2019s nothing concrete about their\u00a0\u2018love\u2019\u2019. There\u2019s a quote that I fell in love with from another book talking about how many boys will bring you flowers, but the one that truly matters is the one who knows your favorite flower, your favorite song, and your favorite sweet. Sis doesn\u2019t even know that she executed the family of his best friend. Jokes aside, they know only the most superficial and general details about each other. The problem is that they had actual time to make a convincing romance. Robb and Talisa met in 2x04 before getting married in 2x10, and I was convinced that Robb was into her the second he looked at her. I didn\u2019t even know I was supposed to look at Daenerys and Jon through a romantic lens until Davos and Tyrion pointed out him looking intensely at her, which is something that could be used to prove that he dislikes her just as much as it could prove that he likes her.

Moments where they could make Jonerys the least bit romantic weren\u2019t written into the story.

Even in promotional pictures, there\u2019s not even the slightest romantic vibe. We\u2019ve seen the actor play a character in love, and it showed in every single one of their scenes through the writing and the acting.

            "comment": "<p>This is another one of these asks that I have been looking at for days not knowing how to answer it. As much as\u00a0\u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019 is an interesting concept to explore, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as likely to happen as many seem to believe but I completely understand why people want it to happen so much and there is definitely lines and events in the story that support it. People want it because as much as many don\u2019t think it fits with Jon\u2019s character, the story has presented the need for Jon to be smarter than his father and brother, and essentially to not repeat the same mistakes they did. Ned was blinded by his honor and stumbled down because of it, and Robb was blinded by love and stumbled down. If\u00a0\u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019 isn\u2019t happening right now, it ultimately means that there is no learning curve. Jon is just making most of his decisions based on the things that got both his father and brother killed (His honor is presented as being the reason for most of his decisions, and his\u00a0\u2018\u2019love\u2019\u2019 for Daenerys led him to give her the North even though she showed no proof of being a capable ruler, and has already stated her wish to fight the white walkers). In theory, we should be seeing Jon be more politically aware than these who came before him, and make better and smarter decisions. However, we aren\u2019t\u2026and that can be frustrating for a lot of people who are into his character arc. So, they designed a theory that blatantly showcases him actively going a step further than his brother and father.\u00a0</p><p>However, that isn\u2019t the only reason some people would want\u00a0\u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019. A lot of people who are into this theory pair Sansa and Jon together and the quickest way for them to get together  at this point is for Jon to not be truly in love with Daenerys, and actually be manipulating her. That would mean that Jon being into Sansa since they reunited is still possible. There\u2019s not enough time for their relationship to go from familial to romantic, but there is enough time for it to go from romantic but in denial (and present in subtexts only) to just romantic. Like\u2026.there\u2019s a limited amount of episodes, so him being deeply in love with someone, than having a bunch of shit go down, and then be put with another character who he thought was his sibling at the end just won\u2019t seem convincing to anyone. Therefore, \u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019 only makes Jonsa more possible and palatable. That is the reason, much to the annoyance of a lot of Jonsa fans, that people instantly dismiss\u00a0\u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019 and even\u00a0\u2018\u2019Dark!Dany\u2019\u2019 as Jonsa theories because these are ideas that actively make it more possible for Jon to end up with Sansa at the end, even though one of these happening doesn\u2019t mean they all of these would happen. So essentially, the theory that is\u00a0\u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019 was created because it would make Jon a more interesting, complex and better character, and because it would rectify Jon sleeping with Dany as being non-romantic, which is kinda needed for Jonsa to happen in a satisfying manner.\u00a0</p><p>So with all of that being said, is\u00a0\u2018\u2019Political!Jon\u2019\u2019 likely to happen? Well\u2026there is some base to it. Facts are that the story presented Ned Stark\u2019s extreme honor and Jon replicating it as being a bad thing. The narrative essentially showed that it was a bad thing through Ned Stark\u2019s arc in season one, where he would have prevailed at least the challenges he had to face if it wasn\u2019t for his extreme values. Then, at different point in the story, we had characters point to Jon that him inheriting his father\u2019s honor isn\u2019t that much of a good thing (Stannis Baratheon and Sansa Stark more specifically). They both make it clear that honor is what got his father killed. So, if Jon doesn\u2019t learn from his father\u2019s mistakes and manages to stay alive at the end\u2026.then that means that the story is contradicting itself, and if he dies, then there\u2019s no substantial message beyond what initially happened with his father. Both cases are just quite unsatisfactory narratively and thematically speaking. There has to be something more. There\u2019s also the fact that we\u2019ve seen him get with someone with the goal of fitting in better with the wildlings who he was trying to spy on. That wasn\u2019t honorable at all, and while he did fall in love with that character progressively, his initial motivation was still present. He\u2019s been shown to do that kind of stuff in order to protect what he needs to protect (I\u2019m not referring to boatsex by the way, just the general idea of \u2018\u2019Political!Jon vs his past acts). The only difference, and that\u2019s an important one for his character, is that the first time, it was something he was ordered to do by someone else, whereas the second time (if Political!Jon is turns out to be true), he\u2019s the one to do it himself, and it\u2019s in that fact that lies the learning curve.\u00a0His character is even linked with the wildlings, who in theory had an impact on him. Tormund at one point even states\u00a0\u2018\u2019You\u2019ve spent too much time with us. You can never be a kneeler again.\u2019\u2019. Then later on in the story, Daenerys asks Jon\u00a0\u2018\u2019If their survival is more important than your pride?\u2019\u2019, which is ironically something that Jon asked Mance Raider a while back, and here was Mance\u2019s answer:\u00a0\u2018\u2019Pride? Fuck my pride. It isn\u2019t about that. They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king, it\u2019s all gone.\u2019\u2019. Then, if you just think at everyone who died in order for the North to achieve independence and all these who died to get the North back from the Bolton, it only makes the fact that it belongs to the Starks that much more important. To have Jon give it to some stranger who he barely knows who has shown time and again to be incapable is just\u2026it essentially undermines all that he went through and all that he should have in theory learned the past few seasons becomes kinda meaningless. There\u2019s even the whole thing with how everything before the word but is bullshit, and then you have Jon \u2018\u2019coincidentally\u2019\u2019 putting the word \u2018\u2019but\u2019\u2019 right after saying he\u2019ll bend the knee to Daenerys.</p><p>And that\u2019s not even going on about how the romance between Jon and Daenerys remains completely unconvincing. If the actors and writers were trying to present this whole mess as them starting to like each other, I might have come around to the idea of it being played straight, but in reality, we have different actors talking about how they are in love with each other, and they can\u2019t even be consistent when talking about the moment they supposedly started loving the other. Jon and Dany legitimately know very little about each other. There\u2019s nothing concrete about their\u00a0\u2018love\u2019\u2019. There\u2019s a quote that I fell in love with from another book talking about how many boys will bring you flowers, but the one that truly matters is the one who knows your favorite flower, your favorite song, and your favorite sweet. Sis doesn\u2019t even know that she executed the family of his best friend. Jokes aside, they know only the most superficial and general details about each other. The problem is that they had actual time to make a convincing romance. Robb and Talisa met in 2x04 before getting married in 2x10, and I was convinced that Robb was into her the second he looked at her. I didn\u2019t even know I was supposed to look at Daenerys and Jon through a romantic lens until Davos and Tyrion pointed out him looking intensely at her, which is something that could be used to prove that he dislikes her just as much as it could prove that he likes her. Despite needing as much time to happen as other GOT romances, for some reason, none of their scenes together seemed the least bit romantic, and I found that odd. Moments where they could make Jonerys the least bit romantic weren\u2019t written into the story.

That is the reason, much to the annoyance of a lot of Jonsa fans, that people instantly dismiss&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;Political!Jon&rsquo;&rsquo; and even&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;Dark!Dany&rsquo;&rsquo; as Jonsa theories because these are ideas that actively make it more possible for Jon to end up with Sansa at the end, even though one of these happening doesn&rsquo;t mean they all of these would happen. So essentially, the theory that is&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;Political!Jon&rsquo;&rsquo; was created because it would make Jon a more interesting, complex and better character, and because it would rectify Jon sleeping with Dany as being non-romantic, which is kinda needed for Jonsa to happen in a satisfying manner.&nbsp;</p><p>So with all of that being said, is&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;Political!Jon&rsquo;&rsquo; likely to happen? Well&hellip;there is some base to it. Facts are that the story presented Ned Stark&rsquo;s extreme honor and Jon replicating it as being a bad thing. The narrative essentially showed that it was a bad thing through Ned Stark&rsquo;s arc in season one, where he would have prevailed at least the challenges he had to face if it wasn&rsquo;t for his extreme values. Then, at different point in the story, we had characters point to Jon that him inheriting his father&rsquo;s honor isn&rsquo;t that much of a good thing (Stannis Baratheon and Sansa Stark more specifically). They both make it clear that honor is what got his father killed. So, if Jon doesn&rsquo;t learn from his father&rsquo;s mistakes and manages to stay alive at the end&hellip;.then that means that the story is contradicting itself, and if he dies, then there&rsquo;s no substantial message beyond what initially happened with his father. Both cases are just quite unsatisfactory narratively and thematically speaking. There has to be something more. There&rsquo;s also the fact that we&rsquo;ve seen him get with someone with the goal of fitting in better with the wildlings who he was trying to spy on. That wasn&rsquo;t honorable at all, and while he did fall in love with that character progressively, his initial motivation was still present. He&rsquo;s been shown to do that kind of stuff in order to protect what he needs to protect (I&rsquo;m not referring to boatsex by the way, just the general idea of &lsquo;&rsquo;Political!Jon vs his past acts). The only difference, and that&rsquo;s an important one for his character, is that the first time, it was something he was ordered to do by someone else, whereas the second time (if Political!Jon is turns out to be true), he&rsquo;s the one to do it himself, and it&rsquo;s in that fact that lies the learning curve.&nbsp;His character is even linked with the wildlings, who in theory had an impact on him. Tormund at one point even states&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;You&rsquo;ve spent too much time with us. You can never be a kneeler again.&rsquo;&rsquo;. Then later on in the story, Daenerys asks Jon&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;If their survival is more important than your pride?&rsquo;&rsquo;, which is ironically something that Jon asked Mance Raider a while back, and here was Mance&rsquo;s answer:&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;Pride? Fuck my pride. It isn&rsquo;t about that. They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king, it&rsquo;s all gone.&rsquo;&rsquo;. Then, if you just think at everyone who died in order for the North to achieve independence and all these who died to get the North back from the Bolton, it only makes the fact that it belongs to the Starks that much more important. To have Jon give it to some stranger who he barely knows who has shown time and again to be incapable is just&hellip;it essentially undermines all that he went through and all that he should have in theory learned the past few seasons becomes kinda meaningless. There&rsquo;s even the whole thing with how everything before the word but is bullshit, and then you have Jon &lsquo;&rsquo;coincidentally&rsquo;&rsquo; putting the word &lsquo;&rsquo;but&rsquo;&rsquo; right after saying he&rsquo;ll bend the knee to Daenerys.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s not even going on about how the romance between Jon and Daenerys remains completely unconvincing. If the actors and writers were trying to present this whole mess as them starting to like each other, I might have come around to the idea of it being played straight, but in reality, we have different actors talking about how they are in love with each other, and they can&rsquo;t even be consistent when talking about the moment they supposedly started loving the other. Jon and Dany legitimately know very little about each other. There&rsquo;s nothing concrete about their&nbsp;&lsquo;love&rsquo;&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s a quote that I fell in love with from another book talking about how many boys will bring you flowers, but the one that truly matters is the one who knows your favorite flower, your favorite song, and your favorite sweet. Sis doesn&rsquo;t even know that she executed the family of his best friend. Jokes aside, they know only the most superficial and general details about each other. The problem is that they had actual time to make a convincing romance. Robb and Talisa met in 2x04 before getting married in 2x10, and I was convinced that Robb was into her the second he looked at her. I didn&rsquo;t even know I was supposed to look at Daenerys and Jon through a romantic lens until Davos and Tyrion pointed out him looking intensely at her, which is something that could be used to prove that he dislikes her just as much as it could prove that he likes her. Despite needing as much time to happen as other GOT romances, for some reason, none of their scenes together seemed the least bit romantic, and I found that odd. Moments where they could make Jonerys the least bit romantic weren&rsquo;t written into the story. For example, Jon could have looked back at Daenerys before leaving, but he didn&rsquo;t even glance at her for a moment, whereas a man who is shown to be in love with her does. There&rsquo;s also the actor. Kit/Jon legitimately looks as if he founds her to be the most repugnant thing he ever seen in his life. Even in promotional pictures, there&rsquo;s not even the slightest romantic vibe. We&rsquo;ve seen the actor play a character in love, and it showed in every single one of their scenes through the writing and the acting. Here, we have nothing but random lines from other characters and a sex scene with a voiceover going on at the same time about how her brother is his father.&nbsp;</p><p>So, getting back to the question&hellip;do I believe that&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;Political!Jon&rsquo;&rsquo; is as likely as Kit being a bad actor and D&amp;D being mediocre writers? Honestly, I really don&rsquo;t know. However&hellip;Kit isn&rsquo;t the best actor in the show&hellip;but the issues with his actions in the past season don&rsquo;t just boil down to bad acting. If the romance and him giving the north was played straight, it undermines his character arc, it shits on everything that he experienced and learned thus far and it&rsquo;s just proof of clumsy and juvenile writing. So honestly, I&rsquo;m not quite sure what to believe besides the fact that it fixes a lot of what was wrong about his story-line and arc in Season 7.&nbsp;</p>",

That\u2019s not much at all, please have another.\u201d You watched as Joffrey gestured to his table that had a canister of wine on it.

What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year.\u201d Sandor stated leaning over to Joffrey</p><p>Apparently she was going to get out of that hole easily. </p><p>Your brother released a noticeable sigh before waving his hand</p><p>\u201cFine, take him away. I\u2019ll have him killed tomorrow. The fool.\u201d</p><p>Sansa had suggested taking Ser Dantos and making him Joffrey\u2019s new fool. To which Joffrey seemed pretty pleased with. And then Ser Dantos had been taken away. To where? Who knows</p><p>\u201cBeloved Nephew!\u201d</p><p>You knew that voice. Smiling you looked to your right, your uncle Tyrion marching himself over, in the Lannister armor, with another man trailing behind him and what looked to be tribesmen.</p><p>\u201cWe looked for you on the battle field, you where nowhere to be found.\u201d</p><p>Battlefield?</p><p>How long had you been locked in your room for a battle to happen? You assumed the look on your face was obvious seeing as Myrcella just gave you an apologetic smile.</p><p>Your eyes then followed your uncle as he walked to pour himself a glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here, ruling the seven kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>Watching your uncle as he came over to you and Myrcella, a smile gracing his face as he took the two of you in. After months of not seeing each other. Not since you parted ways at Winterfell</p><p>\u201cAnd what a fine job you\u2019ve done.\u201d He said looking to your brother than you and your sister once more.</p><p>\u201cYou two, more beautiful than ever.\u201d</p><p>You watched as he then walked the short distance to your younger brother with a playful smile now on his face \u201cAnd you! You\u2019re going to be bigger than the hound! But much better looking!\u201d You smiled as Tyrion then looked up to the hound pointed and added \u201cThis one doesn\u2019t like me so much\u201d</p><p>The man that had come out shortly after your uncle just smiled wryly before saying \u201cCan\u2019t imagine why\u201d</p><p>You heard Lucia then start to fuss again as her hold on your dress tightened and she let out a small cry</p><p>Looking down you saw her rattle trapped between her chest and other arm which seemed to be causing discomfort. Taking the rattle from her chest she began to calm down again.</p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s this?\u201d </p><p>Looking back up you saw your uncle come over to you and look at the dark haired little girl who\u2019s pale skin didn\u2019t really match up with your own tan skin that was used to the southern weather. </p><p>You gave Tyrion a smile before holding her more at an angle so he could see her.</p><p>\u201cLucia, your grandniece.\u201d You introduced.

Death is so boring, especially with all this excitement going on now.\u201d</p><p>You saw Tyrion then look at Sansa</p><p>\u201cMy Lady, I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>Lucia had gone down for a nap. </p><p>By a nap, you mean she fell asleep on your chest while you had laid down with her. Her arms sprawled out on your chest and her feet barley reaching your belly button. And you could feel her breathing even out, so you had stayed like taking in the new baby smell that you vaguely remember Tommen having when he was born. But this was a smell you felt like you\u2019d always associate with Lucia wether she was a month old or 20 years old. </p><p>You heard the door open, because of those damn hinges that always squeaked more than any other door in the red keep.</p><p>Looking up you saw your mother closing it again and turning to look at you. \u201cWe need to know where the other Stark girl is.\u201d </p><p>Rest your right arm firmly against Lucia\u2019s back and head you sat up to keep her in place on your chest. </p><p>\u201cI told you I don\u2019t know where she is, mother.\u201d You responded grabbing pillows and putting them side by side on the center of the bed and putting Lucia down in between them so she wouldn\u2019t roll off the bed.</p><p>\u201cY/N we need to get your uncle back from the Starks. The only way to do that is if we exchange the girls for him.\u201d</p><p>You remembered the rumors you\u2019d heard right after Ned had been killed. How Joffrey wasn\u2019t heir to the throne because he wasn\u2019t Robert\u2019s child. That Joffrey had been born out of incest. That all four of you, Joffrey, You, Myrcella, and Tommen were really the bastards of Cersei and Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI barley know uncle Jamie. Why do you want to get him back so badly?\u201d You asked turning to your mother with a scowl that was so similar to her\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is uncle Tyrion. But you didn\u2019t try as hard to get Tyrion back like you are for Jamie!\u201d You snapped grabbing onto your bedpost and walking closer to her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors around the castle. About you and uncle Jamie. Disgusting rumors. Rumors I\u2019m starting believe.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThis is the last time i\u2019m going to really be able to talk to you Jon!\u201d You said mere inches from his face, holding his hand with \u00a0your pendant between your hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much, I get that.\u201d You stated your free hand coming up to his face, your three last fingers going behind his ear and your index finger resting at the base of his ear and your thumb stroking his cheek. </p><p>\u201cI love you, there\u2019s nothing that can change that. If a man with a known house to his name and with gold to accompany him came along, I\u2019d choose you. And I know you can\u2019t give me anything to remember you, but as long as I can give you something I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d remember you without this too. I\u2019d remember your face and how a Baratheon woman\u2019s personality was better than her family\u2019s, and she decided to accept a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than a bastard.\u201d</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a></p>",

Huffing you looked down at Lucia again as she started to fuss. She couldn\u2019t be hungry, you\u2019d fed her before you came out, she\u2019d been changed by Miza who had become infatuated with the little girl. Often times just wanting to hold her. Myrcella already seemed to love Lucia and Tommen was fascinated. </p><p>Joffrey couldn\u2019t care less, since she was born a girl. </p><p>\u201cDid you like that?\u201d</p><p>You turned your head to see Joffrey putting Sansa in a difficult situation yet again. He should just leave the poor girl alone already. It was obvious she didn\u2019t want to speak to him.</p><p>\u201cIt was well struck\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already said it was well struck\u201d</p><p>You saw the hesitation on Sansa\u2019s face before she looked back up at your brother</p><p>\u201cYes, your grace\u201d</p><p>You stared daggers into the back of Joffrey\u2019s head as best you could as Lucia\u2019s fussing started to get worse.</p><p>\u201cShut her up will you?\u201d</p><p>Joffrey turned to you before he said it glaring at you as well with those cold, soulless, blue eyes.</p><p>You huffed before turning your attention to Tommen who seemed to be uncomfortable with what was going on. </p><p>\u201cTommen, would you by chance have her rattle?\u201d You asked watching as his attention went to you before he looked around and seemed to have found what you asked before. He looked down at the table next to him picking up the rattle and passing it to you.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d</p><p>You held the rattle over Lucia\u2019s face and gave it a small shake to get her attention. Seemingly her full attention went to the rattle as she started to lift up her right arm slightly to try and get the rattle.</p><p>You lowered the rattle and put it into her hand watching as she just held it to her chest and seemingly calmed down. Okay\u2026She was just bored.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLothor Brune, free rider in the service of Lord Baelish\u201d</p><p>He really was dragging out his name day celebration wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>You set yourself into your own swaying motion as you watched a man come forward from where the announcer had gestured.</p><p>\u201cSer Dontos the Red of House Hollard\u201d</p><p>You looked to the direction that the announcer gestured. No one came forward. Watching as he \u00a0gestured to the other direction </p><p>\u201cSer Dontos the Red of House Hollard\u201d</p><p>Still no one came forward, until you heard;</p><p>\u201cHere I am!\u201d You turned to see him on Sansa\u2019s left, coming down a step and walking over quickly. He was holding his helmet and his weapon tightly yet awkwardly. \u201cHere I am.\u201d He said once more dropping the helmet he was holding. You watched as he scrabbled to get it.</p><p>Was he drunk?</p><p>Seemed like Joffrey had been thinking the same thing as you. Seemingly he\u2019d asked it while you thought it. Ser Dontos took his helmet off and shook his head </p><p>\u201cNo, your grace. I me-mean, I had two cups of wine.\u201d</p><p>He had to be joking. You gave him a skeptical look feeling Lucia\u2019s left arm reach up and grab to the front of your dress. </p><p>\u201cTwo cups? That\u2019s not much at all, please have another.\u201d You watched as Joffrey gestured to his table that had a canister of wine on it. He was going to take this and put some sick twist on it like he always did.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, your grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, to celebrate my name day. Have two, have as much as you\u2019d like!\u201d</p><p>You watched Joffrey look to Ser Meryn, watching as he spoke \u201cSer Meryn, help ser Dontos celebrate my name day, make sure he has his fill.\u201d</p><p>You watched as Ser Meryn and two other king\u2019s guards grabbed Ser Dontos. They took him a few feet away and forced onto his knees. Looking back down at Lucia you saw she was fast asleep even during all this chaos happening. </p><p>Looking back up you saw one of the guards forcing him onto his knees and putting a funnel into his mouth. </p><p>\u201cMay the seven gods have mercy.\u201d You whispered to yourself as another one of the guards started to pour a barrel of wine into the funnel.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>You looked at Sansa to see her staring on in horror.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say? Did you just say I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>How was Sansa going to get out of this hole she dug herself with her own words this time?</p><p>\u201cI only mean\u2026It would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day\u201d</p><p>You smiled at Sansa, hefting your arms up a bit to get Lucia into a more comfortable position for you to hold her. </p><p>\u201cWhat kind of Peasant\u2019s superstitions-\u201c</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, your grace. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year.\u201d Sandor stated leaning over to Joffrey</p><p>Apparently she was going to get out of that hole easily. </p><p>Your brother released a noticeable sigh before waving his hand</p><p>\u201cFine, take him away. I\u2019ll have him killed tomorrow. The fool.\u201d</p><p>Sansa had suggested taking Ser Dantos and making him Joffrey\u2019s new fool. To which Joffrey seemed pretty pleased with. And then Ser Dantos had been taken away. To where? Who knows</p><p>\u201cBeloved Nephew!\u201d</p><p>You knew that voice. Smiling you looked to your right, your uncle Tyrion marching himself over, in the Lannister armor, with another man trailing behind him and what looked to be tribesmen.</p><p>\u201cWe looked for you on the battle field, you where nowhere to be found.\u201d</p><p>Battlefield?</p><p>How long had you been locked in your room for a battle to happen? You assumed the look on your face was obvious seeing as Myrcella just gave you an apologetic smile.</p><p>Your eyes then followed your uncle as he walked to pour himself a glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here, ruling the seven kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>Watching your uncle as he came over to you and Myrcella, a smile gracing his face as he took the two of you in. After months of not seeing each other. Not since you parted ways at Winterfell</p><p>\u201cAnd what a fine job you\u2019ve done.\u201d He said looking to your brother than you and your sister once more.</p><p>\u201cYou two, more beautiful than ever.\u201d</p><p>You watched as he then walked the short distance to your younger brother with a playful smile now on his face \u201cAnd you! You\u2019re going to be bigger than the hound! But much better looking!\u201d You smiled as Tyrion then looked up to the hound pointed and added \u201cThis one doesn\u2019t like me so much\u201d</p><p>The man that had come out shortly after your uncle just smiled wryly before saying \u201cCan\u2019t imagine why\u201d</p><p>You heard Lucia then start to fuss again as her hold on your dress tightened and she let out a small cry</p><p>Looking down you saw her rattle trapped between her chest and other arm which seemed to be causing discomfort. Taking the rattle from her chest she began to calm down again.</p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s this?\u201d </p><p>Looking back up you saw your uncle come over to you and look at the dark haired little girl who\u2019s pale skin didn\u2019t really match up with your own tan skin that was used to the southern weather. </p><p>You gave Tyrion a smile before holding her more at an angle so he could see her.</p><p>\u201cLucia, your grandniece.\u201d You introduced. You could see his facial expression change slightly as you said \u2018grandniece\u2019 </p><p>\u201cYours?\u201d</p><p>You nodded with a proud smile on your face.</p><p>\u201cWe heard you were dead.\u201d Joffrey interrupted. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not dead.\u201d Myrcella interrupted </p><p>\u201cMe, too, my dear. Death is so boring, especially with all this excitement going on now.\u201d</p><p>You saw Tyrion then look at Sansa</p><p>\u201cMy Lady, I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>Lucia had gone down for a nap. </p><p>By a nap, you mean she fell asleep on your chest while you had laid down with her. Her arms sprawled out on your chest and her feet barley reaching your belly button. And you could feel her breathing even out, so you had stayed like taking in the new baby smell that you vaguely remember Tommen having when he was born. But this was a smell you felt like you\u2019d always associate with Lucia wether she was a month old or 20 years old. </p><p>You heard the door open, because of those damn hinges that always squeaked more than any other door in the red keep.</p><p>Looking up you saw your mother closing it again and turning to look at you. \u201cWe need to know where the other Stark girl is.\u201d </p><p>Rest your right arm firmly against Lucia\u2019s back and head you sat up to keep her in place on your chest. </p><p>\u201cI told you I don\u2019t know where she is, mother.\u201d You responded grabbing pillows and putting them side by side on the center of the bed and putting Lucia down in between them so she wouldn\u2019t roll off the bed.</p><p>\u201cY/N we need to get your uncle back from the Starks. The only way to do that is if we exchange the girls for him.\u201d</p><p>You remembered the rumors you\u2019d heard right after Ned had been killed. How Joffrey wasn\u2019t heir to the throne because he wasn\u2019t Robert\u2019s child. That Joffrey had been born out of incest. That all four of you, Joffrey, You, Myrcella, and Tommen were really the bastards of Cersei and Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI barley know uncle Jamie.

Not since you parted ways at Winterfell</p><p>&ldquo;And what a fine job you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo; He said looking to your brother than you and your sister once more.</p><p>&ldquo;You two, more beautiful than ever.&rdquo;</p><p>You watched as he then walked the short distance to your younger brother with a playful smile now on his face &ldquo;And you! You&rsquo;re going to be bigger than the hound! But much better looking!&rdquo; You smiled as Tyrion then looked up to the hound pointed and added &ldquo;This one doesn&rsquo;t like me so much&rdquo;</p><p>The man that had come out shortly after your uncle just smiled wryly before saying &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t imagine why&rdquo;</p><p>You heard Lucia then start to fuss again as her hold on your dress tightened and she let out a small cry</p><p>Looking down you saw her rattle trapped between her chest and other arm which seemed to be causing discomfort. Taking the rattle from her chest she began to calm down again.</p><p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; </p><p>Looking back up you saw your uncle come over to you and look at the dark haired little girl who&rsquo;s pale skin didn&rsquo;t really match up with your own tan skin that was used to the southern weather. </p><p>You gave Tyrion a smile before holding her more at an angle so he could see her.</p><p>&ldquo;Lucia, your grandniece.&rdquo; You introduced. You could see his facial expression change slightly as you said &lsquo;grandniece&rsquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yours?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded with a proud smile on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;We heard you were dead.&rdquo; Joffrey interrupted. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re not dead.&rdquo; Myrcella interrupted </p><p>&ldquo;Me, too, my dear. Death is so boring, especially with all this excitement going on now.&rdquo;</p><p>You saw Tyrion then look at Sansa</p><p>&ldquo;My Lady, I&rsquo;m sorry for your loss.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>Lucia had gone down for a nap. </p><p>By a nap, you mean she fell asleep on your chest while you had laid down with her. Her arms sprawled out on your chest and her feet barley reaching your belly button. And you could feel her breathing even out, so you had stayed like taking in the new baby smell that you vaguely remember Tommen having when he was born. But this was a smell you felt like you&rsquo;d always associate with Lucia wether she was a month old or 20 years old. </p><p>You heard the door open, because of those damn hinges that always squeaked more than any other door in the red keep.</p><p>Looking up you saw your mother closing it again and turning to look at you. &ldquo;We need to know where the other Stark girl is.&rdquo; </p><p>Rest your right arm firmly against Lucia&rsquo;s back and head you sat up to keep her in place on your chest. </p><p>&ldquo;I told you I don&rsquo;t know where she is, mother.&rdquo; You responded grabbing pillows and putting them side by side on the center of the bed and putting Lucia down in between them so she wouldn&rsquo;t roll off the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N we need to get your uncle back from the Starks. The only way to do that is if we exchange the girls for him.&rdquo;</p><p>You remembered the rumors you&rsquo;d heard right after Ned had been killed. How Joffrey wasn&rsquo;t heir to the throne because he wasn&rsquo;t Robert&rsquo;s child. That Joffrey had been born out of incest. That all four of you, Joffrey, You, Myrcella, and Tommen were really the bastards of Cersei and Jamie.</p><p>&ldquo;I barley know uncle Jamie. Why do you want to get him back so badly?&rdquo; You asked turning to your mother with a scowl that was so similar to her&rsquo;s. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So is uncle Tyrion. But you didn&rsquo;t try as hard to get Tyrion back like you are for Jamie!&rdquo; You snapped grabbing onto your bedpost and walking closer to her. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard rumors around the castle. About you and uncle Jamie. Disgusting rumors. Rumors I&rsquo;m starting believe.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;This is the last time i&rsquo;m going to really be able to talk to you Jon!&rdquo; You said mere inches from his face, holding his hand with &nbsp;your pendant between your hands.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much, I get that.&rdquo; You stated your free hand coming up to his face, your three last fingers going behind his ear and your index finger resting at the base of his ear and your thumb stroking his cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you, there&rsquo;s nothing that can change that. If a man with a known house to his name and with gold to accompany him came along, I&rsquo;d choose you. And I know you can&rsquo;t give me anything to remember you, but as long as I can give you something I will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d remember you without this too. I&rsquo;d remember your face and how a Baratheon woman&rsquo;s personality was better than her family&rsquo;s, and she decided to accept a bastard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re more than a bastard.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a></p></p>",

How there was once a woman locked up in a tower. How a man came to rescue her from the tower. How he\u2019d taken down an entire kingdom for her. When he didn\u2019t even know her, just stories of her beauty. </p><p>You felt like that woman, but you knew a man wouldn\u2019t come to save you. You\u2019d made up your mind about men saving the day.</p><p>It was bullshit.</p><!-- more --><p>Men wore suits of armor that slowed them down, they were reckless, and all wanted to sit on the iron throne to make their own life better. As if being a king made anything better for you or your family.</p><p>Look what it did to Aerys Targaryen and his family.</p><p>It turned him mad and every Targeryen was slaughtered except for the two youngest children of his that got away as children. Now one of them was dead, and the other was stuck across the Narrow Sea with the Dothraki. </p><p>Joffery often tried to get Arya\u2019s whereabouts out of you. You&rsquo;d only ever stayed quiet. As long as she was far away from Joffery she was safe. And you knew she would be. With Ned\u2019s blood in her she would find a way to survive this.</p><p>Everyday when you woke up, you had shooting pains in your back, ever since you got back to the castle. But this morning was different.</p><p>The sun wasn\u2019t up \u00a0yet, but the air had the smell of a fresh morning. The pain was what woke you up. Usually it was the sun coming in the window and disturbing your sleep. </p><p>You were determined to get up and change yourself without help from your handmaiden. SO you could write a letter. To your grandfather you needed to get out of King\u2019s Landing. To go to Casterly Rock if you could. </p><p>But the moment you\u2019d thrown the blankets off of your body and stood up you felt something liquid run down your legs.</p><p>You had gone stiff closed your eyes to take in a calming breath and lowered your head to see your legs and shift covered in blood. It looked as if you had been laying and trashing your legs in a bath full of blood. Turning to look at the bed you saw your sheets soaked in blood. </p><p>The pain kept shooting up your back but worse this time. You\u2019d put a firm hand on your stomach and rushed to the door trying to open it. You wanted your mother. You wanted her to tell you it was going to be okay. That you\u2019d be okay that this was normal. But the door was locked.</p><p>\u201cLet me out!\u201d The scream echoed through your room. You banged on the door with your balled up fists</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d </p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to work. You figured that out quickly when no one came to the door but you could hear people outside. Their words and voices jumbled up. Turning back around you looked at the bed. Stained and unmade. You closed your eyes in quick thought. A knife. You opened your eyes and ran over to your desk pulling a dagger out that your uncle Tyrion had given you out and threw it onto the bedside table before grabbing the blanket that rested on your bed for pure decoration before sitting back down on the bed. Feeling the blood still running down your legs as you moved around the room.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know if blood was normal. Or if this much was normal. But it didn\u2019t seem to matter as you leaned your back against the headboard taking in a deep breath before one long sharp pain shot through your lower back, forcing a scream from your throat. </p><p>An Instinct told you to push so you started to push as best as you could. A hand coming up to your face to cover your mouth. Your hands were shaking as you tried to suppress the pain.</p><p>Taking your hand away from your mouth you reached both hands between your legs, feeling something protruding from your body. It was round and you could feel what felt like wet, thin hair with your fingers. It had to be the head.</p><p>Your hands were now covered in blood, but that you could care less about as whenever you pushed you could feel your baby move inch by inch out. Your hands trying to hold whatever much of their head that you could. </p><p>The commotion behind the door wasn\u2019t what mattered anymore. What mattered was if you were going to make it to see your baby grow into a strong young man or woman. You felt weak everytime you let out a scream to accompany your pushing and the pulsing pain that seemed more constant now. </p><p>Feeling most of the head in your hand you pushed even harder than before letting a blood curdling scream out as more of the baby pushed out of your body. </p><p>The had their head in your hand and the other caught their lower back as they slid out and onto the already stained sheets.</p><p>You breathed out a sigh of relief. Taking in deep breaths as you tried to recover from the light headedness, the dizzieness, to actually look at your baby.</p><p>Finally opening your eyes you looked down between your legs to see a thick cord wrapped tightly around their neck, their face turning purple</p><p>The panic and the feeling of failure washed over you so quickly. Pulling the baby up to you you loosened the cord and unwrapped it from their neck holding them to you. Patting on the baby\u2019s back roughly to get them to start crying. You couldn\u2019t loose them. You couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, please cry. Please baby.\u201d You pleaded </p><p>Then the shrill squalling cut through the air. It sent you into tears. Finally hearing it made you feel relieved. You held them tighter to you. Rubbing the part of their back you had been patting so harshly just a moment ago. Reaching over to the side table you grabbed the dagger and set next to your leg. Pulling you baby away from you cradled them to get to the cord that had been wrapped around their neck. Grabbing the cord you lifted it up and grabbed the knife cutting through it. </p><p>Looking down you finally took a second to see what she looked like. Red faced and still crying, eyes shut so tightly it just looked like two lines where her eyes where. Her head covered in pitch black tufts of hair. And she had her tiny little hands balled up into fists and she thrashing them around, and kicking her little feet. </p><p>She looked like him.</p><hr><p>Walking out of the dinning hall you took in a deep breath. If there was one thing you hated more than an area foreign to you that you didn\u2019t know your way around, it was a crowded room. One with too much noise and the smell of wine that made it hard to smell anything else</p><p>You\u2019d walked onto the dirt ground outside and before you could even register it, you could hear the sound of a sword hitting wood. </p><p>Looking up you saw a man, not much older than yourself, hitting a sack that was wrapped around a wooden post with his sword. </p><p>\u201cCareful, pretty sure he yields.\u201d You\u2019d blurted out with a soft smile on your face </p><p>You\u2019d never seen anyone turn on their heels to look at you so quickly. He looked surprised with you. Holding his sword down to the ground he practically dropped it to bow to you.</p><p>He had coal black hair, and beautiful dark brown eyes, that in this lighting also looked black. His skin was pale, and was freshly shaven. You could tell by the little red bit of skin on his jaw and how he seemed to be wanting to scratch at it</p><p>\u201cMy Princes-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t!\u201d You insisted grabbing his upper arms and pulled him up. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d You explained. </p><p>He\u2019d only nodded slightly before standing there awkwardly. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d </p><p>He nodded and looked down at the dry dirt around his feet. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Princess. But I don\u2019t believe you should be talking to me.\u201d</p><p>That had taken you back a bit. In shock as to why he would say you shouldn\u2019t be talking to him. </p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d You asked reaching out for the sword he was holding. He\u2019d looked at you uncertain before giving it to you. You\u2019d noticed it was a paring sword and smiled slightly at the fact he was practicing with a no doubt, expensive sparing sword. </p><p>\u201cLady Catelyn thinks it\u2019s rude to have a bastard in the company of the royal family.\u201d</p><p>You looked up at him and shrugged. \u201cOkay?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re part of the royal family. And I think if she doesn\u2019t ring my neck for talking to you it\u2019ll be for letting you hold that.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged once more noticing another sparing sword and nodded to it. He\u2019d risen a brow in curiosity before grabbing it and walking back over. </p><p>You held yours up in a defensive position making him realize what you where going to do. Holding your dress up slightly in one hand you held the sword in the other.</p><p>He held his up as well ready for what you could do. Being confident that he could beat the princess of the seven kingdoms.</p><p>So he swung to try and hit gently on your shoulder but you had ducked and circled to behind him. </p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to react before the other sparing sword was brought to his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou can thank my uncle Jamie for teaching me that.\u201d</p><p>You could hear the door. The sound of the squeaking hinges and the sound of your mother running in. </p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>You looked up from your daughter\u2019s sleeping form to see your mother stopped in the middle of the floor looking at you and the small bundle in your arms who had finally calmed down after you fed her.</p><p>Her mouth was agape as she inched her way closer to you to get a better look at her grandchild. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl.\u201d You mumbled happily watching as she clenched and unclenched her fist as she slept.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her name day&hellip;Have you picked something out for her?\u201d</p><p>You nodded with a smile bring your hand to her and with your thumb and index finger holding it. </p><p>\u201cLucia, Her name is Lucia.\u201d</p><hr><p style=\"\"><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a></p><p>Let me know if you want to be tagged!</p>",

Reaching over to the side table you grabbed the dagger and set next to your leg. Pulling you baby away from you cradled them to get to the cord that had been wrapped around their neck. Grabbing the cord you lifted it up and grabbed the knife cutting through it. </p><p>Looking down you finally took a second to see what she looked like. Red faced and still crying, eyes shut so tightly it just looked like two lines where her eyes where. Her head covered in pitch black tufts of hair. And she had her tiny little hands balled up into fists and she thrashing them around, and kicking her little feet. </p><p>She looked like him.</p><hr><p>Walking out of the dinning hall you took in a deep breath. If there was one thing you hated more than an area foreign to you that you didn\u2019t know your way around, it was a crowded room. One with too much noise and the smell of wine that made it hard to smell anything else</p><p>You\u2019d walked onto the dirt ground outside and before you could even register it, you could hear the sound of a sword hitting wood. </p><p>Looking up you saw a man, not much older than yourself, hitting a sack that was wrapped around a wooden post with his sword. </p><p>\u201cCareful, pretty sure he yields.\u201d You\u2019d blurted out with a soft smile on your face </p><p>You\u2019d never seen anyone turn on their heels to look at you so quickly. He looked surprised with you. Holding his sword down to the ground he practically dropped it to bow to you.</p><p>He had coal black hair, and beautiful dark brown eyes, that in this lighting also looked black. His skin was pale, and was freshly shaven. You could tell by the little red bit of skin on his jaw and how he seemed to be wanting to scratch at it</p><p>\u201cMy Princes-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t!\u201d You insisted grabbing his upper arms and pulled him up. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d You explained. </p><p>He\u2019d only nodded slightly before standing there awkwardly. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d </p><p>He nodded and looked down at the dry dirt around his feet. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Princess. But I don\u2019t believe you should be talking to me.\u201d</p><p>That had taken you back a bit. In shock as to why he would say you shouldn\u2019t be talking to him. </p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d You asked reaching out for the sword he was holding. He\u2019d looked at you uncertain before giving it to you. You\u2019d noticed it was a paring sword and smiled slightly at the fact he was practicing with a no doubt, expensive sparing sword. </p><p>\u201cLady Catelyn thinks it\u2019s rude to have a bastard in the company of the royal family.\u201d</p><p>You looked up at him and shrugged. \u201cOkay?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re part of the royal family. And I think if she doesn\u2019t ring my neck for talking to you it\u2019ll be for letting you hold that.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged once more noticing another sparing sword and nodded to it. He\u2019d risen a brow in curiosity before grabbing it and walking back over. </p><p>You held yours up in a defensive position making him realize what you where going to do. Holding your dress up slightly in one hand you held the sword in the other.</p><p>He held his up as well ready for what you could do. Being confident that he could beat the princess of the seven kingdoms.</p><p>So he swung to try and hit gently on your shoulder but you had ducked and circled to behind him. </p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to react before the other sparing sword was brought to his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou can thank my uncle Jamie for teaching me that.\u201d</p><p>You could hear the door. The sound of the squeaking hinges and the sound of your mother running in. </p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>You looked up from your daughter\u2019s sleeping form to see your mother stopped in the middle of the floor looking at you and the small bundle in your arms who had finally calmed down after you fed her.</p><p>Her mouth was agape as she inched her way closer to you to get a better look at her grandchild. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl.\u201d You mumbled happily watching as she clenched and unclenched her fist as she slept.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her name day\u2026Have you picked something out for her?\u201d</p><p>You nodded with a smile bring your hand to her and with your thumb and index finger holding it. </p><p>\u201cLucia, Her name is Lucia.\u201d</p><hr><p style=\"\"><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a></p><p>Let me know if you want to be tagged!</p></p>",

How there was once a woman locked up in a tower. How a man came to rescue her from the tower. How he\u2019d taken down an entire kingdom for her. When he didn\u2019t even know her, just stories of her beauty. </p><p>You felt like that woman, but you knew a man wouldn\u2019t come to save you. You\u2019d made up your mind about men saving the day.</p><p>It was bullshit.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Men wore suits of armor that slowed them down, they were reckless, and all wanted to sit on the iron throne to make their own life better. As if being a king made anything better for you or your family.</p><p>Look what it did to Aerys Targaryen and his family.</p><p>It turned him mad and every Targeryen was slaughtered except for the two youngest children of his that got away as children. Now one of them was dead, and the other was stuck across the Narrow Sea with the Dothraki. </p><p>Joffery often tried to get Arya\u2019s whereabouts out of you. You\u2019d only ever stayed quiet. As long as she was far away from Joffery she was safe. And you knew she would be. With Ned\u2019s blood in her she would find a way to survive this.</p><p>Everyday when you woke up, you had shooting pains in your back, ever since you got back to the castle. But this morning was different.</p><p>The sun wasn\u2019t up \u00a0yet, but the air had the smell of a fresh morning. The pain was what woke you up. Usually it was the sun coming in the window and disturbing your sleep. </p><p>You were determined to get up and change yourself without help from your handmaiden. SO you could write a letter. To your grandfather you needed to get out of King\u2019s Landing. To go to Casterly Rock if you could. </p><p>But the moment you\u2019d thrown the blankets off of your body and stood up you felt something liquid run down your legs.</p><p>You had gone stiff closed your eyes to take in a calming breath and lowered your head to see your legs and shift covered in blood. It looked as if you had been laying and trashing your legs in a bath full of blood. Turning to look at the bed you saw your sheets soaked in blood. </p><p>The pain kept shooting up your back but worse this time. You\u2019d put a firm hand on your stomach and rushed to the door trying to open it. You wanted your mother. You wanted her to tell you it was going to be okay. That you\u2019d be okay that this was normal. But the door was locked.</p><p>\u201cLet me out!\u201d The scream echoed through your room. You banged on the door with your balled up fists</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d </p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to work. You figured that out quickly when no one came to the door but you could hear people outside. Their words and voices jumbled up. Turning back around you looked at the bed. Stained and unmade. You closed your eyes in quick thought. A knife. You opened your eyes and ran over to your desk pulling a dagger out that your uncle Tyrion had given you out and threw it onto the bedside table before grabbing the blanket that rested on your bed for pure decoration before sitting back down on the bed. Feeling the blood still running down your legs as you moved around the room.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know if blood was normal. Or if this much was normal. But it didn\u2019t seem to matter as you leaned your back against the headboard taking in a deep breath before one long sharp pain shot through your lower back, forcing a scream from your throat. </p><p>An Instinct told you to push so you started to push as best as you could. A hand coming up to your face to cover your mouth. Your hands were shaking as you tried to suppress the pain.</p><p>Taking your hand away from your mouth you reached both hands between your legs, feeling something protruding from your body. It was round and you could feel what felt like wet, thin hair with your fingers. It had to be the head.</p><p>Your hands were now covered in blood, but that you could care less about as whenever you pushed you could feel your baby move inch by inch out. Your hands trying to hold whatever much of their head that you could. </p><p>The commotion behind the door wasn\u2019t what mattered anymore. What mattered was if you were going to make it to see your baby grow into a strong young man or woman. You felt weak everytime you let out a scream to accompany your pushing and the pulsing pain that seemed more constant now. </p><p>Feeling most of the head in your hand you pushed even harder than before letting a blood curdling scream out as more of the baby pushed out of your body. </p><p>The had their head in your hand and the other caught their lower back as they slid out and onto the already stained sheets.</p><p>You breathed out a sigh of relief. Taking in deep breaths as you tried to recover from the light headedness, the dizzieness, to actually look at your baby.</p><p>Finally opening your eyes you looked down between your legs to see a thick cord wrapped tightly around their neck, their face turning purple</p><p>The panic and the feeling of failure washed over you so quickly. Pulling the baby up to you you loosened the cord and unwrapped it from their neck holding them to you. Patting on the baby\u2019s back roughly to get them to start crying.

You&rsquo;d noticed it was a paring sword and smiled slightly at the fact he was practicing with a no doubt, expensive sparing sword. </p><p>&ldquo;Lady Catelyn thinks it&rsquo;s rude to have a bastard in the company of the royal family.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked up at him and shrugged. &ldquo;Okay?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re part of the royal family. And I think if she doesn&rsquo;t ring my neck for talking to you it&rsquo;ll be for letting you hold that.&rdquo;</p><p>You shrugged once more noticing another sparing sword and nodded to it. He&rsquo;d risen a brow in curiosity before grabbing it and walking back over. </p><p>You held yours up in a defensive position making him realize what you where going to do. Holding your dress up slightly in one hand you held the sword in the other.</p><p>He held his up as well ready for what you could do. Being confident that he could beat the princess of the seven kingdoms.</p><p>So he swung to try and hit gently on your shoulder but you had ducked and circled to behind him. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t have time to react before the other sparing sword was brought to his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;You can thank my uncle Jamie for teaching me that.&rdquo;</p><p>You could hear the door. The sound of the squeaking hinges and the sound of your mother running in. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>You looked up from your daughter&rsquo;s sleeping form to see your mother stopped in the middle of the floor looking at you and the small bundle in your arms who had finally calmed down after you fed her.</p><p>Her mouth was agape as she inched her way closer to you to get a better look at her grandchild. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a girl.&rdquo; You mumbled happily watching as she clenched and unclenched her fist as she slept.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her name day&hellip;Have you picked something out for her?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded with a smile bring your hand to her and with your thumb and index finger holding it. </p><p>&ldquo;Lucia, Her name is Lucia.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a></p><p>Let me know if you want to be tagged!</p></p>",
