        "body": "<p><b>Summary</b>: Phil Lester was a worker for the BBC in London. Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br/></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 3.5k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and mentions of sex\u00a0</p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit\u00a0</p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday at 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/42789464\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a>**</b></p><p><b>A/N:\u00a0</b>Surprise! i had this chapter done so I decided to post it anyway :) don&rsquo;t get used to having the same upload schedule though if I do in fact have chapters done. This is just because this chapter is 3.4k and i think it&rsquo;s the best I&rsquo;ve written so far so I&rsquo;m eager to see you guys read it!</p><!-- more --><p>\tDan\u2019s name popped up on Phil\u2019s phone under a feeling of vibrations. Phil found himself holding his breath, willing his stomach to unknot and the feeling of guilt to leave. He shut his eyes briefly and attempted to run his hands through his slightly sweaty hair to hide what just happened. Unfortunately, the blush in his cheeks was going to last a while.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe unlocked his phone and answered Dan\u2019s Facetime request. On the screen, Dan\u2019s face popped up and he was in a dimly lit room with a rack of clothing behind where he was sat. Phil assumed he was still on set.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt was so awful, Phil!\u201d Dan whined, his voice childlike. \u201cThe director wanted us to do all this crazy shit and God, it\u2019s going to look so fake. I can tell already. And I wasn\u2019t into. Mimei wasn\u2019t into it. It was just awkward.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Phil says, biting his lip. He genuinely was sorry. He still couldn\u2019t imagine how it must feel to be forced into a scene like that. He assumed that Dan still had a bit of say in the matter but at the same time, he doubted that.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a sigh. \u201cI have to go back on set for another scene in fifteen minutes but I really needed to\u2015why are your cheeks flushed? Did you just go for a run or something?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his cheeks flush even redder as blood rushed to his face. \u201cOh\u2026uh\u2026No. Just kind of warm in my flat tonight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan cocked his eyebrow and gave a smirk before he let out a breath along with a chuckle. \u201cOkay mate.\u201d Dan says, dragging out the words, laughing a little himself.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was thoroughly embarrassed now.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYa know,\u201d Dan continues. \u201cIf you were in the middle of a wank, I could have called tonight after I got home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh no!\u201d Phil says, quickly trying to divert the topic. \u201cNo! It wasn\u2019t that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan smirked at him again. \u201cSure, mate.\u201d He lets out a sigh. \u201cI have such a busy week ahead of me. I\u2019m not looking forward to it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell,\u201d Dan says, looking down at his lap before bringing his attention back up to the screen. \u201cTomorrow, I have a cover shoot for People magazine followed by an interview for an article that they\u2019re writing on me to do with my movie. And then the rest of this week, I have a mix of public appearances I have to make. One of them is actually that I\u2019m cutting the ribbon at this new theater in downtown LA near WEHO. And then Friday, I have to attend a premiere for another movie that I was invited to and my manager booked me for. All the rest of the time, I\u2019m filming the rest of the movie.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil listens with intent to everything Dan says and he finds it all a bit overwhelming. Especially considering that Phil is just going to be going to work, eating, playing with Spike, and repeating the process for the foreseeable future. He never had anything as exciting as Dan always had going on.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut in a way, he didn\u2019t envy Dan for that. In fact, he felt bad.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh!\u201d Dan says with a sudden thought. \u201cAnd then this weekend, I\u2019m attending a party that is being held by Kylie Jenner.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his body stiffen. \u201cKylie Jenner?!\u201d He finds himself exclaiming.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods. \u201cYep! She\u2019s hosting a party for her new collection of make up that has to do with \u2018saving world hunger\u2019 or some ploy like that and I was invited by her PR team because apparently I would be good PR to have at the party? I don\u2019t fucking know. So I\u2019m attending. Maybe I\u2019ll get a Kanye autograph while I\u2019m there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhere is it going to be?\u201d Phil asks. \u201cSurely, it\u2019s not at her home, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shrugs. \u201cNo idea actually. I\u2019ll probably just walk in, sip some champagne and have a few cocktails, take a couple of photos, and then peace out for the evening. Those events aren\u2019t really my thing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat sounds exhausting.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine having to be around that many people and having to talk with them and take a bunch of photographs.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot your type of thing either?\u201d Dan asks, relaxing back in his chair. It creaks and Phil watches Dan\u2019s eyes widen as he quickly looks down at the sides of the chair. Phil chuckled to himself because it sounded like the chair was in pretty bad quality. Probably some cheap plastic seat with a vinyl or canvas fabric to sit on.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not the most social person.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe either.\u201d Dan says. \u201cWhich I know is ironic but\u2026\u201d He shrugs.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you an introvert?\u201d Phil asks. He actually does want to know.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYep.\u201d Dan says with a smile. \u201cAre you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh totally.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh good.\u201d Dan says with a knowing glance. \u201cI was ready to say we can\u2019t be friends if you were an extrovert.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lets out a laugh and Dan follows suit.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut then a loud voice cuts through the laughing to Dan, saying \u201cfive minutes before you\u2019re needed on set.\u201d Dan gives him an apologetic glance and tells Phil that he\u2019ll talk to him later.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t promise that he\u2019ll be awake to answer but he does hope he will be. He wishes Dan better luck on his shoot and then they hang up and Phil is left alone again in his bedroom.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe throws his phone to the side and then stands up from his bed. He walks over to the door and opens it, letting in Spike who was sitting on the other side waiting, his stubby tail wagging back in forth. With the allowance back into the room, Spike runs to the bed and hops on and burrows onto Phil\u2019s pillow, resting his head.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil leaves the room and goes to the bathroom and shuts the door behind him. He walks in and slips his pants off into a pile on the floor. He grabs the bottom of his shirt and takes the off as well, throwing that along with his pants onto the floor. He bends down and turns the water of his shower on and lets the droplets from the faucet run over his fingers. When it\u2019s a suitable temperature, turns on his shower and steps inside, pulling the curtain back.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe stands under the warm mist and washes all of the sweat and dirt from his skin. There are also some particularly stickier areas as well but he takes his time washing all of those away.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe quickly washes his body and then grabs for his shampoo and wets his hair under the water. He pushes it back before the water can drip down his face and he squirts the shampoo into his palm before running it through his hair and lathering it.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s rinsing his hair out, his eyes still closed to avoid getting the shampoo into them. When he knows it\u2019s rinsed out, he steps out of the mist and shakes his head a little, wiping his face off with a damp washcloth that was hanging from the side bar of his tub.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe opens his eyes slowly and realizes that there is a shampoo in his shower that he\u2019s never seen before. He bends over and picks up the bright orange bottle and reads it over. \u201cCurl protectant shampoo for men.\u201d He laughs to himself. For men. How absurd is that? He uses whatever shampoo has the most pleasing scent.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s half used and he opens it, gagging a little at the strong scent that comes out it. But he leans back down and takes another sniff. It\u2019s Dan. That scent is Dan. It\u2019s so familiar.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe feels a bit sad now, a pit forming in his stomach. He shouldn\u2019t feel this way about a half used shampoo bottle that Dan must have left behind. He\u2019s never noticed it before in the shower, but most of the time, when he showers, he doesn\u2019t have his contacts in so he blindly grabs for his shampoo and body wash, recognizing the different sized bottles.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sets it back down on the edge of the tub and then turns around, turning off the shower as the water begins to run cool against his skin. He pulls back the curtain and steps out, grabbing a towel from the rack and pushing it up to his face to wipe of the water on his skin.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe grabs the rest of his towels and finishes drying himself off before wrapping them around his body like he always does. He makes a pit stop at the sink and removes his contacts, putting them in the pot before setting them back on the sink. He stumbles blindly from his bathroom, grabbing his dirty clothes on the way, and makes it to his bedroom where he grabs for his glasses on the night stand and puts them on.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike is still sitting on his bed, watching him as he moves around the room and slowly dresses into a new set of pajamas and pants. Once he\u2019s settled into his emoji pajamas and a black shirt, he flops onto his bed and picks up his phone. He has a couple missed messages.\u00a0</p><p>\tOne from PJ and two from his mum.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe looks at the one from PJ first which is just saying \u201cdrinks tonight? My treat.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe looks at the time. It\u2019s a little after 6pm. He could probably do for a drink or two. Not even to get drunk but a couple to ease his mind. He texts back PJ asking for when and where and then opens the texts from his mum.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Mum: </b>are you doing anything this weekend, hun?\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Mum: </b>your father and I would like to see you.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe lets out a sigh and then opens his calendar. He doesn\u2019t have to work this weekend\u2015thank god, but he\u2019s not sure if he can find a way to get to the Isle of Man on such short notice. He\u2019d love to see his parents but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll be plausible.\u00a0</p><p>\tIn the time of him going online and looking up flights, he gets a message from PJ telling him to meet him at this pub near his flat at 7:30. He has time so he goes back on Safari and ends up finding a flight that leaves near 6am this Saturday and then he found a return flight for 8pm on Sunday back to London. He could do that.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe books the flights and then takes a screenshot of the confirmations and sends them to his mum. As soon as the messages are sent, his mum calls him and he answers.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cChild!\u201d She chimes through the speaker.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMum!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou found flights alright?\u201d She asked. \u201cYour father and I weren\u2019t sure if you were going to find any on such short notice.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIsle of Man isn\u2019t exactly a hot spot.\u201d Phil says with a chuckle. \u201cI normally can find flights pretty quickly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell us about Dan when you get here!\u201d She says, wasting no time in bringing him up. \u201cYour father and I have a lot of questions.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let\u2019s out a sigh. \u2018There isn\u2019t much to say, mum.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDear, your father and I have watched Dan in movies before. We have a lot of questions about how you two even met.\u201d She says, her voice soft. \u201cPlus, he\u2019s a nice-looking boy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMum\u2026\u201d He groans, feeling his body cave inward from the secondhand embarrassment.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh hun, you know it\u2019s true.\u201d She says with a laugh. \u201cAnd I also happen to know that he\u2019s your type.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t have a type.\u201d Phil corrects.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d His mum continues. \u201cYour last boyfriend\u2015Jonah? Was it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJoshua.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJoshua! Yes, him! He was tall with curly brown hair and he had brown eyes too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u2018That doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, Phil.\u201d She says and Phil rolls his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick you up from the airport as usual on Saturday. You should visit more often!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of time anymore.\u201d Phil says because it\u2019s true. He really doesn\u2019t have a lot of time anymore between going to work and being busy with work. And he also does have a social life sometimes. Not often, but he does when he goes out with PJ. Like he\u2019s going to tonight.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell make time, child!\u201d She pips up. \u201cWe miss you!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI miss you too, mum.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe can tell she\u2019s smiling on the other side. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you go. But do call a bit more. I\u2019ll see you on Saturday.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe says a quick goodbye to her and then they hang up.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe gets up from bed and begins to get ready for the pub when his phone vibrates against the bed. He\u2019s ready to roll his eyes again, sure that it\u2019s his mum texting him goodnight or something. But instead, it\u2019s from Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe quickly grabs his phone and opens the message. A photo pops up and it\u2019s one from Dan, a selfie in a mirror. He\u2019s dressed in a suit and his hair is perfectly groomed. His eyes are slightly squinted but his body language is poised and just\u2026well, Phil can\u2019t help but feel butterflies when he looks at the photo.\u00a0</p><p>\tYeah, he\u2019s fucked.\u00a0</p><p>\t***</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s one raspberry beer down at the pub and PJ and him are laughing over some dumb thing that they remembered from work that happened nearly two years before. Phil\u2019s not even sure how they got on the subject of this, but he finds himself laughing so hard his sides hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd then Gemma\u2019s face was priceless!\u201d PJ continues, his laugh carrying through the loud atmosphere and Phil is following suit. He picks up his bottle and finishes the rest of the beer before he stands up.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWant another one?\u201d Phil asks, pointing to PJ\u2019s empty pint on the table.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ shakes his head. \u201cI said the drinks were on me tonight!\u201d He stands up and grabs the pint and the bottle. \u201cI\u2019ll go grab us a few drinks. What would you like?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSurprise me.\u201d Phil says, climbing back onto the stool and sitting down.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan hadn\u2019t been able to text him much but Phil did find himself replying back to Dan\u2019s photo with a smiley face. He doesn\u2019t know why that is what he sent but he did and he can\u2019t take it back. And he also doesn\u2019t want to take it back because Dan sent back a blushing emoji.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe still hasn\u2019t been on Twitter or Instagram or YouTube and that\u2019s okay because he doesn\u2019t want to read everything that he knows is going to be on there. He wants to remain a happy medium in this entire situation.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhich reminds him, he\u2019s going to need to go on his YouTube eventually because he\u2019ll need to make another video soon. What should he even do for this new video? Maybe a Q+A? That might be fun? But then that is going to require him to go on Twitter.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI got you another beer.\u201d PJ says, setting a pint down on the table of some pale drink. \u201cIt sounded like one you might like.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lifts up and eyebrow and picks it up, taking a quick sip. He doesn\u2019t particularly like beer but he\u2019ll drink this since PJ bought it and he\u2019ll feel bad not finishing it.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo, what\u2019s the gossip about Dan?\u201d PJ asks, taking a long sip of\u2026that looks like Guinness but \tPhil\u2019s not sure.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat gossip?\u201d Phil asks, genuinely confused.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat\u2019s he like!\u201d PJ asks. \u201cI want to know what the famous guy is like to be around.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s like a normal guy?\u201d Phil says. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s fun and he\u2019s loud. But he also is super understanding and he always is really easy to talk to which you know how awkward I am. But it\u2019s not hard to build a friendship with him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen are you going to ask him out?\u201d PJ asks, taking a long swig of his drink.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil follows and takes a sip, wincing a bit at the bitterness. Yeah, this beer is definitely not his thing. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I will.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou two seem right fond of each other.\u201d PJ says. \u201cThat video was the definition of sexual tension.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil scoffs. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ shook his head. \u201cNo mate. That video\u2026if no one knew who you were, they would have sworn that you were Dan\u2019s boyfriend. I mean, he was looking at you up and down every second.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his face flush. \u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t find me attractive.\u201d He says. \u201cAnd besides, we\u2019re just friends.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ frowns. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cUndermine yourself like that.\u201d PJ says.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks down at his drink. \u201cIt\u2019s true though.\u201d He says. \u201cThere is a reason why guys don\u2019t want to date me after a year.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou just haven\u2019t found the good guys.\u201d PJ presses.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs. \u201cNo one wants to date me, PJ.\u201d He says. \u201cThey just want me to put out for them so they can get off and then they want to leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOnce again,\u201d PJ continues. \u201cYou\u2019re not finding the right guys.\u201d PJ pauses. \u201cI think Dan looks at you differently than I\u2019ve ever seen a guy look at you.\u201d</p><p>\tPhil shakes his head.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo!\u201d PJ adds. \u201cDan is into you, Phil.\u201d He reaches out and lays a hand on Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cDrop some hints at him. I guarantee that he\u2019s into you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow would I even do that?\u201d Phil asks, giving in a little bit. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to flirt. I\u2019m not even sure where to begin. My last boyfriend messaged me over Twitter in my Dm\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJust say things to him that might come off as flirty. Tell him you like his shirt or maybe you\u2019d like to see it off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPeej!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m being serious, Phil! Maybe send him more photos. Send him a selfie and see if he\u2019ll send one back. Hell, send him a picture of your dick and see if he\u2019ll one back.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not doing that, PJ!\u201d Phil exclaimed, his voice drowned out, thankfully, by the loud murmurs. \u201cFor one, I think that counts as sexual harassment on paper.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ rolls his eyes. \u201cWell, then just talk with him and get a little bit flirtier. Tell him he has great eyes and that you want to get lost in them. Tell him he has a great body and you want to get lost in it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil scoffs and feels his face flush\u2015and it\u2019s not from the alcohol or the warm room. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJust try it!\u201d PJ presses. \u201cGet out your phone and send him a text.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cRight now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYes, right now!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis is ridiculous and stupid.\u201d Phil says as he reaches into his pocket and pulls out his phone. He sets it on the table and PJ gestures to it.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSend Dan a text. Just send him something short. Maybe like a \u201cI miss you\u201d or \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you again\u201d. Just start simple.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil bites his lip and opens up his phone, clicking on the messages app and opening up Dan\u2019s messages. \u201cWhat was the last thing he sent you?\u201d PJ asks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cA selfie.\u201d Phil says, looking down at the photo.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, what did you say to him about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis feels like an interrogation.\u201d Phil counters.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, do you want to get laid or not?\u201d Pj asks and Phil lets out a breath. He picks up his beer and takes a long sip. He\u2019s going to need it.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI just sent him an emoji.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOH PHIL!\u201d PJ cried. \u201cWhat emoji did you send? Please tell me it was the eggplant.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil coughed and blushed. \u201cIt was just a smiley emoji.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ cried out again and reached for Phil\u2019s phone, snatching it from his hands. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Phil protested, reaching for it. But PJ\u2019s fingers were too fast and he was typing and all Phil could do was wait.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ handed his phone back to him and Phil takes another swig of his beer before grabbing it. He reads it over and feels the color drain from his face.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>I forgot to tell you this earlier but I think you look amazing.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPJ he\u2019s going to think I\u2019m weird!\u201d Phil whines. \u201cThis is too much!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo, it won\u2019t be.\u201d PJ said. \u201cJust wait and see.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tNo messages come as Phil finishes his beer and PJ finishes his. Neither one of them want another drink so they both leave, completely sober still and head back to their flats.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gets into his flat at a little after 10 and greets Spike with a little rub down and then a chance to go to the courtyard for the bathroom. When he lets Spike back in, he goes to the bathroom himself and gets ready for bed.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe goes to his bedroom and climbs into bed, knowing he has to be up early to go to work tomorrow. He grabs his phone and goes to plug it in when he sees a message from Dan that stops his heart.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>thank you &lt;3 but I think its you that looks amazing not me\u00a0</p>",

Phil found himself holding his breath, willing his stomach to unknot and the feeling of guilt to leave. He shut his eyes briefly and attempted to run his hands through his slightly sweaty hair to hide what just happened. Unfortunately, the blush in his cheeks was going to last a while.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe unlocked his phone and answered Dan\u2019s Facetime request. On the screen, Dan\u2019s face popped up and he was in a dimly lit room with a rack of clothing behind where he was sat. Phil assumed he was still on set.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt was so awful, Phil!\u201d Dan whined, his voice childlike. \u201cThe director wanted us to do all this crazy shit and God, it\u2019s going to look so fake. I can tell already. And I wasn\u2019t into. Mimei wasn\u2019t into it. It was just awkward.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Phil says, biting his lip. He genuinely was sorry. He still couldn\u2019t imagine how it must feel to be forced into a scene like that. He assumed that Dan still had a bit of say in the matter but at the same time, he doubted that.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a sigh. \u201cI have to go back on set for another scene in fifteen minutes but I really needed to\u2015why are your cheeks flushed? Did you just go for a run or something?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his cheeks flush even redder as blood rushed to his face. \u201cOh\u2026uh\u2026No. Just kind of warm in my flat tonight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan cocked his eyebrow and gave a smirk before he let out a breath along with a chuckle. \u201cOkay mate.\u201d Dan says, dragging out the words, laughing a little himself.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was thoroughly embarrassed now.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYa know,\u201d Dan continues. \u201cIf you were in the middle of a wank, I could have called tonight after I got home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh no!\u201d Phil says, quickly trying to divert the topic. \u201cNo! It wasn\u2019t that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan smirked at him again. \u201cSure, mate.\u201d He lets out a sigh. \u201cI have such a busy week ahead of me. I\u2019m not looking forward to it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell,\u201d Dan says, looking down at his lap before bringing his attention back up to the screen. \u201cTomorrow, I have a cover shoot for People magazine followed by an interview for an article that they\u2019re writing on me to do with my movie. And then the rest of this week, I have a mix of public appearances I have to make. One of them is actually that I\u2019m cutting the ribbon at this new theater in downtown LA near WEHO. And then Friday, I have to attend a premiere for another movie that I was invited to and my manager booked me for. All the rest of the time, I\u2019m filming the rest of the movie.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil listens with intent to everything Dan says and he finds it all a bit overwhelming. Especially considering that Phil is just going to be going to work, eating, playing with Spike, and repeating the process for the foreseeable future. He never had anything as exciting as Dan always had going on.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut in a way, he didn\u2019t envy Dan for that. In fact, he felt bad.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh!\u201d Dan says with a sudden thought. \u201cAnd then this weekend, I\u2019m attending a party that is being held by Kylie Jenner.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his body stiffen. \u201cKylie Jenner?!\u201d He finds himself exclaiming.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods. \u201cYep! She\u2019s hosting a party for her new collection of make up that has to do with \u2018saving world hunger\u2019 or some ploy like that and I was invited by her PR team because apparently I would be good PR to have at the party? I don\u2019t fucking know. So I\u2019m attending. Maybe I\u2019ll get a Kanye autograph while I\u2019m there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhere is it going to be?\u201d Phil asks. \u201cSurely, it\u2019s not at her home, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shrugs. \u201cNo idea actually. I\u2019ll probably just walk in, sip some champagne and have a few cocktails, take a couple of photos, and then peace out for the evening. Those events aren\u2019t really my thing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat sounds exhausting.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine having to be around that many people and having to talk with them and take a bunch of photographs.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot your type of thing either?\u201d Dan asks, relaxing back in his chair. It creaks and Phil watches Dan\u2019s eyes widen as he quickly looks down at the sides of the chair. Phil chuckled to himself because it sounded like the chair was in pretty bad quality. Probably some cheap plastic seat with a vinyl or canvas fabric to sit on.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not the most social person.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe either.\u201d Dan says. \u201cWhich I know is ironic but\u2026\u201d He shrugs.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you an introvert?\u201d Phil asks. He actually does want to know.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYep.\u201d Dan says with a smile. \u201cAre you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh totally.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh good.\u201d Dan says with a knowing glance. \u201cI was ready to say we can\u2019t be friends if you were an extrovert.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lets out a laugh and Dan follows suit.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut then a loud voice cuts through the laughing to Dan, saying \u201cfive minutes before you\u2019re needed on set.\u201d Dan gives him an apologetic glance and tells Phil that he\u2019ll talk to him later.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t promise that he\u2019ll be awake to answer but he does hope he will be. He wishes Dan better luck on his shoot and then they hang up and Phil is left alone again in his bedroom.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe throws his phone to the side and then stands up from his bed. He walks over to the door and opens it, letting in Spike who was sitting on the other side waiting, his stubby tail wagging back in forth. With the allowance back into the room, Spike runs to the bed and hops on and burrows onto Phil\u2019s pillow, resting his head.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil leaves the room and goes to the bathroom and shuts the door behind him. He walks in and slips his pants off into a pile on the floor. He grabs the bottom of his shirt and takes the off as well, throwing that along with his pants onto the floor. He bends down and turns the water of his shower on and lets the droplets from the faucet run over his fingers. When it\u2019s a suitable temperature, turns on his shower and steps inside, pulling the curtain back.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe stands under the warm mist and washes all of the sweat and dirt from his skin. There are also some particularly stickier areas as well but he takes his time washing all of those away.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe quickly washes his body and then grabs for his shampoo and wets his hair under the water. He pushes it back before the water can drip down his face and he squirts the shampoo into his palm before running it through his hair and lathering it.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s rinsing his hair out, his eyes still closed to avoid getting the shampoo into them. When he knows it\u2019s rinsed out, he steps out of the mist and shakes his head a little, wiping his face off with a damp washcloth that was hanging from the side bar of his tub.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe opens his eyes slowly and realizes that there is a shampoo in his shower that he\u2019s never seen before. He bends over and picks up the bright orange bottle and reads it over. \u201cCurl protectant shampoo for men.\u201d He laughs to himself. For men. How absurd is that? He uses whatever shampoo has the most pleasing scent.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s half used and he opens it, gagging a little at the strong scent that comes out it. But he leans back down and takes another sniff. It\u2019s Dan. That scent is Dan. It\u2019s so familiar.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe feels a bit sad now, a pit forming in his stomach. He shouldn\u2019t feel this way about a half used shampoo bottle that Dan must have left behind. He\u2019s never noticed it before in the shower, but most of the time, when he showers, he doesn\u2019t have his contacts in so he blindly grabs for his shampoo and body wash, recognizing the different sized bottles.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sets it back down on the edge of the tub and then turns around, turning off the shower as the water begins to run cool against his skin. He pulls back the curtain and steps out, grabbing a towel from the rack and pushing it up to his face to wipe of the water on his skin.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe grabs the rest of his towels and finishes drying himself off before wrapping them around his body like he always does. He makes a pit stop at the sink and removes his contacts, putting them in the pot before setting them back on the sink. He stumbles blindly from his bathroom, grabbing his dirty clothes on the way, and makes it to his bedroom where he grabs for his glasses on the night stand and puts them on.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike is still sitting on his bed, watching him as he moves around the room and slowly dresses into a new set of pajamas and pants. Once he\u2019s settled into his emoji pajamas and a black shirt, he flops onto his bed and picks up his phone. He has a couple missed messages.\u00a0</p><p>\tOne from PJ and two from his mum.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe looks at the one from PJ first which is just saying \u201cdrinks tonight? My treat.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe looks at the time. It\u2019s a little after 6pm. He could probably do for a drink or two. Not even to get drunk but a couple to ease his mind. He texts back PJ asking for when and where and then opens the texts from his mum.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Mum: </b>are you doing anything this weekend, hun?\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Mum: </b>your father and I would like to see you.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe lets out a sigh and then opens his calendar. He doesn\u2019t have to work this weekend\u2015thank god, but he\u2019s not sure if he can find a way to get to the Isle of Man on such short notice. He\u2019d love to see his parents but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll be plausible.\u00a0</p><p>\tIn the time of him going online and looking up flights, he gets a message from PJ telling him to meet him at this pub near his flat at 7:30. He has time so he goes back on Safari and ends up finding a flight that leaves near 6am this Saturday and then he found a return flight for 8pm on Sunday back to London. He could do that.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe books the flights and then takes a screenshot of the confirmations and sends them to his mum. As soon as the messages are sent, his mum calls him and he answers.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cChild!\u201d She chimes through the speaker.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMum!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou found flights alright?\u201d She asked. \u201cYour father and I weren\u2019t sure if you were going to find any on such short notice.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIsle of Man isn\u2019t exactly a hot spot.\u201d Phil says with a chuckle. \u201cI normally can find flights pretty quickly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell us about Dan when you get here!\u201d She says, wasting no time in bringing him up. \u201cYour father and I have a lot of questions.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let\u2019s out a sigh. \u2018There isn\u2019t much to say, mum.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDear, your father and I have watched Dan in movies before. We have a lot of questions about how you two even met.\u201d She says, her voice soft. \u201cPlus, he\u2019s a nice-looking boy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMum\u2026\u201d He groans, feeling his body cave inward from the secondhand embarrassment.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh hun, you know it\u2019s true.\u201d She says with a laugh. \u201cAnd I also happen to know that he\u2019s your type.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t have a type.\u201d Phil corrects.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d His mum continues. \u201cYour last boyfriend\u2015Jonah? Was it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJoshua.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJoshua! Yes, him! He was tall with curly brown hair and he had brown eyes too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u2018That doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, Phil.\u201d She says and Phil rolls his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick you up from the airport as usual on Saturday. You should visit more often!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of time anymore.\u201d Phil says because it\u2019s true. He really doesn\u2019t have a lot of time anymore between going to work and being busy with work. And he also does have a social life sometimes. Not often, but he does when he goes out with PJ. Like he\u2019s going to tonight.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell make time, child!\u201d She pips up. \u201cWe miss you!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI miss you too, mum.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe can tell she\u2019s smiling on the other side. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you go. But do call a bit more. I\u2019ll see you on Saturday.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe says a quick goodbye to her and then they hang up.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe gets up from bed and begins to get ready for the pub when his phone vibrates against the bed. He\u2019s ready to roll his eyes again, sure that it\u2019s his mum texting him goodnight or something. But instead, it\u2019s from Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe quickly grabs his phone and opens the message. A photo pops up and it\u2019s one from Dan, a selfie in a mirror. He\u2019s dressed in a suit and his hair is perfectly groomed. His eyes are slightly squinted but his body language is poised and just\u2026well, Phil can\u2019t help but feel butterflies when he looks at the photo.\u00a0</p><p>\tYeah, he\u2019s fucked.\u00a0</p><p>\t***</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s one raspberry beer down at the pub and PJ and him are laughing over some dumb thing that they remembered from work that happened nearly two years before. Phil\u2019s not even sure how they got on the subject of this, but he finds himself laughing so hard his sides hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd then Gemma\u2019s face was priceless!\u201d PJ continues, his laugh carrying through the loud atmosphere and Phil is following suit. He picks up his bottle and finishes the rest of the beer before he stands up.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWant another one?\u201d Phil asks, pointing to PJ\u2019s empty pint on the table.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ shakes his head. \u201cI said the drinks were on me tonight!\u201d He stands up and grabs the pint and the bottle. \u201cI\u2019ll go grab us a few drinks. What would you like?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSurprise me.\u201d Phil says, climbing back onto the stool and sitting down.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan hadn\u2019t been able to text him much but Phil did find himself replying back to Dan\u2019s photo with a smiley face. He doesn\u2019t know why that is what he sent but he did and he can\u2019t take it back. And he also doesn\u2019t want to take it back because Dan sent back a blushing emoji.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe still hasn\u2019t been on Twitter or Instagram or YouTube and that\u2019s okay because he doesn\u2019t want to read everything that he knows is going to be on there. He wants to remain a happy medium in this entire situation.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhich reminds him, he\u2019s going to need to go on his YouTube eventually because he\u2019ll need to make another video soon. What should he even do for this new video? Maybe a Q+A? That might be fun? But then that is going to require him to go on Twitter.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI got you another beer.\u201d PJ says, setting a pint down on the table of some pale drink. \u201cIt sounded like one you might like.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lifts up and eyebrow and picks it up, taking a quick sip. He doesn\u2019t particularly like beer but he\u2019ll drink this since PJ bought it and he\u2019ll feel bad not finishing it.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo, what\u2019s the gossip about Dan?\u201d PJ asks, taking a long sip of\u2026that looks like Guinness but \tPhil\u2019s not sure.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat gossip?\u201d Phil asks, genuinely confused.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat\u2019s he like!\u201d PJ asks. \u201cI want to know what the famous guy is like to be around.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s like a normal guy?\u201d Phil says. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s fun and he\u2019s loud. But he also is super understanding and he always is really easy to talk to which you know how awkward I am. But it\u2019s not hard to build a friendship with him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen are you going to ask him out?\u201d PJ asks, taking a long swig of his drink.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil follows and takes a sip, wincing a bit at the bitterness. Yeah, this beer is definitely not his thing. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I will.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou two seem right fond of each other.\u201d PJ says. \u201cThat video was the definition of sexual tension.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil scoffs. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ shook his head. \u201cNo mate. That video\u2026if no one knew who you were, they would have sworn that you were Dan\u2019s boyfriend. I mean, he was looking at you up and down every second.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his face flush. \u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t find me attractive.\u201d He says. \u201cAnd besides, we\u2019re just friends.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ frowns. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cUndermine yourself like that.\u201d PJ says.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks down at his drink. \u201cIt\u2019s true though.\u201d He says. \u201cThere is a reason why guys don\u2019t want to date me after a year.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou just haven\u2019t found the good guys.\u201d PJ presses.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs. \u201cNo one wants to date me, PJ.\u201d He says. \u201cThey just want me to put out for them so they can get off and then they want to leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOnce again,\u201d PJ continues. \u201cYou\u2019re not finding the right guys.\u201d PJ pauses. \u201cI think Dan looks at you differently than I\u2019ve ever seen a guy look at you.\u201d</p><p>\tPhil shakes his head.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo!\u201d PJ adds. \u201cDan is into you, Phil.\u201d He reaches out and lays a hand on Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cDrop some hints at him. I guarantee that he\u2019s into you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow would I even do that?\u201d Phil asks, giving in a little bit. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to flirt. I\u2019m not even sure where to begin. My last boyfriend messaged me over Twitter in my Dm\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJust say things to him that might come off as flirty. Tell him you like his shirt or maybe you\u2019d like to see it off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPeej!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m being serious, Phil! Maybe send him more photos. Send him a selfie and see if he\u2019ll send one back. Hell, send him a picture of your dick and see if he\u2019ll one back.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not doing that, PJ!\u201d Phil exclaimed, his voice drowned out, thankfully, by the loud murmurs. \u201cFor one, I think that counts as sexual harassment on paper.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ rolls his eyes. \u201cWell, then just talk with him and get a little bit flirtier. Tell him he has great eyes and that you want to get lost in them. Tell him he has a great body and you want to get lost in it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil scoffs and feels his face flush\u2015and it\u2019s not from the alcohol or the warm room. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJust try it!\u201d PJ presses. \u201cGet out your phone and send him a text.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cRight now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYes, right now!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis is ridiculous and stupid.\u201d Phil says as he reaches into his pocket and pulls out his phone. He sets it on the table and PJ gestures to it.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSend Dan a text. Just send him something short. Maybe like a \u201cI miss you\u201d or \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you again\u201d. Just start simple.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil bites his lip and opens up his phone, clicking on the messages app and opening up Dan\u2019s messages. \u201cWhat was the last thing he sent you?\u201d PJ asks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cA selfie.\u201d Phil says, looking down at the photo.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, what did you say to him about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis feels like an interrogation.\u201d Phil counters.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, do you want to get laid or not?\u201d Pj asks and Phil lets out a breath. He picks up his beer and takes a long sip. He\u2019s going to need it.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI just sent him an emoji.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOH PHIL!\u201d PJ cried. \u201cWhat emoji did you send? Please tell me it was the eggplant.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil coughed and blushed. \u201cIt was just a smiley emoji.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ cried out again and reached for Phil\u2019s phone, snatching it from his hands. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Phil protested, reaching for it. But PJ\u2019s fingers were too fast and he was typing and all Phil could do was wait.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ handed his phone back to him and Phil takes another swig of his beer before grabbing it. He reads it over and feels the color drain from his face.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>I forgot to tell you this earlier but I think you look amazing.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPJ he\u2019s going to think I\u2019m weird!\u201d Phil whines. \u201cThis is too much!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo, it won\u2019t be.\u201d PJ said. \u201cJust wait and see.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tNo messages come as Phil finishes his beer and PJ finishes his. Neither one of them want another drink so they both leave, completely sober still and head back to their flats.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gets into his flat at a little after 10 and greets Spike with a little rub down and then a chance to go to the courtyard for the bathroom. When he lets Spike back in, he goes to the bathroom himself and gets ready for bed.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe goes to his bedroom and climbs into bed, knowing he has to be up early to go to work tomorrow. He grabs his phone and goes to plug it in when he sees a message from Dan that stops his heart.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>thank you &lt;3 but I think its you that looks amazing not me\u00a0</p>",

Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 3.5k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and mentions of sex\u00a0</p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit\u00a0</p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday at 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/42789464\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a>**</b></p><p><b>A/N:\u00a0</b>Surprise! i had this chapter done so I decided to post it anyway :) don\u2019t get used to having the same upload schedule though if I do in fact have chapters done. This is just because this chapter is 3.4k and i think it\u2019s the best I\u2019ve written so far so I\u2019m eager to see you guys read it!</p>[[MORE]]<p>\tDan\u2019s name popped up on Phil\u2019s phone under a feeling of vibrations. Phil found himself holding his breath, willing his stomach to unknot and the feeling of guilt to leave. He shut his eyes briefly and attempted to run his hands through his slightly sweaty hair to hide what just happened. Unfortunately, the blush in his cheeks was going to last a while.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe unlocked his phone and answered Dan\u2019s Facetime request. On the screen, Dan\u2019s face popped up and he was in a dimly lit room with a rack of clothing behind where he was sat. Phil assumed he was still on set.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt was so awful, Phil!\u201d Dan whined, his voice childlike. \u201cThe director wanted us to do all this crazy shit and God, it\u2019s going to look so fake. I can tell already. And I wasn\u2019t into. Mimei wasn\u2019t into it. It was just awkward.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Phil says, biting his lip. He genuinely was sorry. He still couldn\u2019t imagine how it must feel to be forced into a scene like that. He assumed that Dan still had a bit of say in the matter but at the same time, he doubted that.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a sigh. \u201cI have to go back on set for another scene in fifteen minutes but I really needed to\u2015why are your cheeks flushed? Did you just go for a run or something?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his cheeks flush even redder as blood rushed to his face. \u201cOh\u2026uh\u2026No. Just kind of warm in my flat tonight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan cocked his eyebrow and gave a smirk before he let out a breath along with a chuckle. \u201cOkay mate.\u201d Dan says, dragging out the words, laughing a little himself.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was thoroughly embarrassed now.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYa know,\u201d Dan continues. \u201cIf you were in the middle of a wank, I could have called tonight after I got home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh no!\u201d Phil says, quickly trying to divert the topic. \u201cNo! It wasn\u2019t that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan smirked at him again. \u201cSure, mate.\u201d He lets out a sigh. \u201cI have such a busy week ahead of me. I\u2019m not looking forward to it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell,\u201d Dan says, looking down at his lap before bringing his attention back up to the screen. \u201cTomorrow, I have a cover shoot for People magazine followed by an interview for an article that they\u2019re writing on me to do with my movie. And then the rest of this week, I have a mix of public appearances I have to make. One of them is actually that I\u2019m cutting the ribbon at this new theater in downtown LA near WEHO. And then Friday, I have to attend a premiere for another movie that I was invited to and my manager booked me for. All the rest of the time, I\u2019m filming the rest of the movie.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil listens with intent to everything Dan says and he finds it all a bit overwhelming. Especially considering that Phil is just going to be going to work, eating, playing with Spike, and repeating the process for the foreseeable future. He never had anything as exciting as Dan always had going on.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut in a way, he didn\u2019t envy Dan for that. In fact, he felt bad.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh!\u201d Dan says with a sudden thought. \u201cAnd then this weekend, I\u2019m attending a party that is being held by Kylie Jenner.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his body stiffen. \u201cKylie Jenner?!\u201d He finds himself exclaiming.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods. \u201cYep! She\u2019s hosting a party for her new collection of make up that has to do with \u2018saving world hunger\u2019 or some ploy like that and I was invited by her PR team because apparently I would be good PR to have at the party? I don\u2019t fucking know. So I\u2019m attending. Maybe I\u2019ll get a Kanye autograph while I\u2019m there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhere is it going to be?\u201d Phil asks. \u201cSurely, it\u2019s not at her home, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shrugs. \u201cNo idea actually. I\u2019ll probably just walk in, sip some champagne and have a few cocktails, take a couple of photos, and then peace out for the evening. Those events aren\u2019t really my thing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat sounds exhausting.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine having to be around that many people and having to talk with them and take a bunch of photographs.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNot your type of thing either?\u201d Dan asks, relaxing back in his chair. It creaks and Phil watches Dan\u2019s eyes widen as he quickly looks down at the sides of the chair. Phil chuckled to himself because it sounded like the chair was in pretty bad quality. Probably some cheap plastic seat with a vinyl or canvas fabric to sit on.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not the most social person.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe either.\u201d Dan says. \u201cWhich I know is ironic but\u2026\u201d He shrugs.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you an introvert?\u201d Phil asks. He actually does want to know.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYep.\u201d Dan says with a smile. \u201cAre you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh totally.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh good.\u201d Dan says with a knowing glance. \u201cI was ready to say we can\u2019t be friends if you were an extrovert.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lets out a laugh and Dan follows suit.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut then a loud voice cuts through the laughing to Dan, saying \u201cfive minutes before you\u2019re needed on set.\u201d Dan gives him an apologetic glance and tells Phil that he\u2019ll talk to him later.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t promise that he\u2019ll be awake to answer but he does hope he will be. He wishes Dan better luck on his shoot and then they hang up and Phil is left alone again in his bedroom.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe throws his phone to the side and then stands up from his bed. He walks over to the door and opens it, letting in Spike who was sitting on the other side waiting, his stubby tail wagging back in forth. With the allowance back into the room, Spike runs to the bed and hops on and burrows onto Phil\u2019s pillow, resting his head.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil leaves the room and goes to the bathroom and shuts the door behind him. He walks in and slips his pants off into a pile on the floor. He grabs the bottom of his shirt and takes the off as well, throwing that along with his pants onto the floor. He bends down and turns the water of his shower on and lets the droplets from the faucet run over his fingers. When it\u2019s a suitable temperature, turns on his shower and steps inside, pulling the curtain back.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe stands under the warm mist and washes all of the sweat and dirt from his skin. There are also some particularly stickier areas as well but he takes his time washing all of those away.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe quickly washes his body and then grabs for his shampoo and wets his hair under the water. He pushes it back before the water can drip down his face and he squirts the shampoo into his palm before running it through his hair and lathering it.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s rinsing his hair out, his eyes still closed to avoid getting the shampoo into them. When he knows it\u2019s rinsed out, he steps out of the mist and shakes his head a little, wiping his face off with a damp washcloth that was hanging from the side bar of his tub.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe opens his eyes slowly and realizes that there is a shampoo in his shower that he\u2019s never seen before. He bends over and picks up the bright orange bottle and reads it over. \u201cCurl protectant shampoo for men.\u201d He laughs to himself. For men. How absurd is that? He uses whatever shampoo has the most pleasing scent.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt\u2019s half used and he opens it, gagging a little at the strong scent that comes out it. But he leans back down and takes another sniff. It\u2019s Dan. That scent is Dan. It\u2019s so familiar.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe feels a bit sad now, a pit forming in his stomach. He shouldn\u2019t feel this way about a half used shampoo bottle that Dan must have left behind. He\u2019s never noticed it before in the shower, but most of the time, when he showers, he doesn\u2019t have his contacts in so he blindly grabs for his shampoo and body wash, recognizing the different sized bottles.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sets it back down on the edge of the tub and then turns around, turning off the shower as the water begins to run cool against his skin. He pulls back the curtain and steps out, grabbing a towel from the rack and pushing it up to his face to wipe of the water on his skin.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe grabs the rest of his towels and finishes drying himself off before wrapping them around his body like he always does. He makes a pit stop at the sink and removes his contacts, putting them in the pot before setting them back on the sink. He stumbles blindly from his bathroom, grabbing his dirty clothes on the way, and makes it to his bedroom where he grabs for his glasses on the night stand and puts them on.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike is still sitting on his bed, watching him as he moves around the room and slowly dresses into a new set of pajamas and pants. Once he\u2019s settled into his emoji pajamas and a black shirt, he flops onto his bed and picks up his phone. He has a couple missed messages.\u00a0</p><p>\tOne from PJ and two from his mum.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe looks at the one from PJ first which is just saying \u201cdrinks tonight? My treat.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe looks at the time. It\u2019s a little after 6pm. He could probably do for a drink or two. Not even to get drunk but a couple to ease his mind. He texts back PJ asking for when and where and then opens the texts from his mum.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Mum: </b>are you doing anything this weekend, hun?\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Mum: </b>your father and I would like to see you.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe lets out a sigh and then opens his calendar. He doesn\u2019t have to work this weekend\u2015thank god, but he\u2019s not sure if he can find a way to get to the Isle of Man on such short notice. He\u2019d love to see his parents but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll be plausible.\u00a0</p><p>\tIn the time of him going online and looking up flights, he gets a message from PJ telling him to meet him at this pub near his flat at 7:30. He has time so he goes back on Safari and ends up finding a flight that leaves near 6am this Saturday and then he found a return flight for 8pm on Sunday back to London. He could do that.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe books the flights and then takes a screenshot of the confirmations and sends them to his mum. As soon as the messages are sent, his mum calls him and he answers.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cChild!\u201d She chimes through the speaker.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMum!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou found flights alright?\u201d She asked. \u201cYour father and I weren\u2019t sure if you were going to find any on such short notice.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIsle of Man isn\u2019t exactly a hot spot.\u201d Phil says with a chuckle. \u201cI normally can find flights pretty quickly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell us about Dan when you get here!\u201d She says, wasting no time in bringing him up. \u201cYour father and I have a lot of questions.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let\u2019s out a sigh. \u2018There isn\u2019t much to say, mum.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDear, your father and I have watched Dan in movies before. We have a lot of questions about how you two even met.\u201d She says, her voice soft. \u201cPlus, he\u2019s a nice-looking boy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMum\u2026\u201d He groans, feeling his body cave inward from the secondhand embarrassment.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh hun, you know it\u2019s true.\u201d She says with a laugh. \u201cAnd I also happen to know that he\u2019s your type.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t have a type.\u201d Phil corrects.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d His mum continues. \u201cYour last boyfriend\u2015Jonah? Was it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJoshua.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJoshua! Yes, him! He was tall with curly brown hair and he had brown eyes too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u2018That doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, Phil.\u201d She says and Phil rolls his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick you up from the airport as usual on Saturday. You should visit more often!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of time anymore.\u201d Phil says because it\u2019s true. He really doesn\u2019t have a lot of time anymore between going to work and being busy with work. And he also does have a social life sometimes. Not often, but he does when he goes out with PJ. Like he\u2019s going to tonight.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell make time, child!\u201d She pips up. \u201cWe miss you!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI miss you too, mum.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe can tell she\u2019s smiling on the other side. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you go. But do call a bit more. I\u2019ll see you on Saturday.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe says a quick goodbye to her and then they hang up.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe gets up from bed and begins to get ready for the pub when his phone vibrates against the bed. He\u2019s ready to roll his eyes again, sure that it\u2019s his mum texting him goodnight or something. But instead, it\u2019s from Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe quickly grabs his phone and opens the message. A photo pops up and it\u2019s one from Dan, a selfie in a mirror. He\u2019s dressed in a suit and his hair is perfectly groomed. His eyes are slightly squinted but his body language is poised and just\u2026well, Phil can\u2019t help but feel butterflies when he looks at the photo.\u00a0</p><p>\tYeah, he\u2019s fucked.\u00a0</p><p>\t***</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s one raspberry beer down at the pub and PJ and him are laughing over some dumb thing that they remembered from work that happened nearly two years before. Phil\u2019s not even sure how they got on the subject of this, but he finds himself laughing so hard his sides hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd then Gemma\u2019s face was priceless!\u201d PJ continues, his laugh carrying through the loud atmosphere and Phil is following suit. He picks up his bottle and finishes the rest of the beer before he stands up.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWant another one?\u201d Phil asks, pointing to PJ\u2019s empty pint on the table.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ shakes his head. \u201cI said the drinks were on me tonight!\u201d He stands up and grabs the pint and the bottle. \u201cI\u2019ll go grab us a few drinks. What would you like?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSurprise me.\u201d Phil says, climbing back onto the stool and sitting down.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan hadn\u2019t been able to text him much but Phil did find himself replying back to Dan\u2019s photo with a smiley face. He doesn\u2019t know why that is what he sent but he did and he can\u2019t take it back. And he also doesn\u2019t want to take it back because Dan sent back a blushing emoji.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe still hasn\u2019t been on Twitter or Instagram or YouTube and that\u2019s okay because he doesn\u2019t want to read everything that he knows is going to be on there. He wants to remain a happy medium in this entire situation.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhich reminds him, he\u2019s going to need to go on his YouTube eventually because he\u2019ll need to make another video soon. What should he even do for this new video? Maybe a Q+A? That might be fun? But then that is going to require him to go on Twitter.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI got you another beer.\u201d PJ says, setting a pint down on the table of some pale drink. \u201cIt sounded like one you might like.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lifts up and eyebrow and picks it up, taking a quick sip. He doesn\u2019t particularly like beer but he\u2019ll drink this since PJ bought it and he\u2019ll feel bad not finishing it.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo, what\u2019s the gossip about Dan?\u201d PJ asks, taking a long sip of\u2026that looks like Guinness but \tPhil\u2019s not sure.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat gossip?\u201d Phil asks, genuinely confused.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat\u2019s he like!\u201d PJ asks. \u201cI want to know what the famous guy is like to be around.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s like a normal guy?\u201d Phil says. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s fun and he\u2019s loud. But he also is super understanding and he always is really easy to talk to which you know how awkward I am. But it\u2019s not hard to build a friendship with him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen are you going to ask him out?\u201d PJ asks, taking a long swig of his drink.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil follows and takes a sip, wincing a bit at the bitterness. Yeah, this beer is definitely not his thing. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I will.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou two seem right fond of each other.\u201d PJ says. \u201cThat video was the definition of sexual tension.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil scoffs. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ shook his head. \u201cNo mate. That video\u2026if no one knew who you were, they would have sworn that you were Dan\u2019s boyfriend. I mean, he was looking at you up and down every second.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his face flush. \u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t find me attractive.\u201d He says. \u201cAnd besides, we\u2019re just friends.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ frowns. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cUndermine yourself like that.\u201d PJ says.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks down at his drink. \u201cIt\u2019s true though.\u201d He says. \u201cThere is a reason why guys don\u2019t want to date me after a year.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou just haven\u2019t found the good guys.\u201d PJ presses.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs. \u201cNo one wants to date me, PJ.\u201d He says. \u201cThey just want me to put out for them so they can get off and then they want to leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOnce again,\u201d PJ continues. \u201cYou\u2019re not finding the right guys.\u201d PJ pauses. \u201cI think Dan looks at you differently than I\u2019ve ever seen a guy look at you.\u201d</p><p>\tPhil shakes his head.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo!\u201d PJ adds. \u201cDan is into you, Phil.\u201d He reaches out and lays a hand on Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cDrop some hints at him. I guarantee that he\u2019s into you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow would I even do that?\u201d Phil asks, giving in a little bit. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to flirt. I\u2019m not even sure where to begin. My last boyfriend messaged me over Twitter in my Dm\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJust say things to him that might come off as flirty. Tell him you like his shirt or maybe you\u2019d like to see it off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPeej!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m being serious, Phil! Maybe send him more photos. Send him a selfie and see if he\u2019ll send one back. Hell, send him a picture of your dick and see if he\u2019ll one back.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not doing that, PJ!\u201d Phil exclaimed, his voice drowned out, thankfully, by the loud murmurs. \u201cFor one, I think that counts as sexual harassment on paper.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ rolls his eyes. \u201cWell, then just talk with him and get a little bit flirtier. Tell him he has great eyes and that you want to get lost in them. Tell him he has a great body and you want to get lost in it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil scoffs and feels his face flush\u2015and it\u2019s not from the alcohol or the warm room. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJust try it!\u201d PJ presses. \u201cGet out your phone and send him a text.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cRight now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYes, right now!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis is ridiculous and stupid.\u201d Phil says as he reaches into his pocket and pulls out his phone. He sets it on the table and PJ gestures to it.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSend Dan a text. Just send him something short. Maybe like a \u201cI miss you\u201d or \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you again\u201d. Just start simple.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil bites his lip and opens up his phone, clicking on the messages app and opening up Dan\u2019s messages. \u201cWhat was the last thing he sent you?\u201d PJ asks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cA selfie.\u201d Phil says, looking down at the photo.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, what did you say to him about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis feels like an interrogation.\u201d Phil counters.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, do you want to get laid or not?\u201d Pj asks and Phil lets out a breath. He picks up his beer and takes a long sip. He\u2019s going to need it.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI just sent him an emoji.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOH PHIL!\u201d PJ cried. \u201cWhat emoji did you send? Please tell me it was the eggplant.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil coughed and blushed. \u201cIt was just a smiley emoji.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ cried out again and reached for Phil\u2019s phone, snatching it from his hands. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Phil protested, reaching for it. But PJ\u2019s fingers were too fast and he was typing and all Phil could do was wait.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ handed his phone back to him and Phil takes another swig of his beer before grabbing it. He reads it over and feels the color drain from his face.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>I forgot to tell you this earlier but I think you look amazing.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPJ he\u2019s going to think I\u2019m weird!\u201d Phil whines. \u201cThis is too much!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo, it won\u2019t be.\u201d PJ said. \u201cJust wait and see.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tNo messages come as Phil finishes his beer and PJ finishes his. Neither one of them want another drink so they both leave, completely sober still and head back to their flats.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gets into his flat at a little after 10 and greets Spike with a little rub down and then a chance to go to the courtyard for the bathroom. When he lets Spike back in, he goes to the bathroom himself and gets ready for bed.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe goes to his bedroom and climbs into bed, knowing he has to be up early to go to work tomorrow. He grabs his phone and goes to plug it in when he sees a message from Dan that stops his heart.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>thank you &lt;3 but I think its you that looks amazing not me\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Summary</b>: Phil Lester was a worker for the BBC in London. Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood &lsquo;It&rsquo; star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br /></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 3.5k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and mentions of sex&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit&nbsp;</p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday at 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/42789464\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a>**</b></p><p><b>A/N:&nbsp;</b>Surprise! i had this chapter done so I decided to post it anyway :) don&rsquo;t get used to having the same upload schedule though if I do in fact have chapters done. This is just because this chapter is 3.4k and i think it&rsquo;s the best I&rsquo;ve written so far so I&rsquo;m eager to see you guys read it!</p><p>\tDan&rsquo;s name popped up on Phil&rsquo;s phone under a feeling of vibrations. Phil found himself holding his breath, willing his stomach to unknot and the feeling of guilt to leave. He shut his eyes briefly and attempted to run his hands through his slightly sweaty hair to hide what just happened. Unfortunately, the blush in his cheeks was going to last a while.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe unlocked his phone and answered Dan&rsquo;s Facetime request. On the screen, Dan&rsquo;s face popped up and he was in a dimly lit room with a rack of clothing behind where he was sat. Phil assumed he was still on set.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It was so awful, Phil!&rdquo; Dan whined, his voice childlike. &ldquo;The director wanted us to do all this crazy shit and God, it&rsquo;s going to look so fake. I can tell already. And I wasn&rsquo;t into. Mimei wasn&rsquo;t into it. It was just awkward.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Phil says, biting his lip. He genuinely was sorry. He still couldn&rsquo;t imagine how it must feel to be forced into a scene like that. He assumed that Dan still had a bit of say in the matter but at the same time, he doubted that.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan let out a sigh. &ldquo;I have to go back on set for another scene in fifteen minutes but I really needed to&#8213;why are your cheeks flushed? Did you just go for a run or something?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil felt his cheeks flush even redder as blood rushed to his face. &ldquo;Oh&hellip;uh&hellip;No. Just kind of warm in my flat tonight.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan cocked his eyebrow and gave a smirk before he let out a breath along with a chuckle. &ldquo;Okay mate.&rdquo; Dan says, dragging out the words, laughing a little himself.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil was thoroughly embarrassed now.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Ya know,&rdquo; Dan continues. &ldquo;If you were in the middle of a wank, I could have called tonight after I got home.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; Phil says, quickly trying to divert the topic. &ldquo;No! It wasn&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan smirked at him again. &ldquo;Sure, mate.&rdquo; He lets out a sigh. &ldquo;I have such a busy week ahead of me. I&rsquo;m not looking forward to it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dan says, looking down at his lap before bringing his attention back up to the screen. &ldquo;Tomorrow, I have a cover shoot for People magazine followed by an interview for an article that they&rsquo;re writing on me to do with my movie. And then the rest of this week, I have a mix of public appearances I have to make. One of them is actually that I&rsquo;m cutting the ribbon at this new theater in downtown LA near WEHO. And then Friday, I have to attend a premiere for another movie that I was invited to and my manager booked me for. All the rest of the time, I&rsquo;m filming the rest of the movie.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil listens with intent to everything Dan says and he finds it all a bit overwhelming. Especially considering that Phil is just going to be going to work, eating, playing with Spike, and repeating the process for the foreseeable future. He never had anything as exciting as Dan always had going on.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut in a way, he didn&rsquo;t envy Dan for that. In fact, he felt bad.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Dan says with a sudden thought. &ldquo;And then this weekend, I&rsquo;m attending a party that is being held by Kylie Jenner.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil feels his body stiffen. &ldquo;Kylie Jenner?!&rdquo; He finds himself exclaiming.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nods. &ldquo;Yep! She&rsquo;s hosting a party for her new collection of make up that has to do with &lsquo;saving world hunger&rsquo; or some ploy like that and I was invited by her PR team because apparently I would be good PR to have at the party? I don&rsquo;t fucking know. So I&rsquo;m attending. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get a Kanye autograph while I&rsquo;m there.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Where is it going to be?&rdquo; Phil asks. &ldquo;Surely, it&rsquo;s not at her home, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan shrugs. &ldquo;No idea actually. I&rsquo;ll probably just walk in, sip some champagne and have a few cocktails, take a couple of photos, and then peace out for the evening. Those events aren&rsquo;t really my thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;That sounds exhausting.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine having to be around that many people and having to talk with them and take a bunch of photographs.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Not your type of thing either?&rdquo; Dan asks, relaxing back in his chair. It creaks and Phil watches Dan&rsquo;s eyes widen as he quickly looks down at the sides of the chair. Phil chuckled to himself because it sounded like the chair was in pretty bad quality. Probably some cheap plastic seat with a vinyl or canvas fabric to sit on.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not the most social person.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Me either.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Which I know is ironic but&hellip;&rdquo; He shrugs.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you an introvert?&rdquo; Phil asks. He actually does want to know.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Dan says with a smile. &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh totally.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh good.&rdquo; Dan says with a knowing glance. &ldquo;I was ready to say we can&rsquo;t be friends if you were an extrovert.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil lets out a laugh and Dan follows suit.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut then a loud voice cuts through the laughing to Dan, saying &ldquo;five minutes before you&rsquo;re needed on set.&rdquo; Dan gives him an apologetic glance and tells Phil that he&rsquo;ll talk to him later.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil doesn&rsquo;t promise that he&rsquo;ll be awake to answer but he does hope he will be. He wishes Dan better luck on his shoot and then they hang up and Phil is left alone again in his bedroom.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe throws his phone to the side and then stands up from his bed. He walks over to the door and opens it, letting in Spike who was sitting on the other side waiting, his stubby tail wagging back in forth. With the allowance back into the room, Spike runs to the bed and hops on and burrows onto Phil&rsquo;s pillow, resting his head.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil leaves the room and goes to the bathroom and shuts the door behind him. He walks in and slips his pants off into a pile on the floor. He grabs the bottom of his shirt and takes the off as well, throwing that along with his pants onto the floor. He bends down and turns the water of his shower on and lets the droplets from the faucet run over his fingers. When it&rsquo;s a suitable temperature, turns on his shower and steps inside, pulling the curtain back.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe stands under the warm mist and washes all of the sweat and dirt from his skin. There are also some particularly stickier areas as well but he takes his time washing all of those away.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe quickly washes his body and then grabs for his shampoo and wets his hair under the water. He pushes it back before the water can drip down his face and he squirts the shampoo into his palm before running it through his hair and lathering it.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s rinsing his hair out, his eyes still closed to avoid getting the shampoo into them. When he knows it&rsquo;s rinsed out, he steps out of the mist and shakes his head a little, wiping his face off with a damp washcloth that was hanging from the side bar of his tub.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe opens his eyes slowly and realizes that there is a shampoo in his shower that he&rsquo;s never seen before. He bends over and picks up the bright orange bottle and reads it over. &ldquo;Curl protectant shampoo for men.&rdquo; He laughs to himself. For men. How absurd is that? He uses whatever shampoo has the most pleasing scent.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt&rsquo;s half used and he opens it, gagging a little at the strong scent that comes out it. But he leans back down and takes another sniff. It&rsquo;s Dan. That scent is Dan. It&rsquo;s so familiar.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe feels a bit sad now, a pit forming in his stomach. He shouldn&rsquo;t feel this way about a half used shampoo bottle that Dan must have left behind. He&rsquo;s never noticed it before in the shower, but most of the time, when he showers, he doesn&rsquo;t have his contacts in so he blindly grabs for his shampoo and body wash, recognizing the different sized bottles.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe sets it back down on the edge of the tub and then turns around, turning off the shower as the water begins to run cool against his skin. He pulls back the curtain and steps out, grabbing a towel from the rack and pushing it up to his face to wipe of the water on his skin.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe grabs the rest of his towels and finishes drying himself off before wrapping them around his body like he always does. He makes a pit stop at the sink and removes his contacts, putting them in the pot before setting them back on the sink. He stumbles blindly from his bathroom, grabbing his dirty clothes on the way, and makes it to his bedroom where he grabs for his glasses on the night stand and puts them on.&nbsp;</p><p>\tSpike is still sitting on his bed, watching him as he moves around the room and slowly dresses into a new set of pajamas and pants. Once he&rsquo;s settled into his emoji pajamas and a black shirt, he flops onto his bed and picks up his phone. He has a couple missed messages.&nbsp;</p><p>\tOne from PJ and two from his mum.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe looks at the one from PJ first which is just saying &ldquo;drinks tonight? My treat.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe looks at the time. It&rsquo;s a little after 6pm. He could probably do for a drink or two. Not even to get drunk but a couple to ease his mind. He texts back PJ asking for when and where and then opens the texts from his mum.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Mum: </b>are you doing anything this weekend, hun?&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Mum: </b>your father and I would like to see you.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe lets out a sigh and then opens his calendar. He doesn&rsquo;t have to work this weekend&#8213;thank god, but he&rsquo;s not sure if he can find a way to get to the Isle of Man on such short notice. He&rsquo;d love to see his parents but he doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be plausible.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIn the time of him going online and looking up flights, he gets a message from PJ telling him to meet him at this pub near his flat at 7:30. He has time so he goes back on Safari and ends up finding a flight that leaves near 6am this Saturday and then he found a return flight for 8pm on Sunday back to London. He could do that.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe books the flights and then takes a screenshot of the confirmations and sends them to his mum. As soon as the messages are sent, his mum calls him and he answers.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Child!&rdquo; She chimes through the speaker.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Mum!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You found flights alright?&rdquo; She asked. &ldquo;Your father and I weren&rsquo;t sure if you were going to find any on such short notice.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Isle of Man isn&rsquo;t exactly a hot spot.&rdquo; Phil says with a chuckle. &ldquo;I normally can find flights pretty quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tell us about Dan when you get here!&rdquo; She says, wasting no time in bringing him up. &ldquo;Your father and I have a lot of questions.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil let&rsquo;s out a sigh. &lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to say, mum.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Dear, your father and I have watched Dan in movies before. We have a lot of questions about how you two even met.&rdquo; She says, her voice soft. &ldquo;Plus, he&rsquo;s a nice-looking boy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Mum&hellip;&rdquo; He groans, feeling his body cave inward from the secondhand embarrassment.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh hun, you know it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; She says with a laugh. &ldquo;And I also happen to know that he&rsquo;s your type.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a type.&rdquo; Phil corrects.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that.&rdquo; His mum continues. &ldquo;Your last boyfriend&#8213;Jonah? Was it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Joshua.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Joshua! Yes, him! He was tall with curly brown hair and he had brown eyes too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&lsquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean anything.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay, Phil.&rdquo; She says and Phil rolls his eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pick you up from the airport as usual on Saturday. You should visit more often!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time anymore.&rdquo; Phil says because it&rsquo;s true. He really doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of time anymore between going to work and being busy with work. And he also does have a social life sometimes. Not often, but he does when he goes out with PJ. Like he&rsquo;s going to tonight.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well make time, child!&rdquo; She pips up. &ldquo;We miss you!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I miss you too, mum.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe can tell she&rsquo;s smiling on the other side. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll let you go. But do call a bit more. I&rsquo;ll see you on Saturday.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe says a quick goodbye to her and then they hang up.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe gets up from bed and begins to get ready for the pub when his phone vibrates against the bed. He&rsquo;s ready to roll his eyes again, sure that it&rsquo;s his mum texting him goodnight or something. But instead, it&rsquo;s from Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe quickly grabs his phone and opens the message. A photo pops up and it&rsquo;s one from Dan, a selfie in a mirror. He&rsquo;s dressed in a suit and his hair is perfectly groomed. His eyes are slightly squinted but his body language is poised and just&hellip;well, Phil can&rsquo;t help but feel butterflies when he looks at the photo.&nbsp;</p><p>\tYeah, he&rsquo;s fucked.&nbsp;</p><p>\t***</p><p>\tPhil&rsquo;s one raspberry beer down at the pub and PJ and him are laughing over some dumb thing that they remembered from work that happened nearly two years before. Phil&rsquo;s not even sure how they got on the subject of this, but he finds himself laughing so hard his sides hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And then Gemma&rsquo;s face was priceless!&rdquo; PJ continues, his laugh carrying through the loud atmosphere and Phil is following suit. He picks up his bottle and finishes the rest of the beer before he stands up.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Want another one?&rdquo; Phil asks, pointing to PJ&rsquo;s empty pint on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ shakes his head. &ldquo;I said the drinks were on me tonight!&rdquo; He stands up and grabs the pint and the bottle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go grab us a few drinks. What would you like?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Surprise me.&rdquo; Phil says, climbing back onto the stool and sitting down.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan hadn&rsquo;t been able to text him much but Phil did find himself replying back to Dan&rsquo;s photo with a smiley face. He doesn&rsquo;t know why that is what he sent but he did and he can&rsquo;t take it back. And he also doesn&rsquo;t want to take it back because Dan sent back a blushing emoji.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe still hasn&rsquo;t been on Twitter or Instagram or YouTube and that&rsquo;s okay because he doesn&rsquo;t want to read everything that he knows is going to be on there. He wants to remain a happy medium in this entire situation.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhich reminds him, he&rsquo;s going to need to go on his YouTube eventually because he&rsquo;ll need to make another video soon. What should he even do for this new video? Maybe a Q+A? That might be fun? But then that is going to require him to go on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I got you another beer.&rdquo; PJ says, setting a pint down on the table of some pale drink. &ldquo;It sounded like one you might like.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil lifts up and eyebrow and picks it up, taking a quick sip. He doesn&rsquo;t particularly like beer but he&rsquo;ll drink this since PJ bought it and he&rsquo;ll feel bad not finishing it.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s the gossip about Dan?&rdquo; PJ asks, taking a long sip of&hellip;that looks like Guinness but \tPhil&rsquo;s not sure.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What gossip?&rdquo; Phil asks, genuinely confused.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like!&rdquo; PJ asks. &ldquo;I want to know what the famous guy is like to be around.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shrugged. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like a normal guy?&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I mean, he&rsquo;s fun and he&rsquo;s loud. But he also is super understanding and he always is really easy to talk to which you know how awkward I am. But it&rsquo;s not hard to build a friendship with him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;When are you going to ask him out?&rdquo; PJ asks, taking a long swig of his drink.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil follows and takes a sip, wincing a bit at the bitterness. Yeah, this beer is definitely not his thing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know if I will.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You two seem right fond of each other.&rdquo; PJ says. &ldquo;That video was the definition of sexual tension.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil scoffs. &ldquo;I doubt that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ shook his head. &ldquo;No mate. That video&hellip;if no one knew who you were, they would have sworn that you were Dan&rsquo;s boyfriend. I mean, he was looking at you up and down every second.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil felt his face flush. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he doesn&rsquo;t find me attractive.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;And besides, we&rsquo;re just friends.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ frowns. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Undermine yourself like that.&rdquo; PJ says.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looks down at his drink. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true though.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;There is a reason why guys don&rsquo;t want to date me after a year.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You just haven&rsquo;t found the good guys.&rdquo; PJ presses.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shrugs. &ldquo;No one wants to date me, PJ.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;They just want me to put out for them so they can get off and then they want to leave.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Once again,&rdquo; PJ continues. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not finding the right guys.&rdquo; PJ pauses. &ldquo;I think Dan looks at you differently than I&rsquo;ve ever seen a guy look at you.&rdquo;</p><p>\tPhil shakes his head.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No!&rdquo; PJ adds. &ldquo;Dan is into you, Phil.&rdquo; He reaches out and lays a hand on Phil&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Drop some hints at him. I guarantee that he&rsquo;s into you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;How would I even do that?&rdquo; Phil asks, giving in a little bit. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to flirt. I&rsquo;m not even sure where to begin. My last boyfriend messaged me over Twitter in my Dm&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Just say things to him that might come off as flirty. Tell him you like his shirt or maybe you&rsquo;d like to see it off.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Peej!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m being serious, Phil! Maybe send him more photos. Send him a selfie and see if he&rsquo;ll send one back. Hell, send him a picture of your dick and see if he&rsquo;ll one back.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing that, PJ!&rdquo; Phil exclaimed, his voice drowned out, thankfully, by the loud murmurs. &ldquo;For one, I think that counts as sexual harassment on paper.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ rolls his eyes. &ldquo;Well, then just talk with him and get a little bit flirtier. Tell him he has great eyes and that you want to get lost in them. Tell him he has a great body and you want to get lost in it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil scoffs and feels his face flush&#8213;and it&rsquo;s not from the alcohol or the warm room. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Just try it!&rdquo; PJ presses. &ldquo;Get out your phone and send him a text.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Right now?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes, right now!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;This is ridiculous and stupid.&rdquo; Phil says as he reaches into his pocket and pulls out his phone. He sets it on the table and PJ gestures to it.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Send Dan a text. Just send him something short. Maybe like a &ldquo;I miss you&rdquo; or &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait to see you again&rdquo;. Just start simple.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil bites his lip and opens up his phone, clicking on the messages app and opening up Dan&rsquo;s messages. &ldquo;What was the last thing he sent you?&rdquo; PJ asks.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;A selfie.&rdquo; Phil says, looking down at the photo.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay, what did you say to him about it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;This feels like an interrogation.&rdquo; Phil counters.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well, do you want to get laid or not?&rdquo; Pj asks and Phil lets out a breath. He picks up his beer and takes a long sip. He&rsquo;s going to need it.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I just sent him an emoji.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;OH PHIL!&rdquo; PJ cried. &ldquo;What emoji did you send? Please tell me it was the eggplant.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil coughed and blushed. &ldquo;It was just a smiley emoji.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ cried out again and reached for Phil&rsquo;s phone, snatching it from his hands. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Phil protested, reaching for it. But PJ&rsquo;s fingers were too fast and he was typing and all Phil could do was wait.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ handed his phone back to him and Phil takes another swig of his beer before grabbing it. He reads it over and feels the color drain from his face.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Phil: </b>I forgot to tell you this earlier but I think you look amazing.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;PJ he&rsquo;s going to think I&rsquo;m weird!&rdquo; Phil whines. &ldquo;This is too much!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; PJ said. &ldquo;Just wait and see.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tNo messages come as Phil finishes his beer and PJ finishes his. Neither one of them want another drink so they both leave, completely sober still and head back to their flats.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil gets into his flat at a little after 10 and greets Spike with a little rub down and then a chance to go to the courtyard for the bathroom. When he lets Spike back in, he goes to the bathroom himself and gets ready for bed.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe goes to his bedroom and climbs into bed, knowing he has to be up early to go to work tomorrow. He grabs his phone and goes to plug it in when he sees a message from Dan that stops his heart.&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>thank you &lt;3 but I think its you that looks amazing not me&nbsp;</p>",
