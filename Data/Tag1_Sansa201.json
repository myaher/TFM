The only thing she did was trained herself with Brienne, threatened Sansa, and giving unnecessary problems to Sansa, while there are so many works still left for Sansa to do. If Arya is that useful, instead of degraded, attacked, and make Sansa's life harder for no reason, she can actually help lessen Sansa works.",

She&rsquo;s supposed to not be &ldquo;useless&rdquo; like SaLsA is, she&rsquo;s supposed to be loyal to a fault towards her House, she&rsquo;s supposed to be smarter and more resourceful- <i>so when is she actually going to act like it? </i></p><p>Sansa and Jon have done the hard work.

        "answer": "<p>If I want to be completely honest, I really don\u2019t know. That\u2019s something I\u2019m a bit worried about the next season, it\u2019s what they are going to do with Sansa\u2019s love life. I really want her to find happiness with someone who appreciates and respects her who is close to her age. That\u2019s been a dream of hers since she was a child, and as much as people dismiss it, or portray it as a worthless dream, it\u2019s completely valid for her. That being said, it\u2019s not exactly something she had shown any interest in the past few seasons, mostly due to her traumatic rape. A lot of rape victims do start to trust less and see things much more pessimistically, which makes sense considering what they went through, but I think it\u2019s rather important to start demystifying myths that rape victims are used goods incapable of finding love and being happy and wanting to enter relationships and get married. Life isn\u2019t defined by that experience, and it would be really powerful to see Sansa manage to find happiness with someone after all she went through. She doesn\u2019t need to end up with someone, but seeing as it is something that she had wanted for so long, I would love for her to get that happiness.\u00a0</p><p>Now, when it comes to who will sweep her off her feets, that\u2019s another question entirely. I can say who that won\u2019t be. Some people tried to push her into Ramsey and/or Petyr, but both of them are dead (thank god), so that\u2019s not happening obviously. I really don\u2019t think there are any chance that Sandor and Sansa will end up together. Not only did the show removed a big part of their scenes together, but Sansa has never mentioned him after he left King\u2019s Landing and Sandor seems more defined by his travels with Arya than with all that happened with Sansa. So it does seem like they\u2019re not going to enter that path, which I\u2019m also very glad about. When it comes to Sansa and Tyrion, it doesn\u2019t seem that likely either. According to interviews, Tyrion is in love with Daenerys (i never caught that while watching the show, which speaks volume on how badly they seem to handle these romances lately) and while he could move on from her and enter a relationship/marriage with Sansa, it really doesn\u2019t seem likely. I also wouldn\u2019t like it not only because of the age difference, but it would support the whole idea of Sansa not being mature enough as a child to appreciate Tyrion, but now that she\u2019s an adult, she can realize how good he was to her and\u2026well\u2026I really don\u2019t want that. As much as I like that ship, I don\u2019t see any last minute Harry and Sansa ship happening anytime soon because they left his character out completely and never mentioned him.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s Jonsa. Do I ship it? No, I don\u2019t, but I don\u2019t have any problems with it happening because that relationship would not only give Sansa what she wants but is one where there isn\u2019t a wide age difference, and isn\u2019t toxic/abusive. It could very much happen but I wouldn\u2019t bet any money on it. In the original outline, Jon\u2019s sister ended up running to the wall, and they ended up getting feelings for each other that they tried to ignore them until the reveal that they weren\u2019t actually siblings. GRRM could have very much swapped Arya with Sansa as being that sister seeing as his plans for the both of them have completely changed. There\u2019s also multiple theories such as the Ashford Tourney one which makes it more likely, GRRM commenting on a Jonsa post in a interesting manner implying that there\u2019s been a buildup for it in the text (there are multiple metas that elaborate on that buildup), there would be a lot of political advantageous to such a marriage, and you could link multiple romantic tropes to their scenes. However, while I do think that the Starks are going to prevail, the chance of that relationship happening is not very likely in my opinion. Honestly, we\u2019ll just see when the Season happens.\u00a0</p>",

        "body": "<p>When dudes say that Sansa is annoying or that they hope horrible things happen to her I remember how the first time I read her chapters I was constantly terrified for her. What her chapters do really well is encapsulate the fear of assault that is in the back of every woman&rsquo;s mind, so when men respond to that with annoyance and hate it does say something about their inability or unwillingness to empathize with women. Remember that post about the bank analogy that comes around every so often about how men do not understand why women are afraid of men unless it&rsquo;s put in terms they explicitly identify with? One of the reasons Sansa gets so much hate is because she&rsquo;s constantly under the threat of assault and men either can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t want to empathize with that.</p><p>That&rsquo;s also the reason Sansa is getting less hate now that the show has &ldquo;empowered&rdquo; her (after fulfilling the wishes of everyone who wanted to see her be raped first, of course).</p><p>This is why the fandom needed to empathize with Sansa from the very beginning of the story regardless of how kind or empowered or good she was.</p><p>Of course, the fear of assault is present in the storylines of other characters, too (and I could talk for days about how this is overlooked or outright disregarded in the narratives of girls or women who don&rsquo;t fit idealized expectations of femininity, like Arya or Dany, or even in Tyrion&rsquo;s narrative, because he&rsquo;s a disabled adult man. GRRM sets us up to constantly fear for Sansa&rsquo;s sexual purity because she&rsquo;s an idealized ingenue archetype, and there is misogyny in that narrative. I also think GRRM himself does not treat the characters fairly in this respect.

She&rsquo;s perhaps the kindest character in the entire series, the most genuine and yet the most lacking of love, but everyone wants to use her for optics or money. She&rsquo;s so underrated because her interests and skills are highly associated with femininity. Everyone loves to ignore the fact that it takes a special kind of person to survive five years of a hostage situation and the deaths of multiple family members. I&rsquo;ll fight anyone who tries to argue against that and I&rsquo;ll defend Sansa to my death.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>It seems this is a good time to answer your post, since we were reminded by some of the more vocal even on tumblr how \u2018awful\u2019 Sansa is.   It seems even here we do have to fight for the \u2018Sansa Stark defence squad\u2019 once in a while.</p><p>I must admit that I myself have not always loved Sansa. I liked Jon from the start and I really related to Arya - coming from a similar situation like Arya myself. I do have an older sister who is traditionally feminine and I wanted to run with the boys and played soccer with my brother. And it took me a while to re-evaluate Sansa. I sort of pitied her ever since Ned died and read her chapters with greater interest until I reached the Battle of the Blackwater. The scene with the Hound really struck a cord in me. Sansa was threatened by a big, dangerous man and her resilience in this situation, the fact that she sang, but not the song he wanted and that the \u2018magic\u2019 of her plead for mercy was so strong that a brutal man relented from brutally abducting and maybe raping her had me moved to tears. Ever since then I\u2019ve been on Sansa\u2019s side. It is such a well written scene! - </p><p>(Just for the record : I don\u2019t ship SanSan, I\u2019ve never shipped it, I have pity with the Hound but I think his role is to die as a real knight in defence of the weak. The purpose of this scene was not romantic but to show the power of Sansa\u2019s soft &lsquo;magic\u2019, the singing that is parallel to Tolkien\u2019s Luthien - as I explained in my Beren and Luthien meta (link to the third part <a href=\"https://fedonciadale.tumblr.com/post/171595236550/tolkien-and-grrm-the-tale-of-beren-and-luthien\">here</a>) months before someone stole this [sry for the deviation\u2026 Still pissed the other side of the fandom takes our things minus the Jonsa parts and tries to pimp their own mediocre takes, althought others were done much more badly than me]).</p><p>I may not have liked Sansa from the beginning but since I\u2019ve always been House Stark, Sansa did have a small part in my heart all the time. Because I rooted for all the Starks. And this is why I don\u2019t get the hate Sansa gets from some Arya fans. I mean if you like Arya, you presumably like House Stark, and House Stark includes Sansa - who identifies internally as a Stark ever since her father died. She might be your least favourite Stark but why deny that she is one? I mean I sort of get Da\u20acnerys fans who don\u2019t like Sansa - she is the daughter of one of the usurper\u2019s dogs after all - but anyone who is on Team House Stark and wishes Sansa dead should get their membership card revoked.</p><p>So, some (not all of course) of Arya\u2019s fans want things Arya herself would never want: being Queen, Sansa dead etc. and I while do know that things can be read differently, how they come to the idea that the sisters genuinely hate each other is beyond me.</p><p>The VF article has not improved the bad takes on Sansa. People seem not to understand, that what we actually see on screen and what the actors are told is more relevant than something that was pinned down in advance, where the writers very clearly wrote down what they want to be the General audience\u2019s take in that situation. So, Maisie Wiliams telling that she was directed to play the \u201cvillain\u201d is meaningless, while a part from the script where they want to dupe the audience into believing in Starkbowl is gospel. <br/></p><p>And it is always like that. I do think that by now, Sansa could be a veritable angel (which she is not) and they would still find something to blame on her. And they contradict themselves as well: Sansa is stupid and naiv and a slow learner but she is also this deft manipulator without scruples (manipulating the Northern Lords into liking her, while she is working to depose Jon). You know the woman who said \u2018Only a fool trusts Littlefinger\u2019 (in a setting where she has no reason to lie), somehow trusts Littlefinger? The woman who declines to be declared queen instead of the absent Jon is working against him (because she was waiting for a <b>better moment</b> to be declared queen or what?). The woman who cares for the armour and the food of her people is a self-centred entitled narcist\u2026 And you know, even with the subpar writing of season 7, it should be even possible to think that Sansa did not trust Littlefinger and was still worried about what Arya would do. It is - surprise, surprise - quite possible not to trust someone and still allow for that person to have insight and to learn from them, and it is also possible to mistrust someone you love and be worried about what your impulsive little sister might do, without outright planning to kill her. Because you want to hold everything together in the face of a very dangerous outward threat and the absence of the king, it is only sensible to have an eye on a very dangerous assassin sister who threatened to take over your own face\u2026.<br/></p><p>I guess the reason Sansa hate is so common in this fandom is because GRRM did a really bold thing. He introduced Sansa from the PoV of a little sister whose issues with self-confidence has a lot to do with her older sister (without the older sister rubbing this in I might add - I don\u2019t want to elaborate here, but if you read closely it is quite clear, that Sansa covers for her sister and the \u2018bullying\u2019 that some of the fans blame on her is simply not there). Now our first impression is the beautiful, girly, superficial girl who is a pain in the ass to every girl who does not adhere to society\u2019s strict expectations towards girls, who is not beautiful or does not feel beautiful and is a tomboy. How this trope usually works is that the \u2018bullied\u2019 girl develops from an ugly duck to a beautiful swan, the \u2018mean\u2019 girl falls on hard times because she misjudged people because of her superficiality and is finally punished. Cinderella and her step-sisters show her faces here\u2026 <br/></p><p>I do think that this is the reason why many, many people in the fandom still expect Sansa to die and to be punished, and to be in general a mean character. People expect her to become the mean machinator at Littlefinger\u2019s side and falling beside him, they expect her to die or to become a \u2018fallen woman\u2019 (ending up in a brothel or such, yikes)\u2026 And all because they fell for the PoV in AGOT and they feel for the trope that GRRM has set up and they probably fell for this picture of a \u2018mean girl\u2019 that has plagued their own high school days. (I give them some advice: They\u2019ll never get beyond their own issues if they do not let go of their hatred of that mean high school girl and realise that life is not high school.)<br/></p><p>What GRRM does, is to subvert this type: The \u2018evil older stepsister\u2019 is actually not evil (and never was), she learns from her mistakes and she has character development. But this is usually something that is a prerogative of male heroes. Female heroes may have a learning arc, but that is usually not set up as a character development arc as in overcoming some faults. <br/></p><p>Fandom somehow has no problem with accepting Jaime\u2019s redemption arc or Theon\u2019s, but God forbid to accept character development that is contrary to tropes. Arya begins as a girl whose skills are not valued in her society and it is a quite common trope to have her acquiring more skills and possibly come out on top because of that. Da\u20acnerys is the girl that starts as an absolute underdog and that accumulates power to set right the wrongs done to her. What fandom fails to realise is that Arya is so set on revenge that she has begun to follow a dark path (more so in the show than the books) and that Da\u20acnerys acquires some traits of her abusers along the way to the top. Arya and Da\u20acnerys also subvert tropes but people are blind to that, because theirs are tropes that make the underestimated girl a heroine in the end and they get high on that. They are lured by the tropes as well as the PoV traps. So, Sansa haters are stuck in the preconceptions they acquired while reading AGOT which leads them to grossly misread not only Sansa but others as well (the Hound as a good guy (???) and an important character (when he doesn\u2019t even have a PoV), Arya as hating Sansa, Littlefinger as the master manipulator who\u2019ll recruit Sansa for his cause)<br/></p><p>There is also another reason for Sansa hate which has nothing to do with GRRM but with society. Girly girls are just not fashionable. It is cool to like the tomboy girls, the badass girls, the sassy girls, but not feminine girls - at least in FICTION. In reality this is much more complex. In my experience girly girls - at least after a phase of really irrational hatred during the teenage years, that most sensible people leave behind them - are not hated. This is connected to the overblown expectations people have in regard to women - not only men, but women as well. I would hesitate to call this internalised misogyny, I would rather call this internalised overblown expectations. A woman should be smart (but not so smart that she can outwit a man), she should be strong and badass and independent (but not too independent, she should need male validation after all), but she should also be beautiful and care for her beauty. A girl with a gun chasing villains? Wonderful! But are her legs hairless? Do her nails look good? Does she run in high heels? So, there are many men who would tell you they like badass woman but in reality? They\u2019d rather not have a woman who doesn\u2019t have time to don makeup, shave her legs and do her nails&hellip;. So, hating girly girls in fiction is easy: Men can pretend that they don\u2019t care for girly girls and show how \u2018advanced\u2019 they are by rooting for the tomboy (who after all fits to their male ideals and stresses the idea that male actitivities are \u2018better\u2019) and women can hate on the girly girls, because either they\u2019d rather not be like that (for whatever reason, one of them might be that they also adhere to the ideal that male activities are better) or because they feel the pressure to become girly to fit into society\u2019s expectations that are there despite the fact that women are told at the same time, that being girly is lesser. Being frustrated with this kind of contradictory expectations might make you hate the girly girl type - I can understand that. When I was younger and more naive I did as well.<br/></p><p>It\u2019s a catch 22 really. And as long as people (men and women) won\u2019t realise that feminism is not about all women becoming like men nor about looking down on women who feel comfortable with being a traditional woman and as long as these activities are seen as somehow being lesser we will have people who hate on fictional characters that do question their take on feminity. I have some issues with GRRM\u2019s take on women - mostly because he ignores the importance of female friendships - but I certainly have no issues with the variety of women he describes, nor with the fact that he shows a kind of female strength that is so often ridiculed in fiction and in real world. <br/></p><p>This was a long answer, but honestly, although I\u2019m foremost a Jon Snow fan, this fandom has made me into a member of the Sansa Stark defence squad.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br/></p>",

It seems even here we do have to fight for the \u2018Sansa Stark defence squad\u2019 once in a while.</p><p>I must admit that I myself have not always loved Sansa. I liked Jon from the start and I really related to Arya - coming from a similar situation like Arya myself. I do have an older sister who is traditionally feminine and I wanted to run with the boys and played soccer with my brother. And it took me a while to re-evaluate Sansa. I sort of pitied her ever since Ned died and read her chapters with greater interest until I reached the Battle of the Blackwater. The scene with the Hound really struck a cord in me. Sansa was threatened by a big, dangerous man and her resilience in this situation, the fact that she sang, but not the song he wanted and that the \u2018magic\u2019 of her plead for mercy was so strong that a brutal man relented from brutally abducting and maybe raping her had me moved to tears. Ever since then I\u2019ve been on Sansa\u2019s side. It is such a well written scene! - </p><p>(Just for the record : I don\u2019t ship SanSan, I\u2019ve never shipped it, I have pity with the Hound but I think his role is to die as a real knight in defence of the weak. The purpose of this scene was not romantic but to show the power of Sansa\u2019s soft \u2018magic\u2019, the singing that is parallel to Tolkien\u2019s Luthien - as I explained in my Beren and Luthien meta (link to the third part <a href=\"https://fedonciadale.tumblr.com/post/171595236550/tolkien-and-grrm-the-tale-of-beren-and-luthien\">here</a>) months before someone stole this [sry for the deviation\u2026 Still pissed the other side of the fandom takes our things minus the Jonsa parts and tries to pimp their own mediocre takes, althought others were done much more badly than me]).</p><p>I may not have liked Sansa from the beginning but since I\u2019ve always been House Stark, Sansa did have a small part in my heart all the time. Because I rooted for all the Starks. And this is why I don\u2019t get the hate Sansa gets from some Arya fans. I mean if you like Arya, you presumably like House Stark, and House Stark includes Sansa - who identifies internally as a Stark ever since her father died. She might be your least favourite Stark but why deny that she is one? I mean I sort of get Da\u20acnerys fans who don\u2019t like Sansa - she is the daughter of one of the usurper\u2019s dogs after all - but anyone who is on Team House Stark and wishes Sansa dead should get their membership card revoked.</p><p>So, some (not all of course) of Arya\u2019s fans want things Arya herself would never want: being Queen, Sansa dead etc. and I while do know that things can be read differently, how they come to the idea that the sisters genuinely hate each other is beyond me.</p><p>The VF article has not improved the bad takes on Sansa. People seem not to understand, that what we actually see on screen and what the actors are told is more relevant than something that was pinned down in advance, where the writers very clearly wrote down what they want to be the General audience\u2019s take in that situation. So, Maisie Wiliams telling that she was directed to play the \u201cvillain\u201d is meaningless, while a part from the script where they want to dupe the audience into believing in Starkbowl is gospel. <br></p><p>And it is always like that. I do think that by now, Sansa could be a veritable angel (which she is not) and they would still find something to blame on her. And they contradict themselves as well: Sansa is stupid and naiv and a slow learner but she is also this deft manipulator without scruples (manipulating the Northern Lords into liking her, while she is working to depose Jon). You know the woman who said \u2018Only a fool trusts Littlefinger\u2019 (in a setting where she has no reason to lie), somehow trusts Littlefinger? The woman who declines to be declared queen instead of the absent Jon is working against him (because she was waiting for a <b>better moment</b> to be declared queen or what?). The woman who cares for the armour and the food of her people is a self-centred entitled narcist\u2026 And you know, even with the subpar writing of season 7, it should be even possible to think that Sansa did not trust Littlefinger and was still worried about what Arya would do. It is - surprise, surprise - quite possible not to trust someone and still allow for that person to have insight and to learn from them, and it is also possible to mistrust someone you love and be worried about what your impulsive little sister might do, without outright planning to kill her. Because you want to hold everything together in the face of a very dangerous outward threat and the absence of the king, it is only sensible to have an eye on a very dangerous assassin sister who threatened to take over your own face\u2026.<br></p><p>I guess the reason Sansa hate is so common in this fandom is because GRRM did a really bold thing. He introduced Sansa from the PoV of a little sister whose issues with self-confidence has a lot to do with her older sister (without the older sister rubbing this in I might add - I don\u2019t want to elaborate here, but if you read closely it is quite clear, that Sansa covers for her sister and the \u2018bullying\u2019 that some of the fans blame on her is simply not there). Now our first impression is the beautiful, girly, superficial girl who is a pain in the ass to every girl who does not adhere to society\u2019s strict expectations towards girls, who is not beautiful or does not feel beautiful and is a tomboy. How this trope usually works is that the \u2018bullied\u2019 girl develops from an ugly duck to a beautiful swan, the \u2018mean\u2019 girl falls on hard times because she misjudged people because of her superficiality and is finally punished. Cinderella and her step-sisters show her faces here\u2026 <br></p><p>I do think that this is the reason why many, many people in the fandom still expect Sansa to die and to be punished, and to be in general a mean character. People expect her to become the mean machinator at Littlefinger\u2019s side and falling beside him, they expect her to die or to become a \u2018fallen woman\u2019 (ending up in a brothel or such, yikes)\u2026 And all because they fell for the PoV in AGOT and they feel for the trope that GRRM has set up and they probably fell for this picture of a \u2018mean girl\u2019 that has plagued their own high school days. (I give them some advice: They\u2019ll never get beyond their own issues if they do not let go of their hatred of that mean high school girl and realise that life is not high school.)<br></p><p>What GRRM does, is to subvert this type: The \u2018evil older stepsister\u2019 is actually not evil (and never was), she learns from her mistakes and she has character development. But this is usually something that is a prerogative of male heroes. Female heroes may have a learning arc, but that is usually not set up as a character development arc as in overcoming some faults. <br></p><p>Fandom somehow has no problem with accepting Jaime\u2019s redemption arc or Theon\u2019s, but God forbid to accept character development that is contrary to tropes. Arya begins as a girl whose skills are not valued in her society and it is a quite common trope to have her acquiring more skills and possibly come out on top because of that. Da\u20acnerys is the girl that starts as an absolute underdog and that accumulates power to set right the wrongs done to her. What fandom fails to realise is that Arya is so set on revenge that she has begun to follow a dark path (more so in the show than the books) and that Da\u20acnerys acquires some traits of her abusers along the way to the top. Arya and Da\u20acnerys also subvert tropes but people are blind to that, because theirs are tropes that make the underestimated girl a heroine in the end and they get high on that. They are lured by the tropes as well as the PoV traps. So, Sansa haters are stuck in the preconceptions they acquired while reading AGOT which leads them to grossly misread not only Sansa but others as well (the Hound as a good guy (???) and an important character (when he doesn\u2019t even have a PoV), Arya as hating Sansa, Littlefinger as the master manipulator who\u2019ll recruit Sansa for his cause)<br></p><p>There is also another reason for Sansa hate which has nothing to do with GRRM but with society. Girly girls are just not fashionable. It is cool to like the tomboy girls, the badass girls, the sassy girls, but not feminine girls - at least in FICTION. In reality this is much more complex. In my experience girly girls - at least after a phase of really irrational hatred during the teenage years, that most sensible people leave behind them - are not hated. This is connected to the overblown expectations people have in regard to women - not only men, but women as well. I would hesitate to call this internalised misogyny, I would rather call this internalised overblown expectations. A woman should be smart (but not so smart that she can outwit a man), she should be strong and badass and independent (but not too independent, she should need male validation after all), but she should also be beautiful and care for her beauty. A girl with a gun chasing villains? Wonderful! But are her legs hairless? Do her nails look good? Does she run in high heels? So, there are many men who would tell you they like badass woman but in reality? They\u2019d rather not have a woman who doesn\u2019t have time to don makeup, shave her legs and do her nails\u2026. So, hating girly girls in fiction is easy: Men can pretend that they don\u2019t care for girly girls and show how \u2018advanced\u2019 they are by rooting for the tomboy (who after all fits to their male ideals and stresses the idea that male actitivities are \u2018better\u2019) and women can hate on the girly girls, because either they\u2019d rather not be like that (for whatever reason, one of them might be that they also adhere to the ideal that male activities are better) or because they feel the pressure to become girly to fit into society\u2019s expectations that are there despite the fact that women are told at the same time, that being girly is lesser. Being frustrated with this kind of contradictory expectations might make you hate the girly girl type - I can understand that. When I was younger and more naive I did as well.<br></p><p>It\u2019s a catch 22 really. And as long as people (men and women) won\u2019t realise that feminism is not about all women becoming like men nor about looking down on women who feel comfortable with being a traditional woman and as long as these activities are seen as somehow being lesser we will have people who hate on fictional characters that do question their take on feminity. I have some issues with GRRM\u2019s take on women - mostly because he ignores the importance of female friendships - but I certainly have no issues with the variety of women he describes, nor with the fact that he shows a kind of female strength that is so often ridiculed in fiction and in real world. <br></p><p>This was a long answer, but honestly, although I\u2019m foremost a Jon Snow fan, this fandom has made me into a member of the Sansa Stark defence squad.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br></p>",
