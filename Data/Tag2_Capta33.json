Being an agent of SHIELD meant that you got to see things that were usually hidden to the public. What you didn\u2019t count on when you signed up was the fact that you came into direct contact with the Avengers. They were all so amazing, but Carol Danvers was the one who had your heart. Ever since she had shown up at the SHIELD base, the two of you had gotten along right away. It didn\u2019t take long for her to ask you out on a date, and the rest was history.</p><p>At first, things seemed to be going great. Everything from fighting Thanos together to facing various other threats side by side, the two of you made an amazing team. But after the threats on Earth were dealt with, Carol went out to deal with hostile aliens who might pose a danger to innocent people from different galaxies. There were times when you wouldn\u2019t see her for weeks, or sometimes even months. Even though you felt extremely lonely, you reasoned that was part of dating an Avenger.</p><p>After a rather long campaign at the other end of the galaxy, Carol was finally back home by your side. You had missed her a lot, but the important thing was the fact that she was back with you. Nothing else mattered as you were sprawled out on top of her, listening to her heartbeat and having her arms around you. Even though Carol would never say this out loud, she loved it whenever you were on top of her as she got to stroke your hair.</p><p>\u201cReady to go to work tomorrow?\u201d You could hear the smirk in your girlfriend\u2019s voice, but all you managed to do was to give an extended moan. Even though you loved your job, all you wanted to do was to stay in bed with Carol. \u201cAt least we will be going together.\u201d You nodded slightly as your eyes remained closed.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know when exactly you fell asleep, but the smell of bacon and burnt waffles definitely woke you up. As you sat up in bed, a small furry mass jumped onto the bed <g class=\"gr_ gr_175 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"175\" data-gr-id=\"175\">signalling</g> the arrival of Goose. As you stroked him between his shoulder blades, you whispered, \u201cI think she burned the waffles again.\u201d Goose meowed in agreement, and Carol chose this moment to jump into the room carrying a tray.</p><p>\u201cDid I hear you two discussing my culinary skills again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr lack thereof.\u201d You cackled as you tried to avoid the bits of food being thrown at you. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s see how everything turned out this time.\u201d You picked at the food and offered a piece to Goose, who turned away and jumped off the bed.</p><p>\u201cRude little shit,\u201d Carol climbed on top of the bed. You <g class=\"gr_ gr_170 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"170\" data-gr-id=\"170\">too</g> this time to help yourself to a piece of bacon and gave Goose a piece when he let out a whine. It was a bit overcooked, but you liked it a lot anyway. Everything seemed better when Carol was right there with you. Everything seemed right.</p><p>The thing that you loved most about driving to work with Carol was that she loved holding hands with you while driving. Even though she could have flown to the Avengers base in a fraction of the time it took to drive there, Carol always insisted on driving with you. This way, the two of you got to spend more time with each other. Besides, her hair looked a lot better when the two of you got there.</p><p>Once you got to the Avengers compound, Tony was there to greet you as usual. He had been experimenting with some new drones he had been working on, and they had picked up images of your car from several miles away. He pulled you into a bear hug, and Thor came running along so he could playfully pick you up.</p><p>\u201cHow is my favorite short agent doing? Better now that your space girl is back, huh?\u201d Thor gave you a cheeky wink before skipping off to avoid the punches both you and Carol threw at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure (Y/N) is having a good time now that Carol is back. Now let\u2019s get inside and find out why now that Carol is back. Now let\u2019s get inside and find out why we\u2019re all here. Doctor Strange and the ragtag group of \u2018Guardians\u2019 claim that they\u2019ve found something that warrants our attention.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t like the way Tony said that there was something that needed your attention, but you made your way towards the building anyway with Carol holding your hand. Hopefully, whatever it was, the two of you could be together.</p><p>When you entered the main room, you saw Doctor Strange and the Guardians already gathered there. Strange gave you a curt nod. He saw you as an equally intelligent individual, which was a rare find. The Guardians, on the other hand, saw you as a close friend and confidant considering your openness to bending the rules. However, the look on their faces did not bode good news, and this was only confirmed when they presented what they found. A species of advanced aliens had found the presence of Earth and were making their way towards the planet. It seemed to be a job only fit for the Avengers, and everyone looked ready to go take care of the problem.</p><p>As each Avenger went to their own room on the compound to prepare for the upcoming mission, you went with Carol to help her get ready for the missions ahead. Not being an Avenger, your job was to stay here on Earth and provide backup on the off chance that the Avengers would fail. However, not that Captain Marvel herself was on the team, any alien who would mean her harm didn\u2019t stand a chance. As you helped Carol with her outfit, she reached over to stroke your face.</p><p>\u201cBabe, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026you\u2019ll be going out again, and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be able to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back as soon as I can. I know you miss me whenever I\u2019m gone, but people out there need me. And your support means the world to me.\u201d Carol took your hand and kissed it. She could be so damn charming whenever you were unhappy, and that was one of the many reasons why you loved her.</p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>The Avengers had come and gone with their mission, and most of them had come back to hang out on the base. You have only seen Carol through the screens when she was able to check in, but even those interactions were becoming fewer and farther between. There were no words to describe how much you wanted your girlfriend to come back, but you knew that she was needed in different parts of the universe, and you didn\u2019t want to be selfish. Both Steve and Natasha had offered to keep you company, but you just weren\u2019t in the mood.</p><p>But with every night that passed without any sign of Carol, it was getting harder and harder to not be selfish. Sitting on the porch, you looked up at the stars that littered the sky. You looked down back on your lap with your jaw clenched. On any other night, you would have marveled at the fact that the light from these stars traveled light years in order to bring their light to you. But you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to see how beautiful the night sky was tonight. Every time you looked up, you wanted to see a streak of light that signaled Carol coming back home. You had faithfully sat on this porch for months in the exact same spot, with the same result each night. Maybe everyone else was right, only a crazy person does the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result.</p><p>Standing up, you made your way back inside. You loved Carol, there was no point in arguing about that. But you couldn\u2019t spend your life sitting on the porch waiting for her to come back from some planet on the other end of the galaxy. There was no doubt in your mind that Carol loved you back, but if that were true, she wouldn\u2019t be abandoning you for months on end. A few tears had found their way down your cheeks, and you wiped them away before you actually cried. There was no point in crying when it wouldn\u2019t help make you feel better. Just as you turned on your faucet to wash your dishes, you heard a heavy thud which could only mean one thing: Carol was back.</p><p>The door creaked open, and Carol\u2019s voice carried all around the house. \u201cBabe, I\u2019m home!\u201d</p><p>You came out to meet her, and you hurriedly wiped off the tears from your face. \u201cHey.\u201d You hated how your voice shook as you talked.</p><p>\u201cI thought Goose might have gotten the better of you when I didn\u2019t see anybody on the front porch.\u201d Her attempt at a joking tone fell flat as you didn\u2019t laugh. There was an awkward silence between you, and Carol finally broke it when she said, \u201cBabe, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Carol frowned as she stepped closer to you. \u201cIt\u2019s <g class=\"gr_ gr_165 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"165\" data-gr-id=\"165\">not</g> \u2018nothing\u2019, (Y/N). What\u2019s going on?\u201d She moved to hold your hand, but you drew your hands away from her.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t waiting out on the porch for you because I\u2019m tired of waiting for you to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Where is this coming from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about waiting for months on end to see you. I\u2019m talking about waiting out on that porch every single night hoping to see you come back. I\u2019m tired of being alone, of worrying about you knowing damn well that I can\u2019t do anything to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how important being an Avenger is to me. And I thought that you were okay with me going out on missions. Not every planet has a team of Avengers out to protect them. I thought you would be supportive of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, but I can\u2019t help but think it would have been best if we had never met. Because then I wouldn\u2019t always be worried about you whenever you\u2019re gone saving people on the other end of the universe.\u201d You could see the hurt on Carol\u2019s face, but you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to apologize, at least not now. You knew you would hate yourself later on in the night, but all you could feel right now was the anger and frustration that you\u2019ve bottled up burning a hole in your stomach.</p><p>You knew that what you had said hurt Carol, and you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to face her. The door slammed shut behind you, and you couldn\u2019t help the sinking feeling in your gut that this time, you were truly alone. It didn\u2019t take long for Carol to follow you out into the cold, and she put her leather jacket over your shoulders so you would stop shivering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for not asking you how you felt about me going out on these missions. Being an Avenger is a very important part of my life, but none of what I do would be worth it if I don\u2019t have you. I might be the strongest Avenger, but I\u2019m only strong if I have you by my side.\u201d Carol took your hand, and she gave you a little smile when you laced your fingers together.</p><p>\u201cI just miss you so much.\u201d You mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI miss you too.\u201d Carol took this moment to hug you, and you put your head on her shoulder. It would take a lot of work to make everything feel okay, but that was part of the job description when you were in love with an Avenger.</p>",

Being an agent of SHIELD meant that you got to see things that were usually hidden to the public. What you didn\u2019t count on when you signed up was the fact that you came into direct contact with the Avengers. They were all so amazing, but Carol Danvers was the one who had your heart. Ever since she had shown up at the SHIELD base, the two of you had gotten along right away. It didn\u2019t take long for her to ask you out on a date, and the rest was history.</p><p>At first, things seemed to be going great. Everything from fighting Thanos together to facing various other threats side by side, the two of you made an amazing team. But after the threats on Earth were dealt with, Carol went out to deal with hostile aliens who might pose a danger to innocent people from different galaxies. There were times when you wouldn\u2019t see her for weeks, or sometimes even months. Even though you felt extremely lonely, you reasoned that was part of dating an Avenger.</p><p>After a rather long campaign at the other end of the galaxy, Carol was finally back home by your side. You had missed her a lot, but the important thing was the fact that she was back with you. Nothing else mattered as you were sprawled out on top of her, listening to her heartbeat and having her arms around you. Even though Carol would never say this out loud, she loved it whenever you were on top of her as she got to stroke your hair.</p><p>\u201cReady to go to work tomorrow?\u201d You could hear the smirk in your girlfriend\u2019s voice, but all you managed to do was to give an extended moan. Even though you loved your job, all you wanted to do was to stay in bed with Carol. \u201cAt least we will be going together.\u201d You nodded slightly as your eyes remained closed.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know when exactly you fell asleep, but the smell of bacon and burnt waffles definitely woke you up. As you sat up in bed, a small furry mass jumped onto the bed <g class=\"gr_ gr_175 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"175\" data-gr-id=\"175\">signalling</g> the arrival of Goose. As you stroked him between his shoulder blades, you whispered, \u201cI think she burned the waffles again.\u201d Goose meowed in agreement, and Carol chose this moment to jump into the room carrying a tray.</p><p>\u201cDid I hear you two discussing my culinary skills again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr lack thereof.\u201d You cackled as you tried to avoid the bits of food being thrown at you. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s see how everything turned out this time.\u201d You picked at the food and offered a piece to Goose, who turned away and jumped off the bed.</p><p>\u201cRude little shit,\u201d Carol climbed on top of the bed. You <g class=\"gr_ gr_170 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"170\" data-gr-id=\"170\">too</g> this time to help yourself to a piece of bacon and gave Goose a piece when he let out a whine. It was a bit overcooked, but you liked it a lot anyway. Everything seemed better when Carol was right there with you. Everything seemed right.</p><p>The thing that you loved most about driving to work with Carol was that she loved holding hands with you while driving. Even though she could have flown to the Avengers base in a fraction of the time it took to drive there, Carol always insisted on driving with you. This way, the two of you got to spend more time with each other. Besides, her hair looked a lot better when the two of you got there.</p><p>Once you got to the Avengers compound, Tony was there to greet you as usual. He had been experimenting with some new drones he had been working on, and they had picked up images of your car from several miles away. He pulled you into a bear hug, and Thor came running along so he could playfully pick you up.</p><p>\u201cHow is my favorite short agent doing? Better now that your space girl is back, huh?\u201d Thor gave you a cheeky wink before skipping off to avoid the punches both you and Carol threw at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure (Y/N) is having a good time now that Carol is back. Now let\u2019s get inside and find out why now that Carol is back. Now let\u2019s get inside and find out why we\u2019re all here. Doctor Strange and the ragtag group of \u2018Guardians\u2019 claim that they\u2019ve found something that warrants our attention.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t like the way Tony said that there was something that needed your attention, but you made your way towards the building anyway with Carol holding your hand. Hopefully, whatever it was, the two of you could be together.</p><p>When you entered the main room, you saw Doctor Strange and the Guardians already gathered there. Strange gave you a curt nod. He saw you as an equally intelligent individual, which was a rare find. The Guardians, on the other hand, saw you as a close friend and confidant considering your openness to bending the rules. However, the look on their faces did not bode good news, and this was only confirmed when they presented what they found. A species of advanced aliens had found the presence of Earth and were making their way towards the planet. It seemed to be a job only fit for the Avengers, and everyone looked ready to go take care of the problem.</p><p>As each Avenger went to their own room on the compound to prepare for the upcoming mission, you went with Carol to help her get ready for the missions ahead. Not being an Avenger, your job was to stay here on Earth and provide backup on the off chance that the Avengers would fail. However, not that Captain Marvel herself was on the team, any alien who would mean her harm didn\u2019t stand a chance. As you helped Carol with her outfit, she reached over to stroke your face.</p><p>\u201cBabe, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026you\u2019ll be going out again, and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be able to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back as soon as I can. I know you miss me whenever I\u2019m gone, but people out there need me. And your support means the world to me.\u201d Carol took your hand and kissed it. She could be so damn charming whenever you were unhappy, and that was one of the many reasons why you loved her.</p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>The Avengers had come and gone with their mission, and most of them had come back to hang out on the base. You have only seen Carol through the screens when she was able to check in, but even those interactions were becoming fewer and farther between. There were no words to describe how much you wanted your girlfriend to come back, but you knew that she was needed in different parts of the universe, and you didn\u2019t want to be selfish. Both Steve and Natasha had offered to keep you company, but you just weren\u2019t in the mood.</p><p>But with every night that passed without any sign of Carol, it was getting harder and harder to not be selfish. Sitting on the porch, you looked up at the stars that littered the sky. You looked down back on your lap with your jaw clenched. On any other night, you would have marveled at the fact that the light from these stars traveled light years in order to bring their light to you. But you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to see how beautiful the night sky was tonight. Every time you looked up, you wanted to see a streak of light that signaled Carol coming back home. You had faithfully sat on this porch for months in the exact same spot, with the same result each night. Maybe everyone else was right, only a crazy person does the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result.</p><p>Standing up, you made your way back inside. You loved Carol, there was no point in arguing about that. But you couldn\u2019t spend your life sitting on the porch waiting for her to come back from some planet on the other end of the galaxy. There was no doubt in your mind that Carol loved you back, but if that were true, she wouldn\u2019t be abandoning you for months on end. A few tears had found their way down your cheeks, and you wiped them away before you actually cried. There was no point in crying when it wouldn\u2019t help make you feel better. Just as you turned on your faucet to wash your dishes, you heard a heavy thud which could only mean one thing: Carol was back.</p><p>The door creaked open, and Carol\u2019s voice carried all around the house. \u201cBabe, I\u2019m home!\u201d</p><p>You came out to meet her, and you hurriedly wiped off the tears from your face. \u201cHey.\u201d You hated how your voice shook as you talked.</p><p>\u201cI thought Goose might have gotten the better of you when I didn\u2019t see anybody on the front porch.\u201d Her attempt at a joking tone fell flat as you didn\u2019t laugh. There was an awkward silence between you, and Carol finally broke it when she said, \u201cBabe, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Carol frowned as she stepped closer to you. \u201cIt\u2019s <g class=\"gr_ gr_165 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"165\" data-gr-id=\"165\">not</g> \u2018nothing\u2019, (Y/N). What\u2019s going on?\u201d She moved to hold your hand, but you drew your hands away from her.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t waiting out on the porch for you because I\u2019m tired of waiting for you to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Where is this coming from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about waiting for months on end to see you. I\u2019m talking about waiting out on that porch every single night hoping to see you come back. I\u2019m tired of being alone, of worrying about you knowing damn well that I can\u2019t do anything to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how important being an Avenger is to me. And I thought that you were okay with me going out on missions. Not every planet has a team of Avengers out to protect them. I thought you would be supportive of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, but I can\u2019t help but think it would have been best if we had never met. Because then I wouldn\u2019t always be worried about you whenever you\u2019re gone saving people on the other end of the universe.\u201d You could see the hurt on Carol\u2019s face, but you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to apologize, at least not now. You knew you would hate yourself later on in the night, but all you could feel right now was the anger and frustration that you\u2019ve bottled up burning a hole in your stomach.</p><p>You knew that what you had said hurt Carol, and you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to face her. The door slammed shut behind you, and you couldn\u2019t help the sinking feeling in your gut that this time, you were truly alone. It didn\u2019t take long for Carol to follow you out into the cold, and she put her leather jacket over your shoulders so you would stop shivering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for not asking you how you felt about me going out on these missions. Being an Avenger is a very important part of my life, but none of what I do would be worth it if I don\u2019t have you. I might be the strongest Avenger, but I\u2019m only strong if I have you by my side.\u201d Carol took your hand, and she gave you a little smile when you laced your fingers together.</p><p>\u201cI just miss you so much.\u201d You mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI miss you too.\u201d Carol took this moment to hug you, and you put your head on her shoulder. It would take a lot of work to make everything feel okay, but that was part of the job description when you were in love with an Avenger.</p></p>",
