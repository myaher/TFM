Is that something one of your silly gadgets can do?\u201d He said picking screw off of Mr. Stark\u2019s desk and flicking it at him but Tony dodged the small object, the screw making a small \u201cclink\u201d as it hit the floor \u201cDidn\u2019t think so.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo not touch anything on my desk you wizard!\u201d Tony said picking up the screw and stepping in front of Strange for him to get away from his things \u201cAt least my office doesn\u2019t look like something from Harry Potter.\u201d He said as his lip curled into a smirk.</p><p>\u201cI will portal you into a fucking volcano!\u201d Strange glared at the billionaire as he pointed at him \u201cThat would be better because then that would mean I won\u2019t be here talking to you.\u201d Responded Tony as he set Stephen\u2019s hand down. But with his middle finger. </p><p>As much as Strange would have loved to actually portal Mr. Stark into a volcano, he instead took a deep breath and sighed \u201cWe really need to stop arguing about this.\u201d Stephen sighed then looked at Tony \u201cIs there some way I can&hellip;at least <i>try </i>to get along with you?\u201d </p><p>Tony pretended to think as he gazed up at the ceiling before looking back at the \u201cwizard\u201d with a slight smirk \u201cWe can get along,\u201d he started \u201c<i>IF</i> you admit science is better.\u201d </p><p>Stephen stared at Tony then rolled his eyes \u201cAre you seriously wanting to do this-?\u201d He glared then stood up straight with his arms crossed on his chest \u201cOnly if you prove it.\u201d </p><p>Tony almost stared at Stephen in disbelief. But if he wanted it to be played that way, he\u2019ll get it! The billionaire then tried to think of something that would make the \u201cwizard\u201d change his mind. He wanted Strange to admit it out loud. </p><p>Suddenly, the thought of his newest invention and grinned \u201cIn that case,\u201d Tony said \u201cI\u2019ll show you my lastet invention.\u201d He walked over to a draw in his desk and pulled out six bracelets. But these ones were metal, and had what seemed to be a green glowing dot on it.</p><p>\u201cBracelets? I thought I\u2019d get to see something better.\u201d Strange scoffed crossing his arms while rolling his eyes. But Tony only smirked \u201cI haven\u2019t explained what it does yet.\u201d He said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you test them out?\u201d </p><p>Strange looked at him \u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not trying to trick me?\u201d He glared. Mr Stark rolled his eyes \u201cIf I was going to trick you, I would have done so by now.\u201d He sighed. With no other choice, Stephen took one then put them on his wrists but Tony took the other four. Two on the \u201cwizards\u201d ankles, extending one out and putting it around his waist, but held onto the last one. </p><p>Stephen looked at Tony confused \u201cDo they do something or what?\u201d </p><p>Tony grinned \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d                            Before, Strange could respond, the glowing green dot on the bracelets turned red and the sixth bracelets attacked Stephens cloak and restraining it to the floor. The sorcerers eyes widened as he stared at the bracelets then back at Tony \u201cWhat are these things suppose to dohohohahaha-?TONY!\u201d Strange laughed out as he felt the barcelets around his neck, wrists, and ankles vibrate.                         \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, doc?\u201d Tony smirked \u201cTicklish?\u201d </p><p>\u201cF-Fuck you!\u201d Stephen laughed. The bracelets vibrated through his clothes and feeling the ones on his ankles tickle his feet and the ones on his wrists vibrating up to his armpits. Strange collapsed to his knees but soon regretted his choice once the bracelets seemed to connect themselves to the floor. He tried to get the tickle-devices off his wrists but they connected together like handcuffs.</p><p>\u201cW-WHY WOHOHOHOULD YOU MAHAHAKE SOMEHEHEHETHING LIKE THIHIHIHIS?!\u201d He laughed as his face turned red of both embarrassment and anger. The person he had been arguing for weeks about finding out one of his weaknesses? This was beyond humiliating.                                                   The billionaire shrugged \u201cI was going to have Peter try them first,\u201d he smirked \u201cBut this is more entertaining.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRELAHAHASE MEHEHE YOHOHOU AHAHAHASSHOLE AHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Tony shrugged \u201cI will,\u201d he said \u201cIf you admit Science is better than Magic.\u201d </p><p>Strange glared at him. Or, at least tried to \u201cNEHEHEVER!\u201d He giggled out \u201cThen I\u2019m not going to make them stop until you admit it.\u201d Tony sighed as he sat in the chair at his desk as he watched the \u201cwizard\u201d get tortured. </p><p>A few minutes passed and Stephen could feel tears of laughter in his eyes. Meanwhile, Tony casually sat in his chair as he read a book like nothing was happening but looked up a few times to watch the tortured doctor and smirked. As he continued to watch, he decided to join in.</p><p>Tony got up from his chair and when to the right side of Strange before both hands tickled his sides and it made Stephen laugh louder as he tried to protect his side from Mr Starks fingers \u201cLEHEHET MEHE GOHOHAHAHA!\u201d Laughed the doctor.</p><p>Tony chuckled \u201cAmit Science is better than Magic.\u201d He tickled him faster \u201cAdmit it.\u201d The billionaire wouldn\u2019t say it out loud, but he actually thought it was cute to see Stephen like this. Not helpless, just cute. His laughter was beautiful and he thought his face was adorable in this situation.</p><p>Luckily everything was secretly being recorded by FRIDAY so Tony could rewatch this.                                                  \u201cAdmit it!\u201d He said as his hands drifted up to Stephen\u2019s ribcage and he watched as a tear of laughter roll down Strange\u2019s face. </p><p>Strange couldn\u2019t take the tickling much longer. But he wasn\u2019t going to say it! He tried to think of something he could do to get out of this situation, he couldn\u2019t concentrate to use his magic and his cloak was restrained, what could he do? </p><p><i>\u2018So Tony is wanting to play it like this, huh? Then he\u2019ll get a taste of his own medicine!\u2019 </i>Thought Stephen Strange as he set an idea in his mind.</p><p>\u201cOKAY OKAY!\u201d He laughed \u201cS-SCIEHEHEINCE IS BETTEHEHEHER! JUST RELEASE MEHEHEHE!\u201d </p><p>Tony grinned, actually believing him \u201cGlad we can agree, <i>Mister</i> Strange.\u201d He said turning off the bracelets and letting him go. Strange only became more determined to get revenge on him. </p><p>As he panted for breath, he watched Mr Stark put the bracelets back. His back facing towards Stephen so he couldn\u2019t see what he was up to.</p><p>\u201cAnyways, glad I could\u2014what? Hey!\u201d Tony yelped in surprise as a red cloak attacked him and tackled him to the ground. He didn\u2019t know this cloak could be so strong. </p><p>As Stark tried to fight back and kick his legs, the cloak attacked him and tied his legs together and golden restraints appeared on his wrists before pinning them above his head. Tony squirmed to try breaking free but it was no use. He then looked to see Stephen still panting for breath and glaring down at him.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d Stephen panted \u201cAnd it\u2019s <i>Doctor</i> Strange to you.\u201d He then smirked \u201cI think you should have a taste of your own medicine.\u201d <i>Doctor</i> Strange said.  He then summoned feathers with his hands. They were pink and they looked like feathers, but did they feel like feathers?</p><p>Two gently slided up and down the billionaires side and another on his belly. Yup, they definitely felt like feathers. </p><p>Tony immediately burst into helpless chuckles as he tried to squirm away from the feathers but he couldn\u2019t get away now. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you go on one condition,\u201d Strange said sitting next to Mr Stark and watching his revenge \u201cAmit Magic is better than science.\u201d He smirked. </p><p>Tony looked at him \u201cWAIT\u2014BUT YOU SAID-!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d Stephen said \u201cNow admit it, then I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d </p><p>Tony tried to look at him angrily but laughter corrupted him. How could he have fallen for this so easily!? He should have known better, but how was he going to get out of this now?</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY! CAHAHALL\u2014!\u201d Tony laughed but his mouth was quickly covered by no one other than Stephen Strange \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Mr Stark.\u201d He said \u201cAdmit Magic is better than Science.\u201d He summoned another feather and his tickled Tony\u2019s chest </p><p>\u201cAdmit it\u2014EW! Did you just lick my hand!?\u201d Yelled a disgusted Stephen as he pulled away his hand from Tony\u2019s mouth and wiped his on his clothing.       Tony laughed. Not just from the tickling, but getting the doctor disgusted like that. </p><p>After Stephen wiped away the saliva off his hand, he blushed before looking at Tony \u201cYou\u2019re just begging for it now!\u201d Strange then summoned another two feathers and they tickled Tony\u2019s hips.      The sorcerers anger towards the billionaire then fanished and a smirk curled onto his lips \u201cIron Man ticklish?\u201d He grinned \u201cI\u2019d have to see it to believe it.\u201d </p><p>Tony just laughed loudly in response \u201cF-FUHUHUHUCK YOHOHOU!\u201d He blushed of embarrassment. He never wanted anyone to find out about his secret weakness, especially Stephen!      Stark tried to think of some way out of this but if he could manage to escape, Stephen\u2019s cloak would only catch him. Even if he had a chance to run. </p><p>A few minutes had passed and Stephen just sat next to Tony while playing with a ball he summoned to entertain himself, but still thought iron-man\u2019s torture was very entertaining as well. He decided to have some of his own fun and dug his hands into Tony Stark\u2019s armpits. </p><p>Tony laughed even harder and tears of laughter started rolling down his cheeks. </p><p>Stephen of course noticed this and grinned, but at the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but feel pity for Mr Stark. He was probably nearly breathless, but it hasn\u2019t been nearly as long as Tony tortured him. </p><p>At least Strange had pity on him, something he thought Tony didn\u2019t feel on him when he was being tickle- tortured. </p><p>After a few seconds, the tickling stopped and the feathers disappeared, at the same time the golden restraits that held Tony\u2019s wrists down.</p><p>Strange\u2019s cloak returned to him \u201cI only stopped because if I had done it worse, I\u2019d be no better than you are.\u201d He lied. Tony just rolled his eyes \u201cWhatever.\u201d He then chuckled again \u201cI still got you to say Science is better than Magic.\u201d </p><p>Stephen glared then summoned a feather \u201cI <i>will</i> continue!\u201d</p><p>Tony backed away a bit \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d He panted to breath as he sat up with Strange and looked at him. He smirked \u201cI had no idea you could be so ticklish.\u201d Tony said \u201cBy the way, I had FRIDAY record everything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou did what?!\u201d Stephen\u2019s face turned red and he covered it with his hands. Tony couldn\u2019t help but laugh \u201cD-Don\u2019t worry,\u201d he panted with a smirk \u201cI won\u2019t show anyone.\u201d </p><p>The sorcerer then looked at Tony \u201cYou do realize FRIDAY also recorded me getting revenge on you as well, right?\u201d He smirked. </p><p>Tony\u2019s smirk disappeared and he hid his face as he sighed \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that.\u201d </p><p>Now Stephen let out a chuckle. He didn\u2019t need to see the billionaire\u2019s face to know he was blushing of embarrassment \u201cAnd look who\u2019s talking, I didn\u2019t know you were so ticklish! I might do that again if you ever annoy me again.\u201d Tony glared at him \u201cI\u2019ll put those bracelets back on you while you\u2019re asleep.\u201d </p><p>Stephen just chuckled \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d </p><p>A few seconds passed and the two sat in silence.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Stephen finally said \u201cAre we going to put this argument aside?\u201d The two looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Tony said \u201cJust say Science is better again.\u201d </p><p>Stephen sighed before glaring at him but then grinned as he poked Stark\u2019s side, which made Tony chuckle and back away a bit \u201cI was joking!\u201d He giggled. </p><p>\u201cYou better be!\u201d The sorcerer giggled with him. </p><p>The two continue to chuckle until Tony let out a yawn \u201cI have to admit,\u201d he smiled \u201cAll of the tickling tired me out.\u201d He said looking at Strange sleepily. </p><p>Stephen smiled back at him \u201cI have to agree.\u201d He said, trying to not yawn. </p><p>Suddenly, Stephen felt a small pressure on his side and he looked to see that Tony Stark had quickly fallen asleep on his shoulder. He wasn\u2019t lying when Tony said the tickling made him sleepy.</p><p>The sorcerers face immediately blushed red. He didn\u2019t want to wake Tony, and he&hellip;actually liked the warmth of Tony\u2019s body against his. Stephen hesitated, but gently turned his body and held Tony tight to his chest and gently stroking his hair. </p><p>Strange smiled as he watched Stark sleep peacefully. He then placed his lips on Tony\u2019s forehead and smelling his hair. It smelled like apples. </p><p>Stephen chuckled softly and placed his head on Tony\u2019s hair. </p><p>Not long after that, his cloak wrapped itself around Tony and holding both heroes tight. </p><p>Stephen glared at the cloth \u201cReally?\u201d He rolled his eyes, but he secretly loved it. </p><p>He wanted this to last as long as possible. If only time could stop and he could let this moment last as long as possible. </p><p>But unknown to him, Tony secretly faked it. He warmth of Stephen\u2019s chest was cozy and his clothes were surprisingly really soft. But he didn\u2019t want to embarrass the \u201cwizard\u201d. </p><p>After a few minutes, Tony slowly wrapped his arms around Stephen\u2019s waist with a smile across his face. And he didn\u2019t need to look at Strange to know he was blushing as well. </p><p>That\u2019s when he heard Stephen whisper a few words while stroking his hair </p><p>\u201cI love you, Tony Stark.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s face immediately began to heat up. He wanted to smash his lips onto Stephen\u2019s so badly, but he controlled himself.  </p><p>Tony just snuggled his face into Stephen\u2019s chest before mouthing out the words.</p><p><i>\u201cI love you too, Stephen Strange&hellip;~\u201d</i></p><p><b>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</b></p><p><b>Like I said, this is my first Marvel AND IronStrange fanfic so, I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s bad \ud83d\ude13 </b></p><p><b>But, I hope you enjoyed it ^^</b></p>",

Strange only became more determined to get revenge on him. </p><p>As he panted for breath, he watched Mr Stark put the bracelets back. His back facing towards Stephen so he couldn\u2019t see what he was up to.</p><p>\u201cAnyways, glad I could\u2014what? Hey!\u201d Tony yelped in surprise as a red cloak attacked him and tackled him to the ground. He didn\u2019t know this cloak could be so strong. </p><p>As Stark tried to fight back and kick his legs, the cloak attacked him and tied his legs together and golden restraints appeared on his wrists before pinning them above his head. Tony squirmed to try breaking free but it was no use. He then looked to see Stephen still panting for breath and glaring down at him.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d Stephen panted \u201cAnd it\u2019s <i>Doctor</i> Strange to you.\u201d He then smirked \u201cI think you should have a taste of your own medicine.\u201d <i>Doctor</i> Strange said.  He then summoned feathers with his hands. They were pink and they looked like feathers, but did they feel like feathers?</p><p>Two gently slided up and down the billionaires side and another on his belly. Yup, they definitely felt like feathers. </p><p>Tony immediately burst into helpless chuckles as he tried to squirm away from the feathers but he couldn\u2019t get away now. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you go on one condition,\u201d Strange said sitting next to Mr Stark and watching his revenge \u201cAmit Magic is better than science.\u201d He smirked. </p><p>Tony looked at him \u201cWAIT\u2014BUT YOU SAID-!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d Stephen said \u201cNow admit it, then I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d </p><p>Tony tried to look at him angrily but laughter corrupted him. How could he have fallen for this so easily!? He should have known better, but how was he going to get out of this now?</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY! CAHAHALL\u2014!\u201d Tony laughed but his mouth was quickly covered by no one other than Stephen Strange \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Mr Stark.\u201d He said \u201cAdmit Magic is better than Science.\u201d He summoned another feather and his tickled Tony\u2019s chest </p><p>\u201cAdmit it\u2014EW! Did you just lick my hand!?\u201d Yelled a disgusted Stephen as he pulled away his hand from Tony\u2019s mouth and wiped his on his clothing.       Tony laughed. Not just from the tickling, but getting the doctor disgusted like that. </p><p>After Stephen wiped away the saliva off his hand, he blushed before looking at Tony \u201cYou\u2019re just begging for it now!\u201d Strange then summoned another two feathers and they tickled Tony\u2019s hips.      The sorcerers anger towards the billionaire then fanished and a smirk curled onto his lips \u201cIron Man ticklish?\u201d He grinned \u201cI\u2019d have to see it to believe it.\u201d </p><p>Tony just laughed loudly in response \u201cF-FUHUHUHUCK YOHOHOU!\u201d He blushed of embarrassment. He never wanted anyone to find out about his secret weakness, especially Stephen!      Stark tried to think of some way out of this but if he could manage to escape, Stephen\u2019s cloak would only catch him. Even if he had a chance to run. </p><p>A few minutes had passed and Stephen just sat next to Tony while playing with a ball he summoned to entertain himself, but still thought iron-man\u2019s torture was very entertaining as well. He decided to have some of his own fun and dug his hands into Tony Stark\u2019s armpits. </p><p>Tony laughed even harder and tears of laughter started rolling down his cheeks. </p><p>Stephen of course noticed this and grinned, but at the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but feel pity for Mr Stark. He was probably nearly breathless, but it hasn\u2019t been nearly as long as Tony tortured him. </p><p>At least Strange had pity on him, something he thought Tony didn\u2019t feel on him when he was being tickle- tortured. </p><p>After a few seconds, the tickling stopped and the feathers disappeared, at the same time the golden restraits that held Tony\u2019s wrists down.</p><p>Strange\u2019s cloak returned to him \u201cI only stopped because if I had done it worse, I\u2019d be no better than you are.\u201d He lied. Tony just rolled his eyes \u201cWhatever.\u201d He then chuckled again \u201cI still got you to say Science is better than Magic.\u201d </p><p>Stephen glared then summoned a feather \u201cI <i>will</i> continue!\u201d</p><p>Tony backed away a bit \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d He panted to breath as he sat up with Strange and looked at him. He smirked \u201cI had no idea you could be so ticklish.\u201d Tony said \u201cBy the way, I had FRIDAY record everything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou did what?!\u201d Stephen\u2019s face turned red and he covered it with his hands. Tony couldn\u2019t help but laugh \u201cD-Don\u2019t worry,\u201d he panted with a smirk \u201cI won\u2019t show anyone.\u201d </p><p>The sorcerer then looked at Tony \u201cYou do realize FRIDAY also recorded me getting revenge on you as well, right?\u201d He smirked. </p><p>Tony\u2019s smirk disappeared and he hid his face as he sighed \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that.\u201d </p><p>Now Stephen let out a chuckle. He didn\u2019t need to see the billionaire\u2019s face to know he was blushing of embarrassment \u201cAnd look who\u2019s talking, I didn\u2019t know you were so ticklish! I might do that again if you ever annoy me again.\u201d Tony glared at him \u201cI\u2019ll put those bracelets back on you while you\u2019re asleep.\u201d </p><p>Stephen just chuckled \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d </p><p>A few seconds passed and the two sat in silence.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Stephen finally said \u201cAre we going to put this argument aside?\u201d The two looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Tony said \u201cJust say Science is better again.\u201d </p><p>Stephen sighed before glaring at him but then grinned as he poked Stark\u2019s side, which made Tony chuckle and back away a bit \u201cI was joking!\u201d He giggled. </p><p>\u201cYou better be!\u201d The sorcerer giggled with him. </p><p>The two continue to chuckle until Tony let out a yawn \u201cI have to admit,\u201d he smiled \u201cAll of the tickling tired me out.\u201d He said looking at Strange sleepily. </p><p>Stephen smiled back at him \u201cI have to agree.\u201d He said, trying to not yawn. </p><p>Suddenly, Stephen felt a small pressure on his side and he looked to see that Tony Stark had quickly fallen asleep on his shoulder. He wasn\u2019t lying when Tony said the tickling made him sleepy.</p><p>The sorcerers face immediately blushed red. He didn\u2019t want to wake Tony, and he\u2026actually liked the warmth of Tony\u2019s body against his. Stephen hesitated, but gently turned his body and held Tony tight to his chest and gently stroking his hair. </p><p>Strange smiled as he watched Stark sleep peacefully. He then placed his lips on Tony\u2019s forehead and smelling his hair. It smelled like apples. </p><p>Stephen chuckled softly and placed his head on Tony\u2019s hair. </p><p>Not long after that, his cloak wrapped itself around Tony and holding both heroes tight. </p><p>Stephen glared at the cloth \u201cReally?\u201d He rolled his eyes, but he secretly loved it. </p><p>He wanted this to last as long as possible. If only time could stop and he could let this moment last as long as possible. </p><p>But unknown to him, Tony secretly faked it. He warmth of Stephen\u2019s chest was cozy and his clothes were surprisingly really soft. But he didn\u2019t want to embarrass the \u201cwizard\u201d. </p><p>After a few minutes, Tony slowly wrapped his arms around Stephen\u2019s waist with a smile across his face. And he didn\u2019t need to look at Strange to know he was blushing as well. </p><p>That\u2019s when he heard Stephen whisper a few words while stroking his hair </p><p>\u201cI love you, Tony Stark.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s face immediately began to heat up. He wanted to smash his lips onto Stephen\u2019s so badly, but he controlled himself.  </p><p>Tony just snuggled his face into Stephen\u2019s chest before mouthing out the words.</p><p><i>\u201cI love you too, Stephen Strange\u2026~\u201d</i></p><p><b>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</b></p><p><b>Like I said, this is my first Marvel AND IronStrange fanfic so, I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s bad \ud83d\ude13 </b></p><p><b>But, I hope you enjoyed it ^^</b></p></p>",

Science or Magic. </b></p><p><b>The two of them continue to argue but then it turns into something different for the two heroes. (This is my first IronStrange AND Marvel fanfic so forgive me if it\u2019s bad-)</b></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre we seriously going to go through this again? Science tops magic!\u201d Shouted an annoyed Tony Stark to the <i>\u2018wizard\u2019 </i>in his office, also known as Stephen Strange.</p><p>The two have been budding heads once again about which was better. The research and inventions of science, or the spells and special books of magic. The two just couldn\u2019t seem to see each other in person without the argument being brought up again. </p><p>This caused the other Avengers to try keeping the two away from each other, but due to the fact that Tony and Stephen were the only ones in the tower right now, they just made a sudden to bump into each other. </p><p>Stephen wanted to make the choice of at least <i>trying </i>to get along with the billionaire genius. But he now realized that was a mistake\u2026</p><p>Now here the two were, in Tony\u2019s office, arguing about which was better, Science or Magic.</p><p>Stephen rolled his eyes \u201cI can portal to another plantet with my magic. Is that something one of your silly gadgets can do?\u201d He said picking screw off of Mr. Stark\u2019s desk and flicking it at him but Tony dodged the small object, the screw making a small \u201cclink\u201d as it hit the floor \u201cDidn\u2019t think so.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo not touch anything on my desk you wizard!\u201d Tony said picking up the screw and stepping in front of Strange for him to get away from his things \u201cAt least my office doesn\u2019t look like something from Harry Potter.\u201d He said as his lip curled into a smirk.</p><p>\u201cI will portal you into a fucking volcano!\u201d Strange glared at the billionaire as he pointed at him \u201cThat would be better because then that would mean I won\u2019t be here talking to you.\u201d Responded Tony as he set Stephen\u2019s hand down. But with his middle finger. </p><p>As much as Strange would have loved to actually portal Mr. Stark into a volcano, he instead took a deep breath and sighed \u201cWe really need to stop arguing about this.\u201d Stephen sighed then looked at Tony \u201cIs there some way I can\u2026at least <i>try </i>to get along with you?\u201d </p><p>Tony pretended to think as he gazed up at the ceiling before looking back at the \u201cwizard\u201d with a slight smirk \u201cWe can get along,\u201d he started \u201c<i>IF</i> you admit science is better.\u201d </p><p>Stephen stared at Tony then rolled his eyes \u201cAre you seriously wanting to do this-?\u201d He glared then stood up straight with his arms crossed on his chest \u201cOnly if you prove it.\u201d </p><p>Tony almost stared at Stephen in disbelief. But if he wanted it to be played that way, he\u2019ll get it! The billionaire then tried to think of something that would make the \u201cwizard\u201d change his mind. He wanted Strange to admit it out loud. </p><p>Suddenly, the thought of his newest invention and grinned \u201cIn that case,\u201d Tony said \u201cI\u2019ll show you my lastet invention.\u201d He walked over to a draw in his desk and pulled out six bracelets. But these ones were metal, and had what seemed to be a green glowing dot on it.</p><p>\u201cBracelets? I thought I\u2019d get to see something better.\u201d Strange scoffed crossing his arms while rolling his eyes. But Tony only smirked \u201cI haven\u2019t explained what it does yet.\u201d He said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you test them out?\u201d </p><p>Strange looked at him \u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not trying to trick me?\u201d He glared. Mr Stark rolled his eyes \u201cIf I was going to trick you, I would have done so by now.\u201d He sighed. With no other choice, Stephen took one then put them on his wrists but Tony took the other four. Two on the \u201cwizards\u201d ankles, extending one out and putting it around his waist, but held onto the last one. </p><p>Stephen looked at Tony confused \u201cDo they do something or what?\u201d </p><p>Tony grinned \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d                            Before, Strange could respond, the glowing green dot on the bracelets turned red and the sixth bracelets attacked Stephens cloak and restraining it to the floor. The sorcerers eyes widened as he stared at the bracelets then back at Tony \u201cWhat are these things suppose to dohohohahaha-?TONY!\u201d Strange laughed out as he felt the barcelets around his neck, wrists, and ankles vibrate.                         \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, doc?\u201d Tony smirked \u201cTicklish?\u201d </p><p>\u201cF-Fuck you!\u201d Stephen laughed. The bracelets vibrated through his clothes and feeling the ones on his ankles tickle his feet and the ones on his wrists vibrating up to his armpits. Strange collapsed to his knees but soon regretted his choice once the bracelets seemed to connect themselves to the floor. He tried to get the tickle-devices off his wrists but they connected together like handcuffs.</p><p>\u201cW-WHY WOHOHOHOULD YOU MAHAHAKE SOMEHEHEHETHING LIKE THIHIHIHIS?!\u201d He laughed as his face turned red of both embarrassment and anger. The person he had been arguing for weeks about finding out one of his weaknesses? This was beyond humiliating.                                                   The billionaire shrugged \u201cI was going to have Peter try them first,\u201d he smirked \u201cBut this is more entertaining.\u201d </p><p>\u201cRELAHAHASE MEHEHE YOHOHOU AHAHAHASSHOLE AHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Tony shrugged \u201cI will,\u201d he said \u201cIf you admit Science is better than Magic.\u201d </p><p>Strange glared at him. Or, at least tried to \u201cNEHEHEVER!\u201d He giggled out \u201cThen I\u2019m not going to make them stop until you admit it.\u201d Tony sighed as he sat in the chair at his desk as he watched the \u201cwizard\u201d get tortured. </p><p>A few minutes passed and Stephen could feel tears of laughter in his eyes. Meanwhile, Tony casually sat in his chair as he read a book like nothing was happening but looked up a few times to watch the tortured doctor and smirked. As he continued to watch, he decided to join in.</p><p>Tony got up from his chair and when to the right side of Strange before both hands tickled his sides and it made Stephen laugh louder as he tried to protect his side from Mr Starks fingers \u201cLEHEHET MEHE GOHOHAHAHA!\u201d Laughed the doctor.</p><p>Tony chuckled \u201cAmit Science is better than Magic.\u201d He tickled him faster \u201cAdmit it.\u201d The billionaire wouldn\u2019t say it out loud, but he actually thought it was cute to see Stephen like this. Not helpless, just cute. His laughter was beautiful and he thought his face was adorable in this situation.</p><p>Luckily everything was secretly being recorded by FRIDAY so Tony could rewatch this.                                                  \u201cAdmit it!\u201d He said as his hands drifted up to Stephen\u2019s ribcage and he watched as a tear of laughter roll down Strange\u2019s face. </p><p>Strange couldn\u2019t take the tickling much longer. But he wasn\u2019t going to say it! He tried to think of something he could do to get out of this situation, he couldn\u2019t concentrate to use his magic and his cloak was restrained, what could he do? </p><p><i>\u2018So Tony is wanting to play it like this, huh? Then he\u2019ll get a taste of his own medicine!\u2019 </i>Thought Stephen Strange as he set an idea in his mind.</p><p>\u201cOKAY OKAY!\u201d He laughed \u201cS-SCIEHEHEINCE IS BETTEHEHEHER! JUST RELEASE MEHEHEHE!\u201d </p><p>Tony grinned, actually believing him \u201cGlad we can agree, <i>Mister</i> Strange.\u201d He said turning off the bracelets and letting him go. Strange only became more determined to get revenge on him. </p><p>As he panted for breath, he watched Mr Stark put the bracelets back. His back facing towards Stephen so he couldn\u2019t see what he was up to.</p><p>\u201cAnyways, glad I could\u2014what? Hey!\u201d Tony yelped in surprise as a red cloak attacked him and tackled him to the ground. He didn\u2019t know this cloak could be so strong. </p><p>As Stark tried to fight back and kick his legs, the cloak attacked him and tied his legs together and golden restraints appeared on his wrists before pinning them above his head. Tony squirmed to try breaking free but it was no use. He then looked to see Stephen still panting for breath and glaring down at him.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d Stephen panted \u201cAnd it\u2019s <i>Doctor</i> Strange to you.\u201d He then smirked \u201cI think you should have a taste of your own medicine.\u201d <i>Doctor</i> Strange said.  He then summoned feathers with his hands. They were pink and they looked like feathers, but did they feel like feathers?</p><p>Two gently slided up and down the billionaires side and another on his belly. Yup, they definitely felt like feathers. </p><p>Tony immediately burst into helpless chuckles as he tried to squirm away from the feathers but he couldn\u2019t get away now. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you go on one condition,\u201d Strange said sitting next to Mr Stark and watching his revenge \u201cAmit Magic is better than science.\u201d He smirked. </p><p>Tony looked at him \u201cWAIT\u2014BUT YOU SAID-!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d Stephen said \u201cNow admit it, then I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d </p><p>Tony tried to look at him angrily but laughter corrupted him. How could he have fallen for this so easily!? He should have known better, but how was he going to get out of this now?</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY! CAHAHALL\u2014!\u201d Tony laughed but his mouth was quickly covered by no one other than Stephen Strange \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Mr Stark.\u201d He said \u201cAdmit Magic is better than Science.\u201d He summoned another feather and his tickled Tony\u2019s chest </p><p>\u201cAdmit it\u2014EW! Did you just lick my hand!?\u201d Yelled a disgusted Stephen as he pulled away his hand from Tony\u2019s mouth and wiped his on his clothing.       Tony laughed. Not just from the tickling, but getting the doctor disgusted like that. </p><p>After Stephen wiped away the saliva off his hand, he blushed before looking at Tony \u201cYou\u2019re just begging for it now!\u201d Strange then summoned another two feathers and they tickled Tony\u2019s hips.      The sorcerers anger towards the billionaire then fanished and a smirk curled onto his lips \u201cIron Man ticklish?\u201d He grinned \u201cI\u2019d have to see it to believe it.\u201d </p><p>Tony just laughed loudly in response \u201cF-FUHUHUHUCK YOHOHOU!\u201d He blushed of embarrassment. He never wanted anyone to find out about his secret weakness, especially Stephen!      Stark tried to think of some way out of this but if he could manage to escape, Stephen\u2019s cloak would only catch him. Even if he had a chance to run. </p><p>A few minutes had passed and Stephen just sat next to Tony while playing with a ball he summoned to entertain himself, but still thought iron-man\u2019s torture was very entertaining as well. He decided to have some of his own fun and dug his hands into Tony Stark\u2019s armpits. </p><p>Tony laughed even harder and tears of laughter started rolling down his cheeks. </p><p>Stephen of course noticed this and grinned, but at the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but feel pity for Mr Stark. He was probably nearly breathless, but it hasn\u2019t been nearly as long as Tony tortured him. </p><p>At least Strange had pity on him, something he thought Tony didn\u2019t feel on him when he was being tickle- tortured. </p><p>After a few seconds, the tickling stopped and the feathers disappeared, at the same time the golden restraits that held Tony\u2019s wrists down.</p><p>Strange\u2019s cloak returned to him \u201cI only stopped because if I had done it worse, I\u2019d be no better than you are.\u201d He lied. Tony just rolled his eyes \u201cWhatever.\u201d He then chuckled again \u201cI still got you to say Science is better than Magic.\u201d </p><p>Stephen glared then summoned a feather \u201cI <i>will</i> continue!\u201d</p><p>Tony backed away a bit \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d He panted to breath as he sat up with Strange and looked at him. He smirked \u201cI had no idea you could be so ticklish.\u201d Tony said \u201cBy the way, I had FRIDAY record everything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou did what?!\u201d Stephen\u2019s face turned red and he covered it with his hands. Tony couldn\u2019t help but laugh \u201cD-Don\u2019t worry,\u201d he panted with a smirk \u201cI won\u2019t show anyone.\u201d </p><p>The sorcerer then looked at Tony \u201cYou do realize FRIDAY also recorded me getting revenge on you as well, right?\u201d He smirked. </p><p>Tony\u2019s smirk disappeared and he hid his face as he sighed \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that.\u201d </p><p>Now Stephen let out a chuckle. He didn\u2019t need to see the billionaire\u2019s face to know he was blushing of embarrassment \u201cAnd look who\u2019s talking, I didn\u2019t know you were so ticklish! I might do that again if you ever annoy me again.\u201d Tony glared at him \u201cI\u2019ll put those bracelets back on you while you\u2019re asleep.\u201d </p><p>Stephen just chuckled \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d </p><p>A few seconds passed and the two sat in silence.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Stephen finally said \u201cAre we going to put this argument aside?\u201d The two looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Tony said \u201cJust say Science is better again.\u201d </p><p>Stephen sighed before glaring at him but then grinned as he poked Stark\u2019s side, which made Tony chuckle and back away a bit \u201cI was joking!\u201d He giggled. </p><p>\u201cYou better be!\u201d The sorcerer giggled with him. </p><p>The two continue to chuckle until Tony let out a yawn \u201cI have to admit,\u201d he smiled \u201cAll of the tickling tired me out.\u201d He said looking at Strange sleepily. </p><p>Stephen smiled back at him \u201cI have to agree.\u201d He said, trying to not yawn. </p><p>Suddenly, Stephen felt a small pressure on his side and he looked to see that Tony Stark had quickly fallen asleep on his shoulder. He wasn\u2019t lying when Tony said the tickling made him sleepy.</p><p>The sorcerers face immediately blushed red. He didn\u2019t want to wake Tony, and he\u2026actually liked the warmth of Tony\u2019s body against his. Stephen hesitated, but gently turned his body and held Tony tight to his chest and gently stroking his hair. </p><p>Strange smiled as he watched Stark sleep peacefully. He then placed his lips on Tony\u2019s forehead and smelling his hair. It smelled like apples. </p><p>Stephen chuckled softly and placed his head on Tony\u2019s hair. </p><p>Not long after that, his cloak wrapped itself around Tony and holding both heroes tight. </p><p>Stephen glared at the cloth \u201cReally?\u201d He rolled his eyes, but he secretly loved it. </p><p>He wanted this to last as long as possible. If only time could stop and he could let this moment last as long as possible. </p><p>But unknown to him, Tony secretly faked it. He warmth of Stephen\u2019s chest was cozy and his clothes were surprisingly really soft. But he didn\u2019t want to embarrass the \u201cwizard\u201d. </p><p>After a few minutes, Tony slowly wrapped his arms around Stephen\u2019s waist with a smile across his face. And he didn\u2019t need to look at Strange to know he was blushing as well. </p><p>That\u2019s when he heard Stephen whisper a few words while stroking his hair </p><p>\u201cI love you, Tony Stark.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s face immediately began to heat up. He wanted to smash his lips onto Stephen\u2019s so badly, but he controlled himself.  </p><p>Tony just snuggled his face into Stephen\u2019s chest before mouthing out the words.</p><p><i>\u201cI love you too, Stephen Strange\u2026~\u201d</i></p><p><b>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</b></p><p><b>Like I said, this is my first Marvel AND IronStrange fanfic so, I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s bad \ud83d\ude13 </b></p><p><b>But, I hope you enjoyed it ^^</b></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>&ldquo;Admit it.&rdquo; (IronStrange)</h1><h2>*<i><b>FLUUUUUUFFFF*</b></i></h2><p><b>Stephen Strange and Tony Stark are budding heads again about which his better. Science or Magic. </b></p><p><b>The two of them continue to argue but then it turns into something different for the two heroes. (This is my first IronStrange AND Marvel fanfic so forgive me if it&rsquo;s bad-)</b></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Are we seriously going to go through this again? Science tops magic!&rdquo; Shouted an annoyed Tony Stark to the <i>&lsquo;wizard&rsquo; </i>in his office, also known as Stephen Strange.</p><p>The two have been budding heads once again about which was better. The research and inventions of science, or the spells and special books of magic. The two just couldn&rsquo;t seem to see each other in person without the argument being brought up again. </p><p>This caused the other Avengers to try keeping the two away from each other, but due to the fact that Tony and Stephen were the only ones in the tower right now, they just made a sudden to bump into each other. </p><p>Stephen wanted to make the choice of at least <i>trying </i>to get along with the billionaire genius. But he now realized that was a mistake&hellip;</p><p>Now here the two were, in Tony&rsquo;s office, arguing about which was better, Science or Magic.</p><p>Stephen rolled his eyes &ldquo;I can portal to another plantet with my magic. Is that something one of your silly gadgets can do?&rdquo; He said picking screw off of Mr. Stark&rsquo;s desk and flicking it at him but Tony dodged the small object, the screw making a small &ldquo;clink&rdquo; as it hit the floor &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do not touch anything on my desk you wizard!&rdquo; Tony said picking up the screw and stepping in front of Strange for him to get away from his things &ldquo;At least my office doesn&rsquo;t look like something from Harry Potter.&rdquo; He said as his lip curled into a smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;I will portal you into a fucking volcano!&rdquo; Strange glared at the billionaire as he pointed at him &ldquo;That would be better because then that would mean I won&rsquo;t be here talking to you.&rdquo; Responded Tony as he set Stephen&rsquo;s hand down. But with his middle finger. </p><p>As much as Strange would have loved to actually portal Mr. Stark into a volcano, he instead took a deep breath and sighed &ldquo;We really need to stop arguing about this.&rdquo; Stephen sighed then looked at Tony &ldquo;Is there some way I can&hellip;at least <i>try </i>to get along with you?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony pretended to think as he gazed up at the ceiling before looking back at the &ldquo;wizard&rdquo; with a slight smirk &ldquo;We can get along,&rdquo; he started &ldquo;<i>IF</i> you admit science is better.&rdquo; </p><p>Stephen stared at Tony then rolled his eyes &ldquo;Are you seriously wanting to do this-?&rdquo; He glared then stood up straight with his arms crossed on his chest &ldquo;Only if you prove it.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony almost stared at Stephen in disbelief. But if he wanted it to be played that way, he&rsquo;ll get it! The billionaire then tried to think of something that would make the &ldquo;wizard&rdquo; change his mind. He wanted Strange to admit it out loud. </p><p>Suddenly, the thought of his newest invention and grinned &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; Tony said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you my lastet invention.&rdquo; He walked over to a draw in his desk and pulled out six bracelets. But these ones were metal, and had what seemed to be a green glowing dot on it.</p><p>&ldquo;Bracelets? I thought I&rsquo;d get to see something better.&rdquo; Strange scoffed crossing his arms while rolling his eyes. But Tony only smirked &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t explained what it does yet.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you test them out?&rdquo; </p><p>Strange looked at him &ldquo;How do I know you&rsquo;re not trying to trick me?&rdquo; He glared. Mr Stark rolled his eyes &ldquo;If I was going to trick you, I would have done so by now.&rdquo; He sighed. With no other choice, Stephen took one then put them on his wrists but Tony took the other four. Two on the &ldquo;wizards&rdquo; ankles, extending one out and putting it around his waist, but held onto the last one. </p><p>Stephen looked at Tony confused &ldquo;Do they do something or what?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony grinned &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;                            Before, Strange could respond, the glowing green dot on the bracelets turned red and the sixth bracelets attacked Stephens cloak and restraining it to the floor. The sorcerers eyes widened as he stared at the bracelets then back at Tony &ldquo;What are these things suppose to dohohohahaha-?TONY!&rdquo; Strange laughed out as he felt the barcelets around his neck, wrists, and ankles vibrate.                         &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, doc?&rdquo; Tony smirked &ldquo;Ticklish?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;F-Fuck you!&rdquo; Stephen laughed. The bracelets vibrated through his clothes and feeling the ones on his ankles tickle his feet and the ones on his wrists vibrating up to his armpits. Strange collapsed to his knees but soon regretted his choice once the bracelets seemed to connect themselves to the floor. He tried to get the tickle-devices off his wrists but they connected together like handcuffs.</p><p>&ldquo;W-WHY WOHOHOHOULD YOU MAHAHAKE SOMEHEHEHETHING LIKE THIHIHIHIS?!&rdquo; He laughed as his face turned red of both embarrassment and anger. The person he had been arguing for weeks about finding out one of his weaknesses? This was beyond humiliating.                                                   The billionaire shrugged &ldquo;I was going to have Peter try them first,&rdquo; he smirked &ldquo;But this is more entertaining.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;RELAHAHASE MEHEHE YOHOHOU AHAHAHASSHOLE AHAHAHAHAHA!&rdquo; Tony shrugged &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;If you admit Science is better than Magic.&rdquo; </p><p>Strange glared at him. Or, at least tried to &ldquo;NEHEHEVER!&rdquo; He giggled out &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m not going to make them stop until you admit it.&rdquo; Tony sighed as he sat in the chair at his desk as he watched the &ldquo;wizard&rdquo; get tortured. </p><p>A few minutes passed and Stephen could feel tears of laughter in his eyes. Meanwhile, Tony casually sat in his chair as he read a book like nothing was happening but looked up a few times to watch the tortured doctor and smirked. As he continued to watch, he decided to join in.</p><p>Tony got up from his chair and when to the right side of Strange before both hands tickled his sides and it made Stephen laugh louder as he tried to protect his side from Mr Starks fingers &ldquo;LEHEHET MEHE GOHOHAHAHA!&rdquo; Laughed the doctor.</p><p>Tony chuckled &ldquo;Amit Science is better than Magic.&rdquo; He tickled him faster &ldquo;Admit it.&rdquo; The billionaire wouldn&rsquo;t say it out loud, but he actually thought it was cute to see Stephen like this. Not helpless, just cute. His laughter was beautiful and he thought his face was adorable in this situation.</p><p>Luckily everything was secretly being recorded by FRIDAY so Tony could rewatch this.                                                  &ldquo;Admit it!&rdquo; He said as his hands drifted up to Stephen&rsquo;s ribcage and he watched as a tear of laughter roll down Strange&rsquo;s face. </p><p>Strange couldn&rsquo;t take the tickling much longer. But he wasn&rsquo;t going to say it! He tried to think of something he could do to get out of this situation, he couldn&rsquo;t concentrate to use his magic and his cloak was restrained, what could he do? </p><p><i>&lsquo;So Tony is wanting to play it like this, huh? Then he&rsquo;ll get a taste of his own medicine!&rsquo; </i>Thought Stephen Strange as he set an idea in his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;OKAY OKAY!&rdquo; He laughed &ldquo;S-SCIEHEHEINCE IS BETTEHEHEHER! JUST RELEASE MEHEHEHE!&rdquo; </p><p>Tony grinned, actually believing him &ldquo;Glad we can agree, <i>Mister</i> Strange.&rdquo; He said turning off the bracelets and letting him go. Strange only became more determined to get revenge on him. </p><p>As he panted for breath, he watched Mr Stark put the bracelets back. His back facing towards Stephen so he couldn&rsquo;t see what he was up to.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyways, glad I could&mdash;what? Hey!&rdquo; Tony yelped in surprise as a red cloak attacked him and tackled him to the ground. He didn&rsquo;t know this cloak could be so strong. </p><p>As Stark tried to fight back and kick his legs, the cloak attacked him and tied his legs together and golden restraints appeared on his wrists before pinning them above his head. Tony squirmed to try breaking free but it was no use. He then looked to see Stephen still panting for breath and glaring down at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have done that,&rdquo; Stephen panted &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s <i>Doctor</i> Strange to you.&rdquo; He then smirked &ldquo;I think you should have a taste of your own medicine.&rdquo; <i>Doctor</i> Strange said.  He then summoned feathers with his hands. They were pink and they looked like feathers, but did they feel like feathers?</p><p>Two gently slided up and down the billionaires side and another on his belly. Yup, they definitely felt like feathers. </p><p>Tony immediately burst into helpless chuckles as he tried to squirm away from the feathers but he couldn&rsquo;t get away now. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you go on one condition,&rdquo; Strange said sitting next to Mr Stark and watching his revenge &ldquo;Amit Magic is better than science.&rdquo; He smirked. </p><p>Tony looked at him &ldquo;WAIT&mdash;BUT YOU SAID-!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I lied.&rdquo; Stephen said &ldquo;Now admit it, then I&rsquo;ll let you go.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony tried to look at him angrily but laughter corrupted him. How could he have fallen for this so easily!? He should have known better, but how was he going to get out of this now?</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY! CAHAHALL&mdash;!&rdquo; Tony laughed but his mouth was quickly covered by no one other than Stephen Strange &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Mr Stark.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Admit Magic is better than Science.&rdquo; He summoned another feather and his tickled Tony&rsquo;s chest </p><p>&ldquo;Admit it&mdash;EW! Did you just lick my hand!?&rdquo; Yelled a disgusted Stephen as he pulled away his hand from Tony&rsquo;s mouth and wiped his on his clothing.       Tony laughed. Not just from the tickling, but getting the doctor disgusted like that. </p><p>After Stephen wiped away the saliva off his hand, he blushed before looking at Tony &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just begging for it now!&rdquo; Strange then summoned another two feathers and they tickled Tony&rsquo;s hips.      The sorcerers anger towards the billionaire then fanished and a smirk curled onto his lips &ldquo;Iron Man ticklish?&rdquo; He grinned &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to see it to believe it.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony just laughed loudly in response &ldquo;F-FUHUHUHUCK YOHOHOU!&rdquo; He blushed of embarrassment. He never wanted anyone to find out about his secret weakness, especially Stephen!      Stark tried to think of some way out of this but if he could manage to escape, Stephen&rsquo;s cloak would only catch him. Even if he had a chance to run. </p><p>A few minutes had passed and Stephen just sat next to Tony while playing with a ball he summoned to entertain himself, but still thought iron-man&rsquo;s torture was very entertaining as well. He decided to have some of his own fun and dug his hands into Tony Stark&rsquo;s armpits. </p><p>Tony laughed even harder and tears of laughter started rolling down his cheeks. </p><p>Stephen of course noticed this and grinned, but at the same time, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel pity for Mr Stark. He was probably nearly breathless, but it hasn&rsquo;t been nearly as long as Tony tortured him. </p><p>At least Strange had pity on him, something he thought Tony didn&rsquo;t feel on him when he was being tickle- tortured. </p><p>After a few seconds, the tickling stopped and the feathers disappeared, at the same time the golden restraits that held Tony&rsquo;s wrists down.</p><p>Strange&rsquo;s cloak returned to him &ldquo;I only stopped because if I had done it worse, I&rsquo;d be no better than you are.&rdquo; He lied. Tony just rolled his eyes &ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; He then chuckled again &ldquo;I still got you to say Science is better than Magic.&rdquo; </p><p>Stephen glared then summoned a feather &ldquo;I <i>will</i> continue!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony backed away a bit &ldquo;Okay, okay.&rdquo; He panted to breath as he sat up with Strange and looked at him. He smirked &ldquo;I had no idea you could be so ticklish.&rdquo; Tony said &ldquo;By the way, I had FRIDAY record everything.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You did what?!&rdquo; Stephen&rsquo;s face turned red and he covered it with his hands. Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh &ldquo;D-Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he panted with a smirk &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t show anyone.&rdquo; </p><p>The sorcerer then looked at Tony &ldquo;You do realize FRIDAY also recorded me getting revenge on you as well, right?&rdquo; He smirked. </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s smirk disappeared and he hid his face as he sighed &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think about that.&rdquo; </p><p>Now Stephen let out a chuckle. He didn&rsquo;t need to see the billionaire&rsquo;s face to know he was blushing of embarrassment &ldquo;And look who&rsquo;s talking, I didn&rsquo;t know you were so ticklish! I might do that again if you ever annoy me again.&rdquo; Tony glared at him &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put those bracelets back on you while you&rsquo;re asleep.&rdquo; </p><p>Stephen just chuckled &ldquo;Okay, okay.&rdquo; </p><p>A few seconds passed and the two sat in silence.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Stephen finally said &ldquo;Are we going to put this argument aside?&rdquo; The two looked at each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Tony said &ldquo;Just say Science is better again.&rdquo; </p><p>Stephen sighed before glaring at him but then grinned as he poked Stark&rsquo;s side, which made Tony chuckle and back away a bit &ldquo;I was joking!&rdquo; He giggled. </p><p>&ldquo;You better be!&rdquo; The sorcerer giggled with him. </p><p>The two continue to chuckle until Tony let out a yawn &ldquo;I have to admit,&rdquo; he smiled &ldquo;All of the tickling tired me out.&rdquo; He said looking at Strange sleepily. </p><p>Stephen smiled back at him &ldquo;I have to agree.&rdquo; He said, trying to not yawn. </p><p>Suddenly, Stephen felt a small pressure on his side and he looked to see that Tony Stark had quickly fallen asleep on his shoulder. He wasn&rsquo;t lying when Tony said the tickling made him sleepy.</p><p>The sorcerers face immediately blushed red. He didn&rsquo;t want to wake Tony, and he&hellip;actually liked the warmth of Tony&rsquo;s body against his. Stephen hesitated, but gently turned his body and held Tony tight to his chest and gently stroking his hair. </p><p>Strange smiled as he watched Stark sleep peacefully. He then placed his lips on Tony&rsquo;s forehead and smelling his hair. It smelled like apples. </p><p>Stephen chuckled softly and placed his head on Tony&rsquo;s hair. </p><p>Not long after that, his cloak wrapped itself around Tony and holding both heroes tight. </p><p>Stephen glared at the cloth &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; He rolled his eyes, but he secretly loved it. </p><p>He wanted this to last as long as possible.

But he didn&rsquo;t want to embarrass the &ldquo;wizard&rdquo;. </p><p>After a few minutes, Tony slowly wrapped his arms around Stephen&rsquo;s waist with a smile across his face. And he didn&rsquo;t need to look at Strange to know he was blushing as well. </p><p>That&rsquo;s when he heard Stephen whisper a few words while stroking his hair </p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Tony Stark.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s face immediately began to heat up. He wanted to smash his lips onto Stephen&rsquo;s so badly, but he controlled himself.  </p><p>Tony just snuggled his face into Stephen&rsquo;s chest before mouthing out the words.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I love you too, Stephen Strange&hellip;~&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</b></p><p><b>Like I said, this is my first Marvel AND IronStrange fanfic so, I&rsquo;m sorry if it&rsquo;s bad &#128531; </b></p><p><b>But, I hope you enjoyed it ^^</b></p></p>",
