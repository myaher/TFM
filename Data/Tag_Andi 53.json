We know in 3x15 that there\u2019s a Tyrus and Kira C plot involving basketball at the park but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s largely walled off from the A and B plots in that ep. It seems that the main kids have scenes at the Spoon and at least some of them bike to another location where there was a sign for a cultural festival but whose culture is unknown. There\u2019s also a middle aged woman named Vivian in this ep but who knows who she\u2019s there for, maybe Celia since she\u2019s also in this ep?\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s an officer Penn in 3x15 that we\u2019ve known about for a while and we have no idea what he\u2019s there for. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be involved with TJ at all, given that TJ was supposed to disappear until 3x19, I don\u2019t think they want us thinking too much about what he\u2019s up to after this ep. That they\u2019re using a white man for a cop makes me hope he\u2019s not involved in a Buffy story line and since we know that Buffy gets a fair bit of plot in 3x14 it would be odd to give her another big plot. It would also be odd to involve just Cyrus with the cops again.</p><p>One possibly significant thing about 3x15 is that it was one of the two of the original eight eps left that Amber wasn\u2019t in. In theory that frees up time in both Jonah and Andi\u2019s story lines. Maybe this is this ep where Mrs. Beck appears? 3x15 is a good a guess as any for when she appears and for when the show begins turning back to romantic Jandi. We\u2019re obviously not getting another gun plot but what exactly are the limits? Do all of the main kids get in trouble for something? Does Jonah get accused, rightly or wrongly, of shoplifting and that leads into further exploration of his family\u2019s situation? Or does somebody commit an act of vandalism? Does someone try to run away? We really have little to work with unfortunately.\u00a0</p><p>All we know about 3x16 is that they filmed scenes at the school, the main kids spend some time go-karting, Amber is in this ep, and they seemed to do a bit of filming on some grassy area strewn with prop garbage. There\u2019s a teenage girl named Kristina in this ep and a Mrs. Frankel who is probably a teacher. Maybe she\u2019s an art teacher who inspires Andi to make an art piece which we know gets displayed in what was 3x17, or maybe she inspires Cyrus with his screenplay. Go karting sounds fun and is interesting with what we know of Jonah\u2019s financial situation. Is the prop garbage what Andi uses to make her art piece, or is it for some volunteer thing, or the most cracked option, part of someones community service for whatever went down with the cop in 3x15? And we have no clue what Amber is being used for.\u00a0</p><p>Eps 15 and 16 are probably the last eps where the show really has the time left to focus on any really serious topics or introduce new things. From what we know of the original 3x17-3x21 eps it seems like the show starts turning to wrapping everything up from 3x17 onwards. Of course, the cut ep scrambles things somewhat and I wonder how many plots get shuffled around.</p>",

Just then Amber came back with the water. &ldquo;Here Jonah&hellip; this will help.&rdquo; Amber said as she gave me the cup. After a while my panic attack was over. &ldquo;Thanks guys but now we missed most of the movie.&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Actually we haven&rsquo;t&hellip; We just missed the preview&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Amber said. &ldquo;Oh good! I gotta get back to my date.&rdquo; Cyrus said as he walked over to Tj. &ldquo;So.. you&rsquo;re Lola.&rdquo; Amber said. &ldquo;Yep that&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; Lola replied. &ldquo;I just remembered I have to work at the spoon in a few minutes.&rdquo; Amber said. &ldquo;Lola can you sit with Jonah?&rdquo; Amber asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually here with..&rdquo; but before Lola could finish Amber had left. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok you don&rsquo;t have to sit with me.&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Who said I didn&rsquo;t want you to sit with me?&rdquo; Lola asked. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; I asked back. &ldquo;Really.. besides&hellip; I think my mom wants to know the friend who is taking me to Morp.&rdquo; Lola said. The word Friend wounded me&hellip; I never knew that just being called a friend could hurt. &ldquo;Yeah Friend.&rdquo; I said under my breath.</p></p>",
