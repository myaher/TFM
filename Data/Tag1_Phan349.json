The first text was a paragraph composed of all the swear words in the English language and possibly some from other languages too. The second text was James apologizing and then saying his goodbye.</p><p>Although James seemed calm in the second text, the first text implied that Dan should start sleeping with one eye open. The realization that he was no longer in a relationship only hit Dan a few days after. Dan avoided James and anybody who was associated with his ex-boyfriend. Not many people noticed Dan\u2019s distance from James as Dan didn\u2019t spend much time talking to people. Most of the time, he hid in the bathroom and the only time Dan spent socializing was during rehearsals. Without James\u2019 restrictions, Dan often timed Phil\u2019s laps when he wasn\u2019t at drama practice.</p><p>When Phil found out that Dan was cutting class, classes, he made Dan promise to try to stay in class for the rest of the week. Dan reluctantly agreed and the next day, Phil showed up during 2nd period right before he had to change for Physical Education. He pretended to be an office aid and the P.E. teacher allowed Phil to take Dan to \u201ctalk with the counselor\u201d. Instead of leading him to the office, Phil forced Dan into his car and drove him to a mystery location.</p><p>Along the way, Phil allowed Dan to blast his \u201cemo music\u201d. The music was playing so loud, Dan could feel the bass rattling his bones. The mystery location turned out to be a local lake. Dan was confused as to why Phil would bring him to here and his face burned red when Phil began taking off his clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Dan hissed, embarrassed that he was watching Phil strip and that he was actually enjoying it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking off my clothes so I can swim. You should too, that\u2019s why I brought you here,\u201d Phil casually answered, tossing off his t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou brought me here to\u2026 watch me strip?\u201d Dan\u2019s face was about melt off due to the amount of heat rising up his body. He tried to avert his eyes away from Phil\u2019s lower body, his raging hormones preventing him from doing him so.</p><p>\u201cNo, I brought you here to teach you how to swim. I\u2019m not taking off my underwear, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Phil laughed when he saw Dan\u2019s skin invent a new shade of red. Dan avoided eye contact as he quickly and awkwardly stripped down to his underwear. The lake was freezing but Phil immediately waded deep into the lake until the water level reached his ribcage. Dan joined Phil after he adjusted the coolness of the water.</p><p>Phil demonstrated how to do the basic stroke that was nicknamed the \u201cfreestyle\u201d. Dan attempted to imitate the rhythm that Phil had shown and while his swimming started off at an uneven pace, Phil helped him stay steady. When Dan got the hang of it, they began playfully racing against each other. Of course, Phil won every time but with each round, Dan progressively grew better at swimming.</p><p><i>Lips meet teeth and tongue. My heart skips eight beats at once</i></p><p>The pair left the lake to get lunch, drying off so they could change back into their clothes. Dan was certain that if somebody spotted them, they would\u2019ve assumed Dan and Phil were doing something other than swimming. They ate at Denny\u2019s because pancakes were a perfectly acceptable choice for lunch.</p><p>With Phil, Dan felt like he was walking on clouds and waltzing with stars. During those hours, Dan was safe and happy, feelings he forgot about long ago. The waiter at Denny\u2019s was eyeing them suspiciously as they shared a milkshake and giggled as they finished their pancakes. He probably wondered why they weren\u2019t at school and was considering whether to force them to go back or not. They left before the waiter could confront them and headed to the movies to watch the new Star Wars movie since they were both giant nerds. Not many people were at the theater so they were free to entertain themselves by throwing popcorn, or attempting to, into each other\u2019s mouths.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t want Phil to leave him but he had a swim meet and Dan had to go to rehearsals. The following day was when the full force of the breakup barreled into Dan\u2019s brain. He was walking to lunch with Phil, who he ran into after his 4th period class, and was met with the sight of James holding hands with Kaden and smiling as if nothing was wrong.</p><p><i>If we were meant to be we would\u2019ve been right now. See what you want to see but all I see is him right now</i></p><p>Phil comforted Dan as he sobbed, sitting on the cold stone stairs outside of the school. He knew that people would wonder why James was with Kaden and news of the break up would spread across the school. Fellow students would question him, asking why they broke up or who initiated the breakup. The split would soon be old news when some other drama occurred later on in the week.</p><p>Sure enough, by the next day, the entire school was buzzing about Dan and James\u2019 separation. Phil stuck by Dan\u2019s side the entire day, glaring at anybody who dared to even look in his direction. The teacher bought the excuse that Phil was at Dan\u2019s side because of \u201cmedical reasons\u201d because teachers were clueless in that way.</p><p>Phil took Dan to Denny\u2019s for lunch almost every day who texted him about James. Kaden had the nerve to text Dan that he hoped Dan was doing okay with all the gossip about him and didn\u2019t mention that he took Dan\u2019s place in James\u2019 heart. Kaden was one of those guys who seem nice to everybody but was secretly Satan. No wonder James seemed to love him so much more; people often fall in love with one of their own kind.</p><p><i>I\u2019ll sit and watch your car burn with the fire that you started in me but you never came back to ask it out</i></p><p>Surprisingly, all the James talk died down the day after the word was spread due to rumors about Amanda cheating on Connor with Jacob. People were arguing about whether the photo evidence of Amanda kissing Jacob was photoshopped or genuine and frankly, Dan couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>Dan hated eating lunch in the cafeteria because wherever he sat, he could clearly see James making out with Kaden. While he was hellfire furious, Dan was also M&amp;M green jealous. Dan\u2019s kiss with James was his first kiss ever with a guy. They hadn\u2019t made out or anything more than a few kisses on the cheek and the mouth. It was strange to see your old boyfriend kissing somebody other than you and not calling it cheating.</p><p><i>Your love feels so fake and my demands aren\u2019t high to make. If I could go to sleep, I would\u2019ve slept by now. Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow \u2018em out</i></p><p>Dan knew it was an unlikely possibility Phil would answer his call at 2 in the morning but Dan had nobody else to turn to.</p><p>\u201cHey Dan, what\u2019s up?\u201d Phil sounded extremely exhausted but Dan had never been so glad to hear somebody\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cOh thank god you\u2019re awake. Sorry if I woke you up. I\u2019m just having trouble sleeping because my annoying brain loves thinking about James,\u201d Dan forced a laugh, trying to find humor in his pain to make himself seem less devastated.</p><p>\u201cAw Dan, why do you waste time thinking about that jerk?\u201d Phil yawned and Dan smiled, imagining how he was probably adjusting his glasses and straightening his hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I called you. Talking to people usually distracts me from my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can use a lot more than just my voice to distract you but sadly I\u2019m physically nowhere near you so I guess I\u2019ll just have to use my voice,\u201d Phil deepened his voice and Dan was glad his friend couldn\u2019t see his face flushing bright pink.</p><p>\u201cPhil, stop!\u201d Dan complained through humiliation as Phil began making moaning noises. For the rest of the night, they talked about anything and everything. They discussed shallow topics such as video games but also confessed dark secrets. They talked about how they discovered their sexualities and recalled past lovers as well as their favorite breed of dogs and their favorite bands.</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t exhausted the next morning for some strange reason. Despite the many cups of coffee he consumed, Dan felt more energetic than most days. He saw James and Kaden at lunch but he didn\u2019t feel as sad as he used to because Dan was finally falling for somebody else.</p><p><i>Go ahead and watch my heart burn with the fire that you started in me, but I\u2019ll never let you back to put it out</i></p><p><i>{chapter 7 is <a href=\"https://luckysam78.tumblr.com/post/176057942961/dont-smile-at-me\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>}</i></p>",

The first text was a paragraph composed of all the swear words in the English language and possibly some from other languages too. The second text was James apologizing and then saying his goodbye.</p><p>Although James seemed calm in the second text, the first text implied that Dan should start sleeping with one eye open. The realization that he was no longer in a relationship only hit Dan a few days after. Dan avoided James and anybody who was associated with his ex-boyfriend. Not many people noticed Dan\u2019s distance from James as Dan didn\u2019t spend much time talking to people. Most of the time, he hid in the bathroom and the only time Dan spent socializing was during rehearsals. Without James\u2019 restrictions, Dan often timed Phil\u2019s laps when he wasn\u2019t at drama practice.</p><p>When Phil found out that Dan was cutting class, classes, he made Dan promise to try to stay in class for the rest of the week. Dan reluctantly agreed and the next day, Phil showed up during 2nd period right before he had to change for Physical Education. He pretended to be an office aid and the P.E. teacher allowed Phil to take Dan to \u201ctalk with the counselor\u201d. Instead of leading him to the office, Phil forced Dan into his car and drove him to a mystery location.</p><p>Along the way, Phil allowed Dan to blast his \u201cemo music\u201d. The music was playing so loud, Dan could feel the bass rattling his bones. The mystery location turned out to be a local lake. Dan was confused as to why Phil would bring him to here and his face burned red when Phil began taking off his clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Dan hissed, embarrassed that he was watching Phil strip and that he was actually enjoying it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking off my clothes so I can swim. You should too, that\u2019s why I brought you here,\u201d Phil casually answered, tossing off his t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou brought me here to\u2026 watch me strip?\u201d Dan\u2019s face was about melt off due to the amount of heat rising up his body. He tried to avert his eyes away from Phil\u2019s lower body, his raging hormones preventing him from doing him so.</p><p>\u201cNo, I brought you here to teach you how to swim. I\u2019m not taking off my underwear, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Phil laughed when he saw Dan\u2019s skin invent a new shade of red. Dan avoided eye contact as he quickly and awkwardly stripped down to his underwear. The lake was freezing but Phil immediately waded deep into the lake until the water level reached his ribcage. Dan joined Phil after he adjusted the coolness of the water.</p><p>Phil demonstrated how to do the basic stroke that was nicknamed the \u201cfreestyle\u201d. Dan attempted to imitate the rhythm that Phil had shown and while his swimming started off at an uneven pace, Phil helped him stay steady. When Dan got the hang of it, they began playfully racing against each other. Of course, Phil won every time but with each round, Dan progressively grew better at swimming.</p><p><i>Lips meet teeth and tongue. My heart skips eight beats at once</i></p><p>The pair left the lake to get lunch, drying off so they could change back into their clothes. Dan was certain that if somebody spotted them, they would\u2019ve assumed Dan and Phil were doing something other than swimming. They ate at Denny\u2019s because pancakes were a perfectly acceptable choice for lunch.</p><p>With Phil, Dan felt like he was walking on clouds and waltzing with stars. During those hours, Dan was safe and happy, feelings he forgot about long ago. The waiter at Denny\u2019s was eyeing them suspiciously as they shared a milkshake and giggled as they finished their pancakes. He probably wondered why they weren\u2019t at school and was considering whether to force them to go back or not. They left before the waiter could confront them and headed to the movies to watch the new Star Wars movie since they were both giant nerds. Not many people were at the theater so they were free to entertain themselves by throwing popcorn, or attempting to, into each other\u2019s mouths.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t want Phil to leave him but he had a swim meet and Dan had to go to rehearsals. The following day was when the full force of the breakup barreled into Dan\u2019s brain. He was walking to lunch with Phil, who he ran into after his 4th period class, and was met with the sight of James holding hands with Kaden and smiling as if nothing was wrong.</p><p><i>If we were meant to be we would\u2019ve been right now. See what you want to see but all I see is him right now</i></p><p>Phil comforted Dan as he sobbed, sitting on the cold stone stairs outside of the school. He knew that people would wonder why James was with Kaden and news of the break up would spread across the school. Fellow students would question him, asking why they broke up or who initiated the breakup. The split would soon be old news when some other drama occurred later on in the week.</p><p>Sure enough, by the next day, the entire school was buzzing about Dan and James\u2019 separation. Phil stuck by Dan\u2019s side the entire day, glaring at anybody who dared to even look in his direction. The teacher bought the excuse that Phil was at Dan\u2019s side because of \u201cmedical reasons\u201d because teachers were clueless in that way.</p><p>Phil took Dan to Denny\u2019s for lunch almost every day who texted him about James. Kaden had the nerve to text Dan that he hoped Dan was doing okay with all the gossip about him and didn\u2019t mention that he took Dan\u2019s place in James\u2019 heart. Kaden was one of those guys who seem nice to everybody but was secretly Satan. No wonder James seemed to love him so much more; people often fall in love with one of their own kind.</p><p><i>I\u2019ll sit and watch your car burn with the fire that you started in me but you never came back to ask it out</i></p><p>Surprisingly, all the James talk died down the day after the word was spread due to rumors about Amanda cheating on Connor with Jacob. People were arguing about whether the photo evidence of Amanda kissing Jacob was photoshopped or genuine and frankly, Dan couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>Dan hated eating lunch in the cafeteria because wherever he sat, he could clearly see James making out with Kaden. While he was hellfire furious, Dan was also M&amp;M green jealous. Dan\u2019s kiss with James was his first kiss ever with a guy. They hadn\u2019t made out or anything more than a few kisses on the cheek and the mouth. It was strange to see your old boyfriend kissing somebody other than you and not calling it cheating.</p><p><i>Your love feels so fake and my demands aren\u2019t high to make. If I could go to sleep, I would\u2019ve slept by now. Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow \u2018em out</i></p><p>Dan knew it was an unlikely possibility Phil would answer his call at 2 in the morning but Dan had nobody else to turn to.</p><p>\u201cHey Dan, what\u2019s up?\u201d Phil sounded extremely exhausted but Dan had never been so glad to hear somebody\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cOh thank god you\u2019re awake. Sorry if I woke you up. I\u2019m just having trouble sleeping because my annoying brain loves thinking about James,\u201d Dan forced a laugh, trying to find humor in his pain to make himself seem less devastated.</p><p>\u201cAw Dan, why do you waste time thinking about that jerk?\u201d Phil yawned and Dan smiled, imagining how he was probably adjusting his glasses and straightening his hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I called you. Talking to people usually distracts me from my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can use a lot more than just my voice to distract you but sadly I\u2019m physically nowhere near you so I guess I\u2019ll just have to use my voice,\u201d Phil deepened his voice and Dan was glad his friend couldn\u2019t see his face flushing bright pink.</p><p>\u201cPhil, stop!\u201d Dan complained through humiliation as Phil began making moaning noises. For the rest of the night, they talked about anything and everything. They discussed shallow topics such as video games but also confessed dark secrets. They talked about how they discovered their sexualities and recalled past lovers as well as their favorite breed of dogs and their favorite bands.</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t exhausted the next morning for some strange reason. Despite the many cups of coffee he consumed, Dan felt more energetic than most days. He saw James and Kaden at lunch but he didn\u2019t feel as sad as he used to because Dan was finally falling for somebody else.</p><p><i>Go ahead and watch my heart burn with the fire that you started in me, but I\u2019ll never let you back to put it out</i></p><p><i>{chapter 7 is <a href=\"https://luckysam78.tumblr.com/post/176057942961/dont-smile-at-me\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>}</i></p>",
