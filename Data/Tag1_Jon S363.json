Gilly\u2019s concoction had indeed worked well. The lice on the comb were motionless, perhaps even dead. </p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m quite proud of myself. When I was a child I would have left the hall screaming, and who would have stitched you up, then?\u201d she asked.\u00a0</p><p>Jon chuckled. \u201cYes, I remember you insisted that you couldn\u2019t have any, when we were children. It was one of the few times, I heard Lady Catelyn shout at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made Robb hold me, until she had found a nit and provided me with proof. I was mortified,\u201d she remembered. \u201cArya teased me for weeks, tickling my neck with anything that came in handy.\u201d</p><p>Sansa took a feather from her table and tickled Jon at the back of his neck. \u201cSomething is crawling there, Sansa, I think you got them again.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed.</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d Jon said. \u201cYou might be right, and I got them from the children, but we\u2019ve been away for weeks. I think we should check everyone.\u201d</p><p>Sansa sighed. \u201cGilly would agree. She says, lice are not that harmless, that they transport illnesses\u2026. But there is no way, I let the King in the North run around with lice any longer than necessary. First, I look after me and my family to get rid of these nasty visitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Gilly treat you?\u201d, Jon asked. He almost sounded as if he regretted that. \u201cIs that why you have your hair in a knot?\u201d</p><p>Sansa hummed her agreement and worked the comb through another of Jon\u2019s hair strands. Even with Gilly\u2019s oily concoction, Jon\u2019s locks were a nightmare to comb. </p><p>\u201cI like the knot. You have a lovely neck.\u201d Jon said. </p><p>Sansa felt a blush creeping into her cheeks and before she caught it, a sigh had escaped her lips.<i> Careful.</i> <i>Best not answer that.</i> Jon\u2019s remark made her painfully aware, that they were alone, which they hadn\u2019t been for weeks. Looking at Jon\u2019 neck, she saw that a flush had crept to his face as well. When he inhaled, his breath sounded loudly in her ears. <i>I wonder when we will kiss\u2026. And more\u2026</i> She was sure that they both were fighting a losing battle, and she knew that it was very dangerous to be alone with Jon. She dreaded the moment, they would give in to the temptation. And she looked forward to it.</p><p>While Sansa was busy meticulously searching for the nasty buggers, they discussed the incident with the messengers. Sansa confided to Jon that she would have preferred if Cersei had held on longer. She was not as sure as Jon that the assassination attempt would buy them time with the Targaryen queen, but they agreed that Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons were probably a task for spring.</p><p>Sansa concentrated again on the task of combing and controlling the comb for lice. So far she had only found dead lice. <i>Gilly really is a genius.</i> Jon did his best to hold still, even though an occasional grunt told her, that although she was careful, she could not prevent from pulling Jon\u2019s hair occasionally. After all when she found nits, she picked at them with her nails and tore them from his hair.</p><p>\u201cGilly says, we have to do this every day for a week.\u201d </p><p>Jon made a sound that was difficult to interpret. Then he gave a very elaborate sigh, that to Sansa\u2019s ears sounded fake.</p><p>Sansa wondered, if he liked his hair being touched. She indulged herself and smoothed Jon\u2019s hair and tried to salvage the moment. Jon\u2019s closeness, the excuse to touch him. As much as she detested lice, moments like this were so rare. </p><p>The door banged open and Alys Karstark banged in, followed by Podrick.</p><p>Sansa was angry.</p><p>\u201cI told you we are not be disturbed.\u201d She scolded Podrick.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to apologize\u201d, Podrick said.</p><p>Sansa felt a flash of annoyance at the interruption and tried to get rid of Podrick and Alys as fast as possible. Even though she still felt strongly about Alys\u2019 rejection, she accepted the apology, but sent them away again. When they were gone, she bit her lip. <i>So much for trying to keep the lice a secret.</i> But the damage was done. The sudden appearance of Podrick had reminded her how difficult it was to be with Jon alone. Her heart sank and her mood deteriorated. </p><p>\u201cI think she is jealous,\u201d Jon mused.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sansa asked. </p><p>\u201cShe is so full of anger, insecure despite her skills with a sword. I think she would like to be like you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa scoffed and her irritation let the words tumble out of her mouth. \u201cI doubt that. I think the girl is in love with you.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and would have taken the words back, if she could. <i>Dangerous, far too dangerous, Sansa. What do you expect Jon will make of that.</i></p><p>Jon laughed, but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>There was a pause, and Sansa resumed her work on his hair. <i>I will not ask.</i></p><p>\u201cEverytime I see her, I see her staring at you.\u201d Jon said after a while. \u201cI would say she is jealous of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never caught her staring at me,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cHer eyes follow you.\u201d</p><p>She stopped for a moment and thought. \u201cBut I admit she doesn\u2019t look smitten, not really, just forelorn.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe she just wants to belong somewhere?\u201d Jon wondered loudly. \u201cI mean, there must be reason why the Gods told us to treat her like our sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, why did she reject the honour to be in our guard then?\u201d Sansa asked him.</p><p>Jon turned and looked at her. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still angry.\u201d, he said.</p><p>Sansa let her hands drop. \u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt takes me hours to make one of these doublets.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled, and she playfully hit him with the comb. </p><p>He turned again and spoke into the thin air in front of his face. \u201cI love your needlework,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to know how long it took me to make this shawl, I\u2019m not going to tell you, or only if you tell me, how a piece of ragged cloth stitched for practice became a lucky charm I made with magic.\u201d</p><p>Sansa could see that blood rushed to Jon\u2019s head. The part of his neck, she could see was redder than before.</p><p>\u201cRemember when I was so angry with you just after you killed Littlefinger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. You left Winterfell for months and didn\u2019t even say goodbye,\u201d Sansa said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jon reached behind his back and took her hand to give an all too short squeeze. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say goodbye, but I wanted to have something with me as a remembrance. I took this from your sewing basket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it was a practice piece. How did this become a lucky charm?\u201d she asked.</p><p>It was perhaps good that Jon was not looking at her. Even so, his words came with pauses.</p><p>\u201cPodrick is to blame. We were on a dangerous mission against some of the Ironborn after all and he\u2026\u201c Jon hesitated. \u201cOne morning he caught me looking at the cloth, when I was thinking about how I had left you and that you were pregnant. I thought I might die without ever reconciling with you \u2026 I didn\u2019t know what else to tell him.\u201d</p><p>Sansa had stopped. Her hand was hovering over Jon\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I married him to save you, to save us.\u201d <i>I should stop. I should change the subject. This is too dangerous. </i>But that was only a part of Sansa. Another part or her wanted very much to know. <i>Did you love me, even then? Do you love me?</i> She bit her lip.</p><p>She could clearly hear Jon\u2019s breath.</p><p>\u201cI know. Still, I was so angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you angry still?\u201d, Sansa asked. Her voice sounded flat in her own ears.</p><p>Jon shook his head. </p><p>\u201cIf Littlefinger was alive and would stand before me I\u2019d still kill him with my own hands, even if it would have meant losing the Knights of the Vale. But to wish for that, would also mean that we wouldn\u2019t have Eddard and Rickon. I can\u2019t even try to imagine that.\u201d</p><p>Sansa resumed her work on Jon\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cNeither can I,\u201d she admitted. She chuckled softly. \u201cSometimes I think, life should be less complicated.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded. \u201cAnd yet sometimes I think it is very easy. I just have to keep you safe, you and the children, and that is all there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, that is enough.\u201d Sansa said. She did not dare to say more. They were treading on thin ice as it were.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long did you work on that wonderful new lucky charm.\u201d, Jon asked</p><p>Sansa wondered, if Jon knew she had used her own hair for Ghost\u2019s red eyes and the weirwood leaves. She had seen him fingering the red threads.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I couldn\u2019t say,\u201d she answered. \u201cI made it while you were at the wall, and since I worked on it for many hours, I couldn\u2019t keep it a secret from the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you make the red leaves? They shine like burnished copper.\u201d Jon asked. \u00a0Sansa licked her lips. <i>If I tell him, what will he say?</i></p><p>But they were interrupted again, when the door banged open and Podrick barged in, again.</p><p>Sansa scowled at him. \u201cPodrick\u201d, she shouted. \u201cWhat by the Gods is wrong with you today?\u201d</p><p>Podrick panted heavily. \u201cYour grace, there is a brawl in the hall. Olyvar and Alys are at each other\u2019s throats and I can\u2019t stop them. Others are joining the brawl, it is a mess.\u201d</p><p>Jon jumped up and Sansa barely managed to snatch the cloth from his shoulders. He should look dignified, even separating fighing idiots. Jon ran with Podrick and Sansa followed hastily. She slowed down and tried to step more dignified only when they had almost reached the hall. She heard Jon shout and when she entered the hall after him, every man and woman in the hall was frozen in place, somehow all looking guilty. <i>What happened here? </i>Even amiable Podrick seemed to be angry. Sansa searched the people in the hall. Brienne was nowhere in sight and Lyanna Mormont looked at the floor as if she was ashamed.</p><p>To her dismay Sansa saw that Alys was bloodied. A trail of blood was slowly running from her right temple, and Sansa could see that her lip had split. The Hound held Alys, but she couldn\u2019t even tell, if he was supporting her or restraining her. </p><p>Sansa ran over, all her anger at Alys forgotten. She gestured wildly at the hound to release her. Alys stared at her dumbfounded, and Sansa worried that she had hit her head. She took Alys\u2019 hand. </p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d, she asked, worried. Blinding anger took hold of her.</p><p>Alys hand still in hers, she turned. \u201cThat I must see something like that in Winterfell. I am ashamed.\u201d Her voice threatened to topple over. </p><p>\u201cWho did this? Who was such a craven that he would hit a woman?\u201d She felt tears pricking at her eyes, and she sucked in breath raggedly. In a flash she saw herself, much younger at the mercy of Joffrey\u2019s kingsguard.</p><p>Her question was met with silence and she clenched her fists. Suddenly, the crowd parted, and Sansa\u2019s gaze fell on Olyvar. If anything, he looked worse than Alys. His left eye had begun to swell shut and he would sport a purple eye for the next week. She glared at him.</p><p>\u201cDid you hit Alys?\u201d, she demanded.</p><p>Olyvar nodded, what she could see of his face looking miserable.</p><p>Sansa shook her fist at him. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? How dare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa,\u201d the Hound spoke up. \u201cLady Alys struck first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s barely an excuse. Olyvar is a head taller! I don\u2019t care if Lady Alys is a fighter. He should not have hit back.\u201d Sansa scowled and turnd to Alys. \u201cIs that the truth?\u201d Alys did not answer, she just stared at her.</p><p>\u201cSomeone fetch Maester Samwell. I think she has a concussion.\u201d, Jon said. He had come to her side.</p><p>Alys whispered something, but Sansa did not catch the words.</p><p>\u201cWhy did she strike you?\u201d, Jon asked Olyvar.</p><p>Strangely, Olyvar blushed a deep and alarming shade of red, and sunk his head, afraid to meet her or Jon\u2019s eyes. Sansa looked around, but nobody seemed ready to answer her. </p><p><i>I\u2019ll get to the bottom of this.</i> She was just about to demand an explanation again, when Lady Lyanna clearing her throat caught her attention. With the silence so thick in the hall, it sounded oddly loud.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa, Your Grace,\u201d Sansa did not remember to have ever seen Lyanna that uncomfortable. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she encouraged her.</p><p>\u201cOlyvar Frey reminded us about what is important in the wars to come. His loyalty puts us all to shame. We shouldn\u2019t need to be reminded about what it means to be loyal by a boy from the Riverlands.\u201d Lyanna\u2019s voice was raw, but her eyes were searching Sansa\u2019s face as if she was wondering about something only Sansa could answer. </p><p>Sansa turned to Alys again, and she saw that the girl was fighting tears.</p><p>\u201cBut why would that be a reason to strike Olyvar?\u201d, she wanted to know. </p><p>\u201cI hit him, because he is right,\u201d Alys wailed. She lost her fight with the tears. \u201cHe told me that I\u2019m just jealous of your needlework. That\u2019s when I hit him.\u201d</p><p>For a tiny moment Sansa was lost. <i>Why would she be so upset about my needlework?</i> She touched Alys at the shoulder. <i>She just wants to belong.</i> She took a step closer and closed her arms around the younger woman and with a loud sob, Alys pressed herself to Sansa and cried into her neck.</p><p>Sansa made low sounds like she did with the twins, when they were upset, and stroked Alys\u2019 back. It took Alys a long while to get hold of herself and Sansa wondered if her face was dissolving in all the tears and if her dress would get salt stains.</p><p>Around them the awkward silence came to an end, when Jon ordered everyone who had fought to apologize and told servants to fetch ice from outside for \u201cOlyvar\u2019s spectacular purple eye\u201d and everyone else who had need of it.</p><p>After a while, Sansa saw with dismay that there were tiny white dots on Alys\u2019 light brown hair, but she held on to the crying girl, until the flood of tears finally came to an end with a string of hiccups. Sansa loosened her hold. </p><p>\u201cIf you would still give me a doublet, I would be very honoured to accept it, Lady Sansa.\u201d Alys whispered.</p><p>Sansa smiled encouragingly at the girl. \u201cCome with me to my chambers then, if you feel up to it, so that I can take the measures.\u201d It would be a good opportunity to do something about the nits without humiliating the girl further.</p><p>Before she left the hall, Alys trailing behind her, she crooked a finger and waved Podrick to her side. \u201cEveryone is to report either to me or to Gilly and Maester Samwell.\u201d If lice wanted to take over Winterfell they had not counted on Sansa Stark, and if she had to comb each and every member of the household.</p>",

Her voice sounded flat in her own ears.</p><p>Jon shook his head. </p><p>\u201cIf Littlefinger was alive and would stand before me I\u2019d still kill him with my own hands, even if it would have meant losing the Knights of the Vale. But to wish for that, would also mean that we wouldn\u2019t have Eddard and Rickon. I can\u2019t even try to imagine that.\u201d</p><p>Sansa resumed her work on Jon\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cNeither can I,\u201d she admitted. She chuckled softly. \u201cSometimes I think, life should be less complicated.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded. \u201cAnd yet sometimes I think it is very easy. I just have to keep you safe, you and the children, and that is all there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, that is enough.\u201d Sansa said. She did not dare to say more. They were treading on thin ice as it were.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long did you work on that wonderful new lucky charm.\u201d, Jon asked</p><p>Sansa wondered, if Jon knew she had used her own hair for Ghost\u2019s red eyes and the weirwood leaves. She had seen him fingering the red threads.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I couldn\u2019t say,\u201d she answered. \u201cI made it while you were at the wall, and since I worked on it for many hours, I couldn\u2019t keep it a secret from the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you make the red leaves? They shine like burnished copper.\u201d Jon asked. \u00a0Sansa licked her lips. <i>If I tell him, what will he say?</i></p><p>But they were interrupted again, when the door banged open and Podrick barged in, again.</p><p>Sansa scowled at him. \u201cPodrick\u201d, she shouted. \u201cWhat by the Gods is wrong with you today?\u201d</p><p>Podrick panted heavily. \u201cYour grace, there is a brawl in the hall. Olyvar and Alys are at each other\u2019s throats and I can\u2019t stop them. Others are joining the brawl, it is a mess.\u201d</p><p>Jon jumped up and Sansa barely managed to snatch the cloth from his shoulders. He should look dignified, even separating fighing idiots. Jon ran with Podrick and Sansa followed hastily. She slowed down and tried to step more dignified only when they had almost reached the hall. She heard Jon shout and when she entered the hall after him, every man and woman in the hall was frozen in place, somehow all looking guilty. <i>What happened here? </i>Even amiable Podrick seemed to be angry. Sansa searched the people in the hall. Brienne was nowhere in sight and Lyanna Mormont looked at the floor as if she was ashamed.</p><p>To her dismay Sansa saw that Alys was bloodied. A trail of blood was slowly running from her right temple, and Sansa could see that her lip had split. The Hound held Alys, but she couldn\u2019t even tell, if he was supporting her or restraining her. </p><p>Sansa ran over, all her anger at Alys forgotten. She gestured wildly at the hound to release her. Alys stared at her dumbfounded, and Sansa worried that she had hit her head. She took Alys\u2019 hand. </p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d, she asked, worried. Blinding anger took hold of her.</p><p>Alys hand still in hers, she turned. \u201cThat I must see something like that in Winterfell. I am ashamed.\u201d Her voice threatened to topple over. </p><p>\u201cWho did this? Who was such a craven that he would hit a woman?\u201d She felt tears pricking at her eyes, and she sucked in breath raggedly. In a flash she saw herself, much younger at the mercy of Joffrey\u2019s kingsguard.</p><p>Her question was met with silence and she clenched her fists. Suddenly, the crowd parted, and Sansa\u2019s gaze fell on Olyvar. If anything, he looked worse than Alys. His left eye had begun to swell shut and he would sport a purple eye for the next week. She glared at him.</p><p>\u201cDid you hit Alys?\u201d, she demanded.</p><p>Olyvar nodded, what she could see of his face looking miserable.</p><p>Sansa shook her fist at him. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? How dare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa,\u201d the Hound spoke up. \u201cLady Alys struck first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s barely an excuse. Olyvar is a head taller! I don\u2019t care if Lady Alys is a fighter. He should not have hit back.\u201d Sansa scowled and turnd to Alys. \u201cIs that the truth?\u201d Alys did not answer, she just stared at her.</p><p>\u201cSomeone fetch Maester Samwell. I think she has a concussion.\u201d, Jon said. He had come to her side.</p><p>Alys whispered something, but Sansa did not catch the words.</p><p>\u201cWhy did she strike you?\u201d, Jon asked Olyvar.</p><p>Strangely, Olyvar blushed a deep and alarming shade of red, and sunk his head, afraid to meet her or Jon\u2019s eyes. Sansa looked around, but nobody seemed ready to answer her. </p><p><i>I\u2019ll get to the bottom of this.</i> She was just about to demand an explanation again, when Lady Lyanna clearing her throat caught her attention. With the silence so thick in the hall, it sounded oddly loud.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa, Your Grace,\u201d Sansa did not remember to have ever seen Lyanna that uncomfortable. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she encouraged her.</p><p>\u201cOlyvar Frey reminded us about what is important in the wars to come. His loyalty puts us all to shame. We shouldn\u2019t need to be reminded about what it means to be loyal by a boy from the Riverlands.\u201d Lyanna\u2019s voice was raw, but her eyes were searching Sansa\u2019s face as if she was wondering about something only Sansa could answer. </p><p>Sansa turned to Alys again, and she saw that the girl was fighting tears.</p><p>\u201cBut why would that be a reason to strike Olyvar?\u201d, she wanted to know. </p><p>\u201cI hit him, because he is right,\u201d Alys wailed. She lost her fight with the tears. \u201cHe told me that I\u2019m just jealous of your needlework. That\u2019s when I hit him.\u201d</p><p>For a tiny moment Sansa was lost. <i>Why would she be so upset about my needlework?</i> She touched Alys at the shoulder. <i>She just wants to belong.</i> She took a step closer and closed her arms around the younger woman and with a loud sob, Alys pressed herself to Sansa and cried into her neck.</p><p>Sansa made low sounds like she did with the twins, when they were upset, and stroked Alys\u2019 back. It took Alys a long while to get hold of herself and Sansa wondered if her face was dissolving in all the tears and if her dress would get salt stains.</p><p>Around them the awkward silence came to an end, when Jon ordered everyone who had fought to apologize and told servants to fetch ice from outside for \u201cOlyvar\u2019s spectacular purple eye\u201d and everyone else who had need of it.</p><p>After a while, Sansa saw with dismay that there were tiny white dots on Alys\u2019 light brown hair, but she held on to the crying girl, until the flood of tears finally came to an end with a string of hiccups. Sansa loosened her hold. </p><p>\u201cIf you would still give me a doublet, I would be very honoured to accept it, Lady Sansa.\u201d Alys whispered.</p><p>Sansa smiled encouragingly at the girl. \u201cCome with me to my chambers then, if you feel up to it, so that I can take the measures.\u201d It would be a good opportunity to do something about the nits without humiliating the girl further.</p><p>Before she left the hall, Alys trailing behind her, she crooked a finger and waved Podrick to her side. \u201cEveryone is to report either to me or to Gilly and Maester Samwell.\u201d If lice wanted to take over Winterfell they had not counted on Sansa Stark, and if she had to comb each and every member of the household.</p></p>",

This particular scene has been in my head since 2017\u2026 Well\u2026 Comments are very much appreciated! Also on <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F8806564%2Fchapters%2F35042759&amp;t=MDMyNTU0NzAzODQ2YzA1NTg1ZmEwYWU1YTg5OTczNDUzZGMwOWE1YSxhMDEzYjZlOGIzMmU1ZjZlNTlkOTRjMDhhZWJjNTNlMmI3NDVkZTdm\">AO3</a>.</p><p>\u201cThere was no need to be that secretive about this.\u201d Jon said. \u201cYou could have told me, that I have lice, the moment you spotted them.\u201d</p><p>Sansa scowled, looking at the result of her latest combing in the nitcomb. Gilly\u2019s concoction had indeed worked well. The lice on the comb were motionless, perhaps even dead. </p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m quite proud of myself. When I was a child I would have left the hall screaming, and who would have stitched you up, then?\u201d she asked.\u00a0</p><p>Jon chuckled. \u201cYes, I remember you insisted that you couldn\u2019t have any, when we were children. It was one of the few times, I heard Lady Catelyn shout at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made Robb hold me, until she had found a nit and provided me with proof. I was mortified,\u201d she remembered. \u201cArya teased me for weeks, tickling my neck with anything that came in handy.\u201d</p><p>Sansa took a feather from her table and tickled Jon at the back of his neck. \u201cSomething is crawling there, Sansa, I think you got them again.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed.</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d Jon said. \u201cYou might be right, and I got them from the children, but we\u2019ve been away for weeks. I think we should check everyone.\u201d</p><p>Sansa sighed. \u201cGilly would agree. She says, lice are not that harmless, that they transport illnesses\u2026. But there is no way, I let the King in the North run around with lice any longer than necessary. First, I look after me and my family to get rid of these nasty visitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Gilly treat you?\u201d, Jon asked. He almost sounded as if he regretted that. \u201cIs that why you have your hair in a knot?\u201d</p><p>Sansa hummed her agreement and worked the comb through another of Jon\u2019s hair strands. Even with Gilly\u2019s oily concoction, Jon\u2019s locks were a nightmare to comb. </p><p>\u201cI like the knot. You have a lovely neck.\u201d Jon said. </p><p>Sansa felt a blush creeping into her cheeks and before she caught it, a sigh had escaped her lips.<i> Careful.</i> <i>Best not answer that.</i> Jon\u2019s remark made her painfully aware, that they were alone, which they hadn\u2019t been for weeks. Looking at Jon\u2019 neck, she saw that a flush had crept to his face as well. When he inhaled, his breath sounded loudly in her ears. <i>I wonder when we will kiss\u2026. And more\u2026</i> She was sure that they both were fighting a losing battle, and she knew that it was very dangerous to be alone with Jon. She dreaded the moment, they would give in to the temptation. And she looked forward to it.</p><p>While Sansa was busy meticulously searching for the nasty buggers, they discussed the incident with the messengers. Sansa confided to Jon that she would have preferred if Cersei had held on longer. She was not as sure as Jon that the assassination attempt would buy them time with the Targaryen queen, but they agreed that Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons were probably a task for spring.</p><p>Sansa concentrated again on the task of combing and controlling the comb for lice. So far she had only found dead lice. <i>Gilly really is a genius.</i> Jon did his best to hold still, even though an occasional grunt told her, that although she was careful, she could not prevent from pulling Jon\u2019s hair occasionally. After all when she found nits, she picked at them with her nails and tore them from his hair.</p><p>\u201cGilly says, we have to do this every day for a week.\u201d </p><p>Jon made a sound that was difficult to interpret. Then he gave a very elaborate sigh, that to Sansa\u2019s ears sounded fake.</p><p>Sansa wondered, if he liked his hair being touched. She indulged herself and smoothed Jon\u2019s hair and tried to salvage the moment. Jon\u2019s closeness, the excuse to touch him. As much as she detested lice, moments like this were so rare. </p><p>The door banged open and Alys Karstark banged in, followed by Podrick.</p><p>Sansa was angry.</p><p>\u201cI told you we are not be disturbed.\u201d She scolded Podrick.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to apologize\u201d, Podrick said.</p><p>Sansa felt a flash of annoyance at the interruption and tried to get rid of Podrick and Alys as fast as possible. Even though she still felt strongly about Alys\u2019 rejection, she accepted the apology, but sent them away again. When they were gone, she bit her lip. <i>So much for trying to keep the lice a secret.</i> But the damage was done. The sudden appearance of Podrick had reminded her how difficult it was to be with Jon alone. Her heart sank and her mood deteriorated. </p><p>\u201cI think she is jealous,\u201d Jon mused.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sansa asked. </p><p>\u201cShe is so full of anger, insecure despite her skills with a sword. I think she would like to be like you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa scoffed and her irritation let the words tumble out of her mouth. \u201cI doubt that. I think the girl is in love with you.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and would have taken the words back, if she could. <i>Dangerous, far too dangerous, Sansa. What do you expect Jon will make of that.</i></p><p>Jon laughed, but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>There was a pause, and Sansa resumed her work on his hair. <i>I will not ask.</i></p><p>\u201cEverytime I see her, I see her staring at you.\u201d Jon said after a while. \u201cI would say she is jealous of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never caught her staring at me,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cHer eyes follow you.\u201d</p><p>She stopped for a moment and thought. \u201cBut I admit she doesn\u2019t look smitten, not really, just forelorn.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe she just wants to belong somewhere?\u201d Jon wondered loudly. \u201cI mean, there must be reason why the Gods told us to treat her like our sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, why did she reject the honour to be in our guard then?\u201d Sansa asked him.</p><p>Jon turned and looked at her. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still angry.\u201d, he said.</p><p>Sansa let her hands drop. \u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt takes me hours to make one of these doublets.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled, and she playfully hit him with the comb. </p><p>He turned again and spoke into the thin air in front of his face. \u201cI love your needlework,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to know how long it took me to make this shawl, I\u2019m not going to tell you, or only if you tell me, how a piece of ragged cloth stitched for practice became a lucky charm I made with magic.\u201d</p><p>Sansa could see that blood rushed to Jon\u2019s head. The part of his neck, she could see was redder than before.</p><p>\u201cRemember when I was so angry with you just after you killed Littlefinger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. You left Winterfell for months and didn\u2019t even say goodbye,\u201d Sansa said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jon reached behind his back and took her hand to give an all too short squeeze. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say goodbye, but I wanted to have something with me as a remembrance. I took this from your sewing basket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it was a practice piece. How did this become a lucky charm?\u201d she asked.</p><p>It was perhaps good that Jon was not looking at her. Even so, his words came with pauses.</p><p>\u201cPodrick is to blame. We were on a dangerous mission against some of the Ironborn after all and he\u2026\u201c Jon hesitated. \u201cOne morning he caught me looking at the cloth, when I was thinking about how I had left you and that you were pregnant. I thought I might die without ever reconciling with you \u2026 I didn\u2019t know what else to tell him.\u201d</p><p>Sansa had stopped. Her hand was hovering over Jon\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I married him to save you, to save us.\u201d <i>I should stop. I should change the subject. This is too dangerous. </i>But that was only a part of Sansa. Another part or her wanted very much to know. <i>Did you love me, even then? Do you love me?</i> She bit her lip.</p><p>She could clearly hear Jon\u2019s breath.</p><p>\u201cI know. Still, I was so angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you angry still?\u201d, Sansa asked. Her voice sounded flat in her own ears.</p><p>Jon shook his head. </p><p>\u201cIf Littlefinger was alive and would stand before me I\u2019d still kill him with my own hands, even if it would have meant losing the Knights of the Vale. But to wish for that, would also mean that we wouldn\u2019t have Eddard and Rickon. I can\u2019t even try to imagine that.\u201d</p><p>Sansa resumed her work on Jon\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cNeither can I,\u201d she admitted. She chuckled softly. \u201cSometimes I think, life should be less complicated.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded. \u201cAnd yet sometimes I think it is very easy. I just have to keep you safe, you and the children, and that is all there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, that is enough.\u201d Sansa said. She did not dare to say more. They were treading on thin ice as it were.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long did you work on that wonderful new lucky charm.\u201d, Jon asked</p><p>Sansa wondered, if Jon knew she had used her own hair for Ghost\u2019s red eyes and the weirwood leaves. She had seen him fingering the red threads.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I couldn\u2019t say,\u201d she answered. \u201cI made it while you were at the wall, and since I worked on it for many hours, I couldn\u2019t keep it a secret from the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you make the red leaves? They shine like burnished copper.\u201d Jon asked. \u00a0Sansa licked her lips. <i>If I tell him, what will he say?</i></p><p>But they were interrupted again, when the door banged open and Podrick barged in, again.</p><p>Sansa scowled at him. \u201cPodrick\u201d, she shouted. \u201cWhat by the Gods is wrong with you today?\u201d</p><p>Podrick panted heavily. \u201cYour grace, there is a brawl in the hall. Olyvar and Alys are at each other\u2019s throats and I can\u2019t stop them. Others are joining the brawl, it is a mess.\u201d</p><p>Jon jumped up and Sansa barely managed to snatch the cloth from his shoulders. He should look dignified, even separating fighing idiots. Jon ran with Podrick and Sansa followed hastily. She slowed down and tried to step more dignified only when they had almost reached the hall. She heard Jon shout and when she entered the hall after him, every man and woman in the hall was frozen in place, somehow all looking guilty. <i>What happened here? </i>Even amiable Podrick seemed to be angry. Sansa searched the people in the hall. Brienne was nowhere in sight and Lyanna Mormont looked at the floor as if she was ashamed.</p><p>To her dismay Sansa saw that Alys was bloodied. A trail of blood was slowly running from her right temple, and Sansa could see that her lip had split. The Hound held Alys, but she couldn\u2019t even tell, if he was supporting her or restraining her. </p><p>Sansa ran over, all her anger at Alys forgotten. She gestured wildly at the hound to release her. Alys stared at her dumbfounded, and Sansa worried that she had hit her head. She took Alys\u2019 hand. </p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d, she asked, worried. Blinding anger took hold of her.</p><p>Alys hand still in hers, she turned. \u201cThat I must see something like that in Winterfell. I am ashamed.\u201d Her voice threatened to topple over. </p><p>\u201cWho did this? Who was such a craven that he would hit a woman?\u201d She felt tears pricking at her eyes, and she sucked in breath raggedly. In a flash she saw herself, much younger at the mercy of Joffrey\u2019s kingsguard.</p><p>Her question was met with silence and she clenched her fists. Suddenly, the crowd parted, and Sansa\u2019s gaze fell on Olyvar. If anything, he looked worse than Alys. His left eye had begun to swell shut and he would sport a purple eye for the next week. She glared at him.</p><p>\u201cDid you hit Alys?\u201d, she demanded.</p><p>Olyvar nodded, what she could see of his face looking miserable.</p><p>Sansa shook her fist at him. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? How dare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa,\u201d the Hound spoke up. \u201cLady Alys struck first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s barely an excuse. Olyvar is a head taller! I don\u2019t care if Lady Alys is a fighter. He should not have hit back.\u201d Sansa scowled and turnd to Alys. \u201cIs that the truth?\u201d Alys did not answer, she just stared at her.</p><p>\u201cSomeone fetch Maester Samwell. I think she has a concussion.\u201d, Jon said. He had come to her side.</p><p>Alys whispered something, but Sansa did not catch the words.</p><p>\u201cWhy did she strike you?\u201d, Jon asked Olyvar.</p><p>Strangely, Olyvar blushed a deep and alarming shade of red, and sunk his head, afraid to meet her or Jon\u2019s eyes. Sansa looked around, but nobody seemed ready to answer her. </p><p><i>I\u2019ll get to the bottom of this.</i> She was just about to demand an explanation again, when Lady Lyanna clearing her throat caught her attention. With the silence so thick in the hall, it sounded oddly loud.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa, Your Grace,\u201d Sansa did not remember to have ever seen Lyanna that uncomfortable. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she encouraged her.</p><p>\u201cOlyvar Frey reminded us about what is important in the wars to come. His loyalty puts us all to shame. We shouldn\u2019t need to be reminded about what it means to be loyal by a boy from the Riverlands.\u201d Lyanna\u2019s voice was raw, but her eyes were searching Sansa\u2019s face as if she was wondering about something only Sansa could answer. </p><p>Sansa turned to Alys again, and she saw that the girl was fighting tears.</p><p>\u201cBut why would that be a reason to strike Olyvar?\u201d, she wanted to know. </p><p>\u201cI hit him, because he is right,\u201d Alys wailed. She lost her fight with the tears. \u201cHe told me that I\u2019m just jealous of your needlework. That\u2019s when I hit him.\u201d</p><p>For a tiny moment Sansa was lost. <i>Why would she be so upset about my needlework?</i> She touched Alys at the shoulder. <i>She just wants to belong.</i> She took a step closer and closed her arms around the younger woman and with a loud sob, Alys pressed herself to Sansa and cried into her neck.</p><p>Sansa made low sounds like she did with the twins, when they were upset, and stroked Alys\u2019 back. It took Alys a long while to get hold of herself and Sansa wondered if her face was dissolving in all the tears and if her dress would get salt stains.</p><p>Around them the awkward silence came to an end, when Jon ordered everyone who had fought to apologize and told servants to fetch ice from outside for \u201cOlyvar\u2019s spectacular purple eye\u201d and everyone else who had need of it.</p><p>After a while, Sansa saw with dismay that there were tiny white dots on Alys\u2019 light brown hair, but she held on to the crying girl, until the flood of tears finally came to an end with a string of hiccups. Sansa loosened her hold. </p><p>\u201cIf you would still give me a doublet, I would be very honoured to accept it, Lady Sansa.\u201d Alys whispered.</p><p>Sansa smiled encouragingly at the girl. \u201cCome with me to my chambers then, if you feel up to it, so that I can take the measures.\u201d It would be a good opportunity to do something about the nits without humiliating the girl further.</p><p>Before she left the hall, Alys trailing behind her, she crooked a finger and waved Podrick to her side. \u201cEveryone is to report either to me or to Gilly and Maester Samwell.\u201d If lice wanted to take over Winterfell they had not counted on Sansa Stark, and if she had to comb each and every member of the household.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Bittersweet - Chapter 17 - Nasty visitors</h1><p>So, here a rather light-hearted chapter of my slowburn&hellip;.&nbsp; Thanks to everybody who reads my stories and is patient enough although I don&rsquo;t have enough time for the actual writing. This particular scene has been in my head since 2017&hellip; Well&hellip; Comments are very much appreciated! Also on <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F8806564%2Fchapters%2F35042759&amp;t=MDMyNTU0NzAzODQ2YzA1NTg1ZmEwYWU1YTg5OTczNDUzZGMwOWE1YSxhMDEzYjZlOGIzMmU1ZjZlNTlkOTRjMDhhZWJjNTNlMmI3NDVkZTdm\">AO3</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;There was no need to be that secretive about this.&rdquo; Jon said. &ldquo;You could have told me, that I have lice, the moment you spotted them.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa scowled, looking at the result of her latest combing in the nitcomb. Gilly&rsquo;s concoction had indeed worked well. The lice on the comb were motionless, perhaps even dead. </p><p>&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m quite proud of myself. When I was a child I would have left the hall screaming, and who would have stitched you up, then?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon chuckled. &ldquo;Yes, I remember you insisted that you couldn&rsquo;t have any, when we were children. It was one of the few times, I heard Lady Catelyn shout at you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She made Robb hold me, until she had found a nit and provided me with proof. I was mortified,&rdquo; she remembered. &ldquo;Arya teased me for weeks, tickling my neck with anything that came in handy.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa took a feather from her table and tickled Jon at the back of his neck. &ldquo;Something is crawling there, Sansa, I think you got them again.&rdquo;</p><p>They both laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; Jon said. &ldquo;You might be right, and I got them from the children, but we&rsquo;ve been away for weeks. I think we should check everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa sighed. &ldquo;Gilly would agree. She says, lice are not that harmless, that they transport illnesses&hellip;. But there is no way, I let the King in the North run around with lice any longer than necessary. First, I look after me and my family to get rid of these nasty visitors.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did Gilly treat you?&rdquo;, Jon asked. He almost sounded as if he regretted that. &ldquo;Is that why you have your hair in a knot?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa hummed her agreement and worked the comb through another of Jon&rsquo;s hair strands. Even with Gilly&rsquo;s oily concoction, Jon&rsquo;s locks were a nightmare to comb. </p><p>&ldquo;I like the knot. You have a lovely neck.&rdquo; Jon said. </p><p>Sansa felt a blush creeping into her cheeks and before she caught it, a sigh had escaped her lips.<i> Careful.</i> <i>Best not answer that.</i> Jon&rsquo;s remark made her painfully aware, that they were alone, which they hadn&rsquo;t been for weeks. Looking at Jon&rsquo; neck, she saw that a flush had crept to his face as well. When he inhaled, his breath sounded loudly in her ears. <i>I wonder when we will kiss&hellip;. And more&hellip;</i> She was sure that they both were fighting a losing battle, and she knew that it was very dangerous to be alone with Jon. She dreaded the moment, they would give in to the temptation. And she looked forward to it.</p><p>While Sansa was busy meticulously searching for the nasty buggers, they discussed the incident with the messengers. Sansa confided to Jon that she would have preferred if Cersei had held on longer. She was not as sure as Jon that the assassination attempt would buy them time with the Targaryen queen, but they agreed that Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons were probably a task for spring.</p><p>Sansa concentrated again on the task of combing and controlling the comb for lice. So far she had only found dead lice. <i>Gilly really is a genius.</i> Jon did his best to hold still, even though an occasional grunt told her, that although she was careful, she could not prevent from pulling Jon&rsquo;s hair occasionally. After all when she found nits, she picked at them with her nails and tore them from his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Gilly says, we have to do this every day for a week.&rdquo; </p><p>Jon made a sound that was difficult to interpret. Then he gave a very elaborate sigh, that to Sansa&rsquo;s ears sounded fake.</p><p>Sansa wondered, if he liked his hair being touched. She indulged herself and smoothed Jon&rsquo;s hair and tried to salvage the moment. Jon&rsquo;s closeness, the excuse to touch him. As much as she detested lice, moments like this were so rare. </p><p>The door banged open and Alys Karstark banged in, followed by Podrick.</p><p>Sansa was angry.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you we are not be disturbed.&rdquo; She scolded Podrick.</p><p>&ldquo;She wants to apologize&rdquo;, Podrick said.</p><p>Sansa felt a flash of annoyance at the interruption and tried to get rid of Podrick and Alys as fast as possible. Even though she still felt strongly about Alys&rsquo; rejection, she accepted the apology, but sent them away again. When they were gone, she bit her lip. <i>So much for trying to keep the lice a secret.</i> But the damage was done. The sudden appearance of Podrick had reminded her how difficult it was to be with Jon alone. Her heart sank and her mood deteriorated. </p><p>&ldquo;I think she is jealous,&rdquo; Jon mused.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Sansa asked. </p><p>&ldquo;She is so full of anger, insecure despite her skills with a sword. I think she would like to be like you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa scoffed and her irritation let the words tumble out of her mouth. &ldquo;I doubt that. I think the girl is in love with you.&rdquo;</p><p>She bit her lip and would have taken the words back, if she could. <i>Dangerous, far too dangerous, Sansa. What do you expect Jon will make of that.</i></p><p>Jon laughed, but didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p><p>There was a pause, and Sansa resumed her work on his hair. <i>I will not ask.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Everytime I see her, I see her staring at you.&rdquo; Jon said after a while. &ldquo;I would say she is jealous of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never caught her staring at me,&rdquo; Sansa said. &ldquo;Her eyes follow you.&rdquo;</p><p>She stopped for a moment and thought. &ldquo;But I admit she doesn&rsquo;t look smitten, not really, just forelorn.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe she just wants to belong somewhere?&rdquo; Jon wondered loudly. &ldquo;I mean, there must be reason why the Gods told us to treat her like our sister.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, why did she reject the honour to be in our guard then?&rdquo; Sansa asked him.</p><p>Jon turned and looked at her. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still angry.&rdquo;, he said.</p><p>Sansa let her hands drop. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;It takes me hours to make one of these doublets.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon smiled, and she playfully hit him with the comb. </p><p>He turned again and spoke into the thin air in front of his face. &ldquo;I love your needlework,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;If you want to know how long it took me to make this shawl, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you, or only if you tell me, how a piece of ragged cloth stitched for practice became a lucky charm I made with magic.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa could see that blood rushed to Jon&rsquo;s head. The part of his neck, she could see was redder than before.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember when I was so angry with you just after you killed Littlefinger?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm. You left Winterfell for months and didn&rsquo;t even say goodbye,&rdquo; Sansa said.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Jon reached behind his back and took her hand to give an all too short squeeze. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say goodbye, but I wanted to have something with me as a remembrance. I took this from your sewing basket.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, it was a practice piece. How did this become a lucky charm?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>It was perhaps good that Jon was not looking at her. Even so, his words came with pauses.</p><p>&ldquo;Podrick is to blame. We were on a dangerous mission against some of the Ironborn after all and he&hellip;&ldquo; Jon hesitated. &ldquo;One morning he caught me looking at the cloth, when I was thinking about how I had left you and that you were pregnant. I thought I might die without ever reconciling with you &hellip; I didn&rsquo;t know what else to tell him.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa had stopped. Her hand was hovering over Jon&rsquo;s hair.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I married him to save you, to save us.&rdquo; <i>I should stop. I should change the subject. This is too dangerous. </i>But that was only a part of Sansa. Another part or her wanted very much to know. <i>Did you love me, even then? Do you love me?</i> She bit her lip.</p><p>She could clearly hear Jon&rsquo;s breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. Still, I was so angry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you angry still?&rdquo;, Sansa asked. Her voice sounded flat in her own ears.</p><p>Jon shook his head. </p><p>&ldquo;If Littlefinger was alive and would stand before me I&rsquo;d still kill him with my own hands, even if it would have meant losing the Knights of the Vale. But to wish for that, would also mean that we wouldn&rsquo;t have Eddard and Rickon. I can&rsquo;t even try to imagine that.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa resumed her work on Jon&rsquo;s hair. </p><p>&ldquo;Neither can I,&rdquo; she admitted. She chuckled softly. &ldquo;Sometimes I think, life should be less complicated.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon nodded. &ldquo;And yet sometimes I think it is very easy. I just have to keep you safe, you and the children, and that is all there is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes, that is enough.&rdquo; Sansa said. She did not dare to say more. They were treading on thin ice as it were.</p><p>&ldquo;So, how long did you work on that wonderful new lucky charm.&rdquo;, Jon asked</p><p>Sansa wondered, if Jon knew she had used her own hair for Ghost&rsquo;s red eyes and the weirwood leaves. She had seen him fingering the red threads.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, I couldn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I made it while you were at the wall, and since I worked on it for many hours, I couldn&rsquo;t keep it a secret from the children.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you make the red leaves? They shine like burnished copper.&rdquo; Jon asked. &nbsp;Sansa licked her lips. <i>If I tell him, what will he say?</i></p><p>But they were interrupted again, when the door banged open and Podrick barged in, again.</p><p>Sansa scowled at him. &ldquo;Podrick&rdquo;, she shouted. &ldquo;What by the Gods is wrong with you today?&rdquo;</p><p>Podrick panted heavily. &ldquo;Your grace, there is a brawl in the hall. Olyvar and Alys are at each other&rsquo;s throats and I can&rsquo;t stop them. Others are joining the brawl, it is a mess.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon jumped up and Sansa barely managed to snatch the cloth from his shoulders. He should look dignified, even separating fighing idiots. Jon ran with Podrick and Sansa followed hastily. She slowed down and tried to step more dignified only when they had almost reached the hall. She heard Jon shout and when she entered the hall after him, every man and woman in the hall was frozen in place, somehow all looking guilty. <i>What happened here? </i>Even amiable Podrick seemed to be angry. Sansa searched the people in the hall. Brienne was nowhere in sight and Lyanna Mormont looked at the floor as if she was ashamed.</p><p>To her dismay Sansa saw that Alys was bloodied. A trail of blood was slowly running from her right temple, and Sansa could see that her lip had split. The Hound held Alys, but she couldn&rsquo;t even tell, if he was supporting her or restraining her. </p><p>Sansa ran over, all her anger at Alys forgotten. She gestured wildly at the hound to release her. Alys stared at her dumbfounded, and Sansa worried that she had hit her head. She took Alys&rsquo; hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;, she asked, worried. Blinding anger took hold of her.</p><p>Alys hand still in hers, she turned. &ldquo;That I must see something like that in Winterfell. I am ashamed.&rdquo; Her voice threatened to topple over. </p><p>&ldquo;Who did this? Who was such a craven that he would hit a woman?&rdquo; She felt tears pricking at her eyes, and she sucked in breath raggedly. In a flash she saw herself, much younger at the mercy of Joffrey&rsquo;s kingsguard.</p><p>Her question was met with silence and she clenched her fists. Suddenly, the crowd parted, and Sansa&rsquo;s gaze fell on Olyvar. If anything, he looked worse than Alys. His left eye had begun to swell shut and he would sport a purple eye for the next week. She glared at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you hit Alys?&rdquo;, she demanded.</p><p>Olyvar nodded, what she could see of his face looking miserable.</p><p>Sansa shook her fist at him. &ldquo;What is wrong with you? How dare you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Sansa,&rdquo; the Hound spoke up. &ldquo;Lady Alys struck first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s barely an excuse. Olyvar is a head taller! I don&rsquo;t care if Lady Alys is a fighter. He should not have hit back.&rdquo; Sansa scowled and turnd to Alys. &ldquo;Is that the truth?&rdquo; Alys did not answer, she just stared at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Someone fetch Maester Samwell. I think she has a concussion.&rdquo;, Jon said. He had come to her side.</p><p>Alys whispered something, but Sansa did not catch the words.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did she strike you?&rdquo;, Jon asked Olyvar.</p><p>Strangely, Olyvar blushed a deep and alarming shade of red, and sunk his head, afraid to meet her or Jon&rsquo;s eyes. Sansa looked around, but nobody seemed ready to answer her. </p><p><i>I&rsquo;ll get to the bottom of this.</i> She was just about to demand an explanation again, when Lady Lyanna clearing her throat caught her attention. With the silence so thick in the hall, it sounded oddly loud.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Sansa, Your Grace,&rdquo; Sansa did not remember to have ever seen Lyanna that uncomfortable. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she encouraged her.</p><p>&ldquo;Olyvar Frey reminded us about what is important in the wars to come.

Silk trade paths from the Summer Isles had brought Missandei to these shores but now she sorely wishes she had not listened when Tyrion Lannister offered to escourt her on a tour of the country. She should\u2019ve stayed in King\u2019s Landing, where an Essosi woman would not be such an oddity amongst a sea of stern northern faces.</p>\n<p>Eyes were still finding her out as she pressed her back to the cold wall of the ballroom, and if one more person were to call her\u00a0<i>\u2018exotic\u2019</i>\u00a0she may scream.\u00a0<i>Well, perhaps not, but she\u2019s sure she\u2019ll have to double her efforts to hold her tongue amongst polite society.</i></p>\n<p>Some form of waltz had just finished when Missandei felt a presence beside her.\u00a0\u201cYou look-\u201d the unknown person starts in a decidedly gruff northern accent. Steeling herself for the end of that sentence, she forces a polite smile upon her lips and turns to face her new companion. The man was northern to be sure, dark hair and a long face in which a pair of graphite grey eyes widened as she turned, his words halting on his tongue. He flounders a bit, sucking in a breath and Missandei has to wonder at that.

There will be no update tomorrow (Sunday) because one, the week was crazy and two, this chapter is turning out to be deeper/longer than I thought it would be. =/ I know for most of you, long chapters are no problem *lol*, but I\u2019m always concerned that folks\u00a0\u2018forget\u2019 things the longer it goes, as each scene contains important nuggets that are missed (see last chapter and some comments I received that made me question if I\u2019m simply wasting my time -_-), but yeah&hellip;if it gets that long, I\u2019ll probably break it up in two, but we\u2019ll see.</p><p>2. I\u2019m reconsidering actually posting this stuff on Sundays. I know that\u2019s the day the site gets most traffic, which in turn has it shutting down and folks complaining they can\u2019t access the story, and I\u2019m wondering why I missed notifications etc. etc. In summary, I\u2019m saying, don\u2019t always expect Sunday updates from now on. I\u2019m going rogue and posting whenever the heck I\u2019m ready and finished. Hah! XD</p><p>3. In case, I haven\u2019t said it enough already, I want to THANK YOU for your support, notes, reblogs, comments etc. Seeing 80+ notes for my updates is awesome! (and yes, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s larger for some other fantabulous writers, but I\u2019ll take my successes where I can get\u00a0\u2018em! *lol*).\u00a0</p><p>Now go out there and brighten someone\u2019s day, eh? Goodness knows we need the smiles these days. (((hugs)))</p>",

Daenerys&rsquo; Essosi men in\nparticular look out of place among the northern cold, sticking close\nto the fire they&rsquo;ve built up as much as they can.<br /></p><p>Jon\nsighs, and takes another sip of ale. <i>Well, they&rsquo;ve not\nburned each other to crisps yet,</i>\nhe thinks, but since they&rsquo;ve only been wed two hours, he should give\nit time. He can tell Stannis and Daenerys, as different as they may\nseem, both want more than anything to be good rulers. They would not\nhave agreed to this match otherwise. But they also can both be proud,\nstubborn and self-righteous &ndash; so who knows what happens next.<br /></p><p>He\nlooks up at them on the dais. They look so very different, side by\nside: Stannis aging and plain, his usual look of mild discontentment\non his face, and Daenerys so young and beautiful, grinning and\ncharming everyone who comes to speak with her. Jon cannot see any\nobvious tension between the two of them, but then again, they&rsquo;re\nhardly looking at one another.<br /></p><p>His\nreverie gets interrupted by the weight of someone sitting down next\nto him, and he looks away to find Davos Seaworth by his side, stubbed\nfingers reaching for another pint of ale. &ldquo;Ser Davos,&rdquo; he says,\npleased to see a friendly face. &ldquo;How are you enjoying the feast?&rdquo;\nhe says, something of a bitter joke. He knows this is no feast.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\ncertainly eaten worse lad,&rdquo; Davos laughs at him, grabbing a bit of\nstale bread. &ldquo;Besides, I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s paying attention to\nthe food. Too busy making sure those two don&rsquo;t kill each other.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jon\nwinces, his eyes drawn back to Stannis and Daenerys. They&rsquo;re finally\nlooking at one another &ndash; but only because she is asking him to pass\nthe pickled herring.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;This\nwas my idea,&rdquo; Jon says miserably. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any coin. If they\ndestroy this place, I can&rsquo;t afford to compensate any of you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Davos\ngives him a bemused look. &ldquo;I think you can relax a little son,&rdquo;\nhe says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re anywhere near to burning the hall\ndown.&rdquo; Jon sighs. Ser Davos is likely right; he does not need to be\nso paranoid. He just has the vague fear of history repeating. After\nall, Stannis&rsquo; brother too wed a woman he didn&rsquo;t love and barely knew\nto stitch a realm torn apart by war back together. And how did that\nend?<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nforget, I was there at Stannis&rsquo; first wedding. He did not look so\nhappy then.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jon\nfrowns. What, does Stannis look happy now? He turns to the dais\nagain, and thinks Stannis looks much the same as ever. Not happy, not\nsad, just &ndash; not.<br /></p><p>But\nthen, Daenerys, with a small smile on her face, leans over and\nwhispers something in his ear. Stannis stops, almost choking on his\ncod. She pulls back, and Stannis tries to glare at her, but she just\ngrins cheekily at him. Jon watches as his face turns red, but despite\nit all, Jon thinks he sees the man&rsquo;s mouth crook a little, in what\ncould be a smile.<br /></p><p>He\ndares a little smile himself then. This still could be a disaster.\nBut maybe, just maybe, it won&rsquo;t be.<br /></p>",
