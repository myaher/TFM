        "answer": "<p>-Oh no. Why did Bakugou fall for a dekusquad member? Why is he dating a deku squad member? Maybe because of their dumb, happy smile, their ability to put up with his anger and even managed to calm him down.<br/></p><p>-His relationship with the beautiful (Name) has caused a rift in the bakusquad. The members very disappointed in his actions and had a vote to change the name of bakusquad to minasquad, yeah it didn\u2019t pass since Bakugou\u2019s quirk almost exploded the classroom when they suggested that.</p><p>-The dekusquad members took the news with the most ease, it was peaceful when (Name) told them and then they went back to discussing heroes. I mean sure Uraraka made a comment of why she\u2019s dating an \u2018angry pomeranian\u2019 but, was at the very least happy that her friend was happy. </p><p>-The dekusquad was very impressed when (Name) managed to call Bakugou \u2018Kacchan\u2019 and survived, surprisingly he just blushed and called her a cute idiot. Okay that convinced the dekusquad that Bakugou was truly in love (Name).</p><p>-Though our next problem arose, (Name) was invited on the same day to hang out with the bakusquad or the dekusquad. Her boyfriend or he best friends. Shoot, (Name) was screwed. Since she promised to buy Uraraka this really tasty crepe at the mall and watch a new hero movie with the rest of her squad but, the bakusquad wanted to take her to an amusement park. </p><p>-She ended up at an amusement park, holding a cotton candy and actual ccraziness. Gosh she loved her boyfriend but, him attempting to fight a employee that worked this one ride because she got sick, was a bit much.</p><p>-Cut to Mina screeching at Kaminari because he kept failing those rigged games to win a stuffed animal. Sero and Kirishima waiting in a massive line to ride the most craziest ride she\u2019s ever scene and now (Name) was awkwardly alone. Her phone buzzed.</p><p>-FloatyBoaty: Ferris wheel kiss or you owe me more crepes!</p><p>-(Name): Ah Chako I\u2019m still sorry about missing out on the hangout at the mall.</p><p>-FloatyBoaty: No problems! Having fun????</p><p>-(Name): I mean does watching bakubabe yell at an employee count as fun???</p><p>-FloatyBoaty: \u00a0wow what a gentleman</p><p>-(Name): oh wait he\u2019s stopped, bye</p><p>-Bakugou finally stopped and grumbly apologized to (Name) that he was being a bit of angry boyfriend. The bakusquad laughed in the background. (Name) managed to convince her lover to go on the ferris wheel since the line was short and also a pair of puppy eyes worked as well.</p><p>-Bakugou and her sat on the ferris wheel and (Name) looked down and saw the bakusquad taking pictures below and Bakugou flipped them off, what a beautiful friendship Bakugou and his friends had. At the top, she gave a thumbs up to the bakusquad which they managed to saw.</p><p>-(Name) smiled and held Katsuki\u2019s cheeks in her hands and kissed him, to which Katsuki returned. </p><p>-Cut to after the amusement park and (Name) holding at least 15 stuffed animals Katsuki won. (Name) looked down to her phone and witness the bakusquad and dekusquad joined together in a text conversation. </p><p>-The picture of her kissing Katsuki ended up in the new group chat and it flooded with texts of a proud Uraraka, Izuku awkwardly being proud of Katsuki for accepting a kiss, Iida congratulating for them being a loving couple, Denki accidentally adding Bakugou to the group chat and now the conversation ended up with way to many swears and insults to everyone else. </p><p>-Wow, who knew the two warring squads would join together in a joyous occasion to spread pictures of Katsuki being a great boyfriend and the two sharing ice cream together. </p><p>-Next day of school, Aizawa was actually impressed that the squads weren\u2019t fighting all until Bakugou blew up at least 9 desks, screeched at everyone who passed him, Aizawa went to Nedzu and asked for a raise.</p><p><br/></p><p>I hope you enjoyed and have a great day!
