He almost forgot that on the other side of the wall slept one of the people he hated most in the world. Well, maybe hate was a bit strong, but other than his father, who he really hated, he hadn\u2019t had many reasons to dislike other people throughout the years, especially in his ballet program. For the most part, they were all like one big family, which was one of Lucas\u2019 favorite parts about attending school there. </p><p>His alarm went off again and he swore under his breath, jolting out of bed and pulling on his layers of dance attire and warm up clothes as quickly as possible. He wanted to have time for a five mile run if possible before meeting Manon to stretch and warm up before class. </p><p>Throwing on his light windbreaker and grabbing his headphones off his desk, he moved to the bathroom, washing his face, using the toilet, brushing his teeth, and fixing his hair enough that it wouldn\u2019t get in his way when he had to dance later. In retrospect, he probably should have gotten a haircut before the year started, he hadn\u2019t had it so long in quite a while, but over the holidays he\u2019d really grown to love his hair a bit longer. Besides, if Eliott could dance with his wild, untameable hair, Lucas could too. </p><p>A bit after he\u2019d moved into the kitchen, the sound of Eliott\u2019s door opening caused Lucas to look up with wide eyes from where he was filling up his water bottle at the sink . Fuck, he should have been quieter. What the hell was Eliott doing up at five thirty anyway? He always arrived <i>just in time</i> for classes, but none of the instructors ever said a damn thing. It was infuriating, especially since Lucas was always one of the first people there.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Eliott said, sitting down at the counter. Lucas raised his eyebrows and continued to fill up his water. \u201cWhat are you doing up so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same question,\u201d Lucas murmured, already breaking the silent rule he\u2019d made for himself to just ignore Eliott at all costs. </p><p>Eliott shrugged and rested his elbows on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s performance year. I figure we all need to work a little bit harder, especially if we want a lead role in the show.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shut off the sink abruptly, hands clenching around his bottle. If Eliott had awoken early just to try to psych Lucas out, he was shit out of luck. Lucas wasn\u2019t going to let a few taunts psych him out this year. Eliott continued, \u201cAre you going for a run? I could join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas lied swiftly, \u201cI\u2019m meeting with Manon to warm up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit <i>too</i> early for that though, right?\u201d Eliott ticked his head to the side, smirking out of the corner of his mouth. </p><p>Lucas rolled his eyes and braced his hands on the counter. \u201cWhat do you want, Eliott?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d Eliott raised his hands in mock surrender. \u201cYou\u2019re going to eat before you go though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you my mother?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you avoiding my question?\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed in exasperation and took an apple from a bowl labelled <i>Eliott</i>. He took a bite and looked Eliott directly in the eye. \u201cThere. Happy?\u201d </p><p>Much to his displeasure, Eliott\u2019s smirk grew into a full blown grin. \u201cVery much so, yes.\u201d</p><p>Resisting the urge to spit the apple in Eliott\u2019s face, Lucas retreated back to his room to grab his dance bag and put on his tennis shoes in silence, ignoring how Eliott\u2019s eyes followed him the entire way. He continued ignoring the stare as he made his way back across the living room and out the door. The moment before it slammed shut behind him, Lucas heard Eliott\u2019s voice call out, \u201cEnjoy your run!\u201d</p><p>Grunting at the fact that his day had already been ruined, Lucas secured his headphones over his ears and blasted his music as loud as it would go, the sounds of Queen filling his head as he tried to clear his mind and ran, ran, ran.</p><p>Sometimes he found his footsteps matching the beat of the music and had to resist the urge to stop and dance right in the middle of the street. It was his curse, he supposed, to want to find a way to dance to every song he heard. Not that he was much of a choreographer. He could do fairly well during improv classes or when he\u2019d had to alter a variation for an assignment once, but creating something for a whole cast of moving bodies was dream he\u2019d long abandoned. </p><p>Lucas had always known that there would come a time when his ballet career expired and he would be thrown out like expired milk, but there had been a small part of him that had hoped he\u2019d be able to stay in that world, creating movement for others. Unfortunately, that was just a pipe dream. He didn\u2019t have what it took to be a choreographer.</p><p>A wet drop on his cheek sprung him out of his thoughts, bringing him back to the streets of Paris as he ran, steady drips of rain now falling from the sky. First the conversation with Eliott, now the rain\u2026 was it too much to ask for that his first day back went well?</p><p>Ignoring the rain about as well as he\u2019d ignored Eliott, Lucas pushed on, running faster than usual to complete the five miles he\u2019d wanted to complete before heading back inside. Maybe it all would have been ok, maybe Lucas could have gotten over the fact that it was raining, if not for the puddle he didn\u2019t notice on the side of the street. The puddle that he ran right past as a car drove right through it. The puddle that soaked the entire right half of his body, mere feet away from returning to the school. </p><p>It was going to be a long day. </p><p><b>Lundi 7:26</b></p><p>By the time Lucas had dried himself off well enough to not look like he\u2019d arrived from the lost city of Atlantis, he and Manon had only had about a half hour to warm up together before class started. They\u2019d spent most of the time talking about nothing anyway, partially him complaining about Eliott, partially her complaining about having to share a bathroom with Daphn\u00e9, not doing much to actually warm up. It didn\u2019t matter that much on the first day though, especially for the final year. That morning they were going to receive all the information about the winter show each group of students in their last year performed at the end of the fall semester. </p><p>Nearly everyone had arrived to class about fifteen minutes before eight, when the class was supposed to start. They were all fidgeting with excitement and nerves, chatting amongst themselves about what the show might be. The year before had done the Nutcracker, and Lucille, the stand out of that year&ndash; and Eliott\u2019s ex-girlfriend&ndash; had played the Snow Queen, dancing the solo so beautifully that Lucas was sure the school would never do the Nutcracker again, not wanting to mar her legacy. Manon had actually played Clara, as one student in their second to last year was allowed to audition for a role in the show each year. Lucas had been so glad it was her and not Eliott. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Eliott had yet to show up. Why the hell would he be waking up so early if he hadn\u2019t planned to show up to class on time? It made no sense to Lucas, though he supposed the reason could have simply been because he knew Lucas would be getting up earlier and wanted to be awake to rile him up. </p><p>At a minute before eight, Eliott sauntered into the room casually, meeting Sofiane\u2019s eyes immediately and moving to sit next to him, picking up a conversation as if he\u2019d been there the entire time. Lucas rolled his eyes as he watched them, he had no idea how Sofiane put up with Eliott. </p><p>There was a loud clap and everyone sat up straight immediately, jolting to attention as Madame Rigaux entered the classroom. Conversations stopped in an instant and all eyes were trained on her with a sharp, almost hungry focus. Madame Rigaux was a nightmare if she didn\u2019t like you, but her favorites always claimed she was one of the best instructors they\u2019d ever had. Lucas wasn\u2019t quite a favorite yet, but he hoped by the end of this year that he\u2019d get to experience more than the former, which he had grown accustomed to for quite some time. </p><p>\u201cGood morning, and welcome back.\u201d She spoke softly, but she knew everyone was hanging on to her every word. </p><p>\u201cGood morning Madame Rigaux,\u201d they all repeated in a chorus back to her. The corner of her mouth lifted in what one might have mistaken for a smile had they not known her. Those who did know her knew that look was born of satisfaction, of knowing the hold she had over all of them, knowing each and every one of their strengths and weaknesses and how to exploit them. It was a terrifying look. </p><p>\u201cFinal year. The time does fly, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Her question received no response, exactly as she\u2019d anticipated. \u201cThis year will be one of the most difficult perhaps in your entire career as a dancer. All the training you\u2019ve been doing up to this point is a walk in the park compared to what\u2019s in store for you this year.\u201d</p><p>Lucas unintentionally held his breath as she spoke, not wanting to cause any disturbance in the silence that had engulfed the room. It was so heavy, so deep, that each word she spoke rang out like a bell, echoing through the high ceilings. </p><p>\u201cNot only will you be continuing with your general education courses, studying in various styles and techniques of dance, some old and some new, and assisting with some of the younger classes, you will also be auditioning, rehearsing, and performing in this year\u2019s winter student production,\u201d she continued. As if they didn\u2019t all already know that, each of them barely resisting jumping up and begging her to tell them what they would be performing. </p><p>\u201cThe production, as you all know, was The Nutcracker last year.\u201d She was really going to milk it as long as she could, though Lucas couldn\u2019t say he was surprised. \u201cThis year, however, we wanted something a bit darker, more intense, with more depth from the characters to pull from. It will be both physically and emotionally demanding, and something that won\u2019t always make the audience believe in happy endings, something that will make the audience weep as they stand on their feet and applaud in awe.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Romeo and Juliet? The last class that had performed Romeo and Juliet was in their final year during Lucas\u2019 first year. It was definitely feasible, it had been quite a long time since then.</p><p>\u201cAuditions will begin next Friday, giving you almost two full weeks to prepare, a generous decision made by Monsieur Moreau, not me. If it were up to me you\u2019d begin auditions today, and we\u2019d see who has been keeping up their training during the holidays and who,\u201d she glanced pointedly at a few students, including Emma and Arthur, \u201chas some catching up to do. That all being said, I am pleased to announce that this year\u2019s winter production will be Swan Lake.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019 eyes found Eliott\u2019s instinctively. He looked away as quickly as he\u2019d looked in the first place, but not before he saw the same exact emotions he was feeling reflected in Eliott\u2019s eyes. Prince Siegfried had always been Lucas\u2019 dream role, since he\u2019d first seen the ballet as a child. It was one of the reasons his mother had enrolled him in ballet in the first place. Of course, Prince Siegfried was also Eliott\u2019s dream role, it was one of the things they had bonded over as children, arguing playfully about who got to be the Prince, and who played Odette when they practiced with one another. </p><p>Lucas had always been on the shorter side, and was thus relegated to the role of Odette. It hadn\u2019t bothered him at the time, laughing giddily as Eliott attempted to pick him up and spin him around, but now those memories felt like a punch in the gut. </p><p>Another clap brought his mind back to the present. He realized Madame Rigaux had finished speaking, as everyone was now scrambling for their preferred barre spots. Eliott and Manon were at the front of each of their respective barre\u2019s, of course, the spots left open for them despite the fact that Eliott moved there leisurely, allowing time for anyone to take the front spot if they wanted it. </p><p>Lucas realized that his usual spot beside Yann had been taken by Arthur, and there was now only one available spot in front of Imane. Fuck. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t like Imane, she was great, but she was also intimidating as hell. He wasn\u2019t even sure if she\u2019d allow him to stand by her, even if it was the only spot left. </p><p>As anticipated, she frowned as he approached. \u201cIt\u2019s the only spot left,\u201d he said by way of explanation. </p><p>\u201cIs it so bad to have to stand by me at the barre?\u201d she asked in a falsely casual tone, flexing and pointing her feet aimlessly as she secured her hijab into place. </p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not, I just thought you wouldn\u2019t want to stand by <i>me</i>,\u201d he confessed, cheeks reddening as he spoke. Imane smirked and looked him up and down. \u201cBetter you than Arthur,\u201d she conceded, turning away from him. Lucas felt himself begin to smile in return, ducking his head so no one would notice as he rolled out his shoulders and placed his left hand on the barre, ready to begin class. </p><p>Madame Rigaux only watched Eliott as she began going over their warm up combination, even though everyone was marking the movements along with her. In her defense, it was hard not to watch him, as much as Lucas hated to admit it. The focus in his eyes was so intense that Lucas found himself taken aback. He never usually watched Eliott in class, but he always assumed that Eliott carried an air of nonchalance with him, strolling into class late, being the last to go across the floor, skipping extra practice sessions, but the intensity in his stare at that moment reminded Lucas of just how much Eliott had always loved dance when they were kids. How much he apparently still did. </p><p>Too late, Lucas realized he\u2019d been too busy watching Eliott to take in the combination himself. As Madame Rigaux moved to tell the piano accompanist what to play, Lucas turned to Imane with wide eyes. \u201cImane, what\u2019s the combination?\u201d he asked fervently.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows at him. \u201cYou weren\u2019t paying attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&ndash; I was trying to, but&ndash; Imane, please,\u201d he stammered, looking at Madame Rigaux out of the corner of his eyes. Imane sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. </p><p>\u201cSwitch places with me,\u201d she said. </p><p>He blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Switch places with me</i>,\u201d she repeated in a quiet hiss, pulling him behind her and stepping into his place. \u201cThis way you can follow me on the right side, and by the time we get to the left you should know it.\u201d</p><p>He could have kissed her. \u201cImane you\u2019re the greatest. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, just try to pay attention next time.\u201d She turned around so her back was facing him, but he caught the hint of a smile on her face before she was facing the opposite direction completely. He nodded in acknowledgement, even though she couldn\u2019t see him anymore. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>For the rest of class he made sure to pay extra attention to Madame Rigaux, memorizing the combinations so well that there was no way he\u2019d be lost like he was at the beginning of class. It was easy to do once he\u2019d retrained his brain to ignore Eliott completely. By the end, he even received a compliment on his grand jet\u00e9, something he\u2019d been working diligently at for years with no notice. It felt great, if he was being honest. Maybe he had a shot at Prince Siegfried after all.</p><p><b>Mardi 2:17</b></p><p>\u201cLu, you have to be Odette!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to. I want to be the Prince,\u201d Lucas whined, crossing his arms in front of him in a huff. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever have to?\u201d</p><p>Eliott nearly bounced as he shrugged, grin taking over his face. \u201cBecause I\u2019m taller than you. You can\u2019t lift me, and that\u2019s an essential part of partnering. If we\u2019re ever going to make it as dancers we\u2019re going to have to know how to partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be the girl when we <i>actually</i> partner, though,\u201d Lucas argued. </p><p>\u201cPlease, Lu. For me?\u201d Not the puppy dog eyes. Lucas\u2019 will crumbled around the puppy dog eyes. He could actually feel himself giving in to Eliott\u2019s request. Lucas sighed and held out his hands. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Eliott bounced up and down with excitement, grabbing Lucas\u2019 hands and pulling them both to the middle of Eliott\u2019s backyard. It would have been preferable to practice at their studio, but it was closed on Sundays, which annoyed them both endlessly. <i>\u201cJust wait until we\u2019re at school,\u201d Eliott always said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to dance together day and night, whenever we want!\u201d</i></p><p>Lucas had to admit that it sounded great. Not only extra time in a real dance studio, but also extra time goofing around and having fake turning and leaping competitions with his best friend in the world. They would spend ten whole years at the school together, and Lucas couldn\u2019t wait to start. He wondered who else they would meet there, if anyone would be better than Eliott. As far as Lucas was concerned, <i>no one</i> was better than Eliott. </p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Lucas said after he and Eliott had run through and failed a variety of different lifts. \u201cIf I\u2019m Odette does that mean I get to do the thirty-two fouettes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLu, you can barely do one fouette,\u201d Eliott laughed. Lucas smacked him on the shoulder. </p><p>\u201cOh, Mr. I-can-do-five-so-I\u2019m-so-fancy. I\u2019m just <i>saying</i>, technically I get the big turn section if I have to be Odette!\u201d Lucas smirked, raising one eyebrow as Eliott laughed softly, eyes resting on the grass beneath their feet. </p><p>He looked back up at Lucas. \u201cWell <i>technically,</i> that\u2019s Odile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re usually played by the same person!\u201d Lucas wasn\u2019t going to let up so easily. \u201cThat means I get to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Eliott pretended to consider, squinting his eyes for effect. \u201cOk. You win. Go, Odile, impress me with your fouettes and I\u2019ll see if you deserve a standing ovation.\u201d Eliott wiggled his eyebrows. </p><p>Lucas licked his bottom lip and laughed. \u201cWell I\u2019m not going to do them <i>right now.</i> First of all, we\u2019re not even in a dance studio, second of all, like you said, I can barely do <i>one</i> fouette, much less thirty-two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just said you wanted to do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but not now. When I\u2019m older and able to do more than one fouette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old?\u201d</p><p>Lucas thought about it for a minute. \u201cSeventeen?\u201d</p><p>Eliott laughed and ruffled Lucas\u2019 hair. It was a thing he always did, never able to keep his hands out of Lucas\u2019 hair for more than ten minutes. \u201cWhy seventeen? That\u2019s so far away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be our last year of school.\u201d Lucas shrugged. \u201cSeems fitting. If we haven\u2019t performed Swan Lake by then, I\u2019ll need my chance to show off my impressive set of fouettes. We\u2019ll do our own performance of Swan Lake, just the two of us, but this time you\u2019ll be Odette because I\u2019ll definitely be taller than you by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that mean I get to do the fouettes?\u201d Eliott interjected, and Lucas cut him off with a glare. </p><p>\u201cNo. I get to be the Prince <i>and</i> do the fouettes. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat if I let you be the Prince now? Then, when we\u2019re seventeen, I\u2019ll be the Prince and you\u2019ll be Odette, and you can do all the fouettes your heart desires,\u201d Eliott offered. </p><p>Lucas narrowed his eyes at Eliott. \u201cIf we ever do an <i>actual</i> Swan Lake production, I\u2019m going to be the Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you wouldn\u2019t, this is just for our two-man Swan Lake show,\u201d Eliott amended, eyes crinkling at the sides as he smiled. \u201cEli and Lu! Two-man world ballet tour!\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed, nudging Eliott\u2019s shoulder with his. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one allowed to call me that, I don\u2019t want it on the name of our ballet show. <i>Lucas</i> is more professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one allowed to call me Eli,\u201d Eliott countered, \u201cOther than my mom, but we have to make some sacrifices if we want to be successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Elu? The Elu Two-Man World Ballet Tour!\u201d Lucas suggested, only half-joking. There was no way he was letting anyone call him Lu, or even know that there was someone he <i>did</i> allow to call him Lu. </p><p>\u201cElu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mix of our names. Eli and Lu, Elu.\u201d It was a bad idea. Eliott was going to hate it. </p><p>But Eliott just smiled. \u201cElu. I love it! Do we have a deal, then?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk, we have a deal,\u201d Lucas agreed, holding out his hand. Eliott shook it once before pressing a soft kiss to Lucas\u2019 knuckles, pulling him in and spinning him around. Lucas laughed as they ended up chest to chest. He wrapped his arms around Eliott\u2019s middle and furrowed his brows in concentration, trying to lift him up like the Prince would.</p><p>\u201cHa! See, I told you I could do it, Eli!\u201d Lucas shrieked in excitement, holding Eliott a few inches off the ground. It wasn\u2019t much, but he\u2019d <i>told</i> Eliott he could do it. And he could. </p><p>Eliott\u2019s voice rang out just as excited. \u201cI knew you could, Lu! I knew it!\u201d</p><p>Eliott\u2019s laughter faded as Lucas bolted up in bed, blinking away the memory that had occupied his dreams. The clock beside him said that it was a little while past two in the morning. Fucking fantastic. Not only was he being haunted by Eliott in real life, now he was being haunted by Eliott in his dreams. </p><p>He rubbed his eyes fervently as if that would erase his dream from his mind. Dreams like that happened every now and then, crawling out from the tightest corners of his brain and disrupting the Eliott-less peace he\u2019d grown accustomed to over the past eight or so years. The worst part about them wasn\u2019t that they attacked when he least expected it, no, the worst part about them was that, for one fleeting moment, he missed those times. He missed their easy friendship and the way they knew each other better than they knew themselves. It only lasted an instant, but it was enough for Lucas to hate that he still felt that way, even now. </p><p>He had Yann, he had Arthur, he had Manon, he didn\u2019t need to dwell on the past. That relationship had ended for a reason, no matter how much his mind tried to make him forget sometimes. Eliott\u2019s words from the dream repeated themselves in his head, <i>we have to make some sacrifices if we want to be successful. </i>Lucas snorted aloud, falling back onto his pillow. Eliott had been sure to take those words to heart. </p><p>Lucas focused on this as he fell back asleep, the fact that no matter the vows they\u2019d made and the lives they\u2019d promised to live together, in the end Lucas was just an obstacle to Eliott\u2019s success. Lucas liked to think that he would have done the same if his and Eliott\u2019s roles were reversed, but he knew he wouldn\u2019t have, even if there was the promise of a principal role in the company waiting on the other side. He didn\u2019t know if that made him loyal, weak, or stupid.</p><p>Maybe he was just a combination of the three.</p>",

He almost forgot that on the other side of the wall slept one of the people he hated most in the world. Well, maybe hate was a bit strong, but other than his father, who he really hated, he hadn\u2019t had many reasons to dislike other people throughout the years, especially in his ballet program. For the most part, they were all like one big family, which was one of Lucas\u2019 favorite parts about attending school there. </p><p>His alarm went off again and he swore under his breath, jolting out of bed and pulling on his layers of dance attire and warm up clothes as quickly as possible. He wanted to have time for a five mile run if possible before meeting Manon to stretch and warm up before class. </p><p>Throwing on his light windbreaker and grabbing his headphones off his desk, he moved to the bathroom, washing his face, using the toilet, brushing his teeth, and fixing his hair enough that it wouldn\u2019t get in his way when he had to dance later. In retrospect, he probably should have gotten a haircut before the year started, he hadn\u2019t had it so long in quite a while, but over the holidays he\u2019d really grown to love his hair a bit longer. Besides, if Eliott could dance with his wild, untameable hair, Lucas could too. </p><p>A bit after he\u2019d moved into the kitchen, the sound of Eliott\u2019s door opening caused Lucas to look up with wide eyes from where he was filling up his water bottle at the sink . Fuck, he should have been quieter. What the hell was Eliott doing up at five thirty anyway? He always arrived <i>just in time</i> for classes, but none of the instructors ever said a damn thing. It was infuriating, especially since Lucas was always one of the first people there.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Eliott said, sitting down at the counter. Lucas raised his eyebrows and continued to fill up his water. \u201cWhat are you doing up so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same question,\u201d Lucas murmured, already breaking the silent rule he\u2019d made for himself to just ignore Eliott at all costs. </p><p>Eliott shrugged and rested his elbows on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s performance year. I figure we all need to work a little bit harder, especially if we want a lead role in the show.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shut off the sink abruptly, hands clenching around his bottle. If Eliott had awoken early just to try to psych Lucas out, he was shit out of luck. Lucas wasn\u2019t going to let a few taunts psych him out this year. Eliott continued, \u201cAre you going for a run? I could join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas lied swiftly, \u201cI\u2019m meeting with Manon to warm up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit <i>too</i> early for that though, right?\u201d Eliott ticked his head to the side, smirking out of the corner of his mouth. </p><p>Lucas rolled his eyes and braced his hands on the counter. \u201cWhat do you want, Eliott?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d Eliott raised his hands in mock surrender. \u201cYou\u2019re going to eat before you go though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you my mother?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you avoiding my question?\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed in exasperation and took an apple from a bowl labelled <i>Eliott</i>. He took a bite and looked Eliott directly in the eye. \u201cThere. Happy?\u201d </p><p>Much to his displeasure, Eliott\u2019s smirk grew into a full blown grin. \u201cVery much so, yes.\u201d</p><p>Resisting the urge to spit the apple in Eliott\u2019s face, Lucas retreated back to his room to grab his dance bag and put on his tennis shoes in silence, ignoring how Eliott\u2019s eyes followed him the entire way. He continued ignoring the stare as he made his way back across the living room and out the door. The moment before it slammed shut behind him, Lucas heard Eliott\u2019s voice call out, \u201cEnjoy your run!\u201d</p><p>Grunting at the fact that his day had already been ruined, Lucas secured his headphones over his ears and blasted his music as loud as it would go, the sounds of Queen filling his head as he tried to clear his mind and ran, ran, ran.</p><p>Sometimes he found his footsteps matching the beat of the music and had to resist the urge to stop and dance right in the middle of the street. It was his curse, he supposed, to want to find a way to dance to every song he heard. Not that he was much of a choreographer. He could do fairly well during improv classes or when he\u2019d had to alter a variation for an assignment once, but creating something for a whole cast of moving bodies was dream he\u2019d long abandoned. </p><p>Lucas had always known that there would come a time when his ballet career expired and he would be thrown out like expired milk, but there had been a small part of him that had hoped he\u2019d be able to stay in that world, creating movement for others. Unfortunately, that was just a pipe dream. He didn\u2019t have what it took to be a choreographer.</p><p>A wet drop on his cheek sprung him out of his thoughts, bringing him back to the streets of Paris as he ran, steady drips of rain now falling from the sky. First the conversation with Eliott, now the rain\u2026 was it too much to ask for that his first day back went well?</p><p>Ignoring the rain about as well as he\u2019d ignored Eliott, Lucas pushed on, running faster than usual to complete the five miles he\u2019d wanted to complete before heading back inside. Maybe it all would have been ok, maybe Lucas could have gotten over the fact that it was raining, if not for the puddle he didn\u2019t notice on the side of the street. The puddle that he ran right past as a car drove right through it. The puddle that soaked the entire right half of his body, mere feet away from returning to the school. </p><p>It was going to be a long day. </p><p><b>Lundi 7:26</b></p><p>By the time Lucas had dried himself off well enough to not look like he\u2019d arrived from the lost city of Atlantis, he and Manon had only had about a half hour to warm up together before class started. They\u2019d spent most of the time talking about nothing anyway, partially him complaining about Eliott, partially her complaining about having to share a bathroom with Daphn\u00e9, not doing much to actually warm up. It didn\u2019t matter that much on the first day though, especially for the final year. That morning they were going to receive all the information about the winter show each group of students in their last year performed at the end of the fall semester. </p><p>Nearly everyone had arrived to class about fifteen minutes before eight, when the class was supposed to start. They were all fidgeting with excitement and nerves, chatting amongst themselves about what the show might be. The year before had done the Nutcracker, and Lucille, the stand out of that year\u2013 and Eliott\u2019s ex-girlfriend\u2013 had played the Snow Queen, dancing the solo so beautifully that Lucas was sure the school would never do the Nutcracker again, not wanting to mar her legacy. Manon had actually played Clara, as one student in their second to last year was allowed to audition for a role in the show each year. Lucas had been so glad it was her and not Eliott. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Eliott had yet to show up. Why the hell would he be waking up so early if he hadn\u2019t planned to show up to class on time? It made no sense to Lucas, though he supposed the reason could have simply been because he knew Lucas would be getting up earlier and wanted to be awake to rile him up. </p><p>At a minute before eight, Eliott sauntered into the room casually, meeting Sofiane\u2019s eyes immediately and moving to sit next to him, picking up a conversation as if he\u2019d been there the entire time. Lucas rolled his eyes as he watched them, he had no idea how Sofiane put up with Eliott. </p><p>There was a loud clap and everyone sat up straight immediately, jolting to attention as Madame Rigaux entered the classroom. Conversations stopped in an instant and all eyes were trained on her with a sharp, almost hungry focus. Madame Rigaux was a nightmare if she didn\u2019t like you, but her favorites always claimed she was one of the best instructors they\u2019d ever had. Lucas wasn\u2019t quite a favorite yet, but he hoped by the end of this year that he\u2019d get to experience more than the former, which he had grown accustomed to for quite some time. </p><p>\u201cGood morning, and welcome back.\u201d She spoke softly, but she knew everyone was hanging on to her every word. </p><p>\u201cGood morning Madame Rigaux,\u201d they all repeated in a chorus back to her. The corner of her mouth lifted in what one might have mistaken for a smile had they not known her. Those who did know her knew that look was born of satisfaction, of knowing the hold she had over all of them, knowing each and every one of their strengths and weaknesses and how to exploit them. It was a terrifying look. </p><p>\u201cFinal year. The time does fly, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Her question received no response, exactly as she\u2019d anticipated. \u201cThis year will be one of the most difficult perhaps in your entire career as a dancer. All the training you\u2019ve been doing up to this point is a walk in the park compared to what\u2019s in store for you this year.\u201d</p><p>Lucas unintentionally held his breath as she spoke, not wanting to cause any disturbance in the silence that had engulfed the room. It was so heavy, so deep, that each word she spoke rang out like a bell, echoing through the high ceilings. </p><p>\u201cNot only will you be continuing with your general education courses, studying in various styles and techniques of dance, some old and some new, and assisting with some of the younger classes, you will also be auditioning, rehearsing, and performing in this year\u2019s winter student production,\u201d she continued. As if they didn\u2019t all already know that, each of them barely resisting jumping up and begging her to tell them what they would be performing. </p><p>\u201cThe production, as you all know, was The Nutcracker last year.\u201d She was really going to milk it as long as she could, though Lucas couldn\u2019t say he was surprised. \u201cThis year, however, we wanted something a bit darker, more intense, with more depth from the characters to pull from. It will be both physically and emotionally demanding, and something that won\u2019t always make the audience believe in happy endings, something that will make the audience weep as they stand on their feet and applaud in awe.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Romeo and Juliet? The last class that had performed Romeo and Juliet was in their final year during Lucas\u2019 first year. It was definitely feasible, it had been quite a long time since then.</p><p>\u201cAuditions will begin next Friday, giving you almost two full weeks to prepare, a generous decision made by Monsieur Moreau, not me. If it were up to me you\u2019d begin auditions today, and we\u2019d see who has been keeping up their training during the holidays and who,\u201d she glanced pointedly at a few students, including Emma and Arthur, \u201chas some catching up to do. That all being said, I am pleased to announce that this year\u2019s winter production will be Swan Lake.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019 eyes found Eliott\u2019s instinctively. He looked away as quickly as he\u2019d looked in the first place, but not before he saw the same exact emotions he was feeling reflected in Eliott\u2019s eyes. Prince Siegfried had always been Lucas\u2019 dream role, since he\u2019d first seen the ballet as a child. It was one of the reasons his mother had enrolled him in ballet in the first place. Of course, Prince Siegfried was also Eliott\u2019s dream role, it was one of the things they had bonded over as children, arguing playfully about who got to be the Prince, and who played Odette when they practiced with one another. </p><p>Lucas had always been on the shorter side, and was thus relegated to the role of Odette. It hadn\u2019t bothered him at the time, laughing giddily as Eliott attempted to pick him up and spin him around, but now those memories felt like a punch in the gut. </p><p>Another clap brought his mind back to the present. He realized Madame Rigaux had finished speaking, as everyone was now scrambling for their preferred barre spots. Eliott and Manon were at the front of each of their respective barre\u2019s, of course, the spots left open for them despite the fact that Eliott moved there leisurely, allowing time for anyone to take the front spot if they wanted it. </p><p>Lucas realized that his usual spot beside Yann had been taken by Arthur, and there was now only one available spot in front of Imane. Fuck. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t like Imane, she was great, but she was also intimidating as hell. He wasn\u2019t even sure if she\u2019d allow him to stand by her, even if it was the only spot left. </p><p>As anticipated, she frowned as he approached. \u201cIt\u2019s the only spot left,\u201d he said by way of explanation. </p><p>\u201cIs it so bad to have to stand by me at the barre?\u201d she asked in a falsely casual tone, flexing and pointing her feet aimlessly as she secured her hijab into place. </p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not, I just thought you wouldn\u2019t want to stand by <i>me</i>,\u201d he confessed, cheeks reddening as he spoke. Imane smirked and looked him up and down. \u201cBetter you than Arthur,\u201d she conceded, turning away from him. Lucas felt himself begin to smile in return, ducking his head so no one would notice as he rolled out his shoulders and placed his left hand on the barre, ready to begin class. </p><p>Madame Rigaux only watched Eliott as she began going over their warm up combination, even though everyone was marking the movements along with her. In her defense, it was hard not to watch him, as much as Lucas hated to admit it. The focus in his eyes was so intense that Lucas found himself taken aback. He never usually watched Eliott in class, but he always assumed that Eliott carried an air of nonchalance with him, strolling into class late, being the last to go across the floor, skipping extra practice sessions, but the intensity in his stare at that moment reminded Lucas of just how much Eliott had always loved dance when they were kids. How much he apparently still did. </p><p>Too late, Lucas realized he\u2019d been too busy watching Eliott to take in the combination himself. As Madame Rigaux moved to tell the piano accompanist what to play, Lucas turned to Imane with wide eyes. \u201cImane, what\u2019s the combination?\u201d he asked fervently.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows at him. \u201cYou weren\u2019t paying attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2013 I was trying to, but\u2013 Imane, please,\u201d he stammered, looking at Madame Rigaux out of the corner of his eyes. Imane sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. </p><p>\u201cSwitch places with me,\u201d she said. </p><p>He blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Switch places with me</i>,\u201d she repeated in a quiet hiss, pulling him behind her and stepping into his place. \u201cThis way you can follow me on the right side, and by the time we get to the left you should know it.\u201d</p><p>He could have kissed her. \u201cImane you\u2019re the greatest. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, just try to pay attention next time.\u201d She turned around so her back was facing him, but he caught the hint of a smile on her face before she was facing the opposite direction completely. He nodded in acknowledgement, even though she couldn\u2019t see him anymore. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>For the rest of class he made sure to pay extra attention to Madame Rigaux, memorizing the combinations so well that there was no way he\u2019d be lost like he was at the beginning of class. It was easy to do once he\u2019d retrained his brain to ignore Eliott completely. By the end, he even received a compliment on his grand jet\u00e9, something he\u2019d been working diligently at for years with no notice. It felt great, if he was being honest. Maybe he had a shot at Prince Siegfried after all.</p><p><b>Mardi 2:17</b></p><p>\u201cLu, you have to be Odette!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to. I want to be the Prince,\u201d Lucas whined, crossing his arms in front of him in a huff. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever have to?\u201d</p><p>Eliott nearly bounced as he shrugged, grin taking over his face. \u201cBecause I\u2019m taller than you. You can\u2019t lift me, and that\u2019s an essential part of partnering. If we\u2019re ever going to make it as dancers we\u2019re going to have to know how to partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be the girl when we <i>actually</i> partner, though,\u201d Lucas argued. </p><p>\u201cPlease, Lu. For me?\u201d Not the puppy dog eyes. Lucas\u2019 will crumbled around the puppy dog eyes. He could actually feel himself giving in to Eliott\u2019s request. Lucas sighed and held out his hands. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Eliott bounced up and down with excitement, grabbing Lucas\u2019 hands and pulling them both to the middle of Eliott\u2019s backyard. It would have been preferable to practice at their studio, but it was closed on Sundays, which annoyed them both endlessly. <i>\u201cJust wait until we\u2019re at school,\u201d Eliott always said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to dance together day and night, whenever we want!\u201d</i></p><p>Lucas had to admit that it sounded great. Not only extra time in a real dance studio, but also extra time goofing around and having fake turning and leaping competitions with his best friend in the world. They would spend ten whole years at the school together, and Lucas couldn\u2019t wait to start. He wondered who else they would meet there, if anyone would be better than Eliott. As far as Lucas was concerned, <i>no one</i> was better than Eliott. </p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Lucas said after he and Eliott had run through and failed a variety of different lifts. \u201cIf I\u2019m Odette does that mean I get to do the thirty-two fouettes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLu, you can barely do one fouette,\u201d Eliott laughed. Lucas smacked him on the shoulder. </p><p>\u201cOh, Mr. I-can-do-five-so-I\u2019m-so-fancy. I\u2019m just <i>saying</i>, technically I get the big turn section if I have to be Odette!\u201d Lucas smirked, raising one eyebrow as Eliott laughed softly, eyes resting on the grass beneath their feet. </p><p>He looked back up at Lucas. \u201cWell <i>technically,</i> that\u2019s Odile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re usually played by the same person!\u201d Lucas wasn\u2019t going to let up so easily. \u201cThat means I get to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Eliott pretended to consider, squinting his eyes for effect. \u201cOk. You win. Go, Odile, impress me with your fouettes and I\u2019ll see if you deserve a standing ovation.\u201d Eliott wiggled his eyebrows. </p><p>Lucas licked his bottom lip and laughed. \u201cWell I\u2019m not going to do them <i>right now.</i> First of all, we\u2019re not even in a dance studio, second of all, like you said, I can barely do <i>one</i> fouette, much less thirty-two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just said you wanted to do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but not now. When I\u2019m older and able to do more than one fouette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old?\u201d</p><p>Lucas thought about it for a minute. \u201cSeventeen?\u201d</p><p>Eliott laughed and ruffled Lucas\u2019 hair. It was a thing he always did, never able to keep his hands out of Lucas\u2019 hair for more than ten minutes. \u201cWhy seventeen? That\u2019s so far away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be our last year of school.\u201d Lucas shrugged. \u201cSeems fitting. If we haven\u2019t performed Swan Lake by then, I\u2019ll need my chance to show off my impressive set of fouettes. We\u2019ll do our own performance of Swan Lake, just the two of us, but this time you\u2019ll be Odette because I\u2019ll definitely be taller than you by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that mean I get to do the fouettes?\u201d Eliott interjected, and Lucas cut him off with a glare. </p><p>\u201cNo. I get to be the Prince <i>and</i> do the fouettes. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat if I let you be the Prince now? Then, when we\u2019re seventeen, I\u2019ll be the Prince and you\u2019ll be Odette, and you can do all the fouettes your heart desires,\u201d Eliott offered. </p><p>Lucas narrowed his eyes at Eliott. \u201cIf we ever do an <i>actual</i> Swan Lake production, I\u2019m going to be the Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you wouldn\u2019t, this is just for our two-man Swan Lake show,\u201d Eliott amended, eyes crinkling at the sides as he smiled. \u201cEli and Lu! Two-man world ballet tour!\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed, nudging Eliott\u2019s shoulder with his. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one allowed to call me that, I don\u2019t want it on the name of our ballet show. <i>Lucas</i> is more professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one allowed to call me Eli,\u201d Eliott countered, \u201cOther than my mom, but we have to make some sacrifices if we want to be successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Elu? The Elu Two-Man World Ballet Tour!\u201d Lucas suggested, only half-joking. There was no way he was letting anyone call him Lu, or even know that there was someone he <i>did</i> allow to call him Lu. </p><p>\u201cElu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mix of our names. Eli and Lu, Elu.\u201d It was a bad idea. Eliott was going to hate it. </p><p>But Eliott just smiled. \u201cElu. I love it! Do we have a deal, then?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk, we have a deal,\u201d Lucas agreed, holding out his hand. Eliott shook it once before pressing a soft kiss to Lucas\u2019 knuckles, pulling him in and spinning him around. Lucas laughed as they ended up chest to chest. He wrapped his arms around Eliott\u2019s middle and furrowed his brows in concentration, trying to lift him up like the Prince would.</p><p>\u201cHa! See, I told you I could do it, Eli!\u201d Lucas shrieked in excitement, holding Eliott a few inches off the ground. It wasn\u2019t much, but he\u2019d <i>told</i> Eliott he could do it. And he could. </p><p>Eliott\u2019s voice rang out just as excited. \u201cI knew you could, Lu! I knew it!\u201d</p><p>Eliott\u2019s laughter faded as Lucas bolted up in bed, blinking away the memory that had occupied his dreams. The clock beside him said that it was a little while past two in the morning. Fucking fantastic. Not only was he being haunted by Eliott in real life, now he was being haunted by Eliott in his dreams. </p><p>He rubbed his eyes fervently as if that would erase his dream from his mind. Dreams like that happened every now and then, crawling out from the tightest corners of his brain and disrupting the Eliott-less peace he\u2019d grown accustomed to over the past eight or so years. The worst part about them wasn\u2019t that they attacked when he least expected it, no, the worst part about them was that, for one fleeting moment, he missed those times. He missed their easy friendship and the way they knew each other better than they knew themselves. It only lasted an instant, but it was enough for Lucas to hate that he still felt that way, even now. </p><p>He had Yann, he had Arthur, he had Manon, he didn\u2019t need to dwell on the past. That relationship had ended for a reason, no matter how much his mind tried to make him forget sometimes. Eliott\u2019s words from the dream repeated themselves in his head, <i>we have to make some sacrifices if we want to be successful. </i>Lucas snorted aloud, falling back onto his pillow. Eliott had been sure to take those words to heart. </p><p>Lucas focused on this as he fell back asleep, the fact that no matter the vows they\u2019d made and the lives they\u2019d promised to live together, in the end Lucas was just an obstacle to Eliott\u2019s success. Lucas liked to think that he would have done the same if his and Eliott\u2019s roles were reversed, but he knew he wouldn\u2019t have, even if there was the promise of a principal role in the company waiting on the other side. He didn\u2019t know if that made him loyal, weak, or stupid.</p><p>Maybe he was just a combination of the three.</p></p>",

He almost forgot that on the other side of the wall slept one of the people he hated most in the world. Well, maybe hate was a bit strong, but other than his father, who he really hated, he hadn\u2019t had many reasons to dislike other people throughout the years, especially in his ballet program. For the most part, they were all like one big family, which was one of Lucas\u2019 favorite parts about attending school there. </p><p>His alarm went off again and he swore under his breath, jolting out of bed and pulling on his layers of dance attire and warm up clothes as quickly as possible. He wanted to have time for a five mile run if possible before meeting Manon to stretch and warm up before class. </p><p>Throwing on his light windbreaker and grabbing his headphones off his desk, he moved to the bathroom, washing his face, using the toilet, brushing his teeth, and fixing his hair enough that it wouldn\u2019t get in his way when he had to dance later. In retrospect, he probably should have gotten a haircut before the year started, he hadn\u2019t had it so long in quite a while, but over the holidays he\u2019d really grown to love his hair a bit longer. Besides, if Eliott could dance with his wild, untameable hair, Lucas could too. </p><p>A bit after he\u2019d moved into the kitchen, the sound of Eliott\u2019s door opening caused Lucas to look up with wide eyes from where he was filling up his water bottle at the sink . Fuck, he should have been quieter. What the hell was Eliott doing up at five thirty anyway? He always arrived <i>just in time</i> for classes, but none of the instructors ever said a damn thing. It was infuriating, especially since Lucas was always one of the first people there.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Eliott said, sitting down at the counter. Lucas raised his eyebrows and continued to fill up his water. \u201cWhat are you doing up so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same question,\u201d Lucas murmured, already breaking the silent rule he\u2019d made for himself to just ignore Eliott at all costs. </p><p>Eliott shrugged and rested his elbows on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s performance year. I figure we all need to work a little bit harder, especially if we want a lead role in the show.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shut off the sink abruptly, hands clenching around his bottle. If Eliott had awoken early just to try to psych Lucas out, he was shit out of luck. Lucas wasn\u2019t going to let a few taunts psych him out this year. Eliott continued, \u201cAre you going for a run? I could join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas lied swiftly, \u201cI\u2019m meeting with Manon to warm up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit <i>too</i> early for that though, right?\u201d Eliott ticked his head to the side, smirking out of the corner of his mouth. </p><p>Lucas rolled his eyes and braced his hands on the counter. \u201cWhat do you want, Eliott?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d Eliott raised his hands in mock surrender. \u201cYou\u2019re going to eat before you go though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you my mother?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you avoiding my question?\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed in exasperation and took an apple from a bowl labelled <i>Eliott</i>. He took a bite and looked Eliott directly in the eye. \u201cThere. Happy?\u201d </p><p>Much to his displeasure, Eliott\u2019s smirk grew into a full blown grin. \u201cVery much so, yes.\u201d</p><p>Resisting the urge to spit the apple in Eliott\u2019s face, Lucas retreated back to his room to grab his dance bag and put on his tennis shoes in silence, ignoring how Eliott\u2019s eyes followed him the entire way. He continued ignoring the stare as he made his way back across the living room and out the door. The moment before it slammed shut behind him, Lucas heard Eliott\u2019s voice call out, \u201cEnjoy your run!\u201d</p><p>Grunting at the fact that his day had already been ruined, Lucas secured his headphones over his ears and blasted his music as loud as it would go, the sounds of Queen filling his head as he tried to clear his mind and ran, ran, ran.</p><p>Sometimes he found his footsteps matching the beat of the music and had to resist the urge to stop and dance right in the middle of the street. It was his curse, he supposed, to want to find a way to dance to every song he heard. Not that he was much of a choreographer. He could do fairly well during improv classes or when he\u2019d had to alter a variation for an assignment once, but creating something for a whole cast of moving bodies was dream he\u2019d long abandoned. </p><p>Lucas had always known that there would come a time when his ballet career expired and he would be thrown out like expired milk, but there had been a small part of him that had hoped he\u2019d be able to stay in that world, creating movement for others. Unfortunately, that was just a pipe dream. He didn\u2019t have what it took to be a choreographer.</p><p>A wet drop on his cheek sprung him out of his thoughts, bringing him back to the streets of Paris as he ran, steady drips of rain now falling from the sky. First the conversation with Eliott, now the rain\u2026 was it too much to ask for that his first day back went well?</p><p>Ignoring the rain about as well as he\u2019d ignored Eliott, Lucas pushed on, running faster than usual to complete the five miles he\u2019d wanted to complete before heading back inside. Maybe it all would have been ok, maybe Lucas could have gotten over the fact that it was raining, if not for the puddle he didn\u2019t notice on the side of the street. The puddle that he ran right past as a car drove right through it. The puddle that soaked the entire right half of his body, mere feet away from returning to the school. </p><p>It was going to be a long day. </p><p><b>Lundi 7:26</b></p><p>By the time Lucas had dried himself off well enough to not look like he\u2019d arrived from the lost city of Atlantis, he and Manon had only had about a half hour to warm up together before class started. They\u2019d spent most of the time talking about nothing anyway, partially him complaining about Eliott, partially her complaining about having to share a bathroom with Daphn\u00e9, not doing much to actually warm up. It didn\u2019t matter that much on the first day though, especially for the final year. That morning they were going to receive all the information about the winter show each group of students in their last year performed at the end of the fall semester. </p><p>Nearly everyone had arrived to class about fifteen minutes before eight, when the class was supposed to start. They were all fidgeting with excitement and nerves, chatting amongst themselves about what the show might be. The year before had done the Nutcracker, and Lucille, the stand out of that year\u2013 and Eliott\u2019s ex-girlfriend\u2013 had played the Snow Queen, dancing the solo so beautifully that Lucas was sure the school would never do the Nutcracker again, not wanting to mar her legacy. Manon had actually played Clara, as one student in their second to last year was allowed to audition for a role in the show each year. Lucas had been so glad it was her and not Eliott. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Eliott had yet to show up. Why the hell would he be waking up so early if he hadn\u2019t planned to show up to class on time? It made no sense to Lucas, though he supposed the reason could have simply been because he knew Lucas would be getting up earlier and wanted to be awake to rile him up. </p><p>At a minute before eight, Eliott sauntered into the room casually, meeting Sofiane\u2019s eyes immediately and moving to sit next to him, picking up a conversation as if he\u2019d been there the entire time. Lucas rolled his eyes as he watched them, he had no idea how Sofiane put up with Eliott. </p><p>There was a loud clap and everyone sat up straight immediately, jolting to attention as Madame Rigaux entered the classroom. Conversations stopped in an instant and all eyes were trained on her with a sharp, almost hungry focus. Madame Rigaux was a nightmare if she didn\u2019t like you, but her favorites always claimed she was one of the best instructors they\u2019d ever had. Lucas wasn\u2019t quite a favorite yet, but he hoped by the end of this year that he\u2019d get to experience more than the former, which he had grown accustomed to for quite some time. </p><p>\u201cGood morning, and welcome back.\u201d She spoke softly, but she knew everyone was hanging on to her every word. </p><p>\u201cGood morning Madame Rigaux,\u201d they all repeated in a chorus back to her. The corner of her mouth lifted in what one might have mistaken for a smile had they not known her. Those who did know her knew that look was born of satisfaction, of knowing the hold she had over all of them, knowing each and every one of their strengths and weaknesses and how to exploit them. It was a terrifying look. </p><p>\u201cFinal year. The time does fly, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Her question received no response, exactly as she\u2019d anticipated. \u201cThis year will be one of the most difficult perhaps in your entire career as a dancer. All the training you\u2019ve been doing up to this point is a walk in the park compared to what\u2019s in store for you this year.\u201d</p><p>Lucas unintentionally held his breath as she spoke, not wanting to cause any disturbance in the silence that had engulfed the room. It was so heavy, so deep, that each word she spoke rang out like a bell, echoing through the high ceilings. </p><p>\u201cNot only will you be continuing with your general education courses, studying in various styles and techniques of dance, some old and some new, and assisting with some of the younger classes, you will also be auditioning, rehearsing, and performing in this year\u2019s winter student production,\u201d she continued. As if they didn\u2019t all already know that, each of them barely resisting jumping up and begging her to tell them what they would be performing. </p><p>\u201cThe production, as you all know, was The Nutcracker last year.\u201d She was really going to milk it as long as she could, though Lucas couldn\u2019t say he was surprised. \u201cThis year, however, we wanted something a bit darker, more intense, with more depth from the characters to pull from. It will be both physically and emotionally demanding, and something that won\u2019t always make the audience believe in happy endings, something that will make the audience weep as they stand on their feet and applaud in awe.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Romeo and Juliet? The last class that had performed Romeo and Juliet was in their final year during Lucas\u2019 first year. It was definitely feasible, it had been quite a long time since then.</p><p>\u201cAuditions will begin next Friday, giving you almost two full weeks to prepare, a generous decision made by Monsieur Moreau, not me. If it were up to me you\u2019d begin auditions today, and we\u2019d see who has been keeping up their training during the holidays and who,\u201d she glanced pointedly at a few students, including Emma and Arthur, \u201chas some catching up to do. That all being said, I am pleased to announce that this year\u2019s winter production will be Swan Lake.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019 eyes found Eliott\u2019s instinctively. He looked away as quickly as he\u2019d looked in the first place, but not before he saw the same exact emotions he was feeling reflected in Eliott\u2019s eyes. Prince Siegfried had always been Lucas\u2019 dream role, since he\u2019d first seen the ballet as a child. It was one of the reasons his mother had enrolled him in ballet in the first place. Of course, Prince Siegfried was also Eliott\u2019s dream role, it was one of the things they had bonded over as children, arguing playfully about who got to be the Prince, and who played Odette when they practiced with one another. </p><p>Lucas had always been on the shorter side, and was thus relegated to the role of Odette. It hadn\u2019t bothered him at the time, laughing giddily as Eliott attempted to pick him up and spin him around, but now those memories felt like a punch in the gut. </p><p>Another clap brought his mind back to the present. He realized Madame Rigaux had finished speaking, as everyone was now scrambling for their preferred barre spots. Eliott and Manon were at the front of each of their respective barre\u2019s, of course, the spots left open for them despite the fact that Eliott moved there leisurely, allowing time for anyone to take the front spot if they wanted it. </p><p>Lucas realized that his usual spot beside Yann had been taken by Arthur, and there was now only one available spot in front of Imane. Fuck. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t like Imane, she was great, but she was also intimidating as hell. He wasn\u2019t even sure if she\u2019d allow him to stand by her, even if it was the only spot left. </p><p>As anticipated, she frowned as he approached. \u201cIt\u2019s the only spot left,\u201d he said by way of explanation. </p><p>\u201cIs it so bad to have to stand by me at the barre?\u201d she asked in a falsely casual tone, flexing and pointing her feet aimlessly as she secured her hijab into place. </p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not, I just thought you wouldn\u2019t want to stand by <i>me</i>,\u201d he confessed, cheeks reddening as he spoke. Imane smirked and looked him up and down. \u201cBetter you than Arthur,\u201d she conceded, turning away from him. Lucas felt himself begin to smile in return, ducking his head so no one would notice as he rolled out his shoulders and placed his left hand on the barre, ready to begin class. </p><p>Madame Rigaux only watched Eliott as she began going over their warm up combination, even though everyone was marking the movements along with her. In her defense, it was hard not to watch him, as much as Lucas hated to admit it. The focus in his eyes was so intense that Lucas found himself taken aback. He never usually watched Eliott in class, but he always assumed that Eliott carried an air of nonchalance with him, strolling into class late, being the last to go across the floor, skipping extra practice sessions, but the intensity in his stare at that moment reminded Lucas of just how much Eliott had always loved dance when they were kids. How much he apparently still did. </p><p>Too late, Lucas realized he\u2019d been too busy watching Eliott to take in the combination himself. As Madame Rigaux moved to tell the piano accompanist what to play, Lucas turned to Imane with wide eyes. \u201cImane, what\u2019s the combination?\u201d he asked fervently.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows at him. \u201cYou weren\u2019t paying attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2013 I was trying to, but\u2013 Imane, please,\u201d he stammered, looking at Madame Rigaux out of the corner of his eyes. Imane sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. </p><p>\u201cSwitch places with me,\u201d she said. </p><p>He blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Switch places with me</i>,\u201d she repeated in a quiet hiss, pulling him behind her and stepping into his place. \u201cThis way you can follow me on the right side, and by the time we get to the left you should know it.\u201d</p><p>He could have kissed her. \u201cImane you\u2019re the greatest. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, just try to pay attention next time.\u201d She turned around so her back was facing him, but he caught the hint of a smile on her face before she was facing the opposite direction completely. He nodded in acknowledgement, even though she couldn\u2019t see him anymore. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>For the rest of class he made sure to pay extra attention to Madame Rigaux, memorizing the combinations so well that there was no way he\u2019d be lost like he was at the beginning of class. It was easy to do once he\u2019d retrained his brain to ignore Eliott completely. By the end, he even received a compliment on his grand jet\u00e9, something he\u2019d been working diligently at for years with no notice. It felt great, if he was being honest. Maybe he had a shot at Prince Siegfried after all.</p><p><b>Mardi 2:17</b></p><p>\u201cLu, you have to be Odette!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to. I want to be the Prince,\u201d Lucas whined, crossing his arms in front of him in a huff. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever have to?\u201d</p><p>Eliott nearly bounced as he shrugged, grin taking over his face. \u201cBecause I\u2019m taller than you. You can\u2019t lift me, and that\u2019s an essential part of partnering. If we\u2019re ever going to make it as dancers we\u2019re going to have to know how to partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be the girl when we <i>actually</i> partner, though,\u201d Lucas argued. </p><p>\u201cPlease, Lu. For me?\u201d Not the puppy dog eyes. Lucas\u2019 will crumbled around the puppy dog eyes. He could actually feel himself giving in to Eliott\u2019s request. Lucas sighed and held out his hands. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Eliott bounced up and down with excitement, grabbing Lucas\u2019 hands and pulling them both to the middle of Eliott\u2019s backyard. It would have been preferable to practice at their studio, but it was closed on Sundays, which annoyed them both endlessly. <i>\u201cJust wait until we\u2019re at school,\u201d Eliott always said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to dance together day and night, whenever we want!\u201d</i></p><p>Lucas had to admit that it sounded great. Not only extra time in a real dance studio, but also extra time goofing around and having fake turning and leaping competitions with his best friend in the world. They would spend ten whole years at the school together, and Lucas couldn\u2019t wait to start. He wondered who else they would meet there, if anyone would be better than Eliott. As far as Lucas was concerned, <i>no one</i> was better than Eliott. </p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Lucas said after he and Eliott had run through and failed a variety of different lifts. \u201cIf I\u2019m Odette does that mean I get to do the thirty-two fouettes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLu, you can barely do one fouette,\u201d Eliott laughed. Lucas smacked him on the shoulder. </p><p>\u201cOh, Mr. I-can-do-five-so-I\u2019m-so-fancy. I\u2019m just <i>saying</i>, technically I get the big turn section if I have to be Odette!\u201d Lucas smirked, raising one eyebrow as Eliott laughed softly, eyes resting on the grass beneath their feet. </p><p>He looked back up at Lucas. \u201cWell <i>technically,</i> that\u2019s Odile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re usually played by the same person!\u201d Lucas wasn\u2019t going to let up so easily. \u201cThat means I get to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Eliott pretended to consider, squinting his eyes for effect. \u201cOk. You win. Go, Odile, impress me with your fouettes and I\u2019ll see if you deserve a standing ovation.\u201d Eliott wiggled his eyebrows. </p><p>Lucas licked his bottom lip and laughed. \u201cWell I\u2019m not going to do them <i>right now.</i> First of all, we\u2019re not even in a dance studio, second of all, like you said, I can barely do <i>one</i> fouette, much less thirty-two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just said you wanted to do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but not now. When I\u2019m older and able to do more than one fouette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old?\u201d</p><p>Lucas thought about it for a minute. \u201cSeventeen?\u201d</p><p>Eliott laughed and ruffled Lucas\u2019 hair. It was a thing he always did, never able to keep his hands out of Lucas\u2019 hair for more than ten minutes. \u201cWhy seventeen? That\u2019s so far away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be our last year of school.\u201d Lucas shrugged. \u201cSeems fitting. If we haven\u2019t performed Swan Lake by then, I\u2019ll need my chance to show off my impressive set of fouettes. We\u2019ll do our own performance of Swan Lake, just the two of us, but this time you\u2019ll be Odette because I\u2019ll definitely be taller than you by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that mean I get to do the fouettes?\u201d Eliott interjected, and Lucas cut him off with a glare. </p><p>\u201cNo. I get to be the Prince <i>and</i> do the fouettes. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat if I let you be the Prince now? Then, when we\u2019re seventeen, I\u2019ll be the Prince and you\u2019ll be Odette, and you can do all the fouettes your heart desires,\u201d Eliott offered. </p><p>Lucas narrowed his eyes at Eliott. \u201cIf we ever do an <i>actual</i> Swan Lake production, I\u2019m going to be the Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you wouldn\u2019t, this is just for our two-man Swan Lake show,\u201d Eliott amended, eyes crinkling at the sides as he smiled. \u201cEli and Lu! Two-man world ballet tour!\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed, nudging Eliott\u2019s shoulder with his. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one allowed to call me that, I don\u2019t want it on the name of our ballet show. <i>Lucas</i> is more professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one allowed to call me Eli,\u201d Eliott countered, \u201cOther than my mom, but we have to make some sacrifices if we want to be successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Elu? The Elu Two-Man World Ballet Tour!\u201d Lucas suggested, only half-joking. There was no way he was letting anyone call him Lu, or even know that there was someone he <i>did</i> allow to call him Lu. </p><p>\u201cElu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mix of our names. Eli and Lu, Elu.\u201d It was a bad idea. Eliott was going to hate it. </p><p>But Eliott just smiled. \u201cElu. I love it! Do we have a deal, then?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk, we have a deal,\u201d Lucas agreed, holding out his hand. Eliott shook it once before pressing a soft kiss to Lucas\u2019 knuckles, pulling him in and spinning him around. Lucas laughed as they ended up chest to chest. He wrapped his arms around Eliott\u2019s middle and furrowed his brows in concentration, trying to lift him up like the Prince would.</p><p>\u201cHa! See, I told you I could do it, Eli!\u201d Lucas shrieked in excitement, holding Eliott a few inches off the ground. It wasn\u2019t much, but he\u2019d <i>told</i> Eliott he could do it. And he could. </p><p>Eliott\u2019s voice rang out just as excited. \u201cI knew you could, Lu! I knew it!\u201d</p><p>Eliott\u2019s laughter faded as Lucas bolted up in bed, blinking away the memory that had occupied his dreams. The clock beside him said that it was a little while past two in the morning. Fucking fantastic. Not only was he being haunted by Eliott in real life, now he was being haunted by Eliott in his dreams. </p><p>He rubbed his eyes fervently as if that would erase his dream from his mind. Dreams like that happened every now and then, crawling out from the tightest corners of his brain and disrupting the Eliott-less peace he\u2019d grown accustomed to over the past eight or so years. The worst part about them wasn\u2019t that they attacked when he least expected it, no, the worst part about them was that, for one fleeting moment, he missed those times. He missed their easy friendship and the way they knew each other better than they knew themselves. It only lasted an instant, but it was enough for Lucas to hate that he still felt that way, even now. </p><p>He had Yann, he had Arthur, he had Manon, he didn\u2019t need to dwell on the past. That relationship had ended for a reason, no matter how much his mind tried to make him forget sometimes. Eliott\u2019s words from the dream repeated themselves in his head, <i>we have to make some sacrifices if we want to be successful. </i>Lucas snorted aloud, falling back onto his pillow. Eliott had been sure to take those words to heart. </p><p>Lucas focused on this as he fell back asleep, the fact that no matter the vows they\u2019d made and the lives they\u2019d promised to live together, in the end Lucas was just an obstacle to Eliott\u2019s success. Lucas liked to think that he would have done the same if his and Eliott\u2019s roles were reversed, but he knew he wouldn\u2019t have, even if there was the promise of a principal role in the company waiting on the other side. He didn\u2019t know if that made him loyal, weak, or stupid.</p><p>Maybe he was just a combination of the three.</p></p>",

He almost forgot that on the other side of the wall slept one of the people he hated most in the world. Well, maybe hate was a bit strong, but other than his father, who he really hated, he hadn&rsquo;t had many reasons to dislike other people throughout the years, especially in his ballet program. For the most part, they were all like one big family, which was one of Lucas&rsquo; favorite parts about attending school there. </p><p>His alarm went off again and he swore under his breath, jolting out of bed and pulling on his layers of dance attire and warm up clothes as quickly as possible. He wanted to have time for a five mile run if possible before meeting Manon to stretch and warm up before class. </p><p>Throwing on his light windbreaker and grabbing his headphones off his desk, he moved to the bathroom, washing his face, using the toilet, brushing his teeth, and fixing his hair enough that it wouldn&rsquo;t get in his way when he had to dance later. In retrospect, he probably should have gotten a haircut before the year started, he hadn&rsquo;t had it so long in quite a while, but over the holidays he&rsquo;d really grown to love his hair a bit longer. Besides, if Eliott could dance with his wild, untameable hair, Lucas could too. </p><p>A bit after he&rsquo;d moved into the kitchen, the sound of Eliott&rsquo;s door opening caused Lucas to look up with wide eyes from where he was filling up his water bottle at the sink . Fuck, he should have been quieter. What the hell was Eliott doing up at five thirty anyway? He always arrived <i>just in time</i> for classes, but none of the instructors ever said a damn thing. It was infuriating, especially since Lucas was always one of the first people there.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; Eliott said, sitting down at the counter. Lucas raised his eyebrows and continued to fill up his water. &ldquo;What are you doing up so early?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could ask you the same question,&rdquo; Lucas murmured, already breaking the silent rule he&rsquo;d made for himself to just ignore Eliott at all costs. </p><p>Eliott shrugged and rested his elbows on the table. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s performance year. I figure we all need to work a little bit harder, especially if we want a lead role in the show.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas shut off the sink abruptly, hands clenching around his bottle. If Eliott had awoken early just to try to psych Lucas out, he was shit out of luck. Lucas wasn&rsquo;t going to let a few taunts psych him out this year. Eliott continued, &ldquo;Are you going for a run? I could join you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lucas lied swiftly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m meeting with Manon to warm up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A bit <i>too</i> early for that though, right?&rdquo; Eliott ticked his head to the side, smirking out of the corner of his mouth. </p><p>Lucas rolled his eyes and braced his hands on the counter. &ldquo;What do you want, Eliott?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing.&rdquo; Eliott raised his hands in mock surrender. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to eat before you go though, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you my mother?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you avoiding my question?&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas sighed in exasperation and took an apple from a bowl labelled <i>Eliott</i>. He took a bite and looked Eliott directly in the eye. &ldquo;There. Happy?&rdquo; </p><p>Much to his displeasure, Eliott&rsquo;s smirk grew into a full blown grin. &ldquo;Very much so, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Resisting the urge to spit the apple in Eliott&rsquo;s face, Lucas retreated back to his room to grab his dance bag and put on his tennis shoes in silence, ignoring how Eliott&rsquo;s eyes followed him the entire way. He continued ignoring the stare as he made his way back across the living room and out the door. The moment before it slammed shut behind him, Lucas heard Eliott&rsquo;s voice call out, &ldquo;Enjoy your run!&rdquo;</p><p>Grunting at the fact that his day had already been ruined, Lucas secured his headphones over his ears and blasted his music as loud as it would go, the sounds of Queen filling his head as he tried to clear his mind and ran, ran, ran.</p><p>Sometimes he found his footsteps matching the beat of the music and had to resist the urge to stop and dance right in the middle of the street. It was his curse, he supposed, to want to find a way to dance to every song he heard. Not that he was much of a choreographer. He could do fairly well during improv classes or when he&rsquo;d had to alter a variation for an assignment once, but creating something for a whole cast of moving bodies was dream he&rsquo;d long abandoned. </p><p>Lucas had always known that there would come a time when his ballet career expired and he would be thrown out like expired milk, but there had been a small part of him that had hoped he&rsquo;d be able to stay in that world, creating movement for others. Unfortunately, that was just a pipe dream. He didn&rsquo;t have what it took to be a choreographer.</p><p>A wet drop on his cheek sprung him out of his thoughts, bringing him back to the streets of Paris as he ran, steady drips of rain now falling from the sky. First the conversation with Eliott, now the rain&hellip; was it too much to ask for that his first day back went well?</p><p>Ignoring the rain about as well as he&rsquo;d ignored Eliott, Lucas pushed on, running faster than usual to complete the five miles he&rsquo;d wanted to complete before heading back inside. Maybe it all would have been ok, maybe Lucas could have gotten over the fact that it was raining, if not for the puddle he didn&rsquo;t notice on the side of the street. The puddle that he ran right past as a car drove right through it. The puddle that soaked the entire right half of his body, mere feet away from returning to the school. </p><p>It was going to be a long day. </p><p><b>Lundi 7:26</b></p><p>By the time Lucas had dried himself off well enough to not look like he&rsquo;d arrived from the lost city of Atlantis, he and Manon had only had about a half hour to warm up together before class started. They&rsquo;d spent most of the time talking about nothing anyway, partially him complaining about Eliott, partially her complaining about having to share a bathroom with Daphn&eacute;, not doing much to actually warm up. It didn&rsquo;t matter that much on the first day though, especially for the final year. That morning they were going to receive all the information about the winter show each group of students in their last year performed at the end of the fall semester. </p><p>Nearly everyone had arrived to class about fifteen minutes before eight, when the class was supposed to start. They were all fidgeting with excitement and nerves, chatting amongst themselves about what the show might be. The year before had done the Nutcracker, and Lucille, the stand out of that year&ndash; and Eliott&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend&ndash; had played the Snow Queen, dancing the solo so beautifully that Lucas was sure the school would never do the Nutcracker again, not wanting to mar her legacy. Manon had actually played Clara, as one student in their second to last year was allowed to audition for a role in the show each year. Lucas had been so glad it was her and not Eliott. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Eliott had yet to show up. Why the hell would he be waking up so early if he hadn&rsquo;t planned to show up to class on time? It made no sense to Lucas, though he supposed the reason could have simply been because he knew Lucas would be getting up earlier and wanted to be awake to rile him up. </p><p>At a minute before eight, Eliott sauntered into the room casually, meeting Sofiane&rsquo;s eyes immediately and moving to sit next to him, picking up a conversation as if he&rsquo;d been there the entire time. Lucas rolled his eyes as he watched them, he had no idea how Sofiane put up with Eliott. </p><p>There was a loud clap and everyone sat up straight immediately, jolting to attention as Madame Rigaux entered the classroom. Conversations stopped in an instant and all eyes were trained on her with a sharp, almost hungry focus. Madame Rigaux was a nightmare if she didn&rsquo;t like you, but her favorites always claimed she was one of the best instructors they&rsquo;d ever had. Lucas wasn&rsquo;t quite a favorite yet, but he hoped by the end of this year that he&rsquo;d get to experience more than the former, which he had grown accustomed to for quite some time. </p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, and welcome back.&rdquo; She spoke softly, but she knew everyone was hanging on to her every word. </p><p>&ldquo;Good morning Madame Rigaux,&rdquo; they all repeated in a chorus back to her. The corner of her mouth lifted in what one might have mistaken for a smile had they not known her. Those who did know her knew that look was born of satisfaction, of knowing the hold she had over all of them, knowing each and every one of their strengths and weaknesses and how to exploit them. It was a terrifying look. </p><p>&ldquo;Final year. The time does fly, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Her question received no response, exactly as she&rsquo;d anticipated. &ldquo;This year will be one of the most difficult perhaps in your entire career as a dancer. All the training you&rsquo;ve been doing up to this point is a walk in the park compared to what&rsquo;s in store for you this year.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas unintentionally held his breath as she spoke, not wanting to cause any disturbance in the silence that had engulfed the room. It was so heavy, so deep, that each word she spoke rang out like a bell, echoing through the high ceilings. </p><p>&ldquo;Not only will you be continuing with your general education courses, studying in various styles and techniques of dance, some old and some new, and assisting with some of the younger classes, you will also be auditioning, rehearsing, and performing in this year&rsquo;s winter student production,&rdquo; she continued. As if they didn&rsquo;t all already know that, each of them barely resisting jumping up and begging her to tell them what they would be performing. </p><p>&ldquo;The production, as you all know, was The Nutcracker last year.&rdquo; She was really going to milk it as long as she could, though Lucas couldn&rsquo;t say he was surprised. &ldquo;This year, however, we wanted something a bit darker, more intense, with more depth from the characters to pull from. It will be both physically and emotionally demanding, and something that won&rsquo;t always make the audience believe in happy endings, something that will make the audience weep as they stand on their feet and applaud in awe.&rdquo;</p><p>Maybe Romeo and Juliet? The last class that had performed Romeo and Juliet was in their final year during Lucas&rsquo; first year. It was definitely feasible, it had been quite a long time since then.</p><p>&ldquo;Auditions will begin next Friday, giving you almost two full weeks to prepare, a generous decision made by Monsieur Moreau, not me. If it were up to me you&rsquo;d begin auditions today, and we&rsquo;d see who has been keeping up their training during the holidays and who,&rdquo; she glanced pointedly at a few students, including Emma and Arthur, &ldquo;has some catching up to do. That all being said, I am pleased to announce that this year&rsquo;s winter production will be Swan Lake.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas&rsquo; eyes found Eliott&rsquo;s instinctively. He looked away as quickly as he&rsquo;d looked in the first place, but not before he saw the same exact emotions he was feeling reflected in Eliott&rsquo;s eyes. Prince Siegfried had always been Lucas&rsquo; dream role, since he&rsquo;d first seen the ballet as a child. It was one of the reasons his mother had enrolled him in ballet in the first place. Of course, Prince Siegfried was also Eliott&rsquo;s dream role, it was one of the things they had bonded over as children, arguing playfully about who got to be the Prince, and who played Odette when they practiced with one another. </p><p>Lucas had always been on the shorter side, and was thus relegated to the role of Odette. It hadn&rsquo;t bothered him at the time, laughing giddily as Eliott attempted to pick him up and spin him around, but now those memories felt like a punch in the gut. </p><p>Another clap brought his mind back to the present. He realized Madame Rigaux had finished speaking, as everyone was now scrambling for their preferred barre spots. Eliott and Manon were at the front of each of their respective barre&rsquo;s, of course, the spots left open for them despite the fact that Eliott moved there leisurely, allowing time for anyone to take the front spot if they wanted it. </p><p>Lucas realized that his usual spot beside Yann had been taken by Arthur, and there was now only one available spot in front of Imane. Fuck. It wasn&rsquo;t that he didn&rsquo;t like Imane, she was great, but she was also intimidating as hell. He wasn&rsquo;t even sure if she&rsquo;d allow him to stand by her, even if it was the only spot left. </p><p>As anticipated, she frowned as he approached. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only spot left,&rdquo; he said by way of explanation. </p><p>&ldquo;Is it so bad to have to stand by me at the barre?&rdquo; she asked in a falsely casual tone, flexing and pointing her feet aimlessly as she secured her hijab into place. </p><p>&ldquo;No, no, of course not, I just thought you wouldn&rsquo;t want to stand by <i>me</i>,&rdquo; he confessed, cheeks reddening as he spoke. Imane smirked and looked him up and down. &ldquo;Better you than Arthur,&rdquo; she conceded, turning away from him. Lucas felt himself begin to smile in return, ducking his head so no one would notice as he rolled out his shoulders and placed his left hand on the barre, ready to begin class. </p><p>Madame Rigaux only watched Eliott as she began going over their warm up combination, even though everyone was marking the movements along with her. In her defense, it was hard not to watch him, as much as Lucas hated to admit it. The focus in his eyes was so intense that Lucas found himself taken aback. He never usually watched Eliott in class, but he always assumed that Eliott carried an air of nonchalance with him, strolling into class late, being the last to go across the floor, skipping extra practice sessions, but the intensity in his stare at that moment reminded Lucas of just how much Eliott had always loved dance when they were kids. How much he apparently still did. </p><p>Too late, Lucas realized he&rsquo;d been too busy watching Eliott to take in the combination himself. As Madame Rigaux moved to tell the piano accompanist what to play, Lucas turned to Imane with wide eyes. &ldquo;Imane, what&rsquo;s the combination?&rdquo; he asked fervently.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows at him. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t paying attention?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&ndash; I was trying to, but&ndash; Imane, please,&rdquo; he stammered, looking at Madame Rigaux out of the corner of his eyes. Imane sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. </p><p>&ldquo;Switch places with me,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>He blinked. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Switch places with me</i>,&rdquo; she repeated in a quiet hiss, pulling him behind her and stepping into his place. &ldquo;This way you can follow me on the right side, and by the time we get to the left you should know it.&rdquo;</p><p>He could have kissed her. &ldquo;Imane you&rsquo;re the greatest. I owe you one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, just try to pay attention next time.&rdquo; She turned around so her back was facing him, but he caught the hint of a smile on her face before she was facing the opposite direction completely. He nodded in acknowledgement, even though she couldn&rsquo;t see him anymore. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For the rest of class he made sure to pay extra attention to Madame Rigaux, memorizing the combinations so well that there was no way he&rsquo;d be lost like he was at the beginning of class. It was easy to do once he&rsquo;d retrained his brain to ignore Eliott completely. By the end, he even received a compliment on his grand jet&eacute;, something he&rsquo;d been working diligently at for years with no notice. It felt great, if he was being honest. Maybe he had a shot at Prince Siegfried after all.</p><p><b>Mardi 2:17</b></p><p>&ldquo;Lu, you have to be Odette!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to. I want to be the Prince,&rdquo; Lucas whined, crossing his arms in front of him in a huff. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ever have to?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott nearly bounced as he shrugged, grin taking over his face. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m taller than you. You can&rsquo;t lift me, and that&rsquo;s an essential part of partnering. If we&rsquo;re ever going to make it as dancers we&rsquo;re going to have to know how to partner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be the girl when we <i>actually</i> partner, though,&rdquo; Lucas argued. </p><p>&ldquo;Please, Lu. For me?&rdquo; Not the puppy dog eyes. Lucas&rsquo; will crumbled around the puppy dog eyes. He could actually feel himself giving in to Eliott&rsquo;s request. Lucas sighed and held out his hands. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott bounced up and down with excitement, grabbing Lucas&rsquo; hands and pulling them both to the middle of Eliott&rsquo;s backyard. It would have been preferable to practice at their studio, but it was closed on Sundays, which annoyed them both endlessly. <i>&ldquo;Just wait until we&rsquo;re at school,&rdquo; Eliott always said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be able to dance together day and night, whenever we want!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Lucas had to admit that it sounded great. Not only extra time in a real dance studio, but also extra time goofing around and having fake turning and leaping competitions with his best friend in the world. They would spend ten whole years at the school together, and Lucas couldn&rsquo;t wait to start. He wondered who else they would meet there, if anyone would be better than Eliott. As far as Lucas was concerned, <i>no one</i> was better than Eliott. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Lucas said after he and Eliott had run through and failed a variety of different lifts. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m Odette does that mean I get to do the thirty-two fouettes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lu, you can barely do one fouette,&rdquo; Eliott laughed. Lucas smacked him on the shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. I-can-do-five-so-I&rsquo;m-so-fancy. I&rsquo;m just <i>saying</i>, technically I get the big turn section if I have to be Odette!&rdquo; Lucas smirked, raising one eyebrow as Eliott laughed softly, eyes resting on the grass beneath their feet. </p><p>He looked back up at Lucas. &ldquo;Well <i>technically,</i> that&rsquo;s Odile.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re usually played by the same person!&rdquo; Lucas wasn&rsquo;t going to let up so easily. &ldquo;That means I get to do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm,&rdquo; Eliott pretended to consider, squinting his eyes for effect. &ldquo;Ok. You win. Go, Odile, impress me with your fouettes and I&rsquo;ll see if you deserve a standing ovation.&rdquo; Eliott wiggled his eyebrows. </p><p>Lucas licked his bottom lip and laughed. &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m not going to do them <i>right now.</i> First of all, we&rsquo;re not even in a dance studio, second of all, like you said, I can barely do <i>one</i> fouette, much less thirty-two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you just said you wanted to do it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but not now. When I&rsquo;m older and able to do more than one fouette.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How old?&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas thought about it for a minute. &ldquo;Seventeen?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott laughed and ruffled Lucas&rsquo; hair. It was a thing he always did, never able to keep his hands out of Lucas&rsquo; hair for more than ten minutes. &ldquo;Why seventeen? That&rsquo;s so far away!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be our last year of school.&rdquo; Lucas shrugged. &ldquo;Seems fitting. If we haven&rsquo;t performed Swan Lake by then, I&rsquo;ll need my chance to show off my impressive set of fouettes. We&rsquo;ll do our own performance of Swan Lake, just the two of us, but this time you&rsquo;ll be Odette because I&rsquo;ll definitely be taller than you by then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean I get to do the fouettes?&rdquo; Eliott interjected, and Lucas cut him off with a glare. </p><p>&ldquo;No. I get to be the Prince <i>and</i> do the fouettes. It&rsquo;s only fair.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What if I let you be the Prince now? Then, when we&rsquo;re seventeen, I&rsquo;ll be the Prince and you&rsquo;ll be Odette, and you can do all the fouettes your heart desires,&rdquo; Eliott offered. </p><p>Lucas narrowed his eyes at Eliott. &ldquo;If we ever do an <i>actual</i> Swan Lake production, I&rsquo;m going to be the Prince.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never said you wouldn&rsquo;t, this is just for our two-man Swan Lake show,&rdquo; Eliott amended, eyes crinkling at the sides as he smiled. &ldquo;Eli and Lu! Two-man world ballet tour!&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas laughed, nudging Eliott&rsquo;s shoulder with his. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one allowed to call me that, I don&rsquo;t want it on the name of our ballet show. <i>Lucas</i> is more professional.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one allowed to call me Eli,&rdquo; Eliott countered, &ldquo;Other than my mom, but we have to make some sacrifices if we want to be successful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about Elu? The Elu Two-Man World Ballet Tour!&rdquo; Lucas suggested, only half-joking. There was no way he was letting anyone call him Lu, or even know that there was someone he <i>did</i> allow to call him Lu. </p><p>&ldquo;Elu?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mix of our names. Eli and Lu, Elu.&rdquo; It was a bad idea. Eliott was going to hate it. </p><p>But Eliott just smiled. &ldquo;Elu. I love it! Do we have a deal, then?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, we have a deal,&rdquo; Lucas agreed, holding out his hand. Eliott shook it once before pressing a soft kiss to Lucas&rsquo; knuckles, pulling him in and spinning him around. Lucas laughed as they ended up chest to chest. He wrapped his arms around Eliott&rsquo;s middle and furrowed his brows in concentration, trying to lift him up like the Prince would.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! See, I told you I could do it, Eli!&rdquo; Lucas shrieked in excitement, holding Eliott a few inches off the ground. It wasn&rsquo;t much, but he&rsquo;d <i>told</i> Eliott he could do it. And he could. </p><p>Eliott&rsquo;s voice rang out just as excited. &ldquo;I knew you could, Lu! I knew it!&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott&rsquo;s laughter faded as Lucas bolted up in bed, blinking away the memory that had occupied his dreams. The clock beside him said that it was a little while past two in the morning. Fucking fantastic. Not only was he being haunted by Eliott in real life, now he was being haunted by Eliott in his dreams. </p><p>He rubbed his eyes fervently as if that would erase his dream from his mind. Dreams like that happened every now and then, crawling out from the tightest corners of his brain and disrupting the Eliott-less peace he&rsquo;d grown accustomed to over the past eight or so years. The worst part about them wasn&rsquo;t that they attacked when he least expected it, no, the worst part about them was that, for one fleeting moment, he missed those times. He missed their easy friendship and the way they knew each other better than they knew themselves. It only lasted an instant, but it was enough for Lucas to hate that he still felt that way, even now. </p><p>He had Yann, he had Arthur, he had Manon, he didn&rsquo;t need to dwell on the past. That relationship had ended for a reason, no matter how much his mind tried to make him forget sometimes. Eliott&rsquo;s words from the dream repeated themselves in his head, <i>we have to make some sacrifices if we want to be successful. </i>Lucas snorted aloud, falling back onto his pillow. Eliott had been sure to take those words to heart. </p><p>Lucas focused on this as he fell back asleep, the fact that no matter the vows they&rsquo;d made and the lives they&rsquo;d promised to live together, in the end Lucas was just an obstacle to Eliott&rsquo;s success. Lucas liked to think that he would have done the same if his and Eliott&rsquo;s roles were reversed, but he knew he wouldn&rsquo;t have, even if there was the promise of a principal role in the company waiting on the other side. He didn&rsquo;t know if that made him loyal, weak, or stupid.</p><p>Maybe he was just a combination of the three.</p></p>",
