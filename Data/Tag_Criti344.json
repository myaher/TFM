I mean, it\u2019s the Superman thing again.\u00a0 You have two schools of thought, right?\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe can\u2019t be hurt, so what are the stakes?\u201d and\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s invulnerable, but <i>nothing he loves or cares about is</i>, how will he keep it safe?\u201d</p><p>Listen, death SHOULD always be on the cards for characters where that makes sense for the end of their story.\u00a0 It would have made sense for Percy after he completed his revenge.\u00a0 I understand why Taliesin put very stringent requirements on the resurrection working.\u00a0 It would have been a very different story, but a good one.\u00a0 It made sense for Vax at the end of the campaign, and honestly, I\u2019m glad Scanlan didn\u2019t have that wish - that would have felt cheap.\u00a0 Again - this was an approach agreed between Matt and Liam because they felt it fit with both the world and the character.\u00a0 It was very sad, but it <i>made sense.</i>\u00a0If Keyleth had actually died jumping off a cliff? Would that have been fun? Would that have made sense, or been satisfying?\u00a0 For some people, sure.\u00a0 But for me? I don\u2019t really think permadeath should have been on the table at that point.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m not here to say that the Critical Role guys are doing it wrong.\u00a0 They are very clearly doing it very right.\u00a0 They are playing the game exactly as <i>they</i>\u00a0want to and it\u2019s fun to watch because <i>they</i>\u00a0love it.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>We don\u2019t all have to play exactly the way they do, though. To be clear, I don\u2019t think Mercer &amp; Co have ever suggested that either.\u00a0 The opposite, in fact.\u00a0 I do think fandom sometimes holds them in such high regard that to question their approach is&hellip;not really considered.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It should be, though? I don\u2019t think the gift of the show is an example to follow, I think it\u2019s a <i>common</i>\u00a0example we can use as a reference point while we work out what <i>we</i>\u00a0want from <i>our</i> games.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Death-averse players, I see you.\u00a0 There ain\u2019t nothing wrong with you or your style, and it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re lightweight or your stories are less epic.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The character I played for the longest time - ten years of my life - she had a fling with another character\u2019s best friend.\u00a0 He was easy going, kind, a paladin.\u00a0 Thing is, this one time, she almost died.\u00a0 And by almost, I mean, by the rules, she <i>did</i>\u00a0die.\u00a0 Except this devil saved her for some reason.\u00a0 And then she pissed off that devil by refusing to acknowledge the debt.\u00a0 And then the devil kidnapped the dude.\u00a0 Classic shit.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI shall rescue him!\u201d I declared, convinced that I\u2019d fix everything. I schemed a good scheme.\u00a0 It involved a world-changing secret, a high-class auction and a priest in an enormous hat.\u00a0 Anyway, I got my boy back <i>and he was broken</i>.\u00a0 Time moves differently in hell.\u00a0 The weeks I\u2019d taken to steal him away again had been years for him.\u00a0 He\u2019d lost his faith.\u00a0 He regretted ever meeting me. I did my best to help him rebuild parts of his life.\u00a0 But it was always awkward.\u00a0 Mostly we just avoided each other.\u00a0 One day, I had to choose between him and another volunteer - which one would undertake a mission that would quite possibly result in their deaths. I chose him. In part - awfully and selfishly - because I figured I might as well pour my mistakes into a single vessel.\u00a0 And yes, he died.</p><p>Later, much much later, I found out the devil who stole him was <i>me</i>\u00a0from a possible future.\u00a0 That\u2019s why she saved me: to protect her own genesis.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Or.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Another player in another campaign.

                "content": "<p>So like, a Thing happened on Critical Role.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to talk about it in&hellip;critical terms?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s the right word.&nbsp; Listen, my point is mostly that there&rsquo;s this dogma in a lot of tabletop RPGs that if there&rsquo;s no chance of dying, there&rsquo;s no&nbsp;&ldquo;stakes&rdquo;.&nbsp; Nothing matters, nothing feels real, no one invests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But I think that depends on why you play the game.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s for strategy, then a loss condition like death makes sense.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s for the story, then why the hell <i>would</i>&nbsp;I invest in a story which might be cut short at any moment, in a narrativly unsatisfying way?</p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen critique from indie circles that D&amp;D needs more failure conditions that aren&rsquo;t death, but fuck it, those are all just story-based things and that&rsquo;s down to your DM anyway.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a problem with the <i>rules</i>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s absolutely a good maxim for a story-based game, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Because death is absolutely not the worst thing you can do to me as a player.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s frustrating and upsetting on a meta level, sure.&nbsp; But stakes for a character? I mean, it&rsquo;s the Superman thing again.&nbsp; You have two schools of thought, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be hurt, so what are the stakes?&rdquo; and&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s invulnerable, but <i>nothing he loves or cares about is</i>, how will he keep it safe?&rdquo;</p><p>Listen, death SHOULD always be on the cards for characters where that makes sense for the end of their story.&nbsp; It would have made sense for Percy after he completed his revenge.&nbsp; I understand why Taliesin put very stringent requirements on the resurrection working.&nbsp; It would have been a very different story, but a good one.&nbsp; It made sense for Vax at the end of the campaign, and honestly, I&rsquo;m glad Scanlan didn&rsquo;t have that wish - that would have felt cheap.&nbsp; Again - this was an approach agreed between Matt and Liam because they felt it fit with both the world and the character.&nbsp; It was very sad, but it <i>made sense.</i>&nbsp;If Keyleth had actually died jumping off a cliff? Would that have been fun? Would that have made sense, or been satisfying?&nbsp; For some people, sure.&nbsp; But for me? I don&rsquo;t really think permadeath should have been on the table at that point.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m not here to say that the Critical Role guys are doing it wrong.&nbsp; They are very clearly doing it very right.&nbsp; They are playing the game exactly as <i>they</i>&nbsp;want to and it&rsquo;s fun to watch because <i>they</i>&nbsp;love it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We don&rsquo;t all have to play exactly the way they do, though. To be clear, I don&rsquo;t think Mercer &amp; Co have ever suggested that either.&nbsp; The opposite, in fact.&nbsp; I do think fandom sometimes holds them in such high regard that to question their approach is&hellip;not really considered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It should be, though? I don&rsquo;t think the gift of the show is an example to follow, I think it&rsquo;s a <i>common</i>&nbsp;example we can use as a reference point while we work out what <i>we</i>&nbsp;want from <i>our</i> games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Death-averse players, I see you.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t nothing wrong with you or your style, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re lightweight or your stories are less epic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The character I played for the longest time - ten years of my life - she had a fling with another character&rsquo;s best friend.&nbsp; He was easy going, kind, a paladin.&nbsp; Thing is, this one time, she almost died.&nbsp; And by almost, I mean, by the rules, she <i>did</i>&nbsp;die.&nbsp; Except this devil saved her for some reason.&nbsp; And then she pissed off that devil by refusing to acknowledge the debt.&nbsp; And then the devil kidnapped the dude.&nbsp; Classic shit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall rescue him!&rdquo; I declared, convinced that I&rsquo;d fix everything. I schemed a good scheme.&nbsp; It involved a world-changing secret, a high-class auction and a priest in an enormous hat.&nbsp; Anyway, I got my boy back <i>and he was broken</i>.&nbsp; Time moves differently in hell.&nbsp; The weeks I&rsquo;d taken to steal him away again had been years for him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d lost his faith.&nbsp; He regretted ever meeting me. I did my best to help him rebuild parts of his life.&nbsp; But it was always awkward.&nbsp; Mostly we just avoided each other.&nbsp; One day, I had to choose between him and another volunteer - which one would undertake a mission that would quite possibly result in their deaths. I chose him. In part - awfully and selfishly - because I figured I might as well pour my mistakes into a single vessel.&nbsp; And yes, he died.</p><p>Later, much much later, I found out the devil who stole him was <i>me</i>&nbsp;from a possible future.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why she saved me: to protect her own genesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Or.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another player in another campaign. He left his childhood faith (the sun god of a dragon pantheon).&nbsp; Not out of bitterness, but just because he realised it was chosen for him, he never committed himself, and it felt dishonest.&nbsp; It left him worried, though: what would happen to his soul when he died? Adventures ensued, he became a knight of the Winter Court under Oberon, the Faerie King.&nbsp; He rode with the Wild Hunt.&nbsp; Eventually, something&nbsp;killed him.&nbsp;We resurrected him and he was so happy.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d learned his afterlife was with the Court - his soul would join the endless feast of fallen knights; chaos and magic and laughter forever.&nbsp; It was an affirmative, positive experience.&nbsp; A death that alleviated his fear of death.&nbsp; </p><p>Then he died again.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d become overconfident and unworried.&nbsp; He died fighting the chosen warriors of Lolth, a spider goddess of evil and greed.&nbsp; This time he didn&rsquo;t wake up in the Winter Court. He woke up facing the Dragon of Judgement, from his original, abandoned childhood pantheon.&nbsp; It was explained to him that this god retained the right to judge the souls of all who left the faith.&nbsp; King Oberon acknowledged this right, and so, with an infinite number of souls to judge, the dragon god had allowed this soul to go on its way - to be judged one day, before the end times.&nbsp; But Lolth is jealous, she acknowledges no rights other than her own.&nbsp;Killed by one of her priests, she tried to consume my friend&rsquo;s soul before any such judgement could occur. So the Dragon took him and saved him, but he found himself having to argue his own moral worth to an impassive deity he had abandoned. A deity who made some unsettling points about some of his recent actions and choices.</p><p>Or.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When another player&rsquo;s fuckup sister got herself killed.&nbsp; We laughed.&nbsp; Ah, classic Anna.&nbsp; We were rich and powerful.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d fix this in no time.&nbsp; Except someone very powerful had trapped her soul.&nbsp; We <i>panicked</i>.&nbsp; And we got her back eventually, but it took a long, difficult voyage through a magical void in a crystal ship and a lot of dead vampires to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s bring this back to Molly and Critical Role.
