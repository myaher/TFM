During a rescue mission in space, Jean is nearly killed when she is hit by a mysterious cosmic force. Once she returns home, this force not only makes her infinitely more powerful, but far more unstable. Wrestling with this entity inside her, Jean unleashes her powers in ways she can neither comprehend nor contain. With Jean spiraling out of control, and hurting the ones she loves most, she begins to unravel the very fabric that holds the X-Men together.

Daenerys looked down at you and marvelled at how beautiful and goddess like you were, she knew that when she claimed the iron thrown she was going to fuck you on it. </p><p>Dany moved her hands down to your clit and rubbed vigorously at it knowing that this would be the action that finally drove you over the edge. </p><p>A few hand movements later dany had our cumming right onto her pussy.

You let out a breathy moan.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make you scream my name, y/n&rdquo; she brought her hand back up to my back so she could finish with the strings. Once she had untied the back of your dress she let it fall to the floor around your feet. Dany trailed her fingertips from your shoulder blade to the top of your spine and all the way down to the arch of your back</p><p>&ldquo;You are beautiful&rdquo; </p><p>Dany moved around your bare body and stood in front of you so you could watch her pull her own dress off.<i> Gods you wanted her.</i> You moved your hands up to grab her hip but she stopped you. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t touch me&rdquo; she ordered &ldquo;only I can touch you&rdquo; this side of Daenerys turned you on so much because you knew that she wouldn&rsquo;t stop until you were sensitive to the touch and you were screaming her name. </p><p>&ldquo;Lay on the bed&rdquo; she ordered and instantly you felt yourself get wet. You walked over to the bed and climbed on top laying on your back and waiting for dany to do whatever she pleases. Dany soon came to the bed and walked around it, surveying every inch of you, the look she gave your body, as if she were about to devour you, caused goosebumps to spear all over your skin. </p><p>&ldquo;Open your legs y/n&rdquo; she said and you obliged &ldquo;you&rsquo;re so wet already, such a good girl&rdquo; she said with a smirk. Dany loved having this affect on you, knowing that with a few carefully planned looks and actions she can have you soaked. Dany knealt at the end of the bed, right between your open legs and pulled your hot core closer to her mouth. She grabbed both of your legs and pushed them even further apart while not hurting you, this new position gave her unlimited access to your drenched pussy. </p><p>Dany started the long night by placing harsh kisses to your inner thighs, occasionally biting down leaving you to moan out loud, &ldquo;please&rdquo; you whispered. </p><p>When dany got to your pussy she licked a long stripe up your drenched area which made you shout in appreciation. Daenerys flicked her tongue up and down your folds in a way that had you panting. She moved up a little and found herself at your clit, dany sucked harshly at it, sometimes pulling it in between her teeth. </p><p>Slowly dany trailed her right fingers from your calf to your thighs, then started to trace around your heat. Daenerys pulled herself away from your throbbing core and before you could whine she rammed her fingers into your drenched pussy. Scissoring you and curling her fingers to make you scream in pleasure. Soon enough your hips were bucking and sweat had started to gather at your temples.</p><p>Dany knew you were close without you even telling her so again she pulled away from you without losing all your built up pleasure and moved her pussy to yours and started to grind against you, your juices made it easier for dany to ride you. Dany pushed herself against you with such passion and aggression that you were shaking under her. Daenerys looked down at you and marvelled at how beautiful and goddess like you were, she knew that when she claimed the iron thrown she was going to fuck you on it. </p><p>Dany moved her hands down to your clit and rubbed vigorously at it knowing that this would be the action that finally drove you over the edge. </p><p>A few hand movements later dany had our cumming right onto her pussy. The feeling of your juices against her made her lose all control as well and was soon at her climax. Danny&rsquo;s thrusts against your core became sloppy and soon she broke from you climbing onto your body and straddled you, &ldquo;you are mine, remember that&rdquo; she said while trailing her fingers up and down your sides </p><p>&ldquo;If you keep that up, I will never mutter another&rsquo;s name&rdquo; you whispered out, the adrenaline leaving your body, leaving you tired</p><p>Dany chuckled quietly and whispered &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; before she fell asleep next to you</p></p>",
