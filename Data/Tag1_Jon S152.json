When they enter the cave to view the ancient paintings, the soft lighting and long gazes suggest that romance may be afoot for the pair. \u00a0However, up until the scene where Jon and Dany hold hands on the boat, we really don\u2019t see anything to suggest that Jon has any interest in Dany other than as a political ally. \u00a0His body language is aloof though polite when the two speak before and after Dany\u2019s\u00a0\u201cLoot Train\u201d attack, as well as when Jon goes off on the wight-hunting mission. During this scene, Jon wishes Dany \u201cgood fortune in the wars to come\u201d, and fails to look back at her as the boat is being launched, while Jorah Mormont (who is clearly in love with Dany), does look back.</p><p>So the lead ups to the scene where Jon suddenly bends the knee do not really suggest that a romance had been brewing. \u00a0Before Dany rescues the wight-hunters from the attack, Jon asserts to Beric,\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0serve the North\u201d. \u00a0Jon in some sense seems to view his Kingship as a continuation of what he did as commander of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u00a0 In allowing the Wildlings to come south of the wall, he tried to avoid their being added to the army of the dead.\u00a0 As King in the North, he is trying to prepare the North to fight the Night King\u2019s army by training Northerners and also by potentially aligning with Daenerys Targaryan, for her dragons and dragonglass. He is still - as he also says to Beric - acting as \u201cthe shield that guards the realms of men\u201d. \u00a0In this sense his impulse is that of a uniter rather than a conquerer.</p><p>Would acting as a shield include using Dany\u2019s feelings for him to get her to help him defeat the Night King? \u00a0Jon has ultimately stuck to his responsibilities in the past. \u00a0He left Ygritte after pretending to align himself with the Wildlings in season 3. \u00a0At the same time, there is no doubt that he loved Ygritte. \u00a0He sees the dilemma of the Wildlings in their desire to get South of The Wall, yet Jon is also a sworn brother of the Night\u2019s watch. \u00a0His love for Ygritte is not enough to make him join the Wildlings for real. \u00a0However, he does later help them by bringing them South. Thus Jon is a person of vision who can put himself into the shoes of others. \u00a0It\u2019s possible that he is trying to see the good in Dany (her willingness to come to his aid) while remaining uncertain about her motives.</p><p>Does Jon Snow really think that Dany has a \u201cgood heart\u201d, as he asserts to Davos? It\u2019s been made quite obvious in the show (if one is paying attention), that there is a contradiction at the heart of Dany\u2019s self-image of\u00a0\u201cliberator\u201d. Although she did free slaves and ostensibly freed the unsullied, she also crucified the Masters, burned Lannister forces and executed the Tarleys when they refused to bend the knee. \u00a0There is a paradox in being a liberator who executes those who won\u2019t follow. \u00a0Plus, is it clear to her what she is liberating Westeros (which does not have slavery) from? \u00a0Yes, Cersei is an evil individual who brutally burned down the Sept and killed her political rivals, but how is Dany different and better? \u00a0A big part of Dany\u2019s motivation appears to be vengeance for her family having been unseated, regardless of what her father did to cause this. \u00a0In this sense, what is in her heart would seem to be a vague idealism coupled with an entitled quest for power and revenge. \u00a0Jon Snow grasps the contradiction when he observes that if she uses the dragons to melt castles and burn cities,\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s just more of the same\u201d.</p><p>So in all probability, Jon is ambivalent and unsure about Dany\u2019s power and how she uses it. \u00a0This is because these issues are something that he himself has struggled with. \u00a0In general, Jon has wielded power reluctantly and has agonized over his decisions to execute people. \u00a0It is obviously something that tugs on his conscience. \u00a0Dany, on the other hand, seems relatively untroubled by the shades of gray which haunt Jon Snow. \u00a0She defends her actions as necessary in order to establish a position of strength. \u00a0This is how she can ultimately help people; the ends justify the means.</p><p>In all likelihood,<i> Game of Thrones</i> is setting viewers up for a conflict between the differing beliefs of Jon and Dany around power and how to wield it. \u00a0How this will happen exactly is unclear, but in all probability it will be precipitated by the revelation that Jon is a true born Targaryen. \u00a0In this respect he will be a threat to Dany\u2019s beliefs about her destiny as a Targaryen and as a\u00a0\u201cbreaker of chains\u201d. \u00a0When the truth about Jon becomes known, it is likely that characters who have expressed misgivings about Dany (Tyrion and Varys) will see him as an attractive alternative to her excesses. \u00a0It\u2019s also probable that Jon and Dany\u2019s different beliefs will be showcased\u00a0around her execution of the Tarleys, when this becomes known to Samwell and others at Winterfell. \u00a0Jon tries to lead by example, and is a reluctant wielder of force; therefore he is likely to be disturbed when the details of what happened become known. \u00a0His romance with Dany, which has been presented ambiguously, may quickly fall apart. \u00a0This is not only because the two are nephew and aunt, but because of their conflicting views about power. \u00a0 1/27/19</p>",

And now Jon Targaryen has to go after her. To protect her. And to get to know the girl who had the courage to do what he wanted to do for years already.</small><br/></p><p><small><i>A mix of a royal au, an arranged marriage au, a fairy tale au and it can even be canon divergence I think.\u00a0</i></small></p></blockquote><p>\u201cCome on, faster!\u201d Sansa Stark yelled at her horse while the early morning wind blew in her face. Her cheeks were almost as red as her hair and her heart was trying to break her ribs in two. Her entire body begged for her to stop, to stand still, to take a break. And her body wasn\u2019t the only one. But Sansa Stark didn\u2019t have time for a break. She didn\u2019t have time to stop. She didn\u2019t have time to stand still. She had to make sure there was as much distance between her and Winterfell as possible before her parents would notice she was gone.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me, Sansa?\u201d Her father had whispered, last night, right before he had pressed a soft kiss on her forehead and sent her to bed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She had answered, even though she hadn\u2019t meant it.</p><p>\u201cI promise you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d </p><p>But how could she be happy with a man she had never met? How could she be happy in a castle so far away from her parents, her family? How could she be happy when her hand was given away to form an alliance between the Targaryens and the Starks and not because Sansa had hopelessly fallen in love with a handsome prince? How could she be happy when all her dreams and hopes and wishes were shattered and broken as if they were nothing?</p><p>And so instead of wearing the beautiful wedding gown her mother and septa had made her to marry the Targaryen prince, Sansa had run away.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know where she was going. It didn\u2019t even matter. Everything was better than being a piece in a game her father had sworn not to play.</p><!-- more --><p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean she\u2019s gone?\u201d Jon raised his eyebrows when he stared at Samwell Tarly, Maester in training and the only friend he actually had. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Sam stuttered. He had his hands folded in front of him and stared at the wooden floor beneath his tapping feet. \u201cNed Stark just informed us that his daughter is nowhere to be found. The\u2026\u201d Sam swallowed. \u201cThe fresh snow makes it impossible to know where she has gone, but a horse disappeared from the stables too, so it looks like she deliberately ran away from you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even know me.\u201d Jon let out a deep sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s not me she\u2019s running from. It\u2019s this stupid arranged marriage our parents forced us into she\u2019s running from.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI&rsquo;m sure they\u2019ll find her back.\u201d Sam looked up, but Jon stared out of the window, at the freshly fallen snow covering Winterfell. </i></p><p><i>He was far away from home and far away from his father who had simply ordered him to go here to wed the Stark girl and to bring her with him to Dragonstone afterwards, preferably pregnant.</i></p><p><i>And not once had he questioned his father\u2019s decision. Not once had he wondered if the girl wanted to marry him. Not once had he thought about her happiness. Nor his own. </i></p><p><i>But she had. She had simply taken matters into her own hands and had started running. </i></p><p><i>And even though he should feel betrayed and left right now, he didn\u2019t. He felt admiration for the girl refusing to bow for old rules that made hardly anyone happy. He felt admiration for the girl who chose her own happiness over politics and shady scheming.

Yes, she should have been.

Not even to a handsome stranger who seemed to stare straight into her soul when he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Jon lifted his chin a little. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>Sansa shrugged her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s better than the alternative.\u201d </p><p>An unhappy life with a man she hadn\u2019t even met and would never love.</p><p><i>Jon furrowed his eyebrows and once again he let his eyes wander over the pretty black haired girl in front of him. The apron she was wearing seemed slightly too big and just like he didn\u2019t sound like a farmer, she didn\u2019t sound like a tavern girl. And the hand that had touched him so gently had been soft, as if it wasn\u2019t used to hard work like this. </i></p><p><i>He thought about his horse and Ghost, about how Ghost had circled around here, in front of the tavern. From what he had heard the runaway princess had bright red hair, but changing the color of your hair wasn\u2019t that hard. </i></p><p><i>And who would look for a princess here, in a tavern, sweeping the floors and covered in dust and ashes?</i></p><p><i>\u201cMy parents never wanted me to become a farmer either.\u201d He swallowed. He knew he should tell her who he was and why he was here. He knew he should tell her that he knew who she was and why she was here. But he didn\u2019t want to be the man who simply dragged her back to her duty. He didn\u2019t want to be the man dragging them both back to their duty. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat did your parents do?\u201d Sansa, Alayne, cocked her head and Jon curled his lips up into a smile. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThey were nobles. Farming was way beneath them, but\u2026\u201d He realised that the lie came this easy because it was the truth. If he could have, he would have become a farmer, growing his own crops and taking care of a few sheep and cows. \u201cI followed my heart anyway.\u201d </i></p><p><i>If only he had truly been brave enough to do so. If only he had done what Sansa, Alayne, had done.</i></p><p>Sansa wasn\u2019t sure what made her new life so easy. Maybe sweeping floors and serving unthankful customers wasn\u2019t as bad as she had always imagined it to be. Or maybe it was the company of Jon Snow, who always seemed to brighten her mood whenever she was losing her patience. </p><p>During the day he helped her with all her tasks, cleaning the tables and cooking the food. And in the evenings they talked, while they shared the leftovers and stared at the million stars above them until they were almost asleep and had to force themselves to stand up to go and find their beds.</p><p>Sansa had a small room in the attic. Spiderwebs covered the ceiling and the planks creaked when she stepped on them, but somehow the warm bed and the echoes of her conversations with Jon were all she needed to have nice and pleasant dreams.</p><p>This was why she had run away from home, from an arranged marriage and an unhappily ever after. This was what she had hoped to find in the world. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d The cold evening wind blew in her face, but Sansa turned towards the handsome boy with the dark curls next to her. \u201cThe last couple of weeks have been the best weeks of my life.\u201d She pressed the palm of her hand to his stubbled cheek. \u201cI wish it could last forever.\u201d</p><p>Jon rolled on his side to face her and he locked his glance with hers. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it can?\u201d There was a certain sadness in his eyes and Sansa already felt guilty for destroying the one thing that had made her happy lately. </p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t been absolutely honest with you.\u201d A tear escaped her eye. \u201cAnd I can never be. And I\u2019m sorry about that, because I think you could have been my happily ever after. But how can you truly love me, if I can never tell you who I really am?\u201d</p><p><i>Jon wiped a few loose strands of dark black hair from Sansa\u2019s face and then his lips curled up into a smile. \u201cI already know, Sansa Stark.\u201d He whispered her name and it surprised him how pleasant it felt to let it roll off his tongue. \u201cIt took me five minutes to figure it out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sansa pushed herself up and she widened her eyes while she shook her head in disbelief. \u201cYou knew? You knew all this time?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon nodded and pushed himself up too. \u201cYou&rsquo;re not the only one who lied, though.\u201d Jon moved a little closer towards her. \u201cI&rsquo;m not a farmer, no matter how badly I wanted to be one.\u201d He swallowed, but didn\u2019t give Sansa the time to interrupt him. \u201cI&rsquo;m Jon Targaryen, the crown prince of Westeros and the man you were supposed to marry.\u201d</i></p><p><i>For a moment Sansa just stared at him. She opened her mouth to say something, but closed it again when she couldn\u2019t find the right words. It was the first time in weeks Jon found Sansa absolutely speechless.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI&rsquo;m sorry.\u201d Jon bent his head, but he felt Sansa\u2019s hand grabbing his chin to force him to look up again. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are we gonna do now? Are we going back? Get married and become the next king and queen of Westeros?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d Jon swallowed. Their noses brushed each other and he could feel the warmth of Sansa\u2019s breath on his face. \u201cWhat do you want Sansa Stark?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d She pressed her soft lips on his and Jon held his breath for a short second before he kissed her back. \u201cI just want you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon let his hands go through her black hair and he closed his eyes while his lips parted to let her tongue in. \u201cDo you want the prince or the farmer?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sansa pulled back and swallowed. \u201cIs the farmer truly an option?\u201d There was a longing in her voice that echoed his own desires, his wishes, his dreams. She voiced the fire that had made her run away, the jealousy he had felt when she had actually done what he had not dared to do for way too long and she most of all captured the simple future they both wanted.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think if we really want this, we can do this.\u201d</i></p><p>Once again Sansa left in the early morning on the back of her horse. Once again she was yelling her horse to run faster and faster. But this time she was not leaving alone.</p><p>Jon Targaryen, Jon Snow or whatever his name would be once they\u2019d reach the town where they\u2019d start their new future, was riding next to her.</p><p>They\u2019d leave everything behind. Their crowns, their castles, the fake identity Petyr Baelish had given her. And yet, they\u2019d have everything they\u2019d ever wanted and needed.</p><p>They would be whoever they wanted to be. They would do whatever they wanted to do. </p><p>And they would really get their happily ever after.</p>",

He didn\u2019t want to be the man dragging them both back to their duty. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat did your parents do?\u201d Sansa, Alayne, cocked her head and Jon curled his lips up into a smile. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThey were nobles. Farming was way beneath them, but\u2026\u201d He realised that the lie came this easy because it was the truth. If he could have, he would have become a farmer, growing his own crops and taking care of a few sheep and cows. \u201cI followed my heart anyway.\u201d </i></p><p><i>If only he had truly been brave enough to do so. If only he had done what Sansa, Alayne, had done.</i></p><p>Sansa wasn\u2019t sure what made her new life so easy. Maybe sweeping floors and serving unthankful customers wasn\u2019t as bad as she had always imagined it to be. Or maybe it was the company of Jon Snow, who always seemed to brighten her mood whenever she was losing her patience. </p><p>During the day he helped her with all her tasks, cleaning the tables and cooking the food. And in the evenings they talked, while they shared the leftovers and stared at the million stars above them until they were almost asleep and had to force themselves to stand up to go and find their beds.</p><p>Sansa had a small room in the attic. Spiderwebs covered the ceiling and the planks creaked when she stepped on them, but somehow the warm bed and the echoes of her conversations with Jon were all she needed to have nice and pleasant dreams.</p><p>This was why she had run away from home, from an arranged marriage and an unhappily ever after. This was what she had hoped to find in the world. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d The cold evening wind blew in her face, but Sansa turned towards the handsome boy with the dark curls next to her. \u201cThe last couple of weeks have been the best weeks of my life.\u201d She pressed the palm of her hand to his stubbled cheek. \u201cI wish it could last forever.\u201d</p><p>Jon rolled on his side to face her and he locked his glance with hers. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it can?\u201d There was a certain sadness in his eyes and Sansa already felt guilty for destroying the one thing that had made her happy lately. </p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t been absolutely honest with you.\u201d A tear escaped her eye. \u201cAnd I can never be. And I\u2019m sorry about that, because I think you could have been my happily ever after. But how can you truly love me, if I can never tell you who I really am?\u201d</p><p><i>Jon wiped a few loose strands of dark black hair from Sansa\u2019s face and then his lips curled up into a smile. \u201cI already know, Sansa Stark.\u201d He whispered her name and it surprised him how pleasant it felt to let it roll off his tongue. \u201cIt took me five minutes to figure it out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sansa pushed herself up and she widened her eyes while she shook her head in disbelief. \u201cYou knew? You knew all this time?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon nodded and pushed himself up too. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who lied, though.\u201d Jon moved a little closer towards her. \u201cI\u2019m not a farmer, no matter how badly I wanted to be one.\u201d He swallowed, but didn\u2019t give Sansa the time to interrupt him. \u201cI\u2019m Jon Targaryen, the crown prince of Westeros and the man you were supposed to marry.\u201d</i></p><p><i>For a moment Sansa just stared at him. She opened her mouth to say something, but closed it again when she couldn\u2019t find the right words. It was the first time in weeks Jon found Sansa absolutely speechless.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Jon bent his head, but he felt Sansa\u2019s hand grabbing his chin to force him to look up again. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are we gonna do now? Are we going back? Get married and become the next king and queen of Westeros?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d Jon swallowed. Their noses brushed each other and he could feel the warmth of Sansa\u2019s breath on his face. \u201cWhat do you want Sansa Stark?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d She pressed her soft lips on his and Jon held his breath for a short second before he kissed her back. \u201cI just want you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon let his hands go through her black hair and he closed his eyes while his lips parted to let her tongue in. \u201cDo you want the prince or the farmer?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sansa pulled back and swallowed. \u201cIs the farmer truly an option?\u201d There was a longing in her voice that echoed his own desires, his wishes, his dreams. She voiced the fire that had made her run away, the jealousy he had felt when she had actually done what he had not dared to do for way too long and she most of all captured the simple future they both wanted.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think if we really want this, we can do this.\u201d</i></p><p>Once again Sansa left in the early morning on the back of her horse. Once again she was yelling her horse to run faster and faster. But this time she was not leaving alone.</p><p>Jon Targaryen, Jon Snow or whatever his name would be once they\u2019d reach the town where they\u2019d start their new future, was riding next to her.</p><p>They\u2019d leave everything behind. Their crowns, their castles, the fake identity Petyr Baelish had given her. And yet, they\u2019d have everything they\u2019d ever wanted and needed.</p><p>They would be whoever they wanted to be. They would do whatever they wanted to do. </p><p>And they would really get their happily ever after.</p></p>",

And now Jon Targaryen has to go after her. To protect her. And to get to know the girl who had the courage to do what he wanted to do for years already.</small><br></p><p><small><i>A mix of a royal au, an arranged marriage au, a fairy tale au and it can even be canon divergence I think.\u00a0</i></small></p></blockquote><p>\u201cCome on, faster!\u201d Sansa Stark yelled at her horse while the early morning wind blew in her face. Her cheeks were almost as red as her hair and her heart was trying to break her ribs in two. Her entire body begged for her to stop, to stand still, to take a break. And her body wasn\u2019t the only one. But Sansa Stark didn\u2019t have time for a break. She didn\u2019t have time to stop. She didn\u2019t have time to stand still. She had to make sure there was as much distance between her and Winterfell as possible before her parents would notice she was gone.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me, Sansa?\u201d Her father had whispered, last night, right before he had pressed a soft kiss on her forehead and sent her to bed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She had answered, even though she hadn\u2019t meant it.</p><p>\u201cI promise you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d </p><p>But how could she be happy with a man she had never met? How could she be happy in a castle so far away from her parents, her family? How could she be happy when her hand was given away to form an alliance between the Targaryens and the Starks and not because Sansa had hopelessly fallen in love with a handsome prince? How could she be happy when all her dreams and hopes and wishes were shattered and broken as if they were nothing?</p><p>And so instead of wearing the beautiful wedding gown her mother and septa had made her to marry the Targaryen prince, Sansa had run away.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know where she was going. It didn\u2019t even matter. Everything was better than being a piece in a game her father had sworn not to play.</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean she\u2019s gone?\u201d Jon raised his eyebrows when he stared at Samwell Tarly, Maester in training and the only friend he actually had. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Sam stuttered. He had his hands folded in front of him and stared at the wooden floor beneath his tapping feet. \u201cNed Stark just informed us that his daughter is nowhere to be found. The\u2026\u201d Sam swallowed. \u201cThe fresh snow makes it impossible to know where she has gone, but a horse disappeared from the stables too, so it looks like she deliberately ran away from you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even know me.\u201d Jon let out a deep sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s not me she\u2019s running from. It\u2019s this stupid arranged marriage our parents forced us into she\u2019s running from.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll find her back.\u201d Sam looked up, but Jon stared out of the window, at the freshly fallen snow covering Winterfell. </i></p><p><i>He was far away from home and far away from his father who had simply ordered him to go here to wed the Stark girl and to bring her with him to Dragonstone afterwards, preferably pregnant.</i></p><p><i>And not once had he questioned his father\u2019s decision. Not once had he wondered if the girl wanted to marry him. Not once had he thought about her happiness. Nor his own. </i></p><p><i>But she had. She had simply taken matters into her own hands and had started running. </i></p><p><i>And even though he should feel betrayed and left right now, he didn\u2019t. He felt admiration for the girl refusing to bow for old rules that made hardly anyone happy. He felt admiration for the girl who chose her own happiness over politics and shady scheming. And he wished he had come up with the idea before she had had to.</i></p><p><i>Because now he felt the desperate need to go find her and make sure she was safe and okay.</i></p><p>The roads leading her away from Winterfell were empty. It was too early in the morning for travellers, but it was already too light for the robbers who preferred operating in the dark.</p><p>Every few seconds Sansa looked over her shoulder to make sure she wasn\u2019t followed. In her mind she could hear the screaming voices of her father\u2019s men chasing her, but every time she checked there was nothing but emptiness and a little more distance between her and the arranged marriage she was trying to flee from. </p><p>\u201cWhat is a pretty girl like you doing on this road all alone?\u201d</p><p>Sansa pulled her hood a little further over her head to cover her eyes and red hair when a strange man approached her. He sat on a high horse, holding the reins firmly, but even with his back straight and his chin lifted she noticed that he was smaller than she was. Smaller, maybe, but years older and wiser too. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe to travel without an escorte.\u201d The man approached her until their horses stood next to each other. He touched her hood with his fingers and a smile spread across his face when he removed her cover. \u201cSansa Stark\u2026\u201d He cocked his hand and the tips of his fingers touched her cheek when he pulled his hand back. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be at your own wedding with the Targaryen prince right now?\u201d</p><p>Sansa bent her head and avoided his glance. Yes, she should have been. But she didn\u2019t want to be. \u201cI\u2019m exactly where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is not where your parents want you to be.\u201d The stranger kept on smirking and Sansa felt a shiver rolling down her spine. \u201cYou\u2019re just as beautiful as your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew my mother?\u201d Sansa furrowed her eyebrows and tried to relax, but failed hopelessly. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t just know her. I loved her. Which is why I will help you to escape a marriage that will make you unhappy.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYou sure this is where the trail ends?\u201d Jon exchanged a glance with the white wolf circling around and around at the same spot. Jon had to admit that Sansa had gotten further than he had expected. \u201cFine, I trust you.\u201d He climbed down from his horse and took a deep breath before he walked to the small tavern. \u201cGhost? Watch my horse for me, will you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>It wouldn\u2019t be the first time the horse would decide that exploring the world was much more interesting than waiting for his prince to return.</i></p><p><i>And Jon couldn\u2019t even blame him. There was a reason he was so impressed by Sansa Stark and her determination to outrun a future she didn\u2019t want. He wished he had done the same, years ago already.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMy apologies, sir, but I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re not open yet.\u201d A dark haired girl looked up at him and Jon felt his heart skipping a beat in his chest. Her eyes were the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen and even though her face was dirty and covered in sweat he noticed how pretty she was. </i></p><p><i>Jon scratched the back of his neck. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll come back later then?\u201d He wanted to turn around but the pretty girl reached for his arm and for a moment he stared at her fingers curled around his wrist. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any food yet, but I can get you a beer?\u201d She smiled and Jon couldn\u2019t help but smiling back at her. \u201cI\u2019m Alayne Stone. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d She reached out her hand and Jon placed his hand in hers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cJon\u2026\u201d He swallowed his true last name at the very last moment. \u201cSnow. Jon Snow.\u201d The palm is his hand was sweating. \u201cAnd the pleasure is mine.\u201d</i></p><p>Sansa knew that she was actually supposed to sweep floors and prepare the tavern to open, but the handsome stranger who had just walked in was a thousand times more interesting than the cover Petyr Baelish had arranged for her. \u201cSo, what do you do for a living?\u201d She sipped from her own beer and watched Jon doing the same.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Jon almost choked on his drink and he wiped his mouth while he put his mug down. \u201cI\u2019m a\u2026\u201d He hesitated for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be afraid of your job. I\u2019m a tavern maid. I can handle everything.\u201d Sansa smiled and she reached for his hand. </p><p>But Jon avoided her glance and bit his bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019m a farmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA farmer?\u201d Sansa raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound like one\u2026\u201d She quickly closed her mouth. \u201cI mean\u2026\u201d She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I mean.\u201d She bent her head and then she realised she was still holding his hand. \u201cSorry\u2026\u201d She quickly pulled her hand away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Jon smiled and Sansa smiled back at him. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d He licked his lips. \u201cHow long have you been working here already?\u201d</p><p>Sansa felt her cheeks heating up and this time it was her turn to hesitate. \u201cA couple of days, actually.\u201d More like a couple of hours, but that was not something she was going to admit out loud. Not even to a handsome stranger who seemed to stare straight into her soul when he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Jon lifted his chin a little. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>Sansa shrugged her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s better than the alternative.\u201d </p><p>An unhappy life with a man she hadn\u2019t even met and would never love.</p><p><i>Jon furrowed his eyebrows and once again he let his eyes wander over the pretty black haired girl in front of him. The apron she was wearing seemed slightly too big and just like he didn\u2019t sound like a farmer, she didn\u2019t sound like a tavern girl. And the hand that had touched him so gently had been soft, as if it wasn\u2019t used to hard work like this. </i></p><p><i>He thought about his horse and Ghost, about how Ghost had circled around here, in front of the tavern. From what he had heard the runaway princess had bright red hair, but changing the color of your hair wasn\u2019t that hard. </i></p><p><i>And who would look for a princess here, in a tavern, sweeping the floors and covered in dust and ashes?</i></p><p><i>\u201cMy parents never wanted me to become a farmer either.\u201d He swallowed. He knew he should tell her who he was and why he was here. He knew he should tell her that he knew who she was and why she was here. But he didn\u2019t want to be the man who simply dragged her back to her duty. He didn\u2019t want to be the man dragging them both back to their duty. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat did your parents do?\u201d Sansa, Alayne, cocked her head and Jon curled his lips up into a smile. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThey were nobles. Farming was way beneath them, but\u2026\u201d He realised that the lie came this easy because it was the truth.

If only he had done what Sansa, Alayne, had done.</i></p><p>Sansa wasn\u2019t sure what made her new life so easy.

And I\u2019m sorry about that, because I think you could have been my happily ever after. But how can you truly love me, if I can never tell you who I really am?\u201d</p><p><i>Jon wiped a few loose strands of dark black hair from Sansa\u2019s face and then his lips curled up into a smile. \u201cI already know, Sansa Stark.\u201d He whispered her name and it surprised him how pleasant it felt to let it roll off his tongue. \u201cIt took me five minutes to figure it out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sansa pushed herself up and she widened her eyes while she shook her head in disbelief. \u201cYou knew?

Are we going back? Get married and become the next king and queen of Westeros?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d Jon swallowed.

And now Jon Targaryen has to go after her. To protect her. And to get to know the girl who had the courage to do what he wanted to do for years already.</small><br /></p><p><small><i>A mix of a royal au, an arranged marriage au, a fairy tale au and it can even be canon divergence I think.&nbsp;</i></small></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come on, faster!&rdquo; Sansa Stark yelled at her horse while the early morning wind blew in her face. Her cheeks were almost as red as her hair and her heart was trying to break her ribs in two. Her entire body begged for her to stop, to stand still, to take a break. And her body wasn&rsquo;t the only one. But Sansa Stark didn&rsquo;t have time for a break. She didn&rsquo;t have time to stop. She didn&rsquo;t have time to stand still. She had to make sure there was as much distance between her and Winterfell as possible before her parents would notice she was gone.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you trust me, Sansa?&rdquo; Her father had whispered, last night, right before he had pressed a soft kiss on her forehead and sent her to bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She had answered, even though she hadn&rsquo;t meant it.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise you&rsquo;ll be happy.&rdquo; </p><p>But how could she be happy with a man she had never met? How could she be happy in a castle so far away from her parents, her family? How could she be happy when her hand was given away to form an alliance between the Targaryens and the Starks and not because Sansa had hopelessly fallen in love with a handsome prince? How could she be happy when all her dreams and hopes and wishes were shattered and broken as if they were nothing?</p><p>And so instead of wearing the beautiful wedding gown her mother and septa had made her to marry the Targaryen prince, Sansa had run away.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t know where she was going. It didn&rsquo;t even matter. Everything was better than being a piece in a game her father had sworn not to play.</p><p><i>&ldquo;What do you mean she&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo; Jon raised his eyebrows when he stared at Samwell Tarly, Maester in training and the only friend he actually had. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Sam stuttered. He had his hands folded in front of him and stared at the wooden floor beneath his tapping feet. &ldquo;Ned Stark just informed us that his daughter is nowhere to be found. The&hellip;&rdquo; Sam swallowed. &ldquo;The fresh snow makes it impossible to know where she has gone, but a horse disappeared from the stables too, so it looks like she deliberately ran away from you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t even know me.&rdquo; Jon let out a deep sigh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not me she&rsquo;s running from. It&rsquo;s this stupid arranged marriage our parents forced us into she&rsquo;s running from.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll find her back.&rdquo; Sam looked up, but Jon stared out of the window, at the freshly fallen snow covering Winterfell. </i></p><p><i>He was far away from home and far away from his father who had simply ordered him to go here to wed the Stark girl and to bring her with him to Dragonstone afterwards, preferably pregnant.</i></p><p><i>And not once had he questioned his father&rsquo;s decision. Not once had he wondered if the girl wanted to marry him. Not once had he thought about her happiness. Nor his own. </i></p><p><i>But she had. She had simply taken matters into her own hands and had started running. </i></p><p><i>And even though he should feel betrayed and left right now, he didn&rsquo;t. He felt admiration for the girl refusing to bow for old rules that made hardly anyone happy. He felt admiration for the girl who chose her own happiness over politics and shady scheming. And he wished he had come up with the idea before she had had to.</i></p><p><i>Because now he felt the desperate need to go find her and make sure she was safe and okay.</i></p><p>The roads leading her away from Winterfell were empty. It was too early in the morning for travellers, but it was already too light for the robbers who preferred operating in the dark.</p><p>Every few seconds Sansa looked over her shoulder to make sure she wasn&rsquo;t followed. In her mind she could hear the screaming voices of her father&rsquo;s men chasing her, but every time she checked there was nothing but emptiness and a little more distance between her and the arranged marriage she was trying to flee from. </p><p>&ldquo;What is a pretty girl like you doing on this road all alone?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa pulled her hood a little further over her head to cover her eyes and red hair when a strange man approached her. He sat on a high horse, holding the reins firmly, but even with his back straight and his chin lifted she noticed that he was smaller than she was. Smaller, maybe, but years older and wiser too. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe to travel without an escorte.&rdquo; The man approached her until their horses stood next to each other. He touched her hood with his fingers and a smile spread across his face when he removed her cover. &ldquo;Sansa Stark&hellip;&rdquo; He cocked his hand and the tips of his fingers touched her cheek when he pulled his hand back. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be at your own wedding with the Targaryen prince right now?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa bent her head and avoided his glance. Yes, she should have been. But she didn&rsquo;t want to be. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m exactly where I want to be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which is not where your parents want you to be.&rdquo; The stranger kept on smirking and Sansa felt a shiver rolling down her spine. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just as beautiful as your mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You knew my mother?&rdquo; Sansa furrowed her eyebrows and tried to relax, but failed hopelessly. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t just know her. I loved her. Which is why I will help you to escape a marriage that will make you unhappy.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;You sure this is where the trail ends?&rdquo; Jon exchanged a glance with the white wolf circling around and around at the same spot. Jon had to admit that Sansa had gotten further than he had expected. &ldquo;Fine, I trust you.&rdquo; He climbed down from his horse and took a deep breath before he walked to the small tavern. &ldquo;Ghost? Watch my horse for me, will you?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time the horse would decide that exploring the world was much more interesting than waiting for his prince to return.</i></p><p><i>And Jon couldn&rsquo;t even blame him. There was a reason he was so impressed by Sansa Stark and her determination to outrun a future she didn&rsquo;t want. He wished he had done the same, years ago already.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;My apologies, sir, but I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re not open yet.&rdquo; A dark haired girl looked up at him and Jon felt his heart skipping a beat in his chest. Her eyes were the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen and even though her face was dirty and covered in sweat he noticed how pretty she was. </i></p><p><i>Jon scratched the back of his neck. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll come back later then?&rdquo; He wanted to turn around but the pretty girl reached for his arm and for a moment he stared at her fingers curled around his wrist. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any food yet, but I can get you a beer?&rdquo; She smiled and Jon couldn&rsquo;t help but smiling back at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Alayne Stone. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you.&rdquo; She reached out her hand and Jon placed his hand in hers.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Jon&hellip;&rdquo; He swallowed his true last name at the very last moment. &ldquo;Snow. Jon Snow.&rdquo; The palm is his hand was sweating. &ldquo;And the pleasure is mine.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Sansa knew that she was actually supposed to sweep floors and prepare the tavern to open, but the handsome stranger who had just walked in was a thousand times more interesting than the cover Petyr Baelish had arranged for her. &ldquo;So, what do you do for a living?&rdquo; She sipped from her own beer and watched Jon doing the same.</p><p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Jon almost choked on his drink and he wiped his mouth while he put his mug down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a&hellip;&rdquo; He hesitated for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be afraid of your job. I&rsquo;m a tavern maid. I can handle everything.&rdquo; Sansa smiled and she reached for his hand. </p><p>But Jon avoided her glance and bit his bottom lip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a farmer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A farmer?&rdquo; Sansa raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t sound like one&hellip;&rdquo; She quickly closed her mouth. &ldquo;I mean&hellip;&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I mean.&rdquo; She bent her head and then she realised she was still holding his hand. &ldquo;Sorry&hellip;&rdquo; She quickly pulled her hand away.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Jon smiled and Sansa smiled back at him. &ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; He licked his lips. &ldquo;How long have you been working here already?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa felt her cheeks heating up and this time it was her turn to hesitate. &ldquo;A couple of days, actually.&rdquo; More like a couple of hours, but that was not something she was going to admit out loud. Not even to a handsome stranger who seemed to stare straight into her soul when he looked at her.</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo; Jon lifted his chin a little. &ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than the alternative.&rdquo; </p><p>An unhappy life with a man she hadn&rsquo;t even met and would never love.</p><p><i>Jon furrowed his eyebrows and once again he let his eyes wander over the pretty black haired girl in front of him. The apron she was wearing seemed slightly too big and just like he didn&rsquo;t sound like a farmer, she didn&rsquo;t sound like a tavern girl. And the hand that had touched him so gently had been soft, as if it wasn&rsquo;t used to hard work like this. </i></p><p><i>He thought about his horse and Ghost, about how Ghost had circled around here, in front of the tavern. From what he had heard the runaway princess had bright red hair, but changing the color of your hair wasn&rsquo;t that hard. </i></p><p><i>And who would look for a princess here, in a tavern, sweeping the floors and covered in dust and ashes?</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;My parents never wanted me to become a farmer either.&rdquo; He swallowed. He knew he should tell her who he was and why he was here. He knew he should tell her that he knew who she was and why she was here. But he didn&rsquo;t want to be the man who simply dragged her back to her duty. He didn&rsquo;t want to be the man dragging them both back to their duty. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What did your parents do?&rdquo; Sansa, Alayne, cocked her head and Jon curled his lips up into a smile. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;They were nobles. Farming was way beneath them, but&hellip;&rdquo; He realised that the lie came this easy because it was the truth. If he could have, he would have become a farmer, growing his own crops and taking care of a few sheep and cows. &ldquo;I followed my heart anyway.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>If only he had truly been brave enough to do so. If only he had done what Sansa, Alayne, had done.</i></p><p>Sansa wasn&rsquo;t sure what made her new life so easy. Maybe sweeping floors and serving unthankful customers wasn&rsquo;t as bad as she had always imagined it to be. Or maybe it was the company of Jon Snow, who always seemed to brighten her mood whenever she was losing her patience. </p><p>During the day he helped her with all her tasks, cleaning the tables and cooking the food. And in the evenings they talked, while they shared the leftovers and stared at the million stars above them until they were almost asleep and had to force themselves to stand up to go and find their beds.</p><p>Sansa had a small room in the attic. Spiderwebs covered the ceiling and the planks creaked when she stepped on them, but somehow the warm bed and the echoes of her conversations with Jon were all she needed to have nice and pleasant dreams.</p><p>This was why she had run away from home, from an arranged marriage and an unhappily ever after. This was what she had hoped to find in the world. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon?&rdquo; The cold evening wind blew in her face, but Sansa turned towards the handsome boy with the dark curls next to her. &ldquo;The last couple of weeks have been the best weeks of my life.&rdquo; She pressed the palm of her hand to his stubbled cheek. &ldquo;I wish it could last forever.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon rolled on his side to face her and he locked his glance with hers. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it can?&rdquo; There was a certain sadness in his eyes and Sansa already felt guilty for destroying the one thing that had made her happy lately. </p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. &ldquo;Because I haven&rsquo;t been absolutely honest with you.&rdquo; A tear escaped her eye. &ldquo;And I can never be. And I&rsquo;m sorry about that, because I think you could have been my happily ever after. But how can you truly love me, if I can never tell you who I really am?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Jon wiped a few loose strands of dark black hair from Sansa&rsquo;s face and then his lips curled up into a smile. &ldquo;I already know, Sansa Stark.&rdquo; He whispered her name and it surprised him how pleasant it felt to let it roll off his tongue. &ldquo;It took me five minutes to figure it out.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Sansa pushed herself up and she widened her eyes while she shook her head in disbelief. &ldquo;You knew? You knew all this time?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Jon nodded and pushed himself up too. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the only one who lied, though.&rdquo; Jon moved a little closer towards her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a farmer, no matter how badly I wanted to be one.&rdquo; He swallowed, but didn&rsquo;t give Sansa the time to interrupt him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jon Targaryen, the crown prince of Westeros and the man you were supposed to marry.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>For a moment Sansa just stared at him. She opened her mouth to say something, but closed it again when she couldn&rsquo;t find the right words. It was the first time in weeks Jon found Sansa absolutely speechless.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Jon bent his head, but he felt Sansa&rsquo;s hand grabbing his chin to force him to look up again. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What are we gonna do now? Are we going back? Get married and become the next king and queen of Westeros?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Is that what you want?&rdquo; Jon swallowed. Their noses brushed each other and he could feel the warmth of Sansa&rsquo;s breath on his face. &ldquo;What do you want Sansa Stark?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; She pressed her soft lips on his and Jon held his breath for a short second before he kissed her back. &ldquo;I just want you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Jon let his hands go through her black hair and he closed his eyes while his lips parted to let her tongue in. &ldquo;Do you want the prince or the farmer?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Sansa pulled back and swallowed. &ldquo;Is the farmer truly an option?&rdquo; There was a longing in her voice that echoed his own desires, his wishes, his dreams. She voiced the fire that had made her run away, the jealousy he had felt when she had actually done what he had not dared to do for way too long and she most of all captured the simple future they both wanted.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I think if we really want this, we can do this.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Once again Sansa left in the early morning on the back of her horse. Once again she was yelling her horse to run faster and faster. But this time she was not leaving alone.</p><p>Jon Targaryen, Jon Snow or whatever his name would be once they&rsquo;d reach the town where they&rsquo;d start their new future, was riding next to her.</p><p>They&rsquo;d leave everything behind.

So annoyed was I that I stayed up until 4:30 am writing the bulk of this so apologies if it seems a little scattered and messy. I have read through this, but I\u2019ve probably missed stuff. Basically just Jon Snow and his growing admiration for one incredible lady.</i></b> <i><b>Let me know what you think! :)</b></i></p><p>He cannot recall meeting another lady like her. He cannot recall meeting another person like her. He has wanted to tell her on numerous occasions, too many to count, but he remembers her reaction in the Dragon Pit. The quiet smile traced on her lips, the gentle hope shining in her eyes. No, she is not like everyone else. She is the very best of them, in all that she does, and he swears that he will make sure she will never forget that, and that she will never question his belief in her. </p><p>He remembers that first day, walking into the Throne Room at Dragonstone, unsure of what to expect. The room vast and cavernous, a seemingly small slip of a woman seated on the stone chair; the shadows half covering her face not enough to swallow her, her presence seemingly filling the room, the cast of the stone unable to disguise her beauty as her impressive titles are announced to her invited guests. </p><p>He remembers the pleasantries, his surprise at her acceptance of what her father was, before his growing impatience turned into short words. He remembers wishing he had his furs over his shoulders, cursing himself for not remembering to put them on again after they had rowed to shore. He had grown used to the heavy cloak, it provided a weighted confidence he had still not become accustomed to; it helped him play the part of king. He remembers Daenerys standing when she had grown tired of his supposed insolence, her deliberate steps and the self belief puncturing her words to him. <i>Faith. Not in any god, not in myths and legends. In myself. Daenerys Targaryen</i>. He remembers the determination in her eyes. </p><p>He remembers brooding on that cliff top, feeling at a loss and as though he had failed his people already. He remembers the gentle slaps of wind on his face as he pondered Tyrion\u2019s words. He remembers his trepidation at seeking her out as she watched her children from afar. He remembers the awe he felt in his bones at the dragons in the distance; the amazement growing at the realisation she was responsible for bringing them into the world. He remembers his restrained joy at her permission to mine the dragon glass, the whisper of hope in his mind that maybe, just maybe, she did not think him a complete mad fool. He remembers the curl or warmth behind his ribs at her acknowledgment of his loss, the faces of his brothers as he had last seen them flashing in his mind. <i>You had better get to work Jon Snow</i>. </p><p>He remembers the evenings spent under candle light in a shared solar, a rare occurrence, the labour of mining the dragonglass causing a weary exhaustion to steadily seep into his bones. He sees her sat across the room from him, partaking in a game of cyvasse, or in light discussion with Tyrion and Missandei. He remembers thinking how the lick of the small flames illuminated her youth and reminded him of his own, the flicker of girlish joy crossing her face at her Hand\u2019s teasing tales. He remembers how it makes him feel lighter, and how he would bask in it for eternity if she were to ever look at him in the same way.</p><p>He remembers his deflation at her pledge to fight for him if he bent the knee. He remembers feeling startled as she spoke his words to Mance back to him. His respect for this lady, this queen, growing the more time he spent in her presence. <i>He also remembers the way the firelight danced across her face, adding a softness that had been absent in the harsh shadows of the Throne Room, the way the silver of her hair caught the ember glow, the way he longed to run his hands through it</i>. He knows he could stare forever. He remembers his shock on the beach at her request for council, the intensity with which she listened, at being softly stunned when she seemed to heed his advice. </p><p>He remembers the feeling of his growing admiration for the Queen. Hearing the words of Missandei and her reasons for following her, the complete conviction in her leader who had broken herself out of bondage, before breaking the chains of others. He recalls the soft, secretive smiles she had shared with her advisor, the way her eyes lit up at when something she is told brings her joy. Their belief in her unshakable, and Jon remembers the seeds of his esteem towards Daenerys beginning to bloom ever larger. </p><p>He remembers the awe vibrating through his being at seeing her atop her dragon, flying through the sky, looking majestic before landing on the bluff he was occupying. He is still not entirely sure what possessed him to hold out his hand to Drogon, for him to smell his scent before petting his burning snout. Stupidity or bravery, he is not sure, but something in him recognising Drogon and forcing him to reach out. He remembers the bitter stab of jealousy at seeing Daenerys welcoming and embracing Ser Jorah, reminding him rudely of his status and there\u2019s no time for that. He remembers the mornings he has awoke hard and wanting, the vividness and viscosity of her in his dreams chasing him into daylight. He also remembers Davos\u2019s knowing looks and staring at her <i>kind heart</i>.</p><p>He remembers his jubilation at the news of Bran and Arya in Winterfell being short lived and overshadowed by the news of the Night King. He remembers wanting to bask in the status of his siblings, but instead finding the ever present sorrow taking over at the realisation of what he must do. He remembers the pleading in Davos\u2019s eyes, the acceptance in Tyrion\u2019s. He remembers the catch of Daenerys\u2019s voice as she reminds him he needs her permission, him snuffing out the spark of hope in his chest before he asserts he needs no permission; he is a king. </p><p>He remembers their goodbye on the beach, his trying for nonchalance and avoiding her eyes, the screaming of his heart at his practiced indifference. He remembers pushing away from the shore, the tangle of his thoughts as he forced his gaze forward. <i>I cannot look back now, I may never want to leave</i>. He remembers telling himself the Queen was only remembering her courtesies, she could never think of him in that way. <i>He remembers the biting of his nails on his palms through his gloves, the only way to keep from reaching from her</i>.</p><p>He remembers the journey to Eastwatch, the endless running of his mind on what ifs and what could have beens. <i>Too late for that, you\u2019re just torturing yourself now lad</i>. He remembers the futile attempts at trying to push Daenerys from his consciousness, to try and focus on their purpose for coming North. He remembers trying to push away his unease at returning to The Wall. At trying to suppress the constant pricking of his skin at the mere idea of having to go beyond The Wall once more. He mostly remembers trying to force down the inclination that he misses Daenerys, with her hard confidence and the contradictory softness she tries to hide. The secret smiles, the empathy in her gaze; the understanding of their burden. <i>You don\u2019t even have the right to miss her</i> came his disdainful reply. </p><p>He remembers the hopelessness that overcame him in the middle of that lake, the acceptance that he was to die once again. He remembers the attempts to keep the exhaustion at bay, to keep fighting for as long as his body would allow. He remembers the soaring of his heart at the roar of her dragons, at the realisation that she had come. <i>She came for him</i>. He remembers reaching for her, her hand so close, the peril seemingly melting away, before remembering where they were, and forcing himself to do what he must and clear the path for everyone else. All of that quickly overtaken by anger and devastation when the Viserion is felled by the hand of the Night King. He remembers the humming silence, Daenerys dazed heartbreak, the blood singing in his veins. He remembers shouting for her to leave, running toward her before she took flight. He remembers the ice cold water seeping then soaking into his furs, encasing and trapping him. He remembers the chill trying to claim him. </p><p>He remembers his refusal to die like that, drowning and clawing for breath. He remembers the coldness in his bones as he awaited his final fight, the sight of a horse and flame enough for him to question his sanity. His realisation that it is Uncle Benjen brings elation, before it is quickly stamped out at his refusal to join him. </p><p>He remembers waking on the boat, Daenerys the first true thing he can ever recall seeing. He remembers the distress overcoming him at the sight of her sat at his bedside, the overwhelming need to comfort, the feel of her hand in his. He remembers the pressure of her grasp, the tears filling her eyes; the way she forces the words to pass her throat. He recalls the guilt scraping him raw inside. He remembers wondering when exactly she became Dany; when exactly, she became <i>his Queen</i>. </p><p>He remembers the wonder in her eyes, the disbelief etched on her face. <i>He remembers wondering when he started to miss the feel of her hand in his</i>. </p><p>He remembers marvelling at just how blind he had been; how he had allowed himself to wallow in denial. He remembers pondering what might have happened had Daenerys not pulled her hand away. <i>A dangerous path to go down</i> he chides himself. He remembers thinking about her kind and good heart, and just precisely when his admiration and respect had grown beyond into the realm of love.</p><p>He remembers the journey back to Dragonstone, the ache in his body from more than just his frolic beneath the ice. He remembers watching Daenerys from afar, afraid almost to approach her after what had transpired when he had first woke. He remembers trying to seek her gaze, a prick of hurt at the way her eyes seemingly avoid his. </p><p>He remembers the consuming reverence with which he watched her enter the Dragon Pit, the way with which held herself. How she did not allow herself to be cowed by the hostile setting. He recalls thinking about her speech to him when they first met, and how it would take more than a disgruntled unbelieving queen to have Daenerys Targaryen quaking where she stood. </p><p>He remembers the bile rising in his throat at the realisation of what he was about to do. <i>I cannot serve two queens</i>. He remembers the anger and disbelief rolling of Davos and Tyrion, the incredulity razor sharp from Dany. </p><p>He remembers wanting to hear her speak more Valyrian, to lose himself in the way her mouth contorted and her tongue wrapped around the unfamiliar sounds. <i>How it might sound being exerted in a more strenuous situation. </i></p><p>He remembers scoffing at her assertion that she was not extraordinary, that she would somehow be the last of her family. He remembers dismissing her declaration of being unable to have children. <i>The witch who murdered my husband</i>. He remembers wanting to tell her that it would never matter to him, <i>that she was what he wanted, whatever she would give him</i>. He remembers wondering when people started to take the word of so-called witches as infallible truth. </p><p>He remembers the anticipation crawling under his skin at her declaration, <i>we sail together</i>. They had come to an understanding, a silent exchange even he could decipher.</p><p>He remembers the nerves, the anxiety kicking his gut, making him question if he had misinterpreted the entire history of their interactions. He was disbelieving, that this incredible woman could even want him, that she should want him. What had he possibly done to deserve even an iota of her attention? He remembers pinching himself, hard, to make sure that this was real, and that he had not at some point passed over into an afterlife he knew did not exist. </p><p>He remembers standing in front on her door, his courage flailing in his chest, the fear of rejection a strong taste on his tongue. A deep breath finds his bravery, both hands clenching as he knocks on her ornate door. His nails dig into his palms as he waits. An eternity seems to pass, and then he hears the tap of the latch. The door swings open and her eyes do not immediately meet his. They snap up, and he can see the assuredness overcome her, mirroring his own acceptance. </p><p>He remembers knowing that once he stepped over the threshold, there would be no going back. He remembers not caring, of allowing himself to want, want her, want them together, everything else be damned. He remembers knowing in his very bones that they had been building to this point, slowly, but surely, and he could all but taste the crescendo, could feel it in the leaping knots of his stomach, the stutter of his heart. </p><p>He remembers thinking of the oncoming dark days, and how if this night was all they had, he would take it with both hands and hold it tight. He would allow it to warm him and soak his body during the frigid cold, the memory of the touch and taste of her. </p><p>He remembers when it hit him, truly, and he was able to latch onto the feeling and force his head to listen to his heart. <i>He loved her, and she loved him</i>. It was the only push he needed, all other voices, dissenting and otherwise silent. He remembers the stillness overcoming him, the mere thought of the love he held for Daenerys enough to invoke a peace he did not know existed. Her eyes lock on his and he sees the same emotions reflecting back, and Jon silently promises that he will not allow that spark to dull from her eyes. Daenerys Targaryen deserves everything she has ever wanted, and Jon vows he will spend the entirety of this lifetime and the next hundred ensuring she gets it, whatever it may be. </p><p>He remembers stepping through the door, then turning to close it. The sound of the latch locking into place, and Jon knows, in this moment, that being with Daenerys is the calm and peace he craves, and that he will do everything in his power to be the same for her. He accepts, that this woman has him heart, body and soul, and he remembers, as Daenerys sleeps in his arms, embracing fully this chance that fate has been determined to serve him. Daenerys is his, just as he is hers, and he vows then to never let go. </p>",

He remembers the bitter stab of jealousy at seeing Daenerys welcoming and embracing Ser Jorah, reminding him rudely of his status and there\u2019s no time for that. He remembers the mornings he has awoke hard and wanting, the vividness and viscosity of her in his dreams chasing him into daylight. He also remembers Davos\u2019s knowing looks and staring at her <i>kind heart</i>.</p><p>He remembers his jubilation at the news of Bran and Arya in Winterfell being short lived and overshadowed by the news of the Night King. He remembers wanting to bask in the status of his siblings, but instead finding the ever present sorrow taking over at the realisation of what he must do. He remembers the pleading in Davos\u2019s eyes, the acceptance in Tyrion\u2019s. He remembers the catch of Daenerys\u2019s voice as she reminds him he needs her permission, him snuffing out the spark of hope in his chest before he asserts he needs no permission; he is a king. </p><p>He remembers their goodbye on the beach, his trying for nonchalance and avoiding her eyes, the screaming of his heart at his practiced indifference. He remembers pushing away from the shore, the tangle of his thoughts as he forced his gaze forward. <i>I cannot look back now, I may never want to leave</i>. He remembers telling himself the Queen was only remembering her courtesies, she could never think of him in that way. <i>He remembers the biting of his nails on his palms through his gloves, the only way to keep from reaching from her</i>.</p><p>He remembers the journey to Eastwatch, the endless running of his mind on what ifs and what could have beens. <i>Too late for that, you\u2019re just torturing yourself now lad</i>. He remembers the futile attempts at trying to push Daenerys from his consciousness, to try and focus on their purpose for coming North. He remembers trying to push away his unease at returning to The Wall. At trying to suppress the constant pricking of his skin at the mere idea of having to go beyond The Wall once more. He mostly remembers trying to force down the inclination that he misses Daenerys, with her hard confidence and the contradictory softness she tries to hide. The secret smiles, the empathy in her gaze; the understanding of their burden. <i>You don\u2019t even have the right to miss her</i> came his disdainful reply. </p><p>He remembers the hopelessness that overcame him in the middle of that lake, the acceptance that he was to die once again. He remembers the attempts to keep the exhaustion at bay, to keep fighting for as long as his body would allow. He remembers the soaring of his heart at the roar of her dragons, at the realisation that she had come. <i>She came for him</i>. He remembers reaching for her, her hand so close, the peril seemingly melting away, before remembering where they were, and forcing himself to do what he must and clear the path for everyone else. All of that quickly overtaken by anger and devastation when the Viserion is felled by the hand of the Night King. He remembers the humming silence, Daenerys dazed heartbreak, the blood singing in his veins. He remembers shouting for her to leave, running toward her before she took flight. He remembers the ice cold water seeping then soaking into his furs, encasing and trapping him. He remembers the chill trying to claim him. </p><p>He remembers his refusal to die like that, drowning and clawing for breath. He remembers the coldness in his bones as he awaited his final fight, the sight of a horse and flame enough for him to question his sanity. His realisation that it is Uncle Benjen brings elation, before it is quickly stamped out at his refusal to join him. </p><p>He remembers waking on the boat, Daenerys the first true thing he can ever recall seeing. He remembers the distress overcoming him at the sight of her sat at his bedside, the overwhelming need to comfort, the feel of her hand in his. He remembers the pressure of her grasp, the tears filling her eyes; the way she forces the words to pass her throat. He recalls the guilt scraping him raw inside. He remembers wondering when exactly she became Dany; when exactly, she became <i>his Queen</i>. </p><p>He remembers the wonder in her eyes, the disbelief etched on her face. <i>He remembers wondering when he started to miss the feel of her hand in his</i>. </p><p>He remembers marvelling at just how blind he had been; how he had allowed himself to wallow in denial. He remembers pondering what might have happened had Daenerys not pulled her hand away. <i>A dangerous path to go down</i> he chides himself. He remembers thinking about her kind and good heart, and just precisely when his admiration and respect had grown beyond into the realm of love.</p><p>He remembers the journey back to Dragonstone, the ache in his body from more than just his frolic beneath the ice. He remembers watching Daenerys from afar, afraid almost to approach her after what had transpired when he had first woke. He remembers trying to seek her gaze, a prick of hurt at the way her eyes seemingly avoid his. </p><p>He remembers the consuming reverence with which he watched her enter the Dragon Pit, the way with which held herself. How she did not allow herself to be cowed by the hostile setting. He recalls thinking about her speech to him when they first met, and how it would take more than a disgruntled unbelieving queen to have Daenerys Targaryen quaking where she stood. </p><p>He remembers the bile rising in his throat at the realisation of what he was about to do. <i>I cannot serve two queens</i>. He remembers the anger and disbelief rolling of Davos and Tyrion, the incredulity razor sharp from Dany. </p><p>He remembers wanting to hear her speak more Valyrian, to lose himself in the way her mouth contorted and her tongue wrapped around the unfamiliar sounds. <i>How it might sound being exerted in a more strenuous situation. </i></p><p>He remembers scoffing at her assertion that she was not extraordinary, that she would somehow be the last of her family. He remembers dismissing her declaration of being unable to have children. <i>The witch who murdered my husband</i>. He remembers wanting to tell her that it would never matter to him, <i>that she was what he wanted, whatever she would give him</i>. He remembers wondering when people started to take the word of so-called witches as infallible truth. </p><p>He remembers the anticipation crawling under his skin at her declaration, <i>we sail together</i>. They had come to an understanding, a silent exchange even he could decipher.</p><p>He remembers the nerves, the anxiety kicking his gut, making him question if he had misinterpreted the entire history of their interactions. He was disbelieving, that this incredible woman could even want him, that she should want him. What had he possibly done to deserve even an iota of her attention? He remembers pinching himself, hard, to make sure that this was real, and that he had not at some point passed over into an afterlife he knew did not exist. </p><p>He remembers standing in front on her door, his courage flailing in his chest, the fear of rejection a strong taste on his tongue. A deep breath finds his bravery, both hands clenching as he knocks on her ornate door. His nails dig into his palms as he waits. An eternity seems to pass, and then he hears the tap of the latch. The door swings open and her eyes do not immediately meet his. They snap up, and he can see the assuredness overcome her, mirroring his own acceptance. </p><p>He remembers knowing that once he stepped over the threshold, there would be no going back. He remembers not caring, of allowing himself to want, want her, want them together, everything else be damned. He remembers knowing in his very bones that they had been building to this point, slowly, but surely, and he could all but taste the crescendo, could feel it in the leaping knots of his stomach, the stutter of his heart. </p><p>He remembers thinking of the oncoming dark days, and how if this night was all they had, he would take it with both hands and hold it tight. He would allow it to warm him and soak his body during the frigid cold, the memory of the touch and taste of her. </p><p>He remembers when it hit him, truly, and he was able to latch onto the feeling and force his head to listen to his heart. <i>He loved her, and she loved him</i>. It was the only push he needed, all other voices, dissenting and otherwise silent. He remembers the stillness overcoming him, the mere thought of the love he held for Daenerys enough to invoke a peace he did not know existed. Her eyes lock on his and he sees the same emotions reflecting back, and Jon silently promises that he will not allow that spark to dull from her eyes. Daenerys Targaryen deserves everything she has ever wanted, and Jon vows he will spend the entirety of this lifetime and the next hundred ensuring she gets it, whatever it may be. </p><p>He remembers stepping through the door, then turning to close it. The sound of the latch locking into place, and Jon knows, in this moment, that being with Daenerys is the calm and peace he craves, and that he will do everything in his power to be the same for her. He accepts, that this woman has him heart, body and soul, and he remembers, as Daenerys sleeps in his arms, embracing fully this chance that fate has been determined to serve him. Daenerys is his, just as he is hers, and he vows then to never let go. </p></p>",

So annoyed was I that I stayed up until 4:30 am writing the bulk of this so apologies if it seems a little scattered and messy. I have read through this, but I\u2019ve probably missed stuff. Basically just Jon Snow and his growing admiration for one incredible lady.</i></b> <i><b>Let me know what you think! :)</b></i></p><p>He cannot recall meeting another lady like her. He cannot recall meeting another person like her. He has wanted to tell her on numerous occasions, too many to count, but he remembers her reaction in the Dragon Pit. The quiet smile traced on her lips, the gentle hope shining in her eyes. No, she is not like everyone else. She is the very best of them, in all that she does, and he swears that he will make sure she will never forget that, and that she will never question his belief in her. </p><p>He remembers that first day, walking into the Throne Room at Dragonstone, unsure of what to expect. The room vast and cavernous, a seemingly small slip of a woman seated on the stone chair; the shadows half covering her face not enough to swallow her, her presence seemingly filling the room, the cast of the stone unable to disguise her beauty as her impressive titles are announced to her invited guests. </p><p>He remembers the pleasantries, his surprise at her acceptance of what her father was, before his growing impatience turned into short words. He remembers wishing he had his furs over his shoulders, cursing himself for not remembering to put them on again after they had rowed to shore. He had grown used to the heavy cloak, it provided a weighted confidence he had still not become accustomed to; it helped him play the part of king. He remembers Daenerys standing when she had grown tired of his supposed insolence, her deliberate steps and the self belief puncturing her words to him. <i>Faith. Not in any god, not in myths and legends. In myself. Daenerys Targaryen</i>. He remembers the determination in her eyes. </p><p>He remembers brooding on that cliff top, feeling at a loss and as though he had failed his people already. He remembers the gentle slaps of wind on his face as he pondered Tyrion\u2019s words. He remembers his trepidation at seeking her out as she watched her children from afar. He remembers the awe he felt in his bones at the dragons in the distance; the amazement growing at the realisation she was responsible for bringing them into the world. He remembers his restrained joy at her permission to mine the dragon glass, the whisper of hope in his mind that maybe, just maybe, she did not think him a complete mad fool. He remembers the curl or warmth behind his ribs at her acknowledgment of his loss, the faces of his brothers as he had last seen them flashing in his mind. <i>You had better get to work Jon Snow</i>. </p><p>He remembers the evenings spent under candle light in a shared solar, a rare occurrence, the labour of mining the dragonglass causing a weary exhaustion to steadily seep into his bones. He sees her sat across the room from him, partaking in a game of cyvasse, or in light discussion with Tyrion and Missandei. He remembers thinking how the lick of the small flames illuminated her youth and reminded him of his own, the flicker of girlish joy crossing her face at her Hand\u2019s teasing tales. He remembers how it makes him feel lighter, and how he would bask in it for eternity if she were to ever look at him in the same way.</p><p>He remembers his deflation at her pledge to fight for him if he bent the knee. He remembers feeling startled as she spoke his words to Mance back to him. His respect for this lady, this queen, growing the more time he spent in her presence. <i>He also remembers the way the firelight danced across her face, adding a softness that had been absent in the harsh shadows of the Throne Room, the way the silver of her hair caught the ember glow, the way he longed to run his hands through it</i>. He knows he could stare forever. He remembers his shock on the beach at her request for council, the intensity with which she listened, at being softly stunned when she seemed to heed his advice. </p><p>He remembers the feeling of his growing admiration for the Queen. Hearing the words of Missandei and her reasons for following her, the complete conviction in her leader who had broken herself out of bondage, before breaking the chains of others. He recalls the soft, secretive smiles she had shared with her advisor, the way her eyes lit up at when something she is told brings her joy. Their belief in her unshakable, and Jon remembers the seeds of his esteem towards Daenerys beginning to bloom ever larger. </p><p>He remembers the awe vibrating through his being at seeing her atop her dragon, flying through the sky, looking majestic before landing on the bluff he was occupying.

He is still not entirely sure what possessed him to hold out his hand to Drogon, for him to smell his scent before petting his burning snout. Stupidity or bravery, he is not sure, but something in him recognising Drogon and forcing him to reach out. He remembers the bitter stab of jealousy at seeing Daenerys welcoming and embracing Ser Jorah, reminding him rudely of his status and there&rsquo;s no time for that. He remembers the mornings he has awoke hard and wanting, the vividness and viscosity of her in his dreams chasing him into daylight. He also remembers Davos&rsquo;s knowing looks and staring at her <i>kind heart</i>.</p><p>He remembers his jubilation at the news of Bran and Arya in Winterfell being short lived and overshadowed by the news of the Night King. He remembers wanting to bask in the status of his siblings, but instead finding the ever present sorrow taking over at the realisation of what he must do. He remembers the pleading in Davos&rsquo;s eyes, the acceptance in Tyrion&rsquo;s. He remembers the catch of Daenerys&rsquo;s voice as she reminds him he needs her permission, him snuffing out the spark of hope in his chest before he asserts he needs no permission; he is a king. </p><p>He remembers their goodbye on the beach, his trying for nonchalance and avoiding her eyes, the screaming of his heart at his practiced indifference. He remembers pushing away from the shore, the tangle of his thoughts as he forced his gaze forward. <i>I cannot look back now, I may never want to leave</i>. He remembers telling himself the Queen was only remembering her courtesies, she could never think of him in that way. <i>He remembers the biting of his nails on his palms through his gloves, the only way to keep from reaching from her</i>.</p><p>He remembers the journey to Eastwatch, the endless running of his mind on what ifs and what could have beens. <i>Too late for that, you&rsquo;re just torturing yourself now lad</i>. He remembers the futile attempts at trying to push Daenerys from his consciousness, to try and focus on their purpose for coming North. He remembers trying to push away his unease at returning to The Wall. At trying to suppress the constant pricking of his skin at the mere idea of having to go beyond The Wall once more. He mostly remembers trying to force down the inclination that he misses Daenerys, with her hard confidence and the contradictory softness she tries to hide. The secret smiles, the empathy in her gaze; the understanding of their burden. <i>You don&rsquo;t even have the right to miss her</i> came his disdainful reply. </p><p>He remembers the hopelessness that overcame him in the middle of that lake, the acceptance that he was to die once again. He remembers the attempts to keep the exhaustion at bay, to keep fighting for as long as his body would allow. He remembers the soaring of his heart at the roar of her dragons, at the realisation that she had come. <i>She came for him</i>. He remembers reaching for her, her hand so close, the peril seemingly melting away, before remembering where they were, and forcing himself to do what he must and clear the path for everyone else. All of that quickly overtaken by anger and devastation when the Viserion is felled by the hand of the Night King. He remembers the humming silence, Daenerys dazed heartbreak, the blood singing in his veins. He remembers shouting for her to leave, running toward her before she took flight. He remembers the ice cold water seeping then soaking into his furs, encasing and trapping him. He remembers the chill trying to claim him. </p><p>He remembers his refusal to die like that, drowning and clawing for breath. He remembers the coldness in his bones as he awaited his final fight, the sight of a horse and flame enough for him to question his sanity. His realisation that it is Uncle Benjen brings elation, before it is quickly stamped out at his refusal to join him. </p><p>He remembers waking on the boat, Daenerys the first true thing he can ever recall seeing. He remembers the distress overcoming him at the sight of her sat at his bedside, the overwhelming need to comfort, the feel of her hand in his. He remembers the pressure of her grasp, the tears filling her eyes; the way she forces the words to pass her throat. He recalls the guilt scraping him raw inside. He remembers wondering when exactly she became Dany; when exactly, she became <i>his Queen</i>. </p><p>He remembers the wonder in her eyes, the disbelief etched on her face. <i>He remembers wondering when he started to miss the feel of her hand in his</i>. </p><p>He remembers marvelling at just how blind he had been; how he had allowed himself to wallow in denial. He remembers pondering what might have happened had Daenerys not pulled her hand away. <i>A dangerous path to go down</i> he chides himself. He remembers thinking about her kind and good heart, and just precisely when his admiration and respect had grown beyond into the realm of love.</p><p>He remembers the journey back to Dragonstone, the ache in his body from more than just his frolic beneath the ice. He remembers watching Daenerys from afar, afraid almost to approach her after what had transpired when he had first woke. He remembers trying to seek her gaze, a prick of hurt at the way her eyes seemingly avoid his. </p><p>He remembers the consuming reverence with which he watched her enter the Dragon Pit, the way with which held herself. How she did not allow herself to be cowed by the hostile setting. He recalls thinking about her speech to him when they first met, and how it would take more than a disgruntled unbelieving queen to have Daenerys Targaryen quaking where she stood. </p><p>He remembers the bile rising in his throat at the realisation of what he was about to do. <i>I cannot serve two queens</i>. He remembers the anger and disbelief rolling of Davos and Tyrion, the incredulity razor sharp from Dany. </p><p>He remembers wanting to hear her speak more Valyrian, to lose himself in the way her mouth contorted and her tongue wrapped around the unfamiliar sounds. <i>How it might sound being exerted in a more strenuous situation. </i></p><p>He remembers scoffing at her assertion that she was not extraordinary, that she would somehow be the last of her family. He remembers dismissing her declaration of being unable to have children. <i>The witch who murdered my husband</i>. He remembers wanting to tell her that it would never matter to him, <i>that she was what he wanted, whatever she would give him</i>. He remembers wondering when people started to take the word of so-called witches as infallible truth. </p><p>He remembers the anticipation crawling under his skin at her declaration, <i>we sail together</i>. They had come to an understanding, a silent exchange even he could decipher.</p><p>He remembers the nerves, the anxiety kicking his gut, making him question if he had misinterpreted the entire history of their interactions. He was disbelieving, that this incredible woman could even want him, that she should want him. What had he possibly done to deserve even an iota of her attention? He remembers pinching himself, hard, to make sure that this was real, and that he had not at some point passed over into an afterlife he knew did not exist. </p><p>He remembers standing in front on her door, his courage flailing in his chest, the fear of rejection a strong taste on his tongue. A deep breath finds his bravery, both hands clenching as he knocks on her ornate door. His nails dig into his palms as he waits. An eternity seems to pass, and then he hears the tap of the latch. The door swings open and her eyes do not immediately meet his. They snap up, and he can see the assuredness overcome her, mirroring his own acceptance. </p><p>He remembers knowing that once he stepped over the threshold, there would be no going back. He remembers not caring, of allowing himself to want, want her, want them together, everything else be damned. He remembers knowing in his very bones that they had been building to this point, slowly, but surely, and he could all but taste the crescendo, could feel it in the leaping knots of his stomach, the stutter of his heart. </p><p>He remembers thinking of the oncoming dark days, and how if this night was all they had, he would take it with both hands and hold it tight. He would allow it to warm him and soak his body during the frigid cold, the memory of the touch and taste of her. </p><p>He remembers when it hit him, truly, and he was able to latch onto the feeling and force his head to listen to his heart. <i>He loved her, and she loved him</i>. It was the only push he needed, all other voices, dissenting and otherwise silent. He remembers the stillness overcoming him, the mere thought of the love he held for Daenerys enough to invoke a peace he did not know existed. Her eyes lock on his and he sees the same emotions reflecting back, and Jon silently promises that he will not allow that spark to dull from her eyes. Daenerys Targaryen deserves everything she has ever wanted, and Jon vows he will spend the entirety of this lifetime and the next hundred ensuring she gets it, whatever it may be. </p><p>He remembers stepping through the door, then turning to close it. The sound of the latch locking into place, and Jon knows, in this moment, that being with Daenerys is the calm and peace he craves, and that he will do everything in his power to be the same for her. He accepts, that this woman has him heart, body and soul, and he remembers, as Daenerys sleeps in his arms, embracing fully this chance that fate has been determined to serve him. Daenerys is his, just as he is hers, and he vows then to never let go. </p>",

        "body": "<h1>Why favouritism sucks</h1><p>Recently I came across a video where J.K Rowling was talking about the movies of Hp with Daniel Radcliffe and Steve Kloves, the writer of the Hp movie scripts.</p><p>And something caught my attention. Steve said that his favourite character was not Harry but in fact it was Hermione. And that is when I understood why movie!Hermione is the way she is. </p><p>We know in the books Hermione is smart, independent, brave and strong. However she\u2019s still far from perfect. She has lots of flaws, including lack of empathy, emotional breakdowns during times of crisis, arrogance and narrow mindedness. </p><p>Albeit, in the movies those negative traits are completely absent. Instead she\u2019s the most sensitive and empathetic of the trio, level headed in times of stress and only acts like a know it all in the first movie which makes her totally unrelatable as a character because she\u2019s just perfect. Now that\u2019s not even my main issue here. What really bothers me is how Hermione\u2019s flawless nature affects other character\u2019s portrayal therefore how they\u2019re perceived by the audience. Aside from the fact that Hermione being too flawless takes away her authenticity, it\u2019s also at the expense of other characters. Best example: Ron Weasley. </p><p>A lot of great moments in the books that Ron had were given to Hermione in the movies (like in the 3rd movie when Hermione defended Harry in front of Lupin and Sirius or in the 1st movie when she instantly came up with the spell that saved Ron\u2019s life, even though in the books she freaked out and Ron was the one who calmed her down). So obviously a lot of people that have only watched the movies don\u2019t really care about Ron and think he\u2019s useless. At the same time Hermione is their fave because she\u2019s fierce and smart and sweet (not to mention absolutely beautiful which is also a deviation from the books). And that whole mischaracterization comes from the fact that Hermione was the writer\u2019s fave. She was completely whitewashed since being the writer\u2019s fave results in idealisation and ignorance of flaws. </p><p>That is a huge problem that I\u2019ve also encountered in GoT. The character that is the writer\u2019s fave (D&amp;D and Brian Cogman\u2019s in particular) is Sansa Stark. Beforehand I don\u2019t have a problem with book!Sansa. I actually like her. She\u2019s realistic and fully fleshed out. Show!Sansa however is portrayed as way more compassionate, fierce and superior. I wouldn\u2019t even have a problem with that IF it wasn\u2019t at the expense of other characters, particularly Jon and Arya. They took a lot of elements from Arya\u2019s arc that were only relevant and crucial in her story and gave them to Sansa (the lone wolf speech that was only given to Arya and only appears in her chapters because she is the most pack and family-oriented and fully identifies as a wolf, Sansa as the key to the north even though in the books they emphasise Sansa as being the one with the weakest connection to the north and Arya even being the one that got married off to Ramsay though it was not really Arya but that\u2019s what was believed). They also changed Arya and Sansa\u2019s dynamic and turned Arya into the \u201cproblem\u201d by making her mean and resentful towards Sansa despite it being the other way around in the books. That was in order to make Sansa more likeable and sympathetic. </p><p>Moreover, Sansa is also shown as the \u201csmartest Stark\u201d and clearly superior to the rest. But that\u2019s really not true at all. Arya is incredibly smart and perceptive, she is good at math and knows how to solve problems with cunning and stealth, Jon is a military strategist and Bran is also very wise and insightful. In the show however, they tend to dumb down all the characters that interact with Sansa in order to establish her intelligence and intellectual superiority. (I mean Sansa knowing more about armor than actual armorers that are dealing with this their whole life? Really?) </p><p>That again is the consequence of favouritism. It has come to the point where I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised anymore if Sansa suddenly knew more about ruling and warfare than Dany even though she\u2019s a Queen and knows all about conquering (at least more than Sansa). </p><p>As I\u2019ve already mentioned my problem is not really Sansa\u2019s flawlessness it\u2019s more how that affects other characters\u2019 story lines and personalities. If Arya and Jon were still true to their book counterparts when interacting with Sansa, I would even be fine with that. But that\u2019s not the case. Jon turns into a  dumb idiot and Arya an irrational rage ball when sharing a scene with Sansa. And that change is solely made to prop up Sansa because she\u2019s the show writers\u2019 favourite character (which is also a contradiction in itself because if she was their fave then why would they change her and her story line?). </p><p>My point is favouritism does not just negatively affect the character that\u2019s favoured but also every other character. </p>",

But that\u2019s really not true at all. Arya is incredibly smart and perceptive, she is good at math and knows how to solve problems with cunning and stealth, Jon is a military strategist and Bran is also very wise and insightful.

If Arya and Jon were still true to their book counterparts when interacting with Sansa, I would even be fine with that. But that\u2019s not the case. Jon turns into a  dumb idiot and Arya an irrational rage ball when sharing a scene with Sansa. And that change is solely made to prop up Sansa because she\u2019s the show writers\u2019 favourite character (which is also a contradiction in itself because if she was their fave then why would they change her and her story line?). </p><p>My point is favouritism does not just negatively affect the character that\u2019s favoured but also every other character. </p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Why favouritism sucks</h1><p>Recently I came across a video where J.K Rowling was talking about the movies of Hp with Daniel Radcliffe and Steve Kloves, the writer of the Hp movie scripts.</p><p>And something caught my attention. Steve said that his favourite character was not Harry but in fact it was Hermione. And that is when I understood why movie!Hermione is the way she is. </p><p>We know in the books Hermione is smart, independent, brave and strong. However she&rsquo;s still far from perfect. She has lots of flaws, including lack of empathy, emotional breakdowns during times of crisis, arrogance and narrow mindedness. </p><p>Albeit, in the movies those negative traits are completely absent. Instead she&rsquo;s the most sensitive and empathetic of the trio, level headed in times of stress and only acts like a know it all in the first movie which makes her totally unrelatable as a character because she&rsquo;s just perfect. Now that&rsquo;s not even my main issue here. What really bothers me is how Hermione&rsquo;s flawless nature affects other character&rsquo;s portrayal therefore how they&rsquo;re perceived by the audience. Aside from the fact that Hermione being too flawless takes away her authenticity, it&rsquo;s also at the expense of other characters. Best example: Ron Weasley. </p><p>A lot of great moments in the books that Ron had were given to Hermione in the movies (like in the 3rd movie when Hermione defended Harry in front of Lupin and Sirius or in the 1st movie when she instantly came up with the spell that saved Ron&rsquo;s life, even though in the books she freaked out and Ron was the one who calmed her down). So obviously a lot of people that have only watched the movies don&rsquo;t really care about Ron and think he&rsquo;s useless. At the same time Hermione is their fave because she&rsquo;s fierce and smart and sweet (not to mention absolutely beautiful which is also a deviation from the books). And that whole mischaracterization comes from the fact that Hermione was the writer&rsquo;s fave. She was completely whitewashed since being the writer&rsquo;s fave results in idealisation and ignorance of flaws. </p><p>That is a huge problem that I&rsquo;ve also encountered in GoT. The character that is the writer&rsquo;s fave (D&amp;D and Brian Cogman&rsquo;s in particular) is Sansa Stark. Beforehand I don&rsquo;t have a problem with book!Sansa. I actually like her. She&rsquo;s realistic and fully fleshed out. Show!Sansa however is portrayed as way more compassionate, fierce and superior. I wouldn&rsquo;t even have a problem with that IF it wasn&rsquo;t at the expense of other characters, particularly Jon and Arya. They took a lot of elements from Arya&rsquo;s arc that were only relevant and crucial in her story and gave them to Sansa (the lone wolf speech that was only given to Arya and only appears in her chapters because she is the most pack and family-oriented and fully identifies as a wolf, Sansa as the key to the north even though in the books they emphasise Sansa as being the one with the weakest connection to the north and Arya even being the one that got married off to Ramsay though it was not really Arya but that&rsquo;s what was believed). They also changed Arya and Sansa&rsquo;s dynamic and turned Arya into the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; by making her mean and resentful towards Sansa despite it being the other way around in the books. That was in order to make Sansa more likeable and sympathetic. </p><p>Moreover, Sansa is also shown as the &ldquo;smartest Stark&rdquo; and clearly superior to the rest. But that&rsquo;s really not true at all. Arya is incredibly smart and perceptive, she is good at math and knows how to solve problems with cunning and stealth, Jon is a military strategist and Bran is also very wise and insightful. In the show however, they tend to dumb down all the characters that interact with Sansa in order to establish her intelligence and intellectual superiority.
