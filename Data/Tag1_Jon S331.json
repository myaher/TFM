In fact, when he was fully recovered and able to pledge to Dany, he made it a point of doing so, in front of everyone at the Dragonpit, regardless of the risk with ruining the alliance. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m 100% sure that Undercover Jon just isn\u2019t happening.  There\u2019s no reason for it.  Jon already had everything he needed (Dany\u2019s army, dragons, and dragonglass) before he chose to bend the knee and he would never be intimate with a woman he didn\u2019t truly love.

Jon uses this excuse to shut Stannis up on the topic,\nbut the reason he refuses Stannis\u2019 offer is because Stannis demands that Jon\nburn the Winterfell Godswoods. Kindly read Jon\u2019s ASoS and ADwD chapters where\nJon actually debates the issue and nowhere in his POV is Sansa a consideration\n\u2013 ultimately it\u2019s his fealty to the Old Gods and his oaths that makes him\nrefuse Stannis. </p><p>3. <i>Jon and Sansa really care about each other</i>:\nNo, they don\u2019t. When Sansa is finally reminded of Jon at the end of book five\nshe thinks - <i>She had not thought of Jon\nin ages. He was only her half brother, but still &hellip; with Robb and Bran and\nRickon dead, Jon Snow was the only brother that remained to her. </i>Even here\nshe has reservations about Jon and only thinks that it would be sweet to see\nhim because all her real brothers were dead. She has been masquerading as a\nbastard in the Vale for months and yet never once thinks of or remembers the\nbastard brother she grew up with and who she treated as less than because of his birth. It is the same with Jon. When informed by\nStannis about the Sansa/Tyrion marriage, Jon leaves the room and thinks on how\nTyrion is doing as a kinslayer! He cannot spare one single thought to the\nsister who has been forced into marriage to the imp. Compare his utter\nindifference here to Cat and Robb\u2019s anger on hearing about the Sansa\u2019s\nmarriage. Robb wanted to take off Tyrion\u2019s head. Jon is not bothered.\u00a0 Jon and Sansa hardly think of each other and\ntheir plots have no connection in the books. </p><p>4. <i>Sansa\nthinking that the howling of the wind in the Eyrie sounds like a Ghost wolf:</i>\nApparently this means that Sansa is feeling Jon dying or something like that.\nOne, this takes place in AFfC before Jon gets killed in ADwD (the latter half of ADwD takes place after AFfC). So Jon\nis not dying when Sansa hears the wind. Two, Catelyn also compares the same\nhowling wind in the Eyrie to a wolf and three, Arya also compares the howling\nwind to a wolf in the Riverlands. GRRM apparently likes to compare the howling\nof the wind to the howling of a wolf. On the other hand, you know who actually\nhears a wolf at the same time Jon is dying in the snow in ADwD? - <i>Off in the\ndistance, a wolf howled. <b>The sound made her feel sad and lonely,</b> but no\nless hungry.</i></p><p>5.\u00a0\u00a0 <i>The drifting\nsnowflakes that brushed Sansa\u2019s face like lover\u2019s kisses foreshadows Jon/Sansa\nbecause the <b>snowflakes</b> here signify\nJon Snow</i>: Sansa\u2019s last chapter in ASoS happens on a snowy, magical\nmorning in the Vale. Sansa wakes &ldquo;all at once, every nerve atingle.&rdquo;\nAnd she&rsquo;s in a romantic mood already. The setting is ethereal and Sansa\ndescribes the <i>snowflakes drifting down as\nsoft and silent as memory. </i> She\nremembers Robb and <i>the melting flakes in\nhis hair when he hugged me. </i>She remembers <i>the snowflakes swirling around her</i> as she leaves Winterfell. For\nSansa the purity of the snow signifies her memories of innocence and Winterfell\n- <i>She could feel the snow on her lashes,\ntaste it on her lips<b>. It was the taste\nof Winterfell</b>. <b>The taste of\ninnocence. The taste of dreams. </b></i>Sansa\u2019s last chapter in ASoS, where she\nbuilds a snow castle destroyed by SweetRobin had everything to do with her\nmemories of Winterfell and her siblings and little to do with foreshadowing a relationship\nwith Jon Snow. If we are talking about kisses and Sansa, <i>the Unkiss</i> is far more\npopular in fandom lore.</p><p>6. <i>GRRM for some strange reason replaced the\nArya from his original outline with Sansa</i>: An earlier post shows why this\nis false, but to reiterate, GRRM is still aiming for the same ending that he\ncame up with in the early nineties. As he has always maintained, he has known what\nJon, Tyrion and Arya\u2019s journeys are and where they end up from the moment he\nstarted writing the first book. GRRM has invested in the Jon/Arya relationship\nfor over 5 books and once Dany gets to Westeros and meets up with Jon we are\ngetting Jon/Dany as well. </p><p>7. <i>Jon and Sansa have so many things in common:</i>\nThey don\u2019t. We are constantly told about how Jon and Sansa want to marry and\nhave children \u2013 well, so do most of the characters in the world of Westeros.\nDany wants children and a house with a red door. Tyrion wants family and home.\nSo does Jaime and Cersei. Even Bran. But the thing is that Jon forgoes his\ndesires, refuses Stannis\u2019 offer and decides to do his duty. It is only his love\nfor Arya that pushes him to break his oaths. Meanwhile Sansa is busy getting\nenmeshed in LF\u2019s plots in the Vale and knowingly or unknowingly is slowly\npoisoning her little cousin. </p><p>So the books have basically zero\nforeshadowing or connection between Jon and Sansa. Just a very selective\nreading of the text and hyperbolic extrapolations to make connections between\nthem. </p><p>And even the show has never\nreally demonstrated any special bond or love between Jon and Sansa. From the\ntime after they met, Jon and Sansa have done nothing but argue and fight. In\nseason 6, Sansa lies to Jon about something very important and starts off\nseason 7 by undermining him in front of the Lords and comparing him to Joffrey.\nJon agrees to fight Ramsay to save Rickon and not for Sansa. Jon has no issues\nbecoming KITN over Sansa and she resents him for that. When Arya gets to\nWinterfell, the show frames it as Jon/Arya Vs Sansa \u2013 with Sansa complaining\nabout Jon and Arya sticking up for him. Sansa herself talks about how much Jon\nloves Arya (His heart would stop upon seeing her) compared to her and how Arya\nwould kill her if Sansa tried to depose Jon. So therefore it is not only book\ncanon, but also show canon that Jon and Arya love each other dearly. </p><p>That\u2019s why Jonsa makes no sense\nand never has. The show has never made the case for it. They have characters\nopenly talking about how much Jon and Arya and Jon and Dany love each other,\nbut no one in the world of GOT apparently knows that there is this great\nromance \u2013 Jonsa \u2013 happening right under their nose! Amazing really. </p>",

Jon uses this excuse to shut Stannis up on the topic,\nbut the reason he refuses Stannis\u2019 offer is because Stannis demands that Jon\nburn the Winterfell Godswoods. Kindly read Jon\u2019s ASoS and ADwD chapters where\nJon actually debates the issue and nowhere in his POV is Sansa a consideration\n\u2013 ultimately it\u2019s his fealty to the Old Gods and his oaths that makes him\nrefuse Stannis. </p><p>3. <i>Jon and Sansa really care about each other</i>:\nNo, they don\u2019t. When Sansa is finally reminded of Jon at the end of book five\nshe thinks - <i>She had not thought of Jon\nin ages. He was only her half brother, but still \u2026 with Robb and Bran and\nRickon dead, Jon Snow was the only brother that remained to her. </i>Even here\nshe has reservations about Jon and only thinks that it would be sweet to see\nhim because all her real brothers were dead. She has been masquerading as a\nbastard in the Vale for months and yet never once thinks of or remembers the\nbastard brother she grew up with and who she treated as less than because of his birth. It is the same with Jon. When informed by\nStannis about the Sansa/Tyrion marriage, Jon leaves the room and thinks on how\nTyrion is doing as a kinslayer! He cannot spare one single thought to the\nsister who has been forced into marriage to the imp. Compare his utter\nindifference here to Cat and Robb\u2019s anger on hearing about the Sansa\u2019s\nmarriage. Robb wanted to take off Tyrion\u2019s head. Jon is not bothered.\u00a0 Jon and Sansa hardly think of each other and\ntheir plots have no connection in the books. </p><p>4. <i>Sansa\nthinking that the howling of the wind in the Eyrie sounds like a Ghost wolf:</i>\nApparently this means that Sansa is feeling Jon dying or something like that.\nOne, this takes place in AFfC before Jon gets killed in ADwD (the latter half of ADwD takes place after AFfC). So Jon\nis not dying when Sansa hears the wind. Two, Catelyn also compares the same\nhowling wind in the Eyrie to a wolf and three, Arya also compares the howling\nwind to a wolf in the Riverlands. GRRM apparently likes to compare the howling\nof the wind to the howling of a wolf. On the other hand, you know who actually\nhears a wolf at the same time Jon is dying in the snow in ADwD? - <i>Off in the\ndistance, a wolf howled. <b>The sound made her feel sad and lonely,</b> but no\nless hungry.</i></p><p>5.\u00a0\u00a0 <i>The drifting\nsnowflakes that brushed Sansa\u2019s face like lover\u2019s kisses foreshadows Jon/Sansa\nbecause the <b>snowflakes</b> here signify\nJon Snow</i>: Sansa\u2019s last chapter in ASoS happens on a snowy, magical\nmorning in the Vale. Sansa wakes \u201call at once, every nerve atingle.\u201d\nAnd she\u2019s in a romantic mood already. The setting is ethereal and Sansa\ndescribes the <i>snowflakes drifting down as\nsoft and silent as memory. </i> She\nremembers Robb and <i>the melting flakes in\nhis hair when he hugged me. </i>She remembers <i>the snowflakes swirling around her</i> as she leaves Winterfell. For\nSansa the purity of the snow signifies her memories of innocence and Winterfell\n- <i>She could feel the snow on her lashes,\ntaste it on her lips<b>. It was the taste\nof Winterfell</b>. <b>The taste of\ninnocence. The taste of dreams. </b></i>Sansa\u2019s last chapter in ASoS, where she\nbuilds a snow castle destroyed by SweetRobin had everything to do with her\nmemories of Winterfell and her siblings and little to do with foreshadowing a relationship\nwith Jon Snow. If we are talking about kisses and Sansa, <i>the Unkiss</i> is far more\npopular in fandom lore.</p><p>6. <i>GRRM for some strange reason replaced the\nArya from his original outline with Sansa</i>: An earlier post shows why this\nis false, but to reiterate, GRRM is still aiming for the same ending that he\ncame up with in the early nineties. As he has always maintained, he has known what\nJon, Tyrion and Arya\u2019s journeys are and where they end up from the moment he\nstarted writing the first book. GRRM has invested in the Jon/Arya relationship\nfor over 5 books and once Dany gets to Westeros and meets up with Jon we are\ngetting Jon/Dany as well. </p><p>7. <i>Jon and Sansa have so many things in common:</i>\nThey don\u2019t. We are constantly told about how Jon and Sansa want to marry and\nhave children \u2013 well, so do most of the characters in the world of Westeros.\nDany wants children and a house with a red door. Tyrion wants family and home.\nSo does Jaime and Cersei. Even Bran. But the thing is that Jon forgoes his\ndesires, refuses Stannis\u2019 offer and decides to do his duty. It is only his love\nfor Arya that pushes him to break his oaths. Meanwhile Sansa is busy getting\nenmeshed in LF\u2019s plots in the Vale and knowingly or unknowingly is slowly\npoisoning her little cousin. </p><p>So the books have basically zero\nforeshadowing or connection between Jon and Sansa. Just a very selective\nreading of the text and hyperbolic extrapolations to make connections between\nthem. </p><p>And even the show has never\nreally demonstrated any special bond or love between Jon and Sansa. From the\ntime after they met, Jon and Sansa have done nothing but argue and fight. In\nseason 6, Sansa lies to Jon about something very important and starts off\nseason 7 by undermining him in front of the Lords and comparing him to Joffrey.\nJon agrees to fight Ramsay to save Rickon and not for Sansa. Jon has no issues\nbecoming KITN over Sansa and she resents him for that. When Arya gets to\nWinterfell, the show frames it as Jon/Arya Vs Sansa \u2013 with Sansa complaining\nabout Jon and Arya sticking up for him. Sansa herself talks about how much Jon\nloves Arya (His heart would stop upon seeing her) compared to her and how Arya\nwould kill her if Sansa tried to depose Jon. So therefore it is not only book\ncanon, but also show canon that Jon and Arya love each other dearly. </p><p>That\u2019s why Jonsa makes no sense\nand never has. The show has never made the case for it. They have characters\nopenly talking about how much Jon and Arya and Jon and Dany love each other,\nbut no one in the world of GOT apparently knows that there is this great\nromance \u2013 Jonsa \u2013 happening right under their nose! Amazing really. </p>",
