It will not kill you to use social media.\u201d The demon was currently standing over Aziraphale, pressed against the angel\u2019s back, an arm on either side of him as he clicked away at Aziraphale\u2019s ancient computer. Well, ancient by Crowley\u2019s standards: he\u2019d gifted Aziraphale a new one about ten years ago, much less bulky than the original goliath he\u2019d owned, and Aziraphale had not updated it since. Crowley only had an ultra slim \u2018business\u2019 laptop for the look of the thing, preferring to do everything through his smartphone, but he\u2019d never managed to get Aziraphale beyond a flip phone so computer it was. </p><p>\u201cIt hardly seems necessary.\u201d</p><p>Crowley clicked onto the next screen and glanced at the angel. \u201cRelax,\u201d he said. \u201cBe glad I\u2019m not trying to sign you up for Instagram or Twitter.\u201d He gestured at the Facebook login screen with a flourish. \u201cThis is old people social media, angel. Perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI resent that,\u201d Aziraphale said, although with slightly less rancour. He peered at the screen with a little more interest. \u201cSo, I just\u2026fill in these little boxes and the computer does the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Crowley paused. \u201cYou do have an email account, right?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale scoffed. \u201cOf course. I use it to keep in touch with Miss Anathema. And with other specialists in my trade, of course.\u201d</p><p>Crowley straightened up and grinned. \u201cWell, think about how many more specialists you can keep in contact with by following them on social media.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think?\u201d</p><p>Crowley nodded sagely. \u201cOh, sure. Loads.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale began filling out the information, using the name and age currently on all his paperwork. Idly, he asked, \u201cDo you have a Facebook, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He never used it, but he hadn\u2019t wanted to delete the account in case the angel had ever come around. \u201cWe can be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather hope we\u2019re more than friends at this point,\u201d Aziraphale pointed out.</p><p>Crowley rolled his eyes. \u201cFacebook friends, angel. It\u2019s how people follow each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Aziraphale hit the sign up button, and blinked when it brought him to the next page. \u201cCrowley, it wants me to fill more things in.\u201d</p><p>Crowley rested his chin on Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder, draping himself over the angel. \u201cThat\u2019s just extra stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cGender, relationship status, profile photo, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale frowned at the options. Tentatively, he selected male, and then turned to the relationship status. \u201cShould I put \u2018it\u2019s complicated\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Crowley winced. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Our relationship is complicated. It\u2019s not accurate to simply say we are dating or married, and we certainly aren\u2019t single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d Crowley nosed at the angel\u2019s cheek. \u201c\u2019It\u2019s complicated\u2019 means you\u2019re kind-of-sort-of not in a relationship at all, really.\u201d He kissed the corner of Aziraphale\u2019s lips. \u201cAnd we most certainly are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. What do you have on your Facebook, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we\u2019re married.\u201d He glanced worriedly at Aziraphale. \u201cThat\u2019s alright, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite alright.\u201d Aziraphale smiled and clicked the button. He filled out a few more bubbles, and then stopped on the profile photo and banner. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have any personal photographs. Should I just put something generic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, hang on.\u201d Crowley fished his phone out of his pocket and hopped up on the desk, propping his feet on Aziraphale\u2019s chair. He flicked through his album, and then sent two to an email account his own disused one barely remembered. \u201cI\u2019ve sent a couple pictures to your email. Let me know what you think.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale opened a new tab and drew up his email with surprising ease. Crowley was impressed. Apparently, it wasn\u2019t the technology that Aziraphale struggled with, just the application. Aziraphale clicked onto the email and stared. He looked at the photos, then back at Crowley. \u201cWhen did you\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Crowley grinned. \u201cI take lots of photos of you, angel. That way I can look at you when you\u2019re not around.\u201d</p><p>The profile photo he\u2019d selected was from a few months ago at St. James\u2019s Park. The sun had hit Aziraphale\u2019s hair just right, giving him a beautiful halo of light that Crowley had though too ironic (and stunning) not to capture. Aziraphale was grinning in the picture, his eyes shining. He had, if Crowley remembered correctly, been expounding on a rare new edition he\u2019d just gotten in. He was gorgeous.<br/>Aziraphale looked at the other one. \u201cThis is you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. As if he could ever confuse Crowley for any other snake. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the bookshop, too,\u201d Crowley pointed out. In the picture, he was draped in serpentine form over a pile of prophecy books, some open to random pages. \u201cSo it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you manage to take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarefully.\u201d Thank someone for phone camera timers. </p><p>With a little assistance, Aziraphale managed to transfer the images from his email to his Facebook profile. He looked at Crowley. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>Crowley opened his app. \u201cHang on. I\u2019m sending you a friend request.\u201d It popped up on the screen with a ping. \u201cNow hit accept.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale did. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cYou can make posts, if you like, or look for other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would I post about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Crowley shrugged. \u201cBook covers? Old memes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a meme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale clicked curiously onto Crowley\u2019s account and shot him a sappy grin. \u201cOh, my darling. Your profile picture is both of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Crowley mumbled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have an account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d His banner was him sprawled across the hood of the Bentley. He\u2019d figured at least one of the photos should have his husband in it. </p><p>He slid into Aziraphale\u2019s lap and wrapped his arms around the angel\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThere you go,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cYou\u2019re on social media now. Even if it is just Facebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you pleased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Aziraphale leaned in and kissed him.</p><p>Crowley would ignore most of Aziraphale\u2019s Facebook posts after that; the angel still didn\u2019t seem to have a grasp of what the point of Facebook was, and more often than not his posts were nonsense. But he also sometimes posted things like \u201cMy husband looks beautiful today\u201d and \u201cSometimes I think I don\u2019t have the capacity for any more love in my being. Then I look at him and realize love is infinite.\u201d They were the sort of cheesy, corny things a middle-aged mother might post, but still. You had to smile. And Crowley did.</p>",

Well, ancient by Crowley\u2019s standards: he\u2019d gifted Aziraphale a new one about ten years ago, much less bulky than the original goliath he\u2019d owned, and Aziraphale had not updated it since. Crowley only had an ultra slim \u2018business\u2019 laptop for the look of the thing, preferring to do everything through his smartphone, but he\u2019d never managed to get Aziraphale beyond a flip phone so computer it was. </p><p>\u201cIt hardly seems necessary.\u201d</p><p>Crowley clicked onto the next screen and glanced at the angel. \u201cRelax,\u201d he said. \u201cBe glad I\u2019m not trying to sign you up for Instagram or Twitter.\u201d He gestured at the Facebook login screen with a flourish. \u201cThis is old people social media, angel. Perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI resent that,\u201d Aziraphale said, although with slightly less rancour. He peered at the screen with a little more interest. \u201cSo, I just\u2026fill in these little boxes and the computer does the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Crowley paused. \u201cYou do have an email account, right?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale scoffed. \u201cOf course. I use it to keep in touch with Miss Anathema. And with other specialists in my trade, of course.\u201d</p><p>Crowley straightened up and grinned. \u201cWell, think about how many more specialists you can keep in contact with by following them on social media.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think?\u201d</p><p>Crowley nodded sagely. \u201cOh, sure. Loads.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale began filling out the information, using the name and age currently on all his paperwork. Idly, he asked, \u201cDo you have a Facebook, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He never used it, but he hadn\u2019t wanted to delete the account in case the angel had ever come around. \u201cWe can be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather hope we\u2019re more than friends at this point,\u201d Aziraphale pointed out.</p><p>Crowley rolled his eyes. \u201cFacebook friends, angel. It\u2019s how people follow each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Aziraphale hit the sign up button, and blinked when it brought him to the next page. \u201cCrowley, it wants me to fill more things in.\u201d</p><p>Crowley rested his chin on Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder, draping himself over the angel. \u201cThat\u2019s just extra stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cGender, relationship status, profile photo, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale frowned at the options. Tentatively, he selected male, and then turned to the relationship status. \u201cShould I put \u2018it\u2019s complicated\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Crowley winced. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Our relationship is complicated. It\u2019s not accurate to simply say we are dating or married, and we certainly aren\u2019t single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d Crowley nosed at the angel\u2019s cheek. \u201c\u2019It\u2019s complicated\u2019 means you\u2019re kind-of-sort-of not in a relationship at all, really.\u201d He kissed the corner of Aziraphale\u2019s lips. \u201cAnd we most certainly are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. What do you have on your Facebook, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we\u2019re married.\u201d He glanced worriedly at Aziraphale. \u201cThat\u2019s alright, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite alright.\u201d Aziraphale smiled and clicked the button. He filled out a few more bubbles, and then stopped on the profile photo and banner. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have any personal photographs. Should I just put something generic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, hang on.\u201d Crowley fished his phone out of his pocket and hopped up on the desk, propping his feet on Aziraphale\u2019s chair. He flicked through his album, and then sent two to an email account his own disused one barely remembered. \u201cI\u2019ve sent a couple pictures to your email. Let me know what you think.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale opened a new tab and drew up his email with surprising ease. Crowley was impressed. Apparently, it wasn\u2019t the technology that Aziraphale struggled with, just the application. Aziraphale clicked onto the email and stared. He looked at the photos, then back at Crowley. \u201cWhen did you\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Crowley grinned. \u201cI take lots of photos of you, angel. That way I can look at you when you\u2019re not around.\u201d</p><p>The profile photo he\u2019d selected was from a few months ago at St. James\u2019s Park. The sun had hit Aziraphale\u2019s hair just right, giving him a beautiful halo of light that Crowley had though too ironic (and stunning) not to capture. Aziraphale was grinning in the picture, his eyes shining. He had, if Crowley remembered correctly, been expounding on a rare new edition he\u2019d just gotten in. He was gorgeous.<br>Aziraphale looked at the other one. \u201cThis is you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. As if he could ever confuse Crowley for any other snake. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the bookshop, too,\u201d Crowley pointed out. In the picture, he was draped in serpentine form over a pile of prophecy books, some open to random pages. \u201cSo it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you manage to take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarefully.\u201d Thank someone for phone camera timers. </p><p>With a little assistance, Aziraphale managed to transfer the images from his email to his Facebook profile. He looked at Crowley. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>Crowley opened his app. \u201cHang on. I\u2019m sending you a friend request.\u201d It popped up on the screen with a ping. \u201cNow hit accept.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale did. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cYou can make posts, if you like, or look for other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would I post about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Crowley shrugged. \u201cBook covers? Old memes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a meme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale clicked curiously onto Crowley\u2019s account and shot him a sappy grin. \u201cOh, my darling. Your profile picture is both of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Crowley mumbled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have an account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d His banner was him sprawled across the hood of the Bentley. He\u2019d figured at least one of the photos should have his husband in it. </p><p>He slid into Aziraphale\u2019s lap and wrapped his arms around the angel\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThere you go,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cYou\u2019re on social media now. Even if it is just Facebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you pleased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Aziraphale leaned in and kissed him.</p><p>Crowley would ignore most of Aziraphale\u2019s Facebook posts after that; the angel still didn\u2019t seem to have a grasp of what the point of Facebook was, and more often than not his posts were nonsense. But he also sometimes posted things like \u201cMy husband looks beautiful today\u201d and \u201cSometimes I think I don\u2019t have the capacity for any more love in my being. Then I look at him and realize love is infinite.\u201d They were the sort of cheesy, corny things a middle-aged mother might post, but still. You had to smile. And Crowley did.</p>",

He stole glances at the stranger as he put the bouquet together. He was amused to see the man wearing clothes that went out of fashion about forty years ago.&ldquo;</p><p>So should I put a card saying &lsquo;fuck you&rsquo; or is that too on the nose?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No, just a get well soon card&rdquo; The man replied politely.</p><p>&ldquo;From?&rdquo; Crowley asked looking up from the card he had picked.</p><p>&ldquo;From Aziraphale, to Gabriel&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley quickly jotted down the names on the card.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shit. I forgot to tie it.&rdquo; Crowley said as he rushed into the back room. He sighed as he closed the door. He quickly put a ribbon on the flowers and brought them close to his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, listen up, you better behave yourselves&rdquo; he hissed at them &ldquo;You are supposed to show disappointment and if you don&rsquo;t then your friends back here suffer.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>He lowered the flowers and they may or may not have shrank a bit in fear. Crowley walked out of the room and smiled at Aziraphale.</p><p>&quot;Here you go&rdquo; he said, handing him the flowers.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, dear&rdquo; Aziraphale said, shooting Crowley a smile and running out of the door as fast as he had come in.</p><p>Crowley leaned on the counter and sighed. He then quickly straightened up; can&rsquo;t have the plants think that he had gone soft.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u00a0</p><p>About few weeks later, Crowley was walking down to his shop when he saw Aziraphale walk out of the corner bookshop.</p><p>&ldquo;Aziraphale!&rdquo; He shouted as he jogged up to him, the flowers still in his arms.</p><p>Aziraphale turned around and smiled at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, my dear&rdquo; he said looking at Crowley</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you off to?&rdquo; Crowley asked suddenly.</p><p>&ldquo;St. James park to feed the ducks,&rdquo; Aziraphale replied after Crowley had caught his breath &ldquo;I find it quite relaxing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could drive you if you&rsquo;d like&rdquo; Crowley blurted out. He looked behind him at the Bentley and then back at Aziraphale who after a moment of consideration nodded his head in agreement.</p><p>Crowley quickly stashed the flowers in the back room of the shop and ran out to where Aziraphale was standing near the Bentley.</p><p>The ride to St. James park was a quiet one, if you don&rsquo;t count the Beethoven cassette playing &ldquo;another one bites the dust&rdquo; and both of their attempts at small talk.</p><p>Aziraphale quietly got out of the car and headed inside the park. He walked to a bench beside the pond and they both sat there in silence.</p><p>Crowley sat awkwardly as Aziraphale fed the ducks bread crumbs.</p><p>&ldquo;D'you mind if I have some of those?&rdquo; He asked pointing to the bread crumbs in Aziraphale&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo; He asked looking concerned, &ldquo;we can leave and get food at a restaurant if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No I meant to feed the ducks&rdquo; chuckled Crowley.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh right.&rdquo; Aziraphale replied, handing him some crumbs and blushing a deep red. All this nervousness had finally begun to affect his mind</p><p>After both their crumbs were finished and the ducks were fed, they sat there, neither of them moving.</p><p>Aziraphale placed his hands on his lap and looked at the ducks who were now waddling in the pond.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you stressed?&rdquo; Crowley asked breaking the silence.</p><p>&ldquo;No, wh-why would you say that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You said this place relaxed you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It does&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So why do you need relaxing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s Gabriel. Remember him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was in the hospital because he broke his arm&rdquo; Aziraphale continued &ldquo;his arm whealef weeks ago but he&rsquo;s still making me do all his extra work&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you want I could have a cactus delivered to him with a note that actually says fuck you this time.&rdquo; Crowley tried to joke but he realised how bad it was and didn&rsquo;t even bother to laugh or look at Aziraphale.</p><p>However, unknown to Crowley, Aziraphale did have a small smile on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you still hungry?&rdquo; Aziraphale asked dusting a few stray crumbs from his lap.</p><p>Crowley smiled and nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, would you mind driving us to the Ritz? I absolutely adore the desert there&rdquo; Aziraphale said</p><p>Crowley smiled back. &ldquo;No problem, angel.&rdquo; Crowley said as he got up and started walking towards his Bentley.</p><p>A few steps later his mind caught up and he almost slapped himself in the face.\u00a0<i>Angel?

I absolutely adore the desert there&rdquo; Aziraphale said</p><p>Crowley smiled back. &ldquo;No problem, angel.&rdquo; Crowley said as he got up and started walking towards his Bentley.</p><p>A few steps later his mind caught up and he almost slapped himself in the face.&nbsp;<i>Angel? Angel?! Who calls someone they hardly know angel?</i>&nbsp;Crowley&rsquo;s face was deep red by the time he got into the car and crossed his fingers that Aziraphale hadn&rsquo;t noticed.</p><p>Aziraphale, however, had noticed but being a gentleman, wasn&rsquo;t going to let Crowley know and die of embarassment so he put on a straight face and hid the smile which was creeping on his face.</p></p>",
