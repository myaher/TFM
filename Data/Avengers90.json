I woke reaching for him. I needed to make sure this just hadn\u2019t been a beautiful nightmare to which I would wake up and find one ring gone and the love of my life with someone else. I knew that was silly but sometimes a helpless romantic needs just that; reinsurance. \u201cG\u2019morning beautiful.\u201d His husky morning voice bringing me to the realization that it wasn\u2019t just a dream. I gave him a sleepy smile as he tucked a strand of my hair behind my ear. \u201cYou know you&rsquo;re cute in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaha. You know I am not a morning person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know but I think its cute.\u201d I raised my head up and kissed him on his side of his lips. His chuckle making me just giggle. His blue eyes shone brightly while he just shook his head at me.</p><p>\u201cI love that giggle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t giggle\u2026\u201d I pouted while snuggling deeper into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYes you do Doll and I love it, just like I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too 50.\u201d</p><p>\u201c50?\u201d Bucky cocked his eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u201cYou got to read more baby, and I have training so I got to go Sergeant, and looks like I need to start planning a wedding.\u201d I sat up the gray sheet slipping off my body as I walked to the bathroom to get ready. He gave me a wolfish grin as he grabbed me as I approached beside the bed. I giggled as he placed me right back underneath him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? I have to go and&hellip;hum.\u201d I was silenced fast with his soft lips on mine.</p><p>\u201cNo, since I took the liberty of calling in for both of us today. Besides I have a silk tie in there I been waiting to try out&hellip; .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo-you know ugh that reference. Don\u2019t augh don\u2019t you?\u201d A smirk crossed his lips as he reached out and pinned my hands against the headboard.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this if you don\u2019t want&hellip; . \u201c his voice quiet like he was second-guessing his decision with me. My heart pounded in my chest. \u201cJust know you ugh like that book and it looked interesting so I read some of it one the mission and just thought if&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames. Yellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe world is yellow Winter. Now, what were you sain?\u201d Bucky\u2019s eyes darken as he shifted off of me only to return moments later with a silk gray tie in his hands. Let\u2019s just say that tie is now my favorite&hellip; .</p><p>(Next Day) \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;We actually have some plans made,&rdquo; I stated to Natasha on our morning run.&ldquo;Simple, romantic and small and then a party until we kick you all out,&rdquo; I laughed. \u201cAlso I want you to be my bridesmaid. Bucky asked Steve to be his best man.&ldquo;<br/><br/>&quot;I would love to Ema. You know I&rsquo;m so happy for both of you. Now, most importantly the dress. Have you seen one you liked? We can go after this, and how about flowers and location.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Congratulations you are now helping me plan all of that.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;No need, I know a coordinator. Besides I want to know the other juicy details,&rdquo; she turned facing a little in front of me now walking backward. &ldquo;I want to know how many times you said oh B-ucky in the last 36 hours that I haven&rsquo;t seen you.&rdquo; She laughed.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Nat!&quot;My face now red from her and our workout.<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe I need to ask him,&rdquo; she took off running with me right behind her.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Natasha! No!&rdquo; I saw Bucky and Steve ahead of us. They have just finished their morning run. The guys looked up at us just laughing at this site. Of course, she beat me to them.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Barns, Wie oft hat sie deinen Namen ausgerufen? (So exactly how many times did she scream out your name?)&rdquo; I ran up to Bucky and covered his mouth before he could answer. He just laughed behind my hand as I gave him a peck on his cheek. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Ok so now that you had your fun I guess I will go with you to look at a dress,&rdquo; I said looking at Natasha. Bucky raised an eyebrow at me as I uncovered his mouth and kissed him on his cheek again.<br/><br/>&ldquo;And they just thought we were bad, he said as him and Steve chuckled.<br/><br/>&quot;You two are,&rdquo; I giggled.<br/><br/>&ldquo;So what are the plans?&rdquo; Steve asked leaning against the tree. Bucky draped his arm lazily over my shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Niagara Falls. Small. We just want our close friends and Kaye. Also four UNDISTURBED weeks off for our honeymoon.&rdquo; Bucky glared at Steve and Natasha with that task force look. Steve just rubbed his neck and then clapped him on his shoulder. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Four weeks shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. Plus if I need you, Buck, I&rsquo;ll call you or Ema.&rdquo; Bucky kissed me on top of my head. However, I was lost in my own world. The idea of planning a wedding was overwhelming. Natasha gave me a knowing smile. She had known both of us long enough to know small and quiet was all that we really wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;Now come on,&rdquo; Natasha said pulling me away as she checked her phone. &ldquo;We can meet the coordinator at two and you can tell her what exactly what you want and then go dress shopping. \u201dCome on Jones let\u2019s go.\u201d She took my hand pulling me from Bucky. I just shot him a help look.</p><p>\u201cI see you at two o\u2019clock. Go. Have fun.\u201d I gave him a nod while he and Steve chuckled at us two girls again.</p><p>\u201c Fine but you two need to get suits.&rdquo; His grin was intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, yes ma\u2019am.\u201d<br/><br/>Within a month&rsquo;s time, a date had been set, dress picked out, suits, flowers, and a beautiful location. Bucky was called away for a couple of days with Sam to help with selecting new task force members. It was a Friday morning and the wedding was the next day. Everything was packed and ready to go. I decided to go and bug Steve before I went to pick up Bucky and drive up to Niagara. He and Natasha were following us up later that day. I found him in his office.<br/><br/>&ldquo;You ready? Not getting cold feet hugh?&quot;He asked as I sat down across from him.</p><p>&quot;No, not at all. But I do need a favor?&rdquo; Steve raised an eyebrow at me. &ldquo;Walk me down the aisle to him. I couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better person to do it. You&rsquo;re like a big brother to me and I owe you all so much. You gave me a new life here where I found the love of my life.&rdquo; I looked at him nervously.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Ema,I would be honored too. You don&rsquo;t have to thank me.&rdquo; He stated as he shook his head. &ldquo;I think he is getting a great gal. Besides if he ever hurt you I would go big brother on his ass,&rdquo; I stood up and gave him a kiss on his cheek. &ldquo;Now get out of here and go get him.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;How, I can&rsquo;t even get close to the jet?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Here you go, you have definitely earned this.&rdquo; He threw a level 10 clearance badge at me along with a set of car keys. I looked at it and beamed.<br/><br/>I pulled up an hour later at the hanger with bags in the trunk blaring music. I had never felt so free and happy. My badge helped me already get onto the secure landing area. I saw him and Sam before he saw me. Might as well have a little fun with this. I rolled down the passenger window and leaned over the steering wheel just enough to tease him with a little cleavage thanks to my v neck task force shirt just as the two walked beside my new gunmetal Maximum. &ldquo;Excuse me, but can any of you two good looking guys help me?&rdquo; Bucky looked at me and a smile crept onto his face.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I think I may can darlin&rsquo;.&rdquo; He said huskily as he leaned down his hands holding onto the passenger window frame.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Good because I&rsquo;m looking for my fianc\u00e9. I haven\u2019t seen him in a week but all I want to see is his uniform on my floor and him underneath me.&rdquo; I beamed at him through my eyelashes. Bucky looked me up and down and sent tingles down my spine.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I think that could be arranged, doll.&rdquo; He said getting in beside me giving me a slow kiss.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t fly everywhere,&rdquo; he told Sam looking back at him.<br/><br/>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t. See you two tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The next day I married my best friend. Steve kept his promise to me and walked me down the aisle to an awaiting James Barnes. The ceremony short and sweet just how we wanted it. Natasha stood by me while Steve stood by Bucky. The vows simple and sweet.<br/><br/>&quot;I promise to love and cherish you forever. Protecting you and always winning over your heart. With this ring, I marry you.&rdquo;<br/><br/>He was mine and I was his. We celebrated with our friends who were more like family. The ones that saved both of us in a way and then led us to find each other.<br/><br/>(Three hours later) \u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>You would think that rose petals lining the hall leading the way to the bedroom would not cause you to want to immediately go outside, but after seeing this my throat had become dry. I needed fresh air. I stood looking into the darkness from the balcony. The sound of the waterfall echoed through the night. A condo to ourselves for four weeks overlooking the falls. Perfect and romantic. \u00a0So why was I so nervous? I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at myself. He was now my husband and I was about to be along with him for the first time since we had left the reception. I placed my hands on the cool rail while taking several calming breaths trying to shake off my nerves. Moments later I felt two strong arms being placed around my waist.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I was wondering where you wandered off to Mrs. Barns,&rdquo; Bucky whispered into my ear as he pecked the shell of it softly. He sent shivers down my skin as I let out a small moan leaning into his touch.</p><p>&ldquo;I like the sound of the falls, and I ugh, guess I&rsquo;m a little nervous too,&rdquo; I said shyly looking down at my new jewelry on my left hand. He turned me to face him and tucked a strand of my loose hair behind my ear. By now his suit jacket was gone his white shirt unbutton where his tie used to be. Dammit. He was not helping my nerves at all.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I think I can fix that sugar&rsquo;.&rdquo; He took my hand and led me back inside. &ldquo;Dance with me,&rdquo; he said quietly as he turned on the stereo with the remote. The song Trip began to play. I placed my hands around his neck as we swayed slowly to the music. Bucky never took his eyes off of me. A coy smirk playing on his lips.</p><p>\u201dYou know Sergeant you look very handsome in that suit. I think maybe you should keep the scruff and shoulder length hair for a while. It&rsquo;s really a good look.\u201d I giggled. Now he had me giggling again.</p><p>\u201dI love that giggle, \u201d he mumbled more to himself than me. \u201dM\u0103 bucur c\u0103 te-ai aprobat pe printesa mea, dar acum vreau s\u0103 te aud strig\u00e2nd numele meu cu tine sub mine. (I&rsquo;m glad you approve my princess but right now I want to hear you moaning my name out with you underneath me.) I gave him a confused glance.</p><p>\u201dYou know I don&rsquo;t understand Romanian right?\u201d Bucky beamed down at me with a mischievous smirk.</p><p>Yes. But I also know you love it when I speak to you in a different language. Do you realize what you mean to me? I feel like the luckiest man alive to have you by my side. You are my world. You complete my heart. \u201dJa. Aber ich wei\u00df auch, dass Sie es lieben, wenn ich mit Ihnen in einer anderen Sprache spreche. Wissen Sie, was Sie f\u00fcr mich bedeuten? Ich f\u00fchle mich wie der gl\u00fccklichste Mann am Leben, der Sie an meiner Seite hat. Du bist meine Welt. Du machst mein Herz fertig.\u201d</p><p>My eyes filled with happy tears. Dang alpha male.</p><p>Bucky, I love you more than you will ever know. I&rsquo;m so thankful I found you. You are my rock and my heart. Always.\u201dBucky, ich liebe dich mehr, als du je wissen wirst. Ich bin so dankbar, dass ich dich gefunden habe. Du bist mein Stein und mein Herz. Immer. Still, don&rsquo;t know what you said through.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI think I can help you understand Doll.\u201d He brushed his thumb over my lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201dIs that right Sergeant?\u201d His blue orbs fluttering to mine and down to my lips. His left hand creased the small of my back and pulled me closer to him as the other one traveled to to bottom hem of my short navy dress pushing it up my leg. His fingers playing softly on my thigh. \u00a0I closed my eyes as his lips met mine as I moaned into his deep kiss. I soon found myself up in his arms bridal style. \u00a0My eyes snapped open.</p><p>&ldquo;This is not the threshold Sergeant,&rdquo; I giggled as I swatted at his arm.<br/><br/>&ldquo;That is not my intention.\u201d</p><p>&quot;Well then I approve Sergeant,&rdquo; I said looking up through my eyelashes running my hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201dM\u0103 bucur c\u0103 te-ai aprobat pe printesa mea, dar acum vreau s\u0103 te aud strig\u00e2nd numele meu cu tine sub mine. (I&rsquo;m glad you approve my princess but right now I want to hear you moaning my name out with you underneath me.) He whispered in my ear causing me to bite my lip as he carried me down the hall to the bedroom.</p><p>\u201dYep, I think I got it now,\u201d I said with a head nod.</p><p>(The next morning-Bucky POV)<br/><br/>I felt the sheets from the bed shuffle and move as the body next to me, slowly tried to slip from the bed. Gently I grabbed her back and placed her underneath me. Her soft giggles filled the air. \u00a0I cupped her cheek and kissed her deeply before pulling away.<br/><br/>&ldquo;And where do you think you going Mrs.Barnes?&rdquo; I question kissing her neck softly. She breathed in deeply and arched her head back a bit.<br/><br/>&ldquo;We got to go and.. ahh~!&rdquo; She breathed out heavily as I nipped and licked at her neck softly. &ldquo;Sergeant.&rdquo; She murmured as my hands slithered down her body, slowly caressing her.<br/><br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our Honeymoon remember? Four weeks off..&rdquo; She gasped as my hand pressed down softly on her bundle of nerves. She bit her lip, trying not to release building up breaths as I grazed her up and down.<br/><br/>&ldquo;But-&rdquo; I cut her off with my lips, silencing her fast. I pulled away and whispered in her ear.<br/><br/>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking way too much. The only thing I want to hear from you right now, is you moaning my name.&rdquo; She released her lip and let out a breathless moan.<br/><br/>&ldquo;B-Bucky.&rdquo; She exhaled hard. I groaned and smirked down at her.<br/><br/>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so much better,&rdquo; I said smugly and leaned down, kissing her lips softly. \u201dOn your knees baby.\u201d She rolled over on her knees as I skimmed her soft skin below of her back with my fingertips.\u201dYou are already so wet. Humm can\u2019t wait to be in you. I pumped myself a few times before easing into her.</p><p>\u201dJa-mes.\u201d</p><p>@<a href=\"https://jewels2876.tumblr.com/\">jewels2876</a> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@<a href=\"http://averyrogers83.tumblr.com/\">averyrogers83</a> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@<a href=\"http://songsaboutbuckyy.tumblr.com/\">songsaboutbuckyy</a> @<a href=\"http://theonelittleone.tumblr.com/\">theonelittleone</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"https://mysticalfairytales.tumblr.com/\">mysticalfairytales \u00a0</a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>@<a href=\"https://423paralegal.tumblr.com/\">423paralegal</a> @<a href=\"http://kombatfather1796.tumblr.com/\">kombatfather1796</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://patriciaprevedelli.tumblr.com/\">patriciaprevedelli</a> @<a href=\"https://dilaila95.tumblr.com/\">dilaila95</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://aaamandaaaz.tumblr.com/\">aaamandaaaz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX3DXai7EehFTpX449jSmAg\">@igotkatiepowers</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvToET8Y0jfUUXnkNUwlmeg\">@lovemesomeworlddomination</a> @<a href=\"http://myeyesarenotblue.tumblr.com/\">myeyesarenotblue</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://babyinatrenchcoatlover.tumblr.com/\">babyinatrenchcoatlover</a> @<a href=\"https://mxgicmoonz.tumblr.com/\">mxgicmoonz</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://verygraphicink.tumblr.com/\">verygraphicink</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"https://buckmesideways22.tumblr.com/\">buckmesideways22 \u00a0\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8xOiyWOVwr0bJoi22LGcKQ\">@jewelofwinter</a>\u00a0 <b>@<a href=\"http://tuhl.tumblr.com/\">tuhl</a></b>  </p><p>@ <a href=\"https://nerd-in-a-galaxy-far-away.tumblr.com/\">nerd-in-a-galaxy-far-away</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://teamcap4bucky.tumblr.com/\">teamcap4bucky</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://hoewkeye.tumblr.com/\">hoewkeye</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://marvelandotherfandomimagines.tumblr.com/\">marvelandotherfandomimagines</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://dmn-dmn.tumblr.com/\">dmn-dmn</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxAwa-xdcVt9VPPNxo5yRMw\">@littledarlinhavefaithinme</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://shreddedparchment.tumblr.com/\">shreddedparchment</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://jewels2876.tumblr.com/\">jewels2876</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 @<a href=\"http://averyrogers83.tumblr.com/\">averyrogers83</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 @<a href=\"http://songsaboutbuckyy.tumblr.com/\">songsaboutbuckyy</a> @<a href=\"http://theonelittleone.tumblr.com/\">theonelittleone</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"https://mysticalfairytales.tumblr.com/\">mysticalfairytales \u00a0</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 @minerva1920 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>@<a href=\"https://423paralegal.tumblr.com/\">423paralegal</a> @<a href=\"http://kombatfather1796.tumblr.com/\">kombatfather1796</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://patriciaprevedelli.tumblr.com/\">patriciaprevedelli</a> @<a href=\"https://dilaila95.tumblr.com/\">dilaila95</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://aaamandaaaz.tumblr.com/\">aaamandaaaz</a> <a>@igotkatiepowers</a>\u200b</p><p><a>@lovemesomeworlddomination</a> @<a href=\"http://myeyesarenotblue.tumblr.com/\">myeyesarenotblue</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://babyinatrenchcoatlover.tumblr.com/\">babyinatrenchcoatlover</a> @<a href=\"https://mxgicmoonz.tumblr.com/\">mxgicmoonz</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://verygraphicink.tumblr.com/\">verygraphicink</a> @<a href=\"http://tuhl.tumblr.com/\">tuhl</a> @<a href=\"https://buckmesideways22.tumblr.com/\">buckmesideways22 \u00a0 </a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://jewelofwinter.tumblr.com/\">jewelofwinter</a> <a>@catsandbooksinafarawayplace</a>\u200b</p><p>@ <a href=\"https://nerd-in-a-galaxy-far-away.tumblr.com/\">nerd-in-a-galaxy-far-away</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://teamcap4bucky.tumblr.com/\">teamcap4bucky</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://hoewkeye.tumblr.com/\">hoewkeye</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://marvelandotherfandomimagines.tumblr.com/\">marvelandotherfandomimagines</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://dmn-dmn.tumblr.com/\">dmn-dmn</a> <a>@littledarlinhavefaithinme</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"http://shreddedparchment.tumblr.com/\">shreddedparchment</a></p><p><a>@catsandbooksinafarawayplace</a> <a>@carryoncaptainrogers</a>\u200b</p><p><a>@kombatfather1796</a> <a>@toxic-pineapple</a> \u00a0<a>@itsfabipro</a>\u200b</p>",

I woke reaching for him. I needed to make sure this just hadn\u2019t been a beautiful nightmare to which I would wake up and find one ring gone and the love of my life with someone else. I knew that was silly but sometimes a helpless romantic needs just that; reinsurance. \u201cG\u2019morning beautiful.\u201d His husky morning voice bringing me to the realization that it wasn\u2019t just a dream. I gave him a sleepy smile as he tucked a strand of my hair behind my ear. \u201cYou know you\u2019re cute in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaha. You know I am not a morning person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know but I think its cute.\u201d I raised my head up and kissed him on his side of his lips. His chuckle making me just giggle. His blue eyes shone brightly while he just shook his head at me.</p><p>\u201cI love that giggle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t giggle\u2026\u201d I pouted while snuggling deeper into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYes you do Doll and I love it, just like I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too 50.\u201d</p><p>\u201c50?\u201d Bucky cocked his eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u201cYou got to read more baby, and I have training so I got to go Sergeant, and looks like I need to start planning a wedding.\u201d I sat up the gray sheet slipping off my body as I walked to the bathroom to get ready. He gave me a wolfish grin as he grabbed me as I approached beside the bed. I giggled as he placed me right back underneath him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? I have to go and\u2026hum.\u201d I was silenced fast with his soft lips on mine.</p><p>\u201cNo, since I took the liberty of calling in for both of us today. Besides I have a silk tie in there I been waiting to try out\u2026 .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo-you know ugh that reference. Don\u2019t augh don\u2019t you?\u201d A smirk crossed his lips as he reached out and pinned my hands against the headboard.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this if you don\u2019t want\u2026 . \u201c his voice quiet like he was second-guessing his decision with me. My heart pounded in my chest. \u201cJust know you ugh like that book and it looked interesting so I read some of it one the mission and just thought if\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames. Yellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe world is yellow Winter. Now, what were you sain?\u201d Bucky\u2019s eyes darken as he shifted off of me only to return moments later with a silk gray tie in his hands. Let\u2019s just say that tie is now my favorite\u2026 .</p><p>(Next Day) \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe actually have some plans made,\u201d I stated to Natasha on our morning run.\u201cSimple, romantic and small and then a party until we kick you all out,\u201d I laughed. \u201cAlso I want you to be my bridesmaid. Bucky asked Steve to be his best man.\u201c<br><br>\"I would love to Ema. You know I\u2019m so happy for both of you. Now, most importantly the dress. Have you seen one you liked? We can go after this, and how about flowers and location.\u201d<br><br>\u201cCongratulations you are now helping me plan all of that.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo need, I know a coordinator. Besides I want to know the other juicy details,\u201d she turned facing a little in front of me now walking backward. \u201cI want to know how many times you said oh B-ucky in the last 36 hours that I haven\u2019t seen you.\u201d She laughed.<br><br>\u201cNat!\"My face now red from her and our workout.<br><br>\"Maybe I need to ask him,\u201d she took off running with me right behind her.<br><br>\u201cNatasha! No!\u201d I saw Bucky and Steve ahead of us. They have just finished their morning run. The guys looked up at us just laughing at this site. Of course, she beat me to them.<br><br>\u201cBarns, Wie oft hat sie deinen Namen ausgerufen? (So exactly how many times did she scream out your name?)\u201d I ran up to Bucky and covered his mouth before he could answer. He just laughed behind my hand as I gave him a peck on his cheek. <br><br>\u201cOk so now that you had your fun I guess I will go with you to look at a dress,\u201d I said looking at Natasha. Bucky raised an eyebrow at me as I uncovered his mouth and kissed him on his cheek again.<br><br>\u201cAnd they just thought we were bad, he said as him and Steve chuckled.<br><br>\"You two are,\u201d I giggled.<br><br>\u201cSo what are the plans?\u201d Steve asked leaning against the tree. Bucky draped his arm lazily over my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNiagara Falls. Small. We just want our close friends and Kaye. Also four UNDISTURBED weeks off for our honeymoon.\u201d Bucky glared at Steve and Natasha with that task force look. Steve just rubbed his neck and then clapped him on his shoulder. <br><br>\u201cFour weeks shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Plus if I need you, Buck, I\u2019ll call you or Ema.\u201d Bucky kissed me on top of my head. However, I was lost in my own world. The idea of planning a wedding was overwhelming. Natasha gave me a knowing smile. She had known both of us long enough to know small and quiet was all that we really wanted.</p><p>\u201cNow come on,\u201d Natasha said pulling me away as she checked her phone. \u201cWe can meet the coordinator at two and you can tell her what exactly what you want and then go dress shopping. \u201dCome on Jones let\u2019s go.\u201d She took my hand pulling me from Bucky. I just shot him a help look.</p><p>\u201cI see you at two o\u2019clock. Go. Have fun.\u201d I gave him a nod while he and Steve chuckled at us two girls again.</p><p>\u201c Fine but you two need to get suits.\u201d His grin was intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, yes ma\u2019am.\u201d<br><br>Within a month\u2019s time, a date had been set, dress picked out, suits, flowers, and a beautiful location. Bucky was called away for a couple of days with Sam to help with selecting new task force members. It was a Friday morning and the wedding was the next day. Everything was packed and ready to go. I decided to go and bug Steve before I went to pick up Bucky and drive up to Niagara. He and Natasha were following us up later that day. I found him in his office.<br><br>\u201cYou ready? Not getting cold feet hugh?\"He asked as I sat down across from him.</p><p>\"No, not at all. But I do need a favor?\u201d Steve raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cWalk me down the aisle to him. I couldn\u2019t ask for a better person to do it. You\u2019re like a big brother to me and I owe you all so much. You gave me a new life here where I found the love of my life.\u201d I looked at him nervously.<br><br>\u201cEma,I would be honored too. You don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d He stated as he shook his head. \u201cI think he is getting a great gal. Besides if he ever hurt you I would go big brother on his ass,\u201d I stood up and gave him a kiss on his cheek. \u201cNow get out of here and go get him.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHow, I can\u2019t even get close to the jet?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHere you go, you have definitely earned this.\u201d He threw a level 10 clearance badge at me along with a set of car keys. I looked at it and beamed.<br><br>I pulled up an hour later at the hanger with bags in the trunk blaring music. I had never felt so free and happy. My badge helped me already get onto the secure landing area. I saw him and Sam before he saw me. Might as well have a little fun with this. I rolled down the passenger window and leaned over the steering wheel just enough to tease him with a little cleavage thanks to my v neck task force shirt just as the two walked beside my new gunmetal Maximum. \u201cExcuse me, but can any of you two good looking guys help me?\u201d Bucky looked at me and a smile crept onto his face.<br><br>\u201cI think I may can darlin\u2019.\u201d He said huskily as he leaned down his hands holding onto the passenger window frame.<br><br>\u201cGood because I\u2019m looking for my fianc\u00e9. I haven\u2019t seen him in a week but all I want to see is his uniform on my floor and him underneath me.\u201d I beamed at him through my eyelashes. Bucky looked me up and down and sent tingles down my spine.<br><br>\u201cI think that could be arranged, doll.\u201d He said getting in beside me giving me a slow kiss.<br><br>\u201cCan\u2019t fly everywhere,\u201d he told Sam looking back at him.<br><br>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. See you two tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The next day I married my best friend. Steve kept his promise to me and walked me down the aisle to an awaiting James Barnes. The ceremony short and sweet just how we wanted it. Natasha stood by me while Steve stood by Bucky. The vows simple and sweet.<br><br>\"I promise to love and cherish you forever. Protecting you and always winning over your heart. With this ring, I marry you.\u201d<br><br>He was mine and I was his. We celebrated with our friends who were more like family. The ones that saved both of us in a way and then led us to find each other.<br><br>(Three hours later) \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>You would think that rose petals lining the hall leading the way to the bedroom would not cause you to want to immediately go outside, but after seeing this my throat had become dry. I needed fresh air. I stood looking into the darkness from the balcony. The sound of the waterfall echoed through the night. A condo to ourselves for four weeks overlooking the falls. Perfect and romantic. \u00a0So why was I so nervous? I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at myself. He was now my husband and I was about to be along with him for the first time since we had left the reception. I placed my hands on the cool rail while taking several calming breaths trying to shake off my nerves. Moments later I felt two strong arms being placed around my waist.<br><br>\u201cI was wondering where you wandered off to Mrs. Barns,\u201d Bucky whispered into my ear as he pecked the shell of it softly. He sent shivers down my skin as I let out a small moan leaning into his touch.</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of the falls, and I ugh, guess I\u2019m a little nervous too,\u201d I said shyly looking down at my new jewelry on my left hand. He turned me to face him and tucked a strand of my loose hair behind my ear. By now his suit jacket was gone his white shirt unbutton where his tie used to be. Dammit. He was not helping my nerves at all.<br><br>\u201cI think I can fix that sugar\u2019.\u201d He took my hand and led me back inside. \u201cDance with me,\u201d he said quietly as he turned on the stereo with the remote. The song Trip began to play. I placed my hands around his neck as we swayed slowly to the music. Bucky never took his eyes off of me. A coy smirk playing on his lips.</p><p>\u201dYou know Sergeant you look very handsome in that suit. I think maybe you should keep the scruff and shoulder length hair for a while. It\u2019s really a good look.\u201d I giggled. Now he had me giggling again.</p><p>\u201dI love that giggle, \u201d he mumbled more to himself than me. \u201dM\u0103 bucur c\u0103 te-ai aprobat pe printesa mea, dar acum vreau s\u0103 te aud strig\u00e2nd numele meu cu tine sub mine. (I\u2019m glad you approve my princess but right now I want to hear you moaning my name out with you underneath me.) I gave him a confused glance.</p><p>\u201dYou know I don\u2019t understand Romanian right?\u201d Bucky beamed down at me with a mischievous smirk.</p><p>Yes. But I also know you love it when I speak to you in a different language. Do you realize what you mean to me? I feel like the luckiest man alive to have you by my side. You are my world. You complete my heart. \u201dJa. Aber ich wei\u00df auch, dass Sie es lieben, wenn ich mit Ihnen in einer anderen Sprache spreche. Wissen Sie, was Sie f\u00fcr mich bedeuten? Ich f\u00fchle mich wie der gl\u00fccklichste Mann am Leben, der Sie an meiner Seite hat. Du bist meine Welt. Du machst mein Herz fertig.\u201d</p><p>My eyes filled with happy tears. Dang alpha male.</p><p>Bucky, I love you more than you will ever know. I\u2019m so thankful I found you. You are my rock and my heart. Always.\u201dBucky, ich liebe dich mehr, als du je wissen wirst. Ich bin so dankbar, dass ich dich gefunden habe. Du bist mein Stein und mein Herz. Immer. Still, don\u2019t know what you said through.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI think I can help you understand Doll.\u201d He brushed his thumb over my lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201dIs that right Sergeant?\u201d His blue orbs fluttering to mine and down to my lips. His left hand creased the small of my back and pulled me closer to him as the other one traveled to to bottom hem of my short navy dress pushing it up my leg. His fingers playing softly on my thigh. \u00a0I closed my eyes as his lips met mine as I moaned into his deep kiss. I soon found myself up in his arms bridal style. \u00a0My eyes snapped open.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the threshold Sergeant,\u201d I giggled as I swatted at his arm.<br><br>\u201cThat is not my intention.\u201d</p><p>\"Well then I approve Sergeant,\u201d I said looking up through my eyelashes running my hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201dM\u0103 bucur c\u0103 te-ai aprobat pe printesa mea, dar acum vreau s\u0103 te aud strig\u00e2nd numele meu cu tine sub mine. (I\u2019m glad you approve my princess but right now I want to hear you moaning my name out with you underneath me.) He whispered in my ear causing me to bite my lip as he carried me down the hall to the bedroom.</p><p>\u201dYep, I think I got it now,\u201d I said with a head nod.</p><p>(The next morning-Bucky POV)<br><br>I felt the sheets from the bed shuffle and move as the body next to me, slowly tried to slip from the bed. Gently I grabbed her back and placed her underneath me. Her soft giggles filled the air. \u00a0I cupped her cheek and kissed her deeply before pulling away.<br><br>\u201cAnd where do you think you going Mrs.Barnes?\u201d I question kissing her neck softly. She breathed in deeply and arched her head back a bit.<br><br>\u201cWe got to go and.. ahh~!\u201d She breathed out heavily as I nipped and licked at her neck softly. \u201cSergeant.\u201d She murmured as my hands slithered down her body, slowly caressing her.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s our Honeymoon remember? Four weeks off..\u201d She gasped as my hand pressed down softly on her bundle of nerves. She bit her lip, trying not to release building up breaths as I grazed her up and down.<br><br>\u201cBut-\u201d I cut her off with my lips, silencing her fast. I pulled away and whispered in her ear.<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re talking way too much. The only thing I want to hear from you right now, is you moaning my name.\u201d She released her lip and let out a breathless moan.<br><br>\u201cB-Bucky.\u201d She exhaled hard. I groaned and smirked down at her.<br><br>\u201cThat\u2019s so much better,\u201d I said smugly and leaned down, kissing her lips softly. \u201dOn your knees baby.\u201d She rolled over on her knees as I skimmed her soft skin below of her back with my fingertips.\u201dYou are already so wet. Humm can\u2019t wait to be in you. I pumped myself a few times before easing into her.</p><p>\u201dJa-mes.\u201d</p><p>@<a href=\"https://jewels2876.tumblr.com/\">jewels2876</a> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@<a href=\"http://averyrogers83.tumblr.com/\">averyrogers83</a> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@<a href=\"http://songsaboutbuckyy.tumblr.com/\">songsaboutbuckyy</a> @<a href=\"http://theonelittleone.tumblr.com/\">theonelittleone</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"https://mysticalfairytales.tumblr.com/\">mysticalfairytales \u00a0</a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>@<a href=\"https://423paralegal.tumblr.com/\">423paralegal</a> @<a href=\"http://kombatfather1796.tumblr.com/\">kombatfather1796</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://patriciaprevedelli.tumblr.com/\">patriciaprevedelli</a> @<a href=\"https://dilaila95.tumblr.com/\">dilaila95</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://aaamandaaaz.tumblr.com/\">aaamandaaaz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX3DXai7EehFTpX449jSmAg\">@igotkatiepowers</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvToET8Y0jfUUXnkNUwlmeg\">@lovemesomeworlddomination</a> @<a href=\"http://myeyesarenotblue.tumblr.com/\">myeyesarenotblue</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://babyinatrenchcoatlover.tumblr.com/\">babyinatrenchcoatlover</a> @<a href=\"https://mxgicmoonz.tumblr.com/\">mxgicmoonz</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://verygraphicink.tumblr.com/\">verygraphicink</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"https://buckmesideways22.tumblr.com/\">buckmesideways22 \u00a0\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8xOiyWOVwr0bJoi22LGcKQ\">@jewelofwinter</a>\u00a0 <b>@<a href=\"http://tuhl.tumblr.com/\">tuhl</a></b>  </p><p>@ <a href=\"https://nerd-in-a-galaxy-far-away.tumblr.com/\">nerd-in-a-galaxy-far-away</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://teamcap4bucky.tumblr.com/\">teamcap4bucky</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://hoewkeye.tumblr.com/\">hoewkeye</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://marvelandotherfandomimagines.tumblr.com/\">marvelandotherfandomimagines</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://dmn-dmn.tumblr.com/\">dmn-dmn</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxAwa-xdcVt9VPPNxo5yRMw\">@littledarlinhavefaithinme</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://shreddedparchment.tumblr.com/\">shreddedparchment</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://jewels2876.tumblr.com/\">jewels2876</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 @<a href=\"http://averyrogers83.tumblr.com/\">averyrogers83</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 @<a href=\"http://songsaboutbuckyy.tumblr.com/\">songsaboutbuckyy</a> @<a href=\"http://theonelittleone.tumblr.com/\">theonelittleone</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"https://mysticalfairytales.tumblr.com/\">mysticalfairytales \u00a0</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 @minerva1920 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>@<a href=\"https://423paralegal.tumblr.com/\">423paralegal</a> @<a href=\"http://kombatfather1796.tumblr.com/\">kombatfather1796</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://patriciaprevedelli.tumblr.com/\">patriciaprevedelli</a> @<a href=\"https://dilaila95.tumblr.com/\">dilaila95</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://aaamandaaaz.tumblr.com/\">aaamandaaaz</a> <a>@igotkatiepowers</a>\u200b</p><p><a>@lovemesomeworlddomination</a> @<a href=\"http://myeyesarenotblue.tumblr.com/\">myeyesarenotblue</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://babyinatrenchcoatlover.tumblr.com/\">babyinatrenchcoatlover</a> @<a href=\"https://mxgicmoonz.tumblr.com/\">mxgicmoonz</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://verygraphicink.tumblr.com/\">verygraphicink</a> @<a href=\"http://tuhl.tumblr.com/\">tuhl</a> @<a href=\"https://buckmesideways22.tumblr.com/\">buckmesideways22 \u00a0 </a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://jewelofwinter.tumblr.com/\">jewelofwinter</a> <a>@catsandbooksinafarawayplace</a>\u200b</p><p>@ <a href=\"https://nerd-in-a-galaxy-far-away.tumblr.com/\">nerd-in-a-galaxy-far-away</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://teamcap4bucky.tumblr.com/\">teamcap4bucky</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://hoewkeye.tumblr.com/\">hoewkeye</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://marvelandotherfandomimagines.tumblr.com/\">marvelandotherfandomimagines</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://dmn-dmn.tumblr.com/\">dmn-dmn</a> <a>@littledarlinhavefaithinme</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"http://shreddedparchment.tumblr.com/\">shreddedparchment</a></p><p><a>@catsandbooksinafarawayplace</a> <a>@carryoncaptainrogers</a>\u200b</p><p><a>@kombatfather1796</a> <a>@toxic-pineapple</a> \u00a0<a>@itsfabipro</a>\u200b</p>",

I woke reaching for him. I needed to make sure this just hadn\u2019t been a beautiful nightmare to which I would wake up and find one ring gone and the love of my life with someone else. I knew that was silly but sometimes a helpless romantic needs just that; reinsurance. \u201cG\u2019morning beautiful.\u201d His husky morning voice bringing me to the realization that it wasn\u2019t just a dream. I gave him a sleepy smile as he tucked a strand of my hair behind my ear. \u201cYou know you\u2019re cute in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaha. You know I am not a morning person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know but I think its cute.\u201d I raised my head up and kissed him on his side of his lips. His chuckle making me just giggle. His blue eyes shone brightly while he just shook his head at me.</p><p>\u201cI love that giggle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t giggle\u2026\u201d I pouted while snuggling deeper into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYes you do Doll and I love it, just like I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too 50.\u201d</p><p>\u201c50?\u201d Bucky cocked his eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u201cYou got to read more baby, and I have training so I got to go Sergeant, and looks like I need to start planning a wedding.\u201d I sat up the gray sheet slipping off my body as I walked to the bathroom to get ready. He gave me a wolfish grin as he grabbed me as I approached beside the bed. I giggled as he placed me right back underneath him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? I have to go and\u2026hum.\u201d I was silenced fast with his soft lips on mine.</p><p>\u201cNo, since I took the liberty of calling in for both of us today. Besides I have a silk tie in there I been waiting to try out\u2026 .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo-you know ugh that reference. Don\u2019t augh don\u2019t you?\u201d A smirk crossed his lips as he reached out and pinned my hands against the headboard.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this if you don\u2019t want\u2026 . \u201c his voice quiet like he was second-guessing his decision with me. My heart pounded in my chest. \u201cJust know you ugh like that book and it looked interesting so I read some of it one the mission and just thought if\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames. Yellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe world is yellow Winter. Now, what were you sain?\u201d Bucky\u2019s eyes darken as he shifted off of me only to return moments later with a silk gray tie in his hands. Let\u2019s just say that tie is now my favorite\u2026 .</p><p>(Next Day) \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe actually have some plans made,\u201d I stated to Natasha on our morning run.\u201cSimple, romantic and small and then a party until we kick you all out,\u201d I laughed. \u201cAlso I want you to be my bridesmaid. Bucky asked Steve to be his best man.\u201c<br><br>\"I would love to Ema. You know I\u2019m so happy for both of you. Now, most importantly the dress. Have you seen one you liked? We can go after this, and how about flowers and location.\u201d<br><br>\u201cCongratulations you are now helping me plan all of that.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo need, I know a coordinator. Besides I want to know the other juicy details,\u201d she turned facing a little in front of me now walking backward. \u201cI want to know how many times you said oh B-ucky in the last 36 hours that I haven\u2019t seen you.\u201d She laughed.<br><br>\u201cNat!\"My face now red from her and our workout.<br><br>\"Maybe I need to ask him,\u201d she took off running with me right behind her.<br><br>\u201cNatasha! No!\u201d I saw Bucky and Steve ahead of us. They have just finished their morning run. The guys looked up at us just laughing at this site. Of course, she beat me to them.<br><br>\u201cBarns, Wie oft hat sie deinen Namen ausgerufen? (So exactly how many times did she scream out your name?)\u201d I ran up to Bucky and covered his mouth before he could answer. He just laughed behind my hand as I gave him a peck on his cheek. <br><br>\u201cOk so now that you had your fun I guess I will go with you to look at a dress,\u201d I said looking at Natasha. Bucky raised an eyebrow at me as I uncovered his mouth and kissed him on his cheek again.<br><br>\u201cAnd they just thought we were bad, he said as him and Steve chuckled.<br><br>\"You two are,\u201d I giggled.<br><br>\u201cSo what are the plans?\u201d Steve asked leaning against the tree. Bucky draped his arm lazily over my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNiagara Falls. Small. We just want our close friends and Kaye. Also four UNDISTURBED weeks off for our honeymoon.\u201d Bucky glared at Steve and Natasha with that task force look. Steve just rubbed his neck and then clapped him on his shoulder. <br><br>\u201cFour weeks shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Plus if I need you, Buck, I\u2019ll call you or Ema.\u201d Bucky kissed me on top of my head. However, I was lost in my own world. The idea of planning a wedding was overwhelming. Natasha gave me a knowing smile. She had known both of us long enough to know small and quiet was all that we really wanted.</p><p>\u201cNow come on,\u201d Natasha said pulling me away as she checked her phone. \u201cWe can meet the coordinator at two and you can tell her what exactly what you want and then go dress shopping. \u201dCome on Jones let\u2019s go.\u201d She took my hand pulling me from Bucky. I just shot him a help look.</p><p>\u201cI see you at two o\u2019clock. Go. Have fun.\u201d I gave him a nod while he and Steve chuckled at us two girls again.</p><p>\u201c Fine but you two need to get suits.\u201d His grin was intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, yes ma\u2019am.\u201d<br><br>Within a month\u2019s time, a date had been set, dress picked out, suits, flowers, and a beautiful location. Bucky was called away for a couple of days with Sam to help with selecting new task force members. It was a Friday morning and the wedding was the next day. Everything was packed and ready to go. I decided to go and bug Steve before I went to pick up Bucky and drive up to Niagara. He and Natasha were following us up later that day. I found him in his office.<br><br>\u201cYou ready? Not getting cold feet hugh?\"He asked as I sat down across from him.</p><p>\"No, not at all. But I do need a favor?\u201d Steve raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cWalk me down the aisle to him. I couldn\u2019t ask for a better person to do it. You\u2019re like a big brother to me and I owe you all so much. You gave me a new life here where I found the love of my life.\u201d I looked at him nervously.<br><br>\u201cEma,I would be honored too. You don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d He stated as he shook his head. \u201cI think he is getting a great gal. Besides if he ever hurt you I would go big brother on his ass,\u201d I stood up and gave him a kiss on his cheek. \u201cNow get out of here and go get him.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHow, I can\u2019t even get close to the jet?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHere you go, you have definitely earned this.\u201d He threw a level 10 clearance badge at me along with a set of car keys. I looked at it and beamed.<br><br>I pulled up an hour later at the hanger with bags in the trunk blaring music. I had never felt so free and happy. My badge helped me already get onto the secure landing area. I saw him and Sam before he saw me. Might as well have a little fun with this. I rolled down the passenger window and leaned over the steering wheel just enough to tease him with a little cleavage thanks to my v neck task force shirt just as the two walked beside my new gunmetal Maximum. \u201cExcuse me, but can any of you two good looking guys help me?\u201d Bucky looked at me and a smile crept onto his face.<br><br>\u201cI think I may can darlin\u2019.\u201d He said huskily as he leaned down his hands holding onto the passenger window frame.<br><br>\u201cGood because I\u2019m looking for my fianc\u00e9. I haven\u2019t seen him in a week but all I want to see is his uniform on my floor and him underneath me.\u201d I beamed at him through my eyelashes. Bucky looked me up and down and sent tingles down my spine.<br><br>\u201cI think that could be arranged, doll.\u201d He said getting in beside me giving me a slow kiss.<br><br>\u201cCan\u2019t fly everywhere,\u201d he told Sam looking back at him.<br><br>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. See you two tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The next day I married my best friend. Steve kept his promise to me and walked me down the aisle to an awaiting James Barnes. The ceremony short and sweet just how we wanted it. Natasha stood by me while Steve stood by Bucky. The vows simple and sweet.<br><br>\"I promise to love and cherish you forever. Protecting you and always winning over your heart. With this ring, I marry you.\u201d<br><br>He was mine and I was his. We celebrated with our friends who were more like family. The ones that saved both of us in a way and then led us to find each other.<br><br>(Three hours later) \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>You would think that rose petals lining the hall leading the way to the bedroom would not cause you to want to immediately go outside, but after seeing this my throat had become dry. I needed fresh air. I stood looking into the darkness from the balcony. The sound of the waterfall echoed through the night. A condo to ourselves for four weeks overlooking the falls. Perfect and romantic. \u00a0So why was I so nervous? I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at myself. He was now my husband and I was about to be along with him for the first time since we had left the reception. I placed my hands on the cool rail while taking several calming breaths trying to shake off my nerves. Moments later I felt two strong arms being placed around my waist.<br><br>\u201cI was wondering where you wandered off to Mrs. Barns,\u201d Bucky whispered into my ear as he pecked the shell of it softly. He sent shivers down my skin as I let out a small moan leaning into his touch.</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of the falls, and I ugh, guess I\u2019m a little nervous too,\u201d I said shyly looking down at my new jewelry on my left hand. He turned me to face him and tucked a strand of my loose hair behind my ear. By now his suit jacket was gone his white shirt unbutton where his tie used to be. Dammit. He was not helping my nerves at all.<br><br>\u201cI think I can fix that sugar\u2019.\u201d He took my hand and led me back inside. \u201cDance with me,\u201d he said quietly as he turned on the stereo with the remote. The song Trip began to play. I placed my hands around his neck as we swayed slowly to the music. Bucky never took his eyes off of me. A coy smirk playing on his lips.</p><p>\u201dYou know Sergeant you look very handsome in that suit. I think maybe you should keep the scruff and shoulder length hair for a while. It\u2019s really a good look.\u201d I giggled. Now he had me giggling again.</p><p>\u201dI love that giggle, \u201d he mumbled more to himself than me. \u201dM\u0103 bucur c\u0103 te-ai aprobat pe printesa mea, dar acum vreau s\u0103 te aud strig\u00e2nd numele meu cu tine sub mine. (I\u2019m glad you approve my princess but right now I want to hear you moaning my name out with you underneath me.) I gave him a confused glance.</p><p>\u201dYou know I don\u2019t understand Romanian right?\u201d Bucky beamed down at me with a mischievous smirk.</p><p>Yes. But I also know you love it when I speak to you in a different language. Do you realize what you mean to me? I feel like the luckiest man alive to have you by my side. You are my world. You complete my heart. \u201dJa. Aber ich wei\u00df auch, dass Sie es lieben, wenn ich mit Ihnen in einer anderen Sprache spreche. Wissen Sie, was Sie f\u00fcr mich bedeuten? Ich f\u00fchle mich wie der gl\u00fccklichste Mann am Leben, der Sie an meiner Seite hat. Du bist meine Welt. Du machst mein Herz fertig.\u201d</p><p>My eyes filled with happy tears. Dang alpha male.</p><p>Bucky, I love you more than you will ever know. I\u2019m so thankful I found you. You are my rock and my heart. Always.\u201dBucky, ich liebe dich mehr, als du je wissen wirst. Ich bin so dankbar, dass ich dich gefunden habe. Du bist mein Stein und mein Herz. Immer. Still, don\u2019t know what you said through.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI think I can help you understand Doll.\u201d He brushed his thumb over my lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201dIs that right Sergeant?\u201d His blue orbs fluttering to mine and down to my lips. His left hand creased the small of my back and pulled me closer to him as the other one traveled to to bottom hem of my short navy dress pushing it up my leg. His fingers playing softly on my thigh. \u00a0I closed my eyes as his lips met mine as I moaned into his deep kiss. I soon found myself up in his arms bridal style. \u00a0My eyes snapped open.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the threshold Sergeant,\u201d I giggled as I swatted at his arm.<br><br>\u201cThat is not my intention.\u201d</p><p>\"Well then I approve Sergeant,\u201d I said looking up through my eyelashes running my hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201dM\u0103 bucur c\u0103 te-ai aprobat pe printesa mea, dar acum vreau s\u0103 te aud strig\u00e2nd numele meu cu tine sub mine. (I\u2019m glad you approve my princess but right now I want to hear you moaning my name out with you underneath me.) He whispered in my ear causing me to bite my lip as he carried me down the hall to the bedroom.</p><p>\u201dYep, I think I got it now,\u201d I said with a head nod.</p><p>(The next morning-Bucky POV)<br><br>I felt the sheets from the bed shuffle and move as the body next to me, slowly tried to slip from the bed. Gently I grabbed her back and placed her underneath me. Her soft giggles filled the air. \u00a0I cupped her cheek and kissed her deeply before pulling away.<br><br>\u201cAnd where do you think you going Mrs.Barnes?\u201d I question kissing her neck softly. She breathed in deeply and arched her head back a bit.<br><br>\u201cWe got to go and.. ahh~!\u201d She breathed out heavily as I nipped and licked at her neck softly. \u201cSergeant.\u201d She murmured as my hands slithered down her body, slowly caressing her.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s our Honeymoon remember? Four weeks off..\u201d She gasped as my hand pressed down softly on her bundle of nerves. She bit her lip, trying not to release building up breaths as I grazed her up and down.<br><br>\u201cBut-\u201d I cut her off with my lips, silencing her fast. I pulled away and whispered in her ear.<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re talking way too much. The only thing I want to hear from you right now, is you moaning my name.\u201d She released her lip and let out a breathless moan.<br><br>\u201cB-Bucky.\u201d She exhaled hard. I groaned and smirked down at her.<br><br>\u201cThat\u2019s so much better,\u201d I said smugly and leaned down, kissing her lips softly. \u201dOn your knees baby.\u201d She rolled over on her knees as I skimmed her soft skin below of her back with my fingertips.\u201dYou are already so wet. Humm can\u2019t wait to be in you. I pumped myself a few times before easing into her.</p><p>\u201dJa-mes.\u201d</p><p>@<a href=\"https://jewels2876.tumblr.com/\">jewels2876</a> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@<a href=\"http://averyrogers83.tumblr.com/\">averyrogers83</a> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@<a href=\"http://songsaboutbuckyy.tumblr.com/\">songsaboutbuckyy</a> @<a href=\"http://theonelittleone.tumblr.com/\">theonelittleone</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"https://mysticalfairytales.tumblr.com/\">mysticalfairytales \u00a0</a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>@<a href=\"https://423paralegal.tumblr.com/\">423paralegal</a> @<a href=\"http://kombatfather1796.tumblr.com/\">kombatfather1796</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://patriciaprevedelli.tumblr.com/\">patriciaprevedelli</a> @<a href=\"https://dilaila95.tumblr.com/\">dilaila95</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://aaamandaaaz.tumblr.com/\">aaamandaaaz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX3DXai7EehFTpX449jSmAg\">@igotkatiepowers</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvToET8Y0jfUUXnkNUwlmeg\">@lovemesomeworlddomination</a> @<a href=\"http://myeyesarenotblue.tumblr.com/\">myeyesarenotblue</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://babyinatrenchcoatlover.tumblr.com/\">babyinatrenchcoatlover</a> @<a href=\"https://mxgicmoonz.tumblr.com/\">mxgicmoonz</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://verygraphicink.tumblr.com/\">verygraphicink</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"https://buckmesideways22.tumblr.com/\">buckmesideways22 \u00a0\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8xOiyWOVwr0bJoi22LGcKQ\">@jewelofwinter</a>\u00a0 <b>@<a href=\"http://tuhl.tumblr.com/\">tuhl</a></b>  </p><p>@ <a href=\"https://nerd-in-a-galaxy-far-away.tumblr.com/\">nerd-in-a-galaxy-far-away</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://teamcap4bucky.tumblr.com/\">teamcap4bucky</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://hoewkeye.tumblr.com/\">hoewkeye</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://marvelandotherfandomimagines.tumblr.com/\">marvelandotherfandomimagines</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://dmn-dmn.tumblr.com/\">dmn-dmn</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxAwa-xdcVt9VPPNxo5yRMw\">@littledarlinhavefaithinme</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://shreddedparchment.tumblr.com/\">shreddedparchment</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://jewels2876.tumblr.com/\">jewels2876</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 @<a href=\"http://averyrogers83.tumblr.com/\">averyrogers83</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 @<a href=\"http://songsaboutbuckyy.tumblr.com/\">songsaboutbuckyy</a> @<a href=\"http://theonelittleone.tumblr.com/\">theonelittleone</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"https://mysticalfairytales.tumblr.com/\">mysticalfairytales \u00a0</a> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 @minerva1920 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>@<a href=\"https://423paralegal.tumblr.com/\">423paralegal</a> @<a href=\"http://kombatfather1796.tumblr.com/\">kombatfather1796</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://patriciaprevedelli.tumblr.com/\">patriciaprevedelli</a> @<a href=\"https://dilaila95.tumblr.com/\">dilaila95</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://aaamandaaaz.tumblr.com/\">aaamandaaaz</a> <a>@igotkatiepowers</a>\u200b</p><p><a>@lovemesomeworlddomination</a> @<a href=\"http://myeyesarenotblue.tumblr.com/\">myeyesarenotblue</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://babyinatrenchcoatlover.tumblr.com/\">babyinatrenchcoatlover</a> @<a href=\"https://mxgicmoonz.tumblr.com/\">mxgicmoonz</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://verygraphicink.tumblr.com/\">verygraphicink</a> @<a href=\"http://tuhl.tumblr.com/\">tuhl</a> @<a href=\"https://buckmesideways22.tumblr.com/\">buckmesideways22 \u00a0 </a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://jewelofwinter.tumblr.com/\">jewelofwinter</a> <a>@catsandbooksinafarawayplace</a>\u200b</p><p>@ <a href=\"https://nerd-in-a-galaxy-far-away.tumblr.com/\">nerd-in-a-galaxy-far-away</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://teamcap4bucky.tumblr.com/\">teamcap4bucky</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://hoewkeye.tumblr.com/\">hoewkeye</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://marvelandotherfandomimagines.tumblr.com/\">marvelandotherfandomimagines</a></p><p>@<a href=\"https://dmn-dmn.tumblr.com/\">dmn-dmn</a> <a>@littledarlinhavefaithinme</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"http://shreddedparchment.tumblr.com/\">shreddedparchment</a></p><p><a>@catsandbooksinafarawayplace</a> <a>@carryoncaptainrogers</a>\u200b</p><p><a>@kombatfather1796</a> <a>@toxic-pineapple</a> \u00a0<a>@itsfabipro</a>\u200b</p>",

I woke reaching for him. I needed to make sure this just hadn&rsquo;t been a beautiful nightmare to which I would wake up and find one ring gone and the love of my life with someone else. I knew that was silly but sometimes a helpless romantic needs just that; reinsurance. &ldquo;G&rsquo;morning beautiful.&rdquo; His husky morning voice bringing me to the realization that it wasn&rsquo;t just a dream. I gave him a sleepy smile as he tucked a strand of my hair behind my ear. &ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re cute in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Haha. You know I am not a morning person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I know but I think its cute.&rdquo; I raised my head up and kissed him on his side of his lips. His chuckle making me just giggle. His blue eyes shone brightly while he just shook his head at me.</p><p>&ldquo;I love that giggle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t giggle&hellip;&rdquo; I pouted while snuggling deeper into his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes you do Doll and I love it, just like I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too 50.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;50?&rdquo; Bucky cocked his eyebrow at me.</p><p>&ldquo;You got to read more baby, and I have training so I got to go Sergeant, and looks like I need to start planning a wedding.&rdquo; I sat up the gray sheet slipping off my body as I walked to the bathroom to get ready. He gave me a wolfish grin as he grabbed me as I approached beside the bed. I giggled as he placed me right back underneath him.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing? I have to go and&hellip;hum.&rdquo; I was silenced fast with his soft lips on mine.</p><p>&ldquo;No, since I took the liberty of calling in for both of us today. Besides I have a silk tie in there I been waiting to try out&hellip; .&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yo-you know ugh that reference. Don&rsquo;t augh don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; A smirk crossed his lips as he reached out and pinned my hands against the headboard.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to do this if you don&rsquo;t want&hellip; . &ldquo; his voice quiet like he was second-guessing his decision with me. My heart pounded in my chest. &ldquo;Just know you ugh like that book and it looked interesting so I read some of it one the mission and just thought if&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;James. Yellow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Safe world is yellow Winter. Now, what were you sain?&rdquo; Bucky&rsquo;s eyes darken as he shifted off of me only to return moments later with a silk gray tie in his hands. Let&rsquo;s just say that tie is now my favorite&hellip; .</p><p>(Next Day) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We actually have some plans made,&rdquo; I stated to Natasha on our morning run.&ldquo;Simple, romantic and small and then a party until we kick you all out,&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;Also I want you to be my bridesmaid. Bucky asked Steve to be his best man.&ldquo;<br /><br />\"I would love to Ema. You know I&rsquo;m so happy for both of you. Now, most importantly the dress. Have you seen one you liked? We can go after this, and how about flowers and location.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Congratulations you are now helping me plan all of that.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No need, I know a coordinator. Besides I want to know the other juicy details,&rdquo; she turned facing a little in front of me now walking backward. &ldquo;I want to know how many times you said oh B-ucky in the last 36 hours that I haven&rsquo;t seen you.&rdquo; She laughed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Nat!\"My face now red from her and our workout.<br /><br />\"Maybe I need to ask him,&rdquo; she took off running with me right behind her.<br /><br />&ldquo;Natasha! No!&rdquo; I saw Bucky and Steve ahead of us. They have just finished their morning run. The guys looked up at us just laughing at this site. Of course, she beat me to them.<br /><br />&ldquo;Barns, Wie oft hat sie deinen Namen ausgerufen? (So exactly how many times did she scream out your name?)&rdquo; I ran up to Bucky and covered his mouth before he could answer. He just laughed behind my hand as I gave him a peck on his cheek. <br /><br />&ldquo;Ok so now that you had your fun I guess I will go with you to look at a dress,&rdquo; I said looking at Natasha. Bucky raised an eyebrow at me as I uncovered his mouth and kissed him on his cheek again.<br /><br />&ldquo;And they just thought we were bad, he said as him and Steve chuckled.<br /><br />\"You two are,&rdquo; I giggled.<br /><br />&ldquo;So what are the plans?&rdquo; Steve asked leaning against the tree. Bucky draped his arm lazily over my shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Niagara Falls. Small. We just want our close friends and Kaye. Also four UNDISTURBED weeks off for our honeymoon.&rdquo; Bucky glared at Steve and Natasha with that task force look. Steve just rubbed his neck and then clapped him on his shoulder. <br /><br />&ldquo;Four weeks shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. Plus if I need you, Buck, I&rsquo;ll call you or Ema.&rdquo; Bucky kissed me on top of my head. However, I was lost in my own world. The idea of planning a wedding was overwhelming. Natasha gave me a knowing smile. She had known both of us long enough to know small and quiet was all that we really wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;Now come on,&rdquo; Natasha said pulling me away as she checked her phone. &ldquo;We can meet the coordinator at two and you can tell her what exactly what you want and then go dress shopping. &rdquo;Come on Jones let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; She took my hand pulling me from Bucky. I just shot him a help look.</p><p>&ldquo;I see you at two o&rsquo;clock. Go. Have fun.&rdquo; I gave him a nod while he and Steve chuckled at us two girls again.</p><p>&ldquo; Fine but you two need to get suits.&rdquo; His grin was intoxicating.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;<br /><br />Within a month&rsquo;s time, a date had been set, dress picked out, suits, flowers, and a beautiful location. Bucky was called away for a couple of days with Sam to help with selecting new task force members. It was a Friday morning and the wedding was the next day. Everything was packed and ready to go. I decided to go and bug Steve before I went to pick up Bucky and drive up to Niagara. He and Natasha were following us up later that day. I found him in his office.<br /><br />&ldquo;You ready? Not getting cold feet hugh?\"He asked as I sat down across from him.</p><p>\"No, not at all. But I do need a favor?&rdquo; Steve raised an eyebrow at me. &ldquo;Walk me down the aisle to him. I couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better person to do it. You&rsquo;re like a big brother to me and I owe you all so much. You gave me a new life here where I found the love of my life.&rdquo; I looked at him nervously.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ema,I would be honored too. You don&rsquo;t have to thank me.&rdquo; He stated as he shook his head. &ldquo;I think he is getting a great gal. Besides if he ever hurt you I would go big brother on his ass,&rdquo; I stood up and gave him a kiss on his cheek. &ldquo;Now get out of here and go get him.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;How, I can&rsquo;t even get close to the jet?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Here you go, you have definitely earned this.&rdquo; He threw a level 10 clearance badge at me along with a set of car keys. I looked at it and beamed.<br /><br />I pulled up an hour later at the hanger with bags in the trunk blaring music. I had never felt so free and happy. My badge helped me already get onto the secure landing area. I saw him and Sam before he saw me. Might as well have a little fun with this. I rolled down the passenger window and leaned over the steering wheel just enough to tease him with a little cleavage thanks to my v neck task force shirt just as the two walked beside my new gunmetal Maximum. &ldquo;Excuse me, but can any of you two good looking guys help me?&rdquo; Bucky looked at me and a smile crept onto his face.<br /><br />&ldquo;I think I may can darlin&rsquo;.&rdquo; He said huskily as he leaned down his hands holding onto the passenger window frame.<br /><br />&ldquo;Good because I&rsquo;m looking for my fianc&eacute;. I haven&rsquo;t seen him in a week but all I want to see is his uniform on my floor and him underneath me.&rdquo; I beamed at him through my eyelashes. Bucky looked me up and down and sent tingles down my spine.<br /><br />&ldquo;I think that could be arranged, doll.&rdquo; He said getting in beside me giving me a slow kiss.<br /><br />&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t fly everywhere,&rdquo; he told Sam looking back at him.<br /><br />&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t. See you two tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>The next day I married my best friend. Steve kept his promise to me and walked me down the aisle to an awaiting James Barnes. The ceremony short and sweet just how we wanted it. Natasha stood by me while Steve stood by Bucky. The vows simple and sweet.<br /><br />\"I promise to love and cherish you forever. Protecting you and always winning over your heart. With this ring, I marry you.&rdquo;<br /><br />He was mine and I was his. We celebrated with our friends who were more like family. The ones that saved both of us in a way and then led us to find each other.<br /><br />(Three hours later) &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You would think that rose petals lining the hall leading the way to the bedroom would not cause you to want to immediately go outside, but after seeing this my throat had become dry. I needed fresh air. I stood looking into the darkness from the balcony. The sound of the waterfall echoed through the night. A condo to ourselves for four weeks overlooking the falls. Perfect and romantic. &nbsp;So why was I so nervous? I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at myself. He was now my husband and I was about to be along with him for the first time since we had left the reception. I placed my hands on the cool rail while taking several calming breaths trying to shake off my nerves. Moments later I felt two strong arms being placed around my waist.<br /><br />&ldquo;I was wondering where you wandered off to Mrs. Barns,&rdquo; Bucky whispered into my ear as he pecked the shell of it softly. He sent shivers down my skin as I let out a small moan leaning into his touch.</p><p>&ldquo;I like the sound of the falls, and I ugh, guess I&rsquo;m a little nervous too,&rdquo; I said shyly looking down at my new jewelry on my left hand. He turned me to face him and tucked a strand of my loose hair behind my ear. By now his suit jacket was gone his white shirt unbutton where his tie used to be. Dammit. He was not helping my nerves at all.<br /><br />&ldquo;I think I can fix that sugar&rsquo;.&rdquo; He took my hand and led me back inside. &ldquo;Dance with me,&rdquo; he said quietly as he turned on the stereo with the remote. The song Trip began to play. I placed my hands around his neck as we swayed slowly to the music. Bucky never took his eyes off of me. A coy smirk playing on his lips.</p><p>&rdquo;You know Sergeant you look very handsome in that suit. I think maybe you should keep the scruff and shoulder length hair for a while. It&rsquo;s really a good look.&rdquo; I giggled. Now he had me giggling again.</p><p>&rdquo;I love that giggle, &rdquo; he mumbled more to himself than me. &rdquo;M&#259; bucur c&#259; te-ai aprobat pe printesa mea, dar acum vreau s&#259; te aud strig&acirc;nd numele meu cu tine sub mine. (I&rsquo;m glad you approve my princess but right now I want to hear you moaning my name out with you underneath me.) I gave him a confused glance.</p><p>&rdquo;You know I don&rsquo;t understand Romanian right?&rdquo; Bucky beamed down at me with a mischievous smirk.</p><p>Yes. But I also know you love it when I speak to you in a different language. Do you realize what you mean to me? I feel like the luckiest man alive to have you by my side. You are my world. You complete my heart. &rdquo;Ja. Aber ich wei&szlig; auch, dass Sie es lieben, wenn ich mit Ihnen in einer anderen Sprache spreche. Wissen Sie, was Sie f&uuml;r mich bedeuten? Ich f&uuml;hle mich wie der gl&uuml;cklichste Mann am Leben, der Sie an meiner Seite hat. Du bist meine Welt. Du machst mein Herz fertig.&rdquo;</p><p>My eyes filled with happy tears. Dang alpha male.</p><p>Bucky, I love you more than you will ever know. I&rsquo;m so thankful I found you. You are my rock and my heart. Always.&rdquo;Bucky, ich liebe dich mehr, als du je wissen wirst. Ich bin so dankbar, dass ich dich gefunden habe. Du bist mein Stein und mein Herz. Immer. Still, don&rsquo;t know what you said through.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;I think I can help you understand Doll.&rdquo; He brushed his thumb over my lips.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Is that right Sergeant?&rdquo; His blue orbs fluttering to mine and down to my lips. His left hand creased the small of my back and pulled me closer to him as the other one traveled to to bottom hem of my short navy dress pushing it up my leg. His fingers playing softly on my thigh. &nbsp;I closed my eyes as his lips met mine as I moaned into his deep kiss. I soon found myself up in his arms bridal style. &nbsp;My eyes snapped open.</p><p>&ldquo;This is not the threshold Sergeant,&rdquo; I giggled as I swatted at his arm.<br /><br />&ldquo;That is not my intention.&rdquo;</p><p>\"Well then I approve Sergeant,&rdquo; I said looking up through my eyelashes running my hands through his hair.</p><p>&rdquo;M&#259; bucur c&#259; te-ai aprobat pe printesa mea, dar acum vreau s&#259; te aud strig&acirc;nd numele meu cu tine sub mine. (I&rsquo;m glad you approve my princess but right now I want to hear you moaning my name out with you underneath me.) He whispered in my ear causing me to bite my lip as he carried me down the hall to the bedroom.</p><p>&rdquo;Yep, I think I got it now,&rdquo; I said with a head nod.</p><p>(The next morning-Bucky POV)<br /><br />I felt the sheets from the bed shuffle and move as the body next to me, slowly tried to slip from the bed. Gently I grabbed her back and placed her underneath me. Her soft giggles filled the air. &nbsp;I cupped her cheek and kissed her deeply before pulling away.<br /><br />&ldquo;And where do you think you going Mrs.Barnes?&rdquo; I question kissing her neck softly. She breathed in deeply and arched her head back a bit.<br /><br />&ldquo;We got to go and.. ahh~!&rdquo; She breathed out heavily as I nipped and licked at her neck softly. &ldquo;Sergeant.&rdquo; She murmured as my hands slithered down her body, slowly caressing her.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our Honeymoon remember? Four weeks off..&rdquo; She gasped as my hand pressed down softly on her bundle of nerves. She bit her lip, trying not to release building up breaths as I grazed her up and down.<br /><br />&ldquo;But-&rdquo; I cut her off with my lips, silencing her fast. I pulled away and whispered in her ear.<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking way too much. The only thing I want to hear from you right now, is you moaning my name.&rdquo; She released her lip and let out a breathless moan.<br /><br />&ldquo;B-Bucky.&rdquo; She exhaled hard.
