I don\u2019t claim to understand everything, but I do\nthink there is a flaw in your argument. You say it is all about balance, but if\nwe can restore balance by destroying the White Walkers with wildfire and then killing\nthe dragons, why can\u2019t we do it, the other way round? Kill the dragons and then\nthe fire magic is gone, and then White Walkers will die as well.\u201d</p><p>Bran shook\nhis head. <i>We could have done that, if\nDaenerys had let us.

It was interesting how the wall of earth magic he and Jon\nhad built around his mind had changed the dragon. His contained fire was less\ndangerous, more focussed than Drogon\u2019s, but it was still fire. <i>Fire made flesh.</i> Bran briefly touched\nJon\u2019s mind reassuringly.
