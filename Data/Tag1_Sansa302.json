        "question": "I think the Daily Express is the same publication that wrote an article a while back about how there would be a showdown between Sansa and D*ny, and that Sansa would betray everyone out of anger that Jon is in love with D*ny and not her. So like, they were right that Sansa probably won't be fond of D*ny, and they seem to have picked up on Sansa's subconscious feelings for Jon, but geez louise they reached the most spectacularly wrong conclusion from it.",
        "answer": "<p>Yeah, I mean I don\u2019t really take anything the express says seriously, anon, because they seem to just hang out on reddit and turn really stupid theories into clickbait. \n\nAt the same time, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s difficult for even the most casual viewer to understand D*ny and Sansa are going to clash, whether it\u2019s over northern independence, resources, or jon. Could be one of or a mix of these things, and I am super excited to see it play out. Bring on the Winterfell scenes, it\u2019s been 84 years.</p>",
