It was opening week, and they were both so nervous. They\u2019d offer bouquets for weddings and other events. So much money had gone into this. So many loans and help from other friends and family that they really needed to succeed, or they\u2019d be in deep debt.</p><p>The store would be called [Once and Floral/Take it or Leave it/What in Carnation] as a pun, because that way it\u2019d catch on faster. Yoongi\u2019s hands were covered in dirt as the two men set up some hanging plants and a curious kitten watched them from the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon, be careful on the ladder. I don\u2019t want anything or anyone to get broken beyond repair before we even open our doors.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. You worry too much.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWith good reason.\u201d Yoongi shot back with a smile.<br/></p><!-- more --><p>The younger of the two got onto the ladder and his hyung handed him a potted succelent to hang up. When it was secure, they moved onto the next one. The cat came inside to watch and jumped onto stool.</p><p>Before they knew it, opening day arrived and it wasn\u2019t too busy. It was spring, so they\u2019d be getting business soon, right? They were nervous that no one would come in other than their friends and family who would be there just to support them. He sort of wondered where that kitten was who had been there nearly every day.</p><p>\u201cYou lookin for the cat too?\u201d Namjoon asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah. I was gonna give it some cat nip. I don\u2019t see it, though.\u201d<br/></p><p>Then the door opened and he walked in with the kitten. Yoongi couldn\u2019t believe how handsome the man was. He lit up the room and made Yoongi feel like it was just the two of them in that room when the guy approached him with the kitten in hand.</p><p>\u201cSo, you own his shop?\u201d<br/></p><p>Yoongi wanted to say he was right, but the words wouldn\u2019t come out. He just stared at the attractive face before him.</p><p>Namjoon answered,\u00a0\u201cYes. We both own it. Welcome! What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is (Y/n). It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIs this little fella yours?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s been running away for the past week. This time I followed her to figure out where she\u2019s been going to. Her name is Yoonji, and she\u2019s a fickle little thing.\u201d</p><p>They smiled and Yoongi laughed and reached out for the kitten,\u00a0\u201cSo, you\u2019re not a stray after all, huh Yoongi. We also have similar names. Ah, I\u2019ve got a gift for you if your dad will allow it.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi met (Y/N)\u2019s eyes and looked back at the kitten,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s cat nip. You were just so fun to have around, I wanted to give you a gift.\u201d</p><p>Making his voice higher, the handsome stranger replied as Yoongi,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t care what papa says, so can I have some. Please???\u201d</p><p>They laughed and Yoongi went to get it from the back room. It was freshly grown and put into a small pouch. He took this time to make it a bit prettier than he was originally intending to do. This man was so good looking, his cat deserved something nice too. Yoongi caught his breath.</p><p>Why was he so cute? It amazed him how smitten he was all of a sudden, especially with all the friends he had small crushes on. Out of the blue, they no longer seemed to matter. He really wanted to impress (Y/N).</p><p>Once Yoongi got back to him, Yoonji\u2019s ears went up and she started to purr and reach out for the pouch. Namjoon gone off to help some potential customers. The first 100 would get a free pack of vegetable seeds and a special pot with the business\u2019s logo on it. She rubbed her cheek against the gift.</p><p>\u201cI think she likes it.\u201d (Y/N) smiled.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou gonna stick around? I can show you around the store and tell me if there\u2019s anything you like.\u201d<br/></p><p>(Y/N) liked that idea and was shown around by the man he just met. Yoongi payed closed attention to what he seemed to like while the kitten purred away in his arms. He told the story of how they got started, trying to do a sales pitch but also the cutie seemed like he was really interested in what he was saying.</p><p>The bell went off. They had gotten their first sale! A dozen roses for a girl dressed in a dark and flowing outfit. She smiled when all attention was put on her and everyone cheered. They got\u00a0 a free vase along with their purchase since they were the first along with the pot and seeds.</p><p>The owners got a picture with the gothic girl as well for memory\u2019s sake. Yoongi then returned with to the man.</p><p>\u201cSo, you live nearby?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, yes.\u201d The guy said.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re a few blocks away, but we don\u2019t come this way very often.\u201d<br/></p><p>Yoongi nodded,\u00a0\u201cCuz the shops are mostly on the other side.\u201d</p><p>He agreed,\u00a0\u201cExactly, but I think we\u2019ll be coming here more often. Won\u2019t we, Yoonji?\u201d</p><p>She was still purring away but gave a small mew at her name. (Y/N) decided to get an aloe vera plant as well as some colorful Bromeliads to go inside his apartment. As a salesman, Yoongi persuaded the cute man to also get some orchids.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them wrapped, too. Something simple.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Yoongi grinned and moved over to the counter, wrapping the purple beauties in gray paper and tying it closed with a pinkish bow.<br/></p><p>As the man watched the skillful work, Yoongi noticed the contrast of their hands. The florist was pale compared to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really good with your hands.\u201d He said in awe.<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Yoongi blushed.\u00a0\u201cYou said you lived nearby?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u00a0He lived on the fourth floor, so it was a beautiful view of nightlife. Yoongi joked that he might come visit as they moved towards the cash register to get the flowers paid for with the pot and seeds.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be fun. I\u2019ll have to ask my boyfriend first.\u201d<br/></p><p>The playful smile left Yoongi\u2019s face,\u00a0\u201cB-boyfriend you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Been dating four months now? I\u2019ll probably get flowers for our 6th month anniversary here when that happens.\u201d<br/></p><p>Yoongi felt kind of sad, but it was just a crush anyways,\u00a0\u201cOh, well. Congrats ahead of time. Thanks for stopping by, (Y/N). See you around, Yoonji.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door for the man who had his arms full and waved goodbye to them. His face fell into a pouty relaxed state. <i>Well <b>that </b>was a train wreck</i>, he thought to himself and went back inside to help others. Then it was closing time. The two men went their seperate ways to get some rest for tomorrow.</p><hr><p>Yoongi yawned as he was the first one at the store. Yoonji was waiting at the door, and the two greeted each other. She came by every day. Sometimes she brought a friend or two. Children came to the store more to greet her and pet her. Sometimes (Y/N) would show up and check in, buying flowers or planting tools he needed. He\u2019d talk about his boyfriend too.</p><p>It would be their six month anniversary, and (Y/N) wanted Yoongi to be the one to make a love bouquet for them. Their was one on their menu, but he didn\u2019t want that for his darling.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be unique. Special, like my love him. Reds and pinks, maybe whites. He likes blue, so maybe some of that?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi gave a smile even though seeing him all the time and hearing about his heart belonging to someone else hurt a bunch. It brought pain into his heart, but as long as he could see him it\u2019d be ok. Right?</p><p>That\u2019s what he thought as Yoonji\u00a0hopped up on one of the tables and rested in the sunlight while he made his love\u2019s bouquet. Red carnations, a few pink peonies, blue orchids around the edges, with oxeye daisies sprinkled throughout. Everything he thought about (Y/N), and he\u2019d be giving it to someone else.</p><p>The young man sighed, taking his gloves off and putting the arrangement on the shelf. He sent the official text saying that it was ready. Yoongi went over to his kitty counterpart and rubbed her fur, letting her climb up into his lap as he sat in a lower chair behind the counter. The\u00a0\u201cIn Bloom\u201d sign still burning bright to signify that they were open.</p><p>Namjoon was sick today, so it was just Yoongi and Yoonji and the sun and a million plants.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky, you know that?\u201d He said to her.\u00a0\u201cNot only do you get to do whatever you want whenever you want like sleep or go for a walk, but you also live with (Y/N). I\u2019d do anything to be able to be held by him like you constantly are.\u201d</p><p>Yoonji purred.</p><p>He kept talking,\u00a0\u201cI really like him, you know? I have a huge crush on him, but he\u2019s got a boyfriend. It\u2019s crazy, right? Still. I\u2019d like to at least be his friends if we aren\u2019t able to date one another. Any excuse to be near him. That\u2019s why you\u2019re so lucky. You know what he likes and dislikes better than anyone. I\u2019d love to be (Y/N)\u2019s kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you really?\u201d<br/></p><p>The voice made Yoongi jump and the kitten jumped to the counter and into her owner\u2019s arms to purr against him. A fierce blush started to paint itself across the florist\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what to say,\u00a0\u201cI&hellip;I didn\u2019t hear you come in.\u201d He couldn\u2019t meet the handsome customer\u2019s face as so many thoughts of fear and embarrassment ran though his mind.</p><p>\u201cBell\u2019s broken.\u201d (Y/N) sniffled.<br/></p><p>Yoongi looked up to see his eyes swollen and more red than usual even with his allergies to some of the exotic plants the store provided.</p><p>\u201cAre you&ndash;?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe broke up.\u201d He admitted.\u00a0\u201cI got your text and we started arguing. He said I spent too much time here instead of with him. I\u2019d told him about you and he said that it was beacause&hellip;because I had a crush on you.\u201d</p><p>The florist\u2019s fragile heart grasped onto this seed of hope,\u00a0\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip,\u00a0\u201cI said he was wrong&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Yoongi looked down, of course.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if he was.\u201d He paced a bit.\u00a0\u201cI came down here even though I could\u2019ve just texted you back and said to cancel the order. Instead I <i>really </i>just wanted to see you.\u201d<br/></p><p>Alarm bells of confusion went off in Yoongi\u2019s head as he went to the other side of the counter,\u00a0\u201cI think you should go. Try to fix things with your boyfriend. I\u2019m not gonna be your rebound, so I think it\u2019d just be better if you just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really feel that way, kitten?\u201d<br/></p><p>The blush got brighter,\u00a0\u201cD-don\u2019t call me that.\u201d he pouted.</p><p>\u201cAnd why not? You seemed to like it.\u201d<br/></p><p>He did,\u00a0\u201cI just don\u2019t think this is right. I\u2019m not just gonna date you because you broke up with your boyfriend on your 6th month anniversary and you\u2019re looking for someone to replace him.\u201d</p><p>(Y/N) replied,\u00a0\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d and approached Yoongi.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll wait a while to see if this feeling stays, but I\u2019ve been coming over almost every day for you. Yoonji could\u2019ve run away anywhere but chose here. She chose you, and she hissed at him all the time. She\u2019s smarter than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSo, I wanted to be with you the moment I saw you, Yoongi. I will be serious about our relationship. You\u2019re not a rebound or anything like that.\u201d He looked around the shop and handed Yoongi a red tulip.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s face almost matched it,\u00a0\u201cYou paid attention.\u201d He said, biting his lip.</p><p>He would blabber on and on about the meanings of flowers when they were together, just chatting. (Y/N) seemed interested enough, and it was something that Yoongi loved. Red tulips were for\u00a0\u201cundying love\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is how I feel about you now. I\u2019ll buy a flower everyday to show you how serious I am. If it ever changes, we can stop whatever it is that happens from this moment on.\u201d<br/></p><p>(Y/N) decided to head out with his kitty Yoonji in his arms. Yoongi looked down at the tulip and told him to wait. Going to a bucket of carnations, he picked out a white one and gave it to the man. Devotion. The man smiled at the paler and shorter florist.</p><hr><p>It had been nearly two months now, and red tulips flooded Yoongi\u2019s apartment so much so that (Y/N) would just point to the flower that expressed his feelings for that day.</p><p>\u201cI get it, darling. Ok, I believe it. You love me. I\u2019m not a rebound or anything like that. That being said, will you go on a date with me?\u201d<br/></p>",

Something simple.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Yoongi grinned and moved over to the counter, wrapping the purple beauties in gray paper and tying it closed with a pinkish bow.<br></p><p>As the man watched the skillful work, Yoongi noticed the contrast of their hands. The florist was pale compared to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really good with your hands.\u201d He said in awe.<br></p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Yoongi blushed.\u00a0\u201cYou said you lived nearby?\u201d<br></p><p>\u00a0He lived on the fourth floor, so it was a beautiful view of nightlife. Yoongi joked that he might come visit as they moved towards the cash register to get the flowers paid for with the pot and seeds.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be fun. I\u2019ll have to ask my boyfriend first.\u201d<br></p><p>The playful smile left Yoongi\u2019s face,\u00a0\u201cB-boyfriend you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Been dating four months now? I\u2019ll probably get flowers for our 6th month anniversary here when that happens.\u201d<br></p><p>Yoongi felt kind of sad, but it was just a crush anyways,\u00a0\u201cOh, well. Congrats ahead of time. Thanks for stopping by, (Y/N). See you around, Yoonji.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door for the man who had his arms full and waved goodbye to them. His face fell into a pouty relaxed state. <i>Well <b>that </b>was a train wreck</i>, he thought to himself and went back inside to help others. Then it was closing time. The two men went their seperate ways to get some rest for tomorrow.</p><hr><p>Yoongi yawned as he was the first one at the store. Yoonji was waiting at the door, and the two greeted each other. She came by every day. Sometimes she brought a friend or two. Children came to the store more to greet her and pet her. Sometimes (Y/N) would show up and check in, buying flowers or planting tools he needed. He\u2019d talk about his boyfriend too.</p><p>It would be their six month anniversary, and (Y/N) wanted Yoongi to be the one to make a love bouquet for them. Their was one on their menu, but he didn\u2019t want that for his darling.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be unique. Special, like my love him. Reds and pinks, maybe whites. He likes blue, so maybe some of that?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi gave a smile even though seeing him all the time and hearing about his heart belonging to someone else hurt a bunch. It brought pain into his heart, but as long as he could see him it\u2019d be ok. Right?</p><p>That\u2019s what he thought as Yoonji\u00a0hopped up on one of the tables and rested in the sunlight while he made his love\u2019s bouquet. Red carnations, a few pink peonies, blue orchids around the edges, with oxeye daisies sprinkled throughout. Everything he thought about (Y/N), and he\u2019d be giving it to someone else.</p><p>The young man sighed, taking his gloves off and putting the arrangement on the shelf. He sent the official text saying that it was ready. Yoongi went over to his kitty counterpart and rubbed her fur, letting her climb up into his lap as he sat in a lower chair behind the counter. The\u00a0\u201cIn Bloom\u201d sign still burning bright to signify that they were open.</p><p>Namjoon was sick today, so it was just Yoongi and Yoonji and the sun and a million plants.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky, you know that?\u201d He said to her.\u00a0\u201cNot only do you get to do whatever you want whenever you want like sleep or go for a walk, but you also live with (Y/N). I\u2019d do anything to be able to be held by him like you constantly are.\u201d</p><p>Yoonji purred.</p><p>He kept talking,\u00a0\u201cI really like him, you know? I have a huge crush on him, but he\u2019s got a boyfriend. It\u2019s crazy, right? Still. I\u2019d like to at least be his friends if we aren\u2019t able to date one another. Any excuse to be near him. That\u2019s why you\u2019re so lucky. You know what he likes and dislikes better than anyone. I\u2019d love to be (Y/N)\u2019s kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you really?\u201d<br></p><p>The voice made Yoongi jump and the kitten jumped to the counter and into her owner\u2019s arms to purr against him. A fierce blush started to paint itself across the florist\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what to say,\u00a0\u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t hear you come in.\u201d He couldn\u2019t meet the handsome customer\u2019s face as so many thoughts of fear and embarrassment ran though his mind.</p><p>\u201cBell\u2019s broken.\u201d (Y/N) sniffled.<br></p><p>Yoongi looked up to see his eyes swollen and more red than usual even with his allergies to some of the exotic plants the store provided.</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2013?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe broke up.\u201d He admitted.\u00a0\u201cI got your text and we started arguing. He said I spent too much time here instead of with him. I\u2019d told him about you and he said that it was beacause\u2026because I had a crush on you.\u201d</p><p>The florist\u2019s fragile heart grasped onto this seed of hope,\u00a0\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip,\u00a0\u201cI said he was wrong\u2026\u201d</p><p>Yoongi looked down, of course.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if he was.\u201d He paced a bit.\u00a0\u201cI came down here even though I could\u2019ve just texted you back and said to cancel the order. Instead I <i>really </i>just wanted to see you.\u201d<br></p><p>Alarm bells of confusion went off in Yoongi\u2019s head as he went to the other side of the counter,\u00a0\u201cI think you should go. Try to fix things with your boyfriend. I\u2019m not gonna be your rebound, so I think it\u2019d just be better if you just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really feel that way, kitten?\u201d<br></p><p>The blush got brighter,\u00a0\u201cD-don\u2019t call me that.\u201d he pouted.</p><p>\u201cAnd why not? You seemed to like it.\u201d<br></p><p>He did,\u00a0\u201cI just don\u2019t think this is right. I\u2019m not just gonna date you because you broke up with your boyfriend on your 6th month anniversary and you\u2019re looking for someone to replace him.\u201d</p><p>(Y/N) replied,\u00a0\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d and approached Yoongi.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll wait a while to see if this feeling stays, but I\u2019ve been coming over almost every day for you. Yoonji could\u2019ve run away anywhere but chose here. She chose you, and she hissed at him all the time. She\u2019s smarter than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo, I wanted to be with you the moment I saw you, Yoongi. I will be serious about our relationship. You\u2019re not a rebound or anything like that.\u201d He looked around the shop and handed Yoongi a red tulip.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s face almost matched it,\u00a0\u201cYou paid attention.\u201d He said, biting his lip.</p><p>He would blabber on and on about the meanings of flowers when they were together, just chatting. (Y/N) seemed interested enough, and it was something that Yoongi loved. Red tulips were for\u00a0\u201cundying love\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is how I feel about you now. I\u2019ll buy a flower everyday to show you how serious I am. If it ever changes, we can stop whatever it is that happens from this moment on.\u201d<br></p><p>(Y/N) decided to head out with his kitty Yoonji in his arms. Yoongi looked down at the tulip and told him to wait. Going to a bucket of carnations, he picked out a white one and gave it to the man. Devotion. The man smiled at the paler and shorter florist.</p><hr><p>It had been nearly two months now, and red tulips flooded Yoongi\u2019s apartment so much so that (Y/N) would just point to the flower that expressed his feelings for that day.</p><p>\u201cI get it, darling. Ok, I believe it. You love me. I\u2019m not a rebound or anything like that. That being said, will you go on a date with me?\u201d<br></p>",

It was opening week, and they were both so nervous. They\u2019d offer bouquets for weddings and other events. So much money had gone into this. So many loans and help from other friends and family that they really needed to succeed, or they\u2019d be in deep debt.</p><p>The store would be called [Once and Floral/Take it or Leave it/What in Carnation] as a pun, because that way it\u2019d catch on faster. Yoongi\u2019s hands were covered in dirt as the two men set up some hanging plants and a curious kitten watched them from the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon, be careful on the ladder. I don\u2019t want anything or anyone to get broken beyond repair before we even open our doors.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. You worry too much.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWith good reason.\u201d Yoongi shot back with a smile.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>The younger of the two got onto the ladder and his hyung handed him a potted succelent to hang up. When it was secure, they moved onto the next one. The cat came inside to watch and jumped onto stool.</p><p>Before they knew it, opening day arrived and it wasn\u2019t too busy. It was spring, so they\u2019d be getting business soon, right? They were nervous that no one would come in other than their friends and family who would be there just to support them. He sort of wondered where that kitten was who had been there nearly every day.</p><p>\u201cYou lookin for the cat too?\u201d Namjoon asked.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah. I was gonna give it some cat nip. I don\u2019t see it, though.\u201d<br></p><p>Then the door opened and he walked in with the kitten. Yoongi couldn\u2019t believe how handsome the man was. He lit up the room and made Yoongi feel like it was just the two of them in that room when the guy approached him with the kitten in hand.</p><p>\u201cSo, you own his shop?\u201d<br></p><p>Yoongi wanted to say he was right, but the words wouldn\u2019t come out. He just stared at the attractive face before him.</p><p>Namjoon answered,\u00a0\u201cYes. We both own it. Welcome! What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is (Y/n). It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs this little fella yours?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s been running away for the past week. This time I followed her to figure out where she\u2019s been going to. Her name is Yoonji, and she\u2019s a fickle little thing.\u201d</p><p>They smiled and Yoongi laughed and reached out for the kitten,\u00a0\u201cSo, you\u2019re not a stray after all, huh Yoongi. We also have similar names. Ah, I\u2019ve got a gift for you if your dad will allow it.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi met (Y/N)\u2019s eyes and looked back at the kitten,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s cat nip. You were just so fun to have around, I wanted to give you a gift.\u201d</p><p>Making his voice higher, the handsome stranger replied as Yoongi,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t care what papa says, so can I have some. Please???\u201d</p><p>They laughed and Yoongi went to get it from the back room. It was freshly grown and put into a small pouch. He took this time to make it a bit prettier than he was originally intending to do. This man was so good looking, his cat deserved something nice too. Yoongi caught his breath.</p><p>Why was he so cute? It amazed him how smitten he was all of a sudden, especially with all the friends he had small crushes on. Out of the blue, they no longer seemed to matter. He really wanted to impress (Y/N).</p><p>Once Yoongi got back to him, Yoonji\u2019s ears went up and she started to purr and reach out for the pouch. Namjoon gone off to help some potential customers. The first 100 would get a free pack of vegetable seeds and a special pot with the business\u2019s logo on it. She rubbed her cheek against the gift.</p><p>\u201cI think she likes it.\u201d (Y/N) smiled.<br></p><p>\u201cYou gonna stick around? I can show you around the store and tell me if there\u2019s anything you like.\u201d<br></p><p>(Y/N) liked that idea and was shown around by the man he just met. Yoongi payed closed attention to what he seemed to like while the kitten purred away in his arms. He told the story of how they got started, trying to do a sales pitch but also the cutie seemed like he was really interested in what he was saying.</p><p>The bell went off. They had gotten their first sale! A dozen roses for a girl dressed in a dark and flowing outfit. She smiled when all attention was put on her and everyone cheered. They got\u00a0 a free vase along with their purchase since they were the first along with the pot and seeds.</p><p>The owners got a picture with the gothic girl as well for memory\u2019s sake. Yoongi then returned with to the man.</p><p>\u201cSo, you live nearby?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, yes.\u201d The guy said.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re a few blocks away, but we don\u2019t come this way very often.\u201d<br></p><p>Yoongi nodded,\u00a0\u201cCuz the shops are mostly on the other side.\u201d</p><p>He agreed,\u00a0\u201cExactly, but I think we\u2019ll be coming here more often. Won\u2019t we, Yoonji?\u201d</p><p>She was still purring away but gave a small mew at her name. (Y/N) decided to get an aloe vera plant as well as some colorful Bromeliads to go inside his apartment. As a salesman, Yoongi persuaded the cute man to also get some orchids.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them wrapped, too.

You\u2019re not a rebound or anything like that.\u201d He looked around the shop and handed Yoongi a red tulip.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s face almost matched it,\u00a0\u201cYou paid attention.\u201d He said, biting his lip.</p><p>He would blabber on and on about the meanings of flowers when they were together, just chatting. (Y/N) seemed interested enough, and it was something that Yoongi loved. Red tulips were for\u00a0\u201cundying love\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is how I feel about you now. I\u2019ll buy a flower everyday to show you how serious I am. If it ever changes, we can stop whatever it is that happens from this moment on.\u201d<br></p><p>(Y/N) decided to head out with his kitty Yoonji in his arms. Yoongi looked down at the tulip and told him to wait. Going to a bucket of carnations, he picked out a white one and gave it to the man. Devotion. The man smiled at the paler and shorter florist.</p><hr><p>It had been nearly two months now, and red tulips flooded Yoongi\u2019s apartment so much so that (Y/N) would just point to the flower that expressed his feelings for that day.</p><p>\u201cI get it, darling. Ok, I believe it. You love me. I\u2019m not a rebound or anything like that. That being said, will you go on a date with me?\u201d<br></p>",

It was opening week, and they were both so nervous. They&rsquo;d offer bouquets for weddings and other events. So much money had gone into this. So many loans and help from other friends and family that they really needed to succeed, or they&rsquo;d be in deep debt.</p><p>The store would be called [Once and Floral/Take it or Leave it/What in Carnation] as a pun, because that way it&rsquo;d catch on faster. Yoongi&rsquo;s hands were covered in dirt as the two men set up some hanging plants and a curious kitten watched them from the sidewalk.</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon, be careful on the ladder. I don&rsquo;t want anything or anyone to get broken beyond repair before we even open our doors.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine. You worry too much.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;With good reason.&rdquo; Yoongi shot back with a smile.<br /></p><p>The younger of the two got onto the ladder and his hyung handed him a potted succelent to hang up. When it was secure, they moved onto the next one. The cat came inside to watch and jumped onto stool.</p><p>Before they knew it, opening day arrived and it wasn&rsquo;t too busy. It was spring, so they&rsquo;d be getting business soon, right? They were nervous that no one would come in other than their friends and family who would be there just to support them. He sort of wondered where that kitten was who had been there nearly every day.</p><p>&ldquo;You lookin for the cat too?&rdquo; Namjoon asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I was gonna give it some cat nip. I don&rsquo;t see it, though.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Then the door opened and he walked in with the kitten. Yoongi couldn&rsquo;t believe how handsome the man was. He lit up the room and made Yoongi feel like it was just the two of them in that room when the guy approached him with the kitten in hand.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you own his shop?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Yoongi wanted to say he was right, but the words wouldn&rsquo;t come out. He just stared at the attractive face before him.</p><p>Namjoon answered,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. We both own it. Welcome! What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My name is (Y/n). It&rsquo;s nice to meet you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is this little fella yours?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s been running away for the past week. This time I followed her to figure out where she&rsquo;s been going to. Her name is Yoonji, and she&rsquo;s a fickle little thing.&rdquo;</p><p>They smiled and Yoongi laughed and reached out for the kitten,&nbsp;&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re not a stray after all, huh Yoongi. We also have similar names. Ah, I&rsquo;ve got a gift for you if your dad will allow it.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi met (Y/N)&rsquo;s eyes and looked back at the kitten,&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cat nip. You were just so fun to have around, I wanted to give you a gift.&rdquo;</p><p>Making his voice higher, the handsome stranger replied as Yoongi,&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what papa says, so can I have some. Please???&rdquo;</p><p>They laughed and Yoongi went to get it from the back room. It was freshly grown and put into a small pouch. He took this time to make it a bit prettier than he was originally intending to do. This man was so good looking, his cat deserved something nice too. Yoongi caught his breath.</p><p>Why was he so cute? It amazed him how smitten he was all of a sudden, especially with all the friends he had small crushes on. Out of the blue, they no longer seemed to matter. He really wanted to impress (Y/N).</p><p>Once Yoongi got back to him, Yoonji&rsquo;s ears went up and she started to purr and reach out for the pouch. Namjoon gone off to help some potential customers. The first 100 would get a free pack of vegetable seeds and a special pot with the business&rsquo;s logo on it. She rubbed her cheek against the gift.</p><p>&ldquo;I think she likes it.&rdquo; (Y/N) smiled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You gonna stick around? I can show you around the store and tell me if there&rsquo;s anything you like.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>(Y/N) liked that idea and was shown around by the man he just met. Yoongi payed closed attention to what he seemed to like while the kitten purred away in his arms. He told the story of how they got started, trying to do a sales pitch but also the cutie seemed like he was really interested in what he was saying.</p><p>The bell went off. They had gotten their first sale! A dozen roses for a girl dressed in a dark and flowing outfit. She smiled when all attention was put on her and everyone cheered. They got&nbsp; a free vase along with their purchase since they were the first along with the pot and seeds.</p><p>The owners got a picture with the gothic girl as well for memory&rsquo;s sake. Yoongi then returned with to the man.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you live nearby?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yes.&rdquo; The guy said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a few blocks away, but we don&rsquo;t come this way very often.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Yoongi nodded,&nbsp;&ldquo;Cuz the shops are mostly on the other side.&rdquo;</p><p>He agreed,&nbsp;&ldquo;Exactly, but I think we&rsquo;ll be coming here more often. Won&rsquo;t we, Yoonji?&rdquo;</p><p>She was still purring away but gave a small mew at her name. (Y/N) decided to get an aloe vera plant as well as some colorful Bromeliads to go inside his apartment. As a salesman, Yoongi persuaded the cute man to also get some orchids.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get them wrapped, too. Something simple.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; Yoongi grinned and moved over to the counter, wrapping the purple beauties in gray paper and tying it closed with a pinkish bow.<br /></p><p>As the man watched the skillful work, Yoongi noticed the contrast of their hands. The florist was pale compared to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really good with your hands.&rdquo; He said in awe.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Yoongi blushed.&nbsp;&ldquo;You said you lived nearby?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&nbsp;He lived on the fourth floor, so it was a beautiful view of nightlife. Yoongi joked that he might come visit as they moved towards the cash register to get the flowers paid for with the pot and seeds.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be fun. I&rsquo;ll have to ask my boyfriend first.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The playful smile left Yoongi&rsquo;s face,&nbsp;&ldquo;B-boyfriend you say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep. Been dating four months now? I&rsquo;ll probably get flowers for our 6th month anniversary here when that happens.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Yoongi felt kind of sad, but it was just a crush anyways,&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, well. Congrats ahead of time. Thanks for stopping by, (Y/N). See you around, Yoonji.&rdquo;</p><p>He opened the door for the man who had his arms full and waved goodbye to them. His face fell into a pouty relaxed state. <i>Well <b>that </b>was a train wreck</i>, he thought to himself and went back inside to help others. Then it was closing time. The two men went their seperate ways to get some rest for tomorrow.</p><hr /><p>Yoongi yawned as he was the first one at the store. Yoonji was waiting at the door, and the two greeted each other. She came by every day. Sometimes she brought a friend or two. Children came to the store more to greet her and pet her. Sometimes (Y/N) would show up and check in, buying flowers or planting tools he needed. He&rsquo;d talk about his boyfriend too.</p><p>It would be their six month anniversary, and (Y/N) wanted Yoongi to be the one to make a love bouquet for them. Their was one on their menu, but he didn&rsquo;t want that for his darling.</p><p>&ldquo;It has to be unique. Special, like my love him. Reds and pinks, maybe whites. He likes blue, so maybe some of that?&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi gave a smile even though seeing him all the time and hearing about his heart belonging to someone else hurt a bunch. It brought pain into his heart, but as long as he could see him it&rsquo;d be ok. Right?</p><p>That&rsquo;s what he thought as Yoonji&nbsp;hopped up on one of the tables and rested in the sunlight while he made his love&rsquo;s bouquet. Red carnations, a few pink peonies, blue orchids around the edges, with oxeye daisies sprinkled throughout. Everything he thought about (Y/N), and he&rsquo;d be giving it to someone else.</p><p>The young man sighed, taking his gloves off and putting the arrangement on the shelf. He sent the official text saying that it was ready. Yoongi went over to his kitty counterpart and rubbed her fur, letting her climb up into his lap as he sat in a lower chair behind the counter. The&nbsp;&ldquo;In Bloom&rdquo; sign still burning bright to signify that they were open.</p><p>Namjoon was sick today, so it was just Yoongi and Yoonji and the sun and a million plants.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky, you know that?&rdquo; He said to her.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not only do you get to do whatever you want whenever you want like sleep or go for a walk, but you also live with (Y/N). I&rsquo;d do anything to be able to be held by him like you constantly are.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoonji purred.</p><p>He kept talking,&nbsp;&ldquo;I really like him, you know? I have a huge crush on him, but he&rsquo;s got a boyfriend. It&rsquo;s crazy, right? Still. I&rsquo;d like to at least be his friends if we aren&rsquo;t able to date one another. Any excuse to be near him. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re so lucky. You know what he likes and dislikes better than anyone. I&rsquo;d love to be (Y/N)&rsquo;s kitten.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you really?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The voice made Yoongi jump and the kitten jumped to the counter and into her owner&rsquo;s arms to purr against him. A fierce blush started to paint itself across the florist&rsquo;s cheeks.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t hear you come in.&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t meet the handsome customer&rsquo;s face as so many thoughts of fear and embarrassment ran though his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Bell&rsquo;s broken.&rdquo; (Y/N) sniffled.<br /></p><p>Yoongi looked up to see his eyes swollen and more red than usual even with his allergies to some of the exotic plants the store provided.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you&ndash;?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We broke up.&rdquo; He admitted.&nbsp;&ldquo;I got your text and we started arguing. He said I spent too much time here instead of with him. I&rsquo;d told him about you and he said that it was beacause&hellip;because I had a crush on you.&rdquo;</p><p>The florist&rsquo;s fragile heart grasped onto this seed of hope,&nbsp;&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p><p>He bit his lip,&nbsp;&ldquo;I said he was wrong&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi looked down, of course.</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not sure if he was.&rdquo; He paced a bit.&nbsp;&ldquo;I came down here even though I could&rsquo;ve just texted you back and said to cancel the order. Instead I <i>really </i>just wanted to see you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Alarm bells of confusion went off in Yoongi&rsquo;s head as he went to the other side of the counter,&nbsp;&ldquo;I think you should go. Try to fix things with your boyfriend. I&rsquo;m not gonna be your rebound, so I think it&rsquo;d just be better if you just left.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you really feel that way, kitten?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The blush got brighter,&nbsp;&ldquo;D-don&rsquo;t call me that.&rdquo; he pouted.</p><p>&ldquo;And why not? You seemed to like it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He did,&nbsp;&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think this is right. I&rsquo;m not just gonna date you because you broke up with your boyfriend on your 6th month anniversary and you&rsquo;re looking for someone to replace him.&rdquo;</p><p>(Y/N) replied,&nbsp;&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; and approached Yoongi.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait a while to see if this feeling stays, but I&rsquo;ve been coming over almost every day for you. Yoonji could&rsquo;ve run away anywhere but chose here. She chose you, and she hissed at him all the time. She&rsquo;s smarter than me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So, I wanted to be with you the moment I saw you, Yoongi. I will be serious about our relationship. You&rsquo;re not a rebound or anything like that.&rdquo; He looked around the shop and handed Yoongi a red tulip.</p><p>Yoongi&rsquo;s face almost matched it,&nbsp;&ldquo;You paid attention.&rdquo; He said, biting his lip.</p><p>He would blabber on and on about the meanings of flowers when they were together, just chatting.

It was a restaurant chain that he started in high school, but he didn\u2019t do any of the cooking himself nowadays. He rarely had time to eat a decent meal since he was the CEO and business was booming. Jin was getting interest from some people overseas to expand his business to other countries. America, China, Australia, Japan, the UK, and even some places in Africa</p><p>He was going to do it, of course. If the profit was worth it. If not, then he\u2019d go somewhere better for the company. The 27 year old had over 100 people in his locations so far. But that wasn\u2019t for him to figure out. Not yet. The numbers and organization went to his office workers. He looked over at his sushi themed <a href=\"https://global.rakuten.com/en/store/giftjapan/item/clsushiw/\">clock</a>, and it was ten minutes to ikura.</p><!-- more --><p>His secratary knocked on his door, and he looked at her pretty face.</p><p>\u201cSajang-nim, the meeting is happening soon. We should make our way to the meeting room.\u201d She said from behind her long lashes.<br/></p><p>Jin stood up,\u00a0\u201cThank you, Naeun. What room will it be today?\u201d He buttoned up his blazer and checked his hair in the mirror before leaving his office.</p><p>\u201cRoom 5C as you requested, sajang-nim.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGood, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He enjoyed the click of he black heels on the tile floors. Her black pants were creased to perfection, and it seemed like she had gotten a new tie to go with her white dress shirt. Son Naeun didn\u2019t wear her blazer which was ok since the air conditioning had been on the fritz today. The repairman wouldn\u2019t come until tomorrow. Sweat was beading down the side of her face, but she didn\u2019t let it bother her.</p><p>A professional. That\u2019s what Naeun was, and Jin would have it no other way. Her black hair was in a loose wavy bun. Pink cheeks. Lips that looked incredibly soft as a small bead of sweat dripped from her nose onto them. Jin offered her his extra handkerchief.</p><p>She took it,\u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Did you already set up all the folders?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, actually, sir&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>Jin held up his hand to silence her,\u00a0\u201cOne moment, please.\u201d</p><p>A young man was in the meeting room, looking through the yellow files and counted the seats. He was incredibly handsome. Still. Jin knew everyone in the company, and he didn\u2019t know this man. There was no way that he\u2019d forget a face like his.</p><p>\u201cYoung man, you\u2019re not supposed to be in here.\u201d<br/></p><p>Naeun spoke up,\u00a0\u201cSajang-nim, this is the intern that came in today. He showed up early, so I put him to work setting up the folders for the meeting since introducing him was the first on the agenda anyways. I hope that is alright with you, sir.\u201d</p><p>He nodded,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s fine. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>The intern bowed,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. My name is (Y/L/N) (Y/F/N) and I am eager to be working for your company, sir.\u201d</p><p>(Y/N) had on black pants and a white dress shirt with a black blazer on. He knew today\u2019s dress code which was a good start. Jin gave a small bow in return and looked around the meeting room. There were drinks set up with every folder.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, (Y/N). We\u2019re glad to have you here. Are these drinks from you?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I thought it would be better to set it up here than to disturb people while they were working to give it to them.\u201d<br/></p><p>Jin nodded,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s good. Very thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>People started to trickle in, and the meeting commenced. (Y/N) introduced himself to his new co-workers, saying that he hoped to be an official member of the company with them one day. They then went over their plans for expanding and how much money it would take, and if it was even worth the cost.</p><p>America was a good contender, but there were already so many other Asian food places there. (Y/N) spoke up and spoke about food deserts. It\u2019d be good for business to set up shop in a place that had no other eateries for miles, basically a captive clientele, but also they didn\u2019t have to go so far just to eat.</p><p>\u201cI like that idea. Mina, I need a list of food deserts and the details on that for the next meeting. Keep the list short, though. Top 50 that would work best for us.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGood job, (Y/N).\u201d Jin gave the young man a smile and got one in return that made his heart skip\u00a0 a beat. He cleared his throat and looked at the schedule to hide his blush.\u00a0\u201cThe last thing on the list is budget projections, but we can save that for next time. Meeting adjourned.\u201d<br/></p><p>Everyone got up and left the room to return to their work as well as get started on assignments they had gotten during the meeting. Jin made sure to check in with the young man who had stolen all of his attention today. Asked if he wanted to have a late lunch together at a ramyun place down the street.</p><p>He said yes, and went after Jin answered a few questions by the company\u2019s youngest male employee. He had some trouble with his binder and had to leave the meeting, so he had missed a few things. Jin helped with what he could but ended up having Secretary Naeun finish everything lest he keep (Y/N) waiting.</p><p>Jin ordered for the both of them and asked the young man,\u00a0\u201cSo, why did you want to join the company in the first place? I\u2019m sure there are many more popular companies that you\u2019d do just as well in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this is a bit of a tragic backstory, but your restaurant&rsquo;s food was the last meal my mom ever ate. It was when you had just opened on Jeju. She smiled for the first time since hearing about her diagnosis getting worse, and so I decided to work for the company that put that smile on my mom\u2019s face.\u201d<br/></p><p>He was about to cry. Jin\u2019s lower lip quivered,\u00a0\u201cOh my gosh, you\u2019re such a good son! I\u2019m sure your mom would be proud of you! Keep working hard like you have been and you\u2019ll make it in the company, no doubt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking.\u201d<br/></p><p>Jin\u2019s mouth fell open and the man began to laugh at the reaction. Their food was ordered in the middle and they thanked the waiter.</p><p>\u201cYou seriously joked about that? I thought you were serious!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m an orphan that got too old, so I was homeless for a bit. A friend is letting me sleep on her couch until I get back on my feet, so I saw an ad and decided why not.\u201d<br/></p><p>Jin nodded,\u00a0\u201cWere you really an orphan?\u201d</p><p>He filled his mouth with noodles,\u00a0\u201cYep. Went in when I was 6. Just dropped off in broad daylight with a note pinned to my overalls. Don\u2019t remember my parents much.\u201d He swallowed.\u00a0\u201cSounds better than a dead mom, so I start with that. Don\u2019t want any pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. Anyways, what are you hoping for as you become part of our company, (Y/N)?\u201d<br/></p><p>He just wanted to be able to support himself and whatever future family he would have. That was good enough for Jin, so they finished off their lunch and headed back to the office. This was the first decent meal the CEO had eaten in a while, so he thanked the intern before getting back to his work.</p><hr><p>Jin\u2019s softspot for (Y/N) had reached all over the company within the first few days of him working there. He called on the young man than he did for his own secratary. Jin had needed his papers copied but he was running late to a meeting.</p><p>\u201cI could copy them while you head over to the meeting in the company car. I\u2019ll just take a taxi.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, no. You call ahead and inform them I\u2019ll be no more than 15 minutes late and to hold off until I get there. Wait for me by the door.\u201d<br/></p><p>She stood,\u00a0\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He found (Y/N) in the break room touching one of the other workers on the arm as they shared a hearty laugh. The sound make Jin\u2019s heart race, but he didn\u2019t like the contact. He put on his professional face.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), I have a job for you. Focus on working instead of just handing out with slackers in the break room, please.\u201d<br/></p><p>Awkward silence occurred as the intern approached the CEO and asked what he needed. The order was given and Jin stopped midsentence while giving the command.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d<br/></p><p>Jin noticed how the sweaty dress shirt clung to his chest. He tried to pull his eyes away but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI apologize. It\u2019s hot today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He said and came up with a dad joke on the spot to make him smile instead of simply super awkward. After giving the instructions, Jin rushed off to the meeting.<br/></p><hr><p>Even though he had been late, the meeting had gone so well that they even made a deal with it\u2019s sister company. They\u2019d be getting some food imported from both America and Canada. It took months to finalize everything. During those few months, Jin kept getting closer to (Y/N). The two men were often seen going off to lunch together.</p><p>Jin would praise (Y/N) the most whenever he was part of a meeting that went well. One day, he came to Jin\u2019s office for lunch and seemed rather nervous. When asked about it, he said they there was something they needed to talk about over their meal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThe internship was only for 6 months. There is only 1 week until those six months are up. I wanted to make sure you knew.\u201d</p><p>Jin played with a pen,\u00a0\u201cI see. I\u2019m glad you told me.\u201d He leaned back in his chair to seem nonchalant.\u00a0\u201cHow was your time here? Will you be coming back?\u201d</p><p>He was honest,\u00a0\u201cMost likely. I made good relationships here, but we\u2019ll have to see. I have another 6 month internship at Lotte. I have to see which atmosphere works better for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI completely understand.\u201d He replied, pretending that those words didn\u2019t hurt his heart.\u00a0\u201cWe really enjoyed having you here, so I really do hope you return to us. We\u2019ll have to have a party to send you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course we do!\u201d He pressed a button on his phone.\u00a0\u201cNaeun, send out an email that we\u2019ll be having a sendoff party for (Y/N) in 6 days. He\u2019s leaving in a week, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever given him a proper drinking night.\u201d<br/></p><p>Everyone in the company was invited to drink that night at a local pub, and most came. Some had some work they wanted to finish up before drinking while others had families they needed to get back to. Those who were free got beer and liquor and some good food.</p><p>After getting properly drunk, (Y/N)\u2019s words began to slur. Jin decided to cut him off since he wanted the young man to actually show up to work on his last day there.</p><p>\u201cSajang-nim!\u201d He called out.\u00a0\u201cI wanna stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna work for me, then?\u201d<br/></p><p>He shook his head,\u00a0\u201cNo. No. I wanna be by your side forever, but not as an employee. As your boyfriend. You\u2019re really nice to me, and I have gotten feelings for you. It was during the first week that I started liking you. I tried to convince myself it was just&hellip;I was just in awe of you and your work ethic, but I knew it was more. I love you Jin-sajang-nim!\u201d</p><p>The young man then slumped over on Jin\u2019s shoulder, quickly falling asleep after the emotional outburst. At least he wasn\u2019t puking. Jin was about to offer to take him home when the head of their organic department, Kim Taehyung offered to do it instead. The two boys had grown close during his time here.</p><p>Jin helped Taehyung get the very lovely intern into a cab. It was strange hearing the words he had sometimes imagined him saying outloud and in such a unique fashion. The young man was usually so straightforward and completely extroverted in everything he did. Why did it take alcohol for him to say what his heart truly wanted?</p><p>The CEO sighed. At least he said it, but he was leaving. He was going to intern for another company, so Jin just wished he had said it sooner.</p><p>The next day went on as normal with more people saying goodbye to their beloved intern and giving him a few farewell gifts. Jin didn\u2019t want to be the reason why the young man didn\u2019t get a better paying job, so he stayed in his office all day.</p><p>At the end of the day, Jin was packing up his suitcase when he knocked on the open door.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see you before I left for the night and bring you these folders from the accounting department.\u201d<br/></p><p>Jin took the folders and put them in his case,\u00a0\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll try to look at them later tonight.\u201d</p><p>As the two men went into the parking garage, Jin told the young man how great it was working with him. The company would miss him being around. He said that Lotte was a good corporation that would do more for his career than working here would.</p><p>\u201cSajang-nim?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Jin turned to look at the young man he would miss very much and was met with a pair of lips pressing against his.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Jin.\u201d He left to get into his car, not looking back.<br/></p><p>Jin really wished he had said it earlier.</p><hr><p>Another day at the office. Naeun gave him the rundown of how today was going to go. There were no serious meetings, just introducing a new employee who would be working in the publicity section of the company.</p><p>\u201cYou can do that. I\u2019m just gonna get a head start on gathering things for tomorrow\u2019s international meeting.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI mean, you could do that, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll want to meet this one. Here\u2019s his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d She handed him the paper.<br/></p><p>Jin nearly dropped his coffee on the floor. He recognized the name and nearly ran as he left the elevator. The young man was standing in the middle of the room being surrounded by who were now his co-workers as they welcomed him back.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)!\u201d Jin called.<br/></p><p>His eyes beamed as he met Jin\u2019s eyes. The CEO composed himself before making a scene and told him to come to his office. The young man obeyed the orders of his boss. The blinds were not drawn as the windows were just cleaned this morning, so Jin took the time to do so.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to take the time to personally welcome you to the company. I\u2019m curious as to why you decided here instead.\u201d Blind one was completely closed.<br/></p><p>He shyly answered,\u00a0\u201cYou. The people here. Both are great, and I can\u2019t see you every day if I\u2019m working at Lotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you still have feelings for me?\u201d Blind two and three were closed in an instant.<br/></p><p>He nodded,\u00a0\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you for six whole months, Jin.\u201d</p><p>Jin finally faced him,\u00a0\u201cNeither could I.\u201d He moved forward and kissed him.\u00a0\u201cEvery day I thought about that kiss you gave me. Your eyes. Your face. I wanted to do anything to see them again, but I couldn\u2019t stop you from getting a better paying job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s money if I don\u2019t have you?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI love you. Please don\u2019t leave again. Please?\u201d<br/></p><p>He smiled,\u00a0\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He kissed the young man who happened to now be his employee.<br/></p><p>He kissed him and held him and told Naeun to hold all his calls for the day since it was going to be spent with (Y/N).</p>",

We should make our way to the meeting room.\u201d She said from behind her long lashes.<br></p><p>Jin stood up,\u00a0\u201cThank you, Naeun. What room will it be today?\u201d He buttoned up his blazer and checked his hair in the mirror before leaving his office.</p><p>\u201cRoom 5C as you requested, sajang-nim.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He enjoyed the click of he black heels on the tile floors. Her black pants were creased to perfection, and it seemed like she had gotten a new tie to go with her white dress shirt. Son Naeun didn\u2019t wear her blazer which was ok since the air conditioning had been on the fritz today. The repairman wouldn\u2019t come until tomorrow. Sweat was beading down the side of her face, but she didn\u2019t let it bother her.</p><p>A professional. That\u2019s what Naeun was, and Jin would have it no other way. Her black hair was in a loose wavy bun. Pink cheeks. Lips that looked incredibly soft as a small bead of sweat dripped from her nose onto them. Jin offered her his extra handkerchief.</p><p>She took it,\u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Did you already set up all the folders?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, actually, sir\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>Jin held up his hand to silence her,\u00a0\u201cOne moment, please.\u201d</p><p>A young man was in the meeting room, looking through the yellow files and counted the seats. He was incredibly handsome. Still. Jin knew everyone in the company, and he didn\u2019t know this man. There was no way that he\u2019d forget a face like his.</p><p>\u201cYoung man, you\u2019re not supposed to be in here.\u201d<br></p><p>Naeun spoke up,\u00a0\u201cSajang-nim, this is the intern that came in today. He showed up early, so I put him to work setting up the folders for the meeting since introducing him was the first on the agenda anyways. I hope that is alright with you, sir.\u201d</p><p>He nodded,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s fine. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>The intern bowed,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. My name is (Y/L/N) (Y/F/N) and I am eager to be working for your company, sir.\u201d</p><p>(Y/N) had on black pants and a white dress shirt with a black blazer on. He knew today\u2019s dress code which was a good start. Jin gave a small bow in return and looked around the meeting room. There were drinks set up with every folder.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, (Y/N). We\u2019re glad to have you here. Are these drinks from you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I thought it would be better to set it up here than to disturb people while they were working to give it to them.\u201d<br></p><p>Jin nodded,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s good. Very thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>People started to trickle in, and the meeting commenced. (Y/N) introduced himself to his new co-workers, saying that he hoped to be an official member of the company with them one day. They then went over their plans for expanding and how much money it would take, and if it was even worth the cost.</p><p>America was a good contender, but there were already so many other Asian food places there. (Y/N) spoke up and spoke about food deserts. It\u2019d be good for business to set up shop in a place that had no other eateries for miles, basically a captive clientele, but also they didn\u2019t have to go so far just to eat.</p><p>\u201cI like that idea. Mina, I need a list of food deserts and the details on that for the next meeting. Keep the list short, though. Top 50 that would work best for us.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood job, (Y/N).\u201d Jin gave the young man a smile and got one in return that made his heart skip\u00a0 a beat. He cleared his throat and looked at the schedule to hide his blush.\u00a0\u201cThe last thing on the list is budget projections, but we can save that for next time. Meeting adjourned.\u201d<br></p><p>Everyone got up and left the room to return to their work as well as get started on assignments they had gotten during the meeting. Jin made sure to check in with the young man who had stolen all of his attention today. Asked if he wanted to have a late lunch together at a ramyun place down the street.</p><p>He said yes, and went after Jin answered a few questions by the company\u2019s youngest male employee. He had some trouble with his binder and had to leave the meeting, so he had missed a few things. Jin helped with what he could but ended up having Secretary Naeun finish everything lest he keep (Y/N) waiting.</p><p>Jin ordered for the both of them and asked the young man,\u00a0\u201cSo, why did you want to join the company in the first place? I\u2019m sure there are many more popular companies that you\u2019d do just as well in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this is a bit of a tragic backstory, but your restaurant\u2019s food was the last meal my mom ever ate. It was when you had just opened on Jeju. She smiled for the first time since hearing about her diagnosis getting worse, and so I decided to work for the company that put that smile on my mom\u2019s face.\u201d<br></p><p>He was about to cry. Jin\u2019s lower lip quivered,\u00a0\u201cOh my gosh, you\u2019re such a good son! I\u2019m sure your mom would be proud of you! Keep working hard like you have been and you\u2019ll make it in the company, no doubt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking.\u201d<br></p><p>Jin\u2019s mouth fell open and the man began to laugh at the reaction. Their food was ordered in the middle and they thanked the waiter.</p><p>\u201cYou seriously joked about that? I thought you were serious!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m an orphan that got too old, so I was homeless for a bit. A friend is letting me sleep on her couch until I get back on my feet, so I saw an ad and decided why not.\u201d<br></p><p>Jin nodded,\u00a0\u201cWere you really an orphan?\u201d</p><p>He filled his mouth with noodles,\u00a0\u201cYep. Went in when I was 6. Just dropped off in broad daylight with a note pinned to my overalls. Don\u2019t remember my parents much.\u201d He swallowed.\u00a0\u201cSounds better than a dead mom, so I start with that. Don\u2019t want any pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.

He called on the young man than he did for his own secratary. Jin had needed his papers copied but he was running late to a meeting.</p><p>\u201cI could copy them while you head over to the meeting in the company car. I\u2019ll just take a taxi.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, no. You call ahead and inform them I\u2019ll be no more than 15 minutes late and to hold off until I get there. Wait for me by the door.\u201d<br></p><p>She stood,\u00a0\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He found (Y/N) in the break room touching one of the other workers on the arm as they shared a hearty laugh.

Jin didn\u2019t want to be the reason why the young man didn\u2019t get a better paying job, so he stayed in his office all day.</p><p>At the end of the day, Jin was packing up his suitcase when he knocked on the open door.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see you before I left for the night and bring you these folders from the accounting department.\u201d<br></p><p>Jin took the folders and put them in his case,\u00a0\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll try to look at them later tonight.\u201d</p><p>As the two men went into the parking garage, Jin told the young man how great it was working with him. The company would miss him being around. He said that Lotte was a good corporation that would do more for his career than working here would.</p><p>\u201cSajang-nim?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Jin turned to look at the young man he would miss very much and was met with a pair of lips pressing against his.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Jin.\u201d He left to get into his car, not looking back.<br></p><p>Jin really wished he had said it earlier.</p><hr><p>Another day at the office. Naeun gave him the rundown of how today was going to go. There were no serious meetings, just introducing a new employee who would be working in the publicity section of the company.</p><p>\u201cYou can do that. I\u2019m just gonna get a head start on gathering things for tomorrow\u2019s international meeting.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI mean, you could do that, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll want to meet this one. Here\u2019s his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d She handed him the paper.<br></p><p>Jin nearly dropped his coffee on the floor. He recognized the name and nearly ran as he left the elevator. The young man was standing in the middle of the room being surrounded by who were now his co-workers as they welcomed him back.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)!\u201d Jin called.<br></p><p>His eyes beamed as he met Jin\u2019s eyes.

It was a restaurant chain that he started in high school, but he didn\u2019t do any of the cooking himself nowadays. He rarely had time to eat a decent meal since he was the CEO and business was booming. Jin was getting interest from some people overseas to expand his business to other countries. America, China, Australia, Japan, the UK, and even some places in Africa</p><p>He was going to do it, of course. If the profit was worth it. If not, then he\u2019d go somewhere better for the company. The 27 year old had over 100 people in his locations so far. But that wasn\u2019t for him to figure out. Not yet. The numbers and organization went to his office workers. He looked over at his sushi themed <a href=\"https://global.rakuten.com/en/store/giftjapan/item/clsushiw/\">clock</a>, and it was ten minutes to ikura.</p>[[MORE]]<p>His secratary knocked on his door, and he looked at her pretty face.</p><p>\u201cSajang-nim, the meeting is happening soon. We should make our way to the meeting room.\u201d She said from behind her long lashes.<br></p><p>Jin stood up,\u00a0\u201cThank you, Naeun. What room will it be today?\u201d He buttoned up his blazer and checked his hair in the mirror before leaving his office.</p><p>\u201cRoom 5C as you requested, sajang-nim.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He enjoyed the click of he black heels on the tile floors. Her black pants were creased to perfection, and it seemed like she had gotten a new tie to go with her white dress shirt. Son Naeun didn\u2019t wear her blazer which was ok since the air conditioning had been on the fritz today. The repairman wouldn\u2019t come until tomorrow. Sweat was beading down the side of her face, but she didn\u2019t let it bother her.</p><p>A professional. That\u2019s what Naeun was, and Jin would have it no other way. Her black hair was in a loose wavy bun. Pink cheeks. Lips that looked incredibly soft as a small bead of sweat dripped from her nose onto them. Jin offered her his extra handkerchief.</p><p>She took it,\u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Did you already set up all the folders?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, actually, sir\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>Jin held up his hand to silence her,\u00a0\u201cOne moment, please.\u201d</p><p>A young man was in the meeting room, looking through the yellow files and counted the seats. He was incredibly handsome. Still. Jin knew everyone in the company, and he didn\u2019t know this man. There was no way that he\u2019d forget a face like his.</p><p>\u201cYoung man, you\u2019re not supposed to be in here.\u201d<br></p><p>Naeun spoke up,\u00a0\u201cSajang-nim, this is the intern that came in today. He showed up early, so I put him to work setting up the folders for the meeting since introducing him was the first on the agenda anyways. I hope that is alright with you, sir.\u201d</p><p>He nodded,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s fine. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>The intern bowed,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. My name is (Y/L/N) (Y/F/N) and I am eager to be working for your company, sir.\u201d</p><p>(Y/N) had on black pants and a white dress shirt with a black blazer on. He knew today\u2019s dress code which was a good start. Jin gave a small bow in return and looked around the meeting room. There were drinks set up with every folder.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, (Y/N). We\u2019re glad to have you here. Are these drinks from you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I thought it would be better to set it up here than to disturb people while they were working to give it to them.\u201d<br></p><p>Jin nodded,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s good. Very thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>People started to trickle in, and the meeting commenced. (Y/N) introduced himself to his new co-workers, saying that he hoped to be an official member of the company with them one day. They then went over their plans for expanding and how much money it would take, and if it was even worth the cost.</p><p>America was a good contender, but there were already so many other Asian food places there. (Y/N) spoke up and spoke about food deserts. It\u2019d be good for business to set up shop in a place that had no other eateries for miles, basically a captive clientele, but also they didn\u2019t have to go so far just to eat.</p><p>\u201cI like that idea. Mina, I need a list of food deserts and the details on that for the next meeting. Keep the list short, though. Top 50 that would work best for us.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood job, (Y/N).\u201d Jin gave the young man a smile and got one in return that made his heart skip\u00a0 a beat. He cleared his throat and looked at the schedule to hide his blush.\u00a0\u201cThe last thing on the list is budget projections, but we can save that for next time. Meeting adjourned.\u201d<br></p><p>Everyone got up and left the room to return to their work as well as get started on assignments they had gotten during the meeting. Jin made sure to check in with the young man who had stolen all of his attention today. Asked if he wanted to have a late lunch together at a ramyun place down the street.</p><p>He said yes, and went after Jin answered a few questions by the company\u2019s youngest male employee. He had some trouble with his binder and had to leave the meeting, so he had missed a few things. Jin helped with what he could but ended up having Secretary Naeun finish everything lest he keep (Y/N) waiting.</p><p>Jin ordered for the both of them and asked the young man,\u00a0\u201cSo, why did you want to join the company in the first place? I\u2019m sure there are many more popular companies that you\u2019d do just as well in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this is a bit of a tragic backstory, but your restaurant\u2019s food was the last meal my mom ever ate. It was when you had just opened on Jeju. She smiled for the first time since hearing about her diagnosis getting worse, and so I decided to work for the company that put that smile on my mom\u2019s face.\u201d<br></p><p>He was about to cry. Jin\u2019s lower lip quivered,\u00a0\u201cOh my gosh, you\u2019re such a good son! I\u2019m sure your mom would be proud of you! Keep working hard like you have been and you\u2019ll make it in the company, no doubt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking.\u201d<br></p><p>Jin\u2019s mouth fell open and the man began to laugh at the reaction. Their food was ordered in the middle and they thanked the waiter.</p><p>\u201cYou seriously joked about that? I thought you were serious!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m an orphan that got too old, so I was homeless for a bit. A friend is letting me sleep on her couch until I get back on my feet, so I saw an ad and decided why not.\u201d<br></p><p>Jin nodded,\u00a0\u201cWere you really an orphan?\u201d</p><p>He filled his mouth with noodles,\u00a0\u201cYep. Went in when I was 6. Just dropped off in broad daylight with a note pinned to my overalls. Don\u2019t remember my parents much.\u201d He swallowed.\u00a0\u201cSounds better than a dead mom, so I start with that. Don\u2019t want any pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. Anyways, what are you hoping for as you become part of our company, (Y/N)?\u201d<br></p><p>He just wanted to be able to support himself and whatever future family he would have. That was good enough for Jin, so they finished off their lunch and headed back to the office. This was the first decent meal the CEO had eaten in a while, so he thanked the intern before getting back to his work.</p><hr><p>Jin\u2019s softspot for (Y/N) had reached all over the company within the first few days of him working there. He called on the young man than he did for his own secratary. Jin had needed his papers copied but he was running late to a meeting.</p><p>\u201cI could copy them while you head over to the meeting in the company car. I\u2019ll just take a taxi.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, no. You call ahead and inform them I\u2019ll be no more than 15 minutes late and to hold off until I get there. Wait for me by the door.\u201d<br></p><p>She stood,\u00a0\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He found (Y/N) in the break room touching one of the other workers on the arm as they shared a hearty laugh. The sound make Jin\u2019s heart race, but he didn\u2019t like the contact. He put on his professional face.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), I have a job for you. Focus on working instead of just handing out with slackers in the break room, please.\u201d<br></p><p>Awkward silence occurred as the intern approached the CEO and asked what he needed. The order was given and Jin stopped midsentence while giving the command.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d<br></p><p>Jin noticed how the sweaty dress shirt clung to his chest. He tried to pull his eyes away but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI apologize. It\u2019s hot today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He said and came up with a dad joke on the spot to make him smile instead of simply super awkward. After giving the instructions, Jin rushed off to the meeting.<br></p><hr><p>Even though he had been late, the meeting had gone so well that they even made a deal with it\u2019s sister company. They\u2019d be getting some food imported from both America and Canada. It took months to finalize everything. During those few months, Jin kept getting closer to (Y/N). The two men were often seen going off to lunch together.</p><p>Jin would praise (Y/N) the most whenever he was part of a meeting that went well. One day, he came to Jin\u2019s office for lunch and seemed rather nervous. When asked about it, he said they there was something they needed to talk about over their meal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe internship was only for 6 months. There is only 1 week until those six months are up. I wanted to make sure you knew.\u201d</p><p>Jin played with a pen,\u00a0\u201cI see. I\u2019m glad you told me.\u201d He leaned back in his chair to seem nonchalant.\u00a0\u201cHow was your time here? Will you be coming back?\u201d</p><p>He was honest,\u00a0\u201cMost likely. I made good relationships here, but we\u2019ll have to see. I have another 6 month internship at Lotte. I have to see which atmosphere works better for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI completely understand.\u201d He replied, pretending that those words didn\u2019t hurt his heart.\u00a0\u201cWe really enjoyed having you here, so I really do hope you return to us. We\u2019ll have to have a party to send you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOf course we do!\u201d He pressed a button on his phone.\u00a0\u201cNaeun, send out an email that we\u2019ll be having a sendoff party for (Y/N) in 6 days. He\u2019s leaving in a week, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever given him a proper drinking night.\u201d<br></p><p>Everyone in the company was invited to drink that night at a local pub, and most came. Some had some work they wanted to finish up before drinking while others had families they needed to get back to. Those who were free got beer and liquor and some good food.</p><p>After getting properly drunk, (Y/N)\u2019s words began to slur. Jin decided to cut him off since he wanted the young man to actually show up to work on his last day there.</p><p>\u201cSajang-nim!\u201d He called out.\u00a0\u201cI wanna stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna work for me, then?\u201d<br></p><p>He shook his head,\u00a0\u201cNo. No. I wanna be by your side forever, but not as an employee. As your boyfriend. You\u2019re really nice to me, and I have gotten feelings for you. It was during the first week that I started liking you. I tried to convince myself it was just\u2026I was just in awe of you and your work ethic, but I knew it was more. I love you Jin-sajang-nim!\u201d</p><p>The young man then slumped over on Jin\u2019s shoulder, quickly falling asleep after the emotional outburst. At least he wasn\u2019t puking. Jin was about to offer to take him home when the head of their organic department, Kim Taehyung offered to do it instead. The two boys had grown close during his time here.</p><p>Jin helped Taehyung get the very lovely intern into a cab. It was strange hearing the words he had sometimes imagined him saying outloud and in such a unique fashion. The young man was usually so straightforward and completely extroverted in everything he did. Why did it take alcohol for him to say what his heart truly wanted?</p><p>The CEO sighed. At least he said it, but he was leaving. He was going to intern for another company, so Jin just wished he had said it sooner.</p><p>The next day went on as normal with more people saying goodbye to their beloved intern and giving him a few farewell gifts. Jin didn\u2019t want to be the reason why the young man didn\u2019t get a better paying job, so he stayed in his office all day.</p><p>At the end of the day, Jin was packing up his suitcase when he knocked on the open door.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see you before I left for the night and bring you these folders from the accounting department.\u201d<br></p><p>Jin took the folders and put them in his case,\u00a0\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll try to look at them later tonight.\u201d</p><p>As the two men went into the parking garage, Jin told the young man how great it was working with him. The company would miss him being around. He said that Lotte was a good corporation that would do more for his career than working here would.</p><p>\u201cSajang-nim?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Jin turned to look at the young man he would miss very much and was met with a pair of lips pressing against his.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Jin.\u201d He left to get into his car, not looking back.<br></p><p>Jin really wished he had said it earlier.</p><hr><p>Another day at the office. Naeun gave him the rundown of how today was going to go. There were no serious meetings, just introducing a new employee who would be working in the publicity section of the company.</p><p>\u201cYou can do that. I\u2019m just gonna get a head start on gathering things for tomorrow\u2019s international meeting.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI mean, you could do that, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll want to meet this one. Here\u2019s his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d She handed him the paper.<br></p><p>Jin nearly dropped his coffee on the floor. He recognized the name and nearly ran as he left the elevator. The young man was standing in the middle of the room being surrounded by who were now his co-workers as they welcomed him back.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)!\u201d Jin called.<br></p><p>His eyes beamed as he met Jin\u2019s eyes. The CEO composed himself before making a scene and told him to come to his office. The young man obeyed the orders of his boss. The blinds were not drawn as the windows were just cleaned this morning, so Jin took the time to do so.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to take the time to personally welcome you to the company. I\u2019m curious as to why you decided here instead.\u201d Blind one was completely closed.<br></p><p>He shyly answered,\u00a0\u201cYou. The people here. Both are great, and I can\u2019t see you every day if I\u2019m working at Lotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you still have feelings for me?\u201d Blind two and three were closed in an instant.<br></p><p>He nodded,\u00a0\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you for six whole months, Jin.\u201d</p><p>Jin finally faced him,\u00a0\u201cNeither could I.\u201d He moved forward and kissed him.\u00a0\u201cEvery day I thought about that kiss you gave me.

He looked over at his sushi themed <a href=\"https://global.rakuten.com/en/store/giftjapan/item/clsushiw/\">clock</a>, and it was ten minutes to ikura.</p><p>His secratary knocked on his door, and he looked at her pretty face.</p><p>&ldquo;Sajang-nim, the meeting is happening soon. We should make our way to the meeting room.&rdquo; She said from behind her long lashes.<br /></p><p>Jin stood up,&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you, Naeun. What room will it be today?&rdquo; He buttoned up his blazer and checked his hair in the mirror before leaving his office.</p><p>&ldquo;Room 5C as you requested, sajang-nim.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>He enjoyed the click of he black heels on the tile floors. Her black pants were creased to perfection, and it seemed like she had gotten a new tie to go with her white dress shirt. Son Naeun didn&rsquo;t wear her blazer which was ok since the air conditioning had been on the fritz today. The repairman wouldn&rsquo;t come until tomorrow. Sweat was beading down the side of her face, but she didn&rsquo;t let it bother her.</p><p>A professional. That&rsquo;s what Naeun was, and Jin would have it no other way. Her black hair was in a loose wavy bun. Pink cheeks. Lips that looked incredibly soft as a small bead of sweat dripped from her nose onto them. Jin offered her his extra handkerchief.</p><p>She took it,&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome. Did you already set up all the folders?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, actually, sir&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jin held up his hand to silence her,&nbsp;&ldquo;One moment, please.&rdquo;</p><p>A young man was in the meeting room, looking through the yellow files and counted the seats. He was incredibly handsome. Still. Jin knew everyone in the company, and he didn&rsquo;t know this man. There was no way that he&rsquo;d forget a face like his.</p><p>&ldquo;Young man, you&rsquo;re not supposed to be in here.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Naeun spoke up,&nbsp;&ldquo;Sajang-nim, this is the intern that came in today. He showed up early, so I put him to work setting up the folders for the meeting since introducing him was the first on the agenda anyways. I hope that is alright with you, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded,&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p><p>The intern bowed,&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you. My name is (Y/L/N) (Y/F/N) and I am eager to be working for your company, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>(Y/N) had on black pants and a white dress shirt with a black blazer on. He knew today&rsquo;s dress code which was a good start. Jin gave a small bow in return and looked around the meeting room. There were drinks set up with every folder.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you, (Y/N). We&rsquo;re glad to have you here. Are these drinks from you?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I thought it would be better to set it up here than to disturb people while they were working to give it to them.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jin nodded,&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Very thoughtful of you.&rdquo;</p><p>People started to trickle in, and the meeting commenced. (Y/N) introduced himself to his new co-workers, saying that he hoped to be an official member of the company with them one day. They then went over their plans for expanding and how much money it would take, and if it was even worth the cost.</p><p>America was a good contender, but there were already so many other Asian food places there. (Y/N) spoke up and spoke about food deserts. It&rsquo;d be good for business to set up shop in a place that had no other eateries for miles, basically a captive clientele, but also they didn&rsquo;t have to go so far just to eat.</p><p>&ldquo;I like that idea. Mina, I need a list of food deserts and the details on that for the next meeting. Keep the list short, though. Top 50 that would work best for us.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good job, (Y/N).&rdquo; Jin gave the young man a smile and got one in return that made his heart skip&nbsp; a beat. He cleared his throat and looked at the schedule to hide his blush.&nbsp;&ldquo;The last thing on the list is budget projections, but we can save that for next time. Meeting adjourned.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Everyone got up and left the room to return to their work as well as get started on assignments they had gotten during the meeting. Jin made sure to check in with the young man who had stolen all of his attention today. Asked if he wanted to have a late lunch together at a ramyun place down the street.</p><p>He said yes, and went after Jin answered a few questions by the company&rsquo;s youngest male employee. He had some trouble with his binder and had to leave the meeting, so he had missed a few things. Jin helped with what he could but ended up having Secretary Naeun finish everything lest he keep (Y/N) waiting.</p><p>Jin ordered for the both of them and asked the young man,&nbsp;&ldquo;So, why did you want to join the company in the first place? I&rsquo;m sure there are many more popular companies that you&rsquo;d do just as well in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know this is a bit of a tragic backstory, but your restaurant&rsquo;s food was the last meal my mom ever ate. It was when you had just opened on Jeju. She smiled for the first time since hearing about her diagnosis getting worse, and so I decided to work for the company that put that smile on my mom&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He was about to cry. Jin&rsquo;s lower lip quivered,&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my gosh, you&rsquo;re such a good son! I&rsquo;m sure your mom would be proud of you! Keep working hard like you have been and you&rsquo;ll make it in the company, no doubt!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m joking.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jin&rsquo;s mouth fell open and the man began to laugh at the reaction. Their food was ordered in the middle and they thanked the waiter.</p><p>&ldquo;You seriously joked about that? I thought you were serious!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m an orphan that got too old, so I was homeless for a bit. A friend is letting me sleep on her couch until I get back on my feet, so I saw an ad and decided why not.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jin nodded,&nbsp;&ldquo;Were you really an orphan?&rdquo;</p><p>He filled his mouth with noodles,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep. Went in when I was 6. Just dropped off in broad daylight with a note pinned to my overalls. Don&rsquo;t remember my parents much.&rdquo; He swallowed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sounds better than a dead mom, so I start with that. Don&rsquo;t want any pity.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess. Anyways, what are you hoping for as you become part of our company, (Y/N)?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He just wanted to be able to support himself and whatever future family he would have. That was good enough for Jin, so they finished off their lunch and headed back to the office. This was the first decent meal the CEO had eaten in a while, so he thanked the intern before getting back to his work.</p><hr /><p>Jin&rsquo;s softspot for (Y/N) had reached all over the company within the first few days of him working there. He called on the young man than he did for his own secratary. Jin had needed his papers copied but he was running late to a meeting.</p><p>&ldquo;I could copy them while you head over to the meeting in the company car. I&rsquo;ll just take a taxi.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, no. You call ahead and inform them I&rsquo;ll be no more than 15 minutes late and to hold off until I get there. Wait for me by the door.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She stood,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>He found (Y/N) in the break room touching one of the other workers on the arm as they shared a hearty laugh. The sound make Jin&rsquo;s heart race, but he didn&rsquo;t like the contact. He put on his professional face.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N), I have a job for you. Focus on working instead of just handing out with slackers in the break room, please.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Awkward silence occurred as the intern approached the CEO and asked what he needed. The order was given and Jin stopped midsentence while giving the command.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jin noticed how the sweaty dress shirt clung to his chest. He tried to pull his eyes away but couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;I apologize. It&rsquo;s hot today, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He said and came up with a dad joke on the spot to make him smile instead of simply super awkward. After giving the instructions, Jin rushed off to the meeting.<br /></p><hr /><p>Even though he had been late, the meeting had gone so well that they even made a deal with it&rsquo;s sister company. They&rsquo;d be getting some food imported from both America and Canada. It took months to finalize everything. During those few months, Jin kept getting closer to (Y/N). The two men were often seen going off to lunch together.</p><p>Jin would praise (Y/N) the most whenever he was part of a meeting that went well. One day, he came to Jin&rsquo;s office for lunch and seemed rather nervous. When asked about it, he said they there was something they needed to talk about over their meal.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The internship was only for 6 months. There is only 1 week until those six months are up. I wanted to make sure you knew.&rdquo;</p><p>Jin played with a pen,&nbsp;&ldquo;I see. I&rsquo;m glad you told me.&rdquo; He leaned back in his chair to seem nonchalant.&nbsp;&ldquo;How was your time here? Will you be coming back?&rdquo;</p><p>He was honest,&nbsp;&ldquo;Most likely. I made good relationships here, but we&rsquo;ll have to see. I have another 6 month internship at Lotte. I have to see which atmosphere works better for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I completely understand.&rdquo; He replied, pretending that those words didn&rsquo;t hurt his heart.&nbsp;&ldquo;We really enjoyed having you here, so I really do hope you return to us. We&rsquo;ll have to have a party to send you off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, you don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course we do!&rdquo; He pressed a button on his phone.&nbsp;&ldquo;Naeun, send out an email that we&rsquo;ll be having a sendoff party for (Y/N) in 6 days. He&rsquo;s leaving in a week, and I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve ever given him a proper drinking night.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Everyone in the company was invited to drink that night at a local pub, and most came. Some had some work they wanted to finish up before drinking while others had families they needed to get back to. Those who were free got beer and liquor and some good food.</p><p>After getting properly drunk, (Y/N)&rsquo;s words began to slur. Jin decided to cut him off since he wanted the young man to actually show up to work on his last day there.</p><p>&ldquo;Sajang-nim!&rdquo; He called out.&nbsp;&ldquo;I wanna stay with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You wanna work for me, then?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He shook his head,&nbsp;&ldquo;No. No. I wanna be by your side forever, but not as an employee. As your boyfriend. You&rsquo;re really nice to me, and I have gotten feelings for you. It was during the first week that I started liking you. I tried to convince myself it was just&hellip;I was just in awe of you and your work ethic, but I knew it was more. I love you Jin-sajang-nim!&rdquo;</p><p>The young man then slumped over on Jin&rsquo;s shoulder, quickly falling asleep after the emotional outburst. At least he wasn&rsquo;t puking. Jin was about to offer to take him home when the head of their organic department, Kim Taehyung offered to do it instead. The two boys had grown close during his time here.</p><p>Jin helped Taehyung get the very lovely intern into a cab. It was strange hearing the words he had sometimes imagined him saying outloud and in such a unique fashion. The young man was usually so straightforward and completely extroverted in everything he did. Why did it take alcohol for him to say what his heart truly wanted?</p><p>The CEO sighed. At least he said it, but he was leaving. He was going to intern for another company, so Jin just wished he had said it sooner.</p><p>The next day went on as normal with more people saying goodbye to their beloved intern and giving him a few farewell gifts. Jin didn&rsquo;t want to be the reason why the young man didn&rsquo;t get a better paying job, so he stayed in his office all day.</p><p>At the end of the day, Jin was packing up his suitcase when he knocked on the open door.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to see you before I left for the night and bring you these folders from the accounting department.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jin took the folders and put them in his case,&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you. I&rsquo;ll try to look at them later tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>As the two men went into the parking garage, Jin told the young man how great it was working with him. The company would miss him being around. He said that Lotte was a good corporation that would do more for his career than working here would.</p><p>&ldquo;Sajang-nim?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Jin turned to look at the young man he would miss very much and was met with a pair of lips pressing against his.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Jin.&rdquo; He left to get into his car, not looking back.<br /></p><p>Jin really wished he had said it earlier.</p><hr /><p>Another day at the office. Naeun gave him the rundown of how today was going to go. There were no serious meetings, just introducing a new employee who would be working in the publicity section of the company.</p><p>&ldquo;You can do that. I&rsquo;m just gonna get a head start on gathering things for tomorrow&rsquo;s international meeting.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I mean, you could do that, but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll want to meet this one. Here&rsquo;s his r&eacute;sum&eacute;.&rdquo; She handed him the paper.<br /></p><p>Jin nearly dropped his coffee on the floor. He recognized the name and nearly ran as he left the elevator. The young man was standing in the middle of the room being surrounded by who were now his co-workers as they welcomed him back.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)!&rdquo; Jin called.<br /></p><p>His eyes beamed as he met Jin&rsquo;s eyes. The CEO composed himself before making a scene and told him to come to his office. The young man obeyed the orders of his boss. The blinds were not drawn as the windows were just cleaned this morning, so Jin took the time to do so.</p><p>&ldquo;I just wanted to take the time to personally welcome you to the company. I&rsquo;m curious as to why you decided here instead.&rdquo; Blind one was completely closed.<br /></p><p>He shyly answered,&nbsp;&ldquo;You. The people here. Both are great, and I can&rsquo;t see you every day if I&rsquo;m working at Lotte.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you still have feelings for me?&rdquo; Blind two and three were closed in an instant.<br /></p><p>He nodded,&nbsp;&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about you for six whole months, Jin.&rdquo;</p><p>Jin finally faced him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Neither could I.&rdquo; He moved forward and kissed him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Every day I thought about that kiss you gave me. Your eyes. Your face. I wanted to do anything to see them again, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop you from getting a better paying job.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s money if I don&rsquo;t have you?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I love you. Please don&rsquo;t leave again. Please?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He smiled,&nbsp;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He kissed the young man who happened to now be his employee.<br /></p><p>He kissed him and held him and told Naeun to hold all his calls for the day since it was going to be spent with (Y/N).</p>",
