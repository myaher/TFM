        "body": "<img src=\"http://ifttt.com/images/no_image_card.png\"/><br/><div class=\"md\"><p>To me, Corlys Velaryon&rsquo;s trips to Essos and the Further east is a very interesting topic, exploring many mystical places, and encountering many different races, he explored both the Jade Sea and the Shivering Sea, he brought many fortunes back home and was for a time the wealthiest man in Westeros, with his wealth he built his house a new seat; High Tide, which is located in the small island Driftmark near the Crownlands, he also played a big part in one of the most important events in Asoiaf, The Dance of Dragons, which lasted over 3 years.</p> <p>Since there is close to no information about his travels, the only thing we do know for certain are the places he visited and the number of voyages in total; 9. And that&rsquo;s about it, so the only thing we could do is make speculations and assumptions about his voyages through his ship Sea Snake, which was later his nickname or alias, there was also a book written about him and his 9 voyages by Maester Mathis, unfortunately there is no information about the book too.</p> <p>His first voyage would probably be to the north, where he sailed beyond the wall, into the Lands of Forever Winter, he tried to sail around to the other side, but was unsuccessful because of the frozen water of which would probably be the north pole of the world of Asoiaf, there is a small chance that he would&rsquo;ve brought fishers and fishing equipment, since the Shivering sea is filled with expensive exotic sea creatures, such as wolf fish, sand lances, grey skates, whitefish, shark, herring, mackerel, seals, narwhals, walruses, sea lions, grey whales, white whales, humpbacks, spotted whales, and leviathans. Since sea travel is expensive, he would either already have enough gold to leave for his other voyages (either from his savings, or a loan from a major house or even the iron bank), or he would&rsquo;ve gotten the wealth on this voyage(shipping, treasure, loot, etc), like I said, these are all assumptions, for all we know, GRRM may even write the history of Corlys Velaryon and all of what I wrote would be wrong, but that&rsquo;s also just an assumption since he&rsquo;s already 70 years old and there&rsquo;s way more unwritten history and lore that is missing or vague, and the chances of him confirming anything on Corlys are close to none.</p> <p><strong>Corlys Velaryon&rsquo;s voyages to the North of Essos.</strong></p> <p>So we know that he went on 9 voyages in total (not including his voyage beyond the wall). From my opinion, I think that Corlys wanted to sail to all the corners of the known world, starting with the north, then to the upper east (The Shivering Sea). We also know that he was the first person to visit Nefer and N'Ghai, and even navigate through The Thousand Islands (which are all located on the far east of northern Essos). Since we also know that his daughter was betrothed to a Sealord of Braavos, this may indicate that he sailed to the north again, this time east, and to Braavos, and who knows how many placed he stopped by on his voyages, since we also know that when he reached The Thousand Islands, he stopped his voyage and went back home, he may have stopped to restock on many places; including Braavos, Lorath, The Axe, Saath, Morosh, Bay of Tusks, Ib, Far Ib, New Ibbish and even Vaes Aresak, which are all port cities that all have their different histories and cultures, Ib for example, is a small set of islands larger than the Iron Islands in Westeros, that are particularity very interesting. Their inhabitants, are a Dwarf like race that look very similar to the ones in the Lord of The Rings, they are very much shorter than all the other races, and are very much into mining and the creation of weapons and armor made of iron or other metals, the only difference is that they are great fishers and not that much into the creation and building of stone structures. They have tried to create settlements outside of their homeland Ib, but all efforts into inhabiting the main land were stopped by the savage Dothraki who slayed them all, the only small settlement remaining is New Ibbish.</p> <p>The Thousand Islands are ever far more interesting, with their inhabitants being the most shrouded and most mysterious of all the races (in my opinion), despite their name, sailors have only counted lesser than three hundred islands. The inhabitants are reportedly xenophobes, hairless green skinned beings who speak an unknown language and are also said to sacrifice any sailors they find to their evil fish-gods, it is also said that their gods can be visible underwater in a low tide, and many sailors say that The Thousand Islands are the remainder of an ancient sunken civilization that has been submerged underwater from the rising sea level, it is even said that the inhabitant are so scared of the water that they will never enter it even when threatened by death. Since you have to pass through The Thousand Islands to reach Nefer and N'Ghai, we can say that his voyage to The Thousand Islands counts as one.</p> <p>It is said the the more east you go, the more mysterious it becomes, with lesser and lesser people travelling this far and going back to Westeros and document their voyages and adventures, all information becomes limited to gossip and legends. The city of Nefer is the last remaining city of the kingdom of N'Ghai, it is said to be a place shrouded in fog and mystery, and surrounded by tall chalk cliffs, it is a seen as a small town, and is reputed to be a place for necromancers and torturers, what is really weird about this certain place, is that it is said that nine-tenths of Nefer is hidden underground, which is how the city got its nickname The Hidden City, who knows maybe Corlys even explored the underground part?</p> <p>So far we are certain that he went on at least 2 voyages, since we know that he went back the first time he reached The Thousand Islands, and it is also said he was the first Westerosi who explored Nefer and N'Ghai which he cannot reach by ship without passing by The Thousand Islands, now that I&rsquo;ve covered the north, its time for the even more interesting place; the south.</p> <p><strong>Corlys Velaryon&rsquo;s voyages to the South of Essos.</strong></p> <p>To the south of Essos lays The Jade Sea, which is reputedly known for high risk and high reward reputation, the more east you go by ship for trade, the more gold you get, many sailors sail to Qarth to trade spices and sell them to rich houses in Westeros and many even go as far as Asshai to trade goods for gold and riches, one of the things we know for certain is that Corlys sailed to the Jade Sea, and got so rich he filled his ship Sea Snake with gold, and went back to Westeros to later build a whole castle for his house on Driftmark. We can also assume that his voyages to the east were after the ones in The Shivering Sea, since he reached almost to the end of the world in the north, and it is also written that on his last voyage he passed by Qarth to buy ships.</p> <p>The Golden Empire of Yi Ti was once probably the only civilization to ever succeed Valyria, it a vast land that has thick, green patchwork farmland and a verdant rain forest. The God-Emperor, was once the most powerful man in the world of Asoiaf, ruling over the lands of Yi Ti, which are as large as the whole northern part of Westeros, but now with more and more chaos and independence between houses and princes, and the nonstrategic place of the city of Yin(southern most point of Yi Ti), his reign has become limited to the walls of his city, Yin. Lomas Longstrider, a famous Westerosi explorer who is also known for his adventures to Essos and The Further East, called Yi Ti &ldquo;the land of a thousand gods and a hundred princes, ruled by one god-emperor&rdquo;, The locals of Yi Ti are of similar characteristics and looks of the people living in south-east Asia in the real world. Yi Ti is said by maesters to be the oldest living civilization in the world, dating back before the the rise of the Valyrian Freehold, The Ghiscari Empire, and even before The First Men crossed The Arm of Dorne into Westeros.</p> <p>Leng, a large island as big as The Vale of Arryn near Yi Ti is home to a rather queer race, the Lengii are a slender race and are the tallest race of mankind, it is said that they reach seven or even eight feet in height, they are said to be the most beautiful of all the races, with large golden colored eyes and the skin color of oiled teak. It is said that mystical beings know as The Old Ones, live under the island&rsquo;s surface, and long ago instructed the empress of the island to slay all foreigners who set foot in the island multiple times, until Jar Har, the sixth sea-green emperor of Yi Ti, conquered Leng, and closed all entrances to the underground cities and ordered the Lengii to forget them. Now, the Lengii have been driven back to the southern third of the island, since YiTish locals migrated into the northern 2 thirds after Jar Har&rsquo;s arrival in Leng.</p> <p>It is written that almost all the wealth brought back by Corlys was from Yi Ti and Leng, but the Jade sea is a very vast place, with many islands filled with pirates, warlords, and slave traders. For all we know Corlys could have maybe landed in a lot of places on his way to Yi Ti, Qarth and Leng, including Tyrosh, The Stepstones, Lys, The Summer Isles, Naath, Basilisk Isles, Volantis, Slaver&rsquo;s Bay, Ghaen, Port Yhos, Great and Lesser Moraq, Isle of Whips, Isle of Elephants, Marahai and Manticore Isles.</p> <p>Imagine a spin-off TV show based on his adventures, seeing all those magnificent places, and characters, meeting different races, with more fictional things taking place (magic, other races, etc) the show will be amazing, going on voyages with his crew, meeting all sorts of people with different cultures, and ethnics, and even seeing mystical creatures, battling with sorcerers, necromancers, and shapeshifters, and maybe even seeing the fish gods or the old ones and exploring their tombs and temples, making a TV show based on a story this diverse and unique may be costly, from all the CGI of creatures and make up for other races, but from what I think, we have never seen a TV show with such a big budget and similarity with movies than Game Of Thrones. I guess we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see, since we are expecting the eighth season next year, and 5 spin-off series, who knows maybe one of those five spin-offs is about Corlys and his voyages?</p> <p>-Ahmed</p> <p>Links:</p> <p>Asoiaf world map: <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/ap8fmgf1fzcz.jpg\">https://i.redd.it/ap8fmgf1fzcz.jpg</a></p> <p>Corlys Velaryon: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Corlys_Velaryon\">https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Corlys_Velaryon</a></p> <p>Driftmark: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Driftmark\">https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Driftmark</a> </p> <p>Yi Ti: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Yi_Ti\">https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Yi_Ti</a></p> <p>Leng: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Leng\">https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Leng</a></p> <p>Thousand Islands: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Thousand_Islands\">https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Thousand_Islands</a></p> </div><br/><br/>\nSource: <a href=\"https://ift.tt/2zcVLMn\">https://ift.tt/2zcVLMn</a>",

Since sea travel is expensive, he would either already have enough gold to leave for his other voyages (either from his savings, or a loan from a major house or even the iron bank), or he would\u2019ve gotten the wealth on this voyage(shipping, treasure, loot, etc), like I said, these are all assumptions, for all we know, GRRM may even write the history of Corlys Velaryon and all of what I wrote would be wrong, but that\u2019s also just an assumption since he\u2019s already 70 years old and there\u2019s way more unwritten history and lore that is missing or vague, and the chances of him confirming anything on Corlys are close to none.</p> <p><strong>Corlys Velaryon\u2019s voyages to the North of Essos.</strong></p> <p>So we know that he went on 9 voyages in total (not including his voyage beyond the wall). From my opinion, I think that Corlys wanted to sail to all the corners of the known world, starting with the north, then to the upper east (The Shivering Sea). We also know that he was the first person to visit Nefer and N'Ghai, and even navigate through The Thousand Islands (which are all located on the far east of northern Essos). Since we also know that his daughter was betrothed to a Sealord of Braavos, this may indicate that he sailed to the north again, this time east, and to Braavos, and who knows how many placed he stopped by on his voyages, since we also know that when he reached The Thousand Islands, he stopped his voyage and went back home, he may have stopped to restock on many places; including Braavos, Lorath, The Axe, Saath, Morosh, Bay of Tusks, Ib, Far Ib, New Ibbish and even Vaes Aresak, which are all port cities that all have their different histories and cultures, Ib for example, is a small set of islands larger than the Iron Islands in Westeros, that are particularity very interesting. Their inhabitants, are a Dwarf like race that look very similar to the ones in the Lord of The Rings, they are very much shorter than all the other races, and are very much into mining and the creation of weapons and armor made of iron or other metals, the only difference is that they are great fishers and not that much into the creation and building of stone structures. They have tried to create settlements outside of their homeland Ib, but all efforts into inhabiting the main land were stopped by the savage Dothraki who slayed them all, the only small settlement remaining is New Ibbish.</p> <p>The Thousand Islands are ever far more interesting, with their inhabitants being the most shrouded and most mysterious of all the races (in my opinion), despite their name, sailors have only counted lesser than three hundred islands. The inhabitants are reportedly xenophobes, hairless green skinned beings who speak an unknown language and are also said to sacrifice any sailors they find to their evil fish-gods, it is also said that their gods can be visible underwater in a low tide, and many sailors say that The Thousand Islands are the remainder of an ancient sunken civilization that has been submerged underwater from the rising sea level, it is even said that the inhabitant are so scared of the water that they will never enter it even when threatened by death. Since you have to pass through The Thousand Islands to reach Nefer and N'Ghai, we can say that his voyage to The Thousand Islands counts as one.</p> <p>It is said the the more east you go, the more mysterious it becomes, with lesser and lesser people travelling this far and going back to Westeros and document their voyages and adventures, all information becomes limited to gossip and legends. The city of Nefer is the last remaining city of the kingdom of N'Ghai, it is said to be a place shrouded in fog and mystery, and surrounded by tall chalk cliffs, it is a seen as a small town, and is reputed to be a place for necromancers and torturers, what is really weird about this certain place, is that it is said that nine-tenths of Nefer is hidden underground, which is how the city got its nickname The Hidden City, who knows maybe Corlys even explored the underground part?</p> <p>So far we are certain that he went on at least 2 voyages, since we know that he went back the first time he reached The Thousand Islands, and it is also said he was the first Westerosi who explored Nefer and N'Ghai which he cannot reach by ship without passing by The Thousand Islands, now that I\u2019ve covered the north, its time for the even more interesting place; the south.</p> <p><strong>Corlys Velaryon\u2019s voyages to the South of Essos.</strong></p> <p>To the south of Essos lays The Jade Sea, which is reputedly known for high risk and high reward reputation, the more east you go by ship for trade, the more gold you get, many sailors sail to Qarth to trade spices and sell them to rich houses in Westeros and many even go as far as Asshai to trade goods for gold and riches, one of the things we know for certain is that Corlys sailed to the Jade Sea, and got so rich he filled his ship Sea Snake with gold, and went back to Westeros to later build a whole castle for his house on Driftmark. We can also assume that his voyages to the east were after the ones in The Shivering Sea, since he reached almost to the end of the world in the north, and it is also written that on his last voyage he passed by Qarth to buy ships.</p> <p>The Golden Empire of Yi Ti was once probably the only civilization to ever succeed Valyria, it a vast land that has thick, green patchwork farmland and a verdant rain forest. The God-Emperor, was once the most powerful man in the world of Asoiaf, ruling over the lands of Yi Ti, which are as large as the whole northern part of Westeros, but now with more and more chaos and independence between houses and princes, and the nonstrategic place of the city of Yin(southern most point of Yi Ti), his reign has become limited to the walls of his city, Yin. Lomas Longstrider, a famous Westerosi explorer who is also known for his adventures to Essos and The Further East, called Yi Ti \u201cthe land of a thousand gods and a hundred princes, ruled by one god-emperor\u201d, The locals of Yi Ti are of similar characteristics and looks of the people living in south-east Asia in the real world. Yi Ti is said by maesters to be the oldest living civilization in the world, dating back before the the rise of the Valyrian Freehold, The Ghiscari Empire, and even before The First Men crossed The Arm of Dorne into Westeros.</p> <p>Leng, a large island as big as The Vale of Arryn near Yi Ti is home to a rather queer race, the Lengii are a slender race and are the tallest race of mankind, it is said that they reach seven or even eight feet in height, they are said to be the most beautiful of all the races, with large golden colored eyes and the skin color of oiled teak. It is said that mystical beings know as The Old Ones, live under the island\u2019s surface, and long ago instructed the empress of the island to slay all foreigners who set foot in the island multiple times, until Jar Har, the sixth sea-green emperor of Yi Ti, conquered Leng, and closed all entrances to the underground cities and ordered the Lengii to forget them. Now, the Lengii have been driven back to the southern third of the island, since YiTish locals migrated into the northern 2 thirds after Jar Har\u2019s arrival in Leng.</p> <p>It is written that almost all the wealth brought back by Corlys was from Yi Ti and Leng, but the Jade sea is a very vast place, with many islands filled with pirates, warlords, and slave traders. For all we know Corlys could have maybe landed in a lot of places on his way to Yi Ti, Qarth and Leng, including Tyrosh, The Stepstones, Lys, The Summer Isles, Naath, Basilisk Isles, Volantis, Slaver\u2019s Bay, Ghaen, Port Yhos, Great and Lesser Moraq, Isle of Whips, Isle of Elephants, Marahai and Manticore Isles.</p> <p>Imagine a spin-off TV show based on his adventures, seeing all those magnificent places, and characters, meeting different races, with more fictional things taking place (magic, other races, etc) the show will be amazing, going on voyages with his crew, meeting all sorts of people with different cultures, and ethnics, and even seeing mystical creatures, battling with sorcerers, necromancers, and shapeshifters, and maybe even seeing the fish gods or the old ones and exploring their tombs and temples, making a TV show based on a story this diverse and unique may be costly, from all the CGI of creatures and make up for other races, but from what I think, we have never seen a TV show with such a big budget and similarity with movies than Game Of Thrones. I guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see, since we are expecting the eighth season next year, and 5 spin-off series, who knows maybe one of those five spin-offs is about Corlys and his voyages?</p> <p>-Ahmed</p> <p>Links:</p> <p>Asoiaf world map: <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/ap8fmgf1fzcz.jpg\">https://i.redd.it/ap8fmgf1fzcz.jpg</a></p> <p>Corlys Velaryon: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Corlys_Velaryon\">https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Corlys_Velaryon</a></p> <p>Driftmark: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Driftmark\">https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Driftmark</a> </p> <p>Yi Ti: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Yi_Ti\">https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Yi_Ti</a></p> <p>Leng: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Leng\">https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Leng</a></p> <p>Thousand Islands: <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Thousand_Islands\">https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Thousand_Islands</a></p> </div><br><br>\nSource: <a href=\"https://ift.tt/2zcVLMn\">https://ift.tt/2zcVLMn</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>My take on what I which would happen in Season 8 of Game of Thrones. It starts after the boatsex scene and Jon and Daenerys are happy for a bit until the Truth rips them apart as well as Bran, who is still tripping.

Smaug took up residence in the Lonely Mountain and claimed the dwarves\u2019 wealth for his own<i>.</i> The ruins of an old town can still be seen around Long Lake, and the dwarves\u2019 fallen kingdom is committed to legend now:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c&hellip;in the great days of old, when Dale in the North was rich and prosperous&hellip;<b>there had been wars and deeds which were now only a legend.</b> But men remembered little of all that, <b>though some still sang old songs</b> of the dwarf-kings of the Mountain, Thror and Thrain of the race of Durin, and of the coming of the Dragon, and the fall of the lords of Dale.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>So the idea here is that the old stories of the past have become legend, the details are hazy, but memories emerge in snatches and fragments, much like the story of Azor Ahai. In this case with <i>the Hobbit,</i> the legend is about the fall of a wealthy kingdom to a dragon, while Azor Ahai appears to be about a sacrifice to forge a magic sword. There\u2019s not much they have in common at this point, except their vagueness.\u00a0</p><p>The similarities become more clear as Bilbo hears how the residents of the town on the lake (called Esgaroth) have created a prediction about Erebor returning to its former glory:</p><blockquote><p><b>Some sang too that Thror and Thrain would come back one day and gold would flow in rivers, through the mountain-gates, and all that land would be filled with new song and new laughter. </b>But this <b>pleasant legend</b> did not much affect their daily business.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Similar to Mel trying to force the issue by crowning Stannis as the Hero come again, the people of Dale are hoping that dwarf-king Thrain returns to his kingdom. The dwarves made Dale very rich, but after both of their kingdoms fell to Smaug, the current residents live in the shadow of the Lonely Mountain, and fear Smaug\u2019s wrath. The land around the mountain has turned into a\u00a0\u201cdesolation.\u201d\u00a0 The hope for a Hero Returned is part of an actual\u00a0<b>prophecy</b>, as I will show in a moment.</p><!-- more --><p>In characteristic Tolkien fashion, he includes a song about the dwarf-king\u2019s return:</p><p>\u201c<i>The King beneath the mountains,<br/>The King of carven stone,<br/>The lord of silver fountains<br/>Shall come into his own!<br/>His crown shall be upholden,<br/>His harp shall be restrung,<br/><b>His halls shall echo golden</b><br/>To songs of yore re-sung.<br/><b>The woods shall wave on mountains<br/>And grass beneath the sun;</b><br/><b>His wealth shall flow in fountains<br/>And the rivers golden run</b>.<br/>The streams shall run in gladness,<br/><b>The lakes shall shine and burn,<br/></b>All sorrow fail and sadness<br/>At the Mountain-king\u2019s return!\u201d</i></p><p>To sum up the prophecy of the King Beneath the Mountain:</p><ul><li>Is the Chosen One will return to reclaim his stolen kingdom and restore it to glory<br/></li><li>The rivers and fountains will flow with gold<br/></li><li>His halls shall echo gold<br/></li><li>The lakes will shine and burn<br/></li><li>The trees will wave in the wind and the grass will wave beneath the sun</li><li>The land will be filled with songs and laughter</li></ul><p>Sounds like a good sign, right?</p><p>Meanwhile, the prophecy of Azor Ahai involves the following:</p><ul><li>A bleeding star\u00a0</li><li>A warrior drawing a burning sword from the fire</li><li>He/she make the world anew with a summer that never ends</li><li>Bringing light/dawn in some form<b>*</b></li><li>He/she is a heroic savior</li></ul><p>This also sounds nice and happy.</p><p><b>*</b>There may be a blurring between the Prince who was Promised, the Last Hero, and the Night\u2019s Watch - since all are figures in the first Battle for the Dawn during the first Long Night. The idea of \u201cbringing the dawn\u201d is seen as the heroic act that ended in the defeat of the Others - although what that means, how it happened, and the role these heroes played is quite ambiguous. Azor Ahai has similar \u201cdawn/light\u201d imagery (although \u201cdawn\u201d is never mentioned explicitly). This prophecy appears to have originated in Asshai, separate from Westeros.</p><p>What I want to show (if it isn\u2019t apparent already) is that the prophecy of the King Beneath the Mountain returning, just like Azor Ahai returning, doesn\u2019t work out exactly as the wording suggests.</p><h2>How the prophecy was fulfilled in <i>The Hobbit</i></h2><p>Thorin does return to Esgaroth/Laketown, and the people welcome his homecoming with much fan-fare and excitement. And we do too, as readers, because the journey to get there has been harrowing, especially when we see it through Bilbo\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Bilbo was hired as a \u201cthief\u201d to steal Thorin\u2019s stolen riches back from the dragon. Bilbo does in fact steal a cup from Smaug, and this infuriates him. Not recognizing the smell of a hobbit and misinterpreting Bilbo\u2019s riddles, Smaug thinks one of the Lake-town men are to blame. He sets off a fire in the mountain, trying to burn Bilbo, then storms off in a fury to take vengeance on the town. We cut to this scene, of night watchmen in the town:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cLook!\u201d said one. \u201c<b>The lights again!</b> Last night the watchmen saw them <b>start and fade from midnight until dawn</b>. Something is happening up there.\u201d<br/>\u201cThen suddenly <b>a great light </b>appeared in the low place in the hills and the <b>northern end of the lake turned golden</b>. <b>\u201cThe King beneath the Mountain!\u201d they shouted. \u201cHis wealth is like the Sun, his silver like a fountain, his rivers golden run! The river is running gold from the Mountain!\u201d </b>they cried, and everywhere windows were opening and feet were hurrying. There was once more a tremendous excitement and enthusiasm.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>People attempt to apply the prophecy to what they are seeing - that the King Under the Mountain has returned (because they just saw him, and sent him there). So they think his kingdom has been restored, with rivers and lakes running golden - \u201cjust like in the songs.\u201d</p><p>However wiser heads know better:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cBut the grim-voiced fellow (Bard) ran hotfoot to the Master. \u201c<b>The dragon is coming or I am a fool!\u201d </b>he cried. \u201cCut the bridges! To arms! To arms!\u201d<br/>Then warning trumpets were suddenly sounded, and echoed along the rocky shores. <b>The cheering stopped and the joy was turned to dread.</b> So it was that the dragon did not find them <b>quite unprepared.\u201d</b></p></blockquote><p>Note how a bold watchman doesn\u2019t get sucked into the prophecy stuff - he\u2019s all action. The people come to realize that these lines were a warning, not a prophecy. And when you look back at the song, it makes sense. Does the line\u00a0\u201c<i><b>The lakes shall shine and burn</b></i>\u201d sound happy? The <i><b>rivers running gold </b></i>could be melted gold - but is that nice too? That actually sounds like a river of fire. It all sounds kind of terrifying now that we know what it\u2019s referring to, and what the source of the\u00a0\u201clight\u201d is:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cBefore long, so great was his speed, they could see him as <b>a spark of fire rushing towards them and growing ever huger and more bright,</b> and not the most foolish doubted <b>that the prophecies had gone rather wrong.</b>\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Tolkien ties Smaug\u2019s dragon attack back into the song, with this imagery:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cFire leaped from the dragon\u2019s jaws. He circled for a while high in the air above them <b>lighting all the lake</b>; <b>the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood </b>with leaping shadows of dense black at their feet. Then down he swooped straight through the arrow-storm, reckless in his rage, taking no heed to turn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town ablaze&hellip;</p><p>Soon he would <b>set all the shoreland woods ablaze and wither every field and pasture. </b>Just now he was enjoying the sport of town-baiting more than he had enjoyed anything for years.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The happy image of woods waving in the wind and the grass beneath the sun in the original song now sound like a terrible firestorm caused by a dragon. Indeed, Smaug is a force of nature: \u201cthe shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane.\u201d\u00a0</p><h2>Smaug as the Golden River/Drogon as Lightbringer</h2><p><a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet\" target=\"_blank\">In an extensive meta</a><a>, </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a>\u200b summarizes all of the various reactions to the red comet. This is significant piece of work because this imagery is the closet reference we have to the\u00a0\u201cbleeding star\u201d in AA (other than the sword Dawn or Wun Wun\u2019s attack at the end of Dance). The comet/dragon link is also evidence for a <i>negative</i> meaning to AA.\u00a0</p><p>The fact that Smaug looked like a\u00a0\u201cspark of fire\u201d in the sky, rushing toward the town and growing more bright, sounds like a star coming straight for them, when it is actually a dragon. And as trinuviel <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172113783619/the-legend-of-lightbringer-a-subversion-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">hypothesized</a>, Drogon is a likely fit for Lightbringer.\u00a0</p><p>However, we have to wonder what Drogon would actually be doing if that is the case? If there is a prophecy twist, the darkness\u00a0\u201cfleeing\u201d would be a <i>bad</i> omen, not a good one, because fire would be involved.<i>\u00a0</i>Also, \u201cdarkness\u201d is extremely vague. Is \u201cthe darkness\u201d actually the enemy? Doubtful. GRRM likes to invert the traditional dark=bad, light=good fantasy tropes.<i>\u00a0</i>The fact that the Others are described using light/pale imagery adds to the questionable nature of\u00a0\u201cdarkness\u201d as the enemy.</p><p>Moreover, Azor Ahai fighting \u201cdarkness\u201d could represent Bran (darkness is a positive in his chapters), which might suggest that Azor Ahai goes to war with Bran. Or perhaps a \u201ctriumph over darkness\u201d could be a \u201ctriumphant\u201d dragon attack where Dany sets fire to a city during the Long Night.\u00a0</p><p>Places like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/5ob6tp/spoilers_extended_the_destruction_of_hardhome/\" target=\"_blank\">Hardhome</a> and the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168655191984/crowned-with-fire-true-and-false-lights-in-a\" target=\"_blank\">Dragonpit</a> have also experienced intensely bright fire-related events that resembled \u201cfalse dawns&quot; from the North and South, respectively. And a fun astronomy fact - a\u00a0\u201cfalse dawn\u201d is an <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/zodiacal-lights.html\" target=\"_blank\">actual atmospheric phenomenon</a>\u00a0involving comets circulating from Jupiter around the Sun. So the comet as a symbol of a dragon could be an actual dragon in the future, with Drogon as the sword Lightbringer, a star that lights up the sky, but in an ominous way: dragon attack!</p><h2>The Ending</h2><p>The ending of t<i>he Hobbit</i>\u00a0has some commentary on this prophecy. The King Beneath the Mountain <i>did</i> return to his lost fortress - just buried in it (Thorin dies during the Battle of the Five Armies). There is also a succession crisis that takes place in Esgaroth. The townspeople have a new Master (who is more like a public official/hand of the king):</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe new Master is of wiser kind,\u201d said Balin, \u201cand very popular, for, of course, he gets most of the credit for the present prosperity. <b>They are making songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold.\u201d<br/></b>\u201c<b>Then the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true, after a fashion!</b>\u201d said Bilbo.<br/>\u201cOf course!\u201d said Gandalf. \u201cAnd why should not they prove true? <b>Surely you don\u2019t disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about yourself?\u201d</b></p></blockquote><p>Yes\u00a0\u201cafter a fashion\u201d is the key phrase. It appears that Bilbo had a hand in bringing about the first part of the prophecy - which was a warning about Smaug/Azor Ahai as a destroyer, but the \u201crivers running with gold\u201d returns again as a twist, to sound positive. I think the lesson here is that 1) people prefer positive prophecies over negative ones, so they will twist them to hope for a better future, and 2) prophecies are not checklists that are either fulfilled/not fulfilled, but socially created and interpreted.\u00a0</p><p>Thorin\u2019s cousin Dain becomes King Under the Mountain. Bard, the Aragorn-ish hero who slayed Smaug, becomes king of the city of Dale, like his father was before Smaug (of course, he\u2019s another Returned King) and takes on a rebuilding role. His story relates back to the seasons changing, where he prepares his people for winter:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c&hellip;all the valley had become tilled again and rich, and the desolation was now filled with birds and <b>blossoms in spring</b> and fruit and <b>feasting in autumn\u201d</b></p></blockquote><p>This also seems to capture the \u201cspirit\u201d of the prophecy more than <i>actual</i> golden rivers.\u00a0</p><p>And Bilbo retreats to a life of quiet solitude in the Shire, forever changed. The final line of <i>the Hobbit</i> puts all the events that Bilbo experienced in a different light. Gandalf asks Bilbo with a wink in his eye:<br/></p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by <b>mere luck, just for your sole benefit? </b>You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank goodness!\u201d said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Gandalf is suggesting that he intentionally played a role in setting off this chain of events, without Bilbo\u2019s knowledge (this motive is confirmed in the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>).</p><p>AA/PwwP and the blurring of the hidden heir/savior seems similar to<i>\u00a0the Hobbit. T</i>he prophecy is there but it deceives people, and they don\u2019t really consider the reality of the situation. The heir, Thorin had returned, which set off these chain of events that lead to the dragon attack. I can see a similar reaction if Dany learns about R+L=J.\u00a0</p><p>On one hand you have the idea of the prophecy being fulfilled by fury and fire, an entirely negative outcome. On the other hand, the spirit of the prophecy is hinted at later, which might explain why GRRM is adding in hints about Jon fulfilling it, but in a more positive way.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Overall, its interesting to think about the blurry line between magical destiny and sheer luck.

The idea of \u201cbringing the dawn\u201d is seen as the heroic act that ended in the defeat of the Others - although what that means, how it happened, and the role these heroes played is quite ambiguous. Azor Ahai has similar \u201cdawn/light\u201d imagery (although \u201cdawn\u201d is never mentioned explicitly). This prophecy appears to have originated in Asshai, separate from Westeros.</p><p>What I want to show (if it isn\u2019t apparent already) is that the prophecy of the King Beneath the Mountain returning, just like Azor Ahai returning, doesn\u2019t work out exactly as the wording suggests.</p><h2>How the prophecy was fulfilled in <i>The Hobbit</i></h2><p>Thorin does return to Esgaroth/Laketown, and the people welcome his homecoming with much fan-fare and excitement. And we do too, as readers, because the journey to get there has been harrowing, especially when we see it through Bilbo\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Bilbo was hired as a \u201cthief\u201d to steal Thorin\u2019s stolen riches back from the dragon. Bilbo does in fact steal a cup from Smaug, and this infuriates him. Not recognizing the smell of a hobbit and misinterpreting Bilbo\u2019s riddles, Smaug thinks one of the Lake-town men are to blame. He sets off a fire in the mountain, trying to burn Bilbo, then storms off in a fury to take vengeance on the town. We cut to this scene, of night watchmen in the town:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cLook!\u201d said one. \u201c<b>The lights again!</b> Last night the watchmen saw them <b>start and fade from midnight until dawn</b>. Something is happening up there.\u201d<br>\u201cThen suddenly <b>a great light </b>appeared in the low place in the hills and the <b>northern end of the lake turned golden</b>. <b>\u201cThe King beneath the Mountain!\u201d they shouted. \u201cHis wealth is like the Sun, his silver like a fountain, his rivers golden run! The river is running gold from the Mountain!\u201d </b>they cried, and everywhere windows were opening and feet were hurrying. There was once more a tremendous excitement and enthusiasm.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>People attempt to apply the prophecy to what they are seeing - that the King Under the Mountain has returned (because they just saw him, and sent him there). So they think his kingdom has been restored, with rivers and lakes running golden - \u201cjust like in the songs.\u201d</p><p>However wiser heads know better:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cBut the grim-voiced fellow (Bard) ran hotfoot to the Master. \u201c<b>The dragon is coming or I am a fool!\u201d </b>he cried. \u201cCut the bridges! To arms! To arms!\u201d<br>Then warning trumpets were suddenly sounded, and echoed along the rocky shores. <b>The cheering stopped and the joy was turned to dread.</b> So it was that the dragon did not find them <b>quite unprepared.\u201d</b></p></blockquote><p>Note how a bold watchman doesn\u2019t get sucked into the prophecy stuff - he\u2019s all action. The people come to realize that these lines were a warning, not a prophecy. And when you look back at the song, it makes sense. Does the line\u00a0\u201c<i><b>The lakes shall shine and burn</b></i>\u201d sound happy? The <i><b>rivers running gold </b></i>could be melted gold - but is that nice too? That actually sounds like a river of fire. It all sounds kind of terrifying now that we know what it\u2019s referring to, and what the source of the\u00a0\u201clight\u201d is:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cBefore long, so great was his speed, they could see him as <b>a spark of fire rushing towards them and growing ever huger and more bright,</b> and not the most foolish doubted <b>that the prophecies had gone rather wrong.</b>\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Tolkien ties Smaug\u2019s dragon attack back into the song, with this imagery:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cFire leaped from the dragon\u2019s jaws. He circled for a while high in the air above them <b>lighting all the lake</b>; <b>the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood </b>with leaping shadows of dense black at their feet. Then down he swooped straight through the arrow-storm, reckless in his rage, taking no heed to turn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town ablaze\u2026</p><p>Soon he would <b>set all the shoreland woods ablaze and wither every field and pasture. </b>Just now he was enjoying the sport of town-baiting more than he had enjoyed anything for years.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The happy image of woods waving in the wind and the grass beneath the sun in the original song now sound like a terrible firestorm caused by a dragon. Indeed, Smaug is a force of nature: \u201cthe shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane.\u201d\u00a0</p><h2>Smaug as the Golden River/Drogon as Lightbringer</h2><p><a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet\" target=\"_blank\">In an extensive meta</a><a>, </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a>\u200b summarizes all of the various reactions to the red comet. This is significant piece of work because this imagery is the closet reference we have to the\u00a0\u201cbleeding star\u201d in AA (other than the sword Dawn or Wun Wun\u2019s attack at the end of Dance). The comet/dragon link is also evidence for a <i>negative</i> meaning to AA.\u00a0</p><p>The fact that Smaug looked like a\u00a0\u201cspark of fire\u201d in the sky, rushing toward the town and growing more bright, sounds like a star coming straight for them, when it is actually a dragon. And as trinuviel <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172113783619/the-legend-of-lightbringer-a-subversion-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">hypothesized</a>, Drogon is a likely fit for Lightbringer.\u00a0</p><p>However, we have to wonder what Drogon would actually be doing if that is the case? If there is a prophecy twist, the darkness\u00a0\u201cfleeing\u201d would be a <i>bad</i> omen, not a good one, because fire would be involved.<i>\u00a0</i>Also, \u201cdarkness\u201d is extremely vague. Is \u201cthe darkness\u201d actually the enemy? Doubtful. GRRM likes to invert the traditional dark=bad, light=good fantasy tropes.<i>\u00a0</i>The fact that the Others are described using light/pale imagery adds to the questionable nature of\u00a0\u201cdarkness\u201d as the enemy.</p><p>Moreover, Azor Ahai fighting \u201cdarkness\u201d could represent Bran (darkness is a positive in his chapters), which might suggest that Azor Ahai goes to war with Bran. Or perhaps a \u201ctriumph over darkness\u201d could be a \u201ctriumphant\u201d dragon attack where Dany sets fire to a city during the Long Night.\u00a0</p><p>Places like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/5ob6tp/spoilers_extended_the_destruction_of_hardhome/\" target=\"_blank\">Hardhome</a> and the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168655191984/crowned-with-fire-true-and-false-lights-in-a\" target=\"_blank\">Dragonpit</a> have also experienced intensely bright fire-related events that resembled \u201cfalse dawns\" from the North and South, respectively. And a fun astronomy fact - a\u00a0\u201cfalse dawn\u201d is an <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/zodiacal-lights.html\" target=\"_blank\">actual atmospheric phenomenon</a>\u00a0involving comets circulating from Jupiter around the Sun. So the comet as a symbol of a dragon could be an actual dragon in the future, with Drogon as the sword Lightbringer, a star that lights up the sky, but in an ominous way: dragon attack!</p><h2>The Ending</h2><p>The ending of t<i>he Hobbit</i>\u00a0has some commentary on this prophecy. The King Beneath the Mountain <i>did</i> return to his lost fortress - just buried in it (Thorin dies during the Battle of the Five Armies). There is also a succession crisis that takes place in Esgaroth. The townspeople have a new Master (who is more like a public official/hand of the king):</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe new Master is of wiser kind,\u201d said Balin, \u201cand very popular, for, of course, he gets most of the credit for the present prosperity. <b>They are making songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold.\u201d<br></b>\u201c<b>Then the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true, after a fashion!</b>\u201d said Bilbo.<br>\u201cOf course!\u201d said Gandalf. \u201cAnd why should not they prove true? <b>Surely you don\u2019t disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about yourself?\u201d</b></p></blockquote><p>Yes\u00a0\u201cafter a fashion\u201d is the key phrase. It appears that Bilbo had a hand in bringing about the first part of the prophecy - which was a warning about Smaug/Azor Ahai as a destroyer, but the \u201crivers running with gold\u201d returns again as a twist, to sound positive. I think the lesson here is that 1) people prefer positive prophecies over negative ones, so they will twist them to hope for a better future, and 2) prophecies are not checklists that are either fulfilled/not fulfilled, but socially created and interpreted.\u00a0</p><p>Thorin\u2019s cousin Dain becomes King Under the Mountain. Bard, the Aragorn-ish hero who slayed Smaug, becomes king of the city of Dale, like his father was before Smaug (of course, he\u2019s another Returned King) and takes on a rebuilding role. His story relates back to the seasons changing, where he prepares his people for winter:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c\u2026all the valley had become tilled again and rich, and the desolation was now filled with birds and <b>blossoms in spring</b> and fruit and <b>feasting in autumn\u201d</b></p></blockquote><p>This also seems to capture the \u201cspirit\u201d of the prophecy more than <i>actual</i> golden rivers.\u00a0</p><p>And Bilbo retreats to a life of quiet solitude in the Shire, forever changed. The final line of <i>the Hobbit</i> puts all the events that Bilbo experienced in a different light. Gandalf asks Bilbo with a wink in his eye:<br></p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by <b>mere luck, just for your sole benefit? </b>You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank goodness!\u201d said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Gandalf is suggesting that he intentionally played a role in setting off this chain of events, without Bilbo\u2019s knowledge (this motive is confirmed in the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>).</p><p>AA/PwwP and the blurring of the hidden heir/savior seems similar to<i>\u00a0the Hobbit. T</i>he prophecy is there but it deceives people, and they don\u2019t really consider the reality of the situation. The heir, Thorin had returned, which set off these chain of events that lead to the dragon attack. I can see a similar reaction if Dany learns about R+L=J.\u00a0</p><p>On one hand you have the idea of the prophecy being fulfilled by fury and fire, an entirely negative outcome. On the other hand, the spirit of the prophecy is hinted at later, which might explain why GRRM is adding in hints about Jon fulfilling it, but in a more positive way.\u00a0<br></p><p>Overall, its interesting to think about the blurry line between magical destiny and sheer luck. At least in this tale, the townsfolk\u2019s prophecy could just be the wish for a promised hero, inventing a \u201cstory layer\u201d of events, leaving us to wonder if the events would have happened regardless of whether the prophecy existed or not.\u00a0</p>",

Smaug took up residence in the Lonely Mountain and claimed the dwarves\u2019 wealth for his own<i>.</i> The ruins of an old town can still be seen around Long Lake, and the dwarves\u2019 fallen kingdom is committed to legend now:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c\u2026in the great days of old, when Dale in the North was rich and prosperous\u2026<b>there had been wars and deeds which were now only a legend.</b> But men remembered little of all that, <b>though some still sang old songs</b> of the dwarf-kings of the Mountain, Thror and Thrain of the race of Durin, and of the coming of the Dragon, and the fall of the lords of Dale.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>So the idea here is that the old stories of the past have become legend, the details are hazy, but memories emerge in snatches and fragments, much like the story of Azor Ahai. In this case with <i>the Hobbit,</i> the legend is about the fall of a wealthy kingdom to a dragon, while Azor Ahai appears to be about a sacrifice to forge a magic sword. There\u2019s not much they have in common at this point, except their vagueness.\u00a0</p><p>The similarities become more clear as Bilbo hears how the residents of the town on the lake (called Esgaroth) have created a prediction about Erebor returning to its former glory:</p><blockquote><p><b>Some sang too that Thror and Thrain would come back one day and gold would flow in rivers, through the mountain-gates, and all that land would be filled with new song and new laughter. </b>But this <b>pleasant legend</b> did not much affect their daily business.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Similar to Mel trying to force the issue by crowning Stannis as the Hero come again, the people of Dale are hoping that dwarf-king Thrain returns to his kingdom. The dwarves made Dale very rich, but after both of their kingdoms fell to Smaug, the current residents live in the shadow of the Lonely Mountain, and fear Smaug\u2019s wrath. The land around the mountain has turned into a\u00a0\u201cdesolation.\u201d\u00a0 The hope for a Hero Returned is part of an actual\u00a0<b>prophecy</b>, as I will show in a moment.</p>[[MORE]]<p>In characteristic Tolkien fashion, he includes a song about the dwarf-king\u2019s return:</p><p>\u201c<i>The King beneath the mountains,<br>The King of carven stone,<br>The lord of silver fountains<br>Shall come into his own!<br>His crown shall be upholden,<br>His harp shall be restrung,<br><b>His halls shall echo golden</b><br>To songs of yore re-sung.<br><b>The woods shall wave on mountains<br>And grass beneath the sun;</b><br><b>His wealth shall flow in fountains<br>And the rivers golden run</b>.<br>The streams shall run in gladness,<br><b>The lakes shall shine and burn,<br></b>All sorrow fail and sadness<br>At the Mountain-king\u2019s return!\u201d</i></p><p>To sum up the prophecy of the King Beneath the Mountain:</p><ul><li>Is the Chosen One will return to reclaim his stolen kingdom and restore it to glory<br></li><li>The rivers and fountains will flow with gold<br></li><li>His halls shall echo gold<br></li><li>The lakes will shine and burn<br></li><li>The trees will wave in the wind and the grass will wave beneath the sun</li><li>The land will be filled with songs and laughter</li></ul><p>Sounds like a good sign, right?</p><p>Meanwhile, the prophecy of Azor Ahai involves the following:</p><ul><li>A bleeding star\u00a0</li><li>A warrior drawing a burning sword from the fire</li><li>He/she make the world anew with a summer that never ends</li><li>Bringing light/dawn in some form<b>*</b></li><li>He/she is a heroic savior</li></ul><p>This also sounds nice and happy.</p><p><b>*</b>There may be a blurring between the Prince who was Promised, the Last Hero, and the Night\u2019s Watch - since all are figures in the first Battle for the Dawn during the first Long Night. The idea of \u201cbringing the dawn\u201d is seen as the heroic act that ended in the defeat of the Others - although what that means, how it happened, and the role these heroes played is quite ambiguous. Azor Ahai has similar \u201cdawn/light\u201d imagery (although \u201cdawn\u201d is never mentioned explicitly). This prophecy appears to have originated in Asshai, separate from Westeros.</p><p>What I want to show (if it isn\u2019t apparent already) is that the prophecy of the King Beneath the Mountain returning, just like Azor Ahai returning, doesn\u2019t work out exactly as the wording suggests.</p><h2>How the prophecy was fulfilled in <i>The Hobbit</i></h2><p>Thorin does return to Esgaroth/Laketown, and the people welcome his homecoming with much fan-fare and excitement. And we do too, as readers, because the journey to get there has been harrowing, especially when we see it through Bilbo\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Bilbo was hired as a \u201cthief\u201d to steal Thorin\u2019s stolen riches back from the dragon. Bilbo does in fact steal a cup from Smaug, and this infuriates him. Not recognizing the smell of a hobbit and misinterpreting Bilbo\u2019s riddles, Smaug thinks one of the Lake-town men are to blame. He sets off a fire in the mountain, trying to burn Bilbo, then storms off in a fury to take vengeance on the town. We cut to this scene, of night watchmen in the town:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cLook!\u201d said one. \u201c<b>The lights again!</b> Last night the watchmen saw them <b>start and fade from midnight until dawn</b>. Something is happening up there.\u201d<br>\u201cThen suddenly <b>a great light </b>appeared in the low place in the hills and the <b>northern end of the lake turned golden</b>. <b>\u201cThe King beneath the Mountain!\u201d they shouted. \u201cHis wealth is like the Sun, his silver like a fountain, his rivers golden run! The river is running gold from the Mountain!\u201d </b>they cried, and everywhere windows were opening and feet were hurrying. There was once more a tremendous excitement and enthusiasm.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>People attempt to apply the prophecy to what they are seeing - that the King Under the Mountain has returned (because they just saw him, and sent him there). So they think his kingdom has been restored, with rivers and lakes running golden - \u201cjust like in the songs.\u201d</p><p>However wiser heads know better:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cBut the grim-voiced fellow (Bard) ran hotfoot to the Master. \u201c<b>The dragon is coming or I am a fool!\u201d </b>he cried. \u201cCut the bridges! To arms! To arms!\u201d<br>Then warning trumpets were suddenly sounded, and echoed along the rocky shores. <b>The cheering stopped and the joy was turned to dread.</b> So it was that the dragon did not find them <b>quite unprepared.\u201d</b></p></blockquote><p>Note how a bold watchman doesn\u2019t get sucked into the prophecy stuff - he\u2019s all action. The people come to realize that these lines were a warning, not a prophecy. And when you look back at the song, it makes sense. Does the line\u00a0\u201c<i><b>The lakes shall shine and burn</b></i>\u201d sound happy? The <i><b>rivers running gold </b></i>could be melted gold - but is that nice too? That actually sounds like a river of fire. It all sounds kind of terrifying now that we know what it\u2019s referring to, and what the source of the\u00a0\u201clight\u201d is:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cBefore long, so great was his speed, they could see him as <b>a spark of fire rushing towards them and growing ever huger and more bright,</b> and not the most foolish doubted <b>that the prophecies had gone rather wrong.</b>\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Tolkien ties Smaug\u2019s dragon attack back into the song, with this imagery:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cFire leaped from the dragon\u2019s jaws. He circled for a while high in the air above them <b>lighting all the lake</b>; <b>the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood </b>with leaping shadows of dense black at their feet. Then down he swooped straight through the arrow-storm, reckless in his rage, taking no heed to turn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town ablaze\u2026</p><p>Soon he would <b>set all the shoreland woods ablaze and wither every field and pasture. </b>Just now he was enjoying the sport of town-baiting more than he had enjoyed anything for years.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The happy image of woods waving in the wind and the grass beneath the sun in the original song now sound like a terrible firestorm caused by a dragon. Indeed, Smaug is a force of nature: \u201cthe shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane.\u201d\u00a0</p><h2>Smaug as the Golden River/Drogon as Lightbringer</h2><p><a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet\" target=\"_blank\">In an extensive meta</a><a>, </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a>\u200b summarizes all of the various reactions to the red comet. This is significant piece of work because this imagery is the closet reference we have to the\u00a0\u201cbleeding star\u201d in AA (other than the sword Dawn or Wun Wun\u2019s attack at the end of Dance). The comet/dragon link is also evidence for a <i>negative</i> meaning to AA.\u00a0</p><p>The fact that Smaug looked like a\u00a0\u201cspark of fire\u201d in the sky, rushing toward the town and growing more bright, sounds like a star coming straight for them, when it is actually a dragon. And as trinuviel <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172113783619/the-legend-of-lightbringer-a-subversion-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">hypothesized</a>, Drogon is a likely fit for Lightbringer.\u00a0</p><p>However, we have to wonder what Drogon would actually be doing if that is the case? If there is a prophecy twist, the darkness\u00a0\u201cfleeing\u201d would be a <i>bad</i> omen, not a good one, because fire would be involved.<i>\u00a0</i>Also, \u201cdarkness\u201d is extremely vague. Is \u201cthe darkness\u201d actually the enemy? Doubtful. GRRM likes to invert the traditional dark=bad, light=good fantasy tropes.<i>\u00a0</i>The fact that the Others are described using light/pale imagery adds to the questionable nature of\u00a0\u201cdarkness\u201d as the enemy.</p><p>Moreover, Azor Ahai fighting \u201cdarkness\u201d could represent Bran (darkness is a positive in his chapters), which might suggest that Azor Ahai goes to war with Bran. Or perhaps a \u201ctriumph over darkness\u201d could be a \u201ctriumphant\u201d dragon attack where Dany sets fire to a city during the Long Night.\u00a0</p><p>Places like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/5ob6tp/spoilers_extended_the_destruction_of_hardhome/\" target=\"_blank\">Hardhome</a> and the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168655191984/crowned-with-fire-true-and-false-lights-in-a\" target=\"_blank\">Dragonpit</a> have also experienced intensely bright fire-related events that resembled \u201cfalse dawns\" from the North and South, respectively. And a fun astronomy fact - a\u00a0\u201cfalse dawn\u201d is an <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/zodiacal-lights.html\" target=\"_blank\">actual atmospheric phenomenon</a>\u00a0involving comets circulating from Jupiter around the Sun. So the comet as a symbol of a dragon could be an actual dragon in the future, with Drogon as the sword Lightbringer, a star that lights up the sky, but in an ominous way: dragon attack!</p><h2>The Ending</h2><p>The ending of t<i>he Hobbit</i>\u00a0has some commentary on this prophecy. The King Beneath the Mountain <i>did</i> return to his lost fortress - just buried in it (Thorin dies during the Battle of the Five Armies). There is also a succession crisis that takes place in Esgaroth. The townspeople have a new Master (who is more like a public official/hand of the king):</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe new Master is of wiser kind,\u201d said Balin, \u201cand very popular, for, of course, he gets most of the credit for the present prosperity. <b>They are making songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold.\u201d<br></b>\u201c<b>Then the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true, after a fashion!</b>\u201d said Bilbo.<br>\u201cOf course!\u201d said Gandalf. \u201cAnd why should not they prove true? <b>Surely you don\u2019t disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about yourself?\u201d</b></p></blockquote><p>Yes\u00a0\u201cafter a fashion\u201d is the key phrase. It appears that Bilbo had a hand in bringing about the first part of the prophecy - which was a warning about Smaug/Azor Ahai as a destroyer, but the \u201crivers running with gold\u201d returns again as a twist, to sound positive. I think the lesson here is that 1) people prefer positive prophecies over negative ones, so they will twist them to hope for a better future, and 2) prophecies are not checklists that are either fulfilled/not fulfilled, but socially created and interpreted.\u00a0</p><p>Thorin\u2019s cousin Dain becomes King Under the Mountain. Bard, the Aragorn-ish hero who slayed Smaug, becomes king of the city of Dale, like his father was before Smaug (of course, he\u2019s another Returned King) and takes on a rebuilding role. His story relates back to the seasons changing, where he prepares his people for winter:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c\u2026all the valley had become tilled again and rich, and the desolation was now filled with birds and <b>blossoms in spring</b> and fruit and <b>feasting in autumn\u201d</b></p></blockquote><p>This also seems to capture the \u201cspirit\u201d of the prophecy more than <i>actual</i> golden rivers.\u00a0</p><p>And Bilbo retreats to a life of quiet solitude in the Shire, forever changed. The final line of <i>the Hobbit</i> puts all the events that Bilbo experienced in a different light. Gandalf asks Bilbo with a wink in his eye:<br></p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by <b>mere luck, just for your sole benefit? </b>You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank goodness!\u201d said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Gandalf is suggesting that he intentionally played a role in setting off this chain of events, without Bilbo\u2019s knowledge (this motive is confirmed in the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>).</p><p>AA/PwwP and the blurring of the hidden heir/savior seems similar to<i>\u00a0the Hobbit. T</i>he prophecy is there but it deceives people, and they don\u2019t really consider the reality of the situation. The heir, Thorin had returned, which set off these chain of events that lead to the dragon attack. I can see a similar reaction if Dany learns about R+L=J.\u00a0</p><p>On one hand you have the idea of the prophecy being fulfilled by fury and fire, an entirely negative outcome. On the other hand, the spirit of the prophecy is hinted at later, which might explain why GRRM is adding in hints about Jon fulfilling it, but in a more positive way.\u00a0<br></p><p>Overall, its interesting to think about the blurry line between magical destiny and sheer luck. At least in this tale, the townsfolk\u2019s prophecy could just be the wish for a promised hero, inventing a \u201cstory layer\u201d of events, leaving us to wonder if the events would have happened regardless of whether the prophecy existed or not.\u00a0</p>",

He circled for a while high in the air above them <b>lighting all the lake</b>; <b>the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood </b>with leaping shadows of dense black at their feet. Then down he swooped straight through the arrow-storm, reckless in his rage, taking no heed to turn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town ablaze&hellip;</p><p>Soon he would <b>set all the shoreland woods ablaze and wither every field and pasture. </b>Just now he was enjoying the sport of town-baiting more than he had enjoyed anything for years.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The happy image of woods waving in the wind and the grass beneath the sun in the original song now sound like a terrible firestorm caused by a dragon. Indeed, Smaug is a force of nature: &ldquo;the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><h2>Smaug as the Golden River/Drogon as Lightbringer</h2><p><a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet\" target=\"_blank\">In an extensive meta</a><a>, </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a>&#8203; summarizes all of the various reactions to the red comet. This is significant piece of work because this imagery is the closet reference we have to the&nbsp;&ldquo;bleeding star&rdquo; in AA (other than the sword Dawn or Wun Wun&rsquo;s attack at the end of Dance). The comet/dragon link is also evidence for a <i>negative</i> meaning to AA.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that Smaug looked like a&nbsp;&ldquo;spark of fire&rdquo; in the sky, rushing toward the town and growing more bright, sounds like a star coming straight for them, when it is actually a dragon. And as trinuviel <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172113783619/the-legend-of-lightbringer-a-subversion-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">hypothesized</a>, Drogon is a likely fit for Lightbringer.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we have to wonder what Drogon would actually be doing if that is the case? If there is a prophecy twist, the darkness&nbsp;&ldquo;fleeing&rdquo; would be a <i>bad</i> omen, not a good one, because fire would be involved.<i>&nbsp;</i>Also, &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; is extremely vague. Is &ldquo;the darkness&rdquo; actually the enemy? Doubtful. GRRM likes to invert the traditional dark=bad, light=good fantasy tropes.<i>&nbsp;</i>The fact that the Others are described using light/pale imagery adds to the questionable nature of&nbsp;&ldquo;darkness&rdquo; as the enemy.</p><p>Moreover, Azor Ahai fighting &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; could represent Bran (darkness is a positive in his chapters), which might suggest that Azor Ahai goes to war with Bran. Or perhaps a &ldquo;triumph over darkness&rdquo; could be a &ldquo;triumphant&rdquo; dragon attack where Dany sets fire to a city during the Long Night.&nbsp;</p><p>Places like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/5ob6tp/spoilers_extended_the_destruction_of_hardhome/\" target=\"_blank\">Hardhome</a> and the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168655191984/crowned-with-fire-true-and-false-lights-in-a\" target=\"_blank\">Dragonpit</a> have also experienced intensely bright fire-related events that resembled &ldquo;false dawns\" from the North and South, respectively. And a fun astronomy fact - a&nbsp;&ldquo;false dawn&rdquo; is an <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/zodiacal-lights.html\" target=\"_blank\">actual atmospheric phenomenon</a>&nbsp;involving comets circulating from Jupiter around the Sun. So the comet as a symbol of a dragon could be an actual dragon in the future, with Drogon as the sword Lightbringer, a star that lights up the sky, but in an ominous way: dragon attack!</p><h2>The Ending</h2><p>The ending of t<i>he Hobbit</i>&nbsp;has some commentary on this prophecy. The King Beneath the Mountain <i>did</i> return to his lost fortress - just buried in it (Thorin dies during the Battle of the Five Armies). There is also a succession crisis that takes place in Esgaroth. The townspeople have a new Master (who is more like a public official/hand of the king):</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The new Master is of wiser kind,&rdquo; said Balin, &ldquo;and very popular, for, of course, he gets most of the credit for the present prosperity. <b>They are making songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold.&rdquo;<br /></b>&ldquo;<b>Then the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true, after a fashion!</b>&rdquo; said Bilbo.<br />&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said Gandalf. &ldquo;And why should not they prove true? <b>Surely you don&rsquo;t disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about yourself?&rdquo;</b></p></blockquote><p>Yes&nbsp;&ldquo;after a fashion&rdquo; is the key phrase. It appears that Bilbo had a hand in bringing about the first part of the prophecy - which was a warning about Smaug/Azor Ahai as a destroyer, but the &ldquo;rivers running with gold&rdquo; returns again as a twist, to sound positive. I think the lesson here is that 1) people prefer positive prophecies over negative ones, so they will twist them to hope for a better future, and 2) prophecies are not checklists that are either fulfilled/not fulfilled, but socially created and interpreted.&nbsp;</p><p>Thorin&rsquo;s cousin Dain becomes King Under the Mountain. Bard, the Aragorn-ish hero who slayed Smaug, becomes king of the city of Dale, like his father was before Smaug (of course, he&rsquo;s another Returned King) and takes on a rebuilding role. His story relates back to the seasons changing, where he prepares his people for winter:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;&hellip;all the valley had become tilled again and rich, and the desolation was now filled with birds and <b>blossoms in spring</b> and fruit and <b>feasting in autumn&rdquo;</b></p></blockquote><p>This also seems to capture the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of the prophecy more than <i>actual</i> golden rivers.&nbsp;</p><p>And Bilbo retreats to a life of quiet solitude in the Shire, forever changed. The final line of <i>the Hobbit</i> puts all the events that Bilbo experienced in a different light. Gandalf asks Bilbo with a wink in his eye:<br /></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by <b>mere luck, just for your sole benefit? </b>You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Gandalf is suggesting that he intentionally played a role in setting off this chain of events, without Bilbo&rsquo;s knowledge (this motive is confirmed in the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>).</p><p>AA/PwwP and the blurring of the hidden heir/savior seems similar to<i>&nbsp;the Hobbit. T</i>he prophecy is there but it deceives people, and they don&rsquo;t really consider the reality of the situation. The heir, Thorin had returned, which set off these chain of events that lead to the dragon attack. I can see a similar reaction if Dany learns about R+L=J.&nbsp;</p><p>On one hand you have the idea of the prophecy being fulfilled by fury and fire, an entirely negative outcome. On the other hand, the spirit of the prophecy is hinted at later, which might explain why GRRM is adding in hints about Jon fulfilling it, but in a more positive way.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Overall, its interesting to think about the blurry line between magical destiny and sheer luck. At least in this tale, the townsfolk&rsquo;s prophecy could just be the wish for a promised hero, inventing a &ldquo;story layer&rdquo; of events, leaving us to wonder if the events would have happened regardless of whether the prophecy existed or not.&nbsp;</p>",

Trinuviel states that&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Rather than being the promise of a saviour, the prophecy should be interpreted as a warning of the coming a destroyer that will bathe the world in fire.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i>Evidence for AA as a warning or perhaps a bad omen becomes clearer when examining the use of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168655191984/crowned-with-fire-true-and-false-lights-in-a\" target=\"_blank\">false dawn/lights</a>, connecting the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet\" target=\"_blank\">red comet</a>&nbsp;to the imagery of fire and blood,&nbsp;asking if the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168087267884/azor-ahai-the-prince-that-was-promised-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">Red Sword of Heroes</a> is an actual sword, and questioning the orthodoxy that <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/172498117899/three-heads-has-the-dragon-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">the 3 heads of the dragon</a> are heroes who will save the world.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/399e488fddf2ec5ef5ccae7d5234fcb8/tumblr_inline_pbdwtg2MDr1run9xa_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Artwork: <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/gaius31duke/art/Smaug-destroys-Esgaroth-163220691\" target=\"_blank\">Gaius31duke</a></p>\n<p>Tolkien had his own prophecy twist that I want to relate to Azor Ahai - especially the extremely positive way in which Melisandre and other red priests are interpreting this figure in the text.</p>\n<p>Before the events of <i>the Hobbit,&nbsp;</i>Smaug assaulted both the dwarves&rsquo; kingdom Erebor and the kingdom Dale where men lived. Smaug took up residence in the Lonely Mountain and claimed the dwarves&rsquo; wealth for his own<i>.</i> The ruins of an old town can still be seen around Long Lake, and the dwarves&rsquo; fallen kingdom is committed to legend now:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&hellip;in the great days of old, when Dale in the North was rich and prosperous&hellip;<b>there had been wars and deeds which were now only a legend.</b> But men remembered little of all that, <b>though some still sang old songs</b> of the dwarf-kings of the Mountain, Thror and Thrain of the race of Durin, and of the coming of the Dragon, and the fall of the lords of Dale.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>So the idea here is that the old stories of the past have become legend, the details are hazy, but memories emerge in snatches and fragments, much like the story of Azor Ahai. In this case with <i>the Hobbit,</i> the legend is about the fall of a wealthy kingdom to a dragon, while Azor Ahai appears to be about a sacrifice to forge a magic sword. There&rsquo;s not much they have in common at this point, except their vagueness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The similarities become more clear as Bilbo hears how the residents of the town on the lake (called Esgaroth) have created a prediction about Erebor returning to its former glory:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Some sang too that Thror and Thrain would come back one day and gold would flow in rivers, through the mountain-gates, and all that land would be filled with new song and new laughter. </b>But this <b>pleasant legend</b> did not much affect their daily business.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Similar to Mel trying to force the issue by crowning Stannis as the Hero come again, the people of Dale are hoping that dwarf-king Thrain returns to his kingdom. The dwarves made Dale very rich, but after both of their kingdoms fell to Smaug, the current residents live in the shadow of the Lonely Mountain, and fear Smaug&rsquo;s wrath. The land around the mountain has turned into a&nbsp;&ldquo;desolation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hope for a Hero Returned is part of an actual&nbsp;<b>prophecy</b>, as I will show in a moment.</p>\n</p>",
