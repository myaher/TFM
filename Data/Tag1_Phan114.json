He spent the evening editing the video with Dan watching from the sidelines to get a better look at what editing was really like. And when he was done, he processed it to his YouTube page and waited to publish it.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut now it was ready, he felt his chest tighten. This was a big deal. This was a big deal because this video was the first one he posted in\u20266 years? Had it really been that long?\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was nervous for the comeback.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was nervous for the comments, the tweets and for everything else that is going to come out when everyone sees Dan in the thumbnail. He was nervous for the queued tweet that he has ready to go saying \u201cNOT CLICKBAIT. NEW VIDEO FEATURING DANIEL HOWELL\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not sure about this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looked at where Phil\u2019s finger was poised over the trackpad. \u201cNot sure about what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAbout posting the video.\u201d Phil said, his hand now beginning to shake slightly.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe turned his head and looked at Dan, trying to ignore that he saw a little bit of disappointment behind his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to post it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2026I know.\u201d Phil said, his voice quivering. \u201cI think I\u2019m just nervous.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked back at the screen and watched his mouse hover over the button. He shouldn\u2019t be this nervous. Maybe if it was just a video of himself, he wouldn\u2019t be. But surely just knowing Dan was in the video shouldn\u2019t be the only reason why he\u2019s nervous?\u00a0</p><p>\tHe pressed his fingers down and the video went live.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe felt all air escape his lungs and looked over at Dan was smiling. \u201cSend me the link and I\u2019ll post it on my Twitter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly copied the link with shaking hands and then sent it to Dan. As soon as Dan tweeted out the link, Phil shut his laptop down and took a few stuttering breaths. He needed to relax and to calm down. There was no point in getting worked up over something that he couldn\u2019t really change anymore\u2026well, he could. But hypothetically he couldn\u2019t.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe tweeted out the same tweet he had queued in his drafts and then he retweeted Dan\u2019s tweet and then sat back, staring at his phone. He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised at how his name was trending. Nor should he have been surprised at the amount of follow requests he received as well.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe accepted none of them and closed the app, turning off his notifications for Twitter so he wouldn\u2019t have to see them.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI have to fly back to LA tomorrow morning.\u201d Dan says, out of the blue, as they remained sat on Phil\u2019s couch. \u201cFilming begins again tomorrow night. I have to catch a plane at half past 6 tomorrow morning.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil couldn\u2019t help but feel the pang in his chest from Dan\u2019s words. \u201cSo soon?\u201d He found himself asking.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a sigh. \u201cUnfortunately.\u201d He paused. \u201cTomorrow I get to film a sex scene.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly turned his head. \u201cA sex scene?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cYes, with Mimei.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat sounds\u2026awkward?\u201d Phil asked, finding himself chuckle.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh it\u2019s going to be incredibly awkward.\u201d Dan said with a loud laugh. \u201cNot only is it a sex scene which like, don\u2019t get me wrong, I love having sex, but not staged sex? And even though this is obviously not sex and we\u2019ll not be actually fornicating, the thought that I have to go through the motions completely staged is a little bit repulsing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t think I could do it.\u201d Phil answered truthfully. \u201cI\u2019m awkward enough about life in general. I can\u2019t imagine having to fake have sex with a person while being filmed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve done it before.\u201d Dan says, his eyes staring straight ahead. \u201cIt was for an Indie Movie that I did prior to me becoming famous. It was with my ex-boyfriend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan swallowed and then continued. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad? But that could have also been because we were used to having sex anyway so staging it wasn\u2019t quite that hard to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever do it.\u201d Phil repeats.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI think it would be less awkward for me if it wasn\u2019t with a Mimei.\u201d Dan says. \u201cLike, if it was with a guy, I think I\u2019d be better off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was a little bit taken back by the openness of this conversation he was having with Dan. He wasn\u2019t expecting for Dan to openly be speaking to sex about him. It was a little bit dizzying given all of the circumstances of today.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh same.\u201d Phil found himself choking out.</p><p>\t\u201cOh?\u201d Dan says, a smile playing on his lips.</p><p>\t\u201cI just prefer to have sex with guys.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt like he was choking on his own air. He was having trouble registering in his mind that he had just come out to Dan. Not directly, but he still kind of did. And it was a big deal. It was a massive deal, actually. Because up until him telling this to Dan, his family and PJ and Sophie were the only ones who knew about his sexuality.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou probably already knew about me.\u201d Dan says. \u201cAnd my preference over who I like.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels slightly embarrassed and ashamed. He had read about it on Wikipedia, that sensitive information not even hidden from the public, but plastered onto this website with millions of visitors a day.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you don\u2019t get to have privacy anymore.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shrugs. It\u2019s a genuine shrug, not one that is just blowing off what Phil had said. \u201cAt least my sex tape hasn\u2019t been released.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s eyes bug out of his head and Dan\u2019s lets out a loud laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m kidding mate. I don\u2019t have a sex tape\u2026or at least I don\u2019t think I do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>***<br/></p><p>\tTo say the video went viral was an understatement by far. Within just the first ten hours, the video already had 3 million views and was growing by the second. News sites were writing stories about the video and about Dan being in it, of course Phil was mentioned as well but a lot more sparingly.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil could see now what it felt like to have people saying your name in every news story or in every twitter mention. He couldn\u2019t even keep up with all of the people requesting to follow him so, unwillingly, he unprivated his Twitter and let the follows happen. He went from just under 30k followers to almost 100k in the first three hours. By the next morning, he had nearly 350k followers, all of which were from Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was overwhelming. He was overwhelmed.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan knew that though. Which is why Dan suggested they order out from some greasy food place and indulge their feelings in some plastic tasting pizza. Phil never ordered Dominos, but he had to admit that it tasted good on his palette and was definitely a comfort food.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike already appreciated having bites of sausage given to him as well as he sat on Phil\u2019s feet.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo your video went viral.\u201d Dan says, between bites of pizza and whatever dipping sauce he was using. \u201cNot gonna lie, didn\u2019t quite expect that to happen.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe neither.\u201d Phil answered honestly. \u201cMy channel is growing and my Twitter is as well. I\u2019m scared to go into the comments.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow did you learn to edit?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe fast change in topic gave Phil a little bit of whiplash but he recovered fast. He rather enjoyed being able to answer questions about how he learned to do YouTube or how he learned his video editing skills, even if they are a bit rusty.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI got a masters degree is video editing and post production from the University of York.\u201d He says. \u201cI never really used it unless I was doing videos. I wanted to be a director for a little while, but I knew it wasn\u2019t a realistic dream so that\u2019s why I did YouTube. But I got hired at the BBC by pure luck and I haven\u2019t really gotten a chance to use those skills.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s really cool actually.\u201d Dan says, setting down his slice of pizza back onto his plate. \u201cI\u2019ve never been allowed in the editing room of a movie, not even when I did Indie Films in high school. But I\u2019ve always wanted to know what the process was like. Like being able to chose the frames you want or the takes you want. Sometimes when I attend my movie premieres and I watch the films, I get mad that the editor chose to use my bad takes or my bad sides and I wish I had a bit more control over it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have a bad side.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen Phil caught wind of the words leaving his mouth, he looked up from his own plate, and stared at Dan. His cheeks were flushed red and he was holding his lips in a thin line, almost to keep himself from smiling. Phil wished he would give in and just smile.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo it is true.\u201d Phil continues, his mouth just moving without his control over what was being said. \u201cIt is true because\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s destined to never finish that sentence because Dan\u2019s phone begins to ring loudly on the counter, interrupting them with the shrill sound of the default phone ring.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan grabs his phone and answers it, abruptly leaving his pizza behind to cool on the plate.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lets out a loud sigh and looks down at Spike who is whimpering for another table scrap at his feet. He just nods and picks off a piece of pepperoni and hands it to Spike with a sad chuckle.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d like to think you\u2019re whimpering at the secondhand embarrassment but I know you just want more food.\u201d Phil whispers, scratching behind Spikes ear. \u201cTo be fair, I didn\u2019t even know what I was going to say anyway. This was probably for the best.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil remained sitting in the kitchen while he heard the telltale footsteps of Dan pacing back and forth somewhere down the short hallway towards the bathroom. He couldn\u2019t make out anything Dan was saying, but he actually didn\u2019t want to. It always felt like a weird breach of privacy to listen to someone else\u2019s phone conversation.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen Dan returns, his face is flustered and his shoulders are tense. He slides back into his sit and picks at his pizza slice haphazardly with his fingers. \u201cMarianne, my manager, just called. She said doing the video was a bad PR move. I don\u2019t see how but she\u2019s really mad.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his heart fall out his chest. He knew that he shouldn\u2019t have posted the video. He knew it!\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I knew we shouldn\u2019t have posted it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not mad that we posted it. I\u2019m just\u2026I want to do things that I want to do. I wanted to do the video with you. I wanted to be a part of it. I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s a bad PR move but whatever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil could sense the frustration in Dan\u2019s voice and when he looked at Dan, he could see the beginnings of unshed tears glazing his eyes. Dan sniffled, confirming Phil\u2019s thoughts, and as soon as the first tear made way down Dan\u2019s cheek, Phil immediately thrusted a bunch of napkins to him to help.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan wiped his eyes and refused to make eye-contact with Phil. Phil felt his heart clench every time Dan sniffled and wiped at his eyes. He watched as the tears slowly stopped and all that was left was Dan\u2019s bloodshot eyes in their wake.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Dan apologizes. \u201cI just get really overwhelmed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou have every right to be upset, Dan.\u201d Phil says. His hand reaches out and suddenly, it\u2019s laying on top of Dan\u2019s arm, his fingers laying into the fuzzy fabric of his sweater. \u201cYou should be able to do what you want to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s pretty ironic.\u201d Dan says with a laugh. \u201cJust this morning, I was giving you the same talk and now you\u2019re sitting here and giving me it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil did have to admit it was pretty ironic, but that didn\u2019t make the situation any less complicated or hurtful for either one of them.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI think I need some time to myself.\u201d Dan said, suddenly standing up. \u201cDo you mind if I\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou can lay down in my bedroom if you\u2019d like.\u201d Phil said, letting his hand fall from Dan\u2019s arm to the counter. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI think I just need a few hours away from social media and from my managers constant nagging and calling. I\u2019m sorry for being such a shit guest.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd it really was okay. Phil didn\u2019t mind that Dan needed some alone time, he did as well. He needed time to process what had happened. He watched Dan\u2019s back as he retreated to be alone and Phil remained sat down, the pizza now cold on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>\tToday had been unlike any other day Phil had ever had before in his life.\u00a0</p>",

I can\u2019t imagine having to fake have sex with a person while being filmed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve done it before.\u201d Dan says, his eyes staring straight ahead. \u201cIt was for an Indie Movie that I did prior to me becoming famous. It was with my ex-boyfriend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan swallowed and then continued. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad? But that could have also been because we were used to having sex anyway so staging it wasn\u2019t quite that hard to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever do it.\u201d Phil repeats.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI think it would be less awkward for me if it wasn\u2019t with a Mimei.\u201d Dan says. \u201cLike, if it was with a guy, I think I\u2019d be better off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was a little bit taken back by the openness of this conversation he was having with Dan. He wasn\u2019t expecting for Dan to openly be speaking to sex about him. It was a little bit dizzying given all of the circumstances of today.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh same.\u201d Phil found himself choking out.</p><p>\t\u201cOh?\u201d Dan says, a smile playing on his lips.</p><p>\t\u201cI just prefer to have sex with guys.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt like he was choking on his own air. He was having trouble registering in his mind that he had just come out to Dan. Not directly, but he still kind of did. And it was a big deal. It was a massive deal, actually. Because up until him telling this to Dan, his family and PJ and Sophie were the only ones who knew about his sexuality.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou probably already knew about me.\u201d Dan says. \u201cAnd my preference over who I like.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels slightly embarrassed and ashamed. He had read about it on Wikipedia, that sensitive information not even hidden from the public, but plastered onto this website with millions of visitors a day.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you don\u2019t get to have privacy anymore.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shrugs. It\u2019s a genuine shrug, not one that is just blowing off what Phil had said. \u201cAt least my sex tape hasn\u2019t been released.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s eyes bug out of his head and Dan\u2019s lets out a loud laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m kidding mate. I don\u2019t have a sex tape\u2026or at least I don\u2019t think I do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>***<br></p><p>\tTo say the video went viral was an understatement by far. Within just the first ten hours, the video already had 3 million views and was growing by the second. News sites were writing stories about the video and about Dan being in it, of course Phil was mentioned as well but a lot more sparingly.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil could see now what it felt like to have people saying your name in every news story or in every twitter mention. He couldn\u2019t even keep up with all of the people requesting to follow him so, unwillingly, he unprivated his Twitter and let the follows happen. He went from just under 30k followers to almost 100k in the first three hours. By the next morning, he had nearly 350k followers, all of which were from Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was overwhelming. He was overwhelmed.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan knew that though. Which is why Dan suggested they order out from some greasy food place and indulge their feelings in some plastic tasting pizza. Phil never ordered Dominos, but he had to admit that it tasted good on his palette and was definitely a comfort food.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike already appreciated having bites of sausage given to him as well as he sat on Phil\u2019s feet.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo your video went viral.\u201d Dan says, between bites of pizza and whatever dipping sauce he was using. \u201cNot gonna lie, didn\u2019t quite expect that to happen.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe neither.\u201d Phil answered honestly. \u201cMy channel is growing and my Twitter is as well. I\u2019m scared to go into the comments.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow did you learn to edit?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe fast change in topic gave Phil a little bit of whiplash but he recovered fast. He rather enjoyed being able to answer questions about how he learned to do YouTube or how he learned his video editing skills, even if they are a bit rusty.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI got a masters degree is video editing and post production from the University of York.\u201d He says. \u201cI never really used it unless I was doing videos. I wanted to be a director for a little while, but I knew it wasn\u2019t a realistic dream so that\u2019s why I did YouTube. But I got hired at the BBC by pure luck and I haven\u2019t really gotten a chance to use those skills.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s really cool actually.\u201d Dan says, setting down his slice of pizza back onto his plate. \u201cI\u2019ve never been allowed in the editing room of a movie, not even when I did Indie Films in high school. But I\u2019ve always wanted to know what the process was like. Like being able to chose the frames you want or the takes you want. Sometimes when I attend my movie premieres and I watch the films, I get mad that the editor chose to use my bad takes or my bad sides and I wish I had a bit more control over it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have a bad side.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen Phil caught wind of the words leaving his mouth, he looked up from his own plate, and stared at Dan. His cheeks were flushed red and he was holding his lips in a thin line, almost to keep himself from smiling. Phil wished he would give in and just smile.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo it is true.\u201d Phil continues, his mouth just moving without his control over what was being said. \u201cIt is true because\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s destined to never finish that sentence because Dan\u2019s phone begins to ring loudly on the counter, interrupting them with the shrill sound of the default phone ring.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan grabs his phone and answers it, abruptly leaving his pizza behind to cool on the plate.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lets out a loud sigh and looks down at Spike who is whimpering for another table scrap at his feet. He just nods and picks off a piece of pepperoni and hands it to Spike with a sad chuckle.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d like to think you\u2019re whimpering at the secondhand embarrassment but I know you just want more food.\u201d Phil whispers, scratching behind Spikes ear. \u201cTo be fair, I didn\u2019t even know what I was going to say anyway. This was probably for the best.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil remained sitting in the kitchen while he heard the telltale footsteps of Dan pacing back and forth somewhere down the short hallway towards the bathroom. He couldn\u2019t make out anything Dan was saying, but he actually didn\u2019t want to. It always felt like a weird breach of privacy to listen to someone else\u2019s phone conversation.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen Dan returns, his face is flustered and his shoulders are tense. He slides back into his sit and picks at his pizza slice haphazardly with his fingers. \u201cMarianne, my manager, just called. She said doing the video was a bad PR move. I don\u2019t see how but she\u2019s really mad.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his heart fall out his chest. He knew that he shouldn\u2019t have posted the video. He knew it!\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I knew we shouldn\u2019t have posted it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not mad that we posted it. I\u2019m just\u2026I want to do things that I want to do. I wanted to do the video with you. I wanted to be a part of it. I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s a bad PR move but whatever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil could sense the frustration in Dan\u2019s voice and when he looked at Dan, he could see the beginnings of unshed tears glazing his eyes. Dan sniffled, confirming Phil\u2019s thoughts, and as soon as the first tear made way down Dan\u2019s cheek, Phil immediately thrusted a bunch of napkins to him to help.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan wiped his eyes and refused to make eye-contact with Phil. Phil felt his heart clench every time Dan sniffled and wiped at his eyes. He watched as the tears slowly stopped and all that was left was Dan\u2019s bloodshot eyes in their wake.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Dan apologizes. \u201cI just get really overwhelmed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou have every right to be upset, Dan.\u201d Phil says. His hand reaches out and suddenly, it\u2019s laying on top of Dan\u2019s arm, his fingers laying into the fuzzy fabric of his sweater. \u201cYou should be able to do what you want to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s pretty ironic.\u201d Dan says with a laugh. \u201cJust this morning, I was giving you the same talk and now you\u2019re sitting here and giving me it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil did have to admit it was pretty ironic, but that didn\u2019t make the situation any less complicated or hurtful for either one of them.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI think I need some time to myself.\u201d Dan said, suddenly standing up. \u201cDo you mind if I\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou can lay down in my bedroom if you\u2019d like.\u201d Phil said, letting his hand fall from Dan\u2019s arm to the counter. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI think I just need a few hours away from social media and from my managers constant nagging and calling. I\u2019m sorry for being such a shit guest.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd it really was okay. Phil didn\u2019t mind that Dan needed some alone time, he did as well. He needed time to process what had happened. He watched Dan\u2019s back as he retreated to be alone and Phil remained sat down, the pizza now cold on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>\tToday had been unlike any other day Phil had ever had before in his life.\u00a0</p>",

Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 2.2k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and mentions of sex\u00a0</p><p><b>Rating</b>: Mature (for right now)</p><p><b>Updates will be every Wednesday at 4pm and Sunday at 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/42573287/\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a>**</b></p>[[MORE]]<p>\tFor Phil, clicking publish on his video was, undoubtedly, one of the hardest things he has had to do in a long time. He spent the evening editing the video with Dan watching from the sidelines to get a better look at what editing was really like. And when he was done, he processed it to his YouTube page and waited to publish it.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut now it was ready, he felt his chest tighten. This was a big deal. This was a big deal because this video was the first one he posted in\u20266 years? Had it really been that long?\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was nervous for the comeback.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was nervous for the comments, the tweets and for everything else that is going to come out when everyone sees Dan in the thumbnail. He was nervous for the queued tweet that he has ready to go saying \u201cNOT CLICKBAIT. NEW VIDEO FEATURING DANIEL HOWELL\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not sure about this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looked at where Phil\u2019s finger was poised over the trackpad. \u201cNot sure about what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAbout posting the video.\u201d Phil said, his hand now beginning to shake slightly.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe turned his head and looked at Dan, trying to ignore that he saw a little bit of disappointment behind his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to post it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2026I know.\u201d Phil said, his voice quivering. \u201cI think I\u2019m just nervous.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked back at the screen and watched his mouse hover over the button. He shouldn\u2019t be this nervous. Maybe if it was just a video of himself, he wouldn\u2019t be. But surely just knowing Dan was in the video shouldn\u2019t be the only reason why he\u2019s nervous?\u00a0</p><p>\tHe pressed his fingers down and the video went live.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe felt all air escape his lungs and looked over at Dan was smiling. \u201cSend me the link and I\u2019ll post it on my Twitter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly copied the link with shaking hands and then sent it to Dan. As soon as Dan tweeted out the link, Phil shut his laptop down and took a few stuttering breaths. He needed to relax and to calm down. There was no point in getting worked up over something that he couldn\u2019t really change anymore\u2026well, he could. But hypothetically he couldn\u2019t.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe tweeted out the same tweet he had queued in his drafts and then he retweeted Dan\u2019s tweet and then sat back, staring at his phone. He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised at how his name was trending. Nor should he have been surprised at the amount of follow requests he received as well.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe accepted none of them and closed the app, turning off his notifications for Twitter so he wouldn\u2019t have to see them.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI have to fly back to LA tomorrow morning.\u201d Dan says, out of the blue, as they remained sat on Phil\u2019s couch. \u201cFilming begins again tomorrow night. I have to catch a plane at half past 6 tomorrow morning.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil couldn\u2019t help but feel the pang in his chest from Dan\u2019s words. \u201cSo soon?\u201d He found himself asking.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a sigh. \u201cUnfortunately.\u201d He paused. \u201cTomorrow I get to film a sex scene.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly turned his head. \u201cA sex scene?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cYes, with Mimei.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat sounds\u2026awkward?\u201d Phil asked, finding himself chuckle.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh it\u2019s going to be incredibly awkward.\u201d Dan said with a loud laugh. \u201cNot only is it a sex scene which like, don\u2019t get me wrong, I love having sex, but not staged sex?

He was having trouble registering in his mind that he had just come out to Dan. Not directly, but he still kind of did. And it was a big deal. It was a massive deal, actually. Because up until him telling this to Dan, his family and PJ and Sophie were the only ones who knew about his sexuality.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou probably already knew about me.\u201d Dan says. \u201cAnd my preference over who I like.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels slightly embarrassed and ashamed. He had read about it on Wikipedia, that sensitive information not even hidden from the public, but plastered onto this website with millions of visitors a day.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you don\u2019t get to have privacy anymore.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shrugs.

I\u2019m scared to go into the comments.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHow did you learn to edit?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe fast change in topic gave Phil a little bit of whiplash but he recovered fast. He rather enjoyed being able to answer questions about how he learned to do YouTube or how he learned his video editing skills, even if they are a bit rusty.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI got a masters degree is video editing and post production from the University of York.\u201d He says. \u201cI never really used it unless I was doing videos. I wanted to be a director for a little while, but I knew it wasn\u2019t a realistic dream so that\u2019s why I did YouTube. But I got hired at the BBC by pure luck and I haven\u2019t really gotten a chance to use those skills.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s really cool actually.\u201d Dan says, setting down his slice of pizza back onto his plate. \u201cI\u2019ve never been allowed in the editing room of a movie, not even when I did Indie Films in high school. But I\u2019ve always wanted to know what the process was like. Like being able to chose the frames you want or the takes you want. Sometimes when I attend my movie premieres and I watch the films, I get mad that the editor chose to use my bad takes or my bad sides and I wish I had a bit more control over it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have a bad side.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen Phil caught wind of the words leaving his mouth, he looked up from his own plate, and stared at Dan. His cheeks were flushed red and he was holding his lips in a thin line, almost to keep himself from smiling. Phil wished he would give in and just smile.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo it is true.\u201d Phil continues, his mouth just moving without his control over what was being said. \u201cIt is true because\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s destined to never finish that sentence because Dan\u2019s phone begins to ring loudly on the counter, interrupting them with the shrill sound of the default phone ring.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan grabs his phone and answers it, abruptly leaving his pizza behind to cool on the plate.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lets out a loud sigh and looks down at Spike who is whimpering for another table scrap at his feet. He just nods and picks off a piece of pepperoni and hands it to Spike with a sad chuckle.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d like to think you\u2019re whimpering at the secondhand embarrassment but I know you just want more food.\u201d Phil whispers, scratching behind Spikes ear. \u201cTo be fair, I didn\u2019t even know what I was going to say anyway. This was probably for the best.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil remained sitting in the kitchen while he heard the telltale footsteps of Dan pacing back and forth somewhere down the short hallway towards the bathroom. He couldn\u2019t make out anything Dan was saying, but he actually didn\u2019t want to. It always felt like a weird breach of privacy to listen to someone else\u2019s phone conversation.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen Dan returns, his face is flustered and his shoulders are tense. He slides back into his sit and picks at his pizza slice haphazardly with his fingers. \u201cMarianne, my manager, just called. She said doing the video was a bad PR move. I don\u2019t see how but she\u2019s really mad.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his heart fall out his chest. He knew that he shouldn\u2019t have posted the video. He knew it!\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I knew we shouldn\u2019t have posted it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not mad that we posted it. I\u2019m just\u2026I want to do things that I want to do. I wanted to do the video with you. I wanted to be a part of it. I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s a bad PR move but whatever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil could sense the frustration in Dan\u2019s voice and when he looked at Dan, he could see the beginnings of unshed tears glazing his eyes. Dan sniffled, confirming Phil\u2019s thoughts, and as soon as the first tear made way down Dan\u2019s cheek, Phil immediately thrusted a bunch of napkins to him to help.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan wiped his eyes and refused to make eye-contact with Phil. Phil felt his heart clench every time Dan sniffled and wiped at his eyes. He watched as the tears slowly stopped and all that was left was Dan\u2019s bloodshot eyes in their wake.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Dan apologizes. \u201cI just get really overwhelmed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou have every right to be upset, Dan.\u201d Phil says. His hand reaches out and suddenly, it\u2019s laying on top of Dan\u2019s arm, his fingers laying into the fuzzy fabric of his sweater. \u201cYou should be able to do what you want to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s pretty ironic.\u201d Dan says with a laugh. \u201cJust this morning, I was giving you the same talk and now you\u2019re sitting here and giving me it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil did have to admit it was pretty ironic, but that didn\u2019t make the situation any less complicated or hurtful for either one of them.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI think I need some time to myself.\u201d Dan said, suddenly standing up. \u201cDo you mind if I\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou can lay down in my bedroom if you\u2019d like.\u201d Phil said, letting his hand fall from Dan\u2019s arm to the counter. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI think I just need a few hours away from social media and from my managers constant nagging and calling.

                "content": "<p><b>Summary</b>: Phil Lester was a worker for the BBC in London. Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood &lsquo;It&rsquo; star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br /></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 2.2k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and mentions of sex&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rating</b>: Mature (for right now)</p><p><b>Updates will be every Wednesday at 4pm and Sunday at 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/42573287/\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a>**</b></p><p>\tFor Phil, clicking publish on his video was, undoubtedly, one of the hardest things he has had to do in a long time. He spent the evening editing the video with Dan watching from the sidelines to get a better look at what editing was really like. And when he was done, he processed it to his YouTube page and waited to publish it.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut now it was ready, he felt his chest tighten. This was a big deal. This was a big deal because this video was the first one he posted in&hellip;6 years? Had it really been that long?&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe was nervous for the comeback.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe was nervous for the comments, the tweets and for everything else that is going to come out when everyone sees Dan in the thumbnail. He was nervous for the queued tweet that he has ready to go saying &ldquo;NOT CLICKBAIT. NEW VIDEO FEATURING DANIEL HOWELL&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan looked at where Phil&rsquo;s finger was poised over the trackpad. &ldquo;Not sure about what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;About posting the video.&rdquo; Phil said, his hand now beginning to shake slightly.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe turned his head and looked at Dan, trying to ignore that he saw a little bit of disappointment behind his eyes. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to post it if you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&hellip;I know.&rdquo; Phil said, his voice quivering. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m just nervous.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looked back at the screen and watched his mouse hover over the button. He shouldn&rsquo;t be this nervous. Maybe if it was just a video of himself, he wouldn&rsquo;t be. But surely just knowing Dan was in the video shouldn&rsquo;t be the only reason why he&rsquo;s nervous?&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe pressed his fingers down and the video went live.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe felt all air escape his lungs and looked over at Dan was smiling. &ldquo;Send me the link and I&rsquo;ll post it on my Twitter.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil quickly copied the link with shaking hands and then sent it to Dan. As soon as Dan tweeted out the link, Phil shut his laptop down and took a few stuttering breaths. He needed to relax and to calm down. There was no point in getting worked up over something that he couldn&rsquo;t really change anymore&hellip;well, he could. But hypothetically he couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe tweeted out the same tweet he had queued in his drafts and then he retweeted Dan&rsquo;s tweet and then sat back, staring at his phone. He shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised at how his name was trending. Nor should he have been surprised at the amount of follow requests he received as well.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe accepted none of them and closed the app, turning off his notifications for Twitter so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to see them.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I have to fly back to LA tomorrow morning.&rdquo; Dan says, out of the blue, as they remained sat on Phil&rsquo;s couch. &ldquo;Filming begins again tomorrow night. I have to catch a plane at half past 6 tomorrow morning.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil couldn&rsquo;t help but feel the pang in his chest from Dan&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;So soon?&rdquo; He found himself asking.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan let out a sigh. &ldquo;Unfortunately.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;Tomorrow I get to film a sex scene.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil quickly turned his head. &ldquo;A sex scene?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nodded. &ldquo;Yes, with Mimei.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;That sounds&hellip;awkward?&rdquo; Phil asked, finding himself chuckle.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s going to be incredibly awkward.&rdquo; Dan said with a loud laugh. &ldquo;Not only is it a sex scene which like, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love having sex, but not staged sex? And even though this is obviously not sex and we&rsquo;ll not be actually fornicating, the thought that I have to go through the motions completely staged is a little bit repulsing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could do it.&rdquo; Phil answered truthfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awkward enough about life in general. I can&rsquo;t imagine having to fake have sex with a person while being filmed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it before.&rdquo; Dan says, his eyes staring straight ahead. &ldquo;It was for an Indie Movie that I did prior to me becoming famous. It was with my ex-boyfriend.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan swallowed and then continued. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t bad? But that could have also been because we were used to having sex anyway so staging it wasn&rsquo;t quite that hard to do.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could ever do it.&rdquo; Phil repeats.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I think it would be less awkward for me if it wasn&rsquo;t with a Mimei.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Like, if it was with a guy, I think I&rsquo;d be better off.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil was a little bit taken back by the openness of this conversation he was having with Dan. He wasn&rsquo;t expecting for Dan to openly be speaking to sex about him. It was a little bit dizzying given all of the circumstances of today.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh same.&rdquo; Phil found himself choking out.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Dan says, a smile playing on his lips.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I just prefer to have sex with guys.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil felt like he was choking on his own air. He was having trouble registering in his mind that he had just come out to Dan. Not directly, but he still kind of did. And it was a big deal. It was a massive deal, actually. Because up until him telling this to Dan, his family and PJ and Sophie were the only ones who knew about his sexuality.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You probably already knew about me.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;And my preference over who I like.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil feels slightly embarrassed and ashamed. He had read about it on Wikipedia, that sensitive information not even hidden from the public, but plastered onto this website with millions of visitors a day.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that you don&rsquo;t get to have privacy anymore.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan shrugs. It&rsquo;s a genuine shrug, not one that is just blowing off what Phil had said. &ldquo;At least my sex tape hasn&rsquo;t been released.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil&rsquo;s eyes bug out of his head and Dan&rsquo;s lets out a loud laugh.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kidding mate. I don&rsquo;t have a sex tape&hellip;or at least I don&rsquo;t think I do.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>***<br /></p><p>\tTo say the video went viral was an understatement by far. Within just the first ten hours, the video already had 3 million views and was growing by the second. News sites were writing stories about the video and about Dan being in it, of course Phil was mentioned as well but a lot more sparingly.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil could see now what it felt like to have people saying your name in every news story or in every twitter mention. He couldn&rsquo;t even keep up with all of the people requesting to follow him so, unwillingly, he unprivated his Twitter and let the follows happen. He went from just under 30k followers to almost 100k in the first three hours. By the next morning, he had nearly 350k followers, all of which were from Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt was overwhelming. He was overwhelmed.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan knew that though. Which is why Dan suggested they order out from some greasy food place and indulge their feelings in some plastic tasting pizza. Phil never ordered Dominos, but he had to admit that it tasted good on his palette and was definitely a comfort food.&nbsp;</p><p>\tSpike already appreciated having bites of sausage given to him as well as he sat on Phil&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;So your video went viral.&rdquo; Dan says, between bites of pizza and whatever dipping sauce he was using. &ldquo;Not gonna lie, didn&rsquo;t quite expect that to happen.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Me neither.&rdquo; Phil answered honestly. &ldquo;My channel is growing and my Twitter is as well. I&rsquo;m scared to go into the comments.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;How did you learn to edit?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe fast change in topic gave Phil a little bit of whiplash but he recovered fast.

He just nods and picks off a piece of pepperoni and hands it to Spike with a sad chuckle.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to think you&rsquo;re whimpering at the secondhand embarrassment but I know you just want more food.&rdquo; Phil whispers, scratching behind Spikes ear. &ldquo;To be fair, I didn&rsquo;t even know what I was going to say anyway.

        "answer": "<p>I think a lot of people fantasize about celebrities or make sexual comments about them privately to their friends and, as weird as that might be for the celebrity to think about, that\u2019s pretty normal. However, I also think the line pretty clearly becomes crossed when you are writing about the sex lives of said celebrities, who are strangers, publicly on blogs and forums, presenting these fantasies as fact. Those posts make me incredibly uncomfortable too and for good reason: sexual harassment should make us uncomfortable, whether it is happening in situations where it has been normalized or not.
