        "body": "<p>Chapter: 2/5</p><p>Words: 3418</p><p>Relationships: Aziraphale/Crowley</p><p>Adam reasons that if Heaven and Hell just got to know each other a bit \nbetter, they wouldn\u2019t be so keen to start another Apocalypse. They \nreally have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has \nevery angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date \nwith whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, \nAziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well\u2026</p><!-- more --><p>Aziraphale\nstood in the park*, waiting for his date to turn up. He had been matched with a\ndemon this time. It cheered him. This was concerning on one level, but\nconsidering the person he got on with best was in fact, a demon, Aziraphale had\nchosen to take it as a good sign.</p><p>*Not\nSt. James. He didn\u2019t quite know <i>why</i>,\nbut to go there with someone other than Crowley just seemed\u2026wrong, somehow.</p><p>After\nall, angels had a habit of being rather stuffy and self-important. Aziraphale\nwould know, being somewhat inclined that way himself, but he knew deep down he\ncould never <i>ever</i> be anywhere near as\nbad as Gabriel. Something about Heaven brought it out in you. It was more than\nenough reason to avoid going Up There on it\u2019s own, not to mention all the other\nwonderful earthly delights it lacked. </p><p>Aziraphale\ndid not want that in a partner. He needed someone who could make light of\nthings, who wouldn\u2019t take everything so very seriously and so very heavily. <br/></p><p>It\nwas something he had always admired about Crowley. Even when the poor dear was\nclearly anxious and suffering, Crowley still had that strange streak of\noptimism, a way of seeing the light in most situations. He never let\nAziraphale wallow for long. Crowley seemed to know exactly when Aziraphale needed to be left alone, and when to show up at the shop and demand to be let in, knowing he\nneeded the company.</p><p>\u00a0A\nloud honking cut through his thoughts. <br/></p><p>It\nwasn\u2019t the low, nearly dignified sounds you hear on cars these days. Oh no.\nThis was a proper wheezing honk, the kind uttered by an old run down hulk that\ncrawled out of a junkyard, coughing smoke and spewing exhaust every which way\nlike the dying throes of some beast. </p><p>There\nwas a sinking sort of dread creeping on the angel as he looked and saw the\nsound was not, in fact, coming from a car, but from a rickety old unicycle. The\nfigure riding it was short, dressed in a battered top hat and a huge overcoat,\nand yes, a demon. <br/></p><p>Oh\ndear.</p><p>The\ndemon hopped down from the unicycle and made his way over. </p><p>He\nstopped short at seeing Aziraphale, actually rocking back on the heels of\nhis overly large shoes. He pointed at the angel, threw his head back, and\nlaughed silently, his whole body shaking with it.</p><p>\u201cE-excuse\nme?\u201d bristled Aziraphale.\u201cJust what is so funny?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon waddled over to him and plucked at Aziraphale\u2019s coat, grinning. \u201cI <i>like</i> this coat*,\u201d said Aziraphale defensively. He\nswatted the demon\u2019s hand away from his bow-tie, \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with a\nbow-tie! You can hardly talk anyway.\u201d</p><p>*The\ncoat in question was perhaps a bit on the old side, but it had been through so\nmuch with the angel, and was so very comfortable that he hadn\u2019t the heart to\nget rid of it. It didn\u2019t show it\u2019s age so very much, really. It simply\u2026was a bit dated\nperhaps. </p><p>The\ndemon plopped himself down on a nearby bench, swinging his short legs happily\nand whistling. Aziraphale bit back a sigh and followed, making absolutely sure\nto check he wasn\u2019t about to sit on anything nefarious before sitting down.</p><p>\u201cYour\nname is Wasco, is that right?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon beamed at him, nodding enthusiastically. <br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nah\u2014\u201d he watched warily as Wasco pulled a long thin balloon out of his pocket.\nHe diligently bent it into the shape of a dog. \u201cEr. Well done,\u201d said\nAziraphale. Wasco handed the dog to him and rummaged though the huge pockets of\nhis coat. He produced a comically large pin. </p><p>Aziraphale only had time to think <i>oh no</i>,\nbefore\u2014 <br/></p><p><i>POP</i></p><p>Little bits of colourful rubber landed around them. A baby in a pram\nnearby started to cry, startled by the noise. Wasco rocked back and forth in\nsilent laughter. </p><p>Well.\nHe had asked for someone with a sense of humor. Perhaps he should have been\nmore specific?</p><p>Aziraphale\nbrushed the bits of balloon off his coat. He thought better of it and miracled\nthem away, not wanting some poor animal to choke on it.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t talk much, do you?\u201d he tried.</p><p>There\nwas a negative honking sound from deep inside the overcoat.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\nHave you, er\u2026are you by any chance familiar with Punch and Judy? Eh&hellip;Charlie\nChaplin? Harpo Marx?\u201d</p><p>Wasco\ngrabbed his hand and shook it wildly.</p><p>\u201cI-I\nthought so.\u201d He yelped as a shock ran through him. The demon\u2019s hand detached\nentirely. Wasco laughed, kicking his short legs. Aziraphale sighed. \u201cVery\nfunny.\u201d He gave the hand back. Wasco promptly jumped up on the bench and hurled\nthe fake hand into the pond, scattering the few ducks still out in the cold.</p><p>Hastily,\nAziraphale miracled the electricity out of the toy before it could do any\ndamage. Wasco frowned at him. \u201cThe ducks wouldn\u2019t have liked that,\u201d defended\nAziraphale. Wasco stuck his tongue out.</p><p>\u201cYou\nhaven\u2019t been up here recently, have you?\u201d <br/></p><p>Wasco\nshook his head. He pointed at the ducks and grinned. They were funny\nlooking creatures. Aziraphale had always liked that about ducks, the way they\nwaddled and quacked and somehow managed to be quite fearsome when the mood\nstruck. <br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nlike it up here though, don\u2019t you?\u201d Wasco nodded happily and sat back down.\n\u201cWhen were you last on earth?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon paused. He sat back on the bench, crossing one arm over his chest and\ncupping his chin in an exaggerated thinking gesture. Then he straightened, and\nturned to Aziraphale.</p><p>Wasco\nheld up a finger and traced it down through the air in an arc, whistling as it\nwent. When it hit the bench he spread his hands apart, mimicking an explosion.</p><p>\u201cOh.\nOh I see.\u201d Likely one of the great wars. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon dug through his pockets and produced a glaringly coloured, polka dotted\nhandkerchief. There was a loud honking sound as he blew his nose obnoxiously.\nHe courteously offered it to the angel.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nno. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Wasco\nshrugged and tossed it over the back of the bench.</p><p>They\nsat in silence for a long minute, Aziraphale struggling to think of something\nto say and Wasco cheerfully rummaging through his huge pockets, ominous\nclanking sounds coming from their depths.</p><p>At\nleast it was a nice day. It was sunny for winter, and warm enough to make an\nouting pleasant. </p><p>Wasco\nturned in his seat, staring over the back of the bench at the busy intersection\nbehind them. Then he raised his finger. He pulled a stick of dynamite out of\nhis coat. The tip began to fizzle.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\nheart skipped a beat as he realized that <i>yes</i>,\nthat was real dynamite, and yes, Wasco drawing his arm back to throw it at the\nintersection.</p><p>He\nonly had a second to act.</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\u201d said Aziraphale. </p><p>The\ndynamite disappeared. Wasco turned to him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cThat\nis <i>not </i>funny, Wasco,\u201d he started lowly, adrenaline turning his voice sharp.\n\u201cThat could have seriously hurt someone! You could have <i>killed</i> all of those people! Is that what you wanted?\u201d The edge of divine wrath had seeped into his voice, making his eyes glow faintly. \u201c I <i>won\u2019t</i> have it. It\u2019s not funny\nif\u2026oh.\u201d </p><p>Wasco\nwas shrinking back from him, visibly frightened. <br/></p><p>Aziraphale deflated. He hadn\u2019t\nmeant to scare the demon that badly. But he couldn\u2019t go around killing people.\nAnd certainly not in Aziraphale\u2019s city. </p><p>The\nangel pursed his lips. Wasco really was only a small little thing. He couldn\u2019t\nhave been much more than an imp. And it was clear he wasn\u2019t intending to be\nmalicious, just\u2026mischievous. </p><p>\u201cHumans\nare fragile,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThey won\u2019t bounce back from something like\nthat.\u201d</p><p>Wasco was still terrified. Aziraphale sighed.</p><p>\u201cOh\ndear. I\u2019m sorry for scaring you.\u201d And then he was suddenly struck with inspiration. \u201cOh? Now, what\u2019s this? There\u2019s something behind your ear\u2026\u201d</p><p>The angel produced a large daisy. Wasco stared at it with huge eyes. Then he broke into a\ndelighted grin.</p><p><i>I knew it would come in handy</i>, thought Aziraphale\nto himself proudly.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>This\ntime, Crowley was paired with an angel. He was feeling tentatively optimistic\nabout it. Aziraphale was an angel, for one, and Crowley considered himself <i>the</i> Aziraphale expert. He was certain he\ncould handle what ever this angel had to throw at him. He couldn\u2019t be much\nworse than Aziraphale on a bad day, could he?</p><p>Crowley\narrived in the courtyard they had agreed to meet at, fifteen minutes early. His\ndate was already there.</p><p>Hasdiel,\nthe angel, was sitting cross-legged on the steps in front of a winged statue,\nhands clasped in prayer, eyes closed. Tears streaked down his face. <br/></p><p>Crowley\nslowed, taking in the angels\u2019 pristine white robes and faint shimmery aura that\nwas just visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Well\nbugger. This one didn\u2019t spend much time on earth, Crowley would bet his custom-made watch on that. </p><p>Still.\nIt could go all right.<br/></p><p>Hasdiel\nopened his eyes. \u201cDemon,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI have prayed unto our Heavenly Father for deliverance from your\nwiles. I shall not be tempted in your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\nHi. Nice one.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nrose to his feet in a graceful shimmery movement. He blinked slowly at Crowley,\nmore tears running down his face. <br/></p><p>\u201cUm.\nAre you\u2014\u201d Crowley gestured at his face, \u201c\u2014all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nfeel the suffering of all beings,\u201d said Hasdiel. \u201cTheir earthly pain expresses\nitself through me. To pray for their souls is my calling.\u201d </p><p><i>Very funny Adam, very funny</i>, thought Crowley wildly. <i>This is what I get for asking for\ncompassion, is it?</i></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026you\ndon\u2019t get out much?\u201d he tried.<br/></p><p>Hasdiel\nblinked at him.</p><p>\u201cLook,\nlet\u2019s start over? I\u2019m Crowley.\u201d He held out his hand. Hasdiel stared at it.\nCrowley took it back awkwardly. \u201cThat\u2019s Ok. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare the serpent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\nYeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d Crowley awkwardly stuck his hands in his pockets. He took\nthem back out again, and wondered what he was supposed to do with them.</p><p>Hasdiel\nwatched him warily, tears still dripping down his face.</p><p>\u201cLook.\nI promise not to hurt you, all right? It\u2019s not my style anyway*. I won\u2019t tempt\nyou. I don\u2019t think Adam would be happy about any of that. It\u2019s not, y\u2019know, the\npoint of this whole\u2014\u201d he waved a hand. \u201cThing. Dating thing, y\u2019know? So don\u2019t\nworry about it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>*Crowley\nhad never physically harmed Aziraphale. The thought actually sickened him. It\nhad been hard enough actively working against him. Not because the angel was\ntoo cunning, Crowley simply\u2026hated seeing Aziraphale upset. Luckily\nAziraphale had been of a similar mind, and even if their formal Arrangement was\nrelatively new, they\u2019d come to an unspoken agreement early on not to doing\nanything intentionally harmful to the other.</p><p>Hasdiel\nsaid: \u201cYou are not what I expected.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed awkwardly. \u201cWell. I\u2019ve been up here about six thousand years. They\u2019ll\nrub off on you, humans.\u201d</p><p>They\nwere still standing at this point, which Crowley thought was a bit ridiculous.\nHe sat down on the step beside the angel slowly, trying not to startle him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\nHasdiel was watching him, curiosity plain on his face. \u201cYou <i>like</i> humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yeah.\u201d\nCrowley shrugged, looking away. \u201cYeah, I do. They\u2019re interesting. You never\nknow what they\u2019ll come up with next.\u201d <br/></p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him like he\u2019d just sprouted another head. Crowley nearly checked just\nto make sure he hadn\u2019t*.</p><p>*Normally\nhe had a very good control of his body, but everyone once in a while there were\nlittle slip-ups. Aziraphale got them too, little slips of the subconscious,\nphysically manifesting in sometimes rather alarming ways. It was bloody\nannoying. <br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\n<i>do</i> feel compassion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\u201d\nCrowley ran a hand through his hair, a blush starting up his cheeks. \u201cMmh. Yea.\nDon\u2019t, um. Spread it around? M\u2019 demon, see? It\u2019s bad for my reputation.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nwas still staring at him as if he\u2019d had some major life-altering epiphany.\nCrowley was all for epiphanies, he just preferred if they didn\u2019t happen to\nother people on his time.</p><p>\u201cLook,\nare you all right?\u201d he tried. \u201cDid you want to get something to eat? That\nusually cheers Aziraphale up.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\njolted, coming back to himself. \u201cAziraphale,\u201d he said, something hard coming\ninto his eyes. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\nknow, Guardian of the Eastern Gate? He\u2019s a frien\u2014er. We run into each other\ndown here. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\nI do not, and I am glad for it. That angel will Fall very soon and join the\nrest of the filth where he belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah,\u201d\nsaid Crowley. And then he realized Hasdiel wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cOh.\u201d His opinion of the angel dropped sharply. </p><p>\u201cCrowley.\u201d\nHasdiel took Crowley\u2019s hand. Crowley nearly flinched back. Azriaphale\u2019s hands\nwere warm and wan, and whenever they had touched it filled Crowley with an\nincredible feeling of comfort, of safety.</p><p>Hasdiel\u2019s\nfingers were feather light and cool, and brought none of the comfort he had\ncome to associate with Aziraphale. </p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d\nsaid Hasdiel levelly, hand tight around his own.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nwhat?\u201d Crowley silently cursed his mind for going right to the gutter.</p><p>\u201cWe\nmust pray for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNhk\u2026what?\nWait, <i>what?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\nsoul is not yet wholly corrupted,\u201d said Hasdiel. \u201cThere is still hope. You can\nstill be returned to the glory of Heaven and to our blessed Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\nwhoa hold on!\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cSurely\nyou want this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201c <br/></p><p>Crowley\ndid lie awake some nights wondering and regretting\u2014but he didn\u2019t miss Heaven.\nFor all he hated Hell, Heaven wasn\u2019t that much better*. And if he did switch\nsides, what where the chances he\u2019d get posted on earth?</p><p>*Especially\nto hear Aziraphale talk about it. Oh they wouldn\u2019t torture you outright. No,\nthat was uncouth. But they had their ways of making you just as sorry as Hell could, Aziraphale had bitterly recounted, deep in his cups. It was a matter of aesthetics. At least Hell had\nthe decency to be upfront about it. </p><p>Earth\nwas where it was at. Earth was his home, it was his <i>side</i>, what he and Aziraphale had fought and nearly died for. Heaven\nand Hell could go bugger off. He wanted no part of their bloody pissing match.</p><p>Crowley\npulled his hand out of the angels\u2019 grip. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve got it wrong. I don\u2019t\nwant to go to Heaven.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him in confusion. \u201cBut you are sullied as you are. Your soul is\nunclean and damned. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t need help. I\u2019m happy as I am, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\ncan you be, burdened by sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\njust am, Ok? It\u2019s different on earth. I can live by my own moral code,\nnot follow any one side blindly.\u201d Crowley was getting increasingly offended.</p><p>\u201cYou\nneed not be afraid,\u201d said Hasdiel, expression benevolent. \u201cIf you bare yourself\nbefore our Holy Father, you can still be saved. You <i>must</i> ask for absolution. He would want that, Crowley.\u2019 <br/></p><p>\u201cWell\n<i>I</i> don\u2019t!\u201d snapped Crowley. \u201cIt\u2019s a Hell of a lot more\ncomplicated than all of that! You think just because you\u2019re an angel and you\nlive in Heaven you\u2019re pure as a daisy\u2014well that\u2019s not how it works! You make\nyour choices everyday with every action\u2014and if you think for one minute we\u2019re\nexempt from it\u2014 you\u2019re wrong! You have to think about what you <i>do</i>, not just do\nwhat you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>Crowley was reeling. Aziraphale had never made him feel as low as this angel had. Aziraphale <i>respected</i> him. He\u2019d never force Crowley to repent. <br/></p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d\nsaid Hasdiel, holding out his hand. Tears glistened on his face. \u201cBe clean\nagain. Leave this filth behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck</i> you!\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nstormed off from the weeping angel, feeling something treacherously like tears\nprickling at his own eyes. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>Sitting\nin his favourite armchair, Aziraphale stared into his mug of cocoa and wondered\nwhy people willingly subjected themselves to dating.</p><p>It\nwas\u2026true, that he\u2019d met some interesting people. Certainly. </p><p>Had\nhe enjoyed himself? No. Not at all.</p><p>He\nsighed. A sense of humor was important. But he\u2019d been hoping for something a\nbit more advanced than slapstick! That should have been a given. There needed\nto be some element of sophistication to it.</p><p>Wasco\nhadn\u2019t understood the difference between a harmless prank and a deadly attack.\nAziraphale needed someone who did. Someone with a strong sense of morality.\nLike Crowley. <br/></p><p>That\nhalted his thoughts in their tracks.</p><p>Crowley\nknew right from wrong. He had <i>always</i>\nknown, Aziraphale realized. And what\u2019s more, he acted on it. Even when it put\nhim in a bad position, Crowley was rarely cruel. He was considerate. He\nbalanced everything excellently, doing his job and performing acts of low-grade\nevil while at the same time avoiding as much actual harm as he could.</p><p>And\nhe knew what lines shouldn\u2019t be crossed. Crowley had never burned a book. He\u2019d<i> stopped</i> book burnings, simply because\nhe knew Aziraphale would be upset by it.</p><p>A\nwarm feeling was building in his chest.</p><p>A\nlow ringing shook him from his thoughts. It was his mobile phone. </p><p>\u201cCrowley!\u201d\nhe said delightedly. \u201cMy dear boy, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAziraphale.\u201d\nIt was nearly a sigh. He sounded tired. The angel frowned. <br/></p><p>\u201cAre\nyou all right? Is something the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026talk\nto me? Please?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, my dear,\u201d said Aziraphale softly, wondering just what had happened to\nput him in such a mood. \u201cWell\u2026how about I tell you something I\u2019ve discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\nWhat did you find?\u201d Crowley\u2019s voice was still exhausted, but there was a note\nof fondness in it now.</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>, my dear, are a shining beacon of\nmorality,\u201d said Aziraphale proudly.</p><p>There\nwas a strangled sound down the line.</p><p>\u201cNo\nno, it\u2019s true. And I won\u2019t be budged on it!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014I\nmust say, though I worry for your ego\u2014you are terribly sophisticated as well. I\nsee that now.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Sophisticated</i>.\u201d Crowley gave a small\nlaugh. \u201cOoh. I like that. Yeah. I am sophisticated, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo-<i>someone</i>. What kind of dates have you\nbeen having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think this last one was much more than an imp. Jittery little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImps\nhave about two brain cells they have to share between the lot of them.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot very nice,\u201d chided Aziraphale. \u201cThough of course I can\u2019t say as much, but I\nthink you may be on to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a bit like dating Harpo Marx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n<i>no</i>. That bad?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAfraid\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor\nsomeone\u2019s sake.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen those films in ages.\u201d<br/>\n Aziraphale made a noise in agreement.\n\u201cToo bad he wasn\u2019t more like Groucho. He was more your style, if I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nwhat can I say? I appreciate someone who can talk circles around everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough\nit was nice to have someone appreciate my magic tricks,\u201d mused Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cOh\nno. I\u2019ve not been neglecting you, have I? You haven\u2019t been carrying a pack of\ncards around all this time, heartbroken, just waiting for me to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>. I\u2019m simply glad I know the skill.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed. It was such a nice sound. Aziraphale pressed his mobile closer to his\near. \u201cAre you feeling any better, my dear?\u201d </p><p>There\nwas a breathy sigh. \u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas my pleasure,\u201d said Aziraphale softly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nnot\u2014<i>thank</i> you. Aziraphale.\nFor\u2026respecting me. As I am. Not\u2014trying to make me something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t see what\u2019s not to like about you,\u201d said Aziraphale hotly, meaning every\nword. Crowley made a small sound down the line. \u201cWhy? Dare I ask what your\ndates have been like?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026How\nabout I tell you later. We\u2019ll get together after this thing is over and drink\nabout it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\ndear, I would like nothing better.\u201d</p><p>There\nwas the sound of paper crinkling. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get this damn quiz done.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\ngrimaced. \u201cYes, me too. Suppose we\u2019d ought to get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe<i>ah</i>.\u201d</p><p>They\nwere both silent for a long moment. Neither wanted to hang up.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\nThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\nYou are very welcome. You know you can call me any time. After all, it\u2019s not\nlike I\u2019ll be sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nCrowley laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the great things about you. You\u2019re dependable.\u201d</p><p>xxx</p><p>Crowley\nfelt much better once he got off the phone with Aziraphale. He usually did. <br/></p><p>\u201cAlright\nAdam,\u201d he said, glaring down at the quiz. \u201cI see how it is.\u201d</p><p>It\ndemanded honesty, but you also had to spell everything out for the damn thing. He\u2019d\nhave to think of it like some bloody-minded contract. </p><p>\u201cCompassionate,\nyes,\u201d said Crowley, bouncing his pen on his leg. \u201cBut they have to be\nopen-minded. Someone who will look past appearances and at least <i>try</i> to get to know me\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSomeone\nsophisticated\u201d, decided Aziraphale, filling out his quiz. \u201cCharming.\u201d The angel\ndrummed his fingers against his desk. <br/></p><p>\u201cAnd an excellent conversationalist\u2026\u201d</p>",

But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, \nAziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well\u2026</p>[[MORE]]<p>Aziraphale\nstood in the park*, waiting for his date to turn up. He had been matched with a\ndemon this time. It cheered him. This was concerning on one level, but\nconsidering the person he got on with best was in fact, a demon, Aziraphale had\nchosen to take it as a good sign.</p><p>*Not\nSt. James. He didn\u2019t quite know <i>why</i>,\nbut to go there with someone other than Crowley just seemed\u2026wrong, somehow.</p><p>After\nall, angels had a habit of being rather stuffy and self-important. Aziraphale\nwould know, being somewhat inclined that way himself, but he knew deep down he\ncould never <i>ever</i> be anywhere near as\nbad as Gabriel. Something about Heaven brought it out in you. It was more than\nenough reason to avoid going Up There on it\u2019s own, not to mention all the other\nwonderful earthly delights it lacked. </p><p>Aziraphale\ndid not want that in a partner. He needed someone who could make light of\nthings, who wouldn\u2019t take everything so very seriously and so very heavily. <br></p><p>It\nwas something he had always admired about Crowley. Even when the poor dear was\nclearly anxious and suffering, Crowley still had that strange streak of\noptimism, a way of seeing the light in most situations. He never let\nAziraphale wallow for long. Crowley seemed to know exactly when Aziraphale needed to be left alone, and when to show up at the shop and demand to be let in, knowing he\nneeded the company.</p><p>\u00a0A\nloud honking cut through his thoughts. <br></p><p>It\nwasn\u2019t the low, nearly dignified sounds you hear on cars these days. Oh no.\nThis was a proper wheezing honk, the kind uttered by an old run down hulk that\ncrawled out of a junkyard, coughing smoke and spewing exhaust every which way\nlike the dying throes of some beast. </p><p>There\nwas a sinking sort of dread creeping on the angel as he looked and saw the\nsound was not, in fact, coming from a car, but from a rickety old unicycle. The\nfigure riding it was short, dressed in a battered top hat and a huge overcoat,\nand yes, a demon. <br></p><p>Oh\ndear.</p><p>The\ndemon hopped down from the unicycle and made his way over. </p><p>He\nstopped short at seeing Aziraphale, actually rocking back on the heels of\nhis overly large shoes. He pointed at the angel, threw his head back, and\nlaughed silently, his whole body shaking with it.</p><p>\u201cE-excuse\nme?\u201d bristled Aziraphale.\u201cJust what is so funny?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon waddled over to him and plucked at Aziraphale\u2019s coat, grinning. \u201cI <i>like</i> this coat*,\u201d said Aziraphale defensively. He\nswatted the demon\u2019s hand away from his bow-tie, \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with a\nbow-tie! You can hardly talk anyway.\u201d</p><p>*The\ncoat in question was perhaps a bit on the old side, but it had been through so\nmuch with the angel, and was so very comfortable that he hadn\u2019t the heart to\nget rid of it. It didn\u2019t show it\u2019s age so very much, really. It simply\u2026was a bit dated\nperhaps. </p><p>The\ndemon plopped himself down on a nearby bench, swinging his short legs happily\nand whistling. Aziraphale bit back a sigh and followed, making absolutely sure\nto check he wasn\u2019t about to sit on anything nefarious before sitting down.</p><p>\u201cYour\nname is Wasco, is that right?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon beamed at him, nodding enthusiastically. <br></p><p>\u201cYou\nah\u2014\u201d he watched warily as Wasco pulled a long thin balloon out of his pocket.\nHe diligently bent it into the shape of a dog. \u201cEr. Well done,\u201d said\nAziraphale. Wasco handed the dog to him and rummaged though the huge pockets of\nhis coat. He produced a comically large pin. </p><p>Aziraphale only had time to think <i>oh no</i>,\nbefore\u2014 <br></p><p><i>POP</i></p><p>Little bits of colourful rubber landed around them. A baby in a pram\nnearby started to cry, startled by the noise. Wasco rocked back and forth in\nsilent laughter. </p><p>Well.\nHe had asked for someone with a sense of humor. Perhaps he should have been\nmore specific?</p><p>Aziraphale\nbrushed the bits of balloon off his coat. He thought better of it and miracled\nthem away, not wanting some poor animal to choke on it.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t talk much, do you?\u201d he tried.</p><p>There\nwas a negative honking sound from deep inside the overcoat.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\nHave you, er\u2026are you by any chance familiar with Punch and Judy? Eh\u2026Charlie\nChaplin? Harpo Marx?\u201d</p><p>Wasco\ngrabbed his hand and shook it wildly.</p><p>\u201cI-I\nthought so.\u201d He yelped as a shock ran through him. The demon\u2019s hand detached\nentirely. Wasco laughed, kicking his short legs. Aziraphale sighed. \u201cVery\nfunny.\u201d He gave the hand back. Wasco promptly jumped up on the bench and hurled\nthe fake hand into the pond, scattering the few ducks still out in the cold.</p><p>Hastily,\nAziraphale miracled the electricity out of the toy before it could do any\ndamage. Wasco frowned at him. \u201cThe ducks wouldn\u2019t have liked that,\u201d defended\nAziraphale. Wasco stuck his tongue out.</p><p>\u201cYou\nhaven\u2019t been up here recently, have you?\u201d <br></p><p>Wasco\nshook his head. He pointed at the ducks and grinned. They were funny\nlooking creatures. Aziraphale had always liked that about ducks, the way they\nwaddled and quacked and somehow managed to be quite fearsome when the mood\nstruck. <br></p><p>\u201cYou\nlike it up here though, don\u2019t you?\u201d Wasco nodded happily and sat back down.\n\u201cWhen were you last on earth?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon paused. He sat back on the bench, crossing one arm over his chest and\ncupping his chin in an exaggerated thinking gesture. Then he straightened, and\nturned to Aziraphale.</p><p>Wasco\nheld up a finger and traced it down through the air in an arc, whistling as it\nwent. When it hit the bench he spread his hands apart, mimicking an explosion.</p><p>\u201cOh.\nOh I see.\u201d Likely one of the great wars. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon dug through his pockets and produced a glaringly coloured, polka dotted\nhandkerchief. There was a loud honking sound as he blew his nose obnoxiously.\nHe courteously offered it to the angel.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nno. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Wasco\nshrugged and tossed it over the back of the bench.</p><p>They\nsat in silence for a long minute, Aziraphale struggling to think of something\nto say and Wasco cheerfully rummaging through his huge pockets, ominous\nclanking sounds coming from their depths.</p><p>At\nleast it was a nice day. It was sunny for winter, and warm enough to make an\nouting pleasant. </p><p>Wasco\nturned in his seat, staring over the back of the bench at the busy intersection\nbehind them. Then he raised his finger. He pulled a stick of dynamite out of\nhis coat. The tip began to fizzle.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\nheart skipped a beat as he realized that <i>yes</i>,\nthat was real dynamite, and yes, Wasco drawing his arm back to throw it at the\nintersection.</p><p>He\nonly had a second to act.</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\u201d said Aziraphale. </p><p>The\ndynamite disappeared. Wasco turned to him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cThat\nis <i>not </i>funny, Wasco,\u201d he started lowly, adrenaline turning his voice sharp.\n\u201cThat could have seriously hurt someone! You could have <i>killed</i> all of those people! Is that what you wanted?\u201d The edge of divine wrath had seeped into his voice, making his eyes glow faintly. \u201c I <i>won\u2019t</i> have it. It\u2019s not funny\nif\u2026oh.\u201d </p><p>Wasco\nwas shrinking back from him, visibly frightened. <br></p><p>Aziraphale deflated. He hadn\u2019t\nmeant to scare the demon that badly. But he couldn\u2019t go around killing people.\nAnd certainly not in Aziraphale\u2019s city. </p><p>The\nangel pursed his lips. Wasco really was only a small little thing. He couldn\u2019t\nhave been much more than an imp. And it was clear he wasn\u2019t intending to be\nmalicious, just\u2026mischievous. </p><p>\u201cHumans\nare fragile,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThey won\u2019t bounce back from something like\nthat.\u201d</p><p>Wasco was still terrified. Aziraphale sighed.</p><p>\u201cOh\ndear. I\u2019m sorry for scaring you.\u201d And then he was suddenly struck with inspiration. \u201cOh? Now, what\u2019s this? There\u2019s something behind your ear\u2026\u201d</p><p>The angel produced a large daisy. Wasco stared at it with huge eyes. Then he broke into a\ndelighted grin.</p><p><i>I knew it would come in handy</i>, thought Aziraphale\nto himself proudly.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>This\ntime, Crowley was paired with an angel. He was feeling tentatively optimistic\nabout it. Aziraphale was an angel, for one, and Crowley considered himself <i>the</i> Aziraphale expert. He was certain he\ncould handle what ever this angel had to throw at him. He couldn\u2019t be much\nworse than Aziraphale on a bad day, could he?</p><p>Crowley\narrived in the courtyard they had agreed to meet at, fifteen minutes early. His\ndate was already there.</p><p>Hasdiel,\nthe angel, was sitting cross-legged on the steps in front of a winged statue,\nhands clasped in prayer, eyes closed. Tears streaked down his face. <br></p><p>Crowley\nslowed, taking in the angels\u2019 pristine white robes and faint shimmery aura that\nwas just visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Well\nbugger. This one didn\u2019t spend much time on earth, Crowley would bet his custom-made watch on that. </p><p>Still.\nIt could go all right.<br></p><p>Hasdiel\nopened his eyes. \u201cDemon,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI have prayed unto our Heavenly Father for deliverance from your\nwiles. I shall not be tempted in your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\nHi. Nice one.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nrose to his feet in a graceful shimmery movement. He blinked slowly at Crowley,\nmore tears running down his face. <br></p><p>\u201cUm.\nAre you\u2014\u201d Crowley gestured at his face, \u201c\u2014all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nfeel the suffering of all beings,\u201d said Hasdiel. \u201cTheir earthly pain expresses\nitself through me. To pray for their souls is my calling.\u201d </p><p><i>Very funny Adam, very funny</i>, thought Crowley wildly. <i>This is what I get for asking for\ncompassion, is it?</i></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026you\ndon\u2019t get out much?\u201d he tried.<br></p><p>Hasdiel\nblinked at him.</p><p>\u201cLook,\nlet\u2019s start over? I\u2019m Crowley.\u201d He held out his hand. Hasdiel stared at it.\nCrowley took it back awkwardly. \u201cThat\u2019s Ok. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare the serpent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\nYeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d Crowley awkwardly stuck his hands in his pockets. He took\nthem back out again, and wondered what he was supposed to do with them.</p><p>Hasdiel\nwatched him warily, tears still dripping down his face.</p><p>\u201cLook.\nI promise not to hurt you, all right? It\u2019s not my style anyway*. I won\u2019t tempt\nyou. I don\u2019t think Adam would be happy about any of that. It\u2019s not, y\u2019know, the\npoint of this whole\u2014\u201d he waved a hand. \u201cThing. Dating thing, y\u2019know? So don\u2019t\nworry about it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>*Crowley\nhad never physically harmed Aziraphale. The thought actually sickened him. It\nhad been hard enough actively working against him. Not because the angel was\ntoo cunning, Crowley simply\u2026hated seeing Aziraphale upset. Luckily\nAziraphale had been of a similar mind, and even if their formal Arrangement was\nrelatively new, they\u2019d come to an unspoken agreement early on not to doing\nanything intentionally harmful to the other.</p><p>Hasdiel\nsaid: \u201cYou are not what I expected.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed awkwardly. \u201cWell. I\u2019ve been up here about six thousand years. They\u2019ll\nrub off on you, humans.\u201d</p><p>They\nwere still standing at this point, which Crowley thought was a bit ridiculous.\nHe sat down on the step beside the angel slowly, trying not to startle him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\nHasdiel was watching him, curiosity plain on his face. \u201cYou <i>like</i> humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yeah.\u201d\nCrowley shrugged, looking away. \u201cYeah, I do. They\u2019re interesting. You never\nknow what they\u2019ll come up with next.\u201d <br></p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him like he\u2019d just sprouted another head. Crowley nearly checked just\nto make sure he hadn\u2019t*.</p><p>*Normally\nhe had a very good control of his body, but everyone once in a while there were\nlittle slip-ups. Aziraphale got them too, little slips of the subconscious,\nphysically manifesting in sometimes rather alarming ways. It was bloody\nannoying. <br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\n<i>do</i> feel compassion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\u201d\nCrowley ran a hand through his hair, a blush starting up his cheeks. \u201cMmh. Yea.\nDon\u2019t, um. Spread it around? M\u2019 demon, see? It\u2019s bad for my reputation.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nwas still staring at him as if he\u2019d had some major life-altering epiphany.\nCrowley was all for epiphanies, he just preferred if they didn\u2019t happen to\nother people on his time.</p><p>\u201cLook,\nare you all right?\u201d he tried. \u201cDid you want to get something to eat? That\nusually cheers Aziraphale up.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\njolted, coming back to himself. \u201cAziraphale,\u201d he said, something hard coming\ninto his eyes. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\nknow, Guardian of the Eastern Gate? He\u2019s a frien\u2014er. We run into each other\ndown here. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\nI do not, and I am glad for it. That angel will Fall very soon and join the\nrest of the filth where he belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah,\u201d\nsaid Crowley. And then he realized Hasdiel wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cOh.\u201d His opinion of the angel dropped sharply. </p><p>\u201cCrowley.\u201d\nHasdiel took Crowley\u2019s hand. Crowley nearly flinched back. Azriaphale\u2019s hands\nwere warm and wan, and whenever they had touched it filled Crowley with an\nincredible feeling of comfort, of safety.</p><p>Hasdiel\u2019s\nfingers were feather light and cool, and brought none of the comfort he had\ncome to associate with Aziraphale. </p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d\nsaid Hasdiel levelly, hand tight around his own.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nwhat?\u201d Crowley silently cursed his mind for going right to the gutter.</p><p>\u201cWe\nmust pray for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNhk\u2026what?\nWait, <i>what?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\nsoul is not yet wholly corrupted,\u201d said Hasdiel. \u201cThere is still hope. You can\nstill be returned to the glory of Heaven and to our blessed Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\nwhoa hold on!\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cSurely\nyou want this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201c <br></p><p>Crowley\ndid lie awake some nights wondering and regretting\u2014but he didn\u2019t miss Heaven.\nFor all he hated Hell, Heaven wasn\u2019t that much better*. And if he did switch\nsides, what where the chances he\u2019d get posted on earth?</p><p>*Especially\nto hear Aziraphale talk about it. Oh they wouldn\u2019t torture you outright. No,\nthat was uncouth. But they had their ways of making you just as sorry as Hell could, Aziraphale had bitterly recounted, deep in his cups. It was a matter of aesthetics. At least Hell had\nthe decency to be upfront about it. </p><p>Earth\nwas where it was at. Earth was his home, it was his <i>side</i>, what he and Aziraphale had fought and nearly died for. Heaven\nand Hell could go bugger off. He wanted no part of their bloody pissing match.</p><p>Crowley\npulled his hand out of the angels\u2019 grip. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve got it wrong. I don\u2019t\nwant to go to Heaven.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him in confusion. \u201cBut you are sullied as you are. Your soul is\nunclean and damned. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t need help. I\u2019m happy as I am, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\ncan you be, burdened by sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\njust am, Ok? It\u2019s different on earth. I can live by my own moral code,\nnot follow any one side blindly.\u201d Crowley was getting increasingly offended.</p><p>\u201cYou\nneed not be afraid,\u201d said Hasdiel, expression benevolent. \u201cIf you bare yourself\nbefore our Holy Father, you can still be saved. You <i>must</i> ask for absolution. He would want that, Crowley.\u2019 <br></p><p>\u201cWell\n<i>I</i> don\u2019t!\u201d snapped Crowley. \u201cIt\u2019s a Hell of a lot more\ncomplicated than all of that! You think just because you\u2019re an angel and you\nlive in Heaven you\u2019re pure as a daisy\u2014well that\u2019s not how it works! You make\nyour choices everyday with every action\u2014and if you think for one minute we\u2019re\nexempt from it\u2014 you\u2019re wrong! You have to think about what you <i>do</i>, not just do\nwhat you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>Crowley was reeling. Aziraphale had never made him feel as low as this angel had. Aziraphale <i>respected</i> him. He\u2019d never force Crowley to repent. <br></p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d\nsaid Hasdiel, holding out his hand. Tears glistened on his face. \u201cBe clean\nagain. Leave this filth behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck</i> you!\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nstormed off from the weeping angel, feeling something treacherously like tears\nprickling at his own eyes. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>Sitting\nin his favourite armchair, Aziraphale stared into his mug of cocoa and wondered\nwhy people willingly subjected themselves to dating.</p><p>It\nwas\u2026true, that he\u2019d met some interesting people. Certainly. </p><p>Had\nhe enjoyed himself? No. Not at all.</p><p>He\nsighed. A sense of humor was important. But he\u2019d been hoping for something a\nbit more advanced than slapstick! That should have been a given. There needed\nto be some element of sophistication to it.</p><p>Wasco\nhadn\u2019t understood the difference between a harmless prank and a deadly attack.\nAziraphale needed someone who did. Someone with a strong sense of morality.\nLike Crowley. <br></p><p>That\nhalted his thoughts in their tracks.</p><p>Crowley\nknew right from wrong. He had <i>always</i>\nknown, Aziraphale realized. And what\u2019s more, he acted on it. Even when it put\nhim in a bad position, Crowley was rarely cruel. He was considerate. He\nbalanced everything excellently, doing his job and performing acts of low-grade\nevil while at the same time avoiding as much actual harm as he could.</p><p>And\nhe knew what lines shouldn\u2019t be crossed. Crowley had never burned a book. He\u2019d<i> stopped</i> book burnings, simply because\nhe knew Aziraphale would be upset by it.</p><p>A\nwarm feeling was building in his chest.</p><p>A\nlow ringing shook him from his thoughts. It was his mobile phone. </p><p>\u201cCrowley!\u201d\nhe said delightedly. \u201cMy dear boy, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAziraphale.\u201d\nIt was nearly a sigh. He sounded tired. The angel frowned. <br></p><p>\u201cAre\nyou all right? Is something the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026talk\nto me? Please?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, my dear,\u201d said Aziraphale softly, wondering just what had happened to\nput him in such a mood. \u201cWell\u2026how about I tell you something I\u2019ve discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\nWhat did you find?\u201d Crowley\u2019s voice was still exhausted, but there was a note\nof fondness in it now.</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>, my dear, are a shining beacon of\nmorality,\u201d said Aziraphale proudly.</p><p>There\nwas a strangled sound down the line.</p><p>\u201cNo\nno, it\u2019s true. And I won\u2019t be budged on it!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014I\nmust say, though I worry for your ego\u2014you are terribly sophisticated as well. I\nsee that now.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201c<i>Sophisticated</i>.\u201d Crowley gave a small\nlaugh. \u201cOoh. I like that. Yeah. I am sophisticated, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo-<i>someone</i>. What kind of dates have you\nbeen having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think this last one was much more than an imp. Jittery little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImps\nhave about two brain cells they have to share between the lot of them.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot very nice,\u201d chided Aziraphale. \u201cThough of course I can\u2019t say as much, but I\nthink you may be on to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a bit like dating Harpo Marx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n<i>no</i>. That bad?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAfraid\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor\nsomeone\u2019s sake.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen those films in ages.\u201d<br>\n Aziraphale made a noise in agreement.\n\u201cToo bad he wasn\u2019t more like Groucho. He was more your style, if I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nwhat can I say? I appreciate someone who can talk circles around everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough\nit was nice to have someone appreciate my magic tricks,\u201d mused Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cOh\nno. I\u2019ve not been neglecting you, have I? You haven\u2019t been carrying a pack of\ncards around all this time, heartbroken, just waiting for me to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>. I\u2019m simply glad I know the skill.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed. It was such a nice sound. Aziraphale pressed his mobile closer to his\near. \u201cAre you feeling any better, my dear?\u201d </p><p>There\nwas a breathy sigh. \u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas my pleasure,\u201d said Aziraphale softly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nnot\u2014<i>thank</i> you. Aziraphale.\nFor\u2026respecting me. As I am. Not\u2014trying to make me something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t see what\u2019s not to like about you,\u201d said Aziraphale hotly, meaning every\nword. Crowley made a small sound down the line. \u201cWhy? Dare I ask what your\ndates have been like?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026How\nabout I tell you later. We\u2019ll get together after this thing is over and drink\nabout it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\ndear, I would like nothing better.\u201d</p><p>There\nwas the sound of paper crinkling. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get this damn quiz done.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\ngrimaced. \u201cYes, me too. Suppose we\u2019d ought to get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe<i>ah</i>.\u201d</p><p>They\nwere both silent for a long moment. Neither wanted to hang up.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\nThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\nYou are very welcome. You know you can call me any time. After all, it\u2019s not\nlike I\u2019ll be sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nCrowley laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the great things about you. You\u2019re dependable.\u201d</p><p>xxx</p><p>Crowley\nfelt much better once he got off the phone with Aziraphale. He usually did. <br></p><p>\u201cAlright\nAdam,\u201d he said, glaring down at the quiz. \u201cI see how it is.\u201d</p><p>It\ndemanded honesty, but you also had to spell everything out for the damn thing. He\u2019d\nhave to think of it like some bloody-minded contract. </p><p>\u201cCompassionate,\nyes,\u201d said Crowley, bouncing his pen on his leg. \u201cBut they have to be\nopen-minded. Someone who will look past appearances and at least <i>try</i> to get to know me\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSomeone\nsophisticated\u201d, decided Aziraphale, filling out his quiz. \u201cCharming.\u201d The angel\ndrummed his fingers against his desk. <br></p><p>\u201cAnd an excellent conversationalist\u2026\u201d</p>",

They \nreally have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has \nevery angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date \nwith whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, \nAziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well\u2026</p>[[MORE]]<p>Aziraphale\nstood in the park*, waiting for his date to turn up. He had been matched with a\ndemon this time. It cheered him. This was concerning on one level, but\nconsidering the person he got on with best was in fact, a demon, Aziraphale had\nchosen to take it as a good sign.</p><p>*Not\nSt. James. He didn\u2019t quite know <i>why</i>,\nbut to go there with someone other than Crowley just seemed\u2026wrong, somehow.</p><p>After\nall, angels had a habit of being rather stuffy and self-important. Aziraphale\nwould know, being somewhat inclined that way himself, but he knew deep down he\ncould never <i>ever</i> be anywhere near as\nbad as Gabriel. Something about Heaven brought it out in you. It was more than\nenough reason to avoid going Up There on it\u2019s own, not to mention all the other\nwonderful earthly delights it lacked. </p><p>Aziraphale\ndid not want that in a partner. He needed someone who could make light of\nthings, who wouldn\u2019t take everything so very seriously and so very heavily. <br></p><p>It\nwas something he had always admired about Crowley. Even when the poor dear was\nclearly anxious and suffering, Crowley still had that strange streak of\noptimism, a way of seeing the light in most situations. He never let\nAziraphale wallow for long. Crowley seemed to know exactly when Aziraphale needed to be left alone, and when to show up at the shop and demand to be let in, knowing he\nneeded the company.</p><p>\u00a0A\nloud honking cut through his thoughts. <br></p><p>It\nwasn\u2019t the low, nearly dignified sounds you hear on cars these days. Oh no.\nThis was a proper wheezing honk, the kind uttered by an old run down hulk that\ncrawled out of a junkyard, coughing smoke and spewing exhaust every which way\nlike the dying throes of some beast. </p><p>There\nwas a sinking sort of dread creeping on the angel as he looked and saw the\nsound was not, in fact, coming from a car, but from a rickety old unicycle. The\nfigure riding it was short, dressed in a battered top hat and a huge overcoat,\nand yes, a demon. <br></p><p>Oh\ndear.</p><p>The\ndemon hopped down from the unicycle and made his way over. </p><p>He\nstopped short at seeing Aziraphale, actually rocking back on the heels of\nhis overly large shoes. He pointed at the angel, threw his head back, and\nlaughed silently, his whole body shaking with it.</p><p>\u201cE-excuse\nme?\u201d bristled Aziraphale.\u201cJust what is so funny?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon waddled over to him and plucked at Aziraphale\u2019s coat, grinning. \u201cI <i>like</i> this coat*,\u201d said Aziraphale defensively. He\nswatted the demon\u2019s hand away from his bow-tie, \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with a\nbow-tie! You can hardly talk anyway.\u201d</p><p>*The\ncoat in question was perhaps a bit on the old side, but it had been through so\nmuch with the angel, and was so very comfortable that he hadn\u2019t the heart to\nget rid of it. It didn\u2019t show it\u2019s age so very much, really. It simply\u2026was a bit dated\nperhaps. </p><p>The\ndemon plopped himself down on a nearby bench, swinging his short legs happily\nand whistling. Aziraphale bit back a sigh and followed, making absolutely sure\nto check he wasn\u2019t about to sit on anything nefarious before sitting down.</p><p>\u201cYour\nname is Wasco, is that right?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon beamed at him, nodding enthusiastically. <br></p><p>\u201cYou\nah\u2014\u201d he watched warily as Wasco pulled a long thin balloon out of his pocket.\nHe diligently bent it into the shape of a dog. \u201cEr. Well done,\u201d said\nAziraphale. Wasco handed the dog to him and rummaged though the huge pockets of\nhis coat. He produced a comically large pin. </p><p>Aziraphale only had time to think <i>oh no</i>,\nbefore\u2014 <br></p><p><i>POP</i></p><p>Little bits of colourful rubber landed around them. A baby in a pram\nnearby started to cry, startled by the noise. Wasco rocked back and forth in\nsilent laughter. </p><p>Well.\nHe had asked for someone with a sense of humor. Perhaps he should have been\nmore specific?</p><p>Aziraphale\nbrushed the bits of balloon off his coat. He thought better of it and miracled\nthem away, not wanting some poor animal to choke on it.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t talk much, do you?\u201d he tried.</p><p>There\nwas a negative honking sound from deep inside the overcoat.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\nHave you, er\u2026are you by any chance familiar with Punch and Judy? Eh\u2026Charlie\nChaplin? Harpo Marx?\u201d</p><p>Wasco\ngrabbed his hand and shook it wildly.</p><p>\u201cI-I\nthought so.\u201d He yelped as a shock ran through him. The demon\u2019s hand detached\nentirely. Wasco laughed, kicking his short legs. Aziraphale sighed. \u201cVery\nfunny.\u201d He gave the hand back. Wasco promptly jumped up on the bench and hurled\nthe fake hand into the pond, scattering the few ducks still out in the cold.</p><p>Hastily,\nAziraphale miracled the electricity out of the toy before it could do any\ndamage. Wasco frowned at him. \u201cThe ducks wouldn\u2019t have liked that,\u201d defended\nAziraphale. Wasco stuck his tongue out.</p><p>\u201cYou\nhaven\u2019t been up here recently, have you?\u201d <br></p><p>Wasco\nshook his head. He pointed at the ducks and grinned. They were funny\nlooking creatures. Aziraphale had always liked that about ducks, the way they\nwaddled and quacked and somehow managed to be quite fearsome when the mood\nstruck. <br></p><p>\u201cYou\nlike it up here though, don\u2019t you?\u201d Wasco nodded happily and sat back down.\n\u201cWhen were you last on earth?\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon paused. He sat back on the bench, crossing one arm over his chest and\ncupping his chin in an exaggerated thinking gesture. Then he straightened, and\nturned to Aziraphale.</p><p>Wasco\nheld up a finger and traced it down through the air in an arc, whistling as it\nwent. When it hit the bench he spread his hands apart, mimicking an explosion.</p><p>\u201cOh.\nOh I see.\u201d Likely one of the great wars. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The\ndemon dug through his pockets and produced a glaringly coloured, polka dotted\nhandkerchief. There was a loud honking sound as he blew his nose obnoxiously.\nHe courteously offered it to the angel.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nno. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Wasco\nshrugged and tossed it over the back of the bench.</p><p>They\nsat in silence for a long minute, Aziraphale struggling to think of something\nto say and Wasco cheerfully rummaging through his huge pockets, ominous\nclanking sounds coming from their depths.</p><p>At\nleast it was a nice day. It was sunny for winter, and warm enough to make an\nouting pleasant. </p><p>Wasco\nturned in his seat, staring over the back of the bench at the busy intersection\nbehind them. Then he raised his finger. He pulled a stick of dynamite out of\nhis coat. The tip began to fizzle.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\nheart skipped a beat as he realized that <i>yes</i>,\nthat was real dynamite, and yes, Wasco drawing his arm back to throw it at the\nintersection.</p><p>He\nonly had a second to act.</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\u201d said Aziraphale. </p><p>The\ndynamite disappeared. Wasco turned to him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cThat\nis <i>not </i>funny, Wasco,\u201d he started lowly, adrenaline turning his voice sharp.\n\u201cThat could have seriously hurt someone! You could have <i>killed</i> all of those people! Is that what you wanted?\u201d The edge of divine wrath had seeped into his voice, making his eyes glow faintly. \u201c I <i>won\u2019t</i> have it. It\u2019s not funny\nif\u2026oh.\u201d </p><p>Wasco\nwas shrinking back from him, visibly frightened. <br></p><p>Aziraphale deflated. He hadn\u2019t\nmeant to scare the demon that badly. But he couldn\u2019t go around killing people.\nAnd certainly not in Aziraphale\u2019s city. </p><p>The\nangel pursed his lips. Wasco really was only a small little thing. He couldn\u2019t\nhave been much more than an imp. And it was clear he wasn\u2019t intending to be\nmalicious, just\u2026mischievous. </p><p>\u201cHumans\nare fragile,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThey won\u2019t bounce back from something like\nthat.\u201d</p><p>Wasco was still terrified. Aziraphale sighed.</p><p>\u201cOh\ndear. I\u2019m sorry for scaring you.\u201d And then he was suddenly struck with inspiration. \u201cOh? Now, what\u2019s this? There\u2019s something behind your ear\u2026\u201d</p><p>The angel produced a large daisy. Wasco stared at it with huge eyes. Then he broke into a\ndelighted grin.</p><p><i>I knew it would come in handy</i>, thought Aziraphale\nto himself proudly.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>This\ntime, Crowley was paired with an angel. He was feeling tentatively optimistic\nabout it. Aziraphale was an angel, for one, and Crowley considered himself <i>the</i> Aziraphale expert. He was certain he\ncould handle what ever this angel had to throw at him. He couldn\u2019t be much\nworse than Aziraphale on a bad day, could he?</p><p>Crowley\narrived in the courtyard they had agreed to meet at, fifteen minutes early. His\ndate was already there.</p><p>Hasdiel,\nthe angel, was sitting cross-legged on the steps in front of a winged statue,\nhands clasped in prayer, eyes closed. Tears streaked down his face. <br></p><p>Crowley\nslowed, taking in the angels\u2019 pristine white robes and faint shimmery aura that\nwas just visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Well\nbugger. This one didn\u2019t spend much time on earth, Crowley would bet his custom-made watch on that. </p><p>Still.\nIt could go all right.<br></p><p>Hasdiel\nopened his eyes. \u201cDemon,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI have prayed unto our Heavenly Father for deliverance from your\nwiles. I shall not be tempted in your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\nHi. Nice one.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nrose to his feet in a graceful shimmery movement. He blinked slowly at Crowley,\nmore tears running down his face. <br></p><p>\u201cUm.\nAre you\u2014\u201d Crowley gestured at his face, \u201c\u2014all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nfeel the suffering of all beings,\u201d said Hasdiel. \u201cTheir earthly pain expresses\nitself through me. To pray for their souls is my calling.\u201d </p><p><i>Very funny Adam, very funny</i>, thought Crowley wildly. <i>This is what I get for asking for\ncompassion, is it?</i></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026you\ndon\u2019t get out much?\u201d he tried.<br></p><p>Hasdiel\nblinked at him.</p><p>\u201cLook,\nlet\u2019s start over? I\u2019m Crowley.\u201d He held out his hand. Hasdiel stared at it.\nCrowley took it back awkwardly. \u201cThat\u2019s Ok. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare the serpent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\nYeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d Crowley awkwardly stuck his hands in his pockets. He took\nthem back out again, and wondered what he was supposed to do with them.</p><p>Hasdiel\nwatched him warily, tears still dripping down his face.</p><p>\u201cLook.\nI promise not to hurt you, all right? It\u2019s not my style anyway*. I won\u2019t tempt\nyou. I don\u2019t think Adam would be happy about any of that. It\u2019s not, y\u2019know, the\npoint of this whole\u2014\u201d he waved a hand. \u201cThing. Dating thing, y\u2019know? So don\u2019t\nworry about it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>*Crowley\nhad never physically harmed Aziraphale. The thought actually sickened him. It\nhad been hard enough actively working against him. Not because the angel was\ntoo cunning, Crowley simply\u2026hated seeing Aziraphale upset. Luckily\nAziraphale had been of a similar mind, and even if their formal Arrangement was\nrelatively new, they\u2019d come to an unspoken agreement early on not to doing\nanything intentionally harmful to the other.</p><p>Hasdiel\nsaid: \u201cYou are not what I expected.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed awkwardly. \u201cWell. I\u2019ve been up here about six thousand years. They\u2019ll\nrub off on you, humans.\u201d</p><p>They\nwere still standing at this point, which Crowley thought was a bit ridiculous.\nHe sat down on the step beside the angel slowly, trying not to startle him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\nHasdiel was watching him, curiosity plain on his face. \u201cYou <i>like</i> humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yeah.\u201d\nCrowley shrugged, looking away. \u201cYeah, I do. They\u2019re interesting. You never\nknow what they\u2019ll come up with next.\u201d <br></p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him like he\u2019d just sprouted another head. Crowley nearly checked just\nto make sure he hadn\u2019t*.</p><p>*Normally\nhe had a very good control of his body, but everyone once in a while there were\nlittle slip-ups. Aziraphale got them too, little slips of the subconscious,\nphysically manifesting in sometimes rather alarming ways. It was bloody\nannoying. <br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\n<i>do</i> feel compassion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr.\u201d\nCrowley ran a hand through his hair, a blush starting up his cheeks. \u201cMmh. Yea.\nDon\u2019t, um. Spread it around? M\u2019 demon, see? It\u2019s bad for my reputation.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nwas still staring at him as if he\u2019d had some major life-altering epiphany.\nCrowley was all for epiphanies, he just preferred if they didn\u2019t happen to\nother people on his time.</p><p>\u201cLook,\nare you all right?\u201d he tried. \u201cDid you want to get something to eat? That\nusually cheers Aziraphale up.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\njolted, coming back to himself. \u201cAziraphale,\u201d he said, something hard coming\ninto his eyes. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\nknow, Guardian of the Eastern Gate? He\u2019s a frien\u2014er. We run into each other\ndown here. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\nI do not, and I am glad for it. That angel will Fall very soon and join the\nrest of the filth where he belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah,\u201d\nsaid Crowley. And then he realized Hasdiel wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cOh.\u201d His opinion of the angel dropped sharply. </p><p>\u201cCrowley.\u201d\nHasdiel took Crowley\u2019s hand. Crowley nearly flinched back. Azriaphale\u2019s hands\nwere warm and wan, and whenever they had touched it filled Crowley with an\nincredible feeling of comfort, of safety.</p><p>Hasdiel\u2019s\nfingers were feather light and cool, and brought none of the comfort he had\ncome to associate with Aziraphale. </p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d\nsaid Hasdiel levelly, hand tight around his own.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nwhat?\u201d Crowley silently cursed his mind for going right to the gutter.</p><p>\u201cWe\nmust pray for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNhk\u2026what?\nWait, <i>what?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\nsoul is not yet wholly corrupted,\u201d said Hasdiel. \u201cThere is still hope. You can\nstill be returned to the glory of Heaven and to our blessed Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\nwhoa hold on!\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cSurely\nyou want this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201c <br></p><p>Crowley\ndid lie awake some nights wondering and regretting\u2014but he didn\u2019t miss Heaven.\nFor all he hated Hell, Heaven wasn\u2019t that much better*. And if he did switch\nsides, what where the chances he\u2019d get posted on earth?</p><p>*Especially\nto hear Aziraphale talk about it. Oh they wouldn\u2019t torture you outright. No,\nthat was uncouth. But they had their ways of making you just as sorry as Hell could, Aziraphale had bitterly recounted, deep in his cups. It was a matter of aesthetics. At least Hell had\nthe decency to be upfront about it. </p><p>Earth\nwas where it was at. Earth was his home, it was his <i>side</i>, what he and Aziraphale had fought and nearly died for. Heaven\nand Hell could go bugger off. He wanted no part of their bloody pissing match.</p><p>Crowley\npulled his hand out of the angels\u2019 grip. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve got it wrong. I don\u2019t\nwant to go to Heaven.\u201d</p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him in confusion. \u201cBut you are sullied as you are. Your soul is\nunclean and damned. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t need help. I\u2019m happy as I am, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\ncan you be, burdened by sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\njust am, Ok? It\u2019s different on earth. I can live by my own moral code,\nnot follow any one side blindly.\u201d Crowley was getting increasingly offended.</p><p>\u201cYou\nneed not be afraid,\u201d said Hasdiel, expression benevolent. \u201cIf you bare yourself\nbefore our Holy Father, you can still be saved. You <i>must</i> ask for absolution. He would want that, Crowley.\u2019 <br></p><p>\u201cWell\n<i>I</i> don\u2019t!\u201d snapped Crowley. \u201cIt\u2019s a Hell of a lot more\ncomplicated than all of that! You think just because you\u2019re an angel and you\nlive in Heaven you\u2019re pure as a daisy\u2014well that\u2019s not how it works! You make\nyour choices everyday with every action\u2014and if you think for one minute we\u2019re\nexempt from it\u2014 you\u2019re wrong! You have to think about what you <i>do</i>, not just do\nwhat you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>Crowley was reeling. Aziraphale had never made him feel as low as this angel had. Aziraphale <i>respected</i> him. He\u2019d never force Crowley to repent. <br></p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d\nsaid Hasdiel, holding out his hand. Tears glistened on his face. \u201cBe clean\nagain. Leave this filth behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Fuck</i> you!\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nstormed off from the weeping angel, feeling something treacherously like tears\nprickling at his own eyes. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>Sitting\nin his favourite armchair, Aziraphale stared into his mug of cocoa and wondered\nwhy people willingly subjected themselves to dating.</p><p>It\nwas\u2026true, that he\u2019d met some interesting people. Certainly. </p><p>Had\nhe enjoyed himself? No. Not at all.</p><p>He\nsighed. A sense of humor was important. But he\u2019d been hoping for something a\nbit more advanced than slapstick! That should have been a given. There needed\nto be some element of sophistication to it.</p><p>Wasco\nhadn\u2019t understood the difference between a harmless prank and a deadly attack.\nAziraphale needed someone who did. Someone with a strong sense of morality.\nLike Crowley. <br></p><p>That\nhalted his thoughts in their tracks.</p><p>Crowley\nknew right from wrong. He had <i>always</i>\nknown, Aziraphale realized. And what\u2019s more, he acted on it. Even when it put\nhim in a bad position, Crowley was rarely cruel. He was considerate. He\nbalanced everything excellently, doing his job and performing acts of low-grade\nevil while at the same time avoiding as much actual harm as he could.</p><p>And\nhe knew what lines shouldn\u2019t be crossed. Crowley had never burned a book. He\u2019d<i> stopped</i> book burnings, simply because\nhe knew Aziraphale would be upset by it.</p><p>A\nwarm feeling was building in his chest.</p><p>A\nlow ringing shook him from his thoughts. It was his mobile phone. </p><p>\u201cCrowley!\u201d\nhe said delightedly. \u201cMy dear boy, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAziraphale.\u201d\nIt was nearly a sigh. He sounded tired. The angel frowned. <br></p><p>\u201cAre\nyou all right? Is something the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026talk\nto me? Please?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, my dear,\u201d said Aziraphale softly, wondering just what had happened to\nput him in such a mood. \u201cWell\u2026how about I tell you something I\u2019ve discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\nWhat did you find?\u201d Crowley\u2019s voice was still exhausted, but there was a note\nof fondness in it now.</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>, my dear, are a shining beacon of\nmorality,\u201d said Aziraphale proudly.</p><p>There\nwas a strangled sound down the line.</p><p>\u201cNo\nno, it\u2019s true. And I won\u2019t be budged on it!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014I\nmust say, though I worry for your ego\u2014you are terribly sophisticated as well. I\nsee that now.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201c<i>Sophisticated</i>.\u201d Crowley gave a small\nlaugh. \u201cOoh. I like that. Yeah. I am sophisticated, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo-<i>someone</i>. What kind of dates have you\nbeen having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think this last one was much more than an imp. Jittery little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImps\nhave about two brain cells they have to share between the lot of them.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot very nice,\u201d chided Aziraphale. \u201cThough of course I can\u2019t say as much, but I\nthink you may be on to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas a bit like dating Harpo Marx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n<i>no</i>. That bad?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAfraid\nso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor\nsomeone\u2019s sake.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen those films in ages.\u201d<br>\n Aziraphale made a noise in agreement.\n\u201cToo bad he wasn\u2019t more like Groucho. He was more your style, if I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nwhat can I say? I appreciate someone who can talk circles around everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough\nit was nice to have someone appreciate my magic tricks,\u201d mused Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cOh\nno. I\u2019ve not been neglecting you, have I? You haven\u2019t been carrying a pack of\ncards around all this time, heartbroken, just waiting for me to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>. I\u2019m simply glad I know the skill.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed. It was such a nice sound. Aziraphale pressed his mobile closer to his\near. \u201cAre you feeling any better, my dear?\u201d </p><p>There\nwas a breathy sigh. \u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas my pleasure,\u201d said Aziraphale softly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nnot\u2014<i>thank</i> you. Aziraphale.\nFor\u2026respecting me. As I am. Not\u2014trying to make me something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t see what\u2019s not to like about you,\u201d said Aziraphale hotly, meaning every\nword. Crowley made a small sound down the line. \u201cWhy? Dare I ask what your\ndates have been like?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026How\nabout I tell you later. We\u2019ll get together after this thing is over and drink\nabout it, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\ndear, I would like nothing better.\u201d</p><p>There\nwas the sound of paper crinkling. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get this damn quiz done.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\ngrimaced. \u201cYes, me too. Suppose we\u2019d ought to get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe<i>ah</i>.\u201d</p><p>They\nwere both silent for a long moment. Neither wanted to hang up.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\nThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley.\nYou are very welcome. You know you can call me any time. After all, it\u2019s not\nlike I\u2019ll be sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nCrowley laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the great things about you. You\u2019re dependable.\u201d</p><p>xxx</p><p>Crowley\nfelt much better once he got off the phone with Aziraphale. He usually did. <br></p><p>\u201cAlright\nAdam,\u201d he said, glaring down at the quiz. \u201cI see how it is.\u201d</p><p>It\ndemanded honesty, but you also had to spell everything out for the damn thing. He\u2019d\nhave to think of it like some bloody-minded contract. </p><p>\u201cCompassionate,\nyes,\u201d said Crowley, bouncing his pen on his leg. \u201cBut they have to be\nopen-minded. Someone who will look past appearances and at least <i>try</i> to get to know me\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>\u201cSomeone\nsophisticated\u201d, decided Aziraphale, filling out his quiz. \u201cCharming.\u201d The angel\ndrummed his fingers against his desk. <br></p><p>\u201cAnd an excellent conversationalist\u2026\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p>Chapter: 2/5</p><p>Words: 3418</p><p>Relationships: Aziraphale/Crowley</p><p>Adam reasons that if Heaven and Hell just got to know each other a bit \nbetter, they wouldn&rsquo;t be so keen to start another Apocalypse. They \nreally have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has \nevery angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date \nwith whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have \nto do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, \nAziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well&hellip;</p><p>Aziraphale\nstood in the park*, waiting for his date to turn up. He had been matched with a\ndemon this time. It cheered him. This was concerning on one level, but\nconsidering the person he got on with best was in fact, a demon, Aziraphale had\nchosen to take it as a good sign.</p><p>*Not\nSt. James. He didn&rsquo;t quite know <i>why</i>,\nbut to go there with someone other than Crowley just seemed&hellip;wrong, somehow.</p><p>After\nall, angels had a habit of being rather stuffy and self-important. Aziraphale\nwould know, being somewhat inclined that way himself, but he knew deep down he\ncould never <i>ever</i> be anywhere near as\nbad as Gabriel. Something about Heaven brought it out in you. It was more than\nenough reason to avoid going Up There on it&rsquo;s own, not to mention all the other\nwonderful earthly delights it lacked. </p><p>Aziraphale\ndid not want that in a partner. He needed someone who could make light of\nthings, who wouldn&rsquo;t take everything so very seriously and so very heavily. <br /></p><p>It\nwas something he had always admired about Crowley. Even when the poor dear was\nclearly anxious and suffering, Crowley still had that strange streak of\noptimism, a way of seeing the light in most situations. He never let\nAziraphale wallow for long. Crowley seemed to know exactly when Aziraphale needed to be left alone, and when to show up at the shop and demand to be let in, knowing he\nneeded the company.</p><p>&nbsp;A\nloud honking cut through his thoughts. <br /></p><p>It\nwasn&rsquo;t the low, nearly dignified sounds you hear on cars these days. Oh no.\nThis was a proper wheezing honk, the kind uttered by an old run down hulk that\ncrawled out of a junkyard, coughing smoke and spewing exhaust every which way\nlike the dying throes of some beast. </p><p>There\nwas a sinking sort of dread creeping on the angel as he looked and saw the\nsound was not, in fact, coming from a car, but from a rickety old unicycle. The\nfigure riding it was short, dressed in a battered top hat and a huge overcoat,\nand yes, a demon. <br /></p><p>Oh\ndear.</p><p>The\ndemon hopped down from the unicycle and made his way over. </p><p>He\nstopped short at seeing Aziraphale, actually rocking back on the heels of\nhis overly large shoes. He pointed at the angel, threw his head back, and\nlaughed silently, his whole body shaking with it.</p><p>&ldquo;E-excuse\nme?&rdquo; bristled Aziraphale.&ldquo;Just what is so funny?&rdquo;</p><p>The\ndemon waddled over to him and plucked at Aziraphale&rsquo;s coat, grinning. &ldquo;I <i>like</i> this coat*,&rdquo; said Aziraphale defensively. He\nswatted the demon&rsquo;s hand away from his bow-tie, &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with a\nbow-tie! You can hardly talk anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>*The\ncoat in question was perhaps a bit on the old side, but it had been through so\nmuch with the angel, and was so very comfortable that he hadn&rsquo;t the heart to\nget rid of it. It didn&rsquo;t show it&rsquo;s age so very much, really. It simply&hellip;was a bit dated\nperhaps. </p><p>The\ndemon plopped himself down on a nearby bench, swinging his short legs happily\nand whistling. Aziraphale bit back a sigh and followed, making absolutely sure\nto check he wasn&rsquo;t about to sit on anything nefarious before sitting down.</p><p>&ldquo;Your\nname is Wasco, is that right?&rdquo;</p><p>The\ndemon beamed at him, nodding enthusiastically. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nah&mdash;&rdquo; he watched warily as Wasco pulled a long thin balloon out of his pocket.\nHe diligently bent it into the shape of a dog. &ldquo;Er. Well done,&rdquo; said\nAziraphale. Wasco handed the dog to him and rummaged though the huge pockets of\nhis coat. He produced a comically large pin. </p><p>Aziraphale only had time to think <i>oh no</i>,\nbefore&mdash; <br /></p><p><i>POP</i></p><p>Little bits of colourful rubber landed around them. A baby in a pram\nnearby started to cry, startled by the noise. Wasco rocked back and forth in\nsilent laughter. </p><p>Well.\nHe had asked for someone with a sense of humor. Perhaps he should have been\nmore specific?</p><p>Aziraphale\nbrushed the bits of balloon off his coat. He thought better of it and miracled\nthem away, not wanting some poor animal to choke on it.</p><p>&ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t talk much, do you?&rdquo; he tried.</p><p>There\nwas a negative honking sound from deep inside the overcoat.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm.\nHave you, er&hellip;are you by any chance familiar with Punch and Judy? Eh&hellip;Charlie\nChaplin? Harpo Marx?&rdquo;</p><p>Wasco\ngrabbed his hand and shook it wildly.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I\nthought so.&rdquo; He yelped as a shock ran through him. The demon&rsquo;s hand detached\nentirely. Wasco laughed, kicking his short legs. Aziraphale sighed. &ldquo;Very\nfunny.&rdquo; He gave the hand back. Wasco promptly jumped up on the bench and hurled\nthe fake hand into the pond, scattering the few ducks still out in the cold.</p><p>Hastily,\nAziraphale miracled the electricity out of the toy before it could do any\ndamage. Wasco frowned at him. &ldquo;The ducks wouldn&rsquo;t have liked that,&rdquo; defended\nAziraphale. Wasco stuck his tongue out.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nhaven&rsquo;t been up here recently, have you?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Wasco\nshook his head. He pointed at the ducks and grinned. They were funny\nlooking creatures. Aziraphale had always liked that about ducks, the way they\nwaddled and quacked and somehow managed to be quite fearsome when the mood\nstruck. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nlike it up here though, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Wasco nodded happily and sat back down.\n&ldquo;When were you last on earth?&rdquo;</p><p>The\ndemon paused. He sat back on the bench, crossing one arm over his chest and\ncupping his chin in an exaggerated thinking gesture. Then he straightened, and\nturned to Aziraphale.</p><p>Wasco\nheld up a finger and traced it down through the air in an arc, whistling as it\nwent. When it hit the bench he spread his hands apart, mimicking an explosion.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.\nOh I see.&rdquo; Likely one of the great wars. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>The\ndemon dug through his pockets and produced a glaringly coloured, polka dotted\nhandkerchief. There was a loud honking sound as he blew his nose obnoxiously.\nHe courteously offered it to the angel.</p><p>&ldquo;Er,\nno. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Wasco\nshrugged and tossed it over the back of the bench.</p><p>They\nsat in silence for a long minute, Aziraphale struggling to think of something\nto say and Wasco cheerfully rummaging through his huge pockets, ominous\nclanking sounds coming from their depths.</p><p>At\nleast it was a nice day. It was sunny for winter, and warm enough to make an\nouting pleasant. </p><p>Wasco\nturned in his seat, staring over the back of the bench at the busy intersection\nbehind them. Then he raised his finger. He pulled a stick of dynamite out of\nhis coat. The tip began to fizzle.</p><p>Aziraphale&rsquo;s\nheart skipped a beat as he realized that <i>yes</i>,\nthat was real dynamite, and yes, Wasco drawing his arm back to throw it at the\nintersection.</p><p>He\nonly had a second to act.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>,&rdquo; said Aziraphale. </p><p>The\ndynamite disappeared. Wasco turned to him in confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;That\nis <i>not </i>funny, Wasco,&rdquo; he started lowly, adrenaline turning his voice sharp.\n&ldquo;That could have seriously hurt someone! You could have <i>killed</i> all of those people! Is that what you wanted?&rdquo; The edge of divine wrath had seeped into his voice, making his eyes glow faintly. &ldquo; I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> have it. It&rsquo;s not funny\nif&hellip;oh.&rdquo; </p><p>Wasco\nwas shrinking back from him, visibly frightened. <br /></p><p>Aziraphale deflated. He hadn&rsquo;t\nmeant to scare the demon that badly. But he couldn&rsquo;t go around killing people.\nAnd certainly not in Aziraphale&rsquo;s city. </p><p>The\nangel pursed his lips. Wasco really was only a small little thing. He couldn&rsquo;t\nhave been much more than an imp. And it was clear he wasn&rsquo;t intending to be\nmalicious, just&hellip;mischievous. </p><p>&ldquo;Humans\nare fragile,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t bounce back from something like\nthat.&rdquo;</p><p>Wasco was still terrified. Aziraphale sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\ndear. I&rsquo;m sorry for scaring you.&rdquo; And then he was suddenly struck with inspiration. &ldquo;Oh? Now, what&rsquo;s this? There&rsquo;s something behind your ear&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The angel produced a large daisy. Wasco stared at it with huge eyes. Then he broke into a\ndelighted grin.</p><p><i>I knew it would come in handy</i>, thought Aziraphale\nto himself proudly.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>This\ntime, Crowley was paired with an angel. He was feeling tentatively optimistic\nabout it. Aziraphale was an angel, for one, and Crowley considered himself <i>the</i> Aziraphale expert. He was certain he\ncould handle what ever this angel had to throw at him. He couldn&rsquo;t be much\nworse than Aziraphale on a bad day, could he?</p><p>Crowley\narrived in the courtyard they had agreed to meet at, fifteen minutes early. His\ndate was already there.</p><p>Hasdiel,\nthe angel, was sitting cross-legged on the steps in front of a winged statue,\nhands clasped in prayer, eyes closed. Tears streaked down his face. <br /></p><p>Crowley\nslowed, taking in the angels&rsquo; pristine white robes and faint shimmery aura that\nwas just visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Well\nbugger. This one didn&rsquo;t spend much time on earth, Crowley would bet his custom-made watch on that. </p><p>Still.\nIt could go all right.<br /></p><p>Hasdiel\nopened his eyes. &ldquo;Demon,&rdquo;\nhe said. &ldquo;I have prayed unto our Heavenly Father for deliverance from your\nwiles. I shall not be tempted in your presence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Er,\nHi. Nice one.&rdquo;</p><p>Hasdiel\nrose to his feet in a graceful shimmery movement. He blinked slowly at Crowley,\nmore tears running down his face. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Um.\nAre you&mdash;&rdquo; Crowley gestured at his face, &ldquo;&mdash;all right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nfeel the suffering of all beings,&rdquo; said Hasdiel. &ldquo;Their earthly pain expresses\nitself through me. To pray for their souls is my calling.&rdquo; </p><p><i>Very funny Adam, very funny</i>, thought Crowley wildly. <i>This is what I get for asking for\ncompassion, is it?</i></p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;you\ndon&rsquo;t get out much?&rdquo; he tried.<br /></p><p>Hasdiel\nblinked at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Look,\nlet&rsquo;s start over? I&rsquo;m Crowley.&rdquo; He held out his hand. Hasdiel stared at it.\nCrowley took it back awkwardly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ok. You don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nare the serpent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.\nYeah, that&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; Crowley awkwardly stuck his hands in his pockets. He took\nthem back out again, and wondered what he was supposed to do with them.</p><p>Hasdiel\nwatched him warily, tears still dripping down his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Look.\nI promise not to hurt you, all right? It&rsquo;s not my style anyway*. I won&rsquo;t tempt\nyou. I don&rsquo;t think Adam would be happy about any of that. It&rsquo;s not, y&rsquo;know, the\npoint of this whole&mdash;&rdquo; he waved a hand. &ldquo;Thing. Dating thing, y&rsquo;know? So don&rsquo;t\nworry about it, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>*Crowley\nhad never physically harmed Aziraphale. The thought actually sickened him. It\nhad been hard enough actively working against him. Not because the angel was\ntoo cunning, Crowley simply&hellip;hated seeing Aziraphale upset. Luckily\nAziraphale had been of a similar mind, and even if their formal Arrangement was\nrelatively new, they&rsquo;d come to an unspoken agreement early on not to doing\nanything intentionally harmful to the other.</p><p>Hasdiel\nsaid: &ldquo;You are not what I expected.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed awkwardly. &ldquo;Well. I&rsquo;ve been up here about six thousand years. They&rsquo;ll\nrub off on you, humans.&rdquo;</p><p>They\nwere still standing at this point, which Crowley thought was a bit ridiculous.\nHe sat down on the step beside the angel slowly, trying not to startle him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;\nHasdiel was watching him, curiosity plain on his face. &ldquo;You <i>like</i> humans?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yeah.&rdquo;\nCrowley shrugged, looking away. &ldquo;Yeah, I do. They&rsquo;re interesting. You never\nknow what they&rsquo;ll come up with next.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him like he&rsquo;d just sprouted another head. Crowley nearly checked just\nto make sure he hadn&rsquo;t*.</p><p>*Normally\nhe had a very good control of his body, but everyone once in a while there were\nlittle slip-ups. Aziraphale got them too, little slips of the subconscious,\nphysically manifesting in sometimes rather alarming ways. It was bloody\nannoying. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\n<i>do</i> feel compassion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Er.&rdquo;\nCrowley ran a hand through his hair, a blush starting up his cheeks. &ldquo;Mmh. Yea.\nDon&rsquo;t, um. Spread it around? M&rsquo; demon, see? It&rsquo;s bad for my reputation.&rdquo;</p><p>Hasdiel\nwas still staring at him as if he&rsquo;d had some major life-altering epiphany.\nCrowley was all for epiphanies, he just preferred if they didn&rsquo;t happen to\nother people on his time.</p><p>&ldquo;Look,\nare you all right?&rdquo; he tried. &ldquo;Did you want to get something to eat? That\nusually cheers Aziraphale up.&rdquo;</p><p>Hasdiel\njolted, coming back to himself. &ldquo;Aziraphale,&rdquo; he said, something hard coming\ninto his eyes. </p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You\nknow, Guardian of the Eastern Gate? He&rsquo;s a frien&mdash;er. We run into each other\ndown here. Do you know him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.\nI do not, and I am glad for it. That angel will Fall very soon and join the\nrest of the filth where he belongs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hah,&rdquo;\nsaid Crowley. And then he realized Hasdiel wasn&rsquo;t joking. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; His opinion of the angel dropped sharply. </p><p>&ldquo;Crowley.&rdquo;\nHasdiel took Crowley&rsquo;s hand. Crowley nearly flinched back. Azriaphale&rsquo;s hands\nwere warm and wan, and whenever they had touched it filled Crowley with an\nincredible feeling of comfort, of safety.</p><p>Hasdiel&rsquo;s\nfingers were feather light and cool, and brought none of the comfort he had\ncome to associate with Aziraphale. </p><p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo;\nsaid Hasdiel levelly, hand tight around his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Er,\nwhat?&rdquo; Crowley silently cursed his mind for going right to the gutter.</p><p>&ldquo;We\nmust pray for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nhk&hellip;what?\nWait, <i>what?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your\nsoul is not yet wholly corrupted,&rdquo; said Hasdiel. &ldquo;There is still hope. You can\nstill be returned to the glory of Heaven and to our blessed Father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa,\nwhoa hold on!&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Surely\nyou want this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&ldquo; <br /></p><p>Crowley\ndid lie awake some nights wondering and regretting&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t miss Heaven.\nFor all he hated Hell, Heaven wasn&rsquo;t that much better*. And if he did switch\nsides, what where the chances he&rsquo;d get posted on earth?</p><p>*Especially\nto hear Aziraphale talk about it. Oh they wouldn&rsquo;t torture you outright. No,\nthat was uncouth. But they had their ways of making you just as sorry as Hell could, Aziraphale had bitterly recounted, deep in his cups. It was a matter of aesthetics. At least Hell had\nthe decency to be upfront about it. </p><p>Earth\nwas where it was at. Earth was his home, it was his <i>side</i>, what he and Aziraphale had fought and nearly died for. Heaven\nand Hell could go bugger off. He wanted no part of their bloody pissing match.</p><p>Crowley\npulled his hand out of the angels&rsquo; grip. &ldquo;Look, you&rsquo;ve got it wrong. I don&rsquo;t\nwant to go to Heaven.&rdquo;</p><p>Hasdiel\nstared at him in confusion. &ldquo;But you are sullied as you are. Your soul is\nunclean and damned. I can help you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t need help. I&rsquo;m happy as I am, all right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How\ncan you be, burdened by sin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\njust am, Ok? It&rsquo;s different on earth. I can live by my own moral code,\nnot follow any one side blindly.&rdquo; Crowley was getting increasingly offended.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nneed not be afraid,&rdquo; said Hasdiel, expression benevolent. &ldquo;If you bare yourself\nbefore our Holy Father, you can still be saved. You <i>must</i> ask for absolution. He would want that, Crowley.&rsquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well\n<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; snapped Crowley. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Hell of a lot more\ncomplicated than all of that! You think just because you&rsquo;re an angel and you\nlive in Heaven you&rsquo;re pure as a daisy&mdash;well that&rsquo;s not how it works! You make\nyour choices everyday with every action&mdash;and if you think for one minute we&rsquo;re\nexempt from it&mdash; you&rsquo;re wrong! You have to think about what you <i>do</i>, not just do\nwhat you&rsquo;re told.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley was reeling. Aziraphale had never made him feel as low as this angel had. Aziraphale <i>respected</i> him. He&rsquo;d never force Crowley to repent. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo;\nsaid Hasdiel, holding out his hand. Tears glistened on his face. &ldquo;Be clean\nagain. Leave this filth behind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Fuck</i> you!&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nstormed off from the weeping angel, feeling something treacherously like tears\nprickling at his own eyes. </p><p>Xxx</p><p>Sitting\nin his favourite armchair, Aziraphale stared into his mug of cocoa and wondered\nwhy people willingly subjected themselves to dating.</p><p>It\nwas&hellip;true, that he&rsquo;d met some interesting people. Certainly. </p><p>Had\nhe enjoyed himself? No. Not at all.</p><p>He\nsighed. A sense of humor was important. But he&rsquo;d been hoping for something a\nbit more advanced than slapstick! That should have been a given. There needed\nto be some element of sophistication to it.</p><p>Wasco\nhadn&rsquo;t understood the difference between a harmless prank and a deadly attack.\nAziraphale needed someone who did. Someone with a strong sense of morality.\nLike Crowley. <br /></p><p>That\nhalted his thoughts in their tracks.</p><p>Crowley\nknew right from wrong. He had <i>always</i>\nknown, Aziraphale realized. And what&rsquo;s more, he acted on it. Even when it put\nhim in a bad position, Crowley was rarely cruel. He was considerate. He\nbalanced everything excellently, doing his job and performing acts of low-grade\nevil while at the same time avoiding as much actual harm as he could.</p><p>And\nhe knew what lines shouldn&rsquo;t be crossed. Crowley had never burned a book. He&rsquo;d<i> stopped</i> book burnings, simply because\nhe knew Aziraphale would be upset by it.</p><p>A\nwarm feeling was building in his chest.</p><p>A\nlow ringing shook him from his thoughts. It was his mobile phone. </p><p>&ldquo;Crowley!&rdquo;\nhe said delightedly. &ldquo;My dear boy, how are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aziraphale.&rdquo;\nIt was nearly a sigh. He sounded tired. The angel frowned. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are\nyou all right? Is something the matter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip;talk\nto me? Please?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of\ncourse, my dear,&rdquo; said Aziraphale softly, wondering just what had happened to\nput him in such a mood. &ldquo;Well&hellip;how about I tell you something I&rsquo;ve discovered?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.\nWhat did you find?&rdquo; Crowley&rsquo;s voice was still exhausted, but there was a note\nof fondness in it now.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>, my dear, are a shining beacon of\nmorality,&rdquo; said Aziraphale proudly.</p><p>There\nwas a strangled sound down the line.</p><p>&ldquo;No\nno, it&rsquo;s true. And I won&rsquo;t be budged on it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Angel</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And&mdash;I\nmust say, though I worry for your ego&mdash;you are terribly sophisticated as well. I\nsee that now.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Sophisticated</i>.&rdquo; Crowley gave a small\nlaugh. &ldquo;Ooh. I like that. Yeah. I am sophisticated, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly\nso.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go-<i>someone</i>. What kind of dates have you\nbeen having?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t think this last one was much more than an imp. Jittery little thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Imps\nhave about two brain cells they have to share between the lot of them.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nnot very nice,&rdquo; chided Aziraphale. &ldquo;Though of course I can&rsquo;t say as much, but I\nthink you may be on to something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas a bit like dating Harpo Marx.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\n<i>no</i>. That bad?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Afraid\nso.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For\nsomeone&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen those films in ages.&rdquo;<br />\n Aziraphale made a noise in agreement.\n&ldquo;Too bad he wasn&rsquo;t more like Groucho. He was more your style, if I remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nwhat can I say? I appreciate someone who can talk circles around everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Though\nit was nice to have someone appreciate my magic tricks,&rdquo; mused Aziraphale.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nno. I&rsquo;ve not been neglecting you, have I? You haven&rsquo;t been carrying a pack of\ncards around all this time, heartbroken, just waiting for me to ask?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>. I&rsquo;m simply glad I know the skill.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nlaughed. It was such a nice sound. Aziraphale pressed his mobile closer to his\near. &ldquo;Are you feeling any better, my dear?&rdquo; </p><p>There\nwas a breathy sigh. &ldquo;Yeah. Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas my pleasure,&rdquo; said Aziraphale softly.</p><p>&ldquo;No,\nnot&mdash;<i>thank</i> you. Aziraphale.\nFor&hellip;respecting me. As I am. Not&mdash;trying to make me something else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s not to like about you,&rdquo; said Aziraphale hotly, meaning every\nword. Crowley made a small sound down the line. &ldquo;Why? Dare I ask what your\ndates have been like?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;How\nabout I tell you later. We&rsquo;ll get together after this thing is over and drink\nabout it, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My\ndear, I would like nothing better.&rdquo;</p><p>There\nwas the sound of paper crinkling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get this damn quiz done.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale\ngrimaced. &ldquo;Yes, me too. Suppose we&rsquo;d ought to get to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ye<i>ah</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>They\nwere both silent for a long moment. Neither wanted to hang up.</p><p>&ldquo;Angel.\nThank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley.\nYou are very welcome. You know you can call me any time. After all, it&rsquo;s not\nlike I&rsquo;ll be sleeping.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nCrowley laughed again. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the great things about you. You&rsquo;re dependable.&rdquo;</p><p>xxx</p><p>Crowley\nfelt much better once he got off the phone with Aziraphale. He usually did. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright\nAdam,&rdquo; he said, glaring down at the quiz. &ldquo;I see how it is.&rdquo;</p><p>It\ndemanded honesty, but you also had to spell everything out for the damn thing. He&rsquo;d\nhave to think of it like some bloody-minded contract. </p><p>&ldquo;Compassionate,\nyes,&rdquo; said Crowley, bouncing his pen on his leg. &ldquo;But they have to be\nopen-minded. Someone who will look past appearances and at least <i>try</i> to get to know me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>&ldquo;Someone\nsophisticated&rdquo;, decided Aziraphale, filling out his quiz. &ldquo;Charming.&rdquo; The angel\ndrummed his fingers against his desk. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;And an excellent conversationalist&hellip;&rdquo;</p>",
