That\u2019s how the\nconversation ended.</p><p>Soon, you were running through the mass of\nbodies, texting Evey and letting her know you hadn\u2019t been feeling alright and\nthat you had gone home. </p><p>The uber arrived in fifteen minutes \u2013 the\nlongest fifteen minutes of your life \u2013 and as soon as you climbed on the\nbackseat, you opened the texting app and recited the address Taehyung had sent\nyou.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t far from there, in the outskirts of\nthe city.</p><p>Your mind was racing as your eyes followed the\nstreetlamps that looked like fairy lights from the inside of the car. At some\npoint, you closed your eyes and started taking deep breaths, feeling your heart\nin your throat. </p><p>Jungkook.</p><p>Was he alright? Had something happened to him?</p><p>Your palms were sweating, cold sweat, and they\nwere trembling like crazy, little veins tracing your skin as your knuckles\nturned white from the force with which you were balling your hands into fists.</p><p>A thousand scenarios were running through your\nhead, each one worse than the others.</p><p>\u201cMiss,\u201d the uber driver told you once the car\nhad come to a stop.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t even realized you had reached your\ndestination, too busy closing your eyes and trying to stop your heart from\nfalling from your mouth. </p><p>You paid him, not even waiting to pick the\nchange and ran out of the car. Following Maps in your phone, you ran through\nthe deserted streets. </p><p>You found Taehyung in the entrance of a dark\nalley, looking desperate and wild.</p><p>\u201cTae!\u201d you shouted as soon as you saw him.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he shouted back.</p><p>You threw yourself at him \u2013 if you hadn\u2019t done\nthat, you would have probably fallen face-first onto the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jungkook? Is he okay? What happened? I\n\u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cY/N, calm down,\u201d Taehyung said, grabbing you\nfrom your shoulders as you tried to look behind him. \u201cWe need you with a cold\nmind, please relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you ask me to relax when you told me\nJungkook needs me?\u201d you said, bewildered. \u201cWhere\u2019s him?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s sighed and let go of you. </p><p>You followed him through the alley until you\nreached the spot in between some trash cans and a fence. </p><p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d you couldn\u2019t help but scream as\nsoon as you saw his body limp, half of it fallen onto the ground, half resting\non the brick wall behind him.</p><p>You kneeled beside him, instantly reaching out\nto touch him. </p><p>All plans and stupidity being left aside, you\nstarted mumbling his name.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, hey, Jungkook, can you hear me?\nJungkook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s unconscious,\u201d Taehyung said from behind\nyou. \u201cI\u2019ve tried waking him up, but I think he hit his head pretty hard against\nthe ground.\u201d</p><p>You then repaired in Jungkook\u2019s appearance, for\nreal. He had blood dripping down his nose, and a dark bruise was forming in one\nof his cheeks. He had a small cut on his lower lip, and his grey hoodie was\ndirty. They were bruises, but bruises that weren\u2019t unusual for him. </p><p>It was the blood stain that was growing on one\nside of his hoodie that caught your attention.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d you gasped, clasping one hand over\nyour mouth. \u201cBut\u2026 Oh my god. He has been shot!\u201d</p><p>You looked at Taehyung, who was looking\nincredibly guilty. He also had bruises all over his face, and he didn\u2019t look\nany better than Jungkook did, except for the fact that he had no gunshot hole\nin his jumper, nor did he had stains of blood. </p><p>\u201cW\u2026 What the fuck happened?!\u201d you asked, your\npointer and middle finger pressing over Jungkook\u2019s carotid artery to find his\npulse. \u201cHe has been shot, oh my god\u2026\u201d you kept mumbling.</p><p>When you felt a soft thump beneath your\nfingertips you relaxed a bit.</p><p>Taehyung wasn\u2019t answering, he just couldn\u2019t\nanswer to that question in that moment, and your mind was working so fast that\nyou didn\u2019t even care.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 Doesn\u2019t matter right now,\u201d you said,\ntrying to calm yourself. \u201cWe need to take him to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?! No, he can\u2019t go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has been shot, Taehyung! We need to see if\nthe bullet has reached any vital organs or if there is an internal bleeding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we carry him to the hospital with a bullet\nwound, police will appear, and Jungkook can\u2019t afford that right now,\u201d Taehyung\nsaid in a calmer tone. You didn\u2019t know if he was trying to calm you or if he\nwas trying to calm himself. \u201cThey would start asking questions and\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t take him to the hospital <i>right now</i>, he\u2019ll keep losing blood and\nhe will die!\u201d you said, teeth clenched as you couldn\u2019t understand why Taehyung\nrefused to bring his friend to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I called you, you\u2019re a nurse, you\nshould know how to take care of him.\u201d</p><p>You stood up, taking some steps closer towards\nTaehyung.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a nurse, not a fucking surgeon!\u201d you said,\npausing briefly before continuing. \u201cWait, no, I\u2019m not even a nurse yet! I\u2019m a\nstudent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you work as a nurse at the fights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! But sewing up small cuts and bruises,\nnot healing bullet wounds! I haven\u2019t seen a bullet wound in my life, only studied\nwhat to do with it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know more than I do, then,\u201d\nTaehyung tried reasoning with you. \u201cListen, Y/N, we have no time to waste.\nJungkook\u2019s not going to the hospital, he\u2019d rather die than answer the questions\nof all those fucking cops. If they catch him and get him into jail, it\u2019ll be\nthe end of him, you already know that, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>You took some steps back from Taehyung and\nJungkook, threading your fingers in your hair and pulling from the roots in a\ndesperate act. It all felt like a nightmare, a really fucking bad nightmare.</p><p>Lifting your eyes just a tiny bit to stare at\nJungkook\u2019s unmoving body made you sick. </p><p>\u201cArgh\u2026\u201d you growled, drawing your hands down\nyour face and closing your eyes as you did so.</p><p>You had studied a lot of things but putting them\ninto practice was a completely different thing. And, being a bit egoistic, you\nwouldn\u2019t be able to live with the idea that you had killed Jungkook. On the\nother hand, you knew what Taehyung was saying was true. Jungkook already had\nsome issues with the law, he had escaped from the hospital when he had that\nmotorbike accident and you guess he had way more issues than that, let alone\nwhatever shit was he into at the moment. If you took him to the hospital and\nthey saw his bullet wound, they would immediately call the police and they\nwould start making too many questions\u2026 </p><p>\u201cAlright, alright\u2026\u201d you mumbled. </p><p>You patted your cheeks a couple of times before\nopening your eyes and staring at Taehyung. You were only a few months away from\ngraduating, you were practically a nurse. You could do that.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d you nodded, looking at Taehyung.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take him to my apartment, I have some medical supplies in there\u2026\u201d</p><p>You started counting internally all the\nsupplies you had at home. Some steri-strips, needles, disinfectant, sterile\ngloves\u2026 Even some intravenous saline.</p><p>\u201cGreat, great,\u201d Taehyung nodded. \u201cMy car is\njust parked a few streets away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo grab it, I\u2019ll be here with Jungkook waiting\nfor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, but he stayed there watching\nyou. You could see it in his face, he was just as affected as you were.</p><p>\u201cGo, don\u2019t worry, everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p><i>Or so you hoped.</i></p><p>Taehyung nodded a third time before turning\naround and running towards his car.</p><p>You were still pressing your scarf over\nJungkook\u2019s bullet wound when Taehyung walked inside your apartment carrying him\nin his arms.</p><p>He was still unconscious, but his breathing was\nsteady and his heartbeat strong.</p><p>\u201cPut him on my bed, last door at the end of the\ncorridor,\u201d you said as soon as you stepped a foot inside your apartment,\nrushing to close the door behind you and take your coat off, leaving it on the\nfloor.</p><p>\u201cKeep pressing on his wound with my scarf!\u201d you\nordered Taehyung as you grabbed your supplies from the cupboard under the TV\nand the bathroom.</p><p>It was a shocking sight, to see Jungkook in\nyour bed again, that time for way more different reasons. </p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d you said to yourself, trying to\norder the thoughts that were running through your mind. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung stood still, staring at you with uncertain\neyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asked in a soft voice.</p><p>It took you some more seconds to go back to\nreality and answer him.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d you finally said. \u201cTake his hoodie\nand the rest of his clothes off, leaving him only in his boxers. I\u2019ll start\npreparing everything.\u201d</p><p>As Taehyung undressed Jungkook, you rushed to\nwash your hands in the bathroom, put some gloves on and start setting your\nsterile field. </p><p>\u201cGauzes, disinfectant\u2026 Scalpel\u2026\u201d you counted.</p><p>\u201cWhere do I leave his clothes?\u201d Taehyung asked.</p><p>\u201cLeave them inside the shower, I\u2019ll take care\nof them later.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and disappeared from you room. You\ntook that as a chance to look back at Jungkook. He was paler and paler by each\npassing second. </p><p>\u201cHold on, please, hold on,\u201d you desperately\npleaded, passing your hand over his forehead. At least he didn\u2019t have a fever,\nso the wound or the organs affected by it weren\u2019t infected yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back, I\u2019m back,\u201d Taehyung said, kneeling\nat the other side of the bed.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know why you both repeated each\nthing two times each time one of you spoke. It was as if you were reassuring\nyourselves.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded. \u201cGrab my nightstand lamp\nand give me some light please.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung did as you said while you climbed on\ntop of your bed, careful not to touch anything from your sterile field.</p><p>Your hands were trembling as you touched the\narea around the bullet wound, pressing and pinching, trying to find any signs\nof any organ being affected or bleeding.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like it hasn\u2019t reached any abdominal\norgan,\u201d you said, your hands still feeling around Jungkook\u2019s taut stomach.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good sign, a very good one.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung simply nodded, watching you work with\ncareful eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll se if I can get the bullet out.\u201d</p><p>You cleaned the wound and the area around with\nsome gauzes and water with soap.</p><p>Your hands trembled even more as you took off\nyour normal gloves and put some sterile ones on. Once you were fully sterile,\nyou grabbed the surgical tweezers and opened the wound. It was as if a heavy weight\nhad been lifted off from your shoulders as soon as you saw the metallic shine\nof the bullet. </p><p>Luckily, the shoot hadn\u2019t been to up-close and\nthe bullet hadn\u2019t gone too far into Jungkook\u2019s abdomen, barely reaching the\nmuscle tissue.</p><p>Grabbing another pair of tweezers, you\ncarefully got the bullet out of Jungkook\u2019s abdomen. </p><p>Without giving yourself time to think about\nwhat you had just done, you started sewing up the wound, careful to leave both\nends next to each other so they could scar quickly. Then, you applied some\nantiseptic and steri-strip in some of the places of the wound that looked more\nfragile to you.</p><p>Covering the wound with a fresh dressing, you\npatted the area, making sure the hemorrhage had stopped.</p><p>\u201cIs it done?\u201d Taehyung asked when he saw you\nstaying still.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s done,\u201d you nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd now what?\u201d </p><p>You stared at Jungkook\u2019s face. He had started\nsweating, probably from the pain he had been feeling despite being unconscious.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in God, Taehyung?\u201d you asked\nout of the blue. Before he could answer, you did. \u201cBecause all we can do now is\npray.\u201d</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>After taking care of the rest of Jungkook\u2019s\nwounds, you cleaned everything and threw it in the bin. </p><p>You cleaned the medical supplies from\nJungkook\u2019s blood in the sink of your bathroom, the marble material turning a\nreddish color as you asked yourself how many more times you were going to clean\nJungkook\u2019s blood.</p><p>Closing the tap, you looked upwards and stared\nat your reflection in the mirror. Hair greasy and disheveled, mascara ruined,\ndark circles under your eyes and pale skin, eyes red and puffy from crying and\nbeing tired. You looked great.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s him?\u201d you asked, entering your room were\nJungkook was still fighting, lying underneath your blankets.</p><p>You had switched on the heating so he wouldn\u2019t\nturn cold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Taehyung sighed, letting his\nhead fall onto his hands.</p><p>You walked towards him and placed your hand\nover his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, I have to take care of that cut above\nyour nose.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung sat at the feet of your bed as you\ncleaned his wounds and applied some disinfectant and antibacterial cream. </p><p>\u201cCan you explain me now what happened?\u201d you\nsighed. \u201cAnd don\u2019t just tell me that you got shot, tell me the reason why.\u201d</p><p>You could feel Taehyung sighing, his shoulders\nslumping.</p><p>You dabbed delicately the cut above his nose\nwith a cotton pad soaked in disinfectant.</p><p>\u201cFine\u2026 But please, don\u2019t tell Evey. Nor about\nthis, not about what I\u2019m going to tell you. Please.\u201d</p><p>You stared into his eyes, a delicate frown\ndrawing itself over your forehead. You stopped your movements with the cotton\npad and leant back a few centimeters.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Taehyung?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so wrong about it that Evey can\u2019t know\nanything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, promise me you won\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>You opened and closed your mouth like a fish\nout of water.</p><p>\u201cTae, she\u2019s my best friend, you can\u2019t ask\nsomething like that from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, if you don\u2019t do it for me, do it for\nher,\u201d Taehyung desperately pleaded. \u201cThe less she knows, the better. She\u2019ll be\nsafer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me, Tae,\u201d you said, voice\nmerely a whisper as you sat on the balls of your feet, staring with wide eyes\nat the man sitting at the feet of your bed.</p><p>\u201cPromise me, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I promise you,\u201d you stuttered. \u201cTell me\nalready, what have you and Jungkook gotten yourselves into?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung took a deep breath and leant forward,\nhis elbows resting on his thighs as his head hang low.</p><p>\u201cWe stopped when we met Sungho,\u201d he started.\n\u201cHe told us about the fights and said we could make a lot of money, that we\nwouldn\u2019t have to worry about paying the rent or making ends meet\u2026 Never again.\nHe introduced us to the boys and created a small family. Each one of us found\nin the other boys the father, mother, brother, sister, they had never had.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung took a brief pause, a long sigh\nescaping his lips.</p><p>\u201cSungho saw potential in Jungkook, and started\nfocusing on him, training him, bringing him to the underground fights,\nintroducing him to his contacts\u2026 And once he started fighting, Jungkook became\nSungho\u2019s own little goose that laid the golden eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was half a year ago,\u201d you nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah, almost two years ago. Jungkook became\nobsessed with fighting and wining and training and being the best. If he lost a\nfight, he would stay the whole night in the gym, training until he couldn\u2019t\neven lift his arms. He didn\u2019t stop until he won Bobby, and that\u2019s exactly what\nSungho wanted\u2026 But now he wants more, and Jungkook being a champion is not\nenough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what sense?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung lifted his eyes so he was staring at\nyou.</p><p>\u201cHe wants more money, more power, more and\nmore. I guess he has dragged us with him\u2026\u201d</p><p>You frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about,\nTaehyung?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung gulped.</p><p>\u201cSungho heard about what Jungkook and I did\nbefore he met us, and he took interest in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook interest in what?\u201d you pushed him. \u201cWhat\ndid you and Jungkook do?\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed your question was\nsending chills down your spine. </p><p>\u201cTae\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe dealt, Y/N. We were dealers.\u201d</p><p>You blinked rapidly as the words sank in. They.\nWere. Dealers.</p><p>\u201cAs in\u2026\u201d gulp. \u201cDeal\u2026 With\u2026 With drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung breathed. \u201cWe worked for an\nimportant drug lord who owns the business in this city. He has people\neverywhere, he controls everywhere and he basically is everywhere. We were\nnothing but two young dealers who dealt at university parties and clubs at the\noutskirts of the city, but we were <i>his </i>drug\ndealers. I don\u2019t know if you know this\u2026 But once you work as a dealer for a\ndrug lord, there is no going back, you can\u2019t just decide that you want a normal\njob one day and disappear, no. It\u2019s forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how did the two of you get out of that?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung shrugged his shoulders, averting his\neyes from yours once again. He started at his still unconscious friend lying on\nyour bed, naked torso heaving slowly.</p><p>\u201cWe spoke to him, payed our debt and swore we\nwould never talk. He had the names of our families, the directions of our\nhomes\u2026 We had too much to lose if we talked, so we never did. He kept an eye on\nus in case we betrayed him, and we never did\u2026 Until a few months ago. Sungho heard\nthat we were dealers and started asking questions about it. Jungkook and I\nthought it was normal, since he was our new boss. But then, he started asking\nabout money, and how the business worked. He told us he had a contact in the\nnorth of the country that could give him good quality material for us to say.\nWe told him that it would be impossible, that Mr. Kang, our previous boss,\nowned the entirety of the city and that he didn\u2019t like rivalry. He wouldn\u2019t\nallow any other drug lord in his city.\u201d</p><p>Another pause, Taehyung shook his head,\nmemories assaulting his mind.</p><p>\u201cBut Sungho didn\u2019t listen to us, he just saw\nthe money and the power it would bring him. He said he had contacts and that\nMr. Kang wouldn\u2019t be able to touch us. He\u2026 He put it so great that we only saw\nthe extra money we would earn, and we agreed. We became his dealers \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d you interrupted him, asking him to stop\nwith a raised hand. \u201cAre you telling me\u2026 Are you telling me that you and\nJungkook have been dealing drugs this whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>A image came to your head\u2026 How could have you\nbeen so na\u00efve? That night, at the party before the Christmas holidays you had\nseen it all. Sungho had been searching around for Jungkook, and Jungkook had\nbeen missing. You remembered seeing him in that dark alley, those girls\nlaughing as they walked away from him. You remembered how he stayed behind,\nkeeping something in the pockets of his jeans\u2026 Fuck.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Tae,\u201d you gasped, covering your\nmouth with the palm of your hand.</p><p>\u201cMr. Kang heard about us, discovered Sungho\u2019s\nbusiness and he put a price to our heads. We\u2019ve hidden from them thanks to\nSungho\u2019s contacts, but his contacts aren\u2019t everywhere, and tonight, they found\nus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, oh my god,\u201d you mumbled, hiding\nyour face behind your hands, threading your hands through your hair. \u201cOh my\nfucking god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were lucky that a police car passed by and\nthey ran away, but I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be so lucky next time,\u201d Taehyung\ncarried on. \u201cThey will eventually find us, and when they do\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d you repeated, lifting your head up\nand staring at him. </p><p>\u201cThis is why you can\u2019t tell Evey,\u201d he said,\nshaking his head. \u201cI can\u2019t risk putting her in more danger than she already is.\nThey\u2019ll go after our loved ones, it\u2019s best if we kept them away from all this.\u201d</p><p>You nodded on autopilot, your mind still\nprocessing that a huge drug lord wanted Jungkook and Taehyung dead, and\nprobably, Evey and the rest of your friends too.</p><p>\u201cThis is too much, too dangerous. You know what\nthose guys are like, Taehyung? They have all the money in the world, people\nmove because of money, people would do anything for them and a couple of\nbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, I worked for him, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you reach out to me, then? This is too\nmuch for me, I don\u2019t belong here, this is not my world. Why didn\u2019t you tell any\nof the other boys? They would know how to help you better than I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know about this, any of this,\u201d\nTaehyung said, shaking his head. \u201cAnd they can\u2019t know, for the same reason as\nEvey can\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>You scoffed. \u201cBut I can? Am I not in danger or\nwhat?\u201d </p><p>Taehyung pursed his lips. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry I have involved you in this,\nI\u2019m sure Jungkook will never forgive me for this\u2026\u201d Taehyung said, eyes glossy\nas he searched for your eyes in the dim light of your room. \u201cBut I was\ndesperate and Jungkook had been shot\u2026 You were my only option.\u201d</p><p>You nodded your head slowly, sinking everything\nin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not fair, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so, so\nsorry. Jungkook is like a brother to me, I love him so much, I couldn\u2019t bother\nthe idea of losing him and I had to set my priorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t one of them,\u201d you said, nodding\nslowly.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it isn\u2019t like \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you interrupted him. \u201cI get it Tae, I do.\nI just wish I was someone\u2019s priority for once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already are\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Taehyung stuttered,\nstopping himself. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fine,\u201d you shrugged,\ngrabbing the things you had used to heal Taehyung\u2019s wounds and putting them\ninside a plastic bag.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. I also called you because I knew\nas soon as you knew it was about Jungkook, you wouldn\u2019t be able to refuse. I\nknew you wouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>Your head snapped up to his just when you were\nabout to stand up from the floor. </p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung scoffed softly.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Y/N, everyone can see you\u2019re crazy\nabout Jungkook,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could bite water if it was for him. You\u2019re in\nlove with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to deny it,\u201d Taehyung was the one\nwho interrupted you then. \u201cI can see how you look at him and how you act all\ntough and indifferent around him, but each time he\u2019s hurt you hurt for him,\neach time he\u2019s happy you smile and each time he stares at you, you blush.\nYou\u2019re so in love it hurts to see from afar.\u201d</p><p>Your nostrils flared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitive, I\u2019m gonna kill Evey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvey? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? She didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already knew you were in love with\nJungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d you shushed him loudly. \u201cHe could hear\nus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, he\u2019s unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they say that the hearing is the last\nsense a person loses when they\u2019re unconscious.\u201d</p><p>Although, you didn\u2019t know why you were worrying\nso much about Jungkook hearing Taehyung\u2019s words when he already knew you loved\nhim. </p><p>\u201cThis is so fucked up,\u201d you said, turning\nserious once again. You rubbed your temples with both hands, a headache\nstarting to grow.</p><p>\u201cIt is, and I\u2019m so sorry for getting you in the\nmiddle of all this but\u2026 Jungkook needed you.\u201d</p><p>You nodded, finally standing up from the floor\nand grabbing the plastic bag in which all your used medical supplies had been\nkept.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d you sighed. \u201cI would probably do\nit all over again even after knowing that some bad ass drug lord and half of\nthe population of this city is after you.\u201d</p><p>You heard Taehyung sigh and mumble something\nunder his breath, but you didn\u2019t give it a second thought. </p><p>After all that had happened, and all the new\ninformation you had gotten, you were drained from all energy and you needed to\nrest.</p><p>\u201cYou can stay here tonight, or well, for as\nlong as you want,\u201d you told Taehyung. \u201cYou can sleep on the couch tonight, I\u2019ll\nsleep in my armchair and look after Jungkook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired, you should sleep on the couch\ninstead. I\u2019ll look after \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been punched on the face and my nose\nhasn\u2019t been nearly broken, <i>you </i>should\nsleep on the couch. And you should text Evey and tell her your right or\nsomething before she shows up in here panicking. Tell her you\u2019ll be busy this\nweekend and that you won\u2019t be able to see her.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung helped you preparing the couch after\nsending Evey a text. You ate some leftovers you had in your fridge while you both\nchattered about anything and everything at the same time. After a warm red tea,\nyou took a very much needed hot shower, cleaned your face and got rid of all\nthe ruined mascara, blow-dried your hair and put on your comfiest pyijama.</p><p>With a blanket and your mobile charger in mind,\nyou entered your room.</p><p>Jungkook was lying on the same position you had\nfirst left him. The moonlight seeped in your room at that hour of the night,\njust like any other night, and just like many nights before, its milky light poured\nover Jungkook\u2019s skin. It looked as if he was made of marble, so perfect and\ndefined. But, as your eyes traveled down his naked torso, you found the\nbandages covering his abdomen and flinched.</p><p>Cautiously, you took a seat next to him on the\nbed, cleaning the sweat from his forehead and making sure he didn\u2019t have a\nfever. Passing a cloth soaked in cool water all over his face, you observed\nevery feature of his. From the little mole under his lower lip, to his big\nnose, to his round eyes. </p><p>You were just torturing yourself, so you shook\nyour head and sat on the armchair that decorated one of the corners of your\nroom. With your blanket on and your mobile charging by your side, your eyes on\nJungkook, you started drifting off to sleep.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>The weekend passed by in slow motion.</p><p>You barely went out of your room, unless you\nhad to go to the bathroom or you felt hungry. You were afraid Jungkook\u2019s state\nwould worsen when you weren\u2019t in the room with him, so you just stayed there,\nass glued to your armchair as your eyes never left his unmoving form.</p><p>Three times a day, you cleaned him with warm\nwater, to wash away all the sweat from his body. You also changed the bandage\nthat covered his wound, observing that it wasn\u2019t getting infected or that the\nstitches didn\u2019t separate form each other so the wound could open. </p><p>It was pure torture to you, both physically and\nmentally, the thought of Jungkook dying in your bed haunting you every night. </p><p>If you had taken him to the hospital, they\nwould have extracted the bullet in an operating room, everything sterile. They\nwould have transfused him some blood too, making up for all he lost. But you\nhad no operating room, nor blood you could transfuse him, you just had your\ngauzes, your bottle of antiseptic and the hope that it would all be enough.</p><p>Jungkook was strong, but you didn\u2019t know how\nfar that strength could go.</p><p>Taehyung had gone home on Sunday morning,\ntelling Evey that he would be out of town so she didn\u2019t go to his apartment and\nsee his wounded face. You had been avoiding Evey \u2013 again \u2013 as Taehyung had told\nyou to, not wanting her to know about any of that. You had also called to the\nhospital, telling them you were sick and that you wouldn\u2019t be able to go that\nweek. </p><p>The only thing you could do now was wait.</p><p>Should you call his mother? No, you didn\u2019t even\nhave her number and he would kill you if you told your mother about all that.\nIf he didn\u2019t want her to know that he fought, imagine telling her that he dealt\nwith drugs. No. You couldn\u2019t do that to him.</p><p>Inside, you were feeling a mixture of things.\nFrom anger to fear. From resentment to confusion. He had rejected you in the\nworst possible way he could have rejected you, and yet, there you were, taking\ncare of him. Your relationship with Jungkook \u2013 if it could be called that \u2013 was\na spiral of things, and you had grown tired of it. You had never been in love\nbefore, but you were sure love wasn\u2019t supposed to hurt like that.</p><p>After thinking and thinking, you had finally\ndrifted off to sleep once more, mind blank as you let your body rest for once.</p><p>It was the noise of grunts and movement that\nsnapped you awake.</p><p>Confusedly, you blinked a few times, trying to\nadjust your eyes to the darkness in the room. Your neck ached from sleeping\nthree nights in a row in an armchair, and your whole body felt weak, you\nweren\u2019t ready to fight some stranger breaking into your house.</p><p>Your eyes landed on the body on your bed,\nusually still but now moving.</p><p>\u201cJungkook?\u201d you asked, eyes widening.</p><p>Jungkook was tossing and turning, growling\nthings under his breath. </p><p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d you called him once more, walking\ntowards him and kneeling besides him.</p><p>Your hands instantly touched his forehead. It\nwas burning.</p><p>No\u2026 He couldn\u2019t have a fever, please, that wasn\u2019t\na good sign.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, hey,\u201d you whispered.</p><p>He had a frown drawn over his forehead, eyes\nclosed and lips turned upside-down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not alone,\u201d you\nsoftly whispered, leaning closer to him as your hands pushed his bangs away from\nhis sweaty forehead. \u201cWhat hurts, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cT\u2026 Taehyung?\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung\u2019s not here, he\u2019s \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cTaehyung?! Taehyung?!\u201d Jungkook said, starting\nto raise his voice as his movements became brusquer.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, he\u2019s not here, he\u2019s at home, he\u2019s\nsafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d</p><p>He finally opened his eyes and sat himself on\nthe bed, pulling away your hands from him. As soon as he sat, he let out a howl\nof pain, his hands flying to the bandage on his abdomen.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d you mumbled, pushing his shoulders\nand pushing him down on the bed. \u201cDon\u2019t sit.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook then focused his eyes on you, widening\nthem at recognizing your face.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded, trying to calm him. \u201cYeah,\nI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I? Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at my apartment, Taehyung is safe at\nhis, resting and recovering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he hurt?!\u201d Jungkook said, alarmed.</p><p>\u201cJust a small cut on his nose, he didn\u2019t even\nneed stitches. I cleaned his wounds and sent him home.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook sighed in what felt like relief, his\neyes travelling towards the ceiling of your room, a ceiling he knew better than\nthe palm of his hand. He could remember all the countless sleepless nights in\nyour bed staring at the ceiling and mind reeling as you slept peacefully by his\nside. </p><p>You watched as he closed his eyes. You could\nalmost hear the mechanism of his brain working. </p><p>\u201cHow did I get here?\u201d he asked after a few\nseconds.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung called me on Friday night\u2026\u201d you\ncautiously said, not knowing if he would get angry or not. Maybe he didn\u2019t want\nto be there, with you\u2026 \u201cHe told me you needed my help and I went searching for\nyou\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jungkook opened his eyes and stared at you,\nface blank and impassible.</p><p>\u201cAnd you helped me? After all that has\nhappened?\u201d</p><p>You sighed, looking down. \u201cI had no other\noption. It was either that or letting you die in that alley. I wanted to take\nyou to the hospital, but Tae refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all I\u2019ve done to you, you could have\njust gone home and let me die in there,\u201d he lifted his arm cautiously to gently\nbrush away the hair from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe that\u2019s what you deserved,\u201d you\nsaid, a roll of eyes to indicate him that it was far from what you thought. No\none deserved to die for feeling like he did\u2026 Maybe for how he had treated you,\nbut nah, it was not a good enough reason to die. \u201cBut I have something called\nconscience and it would have never let me live with it if I had just left you\nthere to die. Any other decent person would have done the same.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook sighed and the sound of air escaping\nsoftly through his lips was the only noise that was heard in the room for a\ncouple of minutes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have questions? You always have\nthousands,\u201d he said.</p><p>You averted your eyes from the covers of your\nbed, eyes finding his in the darkness of the room. The sky was cloudy and no\nmoonlight seeped into your room. You could see the pained expression on\nJungkook\u2019s face, though. It was almost agonic.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you shrugged, reaching towards your\nbedside table were you kept the painkillers and a glass of water. \u201cTae already\ntold me everything. Here,\u201d you said, handing him a pill and the glass of water.\n\u201cDrink it, it\u2019ll help you with the pain and the fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018Tae told me everything\u2019 mean?\u201d\nJungkook said, eyes suddenly wide as he ignored the pill and the glass of water\nyou were offering him. </p><p>\u201cWhat it means, there\u2019s no other meaning behind\nit. I know what happened and why,\u201d you said.</p><p>Jungkook stared at you for a few more seconds\nand then, he let out a frustrated noise.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d you could hear him say. \u201cI\u2019m gonna\nfucking kill Taehyung. Does Evey know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe begged me not to tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bast \u2013\u201c he grunted, stopping himself. \u201cHe\ncan keep his girl away from all this shit, but instead he has to involve min \u2013\u201c</p><p>He took a deep breath to stop himself once\nagain from finishing that sentence, eyes staring into you. Had he been about to\nsay \u2018mine\u2019? You shook your head at the thought.</p><p>\u201cHe had no other option, Jungkook, he was\ndesperate to save you. You didn\u2019t look good, you were dying.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook closed his eyes and lifted his other\narm to pinch the bridge of his nose, forgetting about the wound situated in the\nleft side of his abdomen. A roaring pain ran through his body, and he let out a\nhowl of pain as he brought both of his hands towards the wound.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d you urged him, kneeling on the bed besides\nhim. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it, and don\u2019t move, the stitches are still a bit fresh and if\nyou apply force towards that spot they\u2019ll break.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed his hands, pushing them away from\nhis wound and resting on his sides. You lit the lamp on your bedside table and\nstarted opening your first-aid kit.</p><p>\u201cI cleaned it this morning, but I\u2019ll clean it\nagain in case some stitches broke.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook nodded and let you take the bandage\noff.</p><p>\u201cSo, you know about\u2026\u201d he began to say.</p><p>\u201cI know about the drugs, the gang, the money,\nSungho, a certain Mr. Kang,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Jungkook growled just as you finished\nyour sentence and finished taking the bandage off. You didn\u2019t know if the curse\nwas directed at one or another.</p><p>\u201cHe also told me about what\u2019s going on and the\ndanger you\u2019re in,\u201d you said. \u201cI won\u2019t let it affect me.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook laughed humorlessly. \u201cYou know nothing\nabout all that shit, Y/N, you can\u2019t just let it not affect you. It doesn\u2019t\ndepend on you anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you come to the alley to get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there anyone else watching us?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know, wasn\u2019t exactly\nlooking around searching for someone spying on us when you were lying on the\nground and bleeding yourself to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so fucked up, if Kang knows about you\nor any of the other people around us\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to do with your world or what\nyou do, Jungkook, he won\u2019t come after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would go after anyone if that means he\nhurts Taehyung or me.\u201d</p><p>You sighed, throwing the dirty gauzes in a\nplastic bag.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean that it would hurt you if that\nKang did anything to me?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook pursed his lips, knowing he was\nplaying near dangerous territory. He opted for staying quiet.</p><p>You stared at him, waiting for an answer.</p><p>Shaking your head, you continued cleaning the\nwound.</p><p>\u201cIt looks good, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not infected\nand the stitches are doing good, you will be able to go home tomorrow and, in\nten days ask someone to take the stitches out \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cOf course it would hurt me,\u201d he interrupted\nyou.</p><p>You acted as if you hadn\u2019t heard him,\ncontinuing with the bandage and covering the wound.</p><p>\u201cIt would kill me if anything happened to you\nbecause of me,\u201d he continued, almost as if he was desperate to say those words.\n\u201cI care about you.\u201d</p><p>Your heart jumped inside your chest, but you\ndidn\u2019t let yourself waver.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you sure do,\u201d you scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019ve shown\nme how much you care about me again and again since we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you? You\u2019ve shown me in the best of ways\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re telling me that after all\nthe shit I\u2019ve gone through because of you, it\u2019s almost insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? It\u2019s insulting? And what is it to see\nyou with Jiwon everywhere I go? Playing the lovely dovey couple?\u201d</p><p>You narrowed your eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t go through that\npath, you know it\u2019s unfair of you throw that in my face when you\u2019ve been\nhooking up with random girls in front of my fucking nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unfair when I\u2019ve asked you repeatedly\nnot to hang out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have never asked anything! The only thing\nyou do is demand! Do this, don\u2019t do that!\u201d you snapped, tired of his bullshit.\n\u201cI\u2019m nothing to you and you\u2019re nothing to me, so you have no right over what I\ncan, or cannot do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah? Am I nothing to you?\u201d he answered,\nvenom laced with his voice. You knew in that exact same moment what he was\nabout to say. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it if you\u2019ve gone <i>through all this shit </i>for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you Jungkook, fuck you,\u201d you spat,\nstanding up from your bed and grabbing the plastic bag with the used supplies. </p><p>You stormed out of your room, finding solace in\nyour equally as dark living room. Throwing away the plastic bag, you drank a\nglass of water and rested your elbows on the cold surface of the kitchen\ncounter, hiding your face in your hands. Why was it all like a cycle? Again and\nagain, you always went back to the start. It was destroying you, and you\nweren\u2019t helping. Getting involved with Jiwon had been childish and stupid of\nyou and getting into that world in the first place had been even more stupid.</p><p>You almost flinched when you felt the warmth of\na body behind you, chest pressing against your back.</p><p>Jungkook hesitantly raised his hands and placed\nthem on your arms.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d you mumbled, flinching away\nfrom his touch.</p><p>He didn\u2019t back away, only leaning closer to\nyou.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get you,\u201d he whispered, and you were about\nto scoff when he spoke again. \u201cAll I do is hurt you, and all you do is come\nback to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be because I\u2019m stupid\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve this, Y/N, I don\u2019t deserve\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you don\u2019t, but here you are and\nhere I am. In love with a person whom I wonder if someday will <i>see </i>me.\u201d</p><p>You hear Jungkook take a deep breath and you\npush him away as you turn around to face him. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act as if you didn\u2019t already know, you\nknew it even before I almost told you,\u201d you scoffed. \u201cTaehyung also told me.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s eyes travelling down to the floor is\nthe only answer you needed.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you realize it?\u201d you asked, crossing\nyour arms over your chest.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWas it when we fucked at your apartment before\nChristmas Holidays, or was it when I was always there for you when you needed\nme like a lost puppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we fucked at my apartment,\u201d he sincerely\nadmitted.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d you nodded. \u201cIt was then\u2026 I should have\nknown,\u201d you nodded with your head. \u201cDid you care about my feelings when you\nwere making out with all those girls in front of me? Or, well, did you ever\ncare at all?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook shook his head. \u201cWere you with Jiwon\njust to throw it back at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jiwon all you care about?\u201d you scoffed,\npushing yourself away from the kitchen counter.</p><p>Jungkook grabbed your upper arm, stopping you\nbefore you could walk around the kitchen aisle and escape from him.</p><p>\u201cYou should stay away from me and everything\nthat surrounds me. The boys, the fights\u2026 Everything.\u201d</p><p>You looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cI care <i>too\nmuch,</i>\u201d he said, his voice so low you could barely hear it in the silence of\nyour apartment.</p><p>\u201cFunny way of showing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever been good at it, but if there\u2019s one\nthing I\u2019m good at, is pushing people away,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>His eyes never left yours as those words left\nhis lips. The intensity of his gaze on yours told you he wanted you to read in\nbetween those lines.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only get hurt if you keep being around\nme,\u201d he breathed, pulling you closer to him.</p><p>You let him push you and move you and do you\nlike a puppet, like you always did, his callous fingers, filled with scars,\nplaying with the strings of your heart.</p><p>\u201cIf you care about someone you don\u2019t push them\naway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do when their safety it\u2019s at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t try to convince you of something you\ndon\u2019t want to be convinced of,\u201d you said, shaking your head.</p><p>He shook his head too.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me about anything.\u201d</p><p>His face was so close to yours you could feel\nevery breath, every sound. You could smell him and feel him and sense him. So\nclose yet so far.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could love you, but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said\nthose words slowly and quietly, knowing that they would feel like daggers to\nyou.</p><p>He leaned a bit closer, and being in the state\nof shock you were, you let him. He leaned his forehead against yours, closing\nhis eyes and feeling you too.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s\nbest.\u201d</p><p>You scrunched your face up in disgust, placing\nyour hands on his chest and pushing him away from you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the couch tonight,\u201d you\nwhispered. \u201cI have to be at the hospital first thing tomorrow morning, I don\u2019t\nwant to see you here when I wake up.\u201d</p><p>That being said, you took some steps back, the\nhand that Jungkook had placed on your left cheek \u2013 and that you hadn\u2019t even\nfelt until then \u2013 falling limply to his side. </p><p>You didn\u2019t even cry that night as you laid on\nyour couch, feeling as if you had already been expecting what had happened. He\ncouldn\u2019t love you because he couldn\u2019t love at all, he had shown you a couple of\ntimes, but you had been na\u00efve enough to let your feelings and stupid daydreams\nblind you.</p><p>His words echoed through your mind.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t love you. Simple as that. </p><p>And when you woke up the next morning, he was\nalready gone.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>But life carried on, it always did.</p><p>You felt as if you had been given a second\nchance, the chance to take the right path once again. A path you had walked\naway from when you had decided to take part in the underground fighting world.</p><p>You left your apartment in March, when all of\nyour savings were long gone from your bank account and you couldn\u2019t afford it\nanymore. It was difficult moving to a dorm after living on your own for almost\nfour years, but it had to be done so you could at least graduate. Plus, working\npart-time at a book store wasn\u2019t that bad either, you had loads of time to work\non your thesis. </p><p>The worst part of it all wasn\u2019t moving to a\ndorm or finding a part-time job, no. The worst part was distancing yourself\nfrom the people that had been your friends during the past six months. They had\nmade you feel so comfortable with yourself, had made you feel so alive taking\nyou out of your comfort zone, that they had almost felt like family. How\ncouldn\u2019t they be called family when they had made you feel as if you fitted in\nso perfectly? </p><p>Of course you still kept in touch with Evey,\nbut always via text. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t stare at her and lie to her, you\ncouldn\u2019t act as if nothing had happened, and you couldn\u2019t stare at her laughing\nand kissing Taehyung knowing everything he was hiding. Yes, he was hiding\neverything from her to protect her, but still, he was lying to her. </p><p>But you weren\u2019t just distancing yourself from\nthe boys because you had realized it was not your world, that you didn\u2019t \u2013 and\ncouldn\u2019t \u2013 belong to a place like that, follow such a lifestyle. You were\ndistancing yourself because you couldn\u2019t stand de idea of seeing Jungkook after\nthose nine words he said to you. </p><p><i>I wish I could love\nyou, but I can\u2019t.</i></p><p>They bounced inside your mind, echoing and\nleaving you numb and tired. You couldn\u2019t think of anything that weren\u2019t those\nnine words, again and again. Why couldn\u2019t he love you? Was if because of you?\nWas it because of the circumstances? Was it because he just <i>couldn\u2019t love?</i></p><p>Whatever the case it was, he couldn\u2019t love you.</p><p>It was the saddest part of it all, because you\nknew that you would never stop loving him. You sometimes wondered how had you\nbeen able to fall in love with someone like him, so cocky and problematic and\nrude. An asshole from head to toe. A boy who lived for violence and breathed\ndanger. A boy who didn\u2019t give a fuck about anything, not even his life, risking\nit again and again. </p><p>But then, memories of you and him lying on your\nbed at three am assaulted you. They were the most dangerous memories of them\nall. Memories of his skin glowing in the moonlight, memories of his scent and\nhis raspy voice. Memories of his round eyes that held a thousand galaxies when\nthe streetlights reflected on them. Memories of his fingertips against your\nskin as he tickled you. Memories of his laugh and his smile \u2013 the same smile\nthat made him look almost innocent. Memories of your stomach hurting at how hard\nhe made you laugh. Memories of you closing your eyes as he hummed one of his\nfavorite songs while he thought you couldn\u2019t hear him. Memories of the random\nconversations you held in the middle of the night. Memories of feeling free,\nand beautiful and infinite while being with him. Memories of him and his, and\nhim again, and his\u2026 And when it started to feel so overwhelming that you\ncouldn\u2019t breathe, it\u2019s when you were lastly reminded of the love you felt for\nhim. </p><p>With the end of winter season and the blooming\nof flowers, things started to feel\u2026 Alright.</p><p>You still thought about Jungkook, but it didn\u2019t\nhurt anymore, nor did you repeat his words in your mind constantly during the\nday. </p><p>Time passed, in every meaning the of the word\npass.</p><p>Time passed and you started thinking that\nmaybe, one day, you would forget about everything that had happened. That you\nwould forget about him.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>\u201cHow long\ntill you graduate?\u201d your tutor nurse said, smiling at you on your way down to\nthe basement of the hospital. </p><p>\u201cA month\nand a half,\u201d you smiled back, a bit shy.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\nYou\u2019re so close!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\nnervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a\nbit, I\u2019m more nervous about the thesis, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\nare you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Once the\ndoors of the elevator opened, you both stepped out of it and started walking\ntowards the changing room. </p><p>\u201cFine, it\u2019s\nalmost finished,\u201d you sighed, relieved. You would have never thought you would\nsay something like that. Your thesis, almost finished\u2026 That sounded like music\nto your ears. \u201cIt only needs a few final touches and\u2026 <i>C\u2019est fini</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ll ace it,\u201d the nurse nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re a great nurse, Y/N, you have future\nin this.\u201d</p><p>You bit\nyour lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\nI don\u2019t want to forget why I studied this in the first place, why I love it so\nmuch.\u201d</p><p>You both\nstopped in front of the door of the students\u2019 changing room.</p><p>\u201cThere will\nbe days when you\u2019ll feel like forgetting all about it, but then, you\u2019ll see\nyour patients smiling at you, trusting you with their lives, and you\u2019ll\nremember it.\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cI remember\nit every day, and that\u2019s what keeps me going,\u201d she said. \u201cWould it not be for\nthat; I\u2019d be owning a flower shop right now. Flowers never make you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\nsounds like a good plan B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d\nshe laughed. She patted your back a few times. \u201cHave a good weekend, see you on\nMonday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too,\nsee you on Monday!\u201d</p><p>With the\nfirst days of May, the slightly warmer weather arrived too.</p><p>It was a\nbit late and you had missed your bus, so, instead of waiting twenty minutes for\nthe next one, you decided to take a walk. The night breeze was calm, and the\nsky was completely clear. Your oversized bomber jacket and your headphones were\neverything you needed.</p><p>Plus, the\ndorms were closer to the hospital than your apartment had been.</p><p>It had\nsaddened you, to say goodbye to your independence, to your small living room,\nand your open kitchen. To your bedroom, and your comfy bed, with its fluffy\nsheets and floral cushions, the lights that seeped through the windows each\nnight and the sunrays every morning. It had saddened you to say goodbye to\neverything that had happened inside that apartment, and all the memories you\nhad made in there. But life had to carry on, and that apartment was now part of\nyour past.</p><p>You hummed\nsoftly along with the music playing through your headphones.</p><p>You didn\u2019t\nwant to think about the past now, you were a new Y/N, a new and better Y/N.</p><p>The music\nblocked you form the outside world as you kept walking through the now familiar\nstreets of your new neighborhood.</p><p> \u201cMhmm\u2026\u201d you hummed.</p><p>Your eyes\ntravelled across the empty streets, only you and the streetlamps in them. As\nyour eyes focused on the shadow that the streetlights casted of your figure,\nyou noticed a second shadow.</p><p>Immediately,\nyou unlocked your phone and turned off the volume. Nothing.</p><p>You looked\nagain at the sidewalk. The shadow was there, just a few meters away from yours.</p><p>Breath\ncatching in your throat, you sped up, your footsteps becoming quicker and\nshorter. Your heart started beating wildly inside your chest and your whole body\nprepared itself to start running.</p><p>Taking off\nyour headphones, you looked backwards. There it, was, the shadow that had been\nfollowing you in the shape of a tall, big man. His dark eyes met yours.</p><p>You gasped\nand immediately started running. </p><p>Running ha\nnever been your strong point, but you weren\u2019t far from your dorm building and\nthe adrenaline pumping through your veins made you run faster and resist more.</p><p>You began\nhearing the heavy footsteps behind you once you turned around the next corner.\nYou could already see your building\u2026</p><p>Trying to\nbe smart, you thought about misleading the man and taking a sharp turn. If you\nran towards your dorm, you would be safe tonight but he would know where you\nlived and he would be waiting for you the next time you walked out of the\nbuilding. </p><p>Without\nthinking twice, you took a turn to your left in the first street you found. It\nwas a bit dark, only a few old streetlamps lighting the place. You kept\nrunning, trying to reach the other side where it would lead to a bigger street.\nBut your luck wasn\u2019t with you that night, and instead of a street you had found\na alleyway. And it didn\u2019t have a way out of it.</p><p>Your body\ncrashed against the fence, heavy breaths leaving your lips in erratic puffs as\nyour knuckles hit the fence with rage. Fuck. </p><p>Pure fear\nsettled in your body as you turned around, finding the man walking towards you\nwith a mischievous smile on his face. He was walking slowly, knowing \u2013 just\nlike you knew \u2013 that you didn\u2019t have a way out of that. </p><p>Your eyes scanned\nthe place, your self-defense classes mode on. You tried to find a place where\nyou could escape the man and run away from that alley. Maybe, if you let him\napproach you some more and then took a sharp turn to your right and ran towards\nthe opening of the alley\u2026</p><p>You stood\nstill, letting the man approach you.</p><p>Just when\nhe walked closer to you, a streetlamp lighted his features. Your breath got\ncaught in your throat as you recognized him. He was Jiwon\u2019s brother.</p><p>He laughed,\nthe sound echoing around the place. He could see the recognition in your eyes,\nhe could smell your fear.</p><p>\u201cNice to\nsee you again, doll,\u201d he said in a low voice that sent shivers running down\nyour spine.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\ncould say the same,\u201d you said in between erratic breaths.</p><p>You had to\nbe strong, or at least, act as if you were.</p><p>\u201cWhy are\nyou so scared?\u201d he purred. \u201cI just wanna talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you\nremember what happened to you the last time you tried talking to me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes\nshone with danger.</p><p>\u201cOf course\nI do\u2026 I think I remember telling you I didn\u2019t like bad girls, huh? They all\nneed to be taught a lesson. Well, I still think the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\nwanna teach me some bad self-defense lesson, save it, I already know everything\nI need.\u201d</p><p>The man\nsmirked, his hand reaching for something in the back pocket of his jeans. When\nit came back, you saw something metallic in his hand. A low click sounded\nbefore a knife appeared. The dim light in the alleyway reflected on its blade.</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah?\nWell, I think your stupid self-defense lessons didn\u2019t teach you anything about\nknives, huh? Do you really know everything you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call\nthe police.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed\nyour phone with more strength in your hands, protecting it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid\nthat, if you do, you won\u2019t be able to tell them anything when they arrive.\u201d</p><p>You gulped.\n</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nsuch a great coward if you need a knife against an unarmed person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call it\nbeing prudent, I won\u2019t take risks tonight,\u201d he said, voice low as he approached\nyou some more.</p><p>That was\nit, it was your last chance of running away.</p><p>Blinking a\nfew times, you didn\u2019t even give him enough time to process what you were about\nto do. You avoided him, taking a turn to your right and running towards the\nentrance of the alleyway. Your footsteps were quick, but your legs weren\u2019t as\nlong as his and soon, you felt a grip on your bomber jacket.</p><p>He pulled\nyou backwards until your back crashed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhere do\nyou think you\u2019re going? We still haven\u2019t talked,\u201d he growled in your ear,\ngrabbing strands of your hair and forcing you towards the end of the alleyway\nonce again.</p><p>You started\nto scream, but his hand clasped itself over your mouth.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he\npurred. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone interrupting us, do we?\u201d</p><p>You opened\nyour mouth, but not to scream. You parted your lips and sunk your teeth on the\npalm of his hand. You bit with strength until you felt the skin tearing\nunderneath your teeth, and the man let out a strangled cry.</p><p>He let go\nof you for some seconds, enough for you to try to escape again, but his other\nhand was still holding your hair and he yanked you backwards.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to a person who\u2019s trying to talk to you\u2026 That\u2019s\nrude.\u201d</p><p>You stood\nstill and felt his knee hitting the bottom of your back. Numb with pain, you\nfell on your knees. Your hands fled back to hold the sore area, and you closed\nyour eyes, fighting to not cry. </p><p>\u201cAre you\ngoing to stay still now?\u201d he growled, crouching on the floor before you. \u201cI\ncould have hit you harder, I could break a couple of vertebras\u2026 Maybe you\nwouldn\u2019t be able to escape then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou want from me?\u201d you said through gritted teeth, head hanging low.</p><p>He grabbed\nyour hair once again and forced you to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the\none doing the questions here, alright?\u201d he spat. You stood quiet; mouth shut.\n\u201cAlright?!\u201d he repeated, yanking your hair upwards.</p><p>\u201cA-alright,\u201d\nyou stuttered.</p><p>\u201cGood\ngirl,\u201d he smiled, and his smile almost made you puke. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure a little\nnurse like you can tell what things I can do to you to make you suffer without\nhaving to kill you, right?\u201d</p><p>Your lower\nlip trembled, but you fought against yourself and your fear to remain\nunbothered.</p><p>\u201cAnswer\nme,\u201d he growled through clenched teeth. \u201cEach time I ask you something I want\nyou to answer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright\nand right are rhetorical questions,\u201d you said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if you know\nwhat a rhetorical question is, but it doesn\u2019t need to be answered.\u201d</p><p>A harsh\nblow was delivered to your cheek, making your neck snap to the side in a harsh\nmovement. You turned your head back to look at him, not wanting to miss any of\nhis movements.</p><p>\u201cYou think\nyou\u2019re brave for answering me like that? You\u2019re more stupid than I thought,\u201d he\nsaid, his smirk reappearing on his lips. \u201cI\u2019d love to have Jeon here so he\ncould see what I\u2019m about to do to you.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes\nwidened as you saw him lean closer to you. You tried to stand up, but he\ngrabbed your hair with strength and kept you pinned to the ground. You closed\nyour eyes, but you could feel his breath against your neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat a\nshame the boss needs you alive\u2026\u201d he sighed and distanced himself from you.</p><p>In a harsh\nmovement, he let go of your hair, your back hitting the ground with a loud\n\u2018humpf\u2019. </p><p>\u201cYou can\nopen your eyes, I\u2019m only going to make you a few questions,\u201d he sighed. \u201cBut of\ncourse, if you don\u2019t behave, you won\u2019t return home untouched.\u201d</p><p>You blinked\nrapidly, blinking away the tears that had begun to pool in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s\nJeon?\u201d he asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d\nyou stuttered, still a bit in shock.</p><p>\u201cYou heard\nme, where\u2019s Jeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow.\u201d</p><p>Jiwon\u2019s\nbrother crouched once again so he was eye-level with you. </p><p>\u201cLying to\nme is not part of behaving like a good girl. C\u2019mon, I will give you a second\nchance. Where\u2019s Jeon Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, I swear.\u201d</p><p>The man\nnarrowed his eyes at you.</p><p>\u201cHow can\nyou not know if you\u2019re his girl?\u201d</p><p>At the\nmention of you as Jungkook\u2019s girl, your heart skipped a beat. How could you be\nso weak for him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\nhis girl, and I\u2019ve never been. I don\u2019t see where he is, nor I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you\nneed a third chance? Alright, where\u2019s Jeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nalready told you! I don\u2019t know! I haven\u2019t seen him in months, I haven\u2019t heard\nfrom him or any of his friends either!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\nabout that friend of yours that\u2019s with Kim?\u201d</p><p>You gritted\nyour teeth at the mention of Evey.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kept\nin contact with her, but we never talk about Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>The man\nstared into your eyes as if searching for something. You held his gaze. You\nwere telling the truth, there was no way you would break the stare contest\nfirst.</p><p>\u201cBut you\nonce were with him, you must know where he goes when he wants to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never\nknew him that well,\u201d you breathed. It hurt, but that wasn\u2019t a lie either. </p><p>He grabbed\nhis knife with more strength for you to see it.</p><p>\u201cYou better\nnot be lying to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\ndon\u2019t know where he is, but if I\u2019m being honest, if I knew, I wouldn\u2019t tell you\neither.\u201d</p><p>The man\narched a brow in understanding. </p><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d he\nmocked you. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with Jeon\u2026 That explains everything. Poor girl,\u201d he\npouted.</p><p>You\nclenched your teeth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nneed to punish you or teach you any lesson, falling in love with Jeon Jungkook\nit\u2019s enough suffering on itself,\u201d he laughed. You closed your eyes, somehow his\nwords hurt more than his blows had. \u201cMy brother told me about it, though. He\nthought you were stupid too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJiwon\nknows you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJiwon was\nthe one who told me where you would be and where I would be able to find you,\u201d\nhe smirked. \u201cAre you na\u00efve enough to think that my brother approached you just\nbecause he found you pretty and funny? Well\u2026 You caught feelings for Jeon, so\nyeah, you\u2019re na\u00efve enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew\nyour brother was using me just to return the favor to Jungkook, I just took\nadvantage of that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you\nwant to know where Jungkook is?\u201d</p><p>The man\nclicked his tongue. \u201cI told you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the one doing the questions\nhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and\nyour brother work for that Mr. Kang man, don\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you wanna find\nJungkook? Because you weren\u2019t able to finish your work with him.\u201d</p><p>Jiwon\u2019s\nbrother narrowed his eyes.</p><p>He grabbed\nyour face with one of his huge hands, forcing you to stare straight at him.</p><p>\u201cListen to\nme, doll,\u201d he spat. \u201cYou\u2019re doing fine by staying out of this, but it\u2019s too\nlate to forget about you. Find Jeon and tell him that he better fight the\nwrestling final in two weeks. If he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll start interrogating people\u2026\nAnd this time, it will be people he loves and not a girl he used to fuck and\nthat now is stupidly in love with him, understood?\u201d</p><p>His words\nfelt like pure ice sinking into the bottom of your heart.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood?\u201d\nhe said, grabbing your jaw.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you\nbreathed.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he\nsaid, letting go of you. Your jaw hurt from his tight grip. \u201cNow carry on with\nyour life and don\u2019t do anything stupid, we\u2019re keeping a close eye on you.\nFinish your thesis, graduate, move from this shitty city and find a boy who\ndeserves you and loves you back.\u201d</p><p>And with\nthat, he turned around and disappeared from the alley, leaving you alone.</p><p>Everything\nyou had been feeling since you found out you were being followed, downed on\nyou. You grabbed your knees and hid your face in between them, letting your\ntears fall freely and the sobs interrupt your breaths. </p><p>His words\nhad hurt more than his blows and threats, and that was what scared you the\nmost.</p>",

That\u2019s how the\nconversation ended.</p><p>Soon, you were running through the mass of\nbodies, texting Evey and letting her know you hadn\u2019t been feeling alright and\nthat you had gone home. </p><p>The uber arrived in fifteen minutes \u2013 the\nlongest fifteen minutes of your life \u2013 and as soon as you climbed on the\nbackseat, you opened the texting app and recited the address Taehyung had sent\nyou.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t far from there, in the outskirts of\nthe city.</p><p>Your mind was racing as your eyes followed the\nstreetlamps that looked like fairy lights from the inside of the car. At some\npoint, you closed your eyes and started taking deep breaths, feeling your heart\nin your throat. </p><p>Jungkook.</p><p>Was he alright? Had something happened to him?</p><p>Your palms were sweating, cold sweat, and they\nwere trembling like crazy, little veins tracing your skin as your knuckles\nturned white from the force with which you were balling your hands into fists.</p><p>A thousand scenarios were running through your\nhead, each one worse than the others.</p><p>\u201cMiss,\u201d the uber driver told you once the car\nhad come to a stop.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t even realized you had reached your\ndestination, too busy closing your eyes and trying to stop your heart from\nfalling from your mouth. </p><p>You paid him, not even waiting to pick the\nchange and ran out of the car. Following Maps in your phone, you ran through\nthe deserted streets. </p><p>You found Taehyung in the entrance of a dark\nalley, looking desperate and wild.</p><p>\u201cTae!\u201d you shouted as soon as you saw him.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he shouted back.</p><p>You threw yourself at him \u2013 if you hadn\u2019t done\nthat, you would have probably fallen face-first onto the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jungkook? Is he okay? What happened? I\n\u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cY/N, calm down,\u201d Taehyung said, grabbing you\nfrom your shoulders as you tried to look behind him. \u201cWe need you with a cold\nmind, please relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you ask me to relax when you told me\nJungkook needs me?\u201d you said, bewildered. \u201cWhere\u2019s him?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s sighed and let go of you. </p><p>You followed him through the alley until you\nreached the spot in between some trash cans and a fence. </p><p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d you couldn\u2019t help but scream as\nsoon as you saw his body limp, half of it fallen onto the ground, half resting\non the brick wall behind him.</p><p>You kneeled beside him, instantly reaching out\nto touch him. </p><p>All plans and stupidity being left aside, you\nstarted mumbling his name.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, hey, Jungkook, can you hear me?\nJungkook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s unconscious,\u201d Taehyung said from behind\nyou. \u201cI\u2019ve tried waking him up, but I think he hit his head pretty hard against\nthe ground.\u201d</p><p>You then repaired in Jungkook\u2019s appearance, for\nreal. He had blood dripping down his nose, and a dark bruise was forming in one\nof his cheeks. He had a small cut on his lower lip, and his grey hoodie was\ndirty. They were bruises, but bruises that weren\u2019t unusual for him. </p><p>It was the blood stain that was growing on one\nside of his hoodie that caught your attention.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d you gasped, clasping one hand over\nyour mouth. \u201cBut\u2026 Oh my god. He has been shot!\u201d</p><p>You looked at Taehyung, who was looking\nincredibly guilty. He also had bruises all over his face, and he didn\u2019t look\nany better than Jungkook did, except for the fact that he had no gunshot hole\nin his jumper, nor did he had stains of blood. </p><p>\u201cW\u2026 What the fuck happened?!\u201d you asked, your\npointer and middle finger pressing over Jungkook\u2019s carotid artery to find his\npulse. \u201cHe has been shot, oh my god\u2026\u201d you kept mumbling.</p><p>When you felt a soft thump beneath your\nfingertips you relaxed a bit.</p><p>Taehyung wasn\u2019t answering, he just couldn\u2019t\nanswer to that question in that moment, and your mind was working so fast that\nyou didn\u2019t even care.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 Doesn\u2019t matter right now,\u201d you said,\ntrying to calm yourself. \u201cWe need to take him to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?! No, he can\u2019t go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has been shot, Taehyung! We need to see if\nthe bullet has reached any vital organs or if there is an internal bleeding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we carry him to the hospital with a bullet\nwound, police will appear, and Jungkook can\u2019t afford that right now,\u201d Taehyung\nsaid in a calmer tone. You didn\u2019t know if he was trying to calm you or if he\nwas trying to calm himself. \u201cThey would start asking questions and\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t take him to the hospital <i>right now</i>, he\u2019ll keep losing blood and\nhe will die!\u201d you said, teeth clenched as you couldn\u2019t understand why Taehyung\nrefused to bring his friend to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I called you, you\u2019re a nurse, you\nshould know how to take care of him.\u201d</p><p>You stood up, taking some steps closer towards\nTaehyung.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a nurse, not a fucking surgeon!\u201d you said,\npausing briefly before continuing. \u201cWait, no, I\u2019m not even a nurse yet! I\u2019m a\nstudent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you work as a nurse at the fights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! But sewing up small cuts and bruises,\nnot healing bullet wounds! I haven\u2019t seen a bullet wound in my life, only studied\nwhat to do with it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know more than I do, then,\u201d\nTaehyung tried reasoning with you. \u201cListen, Y/N, we have no time to waste.\nJungkook\u2019s not going to the hospital, he\u2019d rather die than answer the questions\nof all those fucking cops. If they catch him and get him into jail, it\u2019ll be\nthe end of him, you already know that, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>You took some steps back from Taehyung and\nJungkook, threading your fingers in your hair and pulling from the roots in a\ndesperate act. It all felt like a nightmare, a really fucking bad nightmare.</p><p>Lifting your eyes just a tiny bit to stare at\nJungkook\u2019s unmoving body made you sick. </p><p>\u201cArgh\u2026\u201d you growled, drawing your hands down\nyour face and closing your eyes as you did so.</p><p>You had studied a lot of things but putting them\ninto practice was a completely different thing. And, being a bit egoistic, you\nwouldn\u2019t be able to live with the idea that you had killed Jungkook. On the\nother hand, you knew what Taehyung was saying was true. Jungkook already had\nsome issues with the law, he had escaped from the hospital when he had that\nmotorbike accident and you guess he had way more issues than that, let alone\nwhatever shit was he into at the moment. If you took him to the hospital and\nthey saw his bullet wound, they would immediately call the police and they\nwould start making too many questions\u2026 </p><p>\u201cAlright, alright\u2026\u201d you mumbled. </p><p>You patted your cheeks a couple of times before\nopening your eyes and staring at Taehyung. You were only a few months away from\ngraduating, you were practically a nurse. You could do that.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d you nodded, looking at Taehyung.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take him to my apartment, I have some medical supplies in there\u2026\u201d</p><p>You started counting internally all the\nsupplies you had at home. Some steri-strips, needles, disinfectant, sterile\ngloves\u2026 Even some intravenous saline.</p><p>\u201cGreat, great,\u201d Taehyung nodded. \u201cMy car is\njust parked a few streets away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo grab it, I\u2019ll be here with Jungkook waiting\nfor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, but he stayed there watching\nyou. You could see it in his face, he was just as affected as you were.</p><p>\u201cGo, don\u2019t worry, everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p><i>Or so you hoped.</i></p><p>Taehyung nodded a third time before turning\naround and running towards his car.</p><p>You were still pressing your scarf over\nJungkook\u2019s bullet wound when Taehyung walked inside your apartment carrying him\nin his arms.</p><p>He was still unconscious, but his breathing was\nsteady and his heartbeat strong.</p><p>\u201cPut him on my bed, last door at the end of the\ncorridor,\u201d you said as soon as you stepped a foot inside your apartment,\nrushing to close the door behind you and take your coat off, leaving it on the\nfloor.</p><p>\u201cKeep pressing on his wound with my scarf!\u201d you\nordered Taehyung as you grabbed your supplies from the cupboard under the TV\nand the bathroom.</p><p>It was a shocking sight, to see Jungkook in\nyour bed again, that time for way more different reasons. </p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d you said to yourself, trying to\norder the thoughts that were running through your mind. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung stood still, staring at you with uncertain\neyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asked in a soft voice.</p><p>It took you some more seconds to go back to\nreality and answer him.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d you finally said. \u201cTake his hoodie\nand the rest of his clothes off, leaving him only in his boxers. I\u2019ll start\npreparing everything.\u201d</p><p>As Taehyung undressed Jungkook, you rushed to\nwash your hands in the bathroom, put some gloves on and start setting your\nsterile field. </p><p>\u201cGauzes, disinfectant\u2026 Scalpel\u2026\u201d you counted.</p><p>\u201cWhere do I leave his clothes?\u201d Taehyung asked.</p><p>\u201cLeave them inside the shower, I\u2019ll take care\nof them later.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and disappeared from you room. You\ntook that as a chance to look back at Jungkook. He was paler and paler by each\npassing second. </p><p>\u201cHold on, please, hold on,\u201d you desperately\npleaded, passing your hand over his forehead. At least he didn\u2019t have a fever,\nso the wound or the organs affected by it weren\u2019t infected yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back, I\u2019m back,\u201d Taehyung said, kneeling\nat the other side of the bed.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know why you both repeated each\nthing two times each time one of you spoke. It was as if you were reassuring\nyourselves.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded. \u201cGrab my nightstand lamp\nand give me some light please.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung did as you said while you climbed on\ntop of your bed, careful not to touch anything from your sterile field.</p><p>Your hands were trembling as you touched the\narea around the bullet wound, pressing and pinching, trying to find any signs\nof any organ being affected or bleeding.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like it hasn\u2019t reached any abdominal\norgan,\u201d you said, your hands still feeling around Jungkook\u2019s taut stomach.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good sign, a very good one.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung simply nodded, watching you work with\ncareful eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll se if I can get the bullet out.\u201d</p><p>You cleaned the wound and the area around with\nsome gauzes and water with soap.</p><p>Your hands trembled even more as you took off\nyour normal gloves and put some sterile ones on. Once you were fully sterile,\nyou grabbed the surgical tweezers and opened the wound. It was as if a heavy weight\nhad been lifted off from your shoulders as soon as you saw the metallic shine\nof the bullet. </p><p>Luckily, the shoot hadn\u2019t been to up-close and\nthe bullet hadn\u2019t gone too far into Jungkook\u2019s abdomen, barely reaching the\nmuscle tissue.</p><p>Grabbing another pair of tweezers, you\ncarefully got the bullet out of Jungkook\u2019s abdomen. </p><p>Without giving yourself time to think about\nwhat you had just done, you started sewing up the wound, careful to leave both\nends next to each other so they could scar quickly. Then, you applied some\nantiseptic and steri-strip in some of the places of the wound that looked more\nfragile to you.</p><p>Covering the wound with a fresh dressing, you\npatted the area, making sure the hemorrhage had stopped.</p><p>\u201cIs it done?\u201d Taehyung asked when he saw you\nstaying still.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s done,\u201d you nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd now what?\u201d </p><p>You stared at Jungkook\u2019s face. He had started\nsweating, probably from the pain he had been feeling despite being unconscious.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in God, Taehyung?\u201d you asked\nout of the blue. Before he could answer, you did. \u201cBecause all we can do now is\npray.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>After taking care of the rest of Jungkook\u2019s\nwounds, you cleaned everything and threw it in the bin. </p><p>You cleaned the medical supplies from\nJungkook\u2019s blood in the sink of your bathroom, the marble material turning a\nreddish color as you asked yourself how many more times you were going to clean\nJungkook\u2019s blood.</p><p>Closing the tap, you looked upwards and stared\nat your reflection in the mirror. Hair greasy and disheveled, mascara ruined,\ndark circles under your eyes and pale skin, eyes red and puffy from crying and\nbeing tired. You looked great.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s him?\u201d you asked, entering your room were\nJungkook was still fighting, lying underneath your blankets.</p><p>You had switched on the heating so he wouldn\u2019t\nturn cold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Taehyung sighed, letting his\nhead fall onto his hands.</p><p>You walked towards him and placed your hand\nover his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, I have to take care of that cut above\nyour nose.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung sat at the feet of your bed as you\ncleaned his wounds and applied some disinfectant and antibacterial cream. </p><p>\u201cCan you explain me now what happened?\u201d you\nsighed. \u201cAnd don\u2019t just tell me that you got shot, tell me the reason why.\u201d</p><p>You could feel Taehyung sighing, his shoulders\nslumping.</p><p>You dabbed delicately the cut above his nose\nwith a cotton pad soaked in disinfectant.</p><p>\u201cFine\u2026 But please, don\u2019t tell Evey. Nor about\nthis, not about what I\u2019m going to tell you. Please.\u201d</p><p>You stared into his eyes, a delicate frown\ndrawing itself over your forehead. You stopped your movements with the cotton\npad and leant back a few centimeters.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Taehyung?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so wrong about it that Evey can\u2019t know\nanything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, promise me you won\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>You opened and closed your mouth like a fish\nout of water.</p><p>\u201cTae, she\u2019s my best friend, you can\u2019t ask\nsomething like that from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, if you don\u2019t do it for me, do it for\nher,\u201d Taehyung desperately pleaded. \u201cThe less she knows, the better. She\u2019ll be\nsafer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me, Tae,\u201d you said, voice\nmerely a whisper as you sat on the balls of your feet, staring with wide eyes\nat the man sitting at the feet of your bed.</p><p>\u201cPromise me, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I promise you,\u201d you stuttered. \u201cTell me\nalready, what have you and Jungkook gotten yourselves into?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung took a deep breath and leant forward,\nhis elbows resting on his thighs as his head hang low.</p><p>\u201cWe stopped when we met Sungho,\u201d he started.\n\u201cHe told us about the fights and said we could make a lot of money, that we\nwouldn\u2019t have to worry about paying the rent or making ends meet\u2026 Never again.\nHe introduced us to the boys and created a small family. Each one of us found\nin the other boys the father, mother, brother, sister, they had never had.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung took a brief pause, a long sigh\nescaping his lips.</p><p>\u201cSungho saw potential in Jungkook, and started\nfocusing on him, training him, bringing him to the underground fights,\nintroducing him to his contacts\u2026 And once he started fighting, Jungkook became\nSungho\u2019s own little goose that laid the golden eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was half a year ago,\u201d you nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah, almost two years ago. Jungkook became\nobsessed with fighting and wining and training and being the best. If he lost a\nfight, he would stay the whole night in the gym, training until he couldn\u2019t\neven lift his arms. He didn\u2019t stop until he won Bobby, and that\u2019s exactly what\nSungho wanted\u2026 But now he wants more, and Jungkook being a champion is not\nenough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what sense?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung lifted his eyes so he was staring at\nyou.</p><p>\u201cHe wants more money, more power, more and\nmore. I guess he has dragged us with him\u2026\u201d</p><p>You frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about,\nTaehyung?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung gulped.</p><p>\u201cSungho heard about what Jungkook and I did\nbefore he met us, and he took interest in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook interest in what?\u201d you pushed him. \u201cWhat\ndid you and Jungkook do?\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed your question was\nsending chills down your spine. </p><p>\u201cTae\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe dealt, Y/N. We were dealers.\u201d</p><p>You blinked rapidly as the words sank in. They.\nWere. Dealers.</p><p>\u201cAs in\u2026\u201d gulp. \u201cDeal\u2026 With\u2026 With drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung breathed. \u201cWe worked for an\nimportant drug lord who owns the business in this city. He has people\neverywhere, he controls everywhere and he basically is everywhere. We were\nnothing but two young dealers who dealt at university parties and clubs at the\noutskirts of the city, but we were <i>his </i>drug\ndealers. I don\u2019t know if you know this\u2026 But once you work as a dealer for a\ndrug lord, there is no going back, you can\u2019t just decide that you want a normal\njob one day and disappear, no. It\u2019s forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how did the two of you get out of that?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung shrugged his shoulders, averting his\neyes from yours once again. He started at his still unconscious friend lying on\nyour bed, naked torso heaving slowly.</p><p>\u201cWe spoke to him, payed our debt and swore we\nwould never talk. He had the names of our families, the directions of our\nhomes\u2026 We had too much to lose if we talked, so we never did. He kept an eye on\nus in case we betrayed him, and we never did\u2026 Until a few months ago. Sungho heard\nthat we were dealers and started asking questions about it. Jungkook and I\nthought it was normal, since he was our new boss. But then, he started asking\nabout money, and how the business worked. He told us he had a contact in the\nnorth of the country that could give him good quality material for us to say.\nWe told him that it would be impossible, that Mr. Kang, our previous boss,\nowned the entirety of the city and that he didn\u2019t like rivalry. He wouldn\u2019t\nallow any other drug lord in his city.\u201d</p><p>Another pause, Taehyung shook his head,\nmemories assaulting his mind.</p><p>\u201cBut Sungho didn\u2019t listen to us, he just saw\nthe money and the power it would bring him. He said he had contacts and that\nMr. Kang wouldn\u2019t be able to touch us. He\u2026 He put it so great that we only saw\nthe extra money we would earn, and we agreed. We became his dealers \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d you interrupted him, asking him to stop\nwith a raised hand. \u201cAre you telling me\u2026 Are you telling me that you and\nJungkook have been dealing drugs this whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>A image came to your head\u2026 How could have you\nbeen so na\u00efve? That night, at the party before the Christmas holidays you had\nseen it all. Sungho had been searching around for Jungkook, and Jungkook had\nbeen missing. You remembered seeing him in that dark alley, those girls\nlaughing as they walked away from him. You remembered how he stayed behind,\nkeeping something in the pockets of his jeans\u2026 Fuck.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Tae,\u201d you gasped, covering your\nmouth with the palm of your hand.</p><p>\u201cMr. Kang heard about us, discovered Sungho\u2019s\nbusiness and he put a price to our heads. We\u2019ve hidden from them thanks to\nSungho\u2019s contacts, but his contacts aren\u2019t everywhere, and tonight, they found\nus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, oh my god,\u201d you mumbled, hiding\nyour face behind your hands, threading your hands through your hair. \u201cOh my\nfucking god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were lucky that a police car passed by and\nthey ran away, but I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be so lucky next time,\u201d Taehyung\ncarried on. \u201cThey will eventually find us, and when they do\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d you repeated, lifting your head up\nand staring at him. </p><p>\u201cThis is why you can\u2019t tell Evey,\u201d he said,\nshaking his head. \u201cI can\u2019t risk putting her in more danger than she already is.\nThey\u2019ll go after our loved ones, it\u2019s best if we kept them away from all this.\u201d</p><p>You nodded on autopilot, your mind still\nprocessing that a huge drug lord wanted Jungkook and Taehyung dead, and\nprobably, Evey and the rest of your friends too.</p><p>\u201cThis is too much, too dangerous. You know what\nthose guys are like, Taehyung? They have all the money in the world, people\nmove because of money, people would do anything for them and a couple of\nbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, I worked for him, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you reach out to me, then? This is too\nmuch for me, I don\u2019t belong here, this is not my world. Why didn\u2019t you tell any\nof the other boys? They would know how to help you better than I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know about this, any of this,\u201d\nTaehyung said, shaking his head. \u201cAnd they can\u2019t know, for the same reason as\nEvey can\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>You scoffed. \u201cBut I can? Am I not in danger or\nwhat?\u201d </p><p>Taehyung pursed his lips. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry I have involved you in this,\nI\u2019m sure Jungkook will never forgive me for this\u2026\u201d Taehyung said, eyes glossy\nas he searched for your eyes in the dim light of your room. \u201cBut I was\ndesperate and Jungkook had been shot\u2026 You were my only option.\u201d</p><p>You nodded your head slowly, sinking everything\nin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not fair, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so, so\nsorry. Jungkook is like a brother to me, I love him so much, I couldn\u2019t bother\nthe idea of losing him and I had to set my priorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t one of them,\u201d you said, nodding\nslowly.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it isn\u2019t like \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you interrupted him. \u201cI get it Tae, I do.\nI just wish I was someone\u2019s priority for once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already are\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Taehyung stuttered,\nstopping himself. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fine,\u201d you shrugged,\ngrabbing the things you had used to heal Taehyung\u2019s wounds and putting them\ninside a plastic bag.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. I also called you because I knew\nas soon as you knew it was about Jungkook, you wouldn\u2019t be able to refuse. I\nknew you wouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>Your head snapped up to his just when you were\nabout to stand up from the floor. </p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung scoffed softly.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Y/N, everyone can see you\u2019re crazy\nabout Jungkook,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could bite water if it was for him. You\u2019re in\nlove with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to deny it,\u201d Taehyung was the one\nwho interrupted you then. \u201cI can see how you look at him and how you act all\ntough and indifferent around him, but each time he\u2019s hurt you hurt for him,\neach time he\u2019s happy you smile and each time he stares at you, you blush.\nYou\u2019re so in love it hurts to see from afar.\u201d</p><p>Your nostrils flared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitive, I\u2019m gonna kill Evey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvey? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? She didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already knew you were in love with\nJungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d you shushed him loudly. \u201cHe could hear\nus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, he\u2019s unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they say that the hearing is the last\nsense a person loses when they\u2019re unconscious.\u201d</p><p>Although, you didn\u2019t know why you were worrying\nso much about Jungkook hearing Taehyung\u2019s words when he already knew you loved\nhim. </p><p>\u201cThis is so fucked up,\u201d you said, turning\nserious once again. You rubbed your temples with both hands, a headache\nstarting to grow.</p><p>\u201cIt is, and I\u2019m so sorry for getting you in the\nmiddle of all this but\u2026 Jungkook needed you.\u201d</p><p>You nodded, finally standing up from the floor\nand grabbing the plastic bag in which all your used medical supplies had been\nkept.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d you sighed. \u201cI would probably do\nit all over again even after knowing that some bad ass drug lord and half of\nthe population of this city is after you.\u201d</p><p>You heard Taehyung sigh and mumble something\nunder his breath, but you didn\u2019t give it a second thought. </p><p>After all that had happened, and all the new\ninformation you had gotten, you were drained from all energy and you needed to\nrest.</p><p>\u201cYou can stay here tonight, or well, for as\nlong as you want,\u201d you told Taehyung. \u201cYou can sleep on the couch tonight, I\u2019ll\nsleep in my armchair and look after Jungkook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired, you should sleep on the couch\ninstead. I\u2019ll look after \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been punched on the face and my nose\nhasn\u2019t been nearly broken, <i>you </i>should\nsleep on the couch. And you should text Evey and tell her your right or\nsomething before she shows up in here panicking. Tell her you\u2019ll be busy this\nweekend and that you won\u2019t be able to see her.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung helped you preparing the couch after\nsending Evey a text. You ate some leftovers you had in your fridge while you both\nchattered about anything and everything at the same time. After a warm red tea,\nyou took a very much needed hot shower, cleaned your face and got rid of all\nthe ruined mascara, blow-dried your hair and put on your comfiest pyijama.</p><p>With a blanket and your mobile charger in mind,\nyou entered your room.</p><p>Jungkook was lying on the same position you had\nfirst left him. The moonlight seeped in your room at that hour of the night,\njust like any other night, and just like many nights before, its milky light poured\nover Jungkook\u2019s skin. It looked as if he was made of marble, so perfect and\ndefined. But, as your eyes traveled down his naked torso, you found the\nbandages covering his abdomen and flinched.</p><p>Cautiously, you took a seat next to him on the\nbed, cleaning the sweat from his forehead and making sure he didn\u2019t have a\nfever. Passing a cloth soaked in cool water all over his face, you observed\nevery feature of his. From the little mole under his lower lip, to his big\nnose, to his round eyes. </p><p>You were just torturing yourself, so you shook\nyour head and sat on the armchair that decorated one of the corners of your\nroom. With your blanket on and your mobile charging by your side, your eyes on\nJungkook, you started drifting off to sleep.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>The weekend passed by in slow motion.</p><p>You barely went out of your room, unless you\nhad to go to the bathroom or you felt hungry. You were afraid Jungkook\u2019s state\nwould worsen when you weren\u2019t in the room with him, so you just stayed there,\nass glued to your armchair as your eyes never left his unmoving form.</p><p>Three times a day, you cleaned him with warm\nwater, to wash away all the sweat from his body. You also changed the bandage\nthat covered his wound, observing that it wasn\u2019t getting infected or that the\nstitches didn\u2019t separate form each other so the wound could open. </p><p>It was pure torture to you, both physically and\nmentally, the thought of Jungkook dying in your bed haunting you every night. </p><p>If you had taken him to the hospital, they\nwould have extracted the bullet in an operating room, everything sterile. They\nwould have transfused him some blood too, making up for all he lost. But you\nhad no operating room, nor blood you could transfuse him, you just had your\ngauzes, your bottle of antiseptic and the hope that it would all be enough.</p><p>Jungkook was strong, but you didn\u2019t know how\nfar that strength could go.</p><p>Taehyung had gone home on Sunday morning,\ntelling Evey that he would be out of town so she didn\u2019t go to his apartment and\nsee his wounded face. You had been avoiding Evey \u2013 again \u2013 as Taehyung had told\nyou to, not wanting her to know about any of that. You had also called to the\nhospital, telling them you were sick and that you wouldn\u2019t be able to go that\nweek. </p><p>The only thing you could do now was wait.</p><p>Should you call his mother? No, you didn\u2019t even\nhave her number and he would kill you if you told your mother about all that.\nIf he didn\u2019t want her to know that he fought, imagine telling her that he dealt\nwith drugs. No. You couldn\u2019t do that to him.</p><p>Inside, you were feeling a mixture of things.\nFrom anger to fear. From resentment to confusion. He had rejected you in the\nworst possible way he could have rejected you, and yet, there you were, taking\ncare of him. Your relationship with Jungkook \u2013 if it could be called that \u2013 was\na spiral of things, and you had grown tired of it. You had never been in love\nbefore, but you were sure love wasn\u2019t supposed to hurt like that.</p><p>After thinking and thinking, you had finally\ndrifted off to sleep once more, mind blank as you let your body rest for once.</p><p>It was the noise of grunts and movement that\nsnapped you awake.</p><p>Confusedly, you blinked a few times, trying to\nadjust your eyes to the darkness in the room. Your neck ached from sleeping\nthree nights in a row in an armchair, and your whole body felt weak, you\nweren\u2019t ready to fight some stranger breaking into your house.</p><p>Your eyes landed on the body on your bed,\nusually still but now moving.</p><p>\u201cJungkook?\u201d you asked, eyes widening.</p><p>Jungkook was tossing and turning, growling\nthings under his breath. </p><p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d you called him once more, walking\ntowards him and kneeling besides him.</p><p>Your hands instantly touched his forehead. It\nwas burning.</p><p>No\u2026 He couldn\u2019t have a fever, please, that wasn\u2019t\na good sign.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, hey,\u201d you whispered.</p><p>He had a frown drawn over his forehead, eyes\nclosed and lips turned upside-down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not alone,\u201d you\nsoftly whispered, leaning closer to him as your hands pushed his bangs away from\nhis sweaty forehead. \u201cWhat hurts, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cT\u2026 Taehyung?\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung\u2019s not here, he\u2019s \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cTaehyung?! Taehyung?!\u201d Jungkook said, starting\nto raise his voice as his movements became brusquer.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, he\u2019s not here, he\u2019s at home, he\u2019s\nsafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d</p><p>He finally opened his eyes and sat himself on\nthe bed, pulling away your hands from him. As soon as he sat, he let out a howl\nof pain, his hands flying to the bandage on his abdomen.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d you mumbled, pushing his shoulders\nand pushing him down on the bed. \u201cDon\u2019t sit.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook then focused his eyes on you, widening\nthem at recognizing your face.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded, trying to calm him. \u201cYeah,\nI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I? Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at my apartment, Taehyung is safe at\nhis, resting and recovering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he hurt?!\u201d Jungkook said, alarmed.</p><p>\u201cJust a small cut on his nose, he didn\u2019t even\nneed stitches. I cleaned his wounds and sent him home.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook sighed in what felt like relief, his\neyes travelling towards the ceiling of your room, a ceiling he knew better than\nthe palm of his hand. He could remember all the countless sleepless nights in\nyour bed staring at the ceiling and mind reeling as you slept peacefully by his\nside. </p><p>You watched as he closed his eyes. You could\nalmost hear the mechanism of his brain working. </p><p>\u201cHow did I get here?\u201d he asked after a few\nseconds.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung called me on Friday night\u2026\u201d you\ncautiously said, not knowing if he would get angry or not. Maybe he didn\u2019t want\nto be there, with you\u2026 \u201cHe told me you needed my help and I went searching for\nyou\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jungkook opened his eyes and stared at you,\nface blank and impassible.</p><p>\u201cAnd you helped me? After all that has\nhappened?\u201d</p><p>You sighed, looking down. \u201cI had no other\noption. It was either that or letting you die in that alley. I wanted to take\nyou to the hospital, but Tae refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all I\u2019ve done to you, you could have\njust gone home and let me die in there,\u201d he lifted his arm cautiously to gently\nbrush away the hair from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe that\u2019s what you deserved,\u201d you\nsaid, a roll of eyes to indicate him that it was far from what you thought. No\none deserved to die for feeling like he did\u2026 Maybe for how he had treated you,\nbut nah, it was not a good enough reason to die. \u201cBut I have something called\nconscience and it would have never let me live with it if I had just left you\nthere to die. Any other decent person would have done the same.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook sighed and the sound of air escaping\nsoftly through his lips was the only noise that was heard in the room for a\ncouple of minutes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have questions? You always have\nthousands,\u201d he said.</p><p>You averted your eyes from the covers of your\nbed, eyes finding his in the darkness of the room. The sky was cloudy and no\nmoonlight seeped into your room. You could see the pained expression on\nJungkook\u2019s face, though. It was almost agonic.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you shrugged, reaching towards your\nbedside table were you kept the painkillers and a glass of water. \u201cTae already\ntold me everything. Here,\u201d you said, handing him a pill and the glass of water.\n\u201cDrink it, it\u2019ll help you with the pain and the fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018Tae told me everything\u2019 mean?\u201d\nJungkook said, eyes suddenly wide as he ignored the pill and the glass of water\nyou were offering him. </p><p>\u201cWhat it means, there\u2019s no other meaning behind\nit. I know what happened and why,\u201d you said.</p><p>Jungkook stared at you for a few more seconds\nand then, he let out a frustrated noise.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d you could hear him say. \u201cI\u2019m gonna\nfucking kill Taehyung. Does Evey know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe begged me not to tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bast \u2013\u201c he grunted, stopping himself. \u201cHe\ncan keep his girl away from all this shit, but instead he has to involve min \u2013\u201c</p><p>He took a deep breath to stop himself once\nagain from finishing that sentence, eyes staring into you. Had he been about to\nsay \u2018mine\u2019? You shook your head at the thought.</p><p>\u201cHe had no other option, Jungkook, he was\ndesperate to save you. You didn\u2019t look good, you were dying.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook closed his eyes and lifted his other\narm to pinch the bridge of his nose, forgetting about the wound situated in the\nleft side of his abdomen. A roaring pain ran through his body, and he let out a\nhowl of pain as he brought both of his hands towards the wound.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d you urged him, kneeling on the bed besides\nhim. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it, and don\u2019t move, the stitches are still a bit fresh and if\nyou apply force towards that spot they\u2019ll break.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed his hands, pushing them away from\nhis wound and resting on his sides. You lit the lamp on your bedside table and\nstarted opening your first-aid kit.</p><p>\u201cI cleaned it this morning, but I\u2019ll clean it\nagain in case some stitches broke.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook nodded and let you take the bandage\noff.</p><p>\u201cSo, you know about\u2026\u201d he began to say.</p><p>\u201cI know about the drugs, the gang, the money,\nSungho, a certain Mr. Kang,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Jungkook growled just as you finished\nyour sentence and finished taking the bandage off. You didn\u2019t know if the curse\nwas directed at one or another.</p><p>\u201cHe also told me about what\u2019s going on and the\ndanger you\u2019re in,\u201d you said. \u201cI won\u2019t let it affect me.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook laughed humorlessly. \u201cYou know nothing\nabout all that shit, Y/N, you can\u2019t just let it not affect you. It doesn\u2019t\ndepend on you anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you come to the alley to get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there anyone else watching us?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know, wasn\u2019t exactly\nlooking around searching for someone spying on us when you were lying on the\nground and bleeding yourself to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so fucked up, if Kang knows about you\nor any of the other people around us\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to do with your world or what\nyou do, Jungkook, he won\u2019t come after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would go after anyone if that means he\nhurts Taehyung or me.\u201d</p><p>You sighed, throwing the dirty gauzes in a\nplastic bag.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean that it would hurt you if that\nKang did anything to me?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook pursed his lips, knowing he was\nplaying near dangerous territory. He opted for staying quiet.</p><p>You stared at him, waiting for an answer.</p><p>Shaking your head, you continued cleaning the\nwound.</p><p>\u201cIt looks good, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not infected\nand the stitches are doing good, you will be able to go home tomorrow and, in\nten days ask someone to take the stitches out \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cOf course it would hurt me,\u201d he interrupted\nyou.</p><p>You acted as if you hadn\u2019t heard him,\ncontinuing with the bandage and covering the wound.</p><p>\u201cIt would kill me if anything happened to you\nbecause of me,\u201d he continued, almost as if he was desperate to say those words.\n\u201cI care about you.\u201d</p><p>Your heart jumped inside your chest, but you\ndidn\u2019t let yourself waver.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you sure do,\u201d you scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019ve shown\nme how much you care about me again and again since we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you? You\u2019ve shown me in the best of ways\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re telling me that after all\nthe shit I\u2019ve gone through because of you, it\u2019s almost insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? It\u2019s insulting? And what is it to see\nyou with Jiwon everywhere I go? Playing the lovely dovey couple?\u201d</p><p>You narrowed your eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t go through that\npath, you know it\u2019s unfair of you throw that in my face when you\u2019ve been\nhooking up with random girls in front of my fucking nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unfair when I\u2019ve asked you repeatedly\nnot to hang out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have never asked anything! The only thing\nyou do is demand! Do this, don\u2019t do that!\u201d you snapped, tired of his bullshit.\n\u201cI\u2019m nothing to you and you\u2019re nothing to me, so you have no right over what I\ncan, or cannot do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah? Am I nothing to you?\u201d he answered,\nvenom laced with his voice. You knew in that exact same moment what he was\nabout to say. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it if you\u2019ve gone <i>through all this shit </i>for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you Jungkook, fuck you,\u201d you spat,\nstanding up from your bed and grabbing the plastic bag with the used supplies. </p><p>You stormed out of your room, finding solace in\nyour equally as dark living room. Throwing away the plastic bag, you drank a\nglass of water and rested your elbows on the cold surface of the kitchen\ncounter, hiding your face in your hands. Why was it all like a cycle? Again and\nagain, you always went back to the start. It was destroying you, and you\nweren\u2019t helping. Getting involved with Jiwon had been childish and stupid of\nyou and getting into that world in the first place had been even more stupid.</p><p>You almost flinched when you felt the warmth of\na body behind you, chest pressing against your back.</p><p>Jungkook hesitantly raised his hands and placed\nthem on your arms.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d you mumbled, flinching away\nfrom his touch.</p><p>He didn\u2019t back away, only leaning closer to\nyou.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get you,\u201d he whispered, and you were about\nto scoff when he spoke again. \u201cAll I do is hurt you, and all you do is come\nback to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be because I\u2019m stupid\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve this, Y/N, I don\u2019t deserve\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you don\u2019t, but here you are and\nhere I am. In love with a person whom I wonder if someday will <i>see </i>me.\u201d</p><p>You hear Jungkook take a deep breath and you\npush him away as you turn around to face him. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act as if you didn\u2019t already know, you\nknew it even before I almost told you,\u201d you scoffed. \u201cTaehyung also told me.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s eyes travelling down to the floor is\nthe only answer you needed.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you realize it?\u201d you asked, crossing\nyour arms over your chest.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWas it when we fucked at your apartment before\nChristmas Holidays, or was it when I was always there for you when you needed\nme like a lost puppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we fucked at my apartment,\u201d he sincerely\nadmitted.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d you nodded. \u201cIt was then\u2026 I should have\nknown,\u201d you nodded with your head. \u201cDid you care about my feelings when you\nwere making out with all those girls in front of me? Or, well, did you ever\ncare at all?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook shook his head. \u201cWere you with Jiwon\njust to throw it back at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jiwon all you care about?\u201d you scoffed,\npushing yourself away from the kitchen counter.</p><p>Jungkook grabbed your upper arm, stopping you\nbefore you could walk around the kitchen aisle and escape from him.</p><p>\u201cYou should stay away from me and everything\nthat surrounds me. The boys, the fights\u2026 Everything.\u201d</p><p>You looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cI care <i>too\nmuch,</i>\u201d he said, his voice so low you could barely hear it in the silence of\nyour apartment.</p><p>\u201cFunny way of showing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever been good at it, but if there\u2019s one\nthing I\u2019m good at, is pushing people away,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>His eyes never left yours as those words left\nhis lips. The intensity of his gaze on yours told you he wanted you to read in\nbetween those lines.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only get hurt if you keep being around\nme,\u201d he breathed, pulling you closer to him.</p><p>You let him push you and move you and do you\nlike a puppet, like you always did, his callous fingers, filled with scars,\nplaying with the strings of your heart.</p><p>\u201cIf you care about someone you don\u2019t push them\naway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do when their safety it\u2019s at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t try to convince you of something you\ndon\u2019t want to be convinced of,\u201d you said, shaking your head.</p><p>He shook his head too.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me about anything.\u201d</p><p>His face was so close to yours you could feel\nevery breath, every sound. You could smell him and feel him and sense him. So\nclose yet so far.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could love you, but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said\nthose words slowly and quietly, knowing that they would feel like daggers to\nyou.</p><p>He leaned a bit closer, and being in the state\nof shock you were, you let him. He leaned his forehead against yours, closing\nhis eyes and feeling you too.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s\nbest.\u201d</p><p>You scrunched your face up in disgust, placing\nyour hands on his chest and pushing him away from you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the couch tonight,\u201d you\nwhispered. \u201cI have to be at the hospital first thing tomorrow morning, I don\u2019t\nwant to see you here when I wake up.\u201d</p><p>That being said, you took some steps back, the\nhand that Jungkook had placed on your left cheek \u2013 and that you hadn\u2019t even\nfelt until then \u2013 falling limply to his side. </p><p>You didn\u2019t even cry that night as you laid on\nyour couch, feeling as if you had already been expecting what had happened. He\ncouldn\u2019t love you because he couldn\u2019t love at all, he had shown you a couple of\ntimes, but you had been na\u00efve enough to let your feelings and stupid daydreams\nblind you.</p><p>His words echoed through your mind.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t love you. Simple as that. </p><p>And when you woke up the next morning, he was\nalready gone.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>But life carried on, it always did.</p><p>You felt as if you had been given a second\nchance, the chance to take the right path once again. A path you had walked\naway from when you had decided to take part in the underground fighting world.</p><p>You left your apartment in March, when all of\nyour savings were long gone from your bank account and you couldn\u2019t afford it\nanymore. It was difficult moving to a dorm after living on your own for almost\nfour years, but it had to be done so you could at least graduate. Plus, working\npart-time at a book store wasn\u2019t that bad either, you had loads of time to work\non your thesis. </p><p>The worst part of it all wasn\u2019t moving to a\ndorm or finding a part-time job, no. The worst part was distancing yourself\nfrom the people that had been your friends during the past six months. They had\nmade you feel so comfortable with yourself, had made you feel so alive taking\nyou out of your comfort zone, that they had almost felt like family. How\ncouldn\u2019t they be called family when they had made you feel as if you fitted in\nso perfectly? </p><p>Of course you still kept in touch with Evey,\nbut always via text. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t stare at her and lie to her, you\ncouldn\u2019t act as if nothing had happened, and you couldn\u2019t stare at her laughing\nand kissing Taehyung knowing everything he was hiding. Yes, he was hiding\neverything from her to protect her, but still, he was lying to her. </p><p>But you weren\u2019t just distancing yourself from\nthe boys because you had realized it was not your world, that you didn\u2019t \u2013 and\ncouldn\u2019t \u2013 belong to a place like that, follow such a lifestyle. You were\ndistancing yourself because you couldn\u2019t stand de idea of seeing Jungkook after\nthose nine words he said to you. </p><p><i>I wish I could love\nyou, but I can\u2019t.</i></p><p>They bounced inside your mind, echoing and\nleaving you numb and tired. You couldn\u2019t think of anything that weren\u2019t those\nnine words, again and again. Why couldn\u2019t he love you? Was if because of you?\nWas it because of the circumstances? Was it because he just <i>couldn\u2019t love?</i></p><p>Whatever the case it was, he couldn\u2019t love you.</p><p>It was the saddest part of it all, because you\nknew that you would never stop loving him. You sometimes wondered how had you\nbeen able to fall in love with someone like him, so cocky and problematic and\nrude. An asshole from head to toe. A boy who lived for violence and breathed\ndanger. A boy who didn\u2019t give a fuck about anything, not even his life, risking\nit again and again. </p><p>But then, memories of you and him lying on your\nbed at three am assaulted you. They were the most dangerous memories of them\nall. Memories of his skin glowing in the moonlight, memories of his scent and\nhis raspy voice. Memories of his round eyes that held a thousand galaxies when\nthe streetlights reflected on them. Memories of his fingertips against your\nskin as he tickled you. Memories of his laugh and his smile \u2013 the same smile\nthat made him look almost innocent. Memories of your stomach hurting at how hard\nhe made you laugh. Memories of you closing your eyes as he hummed one of his\nfavorite songs while he thought you couldn\u2019t hear him. Memories of the random\nconversations you held in the middle of the night. Memories of feeling free,\nand beautiful and infinite while being with him. Memories of him and his, and\nhim again, and his\u2026 And when it started to feel so overwhelming that you\ncouldn\u2019t breathe, it\u2019s when you were lastly reminded of the love you felt for\nhim. </p><p>With the end of winter season and the blooming\nof flowers, things started to feel\u2026 Alright.</p><p>You still thought about Jungkook, but it didn\u2019t\nhurt anymore, nor did you repeat his words in your mind constantly during the\nday. </p><p>Time passed, in every meaning the of the word\npass.</p><p>Time passed and you started thinking that\nmaybe, one day, you would forget about everything that had happened. That you\nwould forget about him.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHow long\ntill you graduate?\u201d your tutor nurse said, smiling at you on your way down to\nthe basement of the hospital. </p><p>\u201cA month\nand a half,\u201d you smiled back, a bit shy.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\nYou\u2019re so close!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\nnervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a\nbit, I\u2019m more nervous about the thesis, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\nare you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Once the\ndoors of the elevator opened, you both stepped out of it and started walking\ntowards the changing room. </p><p>\u201cFine, it\u2019s\nalmost finished,\u201d you sighed, relieved. You would have never thought you would\nsay something like that. Your thesis, almost finished\u2026 That sounded like music\nto your ears. \u201cIt only needs a few final touches and\u2026 <i>C\u2019est fini</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ll ace it,\u201d the nurse nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re a great nurse, Y/N, you have future\nin this.\u201d</p><p>You bit\nyour lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\nI don\u2019t want to forget why I studied this in the first place, why I love it so\nmuch.\u201d</p><p>You both\nstopped in front of the door of the students\u2019 changing room.</p><p>\u201cThere will\nbe days when you\u2019ll feel like forgetting all about it, but then, you\u2019ll see\nyour patients smiling at you, trusting you with their lives, and you\u2019ll\nremember it.\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cI remember\nit every day, and that\u2019s what keeps me going,\u201d she said. \u201cWould it not be for\nthat; I\u2019d be owning a flower shop right now. Flowers never make you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\nsounds like a good plan B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d\nshe laughed. She patted your back a few times. \u201cHave a good weekend, see you on\nMonday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too,\nsee you on Monday!\u201d</p><p>With the\nfirst days of May, the slightly warmer weather arrived too.</p><p>It was a\nbit late and you had missed your bus, so, instead of waiting twenty minutes for\nthe next one, you decided to take a walk. The night breeze was calm, and the\nsky was completely clear. Your oversized bomber jacket and your headphones were\neverything you needed.</p><p>Plus, the\ndorms were closer to the hospital than your apartment had been.</p><p>It had\nsaddened you, to say goodbye to your independence, to your small living room,\nand your open kitchen. To your bedroom, and your comfy bed, with its fluffy\nsheets and floral cushions, the lights that seeped through the windows each\nnight and the sunrays every morning. It had saddened you to say goodbye to\neverything that had happened inside that apartment, and all the memories you\nhad made in there. But life had to carry on, and that apartment was now part of\nyour past.</p><p>You hummed\nsoftly along with the music playing through your headphones.</p><p>You didn\u2019t\nwant to think about the past now, you were a new Y/N, a new and better Y/N.</p><p>The music\nblocked you form the outside world as you kept walking through the now familiar\nstreets of your new neighborhood.</p><p> \u201cMhmm\u2026\u201d you hummed.</p><p>Your eyes\ntravelled across the empty streets, only you and the streetlamps in them. As\nyour eyes focused on the shadow that the streetlights casted of your figure,\nyou noticed a second shadow.</p><p>Immediately,\nyou unlocked your phone and turned off the volume. Nothing.</p><p>You looked\nagain at the sidewalk. The shadow was there, just a few meters away from yours.</p><p>Breath\ncatching in your throat, you sped up, your footsteps becoming quicker and\nshorter. Your heart started beating wildly inside your chest and your whole body\nprepared itself to start running.</p><p>Taking off\nyour headphones, you looked backwards. There it, was, the shadow that had been\nfollowing you in the shape of a tall, big man. His dark eyes met yours.</p><p>You gasped\nand immediately started running. </p><p>Running ha\nnever been your strong point, but you weren\u2019t far from your dorm building and\nthe adrenaline pumping through your veins made you run faster and resist more.</p><p>You began\nhearing the heavy footsteps behind you once you turned around the next corner.\nYou could already see your building\u2026</p><p>Trying to\nbe smart, you thought about misleading the man and taking a sharp turn. If you\nran towards your dorm, you would be safe tonight but he would know where you\nlived and he would be waiting for you the next time you walked out of the\nbuilding. </p><p>Without\nthinking twice, you took a turn to your left in the first street you found. It\nwas a bit dark, only a few old streetlamps lighting the place. You kept\nrunning, trying to reach the other side where it would lead to a bigger street.\nBut your luck wasn\u2019t with you that night, and instead of a street you had found\na alleyway. And it didn\u2019t have a way out of it.</p><p>Your body\ncrashed against the fence, heavy breaths leaving your lips in erratic puffs as\nyour knuckles hit the fence with rage. Fuck. </p><p>Pure fear\nsettled in your body as you turned around, finding the man walking towards you\nwith a mischievous smile on his face. He was walking slowly, knowing \u2013 just\nlike you knew \u2013 that you didn\u2019t have a way out of that. </p><p>Your eyes scanned\nthe place, your self-defense classes mode on. You tried to find a place where\nyou could escape the man and run away from that alley. Maybe, if you let him\napproach you some more and then took a sharp turn to your right and ran towards\nthe opening of the alley\u2026</p><p>You stood\nstill, letting the man approach you.</p><p>Just when\nhe walked closer to you, a streetlamp lighted his features. Your breath got\ncaught in your throat as you recognized him. He was Jiwon\u2019s brother.</p><p>He laughed,\nthe sound echoing around the place. He could see the recognition in your eyes,\nhe could smell your fear.</p><p>\u201cNice to\nsee you again, doll,\u201d he said in a low voice that sent shivers running down\nyour spine.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\ncould say the same,\u201d you said in between erratic breaths.</p><p>You had to\nbe strong, or at least, act as if you were.</p><p>\u201cWhy are\nyou so scared?\u201d he purred. \u201cI just wanna talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you\nremember what happened to you the last time you tried talking to me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes\nshone with danger.</p><p>\u201cOf course\nI do\u2026 I think I remember telling you I didn\u2019t like bad girls, huh? They all\nneed to be taught a lesson. Well, I still think the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\nwanna teach me some bad self-defense lesson, save it, I already know everything\nI need.\u201d</p><p>The man\nsmirked, his hand reaching for something in the back pocket of his jeans. When\nit came back, you saw something metallic in his hand. A low click sounded\nbefore a knife appeared. The dim light in the alleyway reflected on its blade.</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah?\nWell, I think your stupid self-defense lessons didn\u2019t teach you anything about\nknives, huh? Do you really know everything you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call\nthe police.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed\nyour phone with more strength in your hands, protecting it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid\nthat, if you do, you won\u2019t be able to tell them anything when they arrive.\u201d</p><p>You gulped.\n</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nsuch a great coward if you need a knife against an unarmed person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call it\nbeing prudent, I won\u2019t take risks tonight,\u201d he said, voice low as he approached\nyou some more.</p><p>That was\nit, it was your last chance of running away.</p><p>Blinking a\nfew times, you didn\u2019t even give him enough time to process what you were about\nto do. You avoided him, taking a turn to your right and running towards the\nentrance of the alleyway. Your footsteps were quick, but your legs weren\u2019t as\nlong as his and soon, you felt a grip on your bomber jacket.</p><p>He pulled\nyou backwards until your back crashed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhere do\nyou think you\u2019re going? We still haven\u2019t talked,\u201d he growled in your ear,\ngrabbing strands of your hair and forcing you towards the end of the alleyway\nonce again.</p><p>You started\nto scream, but his hand clasped itself over your mouth.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he\npurred. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone interrupting us, do we?\u201d</p><p>You opened\nyour mouth, but not to scream. You parted your lips and sunk your teeth on the\npalm of his hand. You bit with strength until you felt the skin tearing\nunderneath your teeth, and the man let out a strangled cry.</p><p>He let go\nof you for some seconds, enough for you to try to escape again, but his other\nhand was still holding your hair and he yanked you backwards.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to a person who\u2019s trying to talk to you\u2026 That\u2019s\nrude.\u201d</p><p>You stood\nstill and felt his knee hitting the bottom of your back. Numb with pain, you\nfell on your knees. Your hands fled back to hold the sore area, and you closed\nyour eyes, fighting to not cry. </p><p>\u201cAre you\ngoing to stay still now?\u201d he growled, crouching on the floor before you. \u201cI\ncould have hit you harder, I could break a couple of vertebras\u2026 Maybe you\nwouldn\u2019t be able to escape then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou want from me?\u201d you said through gritted teeth, head hanging low.</p><p>He grabbed\nyour hair once again and forced you to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the\none doing the questions here, alright?\u201d he spat. You stood quiet; mouth shut.\n\u201cAlright?!\u201d he repeated, yanking your hair upwards.</p><p>\u201cA-alright,\u201d\nyou stuttered.</p><p>\u201cGood\ngirl,\u201d he smiled, and his smile almost made you puke. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure a little\nnurse like you can tell what things I can do to you to make you suffer without\nhaving to kill you, right?\u201d</p><p>Your lower\nlip trembled, but you fought against yourself and your fear to remain\nunbothered.</p><p>\u201cAnswer\nme,\u201d he growled through clenched teeth. \u201cEach time I ask you something I want\nyou to answer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright\nand right are rhetorical questions,\u201d you said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if you know\nwhat a rhetorical question is, but it doesn\u2019t need to be answered.\u201d</p><p>A harsh\nblow was delivered to your cheek, making your neck snap to the side in a harsh\nmovement. You turned your head back to look at him, not wanting to miss any of\nhis movements.</p><p>\u201cYou think\nyou\u2019re brave for answering me like that? You\u2019re more stupid than I thought,\u201d he\nsaid, his smirk reappearing on his lips. \u201cI\u2019d love to have Jeon here so he\ncould see what I\u2019m about to do to you.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes\nwidened as you saw him lean closer to you. You tried to stand up, but he\ngrabbed your hair with strength and kept you pinned to the ground. You closed\nyour eyes, but you could feel his breath against your neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat a\nshame the boss needs you alive\u2026\u201d he sighed and distanced himself from you.</p><p>In a harsh\nmovement, he let go of your hair, your back hitting the ground with a loud\n\u2018humpf\u2019. </p><p>\u201cYou can\nopen your eyes, I\u2019m only going to make you a few questions,\u201d he sighed. \u201cBut of\ncourse, if you don\u2019t behave, you won\u2019t return home untouched.\u201d</p><p>You blinked\nrapidly, blinking away the tears that had begun to pool in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s\nJeon?\u201d he asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d\nyou stuttered, still a bit in shock.</p><p>\u201cYou heard\nme, where\u2019s Jeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow.\u201d</p><p>Jiwon\u2019s\nbrother crouched once again so he was eye-level with you. </p><p>\u201cLying to\nme is not part of behaving like a good girl. C\u2019mon, I will give you a second\nchance. Where\u2019s Jeon Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, I swear.\u201d</p><p>The man\nnarrowed his eyes at you.</p><p>\u201cHow can\nyou not know if you\u2019re his girl?\u201d</p><p>At the\nmention of you as Jungkook\u2019s girl, your heart skipped a beat. How could you be\nso weak for him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\nhis girl, and I\u2019ve never been. I don\u2019t see where he is, nor I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you\nneed a third chance? Alright, where\u2019s Jeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nalready told you! I don\u2019t know! I haven\u2019t seen him in months, I haven\u2019t heard\nfrom him or any of his friends either!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\nabout that friend of yours that\u2019s with Kim?\u201d</p><p>You gritted\nyour teeth at the mention of Evey.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kept\nin contact with her, but we never talk about Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>The man\nstared into your eyes as if searching for something. You held his gaze. You\nwere telling the truth, there was no way you would break the stare contest\nfirst.</p><p>\u201cBut you\nonce were with him, you must know where he goes when he wants to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never\nknew him that well,\u201d you breathed. It hurt, but that wasn\u2019t a lie either. </p><p>He grabbed\nhis knife with more strength for you to see it.</p><p>\u201cYou better\nnot be lying to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\ndon\u2019t know where he is, but if I\u2019m being honest, if I knew, I wouldn\u2019t tell you\neither.\u201d</p><p>The man\narched a brow in understanding. </p><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d he\nmocked you. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with Jeon\u2026 That explains everything. Poor girl,\u201d he\npouted.</p><p>You\nclenched your teeth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nneed to punish you or teach you any lesson, falling in love with Jeon Jungkook\nit\u2019s enough suffering on itself,\u201d he laughed. You closed your eyes, somehow his\nwords hurt more than his blows had. \u201cMy brother told me about it, though. He\nthought you were stupid too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJiwon\nknows you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJiwon was\nthe one who told me where you would be and where I would be able to find you,\u201d\nhe smirked. \u201cAre you na\u00efve enough to think that my brother approached you just\nbecause he found you pretty and funny? Well\u2026 You caught feelings for Jeon, so\nyeah, you\u2019re na\u00efve enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew\nyour brother was using me just to return the favor to Jungkook, I just took\nadvantage of that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you\nwant to know where Jungkook is?\u201d</p><p>The man\nclicked his tongue. \u201cI told you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the one doing the questions\nhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and\nyour brother work for that Mr. Kang man, don\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you wanna find\nJungkook? Because you weren\u2019t able to finish your work with him.\u201d</p><p>Jiwon\u2019s\nbrother narrowed his eyes.</p><p>He grabbed\nyour face with one of his huge hands, forcing you to stare straight at him.</p><p>\u201cListen to\nme, doll,\u201d he spat. \u201cYou\u2019re doing fine by staying out of this, but it\u2019s too\nlate to forget about you. Find Jeon and tell him that he better fight the\nwrestling final in two weeks. If he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll start interrogating people\u2026\nAnd this time, it will be people he loves and not a girl he used to fuck and\nthat now is stupidly in love with him, understood?\u201d</p><p>His words\nfelt like pure ice sinking into the bottom of your heart.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood?\u201d\nhe said, grabbing your jaw.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you\nbreathed.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he\nsaid, letting go of you. Your jaw hurt from his tight grip. \u201cNow carry on with\nyour life and don\u2019t do anything stupid, we\u2019re keeping a close eye on you.\nFinish your thesis, graduate, move from this shitty city and find a boy who\ndeserves you and loves you back.\u201d</p><p>And with\nthat, he turned around and disappeared from the alley, leaving you alone.</p><p>Everything\nyou had been feeling since you found out you were being followed, downed on\nyou. You grabbed your knees and hid your face in between them, letting your\ntears fall freely and the sobs interrupt your breaths. </p><p>His words\nhad hurt more than his blows and threats, and that was what scared you the\nmost.</p></p>",

That\u2019s how the\nconversation ended.</p><p>Soon, you were running through the mass of\nbodies, texting Evey and letting her know you hadn\u2019t been feeling alright and\nthat you had gone home. </p><p>The uber arrived in fifteen minutes \u2013 the\nlongest fifteen minutes of your life \u2013 and as soon as you climbed on the\nbackseat, you opened the texting app and recited the address Taehyung had sent\nyou.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t far from there, in the outskirts of\nthe city.</p><p>Your mind was racing as your eyes followed the\nstreetlamps that looked like fairy lights from the inside of the car. At some\npoint, you closed your eyes and started taking deep breaths, feeling your heart\nin your throat. </p><p>Jungkook.</p><p>Was he alright? Had something happened to him?</p><p>Your palms were sweating, cold sweat, and they\nwere trembling like crazy, little veins tracing your skin as your knuckles\nturned white from the force with which you were balling your hands into fists.</p><p>A thousand scenarios were running through your\nhead, each one worse than the others.</p><p>\u201cMiss,\u201d the uber driver told you once the car\nhad come to a stop.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t even realized you had reached your\ndestination, too busy closing your eyes and trying to stop your heart from\nfalling from your mouth. </p><p>You paid him, not even waiting to pick the\nchange and ran out of the car. Following Maps in your phone, you ran through\nthe deserted streets. </p><p>You found Taehyung in the entrance of a dark\nalley, looking desperate and wild.</p><p>\u201cTae!\u201d you shouted as soon as you saw him.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he shouted back.</p><p>You threw yourself at him \u2013 if you hadn\u2019t done\nthat, you would have probably fallen face-first onto the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jungkook? Is he okay? What happened? I\n\u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cY/N, calm down,\u201d Taehyung said, grabbing you\nfrom your shoulders as you tried to look behind him. \u201cWe need you with a cold\nmind, please relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you ask me to relax when you told me\nJungkook needs me?\u201d you said, bewildered. \u201cWhere\u2019s him?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s sighed and let go of you. </p><p>You followed him through the alley until you\nreached the spot in between some trash cans and a fence. </p><p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d you couldn\u2019t help but scream as\nsoon as you saw his body limp, half of it fallen onto the ground, half resting\non the brick wall behind him.</p><p>You kneeled beside him, instantly reaching out\nto touch him. </p><p>All plans and stupidity being left aside, you\nstarted mumbling his name.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, hey, Jungkook, can you hear me?\nJungkook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s unconscious,\u201d Taehyung said from behind\nyou. \u201cI\u2019ve tried waking him up, but I think he hit his head pretty hard against\nthe ground.\u201d</p><p>You then repaired in Jungkook\u2019s appearance, for\nreal. He had blood dripping down his nose, and a dark bruise was forming in one\nof his cheeks. He had a small cut on his lower lip, and his grey hoodie was\ndirty. They were bruises, but bruises that weren\u2019t unusual for him. </p><p>It was the blood stain that was growing on one\nside of his hoodie that caught your attention.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d you gasped, clasping one hand over\nyour mouth. \u201cBut\u2026 Oh my god. He has been shot!\u201d</p><p>You looked at Taehyung, who was looking\nincredibly guilty. He also had bruises all over his face, and he didn\u2019t look\nany better than Jungkook did, except for the fact that he had no gunshot hole\nin his jumper, nor did he had stains of blood. </p><p>\u201cW\u2026 What the fuck happened?!\u201d you asked, your\npointer and middle finger pressing over Jungkook\u2019s carotid artery to find his\npulse. \u201cHe has been shot, oh my god\u2026\u201d you kept mumbling.</p><p>When you felt a soft thump beneath your\nfingertips you relaxed a bit.</p><p>Taehyung wasn\u2019t answering, he just couldn\u2019t\nanswer to that question in that moment, and your mind was working so fast that\nyou didn\u2019t even care.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 Doesn\u2019t matter right now,\u201d you said,\ntrying to calm yourself. \u201cWe need to take him to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?! No, he can\u2019t go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has been shot, Taehyung! We need to see if\nthe bullet has reached any vital organs or if there is an internal bleeding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we carry him to the hospital with a bullet\nwound, police will appear, and Jungkook can\u2019t afford that right now,\u201d Taehyung\nsaid in a calmer tone. You didn\u2019t know if he was trying to calm you or if he\nwas trying to calm himself. \u201cThey would start asking questions and\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t take him to the hospital <i>right now</i>, he\u2019ll keep losing blood and\nhe will die!\u201d you said, teeth clenched as you couldn\u2019t understand why Taehyung\nrefused to bring his friend to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I called you, you\u2019re a nurse, you\nshould know how to take care of him.\u201d</p><p>You stood up, taking some steps closer towards\nTaehyung.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a nurse, not a fucking surgeon!\u201d you said,\npausing briefly before continuing. \u201cWait, no, I\u2019m not even a nurse yet! I\u2019m a\nstudent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you work as a nurse at the fights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! But sewing up small cuts and bruises,\nnot healing bullet wounds! I haven\u2019t seen a bullet wound in my life, only studied\nwhat to do with it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know more than I do, then,\u201d\nTaehyung tried reasoning with you. \u201cListen, Y/N, we have no time to waste.\nJungkook\u2019s not going to the hospital, he\u2019d rather die than answer the questions\nof all those fucking cops. If they catch him and get him into jail, it\u2019ll be\nthe end of him, you already know that, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>You took some steps back from Taehyung and\nJungkook, threading your fingers in your hair and pulling from the roots in a\ndesperate act. It all felt like a nightmare, a really fucking bad nightmare.</p><p>Lifting your eyes just a tiny bit to stare at\nJungkook\u2019s unmoving body made you sick. </p><p>\u201cArgh\u2026\u201d you growled, drawing your hands down\nyour face and closing your eyes as you did so.</p><p>You had studied a lot of things but putting them\ninto practice was a completely different thing. And, being a bit egoistic, you\nwouldn\u2019t be able to live with the idea that you had killed Jungkook. On the\nother hand, you knew what Taehyung was saying was true. Jungkook already had\nsome issues with the law, he had escaped from the hospital when he had that\nmotorbike accident and you guess he had way more issues than that, let alone\nwhatever shit was he into at the moment. If you took him to the hospital and\nthey saw his bullet wound, they would immediately call the police and they\nwould start making too many questions\u2026 </p><p>\u201cAlright, alright\u2026\u201d you mumbled. </p><p>You patted your cheeks a couple of times before\nopening your eyes and staring at Taehyung. You were only a few months away from\ngraduating, you were practically a nurse. You could do that.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d you nodded, looking at Taehyung.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take him to my apartment, I have some medical supplies in there\u2026\u201d</p><p>You started counting internally all the\nsupplies you had at home. Some steri-strips, needles, disinfectant, sterile\ngloves\u2026 Even some intravenous saline.</p><p>\u201cGreat, great,\u201d Taehyung nodded. \u201cMy car is\njust parked a few streets away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo grab it, I\u2019ll be here with Jungkook waiting\nfor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, but he stayed there watching\nyou. You could see it in his face, he was just as affected as you were.</p><p>\u201cGo, don\u2019t worry, everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p><i>Or so you hoped.</i></p><p>Taehyung nodded a third time before turning\naround and running towards his car.</p><p>You were still pressing your scarf over\nJungkook\u2019s bullet wound when Taehyung walked inside your apartment carrying him\nin his arms.</p><p>He was still unconscious, but his breathing was\nsteady and his heartbeat strong.</p><p>\u201cPut him on my bed, last door at the end of the\ncorridor,\u201d you said as soon as you stepped a foot inside your apartment,\nrushing to close the door behind you and take your coat off, leaving it on the\nfloor.</p><p>\u201cKeep pressing on his wound with my scarf!\u201d you\nordered Taehyung as you grabbed your supplies from the cupboard under the TV\nand the bathroom.</p><p>It was a shocking sight, to see Jungkook in\nyour bed again, that time for way more different reasons. </p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d you said to yourself, trying to\norder the thoughts that were running through your mind. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung stood still, staring at you with uncertain\neyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asked in a soft voice.</p><p>It took you some more seconds to go back to\nreality and answer him.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d you finally said. \u201cTake his hoodie\nand the rest of his clothes off, leaving him only in his boxers. I\u2019ll start\npreparing everything.\u201d</p><p>As Taehyung undressed Jungkook, you rushed to\nwash your hands in the bathroom, put some gloves on and start setting your\nsterile field. </p><p>\u201cGauzes, disinfectant\u2026 Scalpel\u2026\u201d you counted.</p><p>\u201cWhere do I leave his clothes?\u201d Taehyung asked.</p><p>\u201cLeave them inside the shower, I\u2019ll take care\nof them later.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and disappeared from you room. You\ntook that as a chance to look back at Jungkook. He was paler and paler by each\npassing second. </p><p>\u201cHold on, please, hold on,\u201d you desperately\npleaded, passing your hand over his forehead. At least he didn\u2019t have a fever,\nso the wound or the organs affected by it weren\u2019t infected yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back, I\u2019m back,\u201d Taehyung said, kneeling\nat the other side of the bed.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know why you both repeated each\nthing two times each time one of you spoke. It was as if you were reassuring\nyourselves.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded. \u201cGrab my nightstand lamp\nand give me some light please.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung did as you said while you climbed on\ntop of your bed, careful not to touch anything from your sterile field.</p><p>Your hands were trembling as you touched the\narea around the bullet wound, pressing and pinching, trying to find any signs\nof any organ being affected or bleeding.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like it hasn\u2019t reached any abdominal\norgan,\u201d you said, your hands still feeling around Jungkook\u2019s taut stomach.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good sign, a very good one.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung simply nodded, watching you work with\ncareful eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll se if I can get the bullet out.\u201d</p><p>You cleaned the wound and the area around with\nsome gauzes and water with soap.</p><p>Your hands trembled even more as you took off\nyour normal gloves and put some sterile ones on. Once you were fully sterile,\nyou grabbed the surgical tweezers and opened the wound. It was as if a heavy weight\nhad been lifted off from your shoulders as soon as you saw the metallic shine\nof the bullet. </p><p>Luckily, the shoot hadn\u2019t been to up-close and\nthe bullet hadn\u2019t gone too far into Jungkook\u2019s abdomen, barely reaching the\nmuscle tissue.</p><p>Grabbing another pair of tweezers, you\ncarefully got the bullet out of Jungkook\u2019s abdomen. </p><p>Without giving yourself time to think about\nwhat you had just done, you started sewing up the wound, careful to leave both\nends next to each other so they could scar quickly. Then, you applied some\nantiseptic and steri-strip in some of the places of the wound that looked more\nfragile to you.</p><p>Covering the wound with a fresh dressing, you\npatted the area, making sure the hemorrhage had stopped.</p><p>\u201cIs it done?\u201d Taehyung asked when he saw you\nstaying still.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s done,\u201d you nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd now what?\u201d </p><p>You stared at Jungkook\u2019s face. He had started\nsweating, probably from the pain he had been feeling despite being unconscious.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in God, Taehyung?\u201d you asked\nout of the blue. Before he could answer, you did. \u201cBecause all we can do now is\npray.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>After taking care of the rest of Jungkook\u2019s\nwounds, you cleaned everything and threw it in the bin. </p><p>You cleaned the medical supplies from\nJungkook\u2019s blood in the sink of your bathroom, the marble material turning a\nreddish color as you asked yourself how many more times you were going to clean\nJungkook\u2019s blood.</p><p>Closing the tap, you looked upwards and stared\nat your reflection in the mirror. Hair greasy and disheveled, mascara ruined,\ndark circles under your eyes and pale skin, eyes red and puffy from crying and\nbeing tired. You looked great.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s him?\u201d you asked, entering your room were\nJungkook was still fighting, lying underneath your blankets.</p><p>You had switched on the heating so he wouldn\u2019t\nturn cold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Taehyung sighed, letting his\nhead fall onto his hands.</p><p>You walked towards him and placed your hand\nover his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, I have to take care of that cut above\nyour nose.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung sat at the feet of your bed as you\ncleaned his wounds and applied some disinfectant and antibacterial cream. </p><p>\u201cCan you explain me now what happened?\u201d you\nsighed. \u201cAnd don\u2019t just tell me that you got shot, tell me the reason why.\u201d</p><p>You could feel Taehyung sighing, his shoulders\nslumping.</p><p>You dabbed delicately the cut above his nose\nwith a cotton pad soaked in disinfectant.</p><p>\u201cFine\u2026 But please, don\u2019t tell Evey. Nor about\nthis, not about what I\u2019m going to tell you. Please.\u201d</p><p>You stared into his eyes, a delicate frown\ndrawing itself over your forehead. You stopped your movements with the cotton\npad and leant back a few centimeters.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Taehyung?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so wrong about it that Evey can\u2019t know\nanything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, promise me you won\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>You opened and closed your mouth like a fish\nout of water.</p><p>\u201cTae, she\u2019s my best friend, you can\u2019t ask\nsomething like that from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, if you don\u2019t do it for me, do it for\nher,\u201d Taehyung desperately pleaded. \u201cThe less she knows, the better. She\u2019ll be\nsafer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me, Tae,\u201d you said, voice\nmerely a whisper as you sat on the balls of your feet, staring with wide eyes\nat the man sitting at the feet of your bed.</p><p>\u201cPromise me, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I promise you,\u201d you stuttered. \u201cTell me\nalready, what have you and Jungkook gotten yourselves into?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung took a deep breath and leant forward,\nhis elbows resting on his thighs as his head hang low.</p><p>\u201cWe stopped when we met Sungho,\u201d he started.\n\u201cHe told us about the fights and said we could make a lot of money, that we\nwouldn\u2019t have to worry about paying the rent or making ends meet\u2026 Never again.\nHe introduced us to the boys and created a small family. Each one of us found\nin the other boys the father, mother, brother, sister, they had never had.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung took a brief pause, a long sigh\nescaping his lips.</p><p>\u201cSungho saw potential in Jungkook, and started\nfocusing on him, training him, bringing him to the underground fights,\nintroducing him to his contacts\u2026 And once he started fighting, Jungkook became\nSungho\u2019s own little goose that laid the golden eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was half a year ago,\u201d you nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah, almost two years ago. Jungkook became\nobsessed with fighting and wining and training and being the best. If he lost a\nfight, he would stay the whole night in the gym, training until he couldn\u2019t\neven lift his arms. He didn\u2019t stop until he won Bobby, and that\u2019s exactly what\nSungho wanted\u2026 But now he wants more, and Jungkook being a champion is not\nenough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what sense?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung lifted his eyes so he was staring at\nyou.</p><p>\u201cHe wants more money, more power, more and\nmore. I guess he has dragged us with him\u2026\u201d</p><p>You frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about,\nTaehyung?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung gulped.</p><p>\u201cSungho heard about what Jungkook and I did\nbefore he met us, and he took interest in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook interest in what?\u201d you pushed him. \u201cWhat\ndid you and Jungkook do?\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed your question was\nsending chills down your spine. </p><p>\u201cTae\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe dealt, Y/N. We were dealers.\u201d</p><p>You blinked rapidly as the words sank in. They.\nWere. Dealers.</p><p>\u201cAs in\u2026\u201d gulp. \u201cDeal\u2026 With\u2026 With drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung breathed. \u201cWe worked for an\nimportant drug lord who owns the business in this city. He has people\neverywhere, he controls everywhere and he basically is everywhere. We were\nnothing but two young dealers who dealt at university parties and clubs at the\noutskirts of the city, but we were <i>his </i>drug\ndealers. I don\u2019t know if you know this\u2026 But once you work as a dealer for a\ndrug lord, there is no going back, you can\u2019t just decide that you want a normal\njob one day and disappear, no. It\u2019s forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how did the two of you get out of that?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung shrugged his shoulders, averting his\neyes from yours once again. He started at his still unconscious friend lying on\nyour bed, naked torso heaving slowly.</p><p>\u201cWe spoke to him, payed our debt and swore we\nwould never talk. He had the names of our families, the directions of our\nhomes\u2026 We had too much to lose if we talked, so we never did. He kept an eye on\nus in case we betrayed him, and we never did\u2026 Until a few months ago. Sungho heard\nthat we were dealers and started asking questions about it. Jungkook and I\nthought it was normal, since he was our new boss. But then, he started asking\nabout money, and how the business worked. He told us he had a contact in the\nnorth of the country that could give him good quality material for us to say.\nWe told him that it would be impossible, that Mr. Kang, our previous boss,\nowned the entirety of the city and that he didn\u2019t like rivalry. He wouldn\u2019t\nallow any other drug lord in his city.\u201d</p><p>Another pause, Taehyung shook his head,\nmemories assaulting his mind.</p><p>\u201cBut Sungho didn\u2019t listen to us, he just saw\nthe money and the power it would bring him. He said he had contacts and that\nMr. Kang wouldn\u2019t be able to touch us. He\u2026 He put it so great that we only saw\nthe extra money we would earn, and we agreed. We became his dealers \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d you interrupted him, asking him to stop\nwith a raised hand. \u201cAre you telling me\u2026 Are you telling me that you and\nJungkook have been dealing drugs this whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>A image came to your head\u2026 How could have you\nbeen so na\u00efve? That night, at the party before the Christmas holidays you had\nseen it all. Sungho had been searching around for Jungkook, and Jungkook had\nbeen missing. You remembered seeing him in that dark alley, those girls\nlaughing as they walked away from him. You remembered how he stayed behind,\nkeeping something in the pockets of his jeans\u2026 Fuck.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Tae,\u201d you gasped, covering your\nmouth with the palm of your hand.</p><p>\u201cMr. Kang heard about us, discovered Sungho\u2019s\nbusiness and he put a price to our heads. We\u2019ve hidden from them thanks to\nSungho\u2019s contacts, but his contacts aren\u2019t everywhere, and tonight, they found\nus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, oh my god,\u201d you mumbled, hiding\nyour face behind your hands, threading your hands through your hair. \u201cOh my\nfucking god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were lucky that a police car passed by and\nthey ran away, but I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be so lucky next time,\u201d Taehyung\ncarried on. \u201cThey will eventually find us, and when they do\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d you repeated, lifting your head up\nand staring at him. </p><p>\u201cThis is why you can\u2019t tell Evey,\u201d he said,\nshaking his head. \u201cI can\u2019t risk putting her in more danger than she already is.\nThey\u2019ll go after our loved ones, it\u2019s best if we kept them away from all this.\u201d</p><p>You nodded on autopilot, your mind still\nprocessing that a huge drug lord wanted Jungkook and Taehyung dead, and\nprobably, Evey and the rest of your friends too.</p><p>\u201cThis is too much, too dangerous. You know what\nthose guys are like, Taehyung? They have all the money in the world, people\nmove because of money, people would do anything for them and a couple of\nbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, I worked for him, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you reach out to me, then? This is too\nmuch for me, I don\u2019t belong here, this is not my world. Why didn\u2019t you tell any\nof the other boys? They would know how to help you better than I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know about this, any of this,\u201d\nTaehyung said, shaking his head. \u201cAnd they can\u2019t know, for the same reason as\nEvey can\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>You scoffed. \u201cBut I can? Am I not in danger or\nwhat?\u201d </p><p>Taehyung pursed his lips. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry I have involved you in this,\nI\u2019m sure Jungkook will never forgive me for this\u2026\u201d Taehyung said, eyes glossy\nas he searched for your eyes in the dim light of your room. \u201cBut I was\ndesperate and Jungkook had been shot\u2026 You were my only option.\u201d</p><p>You nodded your head slowly, sinking everything\nin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not fair, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so, so\nsorry. Jungkook is like a brother to me, I love him so much, I couldn\u2019t bother\nthe idea of losing him and I had to set my priorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t one of them,\u201d you said, nodding\nslowly.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it isn\u2019t like \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you interrupted him. \u201cI get it Tae, I do.\nI just wish I was someone\u2019s priority for once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already are\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Taehyung stuttered,\nstopping himself. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fine,\u201d you shrugged,\ngrabbing the things you had used to heal Taehyung\u2019s wounds and putting them\ninside a plastic bag.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. I also called you because I knew\nas soon as you knew it was about Jungkook, you wouldn\u2019t be able to refuse. I\nknew you wouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>Your head snapped up to his just when you were\nabout to stand up from the floor. </p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung scoffed softly.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Y/N, everyone can see you\u2019re crazy\nabout Jungkook,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could bite water if it was for him. You\u2019re in\nlove with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to deny it,\u201d Taehyung was the one\nwho interrupted you then. \u201cI can see how you look at him and how you act all\ntough and indifferent around him, but each time he\u2019s hurt you hurt for him,\neach time he\u2019s happy you smile and each time he stares at you, you blush.\nYou\u2019re so in love it hurts to see from afar.\u201d</p><p>Your nostrils flared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitive, I\u2019m gonna kill Evey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvey? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? She didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already knew you were in love with\nJungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d you shushed him loudly. \u201cHe could hear\nus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, he\u2019s unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they say that the hearing is the last\nsense a person loses when they\u2019re unconscious.\u201d</p><p>Although, you didn\u2019t know why you were worrying\nso much about Jungkook hearing Taehyung\u2019s words when he already knew you loved\nhim. </p><p>\u201cThis is so fucked up,\u201d you said, turning\nserious once again. You rubbed your temples with both hands, a headache\nstarting to grow.</p><p>\u201cIt is, and I\u2019m so sorry for getting you in the\nmiddle of all this but\u2026 Jungkook needed you.\u201d</p><p>You nodded, finally standing up from the floor\nand grabbing the plastic bag in which all your used medical supplies had been\nkept.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d you sighed. \u201cI would probably do\nit all over again even after knowing that some bad ass drug lord and half of\nthe population of this city is after you.\u201d</p><p>You heard Taehyung sigh and mumble something\nunder his breath, but you didn\u2019t give it a second thought. </p><p>After all that had happened, and all the new\ninformation you had gotten, you were drained from all energy and you needed to\nrest.</p><p>\u201cYou can stay here tonight, or well, for as\nlong as you want,\u201d you told Taehyung. \u201cYou can sleep on the couch tonight, I\u2019ll\nsleep in my armchair and look after Jungkook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired, you should sleep on the couch\ninstead. I\u2019ll look after \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been punched on the face and my nose\nhasn\u2019t been nearly broken, <i>you </i>should\nsleep on the couch. And you should text Evey and tell her your right or\nsomething before she shows up in here panicking. Tell her you\u2019ll be busy this\nweekend and that you won\u2019t be able to see her.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung helped you preparing the couch after\nsending Evey a text. You ate some leftovers you had in your fridge while you both\nchattered about anything and everything at the same time. After a warm red tea,\nyou took a very much needed hot shower, cleaned your face and got rid of all\nthe ruined mascara, blow-dried your hair and put on your comfiest pyijama.</p><p>With a blanket and your mobile charger in mind,\nyou entered your room.</p><p>Jungkook was lying on the same position you had\nfirst left him. The moonlight seeped in your room at that hour of the night,\njust like any other night, and just like many nights before, its milky light poured\nover Jungkook\u2019s skin. It looked as if he was made of marble, so perfect and\ndefined. But, as your eyes traveled down his naked torso, you found the\nbandages covering his abdomen and flinched.</p><p>Cautiously, you took a seat next to him on the\nbed, cleaning the sweat from his forehead and making sure he didn\u2019t have a\nfever. Passing a cloth soaked in cool water all over his face, you observed\nevery feature of his. From the little mole under his lower lip, to his big\nnose, to his round eyes. </p><p>You were just torturing yourself, so you shook\nyour head and sat on the armchair that decorated one of the corners of your\nroom. With your blanket on and your mobile charging by your side, your eyes on\nJungkook, you started drifting off to sleep.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>The weekend passed by in slow motion.</p><p>You barely went out of your room, unless you\nhad to go to the bathroom or you felt hungry. You were afraid Jungkook\u2019s state\nwould worsen when you weren\u2019t in the room with him, so you just stayed there,\nass glued to your armchair as your eyes never left his unmoving form.</p><p>Three times a day, you cleaned him with warm\nwater, to wash away all the sweat from his body. You also changed the bandage\nthat covered his wound, observing that it wasn\u2019t getting infected or that the\nstitches didn\u2019t separate form each other so the wound could open. </p><p>It was pure torture to you, both physically and\nmentally, the thought of Jungkook dying in your bed haunting you every night. </p><p>If you had taken him to the hospital, they\nwould have extracted the bullet in an operating room, everything sterile. They\nwould have transfused him some blood too, making up for all he lost. But you\nhad no operating room, nor blood you could transfuse him, you just had your\ngauzes, your bottle of antiseptic and the hope that it would all be enough.</p><p>Jungkook was strong, but you didn\u2019t know how\nfar that strength could go.</p><p>Taehyung had gone home on Sunday morning,\ntelling Evey that he would be out of town so she didn\u2019t go to his apartment and\nsee his wounded face. You had been avoiding Evey \u2013 again \u2013 as Taehyung had told\nyou to, not wanting her to know about any of that. You had also called to the\nhospital, telling them you were sick and that you wouldn\u2019t be able to go that\nweek. </p><p>The only thing you could do now was wait.</p><p>Should you call his mother? No, you didn\u2019t even\nhave her number and he would kill you if you told your mother about all that.\nIf he didn\u2019t want her to know that he fought, imagine telling her that he dealt\nwith drugs. No. You couldn\u2019t do that to him.</p><p>Inside, you were feeling a mixture of things.\nFrom anger to fear. From resentment to confusion. He had rejected you in the\nworst possible way he could have rejected you, and yet, there you were, taking\ncare of him. Your relationship with Jungkook \u2013 if it could be called that \u2013 was\na spiral of things, and you had grown tired of it. You had never been in love\nbefore, but you were sure love wasn\u2019t supposed to hurt like that.</p><p>After thinking and thinking, you had finally\ndrifted off to sleep once more, mind blank as you let your body rest for once.</p><p>It was the noise of grunts and movement that\nsnapped you awake.</p><p>Confusedly, you blinked a few times, trying to\nadjust your eyes to the darkness in the room. Your neck ached from sleeping\nthree nights in a row in an armchair, and your whole body felt weak, you\nweren\u2019t ready to fight some stranger breaking into your house.</p><p>Your eyes landed on the body on your bed,\nusually still but now moving.</p><p>\u201cJungkook?\u201d you asked, eyes widening.</p><p>Jungkook was tossing and turning, growling\nthings under his breath. </p><p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d you called him once more, walking\ntowards him and kneeling besides him.</p><p>Your hands instantly touched his forehead. It\nwas burning.</p><p>No\u2026 He couldn\u2019t have a fever, please, that wasn\u2019t\na good sign.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, hey,\u201d you whispered.</p><p>He had a frown drawn over his forehead, eyes\nclosed and lips turned upside-down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not alone,\u201d you\nsoftly whispered, leaning closer to him as your hands pushed his bangs away from\nhis sweaty forehead. \u201cWhat hurts, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cT\u2026 Taehyung?\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung\u2019s not here, he\u2019s \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cTaehyung?! Taehyung?!\u201d Jungkook said, starting\nto raise his voice as his movements became brusquer.</p><p>\u201cJungkook, he\u2019s not here, he\u2019s at home, he\u2019s\nsafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d</p><p>He finally opened his eyes and sat himself on\nthe bed, pulling away your hands from him. As soon as he sat, he let out a howl\nof pain, his hands flying to the bandage on his abdomen.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d you mumbled, pushing his shoulders\nand pushing him down on the bed. \u201cDon\u2019t sit.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook then focused his eyes on you, widening\nthem at recognizing your face.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded, trying to calm him. \u201cYeah,\nI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I? Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at my apartment, Taehyung is safe at\nhis, resting and recovering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he hurt?!\u201d Jungkook said, alarmed.</p><p>\u201cJust a small cut on his nose, he didn\u2019t even\nneed stitches. I cleaned his wounds and sent him home.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook sighed in what felt like relief, his\neyes travelling towards the ceiling of your room, a ceiling he knew better than\nthe palm of his hand. He could remember all the countless sleepless nights in\nyour bed staring at the ceiling and mind reeling as you slept peacefully by his\nside. </p><p>You watched as he closed his eyes. You could\nalmost hear the mechanism of his brain working. </p><p>\u201cHow did I get here?\u201d he asked after a few\nseconds.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung called me on Friday night\u2026\u201d you\ncautiously said, not knowing if he would get angry or not. Maybe he didn\u2019t want\nto be there, with you\u2026 \u201cHe told me you needed my help and I went searching for\nyou\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jungkook opened his eyes and stared at you,\nface blank and impassible.</p><p>\u201cAnd you helped me? After all that has\nhappened?\u201d</p><p>You sighed, looking down. \u201cI had no other\noption. It was either that or letting you die in that alley. I wanted to take\nyou to the hospital, but Tae refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all I\u2019ve done to you, you could have\njust gone home and let me die in there,\u201d he lifted his arm cautiously to gently\nbrush away the hair from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe that\u2019s what you deserved,\u201d you\nsaid, a roll of eyes to indicate him that it was far from what you thought. No\none deserved to die for feeling like he did\u2026 Maybe for how he had treated you,\nbut nah, it was not a good enough reason to die. \u201cBut I have something called\nconscience and it would have never let me live with it if I had just left you\nthere to die. Any other decent person would have done the same.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook sighed and the sound of air escaping\nsoftly through his lips was the only noise that was heard in the room for a\ncouple of minutes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have questions? You always have\nthousands,\u201d he said.</p><p>You averted your eyes from the covers of your\nbed, eyes finding his in the darkness of the room. The sky was cloudy and no\nmoonlight seeped into your room. You could see the pained expression on\nJungkook\u2019s face, though. It was almost agonic.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you shrugged, reaching towards your\nbedside table were you kept the painkillers and a glass of water. \u201cTae already\ntold me everything. Here,\u201d you said, handing him a pill and the glass of water.\n\u201cDrink it, it\u2019ll help you with the pain and the fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018Tae told me everything\u2019 mean?\u201d\nJungkook said, eyes suddenly wide as he ignored the pill and the glass of water\nyou were offering him. </p><p>\u201cWhat it means, there\u2019s no other meaning behind\nit. I know what happened and why,\u201d you said.</p><p>Jungkook stared at you for a few more seconds\nand then, he let out a frustrated noise.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d you could hear him say. \u201cI\u2019m gonna\nfucking kill Taehyung. Does Evey know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe begged me not to tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bast \u2013\u201c he grunted, stopping himself. \u201cHe\ncan keep his girl away from all this shit, but instead he has to involve min \u2013\u201c</p><p>He took a deep breath to stop himself once\nagain from finishing that sentence, eyes staring into you. Had he been about to\nsay \u2018mine\u2019? You shook your head at the thought.</p><p>\u201cHe had no other option, Jungkook, he was\ndesperate to save you. You didn\u2019t look good, you were dying.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook closed his eyes and lifted his other\narm to pinch the bridge of his nose, forgetting about the wound situated in the\nleft side of his abdomen. A roaring pain ran through his body, and he let out a\nhowl of pain as he brought both of his hands towards the wound.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d you urged him, kneeling on the bed besides\nhim. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it, and don\u2019t move, the stitches are still a bit fresh and if\nyou apply force towards that spot they\u2019ll break.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed his hands, pushing them away from\nhis wound and resting on his sides. You lit the lamp on your bedside table and\nstarted opening your first-aid kit.</p><p>\u201cI cleaned it this morning, but I\u2019ll clean it\nagain in case some stitches broke.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook nodded and let you take the bandage\noff.</p><p>\u201cSo, you know about\u2026\u201d he began to say.</p><p>\u201cI know about the drugs, the gang, the money,\nSungho, a certain Mr. Kang,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Jungkook growled just as you finished\nyour sentence and finished taking the bandage off. You didn\u2019t know if the curse\nwas directed at one or another.</p><p>\u201cHe also told me about what\u2019s going on and the\ndanger you\u2019re in,\u201d you said. \u201cI won\u2019t let it affect me.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook laughed humorlessly. \u201cYou know nothing\nabout all that shit, Y/N, you can\u2019t just let it not affect you. It doesn\u2019t\ndepend on you anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you come to the alley to get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there anyone else watching us?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know, wasn\u2019t exactly\nlooking around searching for someone spying on us when you were lying on the\nground and bleeding yourself to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so fucked up, if Kang knows about you\nor any of the other people around us\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to do with your world or what\nyou do, Jungkook, he won\u2019t come after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would go after anyone if that means he\nhurts Taehyung or me.\u201d</p><p>You sighed, throwing the dirty gauzes in a\nplastic bag.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean that it would hurt you if that\nKang did anything to me?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook pursed his lips, knowing he was\nplaying near dangerous territory. He opted for staying quiet.</p><p>You stared at him, waiting for an answer.</p><p>Shaking your head, you continued cleaning the\nwound.</p><p>\u201cIt looks good, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not infected\nand the stitches are doing good, you will be able to go home tomorrow and, in\nten days ask someone to take the stitches out \u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201cOf course it would hurt me,\u201d he interrupted\nyou.</p><p>You acted as if you hadn\u2019t heard him,\ncontinuing with the bandage and covering the wound.</p><p>\u201cIt would kill me if anything happened to you\nbecause of me,\u201d he continued, almost as if he was desperate to say those words.\n\u201cI care about you.\u201d</p><p>Your heart jumped inside your chest, but you\ndidn\u2019t let yourself waver.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you sure do,\u201d you scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019ve shown\nme how much you care about me again and again since we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you? You\u2019ve shown me in the best of ways\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re telling me that after all\nthe shit I\u2019ve gone through because of you, it\u2019s almost insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? It\u2019s insulting? And what is it to see\nyou with Jiwon everywhere I go? Playing the lovely dovey couple?\u201d</p><p>You narrowed your eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t go through that\npath, you know it\u2019s unfair of you throw that in my face when you\u2019ve been\nhooking up with random girls in front of my fucking nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unfair when I\u2019ve asked you repeatedly\nnot to hang out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have never asked anything! The only thing\nyou do is demand! Do this, don\u2019t do that!\u201d you snapped, tired of his bullshit.\n\u201cI\u2019m nothing to you and you\u2019re nothing to me, so you have no right over what I\ncan, or cannot do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah? Am I nothing to you?\u201d he answered,\nvenom laced with his voice. You knew in that exact same moment what he was\nabout to say. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it if you\u2019ve gone <i>through all this shit </i>for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you Jungkook, fuck you,\u201d you spat,\nstanding up from your bed and grabbing the plastic bag with the used supplies. </p><p>You stormed out of your room, finding solace in\nyour equally as dark living room. Throwing away the plastic bag, you drank a\nglass of water and rested your elbows on the cold surface of the kitchen\ncounter, hiding your face in your hands. Why was it all like a cycle? Again and\nagain, you always went back to the start. It was destroying you, and you\nweren\u2019t helping. Getting involved with Jiwon had been childish and stupid of\nyou and getting into that world in the first place had been even more stupid.</p><p>You almost flinched when you felt the warmth of\na body behind you, chest pressing against your back.</p><p>Jungkook hesitantly raised his hands and placed\nthem on your arms.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d you mumbled, flinching away\nfrom his touch.</p><p>He didn\u2019t back away, only leaning closer to\nyou.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get you,\u201d he whispered, and you were about\nto scoff when he spoke again. \u201cAll I do is hurt you, and all you do is come\nback to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be because I\u2019m stupid\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve this, Y/N, I don\u2019t deserve\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you don\u2019t, but here you are and\nhere I am. In love with a person whom I wonder if someday will <i>see </i>me.\u201d</p><p>You hear Jungkook take a deep breath and you\npush him away as you turn around to face him. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act as if you didn\u2019t already know, you\nknew it even before I almost told you,\u201d you scoffed. \u201cTaehyung also told me.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s eyes travelling down to the floor is\nthe only answer you needed.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you realize it?\u201d you asked, crossing\nyour arms over your chest.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWas it when we fucked at your apartment before\nChristmas Holidays, or was it when I was always there for you when you needed\nme like a lost puppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we fucked at my apartment,\u201d he sincerely\nadmitted.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d you nodded. \u201cIt was then\u2026 I should have\nknown,\u201d you nodded with your head. \u201cDid you care about my feelings when you\nwere making out with all those girls in front of me? Or, well, did you ever\ncare at all?\u201d</p><p>Jungkook shook his head. \u201cWere you with Jiwon\njust to throw it back at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jiwon all you care about?\u201d you scoffed,\npushing yourself away from the kitchen counter.</p><p>Jungkook grabbed your upper arm, stopping you\nbefore you could walk around the kitchen aisle and escape from him.</p><p>\u201cYou should stay away from me and everything\nthat surrounds me. The boys, the fights\u2026 Everything.\u201d</p><p>You looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cI care <i>too\nmuch,</i>\u201d he said, his voice so low you could barely hear it in the silence of\nyour apartment.</p><p>\u201cFunny way of showing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever been good at it, but if there\u2019s one\nthing I\u2019m good at, is pushing people away,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>His eyes never left yours as those words left\nhis lips. The intensity of his gaze on yours told you he wanted you to read in\nbetween those lines.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only get hurt if you keep being around\nme,\u201d he breathed, pulling you closer to him.</p><p>You let him push you and move you and do you\nlike a puppet, like you always did, his callous fingers, filled with scars,\nplaying with the strings of your heart.</p><p>\u201cIf you care about someone you don\u2019t push them\naway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do when their safety it\u2019s at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t try to convince you of something you\ndon\u2019t want to be convinced of,\u201d you said, shaking your head.</p><p>He shook his head too.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me about anything.\u201d</p><p>His face was so close to yours you could feel\nevery breath, every sound. You could smell him and feel him and sense him. So\nclose yet so far.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could love you, but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said\nthose words slowly and quietly, knowing that they would feel like daggers to\nyou.</p><p>He leaned a bit closer, and being in the state\nof shock you were, you let him. He leaned his forehead against yours, closing\nhis eyes and feeling you too.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s\nbest.\u201d</p><p>You scrunched your face up in disgust, placing\nyour hands on his chest and pushing him away from you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the couch tonight,\u201d you\nwhispered. \u201cI have to be at the hospital first thing tomorrow morning, I don\u2019t\nwant to see you here when I wake up.\u201d</p><p>That being said, you took some steps back, the\nhand that Jungkook had placed on your left cheek \u2013 and that you hadn\u2019t even\nfelt until then \u2013 falling limply to his side. </p><p>You didn\u2019t even cry that night as you laid on\nyour couch, feeling as if you had already been expecting what had happened. He\ncouldn\u2019t love you because he couldn\u2019t love at all, he had shown you a couple of\ntimes, but you had been na\u00efve enough to let your feelings and stupid daydreams\nblind you.</p><p>His words echoed through your mind.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t love you. Simple as that. </p><p>And when you woke up the next morning, he was\nalready gone.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>But life carried on, it always did.</p><p>You felt as if you had been given a second\nchance, the chance to take the right path once again. A path you had walked\naway from when you had decided to take part in the underground fighting world.</p><p>You left your apartment in March, when all of\nyour savings were long gone from your bank account and you couldn\u2019t afford it\nanymore. It was difficult moving to a dorm after living on your own for almost\nfour years, but it had to be done so you could at least graduate. Plus, working\npart-time at a book store wasn\u2019t that bad either, you had loads of time to work\non your thesis. </p><p>The worst part of it all wasn\u2019t moving to a\ndorm or finding a part-time job, no. The worst part was distancing yourself\nfrom the people that had been your friends during the past six months. They had\nmade you feel so comfortable with yourself, had made you feel so alive taking\nyou out of your comfort zone, that they had almost felt like family. How\ncouldn\u2019t they be called family when they had made you feel as if you fitted in\nso perfectly? </p><p>Of course you still kept in touch with Evey,\nbut always via text. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t stare at her and lie to her, you\ncouldn\u2019t act as if nothing had happened, and you couldn\u2019t stare at her laughing\nand kissing Taehyung knowing everything he was hiding. Yes, he was hiding\neverything from her to protect her, but still, he was lying to her. </p><p>But you weren\u2019t just distancing yourself from\nthe boys because you had realized it was not your world, that you didn\u2019t \u2013 and\ncouldn\u2019t \u2013 belong to a place like that, follow such a lifestyle. You were\ndistancing yourself because you couldn\u2019t stand de idea of seeing Jungkook after\nthose nine words he said to you. </p><p><i>I wish I could love\nyou, but I can\u2019t.</i></p><p>They bounced inside your mind, echoing and\nleaving you numb and tired. You couldn\u2019t think of anything that weren\u2019t those\nnine words, again and again. Why couldn\u2019t he love you? Was if because of you?\nWas it because of the circumstances? Was it because he just <i>couldn\u2019t love?</i></p><p>Whatever the case it was, he couldn\u2019t love you.</p><p>It was the saddest part of it all, because you\nknew that you would never stop loving him. You sometimes wondered how had you\nbeen able to fall in love with someone like him, so cocky and problematic and\nrude. An asshole from head to toe. A boy who lived for violence and breathed\ndanger. A boy who didn\u2019t give a fuck about anything, not even his life, risking\nit again and again. </p><p>But then, memories of you and him lying on your\nbed at three am assaulted you. They were the most dangerous memories of them\nall. Memories of his skin glowing in the moonlight, memories of his scent and\nhis raspy voice. Memories of his round eyes that held a thousand galaxies when\nthe streetlights reflected on them. Memories of his fingertips against your\nskin as he tickled you. Memories of his laugh and his smile \u2013 the same smile\nthat made him look almost innocent. Memories of your stomach hurting at how hard\nhe made you laugh. Memories of you closing your eyes as he hummed one of his\nfavorite songs while he thought you couldn\u2019t hear him. Memories of the random\nconversations you held in the middle of the night. Memories of feeling free,\nand beautiful and infinite while being with him. Memories of him and his, and\nhim again, and his\u2026 And when it started to feel so overwhelming that you\ncouldn\u2019t breathe, it\u2019s when you were lastly reminded of the love you felt for\nhim. </p><p>With the end of winter season and the blooming\nof flowers, things started to feel\u2026 Alright.</p><p>You still thought about Jungkook, but it didn\u2019t\nhurt anymore, nor did you repeat his words in your mind constantly during the\nday. </p><p>Time passed, in every meaning the of the word\npass.</p><p>Time passed and you started thinking that\nmaybe, one day, you would forget about everything that had happened. That you\nwould forget about him.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cHow long\ntill you graduate?\u201d your tutor nurse said, smiling at you on your way down to\nthe basement of the hospital. </p><p>\u201cA month\nand a half,\u201d you smiled back, a bit shy.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\nYou\u2019re so close!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\nnervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a\nbit, I\u2019m more nervous about the thesis, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\nare you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Once the\ndoors of the elevator opened, you both stepped out of it and started walking\ntowards the changing room. </p><p>\u201cFine, it\u2019s\nalmost finished,\u201d you sighed, relieved. You would have never thought you would\nsay something like that. Your thesis, almost finished\u2026 That sounded like music\nto your ears. \u201cIt only needs a few final touches and\u2026 <i>C\u2019est fini</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ll ace it,\u201d the nurse nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re a great nurse, Y/N, you have future\nin this.\u201d</p><p>You bit\nyour lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\nI don\u2019t want to forget why I studied this in the first place, why I love it so\nmuch.\u201d</p><p>You both\nstopped in front of the door of the students\u2019 changing room.</p><p>\u201cThere will\nbe days when you\u2019ll feel like forgetting all about it, but then, you\u2019ll see\nyour patients smiling at you, trusting you with their lives, and you\u2019ll\nremember it.\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cI remember\nit every day, and that\u2019s what keeps me going,\u201d she said. \u201cWould it not be for\nthat; I\u2019d be owning a flower shop right now. Flowers never make you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\nsounds like a good plan B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d\nshe laughed. She patted your back a few times. \u201cHave a good weekend, see you on\nMonday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too,\nsee you on Monday!\u201d</p><p>With the\nfirst days of May, the slightly warmer weather arrived too.</p><p>It was a\nbit late and you had missed your bus, so, instead of waiting twenty minutes for\nthe next one, you decided to take a walk. The night breeze was calm, and the\nsky was completely clear. Your oversized bomber jacket and your headphones were\neverything you needed.</p><p>Plus, the\ndorms were closer to the hospital than your apartment had been.</p><p>It had\nsaddened you, to say goodbye to your independence, to your small living room,\nand your open kitchen. To your bedroom, and your comfy bed, with its fluffy\nsheets and floral cushions, the lights that seeped through the windows each\nnight and the sunrays every morning. It had saddened you to say goodbye to\neverything that had happened inside that apartment, and all the memories you\nhad made in there. But life had to carry on, and that apartment was now part of\nyour past.</p><p>You hummed\nsoftly along with the music playing through your headphones.</p><p>You didn\u2019t\nwant to think about the past now, you were a new Y/N, a new and better Y/N.</p><p>The music\nblocked you form the outside world as you kept walking through the now familiar\nstreets of your new neighborhood.</p><p> \u201cMhmm\u2026\u201d you hummed.</p><p>Your eyes\ntravelled across the empty streets, only you and the streetlamps in them. As\nyour eyes focused on the shadow that the streetlights casted of your figure,\nyou noticed a second shadow.</p><p>Immediately,\nyou unlocked your phone and turned off the volume. Nothing.</p><p>You looked\nagain at the sidewalk. The shadow was there, just a few meters away from yours.</p><p>Breath\ncatching in your throat, you sped up, your footsteps becoming quicker and\nshorter. Your heart started beating wildly inside your chest and your whole body\nprepared itself to start running.</p><p>Taking off\nyour headphones, you looked backwards. There it, was, the shadow that had been\nfollowing you in the shape of a tall, big man. His dark eyes met yours.</p><p>You gasped\nand immediately started running. </p><p>Running ha\nnever been your strong point, but you weren\u2019t far from your dorm building and\nthe adrenaline pumping through your veins made you run faster and resist more.</p><p>You began\nhearing the heavy footsteps behind you once you turned around the next corner.\nYou could already see your building\u2026</p><p>Trying to\nbe smart, you thought about misleading the man and taking a sharp turn. If you\nran towards your dorm, you would be safe tonight but he would know where you\nlived and he would be waiting for you the next time you walked out of the\nbuilding. </p><p>Without\nthinking twice, you took a turn to your left in the first street you found. It\nwas a bit dark, only a few old streetlamps lighting the place. You kept\nrunning, trying to reach the other side where it would lead to a bigger street.\nBut your luck wasn\u2019t with you that night, and instead of a street you had found\na alleyway. And it didn\u2019t have a way out of it.</p><p>Your body\ncrashed against the fence, heavy breaths leaving your lips in erratic puffs as\nyour knuckles hit the fence with rage. Fuck. </p><p>Pure fear\nsettled in your body as you turned around, finding the man walking towards you\nwith a mischievous smile on his face. He was walking slowly, knowing \u2013 just\nlike you knew \u2013 that you didn\u2019t have a way out of that. </p><p>Your eyes scanned\nthe place, your self-defense classes mode on. You tried to find a place where\nyou could escape the man and run away from that alley. Maybe, if you let him\napproach you some more and then took a sharp turn to your right and ran towards\nthe opening of the alley\u2026</p><p>You stood\nstill, letting the man approach you.</p><p>Just when\nhe walked closer to you, a streetlamp lighted his features. Your breath got\ncaught in your throat as you recognized him. He was Jiwon\u2019s brother.</p><p>He laughed,\nthe sound echoing around the place. He could see the recognition in your eyes,\nhe could smell your fear.</p><p>\u201cNice to\nsee you again, doll,\u201d he said in a low voice that sent shivers running down\nyour spine.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\ncould say the same,\u201d you said in between erratic breaths.</p><p>You had to\nbe strong, or at least, act as if you were.</p><p>\u201cWhy are\nyou so scared?\u201d he purred. \u201cI just wanna talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you\nremember what happened to you the last time you tried talking to me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes\nshone with danger.</p><p>\u201cOf course\nI do\u2026 I think I remember telling you I didn\u2019t like bad girls, huh? They all\nneed to be taught a lesson. Well, I still think the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\nwanna teach me some bad self-defense lesson, save it, I already know everything\nI need.\u201d</p><p>The man\nsmirked, his hand reaching for something in the back pocket of his jeans. When\nit came back, you saw something metallic in his hand. A low click sounded\nbefore a knife appeared. The dim light in the alleyway reflected on its blade.</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah?\nWell, I think your stupid self-defense lessons didn\u2019t teach you anything about\nknives, huh? Do you really know everything you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call\nthe police.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed\nyour phone with more strength in your hands, protecting it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid\nthat, if you do, you won\u2019t be able to tell them anything when they arrive.\u201d</p><p>You gulped.\n</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nsuch a great coward if you need a knife against an unarmed person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call it\nbeing prudent, I won\u2019t take risks tonight,\u201d he said, voice low as he approached\nyou some more.</p><p>That was\nit, it was your last chance of running away.</p><p>Blinking a\nfew times, you didn\u2019t even give him enough time to process what you were about\nto do. You avoided him, taking a turn to your right and running towards the\nentrance of the alleyway. Your footsteps were quick, but your legs weren\u2019t as\nlong as his and soon, you felt a grip on your bomber jacket.</p><p>He pulled\nyou backwards until your back crashed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhere do\nyou think you\u2019re going? We still haven\u2019t talked,\u201d he growled in your ear,\ngrabbing strands of your hair and forcing you towards the end of the alleyway\nonce again.</p><p>You started\nto scream, but his hand clasped itself over your mouth.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he\npurred. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone interrupting us, do we?\u201d</p><p>You opened\nyour mouth, but not to scream. You parted your lips and sunk your teeth on the\npalm of his hand. You bit with strength until you felt the skin tearing\nunderneath your teeth, and the man let out a strangled cry.</p><p>He let go\nof you for some seconds, enough for you to try to escape again, but his other\nhand was still holding your hair and he yanked you backwards.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to a person who\u2019s trying to talk to you\u2026 That\u2019s\nrude.\u201d</p><p>You stood\nstill and felt his knee hitting the bottom of your back. Numb with pain, you\nfell on your knees. Your hands fled back to hold the sore area, and you closed\nyour eyes, fighting to not cry. </p><p>\u201cAre you\ngoing to stay still now?\u201d he growled, crouching on the floor before you. \u201cI\ncould have hit you harder, I could break a couple of vertebras\u2026 Maybe you\nwouldn\u2019t be able to escape then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou want from me?\u201d you said through gritted teeth, head hanging low.</p><p>He grabbed\nyour hair once again and forced you to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the\none doing the questions here, alright?\u201d he spat. You stood quiet; mouth shut.\n\u201cAlright?!\u201d he repeated, yanking your hair upwards.</p><p>\u201cA-alright,\u201d\nyou stuttered.</p><p>\u201cGood\ngirl,\u201d he smiled, and his smile almost made you puke. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure a little\nnurse like you can tell what things I can do to you to make you suffer without\nhaving to kill you, right?\u201d</p><p>Your lower\nlip trembled, but you fought against yourself and your fear to remain\nunbothered.</p><p>\u201cAnswer\nme,\u201d he growled through clenched teeth. \u201cEach time I ask you something I want\nyou to answer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright\nand right are rhetorical questions,\u201d you said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if you know\nwhat a rhetorical question is, but it doesn\u2019t need to be answered.\u201d</p><p>A harsh\nblow was delivered to your cheek, making your neck snap to the side in a harsh\nmovement. You turned your head back to look at him, not wanting to miss any of\nhis movements.</p><p>\u201cYou think\nyou\u2019re brave for answering me like that? You\u2019re more stupid than I thought,\u201d he\nsaid, his smirk reappearing on his lips. \u201cI\u2019d love to have Jeon here so he\ncould see what I\u2019m about to do to you.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes\nwidened as you saw him lean closer to you. You tried to stand up, but he\ngrabbed your hair with strength and kept you pinned to the ground. You closed\nyour eyes, but you could feel his breath against your neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat a\nshame the boss needs you alive\u2026\u201d he sighed and distanced himself from you.</p><p>In a harsh\nmovement, he let go of your hair, your back hitting the ground with a loud\n\u2018humpf\u2019. </p><p>\u201cYou can\nopen your eyes, I\u2019m only going to make you a few questions,\u201d he sighed. \u201cBut of\ncourse, if you don\u2019t behave, you won\u2019t return home untouched.\u201d</p><p>You blinked\nrapidly, blinking away the tears that had begun to pool in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s\nJeon?\u201d he asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d\nyou stuttered, still a bit in shock.</p><p>\u201cYou heard\nme, where\u2019s Jeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow.\u201d</p><p>Jiwon\u2019s\nbrother crouched once again so he was eye-level with you. </p><p>\u201cLying to\nme is not part of behaving like a good girl. C\u2019mon, I will give you a second\nchance. Where\u2019s Jeon Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, I swear.\u201d</p><p>The man\nnarrowed his eyes at you.</p><p>\u201cHow can\nyou not know if you\u2019re his girl?\u201d</p><p>At the\nmention of you as Jungkook\u2019s girl, your heart skipped a beat. How could you be\nso weak for him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\nhis girl, and I\u2019ve never been. I don\u2019t see where he is, nor I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you\nneed a third chance? Alright, where\u2019s Jeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nalready told you! I don\u2019t know! I haven\u2019t seen him in months, I haven\u2019t heard\nfrom him or any of his friends either!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\nabout that friend of yours that\u2019s with Kim?\u201d</p><p>You gritted\nyour teeth at the mention of Evey.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kept\nin contact with her, but we never talk about Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>The man\nstared into your eyes as if searching for something. You held his gaze. You\nwere telling the truth, there was no way you would break the stare contest\nfirst.</p><p>\u201cBut you\nonce were with him, you must know where he goes when he wants to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never\nknew him that well,\u201d you breathed. It hurt, but that wasn\u2019t a lie either. </p><p>He grabbed\nhis knife with more strength for you to see it.</p><p>\u201cYou better\nnot be lying to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\ndon\u2019t know where he is, but if I\u2019m being honest, if I knew, I wouldn\u2019t tell you\neither.\u201d</p><p>The man\narched a brow in understanding. </p><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d he\nmocked you. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with Jeon\u2026 That explains everything. Poor girl,\u201d he\npouted.</p><p>You\nclenched your teeth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nneed to punish you or teach you any lesson, falling in love with Jeon Jungkook\nit\u2019s enough suffering on itself,\u201d he laughed. You closed your eyes, somehow his\nwords hurt more than his blows had. \u201cMy brother told me about it, though. He\nthought you were stupid too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJiwon\nknows you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJiwon was\nthe one who told me where you would be and where I would be able to find you,\u201d\nhe smirked. \u201cAre you na\u00efve enough to think that my brother approached you just\nbecause he found you pretty and funny? Well\u2026 You caught feelings for Jeon, so\nyeah, you\u2019re na\u00efve enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew\nyour brother was using me just to return the favor to Jungkook, I just took\nadvantage of that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you\nwant to know where Jungkook is?\u201d</p><p>The man\nclicked his tongue. \u201cI told you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the one doing the questions\nhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and\nyour brother work for that Mr. Kang man, don\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you wanna find\nJungkook? Because you weren\u2019t able to finish your work with him.\u201d</p><p>Jiwon\u2019s\nbrother narrowed his eyes.</p><p>He grabbed\nyour face with one of his huge hands, forcing you to stare straight at him.</p><p>\u201cListen to\nme, doll,\u201d he spat. \u201cYou\u2019re doing fine by staying out of this, but it\u2019s too\nlate to forget about you. Find Jeon and tell him that he better fight the\nwrestling final in two weeks. If he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll start interrogating people\u2026\nAnd this time, it will be people he loves and not a girl he used to fuck and\nthat now is stupidly in love with him, understood?\u201d</p><p>His words\nfelt like pure ice sinking into the bottom of your heart.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood?\u201d\nhe said, grabbing your jaw.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you\nbreathed.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he\nsaid, letting go of you. Your jaw hurt from his tight grip. \u201cNow carry on with\nyour life and don\u2019t do anything stupid, we\u2019re keeping a close eye on you.\nFinish your thesis, graduate, move from this shitty city and find a boy who\ndeserves you and loves you back.\u201d</p><p>And with\nthat, he turned around and disappeared from the alley, leaving you alone.</p><p>Everything\nyou had been feeling since you found out you were being followed, downed on\nyou. You grabbed your knees and hid your face in between them, letting your\ntears fall freely and the sobs interrupt your breaths. </p><p>His words\nhad hurt more than his blows and threats, and that was what scared you the\nmost.</p></p>",

That&rsquo;s how the\nconversation ended.</p><p>Soon, you were running through the mass of\nbodies, texting Evey and letting her know you hadn&rsquo;t been feeling alright and\nthat you had gone home. </p><p>The uber arrived in fifteen minutes &ndash; the\nlongest fifteen minutes of your life &ndash; and as soon as you climbed on the\nbackseat, you opened the texting app and recited the address Taehyung had sent\nyou.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t far from there, in the outskirts of\nthe city.</p><p>Your mind was racing as your eyes followed the\nstreetlamps that looked like fairy lights from the inside of the car. At some\npoint, you closed your eyes and started taking deep breaths, feeling your heart\nin your throat. </p><p>Jungkook.</p><p>Was he alright? Had something happened to him?</p><p>Your palms were sweating, cold sweat, and they\nwere trembling like crazy, little veins tracing your skin as your knuckles\nturned white from the force with which you were balling your hands into fists.</p><p>A thousand scenarios were running through your\nhead, each one worse than the others.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss,&rdquo; the uber driver told you once the car\nhad come to a stop.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t even realized you had reached your\ndestination, too busy closing your eyes and trying to stop your heart from\nfalling from your mouth. </p><p>You paid him, not even waiting to pick the\nchange and ran out of the car. Following Maps in your phone, you ran through\nthe deserted streets. </p><p>You found Taehyung in the entrance of a dark\nalley, looking desperate and wild.</p><p>&ldquo;Tae!&rdquo; you shouted as soon as you saw him.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; he shouted back.</p><p>You threw yourself at him &ndash; if you hadn&rsquo;t done\nthat, you would have probably fallen face-first onto the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jungkook? Is he okay? What happened? I\n&ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, calm down,&rdquo; Taehyung said, grabbing you\nfrom your shoulders as you tried to look behind him. &ldquo;We need you with a cold\nmind, please relax.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can you ask me to relax when you told me\nJungkook needs me?&rdquo; you said, bewildered. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s him?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung&rsquo;s sighed and let go of you. </p><p>You followed him through the alley until you\nreached the spot in between some trash cans and a fence. </p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook!&rdquo; you couldn&rsquo;t help but scream as\nsoon as you saw his body limp, half of it fallen onto the ground, half resting\non the brick wall behind him.</p><p>You kneeled beside him, instantly reaching out\nto touch him. </p><p>All plans and stupidity being left aside, you\nstarted mumbling his name.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook, hey, Jungkook, can you hear me?\nJungkook.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s unconscious,&rdquo; Taehyung said from behind\nyou. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried waking him up, but I think he hit his head pretty hard against\nthe ground.&rdquo;</p><p>You then repaired in Jungkook&rsquo;s appearance, for\nreal. He had blood dripping down his nose, and a dark bruise was forming in one\nof his cheeks. He had a small cut on his lower lip, and his grey hoodie was\ndirty. They were bruises, but bruises that weren&rsquo;t unusual for him. </p><p>It was the blood stain that was growing on one\nside of his hoodie that caught your attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; you gasped, clasping one hand over\nyour mouth. &ldquo;But&hellip; Oh my god. He has been shot!&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at Taehyung, who was looking\nincredibly guilty. He also had bruises all over his face, and he didn&rsquo;t look\nany better than Jungkook did, except for the fact that he had no gunshot hole\nin his jumper, nor did he had stains of blood. </p><p>&ldquo;W&hellip; What the fuck happened?!&rdquo; you asked, your\npointer and middle finger pressing over Jungkook&rsquo;s carotid artery to find his\npulse. &ldquo;He has been shot, oh my god&hellip;&rdquo; you kept mumbling.</p><p>When you felt a soft thump beneath your\nfingertips you relaxed a bit.</p><p>Taehyung wasn&rsquo;t answering, he just couldn&rsquo;t\nanswer to that question in that moment, and your mind was working so fast that\nyou didn&rsquo;t even care.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip; Doesn&rsquo;t matter right now,&rdquo; you said,\ntrying to calm yourself. &ldquo;We need to take him to the hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?! No, he can&rsquo;t go to the hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He has been shot, Taehyung! We need to see if\nthe bullet has reached any vital organs or if there is an internal bleeding!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we carry him to the hospital with a bullet\nwound, police will appear, and Jungkook can&rsquo;t afford that right now,&rdquo; Taehyung\nsaid in a calmer tone. You didn&rsquo;t know if he was trying to calm you or if he\nwas trying to calm himself. &ldquo;They would start asking questions and&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t take him to the hospital <i>right now</i>, he&rsquo;ll keep losing blood and\nhe will die!&rdquo; you said, teeth clenched as you couldn&rsquo;t understand why Taehyung\nrefused to bring his friend to the hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I called you, you&rsquo;re a nurse, you\nshould know how to take care of him.&rdquo;</p><p>You stood up, taking some steps closer towards\nTaehyung.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a nurse, not a fucking surgeon!&rdquo; you said,\npausing briefly before continuing. &ldquo;Wait, no, I&rsquo;m not even a nurse yet! I&rsquo;m a\nstudent!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but you work as a nurse at the fights.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! But sewing up small cuts and bruises,\nnot healing bullet wounds! I haven&rsquo;t seen a bullet wound in my life, only studied\nwhat to do with it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You already know more than I do, then,&rdquo;\nTaehyung tried reasoning with you. &ldquo;Listen, Y/N, we have no time to waste.\nJungkook&rsquo;s not going to the hospital, he&rsquo;d rather die than answer the questions\nof all those fucking cops. If they catch him and get him into jail, it&rsquo;ll be\nthe end of him, you already know that, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>You took some steps back from Taehyung and\nJungkook, threading your fingers in your hair and pulling from the roots in a\ndesperate act. It all felt like a nightmare, a really fucking bad nightmare.</p><p>Lifting your eyes just a tiny bit to stare at\nJungkook&rsquo;s unmoving body made you sick. </p><p>&ldquo;Argh&hellip;&rdquo; you growled, drawing your hands down\nyour face and closing your eyes as you did so.</p><p>You had studied a lot of things but putting them\ninto practice was a completely different thing. And, being a bit egoistic, you\nwouldn&rsquo;t be able to live with the idea that you had killed Jungkook. On the\nother hand, you knew what Taehyung was saying was true. Jungkook already had\nsome issues with the law, he had escaped from the hospital when he had that\nmotorbike accident and you guess he had way more issues than that, let alone\nwhatever shit was he into at the moment. If you took him to the hospital and\nthey saw his bullet wound, they would immediately call the police and they\nwould start making too many questions&hellip; </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, alright&hellip;&rdquo; you mumbled. </p><p>You patted your cheeks a couple of times before\nopening your eyes and staring at Taehyung. You were only a few months away from\ngraduating, you were practically a nurse. You could do that.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; you nodded, looking at Taehyung.\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take him to my apartment, I have some medical supplies in there&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You started counting internally all the\nsupplies you had at home. Some steri-strips, needles, disinfectant, sterile\ngloves&hellip; Even some intravenous saline.</p><p>&ldquo;Great, great,&rdquo; Taehyung nodded. &ldquo;My car is\njust parked a few streets away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go grab it, I&rsquo;ll be here with Jungkook waiting\nfor you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded again, but he stayed there watching\nyou. You could see it in his face, he was just as affected as you were.</p><p>&ldquo;Go, don&rsquo;t worry, everything will be fine.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Or so you hoped.</i></p><p>Taehyung nodded a third time before turning\naround and running towards his car.</p><p>You were still pressing your scarf over\nJungkook&rsquo;s bullet wound when Taehyung walked inside your apartment carrying him\nin his arms.</p><p>He was still unconscious, but his breathing was\nsteady and his heartbeat strong.</p><p>&ldquo;Put him on my bed, last door at the end of the\ncorridor,&rdquo; you said as soon as you stepped a foot inside your apartment,\nrushing to close the door behind you and take your coat off, leaving it on the\nfloor.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep pressing on his wound with my scarf!&rdquo; you\nordered Taehyung as you grabbed your supplies from the cupboard under the TV\nand the bathroom.</p><p>It was a shocking sight, to see Jungkook in\nyour bed again, that time for way more different reasons. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; you said to yourself, trying to\norder the thoughts that were running through your mind. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung stood still, staring at you with uncertain\neyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; he asked in a soft voice.</p><p>It took you some more seconds to go back to\nreality and answer him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; you finally said. &ldquo;Take his hoodie\nand the rest of his clothes off, leaving him only in his boxers. I&rsquo;ll start\npreparing everything.&rdquo;</p><p>As Taehyung undressed Jungkook, you rushed to\nwash your hands in the bathroom, put some gloves on and start setting your\nsterile field. </p><p>&ldquo;Gauzes, disinfectant&hellip; Scalpel&hellip;&rdquo; you counted.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do I leave his clothes?&rdquo; Taehyung asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave them inside the shower, I&rsquo;ll take care\nof them later.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded and disappeared from you room. You\ntook that as a chance to look back at Jungkook. He was paler and paler by each\npassing second. </p><p>&ldquo;Hold on, please, hold on,&rdquo; you desperately\npleaded, passing your hand over his forehead. At least he didn&rsquo;t have a fever,\nso the wound or the organs affected by it weren&rsquo;t infected yet.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back, I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo; Taehyung said, kneeling\nat the other side of the bed.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t know why you both repeated each\nthing two times each time one of you spoke. It was as if you were reassuring\nyourselves.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I help you with anything?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you nodded. &ldquo;Grab my nightstand lamp\nand give me some light please.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung did as you said while you climbed on\ntop of your bed, careful not to touch anything from your sterile field.</p><p>Your hands were trembling as you touched the\narea around the bullet wound, pressing and pinching, trying to find any signs\nof any organ being affected or bleeding.</p><p>&ldquo;It looks like it hasn&rsquo;t reached any abdominal\norgan,&rdquo; you said, your hands still feeling around Jungkook&rsquo;s taut stomach.\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good sign, a very good one.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung simply nodded, watching you work with\ncareful eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll se if I can get the bullet out.&rdquo;</p><p>You cleaned the wound and the area around with\nsome gauzes and water with soap.</p><p>Your hands trembled even more as you took off\nyour normal gloves and put some sterile ones on. Once you were fully sterile,\nyou grabbed the surgical tweezers and opened the wound. It was as if a heavy weight\nhad been lifted off from your shoulders as soon as you saw the metallic shine\nof the bullet. </p><p>Luckily, the shoot hadn&rsquo;t been to up-close and\nthe bullet hadn&rsquo;t gone too far into Jungkook&rsquo;s abdomen, barely reaching the\nmuscle tissue.</p><p>Grabbing another pair of tweezers, you\ncarefully got the bullet out of Jungkook&rsquo;s abdomen. </p><p>Without giving yourself time to think about\nwhat you had just done, you started sewing up the wound, careful to leave both\nends next to each other so they could scar quickly. Then, you applied some\nantiseptic and steri-strip in some of the places of the wound that looked more\nfragile to you.</p><p>Covering the wound with a fresh dressing, you\npatted the area, making sure the hemorrhage had stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it done?&rdquo; Taehyung asked when he saw you\nstaying still.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; you nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;And now what?&rdquo; </p><p>You stared at Jungkook&rsquo;s face. He had started\nsweating, probably from the pain he had been feeling despite being unconscious.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you believe in God, Taehyung?&rdquo; you asked\nout of the blue. Before he could answer, you did. &ldquo;Because all we can do now is\npray.&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>After taking care of the rest of Jungkook&rsquo;s\nwounds, you cleaned everything and threw it in the bin. </p><p>You cleaned the medical supplies from\nJungkook&rsquo;s blood in the sink of your bathroom, the marble material turning a\nreddish color as you asked yourself how many more times you were going to clean\nJungkook&rsquo;s blood.</p><p>Closing the tap, you looked upwards and stared\nat your reflection in the mirror. Hair greasy and disheveled, mascara ruined,\ndark circles under your eyes and pale skin, eyes red and puffy from crying and\nbeing tired. You looked great.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s him?&rdquo; you asked, entering your room were\nJungkook was still fighting, lying underneath your blankets.</p><p>You had switched on the heating so he wouldn&rsquo;t\nturn cold.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Taehyung sighed, letting his\nhead fall onto his hands.</p><p>You walked towards him and placed your hand\nover his shoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, I have to take care of that cut above\nyour nose.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung sat at the feet of your bed as you\ncleaned his wounds and applied some disinfectant and antibacterial cream. </p><p>&ldquo;Can you explain me now what happened?&rdquo; you\nsighed. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t just tell me that you got shot, tell me the reason why.&rdquo;</p><p>You could feel Taehyung sighing, his shoulders\nslumping.</p><p>You dabbed delicately the cut above his nose\nwith a cotton pad soaked in disinfectant.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine&hellip; But please, don&rsquo;t tell Evey. Nor about\nthis, not about what I&rsquo;m going to tell you. Please.&rdquo;</p><p>You stared into his eyes, a delicate frown\ndrawing itself over your forehead. You stopped your movements with the cotton\npad and leant back a few centimeters.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it, Taehyung?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, promise me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so wrong about it that Evey can&rsquo;t know\nanything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, promise me you won&rsquo;t tell her.&rdquo;</p><p>You opened and closed your mouth like a fish\nout of water.</p><p>&ldquo;Tae, she&rsquo;s my best friend, you can&rsquo;t ask\nsomething like that from me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, if you don&rsquo;t do it for me, do it for\nher,&rdquo; Taehyung desperately pleaded. &ldquo;The less she knows, the better. She&rsquo;ll be\nsafer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re scaring me, Tae,&rdquo; you said, voice\nmerely a whisper as you sat on the balls of your feet, staring with wide eyes\nat the man sitting at the feet of your bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Promise me, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I promise you,&rdquo; you stuttered. &ldquo;Tell me\nalready, what have you and Jungkook gotten yourselves into?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung took a deep breath and leant forward,\nhis elbows resting on his thighs as his head hang low.</p><p>&ldquo;We stopped when we met Sungho,&rdquo; he started.\n&ldquo;He told us about the fights and said we could make a lot of money, that we\nwouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about paying the rent or making ends meet&hellip; Never again.\nHe introduced us to the boys and created a small family. Each one of us found\nin the other boys the father, mother, brother, sister, they had never had.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung took a brief pause, a long sigh\nescaping his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Sungho saw potential in Jungkook, and started\nfocusing on him, training him, bringing him to the underground fights,\nintroducing him to his contacts&hellip; And once he started fighting, Jungkook became\nSungho&rsquo;s own little goose that laid the golden eggs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was half a year ago,&rdquo; you nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, almost two years ago. Jungkook became\nobsessed with fighting and wining and training and being the best. If he lost a\nfight, he would stay the whole night in the gym, training until he couldn&rsquo;t\neven lift his arms. He didn&rsquo;t stop until he won Bobby, and that&rsquo;s exactly what\nSungho wanted&hellip; But now he wants more, and Jungkook being a champion is not\nenough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In what sense?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung lifted his eyes so he was staring at\nyou.</p><p>&ldquo;He wants more money, more power, more and\nmore. I guess he has dragged us with him&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You frowned. &ldquo;What are you talking about,\nTaehyung?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung gulped.</p><p>&ldquo;Sungho heard about what Jungkook and I did\nbefore he met us, and he took interest in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Took interest in what?&rdquo; you pushed him. &ldquo;What\ndid you and Jungkook do?&rdquo;</p><p>The silence that followed your question was\nsending chills down your spine. </p><p>&ldquo;Tae&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We dealt, Y/N. We were dealers.&rdquo;</p><p>You blinked rapidly as the words sank in. They.\nWere. Dealers.</p><p>&ldquo;As in&hellip;&rdquo; gulp. &ldquo;Deal&hellip; With&hellip; With drugs?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Taehyung breathed. &ldquo;We worked for an\nimportant drug lord who owns the business in this city. He has people\neverywhere, he controls everywhere and he basically is everywhere. We were\nnothing but two young dealers who dealt at university parties and clubs at the\noutskirts of the city, but we were <i>his </i>drug\ndealers. I don&rsquo;t know if you know this&hellip; But once you work as a dealer for a\ndrug lord, there is no going back, you can&rsquo;t just decide that you want a normal\njob one day and disappear, no. It&rsquo;s forever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, how did the two of you get out of that?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung shrugged his shoulders, averting his\neyes from yours once again. He started at his still unconscious friend lying on\nyour bed, naked torso heaving slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;We spoke to him, payed our debt and swore we\nwould never talk. He had the names of our families, the directions of our\nhomes&hellip; We had too much to lose if we talked, so we never did. He kept an eye on\nus in case we betrayed him, and we never did&hellip; Until a few months ago. Sungho heard\nthat we were dealers and started asking questions about it. Jungkook and I\nthought it was normal, since he was our new boss. But then, he started asking\nabout money, and how the business worked. He told us he had a contact in the\nnorth of the country that could give him good quality material for us to say.\nWe told him that it would be impossible, that Mr. Kang, our previous boss,\nowned the entirety of the city and that he didn&rsquo;t like rivalry. He wouldn&rsquo;t\nallow any other drug lord in his city.&rdquo;</p><p>Another pause, Taehyung shook his head,\nmemories assaulting his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;But Sungho didn&rsquo;t listen to us, he just saw\nthe money and the power it would bring him. He said he had contacts and that\nMr. Kang wouldn&rsquo;t be able to touch us. He&hellip; He put it so great that we only saw\nthe extra money we would earn, and we agreed. We became his dealers &ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; you interrupted him, asking him to stop\nwith a raised hand. &ldquo;Are you telling me&hellip; Are you telling me that you and\nJungkook have been dealing drugs this whole time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>A image came to your head&hellip; How could have you\nbeen so na&iuml;ve? That night, at the party before the Christmas holidays you had\nseen it all. Sungho had been searching around for Jungkook, and Jungkook had\nbeen missing. You remembered seeing him in that dark alley, those girls\nlaughing as they walked away from him. You remembered how he stayed behind,\nkeeping something in the pockets of his jeans&hellip; Fuck.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, Tae,&rdquo; you gasped, covering your\nmouth with the palm of your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Kang heard about us, discovered Sungho&rsquo;s\nbusiness and he put a price to our heads. We&rsquo;ve hidden from them thanks to\nSungho&rsquo;s contacts, but his contacts aren&rsquo;t everywhere, and tonight, they found\nus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, oh my god,&rdquo; you mumbled, hiding\nyour face behind your hands, threading your hands through your hair. &ldquo;Oh my\nfucking god.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were lucky that a police car passed by and\nthey ran away, but I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll be so lucky next time,&rdquo; Taehyung\ncarried on. &ldquo;They will eventually find us, and when they do&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; you repeated, lifting your head up\nand staring at him. </p><p>&ldquo;This is why you can&rsquo;t tell Evey,&rdquo; he said,\nshaking his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t risk putting her in more danger than she already is.\nThey&rsquo;ll go after our loved ones, it&rsquo;s best if we kept them away from all this.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded on autopilot, your mind still\nprocessing that a huge drug lord wanted Jungkook and Taehyung dead, and\nprobably, Evey and the rest of your friends too.</p><p>&ldquo;This is too much, too dangerous. You know what\nthose guys are like, Taehyung? They have all the money in the world, people\nmove because of money, people would do anything for them and a couple of\nbucks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know, I worked for him, remember?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you reach out to me, then? This is too\nmuch for me, I don&rsquo;t belong here, this is not my world. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell any\nof the other boys? They would know how to help you better than I can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know about this, any of this,&rdquo;\nTaehyung said, shaking his head. &ldquo;And they can&rsquo;t know, for the same reason as\nEvey can&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>You scoffed. &ldquo;But I can? Am I not in danger or\nwhat?&rdquo; </p><p>Taehyung pursed his lips. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry I have involved you in this,\nI&rsquo;m sure Jungkook will never forgive me for this&hellip;&rdquo; Taehyung said, eyes glossy\nas he searched for your eyes in the dim light of your room. &ldquo;But I was\ndesperate and Jungkook had been shot&hellip; You were my only option.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded your head slowly, sinking everything\nin.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s not fair, I&rsquo;m so sorry, I&rsquo;m so, so\nsorry. Jungkook is like a brother to me, I love him so much, I couldn&rsquo;t bother\nthe idea of losing him and I had to set my priorities.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I wasn&rsquo;t one of them,&rdquo; you said, nodding\nslowly.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, it isn&rsquo;t like &ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; you interrupted him. &ldquo;I get it Tae, I do.\nI just wish I was someone&rsquo;s priority for once.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You already are&hellip; You&hellip;&rdquo; Taehyung stuttered,\nstopping himself. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; you shrugged,\ngrabbing the things you had used to heal Taehyung&rsquo;s wounds and putting them\ninside a plastic bag.</p><p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t. I also called you because I knew\nas soon as you knew it was about Jungkook, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to refuse. I\nknew you wouldn&rsquo;t say no.&rdquo;</p><p>Your head snapped up to his just when you were\nabout to stand up from the floor. </p><p>&ldquo;Why? Why did you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung scoffed softly.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, Y/N, everyone can see you&rsquo;re crazy\nabout Jungkook,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You could bite water if it was for him. You&rsquo;re in\nlove with him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not &ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to deny it,&rdquo; Taehyung was the one\nwho interrupted you then. &ldquo;I can see how you look at him and how you act all\ntough and indifferent around him, but each time he&rsquo;s hurt you hurt for him,\neach time he&rsquo;s happy you smile and each time he stares at you, you blush.\nYou&rsquo;re so in love it hurts to see from afar.&rdquo;</p><p>Your nostrils flared.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitive, I&rsquo;m gonna kill Evey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Evey? Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? She didn&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She already knew you were in love with\nJungkook?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shh!&rdquo; you shushed him loudly. &ldquo;He could hear\nus!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, he&rsquo;s unconscious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, they say that the hearing is the last\nsense a person loses when they&rsquo;re unconscious.&rdquo;</p><p>Although, you didn&rsquo;t know why you were worrying\nso much about Jungkook hearing Taehyung&rsquo;s words when he already knew you loved\nhim. </p><p>&ldquo;This is so fucked up,&rdquo; you said, turning\nserious once again. You rubbed your temples with both hands, a headache\nstarting to grow.</p><p>&ldquo;It is, and I&rsquo;m so sorry for getting you in the\nmiddle of all this but&hellip; Jungkook needed you.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded, finally standing up from the floor\nand grabbing the plastic bag in which all your used medical supplies had been\nkept.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; you sighed. &ldquo;I would probably do\nit all over again even after knowing that some bad ass drug lord and half of\nthe population of this city is after you.&rdquo;</p><p>You heard Taehyung sigh and mumble something\nunder his breath, but you didn&rsquo;t give it a second thought. </p><p>After all that had happened, and all the new\ninformation you had gotten, you were drained from all energy and you needed to\nrest.</p><p>&ldquo;You can stay here tonight, or well, for as\nlong as you want,&rdquo; you told Taehyung. &ldquo;You can sleep on the couch tonight, I&rsquo;ll\nsleep in my armchair and look after Jungkook.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired, you should sleep on the couch\ninstead. I&rsquo;ll look after &ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been punched on the face and my nose\nhasn&rsquo;t been nearly broken, <i>you </i>should\nsleep on the couch. And you should text Evey and tell her your right or\nsomething before she shows up in here panicking. Tell her you&rsquo;ll be busy this\nweekend and that you won&rsquo;t be able to see her.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung helped you preparing the couch after\nsending Evey a text. You ate some leftovers you had in your fridge while you both\nchattered about anything and everything at the same time. After a warm red tea,\nyou took a very much needed hot shower, cleaned your face and got rid of all\nthe ruined mascara, blow-dried your hair and put on your comfiest pyijama.</p><p>With a blanket and your mobile charger in mind,\nyou entered your room.</p><p>Jungkook was lying on the same position you had\nfirst left him. The moonlight seeped in your room at that hour of the night,\njust like any other night, and just like many nights before, its milky light poured\nover Jungkook&rsquo;s skin. It looked as if he was made of marble, so perfect and\ndefined. But, as your eyes traveled down his naked torso, you found the\nbandages covering his abdomen and flinched.</p><p>Cautiously, you took a seat next to him on the\nbed, cleaning the sweat from his forehead and making sure he didn&rsquo;t have a\nfever. Passing a cloth soaked in cool water all over his face, you observed\nevery feature of his. From the little mole under his lower lip, to his big\nnose, to his round eyes. </p><p>You were just torturing yourself, so you shook\nyour head and sat on the armchair that decorated one of the corners of your\nroom. With your blanket on and your mobile charging by your side, your eyes on\nJungkook, you started drifting off to sleep.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>The weekend passed by in slow motion.</p><p>You barely went out of your room, unless you\nhad to go to the bathroom or you felt hungry. You were afraid Jungkook&rsquo;s state\nwould worsen when you weren&rsquo;t in the room with him, so you just stayed there,\nass glued to your armchair as your eyes never left his unmoving form.</p><p>Three times a day, you cleaned him with warm\nwater, to wash away all the sweat from his body. You also changed the bandage\nthat covered his wound, observing that it wasn&rsquo;t getting infected or that the\nstitches didn&rsquo;t separate form each other so the wound could open. </p><p>It was pure torture to you, both physically and\nmentally, the thought of Jungkook dying in your bed haunting you every night. </p><p>If you had taken him to the hospital, they\nwould have extracted the bullet in an operating room, everything sterile. They\nwould have transfused him some blood too, making up for all he lost. But you\nhad no operating room, nor blood you could transfuse him, you just had your\ngauzes, your bottle of antiseptic and the hope that it would all be enough.</p><p>Jungkook was strong, but you didn&rsquo;t know how\nfar that strength could go.</p><p>Taehyung had gone home on Sunday morning,\ntelling Evey that he would be out of town so she didn&rsquo;t go to his apartment and\nsee his wounded face. You had been avoiding Evey &ndash; again &ndash; as Taehyung had told\nyou to, not wanting her to know about any of that. You had also called to the\nhospital, telling them you were sick and that you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to go that\nweek. </p><p>The only thing you could do now was wait.</p><p>Should you call his mother? No, you didn&rsquo;t even\nhave her number and he would kill you if you told your mother about all that.\nIf he didn&rsquo;t want her to know that he fought, imagine telling her that he dealt\nwith drugs. No. You couldn&rsquo;t do that to him.</p><p>Inside, you were feeling a mixture of things.\nFrom anger to fear. From resentment to confusion. He had rejected you in the\nworst possible way he could have rejected you, and yet, there you were, taking\ncare of him. Your relationship with Jungkook &ndash; if it could be called that &ndash; was\na spiral of things, and you had grown tired of it. You had never been in love\nbefore, but you were sure love wasn&rsquo;t supposed to hurt like that.</p><p>After thinking and thinking, you had finally\ndrifted off to sleep once more, mind blank as you let your body rest for once.</p><p>It was the noise of grunts and movement that\nsnapped you awake.</p><p>Confusedly, you blinked a few times, trying to\nadjust your eyes to the darkness in the room. Your neck ached from sleeping\nthree nights in a row in an armchair, and your whole body felt weak, you\nweren&rsquo;t ready to fight some stranger breaking into your house.</p><p>Your eyes landed on the body on your bed,\nusually still but now moving.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook?&rdquo; you asked, eyes widening.</p><p>Jungkook was tossing and turning, growling\nthings under his breath. </p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook,&rdquo; you called him once more, walking\ntowards him and kneeling besides him.</p><p>Your hands instantly touched his forehead. It\nwas burning.</p><p>No&hellip; He couldn&rsquo;t have a fever, please, that wasn&rsquo;t\na good sign.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook, hey,&rdquo; you whispered.</p><p>He had a frown drawn over his forehead, eyes\nclosed and lips turned upside-down.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;re not alone,&rdquo; you\nsoftly whispered, leaning closer to him as your hands pushed his bangs away from\nhis sweaty forehead. &ldquo;What hurts, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;T&hellip; Taehyung?&rdquo; he mumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung&rsquo;s not here, he&rsquo;s &ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung?! Taehyung?!&rdquo; Jungkook said, starting\nto raise his voice as his movements became brusquer.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook, he&rsquo;s not here, he&rsquo;s at home, he&rsquo;s\nsafe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung!&rdquo;</p><p>He finally opened his eyes and sat himself on\nthe bed, pulling away your hands from him. As soon as he sat, he let out a howl\nof pain, his hands flying to the bandage on his abdomen.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; you mumbled, pushing his shoulders\nand pushing him down on the bed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sit.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook then focused his eyes on you, widening\nthem at recognizing your face.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you nodded, trying to calm him. &ldquo;Yeah,\nI&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where am I? Why are you here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re at my apartment, Taehyung is safe at\nhis, resting and recovering.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is he hurt?!&rdquo; Jungkook said, alarmed.</p><p>&ldquo;Just a small cut on his nose, he didn&rsquo;t even\nneed stitches. I cleaned his wounds and sent him home.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook sighed in what felt like relief, his\neyes travelling towards the ceiling of your room, a ceiling he knew better than\nthe palm of his hand. He could remember all the countless sleepless nights in\nyour bed staring at the ceiling and mind reeling as you slept peacefully by his\nside. </p><p>You watched as he closed his eyes. You could\nalmost hear the mechanism of his brain working. </p><p>&ldquo;How did I get here?&rdquo; he asked after a few\nseconds.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung called me on Friday night&hellip;&rdquo; you\ncautiously said, not knowing if he would get angry or not. Maybe he didn&rsquo;t want\nto be there, with you&hellip; &ldquo;He told me you needed my help and I went searching for\nyou&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook opened his eyes and stared at you,\nface blank and impassible.</p><p>&ldquo;And you helped me? After all that has\nhappened?&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed, looking down. &ldquo;I had no other\noption. It was either that or letting you die in that alley. I wanted to take\nyou to the hospital, but Tae refused.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After all I&rsquo;ve done to you, you could have\njust gone home and let me die in there,&rdquo; he lifted his arm cautiously to gently\nbrush away the hair from his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, maybe that&rsquo;s what you deserved,&rdquo; you\nsaid, a roll of eyes to indicate him that it was far from what you thought. No\none deserved to die for feeling like he did&hellip; Maybe for how he had treated you,\nbut nah, it was not a good enough reason to die. &ldquo;But I have something called\nconscience and it would have never let me live with it if I had just left you\nthere to die. Any other decent person would have done the same.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook sighed and the sound of air escaping\nsoftly through his lips was the only noise that was heard in the room for a\ncouple of minutes.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have questions? You always have\nthousands,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>You averted your eyes from the covers of your\nbed, eyes finding his in the darkness of the room. The sky was cloudy and no\nmoonlight seeped into your room. You could see the pained expression on\nJungkook&rsquo;s face, though. It was almost agonic.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; you shrugged, reaching towards your\nbedside table were you kept the painkillers and a glass of water. &ldquo;Tae already\ntold me everything. Here,&rdquo; you said, handing him a pill and the glass of water.\n&ldquo;Drink it, it&rsquo;ll help you with the pain and the fever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What does &lsquo;Tae told me everything&rsquo; mean?&rdquo;\nJungkook said, eyes suddenly wide as he ignored the pill and the glass of water\nyou were offering him. </p><p>&ldquo;What it means, there&rsquo;s no other meaning behind\nit. I know what happened and why,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>Jungkook stared at you for a few more seconds\nand then, he let out a frustrated noise.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; you could hear him say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna\nfucking kill Taehyung. Does Evey know about this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He begged me not to tell her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That bast &ndash;&ldquo; he grunted, stopping himself. &ldquo;He\ncan keep his girl away from all this shit, but instead he has to involve min &ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>He took a deep breath to stop himself once\nagain from finishing that sentence, eyes staring into you. Had he been about to\nsay &lsquo;mine&rsquo;? You shook your head at the thought.</p><p>&ldquo;He had no other option, Jungkook, he was\ndesperate to save you. You didn&rsquo;t look good, you were dying.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook closed his eyes and lifted his other\narm to pinch the bridge of his nose, forgetting about the wound situated in the\nleft side of his abdomen. A roaring pain ran through his body, and he let out a\nhowl of pain as he brought both of his hands towards the wound.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; you urged him, kneeling on the bed besides\nhim. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch it, and don&rsquo;t move, the stitches are still a bit fresh and if\nyou apply force towards that spot they&rsquo;ll break.&rdquo;</p><p>You grabbed his hands, pushing them away from\nhis wound and resting on his sides. You lit the lamp on your bedside table and\nstarted opening your first-aid kit.</p><p>&ldquo;I cleaned it this morning, but I&rsquo;ll clean it\nagain in case some stitches broke.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook nodded and let you take the bandage\noff.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you know about&hellip;&rdquo; he began to say.</p><p>&ldquo;I know about the drugs, the gang, the money,\nSungho, a certain Mr. Kang,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Jungkook growled just as you finished\nyour sentence and finished taking the bandage off. You didn&rsquo;t know if the curse\nwas directed at one or another.</p><p>&ldquo;He also told me about what&rsquo;s going on and the\ndanger you&rsquo;re in,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let it affect me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook laughed humorlessly. &ldquo;You know nothing\nabout all that shit, Y/N, you can&rsquo;t just let it not affect you. It doesn&rsquo;t\ndepend on you anymore,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you come to the alley to get me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was there anyone else watching us?&rdquo;</p><p>You shrugged. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, wasn&rsquo;t exactly\nlooking around searching for someone spying on us when you were lying on the\nground and bleeding yourself to death.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is so fucked up, if Kang knows about you\nor any of the other people around us&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have nothing to do with your world or what\nyou do, Jungkook, he won&rsquo;t come after me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He would go after anyone if that means he\nhurts Taehyung or me.&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed, throwing the dirty gauzes in a\nplastic bag.</p><p>&ldquo;Does that mean that it would hurt you if that\nKang did anything to me?&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook pursed his lips, knowing he was\nplaying near dangerous territory. He opted for staying quiet.</p><p>You stared at him, waiting for an answer.</p><p>Shaking your head, you continued cleaning the\nwound.</p><p>&ldquo;It looks good, don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s not infected\nand the stitches are doing good, you will be able to go home tomorrow and, in\nten days ask someone to take the stitches out &ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course it would hurt me,&rdquo; he interrupted\nyou.</p><p>You acted as if you hadn&rsquo;t heard him,\ncontinuing with the bandage and covering the wound.</p><p>&ldquo;It would kill me if anything happened to you\nbecause of me,&rdquo; he continued, almost as if he was desperate to say those words.\n&ldquo;I care about you.&rdquo;</p><p>Your heart jumped inside your chest, but you\ndidn&rsquo;t let yourself waver.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you sure do,&rdquo; you scoffed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve shown\nme how much you care about me again and again since we met.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you? You&rsquo;ve shown me in the best of ways\ntoo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The fact that you&rsquo;re telling me that after all\nthe shit I&rsquo;ve gone through because of you, it&rsquo;s almost insulting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? It&rsquo;s insulting? And what is it to see\nyou with Jiwon everywhere I go? Playing the lovely dovey couple?&rdquo;</p><p>You narrowed your eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go through that\npath, you know it&rsquo;s unfair of you throw that in my face when you&rsquo;ve been\nhooking up with random girls in front of my fucking nose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not unfair when I&rsquo;ve asked you repeatedly\nnot to hang out with him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have never asked anything! The only thing\nyou do is demand! Do this, don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; you snapped, tired of his bullshit.\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nothing to you and you&rsquo;re nothing to me, so you have no right over what I\ncan, or cannot do!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, yeah? Am I nothing to you?&rdquo; he answered,\nvenom laced with his voice. You knew in that exact same moment what he was\nabout to say. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like it if you&rsquo;ve gone <i>through all this shit </i>for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you Jungkook, fuck you,&rdquo; you spat,\nstanding up from your bed and grabbing the plastic bag with the used supplies. </p><p>You stormed out of your room, finding solace in\nyour equally as dark living room. Throwing away the plastic bag, you drank a\nglass of water and rested your elbows on the cold surface of the kitchen\ncounter, hiding your face in your hands. Why was it all like a cycle? Again and\nagain, you always went back to the start. It was destroying you, and you\nweren&rsquo;t helping. Getting involved with Jiwon had been childish and stupid of\nyou and getting into that world in the first place had been even more stupid.</p><p>You almost flinched when you felt the warmth of\na body behind you, chest pressing against your back.</p><p>Jungkook hesitantly raised his hands and placed\nthem on your arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me,&rdquo; you mumbled, flinching away\nfrom his touch.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t back away, only leaning closer to\nyou.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get you,&rdquo; he whispered, and you were about\nto scoff when he spoke again. &ldquo;All I do is hurt you, and all you do is come\nback to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It might be because I&rsquo;m stupid&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve this, Y/N, I don&rsquo;t deserve\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, you don&rsquo;t, but here you are and\nhere I am. In love with a person whom I wonder if someday will <i>see </i>me.&rdquo;</p><p>You hear Jungkook take a deep breath and you\npush him away as you turn around to face him. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act as if you didn&rsquo;t already know, you\nknew it even before I almost told you,&rdquo; you scoffed. &ldquo;Taehyung also told me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes travelling down to the floor is\nthe only answer you needed.</p><p>&ldquo;When did you realize it?&rdquo; you asked, crossing\nyour arms over your chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Was it when we fucked at your apartment before\nChristmas Holidays, or was it when I was always there for you when you needed\nme like a lost puppy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When we fucked at my apartment,&rdquo; he sincerely\nadmitted.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; you nodded. &ldquo;It was then&hellip; I should have\nknown,&rdquo; you nodded with your head. &ldquo;Did you care about my feelings when you\nwere making out with all those girls in front of me? Or, well, did you ever\ncare at all?&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook shook his head. &ldquo;Were you with Jiwon\njust to throw it back at me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is Jiwon all you care about?&rdquo; you scoffed,\npushing yourself away from the kitchen counter.</p><p>Jungkook grabbed your upper arm, stopping you\nbefore you could walk around the kitchen aisle and escape from him.</p><p>&ldquo;You should stay away from me and everything\nthat surrounds me. The boys, the fights&hellip; Everything.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked back at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I care <i>too\nmuch,</i>&rdquo; he said, his voice so low you could barely hear it in the silence of\nyour apartment.</p><p>&ldquo;Funny way of showing it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never been good at it, but if there&rsquo;s one\nthing I&rsquo;m good at, is pushing people away,&rdquo; he sighed.</p><p>His eyes never left yours as those words left\nhis lips. The intensity of his gaze on yours told you he wanted you to read in\nbetween those lines.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only get hurt if you keep being around\nme,&rdquo; he breathed, pulling you closer to him.</p><p>You let him push you and move you and do you\nlike a puppet, like you always did, his callous fingers, filled with scars,\nplaying with the strings of your heart.</p><p>&ldquo;If you care about someone you don&rsquo;t push them\naway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do when their safety it&rsquo;s at stake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t try to convince you of something you\ndon&rsquo;t want to be convinced of,&rdquo; you said, shaking your head.</p><p>He shook his head too.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to convince me about anything.&rdquo;</p><p>His face was so close to yours you could feel\nevery breath, every sound. You could smell him and feel him and sense him. So\nclose yet so far.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I could love you, but I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said\nthose words slowly and quietly, knowing that they would feel like daggers to\nyou.</p><p>He leaned a bit closer, and being in the state\nof shock you were, you let him. He leaned his forehead against yours, closing\nhis eyes and feeling you too.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay away from me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s\nbest.&rdquo;</p><p>You scrunched your face up in disgust, placing\nyour hands on his chest and pushing him away from you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep on the couch tonight,&rdquo; you\nwhispered. &ldquo;I have to be at the hospital first thing tomorrow morning, I don&rsquo;t\nwant to see you here when I wake up.&rdquo;</p><p>That being said, you took some steps back, the\nhand that Jungkook had placed on your left cheek &ndash; and that you hadn&rsquo;t even\nfelt until then &ndash; falling limply to his side. </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t even cry that night as you laid on\nyour couch, feeling as if you had already been expecting what had happened. He\ncouldn&rsquo;t love you because he couldn&rsquo;t love at all, he had shown you a couple of\ntimes, but you had been na&iuml;ve enough to let your feelings and stupid daydreams\nblind you.</p><p>His words echoed through your mind.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t love you. Simple as that. </p><p>And when you woke up the next morning, he was\nalready gone.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>But life carried on, it always did.</p><p>You felt as if you had been given a second\nchance, the chance to take the right path once again. A path you had walked\naway from when you had decided to take part in the underground fighting world.</p><p>You left your apartment in March, when all of\nyour savings were long gone from your bank account and you couldn&rsquo;t afford it\nanymore. It was difficult moving to a dorm after living on your own for almost\nfour years, but it had to be done so you could at least graduate. Plus, working\npart-time at a book store wasn&rsquo;t that bad either, you had loads of time to work\non your thesis. </p><p>The worst part of it all wasn&rsquo;t moving to a\ndorm or finding a part-time job, no. The worst part was distancing yourself\nfrom the people that had been your friends during the past six months. They had\nmade you feel so comfortable with yourself, had made you feel so alive taking\nyou out of your comfort zone, that they had almost felt like family. How\ncouldn&rsquo;t they be called family when they had made you feel as if you fitted in\nso perfectly? </p><p>Of course you still kept in touch with Evey,\nbut always via text. </p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t stare at her and lie to her, you\ncouldn&rsquo;t act as if nothing had happened, and you couldn&rsquo;t stare at her laughing\nand kissing Taehyung knowing everything he was hiding. Yes, he was hiding\neverything from her to protect her, but still, he was lying to her. </p><p>But you weren&rsquo;t just distancing yourself from\nthe boys because you had realized it was not your world, that you didn&rsquo;t &ndash; and\ncouldn&rsquo;t &ndash; belong to a place like that, follow such a lifestyle. You were\ndistancing yourself because you couldn&rsquo;t stand de idea of seeing Jungkook after\nthose nine words he said to you. </p><p><i>I wish I could love\nyou, but I can&rsquo;t.</i></p><p>They bounced inside your mind, echoing and\nleaving you numb and tired. You couldn&rsquo;t think of anything that weren&rsquo;t those\nnine words, again and again. Why couldn&rsquo;t he love you? Was if because of you?\nWas it because of the circumstances? Was it because he just <i>couldn&rsquo;t love?</i></p><p>Whatever the case it was, he couldn&rsquo;t love you.</p><p>It was the saddest part of it all, because you\nknew that you would never stop loving him. You sometimes wondered how had you\nbeen able to fall in love with someone like him, so cocky and problematic and\nrude. An asshole from head to toe. A boy who lived for violence and breathed\ndanger. A boy who didn&rsquo;t give a fuck about anything, not even his life, risking\nit again and again. </p><p>But then, memories of you and him lying on your\nbed at three am assaulted you. They were the most dangerous memories of them\nall. Memories of his skin glowing in the moonlight, memories of his scent and\nhis raspy voice. Memories of his round eyes that held a thousand galaxies when\nthe streetlights reflected on them. Memories of his fingertips against your\nskin as he tickled you. Memories of his laugh and his smile &ndash; the same smile\nthat made him look almost innocent. Memories of your stomach hurting at how hard\nhe made you laugh. Memories of you closing your eyes as he hummed one of his\nfavorite songs while he thought you couldn&rsquo;t hear him. Memories of the random\nconversations you held in the middle of the night. Memories of feeling free,\nand beautiful and infinite while being with him. Memories of him and his, and\nhim again, and his&hellip; And when it started to feel so overwhelming that you\ncouldn&rsquo;t breathe, it&rsquo;s when you were lastly reminded of the love you felt for\nhim. </p><p>With the end of winter season and the blooming\nof flowers, things started to feel&hellip; Alright.</p><p>You still thought about Jungkook, but it didn&rsquo;t\nhurt anymore, nor did you repeat his words in your mind constantly during the\nday. </p><p>Time passed, in every meaning the of the word\npass.</p><p>Time passed and you started thinking that\nmaybe, one day, you would forget about everything that had happened. That you\nwould forget about him.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;How long\ntill you graduate?&rdquo; your tutor nurse said, smiling at you on your way down to\nthe basement of the hospital. </p><p>&ldquo;A month\nand a half,&rdquo; you smiled back, a bit shy.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God!\nYou&rsquo;re so close!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you\nnervous?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only a\nbit, I&rsquo;m more nervous about the thesis, to be honest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how\nare you doing?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>Once the\ndoors of the elevator opened, you both stepped out of it and started walking\ntowards the changing room. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine, it&rsquo;s\nalmost finished,&rdquo; you sighed, relieved. You would have never thought you would\nsay something like that. Your thesis, almost finished&hellip; That sounded like music\nto your ears. &ldquo;It only needs a few final touches and&hellip; <i>C&rsquo;est fini</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure\nyou&rsquo;ll ace it,&rdquo; the nurse nodded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a great nurse, Y/N, you have future\nin this.&rdquo;</p><p>You bit\nyour lower lip.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope so,\nI don&rsquo;t want to forget why I studied this in the first place, why I love it so\nmuch.&rdquo;</p><p>You both\nstopped in front of the door of the students&rsquo; changing room.</p><p>&ldquo;There will\nbe days when you&rsquo;ll feel like forgetting all about it, but then, you&rsquo;ll see\nyour patients smiling at you, trusting you with their lives, and you&rsquo;ll\nremember it.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember\nit every day, and that&rsquo;s what keeps me going,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Would it not be for\nthat; I&rsquo;d be owning a flower shop right now. Flowers never make you cry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That\nsounds like a good plan B.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo;\nshe laughed. She patted your back a few times. &ldquo;Have a good weekend, see you on\nMonday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You too,\nsee you on Monday!&rdquo;</p><p>With the\nfirst days of May, the slightly warmer weather arrived too.</p><p>It was a\nbit late and you had missed your bus, so, instead of waiting twenty minutes for\nthe next one, you decided to take a walk. The night breeze was calm, and the\nsky was completely clear. Your oversized bomber jacket and your headphones were\neverything you needed.</p><p>Plus, the\ndorms were closer to the hospital than your apartment had been.</p><p>It had\nsaddened you, to say goodbye to your independence, to your small living room,\nand your open kitchen. To your bedroom, and your comfy bed, with its fluffy\nsheets and floral cushions, the lights that seeped through the windows each\nnight and the sunrays every morning. It had saddened you to say goodbye to\neverything that had happened inside that apartment, and all the memories you\nhad made in there. But life had to carry on, and that apartment was now part of\nyour past.</p><p>You hummed\nsoftly along with the music playing through your headphones.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t\nwant to think about the past now, you were a new Y/N, a new and better Y/N.</p><p>The music\nblocked you form the outside world as you kept walking through the now familiar\nstreets of your new neighborhood.</p><p> &ldquo;Mhmm&hellip;&rdquo; you hummed.</p><p>Your eyes\ntravelled across the empty streets, only you and the streetlamps in them. As\nyour eyes focused on the shadow that the streetlights casted of your figure,\nyou noticed a second shadow.</p><p>Immediately,\nyou unlocked your phone and turned off the volume. Nothing.</p><p>You looked\nagain at the sidewalk. The shadow was there, just a few meters away from yours.</p><p>Breath\ncatching in your throat, you sped up, your footsteps becoming quicker and\nshorter. Your heart started beating wildly inside your chest and your whole body\nprepared itself to start running.</p><p>Taking off\nyour headphones, you looked backwards. There it, was, the shadow that had been\nfollowing you in the shape of a tall, big man. His dark eyes met yours.</p><p>You gasped\nand immediately started running. </p><p>Running ha\nnever been your strong point, but you weren&rsquo;t far from your dorm building and\nthe adrenaline pumping through your veins made you run faster and resist more.</p><p>You began\nhearing the heavy footsteps behind you once you turned around the next corner.\nYou could already see your building&hellip;</p><p>Trying to\nbe smart, you thought about misleading the man and taking a sharp turn. If you\nran towards your dorm, you would be safe tonight but he would know where you\nlived and he would be waiting for you the next time you walked out of the\nbuilding. </p><p>Without\nthinking twice, you took a turn to your left in the first street you found. It\nwas a bit dark, only a few old streetlamps lighting the place. You kept\nrunning, trying to reach the other side where it would lead to a bigger street.\nBut your luck wasn&rsquo;t with you that night, and instead of a street you had found\na alleyway. And it didn&rsquo;t have a way out of it.</p><p>Your body\ncrashed against the fence, heavy breaths leaving your lips in erratic puffs as\nyour knuckles hit the fence with rage. Fuck. </p><p>Pure fear\nsettled in your body as you turned around, finding the man walking towards you\nwith a mischievous smile on his face. He was walking slowly, knowing &ndash; just\nlike you knew &ndash; that you didn&rsquo;t have a way out of that. </p><p>Your eyes scanned\nthe place, your self-defense classes mode on. You tried to find a place where\nyou could escape the man and run away from that alley. Maybe, if you let him\napproach you some more and then took a sharp turn to your right and ran towards\nthe opening of the alley&hellip;</p><p>You stood\nstill, letting the man approach you.</p><p>Just when\nhe walked closer to you, a streetlamp lighted his features. Your breath got\ncaught in your throat as you recognized him. He was Jiwon&rsquo;s brother.</p><p>He laughed,\nthe sound echoing around the place. He could see the recognition in your eyes,\nhe could smell your fear.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to\nsee you again, doll,&rdquo; he said in a low voice that sent shivers running down\nyour spine.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I\ncould say the same,&rdquo; you said in between erratic breaths.</p><p>You had to\nbe strong, or at least, act as if you were.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are\nyou so scared?&rdquo; he purred. &ldquo;I just wanna talk to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you\nremember what happened to you the last time you tried talking to me?&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes\nshone with danger.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course\nI do&hellip; I think I remember telling you I didn&rsquo;t like bad girls, huh? They all\nneed to be taught a lesson. Well, I still think the same.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you\nwanna teach me some bad self-defense lesson, save it, I already know everything\nI need.&rdquo;</p><p>The man\nsmirked, his hand reaching for something in the back pocket of his jeans. When\nit came back, you saw something metallic in his hand. A low click sounded\nbefore a knife appeared. The dim light in the alleyway reflected on its blade.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, yeah?\nWell, I think your stupid self-defense lessons didn&rsquo;t teach you anything about\nknives, huh? Do you really know everything you need?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call\nthe police.&rdquo;</p><p>You grabbed\nyour phone with more strength in your hands, protecting it.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid\nthat, if you do, you won&rsquo;t be able to tell them anything when they arrive.&rdquo;</p><p>You gulped.\n</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nsuch a great coward if you need a knife against an unarmed person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I call it\nbeing prudent, I won&rsquo;t take risks tonight,&rdquo; he said, voice low as he approached\nyou some more.</p><p>That was\nit, it was your last chance of running away.</p><p>Blinking a\nfew times, you didn&rsquo;t even give him enough time to process what you were about\nto do. You avoided him, taking a turn to your right and running towards the\nentrance of the alleyway. Your footsteps were quick, but your legs weren&rsquo;t as\nlong as his and soon, you felt a grip on your bomber jacket.</p><p>He pulled\nyou backwards until your back crashed against his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do\nyou think you&rsquo;re going? We still haven&rsquo;t talked,&rdquo; he growled in your ear,\ngrabbing strands of your hair and forcing you towards the end of the alleyway\nonce again.</p><p>You started\nto scream, but his hand clasped itself over your mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Shh,&rdquo; he\npurred. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want anyone interrupting us, do we?&rdquo;</p><p>You opened\nyour mouth, but not to scream. You parted your lips and sunk your teeth on the\npalm of his hand. You bit with strength until you felt the skin tearing\nunderneath your teeth, and the man let out a strangled cry.</p><p>He let go\nof you for some seconds, enough for you to try to escape again, but his other\nhand was still holding your hair and he yanked you backwards.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that to a person who&rsquo;s trying to talk to you&hellip; That&rsquo;s\nrude.&rdquo;</p><p>You stood\nstill and felt his knee hitting the bottom of your back. Numb with pain, you\nfell on your knees. Your hands fled back to hold the sore area, and you closed\nyour eyes, fighting to not cry. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you\ngoing to stay still now?&rdquo; he growled, crouching on the floor before you. &ldquo;I\ncould have hit you harder, I could break a couple of vertebras&hellip; Maybe you\nwouldn&rsquo;t be able to escape then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do\nyou want from me?&rdquo; you said through gritted teeth, head hanging low.</p><p>He grabbed\nyour hair once again and forced you to look up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the\none doing the questions here, alright?&rdquo; he spat. You stood quiet; mouth shut.\n&ldquo;Alright?!&rdquo; he repeated, yanking your hair upwards.</p><p>&ldquo;A-alright,&rdquo;\nyou stuttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Good\ngirl,&rdquo; he smiled, and his smile almost made you puke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure a little\nnurse like you can tell what things I can do to you to make you suffer without\nhaving to kill you, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Your lower\nlip trembled, but you fought against yourself and your fear to remain\nunbothered.</p><p>&ldquo;Answer\nme,&rdquo; he growled through clenched teeth. &ldquo;Each time I ask you something I want\nyou to answer to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright\nand right are rhetorical questions,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know if you know\nwhat a rhetorical question is, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be answered.&rdquo;</p><p>A harsh\nblow was delivered to your cheek, making your neck snap to the side in a harsh\nmovement. You turned your head back to look at him, not wanting to miss any of\nhis movements.</p><p>&ldquo;You think\nyou&rsquo;re brave for answering me like that? You&rsquo;re more stupid than I thought,&rdquo; he\nsaid, his smirk reappearing on his lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to have Jeon here so he\ncould see what I&rsquo;m about to do to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes\nwidened as you saw him lean closer to you. You tried to stand up, but he\ngrabbed your hair with strength and kept you pinned to the ground. You closed\nyour eyes, but you could feel his breath against your neck.</p><p>&ldquo;What a\nshame the boss needs you alive&hellip;&rdquo; he sighed and distanced himself from you.</p><p>In a harsh\nmovement, he let go of your hair, your back hitting the ground with a loud\n&lsquo;humpf&rsquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;You can\nopen your eyes, I&rsquo;m only going to make you a few questions,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;But of\ncourse, if you don&rsquo;t behave, you won&rsquo;t return home untouched.&rdquo;</p><p>You blinked\nrapidly, blinking away the tears that had begun to pool in your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s\nJeon?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p><p>&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;\nyou stuttered, still a bit in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;You heard\nme, where&rsquo;s Jeon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow.&rdquo;</p><p>Jiwon&rsquo;s\nbrother crouched once again so he was eye-level with you. </p><p>&ldquo;Lying to\nme is not part of behaving like a good girl. C&rsquo;mon, I will give you a second\nchance. Where&rsquo;s Jeon Jungkook?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow, I swear.&rdquo;</p><p>The man\nnarrowed his eyes at you.</p><p>&ldquo;How can\nyou not know if you&rsquo;re his girl?&rdquo;</p><p>At the\nmention of you as Jungkook&rsquo;s girl, your heart skipped a beat. How could you be\nso weak for him?</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not\nhis girl, and I&rsquo;ve never been. I don&rsquo;t see where he is, nor I care.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you\nneed a third chance? Alright, where&rsquo;s Jeon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nalready told you! I don&rsquo;t know! I haven&rsquo;t seen him in months, I haven&rsquo;t heard\nfrom him or any of his friends either!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what\nabout that friend of yours that&rsquo;s with Kim?&rdquo;</p><p>You gritted\nyour teeth at the mention of Evey.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept\nin contact with her, but we never talk about Jungkook?&rdquo;</p><p>The man\nstared into your eyes as if searching for something. You held his gaze. You\nwere telling the truth, there was no way you would break the stare contest\nfirst.</p><p>&ldquo;But you\nonce were with him, you must know where he goes when he wants to hide.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never\nknew him that well,&rdquo; you breathed. It hurt, but that wasn&rsquo;t a lie either. </p><p>He grabbed\nhis knife with more strength for you to see it.</p><p>&ldquo;You better\nnot be lying to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. I\ndon&rsquo;t know where he is, but if I&rsquo;m being honest, if I knew, I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you\neither.&rdquo;</p><p>The man\narched a brow in understanding. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo; he\nmocked you. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in love with Jeon&hellip; That explains everything. Poor girl,&rdquo; he\npouted.</p><p>You\nclenched your teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nneed to punish you or teach you any lesson, falling in love with Jeon Jungkook\nit&rsquo;s enough suffering on itself,&rdquo; he laughed. You closed your eyes, somehow his\nwords hurt more than his blows had. &ldquo;My brother told me about it, though. He\nthought you were stupid too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jiwon\nknows you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jiwon was\nthe one who told me where you would be and where I would be able to find you,&rdquo;\nhe smirked. &ldquo;Are you na&iuml;ve enough to think that my brother approached you just\nbecause he found you pretty and funny? Well&hellip; You caught feelings for Jeon, so\nyeah, you&rsquo;re na&iuml;ve enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew\nyour brother was using me just to return the favor to Jungkook, I just took\nadvantage of that too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He knows\ntoo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you\nwant to know where Jungkook is?&rdquo;</p><p>The man\nclicked his tongue. &ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one doing the questions\nhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You and\nyour brother work for that Mr. Kang man, don&rsquo;t you? That&rsquo;s why you wanna find\nJungkook? Because you weren&rsquo;t able to finish your work with him.&rdquo;</p><p>Jiwon&rsquo;s\nbrother narrowed his eyes.</p><p>He grabbed\nyour face with one of his huge hands, forcing you to stare straight at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen to\nme, doll,&rdquo; he spat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing fine by staying out of this, but it&rsquo;s too\nlate to forget about you. Find Jeon and tell him that he better fight the\nwrestling final in two weeks. If he doesn&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll start interrogating people&hellip;\nAnd this time, it will be people he loves and not a girl he used to fuck and\nthat now is stupidly in love with him, understood?&rdquo;</p><p>His words\nfelt like pure ice sinking into the bottom of your heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Understood?&rdquo;\nhe said, grabbing your jaw.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you\nbreathed.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he\nsaid, letting go of you. Your jaw hurt from his tight grip. &ldquo;Now carry on with\nyour life and don&rsquo;t do anything stupid, we&rsquo;re keeping a close eye on you.\nFinish your thesis, graduate, move from this shitty city and find a boy who\ndeserves you and loves you back.&rdquo;</p><p>And with\nthat, he turned around and disappeared from the alley, leaving you alone.</p><p>Everything\nyou had been feeling since you found out you were being followed, downed on\nyou. You grabbed your knees and hid your face in between them, letting your\ntears fall freely and the sobs interrupt your breaths. </p><p>His words\nhad hurt more than his blows and threats, and that was what scared you the\nmost.</p></p>",

I can\u2019t get enough of this song or watching them perform it, Dionysus has such a powerful energy that I am loving so much. <br></p><p>[C] Don\u2019t hurt me but I haven\u2019t even listened to the rest of their album yet.\u00a0 But I\u2019m looking forward to this BTS always has really good stages. I\u2019m regretting not listening to the rest of the album sooner, I\u2019m loving Dionysus so far. V is looking damn good in this performance. After I\u2019m done this I\u2019m going to go finally give the album a listen.<br></p>",
