This was a regular routine for you both on a Wednesday night after you\u2019ve finished your Chemistry homework. Just sitting and reflecting.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know, let me get through high school first and then I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d you respond cheekily.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI want to go to MIT,\u201d Peter says wistfully.</i></p><p><i>You smile and stare back up at the ceiling. \u201cYou\u2019ll go, I know you will.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Peter turns his head and gives you a small smile. He reaches over to put his hand on top of yours. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI know for sure that I see myself growing old with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You feel your cheeks reden. Even though he was your best friend, you still couldn\u2019t stop the butterflies from fluttering in your stomach.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat if we move far away from each other for college?\u201d you inquire.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll visit you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat if you meet a girl?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re my best girl.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re busy?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll never be too busy for you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou say that now, but you\u2019re already busy with your Stark Internship.\u201d You bite your lip.</i></p><p><i>You feel his hand tighten around yours. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to be,\u201d he says lowly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry, I know you\u2019re doing great things. Just don\u2019t forget about me, yeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He gives you a wide grin. \u201cNever.\u201d</i></p><p>&ndash;</p><p><b>Five Years Later</b></p><p>\u201cHey Amy, have you seen my green sweater?\u201d you ask your roommate as you pass through the kitchen in a hurry. You\u2019re about to be late to your Women in Lit class and you can\u2019t find your favorite sweater anywhere. It was hunter green with dark blue stripes. It reminded you of winter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, have you checked the hamper?\u201d she calls out from the living room. </p><p>You roll your eyes. Hello Captain Obvious. </p><p>\u201cI did!\u201d you shout from the bathroom. You put your long hair up in a messy bun and are about to brush your teeth when you hear a knock at the door. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d you hear Amy call out. You hear the door open and then low mumbling in the background as you brush your teeth. You\u2019re finishing up when you hear, \u201cY/N, can you come out here.\u201d</p><p>You furrow your eyebrows and rinse your toothbrush before putting it back in its holder. You take a look at yourself in the mirror and grimace. Whoever was at the door shouldn\u2019t be subjected to seeing you like this. You quickly pull the elastic from your hair and shake your hair out. You then walk out of the bathroom and head towards the front door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of in a hurry, Aims, what\u2019s up&hellip;\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when you see him. You stop dead in your tracks. Your mouth drops slightly and your eyes widen. You had heard that people had come back. Family and friends being reunited. You had imagined him returning, but it was different seeing him in front of you after all this time. He hadn\u2019t aged a bit since you last saw him, and you couldn\u2019t help but feel your heart drop. It was the universe\u2019s sick joke. He still looked 15, and you had visibly aged now that you were 20.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Y/N,\u201d he greets.</p><p>It\u2019s dead silence and you can see Amy from the corner of your eye step away from the scene. \u201cHey Y/N, I\u2019m going to head to class so I\u2019ll see you later\u2026 nice to meet you, Peter,\u201d she mumbles.</p><p>Both you and Peter don\u2019t even flinch as Amy quickly gathers her belongings and exits from the small apartment.</p><p>A few moments pass after the door closes shut. It\u2019s just you two now. You don\u2019t know what to say. You\u2019ve thought about this moment for years, ever since he disappeared without a trace. You weren\u2019t there when it happened. You just heard from his Aunt that he was gone. Your heart was broken for years. Your best friend and your first love was gone. Years of planning your future together had slipped away the moment he disintegrated from the universe.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cYou grew up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disappeared.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightens and he quickly looks down at his feet. \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>You slowly take a step closer to him. You wish for nothing more than to touch him and hold him close. You want to bury your face in his chest and let him stroke your hair. Despite him being five years younger than you, he\u2019s still a head taller than you and you just want him to lean down and press his lips against yours. There is so much wanting in this moment yet you restrain yourself. He\u2019s practically still a child.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2026 when?\u201d You stammer.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>And yes, it all made sense. That\u2019s when they all came back. </p><p>\u201cI went to your apartment,\u201d he continues, \u201cyour mom almost had a heart attack when she saw me. She looks good by the way\u2026 she uh\u2026 told me that you were going to school in Connecticut so took a train here to see you. I\u2026 I wanted to see if you remembered me.\u201d</p><p>You look at him incredulously. \u201cOf course I remember you,\u201d you say, your voice just above a whisper.</p><p>He takes a couple steps closer to you until he\u2019s right in front of you. You look up and his eyes lock with yours. He hesitantly wraps his arms around you. You freeze in his embrace. No matter how many times you wished for this moment, you can\u2019t help but feel your chest tighten. He was real, and he was here.</p><p>\u201cThis feels nice,\u201d he says softly into your ear. You melt at his words and feel your body relax. You slowly wrap your arms around him and for a moment, everything seems okay.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>\u201cI failed,\u201d you groan, as your head rests on the outside of your locker. You feel a hand soothingly rub your shoulder. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHey, don\u2019t say that. I bet you did great.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You sigh and look up. Peter was ever the optimist.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say, you\u2019re a genius.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He chuckles, leaning against the locker next to yours. \u201cGenius is quite the compliment.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You lift your head from your locker. \u201cYou know it\u2019s true.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd I know that you probably aced the exam. C\u2019mon, you studied for weeks! Ten times more than me and Ned did.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He wraps an arm around your shoulder and gives you a squeeze.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBelieve in yourself, Y/N. Life may surprise you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You smile, as he drops his arm and lets you go. He always knew what to say to make you feel better.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWant to come over tonight for dinner? Mom\u2019s making spaghetti, your favoriteeee,\u201d you singsong.</i></p><p><i>His expression immediately changes as he furrows his brows. \u201cUmm\u2026 I\u2026 I can\u2019t tonight actually. I got this thing with the Stark Internship and I can\u2019t get out of it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Your face falls slightly. \u201cOh\u2026 okay.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNext time for sure though!\u201d</i></p><p><i>That\u2019s what he said last time.</i></p><p><i>You give him a forced smile and nod in understanding. He gives your shoulder a gentle squeeze. He looks down at his watch.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh shit, I gotta run\u2026 but I\u2019ll see you later, Y/N!\u201d he says as he scurries down the hallway, disappearing from sight.</i></p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You\u2019re both sitting down at your small kitchen table. There\u2019s not much space between you two, as the table is no longer than a couple feet wide. A mug of hot tea sits in front of you. Your Women in Lit class is long forgotten. You never missed a class before anyways. Peter quickly glances between his glass of water and you. After your embrace, you awkwardly showed him around your apartment and then settled on planting yourselves in the kitchen. Another bought of silence fills the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat grade are you in now?\u201d he asks, breaking the dead air. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sophomore in college,\u201d you respond before taking a sip of your tea.</p><p>\u201cWhat do\u2026 what are you majoring in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnglish Literature\u2026 I\u2019m studying to be a teacher.\u201d</p><p>He gives you a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to becoming a doctor like your parents wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecided life was too short to not follow your heart.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cDid\u2026,\u201d he hesitates, \u201cDid any of your family\u2026 disappear?\u201d</p><p>You take another sip of your tea and shake your head. \u201cNo\u2026 we were one of the lucky ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was glad that Aunt May hadn\u2019t\u2026 went away. But I\u2019m sad she worried about me for all those years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything during that time that you were gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answers, rubbing the back of his neck nervously, \u201cI honestly just remember fading away and then just reappearing. It\u2019s like time didn\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>You stroke the side of your mug with your thumb, the heat emanating through the ceramic. It feels warm, comforting. You close your eyes for a moment and picture what he must\u2019ve felt. The feeling of turning into nothingness. You had seen people disappear with your own two eyes. The shock and pain you felt would haunt you for the rest of your life. You remember reaching out and trying to grasp at them and instead, they were dust in your fingertips. You shudder at the thought.</p><p>You reopen your eyes and see Peter looking at you intently. He reaches over and takes your hand into his. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened while I was gone?\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s a loaded question. \u2018Who are you now?\u2019 is the question you know he\u2019s trying to ask. Different snapshots of the last five years fill your mind. </p><p>\u201cWhere do I begin?\u201d </p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>You\u2019re lazily reading your World History textbook and eating your lunch when you notice a shadow cast over you. You look up and sigh heavily before grumbling, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Peter takes a seat next to you. You scoot over to put some distance between you and him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI came to apologize\u2026 I know I\u2019ve been acting weird lately.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWeird? You\u2019ve been nonexistent for the past month.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N. I know I\u2019ve been a total jerk. Things with the Stark Internship got crazy, but I\u2019ve straightened out my priorities.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, your priorities with Liz?\u201d You scowl, stabbing a piece of lettuce with your fork. The memory of Peter ditching you and your friends to go to Homecoming with the pretty senior only to disappear for the rest of the night flashes in your mind.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing between me and Liz.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to imagine,\u201d you mutter, taking another bite of your salad.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPlease look me at, Y/N.\u201d </i></p><p><i>You reluctantly put your fork down and turn your body to face Peter. His eyes are pleading with you and you can\u2019t help but soften a bit.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m truly sorry for how I\u2019ve been acting lately. I\u2019ll be better.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You sigh again, but this time in defeat. It was hard staying mad at your best friend. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be better, Pete. You just have to be you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You take his hand into your yours and squeeze it gently.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre we good?\u201d he asks, eyes staring into yours.</i></p><p><i>You nod and give him a small smile. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re good.\u201d</i></p><p>&ndash;</p><p>\u201cAnd how was graduation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you would\u2019ve hated it!\u201d You lean back in your chair and continue, \u201cit was super depressing. I think that after half the class disappeared, going to school just\u2026 wasn\u2019t the same. It was just a reminder of all the things we had lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must\u2019ve been hard\u2026 seeing us disappear and then having to continue doing stuff.\u201d</p><p>You look at him thoughtfully. \u201cIt was\u2026 but it got better eventually. It hurt less and less everyday. I made new friends, I went to therapy\u2026 life kept going and I began to move on.\u201d</p><p>You see the pain in his eyes after the words come out of your mouth. Moving on? What did that even mean? It just meant that you weren\u2019t going to dwell on the \u2018what ifs\u2019 anymore. You spent the year after he disappeared ridden with guilt and heartbreak. You wished you had disappeared too. You lost your only friends and you subsequently lost a piece of yourself. Your parents watched you become a hollow shell of who you once were. It was a time in your life that you want to forget. But it made you the person you are today, and you\u2019re stronger because of it.</p><p>Peter blinks and the look in his eyes are gone. Instead he\u2019s smiling haphazardly, trying to regain some composure. \u201cWhat\u2019s college like?\u201d he asks, words laced with fake cheerfulness.</p><p>You force a smile.</p><p>\u201cCollege is great, Pete. You have so much freedom and you\u2019re learning things that you actually want to learn. Right now, I\u2019m focusing on Renaissance Literature and Jane Austen. It\u2019s amazing. You\u2019ll really love it.\u201d</p><p>He smiles genuinely and takes a sip of his water. He licks his lips and takes a deep breath. \u201cDo you\u2026 uh\u2026 do you have a boyfriend?\u201d he stutters, looking down at the table.</p><p>You tilt your head and look at him as he tries to avoid eye contact with you. You knew this question would come up eventually.</p><p>\u201cI did\u2026 we\u2026 we broke up six months ago.\u201d</p><p>He looks up at you. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just decided that things weren\u2019t working out,\u201d you say with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cHow long were you together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two years\u2026 we met during my senior year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he was a freshman in college when we started dating. We met at a college recruiting event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026 did you love him?\u201d</p><p>You nod your head slowly. \u201cYes\u2026 yes I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you loved me?\u201d He looks at you in anticipation.</p><p>You breathe in deeply. \u201cI could never.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>\u201cMy name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!\u201d Peter says along with the movie.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHas to be one of the best lines in cinema,\u201d you say, reaching into the bowl of popcorn in Peter\u2019s lap. </i></p><p><i>You both are sitting on Peter\u2019s bed watching The Princess Bride, one of your regulars.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSecond only to \u2018Luke, I am your father,\u2019\u201d Peter says, voice deep, mimicking Darth Vader.</i></p><p><i>You laugh and lean your head on Peter\u2019s shoulder. He instinctively leans into you. You are silent as you continue watching the movie. A few minutes pass before Peter starts fidgeting with his fingers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey Y/N?\u201d he interrupts.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for a long time&hellip;\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSince elementary school.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know me better than anyone\u2026 even better than Ned.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI would hope so.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo you know I\u2019m not the best with talking about my feelings\u2026 especially after Uncle Ben died\u2026 but I\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>He pauses and you patiently wait for him to continue.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026,\u201d he stutters, \u201cI love you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay\u2026 I love you too,\u201d you say nonchalantly. Of course you loved your best friend.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo\u2026 I mean, while I do love you as a friend\u2026 I meant\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m in love with you\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>You lift your head from his shoulder and look at him square in the face. You see him gulp and he moves the bowl of popcorn to the floor.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d</i></p><p><i>A look of relief washes over Peter\u2019s face. It\u2019s like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m in love you, Y/N. I think I have been for a while. And I know, I know I\u2019m only 15 and I don\u2019t exactly know what it means to be in love, but there\u2019s no other way to describe the way I feel about you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d you ask, reaching out to stroke his arm gently.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt just did. I feel like everyday could be my last\u2026 I mean, I could get hit by a schoolbus or get struck by lightning, and\u2026 and I don\u2019t want to pass up the opportunity to tell my best friend that I\u2019m in love with her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You look down at his bedsheets. It\u2019s Star Wars themed with a pattern of lightsabers and planets. You remember when he got these sheets. You\u2019re too young to know what love is, but you also know that you\u2019re bound to Peter in ways that you can\u2019t even describe yourself. </i></p><p><i>You don\u2019t say anything. You just slowly reach out and wrap your arms around him. You bury your face in the crook of his neck, and he tentatively pulls you in closer. You don\u2019t move, you both just hold each other, taking the moment in. A boy has never told you he was in love you before. You can\u2019t help but feel content and elated. Maybe this is what love is. </i></p><p><i>You pull your face away from him and stare into his brown eyes.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it back\u2026\u201d he starts.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you too, Pete,\u201d you blurt, your face inches from his.</i></p><p><i>\u201cReally?\u201d He chokes out. You smile shyly and nod. Yes, you were in love with Peter Parker, the boy who\u2019s battled bullies for you, cried with you, and has always been there for you.</i></p><p><i>His eyes dart between your eyes and your lips. \u201cCan I\u2026 can I kiss you?\u201d He asks nervously.</i></p><p><i>You smile even wider. \u201cOkay,\u201d you respond. You just stare at his lips for a moment. This is your first kiss. \u2018Would you be bad at it?\u2019 you think to yourself. You hesitantly lean in and gently brush your lips against his. It\u2019s soft at first as he envelopes you deeper in his embrace. </i></p><p><i>You continue pressing your lips against his. He\u2019s so warm and lips are soft. You become bolder by opening your mouth. You tentatively begin massaging your tongues together as you run your hands through his hair.</i></p><p><i>He moans and you reluctantly break away. You press your foreheads together as you pant heavily.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow,\u201d he breathes.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDitto.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He smiles and nuzzles his nose against yours. You smile against his lips and stroke the back of his neck. Your lips are just barely touching and you\u2019re breathing each other&rsquo;s air. You\u2019ve never felt this close to someone before, and you never want this feeling to end.</i></p><p>&ndash;</p><p>\u201cYour hair has gotten longer,\u201d he comments. You look up from your mug of tea.</p><p>He tentatively reaches his hand over the table to brush a piece of your hair away from your face. His hand lingers a bit and you reluctantly pull away. He retreats his hand quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mumbles, as he runs a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d you whisper, your heart twisting in your chest. You\u2019re aching for him to get close to you again. But you know it\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s so young, and you\u2019ve grown so much. You\u2019ve gotten so much older than him in these last five years. You graduated high school, you started college, you fell in love and you fell out of love, and you lost your virginity to someone who wasn\u2019t him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he nods sadly in understanding.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like to be back?\u201d</p><p>He bites his lip in thought. \u201cIt feels weird\u2026 but I\u2019m readjusting. I\u2019m back at school and just trying to keep moving forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\u2026 did Ned come back?\u201d </p><p>You remember your other friend, your only other friend. </p><p>\u201cHe did\u2026 he\u2019s doing well. A little shaken up, but he\u2019s coping. Trying to catch up on all the movies we\u2019ve missed,\u201d he laughs softly. \u201cWe\u2019re in the same classes too. Feels like how it used to be.\u201d</p><p>You look down sadly. You feel so left out. Apart of you wishes you could go back so you could trade notes with Peter in between periods, whine about Calculus together, and dissect what the mystery meat was in the cafeteria. But you quickly scold yourself. You went to high school already. You didn\u2019t disappear. They had five years stolen from them. They were stuck in time only to reappear and try to live a life that didn\u2019t wait for them. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>You\u2019re sitting on a school bus with your head leaning on Peter\u2019s shoulder as he quietly plays with his phone. You lean in closer and place a gentle kiss on his cheek.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWake me up when we get there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He looks at you and nods before kissing your forehead. \u201cLove you,\u201d he says softly, and you smile a bit before your heavy eyelids close. You don\u2019t say it back. You don\u2019t know why but you tell yourself that you\u2019ll tell him later.</i></p><p><i>You doze off for a few moments. In the background you think you hear Peter say, \u201cNed, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You then wake up abruptly to the sound of Ned screaming, \u201cHoly shit! We&rsquo;re all gonna die! There&rsquo;s a spaceship!\u201d</i></p><p><i>You look around and see the rest of your peers scramble to the windows in the back to see what the commotion is. You feel Peter slip away from you. You turn back around and notice he is gone. You frantically look for him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPeter?\u201d you shout, your voice drowned out by the shouts and hollers of the other students. \u201cPeter!\u201d</i></p><p><i>You notice his phone still laying on the seat beside you. You take it and clutch it close as you continue to look around the bus for him, but you know that he\u2019s already gone.</i></p><p>&ndash;</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for dropping in on you like this, I just had to see you,\u201d he says as you two walk towards the front door. It\u2019s getting late and Peter needs to catch the train back to New York.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry at all\u2026 I\u2019m glad you came,\u201d you touch his arm gently.</p><p>He gives you a small smile.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s next for you now, Peter Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish high school,\u201d he chuckles. </p><p>Silence fills the air again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for disappearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to keep apologizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean I\u2019m sorry I disappeared\u2026 on the bus.\u201d</p><p>You nod gently and bite your lip in thought. \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo save the world,\u201d he says with a smile.</p><p>You squint your eyes at him in curiosity and then you laugh softly. \u201cAlright, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 can, can I visit you again?\u201d He stammers.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019d like that,\u201d you respond, even though you know he won\u2019t. He\u2019ll get caught up in homework, parties, applying for college, and&hellip; girls. And you secretly hope that he does. You want him to be happy, even if it\u2019s not with you.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2026 maybe one day\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows what the future holds,\u201d you interrupt, \u201cwhen you\u2019re 20, I\u2019ll be 25\u2026 doesn\u2019t sound that bad, right?\u201d</p><p>He nods and rubs the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cBut for now,\u201d you continue, \u201clive your life, Pete. Enjoy being 15 and if you still feel the same way when you\u2019re older, I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you don\u2019t feel the same way?\u201d</p><p>You sigh. \u201cI never stopped, Pete.\u201d</p><p>It sounds like a promise.</p><p>He takes a step toward you and cups your face in his hands. \u201cNo matter what happens, you\u2019ll always be my best girl.\u201d</p><p>You give him a small smile, as your eyes slightly water. You think about him falling in love with someone else. You think about him going to prom, graduating high school, and starting college. You think about all the firsts that he\u2019ll experience without you and all the things that he\u2019ll do that you won\u2019t do together. That time has past for you, and now it\u2019s time for him to live his life and grow up\u2026 without you.</p><p>\u201cGet home safe, okay?\u201d you say, breaking the moment. \u201cTell May I said hello.\u201d</p><p>He removes his hands from your face. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>You walk over to the front door and open it. He walks towards the doorway and lingers for a moment as he walks past you. You lean your head against the doorframe as you watch him walk away. He\u2019s halfway down the hall when you remember something. That feeling of regret that had weighed you down for five years. You yell, \u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>He turns around and gives you a curious look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026,\u201d you start, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for not saying it back\u2026 on the bus that day.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t know if you needed to say it for him or for yourself. He looks confused for a moment before realization hits him. He gives you a crooked smile. \u201cYou never had to say it\u2026 I always knew.\u201d</p><p>You nod and smile. He gives you a final wave before he continues down the hallway and you watch him until he disappears from sight.</p>",

This was a regular routine for you both on a Wednesday night after you\u2019ve finished your Chemistry homework. Just sitting and reflecting.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know, let me get through high school first and then I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d you respond cheekily.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI want to go to MIT,\u201d Peter says wistfully.</i></p><p><i>You smile and stare back up at the ceiling. \u201cYou\u2019ll go, I know you will.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Peter turns his head and gives you a small smile. He reaches over to put his hand on top of yours. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI know for sure that I see myself growing old with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You feel your cheeks reden. Even though he was your best friend, you still couldn\u2019t stop the butterflies from fluttering in your stomach.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat if we move far away from each other for college?\u201d you inquire.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll visit you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat if you meet a girl?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re my best girl.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re busy?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll never be too busy for you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou say that now, but you\u2019re already busy with your Stark Internship.\u201d You bite your lip.</i></p><p><i>You feel his hand tighten around yours. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to be,\u201d he says lowly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry, I know you\u2019re doing great things. Just don\u2019t forget about me, yeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He gives you a wide grin. \u201cNever.\u201d</i></p><p>\u2013</p><p><b>Five Years Later</b></p><p>\u201cHey Amy, have you seen my green sweater?\u201d you ask your roommate as you pass through the kitchen in a hurry. You\u2019re about to be late to your Women in Lit class and you can\u2019t find your favorite sweater anywhere. It was hunter green with dark blue stripes. It reminded you of winter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, have you checked the hamper?\u201d she calls out from the living room. </p><p>You roll your eyes. Hello Captain Obvious. </p><p>\u201cI did!\u201d you shout from the bathroom. You put your long hair up in a messy bun and are about to brush your teeth when you hear a knock at the door. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d you hear Amy call out. You hear the door open and then low mumbling in the background as you brush your teeth. You\u2019re finishing up when you hear, \u201cY/N, can you come out here.\u201d</p><p>You furrow your eyebrows and rinse your toothbrush before putting it back in its holder. You take a look at yourself in the mirror and grimace. Whoever was at the door shouldn\u2019t be subjected to seeing you like this. You quickly pull the elastic from your hair and shake your hair out. You then walk out of the bathroom and head towards the front door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of in a hurry, Aims, what\u2019s up\u2026\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when you see him. You stop dead in your tracks. Your mouth drops slightly and your eyes widen. You had heard that people had come back. Family and friends being reunited. You had imagined him returning, but it was different seeing him in front of you after all this time. He hadn\u2019t aged a bit since you last saw him, and you couldn\u2019t help but feel your heart drop. It was the universe\u2019s sick joke. He still looked 15, and you had visibly aged now that you were 20.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Y/N,\u201d he greets.</p><p>It\u2019s dead silence and you can see Amy from the corner of your eye step away from the scene. \u201cHey Y/N, I\u2019m going to head to class so I\u2019ll see you later\u2026 nice to meet you, Peter,\u201d she mumbles.</p><p>Both you and Peter don\u2019t even flinch as Amy quickly gathers her belongings and exits from the small apartment.</p><p>A few moments pass after the door closes shut. It\u2019s just you two now. You don\u2019t know what to say. You\u2019ve thought about this moment for years, ever since he disappeared without a trace. You weren\u2019t there when it happened. You just heard from his Aunt that he was gone. Your heart was broken for years. Your best friend and your first love was gone. Years of planning your future together had slipped away the moment he disintegrated from the universe.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cYou grew up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disappeared.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightens and he quickly looks down at his feet. \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>You slowly take a step closer to him. You wish for nothing more than to touch him and hold him close. You want to bury your face in his chest and let him stroke your hair. Despite him being five years younger than you, he\u2019s still a head taller than you and you just want him to lean down and press his lips against yours. There is so much wanting in this moment yet you restrain yourself. He\u2019s practically still a child.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2026 when?\u201d You stammer.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>And yes, it all made sense. That\u2019s when they all came back. </p><p>\u201cI went to your apartment,\u201d he continues, \u201cyour mom almost had a heart attack when she saw me. She looks good by the way\u2026 she uh\u2026 told me that you were going to school in Connecticut so took a train here to see you. I\u2026 I wanted to see if you remembered me.\u201d</p><p>You look at him incredulously. \u201cOf course I remember you,\u201d you say, your voice just above a whisper.</p><p>He takes a couple steps closer to you until he\u2019s right in front of you. You look up and his eyes lock with yours. He hesitantly wraps his arms around you. You freeze in his embrace. No matter how many times you wished for this moment, you can\u2019t help but feel your chest tighten. He was real, and he was here.</p><p>\u201cThis feels nice,\u201d he says softly into your ear. You melt at his words and feel your body relax. You slowly wrap your arms around him and for a moment, everything seems okay.</p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>\u201cI failed,\u201d you groan, as your head rests on the outside of your locker. You feel a hand soothingly rub your shoulder. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHey, don\u2019t say that. I bet you did great.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You sigh and look up. Peter was ever the optimist.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say, you\u2019re a genius.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He chuckles, leaning against the locker next to yours. \u201cGenius is quite the compliment.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You lift your head from your locker. \u201cYou know it\u2019s true.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd I know that you probably aced the exam. C\u2019mon, you studied for weeks! Ten times more than me and Ned did.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He wraps an arm around your shoulder and gives you a squeeze.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBelieve in yourself, Y/N. Life may surprise you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You smile, as he drops his arm and lets you go. He always knew what to say to make you feel better.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWant to come over tonight for dinner? Mom\u2019s making spaghetti, your favoriteeee,\u201d you singsong.</i></p><p><i>His expression immediately changes as he furrows his brows. \u201cUmm\u2026 I\u2026 I can\u2019t tonight actually. I got this thing with the Stark Internship and I can\u2019t get out of it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Your face falls slightly. \u201cOh\u2026 okay.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNext time for sure though!\u201d</i></p><p><i>That\u2019s what he said last time.</i></p><p><i>You give him a forced smile and nod in understanding. He gives your shoulder a gentle squeeze. He looks down at his watch.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh shit, I gotta run\u2026 but I\u2019ll see you later, Y/N!\u201d he says as he scurries down the hallway, disappearing from sight.</i></p><p>\u2013</p><p>You\u2019re both sitting down at your small kitchen table. There\u2019s not much space between you two, as the table is no longer than a couple feet wide. A mug of hot tea sits in front of you. Your Women in Lit class is long forgotten. You never missed a class before anyways. Peter quickly glances between his glass of water and you. After your embrace, you awkwardly showed him around your apartment and then settled on planting yourselves in the kitchen. Another bought of silence fills the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat grade are you in now?\u201d he asks, breaking the dead air. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sophomore in college,\u201d you respond before taking a sip of your tea.</p><p>\u201cWhat do\u2026 what are you majoring in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnglish Literature\u2026 I\u2019m studying to be a teacher.\u201d</p><p>He gives you a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to becoming a doctor like your parents wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecided life was too short to not follow your heart.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cDid\u2026,\u201d he hesitates, \u201cDid any of your family\u2026 disappear?\u201d</p><p>You take another sip of your tea and shake your head. \u201cNo\u2026 we were one of the lucky ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was glad that Aunt May hadn\u2019t\u2026 went away. But I\u2019m sad she worried about me for all those years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything during that time that you were gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answers, rubbing the back of his neck nervously, \u201cI honestly just remember fading away and then just reappearing. It\u2019s like time didn\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>You stroke the side of your mug with your thumb, the heat emanating through the ceramic. It feels warm, comforting. You close your eyes for a moment and picture what he must\u2019ve felt. The feeling of turning into nothingness. You had seen people disappear with your own two eyes. The shock and pain you felt would haunt you for the rest of your life. You remember reaching out and trying to grasp at them and instead, they were dust in your fingertips. You shudder at the thought.</p><p>You reopen your eyes and see Peter looking at you intently. He reaches over and takes your hand into his. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened while I was gone?\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s a loaded question. \u2018Who are you now?\u2019 is the question you know he\u2019s trying to ask. Different snapshots of the last five years fill your mind. </p><p>\u201cWhere do I begin?\u201d </p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>You\u2019re lazily reading your World History textbook and eating your lunch when you notice a shadow cast over you. You look up and sigh heavily before grumbling, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Peter takes a seat next to you. You scoot over to put some distance between you and him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI came to apologize\u2026 I know I\u2019ve been acting weird lately.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWeird? You\u2019ve been nonexistent for the past month.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N. I know I\u2019ve been a total jerk. Things with the Stark Internship got crazy, but I\u2019ve straightened out my priorities.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, your priorities with Liz?\u201d You scowl, stabbing a piece of lettuce with your fork. The memory of Peter ditching you and your friends to go to Homecoming with the pretty senior only to disappear for the rest of the night flashes in your mind.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing between me and Liz.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to imagine,\u201d you mutter, taking another bite of your salad.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPlease look me at, Y/N.\u201d </i></p><p><i>You reluctantly put your fork down and turn your body to face Peter. His eyes are pleading with you and you can\u2019t help but soften a bit.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m truly sorry for how I\u2019ve been acting lately. I\u2019ll be better.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You sigh again, but this time in defeat. It was hard staying mad at your best friend. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be better, Pete. You just have to be you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You take his hand into your yours and squeeze it gently.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre we good?\u201d he asks, eyes staring into yours.</i></p><p><i>You nod and give him a small smile. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re good.\u201d</i></p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cAnd how was graduation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you would\u2019ve hated it!\u201d You lean back in your chair and continue, \u201cit was super depressing. I think that after half the class disappeared, going to school just\u2026 wasn\u2019t the same. It was just a reminder of all the things we had lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must\u2019ve been hard\u2026 seeing us disappear and then having to continue doing stuff.\u201d</p><p>You look at him thoughtfully. \u201cIt was\u2026 but it got better eventually. It hurt less and less everyday. I made new friends, I went to therapy\u2026 life kept going and I began to move on.\u201d</p><p>You see the pain in his eyes after the words come out of your mouth. Moving on? What did that even mean? It just meant that you weren\u2019t going to dwell on the \u2018what ifs\u2019 anymore. You spent the year after he disappeared ridden with guilt and heartbreak. You wished you had disappeared too. You lost your only friends and you subsequently lost a piece of yourself. Your parents watched you become a hollow shell of who you once were. It was a time in your life that you want to forget. But it made you the person you are today, and you\u2019re stronger because of it.</p><p>Peter blinks and the look in his eyes are gone. Instead he\u2019s smiling haphazardly, trying to regain some composure. \u201cWhat\u2019s college like?\u201d he asks, words laced with fake cheerfulness.</p><p>You force a smile.</p><p>\u201cCollege is great, Pete. You have so much freedom and you\u2019re learning things that you actually want to learn. Right now, I\u2019m focusing on Renaissance Literature and Jane Austen. It\u2019s amazing. You\u2019ll really love it.\u201d</p><p>He smiles genuinely and takes a sip of his water. He licks his lips and takes a deep breath. \u201cDo you\u2026 uh\u2026 do you have a boyfriend?\u201d he stutters, looking down at the table.</p><p>You tilt your head and look at him as he tries to avoid eye contact with you. You knew this question would come up eventually.</p><p>\u201cI did\u2026 we\u2026 we broke up six months ago.\u201d</p><p>He looks up at you. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just decided that things weren\u2019t working out,\u201d you say with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cHow long were you together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two years\u2026 we met during my senior year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he was a freshman in college when we started dating. We met at a college recruiting event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026 did you love him?\u201d</p><p>You nod your head slowly. \u201cYes\u2026 yes I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you loved me?\u201d He looks at you in anticipation.</p><p>You breathe in deeply. \u201cI could never.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>\u201cMy name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!\u201d Peter says along with the movie.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHas to be one of the best lines in cinema,\u201d you say, reaching into the bowl of popcorn in Peter\u2019s lap. </i></p><p><i>You both are sitting on Peter\u2019s bed watching The Princess Bride, one of your regulars.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSecond only to \u2018Luke, I am your father,\u2019\u201d Peter says, voice deep, mimicking Darth Vader.</i></p><p><i>You laugh and lean your head on Peter\u2019s shoulder. He instinctively leans into you. You are silent as you continue watching the movie. A few minutes pass before Peter starts fidgeting with his fingers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey Y/N?\u201d he interrupts.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for a long time\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSince elementary school.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know me better than anyone\u2026 even better than Ned.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI would hope so.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo you know I\u2019m not the best with talking about my feelings\u2026 especially after Uncle Ben died\u2026 but I\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>He pauses and you patiently wait for him to continue.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026,\u201d he stutters, \u201cI love you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay\u2026 I love you too,\u201d you say nonchalantly. Of course you loved your best friend.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo\u2026 I mean, while I do love you as a friend\u2026 I meant\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m in love with you\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>You lift your head from his shoulder and look at him square in the face. You see him gulp and he moves the bowl of popcorn to the floor.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d</i></p><p><i>A look of relief washes over Peter\u2019s face. It\u2019s like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m in love you, Y/N. I think I have been for a while. And I know, I know I\u2019m only 15 and I don\u2019t exactly know what it means to be in love, but there\u2019s no other way to describe the way I feel about you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d you ask, reaching out to stroke his arm gently.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt just did. I feel like everyday could be my last\u2026 I mean, I could get hit by a schoolbus or get struck by lightning, and\u2026 and I don\u2019t want to pass up the opportunity to tell my best friend that I\u2019m in love with her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You look down at his bedsheets. It\u2019s Star Wars themed with a pattern of lightsabers and planets. You remember when he got these sheets. You\u2019re too young to know what love is, but you also know that you\u2019re bound to Peter in ways that you can\u2019t even describe yourself. </i></p><p><i>You don\u2019t say anything. You just slowly reach out and wrap your arms around him. You bury your face in the crook of his neck, and he tentatively pulls you in closer. You don\u2019t move, you both just hold each other, taking the moment in. A boy has never told you he was in love you before. You can\u2019t help but feel content and elated. Maybe this is what love is. </i></p><p><i>You pull your face away from him and stare into his brown eyes.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it back\u2026\u201d he starts.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you too, Pete,\u201d you blurt, your face inches from his.</i></p><p><i>\u201cReally?\u201d He chokes out. You smile shyly and nod. Yes, you were in love with Peter Parker, the boy who\u2019s battled bullies for you, cried with you, and has always been there for you.</i></p><p><i>His eyes dart between your eyes and your lips. \u201cCan I\u2026 can I kiss you?\u201d He asks nervously.</i></p><p><i>You smile even wider. \u201cOkay,\u201d you respond. You just stare at his lips for a moment. This is your first kiss. \u2018Would you be bad at it?\u2019 you think to yourself. You hesitantly lean in and gently brush your lips against his. It\u2019s soft at first as he envelopes you deeper in his embrace. </i></p><p><i>You continue pressing your lips against his. He\u2019s so warm and lips are soft. You become bolder by opening your mouth. You tentatively begin massaging your tongues together as you run your hands through his hair.</i></p><p><i>He moans and you reluctantly break away. You press your foreheads together as you pant heavily.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow,\u201d he breathes.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDitto.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He smiles and nuzzles his nose against yours. You smile against his lips and stroke the back of his neck. Your lips are just barely touching and you\u2019re breathing each other\u2019s air. You\u2019ve never felt this close to someone before, and you never want this feeling to end.</i></p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cYour hair has gotten longer,\u201d he comments. You look up from your mug of tea.</p><p>He tentatively reaches his hand over the table to brush a piece of your hair away from your face. His hand lingers a bit and you reluctantly pull away. He retreats his hand quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mumbles, as he runs a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d you whisper, your heart twisting in your chest. You\u2019re aching for him to get close to you again. But you know it\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s so young, and you\u2019ve grown so much. You\u2019ve gotten so much older than him in these last five years. You graduated high school, you started college, you fell in love and you fell out of love, and you lost your virginity to someone who wasn\u2019t him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he nods sadly in understanding.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like to be back?\u201d</p><p>He bites his lip in thought. \u201cIt feels weird\u2026 but I\u2019m readjusting. I\u2019m back at school and just trying to keep moving forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\u2026 did Ned come back?\u201d </p><p>You remember your other friend, your only other friend. </p><p>\u201cHe did\u2026 he\u2019s doing well. A little shaken up, but he\u2019s coping. Trying to catch up on all the movies we\u2019ve missed,\u201d he laughs softly. \u201cWe\u2019re in the same classes too. Feels like how it used to be.\u201d</p><p>You look down sadly. You feel so left out. Apart of you wishes you could go back so you could trade notes with Peter in between periods, whine about Calculus together, and dissect what the mystery meat was in the cafeteria. But you quickly scold yourself. You went to high school already. You didn\u2019t disappear. They had five years stolen from them. They were stuck in time only to reappear and try to live a life that didn\u2019t wait for them. </p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>You\u2019re sitting on a school bus with your head leaning on Peter\u2019s shoulder as he quietly plays with his phone. You lean in closer and place a gentle kiss on his cheek.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWake me up when we get there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He looks at you and nods before kissing your forehead. \u201cLove you,\u201d he says softly, and you smile a bit before your heavy eyelids close. You don\u2019t say it back. You don\u2019t know why but you tell yourself that you\u2019ll tell him later.</i></p><p><i>You doze off for a few moments. In the background you think you hear Peter say, \u201cNed, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You then wake up abruptly to the sound of Ned screaming, \u201cHoly shit! We\u2019re all gonna die! There\u2019s a spaceship!\u201d</i></p><p><i>You look around and see the rest of your peers scramble to the windows in the back to see what the commotion is. You feel Peter slip away from you. You turn back around and notice he is gone. You frantically look for him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPeter?\u201d you shout, your voice drowned out by the shouts and hollers of the other students. \u201cPeter!\u201d</i></p><p><i>You notice his phone still laying on the seat beside you. You take it and clutch it close as you continue to look around the bus for him, but you know that he\u2019s already gone.</i></p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for dropping in on you like this, I just had to see you,\u201d he says as you two walk towards the front door. It\u2019s getting late and Peter needs to catch the train back to New York.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry at all\u2026 I\u2019m glad you came,\u201d you touch his arm gently.</p><p>He gives you a small smile.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s next for you now, Peter Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish high school,\u201d he chuckles. </p><p>Silence fills the air again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for disappearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to keep apologizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean I\u2019m sorry I disappeared\u2026 on the bus.\u201d</p><p>You nod gently and bite your lip in thought. \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo save the world,\u201d he says with a smile.</p><p>You squint your eyes at him in curiosity and then you laugh softly. \u201cAlright, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 can, can I visit you again?\u201d He stammers.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019d like that,\u201d you respond, even though you know he won\u2019t. He\u2019ll get caught up in homework, parties, applying for college, and\u2026 girls. And you secretly hope that he does. You want him to be happy, even if it\u2019s not with you.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2026 maybe one day\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows what the future holds,\u201d you interrupt, \u201cwhen you\u2019re 20, I\u2019ll be 25\u2026 doesn\u2019t sound that bad, right?\u201d</p><p>He nods and rubs the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cBut for now,\u201d you continue, \u201clive your life, Pete. Enjoy being 15 and if you still feel the same way when you\u2019re older, I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you don\u2019t feel the same way?\u201d</p><p>You sigh. \u201cI never stopped, Pete.\u201d</p><p>It sounds like a promise.</p><p>He takes a step toward you and cups your face in his hands. \u201cNo matter what happens, you\u2019ll always be my best girl.\u201d</p><p>You give him a small smile, as your eyes slightly water. You think about him falling in love with someone else. You think about him going to prom, graduating high school, and starting college. You think about all the firsts that he\u2019ll experience without you and all the things that he\u2019ll do that you won\u2019t do together. That time has past for you, and now it\u2019s time for him to live his life and grow up\u2026 without you.</p><p>\u201cGet home safe, okay?\u201d you say, breaking the moment. \u201cTell May I said hello.\u201d</p><p>He removes his hands from your face. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>You walk over to the front door and open it. He walks towards the doorway and lingers for a moment as he walks past you. You lean your head against the doorframe as you watch him walk away. He\u2019s halfway down the hall when you remember something. That feeling of regret that had weighed you down for five years. You yell, \u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>He turns around and gives you a curious look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026,\u201d you start, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for not saying it back\u2026 on the bus that day.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t know if you needed to say it for him or for yourself. He looks confused for a moment before realization hits him. He gives you a crooked smile. \u201cYou never had to say it\u2026 I always knew.\u201d</p><p>You nod and smile. He gives you a final wave before he continues down the hallway and you watch him until he disappears from sight.</p>",

You\u2019re about to be late to your Women in Lit class and you can\u2019t find your favorite sweater anywhere. It was hunter green with dark blue stripes. It reminded you of winter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, have you checked the hamper?\u201d she calls out from the living room. </p><p>You roll your eyes. Hello Captain Obvious. </p><p>\u201cI did!\u201d you shout from the bathroom. You put your long hair up in a messy bun and are about to brush your teeth when you hear a knock at the door. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d you hear Amy call out. You hear the door open and then low mumbling in the background as you brush your teeth. You\u2019re finishing up when you hear, \u201cY/N, can you come out here.\u201d</p><p>You furrow your eyebrows and rinse your toothbrush before putting it back in its holder. You take a look at yourself in the mirror and grimace. Whoever was at the door shouldn\u2019t be subjected to seeing you like this. You quickly pull the elastic from your hair and shake your hair out. You then walk out of the bathroom and head towards the front door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of in a hurry, Aims, what\u2019s up\u2026\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when you see him. You stop dead in your tracks. Your mouth drops slightly and your eyes widen. You had heard that people had come back. Family and friends being reunited. You had imagined him returning, but it was different seeing him in front of you after all this time. He hadn\u2019t aged a bit since you last saw him, and you couldn\u2019t help but feel your heart drop. It was the universe\u2019s sick joke. He still looked 15, and you had visibly aged now that you were 20.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Y/N,\u201d he greets.</p><p>It\u2019s dead silence and you can see Amy from the corner of your eye step away from the scene. \u201cHey Y/N, I\u2019m going to head to class so I\u2019ll see you later\u2026 nice to meet you, Peter,\u201d she mumbles.</p><p>Both you and Peter don\u2019t even flinch as Amy quickly gathers her belongings and exits from the small apartment.</p><p>A few moments pass after the door closes shut. It\u2019s just you two now. You don\u2019t know what to say. You\u2019ve thought about this moment for years, ever since he disappeared without a trace. You weren\u2019t there when it happened. You just heard from his Aunt that he was gone. Your heart was broken for years. Your best friend and your first love was gone. Years of planning your future together had slipped away the moment he disintegrated from the universe.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cYou grew up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disappeared.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightens and he quickly looks down at his feet. \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>You slowly take a step closer to him. You wish for nothing more than to touch him and hold him close. You want to bury your face in his chest and let him stroke your hair. Despite him being five years younger than you, he\u2019s still a head taller than you and you just want him to lean down and press his lips against yours. There is so much wanting in this moment yet you restrain yourself. He\u2019s practically still a child.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2026 when?\u201d You stammer.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>And yes, it all made sense. That\u2019s when they all came back. </p><p>\u201cI went to your apartment,\u201d he continues, \u201cyour mom almost had a heart attack when she saw me. She looks good by the way\u2026 she uh\u2026 told me that you were going to school in Connecticut so took a train here to see you. I\u2026 I wanted to see if you remembered me.\u201d</p><p>You look at him incredulously. \u201cOf course I remember you,\u201d you say, your voice just above a whisper.</p><p>He takes a couple steps closer to you until he\u2019s right in front of you. You look up and his eyes lock with yours. He hesitantly wraps his arms around you. You freeze in his embrace. No matter how many times you wished for this moment, you can\u2019t help but feel your chest tighten. He was real, and he was here.</p><p>\u201cThis feels nice,\u201d he says softly into your ear. You melt at his words and feel your body relax. You slowly wrap your arms around him and for a moment, everything seems okay.</p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>\u201cI failed,\u201d you groan, as your head rests on the outside of your locker. You feel a hand soothingly rub your shoulder. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHey, don\u2019t say that. I bet you did great.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You sigh and look up. Peter was ever the optimist.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say, you\u2019re a genius.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He chuckles, leaning against the locker next to yours. \u201cGenius is quite the compliment.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You lift your head from your locker. \u201cYou know it\u2019s true.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd I know that you probably aced the exam. C\u2019mon, you studied for weeks! Ten times more than me and Ned did.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He wraps an arm around your shoulder and gives you a squeeze.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBelieve in yourself, Y/N. Life may surprise you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You smile, as he drops his arm and lets you go. He always knew what to say to make you feel better.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWant to come over tonight for dinner? Mom\u2019s making spaghetti, your favoriteeee,\u201d you singsong.</i></p><p><i>His expression immediately changes as he furrows his brows. \u201cUmm\u2026 I\u2026 I can\u2019t tonight actually. I got this thing with the Stark Internship and I can\u2019t get out of it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Your face falls slightly. \u201cOh\u2026 okay.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNext time for sure though!\u201d</i></p><p><i>That\u2019s what he said last time.</i></p><p><i>You give him a forced smile and nod in understanding. He gives your shoulder a gentle squeeze. He looks down at his watch.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh shit, I gotta run\u2026 but I\u2019ll see you later, Y/N!\u201d he says as he scurries down the hallway, disappearing from sight.</i></p><p>\u2013</p><p>You\u2019re both sitting down at your small kitchen table. There\u2019s not much space between you two, as the table is no longer than a couple feet wide. A mug of hot tea sits in front of you. Your Women in Lit class is long forgotten. You never missed a class before anyways. Peter quickly glances between his glass of water and you. After your embrace, you awkwardly showed him around your apartment and then settled on planting yourselves in the kitchen. Another bought of silence fills the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat grade are you in now?\u201d he asks, breaking the dead air. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sophomore in college,\u201d you respond before taking a sip of your tea.</p><p>\u201cWhat do\u2026 what are you majoring in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnglish Literature\u2026 I\u2019m studying to be a teacher.\u201d</p><p>He gives you a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to becoming a doctor like your parents wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecided life was too short to not follow your heart.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cDid\u2026,\u201d he hesitates, \u201cDid any of your family\u2026 disappear?\u201d</p><p>You take another sip of your tea and shake your head. \u201cNo\u2026 we were one of the lucky ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was glad that Aunt May hadn\u2019t\u2026 went away. But I\u2019m sad she worried about me for all those years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything during that time that you were gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answers, rubbing the back of his neck nervously, \u201cI honestly just remember fading away and then just reappearing. It\u2019s like time didn\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>You stroke the side of your mug with your thumb, the heat emanating through the ceramic. It feels warm, comforting. You close your eyes for a moment and picture what he must\u2019ve felt. The feeling of turning into nothingness. You had seen people disappear with your own two eyes. The shock and pain you felt would haunt you for the rest of your life. You remember reaching out and trying to grasp at them and instead, they were dust in your fingertips. You shudder at the thought.</p><p>You reopen your eyes and see Peter looking at you intently. He reaches over and takes your hand into his. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened while I was gone?\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s a loaded question. \u2018Who are you now?\u2019 is the question you know he\u2019s trying to ask. Different snapshots of the last five years fill your mind. </p><p>\u201cWhere do I begin?\u201d </p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>You\u2019re lazily reading your World History textbook and eating your lunch when you notice a shadow cast over you. You look up and sigh heavily before grumbling, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Peter takes a seat next to you. You scoot over to put some distance between you and him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI came to apologize\u2026 I know I\u2019ve been acting weird lately.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWeird? You\u2019ve been nonexistent for the past month.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N. I know I\u2019ve been a total jerk. Things with the Stark Internship got crazy, but I\u2019ve straightened out my priorities.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, your priorities with Liz?\u201d You scowl, stabbing a piece of lettuce with your fork. The memory of Peter ditching you and your friends to go to Homecoming with the pretty senior only to disappear for the rest of the night flashes in your mind.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing between me and Liz.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to imagine,\u201d you mutter, taking another bite of your salad.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPlease look me at, Y/N.\u201d </i></p><p><i>You reluctantly put your fork down and turn your body to face Peter. His eyes are pleading with you and you can\u2019t help but soften a bit.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m truly sorry for how I\u2019ve been acting lately. I\u2019ll be better.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You sigh again, but this time in defeat. It was hard staying mad at your best friend. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be better, Pete. You just have to be you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You take his hand into your yours and squeeze it gently.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre we good?\u201d he asks, eyes staring into yours.</i></p><p><i>You nod and give him a small smile. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re good.\u201d</i></p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cAnd how was graduation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you would\u2019ve hated it!\u201d You lean back in your chair and continue, \u201cit was super depressing. I think that after half the class disappeared, going to school just\u2026 wasn\u2019t the same. It was just a reminder of all the things we had lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must\u2019ve been hard\u2026 seeing us disappear and then having to continue doing stuff.\u201d</p><p>You look at him thoughtfully. \u201cIt was\u2026 but it got better eventually. It hurt less and less everyday. I made new friends, I went to therapy\u2026 life kept going and I began to move on.\u201d</p><p>You see the pain in his eyes after the words come out of your mouth. Moving on? What did that even mean? It just meant that you weren\u2019t going to dwell on the \u2018what ifs\u2019 anymore. You spent the year after he disappeared ridden with guilt and heartbreak. You wished you had disappeared too. You lost your only friends and you subsequently lost a piece of yourself. Your parents watched you become a hollow shell of who you once were. It was a time in your life that you want to forget. But it made you the person you are today, and you\u2019re stronger because of it.</p><p>Peter blinks and the look in his eyes are gone. Instead he\u2019s smiling haphazardly, trying to regain some composure. \u201cWhat\u2019s college like?\u201d he asks, words laced with fake cheerfulness.</p><p>You force a smile.</p><p>\u201cCollege is great, Pete. You have so much freedom and you\u2019re learning things that you actually want to learn. Right now, I\u2019m focusing on Renaissance Literature and Jane Austen. It\u2019s amazing. You\u2019ll really love it.\u201d</p><p>He smiles genuinely and takes a sip of his water. He licks his lips and takes a deep breath. \u201cDo you\u2026 uh\u2026 do you have a boyfriend?\u201d he stutters, looking down at the table.</p><p>You tilt your head and look at him as he tries to avoid eye contact with you. You knew this question would come up eventually.</p><p>\u201cI did\u2026 we\u2026 we broke up six months ago.\u201d</p><p>He looks up at you. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just decided that things weren\u2019t working out,\u201d you say with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cHow long were you together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two years\u2026 we met during my senior year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he was a freshman in college when we started dating. We met at a college recruiting event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026 did you love him?\u201d</p><p>You nod your head slowly. \u201cYes\u2026 yes I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you loved me?\u201d He looks at you in anticipation.</p><p>You breathe in deeply. \u201cI could never.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>\u201cMy name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!\u201d Peter says along with the movie.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHas to be one of the best lines in cinema,\u201d you say, reaching into the bowl of popcorn in Peter\u2019s lap. </i></p><p><i>You both are sitting on Peter\u2019s bed watching The Princess Bride, one of your regulars.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSecond only to \u2018Luke, I am your father,\u2019\u201d Peter says, voice deep, mimicking Darth Vader.</i></p><p><i>You laugh and lean your head on Peter\u2019s shoulder. He instinctively leans into you. You are silent as you continue watching the movie. A few minutes pass before Peter starts fidgeting with his fingers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey Y/N?\u201d he interrupts.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for a long time\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSince elementary school.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know me better than anyone\u2026 even better than Ned.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI would hope so.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo you know I\u2019m not the best with talking about my feelings\u2026 especially after Uncle Ben died\u2026 but I\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>He pauses and you patiently wait for him to continue.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026,\u201d he stutters, \u201cI love you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay\u2026 I love you too,\u201d you say nonchalantly. Of course you loved your best friend.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo\u2026 I mean, while I do love you as a friend\u2026 I meant\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m in love with you\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>You lift your head from his shoulder and look at him square in the face. You see him gulp and he moves the bowl of popcorn to the floor.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d</i></p><p><i>A look of relief washes over Peter\u2019s face. It\u2019s like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m in love you, Y/N. I think I have been for a while. And I know, I know I\u2019m only 15 and I don\u2019t exactly know what it means to be in love, but there\u2019s no other way to describe the way I feel about you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d you ask, reaching out to stroke his arm gently.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt just did. I feel like everyday could be my last\u2026 I mean, I could get hit by a schoolbus or get struck by lightning, and\u2026 and I don\u2019t want to pass up the opportunity to tell my best friend that I\u2019m in love with her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You look down at his bedsheets. It\u2019s Star Wars themed with a pattern of lightsabers and planets. You remember when he got these sheets. You\u2019re too young to know what love is, but you also know that you\u2019re bound to Peter in ways that you can\u2019t even describe yourself. </i></p><p><i>You don\u2019t say anything. You just slowly reach out and wrap your arms around him. You bury your face in the crook of his neck, and he tentatively pulls you in closer. You don\u2019t move, you both just hold each other, taking the moment in. A boy has never told you he was in love you before. You can\u2019t help but feel content and elated. Maybe this is what love is. </i></p><p><i>You pull your face away from him and stare into his brown eyes.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it back\u2026\u201d he starts.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you too, Pete,\u201d you blurt, your face inches from his.</i></p><p><i>\u201cReally?\u201d He chokes out. You smile shyly and nod. Yes, you were in love with Peter Parker, the boy who\u2019s battled bullies for you, cried with you, and has always been there for you.</i></p><p><i>His eyes dart between your eyes and your lips. \u201cCan I\u2026 can I kiss you?\u201d He asks nervously.</i></p><p><i>You smile even wider. \u201cOkay,\u201d you respond. You just stare at his lips for a moment. This is your first kiss. \u2018Would you be bad at it?\u2019 you think to yourself. You hesitantly lean in and gently brush your lips against his. It\u2019s soft at first as he envelopes you deeper in his embrace. </i></p><p><i>You continue pressing your lips against his. He\u2019s so warm and lips are soft. You become bolder by opening your mouth. You tentatively begin massaging your tongues together as you run your hands through his hair.</i></p><p><i>He moans and you reluctantly break away. You press your foreheads together as you pant heavily.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow,\u201d he breathes.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDitto.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He smiles and nuzzles his nose against yours. You smile against his lips and stroke the back of his neck. Your lips are just barely touching and you\u2019re breathing each other\u2019s air. You\u2019ve never felt this close to someone before, and you never want this feeling to end.</i></p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cYour hair has gotten longer,\u201d he comments. You look up from your mug of tea.</p><p>He tentatively reaches his hand over the table to brush a piece of your hair away from your face. His hand lingers a bit and you reluctantly pull away. He retreats his hand quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mumbles, as he runs a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d you whisper, your heart twisting in your chest. You\u2019re aching for him to get close to you again. But you know it\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s so young, and you\u2019ve grown so much. You\u2019ve gotten so much older than him in these last five years. You graduated high school, you started college, you fell in love and you fell out of love, and you lost your virginity to someone who wasn\u2019t him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he nods sadly in understanding.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like to be back?\u201d</p><p>He bites his lip in thought. \u201cIt feels weird\u2026 but I\u2019m readjusting. I\u2019m back at school and just trying to keep moving forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\u2026 did Ned come back?\u201d </p><p>You remember your other friend, your only other friend. </p><p>\u201cHe did\u2026 he\u2019s doing well. A little shaken up, but he\u2019s coping. Trying to catch up on all the movies we\u2019ve missed,\u201d he laughs softly. \u201cWe\u2019re in the same classes too. Feels like how it used to be.\u201d</p><p>You look down sadly. You feel so left out. Apart of you wishes you could go back so you could trade notes with Peter in between periods, whine about Calculus together, and dissect what the mystery meat was in the cafeteria. But you quickly scold yourself. You went to high school already. You didn\u2019t disappear. They had five years stolen from them. They were stuck in time only to reappear and try to live a life that didn\u2019t wait for them. </p><p>\u2013</p><p><i>You\u2019re sitting on a school bus with your head leaning on Peter\u2019s shoulder as he quietly plays with his phone. You lean in closer and place a gentle kiss on his cheek.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWake me up when we get there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He looks at you and nods before kissing your forehead. \u201cLove you,\u201d he says softly, and you smile a bit before your heavy eyelids close. You don\u2019t say it back. You don\u2019t know why but you tell yourself that you\u2019ll tell him later.</i></p><p><i>You doze off for a few moments. In the background you think you hear Peter say, \u201cNed, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You then wake up abruptly to the sound of Ned screaming, \u201cHoly shit! We\u2019re all gonna die! There\u2019s a spaceship!\u201d</i></p><p><i>You look around and see the rest of your peers scramble to the windows in the back to see what the commotion is. You feel Peter slip away from you. You turn back around and notice he is gone. You frantically look for him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPeter?\u201d you shout, your voice drowned out by the shouts and hollers of the other students. \u201cPeter!\u201d</i></p><p><i>You notice his phone still laying on the seat beside you. You take it and clutch it close as you continue to look around the bus for him, but you know that he\u2019s already gone.</i></p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for dropping in on you like this, I just had to see you,\u201d he says as you two walk towards the front door. It\u2019s getting late and Peter needs to catch the train back to New York.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry at all\u2026 I\u2019m glad you came,\u201d you touch his arm gently.</p><p>He gives you a small smile.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s next for you now, Peter Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish high school,\u201d he chuckles. </p><p>Silence fills the air again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for disappearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to keep apologizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean I\u2019m sorry I disappeared\u2026 on the bus.\u201d</p><p>You nod gently and bite your lip in thought. \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo save the world,\u201d he says with a smile.</p><p>You squint your eyes at him in curiosity and then you laugh softly. \u201cAlright, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 can, can I visit you again?\u201d He stammers.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019d like that,\u201d you respond, even though you know he won\u2019t. He\u2019ll get caught up in homework, parties, applying for college, and\u2026 girls. And you secretly hope that he does. You want him to be happy, even if it\u2019s not with you.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2026 maybe one day\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows what the future holds,\u201d you interrupt, \u201cwhen you\u2019re 20, I\u2019ll be 25\u2026 doesn\u2019t sound that bad, right?\u201d</p><p>He nods and rubs the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cBut for now,\u201d you continue, \u201clive your life, Pete. Enjoy being 15 and if you still feel the same way when you\u2019re older, I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you don\u2019t feel the same way?\u201d</p><p>You sigh. \u201cI never stopped, Pete.\u201d</p><p>It sounds like a promise.</p><p>He takes a step toward you and cups your face in his hands. \u201cNo matter what happens, you\u2019ll always be my best girl.\u201d</p><p>You give him a small smile, as your eyes slightly water. You think about him falling in love with someone else. You think about him going to prom, graduating high school, and starting college. You think about all the firsts that he\u2019ll experience without you and all the things that he\u2019ll do that you won\u2019t do together. That time has past for you, and now it\u2019s time for him to live his life and grow up\u2026 without you.</p><p>\u201cGet home safe, okay?\u201d you say, breaking the moment. \u201cTell May I said hello.\u201d</p><p>He removes his hands from your face. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>You walk over to the front door and open it. He walks towards the doorway and lingers for a moment as he walks past you. You lean your head against the doorframe as you watch him walk away. He\u2019s halfway down the hall when you remember something. That feeling of regret that had weighed you down for five years. You yell, \u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>He turns around and gives you a curious look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026,\u201d you start, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for not saying it back\u2026 on the bus that day.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t know if you needed to say it for him or for yourself. He looks confused for a moment before realization hits him. He gives you a crooked smile. \u201cYou never had to say it\u2026 I always knew.\u201d</p><p>You nod and smile. He gives you a final wave before he continues down the hallway and you watch him until he disappears from sight.</p>",

Even though he was your best friend, you still couldn&rsquo;t stop the butterflies from fluttering in your stomach.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What if we move far away from each other for college?&rdquo; you inquire.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll visit you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What if you meet a girl?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my best girl.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What if you&rsquo;re busy?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be too busy for you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You say that now, but you&rsquo;re already busy with your Stark Internship.&rdquo; You bite your lip.</i></p><p><i>You feel his hand tighten around yours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t mean to be,&rdquo; he says lowly.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be sorry, I know you&rsquo;re doing great things. Just don&rsquo;t forget about me, yeah?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He gives you a wide grin. &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ndash;</p><p><b>Five Years Later</b></p><p>&ldquo;Hey Amy, have you seen my green sweater?&rdquo; you ask your roommate as you pass through the kitchen in a hurry. You&rsquo;re about to be late to your Women in Lit class and you can&rsquo;t find your favorite sweater anywhere. It was hunter green with dark blue stripes. It reminded you of winter.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, have you checked the hamper?&rdquo; she calls out from the living room. </p><p>You roll your eyes. Hello Captain Obvious. </p><p>&ldquo;I did!&rdquo; you shout from the bathroom. You put your long hair up in a messy bun and are about to brush your teeth when you hear a knock at the door. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it,&rdquo; you hear Amy call out. You hear the door open and then low mumbling in the background as you brush your teeth. You&rsquo;re finishing up when you hear, &ldquo;Y/N, can you come out here.&rdquo;</p><p>You furrow your eyebrows and rinse your toothbrush before putting it back in its holder. You take a look at yourself in the mirror and grimace. Whoever was at the door shouldn&rsquo;t be subjected to seeing you like this. You quickly pull the elastic from your hair and shake your hair out. You then walk out of the bathroom and head towards the front door.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind of in a hurry, Aims, what&rsquo;s up&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s when you see him. You stop dead in your tracks. Your mouth drops slightly and your eyes widen. You had heard that people had come back. Family and friends being reunited. You had imagined him returning, but it was different seeing him in front of you after all this time. He hadn&rsquo;t aged a bit since you last saw him, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but feel your heart drop. It was the universe&rsquo;s sick joke. He still looked 15, and you had visibly aged now that you were 20.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Y/N,&rdquo; he greets.</p><p>It&rsquo;s dead silence and you can see Amy from the corner of your eye step away from the scene. &ldquo;Hey Y/N, I&rsquo;m going to head to class so I&rsquo;ll see you later&hellip; nice to meet you, Peter,&rdquo; she mumbles.</p><p>Both you and Peter don&rsquo;t even flinch as Amy quickly gathers her belongings and exits from the small apartment.</p><p>A few moments pass after the door closes shut. It&rsquo;s just you two now. You don&rsquo;t know what to say. You&rsquo;ve thought about this moment for years, ever since he disappeared without a trace. You weren&rsquo;t there when it happened. You just heard from his Aunt that he was gone. Your heart was broken for years. Your best friend and your first love was gone. Years of planning your future together had slipped away the moment he disintegrated from the universe.</p><p>He clears his throat. &ldquo;You grew up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You disappeared.&rdquo;</p><p>His mouth tightens and he quickly looks down at his feet. &ldquo;Yeah, I did.&rdquo;</p><p>You slowly take a step closer to him. You wish for nothing more than to touch him and hold him close. You want to bury your face in his chest and let him stroke your hair. Despite him being five years younger than you, he&rsquo;s still a head taller than you and you just want him to lean down and press his lips against yours. There is so much wanting in this moment yet you restrain yourself. He&rsquo;s practically still a child.</p><p>&ldquo;How&hellip; when?&rdquo; You stammer.</p><p>&ldquo;Two weeks ago.&rdquo;</p><p>And yes, it all made sense. That&rsquo;s when they all came back. </p><p>&ldquo;I went to your apartment,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;your mom almost had a heart attack when she saw me. She looks good by the way&hellip; she uh&hellip; told me that you were going to school in Connecticut so took a train here to see you. I&hellip; I wanted to see if you remembered me.&rdquo;</p><p>You look at him incredulously. &ldquo;Of course I remember you,&rdquo; you say, your voice just above a whisper.</p><p>He takes a couple steps closer to you until he&rsquo;s right in front of you. You look up and his eyes lock with yours. He hesitantly wraps his arms around you. You freeze in his embrace. No matter how many times you wished for this moment, you can&rsquo;t help but feel your chest tighten. He was real, and he was here.</p><p>&ldquo;This feels nice,&rdquo; he says softly into your ear. You melt at his words and feel your body relax. You slowly wrap your arms around him and for a moment, everything seems okay.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I failed,&rdquo; you groan, as your head rests on the outside of your locker. You feel a hand soothingly rub your shoulder. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t say that. I bet you did great.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You sigh and look up. Peter was ever the optimist.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy for you to say, you&rsquo;re a genius.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He chuckles, leaning against the locker next to yours. &ldquo;Genius is quite the compliment.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You lift your head from your locker. &ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And I know that you probably aced the exam. C&rsquo;mon, you studied for weeks! Ten times more than me and Ned did.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He wraps an arm around your shoulder and gives you a squeeze.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Believe in yourself, Y/N. Life may surprise you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You smile, as he drops his arm and lets you go. He always knew what to say to make you feel better.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Want to come over tonight for dinner? Mom&rsquo;s making spaghetti, your favoriteeee,&rdquo; you singsong.</i></p><p><i>His expression immediately changes as he furrows his brows. &ldquo;Umm&hellip; I&hellip; I can&rsquo;t tonight actually. I got this thing with the Stark Internship and I can&rsquo;t get out of it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Your face falls slightly. &ldquo;Oh&hellip; okay.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Next time for sure though!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>That&rsquo;s what he said last time.</i></p><p><i>You give him a forced smile and nod in understanding. He gives your shoulder a gentle squeeze. He looks down at his watch.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh shit, I gotta run&hellip; but I&rsquo;ll see you later, Y/N!&rdquo; he says as he scurries down the hallway, disappearing from sight.</i></p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You&rsquo;re both sitting down at your small kitchen table. There&rsquo;s not much space between you two, as the table is no longer than a couple feet wide. A mug of hot tea sits in front of you. Your Women in Lit class is long forgotten. You never missed a class before anyways. Peter quickly glances between his glass of water and you. After your embrace, you awkwardly showed him around your apartment and then settled on planting yourselves in the kitchen. Another bought of silence fills the room.</p><p>&ldquo;What grade are you in now?&rdquo; he asks, breaking the dead air. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sophomore in college,&rdquo; you respond before taking a sip of your tea.</p><p>&ldquo;What do&hellip; what are you majoring in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;English Literature&hellip; I&rsquo;m studying to be a teacher.&rdquo;</p><p>He gives you a knowing smile.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened to becoming a doctor like your parents wanted?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Decided life was too short to not follow your heart.&rdquo;</p><p>He nods. &ldquo;Did&hellip;,&rdquo; he hesitates, &ldquo;Did any of your family&hellip; disappear?&rdquo;</p><p>You take another sip of your tea and shake your head. &ldquo;No&hellip; we were one of the lucky ones.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I was glad that Aunt May hadn&rsquo;t&hellip; went away. But I&rsquo;m sad she worried about me for all those years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember anything during that time that you were gone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answers, rubbing the back of his neck nervously, &ldquo;I honestly just remember fading away and then just reappearing. It&rsquo;s like time didn&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;</p><p>You stroke the side of your mug with your thumb, the heat emanating through the ceramic. It feels warm, comforting. You close your eyes for a moment and picture what he must&rsquo;ve felt. The feeling of turning into nothingness. You had seen people disappear with your own two eyes. The shock and pain you felt would haunt you for the rest of your life. You remember reaching out and trying to grasp at them and instead, they were dust in your fingertips. You shudder at the thought.</p><p>You reopen your eyes and see Peter looking at you intently. He reaches over and takes your hand into his. </p><p>&ldquo;What happened while I was gone?&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s a loaded question. &lsquo;Who are you now?&rsquo; is the question you know he&rsquo;s trying to ask. Different snapshots of the last five years fill your mind. </p><p>&ldquo;Where do I begin?&rdquo; </p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>You&rsquo;re lazily reading your World History textbook and eating your lunch when you notice a shadow cast over you. You look up and sigh heavily before grumbling, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Peter takes a seat next to you. You scoot over to put some distance between you and him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I came to apologize&hellip; I know I&rsquo;ve been acting weird lately.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Weird? You&rsquo;ve been nonexistent for the past month.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Y/N. I know I&rsquo;ve been a total jerk. Things with the Stark Internship got crazy, but I&rsquo;ve straightened out my priorities.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah, your priorities with Liz?&rdquo; You scowl, stabbing a piece of lettuce with your fork. The memory of Peter ditching you and your friends to go to Homecoming with the pretty senior only to disappear for the rest of the night flashes in your mind.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing between me and Liz.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to imagine,&rdquo; you mutter, taking another bite of your salad.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Please look me at, Y/N.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>You reluctantly put your fork down and turn your body to face Peter. His eyes are pleading with you and you can&rsquo;t help but soften a bit.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly sorry for how I&rsquo;ve been acting lately. I&rsquo;ll be better.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You sigh again, but this time in defeat. It was hard staying mad at your best friend. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be better, Pete. You just have to be you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You take his hand into your yours and squeeze it gently.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are we good?&rdquo; he asks, eyes staring into yours.</i></p><p><i>You nod and give him a small smile. &ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;And how was graduation?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh you would&rsquo;ve hated it!&rdquo; You lean back in your chair and continue, &ldquo;it was super depressing. I think that after half the class disappeared, going to school just&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t the same. It was just a reminder of all the things we had lost.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That must&rsquo;ve been hard&hellip; seeing us disappear and then having to continue doing stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>You look at him thoughtfully. &ldquo;It was&hellip; but it got better eventually. It hurt less and less everyday. I made new friends, I went to therapy&hellip; life kept going and I began to move on.&rdquo;</p><p>You see the pain in his eyes after the words come out of your mouth. Moving on? What did that even mean? It just meant that you weren&rsquo;t going to dwell on the &lsquo;what ifs&rsquo; anymore. You spent the year after he disappeared ridden with guilt and heartbreak. You wished you had disappeared too. You lost your only friends and you subsequently lost a piece of yourself. Your parents watched you become a hollow shell of who you once were. It was a time in your life that you want to forget. But it made you the person you are today, and you&rsquo;re stronger because of it.</p><p>Peter blinks and the look in his eyes are gone. Instead he&rsquo;s smiling haphazardly, trying to regain some composure. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s college like?&rdquo; he asks, words laced with fake cheerfulness.</p><p>You force a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;College is great, Pete. You have so much freedom and you&rsquo;re learning things that you actually want to learn. Right now, I&rsquo;m focusing on Renaissance Literature and Jane Austen. It&rsquo;s amazing. You&rsquo;ll really love it.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiles genuinely and takes a sip of his water. He licks his lips and takes a deep breath. &ldquo;Do you&hellip; uh&hellip; do you have a boyfriend?&rdquo; he stutters, looking down at the table.</p><p>You tilt your head and look at him as he tries to avoid eye contact with you. You knew this question would come up eventually.</p><p>&ldquo;I did&hellip; we&hellip; we broke up six months ago.&rdquo;</p><p>He looks up at you. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He just decided that things weren&rsquo;t working out,&rdquo; you say with a shrug.</p><p>&ldquo;How long were you together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About two years&hellip; we met during my senior year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did I know him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, he was a freshman in college when we started dating. We met at a college recruiting event.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you&hellip; did you love him?&rdquo;</p><p>You nod your head slowly. &ldquo;Yes&hellip; yes I did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More than you loved me?&rdquo; He looks at you in anticipation.</p><p>You breathe in deeply. &ldquo;I could never.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!&rdquo; Peter says along with the movie.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Has to be one of the best lines in cinema,&rdquo; you say, reaching into the bowl of popcorn in Peter&rsquo;s lap. </i></p><p><i>You both are sitting on Peter&rsquo;s bed watching The Princess Bride, one of your regulars.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Second only to &lsquo;Luke, I am your father,&rsquo;&rdquo; Peter says, voice deep, mimicking Darth Vader.</i></p><p><i>You laugh and lean your head on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder. He instinctively leans into you. You are silent as you continue watching the movie. A few minutes pass before Peter starts fidgeting with his fingers.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey Y/N?&rdquo; he interrupts.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been friends for a long time&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Since elementary school.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You know me better than anyone&hellip; even better than Ned.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I would hope so.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So you know I&rsquo;m not the best with talking about my feelings&hellip; especially after Uncle Ben died&hellip; but I&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He pauses and you patiently wait for him to continue.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&hellip;,&rdquo; he stutters, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay&hellip; I love you too,&rdquo; you say nonchalantly. Of course you loved your best friend.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No&hellip; I mean, while I do love you as a friend&hellip; I meant&hellip; I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m in love with you&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You lift your head from his shoulder and look at him square in the face. You see him gulp and he moves the bowl of popcorn to the floor.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>A look of relief washes over Peter&rsquo;s face. It&rsquo;s like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love you, Y/N. I think I have been for a while. And I know, I know I&rsquo;m only 15 and I don&rsquo;t exactly know what it means to be in love, but there&rsquo;s no other way to describe the way I feel about you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;When did this happen?&rdquo; you ask, reaching out to stroke his arm gently.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It just did. I feel like everyday could be my last&hellip; I mean, I could get hit by a schoolbus or get struck by lightning, and&hellip; and I don&rsquo;t want to pass up the opportunity to tell my best friend that I&rsquo;m in love with her.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You look down at his bedsheets. It&rsquo;s Star Wars themed with a pattern of lightsabers and planets. You remember when he got these sheets. You&rsquo;re too young to know what love is, but you also know that you&rsquo;re bound to Peter in ways that you can&rsquo;t even describe yourself. </i></p><p><i>You don&rsquo;t say anything. You just slowly reach out and wrap your arms around him. You bury your face in the crook of his neck, and he tentatively pulls you in closer. You don&rsquo;t move, you both just hold each other, taking the moment in. A boy has never told you he was in love you before. You can&rsquo;t help but feel content and elated. Maybe this is what love is. </i></p><p><i>You pull your face away from him and stare into his brown eyes.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say it back&hellip;&rdquo; he starts.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I love you too, Pete,&rdquo; you blurt, your face inches from his.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; He chokes out. You smile shyly and nod. Yes, you were in love with Peter Parker, the boy who&rsquo;s battled bullies for you, cried with you, and has always been there for you.</i></p><p><i>His eyes dart between your eyes and your lips. &ldquo;Can I&hellip; can I kiss you?&rdquo; He asks nervously.</i></p><p><i>You smile even wider. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you respond. You just stare at his lips for a moment. This is your first kiss. &lsquo;Would you be bad at it?&rsquo; you think to yourself. You hesitantly lean in and gently brush your lips against his. It&rsquo;s soft at first as he envelopes you deeper in his embrace. </i></p><p><i>You continue pressing your lips against his. He&rsquo;s so warm and lips are soft. You become bolder by opening your mouth. You tentatively begin massaging your tongues together as you run your hands through his hair.</i></p><p><i>He moans and you reluctantly break away. You press your foreheads together as you pant heavily.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he breathes.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ditto.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He smiles and nuzzles his nose against yours. You smile against his lips and stroke the back of his neck. Your lips are just barely touching and you&rsquo;re breathing each other&rsquo;s air. You&rsquo;ve never felt this close to someone before, and you never want this feeling to end.</i></p><p>&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Your hair has gotten longer,&rdquo; he comments. You look up from your mug of tea.</p><p>He tentatively reaches his hand over the table to brush a piece of your hair away from your face. His hand lingers a bit and you reluctantly pull away. He retreats his hand quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he mumbles, as he runs a hand through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; you whisper, your heart twisting in your chest. You&rsquo;re aching for him to get close to you again. But you know it&rsquo;s wrong. He&rsquo;s so young, and you&rsquo;ve grown so much. You&rsquo;ve gotten so much older than him in these last five years. You graduated high school, you started college, you fell in love and you fell out of love, and you lost your virginity to someone who wasn&rsquo;t him.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he nods sadly in understanding.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it like to be back?&rdquo;</p><p>He bites his lip in thought. &ldquo;It feels weird&hellip; but I&rsquo;m readjusting. I&rsquo;m back at school and just trying to keep moving forward.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did&hellip; did Ned come back?&rdquo; </p><p>You remember your other friend, your only other friend. </p><p>&ldquo;He did&hellip; he&rsquo;s doing well. A little shaken up, but he&rsquo;s coping. Trying to catch up on all the movies we&rsquo;ve missed,&rdquo; he laughs softly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the same classes too. Feels like how it used to be.&rdquo;</p><p>You look down sadly. You feel so left out. Apart of you wishes you could go back so you could trade notes with Peter in between periods, whine about Calculus together, and dissect what the mystery meat was in the cafeteria. But you quickly scold yourself. You went to high school already. You didn&rsquo;t disappear. They had five years stolen from them. They were stuck in time only to reappear and try to live a life that didn&rsquo;t wait for them. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p><i>You&rsquo;re sitting on a school bus with your head leaning on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder as he quietly plays with his phone. You lean in closer and place a gentle kiss on his cheek.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wake me up when we get there.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He looks at you and nods before kissing your forehead. &ldquo;Love you,&rdquo; he says softly, and you smile a bit before your heavy eyelids close. You don&rsquo;t say it back. You don&rsquo;t know why but you tell yourself that you&rsquo;ll tell him later.</i></p><p><i>You doze off for a few moments. In the background you think you hear Peter say, &ldquo;Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You then wake up abruptly to the sound of Ned screaming, &ldquo;Holy shit! We&rsquo;re all gonna die! There&rsquo;s a spaceship!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You look around and see the rest of your peers scramble to the windows in the back to see what the commotion is. You feel Peter slip away from you. You turn back around and notice he is gone. You frantically look for him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; you shout, your voice drowned out by the shouts and hollers of the other students. &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You notice his phone still laying on the seat beside you. You take it and clutch it close as you continue to look around the bus for him, but you know that he&rsquo;s already gone.</i></p><p>&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for dropping in on you like this, I just had to see you,&rdquo; he says as you two walk towards the front door. It&rsquo;s getting late and Peter needs to catch the train back to New York.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry at all&hellip; I&rsquo;m glad you came,&rdquo; you touch his arm gently.</p><p>He gives you a small smile.</p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s next for you now, Peter Parker?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Finish high school,&rdquo; he chuckles. </p><p>Silence fills the air again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for disappearing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to keep apologizing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I mean I&rsquo;m sorry I disappeared&hellip; on the bus.&rdquo;</p><p>You nod gently and bite your lip in thought. &ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To save the world,&rdquo; he says with a smile.</p><p>You squint your eyes at him in curiosity and then you laugh softly. &ldquo;Alright, Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; can, can I visit you again?&rdquo; He stammers.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&hellip; I&rsquo;d like that,&rdquo; you respond, even though you know he won&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;ll get caught up in homework, parties, applying for college, and&hellip; girls. And you secretly hope that he does. You want him to be happy, even if it&rsquo;s not with you.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think that&hellip; maybe one day&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who knows what the future holds,&rdquo; you interrupt, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re 20, I&rsquo;ll be 25&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t sound that bad, right?&rdquo;</p><p>He nods and rubs the back of his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;But for now,&rdquo; you continue, &ldquo;live your life, Pete. Enjoy being 15 and if you still feel the same way when you&rsquo;re older, I&rsquo;ll be here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if you don&rsquo;t feel the same way?&rdquo;</p><p>You sigh. &ldquo;I never stopped, Pete.&rdquo;</p><p>It sounds like a promise.</p><p>He takes a step toward you and cups your face in his hands. &ldquo;No matter what happens, you&rsquo;ll always be my best girl.&rdquo;</p><p>You give him a small smile, as your eyes slightly water. You think about him falling in love with someone else. You think about him going to prom, graduating high school, and starting college. You think about all the firsts that he&rsquo;ll experience without you and all the things that he&rsquo;ll do that you won&rsquo;t do together. That time has past for you, and now it&rsquo;s time for him to live his life and grow up&hellip; without you.</p><p>&ldquo;Get home safe, okay?&rdquo; you say, breaking the moment. &ldquo;Tell May I said hello.&rdquo;</p><p>He removes his hands from your face. &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p><p>You walk over to the front door and open it. He walks towards the doorway and lingers for a moment as he walks past you. You lean your head against the doorframe as you watch him walk away. He&rsquo;s halfway down the hall when you remember something. That feeling of regret that had weighed you down for five years. You yell, &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;</p><p>He turns around and gives you a curious look.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;,&rdquo; you start, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for not saying it back&hellip; on the bus that day.&rdquo;</p><p>You don&rsquo;t know if you needed to say it for him or for yourself. He looks confused for a moment before realization hits him. He gives you a crooked smile. &ldquo;You never had to say it&hellip; I always knew.&rdquo;</p><p>You nod and smile. He gives you a final wave before he continues down the hallway and you watch him until he disappears from sight.</p>",

But when new evidence comes to light proving foul play, no one in the NYPD will give Peter the time of day.</p><p>No one that is, except genius consulting detective on probation, Tony Stark. But Tony has his own demons to fight. Struggling to maintain his sobriety after a tragedy in London forced him overseas, Tony learns that what mends hearts might not be at the bottom of a bottle but something like a string of unsolved murders and perhaps even love. <br/></p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19031392/chapters/45200047#main\" target=\"_blank\">AO3 Link</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>Fury stares him down, his one eye tunneling through his words to grasp at his intentions. Tony sits very still. Back straight. Attentive. Not shirking away from the intensity that threatens to reveal him whole. </p><p>Fury stares some more, then cracks a grin and leans back into his chair. \u201cTony Stark.\u201d he drawls, \u201cNever thought I\u2019d see you again.\u201d </p><p>Tony quirks his brows. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d come to this side of the world either.\u201d </p><p>The blare of honking drivers and the faint thrum of the subway reverberate in the New York City air. Tony breathes through it, his hyper-sensitivity forces the scratching of Officer Blair\u2019s Lotto card from the next room into his ear-drums, he hears the sound of two copiers churning out the contents of police files, a woman laughing into the phone. The NYPD\u2019s seventh precinct has never once been quiet, but the cacophony of it all suits Captain Nick Fury just fine. </p><p>Tony thinks he could get used to it. </p><p>Fury\u2019s tone says relax, but Tony\u2019s in the lion\u2019s den and he isn\u2019t one to forget it. \u201cYou staying here for the next while?\u201d Fury asks, hands clasped over the desk. </p><p>\u201cPermanently.\u201d Tony says immediately. </p><p>Unconsciously, his fingers grip into the handles of his chair. Fury\u2019s eyes dart to his tense knuckles but they\u2019re back on his face just as quickly. \u201cOkay. Anything I need to know about?\u201d he stares at him meaningfully but Tony doesn\u2019t take the bait. </p><p>His jaw tightens. \u201cNothing you haven\u2019t already snooped out.\u201d Tony\u2019s foot starts shaking, something antsy crawling all over him. \u201cAre we done yet? With all this have my daughter home my eight stuff or can we get to what\u2019s actually important?\u201d </p><p>Fury almost looks amused. \u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d </p><p>Tony stands up, plants both hands on his desk. \u201cThe case.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>\u201cPeter! Have you seen my keys? They\u2019re not on the thing!\u201d </p><p>Twisting his lip, Peter pauses mid-bite. \u201cI think\u2026maybe\u2026wait didn\u2019t you put them in your jacket yesterday?\u201d</p><p>May smacks a hand to her forehead groaning. Peter snickers into his cereal, \u201cPeter make sure you always put your stuff back in the same place.\u201d he mimics, laughing at her half-hearted glare.</p><p>Hands on her hips, May tries to look stern but she can\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cWay to kick a girl when she\u2019s down Pete.\u201d </p><p>Peter flashes a cheeky grin before May runs back into her bedroom, pulling out her spring jacket and digging into the pockets with a quick, \u201cAha!\u201d before rushing back to him.</p><p>All at once, the light-heartedness in her eyes fades and something haunted clouds the brown of her eyes. May looks at him for a moment, imperceptibly biting her lip before taking three steps towards him and pulling him in for a tight hug. \u201cMay?\u201d his fingers grip the back of her shirt.</p><p>He feels her take a deep breath from where she\u2019s pressed against his shoulder before she pulls away slowly. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d he asks again, gentler this time.</p><p>Her smile is small, but she brushes the hair from his eyes like she\u2019s done a thousand times before and Peter has the strangest feeling that he should be trying to memorize this moment. \u201cNothing sweetie. I just really love you, you know that?\u201d </p><p>Peter smiles, a little wary, a little touched, \u201cYeah. I love you too May.\u201d </p><p>She smiles at him again and he watches her leave to work with questions in his eyes. \u201cAre you coming back at seven today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier probably.\u201d There\u2019s something weird in how she says it, but Peter can\u2019t put his finger on it. </p><p>\u201cOk great! I\u2019ll make some pasta or something and we can eat together.\u201d</p><p>May shoots him a grateful smile before waving her goodbyes. The door clicks shut behind her and Peter finds himself faltering in the silence. May was usually an open book, but today- not just today- the past while\u2026she\u2019d been keeping something back. Not hiding, just\u2026keeping. He\u2019d ask her about it tonight. Whatever it was, maybe he could help her. Or at least try. </p><p>Resolved, Peter quickly washes his dishes and grabs his backpack. School first, then Decathalon practice, and then May. Yeah, that sounds good. He has all the time in the world. </p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be working with Detectives Rogers and Odinson. I figure out of everyone here, they\u2019re the least likely to punch you in the face.\u201d Fury says with a wry note.</p><p>Tony looks unaffected, used to that kind of reaction ever since he started doing what he\u2019s doing. Police detectives didn\u2019t tend to take kindly to snarky consultants with three times their IQ. But that\u2019s the way the world works isn\u2019t it? </p><p>Rogers is tall, stern, the perfect all-American boy. Odinson, in contrast, is broad, buoyant, and smiles so wide Tony thinks he has a condition. He can already picture it now. Rogers, the no-nonsense, by the book cop who gets worn down by the puppy-like excitement of his partner who teaches him to soften up. Resisting the urge to grimace, Tony tries to present a somewhat neutral image of himself when Rogers glances up at him, eyes judgy and ascertaining. \u201cYou must be Stark.\u201d he holds out his hand, \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I get that a lot.\u201d Tony replies, grasping his hand and hiding his wince when Rogers squeezes hard. </p><p>Odinson surges forward, a hard look in his eyes and Tony gets a flash of a storm. The man looms over him, close enough that Tony can see the tiny scars on his collar. Odinson stares at him. Tony stares right back. \u201cIs this the part where you ask me out or am I just that out of your league?\u201d </p><p>Odinson blinks before he booms in laughter. Clapping Tony on the chest, the detective looks oddly pleased. \u201cI like this one.\u201d he glances down, something teasing in his eye, \u201cBit smaller than I thought you\u2019d be. Didn\u2019t you take down a mob in London?\u201d </p><p>Tony makes a face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a lot more giant than I thought you\u2019d be. NYPD hiring Harry Potter characters?\u201d </p><p>Fury makes a rumbling sound in his throat. \u201cIf we could all get off the testosterone train for a second, we have a crime to get to.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods, at full attention, \u201cSend me the location. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds best.\u201d Rogers nods and if Tony cared more about what people thought about him, he\u2019d say he didn\u2019t like that hard stance, arms crossed and eyes narrowed like Tony was a criminal who ran out on bail.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d he replies, in false cheer, \u201cIt means so much to me that you approve.\u201d </p><p>Tony strides out the door, calling a taxi and flashing him the address on his phone. He isn\u2019t here to make friends. He doesn\u2019t even need them. Never has. He\u2019s just here to solve crimes. One more distraction so he doesn\u2019t think of her-</p><p>No. </p><p>No more of that. </p><p>He has bigger fish to fry anyway. </p><p>He arrives at a cul-de-sac in a nicer end of town. The house is large, a well-maintained front lawn hosting an array of shrubbery and flowers meticulously groomed. Tony\u2019s senses go into hyperdrive. The smell of the gardenias, the number of windows, no marks on the ground. He catches sight of a muddy footprint, slammed into the front door as though to break it open. He can see the wear on the hinges, the streak of the mud as the man slid his foot off. Size eleven. Boot style. </p><p>Fury steps in front of him. \u201cFirst respondents found signs of a struggle in the kitchen and in the master bedroom.\u201d Tony makes no sign of listening, pulling out his phone and typing quickly.</p><p>\u201cBut no Ms. Delaney.\u201d </p><p>Tony pauses. \u201cRansom demand?\u201d</p><p>Fury shakes his head and Tony frowns like he\u2019s in thought before walking past him and the other detectives crowding around the kitchen. The detectives are already inside, but Tony heeds them no mind. He traces his way through the house imagining dozens of scenarios all at once, eliminating each one the evidence disproves it. He heads straight to the living room, examining the bland art all rich people had on their walls, but pausing at a set of photographs hanging neatly in a 3x3 grid on the wall. The first column has two rectangular frames of couple photos, the middle column two oval frames with just who he assumes is Mr. Delany, and the final column another set of rectangular couple photos. </p><p>He can sense Fury watching him and he\u2019s proven right when moments later he asks, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t look back at him, peering at the photos, something odd tickling him but nothing specific. \u201cNot sure.\u201d he admits.</p><p>Fury scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI guarantee I still know more than the rest of your detectives combined though.\u201d Tony turns around, a challenge in his raised brows. \u201cWanna bet captain?\u201d </p><p>Fury raises his hands in the hair, \u201cHey, hey, I\u2019m just here to facilitate your re-entry. No need to go all feral.\u201d </p><p>Tony gives him a look before staring at the pictures again. \u201cDid you find her phone yet or is that still gone too?\u201d</p><p>A detective Tony hasn\u2019t met yet- nor does he want to- rushes over to hand it to Fury when he asks and Tony wastes no time going through it to find what he needs. He slides through Ms. Delany\u2019s photos, an attractive women in her thirties with dyed red hair and compares them to the ones on the wall. \u201cAlright so she either lost a crazy amount of weight in what has to be two weeks, which is ridiculously unlikely, or she had a crazy amount of plastic surgery in the past two years.\u201d Tony clicks the phone shut. \u201cMore likely.\u201d</p><p>Fury squints. \u201cShe looks the exact same in both photos Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony whirls around, holding a finger in the air. \u201cExactly.\u201d he gestures to the wall. \u201cLook at the frames. The oval ones are older, been here longer, but the square frames are newer. And which ones feature Ms. Delaney.\u201d Fury flattens his expression. Tony raises a brow, \u201cYou didn\u2019t start believing in coincidences since I\u2019ve been gone have you Captain?\u201d</p><p>Fury gives him half a scoff. </p><p>\u201cAlright look.\u201d Tony pulls out her cellphone again, \u201cShe has tons of pics of herself all pretty and glamorous, but after two years? Poof. Not a single photo. But there are tons of everyone else. Surgery.\u201d he singsongs. </p><p>Fury still looks unconvinced, but Tony really doesn\u2019t need Fury\u2019s approval and stalks off, bending at the carpet to sniff at it, waving his hand to waft up any lingering scent. Everything is a clue and yet no one ever seemed to look. </p><p>Standing up abruptly, Tony decides to join the party in the kitchen, walking in on Rogers scribbling in his notebook while Odinson stares at the glass shards on the floor. There\u2019s a smear of blood next to the pieces and the glass appears to be the remains of a cup. Rogers looks up from his notepad, looking at him like he doesn\u2019t belong, but Tony ignores him, \u201cFury! Get in here!\u201d</p><p>Rogers snaps his notepad shut, crossing his arms and shifting his stance to express his disapproval. Tony rolls his eyes. Odinson steps back, cocking his head like Tony is a circus trick he\u2019d been wanting to see all day. All right. They wanted a show? He\u2019d give them a show.</p><p>Tony steps back, planting his feet apart, hands clasped in front of him. \u201cGet ready to be blown away kids.\u201d with a dramatic flourish, Tony points to the glass. \u201cMs. Delaney knew her attacker. She let him right in actually.\u201d </p><p>Rogers scoffs, \u201cCaptain are we seriously going to waste our time-\u201d</p><p>Tony carries on like Rogers hadn\u2019t said anything at all. \u201cThere are <i>two</i> broken glasses on the floor, if you had bothered to count the number of shards you probably could\u2019ve deduced that yourself, but,\u201d Tony shrugs, his expression unreadable, \u201cobviously, she was pouring a glass of water for her guest before he assaulted her.\u201d </p><p>Rogers nods condescendingly, \u201cRight, yeah, that makes sense. That\u2019s exactly what I would do after some guy busts down my door.\u201d </p><p>Rogers stares him down until Tony sighs, crouching to the floor to dig around under the fridge before pulling out a solid piece of the cup; the perfectly intact base that matched another base in the pile on the floor. \u201cTwo bases. Two cups Mr. Skeptic.\u201d </p><p>Odinson grins a little. \u201cAlright Stark. Two glasses. But how do you explain the footprint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d Pulling out his phone, Tony holds out the snapshot he took of the footprint. \u201cIf you look closer, you can see a drop of blood near the sole. I guarantee if you run it through the lab it\u2019ll turn up a positive for Ms. Delaney\u2019s blood. And?\u201d he holds out his arms, \u201cHow could that blood have gotten there?\u201d </p><p>Rogers scowls. </p><p>Tony grins. \u201cThe blood on his shoe is proof that he made that print <i>after</i> getting to our victim. Not before. That means she knew her attacker and he tried to hide it.\u201d </p><p>Tony steps out the kitchen, patting Rogers on the chest, \u201cDon\u2019t worry big guy, you\u2019ll catch up.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s halfway to the living room before he calls out, \u201cOh. And he took something too. Where\u2019s Mr. Delaney?\u201d </p><p>A sheepish man with round-rimmed glasses and a tweed coat is brought into the room. Tony wastes no time. \u201cOver there, on that table. Something\u2019s missing. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you possibly know if something was missing?\u201d Rogers bites.</p><p>Tony makes a frustrated noise in the back of his throat, his antsy energy giving him a spazzy quality as he walks to the centre of the room. \u201cIf you could pay attention, you\u2019d see that everything in this room is perfectly symmetrical. Two side tables, six picture frames, three decorative objects, only two there. Something\u2019s missing. You can even tell from the slight discolouration of the wood.\u201d impatiently, Tony turns back to Mr. Delaney, \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I, yes. There was\u2026That was where Annabelle kept her mother\u2019s music box.\u201d </p><p>Just like that, Tony\u2019s lively demeanor disappears. He looks almost deflated, like he had heard something he expected but still wished were unreal. \u201cI see.\u201d </p><p>Ignoring everyone, Tony turns immediately for the stairs. He finds the bedroom with no trouble. Predictably, the rest followed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a kidnapping case anymore.\u201d Tony looks at the bed sheets in disarray and the lamp pushed from its place on the bedside table. \u201cIt\u2019s a murder.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStark, you\u2019ve been right so far. But there\u2019s no body.\u201d Odinson says, scrutinizing the rest of the room. </p><p>But Tony can\u2019t stop looking at the lamp and there\u2019s the scent of blood in the room. He can\u2019t see any. But he knows it\u2019s there. The hypersensitivity of his nose won\u2019t let him be until he finds it. His eyes draw back to the lamp. He jolts, swivelling around to face the detectives. He holds his arms out like a child trying to fly and skids down the room before shaking his head and trying again. </p><p>\u201cCaptain-\u201d Rogers says, no doubt trying to complain more, but Fury just raises a hand, watching Tony silently.</p><p>Tony slides down again before stopping, an eerie expression on his face. \u201cShe\u2019s in the safe room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat safe room?\u201d Fury asks, voice low. </p><p>Tony points behind him. \u201cThe one behind that wall.\u201d he says, nonchalant. </p><p>Rogers uncrosses his arms, stepping forward. \u201cHer husband didn\u2019t say anything about that.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugs. \u201cHe probably didn\u2019t know. But look,\u201d he plucks a marble out of the decorative bowl across them, \u201call that reinforced steel makes the floor just the slightest bit uneven because of all that extra weight.\u201d He drops the marble, eyes locked on it as it rolls slowly but steadily down towards the wall. </p><p>Eyes drawn again to the lamp, Tony shoves his fingers behind the night stand, fiddling around until he found what he was looking for. He presses the switch and the wall behind him moves to reveal a small steel room. The marble rolls inside before coming to a complete stop as it gets trapped in a pool of blood.</p><p>Annabelle Delaney\u2019s eyes are vacant. </p><p>Tony looks away. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually hope I\u2019m wrong\u2026but this time, I really wish I was.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p> \u201cAlright so a little bit of salt\u2026\u201d Peter mutters to himself, tossing in a dash or two into the boiling water before stirring in the pasta. </p><p>\u201cOk Google, set timer for eight minutes.\u201d His old Galaxy 4 vibrates as the command goes through and Peter leaves to go sit at the kitchen table, filling out math homework sheets while he waits for the food to cook.</p><p>He\u2019s lost in thought solving quadratic equations when his phone blares violently. Jolted from his focus, Peter grabs the phone, relaxing when he sees General Heart Hospital as the caller ID. Oh. Just May then. He doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019d call from her work rather than use her cell, but Peter answers the call, a smile on his lips. \u201cHey May, what\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>The person on the other line takes a breath. It sounds almost sad. \u201cIs this Peter?\u201d</p><p>Peter furrows his brows. \u201cMarisa?\u201d </p><p>Marisa\u2019s one of May\u2019s nurse friends. She\u2019d been over a few times, enough for Peter to vaguely remember the way she speaks, but he has no clue why she\u2019s calling. \u201cPeter, you need to come to the hospital. It\u2019s May.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s entire world dissolves.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been in a car accident. And it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Peter doesn\u2019t want to hear it. </p><p>Absolutely cannot hear it. Not May. Not to him. Not to them. \u201cI\u2019m coming. I\u2019m coming. Please- just- just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best Peter.\u201d Marisa promises softly.</p><p>But Peter already knows it won\u2019t be good enough. It never is with the Parkers. And always, always. He\u2019s the one left behind. \u00a0</p><p>Peter sprints the entire way. He\u2019s restless on the subway, jumpy and frantic. When he races into the hospital, he navigates the familiar halls until he gets to reception. Hala\u2019s expression saddens, a weathered strength of constantly losing and saving souls in her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s in surgery, you know where to go.\u201d </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t have the capacity to remember to be polite before he\u2019s running down the hall. He turns the corner, bumping into a doctor, a built guy twice his size with a forester type beard and unexpressive eyes. Peter mumbles an apology, not really caring much about anything until he gets to the surgery wing. He collapses on the waiting chair. Someone comes to talk to him. The clock is ticking in the background. The tears blur the ugly table and magazines and other crying people. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how long he waits. </p><p>He can\u2019t feel much of anything anymore. He replays their final moments together. Not bad. Sweet. Tender. Not enough though. Should have been more. They deserve more. May. May. May. He just wants his aunt. He just wants May. </p><p>Peter\u2019s head falls into his hands.</p><p>\u201cMay Parker?\u201d</p><p>Peter chokes. Launching upwards, all but running in the surgeon\u2019s direction. \u201cYes. Me. That\u2019s me. I\u2019m Peter. Her nephew. Is she-is she okay?\u201d the surgeon looks like he\u2019s about to frown, give his typical I\u2019m so sorry we did everything we could speech and Peter shakes his head, \u201cNo-please. Please don\u2019t tell me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I think we should sit down.\u201d </p><p>Peter can\u2019t feel his legs. He can\u2019t feel his own heartbeat. He\u2019s led back to the waiting room chairs and he falls into the seat. Just\u2026falls. \u201cPeter, your aunt was involved in a car accident. On-lookers say she was acting erratically in the car right before it happened. She lost control of the wheel and crashed into the side of a building.\u201d</p><p>Peter gapes. What the- what the <i>hell</i> is this guy saying to him right now? May is-was? No, she- she drove more safely than anyone Peter knew. And she would never- she would never <i>do </i>that- that wasn\u2019t- that wasn\u2019t <i>her</i>. </p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d he insists, trying to show the universe it was wrong- it was wrong to take May Parker because this wasn\u2019t supposed to be how it ended. It <i>wasn\u2019t</i>.</p><p>The surgeon softens again. \u201cPeter\u2026were you aware that your aunt was on anti-depressants?\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s face slackens. Incredulity written in every sharp edge. \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst responders found a prescription bottle for bupropion in her purse and judging from the medication label and the quantity, it seems she was taking more than the recommended dose. We tested her blood and it confirmed our hypothesis. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of the medication is inducing first-time seizures in individuals not typically pre-disposed to them and based on witness statements, we believe this was all a tragic mistake.\u201d </p><p>Peter stands up, legs quivering. \u201cOf course this is a tragic mistake. You- you don\u2019t know her. She wasn\u2019t depressed and she wasn\u2019t taking medicine and she- this makes no sense! This makes no goddamn sense!!\u201d Peter\u2019s yelling now and he\u2019s making a scene but he can\u2019t help it because this isn\u2019t right, it isn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter rips his arm away, running back down the hall intent on finding Marisa.</p><p>\u201cMs. Hala. Ms. Hala, I need Marisa, where is she? I need to talk to her. Please.\u201d the receptionist frowns, glancing at him and then the screen, conflict in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter I\u2019m not sure-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Hala <i>please</i>.\u201d </p><p>She stares at him a bit longer before acquiescing, looking through the schedules. \u201cShe should be attending the fourth floor today.\u201d</p><p>Peter runs two steps a time yelling Marisa\u2019s name. He finds her when she pokes her head out, tears filling her eyes the second she sees him. \u201cOh Peter.\u201d her voice wobbles and suddenly he\u2019s in her arms. \u201cI wanted to find you after I heard but I needed to stay here.\u201d </p><p>He pulls away quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d he says, cavalier, \u201cDid you hear what they\u2019re saying about her? About May?\u201d </p><p>She stares at him wide eyed. \u201cPeter honey what are you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she taking anti-depressants?\u201d Peter pushes, every part of him pleading.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t- I don\u2019t know Peter. I don\u2019t know. But they found the bottle in her purse and May\u2019s been-\u201d pain paints a shadow across her face, \u201cMay had been acting weird for weeks now. It wouldn\u2019t be the most surprising thing.\u201d</p><p>The world freezes around him. May <i>had</i> been weird. Evasive, paranoid, scared. She said she had to take care of something. Something important that she couldn\u2019t tell Peter. Did she mean this? Her mental health? Depression?? Why wouldn\u2019t she have said anything? Why wouldn\u2019t she tell <i>him</i>?</p><p>He must\u2019ve said it out loud because suddenly Marisa has him in her arms again and she\u2019s patting his head. \u201cOh Peter. She probably just didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d </p><p>But that\u2019s <i>bullshit</i> and Peter pulls away. \u201cNo. This isn\u2019t right. It isn\u2019t right!\u201d and he turns in the other direction and runs as fast as he can go. </p><p>He squints as the sunlight pierces through his eyes as he surges out the hospital, fumbling to pull his phone out of his pocket. He calls an Uber and feels clenched right down to his atoms as they drive down the crowded New York city streets. They pull up at his apartment and he storms into it, throwing open his door as though he can find answers where there were none before. He stumbles inside, everything in the apartment hurts him now. Taunts him. Every surface is a memory of May and he can\u2019t deal with that right now. </p><p>Not now.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>How was he supposed to move on when everything was wrong?? </p><p>He bursts into May\u2019s room, determined to find something to prove- to prove what? Peter stops, his breathing heavy. If May\u2019s crash wasn\u2019t an accident, then that meant it was a\u2026Peter shakes. He doesn\u2019t know which one is worse. May was a nurse. She saved people for a living. She was kind and funny and witty and down-to-earth and it couldn\u2019t be possible\u2026</p><p>Peter tears apart her room anyway. </p><p>He throws open drawers and rifles through her things and ransacks anything that could hide a secret worth killing over. Finally, he finds it. </p><p>It\u2019s a medical file, swiped from the hospital. George Miller. Age seventy-three. Died from heart failure. Ruled: natural causes. It\u2019s May\u2019s handwriting. Peter knows it. He flips through to the bottom where the previous notes are and finds his brows furrowing. May had combed through her notes, highlighting as she went. George was fine, feeling good that morning. And then died of a heart attack two hours later. </p><p>And that isn\u2019t suspicious. People die all of the sudden every day. But May\u2019s hand-writing is frantic in the margins <i>WHAT ABOUT THE ISCHEMIA?? WHAT ABOUT THE MARK?? </i>It was underlined four times. </p><p>Peter drops the file, pulling out his phone and googling everything he didn\u2019t know. Ischemia: reduced blood flow preventing the heart from receiving oxygen. A severe blockage of one of the heart\u2019s arteries that can lead to a heart attack. Peter squints, so then it <i>was </i>natural. </p><p>Peter flips back in May\u2019s notes, where she\u2019s highlighted the epinephrine dose over and over. Something connecting in the back of his mind, he googles ischemia ephinephrine and is bombarded by academic journal after academic journal detailing the link in adrenaline causing ischemia\u2026and leaving that distinctive mark. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible for the epinephrine given <i>after</i> the heart attack to save the man to cause the ischemia. There would have had to be more of the drug in his blood for to it have that lethal effect. That means-</p><p>Peter falls to the floor. </p><p>George Miller was murdered. And May had figured it out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you it wasn\u2019t an accident!\u201d Peter\u2019s yelling in the middle of the NYPD seventh precinct and twelve hours ago he would have died at the thought, but he can\u2019t be stopped now.</p><p>The detective, Rogers, he thinks, tries to drop a comforting hand on his shoulder but Peter shirks back, glaring. \u201cSon. I know it\u2019s hard when a loved one dies but we did all the checks-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou evidently didn\u2019t- if you had, you would have seen this!\u201d Peter waves the file in Rogers\u2019 face but the man doesn\u2019t lose his cool, just keeps giving him that same placating face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d</p><p>Peter can hear the door to the captain\u2019s office open and close shut and hopes he isn\u2019t going to kick him out. But Peter has to keep trying. He has to. The only thing keeping the grief that threatens to consume him whole and leave nothing at all is his mission to bring his aunt justice. \u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s nothing you can do? It says so right in the file! George Miller was murdered and it looked like an accident because the epinephrine that killed him got disguised by the epinephrine the doctors used to resuscitate him!\u201d </p><p>Rogers narrows his eyes, his arms unclenching from where they were crossed at his chest and Peter thinks finally he\u2019s gotten through to him when the file is snatched from his hand by someone behind him. Peter whirls around, gaping at a man with the most chiseled goatee, skimming over the file, lips pursed. \u201cYour aunt. How did she die?\u201d the man says and Peter\u2019s too taken aback to tell him he really doesn\u2019t have any authority to go asking questions.</p><p>\u201cA car accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think someone tampered with the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Someone put a bottle of anti-depressants in her purse- um, bu-\u201d he frowns.</p><p>\u201cBupropion.\u201d The man supplies.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026that. They said she took too many of the pills and she had a seizure in the car so she lost control. And then she-\u201d Peter trails off, just looking at the man, expression saying it all. </p><p>The man frowns, lip tugging in sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry kid. But if it makes you feel any better, you\u2019re right.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widen. His heart hammers in his throat. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>The goatee guy snaps the file shut, staring him right in the eye. \u201cThe man, Miller, he was murdered.\u201d </p><p>Rogers stands up, \u201cStark you really think it\u2019s a good idea to say that to him right now?\u201d </p><p>The man- Stark- tilts his head like a challenge, \u201cSay what? The truth?\u201d he looks back at Peter, completely ignoring the detective, \u201cI\u2019ll take your case. I\u2019m waiting for some DNA evidence anyway. You have school or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat. Then you can come with me to the hospital. Fill me in on absolutely everything you know. Even the smallest detail could be important.\u201d</p><p>The man turns abruptly, speed-walking out of the bullpen and Peter jumps to match his pace. \u201cWait. Are you a detective here?\u201d</p><p>The man curls his nose. \u201cGod no. I\u2019m a consultant.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression scrunches. \u201cSo like\u2026you consult on crime?\u201d</p><p>The man sighs. \u201cI\u2019m what they call the department\u2019s last resort. A tricky case no one has the handle on? They call me.\u201d he glances at Peter from the corner of his eye. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll see the show soon enough. But for now, all you need to know is that I\u2019m Tony Stark. And I\u2019m going to catch whoever did this to your aunt.\u201d</p>",

Fury&rsquo;s eyes dart to his tense knuckles but they&rsquo;re back on his face just as quickly. &ldquo;Okay. Anything I need to know about?&rdquo; he stares at him meaningfully but Tony doesn&rsquo;t take the bait. </p>\n<p>His jaw tightens. &ldquo;Nothing you haven&rsquo;t already snooped out.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s foot starts shaking, something antsy crawling all over him. &ldquo;Are we done yet? With all this have my daughter home my eight stuff or can we get to what&rsquo;s actually important?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Fury almost looks amused. &ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Tony stands up, plants both hands on his desk. &ldquo;The case.&rdquo; </p>\n<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Peter!

Peter snickers into his cereal, &ldquo;Peter make sure you always put your stuff back in the same place.&rdquo; he mimics, laughing at her half-hearted glare.</p>\n<p>Hands on her hips, May tries to look stern but she can&rsquo;t help but laugh, &ldquo;Way to kick a girl when she&rsquo;s down Pete.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Peter flashes a cheeky grin before May runs back into her bedroom, pulling out her spring jacket and digging into the pockets with a quick, &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; before rushing back to him.</p>\n<p>All at once, the light-heartedness in her eyes fades and something haunted clouds the brown of her eyes. May looks at him for a moment, imperceptibly biting her lip before taking three steps towards him and pulling him in for a tight hug. &ldquo;May?&rdquo; his fingers grip the back of her shirt.</p>\n<p>He feels her take a deep breath from where she&rsquo;s pressed against his shoulder before she pulls away slowly. &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo; he asks again, gentler this time.</p>\n<p>Her smile is small, but she brushes the hair from his eyes like she&rsquo;s done a thousand times before and Peter has the strangest feeling that he should be trying to memorize this moment. &ldquo;Nothing sweetie.

I love you too May.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>She smiles at him again and he watches her leave to work with questions in his eyes. &ldquo;Are you coming back at seven today?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Earlier probably.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s something weird in how she says it, but Peter can&rsquo;t put his finger on it. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ok great! I&rsquo;ll make some pasta or something and we can eat together.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>May shoots him a grateful smile before waving her goodbyes. The door clicks shut behind her and Peter finds himself faltering in the silence. May was usually an open book, but today- not just today- the past while&hellip;she&rsquo;d been keeping something back. Not hiding, just&hellip;keeping. He&rsquo;d ask her about it tonight. Whatever it was, maybe he could help her. Or at least try. </p>\n<p>Resolved, Peter quickly washes his dishes and grabs his backpack. School first, then Decathalon practice, and then May. Yeah, that sounds good. He has all the time in the world. </p>\n",

The NYPD\u2019s seventh precinct has never once been quiet, but the cacophony of it all suits Captain Nick Fury just fine. </p><p>Tony thinks he could get used to it. </p><p>Fury\u2019s tone says relax, but Tony\u2019s in the lion\u2019s den and he isn\u2019t one to forget it. \u201cYou staying here for the next while?\u201d Fury asks, hands clasped over the desk. </p><p>\u201cPermanently.\u201d Tony says immediately. </p><p>Unconsciously, his fingers grip into the handles of his chair. Fury\u2019s eyes dart to his tense knuckles but they\u2019re back on his face just as quickly. \u201cOkay. Anything I need to know about?\u201d he stares at him meaningfully but Tony doesn\u2019t take the bait. </p><p>His jaw tightens. \u201cNothing you haven\u2019t already snooped out.\u201d Tony\u2019s foot starts shaking, something antsy crawling all over him. \u201cAre we done yet? With all this have my daughter home my eight stuff or can we get to what\u2019s actually important?\u201d </p><p>Fury almost looks amused. \u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d </p><p>Tony stands up, plants both hands on his desk. \u201cThe case.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>\u201cPeter! Have you seen my keys? They\u2019re not on the thing!\u201d </p><p>Twisting his lip, Peter pauses mid-bite. \u201cI think\u2026maybe\u2026wait didn\u2019t you put them in your jacket yesterday?\u201d</p><p>May smacks a hand to her forehead groaning. Peter snickers into his cereal, \u201cPeter make sure you always put your stuff back in the same place.\u201d he mimics, laughing at her half-hearted glare.</p><p>Hands on her hips, May tries to look stern but she can\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cWay to kick a girl when she\u2019s down Pete.\u201d </p><p>Peter flashes a cheeky grin before May runs back into her bedroom, pulling out her spring jacket and digging into the pockets with a quick, \u201cAha!\u201d before rushing back to him.</p><p>All at once, the light-heartedness in her eyes fades and something haunted clouds the brown of her eyes. May looks at him for a moment, imperceptibly biting her lip before taking three steps towards him and pulling him in for a tight hug. \u201cMay?\u201d his fingers grip the back of her shirt.</p><p>He feels her take a deep breath from where she\u2019s pressed against his shoulder before she pulls away slowly. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d he asks again, gentler this time.</p><p>Her smile is small, but she brushes the hair from his eyes like she\u2019s done a thousand times before and Peter has the strangest feeling that he should be trying to memorize this moment. \u201cNothing sweetie. I just really love you, you know that?\u201d </p><p>Peter smiles, a little wary, a little touched, \u201cYeah. I love you too May.\u201d </p><p>She smiles at him again and he watches her leave to work with questions in his eyes. \u201cAre you coming back at seven today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier probably.\u201d There\u2019s something weird in how she says it, but Peter can\u2019t put his finger on it. </p><p>\u201cOk great! I\u2019ll make some pasta or something and we can eat together.\u201d</p><p>May shoots him a grateful smile before waving her goodbyes. The door clicks shut behind her and Peter finds himself faltering in the silence. May was usually an open book, but today- not just today- the past while\u2026she\u2019d been keeping something back. Not hiding, just\u2026keeping. He\u2019d ask her about it tonight. Whatever it was, maybe he could help her. Or at least try. </p><p>Resolved, Peter quickly washes his dishes and grabs his backpack. School first, then Decathalon practice, and then May. Yeah, that sounds good. He has all the time in the world. </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be working with Detectives Rogers and Odinson. I figure out of everyone here, they\u2019re the least likely to punch you in the face.\u201d Fury says with a wry note.</p><p>Tony looks unaffected, used to that kind of reaction ever since he started doing what he\u2019s doing. Police detectives didn\u2019t tend to take kindly to snarky consultants with three times their IQ. But that\u2019s the way the world works isn\u2019t it? </p><p>Rogers is tall, stern, the perfect all-American boy. Odinson, in contrast, is broad, buoyant, and smiles so wide Tony thinks he has a condition. He can already picture it now. Rogers, the no-nonsense, by the book cop who gets worn down by the puppy-like excitement of his partner who teaches him to soften up. Resisting the urge to grimace, Tony tries to present a somewhat neutral image of himself when Rogers glances up at him, eyes judgy and ascertaining. \u201cYou must be Stark.\u201d he holds out his hand, \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I get that a lot.\u201d Tony replies, grasping his hand and hiding his wince when Rogers squeezes hard. </p><p>Odinson surges forward, a hard look in his eyes and Tony gets a flash of a storm. The man looms over him, close enough that Tony can see the tiny scars on his collar. Odinson stares at him. Tony stares right back. \u201cIs this the part where you ask me out or am I just that out of your league?\u201d </p><p>Odinson blinks before he booms in laughter. Clapping Tony on the chest, the detective looks oddly pleased. \u201cI like this one.\u201d he glances down, something teasing in his eye, \u201cBit smaller than I thought you\u2019d be. Didn\u2019t you take down a mob in London?\u201d </p><p>Tony makes a face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a lot more giant than I thought you\u2019d be. NYPD hiring Harry Potter characters?\u201d </p><p>Fury makes a rumbling sound in his throat. \u201cIf we could all get off the testosterone train for a second, we have a crime to get to.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods, at full attention, \u201cSend me the location. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds best.\u201d Rogers nods and if Tony cared more about what people thought about him, he\u2019d say he didn\u2019t like that hard stance, arms crossed and eyes narrowed like Tony was a criminal who ran out on bail.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d he replies, in false cheer, \u201cIt means so much to me that you approve.\u201d </p><p>Tony strides out the door, calling a taxi and flashing him the address on his phone. He isn\u2019t here to make friends. He doesn\u2019t even need them. Never has. He\u2019s just here to solve crimes. One more distraction so he doesn\u2019t think of her-</p><p>No. </p><p>No more of that. </p><p>He has bigger fish to fry anyway. </p><p>He arrives at a cul-de-sac in a nicer end of town. The house is large, a well-maintained front lawn hosting an array of shrubbery and flowers meticulously groomed. Tony\u2019s senses go into hyperdrive. The smell of the gardenias, the number of windows, no marks on the ground. He catches sight of a muddy footprint, slammed into the front door as though to break it open. He can see the wear on the hinges, the streak of the mud as the man slid his foot off. Size eleven. Boot style. </p><p>Fury steps in front of him. \u201cFirst respondents found signs of a struggle in the kitchen and in the master bedroom.\u201d Tony makes no sign of listening, pulling out his phone and typing quickly.</p><p>\u201cBut no Ms. Delaney.\u201d </p><p>Tony pauses. \u201cRansom demand?\u201d</p><p>Fury shakes his head and Tony frowns like he\u2019s in thought before walking past him and the other detectives crowding around the kitchen. The detectives are already inside, but Tony heeds them no mind. He traces his way through the house imagining dozens of scenarios all at once, eliminating each one the evidence disproves it. He heads straight to the living room, examining the bland art all rich people had on their walls, but pausing at a set of photographs hanging neatly in a 3x3 grid on the wall. The first column has two rectangular frames of couple photos, the middle column two oval frames with just who he assumes is Mr. Delany, and the final column another set of rectangular couple photos. </p><p>He can sense Fury watching him and he\u2019s proven right when moments later he asks, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t look back at him, peering at the photos, something odd tickling him but nothing specific. \u201cNot sure.\u201d he admits.</p><p>Fury scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI guarantee I still know more than the rest of your detectives combined though.\u201d Tony turns around, a challenge in his raised brows. \u201cWanna bet captain?\u201d </p><p>Fury raises his hands in the hair, \u201cHey, hey, I\u2019m just here to facilitate your re-entry. No need to go all feral.\u201d </p><p>Tony gives him a look before staring at the pictures again. \u201cDid you find her phone yet or is that still gone too?\u201d</p><p>A detective Tony hasn\u2019t met yet- nor does he want to- rushes over to hand it to Fury when he asks and Tony wastes no time going through it to find what he needs. He slides through Ms. Delany\u2019s photos, an attractive women in her thirties with dyed red hair and compares them to the ones on the wall. \u201cAlright so she either lost a crazy amount of weight in what has to be two weeks, which is ridiculously unlikely, or she had a crazy amount of plastic surgery in the past two years.\u201d Tony clicks the phone shut. \u201cMore likely.\u201d</p><p>Fury squints. \u201cShe looks the exact same in both photos Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony whirls around, holding a finger in the air. \u201cExactly.\u201d he gestures to the wall. \u201cLook at the frames. The oval ones are older, been here longer, but the square frames are newer. And which ones feature Ms. Delaney.\u201d Fury flattens his expression. Tony raises a brow, \u201cYou didn\u2019t start believing in coincidences since I\u2019ve been gone have you Captain?\u201d</p><p>Fury gives him half a scoff. </p><p>\u201cAlright look.\u201d Tony pulls out her cellphone again, \u201cShe has tons of pics of herself all pretty and glamorous, but after two years? Poof. Not a single photo. But there are tons of everyone else. Surgery.\u201d he singsongs. </p><p>Fury still looks unconvinced, but Tony really doesn\u2019t need Fury\u2019s approval and stalks off, bending at the carpet to sniff at it, waving his hand to waft up any lingering scent. Everything is a clue and yet no one ever seemed to look. </p><p>Standing up abruptly, Tony decides to join the party in the kitchen, walking in on Rogers scribbling in his notebook while Odinson stares at the glass shards on the floor. There\u2019s a smear of blood next to the pieces and the glass appears to be the remains of a cup. Rogers looks up from his notepad, looking at him like he doesn\u2019t belong, but Tony ignores him, \u201cFury! Get in here!\u201d</p><p>Rogers snaps his notepad shut, crossing his arms and shifting his stance to express his disapproval. Tony rolls his eyes. Odinson steps back, cocking his head like Tony is a circus trick he\u2019d been wanting to see all day. All right. They wanted a show? He\u2019d give them a show.</p><p>Tony steps back, planting his feet apart, hands clasped in front of him. \u201cGet ready to be blown away kids.\u201d with a dramatic flourish, Tony points to the glass. \u201cMs. Delaney knew her attacker. She let him right in actually.\u201d </p><p>Rogers scoffs, \u201cCaptain are we seriously going to waste our time-\u201d</p><p>Tony carries on like Rogers hadn\u2019t said anything at all. \u201cThere are <i>two</i> broken glasses on the floor, if you had bothered to count the number of shards you probably could\u2019ve deduced that yourself, but,\u201d Tony shrugs, his expression unreadable, \u201cobviously, she was pouring a glass of water for her guest before he assaulted her.\u201d </p><p>Rogers nods condescendingly, \u201cRight, yeah, that makes sense. That\u2019s exactly what I would do after some guy busts down my door.\u201d </p><p>Rogers stares him down until Tony sighs, crouching to the floor to dig around under the fridge before pulling out a solid piece of the cup; the perfectly intact base that matched another base in the pile on the floor. \u201cTwo bases. Two cups Mr. Skeptic.\u201d </p><p>Odinson grins a little. \u201cAlright Stark. Two glasses. But how do you explain the footprint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d Pulling out his phone, Tony holds out the snapshot he took of the footprint. \u201cIf you look closer, you can see a drop of blood near the sole. I guarantee if you run it through the lab it\u2019ll turn up a positive for Ms. Delaney\u2019s blood. And?\u201d he holds out his arms, \u201cHow could that blood have gotten there?\u201d </p><p>Rogers scowls. </p><p>Tony grins. \u201cThe blood on his shoe is proof that he made that print <i>after</i> getting to our victim. Not before. That means she knew her attacker and he tried to hide it.\u201d </p><p>Tony steps out the kitchen, patting Rogers on the chest, \u201cDon\u2019t worry big guy, you\u2019ll catch up.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s halfway to the living room before he calls out, \u201cOh. And he took something too. Where\u2019s Mr. Delaney?\u201d </p><p>A sheepish man with round-rimmed glasses and a tweed coat is brought into the room. Tony wastes no time. \u201cOver there, on that table. Something\u2019s missing. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you possibly know if something was missing?\u201d Rogers bites.</p><p>Tony makes a frustrated noise in the back of his throat, his antsy energy giving him a spazzy quality as he walks to the centre of the room. \u201cIf you could pay attention, you\u2019d see that everything in this room is perfectly symmetrical. Two side tables, six picture frames, three decorative objects, only two there. Something\u2019s missing. You can even tell from the slight discolouration of the wood.\u201d impatiently, Tony turns back to Mr. Delaney, \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I, yes. There was\u2026That was where Annabelle kept her mother\u2019s music box.\u201d </p><p>Just like that, Tony\u2019s lively demeanor disappears. He looks almost deflated, like he had heard something he expected but still wished were unreal. \u201cI see.\u201d </p><p>Ignoring everyone, Tony turns immediately for the stairs. He finds the bedroom with no trouble. Predictably, the rest followed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a kidnapping case anymore.\u201d Tony looks at the bed sheets in disarray and the lamp pushed from its place on the bedside table. \u201cIt\u2019s a murder.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStark, you\u2019ve been right so far. But there\u2019s no body.\u201d Odinson says, scrutinizing the rest of the room. </p><p>But Tony can\u2019t stop looking at the lamp and there\u2019s the scent of blood in the room. He can\u2019t see any. But he knows it\u2019s there. The hypersensitivity of his nose won\u2019t let him be until he finds it. His eyes draw back to the lamp. He jolts, swivelling around to face the detectives. He holds his arms out like a child trying to fly and skids down the room before shaking his head and trying again. </p><p>\u201cCaptain-\u201d Rogers says, no doubt trying to complain more, but Fury just raises a hand, watching Tony silently.</p><p>Tony slides down again before stopping, an eerie expression on his face. \u201cShe\u2019s in the safe room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat safe room?\u201d Fury asks, voice low. </p><p>Tony points behind him. \u201cThe one behind that wall.\u201d he says, nonchalant. </p><p>Rogers uncrosses his arms, stepping forward. \u201cHer husband didn\u2019t say anything about that.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugs. \u201cHe probably didn\u2019t know. But look,\u201d he plucks a marble out of the decorative bowl across them, \u201call that reinforced steel makes the floor just the slightest bit uneven because of all that extra weight.\u201d He drops the marble, eyes locked on it as it rolls slowly but steadily down towards the wall. </p><p>Eyes drawn again to the lamp, Tony shoves his fingers behind the night stand, fiddling around until he found what he was looking for. He presses the switch and the wall behind him moves to reveal a small steel room. The marble rolls inside before coming to a complete stop as it gets trapped in a pool of blood.</p><p>Annabelle Delaney\u2019s eyes are vacant. </p><p>Tony looks away. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually hope I\u2019m wrong\u2026but this time, I really wish I was.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p> \u201cAlright so a little bit of salt\u2026\u201d Peter mutters to himself, tossing in a dash or two into the boiling water before stirring in the pasta. </p><p>\u201cOk Google, set timer for eight minutes.\u201d His old Galaxy 4 vibrates as the command goes through and Peter leaves to go sit at the kitchen table, filling out math homework sheets while he waits for the food to cook.</p><p>He\u2019s lost in thought solving quadratic equations when his phone blares violently. Jolted from his focus, Peter grabs the phone, relaxing when he sees General Heart Hospital as the caller ID. Oh. Just May then. He doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019d call from her work rather than use her cell, but Peter answers the call, a smile on his lips. \u201cHey May, what\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>The person on the other line takes a breath. It sounds almost sad. \u201cIs this Peter?\u201d</p><p>Peter furrows his brows. \u201cMarisa?\u201d </p><p>Marisa\u2019s one of May\u2019s nurse friends. She\u2019d been over a few times, enough for Peter to vaguely remember the way she speaks, but he has no clue why she\u2019s calling. \u201cPeter, you need to come to the hospital. It\u2019s May.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s entire world dissolves.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been in a car accident. And it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Peter doesn\u2019t want to hear it. </p><p>Absolutely cannot hear it. Not May. Not to him. Not to them. \u201cI\u2019m coming. I\u2019m coming. Please- just- just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best Peter.\u201d Marisa promises softly.</p><p>But Peter already knows it won\u2019t be good enough. It never is with the Parkers. And always, always. He\u2019s the one left behind. \u00a0</p><p>Peter sprints the entire way. He\u2019s restless on the subway, jumpy and frantic. When he races into the hospital, he navigates the familiar halls until he gets to reception. Hala\u2019s expression saddens, a weathered strength of constantly losing and saving souls in her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s in surgery, you know where to go.\u201d </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t have the capacity to remember to be polite before he\u2019s running down the hall. He turns the corner, bumping into a doctor, a built guy twice his size with a forester type beard and unexpressive eyes. Peter mumbles an apology, not really caring much about anything until he gets to the surgery wing. He collapses on the waiting chair. Someone comes to talk to him. The clock is ticking in the background. The tears blur the ugly table and magazines and other crying people. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how long he waits. </p><p>He can\u2019t feel much of anything anymore. He replays their final moments together. Not bad. Sweet. Tender. Not enough though. Should have been more. They deserve more. May. May. May. He just wants his aunt. He just wants May. </p><p>Peter\u2019s head falls into his hands.</p><p>\u201cMay Parker?\u201d</p><p>Peter chokes. Launching upwards, all but running in the surgeon\u2019s direction. \u201cYes. Me. That\u2019s me. I\u2019m Peter. Her nephew. Is she-is she okay?\u201d the surgeon looks like he\u2019s about to frown, give his typical I\u2019m so sorry we did everything we could speech and Peter shakes his head, \u201cNo-please. Please don\u2019t tell me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I think we should sit down.\u201d </p><p>Peter can\u2019t feel his legs. He can\u2019t feel his own heartbeat. He\u2019s led back to the waiting room chairs and he falls into the seat. Just\u2026falls. \u201cPeter, your aunt was involved in a car accident. On-lookers say she was acting erratically in the car right before it happened. She lost control of the wheel and crashed into the side of a building.\u201d</p><p>Peter gapes. What the- what the <i>hell</i> is this guy saying to him right now? May is-was? No, she- she drove more safely than anyone Peter knew. And she would never- she would never <i>do </i>that- that wasn\u2019t- that wasn\u2019t <i>her</i>. </p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d he insists, trying to show the universe it was wrong- it was wrong to take May Parker because this wasn\u2019t supposed to be how it ended. It <i>wasn\u2019t</i>.</p><p>The surgeon softens again. \u201cPeter\u2026were you aware that your aunt was on anti-depressants?\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s face slackens. Incredulity written in every sharp edge. \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst responders found a prescription bottle for bupropion in her purse and judging from the medication label and the quantity, it seems she was taking more than the recommended dose. We tested her blood and it confirmed our hypothesis. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of the medication is inducing first-time seizures in individuals not typically pre-disposed to them and based on witness statements, we believe this was all a tragic mistake.\u201d </p><p>Peter stands up, legs quivering. \u201cOf course this is a tragic mistake. You- you don\u2019t know her. She wasn\u2019t depressed and she wasn\u2019t taking medicine and she- this makes no sense! This makes no goddamn sense!!\u201d Peter\u2019s yelling now and he\u2019s making a scene but he can\u2019t help it because this isn\u2019t right, it isn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter rips his arm away, running back down the hall intent on finding Marisa.</p><p>\u201cMs. Hala. Ms. Hala, I need Marisa, where is she? I need to talk to her. Please.\u201d the receptionist frowns, glancing at him and then the screen, conflict in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter I\u2019m not sure-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Hala <i>please</i>.\u201d </p><p>She stares at him a bit longer before acquiescing, looking through the schedules. \u201cShe should be attending the fourth floor today.\u201d</p><p>Peter runs two steps a time yelling Marisa\u2019s name. He finds her when she pokes her head out, tears filling her eyes the second she sees him. \u201cOh Peter.\u201d her voice wobbles and suddenly he\u2019s in her arms. \u201cI wanted to find you after I heard but I needed to stay here.\u201d </p><p>He pulls away quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d he says, cavalier, \u201cDid you hear what they\u2019re saying about her? About May?\u201d </p><p>She stares at him wide eyed. \u201cPeter honey what are you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she taking anti-depressants?\u201d Peter pushes, every part of him pleading.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t- I don\u2019t know Peter. I don\u2019t know. But they found the bottle in her purse and May\u2019s been-\u201d pain paints a shadow across her face, \u201cMay had been acting weird for weeks now. It wouldn\u2019t be the most surprising thing.\u201d</p><p>The world freezes around him. May <i>had</i> been weird. Evasive, paranoid, scared. She said she had to take care of something. Something important that she couldn\u2019t tell Peter. Did she mean this? Her mental health? Depression?? Why wouldn\u2019t she have said anything? Why wouldn\u2019t she tell <i>him</i>?</p><p>He must\u2019ve said it out loud because suddenly Marisa has him in her arms again and she\u2019s patting his head. \u201cOh Peter. She probably just didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d </p><p>But that\u2019s <i>bullshit</i> and Peter pulls away. \u201cNo. This isn\u2019t right. It isn\u2019t right!\u201d and he turns in the other direction and runs as fast as he can go. </p><p>He squints as the sunlight pierces through his eyes as he surges out the hospital, fumbling to pull his phone out of his pocket. He calls an Uber and feels clenched right down to his atoms as they drive down the crowded New York city streets. They pull up at his apartment and he storms into it, throwing open his door as though he can find answers where there were none before. He stumbles inside, everything in the apartment hurts him now. Taunts him. Every surface is a memory of May and he can\u2019t deal with that right now. </p><p>Not now.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>How was he supposed to move on when everything was wrong?? </p><p>He bursts into May\u2019s room, determined to find something to prove- to prove what? Peter stops, his breathing heavy. If May\u2019s crash wasn\u2019t an accident, then that meant it was a\u2026Peter shakes. He doesn\u2019t know which one is worse. May was a nurse. She saved people for a living. She was kind and funny and witty and down-to-earth and it couldn\u2019t be possible\u2026</p><p>Peter tears apart her room anyway. </p><p>He throws open drawers and rifles through her things and ransacks anything that could hide a secret worth killing over. Finally, he finds it. </p><p>It\u2019s a medical file, swiped from the hospital. George Miller. Age seventy-three. Died from heart failure. Ruled: natural causes. It\u2019s May\u2019s handwriting. Peter knows it. He flips through to the bottom where the previous notes are and finds his brows furrowing. May had combed through her notes, highlighting as she went. George was fine, feeling good that morning. And then died of a heart attack two hours later. </p><p>And that isn\u2019t suspicious. People die all of the sudden every day. But May\u2019s hand-writing is frantic in the margins <i>WHAT ABOUT THE ISCHEMIA?? WHAT ABOUT THE MARK?? </i>It was underlined four times. </p><p>Peter drops the file, pulling out his phone and googling everything he didn\u2019t know. Ischemia: reduced blood flow preventing the heart from receiving oxygen. A severe blockage of one of the heart\u2019s arteries that can lead to a heart attack. Peter squints, so then it <i>was </i>natural. </p><p>Peter flips back in May\u2019s notes, where she\u2019s highlighted the epinephrine dose over and over. Something connecting in the back of his mind, he googles ischemia ephinephrine and is bombarded by academic journal after academic journal detailing the link in adrenaline causing ischemia\u2026and leaving that distinctive mark. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible for the epinephrine given <i>after</i> the heart attack to save the man to cause the ischemia. There would have had to be more of the drug in his blood for to it have that lethal effect. That means-</p><p>Peter falls to the floor. </p><p>George Miller was murdered. And May had figured it out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you it wasn\u2019t an accident!\u201d Peter\u2019s yelling in the middle of the NYPD seventh precinct and twelve hours ago he would have died at the thought, but he can\u2019t be stopped now.</p><p>The detective, Rogers, he thinks, tries to drop a comforting hand on his shoulder but Peter shirks back, glaring. \u201cSon. I know it\u2019s hard when a loved one dies but we did all the checks-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou evidently didn\u2019t- if you had, you would have seen this!\u201d Peter waves the file in Rogers\u2019 face but the man doesn\u2019t lose his cool, just keeps giving him that same placating face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d</p><p>Peter can hear the door to the captain\u2019s office open and close shut and hopes he isn\u2019t going to kick him out. But Peter has to keep trying. He has to. The only thing keeping the grief that threatens to consume him whole and leave nothing at all is his mission to bring his aunt justice. \u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s nothing you can do? It says so right in the file! George Miller was murdered and it looked like an accident because the epinephrine that killed him got disguised by the epinephrine the doctors used to resuscitate him!\u201d </p><p>Rogers narrows his eyes, his arms unclenching from where they were crossed at his chest and Peter thinks finally he\u2019s gotten through to him when the file is snatched from his hand by someone behind him. Peter whirls around, gaping at a man with the most chiseled goatee, skimming over the file, lips pursed. \u201cYour aunt. How did she die?\u201d the man says and Peter\u2019s too taken aback to tell him he really doesn\u2019t have any authority to go asking questions.</p><p>\u201cA car accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think someone tampered with the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Someone put a bottle of anti-depressants in her purse- um, bu-\u201d he frowns.</p><p>\u201cBupropion.\u201d The man supplies.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026that. They said she took too many of the pills and she had a seizure in the car so she lost control. And then she-\u201d Peter trails off, just looking at the man, expression saying it all. </p><p>The man frowns, lip tugging in sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry kid. But if it makes you feel any better, you\u2019re right.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widen. His heart hammers in his throat. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>The goatee guy snaps the file shut, staring him right in the eye. \u201cThe man, Miller, he was murdered.\u201d </p><p>Rogers stands up, \u201cStark you really think it\u2019s a good idea to say that to him right now?\u201d </p><p>The man- Stark- tilts his head like a challenge, \u201cSay what? The truth?\u201d he looks back at Peter, completely ignoring the detective, \u201cI\u2019ll take your case. I\u2019m waiting for some DNA evidence anyway. You have school or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat. Then you can come with me to the hospital. Fill me in on absolutely everything you know. Even the smallest detail could be important.\u201d</p><p>The man turns abruptly, speed-walking out of the bullpen and Peter jumps to match his pace. \u201cWait. Are you a detective here?\u201d</p><p>The man curls his nose. \u201cGod no. I\u2019m a consultant.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression scrunches. \u201cSo like\u2026you consult on crime?\u201d</p><p>The man sighs. \u201cI\u2019m what they call the department\u2019s last resort. A tricky case no one has the handle on? They call me.\u201d he glances at Peter from the corner of his eye. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll see the show soon enough. But for now, all you need to know is that I\u2019m Tony Stark. And I\u2019m going to catch whoever did this to your aunt.\u201d</p></p>",

But when new evidence comes to light proving foul play, no one in the NYPD will give Peter the time of day.</p><p>No one that is, except genius consulting detective on probation, Tony Stark. But Tony has his own demons to fight. Struggling to maintain his sobriety after a tragedy in London forced him overseas, Tony learns that what mends hearts might not be at the bottom of a bottle but something like a string of unsolved murders and perhaps even love. <br></p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19031392/chapters/45200047#main\" target=\"_blank\">AO3 Link</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>Fury stares him down, his one eye tunneling through his words to grasp at his intentions. Tony sits very still. Back straight. Attentive. Not shirking away from the intensity that threatens to reveal him whole. </p><p>Fury stares some more, then cracks a grin and leans back into his chair. \u201cTony Stark.\u201d he drawls, \u201cNever thought I\u2019d see you again.\u201d </p><p>Tony quirks his brows. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d come to this side of the world either.\u201d </p><p>The blare of honking drivers and the faint thrum of the subway reverberate in the New York City air. Tony breathes through it, his hyper-sensitivity forces the scratching of Officer Blair\u2019s Lotto card from the next room into his ear-drums, he hears the sound of two copiers churning out the contents of police files, a woman laughing into the phone. The NYPD\u2019s seventh precinct has never once been quiet, but the cacophony of it all suits Captain Nick Fury just fine. </p><p>Tony thinks he could get used to it. </p><p>Fury\u2019s tone says relax, but Tony\u2019s in the lion\u2019s den and he isn\u2019t one to forget it. \u201cYou staying here for the next while?\u201d Fury asks, hands clasped over the desk. </p><p>\u201cPermanently.\u201d Tony says immediately. </p><p>Unconsciously, his fingers grip into the handles of his chair. Fury\u2019s eyes dart to his tense knuckles but they\u2019re back on his face just as quickly. \u201cOkay. Anything I need to know about?\u201d he stares at him meaningfully but Tony doesn\u2019t take the bait. </p><p>His jaw tightens. \u201cNothing you haven\u2019t already snooped out.\u201d Tony\u2019s foot starts shaking, something antsy crawling all over him. \u201cAre we done yet? With all this have my daughter home my eight stuff or can we get to what\u2019s actually important?\u201d </p><p>Fury almost looks amused. \u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d </p><p>Tony stands up, plants both hands on his desk. \u201cThe case.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>\u201cPeter! Have you seen my keys? They\u2019re not on the thing!\u201d </p><p>Twisting his lip, Peter pauses mid-bite. \u201cI think\u2026maybe\u2026wait didn\u2019t you put them in your jacket yesterday?\u201d</p><p>May smacks a hand to her forehead groaning. Peter snickers into his cereal, \u201cPeter make sure you always put your stuff back in the same place.\u201d he mimics, laughing at her half-hearted glare.</p><p>Hands on her hips, May tries to look stern but she can\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cWay to kick a girl when she\u2019s down Pete.\u201d </p><p>Peter flashes a cheeky grin before May runs back into her bedroom, pulling out her spring jacket and digging into the pockets with a quick, \u201cAha!\u201d before rushing back to him.</p><p>All at once, the light-heartedness in her eyes fades and something haunted clouds the brown of her eyes. May looks at him for a moment, imperceptibly biting her lip before taking three steps towards him and pulling him in for a tight hug. \u201cMay?\u201d his fingers grip the back of her shirt.</p><p>He feels her take a deep breath from where she\u2019s pressed against his shoulder before she pulls away slowly. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d he asks again, gentler this time.</p><p>Her smile is small, but she brushes the hair from his eyes like she\u2019s done a thousand times before and Peter has the strangest feeling that he should be trying to memorize this moment. \u201cNothing sweetie. I just really love you, you know that?\u201d </p><p>Peter smiles, a little wary, a little touched, \u201cYeah. I love you too May.\u201d </p><p>She smiles at him again and he watches her leave to work with questions in his eyes. \u201cAre you coming back at seven today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier probably.\u201d There\u2019s something weird in how she says it, but Peter can\u2019t put his finger on it. </p><p>\u201cOk great! I\u2019ll make some pasta or something and we can eat together.\u201d</p><p>May shoots him a grateful smile before waving her goodbyes. The door clicks shut behind her and Peter finds himself faltering in the silence. May was usually an open book, but today- not just today- the past while\u2026she\u2019d been keeping something back. Not hiding, just\u2026keeping. He\u2019d ask her about it tonight. Whatever it was, maybe he could help her. Or at least try. </p><p>Resolved, Peter quickly washes his dishes and grabs his backpack. School first, then Decathalon practice, and then May. Yeah, that sounds good. He has all the time in the world. </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be working with Detectives Rogers and Odinson. I figure out of everyone here, they\u2019re the least likely to punch you in the face.\u201d Fury says with a wry note.</p><p>Tony looks unaffected, used to that kind of reaction ever since he started doing what he\u2019s doing. Police detectives didn\u2019t tend to take kindly to snarky consultants with three times their IQ. But that\u2019s the way the world works isn\u2019t it? </p><p>Rogers is tall, stern, the perfect all-American boy. Odinson, in contrast, is broad, buoyant, and smiles so wide Tony thinks he has a condition. He can already picture it now. Rogers, the no-nonsense, by the book cop who gets worn down by the puppy-like excitement of his partner who teaches him to soften up. Resisting the urge to grimace, Tony tries to present a somewhat neutral image of himself when Rogers glances up at him, eyes judgy and ascertaining. \u201cYou must be Stark.\u201d he holds out his hand, \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I get that a lot.\u201d Tony replies, grasping his hand and hiding his wince when Rogers squeezes hard. </p><p>Odinson surges forward, a hard look in his eyes and Tony gets a flash of a storm. The man looms over him, close enough that Tony can see the tiny scars on his collar. Odinson stares at him. Tony stares right back. \u201cIs this the part where you ask me out or am I just that out of your league?\u201d </p><p>Odinson blinks before he booms in laughter. Clapping Tony on the chest, the detective looks oddly pleased. \u201cI like this one.\u201d he glances down, something teasing in his eye, \u201cBit smaller than I thought you\u2019d be. Didn\u2019t you take down a mob in London?\u201d </p><p>Tony makes a face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a lot more giant than I thought you\u2019d be. NYPD hiring Harry Potter characters?\u201d </p><p>Fury makes a rumbling sound in his throat. \u201cIf we could all get off the testosterone train for a second, we have a crime to get to.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods, at full attention, \u201cSend me the location. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds best.\u201d Rogers nods and if Tony cared more about what people thought about him, he\u2019d say he didn\u2019t like that hard stance, arms crossed and eyes narrowed like Tony was a criminal who ran out on bail.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d he replies, in false cheer, \u201cIt means so much to me that you approve.\u201d </p><p>Tony strides out the door, calling a taxi and flashing him the address on his phone. He isn\u2019t here to make friends. He doesn\u2019t even need them. Never has. He\u2019s just here to solve crimes. One more distraction so he doesn\u2019t think of her-</p><p>No. </p><p>No more of that. </p><p>He has bigger fish to fry anyway. </p><p>He arrives at a cul-de-sac in a nicer end of town. The house is large, a well-maintained front lawn hosting an array of shrubbery and flowers meticulously groomed. Tony\u2019s senses go into hyperdrive. The smell of the gardenias, the number of windows, no marks on the ground. He catches sight of a muddy footprint, slammed into the front door as though to break it open. He can see the wear on the hinges, the streak of the mud as the man slid his foot off. Size eleven. Boot style. </p><p>Fury steps in front of him. \u201cFirst respondents found signs of a struggle in the kitchen and in the master bedroom.\u201d Tony makes no sign of listening, pulling out his phone and typing quickly.</p><p>\u201cBut no Ms. Delaney.\u201d </p><p>Tony pauses. \u201cRansom demand?\u201d</p><p>Fury shakes his head and Tony frowns like he\u2019s in thought before walking past him and the other detectives crowding around the kitchen. The detectives are already inside, but Tony heeds them no mind. He traces his way through the house imagining dozens of scenarios all at once, eliminating each one the evidence disproves it. He heads straight to the living room, examining the bland art all rich people had on their walls, but pausing at a set of photographs hanging neatly in a 3x3 grid on the wall. The first column has two rectangular frames of couple photos, the middle column two oval frames with just who he assumes is Mr. Delany, and the final column another set of rectangular couple photos. </p><p>He can sense Fury watching him and he\u2019s proven right when moments later he asks, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t look back at him, peering at the photos, something odd tickling him but nothing specific. \u201cNot sure.\u201d he admits.</p><p>Fury scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI guarantee I still know more than the rest of your detectives combined though.\u201d Tony turns around, a challenge in his raised brows. \u201cWanna bet captain?\u201d </p><p>Fury raises his hands in the hair, \u201cHey, hey, I\u2019m just here to facilitate your re-entry. No need to go all feral.\u201d </p><p>Tony gives him a look before staring at the pictures again. \u201cDid you find her phone yet or is that still gone too?\u201d</p><p>A detective Tony hasn\u2019t met yet- nor does he want to- rushes over to hand it to Fury when he asks and Tony wastes no time going through it to find what he needs. He slides through Ms. Delany\u2019s photos, an attractive women in her thirties with dyed red hair and compares them to the ones on the wall. \u201cAlright so she either lost a crazy amount of weight in what has to be two weeks, which is ridiculously unlikely, or she had a crazy amount of plastic surgery in the past two years.\u201d Tony clicks the phone shut. \u201cMore likely.\u201d</p><p>Fury squints. \u201cShe looks the exact same in both photos Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony whirls around, holding a finger in the air. \u201cExactly.\u201d he gestures to the wall. \u201cLook at the frames. The oval ones are older, been here longer, but the square frames are newer. And which ones feature Ms. Delaney.\u201d Fury flattens his expression. Tony raises a brow, \u201cYou didn\u2019t start believing in coincidences since I\u2019ve been gone have you Captain?\u201d</p><p>Fury gives him half a scoff. </p><p>\u201cAlright look.\u201d Tony pulls out her cellphone again, \u201cShe has tons of pics of herself all pretty and glamorous, but after two years? Poof. Not a single photo. But there are tons of everyone else. Surgery.\u201d he singsongs. </p><p>Fury still looks unconvinced, but Tony really doesn\u2019t need Fury\u2019s approval and stalks off, bending at the carpet to sniff at it, waving his hand to waft up any lingering scent. Everything is a clue and yet no one ever seemed to look. </p><p>Standing up abruptly, Tony decides to join the party in the kitchen, walking in on Rogers scribbling in his notebook while Odinson stares at the glass shards on the floor. There\u2019s a smear of blood next to the pieces and the glass appears to be the remains of a cup. Rogers looks up from his notepad, looking at him like he doesn\u2019t belong, but Tony ignores him, \u201cFury! Get in here!\u201d</p><p>Rogers snaps his notepad shut, crossing his arms and shifting his stance to express his disapproval. Tony rolls his eyes. Odinson steps back, cocking his head like Tony is a circus trick he\u2019d been wanting to see all day. All right. They wanted a show? He\u2019d give them a show.</p><p>Tony steps back, planting his feet apart, hands clasped in front of him. \u201cGet ready to be blown away kids.\u201d with a dramatic flourish, Tony points to the glass. \u201cMs. Delaney knew her attacker. She let him right in actually.\u201d </p><p>Rogers scoffs, \u201cCaptain are we seriously going to waste our time-\u201d</p><p>Tony carries on like Rogers hadn\u2019t said anything at all. \u201cThere are <i>two</i> broken glasses on the floor, if you had bothered to count the number of shards you probably could\u2019ve deduced that yourself, but,\u201d Tony shrugs, his expression unreadable, \u201cobviously, she was pouring a glass of water for her guest before he assaulted her.\u201d </p><p>Rogers nods condescendingly, \u201cRight, yeah, that makes sense. That\u2019s exactly what I would do after some guy busts down my door.\u201d </p><p>Rogers stares him down until Tony sighs, crouching to the floor to dig around under the fridge before pulling out a solid piece of the cup; the perfectly intact base that matched another base in the pile on the floor. \u201cTwo bases. Two cups Mr. Skeptic.\u201d </p><p>Odinson grins a little. \u201cAlright Stark. Two glasses. But how do you explain the footprint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d Pulling out his phone, Tony holds out the snapshot he took of the footprint. \u201cIf you look closer, you can see a drop of blood near the sole. I guarantee if you run it through the lab it\u2019ll turn up a positive for Ms. Delaney\u2019s blood. And?\u201d he holds out his arms, \u201cHow could that blood have gotten there?\u201d </p><p>Rogers scowls. </p><p>Tony grins. \u201cThe blood on his shoe is proof that he made that print <i>after</i> getting to our victim. Not before. That means she knew her attacker and he tried to hide it.\u201d </p><p>Tony steps out the kitchen, patting Rogers on the chest, \u201cDon\u2019t worry big guy, you\u2019ll catch up.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s halfway to the living room before he calls out, \u201cOh. And he took something too. Where\u2019s Mr. Delaney?\u201d </p><p>A sheepish man with round-rimmed glasses and a tweed coat is brought into the room. Tony wastes no time. \u201cOver there, on that table. Something\u2019s missing. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you possibly know if something was missing?\u201d Rogers bites.</p><p>Tony makes a frustrated noise in the back of his throat, his antsy energy giving him a spazzy quality as he walks to the centre of the room. \u201cIf you could pay attention, you\u2019d see that everything in this room is perfectly symmetrical. Two side tables, six picture frames, three decorative objects, only two there. Something\u2019s missing. You can even tell from the slight discolouration of the wood.\u201d impatiently, Tony turns back to Mr. Delaney, \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I, yes. There was\u2026That was where Annabelle kept her mother\u2019s music box.\u201d </p><p>Just like that, Tony\u2019s lively demeanor disappears. He looks almost deflated, like he had heard something he expected but still wished were unreal. \u201cI see.\u201d </p><p>Ignoring everyone, Tony turns immediately for the stairs. He finds the bedroom with no trouble. Predictably, the rest followed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a kidnapping case anymore.\u201d Tony looks at the bed sheets in disarray and the lamp pushed from its place on the bedside table. \u201cIt\u2019s a murder.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStark, you\u2019ve been right so far. But there\u2019s no body.\u201d Odinson says, scrutinizing the rest of the room. </p><p>But Tony can\u2019t stop looking at the lamp and there\u2019s the scent of blood in the room. He can\u2019t see any. But he knows it\u2019s there. The hypersensitivity of his nose won\u2019t let him be until he finds it. His eyes draw back to the lamp. He jolts, swivelling around to face the detectives. He holds his arms out like a child trying to fly and skids down the room before shaking his head and trying again. </p><p>\u201cCaptain-\u201d Rogers says, no doubt trying to complain more, but Fury just raises a hand, watching Tony silently.</p><p>Tony slides down again before stopping, an eerie expression on his face. \u201cShe\u2019s in the safe room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat safe room?\u201d Fury asks, voice low. </p><p>Tony points behind him. \u201cThe one behind that wall.\u201d he says, nonchalant. </p><p>Rogers uncrosses his arms, stepping forward. \u201cHer husband didn\u2019t say anything about that.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugs. \u201cHe probably didn\u2019t know. But look,\u201d he plucks a marble out of the decorative bowl across them, \u201call that reinforced steel makes the floor just the slightest bit uneven because of all that extra weight.\u201d He drops the marble, eyes locked on it as it rolls slowly but steadily down towards the wall. </p><p>Eyes drawn again to the lamp, Tony shoves his fingers behind the night stand, fiddling around until he found what he was looking for. He presses the switch and the wall behind him moves to reveal a small steel room. The marble rolls inside before coming to a complete stop as it gets trapped in a pool of blood.</p><p>Annabelle Delaney\u2019s eyes are vacant. </p><p>Tony looks away. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually hope I\u2019m wrong\u2026but this time, I really wish I was.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p> \u201cAlright so a little bit of salt\u2026\u201d Peter mutters to himself, tossing in a dash or two into the boiling water before stirring in the pasta. </p><p>\u201cOk Google, set timer for eight minutes.\u201d His old Galaxy 4 vibrates as the command goes through and Peter leaves to go sit at the kitchen table, filling out math homework sheets while he waits for the food to cook.</p><p>He\u2019s lost in thought solving quadratic equations when his phone blares violently. Jolted from his focus, Peter grabs the phone, relaxing when he sees General Heart Hospital as the caller ID. Oh. Just May then. He doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019d call from her work rather than use her cell, but Peter answers the call, a smile on his lips. \u201cHey May, what\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>The person on the other line takes a breath. It sounds almost sad. \u201cIs this Peter?\u201d</p><p>Peter furrows his brows. \u201cMarisa?\u201d </p><p>Marisa\u2019s one of May\u2019s nurse friends. She\u2019d been over a few times, enough for Peter to vaguely remember the way she speaks, but he has no clue why she\u2019s calling. \u201cPeter, you need to come to the hospital. It\u2019s May.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s entire world dissolves.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been in a car accident. And it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Peter doesn\u2019t want to hear it. </p><p>Absolutely cannot hear it. Not May. Not to him. Not to them. \u201cI\u2019m coming. I\u2019m coming. Please- just- just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best Peter.\u201d Marisa promises softly.</p><p>But Peter already knows it won\u2019t be good enough. It never is with the Parkers. And always, always. He\u2019s the one left behind. \u00a0</p><p>Peter sprints the entire way. He\u2019s restless on the subway, jumpy and frantic. When he races into the hospital, he navigates the familiar halls until he gets to reception. Hala\u2019s expression saddens, a weathered strength of constantly losing and saving souls in her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s in surgery, you know where to go.\u201d </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t have the capacity to remember to be polite before he\u2019s running down the hall. He turns the corner, bumping into a doctor, a built guy twice his size with a forester type beard and unexpressive eyes. Peter mumbles an apology, not really caring much about anything until he gets to the surgery wing. He collapses on the waiting chair. Someone comes to talk to him. The clock is ticking in the background. The tears blur the ugly table and magazines and other crying people. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how long he waits. </p><p>He can\u2019t feel much of anything anymore. He replays their final moments together. Not bad. Sweet. Tender. Not enough though. Should have been more. They deserve more. May. May. May. He just wants his aunt. He just wants May. </p><p>Peter\u2019s head falls into his hands.</p><p>\u201cMay Parker?\u201d</p><p>Peter chokes. Launching upwards, all but running in the surgeon\u2019s direction. \u201cYes. Me. That\u2019s me. I\u2019m Peter. Her nephew. Is she-is she okay?\u201d the surgeon looks like he\u2019s about to frown, give his typical I\u2019m so sorry we did everything we could speech and Peter shakes his head, \u201cNo-please. Please don\u2019t tell me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I think we should sit down.\u201d </p><p>Peter can\u2019t feel his legs. He can\u2019t feel his own heartbeat. He\u2019s led back to the waiting room chairs and he falls into the seat. Just\u2026falls. \u201cPeter, your aunt was involved in a car accident. On-lookers say she was acting erratically in the car right before it happened. She lost control of the wheel and crashed into the side of a building.\u201d</p><p>Peter gapes. What the- what the <i>hell</i> is this guy saying to him right now? May is-was? No, she- she drove more safely than anyone Peter knew. And she would never- she would never <i>do </i>that- that wasn\u2019t- that wasn\u2019t <i>her</i>. </p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d he insists, trying to show the universe it was wrong- it was wrong to take May Parker because this wasn\u2019t supposed to be how it ended. It <i>wasn\u2019t</i>.</p><p>The surgeon softens again. \u201cPeter\u2026were you aware that your aunt was on anti-depressants?\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s face slackens. Incredulity written in every sharp edge. \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst responders found a prescription bottle for bupropion in her purse and judging from the medication label and the quantity, it seems she was taking more than the recommended dose. We tested her blood and it confirmed our hypothesis. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of the medication is inducing first-time seizures in individuals not typically pre-disposed to them and based on witness statements, we believe this was all a tragic mistake.\u201d </p><p>Peter stands up, legs quivering. \u201cOf course this is a tragic mistake. You- you don\u2019t know her. She wasn\u2019t depressed and she wasn\u2019t taking medicine and she- this makes no sense! This makes no goddamn sense!!\u201d Peter\u2019s yelling now and he\u2019s making a scene but he can\u2019t help it because this isn\u2019t right, it isn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter rips his arm away, running back down the hall intent on finding Marisa.</p><p>\u201cMs. Hala. Ms. Hala, I need Marisa, where is she? I need to talk to her. Please.\u201d the receptionist frowns, glancing at him and then the screen, conflict in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter I\u2019m not sure-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Hala <i>please</i>.\u201d </p><p>She stares at him a bit longer before acquiescing, looking through the schedules. \u201cShe should be attending the fourth floor today.\u201d</p><p>Peter runs two steps a time yelling Marisa\u2019s name. He finds her when she pokes her head out, tears filling her eyes the second she sees him. \u201cOh Peter.\u201d her voice wobbles and suddenly he\u2019s in her arms. \u201cI wanted to find you after I heard but I needed to stay here.\u201d </p><p>He pulls away quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d he says, cavalier, \u201cDid you hear what they\u2019re saying about her? About May?\u201d </p><p>She stares at him wide eyed. \u201cPeter honey what are you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she taking anti-depressants?\u201d Peter pushes, every part of him pleading.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t- I don\u2019t know Peter. I don\u2019t know. But they found the bottle in her purse and May\u2019s been-\u201d pain paints a shadow across her face, \u201cMay had been acting weird for weeks now. It wouldn\u2019t be the most surprising thing.\u201d</p><p>The world freezes around him. May <i>had</i> been weird. Evasive, paranoid, scared. She said she had to take care of something. Something important that she couldn\u2019t tell Peter. Did she mean this? Her mental health? Depression?? Why wouldn\u2019t she have said anything? Why wouldn\u2019t she tell <i>him</i>?</p><p>He must\u2019ve said it out loud because suddenly Marisa has him in her arms again and she\u2019s patting his head. \u201cOh Peter. She probably just didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d </p><p>But that\u2019s <i>bullshit</i> and Peter pulls away. \u201cNo. This isn\u2019t right. It isn\u2019t right!\u201d and he turns in the other direction and runs as fast as he can go. </p><p>He squints as the sunlight pierces through his eyes as he surges out the hospital, fumbling to pull his phone out of his pocket. He calls an Uber and feels clenched right down to his atoms as they drive down the crowded New York city streets. They pull up at his apartment and he storms into it, throwing open his door as though he can find answers where there were none before. He stumbles inside, everything in the apartment hurts him now. Taunts him. Every surface is a memory of May and he can\u2019t deal with that right now. </p><p>Not now.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>How was he supposed to move on when everything was wrong?? </p><p>He bursts into May\u2019s room, determined to find something to prove- to prove what? Peter stops, his breathing heavy. If May\u2019s crash wasn\u2019t an accident, then that meant it was a\u2026Peter shakes. He doesn\u2019t know which one is worse. May was a nurse. She saved people for a living. She was kind and funny and witty and down-to-earth and it couldn\u2019t be possible\u2026</p><p>Peter tears apart her room anyway. </p><p>He throws open drawers and rifles through her things and ransacks anything that could hide a secret worth killing over. Finally, he finds it. </p><p>It\u2019s a medical file, swiped from the hospital. George Miller. Age seventy-three. Died from heart failure. Ruled: natural causes. It\u2019s May\u2019s handwriting. Peter knows it. He flips through to the bottom where the previous notes are and finds his brows furrowing. May had combed through her notes, highlighting as she went. George was fine, feeling good that morning. And then died of a heart attack two hours later. </p><p>And that isn\u2019t suspicious. People die all of the sudden every day. But May\u2019s hand-writing is frantic in the margins <i>WHAT ABOUT THE ISCHEMIA?? WHAT ABOUT THE MARK?? </i>It was underlined four times. </p><p>Peter drops the file, pulling out his phone and googling everything he didn\u2019t know. Ischemia: reduced blood flow preventing the heart from receiving oxygen. A severe blockage of one of the heart\u2019s arteries that can lead to a heart attack. Peter squints, so then it <i>was </i>natural. </p><p>Peter flips back in May\u2019s notes, where she\u2019s highlighted the epinephrine dose over and over. Something connecting in the back of his mind, he googles ischemia ephinephrine and is bombarded by academic journal after academic journal detailing the link in adrenaline causing ischemia\u2026and leaving that distinctive mark. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible for the epinephrine given <i>after</i> the heart attack to save the man to cause the ischemia. There would have had to be more of the drug in his blood for to it have that lethal effect. That means-</p><p>Peter falls to the floor. </p><p>George Miller was murdered. And May had figured it out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you it wasn\u2019t an accident!\u201d Peter\u2019s yelling in the middle of the NYPD seventh precinct and twelve hours ago he would have died at the thought, but he can\u2019t be stopped now.</p><p>The detective, Rogers, he thinks, tries to drop a comforting hand on his shoulder but Peter shirks back, glaring. \u201cSon. I know it\u2019s hard when a loved one dies but we did all the checks-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou evidently didn\u2019t- if you had, you would have seen this!\u201d Peter waves the file in Rogers\u2019 face but the man doesn\u2019t lose his cool, just keeps giving him that same placating face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d</p><p>Peter can hear the door to the captain\u2019s office open and close shut and hopes he isn\u2019t going to kick him out. But Peter has to keep trying. He has to. The only thing keeping the grief that threatens to consume him whole and leave nothing at all is his mission to bring his aunt justice. \u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s nothing you can do? It says so right in the file! George Miller was murdered and it looked like an accident because the epinephrine that killed him got disguised by the epinephrine the doctors used to resuscitate him!\u201d </p><p>Rogers narrows his eyes, his arms unclenching from where they were crossed at his chest and Peter thinks finally he\u2019s gotten through to him when the file is snatched from his hand by someone behind him. Peter whirls around, gaping at a man with the most chiseled goatee, skimming over the file, lips pursed. \u201cYour aunt. How did she die?\u201d the man says and Peter\u2019s too taken aback to tell him he really doesn\u2019t have any authority to go asking questions.</p><p>\u201cA car accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think someone tampered with the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Someone put a bottle of anti-depressants in her purse- um, bu-\u201d he frowns.</p><p>\u201cBupropion.\u201d The man supplies.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026that. They said she took too many of the pills and she had a seizure in the car so she lost control. And then she-\u201d Peter trails off, just looking at the man, expression saying it all. </p><p>The man frowns, lip tugging in sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry kid. But if it makes you feel any better, you\u2019re right.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widen. His heart hammers in his throat. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>The goatee guy snaps the file shut, staring him right in the eye. \u201cThe man, Miller, he was murdered.\u201d </p><p>Rogers stands up, \u201cStark you really think it\u2019s a good idea to say that to him right now?\u201d </p><p>The man- Stark- tilts his head like a challenge, \u201cSay what? The truth?\u201d he looks back at Peter, completely ignoring the detective, \u201cI\u2019ll take your case. I\u2019m waiting for some DNA evidence anyway. You have school or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat. Then you can come with me to the hospital. Fill me in on absolutely everything you know. Even the smallest detail could be important.\u201d</p><p>The man turns abruptly, speed-walking out of the bullpen and Peter jumps to match his pace. \u201cWait. Are you a detective here?\u201d</p><p>The man curls his nose. \u201cGod no. I\u2019m a consultant.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression scrunches. \u201cSo like\u2026you consult on crime?\u201d</p><p>The man sighs. \u201cI\u2019m what they call the department\u2019s last resort. A tricky case no one has the handle on? They call me.\u201d he glances at Peter from the corner of his eye. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll see the show soon enough. But for now, all you need to know is that I\u2019m Tony Stark. And I\u2019m going to catch whoever did this to your aunt.\u201d</p></p>",

Struggling to maintain his sobriety after a tragedy in London forced him overseas, Tony learns that what mends hearts might not be at the bottom of a bottle but something like a string of unsolved murders and perhaps even love. <br /></p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19031392/chapters/45200047#main\" target=\"_blank\">AO3 Link</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>Fury stares him down, his one eye tunneling through his words to grasp at his intentions. Tony sits very still. Back straight. Attentive. Not shirking away from the intensity that threatens to reveal him whole. </p><p>Fury stares some more, then cracks a grin and leans back into his chair. &ldquo;Tony Stark.&rdquo; he drawls, &ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d see you again.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony quirks his brows. &ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d come to this side of the world either.&rdquo; </p><p>The blare of honking drivers and the faint thrum of the subway reverberate in the New York City air. Tony breathes through it, his hyper-sensitivity forces the scratching of Officer Blair&rsquo;s Lotto card from the next room into his ear-drums, he hears the sound of two copiers churning out the contents of police files, a woman laughing into the phone. The NYPD&rsquo;s seventh precinct has never once been quiet, but the cacophony of it all suits Captain Nick Fury just fine. </p><p>Tony thinks he could get used to it. </p><p>Fury&rsquo;s tone says relax, but Tony&rsquo;s in the lion&rsquo;s den and he isn&rsquo;t one to forget it. &ldquo;You staying here for the next while?&rdquo; Fury asks, hands clasped over the desk. </p><p>&ldquo;Permanently.&rdquo; Tony says immediately. </p><p>Unconsciously, his fingers grip into the handles of his chair. Fury&rsquo;s eyes dart to his tense knuckles but they&rsquo;re back on his face just as quickly. &ldquo;Okay. Anything I need to know about?&rdquo; he stares at him meaningfully but Tony doesn&rsquo;t take the bait. </p><p>His jaw tightens. &ldquo;Nothing you haven&rsquo;t already snooped out.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s foot starts shaking, something antsy crawling all over him. &ldquo;Are we done yet? With all this have my daughter home my eight stuff or can we get to what&rsquo;s actually important?&rdquo; </p><p>Fury almost looks amused. &ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony stands up, plants both hands on his desk. &ldquo;The case.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter! Have you seen my keys? They&rsquo;re not on the thing!&rdquo; </p><p>Twisting his lip, Peter pauses mid-bite. &ldquo;I think&hellip;maybe&hellip;wait didn&rsquo;t you put them in your jacket yesterday?&rdquo;</p><p>May smacks a hand to her forehead groaning. Peter snickers into his cereal, &ldquo;Peter make sure you always put your stuff back in the same place.&rdquo; he mimics, laughing at her half-hearted glare.</p><p>Hands on her hips, May tries to look stern but she can&rsquo;t help but laugh, &ldquo;Way to kick a girl when she&rsquo;s down Pete.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter flashes a cheeky grin before May runs back into her bedroom, pulling out her spring jacket and digging into the pockets with a quick, &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; before rushing back to him.</p><p>All at once, the light-heartedness in her eyes fades and something haunted clouds the brown of her eyes. May looks at him for a moment, imperceptibly biting her lip before taking three steps towards him and pulling him in for a tight hug. &ldquo;May?&rdquo; his fingers grip the back of her shirt.</p><p>He feels her take a deep breath from where she&rsquo;s pressed against his shoulder before she pulls away slowly. &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo; he asks again, gentler this time.</p><p>Her smile is small, but she brushes the hair from his eyes like she&rsquo;s done a thousand times before and Peter has the strangest feeling that he should be trying to memorize this moment. &ldquo;Nothing sweetie. I just really love you, you know that?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter smiles, a little wary, a little touched, &ldquo;Yeah. I love you too May.&rdquo; </p><p>She smiles at him again and he watches her leave to work with questions in his eyes. &ldquo;Are you coming back at seven today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Earlier probably.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s something weird in how she says it, but Peter can&rsquo;t put his finger on it. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok great! I&rsquo;ll make some pasta or something and we can eat together.&rdquo;</p><p>May shoots him a grateful smile before waving her goodbyes. The door clicks shut behind her and Peter finds himself faltering in the silence. May was usually an open book, but today- not just today- the past while&hellip;she&rsquo;d been keeping something back. Not hiding, just&hellip;keeping. He&rsquo;d ask her about it tonight. Whatever it was, maybe he could help her. Or at least try. </p><p>Resolved, Peter quickly washes his dishes and grabs his backpack. School first, then Decathalon practice, and then May. Yeah, that sounds good. He has all the time in the world. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be working with Detectives Rogers and Odinson. I figure out of everyone here, they&rsquo;re the least likely to punch you in the face.&rdquo; Fury says with a wry note.</p><p>Tony looks unaffected, used to that kind of reaction ever since he started doing what he&rsquo;s doing. Police detectives didn&rsquo;t tend to take kindly to snarky consultants with three times their IQ. But that&rsquo;s the way the world works isn&rsquo;t it? </p><p>Rogers is tall, stern, the perfect all-American boy. Odinson, in contrast, is broad, buoyant, and smiles so wide Tony thinks he has a condition. He can already picture it now. Rogers, the no-nonsense, by the book cop who gets worn down by the puppy-like excitement of his partner who teaches him to soften up. Resisting the urge to grimace, Tony tries to present a somewhat neutral image of himself when Rogers glances up at him, eyes judgy and ascertaining. &ldquo;You must be Stark.&rdquo; he holds out his hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I get that a lot.&rdquo; Tony replies, grasping his hand and hiding his wince when Rogers squeezes hard. </p><p>Odinson surges forward, a hard look in his eyes and Tony gets a flash of a storm. The man looms over him, close enough that Tony can see the tiny scars on his collar. Odinson stares at him. Tony stares right back. &ldquo;Is this the part where you ask me out or am I just that out of your league?&rdquo; </p><p>Odinson blinks before he booms in laughter. Clapping Tony on the chest, the detective looks oddly pleased. &ldquo;I like this one.&rdquo; he glances down, something teasing in his eye, &ldquo;Bit smaller than I thought you&rsquo;d be. Didn&rsquo;t you take down a mob in London?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony makes a face. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a lot more giant than I thought you&rsquo;d be. NYPD hiring Harry Potter characters?&rdquo; </p><p>Fury makes a rumbling sound in his throat. &ldquo;If we could all get off the testosterone train for a second, we have a crime to get to.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony nods, at full attention, &ldquo;Send me the location. I&rsquo;ll meet you there.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sounds best.&rdquo; Rogers nods and if Tony cared more about what people thought about him, he&rsquo;d say he didn&rsquo;t like that hard stance, arms crossed and eyes narrowed like Tony was a criminal who ran out on bail.</p><p>&ldquo;Great.&rdquo; he replies, in false cheer, &ldquo;It means so much to me that you approve.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony strides out the door, calling a taxi and flashing him the address on his phone. He isn&rsquo;t here to make friends. He doesn&rsquo;t even need them. Never has. He&rsquo;s just here to solve crimes. One more distraction so he doesn&rsquo;t think of her-</p><p>No. </p><p>No more of that. </p><p>He has bigger fish to fry anyway. </p><p>He arrives at a cul-de-sac in a nicer end of town. The house is large, a well-maintained front lawn hosting an array of shrubbery and flowers meticulously groomed. Tony&rsquo;s senses go into hyperdrive. The smell of the gardenias, the number of windows, no marks on the ground. He catches sight of a muddy footprint, slammed into the front door as though to break it open. He can see the wear on the hinges, the streak of the mud as the man slid his foot off. Size eleven. Boot style. </p><p>Fury steps in front of him. &ldquo;First respondents found signs of a struggle in the kitchen and in the master bedroom.&rdquo; Tony makes no sign of listening, pulling out his phone and typing quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;But no Ms. Delaney.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony pauses. &ldquo;Ransom demand?&rdquo;</p><p>Fury shakes his head and Tony frowns like he&rsquo;s in thought before walking past him and the other detectives crowding around the kitchen. The detectives are already inside, but Tony heeds them no mind. He traces his way through the house imagining dozens of scenarios all at once, eliminating each one the evidence disproves it. He heads straight to the living room, examining the bland art all rich people had on their walls, but pausing at a set of photographs hanging neatly in a 3x3 grid on the wall. The first column has two rectangular frames of couple photos, the middle column two oval frames with just who he assumes is Mr. Delany, and the final column another set of rectangular couple photos. </p><p>He can sense Fury watching him and he&rsquo;s proven right when moments later he asks, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony doesn&rsquo;t look back at him, peering at the photos, something odd tickling him but nothing specific. &ldquo;Not sure.&rdquo; he admits.</p><p>Fury scoffs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a first.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I guarantee I still know more than the rest of your detectives combined though.&rdquo; Tony turns around, a challenge in his raised brows. &ldquo;Wanna bet captain?&rdquo; </p><p>Fury raises his hands in the hair, &ldquo;Hey, hey, I&rsquo;m just here to facilitate your re-entry. No need to go all feral.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony gives him a look before staring at the pictures again. &ldquo;Did you find her phone yet or is that still gone too?&rdquo;</p><p>A detective Tony hasn&rsquo;t met yet- nor does he want to- rushes over to hand it to Fury when he asks and Tony wastes no time going through it to find what he needs. He slides through Ms. Delany&rsquo;s photos, an attractive women in her thirties with dyed red hair and compares them to the ones on the wall. &ldquo;Alright so she either lost a crazy amount of weight in what has to be two weeks, which is ridiculously unlikely, or she had a crazy amount of plastic surgery in the past two years.&rdquo; Tony clicks the phone shut. &ldquo;More likely.&rdquo;</p><p>Fury squints. &ldquo;She looks the exact same in both photos Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony whirls around, holding a finger in the air. &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; he gestures to the wall. &ldquo;Look at the frames. The oval ones are older, been here longer, but the square frames are newer. And which ones feature Ms. Delaney.&rdquo; Fury flattens his expression. Tony raises a brow, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t start believing in coincidences since I&rsquo;ve been gone have you Captain?&rdquo;</p><p>Fury gives him half a scoff. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright look.&rdquo; Tony pulls out her cellphone again, &ldquo;She has tons of pics of herself all pretty and glamorous, but after two years? Poof. Not a single photo. But there are tons of everyone else. Surgery.&rdquo; he singsongs. </p><p>Fury still looks unconvinced, but Tony really doesn&rsquo;t need Fury&rsquo;s approval and stalks off, bending at the carpet to sniff at it, waving his hand to waft up any lingering scent. Everything is a clue and yet no one ever seemed to look. </p><p>Standing up abruptly, Tony decides to join the party in the kitchen, walking in on Rogers scribbling in his notebook while Odinson stares at the glass shards on the floor. There&rsquo;s a smear of blood next to the pieces and the glass appears to be the remains of a cup. Rogers looks up from his notepad, looking at him like he doesn&rsquo;t belong, but Tony ignores him, &ldquo;Fury! Get in here!&rdquo;</p><p>Rogers snaps his notepad shut, crossing his arms and shifting his stance to express his disapproval. Tony rolls his eyes. Odinson steps back, cocking his head like Tony is a circus trick he&rsquo;d been wanting to see all day. All right. They wanted a show? He&rsquo;d give them a show.</p><p>Tony steps back, planting his feet apart, hands clasped in front of him. &ldquo;Get ready to be blown away kids.&rdquo; with a dramatic flourish, Tony points to the glass. &ldquo;Ms. Delaney knew her attacker. She let him right in actually.&rdquo; </p><p>Rogers scoffs, &ldquo;Captain are we seriously going to waste our time-&rdquo;</p><p>Tony carries on like Rogers hadn&rsquo;t said anything at all. &ldquo;There are <i>two</i> broken glasses on the floor, if you had bothered to count the number of shards you probably could&rsquo;ve deduced that yourself, but,&rdquo; Tony shrugs, his expression unreadable, &ldquo;obviously, she was pouring a glass of water for her guest before he assaulted her.&rdquo; </p><p>Rogers nods condescendingly, &ldquo;Right, yeah, that makes sense. That&rsquo;s exactly what I would do after some guy busts down my door.&rdquo; </p><p>Rogers stares him down until Tony sighs, crouching to the floor to dig around under the fridge before pulling out a solid piece of the cup; the perfectly intact base that matched another base in the pile on the floor. &ldquo;Two bases. Two cups Mr. Skeptic.&rdquo; </p><p>Odinson grins a little. &ldquo;Alright Stark. Two glasses. But how do you explain the footprint?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d never ask.&rdquo; Pulling out his phone, Tony holds out the snapshot he took of the footprint. &ldquo;If you look closer, you can see a drop of blood near the sole. I guarantee if you run it through the lab it&rsquo;ll turn up a positive for Ms. Delaney&rsquo;s blood. And?&rdquo; he holds out his arms, &ldquo;How could that blood have gotten there?&rdquo; </p><p>Rogers scowls. </p><p>Tony grins. &ldquo;The blood on his shoe is proof that he made that print <i>after</i> getting to our victim. Not before. That means she knew her attacker and he tried to hide it.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony steps out the kitchen, patting Rogers on the chest, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry big guy, you&rsquo;ll catch up.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s halfway to the living room before he calls out, &ldquo;Oh. And he took something too. Where&rsquo;s Mr. Delaney?&rdquo; </p><p>A sheepish man with round-rimmed glasses and a tweed coat is brought into the room. Tony wastes no time. &ldquo;Over there, on that table. Something&rsquo;s missing. What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How could you possibly know if something was missing?&rdquo; Rogers bites.</p><p>Tony makes a frustrated noise in the back of his throat, his antsy energy giving him a spazzy quality as he walks to the centre of the room. &ldquo;If you could pay attention, you&rsquo;d see that everything in this room is perfectly symmetrical. Two side tables, six picture frames, three decorative objects, only two there. Something&rsquo;s missing. You can even tell from the slight discolouration of the wood.&rdquo; impatiently, Tony turns back to Mr. Delaney, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I, yes. There was&hellip;That was where Annabelle kept her mother&rsquo;s music box.&rdquo; </p><p>Just like that, Tony&rsquo;s lively demeanor disappears. He looks almost deflated, like he had heard something he expected but still wished were unreal. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; </p><p>Ignoring everyone, Tony turns immediately for the stairs. He finds the bedroom with no trouble. Predictably, the rest followed. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a kidnapping case anymore.&rdquo; Tony looks at the bed sheets in disarray and the lamp pushed from its place on the bedside table. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a murder.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Stark, you&rsquo;ve been right so far. But there&rsquo;s no body.&rdquo; Odinson says, scrutinizing the rest of the room. </p><p>But Tony can&rsquo;t stop looking at the lamp and there&rsquo;s the scent of blood in the room. He can&rsquo;t see any. But he knows it&rsquo;s there. The hypersensitivity of his nose won&rsquo;t let him be until he finds it. His eyes draw back to the lamp. He jolts, swivelling around to face the detectives. He holds his arms out like a child trying to fly and skids down the room before shaking his head and trying again. </p><p>&ldquo;Captain-&rdquo; Rogers says, no doubt trying to complain more, but Fury just raises a hand, watching Tony silently.</p><p>Tony slides down again before stopping, an eerie expression on his face. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the safe room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What safe room?&rdquo; Fury asks, voice low. </p><p>Tony points behind him. &ldquo;The one behind that wall.&rdquo; he says, nonchalant. </p><p>Rogers uncrosses his arms, stepping forward. &ldquo;Her husband didn&rsquo;t say anything about that.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shrugs. &ldquo;He probably didn&rsquo;t know. But look,&rdquo; he plucks a marble out of the decorative bowl across them, &ldquo;all that reinforced steel makes the floor just the slightest bit uneven because of all that extra weight.&rdquo; He drops the marble, eyes locked on it as it rolls slowly but steadily down towards the wall. </p><p>Eyes drawn again to the lamp, Tony shoves his fingers behind the night stand, fiddling around until he found what he was looking for. He presses the switch and the wall behind him moves to reveal a small steel room. The marble rolls inside before coming to a complete stop as it gets trapped in a pool of blood.</p><p>Annabelle Delaney&rsquo;s eyes are vacant. </p><p>Tony looks away. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t usually hope I&rsquo;m wrong&hellip;but this time, I really wish I was.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p> &ldquo;Alright so a little bit of salt&hellip;&rdquo; Peter mutters to himself, tossing in a dash or two into the boiling water before stirring in the pasta. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok Google, set timer for eight minutes.&rdquo; His old Galaxy 4 vibrates as the command goes through and Peter leaves to go sit at the kitchen table, filling out math homework sheets while he waits for the food to cook.</p><p>He&rsquo;s lost in thought solving quadratic equations when his phone blares violently. Jolted from his focus, Peter grabs the phone, relaxing when he sees General Heart Hospital as the caller ID. Oh. Just May then. He doesn&rsquo;t know why she&rsquo;d call from her work rather than use her cell, but Peter answers the call, a smile on his lips. &ldquo;Hey May, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; </p><p>The person on the other line takes a breath. It sounds almost sad. &ldquo;Is this Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter furrows his brows. &ldquo;Marisa?&rdquo; </p><p>Marisa&rsquo;s one of May&rsquo;s nurse friends. She&rsquo;d been over a few times, enough for Peter to vaguely remember the way she speaks, but he has no clue why she&rsquo;s calling. &ldquo;Peter, you need to come to the hospital. It&rsquo;s May.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s entire world dissolves.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been in a car accident. And it&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; Peter doesn&rsquo;t want to hear it. </p><p>Absolutely cannot hear it. Not May. Not to him. Not to them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming. I&rsquo;m coming. Please- just- just-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do our best Peter.&rdquo; Marisa promises softly.</p><p>But Peter already knows it won&rsquo;t be good enough. It never is with the Parkers. And always, always. He&rsquo;s the one left behind. &nbsp;</p><p>Peter sprints the entire way. He&rsquo;s restless on the subway, jumpy and frantic. When he races into the hospital, he navigates the familiar halls until he gets to reception. Hala&rsquo;s expression saddens, a weathered strength of constantly losing and saving souls in her eyes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in surgery, you know where to go.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity to remember to be polite before he&rsquo;s running down the hall. He turns the corner, bumping into a doctor, a built guy twice his size with a forester type beard and unexpressive eyes. Peter mumbles an apology, not really caring much about anything until he gets to the surgery wing. He collapses on the waiting chair. Someone comes to talk to him. The clock is ticking in the background. The tears blur the ugly table and magazines and other crying people. </p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t know how long he waits. </p><p>He can&rsquo;t feel much of anything anymore. He replays their final moments together. Not bad. Sweet. Tender. Not enough though. Should have been more. They deserve more. May. May. May. He just wants his aunt. He just wants May. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s head falls into his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;May Parker?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter chokes. Launching upwards, all but running in the surgeon&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;Yes. Me. That&rsquo;s me. I&rsquo;m Peter. Her nephew. Is she-is she okay?&rdquo; the surgeon looks like he&rsquo;s about to frown, give his typical I&rsquo;m so sorry we did everything we could speech and Peter shakes his head, &ldquo;No-please. Please don&rsquo;t tell me-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, I think we should sit down.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter can&rsquo;t feel his legs. He can&rsquo;t feel his own heartbeat. He&rsquo;s led back to the waiting room chairs and he falls into the seat. Just&hellip;falls. &ldquo;Peter, your aunt was involved in a car accident. On-lookers say she was acting erratically in the car right before it happened. She lost control of the wheel and crashed into the side of a building.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter gapes. What the- what the <i>hell</i> is this guy saying to him right now? May is-was? No, she- she drove more safely than anyone Peter knew. And she would never- she would never <i>do </i>that- that wasn&rsquo;t- that wasn&rsquo;t <i>her</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;What does that even mean? That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.&rdquo; he insists, trying to show the universe it was wrong- it was wrong to take May Parker because this wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be how it ended. It <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i>.</p><p>The surgeon softens again. &ldquo;Peter&hellip;were you aware that your aunt was on anti-depressants?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s face slackens. Incredulity written in every sharp edge. &ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;First responders found a prescription bottle for bupropion in her purse and judging from the medication label and the quantity, it seems she was taking more than the recommended dose. We tested her blood and it confirmed our hypothesis. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of the medication is inducing first-time seizures in individuals not typically pre-disposed to them and based on witness statements, we believe this was all a tragic mistake.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter stands up, legs quivering. &ldquo;Of course this is a tragic mistake. You- you don&rsquo;t know her. She wasn&rsquo;t depressed and she wasn&rsquo;t taking medicine and she- this makes no sense! This makes no goddamn sense!!&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s yelling now and he&rsquo;s making a scene but he can&rsquo;t help it because this isn&rsquo;t right, it isn&rsquo;t right.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Peter rips his arm away, running back down the hall intent on finding Marisa.</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Hala. Ms. Hala, I need Marisa, where is she? I need to talk to her. Please.&rdquo; the receptionist frowns, glancing at him and then the screen, conflict in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter I&rsquo;m not sure-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Hala <i>please</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>She stares at him a bit longer before acquiescing, looking through the schedules. &ldquo;She should be attending the fourth floor today.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter runs two steps a time yelling Marisa&rsquo;s name. He finds her when she pokes her head out, tears filling her eyes the second she sees him. &ldquo;Oh Peter.&rdquo; her voice wobbles and suddenly he&rsquo;s in her arms. &ldquo;I wanted to find you after I heard but I needed to stay here.&rdquo; </p><p>He pulls away quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; he says, cavalier, &ldquo;Did you hear what they&rsquo;re saying about her? About May?&rdquo; </p><p>She stares at him wide eyed. &ldquo;Peter honey what are you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was she taking anti-depressants?&rdquo; Peter pushes, every part of him pleading.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t- I don&rsquo;t know Peter. I don&rsquo;t know. But they found the bottle in her purse and May&rsquo;s been-&rdquo; pain paints a shadow across her face, &ldquo;May had been acting weird for weeks now. It wouldn&rsquo;t be the most surprising thing.&rdquo;</p><p>The world freezes around him. May <i>had</i> been weird. Evasive, paranoid, scared. She said she had to take care of something. Something important that she couldn&rsquo;t tell Peter. Did she mean this? Her mental health? Depression?? Why wouldn&rsquo;t she have said anything? Why wouldn&rsquo;t she tell <i>him</i>?</p><p>He must&rsquo;ve said it out loud because suddenly Marisa has him in her arms again and she&rsquo;s patting his head. &ldquo;Oh Peter. She probably just didn&rsquo;t want you to worry.&rdquo; </p><p>But that&rsquo;s <i>bullshit</i> and Peter pulls away. &ldquo;No. This isn&rsquo;t right. It isn&rsquo;t right!&rdquo; and he turns in the other direction and runs as fast as he can go. </p><p>He squints as the sunlight pierces through his eyes as he surges out the hospital, fumbling to pull his phone out of his pocket. He calls an Uber and feels clenched right down to his atoms as they drive down the crowded New York city streets. They pull up at his apartment and he storms into it, throwing open his door as though he can find answers where there were none before. He stumbles inside, everything in the apartment hurts him now. Taunts him. Every surface is a memory of May and he can&rsquo;t deal with that right now. </p><p>Not now.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>How was he supposed to move on when everything was wrong?? </p><p>He bursts into May&rsquo;s room, determined to find something to prove- to prove what? Peter stops, his breathing heavy. If May&rsquo;s crash wasn&rsquo;t an accident, then that meant it was a&hellip;Peter shakes. He doesn&rsquo;t know which one is worse. May was a nurse. She saved people for a living. She was kind and funny and witty and down-to-earth and it couldn&rsquo;t be possible&hellip;</p><p>Peter tears apart her room anyway. </p><p>He throws open drawers and rifles through her things and ransacks anything that could hide a secret worth killing over. Finally, he finds it. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a medical file, swiped from the hospital. George Miller. Age seventy-three. Died from heart failure. Ruled: natural causes. It&rsquo;s May&rsquo;s handwriting. Peter knows it. He flips through to the bottom where the previous notes are and finds his brows furrowing. May had combed through her notes, highlighting as she went. George was fine, feeling good that morning. And then died of a heart attack two hours later. </p><p>And that isn&rsquo;t suspicious. People die all of the sudden every day. But May&rsquo;s hand-writing is frantic in the margins <i>WHAT ABOUT THE ISCHEMIA?? WHAT ABOUT THE MARK?? </i>It was underlined four times. </p><p>Peter drops the file, pulling out his phone and googling everything he didn&rsquo;t know. Ischemia: reduced blood flow preventing the heart from receiving oxygen. A severe blockage of one of the heart&rsquo;s arteries that can lead to a heart attack. Peter squints, so then it <i>was </i>natural. </p><p>Peter flips back in May&rsquo;s notes, where she&rsquo;s highlighted the epinephrine dose over and over. Something connecting in the back of his mind, he googles ischemia ephinephrine and is bombarded by academic journal after academic journal detailing the link in adrenaline causing ischemia&hellip;and leaving that distinctive mark. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for the epinephrine given <i>after</i> the heart attack to save the man to cause the ischemia. There would have had to be more of the drug in his blood for to it have that lethal effect. That means-</p><p>Peter falls to the floor. </p><p>George Miller was murdered. And May had figured it out. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you it wasn&rsquo;t an accident!&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s yelling in the middle of the NYPD seventh precinct and twelve hours ago he would have died at the thought, but he can&rsquo;t be stopped now.</p><p>The detective, Rogers, he thinks, tries to drop a comforting hand on his shoulder but Peter shirks back, glaring. &ldquo;Son. I know it&rsquo;s hard when a loved one dies but we did all the checks-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You evidently didn&rsquo;t- if you had, you would have seen this!&rdquo; Peter waves the file in Rogers&rsquo; face but the man doesn&rsquo;t lose his cool, just keeps giving him that same placating face.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. There&rsquo;s nothing we can do.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter can hear the door to the captain&rsquo;s office open and close shut and hopes he isn&rsquo;t going to kick him out. But Peter has to keep trying. He has to. The only thing keeping the grief that threatens to consume him whole and leave nothing at all is his mission to bring his aunt justice. &ldquo;What do you mean there&rsquo;s nothing you can do? It says so right in the file! George Miller was murdered and it looked like an accident because the epinephrine that killed him got disguised by the epinephrine the doctors used to resuscitate him!&rdquo; </p><p>Rogers narrows his eyes, his arms unclenching from where they were crossed at his chest and Peter thinks finally he&rsquo;s gotten through to him when the file is snatched from his hand by someone behind him. Peter whirls around, gaping at a man with the most chiseled goatee, skimming over the file, lips pursed. &ldquo;Your aunt. How did she die?&rdquo; the man says and Peter&rsquo;s too taken aback to tell him he really doesn&rsquo;t have any authority to go asking questions.</p><p>&ldquo;A car accident.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you think someone tampered with the car?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Someone put a bottle of anti-depressants in her purse- um, bu-&rdquo; he frowns.</p><p>&ldquo;Bupropion.&rdquo; The man supplies.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;that. They said she took too many of the pills and she had a seizure in the car so she lost control. And then she-&rdquo; Peter trails off, just looking at the man, expression saying it all. </p><p>The man frowns, lip tugging in sympathy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry kid. But if it makes you feel any better, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes widen. His heart hammers in his throat. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p><p>The goatee guy snaps the file shut, staring him right in the eye. &ldquo;The man, Miller, he was murdered.&rdquo; </p><p>Rogers stands up, &ldquo;Stark you really think it&rsquo;s a good idea to say that to him right now?&rdquo; </p><p>The man- Stark- tilts his head like a challenge, &ldquo;Say what? The truth?&rdquo; he looks back at Peter, completely ignoring the detective, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your case. I&rsquo;m waiting for some DNA evidence anyway. You have school or something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;N-no sir.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Great. Then you can come with me to the hospital. Fill me in on absolutely everything you know. Even the smallest detail could be important.&rdquo;</p><p>The man turns abruptly, speed-walking out of the bullpen and Peter jumps to match his pace. &ldquo;Wait. Are you a detective here?&rdquo;</p><p>The man curls his nose. &ldquo;God no. I&rsquo;m a consultant.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s expression scrunches. &ldquo;So like&hellip;you consult on crime?&rdquo;</p><p>The man sighs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m what they call the department&rsquo;s last resort. A tricky case no one has the handle on? They call me.&rdquo; he glances at Peter from the corner of his eye. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;ll see the show soon enough. But for now, all you need to know is that I&rsquo;m Tony Stark. And I&rsquo;m going to catch whoever did this to your aunt.&rdquo;</p></p>",

But when new evidence comes to light proving foul play, no one in the NYPD will give Peter the time of day.</p>\n<p>No one that is, except genius consulting detective on probation, Tony Stark. But Tony has his own demons to fight. Struggling to maintain his sobriety after a tragedy in London forced him overseas, Tony learns that what mends hearts might not be at the bottom of a bottle but something like a string of unsolved murders and perhaps even love. <br /></p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19031392/chapters/45200047#main\" target=\"_blank\">AO3 Link</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ndash;o00o&ndash;</p>\n<p>Fury stares him down, his one eye tunneling through his words to grasp at his intentions. Tony sits very still. Back straight. Attentive. Not shirking away from the intensity that threatens to reveal him whole. </p>\n<p>Fury stares some more, then cracks a grin and leans back into his chair. &ldquo;Tony Stark.&rdquo; he drawls, &ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d see you again.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Tony quirks his brows. &ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d come to this side of the world either.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>The blare of honking drivers and the faint thrum of the subway reverberate in the New York City air. Tony breathes through it, his hyper-sensitivity forces the scratching of Officer Blair&rsquo;s Lotto card from the next room into his ear-drums, he hears the sound of two copiers churning out the contents of police files, a woman laughing into the phone. The NYPD&rsquo;s seventh precinct has never once been quiet, but the cacophony of it all suits Captain Nick Fury just fine. </p>\n<p>Tony thinks he could get used to it. </p>\n<p>Fury&rsquo;s tone says relax, but Tony&rsquo;s in the lion&rsquo;s den and he isn&rsquo;t one to forget it. &ldquo;You staying here for the next while?&rdquo; Fury asks, hands clasped over the desk. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Permanently.&rdquo; Tony says immediately. </p>\n<p>Unconsciously, his fingers grip into the handles of his chair. Fury&rsquo;s eyes dart to his tense knuckles but they&rsquo;re back on his face just as quickly. &ldquo;Okay. Anything I need to know about?&rdquo; he stares at him meaningfully but Tony doesn&rsquo;t take the bait. </p>\n<p>His jaw tightens. &ldquo;Nothing you haven&rsquo;t already snooped out.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s foot starts shaking, something antsy crawling all over him. &ldquo;Are we done yet? With all this have my daughter home my eight stuff or can we get to what&rsquo;s actually important?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Fury almost looks amused. &ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Tony stands up, plants both hands on his desk. &ldquo;The case.&rdquo; </p>\n<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Peter! Have you seen my keys? They&rsquo;re not on the thing!&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Twisting his lip, Peter pauses mid-bite. &ldquo;I think&hellip;maybe&hellip;wait didn&rsquo;t you put them in your jacket yesterday?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>May smacks a hand to her forehead groaning. Peter snickers into his cereal, &ldquo;Peter make sure you always put your stuff back in the same place.&rdquo; he mimics, laughing at her half-hearted glare.</p>\n<p>Hands on her hips, May tries to look stern but she can&rsquo;t help but laugh, &ldquo;Way to kick a girl when she&rsquo;s down Pete.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Peter flashes a cheeky grin before May runs back into her bedroom, pulling out her spring jacket and digging into the pockets with a quick, &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; before rushing back to him.</p>\n<p>All at once, the light-heartedness in her eyes fades and something haunted clouds the brown of her eyes. May looks at him for a moment, imperceptibly biting her lip before taking three steps towards him and pulling him in for a tight hug. &ldquo;May?&rdquo; his fingers grip the back of her shirt.</p>\n<p>He feels her take a deep breath from where she&rsquo;s pressed against his shoulder before she pulls away slowly. &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo; he asks again, gentler this time.</p>\n<p>Her smile is small, but she brushes the hair from his eyes like she&rsquo;s done a thousand times before and Peter has the strangest feeling that he should be trying to memorize this moment. &ldquo;Nothing sweetie. I just really love you, you know that?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Peter smiles, a little wary, a little touched, &ldquo;Yeah. I love you too May.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>She smiles at him again and he watches her leave to work with questions in his eyes. &ldquo;Are you coming back at seven today?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Earlier probably.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s something weird in how she says it, but Peter can&rsquo;t put his finger on it. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ok great! I&rsquo;ll make some pasta or something and we can eat together.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>May shoots him a grateful smile before waving her goodbyes. The door clicks shut behind her and Peter finds himself faltering in the silence. May was usually an open book, but today- not just today- the past while&hellip;she&rsquo;d been keeping something back. Not hiding, just&hellip;keeping. He&rsquo;d ask her about it tonight. Whatever it was, maybe he could help her. Or at least try. </p>\n<p>Resolved, Peter quickly washes his dishes and grabs his backpack. School first, then Decathalon practice, and then May. Yeah, that sounds good. He has all the time in the world. </p>\n</p>",

Thank you.\u201d He politely replied, beginning to smooth the nonexistent wrinkles from his clothing before he looked back at Harley; giving him a stern look. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be scheduling a fitting for a new suit for you on Thursday, and you better show up Harley Keener-Stark or so help me.\u201d He said, frustration and exasperation coloring his words. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Harley smirked. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I <i>do</i> love it when you get bossy, Mr. Parker.\u201d He flirted teasingly, relishing in the pink hue that rose on the assistant\u2019s cheeks. He knew the blush was most likely from aggravation; but Harley liked to think that it was because of his flirting. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter fixed his boss with one last <i>look</i> before he swiftly stepping out of the office and letting the door close behind himself gently. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0_______</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Peter reached the penthouse of the tower, he was greeted by a babbling two-year old Morgan Stark-Potts and her little robot-pet that Mr. Stark-Potts created for her first birthday. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Picking the toddler up and handing her the toy, Peter made his way toward the kitchen where Mrs. Stark-Potts was bent over some paperwork on the island. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter cleared his throat, causing her to look up. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite the stress that life had put on her; Mrs. Stark-Potts looked as though she hadn\u2019t aged since it was announced to the media that Tony Stark had made her CEO of Stark Industries almost twenty years before. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With Morgan perched on his hip, Peter made his way toward the island and began looking over some of the papers Mrs. Stark-Potts was signing and reading over. She made room for him to stand beside her so he could read with her while Morgan began playing her her necklace from her spot in Peter\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Many of the documents were related to the legal process of handing Stark Industries down to Harley; and a few were pending contracts with other technology moguls around the country. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter picked up one of the contracts with Oscorp\u2019s logo stamped in bold letters on the top and he began reading through it carefully. Mrs. Stark-Potts noticed what he was holding and spoke. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTony thinks it\u2019s an awful idea; and so does Harley,\u201d She sighs before continuing; \u201cbut with the release of their new line of phones in a few weeks, it would put them almost neck-and-neck with SI, and if we can stay ahead of them, then it could be a good advantage for Harley when we announce his inheritance next week at the gala.\u201d Peter inwardly winced. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He still had yet to convince Harley to go to a gala organized in <i>his honor</i>. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd, how is planning for the gala coming along? Any word from the organizer?\u201d Mrs. Stark-Potts asked suddenly and Peter straightened.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s going well, they\u2019ve set up the catering and ordered the floral arrangements. They have it all ready to be set up in the ballroom.\u201d He replied easily.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mrs. Stark-Potts smiled approvingly before taking her daughter from him easily. \u201cIf you can just make copies of all of these and send them to Legal, then you can go home if you\u2019d like.\u201d She asked him, and Peter nodded eagerly. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had a paper he\u2019d only gotten halfway finished that was due at midnight that night and he could really use all the time he could get. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you, Mrs. Stark-Potts.\u201d He said earnestly, beginning to clip the papers together. \u201cI&rsquo;ve told you before, call me Pepper.\u201d She laughed as Peter made his way down the hall and Morgan waved her little arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBuh-bye Pe\u2019er!\u201d Her little voice followed him into the elevator, causing him to smile.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 _________</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 <i><b>11:37 pm</b></i>. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter had been writing his paper since he had gotten home from work at about 2:30 that afternoon, and he\u2019d been in his and his friends\u2019 Discord call since about 5:15. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ned had been quiet for about an hour, and Peter knew he was probably working on a new Lego set since he was smart and already finished his assignments, and MJ and Flash were playing online UNO and screaming at one another when they pissed each other off. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter would say a sentence he wasn\u2019t sure about from his paper and receive feedback from one of the three on the call and then he would get quiet again, and all his friends heard from him was his typing. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter submitted his paper at 11:56 and he sighed in relief, the stress draining from his body. Man, college was hard. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFinally loser, we thought you were going to miss the deadline. <i>Again</i>.\u201d MJ snarked through the call and Peter snorted. \u201cIs it too late to drop out and become a male stripper?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flash scoffed. \u201cNo, but you wouldn\u2019t do well. You\u2019re too pale and skinny. People want big, muscular guys. Not twinks.

You need to just snatch your happily ever after and stop being a bitchy, bisexual dwarf.\u201d MJ said as Flash laughed. \u201cHoly <i>shit</i>, that\u2019s gonna be your name in my phone from now on!\u201d He said between laughs and Peter rolled his eyes. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou guys suck.

Harley was his boss, and sure he flirted with him from time to time, it didn\u2019t mean anything. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Harley flirted with <i>everyone</i>, so much so, that people compared him to Tony Stark back during his party days.

You\u2019ve set an unreachable standard!\u201d He protested petulantly. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter rubbed his temples, attempting to assuage the oncoming headache he felt when FRIDAY chimed in from the ceiling, announcing herself with the gentle tinkling of bells; something she\u2019d done since Morgan Stark-Potts was brought home and FRIDAY\u2019s sudden voice kept startling the newborn infant. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>Mr. Parker, Mrs. Stark-Potts requests your assistance in the penthouse.</i>\u201d The AI stated, \u201c<i>Would you like me to inform her that you are on your way?</i>\u201d She requested helpfully. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When Peter applied to become Mrs. Stark-Potts\u2019 personal assistant, \u00a0he hadn\u2019t expected to become Harley Keener-Stark\u2019s personal assistant only six months after he was hired when Mrs. Stark-Potts decided to retire when she learned that she was pregnant. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Soon, instead of becoming the personal assistant to just the CEO of Stark Industries, he somehow became the personal assistant to everyone in the Stark-Potts-Keener family. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter nodded even though the AI couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cYes, Please FRIDAY. Thank you.\u201d He politely replied, beginning to smooth the nonexistent wrinkles from his clothing before he looked back at Harley; giving him a stern look. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be scheduling a fitting for a new suit for you on Thursday, and you better show up Harley Keener-Stark or so help me.\u201d He said, frustration and exasperation coloring his words. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Harley smirked. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I <i>do</i> love it when you get bossy, Mr. Parker.\u201d He flirted teasingly, relishing in the pink hue that rose on the assistant\u2019s cheeks. He knew the blush was most likely from aggravation; but Harley liked to think that it was because of his flirting. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter fixed his boss with one last <i>look</i> before he swiftly stepping out of the office and letting the door close behind himself gently. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0_______</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Peter reached the penthouse of the tower, he was greeted by a babbling two-year old Morgan Stark-Potts and her little robot-pet that Mr. Stark-Potts created for her first birthday. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Picking the toddler up and handing her the toy, Peter made his way toward the kitchen where Mrs. Stark-Potts was bent over some paperwork on the island. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter cleared his throat, causing her to look up. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite the stress that life had put on her; Mrs. Stark-Potts looked as though she hadn\u2019t aged since it was announced to the media that Tony Stark had made her CEO of Stark Industries almost twenty years before. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With Morgan perched on his hip, Peter made his way toward the island and began looking over some of the papers Mrs. Stark-Potts was signing and reading over. She made room for him to stand beside her so he could read with her while Morgan began playing her her necklace from her spot in Peter\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Many of the documents were related to the legal process of handing Stark Industries down to Harley; and a few were pending contracts with other technology moguls around the country. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter picked up one of the contracts with Oscorp\u2019s logo stamped in bold letters on the top and he began reading through it carefully. Mrs. Stark-Potts noticed what he was holding and spoke. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTony thinks it\u2019s an awful idea; and so does Harley,\u201d She sighs before continuing; \u201cbut with the release of their new line of phones in a few weeks, it would put them almost neck-and-neck with SI, and if we can stay ahead of them, then it could be a good advantage for Harley when we announce his inheritance next week at the gala.\u201d Peter inwardly winced. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He still had yet to convince Harley to go to a gala organized in <i>his honor</i>. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd, how is planning for the gala coming along? Any word from the organizer?\u201d Mrs. Stark-Potts asked suddenly and Peter straightened.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s going well, they\u2019ve set up the catering and ordered the floral arrangements. They have it all ready to be set up in the ballroom.\u201d He replied easily.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mrs. Stark-Potts smiled approvingly before taking her daughter from him easily. \u201cIf you can just make copies of all of these and send them to Legal, then you can go home if you\u2019d like.\u201d She asked him, and Peter nodded eagerly. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had a paper he\u2019d only gotten halfway finished that was due at midnight that night and he could really use all the time he could get. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you, Mrs. Stark-Potts.\u201d He said earnestly, beginning to clip the papers together. \u201cI\u2019ve told you before, call me Pepper.\u201d She laughed as Peter made his way down the hall and Morgan waved her little arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBuh-bye Pe\u2019er!\u201d Her little voice followed him into the elevator, causing him to smile.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 _________</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 <i><b>11:37 pm</b></i>. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter had been writing his paper since he had gotten home from work at about 2:30 that afternoon, and he\u2019d been in his and his friends\u2019 Discord call since about 5:15. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ned had been quiet for about an hour, and Peter knew he was probably working on a new Lego set since he was smart and already finished his assignments, and MJ and Flash were playing online UNO and screaming at one another when they pissed each other off. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter would say a sentence he wasn\u2019t sure about from his paper and receive feedback from one of the three on the call and then he would get quiet again, and all his friends heard from him was his typing. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter submitted his paper at 11:56 and he sighed in relief, the stress draining from his body. Man, college was hard. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFinally loser, we thought you were going to miss the deadline. <i>Again</i>.\u201d MJ snarked through the call and Peter snorted. \u201cIs it too late to drop out and become a male stripper?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flash scoffed. \u201cNo, but you wouldn\u2019t do well. You\u2019re too pale and skinny. People want big, muscular guys. Not twinks. You\u2019d be better off killing yourself with work than that.\u201d MJ laughed and Peter vaguely heard Ned snort. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what other people want, not when Peter\u2019s got his rich-ass boss wrapped around his finger and he doesn\u2019t even realize it.\u201d Ned said, and Peter groaned. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh my God, guys not this again.

        "body": "<p>(an AU short story about what I think Peter telling Tony his origin story would be like)</p><p><b></b></p><p>Tony woke up in a cold sweat. He saw some light coming out from the crack in the bedroom door and realized someone was awake. Trying not to wake Pepper, who came to the Compound to manage the property for the weekend, Tony slowly slid out from the sheets and tiptoed to the door. Quietly, he turned the knob and opened the door slightly. He breathed a sigh of relief. It was just Peter, sitting on the living room couch, eating Pop Tarts from the large crate they had stored in the kitchen, which sat next to him. He then realized that something wasn\u2019t right, and quietly snuck up on him. Peter swiftly turned around and grabbed both of Tony\u2019s arms, but then let them go, realizing it wasn\u2019t dangerous. Tony knew that wouldn&rsquo;t work because Peter\u2019s heightened senses allowed him to sense oncoming threats or scares. He softly chuckled. \u201cHey, kid.\u201d He plopped down on the couch next to him, and rummaged through the Pop Tart crate, finally finding a frosted strawberry pack. He ripped it open and offered one to Peter. \u201cNo thanks, Mr. Stark. I\u2019m not in the mood for strawberry,\u201d he said. Peter miserably took a large bite of the chocolate fudge one he was holding. He sighed and said, \u201cSorry about your Pop Tart supply. I need to eat 10,000 calories a day to maintain my metabolism, and I skipped dinner.\u201d Tony realized that Peter had been crying, evidenced by his red eyes and a small pile of tissues he was trying to conceal underneath the mound of Pop Tart wrappers. He rubbed his back and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Looks like you\u2019re stress-eating, and trust me, I know what that looks like. So, tell me, why are you mowing through my Pop Tart crate?\u201d Peter slouched and looked at the crumbs on his hands. \u201cYesterday was Uncle Ben\u2019s birthday, and&hellip;I missed it. I always bring a gift for May, but today I was out on my \u2018Stark Internship\u2019, so I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u201d Tony knew everything about Peter, except for this \u201cUncle Ben\u201d that he kept mentioning. He decided to let down his walls of ego, and ask for once, \u201cWho\u2019s Uncle Ben? You\u2019ve never told me about him.\u201d Peter sat up and eagerly looked at him. He realized that something had sparked in the kid. Peter took a deep breath and said, \u201cUncle Ben was&hellip;well&hellip;my uncle, as well as May\u2019s husband. When my parents died, they took care of me. I was specifically close to him because he raised me to be the person that I am today, with good morals and life lessons that made me more mature. When I first got my powers, I decided to try them out in a wrestling ring. I won the match, but that same night, my uncle was shot&hellip;by a rogue robber.\u201d Peter started to tear up. Tony realized that he needed to console him, be the father figure in this situation. He pulled Peter closer to his chest, and he comfortably snuggled. He continued, \u201cThat day was when I needed to realize that my powers were meant to be used for good and that my uncle needed to be avenged. So, after a long time of investigating, I caught the robber that killed my uncle. I decided to follow one of my uncle\u2019s best lessons: \u2018With great power comes great responsibility.\u2019 That was the day that I took up the mantle of Spider-Man. That is my origin story. Since his death, May and I celebrate his birthday every year to remember him. So, I got really emotional when I missed the celebration.\u201d Tony felt horrible that this high schooler has gone through so much at such a young age. \u201cY\u2019know, kid, I was in university when my parents died. I didn\u2019t love them enough to say goodbye to them before they left for the last time. I had no one else, so my butler and my selection of nannies took care of me. You, on the other hand, lost so much at such a young age. You\u2019re just a kid. I know how it feels to not properly grieve, but it\u2019s okay. You loved him enough to remember him, fight for him, cry for him. So you can rest knowing that you\u2019ll always celebrate ol\u2019 Uncle Ben.\u201d Peter wiped the dripping tears from his face and blew into a tissue. For the first time in 20 minutes, he grinned at Tony and suddenly lurched close for a tight hug. He was surprised, but then put his arms around Peter and rubbed his back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, kid. I know.\u201d Peter let go after a few minutes and stood up from the couch. \u201cThanks, Mr. Stark. That really helped.\u201d He then hastily gathered all the wrappers and the tissues and hurried over to the trash can. Tony whispered, \u201cFriday, what\u2019s the time right now?\u201d Friday whispered back through his smartwatch, \u201cIt\u2019s 4:45 a.m. right now, with the weather at 28 degrees, cloudy.\u201d Tony turned around and saw Peter trying to push all the snack crates back in without messing them up. He then got up and looked back at him, questioning, \u201cMr. Stark? What\u2019s wrong? Did I do something?\u201d Tony faked a disapproving look and replied, \u201cWow, staying up \u2018till almost 5 a.m.? Save it for your finals. You\u2019ll need it then. Now go get some rest. The \u2018internship\u2019 isn\u2019t over yet!\u201d Peter chuckled and \u201cwalked\u201d back to his room by climbing on the ceiling. Tony thought it was kinda creepy without the suit, but he never pointed it out. He then realized that Pepper would panic if he wasn\u2019t next to her, so he snuck back into the bedroom and slipped into the sheets. He stared at the ceiling for a while, but his growing cloud of thoughts was interrupted by a voice. \u201cSo, what did he tell you?\u201d Tony looked around the room, but no one was there. The voice said, \u201cLook to you right.\u201d He looked right and saw Pepper was awake. \u201cWh-why aren\u2019t you asleep? It\u2019s 5 a.m., and work starts at 6,\u201d he said. She replied, \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday tomorrow, so I thought I\u2019d sleep in. Anyways, what did Peter say?\u201d Tony explained everything, in detail. Pepper intently listened, staring at him as he talked. After the explanation, Tony said, \u201cThe kid\u2019s been through a lot, but I didn\u2019t think that it was this serious. He\u2019s lost two father figures, his actual father, and his uncle, who he trusted would be there to raise him.\u201d Pepper sighed. \u201cMake sure he doesn\u2019t lose a third.\u201d She turned over and fell asleep. Tony thought about that for a moment and settled in, sleeping contently. He now had another reason to wake up in the morning, another responsibility&hellip;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <i><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</b></i></p><p><i><b>The End</b></i></p><p>(it may be cringe, so sorry if it is, but I really like to write stories and thought that this situation was perfect to tell)</p>",

He saw some light coming out from the crack in the bedroom door and realized someone was awake. Trying not to wake Pepper, who came to the Compound to manage the property for the weekend, Tony slowly slid out from the sheets and tiptoed to the door. Quietly, he turned the knob and opened the door slightly. He breathed a sigh of relief. It was just Peter, sitting on the living room couch, eating Pop Tarts from the large crate they had stored in the kitchen, which sat next to him. He then realized that something wasn\u2019t right, and quietly snuck up on him. Peter swiftly turned around and grabbed both of Tony\u2019s arms, but then let them go, realizing it wasn\u2019t dangerous. Tony knew that wouldn\u2019t work because Peter\u2019s heightened senses allowed him to sense oncoming threats or scares. He softly chuckled. \u201cHey, kid.\u201d He plopped down on the couch next to him, and rummaged through the Pop Tart crate, finally finding a frosted strawberry pack. He ripped it open and offered one to Peter. \u201cNo thanks, Mr. Stark. I\u2019m not in the mood for strawberry,\u201d he said. Peter miserably took a large bite of the chocolate fudge one he was holding. He sighed and said, \u201cSorry about your Pop Tart supply. I need to eat 10,000 calories a day to maintain my metabolism, and I skipped dinner.\u201d Tony realized that Peter had been crying, evidenced by his red eyes and a small pile of tissues he was trying to conceal underneath the mound of Pop Tart wrappers. He rubbed his back and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Looks like you\u2019re stress-eating, and trust me, I know what that looks like. So, tell me, why are you mowing through my Pop Tart crate?\u201d Peter slouched and looked at the crumbs on his hands. \u201cYesterday was Uncle Ben\u2019s birthday, and\u2026I missed it. I always bring a gift for May, but today I was out on my \u2018Stark Internship\u2019, so I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u201d Tony knew everything about Peter, except for this \u201cUncle Ben\u201d that he kept mentioning. He decided to let down his walls of ego, and ask for once, \u201cWho\u2019s Uncle Ben? You\u2019ve never told me about him.\u201d Peter sat up and eagerly looked at him. He realized that something had sparked in the kid. Peter took a deep breath and said, \u201cUncle Ben was\u2026well\u2026my uncle, as well as May\u2019s husband. When my parents died, they took care of me. I was specifically close to him because he raised me to be the person that I am today, with good morals and life lessons that made me more mature. When I first got my powers, I decided to try them out in a wrestling ring. I won the match, but that same night, my uncle was shot\u2026by a rogue robber.\u201d Peter started to tear up. Tony realized that he needed to console him, be the father figure in this situation. He pulled Peter closer to his chest, and he comfortably snuggled. He continued, \u201cThat day was when I needed to realize that my powers were meant to be used for good and that my uncle needed to be avenged. So, after a long time of investigating, I caught the robber that killed my uncle. I decided to follow one of my uncle\u2019s best lessons: \u2018With great power comes great responsibility.\u2019 That was the day that I took up the mantle of Spider-Man. That is my origin story. Since his death, May and I celebrate his birthday every year to remember him. So, I got really emotional when I missed the celebration.\u201d Tony felt horrible that this high schooler has gone through so much at such a young age. \u201cY\u2019know, kid, I was in university when my parents died. I didn\u2019t love them enough to say goodbye to them before they left for the last time. I had no one else, so my butler and my selection of nannies took care of me. You, on the other hand, lost so much at such a young age. You\u2019re just a kid. I know how it feels to not properly grieve, but it\u2019s okay. You loved him enough to remember him, fight for him, cry for him. So you can rest knowing that you\u2019ll always celebrate ol\u2019 Uncle Ben.\u201d Peter wiped the dripping tears from his face and blew into a tissue. For the first time in 20 minutes, he grinned at Tony and suddenly lurched close for a tight hug. He was surprised, but then put his arms around Peter and rubbed his back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, kid. I know.\u201d Peter let go after a few minutes and stood up from the couch. \u201cThanks, Mr. Stark. That really helped.\u201d He then hastily gathered all the wrappers and the tissues and hurried over to the trash can. Tony whispered, \u201cFriday, what\u2019s the time right now?\u201d Friday whispered back through his smartwatch, \u201cIt\u2019s 4:45 a.m. right now, with the weather at 28 degrees, cloudy.\u201d Tony turned around and saw Peter trying to push all the snack crates back in without messing them up. He then got up and looked back at him, questioning, \u201cMr. Stark? What\u2019s wrong? Did I do something?\u201d Tony faked a disapproving look and replied, \u201cWow, staying up \u2018till almost 5 a.m.? Save it for your finals. You\u2019ll need it then. Now go get some rest. The \u2018internship\u2019 isn\u2019t over yet!\u201d Peter chuckled and \u201cwalked\u201d back to his room by climbing on the ceiling. Tony thought it was kinda creepy without the suit, but he never pointed it out. He then realized that Pepper would panic if he wasn\u2019t next to her, so he snuck back into the bedroom and slipped into the sheets. He stared at the ceiling for a while, but his growing cloud of thoughts was interrupted by a voice. \u201cSo, what did he tell you?\u201d Tony looked around the room, but no one was there. The voice said, \u201cLook to you right.\u201d He looked right and saw Pepper was awake. \u201cWh-why aren\u2019t you asleep? It\u2019s 5 a.m., and work starts at 6,\u201d he said. She replied, \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday tomorrow, so I thought I\u2019d sleep in. Anyways, what did Peter say?\u201d Tony explained everything, in detail. Pepper intently listened, staring at him as he talked. After the explanation, Tony said, \u201cThe kid\u2019s been through a lot, but I didn\u2019t think that it was this serious. He\u2019s lost two father figures, his actual father, and his uncle, who he trusted would be there to raise him.\u201d Pepper sighed. \u201cMake sure he doesn\u2019t lose a third.\u201d She turned over and fell asleep. Tony thought about that for a moment and settled in, sleeping contently. He now had another reason to wake up in the morning, another responsibility\u2026\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <i><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</b></i></p><p><i><b>The End</b></i></p><p>(it may be cringe, so sorry if it is, but I really like to write stories and thought that this situation was perfect to tell)</p>",
