        "answer": "<p>Actually <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmT78uw-xgcu3VRO6fuRGWA\">@tjswings</a> talked about this in a post yesterday that I really liked. I bookmarked it because I planned on adding my thoughts today, but I guess I\u2019ll just do that here since you\u2019ve given me an opportunity. Here\u2019s the link to that post though:\u00a0<a href=\"http://tjswings.tumblr.com/post/183019524108/thoughtsdiscourse-on-the-new-jonah-plot-a-lot-of\">http://tjswings.tumblr.com/post/183019524108/thoughtsdiscourse-on-the-new-jonah-plot-a-lot-of</a>\u00a0</p><p>So first of all, I agree with both of you (anon and Sarah) in that this storyline has been poorly executed. It really goes to show that even though Jonah has been a member of the main cast since the first episode, they really never got the hang of treating him as such. I\u2019ve talked about this before - that in the first season it was a stylistic choice because we were seeing his character from the point of view of the GHC, and how since then we have started to see him as a more well-rounded human character. And I really expected for season 3 to finally do a good job at helping us see him as clearly as we see the other three main kids - but this is a pretty huge step back in that progress.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>I don\u2019t necessarily think the problem is what they did do (like the skateboard thing, which I will touch on more in a bit), but there is definitely a problem what they didn\u2019t do. It wouldn\u2019t have been hard to show signs of this storyline somewhere between episodes 2 and 12. They had ten full episodes where they could have snuck in subtle hints that we only would have noticed in hindsight. They could have made it clear that he was hungrier than usual, especially at the moon festival or the shiva. They could have shown him get uncomfortable at the mention of his father during I Got Your Number. They could have shown him be a little uncomfortable when it came to going to The Color Factory, or renting the canoes. They could have tied it into his panic attack in a way that gave the audience an understanding of what was happening. They could have had him casually mention that he\u2019s broke, like Amber did when she stayed the night at Andi\u2019s. Or at the very least they could have had him say something in the texts.</p><p>I know they are going to explore it further, and I\u2019m really excited to see that, and I think the new episode was still really well done - but it feels like they missed an opportunity to make it better. As much as people like to claim that they never touch on Cyrus\u2019 sexuality storyline, we were getting subtle hints towards that from the very beginning of the series. Cyrus fangirling over Jonah, his insecurity about being called girly, the look on his face when Iris said that he\u2019s uncomplicated, his reminder to Andi that kisses can mean a lot of things and he knows because of his kiss with Iris\u2026 there were subtle hints sprinkled in between the big moments. But unfortunately, with Jonah\u2019s storylines, we haven\u2019t gotten that as much. With both the anxiety storyline, and now his family\u2019s financial troubles, they\u2019ve fallen flat and it\u2019s just a shame. I still LOVE the storylines and I think the writers are incredible, I just think there was more to do that would have made these stories have a heavier impact. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m still holding out hope that they will be tied together in a really productive way before the end of the season - but I guess we\u2019ll just have to see.\u00a0</p><p>Now - writing flaws aside - back to your original point: The skateboard. I\u2019m not going to actually try to defend the writers in this situation because like I said, it is messy and inconsistent. However, in terms of what is happening in-universe, I don\u2019t think that the skateboard thing is actually all that unrealistic. There are a lot of misconceptions around what it means to be poor, and one of the most common ones is that people think that poor people either can\u2019t have or don\u2019t deserve nice things. I\u2019ve mentioned on here before, I am poor and I grew up pretty poor\u2026 but I still found ways to make money and do the things I wanted to do. I still went to dozens of concerts when I was in high school. I went to theme parks with friends. I went to the movies or out to eat sometimes. I bought junk that I wanted. I almost always had a computer. Part of this was because my grandma would always find a way to get us the things we needed or wanted, even if it meant selling her jewelry from when she was younger or something like that. Eventually we became poor enough to where that was no longer an option, but I still found money to do things. I would sell <i>my </i>belongings on ebay. I would save up money from holidays and birthdays. I would have yard sales. I used to skip lunch and save up my lunch money to buy concert tickets. And because I was a teenager, I wasn\u2019t burdened with the responsibility of my family\u2019s financial struggles. Sure, they couldn\u2019t afford to give me any extra money - but they never expected <i>me </i>to give them <i>my </i>money either. So that meant that when I did have extra money, it could go towards fun things like going out to eat or concert tickets or in Jonah\u2019s case - a skateboard. And it\u2019s a shame that we won\u2019t see any sort of explanation for that on screen, because it\u2019s important to teach people that poverty looks different on different people. Just because your friend has nice things, doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t also poor. And just because your friend is poor, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t deserve nice things. It\u2019s actually incredibly important for poor people to have these nice things, because being poor can be hard and sometimes we need a fucking break and to just be allowed to do something that makes us happy.\u00a0</p><p>Even the idea of him giving his old skateboard to Buffy doesn\u2019t go against the poor thing to me. It was him being nice, like he always is, and he also was able to give himself a rational excuse to spend money on a new one - which is something I do constantly. I have to make excuses for myself to spend money so I don\u2019t feel guilty afterward. And while selling it to Buffy would have certainly made more sense if they had wanted to tie it into this storyline, it is what it is. Jonah\u2019s the type of guy who would give you the shirt off his back. It actually reminds me of this story I\u2019ve always been told about how my grandma, who also grew up poor, one time traded shoes with a girl she went to school with and she got in trouble when she got home because they had to save up for those shoes in the first place. Obviously not exactly the same but yeah. Just a note of what it personally reminds me of.</p><p>But overall - I agree with the fact that these stories are falling short, and it\u2019s a real shame because I do respect the writers of this show a lot. It feels weird that we never got to see Amber\u2019s storyline like this fully play out, and that they circled back around with Jonah, and then used it to push together some separate drama involving both of them. There\u2019s still a lot of potential for both characters and their storylines over the last 9 episode so I\u2019m holding out hope that it will be done well, but I totally understand the frustrations with the way they chose to reveal this issue.\u00a0</p><p>Jonah is a main character, and Amber has been on the series since the first episode - yet they haven\u2019t done either of them justice. And like I said, I\u2019m holding out hope that since they managed to tie their two storylines together, no matter how messy the execution, that it means they\u2019re actually gong to address them in a satisfying way but at this point, there\u2019s no telling what will happen next. It\u2019s just wild to me that TJ has had such satisfying and linear character development over the course of 14 episodes while Jonah and Amber have been put on the back burner. But overall, I\u2019m not one to criticize a storyline before I see it completed so I\u2019m not ~angry~ about what\u2019s happening right now by any means. I just wanna see where it goes, and then I\u2019ll form a more cohesive opinion.\u00a0</p>",

Or at the very least they could have had him say something in the texts.</p><p>I know they are going to explore it further, and I\u2019m really excited to see that, and I think the new episode was still really well done - but it feels like they missed an opportunity to make it better. As much as people like to claim that they never touch on Cyrus\u2019 sexuality storyline, we were getting subtle hints towards that from the very beginning of the series. Cyrus fangirling over Jonah, his insecurity about being called girly, the look on his face when Iris said that he\u2019s uncomplicated, his reminder to Andi that kisses can mean a lot of things and he knows because of his kiss with Iris\u2026 there were subtle hints sprinkled in between the big moments. But unfortunately, with Jonah\u2019s storylines, we haven\u2019t gotten that as much. With both the anxiety storyline, and now his family\u2019s financial troubles, they\u2019ve fallen flat and it\u2019s just a shame. I still LOVE the storylines and I think the writers are incredible, I just think there was more to do that would have made these stories have a heavier impact. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m still holding out hope that they will be tied together in a really productive way before the end of the season - but I guess we\u2019ll just have to see.\u00a0</p><p>Now - writing flaws aside - back to your original point: The skateboard. I\u2019m not going to actually try to defend the writers in this situation because like I said, it is messy and inconsistent. However, in terms of what is happening in-universe, I don\u2019t think that the skateboard thing is actually all that unrealistic. There are a lot of misconceptions around what it means to be poor, and one of the most common ones is that people think that poor people either can\u2019t have or don\u2019t deserve nice things. I\u2019ve mentioned on here before, I am poor and I grew up pretty poor\u2026 but I still found ways to make money and do the things I wanted to do. I still went to dozens of concerts when I was in high school. I went to theme parks with friends. I went to the movies or out to eat sometimes. I bought junk that I wanted. I almost always had a computer. Part of this was because my grandma would always find a way to get us the things we needed or wanted, even if it meant selling her jewelry from when she was younger or something like that. Eventually we became poor enough to where that was no longer an option, but I still found money to do things. I would sell <i>my </i>belongings on ebay. I would save up money from holidays and birthdays. I would have yard sales. I used to skip lunch and save up my lunch money to buy concert tickets. And because I was a teenager, I wasn\u2019t burdened with the responsibility of my family\u2019s financial struggles. Sure, they couldn\u2019t afford to give me any extra money - but they never expected <i>me </i>to give them <i>my </i>money either. So that meant that when I did have extra money, it could go towards fun things like going out to eat or concert tickets or in Jonah\u2019s case - a skateboard. And it\u2019s a shame that we won\u2019t see any sort of explanation for that on screen, because it\u2019s important to teach people that poverty looks different on different people. Just because your friend has nice things, doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t also poor. And just because your friend is poor, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t deserve nice things. It\u2019s actually incredibly important for poor people to have these nice things, because being poor can be hard and sometimes we need a fucking break and to just be allowed to do something that makes us happy.\u00a0</p><p>Even the idea of him giving his old skateboard to Buffy doesn\u2019t go against the poor thing to me. It was him being nice, like he always is, and he also was able to give himself a rational excuse to spend money on a new one - which is something I do constantly. I have to make excuses for myself to spend money so I don\u2019t feel guilty afterward. And while selling it to Buffy would have certainly made more sense if they had wanted to tie it into this storyline, it is what it is. Jonah\u2019s the type of guy who would give you the shirt off his back. It actually reminds me of this story I\u2019ve always been told about how my grandma, who also grew up poor, one time traded shoes with a girl she went to school with and she got in trouble when she got home because they had to save up for those shoes in the first place. Obviously not exactly the same but yeah. Just a note of what it personally reminds me of.</p><p>But overall - I agree with the fact that these stories are falling short, and it\u2019s a real shame because I do respect the writers of this show a lot. It feels weird that we never got to see Amber\u2019s storyline like this fully play out, and that they circled back around with Jonah, and then used it to push together some separate drama involving both of them. There\u2019s still a lot of potential for both characters and their storylines over the last 9 episode so I\u2019m holding out hope that it will be done well, but I totally understand the frustrations with the way they chose to reveal this issue.\u00a0</p><p>Jonah is a main character, and Amber has been on the series since the first episode - yet they haven\u2019t done either of them justice. And like I said, I\u2019m holding out hope that since they managed to tie their two storylines together, no matter how messy the execution, that it means they\u2019re actually gong to address them in a satisfying way but at this point, there\u2019s no telling what will happen next. It\u2019s just wild to me that TJ has had such satisfying and linear character development over the course of 14 episodes while Jonah and Amber have been put on the back burner. But overall, I\u2019m not one to criticize a storyline before I see it completed so I\u2019m not ~angry~ about what\u2019s happening right now by any means. I just wanna see where it goes, and then I\u2019ll form a more cohesive opinion.\u00a0</p>",

Here\u2019s the link to that post though:\u00a0<a href=\"http://tjswings.tumblr.com/post/183019524108/thoughtsdiscourse-on-the-new-jonah-plot-a-lot-of\">http://tjswings.tumblr.com/post/183019524108/thoughtsdiscourse-on-the-new-jonah-plot-a-lot-of</a>\u00a0</p><p>So first of all, I agree with both of you (anon and Sarah) in that this storyline has been poorly executed. It really goes to show that even though Jonah has been a member of the main cast since the first episode, they really never got the hang of treating him as such. I\u2019ve talked about this before - that in the first season it was a stylistic choice because we were seeing his character from the point of view of the GHC, and how since then we have started to see him as a more well-rounded human character. And I really expected for season 3 to finally do a good job at helping us see him as clearly as we see the other three main kids - but this is a pretty huge step back in that progress.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>I don\u2019t necessarily think the problem is what they did do (like the skateboard thing, which I will touch on more in a bit), but there is definitely a problem what they didn\u2019t do. It wouldn\u2019t have been hard to show signs of this storyline somewhere between episodes 2 and 12. They had ten full episodes where they could have snuck in subtle hints that we only would have noticed in hindsight. They could have made it clear that he was hungrier than usual, especially at the moon festival or the shiva. They could have shown him get uncomfortable at the mention of his father during I Got Your Number. They could have shown him be a little uncomfortable when it came to going to The Color Factory, or renting the canoes. They could have tied it into his panic attack in a way that gave the audience an understanding of what was happening.

So Cyrus tells TJ and they do separate costumes. Now they both already have the salt and pepper costumes, they&rsquo;re just not gonna wear them. The school for the basketball team has t-shirts for people who want to participate in costume day but have no costumes. So that automatically makes TJ and Kira match. </p><p>Andi finds out that Cyrus wants to match with TJ and she lets him, Cyrus then finds TJ so they both change into there matching costumes and take a picture together for (probably spirit week.)</p><h1>There! Drama avoided!</h1></p>",
