Neville had had sex with someone.\nNeville who, not so long ago was waltzing on its own after the Yule ball was\ngoing to have a <i>baby</i>.

I talked to Professor McGonnagal before summer and that\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019m only studying herbology ten hours a day, six days out of seven. Once I\nhave my NEWT I have a job at a flower shop. It won\u2019t be easy, but my granny\nisn\u2019t pleased with the new and hasn\u2019t planned on helping me financially. She\nsaid she\u2019ll help me with the practical things such as how to change a diaper\nand how to hold a baby but I need money to feed the baby and buy said diaper\nand so I need a job and</p><p>-Neville Neville stop please!\nYou\u2019re going to die if you don\u2019t breath!</p><p>-It\u2019s a little bit overwhelming.</p><p>-A little bit, yeah.

                "content": "<p><h1>Why I&rsquo;m kind of okay with Remus&rsquo; death</h1><p>Okay, just to clearify, I am not at all okay with Remus dying (he is my favourite character after all), nor am I okay with a bunch of other wonderful characters being killed off, but just hear me out, okay?</p><p>When JKR apologized for Remus&rsquo; death on the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, she said that the reason for killing him was that she did not want Harry to have more than one good father figure. Initially, Arthur was supposed to die in OotP by the snake attack, but she could not manage killing him, which meant that if Remus did not die later on, Harry would end up with two father figures.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, of course I want Arthur to live, but if his death would mean that Remus lived&hellip;? As much as I don&rsquo;t want to admit it, I would probably choose Remus over Arthur if I was only considering which character I like better&hellip;</p><p>But the thing is that while Remus is a character I care more deeply about than Arthur, I believe that Arthur&rsquo;s death would be much worse than Remus&rsquo;. One of the very saddest deaths in the HP series is Fred, because there was so many people left to mourn him and miss him, and especially George. Now imagine Fred&rsquo;s death, but two years before that, the Weasley&rsquo;s had lost their father. This is just too much for me to take, and if Remus&rsquo; death is the price I have to pay for the Weasley family not to break apart any more, then I guess I can live with that.&nbsp;</p><p>I know this is all kind of random and maybe confusing i don&rsquo;t know, but just remember this whenever you feel sad about Remus dying. Remember that if he hadn&rsquo;t died, Arthur would have died instead, and that combined with Fred&rsquo;s death would tear the Weasley family apart. </p></p>",
