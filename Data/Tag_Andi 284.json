        "answer": "<p>When Walker gets introduced, Andi and Jonah are not dating. At that point, Andi knows Jonah has maybe sorta kinda possibly liked her but doesn\u2019t want to be her boyfriend. She had just told Jonah she\u2019s over being so conflicted and wants to be free of the drama. And when Jonah does finally say he wants to be her bf, we get to see Andi feel conflicted about Jonah vs. Walker. She gets to express herself to both of them. And she would\u2019ve had that opportunity regardless of Jonah\u2019s reciprocity. So I think it still very valid to compare the two. </p><p>Even if Jonah doesn\u2019t like Cyrus back, Cyrus is never allowed the opportunity to express how he feels in order to find out. Or even come out in general to Jonah to gauge his reaction. Cyrus commiserates with Andi in 2x13 about their Jonah conflict, and then it\u2019s promptly tucked away again until he magically no longer has a crush. </p><p>LGBT children have equally as complex and valid feelings and crushes as straight children (if not more so complex tbh, because there\u2019s often times that extra layer of acceptance they have to get to first). They can have feelings and crushes on multiple people just like straight children. And they can express those feelings to the person, regardless of the outcome.</p><p>But Cyrus gets so pigeonholed in a way that none of the (as far as we know) straight characters on the show do, and it\u2019s sad. </p><p>While I think it\u2019s stereotypical to have the one gay friend be the one to get rejected by their first crush, I would honestly take that if it meant Cyrus got to express himself and go through a real emotional arc, instead of just out of the blue being like \u201cmy crush is gone lol nbd\u201d</p>",

(background wandi and muffy)</p></blockquote><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ll make sure that Andi doesn\u2019t get to The Spoon until I text you that everything is set up?\u201d Walker asked, eyes wide. \u201cThis is important.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I got this. Your promposal is going to go off without a hitch.\u201d </p><p>Walker grinned. \u201cGreat, thanks. You\u2019re the best.\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>Cyrus reciprocated Walker\u2019s smile, \u201cI know.\u201d Walker continued to ramble about his promposal plans as they walked towards the cafeteria for lunch, but Cyrus tuned him out. He\u2019d heard the whole thing several times already, but Walker was (needlessly) nervous. He wanted to do something big for Andi, as if she wouldn\u2019t say yes no matter how he asked. She\u2019d been talking about senior prom since the eight grade. She\u2019d definitely appreciate the big ask from her perfect, thoughtful boyfriend, though, and Cyrus was probably going to be hearing about it until college. \u00a0</p><p>Not that Cyrus wasn\u2019t happy for Andi, but it was a bittersweet situation. Cyrus desperately wished he could have a promposal like that. Sure, he and Jonah were probably going to go together, but Cyrus would bet all his leftover Hanukkah money from Grandma Goodman, that Jonah would tell people outside their friend group that it was \u201cjust as friends\u201d and that he\u2019d spend half the night dancing with random girls instead of Cyrus. He tried not to resent Jonah for it, he knew that it was hard for Jonah, that he hated the idea of people seeing him differently. He was out to his close friends and to his parents, but most of the school was completely unaware that Jonah Beck was bisexual, let alone that he had been dating Cyrus Goodman for the better part of a year. </p><p>Cyrus wanted to shout from the rooftops that Jonah was his boyfriend.
