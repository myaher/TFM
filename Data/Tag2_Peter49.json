When he fishes it out and reads it&rsquo;s a call from Karen, his heartbeat instantly picks up; after all, it took Tony only a handful of weeks after meeting the kid to learn that when it comes to him and calls in the middle of the night, most of the time it&rsquo;s a wise thing to expect the worst.<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Karen, cancel call! Cancel call! Cancel\u2013</i>\u201d </p><p>There it is. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>ca\u2013 oh heeey, Mr. Stark</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren, run his vitals for me,\u201d he says without a beat of hesitation, not even bothering to ask Peter directly \u2013 he knows the kid will just try to avoid the question.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Peter&rsquo;s vitals are currently normal and stable</i>,&rdquo; Karen supplies helpfully. &ldquo;<i>However, you&rsquo;ve been called since it is past his curfew, and the Bedtime Protocol has been activated.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Seriously</i>?&rdquo; comes Peter offended voice from the background, and it becomes louder as Karen&rsquo;s voice drowns out. &ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s not</i> that<i> late</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost two in the morning, you have to be up at seven and you have a quiz tomorrow,&rdquo; Tony scolds, wishing the kid was able to see his glare through the phone call. &ldquo;What are you doing in the suit at this hour?&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a beat of silence, but then Peter admits quietly, &ldquo;<i>I couldn&rsquo;t sleep</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighs. &ldquo;Are you at least at home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;<i>Kinda? I&rsquo;m on the roof.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t sleep for real or are you just coming back from patrol? Because I can check the footage right-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m serious!</i>&rdquo; Peter exclaims. &ldquo;<i>It was, like, ten o'clock when I went to bed. I was exhausted, seriously. But then I- well, it took me a while to fall asleep and then when I did I had this really, um, weird dream and now I can&rsquo;t</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pete,&rdquo; Tony interrupts, but gently. &ldquo;Are you having nightmares?&rdquo;</p><p>The other line goes silent for a few moments again, but Tony lets him have his time. He looks around when there&rsquo;s a sudden noise coming from the door, but when he turns around it&rsquo;s just Pepper coming in, carrying her closed book on one of her hands. He mouths <i>Peter</i> and she instantly smiles and nods knowingly, but frowns slightly when she checks the time on her wrist watch. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Yeah</i>,&rdquo; Peter finally admits, and Tony hears a tiny sigh. &ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s mostly about the battle - you know. The loud noises of the explosions and - and stuff</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s heart clenches in sympathy - sometimes he forgets that Peter is only sixteen despite the time that has passed for him and the ones who remained after The Snap; he forgets that Peter was in the middle of that mess when the guy&rsquo;s intergalactical army starting shooting down at them with the intention to kill, and that Peter had been caught in the middle of it all and could&rsquo;ve easily ended up among their deceased fighters even though he had just came back-</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the last time you&rsquo;ve slept properly?&rdquo; he asks, quickly shaking the thoughts away before they can start spiralling. Peter is here and alive, so there isn&rsquo;t use dwelling with the past - he only has to fix what&rsquo;s wrong in the present, and right now, it seems like what he needs to do is get to his kid and reassure him that everything is fine despite what his head is telling him.</p><p>Pepper, as always, catches up on the situation soon enough. She approaches Tony to stand right in front of him and run a gentle hand from the top of his head down to his nape. <i>You should go to him</i>, she whispers. He nods.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Probably sometime last week</i>?&rdquo; Peter says, then quickly regrets, &ldquo;<i>But it- it&rsquo;s getting better, I swear! There&rsquo;s no need to worry, I&rsquo;ll be fine, I&rsquo;ll try to go to bed now and sleep, I&rsquo;m sorry Karen had to bother you when you must&rsquo;ve been getting ready to sleep-</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not fooling anyone, kiddo,&rdquo; Tony sighs, only half fond - the kid is a bad liar to the point of being concerning.</p><p>He kisses Pepper on the cheek and chastely promises to be back soon as he moves quickly around the lab; soon enough the suit is spawning for his chest to enclose his body, and he&rsquo;s exiting through the back door of the house and into the chilly night sky.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Mr. Stark</i>?&rdquo; comes Peter&rsquo;s quiet voice from the still connected call. &ldquo;<i>You still there?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sorry,&rdquo; he says, setting the course straight to Queens right away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there soon, yeah? Hold on tight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>W-Wait, what? You&rsquo;re coming? You really don&rsquo;t need-</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to go through this alone, Pete, and I know you haven&rsquo;t been telling May,&rdquo; he says, but it&rsquo;s not an accusation. He just wants Pete to know that even if he&rsquo;s not ready to share with his Aunt what he went through just yet, Tony will be there to make sure he&rsquo;s fine until then.</p><p>\u201c<i>It\u2019s just\u2013</i>\u201d Peter starts, then interrupts himself. A few more seconds of silence, and then, \u201c<i>How long</i>?\u201d he asks quietly. </p><p>Tony smiles a bit to himself, then quickly checks the stats on his display. \u201cThirteen minutes. You good until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yeah</i>,\u201d Peter mumbles. \u201c<i>Thank you, Mr. Stark. You\u2013 you really didn\u2019t have to</i>\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, kiddo,\u201d he replies, urging the suit to move faster. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>xx</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s indeed sitting on the roof by the time Tony arrives - the place is completely deserted and quite dirty, but the kid is sitting near the edge, arms wrapped around his legs and face resting on top of his knees. He looks up when Tony lands besides him but doesn&rsquo;t move, only offers him a timid smile in greeting.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he says quietly. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey yourself,&rdquo; Tony replies, lowering himself down to sit besides Peter with a small groan. Damn, he&rsquo;s really getting old. &ldquo;Any progress?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still exhausted,&rdquo; Peter shrugs, looking away. &ldquo;Still kinda scared of going to sleep, though.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighs, taking a moment to really look at Peter; the boy has deep and dark eyebags, which definitely weren&rsquo;t there - or weren&rsquo;t as bad, at least - the last time they saw each other in person. His eyes are also a bit puffy and red - he&rsquo;s been crying. </p><p>&ldquo;What are we working with here?&rdquo; Tony asks, voice lowered down almost to a whisper as if to not disturb the quiet atmosphere that has been settled ever since he arrived. &ldquo;You&hellip; said it was something to do with explosions?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods reluctantly. &ldquo;Yeah, you- you know. When they started shooting down at us,&rdquo; he starts, focusing on the suit&rsquo;s mask on his hands rather than Tony&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I- I had the gauntlet with me when it started and- and, um, I think most of those things were aiming at me. I thought- I w-was sure they were going to get me then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Tony says, wrapping a hand around Peter&rsquo;s shoulders - the boy is shaking under his hold. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s something hard to digest. When- well, after New York, after I got through that hole and came back, I kept dreaming about it. I was pretty sure I was going to die then; I even tried calling Pepper, but she didn&rsquo;t pick up at that time.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter finally turns to look at him, eyes shining under the city&rsquo;s lights. He stays quiet, knowing that the story doesn&rsquo;t end there.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought it was going to resolve itself eventually, if I kept avoiding the memories,&rdquo; he continues, giving Peter a pointed look. &ldquo;Like you probably do right now. And you might be right - but you also might not, and it might get worse. That&rsquo;s what happened to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What- What did you do?&rdquo; Peter inquires softly.</p><p>&ldquo;I started therapy,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Believe me, that wasn&rsquo;t an easy decision. It took Pepper and Rhodes a really long time to convince me, because I thought that wouldn&rsquo;t change anything. I couldn&rsquo;t see how talking to a stranger would make me feel better about these- fucked up things I had gone through.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods, looking away again quietly. Fortunately, he looks thoughtful, and is not flinching away from the idea right away like Tony thought he would do. </p><p>&ldquo;D-Do you think it&rsquo;d work? For- for me?&rdquo; he finally asks, turning around to stare at Tony with teary eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Pete,&rdquo; Tony breathes, reaching up to run through a hand through Peter&rsquo;s head before landing it on his shoulder again. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing to try, of course it will. Talking about it with those around you, like we&rsquo;re doing right now, will also make it better, but I think professional help is never too much. I can set you up with the one who helped me back then, what you say? She still helps me even now and then, when I need it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods at the suggestion, almost frenetically. &ldquo;P-Please,&rdquo; he says, raising a fist to wipe away a tear that manages to escape and run down his cheek. &ldquo;If- If you&rsquo;re saying it helps, then I will- I will talk to May first, &lsquo;c-cause I don&rsquo;t know if we can-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cover the expenses, kiddo,&rdquo; Tony reassures him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry your Aunt about that, I&rsquo;ll have a chat with her. Okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony knows Peter would usually complain about it, but the kid only nods which is just another indicator of how exhausted he is. He opens and closes his mouth a few times as if to say something else, but his face ends up scrunching up and he all at once breaks down in tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, it&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Tony pulls him in for a hug as soon as he starts sobbing, the sound being muffled against his jacket. &ldquo;You will get better, hm? I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m just s-so <i>tired</i>,&rdquo; Peter manages to say in between sobs while barely managing to breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, Pete. Trust me, I know,&rdquo; Tony soothes him, feeling his heart break at the sound of the kid&rsquo;s devastated sobs. He would do anything to take the pain away, to make Peter forget everything he&rsquo;s been through - the countless night he himself spent awake, trying everything to forget all that trauma, are still vivid in his memories and he would never wish something similar to the boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you make it better. You- you can count on me, buddy.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter keeps on sobbing but manages to nod against Tony&rsquo;s jacket, looping his arms around the man&rsquo;s torso, a silent plea for him not to let go. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t even need to ask - Tony isn&rsquo;t planning on doing so anytime soon.</p>",

When he fishes it out and reads it\u2019s a call from Karen, his heartbeat instantly picks up; after all, it took Tony only a handful of weeks after meeting the kid to learn that when it comes to him and calls in the middle of the night, most of the time it\u2019s a wise thing to expect the worst.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Karen, cancel call!

Because I can check the footage right-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m serious!</i>\u201d Peter exclaims. \u201c<i>It was, like, ten o'clock when I went to bed. I was exhausted, seriously. But then I- well, it took me a while to fall asleep and then when I did I had this really, um, weird dream and now I can\u2019t</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete,\u201d Tony interrupts, but gently. \u201cAre you having nightmares?\u201d</p><p>The other line goes silent for a few moments again, but Tony lets him have his time. He looks around when there\u2019s a sudden noise coming from the door, but when he turns around it\u2019s just Pepper coming in, carrying her closed book on one of her hands. He mouths <i>Peter</i> and she instantly smiles and nods knowingly, but frowns slightly when she checks the time on her wrist watch. </p><p>\u201c<i>Yeah</i>,\u201d Peter finally admits, and Tony hears a tiny sigh. \u201c<i>It\u2019s mostly about the battle - you know. The loud noises of the explosions and - and stuff</i>.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart clenches in sympathy - sometimes he forgets that Peter is only sixteen despite the time that has passed for him and the ones who remained after The Snap; he forgets that Peter was in the middle of that mess when the guy\u2019s intergalactical army starting shooting down at them with the intention to kill, and that Peter had been caught in the middle of it all and could\u2019ve easily ended up among their deceased fighters even though he had just came back-</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve slept properly?\u201d he asks, quickly shaking the thoughts away before they can start spiralling. Peter is here and alive, so there isn\u2019t use dwelling with the past - he only has to fix what\u2019s wrong in the present, and right now, it seems like what he needs to do is get to his kid and reassure him that everything is fine despite what his head is telling him.</p><p>Pepper, as always, catches up on the situation soon enough. She approaches Tony to stand right in front of him and run a gentle hand from the top of his head down to his nape. <i>You should go to him</i>, she whispers. He nods.</p><p>\u201c<i>Probably sometime last week</i>?\u201d Peter says, then quickly regrets, \u201c<i>But it- it\u2019s getting better, I swear! There\u2019s no need to worry, I\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019ll try to go to bed now and sleep, I\u2019m sorry Karen had to bother you when you must\u2019ve been getting ready to sleep-</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fooling anyone, kiddo,\u201d Tony sighs, only half fond - the kid is a bad liar to the point of being concerning.</p><p>He kisses Pepper on the cheek and chastely promises to be back soon as he moves quickly around the lab; soon enough the suit is spawning for his chest to enclose his body, and he\u2019s exiting through the back door of the house and into the chilly night sky.</p><p>\u201c<i>Mr. Stark</i>?\u201d comes Peter\u2019s quiet voice from the still connected call. \u201c<i>You still there?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d he says, setting the course straight to Queens right away. \u201cI\u2019ll be there soon, yeah?

But then I- well, it took me a while to fall asleep and then when I did I had this really, um, weird dream and now I can\u2019t</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete,\u201d Tony interrupts, but gently. \u201cAre you having nightmares?\u201d</p><p>The other line goes silent for a few moments again, but Tony lets him have his time. He looks around when there\u2019s a sudden noise coming from the door, but when he turns around it\u2019s just Pepper coming in, carrying her closed book on one of her hands. He mouths <i>Peter</i> and she instantly smiles and nods knowingly, but frowns slightly when she checks the time on her wrist watch. </p><p>\u201c<i>Yeah</i>,\u201d Peter finally admits, and Tony hears a tiny sigh. \u201c<i>It\u2019s mostly about the battle - you know. The loud noises of the explosions and - and stuff</i>.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart clenches in sympathy - sometimes he forgets that Peter is only sixteen despite the time that has passed for him and the ones who remained after The Snap; he forgets that Peter was in the middle of that mess when the guy\u2019s intergalactical army starting shooting down at them with the intention to kill, and that Peter had been caught in the middle of it all and could\u2019ve easily ended up among their deceased fighters even though he had just came back-</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve slept properly?\u201d he asks, quickly shaking the thoughts away before they can start spiralling. Peter is here and alive, so there isn\u2019t use dwelling with the past - he only has to fix what\u2019s wrong in the present, and right now, it seems like what he needs to do is get to his kid and reassure him that everything is fine despite what his head is telling him.</p><p>Pepper, as always, catches up on the situation soon enough. She approaches Tony to stand right in front of him and run a gentle hand from the top of his head down to his nape. <i>You should go to him</i>, she whispers. He nods.</p><p>\u201c<i>Probably sometime last week</i>?\u201d Peter says, then quickly regrets, \u201c<i>But it- it\u2019s getting better, I swear! There\u2019s no need to worry, I\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019ll try to go to bed now and sleep, I\u2019m sorry Karen had to bother you when you must\u2019ve been getting ready to sleep-</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fooling anyone, kiddo,\u201d Tony sighs, only half fond - the kid is a bad liar to the point of being concerning.</p><p>He kisses Pepper on the cheek and chastely promises to be back soon as he moves quickly around the lab; soon enough the suit is spawning for his chest to enclose his body, and he\u2019s exiting through the back door of the house and into the chilly night sky.</p><p>\u201c<i>Mr. Stark</i>?\u201d comes Peter\u2019s quiet voice from the still connected call. \u201c<i>You still there?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d he says, setting the course straight to Queens right away. \u201cI\u2019ll be there soon, yeah? Hold on tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>W-Wait, what? You\u2019re coming? You really don\u2019t need-</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go through this alone, Pete, and I know you haven\u2019t been telling May,\u201d he says, but it\u2019s not an accusation. He just wants Pete to know that even if he\u2019s not ready to share with his Aunt what he went through just yet, Tony will be there to make sure he\u2019s fine until then.</p><p>\u201c<i>It\u2019s just\u2013</i>\u201d Peter starts, then interrupts himself. A few more seconds of silence, and then, \u201c<i>How long</i>?\u201d he asks quietly. </p><p>Tony smiles a bit to himself, then quickly checks the stats on his display. \u201cThirteen minutes. You good until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yeah</i>,\u201d Peter mumbles. \u201c<i>Thank you, Mr. Stark. You\u2013 you really didn\u2019t have to</i>\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, kiddo,\u201d he replies, urging the suit to move faster. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>xx</p><p>Peter\u2019s indeed sitting on the roof by the time Tony arrives - the place is completely deserted and quite dirty, but the kid is sitting near the edge, arms wrapped around his legs and face resting on top of his knees. He looks up when Tony lands besides him but doesn\u2019t move, only offers him a timid smile in greeting.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says quietly. </p><p>\u201cHey yourself,\u201d Tony replies, lowering himself down to sit besides Peter with a small groan. Damn, he\u2019s really getting old. \u201cAny progress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still exhausted,\u201d Peter shrugs, looking away. \u201cStill kinda scared of going to sleep, though.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighs, taking a moment to really look at Peter; the boy has deep and dark eyebags, which definitely weren\u2019t there - or weren\u2019t as bad, at least - the last time they saw each other in person. His eyes are also a bit puffy and red - he\u2019s been crying. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we working with here?\u201d Tony asks, voice lowered down almost to a whisper as if to not disturb the quiet atmosphere that has been settled ever since he arrived. \u201cYou\u2026 said it was something to do with explosions?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods reluctantly. \u201cYeah, you- you know. When they started shooting down at us,\u201d he starts, focusing on the suit\u2019s mask on his hands rather than Tony\u2019s face. \u201cI- I had the gauntlet with me when it started and- and, um, I think most of those things were aiming at me. I thought- I w-was sure they were going to get me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they didn\u2019t,\u201d Tony says, wrapping a hand around Peter\u2019s shoulders - the boy is shaking under his hold. \u201cI know it\u2019s something hard to digest. When- well, after New York, after I got through that hole and came back, I kept dreaming about it. I was pretty sure I was going to die then; I even tried calling Pepper, but she didn\u2019t pick up at that time.\u201d</p><p>Peter finally turns to look at him, eyes shining under the city\u2019s lights. He stays quiet, knowing that the story doesn\u2019t end there.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was going to resolve itself eventually, if I kept avoiding the memories,\u201d he continues, giving Peter a pointed look. \u201cLike you probably do right now. And you might be right - but you also might not, and it might get worse. That\u2019s what happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat- What did you do?\u201d Peter inquires softly.</p><p>\u201cI started therapy,\u201d he says. \u201cBelieve me, that wasn\u2019t an easy decision. It took Pepper and Rhodes a really long time to convince me, because I thought that wouldn\u2019t change anything. I couldn\u2019t see how talking to a stranger would make me feel better about these- fucked up things I had gone through.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods, looking away again quietly. Fortunately, he looks thoughtful, and is not flinching away from the idea right away like Tony thought he would do. </p><p>\u201cD-Do you think it\u2019d work? For- for me?\u201d he finally asks, turning around to stare at Tony with teary eyes. </p><p>\u201cOh, Pete,\u201d Tony breathes, reaching up to run through a hand through Peter\u2019s head before landing it on his shoulder again. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to try, of course it will. Talking about it with those around you, like we\u2019re doing right now, will also make it better, but I think professional help is never too much. I can set you up with the one who helped me back then, what you say? She still helps me even now and then, when I need it.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods at the suggestion, almost frenetically. \u201cP-Please,\u201d he says, raising a fist to wipe away a tear that manages to escape and run down his cheek. \u201cIf- If you\u2019re saying it helps, then I will- I will talk to May first, \u2018c-cause I don\u2019t know if we can-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cover the expenses, kiddo,\u201d Tony reassures him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry your Aunt about that, I\u2019ll have a chat with her. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Tony knows Peter would usually complain about it, but the kid only nods which is just another indicator of how exhausted he is. He opens and closes his mouth a few times as if to say something else, but his face ends up scrunching up and he all at once breaks down in tears.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s alright,\u201d Tony pulls him in for a hug as soon as he starts sobbing, the sound being muffled against his jacket. \u201cYou will get better, hm? I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m just s-so <i>tired</i>,\u201d Peter manages to say in between sobs while barely managing to breathe.</p><p>\u201cI know, Pete. Trust me, I know,\u201d Tony soothes him, feeling his heart break at the sound of the kid\u2019s devastated sobs. He would do anything to take the pain away, to make Peter forget everything he\u2019s been through - the countless night he himself spent awake, trying everything to forget all that trauma, are still vivid in his memories and he would never wish something similar to the boy. \u201cI\u2019ll help you make it better. You- you can count on me, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Peter keeps on sobbing but manages to nod against Tony\u2019s jacket, looping his arms around the man\u2019s torso, a silent plea for him not to let go. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t even need to ask - Tony isn\u2019t planning on doing so anytime soon.</p></p>",

When he fishes it out and reads it&rsquo;s a call from Karen, his heartbeat instantly picks up; after all, it took Tony only a handful of weeks after meeting the kid to learn that when it comes to him and calls in the middle of the night, most of the time it&rsquo;s a wise thing to expect the worst.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Karen, cancel call!

Sort of endgame spoiler for certain things but nothing big. </p><p>\u201cThank you so much. Every phone number you could possibly need is on the fridge. 8 o\u2019clock bed time because she\u2019ll be cranking if she doesn\u2019t sleep right. You can order food. Make sure you add vegetables.\u201d </p><p><!-- more --></p><p>\u201cTony, they got it. And DumE is right there too,\u201d Pepper reminded Tony. He laughed a little and nodded. \u201cMorgan, we\u2019ll be home late so listen to the boys and go to sleep on time,\u201d Pepper said bending to kiss little Morgan on the cheek. The girl nodded importantly. </p><p>Tony bent to a crouch and opened his arms. Morgan quickly hugged him tightly. \u201cDo you love me 3000?\u201d Morgan looked with a wicked smile and shook her head. Tony faked shock. \u201cHow much?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh&hellip; 73 thousand hundred,\u201d she said. Tony laughed. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so much more! Pepper did you hear that? 73 thousand hundred. I haven\u2019t even heard of that number it\u2019s so big,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cJust like her daddy. Good at math. But seriously, we have to go if we\u2019re going to make our reservation,\u201d Peoper reminded him. </p><p>\u201cI think I could persuade them-\u201c he said before stopping at her look. Best to not teach Morgan to think like that. \u201cOkay lets go,\u201d he said before another round of hugs and leaving. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the kids watching me?\u201d She asked looking at them critically after the door shut.  Peter pulled away and Harley glared back. The two stared for a while. \u201cI like him,\u201d Morgan finally said. \u201cPlay chess with me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNaw. This nerd was on the chess team. He\u2019ll do it,\u201d Harley said grabbing an apple. Peter stuttered softly before pulling out the board. </p><p>A half hour later the scene was tense. Harley stood leaning on the table, gazing at the board. Peter was literally sweating as he too gazed at the board. Morgan stared at her pieces for a minute before pushing a piece. She looked up triumphantly at the pair. </p><p>\u201cCheck. Mate,\u201d she said grinning widely. </p><p>\u201cYou got beat by a kid. Tough break,\u201d Harley said standing up straight. </p><p>\u201cI was trying my hardest,\u201d Peter said in earnest. Harley laughed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you play her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bored. Make me a grilled cheese,\u201d Morgan said to Harley. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just order-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo crust. And grape juice. I\u2019m going to watch teen titans,\u201d Morgan said walking away. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis is so nice,\u201d Tony said smiling. He rubbed his thumb across the back of Pepper\u2019s hand. She smiled back. A dimly lit restaurant, drinking red wine, nibbling on exorbitantly expensive appetizers as a dish that was definitely not diet approved was prepared in the kitchen sounded perfect to Pepper. Tony was safe and happy and not wearing his iron man suit. The way he looked at Pepper was overwhelmingly intimate; like she was the only thing in the world. </p><p>\u201cI love this place. Who would have known I would want to go here,\u201d Pepper said slyly. Tony shrugged while smirking. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe the note on my computer. And the fridge. And when Morgan told me,\u201d Tony replies. The waiter came by and poured more wine quietly before leaving. \u201cSpeaking of Morgan. How do you think things are going?\u201d </p><p>\u201cProbably really well. They\u2019re good kids.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cTHERE\u2019S SO MUCH FIRE!!\u201d Harley screamed. He wildly swung a hand towel. Morgan shrieked loudly. </p><p>\u201cFire alarm! Where is the distinguisher?!?\u201d Peter yelped running around the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cExtinguisher!\u201d Harley yelled back. </p><p>\u201cNow?!? Now is the time to argue words?\u201d Peter said finally opening the cabinet with the fire extinguisher. He grabbed the device and fired it at the kitchen fire. It put out the fire but also covered Harley in the white fire retardant. The other boy glared at Peter as Morgan touched the smoldering hand towel to Harley\u2019s goopy side to put it out. </p><p>\u201cFire\u2019s out,\u201d Peter said quietly. He reached for paper towels to hand Harley one who simply put up a finger. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Say. A word,\u201d Harley said wiggling the finger. \u201cI\u2019m taking a shower and I will be back. Do. Nothing.\u201d </p><p>Morgan and Peter stood quietly as Harley left the room. </p><p>\u201cHe looked mad,\u201d Morgan said. Peter nodded. Morgan walked towards her room. \u201cI\u2019m going to color.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, good idea. I\u2019m going to watch tv,\u201d Peter said weakly. He had the moral backbone of a chocolate eclair. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cBest chocolate cake in the city. And I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve tried them all. Remember when you made me drive out to get some in the middle of the night. It\u2019s a good thing I know the chef,\u201d Tony said smiling while boasting. </p><p>\u201cI do remember that. I was 8 and half months pregnant. Had to have it. Glad you were there,\u201d Pepper answered as he pulled a smile from her face. They were holding hands across the table. Tony had a little color to his skin and his smiled looked genuine. </p><p>\u201cYeah. Me too,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky, you know? I\u2019m not suppose to get happy endings. Wife. Kid. Love the kid. She\u2019s great,\u201d Tony said. He got that way sometime. Seen a different timeline where this wasn\u2019t the endgame. Made him nostalgic. </p><p>\u201cJust the kid?\u201d Pepper teased. </p><p>\u201cI mean, she\u2019s super great. Like the best. Her mom is pretty cool too.\u201d Pepper grinned. \u201cThink I should call to check on them?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo. Peter or Harley would call. Don\u2019t be such a worrier. Never thought I\u2019d say that. Tony Stark is too soft to enjoy a date,\u201d Pepper said. </p><p>\u201cToo soft? I can be hard. Do you want me hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony! Not here,\u201d she whispered laughed. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cFriday, how do we get oil paint out of Egyptian cotton,\u201d Peter asked Friday. Morgan smiles nervously. Mr Stark and Ms Stark were going to kill them. Hell Harley was going to kill them. </p><p>\u201cRecommended hand sanitizer mixed with rubbing alcohol rubbed from opposite side of stain,\u201d Friday said. </p><p>\u201cDoes Mr Stark have any?\u201d Peter asked. </p><p>\u201cNo. The highest concentration of alcohol is vodka in the pantry. Chance of success&hellip; 27%.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy do you need vodka?\u201d Harley asked. He wore a tight t shirt and pants that showed part of his ankles. He awkwardly pulled at the pants. Morgan stared at his legs. \u201cWhat? Your dad is short.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThose are mine,\u201d Peter said quietly. \u201cMorgan got paint everywhere and it wasn\u2019t my fault because I was cleaning the kitchen,\u201d Peter said quickly. Harley looked at Peter in a way that could only be described as murder. </p><p>\u201cI was washing off fire extinguisher goo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPropellant,\u201d Morgan corrected. Harley sighed before laughing. A real laugh. An infectious laugh. Peter and Morgan joined in. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s scrub this bed,\u201d Harley said and the small group went to work. Morgan grabbed scrubbing brushes from a closet. Harley grabbed the vodka and Peter started scrubbing. The paint slowly started coming out. </p><p>\u201cWhat is that smell?\u201d Happy Hogan said walking in the room. The distinct smell of alcohol burned his nostrils. He froze at the scene. \u201cDo I even want to know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cScrub,\u201d said Harley handing him a brush. </p><p>\u201cScrub? Does Tony know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoes Tony know,\u201d Peter mocked scrubbing furiously. Maybe the fumes were getting to his brain. Happy uneasily took the brush and started scrubbing. </p><p>\u201cWhere is the love of my life,\u201d Tony said walking in. The group froze. \u201cIs that my $600 bottle of vodka on Morgan\u2019s duvet?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Harley said. Pepper stood with her mouth slightly open. Morgan his behind Peter\u2019s leg. </p><p>\u201cI came in after they started this,\u201d Happy said. </p><p>\u201cI know. After my liquor cabinet sensor went off I checked the camera. A lot happened,\u201d Tony said. \u201cFire, boys? Really? Over grilled cheese?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t cooking,\u201d Peter said quickly. </p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Harley said looking at him betrayed. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re powered. We put it out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s my fault for asking you to watch Morgan. You\u2019re both too young and irresponsible to watch her. We\u2019ll know to hire a sitter-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTony, it\u2019s okay. They did their best and yeah, they will never babysit again, but at least they tried. Why don\u2019t you get Morgan to bed and I\u2019ll take care of this?\u201d Pepper said. Tony nodded and scooped up the waiting little girl. Morgan gripped his cheeks and kissed his nose as they left the room. \u201cHappy, you can go home.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright boys. Let\u2019s get a trash bag for this duvet,\u201d Pepper said. Both boys gawked as Happy left. \u201cWe\u2019ll buy a new one. Morgan is not using a vodka soaked oil painted bed spread.\u201d </p>",

He laughed a little and nodded. \u201cMorgan, we\u2019ll be home late so listen to the boys and go to sleep on time,\u201d Pepper said bending to kiss little Morgan on the cheek. The girl nodded importantly. </p><p>Tony bent to a crouch and opened his arms. Morgan quickly hugged him tightly. \u201cDo you love me 3000?\u201d Morgan looked with a wicked smile and shook her head. Tony faked shock. \u201cHow much?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 73 thousand hundred,\u201d she said. Tony laughed. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so much more! Pepper did you hear that? 73 thousand hundred. I haven\u2019t even heard of that number it\u2019s so big,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cJust like her daddy. Good at math. But seriously, we have to go if we\u2019re going to make our reservation,\u201d Peoper reminded him. </p><p>\u201cI think I could persuade them-\u201c he said before stopping at her look. Best to not teach Morgan to think like that. \u201cOkay lets go,\u201d he said before another round of hugs and leaving. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the kids watching me?\u201d She asked looking at them critically after the door shut.  Peter pulled away and Harley glared back. The two stared for a while. \u201cI like him,\u201d Morgan finally said. \u201cPlay chess with me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNaw. This nerd was on the chess team. He\u2019ll do it,\u201d Harley said grabbing an apple. Peter stuttered softly before pulling out the board. </p><p>A half hour later the scene was tense. Harley stood leaning on the table, gazing at the board. Peter was literally sweating as he too gazed at the board. Morgan stared at her pieces for a minute before pushing a piece. She looked up triumphantly at the pair. </p><p>\u201cCheck. Mate,\u201d she said grinning widely. </p><p>\u201cYou got beat by a kid. Tough break,\u201d Harley said standing up straight. </p><p>\u201cI was trying my hardest,\u201d Peter said in earnest. Harley laughed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you play her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bored.

Sort of endgame spoiler for certain things but nothing big. </p><p>\u201cThank you so much. Every phone number you could possibly need is on the fridge. 8 o\u2019clock bed time because she\u2019ll be cranking if she doesn\u2019t sleep right. You can order food. Make sure you add vegetables.\u201d </p><p>[[MORE]]</p><p>\u201cTony, they got it. And DumE is right there too,\u201d Pepper reminded Tony. He laughed a little and nodded. \u201cMorgan, we\u2019ll be home late so listen to the boys and go to sleep on time,\u201d Pepper said bending to kiss little Morgan on the cheek. The girl nodded importantly. </p><p>Tony bent to a crouch and opened his arms. Morgan quickly hugged him tightly. \u201cDo you love me 3000?\u201d Morgan looked with a wicked smile and shook her head. Tony faked shock. \u201cHow much?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 73 thousand hundred,\u201d she said. Tony laughed. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so much more! Pepper did you hear that? 73 thousand hundred. I haven\u2019t even heard of that number it\u2019s so big,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cJust like her daddy. Good at math. But seriously, we have to go if we\u2019re going to make our reservation,\u201d Peoper reminded him. </p><p>\u201cI think I could persuade them-\u201c he said before stopping at her look. Best to not teach Morgan to think like that. \u201cOkay lets go,\u201d he said before another round of hugs and leaving. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the kids watching me?\u201d She asked looking at them critically after the door shut.  Peter pulled away and Harley glared back. The two stared for a while. \u201cI like him,\u201d Morgan finally said. \u201cPlay chess with me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNaw. This nerd was on the chess team. He\u2019ll do it,\u201d Harley said grabbing an apple. Peter stuttered softly before pulling out the board. </p><p>A half hour later the scene was tense. Harley stood leaning on the table, gazing at the board. Peter was literally sweating as he too gazed at the board. Morgan stared at her pieces for a minute before pushing a piece. She looked up triumphantly at the pair. </p><p>\u201cCheck. Mate,\u201d she said grinning widely. </p><p>\u201cYou got beat by a kid. Tough break,\u201d Harley said standing up straight. </p><p>\u201cI was trying my hardest,\u201d Peter said in earnest. Harley laughed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you play her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bored. Make me a grilled cheese,\u201d Morgan said to Harley. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just order-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo crust. And grape juice. I\u2019m going to watch teen titans,\u201d Morgan said walking away. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis is so nice,\u201d Tony said smiling. He rubbed his thumb across the back of Pepper\u2019s hand. She smiled back. A dimly lit restaurant, drinking red wine, nibbling on exorbitantly expensive appetizers as a dish that was definitely not diet approved was prepared in the kitchen sounded perfect to Pepper. Tony was safe and happy and not wearing his iron man suit. The way he looked at Pepper was overwhelmingly intimate; like she was the only thing in the world. </p><p>\u201cI love this place. Who would have known I would want to go here,\u201d Pepper said slyly. Tony shrugged while smirking. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe the note on my computer. And the fridge. And when Morgan told me,\u201d Tony replies. The waiter came by and poured more wine quietly before leaving. \u201cSpeaking of Morgan. How do you think things are going?\u201d </p><p>\u201cProbably really well. They\u2019re good kids.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cTHERE\u2019S SO MUCH FIRE!!\u201d Harley screamed. He wildly swung a hand towel. Morgan shrieked loudly. </p><p>\u201cFire alarm! Where is the distinguisher?!?\u201d Peter yelped running around the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cExtinguisher!\u201d Harley yelled back. </p><p>\u201cNow?!? Now is the time to argue words?\u201d Peter said finally opening the cabinet with the fire extinguisher. He grabbed the device and fired it at the kitchen fire. It put out the fire but also covered Harley in the white fire retardant. The other boy glared at Peter as Morgan touched the smoldering hand towel to Harley\u2019s goopy side to put it out. </p><p>\u201cFire\u2019s out,\u201d Peter said quietly. He reached for paper towels to hand Harley one who simply put up a finger. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Say. A word,\u201d Harley said wiggling the finger. \u201cI\u2019m taking a shower and I will be back. Do. Nothing.\u201d </p><p>Morgan and Peter stood quietly as Harley left the room. </p><p>\u201cHe looked mad,\u201d Morgan said. Peter nodded. Morgan walked towards her room. \u201cI\u2019m going to color.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, good idea. I\u2019m going to watch tv,\u201d Peter said weakly. He had the moral backbone of a chocolate eclair. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cBest chocolate cake in the city. And I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve tried them all. Remember when you made me drive out to get some in the middle of the night. It\u2019s a good thing I know the chef,\u201d Tony said smiling while boasting. </p><p>\u201cI do remember that. I was 8 and half months pregnant. Had to have it. Glad you were there,\u201d Pepper answered as he pulled a smile from her face. They were holding hands across the table. Tony had a little color to his skin and his smiled looked genuine. </p><p>\u201cYeah. Me too,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky, you know? I\u2019m not suppose to get happy endings. Wife. Kid. Love the kid. She\u2019s great,\u201d Tony said. He got that way sometime. Seen a different timeline where this wasn\u2019t the endgame. Made him nostalgic. </p><p>\u201cJust the kid?\u201d Pepper teased. </p><p>\u201cI mean, she\u2019s super great. Like the best. Her mom is pretty cool too.\u201d Pepper grinned. \u201cThink I should call to check on them?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo. Peter or Harley would call. Don\u2019t be such a worrier. Never thought I\u2019d say that. Tony Stark is too soft to enjoy a date,\u201d Pepper said. </p><p>\u201cToo soft? I can be hard. Do you want me hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony! Not here,\u201d she whispered laughed. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cFriday, how do we get oil paint out of Egyptian cotton,\u201d Peter asked Friday. Morgan smiles nervously. Mr Stark and Ms Stark were going to kill them. Hell Harley was going to kill them. </p><p>\u201cRecommended hand sanitizer mixed with rubbing alcohol rubbed from opposite side of stain,\u201d Friday said. </p><p>\u201cDoes Mr Stark have any?\u201d Peter asked. </p><p>\u201cNo. The highest concentration of alcohol is vodka in the pantry. Chance of success\u2026 27%.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy do you need vodka?\u201d Harley asked. He wore a tight t shirt and pants that showed part of his ankles. He awkwardly pulled at the pants. Morgan stared at his legs. \u201cWhat? Your dad is short.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThose are mine,\u201d Peter said quietly. \u201cMorgan got paint everywhere and it wasn\u2019t my fault because I was cleaning the kitchen,\u201d Peter said quickly. Harley looked at Peter in a way that could only be described as murder. </p><p>\u201cI was washing off fire extinguisher goo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPropellant,\u201d Morgan corrected. Harley sighed before laughing. A real laugh. An infectious laugh. Peter and Morgan joined in. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s scrub this bed,\u201d Harley said and the small group went to work. Morgan grabbed scrubbing brushes from a closet. Harley grabbed the vodka and Peter started scrubbing. The paint slowly started coming out. </p><p>\u201cWhat is that smell?\u201d Happy Hogan said walking in the room. The distinct smell of alcohol burned his nostrils. He froze at the scene. \u201cDo I even want to know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cScrub,\u201d said Harley handing him a brush. </p><p>\u201cScrub? Does Tony know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoes Tony know,\u201d Peter mocked scrubbing furiously. Maybe the fumes were getting to his brain. Happy uneasily took the brush and started scrubbing. </p><p>\u201cWhere is the love of my life,\u201d Tony said walking in. The group froze. \u201cIs that my $600 bottle of vodka on Morgan\u2019s duvet?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Harley said. Pepper stood with her mouth slightly open. Morgan his behind Peter\u2019s leg. </p><p>\u201cI came in after they started this,\u201d Happy said. </p><p>\u201cI know. After my liquor cabinet sensor went off I checked the camera. A lot happened,\u201d Tony said. \u201cFire, boys? Really? Over grilled cheese?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t cooking,\u201d Peter said quickly. </p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Harley said looking at him betrayed. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re powered. We put it out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s my fault for asking you to watch Morgan. You\u2019re both too young and irresponsible to watch her. We\u2019ll know to hire a sitter-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTony, it\u2019s okay. They did their best and yeah, they will never babysit again, but at least they tried. Why don\u2019t you get Morgan to bed and I\u2019ll take care of this?\u201d Pepper said. Tony nodded and scooped up the waiting little girl. Morgan gripped his cheeks and kissed his nose as they left the room. \u201cHappy, you can go home.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright boys. Let\u2019s get a trash bag for this duvet,\u201d Pepper said. Both boys gawked as Happy left. \u201cWe\u2019ll buy a new one. Morgan is not using a vodka soaked oil painted bed spread.\u201d </p></p>",

His arms were hugging his chest as fat tears rolled down his cheeks, leaving silvery trails in their wake before falling down into the dirt. He was shivering almost violently, though he knew it was not because of any drop in temperature. The sight in front of him alone was enough to send him into a frenzy, and it was not failing in doing so now.</p><p>Pepper nodded, biting her bottom lip and heaving a sigh before leaning forward to press a kiss to her husband\u2019s charred forehead. She lingered there for a moment, and Peter almost felt like leaving simply to allow her more time with him\u2026 but denying that he wanted to speak to Tony would be the biggest lie in his entire existence. Pepper slowly got to her feet, eyes never once straying from Tony. He looked so\u2026 broken. So defeated. And yet he had just saved the world.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, Peter.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was so soft, so quiet, that Peter barely noticed she\u2019d spoken to him. He swallowed thickly, turning to look at Pepper and noting the sympathetic gleam in her eyes. She reached out to cup the side of his face, a watery smile veiling her dry lips for just a moment before she dropped her hand and moved past him, sobs becoming all the more audible as Hope and Okoye moved to comfort her.</p><p>He suddenly felt rooted to the spot. No sound was making its way through his ears as Peter stood, legs firmly planted on the ground, arms still locked around his trembling body, except the almost deafening pumping of his heart. His breaths were coming in short gasps, and his vision was getting blurrier by the second.</p><p>And then he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Peter.\u201d Those words spilled from Tony\u2019s mouth and made him breathe in deeply, suddenly becoming all too aware of what was going on. He felt someone behind him place their hand on the small of his back, gently pushing him forward, and when he glanced around briefly he noticed it\u2019d been Steve. The man\u2019s eyes were red, pools of tears welling in the bottoms of them, but he smiled faintly when Peter turned to look at him, clearly a sign of encouragement. Either that or he was trying to make him aware of the fact that Tony probably did not have much time left, so if he wanted to speak to him, it had to be now.</p><p>The moment Tony weakly lifted his arm to stretch out toward him, the kid broke, immediately rushing over to the man and falling to his knees. He grabbed his hand, squeezing it tightly, and his heart skipped a beat when he didn\u2019t receive one in return. Though Tony was clinging on to him, it was obviously strenuous for him to do so. He was barely holding himself up as it was. \u201cTony-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI nee- need you to do me a favour, Pete.\u201d His voice was a whisper in the enveloping silence around them, and the boy\u2019s throat tightened as he heard the broken words.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mister Stark. Anything.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth was dry. He could barely speak, and yet he\u00a0<i>needed</i>\u00a0to have this conversation. \u201cWill you look after Morgan for- for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgan?\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes narrowed the smallest bit and he absentmindedly tilted his head to the side. Doctor Strange had said they\u2019d been gone for five years, but what exactly had happened in those five years still remained a mystery. It wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d had much time to talk about it since\u2026 but he\u2019d hoped to get a chance to after everything stopped.</p><p>A small smile ghosted over Tony\u2019s lips as he stared at the kid with drooping eyes. \u201cA lot happened while you were g-gone, kiddo. I\u2026 I got a family. Pepper and me- we had a baby. Girl. Morgan.\u201d</p><p>A\u00a0<i>baby</i>? Peter couldn\u2019t stop the light from going off in those bright eyes of his. The slightest splash of colour returned to his tear-stained cheeks and he breathed a laugh. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, a look of pride briefly passing across his face. He shifted, wincing immediately at the pain that shot through the whole of his right side, and Peter\u2019s face fell before he quickly rushed to comfort him. His hand fell lightly on his shoulder, the other still tightly gripping onto his hand, and the man immediately felt a surge of pure solace rush through him. \u201cWe did,\u201d he whispered. His eyes shut for the shortest moment before he blinked rapidly and turned them back on the kid. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cp-people keep asking me\u2026 what it\u2019s like to be a dad.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cAnd what do you tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I tell them that it\u2019s no different.\u201d He leaned his head back against the rock he was resting against, swallowing what tasted to be blood. His heart, slow as it was, sped up for the briefest of moments at the slight panicking thought that he may not be able to finish this conversation like he wanted, but he recovered quickly at the unfocused sight of Peter staring worriedly back at him. He was sure the kid had said his name a couple seconds ago. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said, squeezing Peter\u2019s hand back as hard as he could.</p><p>Peter visibly deflated, shutting his eyes and sighing in what he assumed to be relief. He nodded. \u201cNo- no different to what, Mister Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo different to h-how it used to be\u2026 before Mor-Morgan was born. B-before Thanos.\u201d His vision was becoming hazier by the second. His head was aching tremendously. It felt as though hundreds of knives were stabbing into the entire right side of his body. His mouth was drier than the day Rhodey found him in the desert\u2026 he was fading. He hated that he was fading. And, yet, at the same time, he praised it. \u201cI\u2019d already been a dad for two years,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know it then.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Peter wondered if Tony really was starting to get confused. Was that what people did when they were dying? He wasn\u2019t sure. But, suddenly, as if he\u2019d been hit in the face by an impulse from Iron Man\u2019s blaster, he understood. The man was talking about him.\u00a0<i>Him</i>. It had, after all, been two years before he turned to dust that he\u2019d met Tony. He supposed it must be seven, now. Seven years. And he had spent five of them without him. Tears were beginning to pool in his eyes once again, and he couldn\u2019t help but sniff loudly as he shifted on one knee. \u201cYou mean that, Mister Stark?\u201d he all but squeaked.</p><p>Tony nodded once, eyes slowly beginning to lose their light. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cShould\u2019ve told yo- you that a long time ago.\u201d His head slowly fell to the side, and if it wasn\u2019t for Peter\u2019s hand quickly reaching up and cupping the side \u2013 the\u00a0<i>burning\u00a0</i>side \u2013 of his face, he probably would have dropped off there and then. But the gentle touch against his singed skin and the coldness of the Spider Man suit brought him quickly back to it all. The last of his strength was used up entirely as he moved his free hand up to place against Peter\u2019s next to his face. \u201cYou,\u201d he whispered hoarsely, \u201care one of the greatest things\u2026 to ever happen in my life, you understand? Every\u2026\u00a0<i>every</i>\u00a0good decision I\u2019ve made since meeting y-you has been be<i>cause</i>\u00a0I met you. You ch-changed me\u2026 in ways I didn\u2019t even think possible.\u201d He swallowed more blood, the metallic taste making his stomach church. \u201cYou saved my life, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s lower lip began to tremble almost as hard as the rest of his body. His face contorted into something so painful and hopeless that Tony himself felt tears begin to well in his own red eyes. \u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d the kid said. His broken voice was one somebody would expect to hear from a young boy who was watching his own father die. He rapidly shook his head, tears openly gushing down his face, and bent forward, placing his forehead against Tony\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve just saved mine,\u201d he burst out. \u201c<i>Every</i>body\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The lump in Tony\u2019s throat would never feel as uncomfortable as watching your child cry. He wanted to leap up, take that kid into his arms and cling on with every ounce of strength he had. But strength had long surpassed him. He did not have a\u00a0<i>fibre</i>\u00a0of it left. All he could do was sit there, paralysed with much more than fear, and watch as Peter broke into unrelentless sobs. He weakly shook his head, turning the hand resting against Peter\u2019s around so he could gently grab it and pull it off his face. He held both of them in his own, waiting for him to look up before he spoke. \u201cI did,\u201d he said, surprised at the amount of emotion in his voice. \u201cTo give you the opportunity to be- be the greatest hero o-on this goddamn earth.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat if it meant you\u2019d get a chance to live a better life than I- I did.\u201d</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t sure what kind of life he\u2019d be living after this. What was a world without Tony Stark, after all? That man had taught him everything.\u00a0<i>He\u2019d</i>\u00a0saved his life\u2026 in more ways than one. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you so much,\u201d he choked out, and Tony heaved a rattling sigh.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He used both hands to feebly pull Peter towards him, the kid soon getting the idea and moving the rest of the way into Tony\u2019s arms by himself. He was still kneeling, but resting his side against Tony\u2019s chest, and fitting his head just underneath the man\u2019s chin made him feel better. He felt two arms wrap around him, and they were nowhere near as strong as what those bear-hugs had once used to be\u2026 but it was beyond better than nothing. \u201cRemember what I said about Morgan, okay? She- I want her to grow- grow up w-with someone like you as her guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have been you.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was muffled, but the man\u2019s ears had not lost their sharpness, despite the added now-constant sound of his heartbeat drumming.</p><p>\u201cIt could never have been me, Pete-\u201c A sharp pain zipped through his body, and his eyes clenched shut. He swallowed \u2013 audibly, this time \u2013 the huge amount of blood which he was sure was trying to make its way out through his mouth, not back down again, and groaned, hands around Peter dropping to his sides and fists clenching.</p><p>Peter quickly sat up, wide eyes hurriedly scanning him. \u201cTony?\u201d His voice broke. \u201cTony!\u201d</p><p>Tony grabbed his wrist, breaths coming in short gasps as he tried to control it all. He was sure he could hear the people around him voicing their concern to each other, but he was also certain \u2013 and assured \u2013 that there were people there, such as Pepper and Steve, to stop them from trying to help him. He could not be helped. Did he even want it? His eyes shot open, immediately landing on Peter. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said, voice gravelly. He did not want to rush this, but he felt as though he was on a time limit here, and it was quickly coming to an end. \u201cAlways have. I\u2019m sorry- for not showing it.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cI knew it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u00a0<i>did\u00a0</i>show it.\u201d And he had. Every phone call made to check in on him, every hour spent out of his day working on the Spider Man suit, every penny he spent on him, every hug, every shared laugh, every smile&hellip; they\u2019d all shown his love in the most discreet of ways, but they\u2019d done it all the same, and Peter couldn\u2019t have felt more grateful.</p><p>Tony smiled, and the kid tried his hardest to not be shocked at the blood that was quickly coating his lips. \u201cI thought so.\u201d He could barely hear his own voice, now. \u201cHey\u2026 thanks for all the dad practice you gave me. It really pro- proved useful.\u201d He smiled faintly at the breathy laugh that escaped Peter\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said, before hesitating. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>Pain. It had all gone, now. There\u2019d been an agonising moment of it\u2026 but it\u2019d faded. He felt&hellip; light. Like his soul was beginning to drift off, leaving the shell behind. There was no feeling of- of anything. He shifted slightly, shaking his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0<i>Because you\u2019re here with me.\u00a0</i>He coughed, blood dripping down from his mouth, and his face turned deathly white. Raging butterflies spawned out of nowhere in Peter\u2019s stomach, and he leaned forward, hands coming to rest on Tony\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d he called.</p><p>The warmth of Tony\u2019s life was being swept away by the cold embrace of death, and yet this cold embrace felt welcoming. He was seconds away from it, now. He could see the light, and as soon as he touched it, as soon as his fingertips brushed across it, it turned warm. Comforting. It felt like he was going home.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been an honour, son.\u201d</p><p>And, like the snap of two fingers, Tony Stark\u2019s heart beat one last time.</p>",

She- I want her to grow- grow up w-with someone like you as her guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have been you.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was muffled, but the man\u2019s ears had not lost their sharpness, despite the added now-constant sound of his heartbeat drumming.</p><p>\u201cIt could never have been me, Pete-\u201c A sharp pain zipped through his body, and his eyes clenched shut. He swallowed \u2013 audibly, this time \u2013 the huge amount of blood which he was sure was trying to make its way out through his mouth, not back down again, and groaned, hands around Peter dropping to his sides and fists clenching.</p><p>Peter quickly sat up, wide eyes hurriedly scanning him. \u201cTony?\u201d His voice broke. \u201cTony!\u201d</p><p>Tony grabbed his wrist, breaths coming in short gasps as he tried to control it all. He was sure he could hear the people around him voicing their concern to each other, but he was also certain \u2013 and assured \u2013 that there were people there, such as Pepper and Steve, to stop them from trying to help him. He could not be helped. Did he even want it? His eyes shot open, immediately landing on Peter. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said, voice gravelly. He did not want to rush this, but he felt as though he was on a time limit here, and it was quickly coming to an end. \u201cAlways have. I\u2019m sorry- for not showing it.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cI knew it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u00a0<i>did\u00a0</i>show it.\u201d And he had. Every phone call made to check in on him, every hour spent out of his day working on the Spider Man suit, every penny he spent on him, every hug, every shared laugh, every smile\u2026 they\u2019d all shown his love in the most discreet of ways, but they\u2019d done it all the same, and Peter couldn\u2019t have felt more grateful.</p><p>Tony smiled, and the kid tried his hardest to not be shocked at the blood that was quickly coating his lips. \u201cI thought so.\u201d He could barely hear his own voice, now. \u201cHey\u2026 thanks for all the dad practice you gave me. It really pro- proved useful.\u201d He smiled faintly at the breathy laugh that escaped Peter\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said, before hesitating. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>Pain. It had all gone, now. There\u2019d been an agonising moment of it\u2026 but it\u2019d faded. He felt\u2026 light. Like his soul was beginning to drift off, leaving the shell behind. There was no feeling of- of anything. He shifted slightly, shaking his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0<i>Because you\u2019re here with me.\u00a0</i>He coughed, blood dripping down from his mouth, and his face turned deathly white. Raging butterflies spawned out of nowhere in Peter\u2019s stomach, and he leaned forward, hands coming to rest on Tony\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d he called.</p><p>The warmth of Tony\u2019s life was being swept away by the cold embrace of death, and yet this cold embrace felt welcoming. He was seconds away from it, now. He could see the light, and as soon as he touched it, as soon as his fingertips brushed across it, it turned warm. Comforting. It felt like he was going home.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been an honour, son.\u201d</p><p>And, like the snap of two fingers, Tony Stark\u2019s heart beat one last time.</p>",

His arms were hugging his chest as fat tears rolled down his cheeks, leaving silvery trails in their wake before falling down into the dirt. He was shivering almost violently, though he knew it was not because of any drop in temperature. The sight in front of him alone was enough to send him into a frenzy, and it was not failing in doing so now.</p><p>Pepper nodded, biting her bottom lip and heaving a sigh before leaning forward to press a kiss to her husband\u2019s charred forehead. She lingered there for a moment, and Peter almost felt like leaving simply to allow her more time with him\u2026 but denying that he wanted to speak to Tony would be the biggest lie in his entire existence. Pepper slowly got to her feet, eyes never once straying from Tony. He looked so\u2026 broken. So defeated. And yet he had just saved the world.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, Peter.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was so soft, so quiet, that Peter barely noticed she\u2019d spoken to him. He swallowed thickly, turning to look at Pepper and noting the sympathetic gleam in her eyes. She reached out to cup the side of his face, a watery smile veiling her dry lips for just a moment before she dropped her hand and moved past him, sobs becoming all the more audible as Hope and Okoye moved to comfort her.</p><p>He suddenly felt rooted to the spot. No sound was making its way through his ears as Peter stood, legs firmly planted on the ground, arms still locked around his trembling body, except the almost deafening pumping of his heart. His breaths were coming in short gasps, and his vision was getting blurrier by the second.</p><p>And then he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Peter.\u201d Those words spilled from Tony\u2019s mouth and made him breathe in deeply, suddenly becoming all too aware of what was going on. He felt someone behind him place their hand on the small of his back, gently pushing him forward, and when he glanced around briefly he noticed it\u2019d been Steve. The man\u2019s eyes were red, pools of tears welling in the bottoms of them, but he smiled faintly when Peter turned to look at him, clearly a sign of encouragement. Either that or he was trying to make him aware of the fact that Tony probably did not have much time left, so if he wanted to speak to him, it had to be now.</p><p>The moment Tony weakly lifted his arm to stretch out toward him, the kid broke, immediately rushing over to the man and falling to his knees. He grabbed his hand, squeezing it tightly, and his heart skipped a beat when he didn\u2019t receive one in return. Though Tony was clinging on to him, it was obviously strenuous for him to do so. He was barely holding himself up as it was. \u201cTony-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI nee- need you to do me a favour, Pete.\u201d His voice was a whisper in the enveloping silence around them, and the boy\u2019s throat tightened as he heard the broken words.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mister Stark. Anything.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth was dry. He could barely speak, and yet he\u00a0<i>needed</i>\u00a0to have this conversation. \u201cWill you look after Morgan for- for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgan?\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes narrowed the smallest bit and he absentmindedly tilted his head to the side. Doctor Strange had said they\u2019d been gone for five years, but what exactly had happened in those five years still remained a mystery. It wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d had much time to talk about it since\u2026 but he\u2019d hoped to get a chance to after everything stopped.</p><p>A small smile ghosted over Tony\u2019s lips as he stared at the kid with drooping eyes. \u201cA lot happened while you were g-gone, kiddo. I\u2026 I got a family. Pepper and me- we had a baby. Girl. Morgan.\u201d</p><p>A\u00a0<i>baby</i>? Peter couldn\u2019t stop the light from going off in those bright eyes of his. The slightest splash of colour returned to his tear-stained cheeks and he breathed a laugh. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, a look of pride briefly passing across his face. He shifted, wincing immediately at the pain that shot through the whole of his right side, and Peter\u2019s face fell before he quickly rushed to comfort him. His hand fell lightly on his shoulder, the other still tightly gripping onto his hand, and the man immediately felt a surge of pure solace rush through him. \u201cWe did,\u201d he whispered. His eyes shut for the shortest moment before he blinked rapidly and turned them back on the kid. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cp-people keep asking me\u2026 what it\u2019s like to be a dad.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cAnd what do you tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I tell them that it\u2019s no different.\u201d He leaned his head back against the rock he was resting against, swallowing what tasted to be blood. His heart, slow as it was, sped up for the briefest of moments at the slight panicking thought that he may not be able to finish this conversation like he wanted, but he recovered quickly at the unfocused sight of Peter staring worriedly back at him. He was sure the kid had said his name a couple seconds ago. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said, squeezing Peter\u2019s hand back as hard as he could.</p><p>Peter visibly deflated, shutting his eyes and sighing in what he assumed to be relief. He nodded. \u201cNo- no different to what, Mister Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo different to h-how it used to be\u2026 before Mor-Morgan was born. B-before Thanos.\u201d His vision was becoming hazier by the second. His head was aching tremendously. It felt as though hundreds of knives were stabbing into the entire right side of his body. His mouth was drier than the day Rhodey found him in the desert\u2026 he was fading. He hated that he was fading. And, yet, at the same time, he praised it. \u201cI\u2019d already been a dad for two years,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know it then.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Peter wondered if Tony really was starting to get confused. Was that what people did when they were dying? He wasn\u2019t sure. But, suddenly, as if he\u2019d been hit in the face by an impulse from Iron Man\u2019s blaster, he understood. The man was talking about him.\u00a0<i>Him</i>. It had, after all, been two years before he turned to dust that he\u2019d met Tony. He supposed it must be seven, now. Seven years. And he had spent five of them without him. Tears were beginning to pool in his eyes once again, and he couldn\u2019t help but sniff loudly as he shifted on one knee. \u201cYou mean that, Mister Stark?\u201d he all but squeaked.</p><p>Tony nodded once, eyes slowly beginning to lose their light. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cShould\u2019ve told yo- you that a long time ago.\u201d His head slowly fell to the side, and if it wasn\u2019t for Peter\u2019s hand quickly reaching up and cupping the side \u2013 the\u00a0<i>burning\u00a0</i>side \u2013 of his face, he probably would have dropped off there and then. But the gentle touch against his singed skin and the coldness of the Spider Man suit brought him quickly back to it all. The last of his strength was used up entirely as he moved his free hand up to place against Peter\u2019s next to his face. \u201cYou,\u201d he whispered hoarsely, \u201care one of the greatest things\u2026 to ever happen in my life, you understand? Every\u2026\u00a0<i>every</i>\u00a0good decision I\u2019ve made since meeting y-you has been be<i>cause</i>\u00a0I met you. You ch-changed me\u2026 in ways I didn\u2019t even think possible.\u201d He swallowed more blood, the metallic taste making his stomach church. \u201cYou saved my life, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s lower lip began to tremble almost as hard as the rest of his body. His face contorted into something so painful and hopeless that Tony himself felt tears begin to well in his own red eyes. \u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d the kid said. His broken voice was one somebody would expect to hear from a young boy who was watching his own father die. He rapidly shook his head, tears openly gushing down his face, and bent forward, placing his forehead against Tony\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve just saved mine,\u201d he burst out. \u201c<i>Every</i>body\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The lump in Tony\u2019s throat would never feel as uncomfortable as watching your child cry. He wanted to leap up, take that kid into his arms and cling on with every ounce of strength he had. But strength had long surpassed him. He did not have a\u00a0<i>fibre</i>\u00a0of it left. All he could do was sit there, paralysed with much more than fear, and watch as Peter broke into unrelentless sobs. He weakly shook his head, turning the hand resting against Peter\u2019s around so he could gently grab it and pull it off his face. He held both of them in his own, waiting for him to look up before he spoke. \u201cI did,\u201d he said, surprised at the amount of emotion in his voice. \u201cTo give you the opportunity to be- be the greatest hero o-on this goddamn earth.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat if it meant you\u2019d get a chance to live a better life than I- I did.\u201d</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t sure what kind of life he\u2019d be living after this. What was a world without Tony Stark, after all? That man had taught him everything.\u00a0<i>He\u2019d</i>\u00a0saved his life\u2026 in more ways than one. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you so much,\u201d he choked out, and Tony heaved a rattling sigh.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He used both hands to feebly pull Peter towards him, the kid soon getting the idea and moving the rest of the way into Tony\u2019s arms by himself. He was still kneeling, but resting his side against Tony\u2019s chest, and fitting his head just underneath the man\u2019s chin made him feel better. He felt two arms wrap around him, and they were nowhere near as strong as what those bear-hugs had once used to be\u2026 but it was beyond better than nothing. \u201cRemember what I said about Morgan, okay?

I&hellip; I got a family. Pepper and me- we had a baby. Girl. Morgan.&rdquo;</p><p>A&nbsp;<i>baby</i>? Peter couldn&rsquo;t stop the light from going off in those bright eyes of his. The slightest splash of colour returned to his tear-stained cheeks and he breathed a laugh. &ldquo;You did?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded, a look of pride briefly passing across his face. He shifted, wincing immediately at the pain that shot through the whole of his right side, and Peter&rsquo;s face fell before he quickly rushed to comfort him. His hand fell lightly on his shoulder, the other still tightly gripping onto his hand, and the man immediately felt a surge of pure solace rush through him. &ldquo;We did,&rdquo; he whispered. His eyes shut for the shortest moment before he blinked rapidly and turned them back on the kid. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;p-people keep asking me&hellip; what it&rsquo;s like to be a dad.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded. &ldquo;And what do you tell them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I- I tell them that it&rsquo;s no different.&rdquo; He leaned his head back against the rock he was resting against, swallowing what tasted to be blood. His heart, slow as it was, sped up for the briefest of moments at the slight panicking thought that he may not be able to finish this conversation like he wanted, but he recovered quickly at the unfocused sight of Peter staring worriedly back at him. He was sure the kid had said his name a couple seconds ago. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he said, squeezing Peter&rsquo;s hand back as hard as he could.</p><p>Peter visibly deflated, shutting his eyes and sighing in what he assumed to be relief. He nodded. &ldquo;No- no different to what, Mister Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No different to h-how it used to be&hellip; before Mor-Morgan was born. B-before Thanos.&rdquo; His vision was becoming hazier by the second. His head was aching tremendously. It felt as though hundreds of knives were stabbing into the entire right side of his body. His mouth was drier than the day Rhodey found him in the desert&hellip; he was fading. He hated that he was fading. And, yet, at the same time, he praised it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d already been a dad for two years,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t know it then.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment, Peter wondered if Tony really was starting to get confused. Was that what people did when they were dying? He wasn&rsquo;t sure. But, suddenly, as if he&rsquo;d been hit in the face by an impulse from Iron Man&rsquo;s blaster, he understood. The man was talking about him.&nbsp;<i>Him</i>. It had, after all, been two years before he turned to dust that he&rsquo;d met Tony. He supposed it must be seven, now. Seven years. And he had spent five of them without him. Tears were beginning to pool in his eyes once again, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but sniff loudly as he shifted on one knee. &ldquo;You mean that, Mister Stark?&rdquo; he all but squeaked.</p><p>Tony nodded once, eyes slowly beginning to lose their light. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Should&rsquo;ve told yo- you that a long time ago.&rdquo; His head slowly fell to the side, and if it wasn&rsquo;t for Peter&rsquo;s hand quickly reaching up and cupping the side &ndash; the&nbsp;<i>burning&nbsp;</i>side &ndash; of his face, he probably would have dropped off there and then. But the gentle touch against his singed skin and the coldness of the Spider Man suit brought him quickly back to it all. The last of his strength was used up entirely as he moved his free hand up to place against Peter&rsquo;s next to his face. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;are one of the greatest things&hellip; to ever happen in my life, you understand? Every&hellip;&nbsp;<i>every</i>&nbsp;good decision I&rsquo;ve made since meeting y-you has been be<i>cause</i>&nbsp;I met you. You ch-changed me&hellip; in ways I didn&rsquo;t even think possible.&rdquo; He swallowed more blood, the metallic taste making his stomach church. &ldquo;You saved my life, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s lower lip began to tremble almost as hard as the rest of his body. His face contorted into something so painful and hopeless that Tony himself felt tears begin to well in his own red eyes. &ldquo;<i>Yes</i>,&rdquo; the kid said. His broken voice was one somebody would expect to hear from a young boy who was watching his own father die. He rapidly shook his head, tears openly gushing down his face, and bent forward, placing his forehead against Tony&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve just saved mine,&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;<i>Every</i>body&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>The lump in Tony&rsquo;s throat would never feel as uncomfortable as watching your child cry. He wanted to leap up, take that kid into his arms and cling on with every ounce of strength he had. But strength had long surpassed him. He did not have a&nbsp;<i>fibre</i>&nbsp;of it left. All he could do was sit there, paralysed with much more than fear, and watch as Peter broke into unrelentless sobs. He weakly shook his head, turning the hand resting against Peter&rsquo;s around so he could gently grab it and pull it off his face. He held both of them in his own, waiting for him to look up before he spoke. &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; he said, surprised at the amount of emotion in his voice. &ldquo;To give you the opportunity to be- be the greatest hero o-on this goddamn earth.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do it again in a heartbeat if it meant you&rsquo;d get a chance to live a better life than I- I did.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter wasn&rsquo;t sure what kind of life he&rsquo;d be living after this. What was a world without Tony Stark, after all? That man had taught him everything.&nbsp;<i>He&rsquo;d</i>&nbsp;saved his life&hellip; in more ways than one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you so much,&rdquo; he choked out, and Tony heaved a rattling sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He used both hands to feebly pull Peter towards him, the kid soon getting the idea and moving the rest of the way into Tony&rsquo;s arms by himself. He was still kneeling, but resting his side against Tony&rsquo;s chest, and fitting his head just underneath the man&rsquo;s chin made him feel better. He felt two arms wrap around him, and they were nowhere near as strong as what those bear-hugs had once used to be&hellip; but it was beyond better than nothing. &ldquo;Remember what I said about Morgan, okay? She- I want her to grow- grow up w-with someone like you as her guide.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It could have been you.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice was muffled, but the man&rsquo;s ears had not lost their sharpness, despite the added now-constant sound of his heartbeat drumming.</p><p>&ldquo;It could never have been me, Pete-&ldquo; A sharp pain zipped through his body, and his eyes clenched shut. He swallowed &ndash; audibly, this time &ndash; the huge amount of blood which he was sure was trying to make its way out through his mouth, not back down again, and groaned, hands around Peter dropping to his sides and fists clenching.</p><p>Peter quickly sat up, wide eyes hurriedly scanning him. &ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; His voice broke. &ldquo;Tony!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grabbed his wrist, breaths coming in short gasps as he tried to control it all. He was sure he could hear the people around him voicing their concern to each other, but he was also certain &ndash; and assured &ndash; that there were people there, such as Pepper and Steve, to stop them from trying to help him. He could not be helped. Did he even want it? His eyes shot open, immediately landing on Peter. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said, voice gravelly. He did not want to rush this, but he felt as though he was on a time limit here, and it was quickly coming to an end. &ldquo;Always have. I&rsquo;m sorry- for not showing it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head. &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&nbsp;<i>did&nbsp;</i>show it.&rdquo; And he had. Every phone call made to check in on him, every hour spent out of his day working on the Spider Man suit, every penny he spent on him, every hug, every shared laugh, every smile&hellip; they&rsquo;d all shown his love in the most discreet of ways, but they&rsquo;d done it all the same, and Peter couldn&rsquo;t have felt more grateful.</p><p>Tony smiled, and the kid tried his hardest to not be shocked at the blood that was quickly coating his lips. &ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo; He could barely hear his own voice, now. &ldquo;Hey&hellip; thanks for all the dad practice you gave me. It really pro- proved useful.&rdquo; He smiled faintly at the breathy laugh that escaped Peter&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he said, before hesitating. &ldquo;Are you in pain?&rdquo;</p><p>Pain. It had all gone, now. There&rsquo;d been an agonising moment of it&hellip; but it&rsquo;d faded. He felt&hellip; light. Like his soul was beginning to drift off, leaving the shell behind. There was no feeling of- of anything. He shifted slightly, shaking his head. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>Because you&rsquo;re here with me.&nbsp;</i>He coughed, blood dripping down from his mouth, and his face turned deathly white. Raging butterflies spawned out of nowhere in Peter&rsquo;s stomach, and he leaned forward, hands coming to rest on Tony&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; he called.</p><p>The warmth of Tony&rsquo;s life was being swept away by the cold embrace of death, and yet this cold embrace felt welcoming. He was seconds away from it, now. He could see the light, and as soon as he touched it, as soon as his fingertips brushed across it, it turned warm. Comforting. It felt like he was going home.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been an honour, son.&rdquo;</p><p>And, like the snap of two fingers, Tony Stark&rsquo;s heart beat one last time.</p>",

Strength training: done. Combat training: done. Shower: done. Lunch: done (and yummy, you might add).</p><p>\n\nAnother Saturday morning in the books, you plopped yourself down on the couch in the common room waiting for Pepper to come get you. She told you she would do your hair and makeup for the gala so that all you had to do was get dressed when it was time. While you were excited to get totally dressed up, she was definitely more excited than you were. Wouldn\u2019t it be more fun to stay in pajamas and hang out with friends?\n</p><!-- more --><p>Your phone dinged right as you set your feet on the coffee table. It was a text from MJ asking about your \u201cplans\u201d for the night. Keeping up with the spirit of the previous week, she kept digging for details about you and Peter ever since she and Ned heard you were going to the gala together. You explained multiple times that it was just Tony being Tony, but they wouldn\u2019t hear it.</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> soooooo what\u2019s the plan</p>\n\n<p><b>You:</b> Well, I think Tony said the dinner officially starts at 7 but doors open at 6 so we\u2019re going then!</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> no no. what\u2019s the PLAN plan</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> you know what I mean ;)</p><p>\n\nSure, you knew what she meant. And sure, part of you wished you had a plan. But you didn\u2019t, because you weren\u2019t going to do anything. You barely knew him, anyway. The only reason he was going with you was because Tony was making him. Nothing else.</p>\n\n<p><b>You:</b> Lol MJ, I\u2019ve told you a thousand times. No \u201cplan\u201d</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> suit yourself. but when your eyes meet across the dance floor and you fall in love, remember that I told you so</p>\n\n<p><b>You:</b> Fine. I don\u2019t even think there is a dance floor. But if somehow our lives become a fairy tale then I\u2019ll thank you.</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> you\u2019re welcome.</p><p>\n\n\u201cY/N? You ready?\u201d Pepper\u2019s heels clicked on the floor as she walked up to you. With a smile and nod you stood up and followed her, wondering all the while how she spent all day in heels without her feet hurting. <i>And now she had to wear heels to a gala, too? Insane.</i></p>\n\n<p>Pepper led you to the bedroom she shared with Tony and then into her bathroom, which was completely prepped and ready for you. There were hair tools laid out all across the left side of the counter and makeup all over the right side.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always a mess \u2013 I promise,\u201d Pepper reassured you, though you didn\u2019t doubt it. \u201cI just have everything laid out so you can see your options.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t really\u2026know? I have no idea what would look good on me or with the dress or for this occasion or anything. But I do trust your judgement,\u201d you sputtered. It was true \u2013 you had seen pictures and things from previous events like the gala tonight but coming up with looks like that was completely foreign to you.</p><p>\n\nPepper stepped back and squinted at your hair and face. She had a pretty good idea of you by now, both in terms of personality and in terms of what you were comfortable with. She wouldn\u2019t go crazy, obviously, but devised a classy yet youthful \u2013 had to stick with the princess vibes \u2013 look for you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI do have an idea, yes.\u201d She ushered you over to a chair and grabbed something you didn\u2019t recognize from the makeup side of the counter. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like it, but before I start, are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cAm I sure if I trust the extraordinarily stylish Pepper Potts to dress me for an event?\u201d You giggled, bringing a smile to her face as well. \u201cYes, of course I do! Make me pretty, pretty please.\u201d</p><p>\n\nShe stepped in front of you and started applying product to your face. \u201cYou\u2019re already pretty,\u201d she whispered, cupping your cheek as you grinned at her until she grabbed the next product.</p><hr><p>\n\nWearing makeup was\u2026weird. It made your face feel hot and it was so strange seeing black around the edge of your eyelids from the mascara on your eyelashes. You stopped noticing it after a few minutes, but it was a strange adjustment. Stranger still was having your hair curled. That curling iron was hot. But it was also an odd sensation to look down and see your hair shorter than normal because the curls eliminated some of the length.</p><p>\n\nPepper rolled up, held, and let go one last curl, then sprayed your head with a little bit of hairspray to make sure it would hold. Finally, she handed you your dress and told you to go put it on while she got herself ready. You tiptoed back to your room down the hall, not wanting to attract the attention of any other Avengers in their rooms getting ready. Though Pepper said you were pretty \u2013 both naturally and with the hair and makeup she did for you \u2013 it felt strange looking as you did. Having those who saw you dripping sweat on a daily basis see you look so different was a bit of an uncomfortable thought.</p><p>\n\nLuckily, you made it back to your room unseen and pulled the dress out from your closet and off the hanger. It zipped on easily, just as it had the previous night, but that didn\u2019t mean it was comfortable. <i>Oh, how I miss my t-shirt and shorts,</i> you thought, the idea only reinforced as you slipped on the heels from a box in your closet. You attached the clasp of the second shoe and stood up just as a knock sounded on the door and Pepper\u2019s voice on the other side asked if she could come in.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYes, please \u2013 I think I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou smoothed the front of your dress as she cracked the door and slid into the room with you. Her jaw simultaneously dropped as a smile formed on her face; she was equally stunned and proud of how grown up you seemed.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou look amazing, sweetheart,\u201d she said, closing the distance between you to give you a hug. Though you were still new to the compound, Tony calling you \u201ckiddo,\u201d and Pepper calling you \u201csweetheart,\u201d felt extremely comfortable. On top of that, it made your heart swell.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThanks to you, and \u2013 might I add \u2013 so do you!\u201d You spoke softly into her ear as she still held you, now laughing over your shoulder. She stepped back, her hands resting on your shoulders as she looked you in the eyes. \u201cThank you. But have you actually seen yourself?\u201d</p><p>\n\nShaking your head, she grabbed your hand and pulled you to the floor-length mirror you used to look at yourself in the dress just one night earlier. But this time, the rest of the picture was complete, and the shock in your eyes showed it. You looked like yourself \u2013 she hadn\u2019t done anything too dramatic \u2013 but still so different.</p><p>\n\n\u201cStunning, huh?\u201d Pepper teased. She opened the door and stepped out into the hallway, leaning back in through the cracked door to say one last thing. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, come to the common room and we\u2019ll all head down to the gala as a group, ok?\u201d With that, she left you alone.</p><p>\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much else for you to do besides mentally panic. You looked totally different. <i>Is it stunning? Is it weird?</i> You didn\u2019t know. <i>What will Peter think?</i> You forgot about Peter. <i>Did he like your usual look? Would he hate this new look? Would he like this one better? </i>Who knew? Before you could delve too much further into the whirlpool of questions, you walked out of your room and to the common room, where only Pepper and Tony stood so far.</p><p>\n\n\u201cLook at my little girl! All grown up,\u201d Tony joked, giving you a hug. Almost identical to Pepper, as he pulled away, he rested his hands on your arms. \u201cBut really, you look beautiful, kiddo. Underoos isn\u2019t going to know what hit him.\u201d</p><p>\n\n<i>Underoos?</i></p><p>\n\n\u201cYou called?\u201d Peter piped up, now slowly approaching from the top of the stairs behind you with a quick wave. Tony\u2019s hands fell from arms and you turned to face Peter, who immediately slowed as if his walking was stuttering instead of his voice. He instantly reddened, trying \u2013 and failing \u2013 to look at the floor (or anywhere else, really).</p><p>\n\n\u201cHi, Peter,\u201d you breathed. He was more visibly nervous than you but that didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t nervous at all. He looked good, too, and that didn\u2019t help your case. He now stood a few feet in front of you, hands fidgeting and barely reaching out from the sleeves of his <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiJ1pPWUEAAXzU2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">dark navy suit</a> that perfectly matched your dress. He wore a crisp, light blue button-down shirt underneath and his tie was striped with different shades of navy. His dress shoes were about as shiny as a pair of dress shoes could be \u2013 from what you knew about his aunt, you guessed she probably wouldn\u2019t have let him leave the house unless they were perfect.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHi, Y/N\u2026you\u2026you look\u2014<i>beautiful,\u201d</i> he said, trying to breathe.</p><p>\n\n\u201cAw, young love. Well, shall we go to the party?\u201d Tony held out his arm for Pepper, who gladly took it and followed him down the hallway toward the end of the compound where the gala was being hosted. \u201cCome along, kids, we are the ones hosting this event and should probably be there on time!\u201d</p><p>\n\nPepper grinned and lightly punched him, wanting to give you and Peter space. When you turned back to Peter, he was cautiously holding his arm out to you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cShall we?\u201d He asked with an edgy giggle, feeling silly but going along with Tony\u2019s antics. You took his arm just as Pepper had Tony\u2019s and the two of you sped along to catch up to the adults.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou look really good, too, you know,\u201d you whispered, leaning slightly toward Peter as you walked but keeping your eyes forward. When he looked at you, however, you could feel it. You could feel his eyes and had to look back at him and the cheesy smile plastered across his face.</p><p>\n\nThat is, until you tripped on your dress and nearly took a tumble.</p><p>\n\n<i>Curse this long dress and tall shoes and\u2026ugh,</i> you thought as Peter\u2019s arm that was leading you kept you from hitting the ground face first. Luckily neither Pepper nor Tony heard and they both kept walking, but Peter stopped and grabbed your other hand to get you back up and on your feet.</p><p>\n\n\u201cY/N! You ok?\u201d he murmured as he helped you get oriented again. You took a deep breath, closing your eyes for half a second to try and calm your embarrassment. But, if you really thought about it, you weren\u2019t embarrassed. Before you could push the impulse back down, you snorted with laughter opening your eyes to see Peter\u2019s worried face fading into giggles to match your own. As soon as he knew everything was ok, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh along with you as you got back to walking to the gala.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m such a klutz,\u201d you joked. \u201cPepper wears this stuff all the time and I can\u2019t even walk for five seconds without nearly wiping out!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m surprised it wasn\u2019t me who fell first. A little thankful, I have to admit.\u201d You rolled your eyes at him but still giggled thinking about it. \u201cTrust me though, I will fall at some point. And my shoes are way easier to walk in than yours!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cNo way the famous <i>Spider-man</i> is clumsy. No way.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\n\nThe four of you reached a large set of doors guarded by none other than Happy Hogan. He gave you a quick smile and wave, gave Peter a wave \u2013 sans smile, to Peter\u2019s dismay \u2013 and opened the door for Tony to make his entrance.</p><p>\n\nThankfully, there weren\u2019t very many people arriving yet. The main doors had only just opened and people were quickly filtering in. Once Happy safely got you all inside, he showed you to your table and excused himself to return to security duties.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWhile everyone is arriving, let\u2019s get a quick picture, and then we\u2019ll stick together so I can introduce you all to some people. Then we can split up and par-tay! But not too hard, of course. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou nodded at Tony and followed him, arm still linked with Peter\u2019s, as he first walked over to the photo backdrop. The group took turns getting various pictures and, as requested, Peter got one with you. He put his arm around you and you put yours around him, surprised by how comfortable it felt. Of course, Tony had to jump in and up the ante, so he grabbed the hand you had on your hip and put it on Peter\u2019s chest like in tacky prom pictures. You felt a little silly but relaxed with the fact that you could feel Peter\u2019s heart pounding underneath your hand. You weren\u2019t sure why that brought you comfort, but something about knowing he was also nervous calmed your own nerves. Unbeknownst to you, though his heart was pounding, Peter was on cloud nine.</p><p>\n\nLeaving the pictures, Tony led everyone away and walked up to a man in a sharp military suit. He then pulled you forward and away from Peter to introduce you to his good friend, Sir Colonel James Rhodes, who immediately corrected his friend with a sigh and told you to call him James or Rhodey or whatever you were comfortable with.</p><p>\n\nBehind you, Peter took a second to text Ned. Though he wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about his friends gossiping about you and him <i>together</i> at the gala, he promised he\u2019d keep his friend up to date. Plus, he needed all the support he could get.</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Dude. I\u2019m in way over my head</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> What do you mean? Are there villains there? Are you in a super fight?</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b>  What? No. Remember when I said I was in trouble?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> Oh, yeah? Because you realized Y/N was perfect and you looooove her?</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> NED! Ok. I admit, she\u2019s incredible. But you have to chill. I need help, she looks amazing and I keep blabbering and Mr. Stark keeps making comments about young love?! What do I do?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> Woah. This is the big leagues. Have you talked to Y/N much?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> You gotta hold her hand, man. Girls love that stuff.</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Barely, we walked arm in arm for a bit? And she tripped and I caught her? And she keeps smiling and I don\u2019t know if I can do this Ned</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Wait, how do you know what girls love?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> I get around, Pete. I have my ways.</p><p>\n\nBefore Peter could type up a reply, Tony pulled him forward to say hi to Rhodey, who he had previously met. Tony quickly whisked them away to person after person, bragging about you to each and every one. You kept trying to sneak back behind Tony and Pepper to hang out with Peter. As much as you loved Tony boasting about you and saying how proud he is (you couldn\u2019t get enough of it, to be honest), you also wanted to hang out with your friend.</p><p>\n\nHappy tapped on Tony\u2019s shoulder and whispered in his ear, then quickly strutted off.</p><p>\n\n\u201cAh! Time for us to go sit down, and I believe I have a mini-speech to make,\u201d he announced to your small group, directing you toward the table. As you sat down, a woman tapped on the microphone and asked everyone to take their seats. You sat with Peter on your left and Tony and Pepper adjacent to him. You were about to ask Pepper who else would be sitting at the table when someone answered for her.</p><p>\n\n\u201cExcuse me, miss, is this seat taken?\u201d</p><p>\n\nSteve stood just behind you, goofy grin on his face and hand on the back of the chair to your right.</p><p>\n\n\u201cOnly by you!\u201d you exclaimed, jumping up to give him a quick hug.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou look great, kid, and not in the fighting way this time,\u201d he whispered, looking over your shoulder at Peter seated behind you. \u201cSpider-boy is a lucky man.\u201d He leaned back and winked as he sat down, chuckling when you rolled your eyes with a smile.</p><p>\n\nGoing around the circle, next to Steve sat Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, Clint Barton, a woman you didn\u2019t recognize (Steve later told you it was Clint\u2019s wife, Laura), Thor, and Rhodey, who sat next to Pepper. Then there was, of course, Tony, Peter, and you. As the seats started to fill in, your eyes kept widening, as did Peter\u2019s. Once everyone was seated, you turned and looked at Peter with your jaw nearly on the floor. Sure, you had seen all of these superheroes around the compound, but to sit and have a fancy dinner with them? That was new.</p><p>\n\n<i>\u201cPeter,\u201d</i> you hissed, trying to get his attention from the Avengers seated around him. He turned to you, eyes just as wide as yours and brimming with delight.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThis is crazy\u2026we\u2019re at a dinner with the <i>Avengers!\u201d</i> you whispered, unable to contain your own excitement.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI know! And we\u2019re kind of friends with them?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but joke with you, clearly just as shocked by the arrangement. \u201cWhat even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\nHe was stopped by the lady at the front tapping on the microphone again and announcing the event. As Tony was introduced, the two of you couldn\u2019t help but be bored \u2013 you were only teenagers, after all \u2013 and resorted to playing <i>I Spy</i> under your breath until Tony got up to speak.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWelcome, welcome, and thank you for being here,\u201d he began. \u201cYes, I\u2019m Tony Stark, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d He paused again \u2013 ever commanding of attention \u2013 while the crowd broke out in laughter. Everyone at your table, however, rolled their eyes at his classically cocky behavior.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI think we all want to get right to it \u2013 there\u2019s food! And a party to be had! So, without further ado, thank you again for sponsoring <i>Stark Industries</i> and I hope that you enjoy this evening as much as I will!\u201d</p><p>\n\nWith a bow, he exited the stage and plopped back down in his seat between Peter and Pepper. Dinners were quickly served but Tony jumped up again.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI would like to make a toast,\u201d he declared to the table. Pepper shook her head and turned to Rhodey as he sighed. <i>\u201cStark Industries</i> has had a great year, sure, but so have the Avengers.\u201d Everyone nodded along now, far more invested in this message. \u201cWe\u2019ve celebrated that already \u2013 shout-out to shwarma \u2013 but I would also like to give a little shout-out to our little ones joining the team for stepping right into some big shoes. You\u2019ve both impressed me each and every step along the way and I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of trouble we\u2019ll have to bail you out of down the line. But just remember, the Avengers have your back. And you clearly have each other\u2019s backs. But you don\u2019t know that yet. I digress. Cheers!\u201d</p><p>\n\nPepper lightly punched him again as everyone raised their glasses and toasted. You and Peter raised your water glasses \u2013 which would have embarrassed you enough \u2013 but now Tony had to tease you in front of everyone. If you were honest with yourself, you couldn\u2019t say you hated it; anything that gave Peter a hint might help your case. But in the meantime, it was making you so incredibly nervous.</p><p>\n\nAs everyone dug into their meals, Steve pointed out to you twice how Tony kept leaning down to Peter and telling him something. Both times, Peter would weakly smile, nod, and continue eating while his eyes darted your direction. Every time Steve teased you, it reinforced his words from the previous day.<i> \u201cIf you are interested - and you don\u2019t have to be! But\u2026if you are\u2026just know that it definitely isn\u2019t unrequited,\u201d</i> he told you. <i>Was he right?</i> Peter did seem nervous. <i>But that very well could be because he\u2019s surrounded by his idols,</i> you reminded yourself.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI have a bit of a bone to pick with some of you,\u201d Clint professed, drawing the attention of everyone at the table. \u201cNot exactly a bone to pick. More of a little friendly teasing. So, how is it that our hundred-year-old super soldier, decorated military colonel, and literal god of thunder don\u2019t have girls by their sides, but our little spider-boy does? I mean, come on! And I mean no offense to you, Spidey, I\u2019m impressed!\u201d He slow clapped at Peter as those not being called out laughed with him. Peter blushed and nodded, eyes coming up to meet yours only briefly as you played along with their banter.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as much the ladies that should be rewarded,\u201d Natasha reminded him with a smirk, looking straight at you. \u201cAs usual, kudos to you, kid.\u201d</p><p>\n\nSteve patted you on the back as you sighed, realizing it was your turn to be embarrassed and teased by the table. These Avengers sure did like to take advantage of having kids around to poke fun at.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHow are you settling in? School going well?\u201d Bruce asked you, far more serious than any of the others.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going well and I\u2019m really loving it here,\u201d you reflected. \u201cI love training \u2013 Nat and Steve keep it very difficult for me,\u201d they grinned at you, not letting you say that without reminding you how successful you had been so far. \u201cAnd Peter has been really helpful at school\u2014\u201d you felt your gaze look over to him. He faced your conversation rather than the one on the other side of the table and seemed to hang on your every word. \u201cI\u2019ve been really thankful to have him,\u201d you finally pulled your stare from Peter\u2019s to look back at Bruce. \u201cPlus, Tony let me try out a suit yesterday and it was one of the most amazing things ever!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou did?\u201d Peter prodded your shoulder to get your attention back. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing! It went well? You had fun?\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou couldn\u2019t help but think back to the first week you met him and how he felt threatened by you joining the team. Whatever changed to make him this supportive friend now sitting by your side doing nothing but encouraging you\u2026you couldn\u2019t deny that it brought butterflies to your stomach.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt was incredible,\u201d you explained, trying not to focus on Peter despite your mind being drawn to him. \u201cIt was like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced before\u2026<i>obviously,\u201d</i> you joked, making everyone listening laugh along with you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cNow, Y/N, I know a little bit from what Tony told us before you arrived, but remind me again about what you were doing before Tony found you?\u201d Bruce asked.</p><p>\n\nFor some reason, the question made you uncertain. You hadn\u2019t thought about everyone back home and how they were probably all still doing the same thing and in the same routine as when you left just a few weeks ago. That easily could\u2019ve been you if Tony had picked one of the other millions of kids around the country, let alone the world. You couldn\u2019t put your finger on all the reasons, but the thought made you a bit uncomfortable. Thankful, but uncomfortable.</p><p>\n\nPeter\u2019s spidey sense started going off quietly and, while he first looked around for trouble, he quickly realized it was you. He wasn\u2019t in your head and didn\u2019t know the exact cause but pieced together that something about Bruce\u2019s question hit a sore subject. No one else seemed to pick up on it, however, and everyone patiently awaited your answer.</p><p>\n\nPeter could only explain what happened next as a result of the spidey sense amping up his adrenaline. His mind flashed back to Ned\u2019s advice: <i>\u201cyou gotta hold her hand, man. Girls love that stuff.\u201d</i> As that piece of information crashed together with the sense that you were nervous, he covertly reached his hand out and held your two hands that you were fidgeting with in your lap.</p><p>\n\nAs his warm and, slightly clammy hand (so were yours, though \u2013 you couldn\u2019t blame him) wrapped around yours, your eyes followed his arm up his sleeve to see him looking at you with the same smile and encouraging gaze from earlier. Your doe eyes stared at his puppy-dog ones that somehow reassured you as he nodded. You didn\u2019t know how he knew you were uncomfortable or really understand any of what just happened, but that didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t a little excited about it.</p><p>  \n\nThankfully everything took place in a matter of seconds and you answered Bruce\u2019s original question quickly enough for all the nerves and the hand-holding and other little things to go unnoticed by the adults. As you answered that first question and all those after it, Peter\u2019s hand never left yours. He even gave the occasional squeeze when his spidey sense kicked up a little higher. He figured it meant whatever they asked was a topic you were more anxious talking about and wanted to be there for support. He could sense you relaxing into it and eventually holding his hand back as you spoke, giving him his own butterflies. Most of all, a voice in the back of his head was telling him he owed Ned. <i>Big time.</i></p><p>\n\nMany conversations and laughs later, the clock struck 9 and Tony announced it was time to get the real party part of the night started. He repeated the announcement on stage into the microphone, receiving applause of course, and then returned to the table.</p><p>\n\nTony turned to you and Peter as he sat back down. \u201cThe bar is opening up, so children, you are now excused.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou both stared at him; you had no idea what he was trying to tell you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI figured you\u2019d rather go upstairs and watch a movie or something than hang out with a bunch of drinking adults? Since you can\u2019t drink and all? I mean, I\u2019m a cool dad and I\u2019d let you have a sip, but you\u2019re not old enough for open bar, you know?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but tease. \u201cPeter, you\u2019re welcome to stay the night or go home, whatever you want, just tell JARVIS so we make sure you get home safe if needed. You\u2019re a superhero but you\u2019re also a baby.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou and Peter glanced at each other, slightly confused, and got up to leave. Everyone said goodnight and wished you sweet dreams while you stood. Steve gave you a fist-bump, whispering, \u201cgo get \u2018em,\u201d as you turned to go.</p><p>\n\nHappy, guarding the door through which you initially entered, let you back into the secure part of the compound. You walked down the same hall you tripped in a few hours ago with Peter still by your side, the two of you sharing a somehow comfortable silence as he walked with his hands in his pockets and eyes watching his shoes.</p><p>\n\n\u201cAre\u2026are you going to stay?\u201d You asked, curious if you\u2019d be by yourself and going to sleep soon or if you\u2019d get to hang out a bit longer.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI, uh\u2026yeah? If you want me to?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cYeah, we could hang out for a little bit?\u201d You laughed to yourself as you kept walking, finding it funny how you clearly wanted him to stay but spoke as if it was a question. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to change, though, because as you know I can barely walk in this.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so relieved to hear you say that. I did not want to wear all these layers any longer,\u201d Peter confessed, loosening his tie and smiling as the tension started melting away.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d You stopped in place; your head tilted to the side. Peter stopped just a step in front of you and turned back. You reached your hand out and placed it on his shoulder closest to you. Peter panicked in that moment; all the air left his lungs as he had no idea what you planned to do.</p><p>\n\nSure enough, you kicked your foot up and slipped off one shoe after the other, relying on him for balance. Feet no planted on the floor, you sighed with relief. \u201cMuch better,\u201d you exclaimed with a giggle, pulling your hand back and picking your dress up with the hand not holding your shoes to keep walking.</p><p>\n\nPeter let out a breath he didn\u2019t realize he was holding and caught up with you, now laughing at how dramatic that was. The two of you split up when you reach your rooms, which, coincidentally, were right across the hall from each other - and changed out of your gala clothes and into pajamas. You pulled on a fuzzy <i>Stark Industries</i> sweatshirt and your favorite, patterned Iron Man pajama shorts.</p><p>\n\nOn the other side of the door, Peter had finished changing and was heading back to the common room. Like you, he opted for a sweatshirt and shorts, but instead pulled on Midtown gear. In the brief second he had alone, he pulled out his phone to at least 20 texts from Ned, all asking how it was going and if you and Peter were married yet. <i>Oh, Ned,</i> he thought.</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Ned. Did you get my message saying chill? We just left the gala and are hanging out just the two of us upstairs</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Btw? Hand-holding? Money!!!</p><p>\n\nYou walked into the common room before Ned could reply, but Peter felt his phone buzz once, twice, thrice \u2013 too many times to count. Peter sat down on the couch while you walked into the kitchen, offering snacks. When you brought the popcorn back, you sat down on the same couch as Peter but with a cushion in between you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to do? Game? Movie? Other?\u201d Peter chastised himself. <i>Why would I throw out \u2018other?\u2019 That\u2019s so weird!</i></p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up for whatever,\u201d you confided. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure what all our options are, but if we go the game route, you should know that I\u2019m very, very competitive.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see it,\u201d Peter teased, setting up some video game while you dug into the popcorn. With JARVIS\u2019 help, he eventually got Mario Kart up and running and showed you how to play.</p><p>\n\nHe started you off easy, helping you pick your character and bike so you wouldn\u2019t be totally at a loss. It only took you beating him once for him to switch gears and go from trying to be nice and flirty to trash-talking up a storm. But you\u2019d be lying if you said you didn\u2019t do the same.</p><p>\n\n\u201cTAKE THAT, LOSER!\u201d You yelled, jumping up on the couch as you threw a blue shell at his bike just a little bit up ahead. You could see the finish line on the last lap of Mushroom Gorge approaching and were not about to let him win.</p><p>\n\n\u201cNOOOOOOO!\u201d He screamed, his bike spinning out and slowly sputtering back up to speed as you whipped by him. Within seconds you crossed the finish line, jumping around the room as he finished the race in second.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI win, you lose, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha,\u201d you mocked as he grimaced and glared at you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI was being nice!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cExcuses, excuses, excuses\u2026<i>Avengers</i> don\u2019t make excuses,\u201d you teased, rubbing salt in the wound.</p><p>\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said coyly, a smirk growing on his face. \u201cRematch. Rainbow Road. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou hopped back into your spot on the couch while he started up the next race, accepting his challenge without hesitation. Before you knew it, the countdown started and you floored it immediately.</p><p>\n\nYou took turns in first and second, constantly getting power-ups and passing each other. None of the computer players were anywhere close from the moment the race started, but both of you knew they weren\u2019t the competition. Near the end, Peter used the heavy weight of his character and pushed your light-weight character off the track, causing you to lose enough precious time that there was no way you\u2019d catch him in the last quarter-lap. Sure enough, he crossed the finish line first and quickly seized the opportunity to gloat.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI win, you lose, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha,\u201d he sang in the same tune you had, mocking your enthusiasm from before.</p><p>\n\nWithout skipping a beat, you whipped around to face him. \u201cBest two-out-of-three!\u201d Playful grins spreading on both your faces, he set up another race.</p><p>\n\nYou took turns winning race after race, upping the stakes more and more until finally you nearly did every race in the game. He\u2019d win one, you\u2019d win two, he\u2019d win two, you\u2019d win one \u2013 it went on and on until finally you slumped back on the couch and closed your eyes.</p><p>\n\n\u201cPeter, I think we\u2019re even,\u201d you said, hoping he\u2019d agree.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right. Are you comfy there?\u201d He kicked your foot a little, teasing you for completely spreading out like a starfish.</p><p>\n\nYou didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYes, quite comfy, actually.\u201d</p><p>\n\nHe snagged a blanket from another chair and threw it at you, expecting you to jump up. But again, you didn\u2019t flinch, and just laid peacefully with the blanket now draped over your whole body. He laughed again and stepped over to you, pulling only the top of the blanket by your head back and peaking under so he could see your face.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWANNA WATCH A MOVIE?\u201d You nearly shouted when his face appeared at the top of the blanket. He leapt back in shock and nearly fell over the coffee table but recovered his balance just in time. You pulled back the rest of the blanket, laughing so hard there was no sound coming out and you were nearly in tears.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou scared me\u2026<i>so badly\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>\n\n\u201cYeah, I know. So, what movie do you want to watch?\u201d You continued laughing and readjusted yourself on the couch. It was only 10:30, which was late for you, but you figured there would be noise in the compound until midnight.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHmm. What\u2019s your favorite movie?\u201d Peter sat back down on the couch right next to you.</p><p>\n\n \u201cI haven\u2019t really seen many movies; I don\u2019t know if I have a favorite. Most of the ones I got to watch were animated kids\u2019 movies,\u201d you confided, slinking back into the couch as you spoke. You weren\u2019t embarrassed about it, but everything had been going so well with Peter and you didn\u2019t want that to change. The last thing you wanted to do was say the wrong thing.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Peter twisted himself on the couch to face you and froze. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019ve at least seen <i>Star Wars?\u201d</i> You shook your head, suddenly concerned he wouldn\u2019t like you or something because of it.</p><p>\n\n\u201cNO WAY. We have to watch it. Right now.\u201d His eyes danced with excitement completely contrary to what you expected. \u201cMaybe all of them. You have to see them. I\u2019m going to watch every single one of them with you and we\u2019re starting right now.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cAll of them? How many are there?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cWell, seven currently. Six original, a new one came out in 2015, and the one after that comes out this December, and the one after that comes out in 2019! Plus, there\u2019s a spin-off movie that came out in 2016\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cHang on. That\u2019s a lot of movies. It\u2019s 10:30, Peter. What\u2019s the first one?\u201d</p><p>\n\n<i>\u201cEpisode IV.\u201d</i></p><p>\n\n\u201cWell that makes no sense,\u201d you mocked as he grabbed your arm and shook you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cTRUST ME, PLEASE Y/N!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cOk! Ok! Calm down, Peter, I\u2019ll watch your war of the stars movie,\u201d you teased, smirking at how exasperated he seemed with you calling the series you did in fact know the name of by the wrong name. \u201cJARVIS, can you play <i>Star Wars: Episode IV,</i> please?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cRight away, Miss.\u201d The TV screen switched off from Mario Kart before showing the opening credits of the movie.</p><p>\n\n\u201cOh my gosh! This is important, you have to read this,\u201d Peter exclaimed, sitting back down next to you. You just looked at him and smiled at the boy pointing at the screen, so passionate about this movie.</p><p>\n\n\u201cY/N, I told you, you have to read this!\u201d He could feel your eyes on him and turned to look, his voice sounding nearly frustrated. You immediately burst out laughing.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou, you goofball! You\u2019re so excited!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cOf course I am! I get to sit with you and see you enjoy my favorite movies for the first time!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cOk, that&rsquo;s pretty sweet,\u201d you admitted.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThank you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cI guess I understand why you\u2019re being a dork.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cHey\u2014\u201d he started, but you were grinning wildly and already rewinding the movie to go back to the start. He sighed, content now, and sat facing forward again right next to you while the opening credits rolled for real. He looked over at you again, staring at your eyes. And this time, you were reading. Every single word.</p><hr><p>\n\n\n\nBack down at the gala, Tony felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He excused himself and stepped outside. Looking down at his phone again, he couldn\u2019t figure out why the Secretary of State himself would be calling <i>him</i> of all people, especially so late on a Saturday.</p><p>\n\nHappy let him through the main doors and he traced the path back to the common room as he answered. <i>Might as well check on the lovebirds,</i> he thought as he hit accept on the call.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cTony Stark, good to hear your voice.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cI wish I could say the same, Ross,\u201d Tony sassed.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI have some news for you and your gang, Stark, and I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to like it,\u201d Thaddeus Ross explained. Tony reached the common room now and smiled seeing it illuminated by a movie he instantly recognized.</p><p>\n\n\u201cGiven the events that occurred in Sokovia, the United Nations has decided that powers such as your Avengers need to be kept in check. We\u2019re giving you an ultimatum.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cSorry to burst your bubble, but we aren\u2019t going to propose to you any time soon.\u201d Tony stepped around the couch and, despite the tension he felt through the phone and the straightforward dislike he had for the man he was talking too, his heart warmed at seeing you and Peter on the couch. After the movie started, you had quickly dozed off, losing control of your head on Peter\u2019s shoulder. Peter trying his best not to squirm and upset you, somehow got his phone out of his pocket and texted Ned. He didn\u2019t want to move you, though, and ended up falling asleep himself and his head had dropped on top of yours.</p><p>\n\nRoss\u2019 voice on the other end of the line snapped Tony back to reality. I\u2019ll tease them in the morning, he decided. \u201cWe have a proposal for <i>you,</i> actually. It goes like this: either you sign some accords we\u2019ve written up and agree to only be dispatched when the United Nations deems necessary,\u201d he started while Tony grabbed the blanket on the floor that Peter had thrown at you earlier. \u201cOr you become criminals.\u201d Trying to avoid the crisis on the phone, Tony draped the blanket over you and Peter and leaned down to kiss your forehead. You shifted as he stepped back from you and he worried he woke you up, but instead you snuggled further into Peter\u2019s side and brought a smile to Tony\u2019s face.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to like this,\u201d Tony said into the phone.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Ross replied. \u201cI\u2019ll be there with the documents tomorrow for your team to make a decision.\u201d</p><p>\n\nWith that, the call clicked off. Tony could sense there would be disagreements about what was about to take place with these so-called accords and hoped that none of it would impact either of you kids. Ignoring the problem he would have to confront tomorrow, he switched his phone to camera and took a quick picture of you and Peter, being sure to send it to all the Avengers (yourselves included) before cautiously heading back to end the party. \n</p>\n\n<p><b>taglist: </b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4U3Qv6EybA2SJYW6mZO5fQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starksnack</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzv9-KqY2nwVns3bh-ocUTA\" target=\"_blank\">@hollandbabesblog</a></p>\n\n<center><p><a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/184632134053/in-my-way-7\" target=\"_blank\">previous chapter (7)</a> | <a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/181672022943/inmyway\" target=\"_blank\">series masterlist</a> | <a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/184956278498/in-my-way-9\" target=\"_blank\"> next chapter (9)</a></p></center>\n\n<center><p><a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/181671397318/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">masterlist</a> | <a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">taglist</a></p></center>",

She told you she would do your hair and makeup for the gala so that all you had to do was get dressed when it was time. While you were excited to get totally dressed up, she was definitely more excited than you were. Wouldn\u2019t it be more fun to stay in pajamas and hang out with friends?\n</p>[[MORE]]<p>Your phone dinged right as you set your feet on the coffee table. It was a text from MJ asking about your \u201cplans\u201d for the night. Keeping up with the spirit of the previous week, she kept digging for details about you and Peter ever since she and Ned heard you were going to the gala together. You explained multiple times that it was just Tony being Tony, but they wouldn\u2019t hear it.</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> soooooo what\u2019s the plan</p>\n\n<p><b>You:</b> Well, I think Tony said the dinner officially starts at 7 but doors open at 6 so we\u2019re going then!</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> no no. what\u2019s the PLAN plan</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> you know what I mean ;)</p><p>\n\nSure, you knew what she meant. And sure, part of you wished you had a plan. But you didn\u2019t, because you weren\u2019t going to do anything. You barely knew him, anyway. The only reason he was going with you was because Tony was making him. Nothing else.</p>\n\n<p><b>You:</b> Lol MJ, I\u2019ve told you a thousand times. No \u201cplan\u201d</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> suit yourself. but when your eyes meet across the dance floor and you fall in love, remember that I told you so</p>\n\n<p><b>You:</b> Fine. I don\u2019t even think there is a dance floor. But if somehow our lives become a fairy tale then I\u2019ll thank you.</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> you\u2019re welcome.</p><p>\n\n\u201cY/N? You ready?\u201d Pepper\u2019s heels clicked on the floor as she walked up to you. With a smile and nod you stood up and followed her, wondering all the while how she spent all day in heels without her feet hurting. <i>And now she had to wear heels to a gala, too? Insane.</i></p>\n\n<p>Pepper led you to the bedroom she shared with Tony and then into her bathroom, which was completely prepped and ready for you. There were hair tools laid out all across the left side of the counter and makeup all over the right side.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always a mess \u2013 I promise,\u201d Pepper reassured you, though you didn\u2019t doubt it. \u201cI just have everything laid out so you can see your options.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t really\u2026know? I have no idea what would look good on me or with the dress or for this occasion or anything. But I do trust your judgement,\u201d you sputtered. It was true \u2013 you had seen pictures and things from previous events like the gala tonight but coming up with looks like that was completely foreign to you.</p><p>\n\nPepper stepped back and squinted at your hair and face. She had a pretty good idea of you by now, both in terms of personality and in terms of what you were comfortable with. She wouldn\u2019t go crazy, obviously, but devised a classy yet youthful \u2013 had to stick with the princess vibes \u2013 look for you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI do have an idea, yes.\u201d She ushered you over to a chair and grabbed something you didn\u2019t recognize from the makeup side of the counter. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like it, but before I start, are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cAm I sure if I trust the extraordinarily stylish Pepper Potts to dress me for an event?\u201d You giggled, bringing a smile to her face as well. \u201cYes, of course I do! Make me pretty, pretty please.\u201d</p><p>\n\nShe stepped in front of you and started applying product to your face. \u201cYou\u2019re already pretty,\u201d she whispered, cupping your cheek as you grinned at her until she grabbed the next product.</p><hr><p>\n\nWearing makeup was\u2026weird. It made your face feel hot and it was so strange seeing black around the edge of your eyelids from the mascara on your eyelashes. You stopped noticing it after a few minutes, but it was a strange adjustment. Stranger still was having your hair curled. That curling iron was hot. But it was also an odd sensation to look down and see your hair shorter than normal because the curls eliminated some of the length.</p><p>\n\nPepper rolled up, held, and let go one last curl, then sprayed your head with a little bit of hairspray to make sure it would hold. Finally, she handed you your dress and told you to go put it on while she got herself ready. You tiptoed back to your room down the hall, not wanting to attract the attention of any other Avengers in their rooms getting ready. Though Pepper said you were pretty \u2013 both naturally and with the hair and makeup she did for you \u2013 it felt strange looking as you did. Having those who saw you dripping sweat on a daily basis see you look so different was a bit of an uncomfortable thought.</p><p>\n\nLuckily, you made it back to your room unseen and pulled the dress out from your closet and off the hanger. It zipped on easily, just as it had the previous night, but that didn\u2019t mean it was comfortable. <i>Oh, how I miss my t-shirt and shorts,</i> you thought, the idea only reinforced as you slipped on the heels from a box in your closet. You attached the clasp of the second shoe and stood up just as a knock sounded on the door and Pepper\u2019s voice on the other side asked if she could come in.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYes, please \u2013 I think I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou smoothed the front of your dress as she cracked the door and slid into the room with you. Her jaw simultaneously dropped as a smile formed on her face; she was equally stunned and proud of how grown up you seemed.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou look amazing, sweetheart,\u201d she said, closing the distance between you to give you a hug. Though you were still new to the compound, Tony calling you \u201ckiddo,\u201d and Pepper calling you \u201csweetheart,\u201d felt extremely comfortable. On top of that, it made your heart swell.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThanks to you, and \u2013 might I add \u2013 so do you!\u201d You spoke softly into her ear as she still held you, now laughing over your shoulder. She stepped back, her hands resting on your shoulders as she looked you in the eyes. \u201cThank you. But have you actually seen yourself?\u201d</p><p>\n\nShaking your head, she grabbed your hand and pulled you to the floor-length mirror you used to look at yourself in the dress just one night earlier. But this time, the rest of the picture was complete, and the shock in your eyes showed it. You looked like yourself \u2013 she hadn\u2019t done anything too dramatic \u2013 but still so different.</p><p>\n\n\u201cStunning, huh?\u201d Pepper teased. She opened the door and stepped out into the hallway, leaning back in through the cracked door to say one last thing. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, come to the common room and we\u2019ll all head down to the gala as a group, ok?\u201d With that, she left you alone.</p><p>\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much else for you to do besides mentally panic. You looked totally different. <i>Is it stunning? Is it weird?</i> You didn\u2019t know. <i>What will Peter think?</i> You forgot about Peter. <i>Did he like your usual look? Would he hate this new look? Would he like this one better? </i>Who knew? Before you could delve too much further into the whirlpool of questions, you walked out of your room and to the common room, where only Pepper and Tony stood so far.</p><p>\n\n\u201cLook at my little girl! All grown up,\u201d Tony joked, giving you a hug. Almost identical to Pepper, as he pulled away, he rested his hands on your arms. \u201cBut really, you look beautiful, kiddo. Underoos isn\u2019t going to know what hit him.\u201d</p><p>\n\n<i>Underoos?</i></p><p>\n\n\u201cYou called?\u201d Peter piped up, now slowly approaching from the top of the stairs behind you with a quick wave. Tony\u2019s hands fell from arms and you turned to face Peter, who immediately slowed as if his walking was stuttering instead of his voice. He instantly reddened, trying \u2013 and failing \u2013 to look at the floor (or anywhere else, really).</p><p>\n\n\u201cHi, Peter,\u201d you breathed. He was more visibly nervous than you but that didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t nervous at all. He looked good, too, and that didn\u2019t help your case. He now stood a few feet in front of you, hands fidgeting and barely reaching out from the sleeves of his <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiJ1pPWUEAAXzU2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">dark navy suit</a> that perfectly matched your dress. He wore a crisp, light blue button-down shirt underneath and his tie was striped with different shades of navy. His dress shoes were about as shiny as a pair of dress shoes could be \u2013 from what you knew about his aunt, you guessed she probably wouldn\u2019t have let him leave the house unless they were perfect.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHi, Y/N\u2026you\u2026you look\u2014<i>beautiful,\u201d</i> he said, trying to breathe.</p><p>\n\n\u201cAw, young love. Well, shall we go to the party?\u201d Tony held out his arm for Pepper, who gladly took it and followed him down the hallway toward the end of the compound where the gala was being hosted. \u201cCome along, kids, we are the ones hosting this event and should probably be there on time!\u201d</p><p>\n\nPepper grinned and lightly punched him, wanting to give you and Peter space. When you turned back to Peter, he was cautiously holding his arm out to you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cShall we?\u201d He asked with an edgy giggle, feeling silly but going along with Tony\u2019s antics. You took his arm just as Pepper had Tony\u2019s and the two of you sped along to catch up to the adults.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou look really good, too, you know,\u201d you whispered, leaning slightly toward Peter as you walked but keeping your eyes forward. When he looked at you, however, you could feel it. You could feel his eyes and had to look back at him and the cheesy smile plastered across his face.</p><p>\n\nThat is, until you tripped on your dress and nearly took a tumble.</p><p>\n\n<i>Curse this long dress and tall shoes and\u2026ugh,</i> you thought as Peter\u2019s arm that was leading you kept you from hitting the ground face first. Luckily neither Pepper nor Tony heard and they both kept walking, but Peter stopped and grabbed your other hand to get you back up and on your feet.</p><p>\n\n\u201cY/N! You ok?\u201d he murmured as he helped you get oriented again. You took a deep breath, closing your eyes for half a second to try and calm your embarrassment. But, if you really thought about it, you weren\u2019t embarrassed. Before you could push the impulse back down, you snorted with laughter opening your eyes to see Peter\u2019s worried face fading into giggles to match your own. As soon as he knew everything was ok, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh along with you as you got back to walking to the gala.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m such a klutz,\u201d you joked. \u201cPepper wears this stuff all the time and I can\u2019t even walk for five seconds without nearly wiping out!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m surprised it wasn\u2019t me who fell first. A little thankful, I have to admit.\u201d You rolled your eyes at him but still giggled thinking about it. \u201cTrust me though, I will fall at some point. And my shoes are way easier to walk in than yours!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cNo way the famous <i>Spider-man</i> is clumsy. No way.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\n\nThe four of you reached a large set of doors guarded by none other than Happy Hogan. He gave you a quick smile and wave, gave Peter a wave \u2013 sans smile, to Peter\u2019s dismay \u2013 and opened the door for Tony to make his entrance.</p><p>\n\nThankfully, there weren\u2019t very many people arriving yet. The main doors had only just opened and people were quickly filtering in. Once Happy safely got you all inside, he showed you to your table and excused himself to return to security duties.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWhile everyone is arriving, let\u2019s get a quick picture, and then we\u2019ll stick together so I can introduce you all to some people. Then we can split up and par-tay! But not too hard, of course. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou nodded at Tony and followed him, arm still linked with Peter\u2019s, as he first walked over to the photo backdrop. The group took turns getting various pictures and, as requested, Peter got one with you. He put his arm around you and you put yours around him, surprised by how comfortable it felt. Of course, Tony had to jump in and up the ante, so he grabbed the hand you had on your hip and put it on Peter\u2019s chest like in tacky prom pictures. You felt a little silly but relaxed with the fact that you could feel Peter\u2019s heart pounding underneath your hand. You weren\u2019t sure why that brought you comfort, but something about knowing he was also nervous calmed your own nerves. Unbeknownst to you, though his heart was pounding, Peter was on cloud nine.</p><p>\n\nLeaving the pictures, Tony led everyone away and walked up to a man in a sharp military suit. He then pulled you forward and away from Peter to introduce you to his good friend, Sir Colonel James Rhodes, who immediately corrected his friend with a sigh and told you to call him James or Rhodey or whatever you were comfortable with.</p><p>\n\nBehind you, Peter took a second to text Ned. Though he wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about his friends gossiping about you and him <i>together</i> at the gala, he promised he\u2019d keep his friend up to date. Plus, he needed all the support he could get.</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Dude. I\u2019m in way over my head</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> What do you mean? Are there villains there? Are you in a super fight?</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b>  What? No. Remember when I said I was in trouble?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> Oh, yeah? Because you realized Y/N was perfect and you looooove her?</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> NED! Ok. I admit, she\u2019s incredible. But you have to chill. I need help, she looks amazing and I keep blabbering and Mr. Stark keeps making comments about young love?! What do I do?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> Woah. This is the big leagues. Have you talked to Y/N much?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> You gotta hold her hand, man. Girls love that stuff.</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Barely, we walked arm in arm for a bit? And she tripped and I caught her? And she keeps smiling and I don\u2019t know if I can do this Ned</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Wait, how do you know what girls love?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> I get around, Pete. I have my ways.</p><p>\n\nBefore Peter could type up a reply, Tony pulled him forward to say hi to Rhodey, who he had previously met. Tony quickly whisked them away to person after person, bragging about you to each and every one. You kept trying to sneak back behind Tony and Pepper to hang out with Peter. As much as you loved Tony boasting about you and saying how proud he is (you couldn\u2019t get enough of it, to be honest), you also wanted to hang out with your friend.</p><p>\n\nHappy tapped on Tony\u2019s shoulder and whispered in his ear, then quickly strutted off.</p><p>\n\n\u201cAh! Time for us to go sit down, and I believe I have a mini-speech to make,\u201d he announced to your small group, directing you toward the table. As you sat down, a woman tapped on the microphone and asked everyone to take their seats. You sat with Peter on your left and Tony and Pepper adjacent to him. You were about to ask Pepper who else would be sitting at the table when someone answered for her.</p><p>\n\n\u201cExcuse me, miss, is this seat taken?\u201d</p><p>\n\nSteve stood just behind you, goofy grin on his face and hand on the back of the chair to your right.</p><p>\n\n\u201cOnly by you!\u201d you exclaimed, jumping up to give him a quick hug.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou look great, kid, and not in the fighting way this time,\u201d he whispered, looking over your shoulder at Peter seated behind you. \u201cSpider-boy is a lucky man.\u201d He leaned back and winked as he sat down, chuckling when you rolled your eyes with a smile.</p><p>\n\nGoing around the circle, next to Steve sat Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, Clint Barton, a woman you didn\u2019t recognize (Steve later told you it was Clint\u2019s wife, Laura), Thor, and Rhodey, who sat next to Pepper. Then there was, of course, Tony, Peter, and you. As the seats started to fill in, your eyes kept widening, as did Peter\u2019s. Once everyone was seated, you turned and looked at Peter with your jaw nearly on the floor. Sure, you had seen all of these superheroes around the compound, but to sit and have a fancy dinner with them? That was new.</p><p>\n\n<i>\u201cPeter,\u201d</i> you hissed, trying to get his attention from the Avengers seated around him. He turned to you, eyes just as wide as yours and brimming with delight.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThis is crazy\u2026we\u2019re at a dinner with the <i>Avengers!\u201d</i> you whispered, unable to contain your own excitement.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI know! And we\u2019re kind of friends with them?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but joke with you, clearly just as shocked by the arrangement. \u201cWhat even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\nHe was stopped by the lady at the front tapping on the microphone again and announcing the event. As Tony was introduced, the two of you couldn\u2019t help but be bored \u2013 you were only teenagers, after all \u2013 and resorted to playing <i>I Spy</i> under your breath until Tony got up to speak.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWelcome, welcome, and thank you for being here,\u201d he began. \u201cYes, I\u2019m Tony Stark, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d He paused again \u2013 ever commanding of attention \u2013 while the crowd broke out in laughter. Everyone at your table, however, rolled their eyes at his classically cocky behavior.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI think we all want to get right to it \u2013 there\u2019s food! And a party to be had! So, without further ado, thank you again for sponsoring <i>Stark Industries</i> and I hope that you enjoy this evening as much as I will!\u201d</p><p>\n\nWith a bow, he exited the stage and plopped back down in his seat between Peter and Pepper. Dinners were quickly served but Tony jumped up again.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI would like to make a toast,\u201d he declared to the table. Pepper shook her head and turned to Rhodey as he sighed. <i>\u201cStark Industries</i> has had a great year, sure, but so have the Avengers.\u201d Everyone nodded along now, far more invested in this message. \u201cWe\u2019ve celebrated that already \u2013 shout-out to shwarma \u2013 but I would also like to give a little shout-out to our little ones joining the team for stepping right into some big shoes. You\u2019ve both impressed me each and every step along the way and I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of trouble we\u2019ll have to bail you out of down the line. But just remember, the Avengers have your back. And you clearly have each other\u2019s backs. But you don\u2019t know that yet. I digress. Cheers!\u201d</p><p>\n\nPepper lightly punched him again as everyone raised their glasses and toasted. You and Peter raised your water glasses \u2013 which would have embarrassed you enough \u2013 but now Tony had to tease you in front of everyone. If you were honest with yourself, you couldn\u2019t say you hated it; anything that gave Peter a hint might help your case. But in the meantime, it was making you so incredibly nervous.</p><p>\n\nAs everyone dug into their meals, Steve pointed out to you twice how Tony kept leaning down to Peter and telling him something. Both times, Peter would weakly smile, nod, and continue eating while his eyes darted your direction. Every time Steve teased you, it reinforced his words from the previous day.<i> \u201cIf you are interested - and you don\u2019t have to be! But\u2026if you are\u2026just know that it definitely isn\u2019t unrequited,\u201d</i> he told you. <i>Was he right?</i> Peter did seem nervous. <i>But that very well could be because he\u2019s surrounded by his idols,</i> you reminded yourself.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI have a bit of a bone to pick with some of you,\u201d Clint professed, drawing the attention of everyone at the table. \u201cNot exactly a bone to pick. More of a little friendly teasing. So, how is it that our hundred-year-old super soldier, decorated military colonel, and literal god of thunder don\u2019t have girls by their sides, but our little spider-boy does? I mean, come on! And I mean no offense to you, Spidey, I\u2019m impressed!\u201d He slow clapped at Peter as those not being called out laughed with him. Peter blushed and nodded, eyes coming up to meet yours only briefly as you played along with their banter.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as much the ladies that should be rewarded,\u201d Natasha reminded him with a smirk, looking straight at you. \u201cAs usual, kudos to you, kid.\u201d</p><p>\n\nSteve patted you on the back as you sighed, realizing it was your turn to be embarrassed and teased by the table. These Avengers sure did like to take advantage of having kids around to poke fun at.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHow are you settling in? School going well?\u201d Bruce asked you, far more serious than any of the others.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going well and I\u2019m really loving it here,\u201d you reflected. \u201cI love training \u2013 Nat and Steve keep it very difficult for me,\u201d they grinned at you, not letting you say that without reminding you how successful you had been so far. \u201cAnd Peter has been really helpful at school\u2014\u201d you felt your gaze look over to him. He faced your conversation rather than the one on the other side of the table and seemed to hang on your every word. \u201cI\u2019ve been really thankful to have him,\u201d you finally pulled your stare from Peter\u2019s to look back at Bruce. \u201cPlus, Tony let me try out a suit yesterday and it was one of the most amazing things ever!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou did?\u201d Peter prodded your shoulder to get your attention back. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing! It went well? You had fun?\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou couldn\u2019t help but think back to the first week you met him and how he felt threatened by you joining the team. Whatever changed to make him this supportive friend now sitting by your side doing nothing but encouraging you\u2026you couldn\u2019t deny that it brought butterflies to your stomach.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt was incredible,\u201d you explained, trying not to focus on Peter despite your mind being drawn to him. \u201cIt was like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced before\u2026<i>obviously,\u201d</i> you joked, making everyone listening laugh along with you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cNow, Y/N, I know a little bit from what Tony told us before you arrived, but remind me again about what you were doing before Tony found you?\u201d Bruce asked.</p><p>\n\nFor some reason, the question made you uncertain. You hadn\u2019t thought about everyone back home and how they were probably all still doing the same thing and in the same routine as when you left just a few weeks ago. That easily could\u2019ve been you if Tony had picked one of the other millions of kids around the country, let alone the world. You couldn\u2019t put your finger on all the reasons, but the thought made you a bit uncomfortable. Thankful, but uncomfortable.</p><p>\n\nPeter\u2019s spidey sense started going off quietly and, while he first looked around for trouble, he quickly realized it was you. He wasn\u2019t in your head and didn\u2019t know the exact cause but pieced together that something about Bruce\u2019s question hit a sore subject. No one else seemed to pick up on it, however, and everyone patiently awaited your answer.</p><p>\n\nPeter could only explain what happened next as a result of the spidey sense amping up his adrenaline. His mind flashed back to Ned\u2019s advice: <i>\u201cyou gotta hold her hand, man. Girls love that stuff.\u201d</i> As that piece of information crashed together with the sense that you were nervous, he covertly reached his hand out and held your two hands that you were fidgeting with in your lap.</p><p>\n\nAs his warm and, slightly clammy hand (so were yours, though \u2013 you couldn\u2019t blame him) wrapped around yours, your eyes followed his arm up his sleeve to see him looking at you with the same smile and encouraging gaze from earlier. Your doe eyes stared at his puppy-dog ones that somehow reassured you as he nodded. You didn\u2019t know how he knew you were uncomfortable or really understand any of what just happened, but that didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t a little excited about it.</p><p>  \n\nThankfully everything took place in a matter of seconds and you answered Bruce\u2019s original question quickly enough for all the nerves and the hand-holding and other little things to go unnoticed by the adults. As you answered that first question and all those after it, Peter\u2019s hand never left yours. He even gave the occasional squeeze when his spidey sense kicked up a little higher. He figured it meant whatever they asked was a topic you were more anxious talking about and wanted to be there for support. He could sense you relaxing into it and eventually holding his hand back as you spoke, giving him his own butterflies. Most of all, a voice in the back of his head was telling him he owed Ned. <i>Big time.</i></p><p>\n\nMany conversations and laughs later, the clock struck 9 and Tony announced it was time to get the real party part of the night started. He repeated the announcement on stage into the microphone, receiving applause of course, and then returned to the table.</p><p>\n\nTony turned to you and Peter as he sat back down. \u201cThe bar is opening up, so children, you are now excused.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou both stared at him; you had no idea what he was trying to tell you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI figured you\u2019d rather go upstairs and watch a movie or something than hang out with a bunch of drinking adults? Since you can\u2019t drink and all? I mean, I\u2019m a cool dad and I\u2019d let you have a sip, but you\u2019re not old enough for open bar, you know?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but tease. \u201cPeter, you\u2019re welcome to stay the night or go home, whatever you want, just tell JARVIS so we make sure you get home safe if needed. You\u2019re a superhero but you\u2019re also a baby.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou and Peter glanced at each other, slightly confused, and got up to leave. Everyone said goodnight and wished you sweet dreams while you stood. Steve gave you a fist-bump, whispering, \u201cgo get \u2018em,\u201d as you turned to go.</p><p>\n\nHappy, guarding the door through which you initially entered, let you back into the secure part of the compound. You walked down the same hall you tripped in a few hours ago with Peter still by your side, the two of you sharing a somehow comfortable silence as he walked with his hands in his pockets and eyes watching his shoes.</p><p>\n\n\u201cAre\u2026are you going to stay?\u201d You asked, curious if you\u2019d be by yourself and going to sleep soon or if you\u2019d get to hang out a bit longer.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI, uh\u2026yeah? If you want me to?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cYeah, we could hang out for a little bit?\u201d You laughed to yourself as you kept walking, finding it funny how you clearly wanted him to stay but spoke as if it was a question. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to change, though, because as you know I can barely walk in this.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so relieved to hear you say that. I did not want to wear all these layers any longer,\u201d Peter confessed, loosening his tie and smiling as the tension started melting away.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d You stopped in place; your head tilted to the side. Peter stopped just a step in front of you and turned back. You reached your hand out and placed it on his shoulder closest to you. Peter panicked in that moment; all the air left his lungs as he had no idea what you planned to do.</p><p>\n\nSure enough, you kicked your foot up and slipped off one shoe after the other, relying on him for balance. Feet no planted on the floor, you sighed with relief. \u201cMuch better,\u201d you exclaimed with a giggle, pulling your hand back and picking your dress up with the hand not holding your shoes to keep walking.</p><p>\n\nPeter let out a breath he didn\u2019t realize he was holding and caught up with you, now laughing at how dramatic that was. The two of you split up when you reach your rooms, which, coincidentally, were right across the hall from each other - and changed out of your gala clothes and into pajamas. You pulled on a fuzzy <i>Stark Industries</i> sweatshirt and your favorite, patterned Iron Man pajama shorts.</p><p>\n\nOn the other side of the door, Peter had finished changing and was heading back to the common room. Like you, he opted for a sweatshirt and shorts, but instead pulled on Midtown gear. In the brief second he had alone, he pulled out his phone to at least 20 texts from Ned, all asking how it was going and if you and Peter were married yet. <i>Oh, Ned,</i> he thought.</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Ned. Did you get my message saying chill? We just left the gala and are hanging out just the two of us upstairs</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Btw? Hand-holding? Money!!!</p><p>\n\nYou walked into the common room before Ned could reply, but Peter felt his phone buzz once, twice, thrice \u2013 too many times to count. Peter sat down on the couch while you walked into the kitchen, offering snacks. When you brought the popcorn back, you sat down on the same couch as Peter but with a cushion in between you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to do? Game? Movie? Other?\u201d Peter chastised himself. <i>Why would I throw out \u2018other?\u2019 That\u2019s so weird!</i></p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up for whatever,\u201d you confided. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure what all our options are, but if we go the game route, you should know that I\u2019m very, very competitive.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see it,\u201d Peter teased, setting up some video game while you dug into the popcorn. With JARVIS\u2019 help, he eventually got Mario Kart up and running and showed you how to play.</p><p>\n\nHe started you off easy, helping you pick your character and bike so you wouldn\u2019t be totally at a loss. It only took you beating him once for him to switch gears and go from trying to be nice and flirty to trash-talking up a storm. But you\u2019d be lying if you said you didn\u2019t do the same.</p><p>\n\n\u201cTAKE THAT, LOSER!\u201d You yelled, jumping up on the couch as you threw a blue shell at his bike just a little bit up ahead. You could see the finish line on the last lap of Mushroom Gorge approaching and were not about to let him win.</p><p>\n\n\u201cNOOOOOOO!\u201d He screamed, his bike spinning out and slowly sputtering back up to speed as you whipped by him. Within seconds you crossed the finish line, jumping around the room as he finished the race in second.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI win, you lose, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha,\u201d you mocked as he grimaced and glared at you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI was being nice!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cExcuses, excuses, excuses\u2026<i>Avengers</i> don\u2019t make excuses,\u201d you teased, rubbing salt in the wound.</p><p>\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said coyly, a smirk growing on his face. \u201cRematch. Rainbow Road. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou hopped back into your spot on the couch while he started up the next race, accepting his challenge without hesitation. Before you knew it, the countdown started and you floored it immediately.</p><p>\n\nYou took turns in first and second, constantly getting power-ups and passing each other. None of the computer players were anywhere close from the moment the race started, but both of you knew they weren\u2019t the competition. Near the end, Peter used the heavy weight of his character and pushed your light-weight character off the track, causing you to lose enough precious time that there was no way you\u2019d catch him in the last quarter-lap. Sure enough, he crossed the finish line first and quickly seized the opportunity to gloat.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI win, you lose, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha,\u201d he sang in the same tune you had, mocking your enthusiasm from before.</p><p>\n\nWithout skipping a beat, you whipped around to face him. \u201cBest two-out-of-three!\u201d Playful grins spreading on both your faces, he set up another race.</p><p>\n\nYou took turns winning race after race, upping the stakes more and more until finally you nearly did every race in the game. He\u2019d win one, you\u2019d win two, he\u2019d win two, you\u2019d win one \u2013 it went on and on until finally you slumped back on the couch and closed your eyes.</p><p>\n\n\u201cPeter, I think we\u2019re even,\u201d you said, hoping he\u2019d agree.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right. Are you comfy there?\u201d He kicked your foot a little, teasing you for completely spreading out like a starfish.</p><p>\n\nYou didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYes, quite comfy, actually.\u201d</p><p>\n\nHe snagged a blanket from another chair and threw it at you, expecting you to jump up. But again, you didn\u2019t flinch, and just laid peacefully with the blanket now draped over your whole body. He laughed again and stepped over to you, pulling only the top of the blanket by your head back and peaking under so he could see your face.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWANNA WATCH A MOVIE?\u201d You nearly shouted when his face appeared at the top of the blanket. He leapt back in shock and nearly fell over the coffee table but recovered his balance just in time. You pulled back the rest of the blanket, laughing so hard there was no sound coming out and you were nearly in tears.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou scared me\u2026<i>so badly\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>\n\n\u201cYeah, I know. So, what movie do you want to watch?\u201d You continued laughing and readjusted yourself on the couch. It was only 10:30, which was late for you, but you figured there would be noise in the compound until midnight.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHmm. What\u2019s your favorite movie?\u201d Peter sat back down on the couch right next to you.</p><p>\n\n \u201cI haven\u2019t really seen many movies; I don\u2019t know if I have a favorite. Most of the ones I got to watch were animated kids\u2019 movies,\u201d you confided, slinking back into the couch as you spoke. You weren\u2019t embarrassed about it, but everything had been going so well with Peter and you didn\u2019t want that to change. The last thing you wanted to do was say the wrong thing.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Peter twisted himself on the couch to face you and froze. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019ve at least seen <i>Star Wars?\u201d</i> You shook your head, suddenly concerned he wouldn\u2019t like you or something because of it.</p><p>\n\n\u201cNO WAY. We have to watch it. Right now.\u201d His eyes danced with excitement completely contrary to what you expected. \u201cMaybe all of them. You have to see them. I\u2019m going to watch every single one of them with you and we\u2019re starting right now.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cAll of them? How many are there?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cWell, seven currently. Six original, a new one came out in 2015, and the one after that comes out this December, and the one after that comes out in 2019! Plus, there\u2019s a spin-off movie that came out in 2016\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cHang on. That\u2019s a lot of movies. It\u2019s 10:30, Peter. What\u2019s the first one?\u201d</p><p>\n\n<i>\u201cEpisode IV.\u201d</i></p><p>\n\n\u201cWell that makes no sense,\u201d you mocked as he grabbed your arm and shook you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cTRUST ME, PLEASE Y/N!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cOk! Ok! Calm down, Peter, I\u2019ll watch your war of the stars movie,\u201d you teased, smirking at how exasperated he seemed with you calling the series you did in fact know the name of by the wrong name. \u201cJARVIS, can you play <i>Star Wars: Episode IV,</i> please?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cRight away, Miss.\u201d The TV screen switched off from Mario Kart before showing the opening credits of the movie.</p><p>\n\n\u201cOh my gosh! This is important, you have to read this,\u201d Peter exclaimed, sitting back down next to you. You just looked at him and smiled at the boy pointing at the screen, so passionate about this movie.</p><p>\n\n\u201cY/N, I told you, you have to read this!\u201d He could feel your eyes on him and turned to look, his voice sounding nearly frustrated. You immediately burst out laughing.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou, you goofball! You\u2019re so excited!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cOf course I am! I get to sit with you and see you enjoy my favorite movies for the first time!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cOk, that\u2019s pretty sweet,\u201d you admitted.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThank you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cI guess I understand why you\u2019re being a dork.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cHey\u2014\u201d he started, but you were grinning wildly and already rewinding the movie to go back to the start. He sighed, content now, and sat facing forward again right next to you while the opening credits rolled for real. He looked over at you again, staring at your eyes. And this time, you were reading. Every single word.</p><hr><p>\n\n\n\nBack down at the gala, Tony felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He excused himself and stepped outside. Looking down at his phone again, he couldn\u2019t figure out why the Secretary of State himself would be calling <i>him</i> of all people, especially so late on a Saturday.</p><p>\n\nHappy let him through the main doors and he traced the path back to the common room as he answered. <i>Might as well check on the lovebirds,</i> he thought as he hit accept on the call.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cTony Stark, good to hear your voice.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cI wish I could say the same, Ross,\u201d Tony sassed.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI have some news for you and your gang, Stark, and I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to like it,\u201d Thaddeus Ross explained. Tony reached the common room now and smiled seeing it illuminated by a movie he instantly recognized.</p><p>\n\n\u201cGiven the events that occurred in Sokovia, the United Nations has decided that powers such as your Avengers need to be kept in check. We\u2019re giving you an ultimatum.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cSorry to burst your bubble, but we aren\u2019t going to propose to you any time soon.\u201d Tony stepped around the couch and, despite the tension he felt through the phone and the straightforward dislike he had for the man he was talking too, his heart warmed at seeing you and Peter on the couch. After the movie started, you had quickly dozed off, losing control of your head on Peter\u2019s shoulder. Peter trying his best not to squirm and upset you, somehow got his phone out of his pocket and texted Ned. He didn\u2019t want to move you, though, and ended up falling asleep himself and his head had dropped on top of yours.</p><p>\n\nRoss\u2019 voice on the other end of the line snapped Tony back to reality. I\u2019ll tease them in the morning, he decided. \u201cWe have a proposal for <i>you,</i> actually. It goes like this: either you sign some accords we\u2019ve written up and agree to only be dispatched when the United Nations deems necessary,\u201d he started while Tony grabbed the blanket on the floor that Peter had thrown at you earlier. \u201cOr you become criminals.\u201d Trying to avoid the crisis on the phone, Tony draped the blanket over you and Peter and leaned down to kiss your forehead. You shifted as he stepped back from you and he worried he woke you up, but instead you snuggled further into Peter\u2019s side and brought a smile to Tony\u2019s face.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to like this,\u201d Tony said into the phone.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Ross replied. \u201cI\u2019ll be there with the documents tomorrow for your team to make a decision.\u201d</p><p>\n\nWith that, the call clicked off. Tony could sense there would be disagreements about what was about to take place with these so-called accords and hoped that none of it would impact either of you kids. Ignoring the problem he would have to confront tomorrow, he switched his phone to camera and took a quick picture of you and Peter, being sure to send it to all the Avengers (yourselves included) before cautiously heading back to end the party. \n</p>\n\n<p><b>taglist: </b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4U3Qv6EybA2SJYW6mZO5fQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starksnack</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzv9-KqY2nwVns3bh-ocUTA\" target=\"_blank\">@hollandbabesblog</a></p>\n\n<center><p><a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/184632134053/in-my-way-7\" target=\"_blank\">previous chapter (7)</a> | <a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/181672022943/inmyway\" target=\"_blank\">series masterlist</a> | <a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/184956278498/in-my-way-9\" target=\"_blank\"> next chapter (9)</a></p></center>\n\n<center><p><a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/181671397318/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">masterlist</a> | <a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">taglist</a></p></center></p>",

Strength training: done. Combat training: done. Shower: done. Lunch: done (and yummy, you might add).</p><p>\n\nAnother Saturday morning in the books, you plopped yourself down on the couch in the common room waiting for Pepper to come get you. She told you she would do your hair and makeup for the gala so that all you had to do was get dressed when it was time. While you were excited to get totally dressed up, she was definitely more excited than you were. Wouldn\u2019t it be more fun to stay in pajamas and hang out with friends?\n</p>[[MORE]]<p>Your phone dinged right as you set your feet on the coffee table. It was a text from MJ asking about your \u201cplans\u201d for the night. Keeping up with the spirit of the previous week, she kept digging for details about you and Peter ever since she and Ned heard you were going to the gala together. You explained multiple times that it was just Tony being Tony, but they wouldn\u2019t hear it.</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> soooooo what\u2019s the plan</p>\n\n<p><b>You:</b> Well, I think Tony said the dinner officially starts at 7 but doors open at 6 so we\u2019re going then!</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> no no. what\u2019s the PLAN plan</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> you know what I mean ;)</p><p>\n\nSure, you knew what she meant. And sure, part of you wished you had a plan. But you didn\u2019t, because you weren\u2019t going to do anything. You barely knew him, anyway. The only reason he was going with you was because Tony was making him. Nothing else.</p>\n\n<p><b>You:</b> Lol MJ, I\u2019ve told you a thousand times. No \u201cplan\u201d</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> suit yourself. but when your eyes meet across the dance floor and you fall in love, remember that I told you so</p>\n\n<p><b>You:</b> Fine. I don\u2019t even think there is a dance floor. But if somehow our lives become a fairy tale then I\u2019ll thank you.</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> you\u2019re welcome.</p><p>\n\n\u201cY/N? You ready?\u201d Pepper\u2019s heels clicked on the floor as she walked up to you. With a smile and nod you stood up and followed her, wondering all the while how she spent all day in heels without her feet hurting. <i>And now she had to wear heels to a gala, too? Insane.</i></p>\n\n<p>Pepper led you to the bedroom she shared with Tony and then into her bathroom, which was completely prepped and ready for you. There were hair tools laid out all across the left side of the counter and makeup all over the right side.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always a mess \u2013 I promise,\u201d Pepper reassured you, though you didn\u2019t doubt it. \u201cI just have everything laid out so you can see your options.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t really\u2026know? I have no idea what would look good on me or with the dress or for this occasion or anything. But I do trust your judgement,\u201d you sputtered. It was true \u2013 you had seen pictures and things from previous events like the gala tonight but coming up with looks like that was completely foreign to you.</p><p>\n\nPepper stepped back and squinted at your hair and face. She had a pretty good idea of you by now, both in terms of personality and in terms of what you were comfortable with. She wouldn\u2019t go crazy, obviously, but devised a classy yet youthful \u2013 had to stick with the princess vibes \u2013 look for you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI do have an idea, yes.\u201d She ushered you over to a chair and grabbed something you didn\u2019t recognize from the makeup side of the counter. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like it, but before I start, are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cAm I sure if I trust the extraordinarily stylish Pepper Potts to dress me for an event?\u201d You giggled, bringing a smile to her face as well. \u201cYes, of course I do! Make me pretty, pretty please.\u201d</p><p>\n\nShe stepped in front of you and started applying product to your face. \u201cYou\u2019re already pretty,\u201d she whispered, cupping your cheek as you grinned at her until she grabbed the next product.</p><hr><p>\n\nWearing makeup was\u2026weird. It made your face feel hot and it was so strange seeing black around the edge of your eyelids from the mascara on your eyelashes. You stopped noticing it after a few minutes, but it was a strange adjustment. Stranger still was having your hair curled. That curling iron was hot. But it was also an odd sensation to look down and see your hair shorter than normal because the curls eliminated some of the length.</p><p>\n\nPepper rolled up, held, and let go one last curl, then sprayed your head with a little bit of hairspray to make sure it would hold. Finally, she handed you your dress and told you to go put it on while she got herself ready. You tiptoed back to your room down the hall, not wanting to attract the attention of any other Avengers in their rooms getting ready. Though Pepper said you were pretty \u2013 both naturally and with the hair and makeup she did for you \u2013 it felt strange looking as you did. Having those who saw you dripping sweat on a daily basis see you look so different was a bit of an uncomfortable thought.</p><p>\n\nLuckily, you made it back to your room unseen and pulled the dress out from your closet and off the hanger. It zipped on easily, just as it had the previous night, but that didn\u2019t mean it was comfortable. <i>Oh, how I miss my t-shirt and shorts,</i> you thought, the idea only reinforced as you slipped on the heels from a box in your closet. You attached the clasp of the second shoe and stood up just as a knock sounded on the door and Pepper\u2019s voice on the other side asked if she could come in.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYes, please \u2013 I think I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou smoothed the front of your dress as she cracked the door and slid into the room with you. Her jaw simultaneously dropped as a smile formed on her face; she was equally stunned and proud of how grown up you seemed.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou look amazing, sweetheart,\u201d she said, closing the distance between you to give you a hug. Though you were still new to the compound, Tony calling you \u201ckiddo,\u201d and Pepper calling you \u201csweetheart,\u201d felt extremely comfortable. On top of that, it made your heart swell.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThanks to you, and \u2013 might I add \u2013 so do you!\u201d You spoke softly into her ear as she still held you, now laughing over your shoulder. She stepped back, her hands resting on your shoulders as she looked you in the eyes. \u201cThank you. But have you actually seen yourself?\u201d</p><p>\n\nShaking your head, she grabbed your hand and pulled you to the floor-length mirror you used to look at yourself in the dress just one night earlier. But this time, the rest of the picture was complete, and the shock in your eyes showed it. You looked like yourself \u2013 she hadn\u2019t done anything too dramatic \u2013 but still so different.</p><p>\n\n\u201cStunning, huh?\u201d Pepper teased. She opened the door and stepped out into the hallway, leaning back in through the cracked door to say one last thing. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, come to the common room and we\u2019ll all head down to the gala as a group, ok?\u201d With that, she left you alone.</p><p>\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much else for you to do besides mentally panic. You looked totally different. <i>Is it stunning? Is it weird?</i> You didn\u2019t know. <i>What will Peter think?</i> You forgot about Peter. <i>Did he like your usual look? Would he hate this new look? Would he like this one better? </i>Who knew? Before you could delve too much further into the whirlpool of questions, you walked out of your room and to the common room, where only Pepper and Tony stood so far.</p><p>\n\n\u201cLook at my little girl! All grown up,\u201d Tony joked, giving you a hug. Almost identical to Pepper, as he pulled away, he rested his hands on your arms. \u201cBut really, you look beautiful, kiddo. Underoos isn\u2019t going to know what hit him.\u201d</p><p>\n\n<i>Underoos?</i></p><p>\n\n\u201cYou called?\u201d Peter piped up, now slowly approaching from the top of the stairs behind you with a quick wave. Tony\u2019s hands fell from arms and you turned to face Peter, who immediately slowed as if his walking was stuttering instead of his voice. He instantly reddened, trying \u2013 and failing \u2013 to look at the floor (or anywhere else, really).</p><p>\n\n\u201cHi, Peter,\u201d you breathed. He was more visibly nervous than you but that didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t nervous at all. He looked good, too, and that didn\u2019t help your case. He now stood a few feet in front of you, hands fidgeting and barely reaching out from the sleeves of his <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiJ1pPWUEAAXzU2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">dark navy suit</a> that perfectly matched your dress. He wore a crisp, light blue button-down shirt underneath and his tie was striped with different shades of navy. His dress shoes were about as shiny as a pair of dress shoes could be \u2013 from what you knew about his aunt, you guessed she probably wouldn\u2019t have let him leave the house unless they were perfect.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHi, Y/N\u2026you\u2026you look\u2014<i>beautiful,\u201d</i> he said, trying to breathe.</p><p>\n\n\u201cAw, young love. Well, shall we go to the party?\u201d Tony held out his arm for Pepper, who gladly took it and followed him down the hallway toward the end of the compound where the gala was being hosted. \u201cCome along, kids, we are the ones hosting this event and should probably be there on time!\u201d</p><p>\n\nPepper grinned and lightly punched him, wanting to give you and Peter space. When you turned back to Peter, he was cautiously holding his arm out to you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cShall we?\u201d He asked with an edgy giggle, feeling silly but going along with Tony\u2019s antics. You took his arm just as Pepper had Tony\u2019s and the two of you sped along to catch up to the adults.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou look really good, too, you know,\u201d you whispered, leaning slightly toward Peter as you walked but keeping your eyes forward. When he looked at you, however, you could feel it. You could feel his eyes and had to look back at him and the cheesy smile plastered across his face.</p><p>\n\nThat is, until you tripped on your dress and nearly took a tumble.</p><p>\n\n<i>Curse this long dress and tall shoes and\u2026ugh,</i> you thought as Peter\u2019s arm that was leading you kept you from hitting the ground face first. Luckily neither Pepper nor Tony heard and they both kept walking, but Peter stopped and grabbed your other hand to get you back up and on your feet.</p><p>\n\n\u201cY/N! You ok?\u201d he murmured as he helped you get oriented again. You took a deep breath, closing your eyes for half a second to try and calm your embarrassment. But, if you really thought about it, you weren\u2019t embarrassed. Before you could push the impulse back down, you snorted with laughter opening your eyes to see Peter\u2019s worried face fading into giggles to match your own. As soon as he knew everything was ok, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh along with you as you got back to walking to the gala.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m such a klutz,\u201d you joked. \u201cPepper wears this stuff all the time and I can\u2019t even walk for five seconds without nearly wiping out!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m surprised it wasn\u2019t me who fell first. A little thankful, I have to admit.\u201d You rolled your eyes at him but still giggled thinking about it. \u201cTrust me though, I will fall at some point. And my shoes are way easier to walk in than yours!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cNo way the famous <i>Spider-man</i> is clumsy. No way.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\n\nThe four of you reached a large set of doors guarded by none other than Happy Hogan. He gave you a quick smile and wave, gave Peter a wave \u2013 sans smile, to Peter\u2019s dismay \u2013 and opened the door for Tony to make his entrance.</p><p>\n\nThankfully, there weren\u2019t very many people arriving yet. The main doors had only just opened and people were quickly filtering in. Once Happy safely got you all inside, he showed you to your table and excused himself to return to security duties.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWhile everyone is arriving, let\u2019s get a quick picture, and then we\u2019ll stick together so I can introduce you all to some people. Then we can split up and par-tay! But not too hard, of course. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou nodded at Tony and followed him, arm still linked with Peter\u2019s, as he first walked over to the photo backdrop. The group took turns getting various pictures and, as requested, Peter got one with you. He put his arm around you and you put yours around him, surprised by how comfortable it felt. Of course, Tony had to jump in and up the ante, so he grabbed the hand you had on your hip and put it on Peter\u2019s chest like in tacky prom pictures. You felt a little silly but relaxed with the fact that you could feel Peter\u2019s heart pounding underneath your hand. You weren\u2019t sure why that brought you comfort, but something about knowing he was also nervous calmed your own nerves. Unbeknownst to you, though his heart was pounding, Peter was on cloud nine.</p><p>\n\nLeaving the pictures, Tony led everyone away and walked up to a man in a sharp military suit. He then pulled you forward and away from Peter to introduce you to his good friend, Sir Colonel James Rhodes, who immediately corrected his friend with a sigh and told you to call him James or Rhodey or whatever you were comfortable with.</p><p>\n\nBehind you, Peter took a second to text Ned. Though he wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about his friends gossiping about you and him <i>together</i> at the gala, he promised he\u2019d keep his friend up to date. Plus, he needed all the support he could get.</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Dude. I\u2019m in way over my head</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> What do you mean? Are there villains there? Are you in a super fight?</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b>  What? No. Remember when I said I was in trouble?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> Oh, yeah? Because you realized Y/N was perfect and you looooove her?</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> NED! Ok. I admit, she\u2019s incredible. But you have to chill. I need help, she looks amazing and I keep blabbering and Mr. Stark keeps making comments about young love?! What do I do?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> Woah. This is the big leagues. Have you talked to Y/N much?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> You gotta hold her hand, man. Girls love that stuff.</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Barely, we walked arm in arm for a bit? And she tripped and I caught her? And she keeps smiling and I don\u2019t know if I can do this Ned</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Wait, how do you know what girls love?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> I get around, Pete. I have my ways.</p><p>\n\nBefore Peter could type up a reply, Tony pulled him forward to say hi to Rhodey, who he had previously met. Tony quickly whisked them away to person after person, bragging about you to each and every one. You kept trying to sneak back behind Tony and Pepper to hang out with Peter. As much as you loved Tony boasting about you and saying how proud he is (you couldn\u2019t get enough of it, to be honest), you also wanted to hang out with your friend.</p><p>\n\nHappy tapped on Tony\u2019s shoulder and whispered in his ear, then quickly strutted off.</p><p>\n\n\u201cAh! Time for us to go sit down, and I believe I have a mini-speech to make,\u201d he announced to your small group, directing you toward the table. As you sat down, a woman tapped on the microphone and asked everyone to take their seats. You sat with Peter on your left and Tony and Pepper adjacent to him. You were about to ask Pepper who else would be sitting at the table when someone answered for her.</p><p>\n\n\u201cExcuse me, miss, is this seat taken?\u201d</p><p>\n\nSteve stood just behind you, goofy grin on his face and hand on the back of the chair to your right.</p><p>\n\n\u201cOnly by you!\u201d you exclaimed, jumping up to give him a quick hug.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou look great, kid, and not in the fighting way this time,\u201d he whispered, looking over your shoulder at Peter seated behind you. \u201cSpider-boy is a lucky man.\u201d He leaned back and winked as he sat down, chuckling when you rolled your eyes with a smile.</p><p>\n\nGoing around the circle, next to Steve sat Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, Clint Barton, a woman you didn\u2019t recognize (Steve later told you it was Clint\u2019s wife, Laura), Thor, and Rhodey, who sat next to Pepper. Then there was, of course, Tony, Peter, and you. As the seats started to fill in, your eyes kept widening, as did Peter\u2019s. Once everyone was seated, you turned and looked at Peter with your jaw nearly on the floor. Sure, you had seen all of these superheroes around the compound, but to sit and have a fancy dinner with them? That was new.</p><p>\n\n<i>\u201cPeter,\u201d</i> you hissed, trying to get his attention from the Avengers seated around him. He turned to you, eyes just as wide as yours and brimming with delight.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThis is crazy\u2026we\u2019re at a dinner with the <i>Avengers!\u201d</i> you whispered, unable to contain your own excitement.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI know! And we\u2019re kind of friends with them?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but joke with you, clearly just as shocked by the arrangement. \u201cWhat even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\nHe was stopped by the lady at the front tapping on the microphone again and announcing the event. As Tony was introduced, the two of you couldn\u2019t help but be bored \u2013 you were only teenagers, after all \u2013 and resorted to playing <i>I Spy</i> under your breath until Tony got up to speak.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWelcome, welcome, and thank you for being here,\u201d he began. \u201cYes, I\u2019m Tony Stark, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d He paused again \u2013 ever commanding of attention \u2013 while the crowd broke out in laughter. Everyone at your table, however, rolled their eyes at his classically cocky behavior.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI think we all want to get right to it \u2013 there\u2019s food! And a party to be had! So, without further ado, thank you again for sponsoring <i>Stark Industries</i> and I hope that you enjoy this evening as much as I will!\u201d</p><p>\n\nWith a bow, he exited the stage and plopped back down in his seat between Peter and Pepper. Dinners were quickly served but Tony jumped up again.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI would like to make a toast,\u201d he declared to the table. Pepper shook her head and turned to Rhodey as he sighed. <i>\u201cStark Industries</i> has had a great year, sure, but so have the Avengers.\u201d Everyone nodded along now, far more invested in this message. \u201cWe\u2019ve celebrated that already \u2013 shout-out to shwarma \u2013 but I would also like to give a little shout-out to our little ones joining the team for stepping right into some big shoes. You\u2019ve both impressed me each and every step along the way and I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of trouble we\u2019ll have to bail you out of down the line. But just remember, the Avengers have your back. And you clearly have each other\u2019s backs. But you don\u2019t know that yet. I digress. Cheers!\u201d</p><p>\n\nPepper lightly punched him again as everyone raised their glasses and toasted. You and Peter raised your water glasses \u2013 which would have embarrassed you enough \u2013 but now Tony had to tease you in front of everyone. If you were honest with yourself, you couldn\u2019t say you hated it; anything that gave Peter a hint might help your case. But in the meantime, it was making you so incredibly nervous.</p><p>\n\nAs everyone dug into their meals, Steve pointed out to you twice how Tony kept leaning down to Peter and telling him something. Both times, Peter would weakly smile, nod, and continue eating while his eyes darted your direction. Every time Steve teased you, it reinforced his words from the previous day.<i> \u201cIf you are interested - and you don\u2019t have to be! But\u2026if you are\u2026just know that it definitely isn\u2019t unrequited,\u201d</i> he told you. <i>Was he right?</i> Peter did seem nervous. <i>But that very well could be because he\u2019s surrounded by his idols,</i> you reminded yourself.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI have a bit of a bone to pick with some of you,\u201d Clint professed, drawing the attention of everyone at the table. \u201cNot exactly a bone to pick. More of a little friendly teasing. So, how is it that our hundred-year-old super soldier, decorated military colonel, and literal god of thunder don\u2019t have girls by their sides, but our little spider-boy does? I mean, come on! And I mean no offense to you, Spidey, I\u2019m impressed!\u201d He slow clapped at Peter as those not being called out laughed with him. Peter blushed and nodded, eyes coming up to meet yours only briefly as you played along with their banter.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as much the ladies that should be rewarded,\u201d Natasha reminded him with a smirk, looking straight at you. \u201cAs usual, kudos to you, kid.\u201d</p><p>\n\nSteve patted you on the back as you sighed, realizing it was your turn to be embarrassed and teased by the table. These Avengers sure did like to take advantage of having kids around to poke fun at.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHow are you settling in? School going well?\u201d Bruce asked you, far more serious than any of the others.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going well and I\u2019m really loving it here,\u201d you reflected. \u201cI love training \u2013 Nat and Steve keep it very difficult for me,\u201d they grinned at you, not letting you say that without reminding you how successful you had been so far. \u201cAnd Peter has been really helpful at school\u2014\u201d you felt your gaze look over to him. He faced your conversation rather than the one on the other side of the table and seemed to hang on your every word. \u201cI\u2019ve been really thankful to have him,\u201d you finally pulled your stare from Peter\u2019s to look back at Bruce. \u201cPlus, Tony let me try out a suit yesterday and it was one of the most amazing things ever!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou did?\u201d Peter prodded your shoulder to get your attention back. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing! It went well? You had fun?\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou couldn\u2019t help but think back to the first week you met him and how he felt threatened by you joining the team. Whatever changed to make him this supportive friend now sitting by your side doing nothing but encouraging you\u2026you couldn\u2019t deny that it brought butterflies to your stomach.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt was incredible,\u201d you explained, trying not to focus on Peter despite your mind being drawn to him. \u201cIt was like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced before\u2026<i>obviously,\u201d</i> you joked, making everyone listening laugh along with you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cNow, Y/N, I know a little bit from what Tony told us before you arrived, but remind me again about what you were doing before Tony found you?\u201d Bruce asked.</p><p>\n\nFor some reason, the question made you uncertain. You hadn\u2019t thought about everyone back home and how they were probably all still doing the same thing and in the same routine as when you left just a few weeks ago. That easily could\u2019ve been you if Tony had picked one of the other millions of kids around the country, let alone the world. You couldn\u2019t put your finger on all the reasons, but the thought made you a bit uncomfortable. Thankful, but uncomfortable.</p><p>\n\nPeter\u2019s spidey sense started going off quietly and, while he first looked around for trouble, he quickly realized it was you. He wasn\u2019t in your head and didn\u2019t know the exact cause but pieced together that something about Bruce\u2019s question hit a sore subject. No one else seemed to pick up on it, however, and everyone patiently awaited your answer.</p><p>\n\nPeter could only explain what happened next as a result of the spidey sense amping up his adrenaline. His mind flashed back to Ned\u2019s advice: <i>\u201cyou gotta hold her hand, man. Girls love that stuff.\u201d</i> As that piece of information crashed together with the sense that you were nervous, he covertly reached his hand out and held your two hands that you were fidgeting with in your lap.</p><p>\n\nAs his warm and, slightly clammy hand (so were yours, though \u2013 you couldn\u2019t blame him) wrapped around yours, your eyes followed his arm up his sleeve to see him looking at you with the same smile and encouraging gaze from earlier. Your doe eyes stared at his puppy-dog ones that somehow reassured you as he nodded. You didn\u2019t know how he knew you were uncomfortable or really understand any of what just happened, but that didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t a little excited about it.</p><p>  \n\nThankfully everything took place in a matter of seconds and you answered Bruce\u2019s original question quickly enough for all the nerves and the hand-holding and other little things to go unnoticed by the adults. As you answered that first question and all those after it, Peter\u2019s hand never left yours. He even gave the occasional squeeze when his spidey sense kicked up a little higher. He figured it meant whatever they asked was a topic you were more anxious talking about and wanted to be there for support. He could sense you relaxing into it and eventually holding his hand back as you spoke, giving him his own butterflies. Most of all, a voice in the back of his head was telling him he owed Ned. <i>Big time.</i></p><p>\n\nMany conversations and laughs later, the clock struck 9 and Tony announced it was time to get the real party part of the night started. He repeated the announcement on stage into the microphone, receiving applause of course, and then returned to the table.</p><p>\n\nTony turned to you and Peter as he sat back down. \u201cThe bar is opening up, so children, you are now excused.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou both stared at him; you had no idea what he was trying to tell you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI figured you\u2019d rather go upstairs and watch a movie or something than hang out with a bunch of drinking adults? Since you can\u2019t drink and all? I mean, I\u2019m a cool dad and I\u2019d let you have a sip, but you\u2019re not old enough for open bar, you know?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but tease. \u201cPeter, you\u2019re welcome to stay the night or go home, whatever you want, just tell JARVIS so we make sure you get home safe if needed. You\u2019re a superhero but you\u2019re also a baby.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou and Peter glanced at each other, slightly confused, and got up to leave. Everyone said goodnight and wished you sweet dreams while you stood. Steve gave you a fist-bump, whispering, \u201cgo get \u2018em,\u201d as you turned to go.</p><p>\n\nHappy, guarding the door through which you initially entered, let you back into the secure part of the compound. You walked down the same hall you tripped in a few hours ago with Peter still by your side, the two of you sharing a somehow comfortable silence as he walked with his hands in his pockets and eyes watching his shoes.</p><p>\n\n\u201cAre\u2026are you going to stay?\u201d You asked, curious if you\u2019d be by yourself and going to sleep soon or if you\u2019d get to hang out a bit longer.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI, uh\u2026yeah? If you want me to?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cYeah, we could hang out for a little bit?\u201d You laughed to yourself as you kept walking, finding it funny how you clearly wanted him to stay but spoke as if it was a question. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to change, though, because as you know I can barely walk in this.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so relieved to hear you say that. I did not want to wear all these layers any longer,\u201d Peter confessed, loosening his tie and smiling as the tension started melting away.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d You stopped in place; your head tilted to the side. Peter stopped just a step in front of you and turned back. You reached your hand out and placed it on his shoulder closest to you. Peter panicked in that moment; all the air left his lungs as he had no idea what you planned to do.</p><p>\n\nSure enough, you kicked your foot up and slipped off one shoe after the other, relying on him for balance. Feet no planted on the floor, you sighed with relief. \u201cMuch better,\u201d you exclaimed with a giggle, pulling your hand back and picking your dress up with the hand not holding your shoes to keep walking.</p><p>\n\nPeter let out a breath he didn\u2019t realize he was holding and caught up with you, now laughing at how dramatic that was. The two of you split up when you reach your rooms, which, coincidentally, were right across the hall from each other - and changed out of your gala clothes and into pajamas. You pulled on a fuzzy <i>Stark Industries</i> sweatshirt and your favorite, patterned Iron Man pajama shorts.</p><p>\n\nOn the other side of the door, Peter had finished changing and was heading back to the common room. Like you, he opted for a sweatshirt and shorts, but instead pulled on Midtown gear. In the brief second he had alone, he pulled out his phone to at least 20 texts from Ned, all asking how it was going and if you and Peter were married yet. <i>Oh, Ned,</i> he thought.</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Ned. Did you get my message saying chill? We just left the gala and are hanging out just the two of us upstairs</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Btw? Hand-holding? Money!!!</p><p>\n\nYou walked into the common room before Ned could reply, but Peter felt his phone buzz once, twice, thrice \u2013 too many times to count. Peter sat down on the couch while you walked into the kitchen, offering snacks. When you brought the popcorn back, you sat down on the same couch as Peter but with a cushion in between you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to do? Game? Movie? Other?\u201d Peter chastised himself. <i>Why would I throw out \u2018other?\u2019 That\u2019s so weird!</i></p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up for whatever,\u201d you confided. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure what all our options are, but if we go the game route, you should know that I\u2019m very, very competitive.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see it,\u201d Peter teased, setting up some video game while you dug into the popcorn. With JARVIS\u2019 help, he eventually got Mario Kart up and running and showed you how to play.</p><p>\n\nHe started you off easy, helping you pick your character and bike so you wouldn\u2019t be totally at a loss. It only took you beating him once for him to switch gears and go from trying to be nice and flirty to trash-talking up a storm. But you\u2019d be lying if you said you didn\u2019t do the same.</p><p>\n\n\u201cTAKE THAT, LOSER!\u201d You yelled, jumping up on the couch as you threw a blue shell at his bike just a little bit up ahead. You could see the finish line on the last lap of Mushroom Gorge approaching and were not about to let him win.</p><p>\n\n\u201cNOOOOOOO!\u201d He screamed, his bike spinning out and slowly sputtering back up to speed as you whipped by him. Within seconds you crossed the finish line, jumping around the room as he finished the race in second.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI win, you lose, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha,\u201d you mocked as he grimaced and glared at you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI was being nice!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cExcuses, excuses, excuses\u2026<i>Avengers</i> don\u2019t make excuses,\u201d you teased, rubbing salt in the wound.</p><p>\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said coyly, a smirk growing on his face. \u201cRematch. Rainbow Road. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou hopped back into your spot on the couch while he started up the next race, accepting his challenge without hesitation. Before you knew it, the countdown started and you floored it immediately.</p><p>\n\nYou took turns in first and second, constantly getting power-ups and passing each other. None of the computer players were anywhere close from the moment the race started, but both of you knew they weren\u2019t the competition. Near the end, Peter used the heavy weight of his character and pushed your light-weight character off the track, causing you to lose enough precious time that there was no way you\u2019d catch him in the last quarter-lap. Sure enough, he crossed the finish line first and quickly seized the opportunity to gloat.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI win, you lose, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha,\u201d he sang in the same tune you had, mocking your enthusiasm from before.</p><p>\n\nWithout skipping a beat, you whipped around to face him. \u201cBest two-out-of-three!\u201d Playful grins spreading on both your faces, he set up another race.</p><p>\n\nYou took turns winning race after race, upping the stakes more and more until finally you nearly did every race in the game. He\u2019d win one, you\u2019d win two, he\u2019d win two, you\u2019d win one \u2013 it went on and on until finally you slumped back on the couch and closed your eyes.</p><p>\n\n\u201cPeter, I think we\u2019re even,\u201d you said, hoping he\u2019d agree.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right. Are you comfy there?\u201d He kicked your foot a little, teasing you for completely spreading out like a starfish.</p><p>\n\nYou didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYes, quite comfy, actually.\u201d</p><p>\n\nHe snagged a blanket from another chair and threw it at you, expecting you to jump up. But again, you didn\u2019t flinch, and just laid peacefully with the blanket now draped over your whole body. He laughed again and stepped over to you, pulling only the top of the blanket by your head back and peaking under so he could see your face.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWANNA WATCH A MOVIE?\u201d You nearly shouted when his face appeared at the top of the blanket. He leapt back in shock and nearly fell over the coffee table but recovered his balance just in time. You pulled back the rest of the blanket, laughing so hard there was no sound coming out and you were nearly in tears.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou scared me\u2026<i>so badly\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>\n\n\u201cYeah, I know. So, what movie do you want to watch?\u201d You continued laughing and readjusted yourself on the couch. It was only 10:30, which was late for you, but you figured there would be noise in the compound until midnight.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHmm. What\u2019s your favorite movie?\u201d Peter sat back down on the couch right next to you.</p><p>\n\n \u201cI haven\u2019t really seen many movies; I don\u2019t know if I have a favorite. Most of the ones I got to watch were animated kids\u2019 movies,\u201d you confided, slinking back into the couch as you spoke. You weren\u2019t embarrassed about it, but everything had been going so well with Peter and you didn\u2019t want that to change. The last thing you wanted to do was say the wrong thing.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Peter twisted himself on the couch to face you and froze. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019ve at least seen <i>Star Wars?\u201d</i> You shook your head, suddenly concerned he wouldn\u2019t like you or something because of it.</p><p>\n\n\u201cNO WAY. We have to watch it. Right now.\u201d His eyes danced with excitement completely contrary to what you expected. \u201cMaybe all of them. You have to see them. I\u2019m going to watch every single one of them with you and we\u2019re starting right now.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cAll of them? How many are there?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cWell, seven currently. Six original, a new one came out in 2015, and the one after that comes out this December, and the one after that comes out in 2019! Plus, there\u2019s a spin-off movie that came out in 2016\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cHang on. That\u2019s a lot of movies. It\u2019s 10:30, Peter. What\u2019s the first one?\u201d</p><p>\n\n<i>\u201cEpisode IV.\u201d</i></p><p>\n\n\u201cWell that makes no sense,\u201d you mocked as he grabbed your arm and shook you.</p><p>\n\n\u201cTRUST ME, PLEASE Y/N!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cOk! Ok! Calm down, Peter, I\u2019ll watch your war of the stars movie,\u201d you teased, smirking at how exasperated he seemed with you calling the series you did in fact know the name of by the wrong name. \u201cJARVIS, can you play <i>Star Wars: Episode IV,</i> please?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cRight away, Miss.\u201d The TV screen switched off from Mario Kart before showing the opening credits of the movie.</p><p>\n\n\u201cOh my gosh! This is important, you have to read this,\u201d Peter exclaimed, sitting back down next to you. You just looked at him and smiled at the boy pointing at the screen, so passionate about this movie.</p><p>\n\n\u201cY/N, I told you, you have to read this!\u201d He could feel your eyes on him and turned to look, his voice sounding nearly frustrated. You immediately burst out laughing.</p><p>\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cYou, you goofball! You\u2019re so excited!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cOf course I am! I get to sit with you and see you enjoy my favorite movies for the first time!\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cOk, that\u2019s pretty sweet,\u201d you admitted.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThank you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cI guess I understand why you\u2019re being a dork.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cHey\u2014\u201d he started, but you were grinning wildly and already rewinding the movie to go back to the start. He sighed, content now, and sat facing forward again right next to you while the opening credits rolled for real. He looked over at you again, staring at your eyes. And this time, you were reading. Every single word.</p><hr><p>\n\n\n\nBack down at the gala, Tony felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He excused himself and stepped outside. Looking down at his phone again, he couldn\u2019t figure out why the Secretary of State himself would be calling <i>him</i> of all people, especially so late on a Saturday.</p><p>\n\nHappy let him through the main doors and he traced the path back to the common room as he answered. <i>Might as well check on the lovebirds,</i> he thought as he hit accept on the call.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cTony Stark, good to hear your voice.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cI wish I could say the same, Ross,\u201d Tony sassed.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI have some news for you and your gang, Stark, and I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to like it,\u201d Thaddeus Ross explained. Tony reached the common room now and smiled seeing it illuminated by a movie he instantly recognized.</p><p>\n\n\u201cGiven the events that occurred in Sokovia, the United Nations has decided that powers such as your Avengers need to be kept in check. We\u2019re giving you an ultimatum.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cSorry to burst your bubble, but we aren\u2019t going to propose to you any time soon.\u201d Tony stepped around the couch and, despite the tension he felt through the phone and the straightforward dislike he had for the man he was talking too, his heart warmed at seeing you and Peter on the couch. After the movie started, you had quickly dozed off, losing control of your head on Peter\u2019s shoulder. Peter trying his best not to squirm and upset you, somehow got his phone out of his pocket and texted Ned. He didn\u2019t want to move you, though, and ended up falling asleep himself and his head had dropped on top of yours.</p><p>\n\nRoss\u2019 voice on the other end of the line snapped Tony back to reality. I\u2019ll tease them in the morning, he decided. \u201cWe have a proposal for <i>you,</i> actually. It goes like this: either you sign some accords we\u2019ve written up and agree to only be dispatched when the United Nations deems necessary,\u201d he started while Tony grabbed the blanket on the floor that Peter had thrown at you earlier. \u201cOr you become criminals.\u201d Trying to avoid the crisis on the phone, Tony draped the blanket over you and Peter and leaned down to kiss your forehead. You shifted as he stepped back from you and he worried he woke you up, but instead you snuggled further into Peter\u2019s side and brought a smile to Tony\u2019s face.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to like this,\u201d Tony said into the phone.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Ross replied. \u201cI\u2019ll be there with the documents tomorrow for your team to make a decision.\u201d</p><p>\n\nWith that, the call clicked off. Tony could sense there would be disagreements about what was about to take place with these so-called accords and hoped that none of it would impact either of you kids. Ignoring the problem he would have to confront tomorrow, he switched his phone to camera and took a quick picture of you and Peter, being sure to send it to all the Avengers (yourselves included) before cautiously heading back to end the party. \n</p>\n\n<p><b>taglist: </b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4U3Qv6EybA2SJYW6mZO5fQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starksnack</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzv9-KqY2nwVns3bh-ocUTA\" target=\"_blank\">@hollandbabesblog</a></p>\n\n<center><p><a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/184632134053/in-my-way-7\" target=\"_blank\">previous chapter (7)</a> | <a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/181672022943/inmyway\" target=\"_blank\">series masterlist</a> | <a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/184956278498/in-my-way-9\" target=\"_blank\"> next chapter (9)</a></p></center>\n\n<center><p><a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/181671397318/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">masterlist</a> | <a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">taglist</a></p></center></p>",

Strength training: done. Combat training: done. Shower: done. Lunch: done (and yummy, you might add).</p><p>\n\nAnother Saturday morning in the books, you plopped yourself down on the couch in the common room waiting for Pepper to come get you. She told you she would do your hair and makeup for the gala so that all you had to do was get dressed when it was time. While you were excited to get totally dressed up, she was definitely more excited than you were. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more fun to stay in pajamas and hang out with friends?\n</p><p>Your phone dinged right as you set your feet on the coffee table. It was a text from MJ asking about your &ldquo;plans&rdquo; for the night. Keeping up with the spirit of the previous week, she kept digging for details about you and Peter ever since she and Ned heard you were going to the gala together. You explained multiple times that it was just Tony being Tony, but they wouldn&rsquo;t hear it.</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> soooooo what&rsquo;s the plan</p>\n\n<p><b>You:</b> Well, I think Tony said the dinner officially starts at 7 but doors open at 6 so we&rsquo;re going then!</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> no no. what&rsquo;s the PLAN plan</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> you know what I mean ;)</p><p>\n\nSure, you knew what she meant. And sure, part of you wished you had a plan. But you didn&rsquo;t, because you weren&rsquo;t going to do anything. You barely knew him, anyway. The only reason he was going with you was because Tony was making him. Nothing else.</p>\n\n<p><b>You:</b> Lol MJ, I&rsquo;ve told you a thousand times. No &ldquo;plan&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> suit yourself. but when your eyes meet across the dance floor and you fall in love, remember that I told you so</p>\n\n<p><b>You:</b> Fine. I don&rsquo;t even think there is a dance floor. But if somehow our lives become a fairy tale then I&rsquo;ll thank you.</p>\n\n<p><b>MJ:</b> you&rsquo;re welcome.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Y/N? You ready?&rdquo; Pepper&rsquo;s heels clicked on the floor as she walked up to you. With a smile and nod you stood up and followed her, wondering all the while how she spent all day in heels without her feet hurting. <i>And now she had to wear heels to a gala, too? Insane.</i></p>\n\n<p>Pepper led you to the bedroom she shared with Tony and then into her bathroom, which was completely prepped and ready for you. There were hair tools laid out all across the left side of the counter and makeup all over the right side.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not always a mess &ndash; I promise,&rdquo; Pepper reassured you, though you didn&rsquo;t doubt it. &ldquo;I just have everything laid out so you can see your options.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t&hellip;I don&rsquo;t really&hellip;know? I have no idea what would look good on me or with the dress or for this occasion or anything. But I do trust your judgement,&rdquo; you sputtered. It was true &ndash; you had seen pictures and things from previous events like the gala tonight but coming up with looks like that was completely foreign to you.</p><p>\n\nPepper stepped back and squinted at your hair and face. She had a pretty good idea of you by now, both in terms of personality and in terms of what you were comfortable with. She wouldn&rsquo;t go crazy, obviously, but devised a classy yet youthful &ndash; had to stick with the princess vibes &ndash; look for you.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I do have an idea, yes.&rdquo; She ushered you over to a chair and grabbed something you didn&rsquo;t recognize from the makeup side of the counter. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll like it, but before I start, are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Am I sure if I trust the extraordinarily stylish Pepper Potts to dress me for an event?&rdquo; You giggled, bringing a smile to her face as well. &ldquo;Yes, of course I do! Make me pretty, pretty please.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nShe stepped in front of you and started applying product to your face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re already pretty,&rdquo; she whispered, cupping your cheek as you grinned at her until she grabbed the next product.</p><hr /><p>\n\nWearing makeup was&hellip;weird. It made your face feel hot and it was so strange seeing black around the edge of your eyelids from the mascara on your eyelashes. You stopped noticing it after a few minutes, but it was a strange adjustment. Stranger still was having your hair curled. That curling iron was hot. But it was also an odd sensation to look down and see your hair shorter than normal because the curls eliminated some of the length.</p><p>\n\nPepper rolled up, held, and let go one last curl, then sprayed your head with a little bit of hairspray to make sure it would hold. Finally, she handed you your dress and told you to go put it on while she got herself ready. You tiptoed back to your room down the hall, not wanting to attract the attention of any other Avengers in their rooms getting ready. Though Pepper said you were pretty &ndash; both naturally and with the hair and makeup she did for you &ndash; it felt strange looking as you did. Having those who saw you dripping sweat on a daily basis see you look so different was a bit of an uncomfortable thought.</p><p>\n\nLuckily, you made it back to your room unseen and pulled the dress out from your closet and off the hanger. It zipped on easily, just as it had the previous night, but that didn&rsquo;t mean it was comfortable. <i>Oh, how I miss my t-shirt and shorts,</i> you thought, the idea only reinforced as you slipped on the heels from a box in your closet. You attached the clasp of the second shoe and stood up just as a knock sounded on the door and Pepper&rsquo;s voice on the other side asked if she could come in.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Yes, please &ndash; I think I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nYou smoothed the front of your dress as she cracked the door and slid into the room with you. Her jaw simultaneously dropped as a smile formed on her face; she was equally stunned and proud of how grown up you seemed.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;You look amazing, sweetheart,&rdquo; she said, closing the distance between you to give you a hug. Though you were still new to the compound, Tony calling you &ldquo;kiddo,&rdquo; and Pepper calling you &ldquo;sweetheart,&rdquo; felt extremely comfortable. On top of that, it made your heart swell.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Thanks to you, and &ndash; might I add &ndash; so do you!&rdquo; You spoke softly into her ear as she still held you, now laughing over your shoulder. She stepped back, her hands resting on your shoulders as she looked you in the eyes. &ldquo;Thank you. But have you actually seen yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nShaking your head, she grabbed your hand and pulled you to the floor-length mirror you used to look at yourself in the dress just one night earlier. But this time, the rest of the picture was complete, and the shock in your eyes showed it. You looked like yourself &ndash; she hadn&rsquo;t done anything too dramatic &ndash; but still so different.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Stunning, huh?&rdquo; Pepper teased. She opened the door and stepped out into the hallway, leaning back in through the cracked door to say one last thing. &ldquo;Whenever you&rsquo;re ready, come to the common room and we&rsquo;ll all head down to the gala as a group, ok?&rdquo; With that, she left you alone.</p><p>\n\nThere wasn&rsquo;t much else for you to do besides mentally panic. You looked totally different. <i>Is it stunning? Is it weird?</i> You didn&rsquo;t know. <i>What will Peter think?</i> You forgot about Peter. <i>Did he like your usual look? Would he hate this new look? Would he like this one better? </i>Who knew? Before you could delve too much further into the whirlpool of questions, you walked out of your room and to the common room, where only Pepper and Tony stood so far.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Look at my little girl! All grown up,&rdquo; Tony joked, giving you a hug. Almost identical to Pepper, as he pulled away, he rested his hands on your arms. &ldquo;But really, you look beautiful, kiddo. Underoos isn&rsquo;t going to know what hit him.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n<i>Underoos?</i></p><p>\n\n&ldquo;You called?&rdquo; Peter piped up, now slowly approaching from the top of the stairs behind you with a quick wave. Tony&rsquo;s hands fell from arms and you turned to face Peter, who immediately slowed as if his walking was stuttering instead of his voice. He instantly reddened, trying &ndash; and failing &ndash; to look at the floor (or anywhere else, really).</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Hi, Peter,&rdquo; you breathed. He was more visibly nervous than you but that didn&rsquo;t mean you weren&rsquo;t nervous at all. He looked good, too, and that didn&rsquo;t help your case. He now stood a few feet in front of you, hands fidgeting and barely reaching out from the sleeves of his <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiJ1pPWUEAAXzU2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">dark navy suit</a> that perfectly matched your dress. He wore a crisp, light blue button-down shirt underneath and his tie was striped with different shades of navy. His dress shoes were about as shiny as a pair of dress shoes could be &ndash; from what you knew about his aunt, you guessed she probably wouldn&rsquo;t have let him leave the house unless they were perfect.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Hi, Y/N&hellip;you&hellip;you look&mdash;<i>beautiful,&rdquo;</i> he said, trying to breathe.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Aw, young love. Well, shall we go to the party?&rdquo; Tony held out his arm for Pepper, who gladly took it and followed him down the hallway toward the end of the compound where the gala was being hosted. &ldquo;Come along, kids, we are the ones hosting this event and should probably be there on time!&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nPepper grinned and lightly punched him, wanting to give you and Peter space. When you turned back to Peter, he was cautiously holding his arm out to you.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; He asked with an edgy giggle, feeling silly but going along with Tony&rsquo;s antics. You took his arm just as Pepper had Tony&rsquo;s and the two of you sped along to catch up to the adults.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;You look really good, too, you know,&rdquo; you whispered, leaning slightly toward Peter as you walked but keeping your eyes forward. When he looked at you, however, you could feel it. You could feel his eyes and had to look back at him and the cheesy smile plastered across his face.</p><p>\n\nThat is, until you tripped on your dress and nearly took a tumble.</p><p>\n\n<i>Curse this long dress and tall shoes and&hellip;ugh,</i> you thought as Peter&rsquo;s arm that was leading you kept you from hitting the ground face first. Luckily neither Pepper nor Tony heard and they both kept walking, but Peter stopped and grabbed your other hand to get you back up and on your feet.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Y/N! You ok?&rdquo; he murmured as he helped you get oriented again. You took a deep breath, closing your eyes for half a second to try and calm your embarrassment. But, if you really thought about it, you weren&rsquo;t embarrassed. Before you could push the impulse back down, you snorted with laughter opening your eyes to see Peter&rsquo;s worried face fading into giggles to match your own. As soon as he knew everything was ok, he couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh along with you as you got back to walking to the gala.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m such a klutz,&rdquo; you joked. &ldquo;Pepper wears this stuff all the time and I can&rsquo;t even walk for five seconds without nearly wiping out!&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Honestly, I&rsquo;m surprised it wasn&rsquo;t me who fell first. A little thankful, I have to admit.&rdquo; You rolled your eyes at him but still giggled thinking about it. &ldquo;Trust me though, I will fall at some point. And my shoes are way easier to walk in than yours!&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;No way the famous <i>Spider-man</i> is clumsy. No way.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nThe four of you reached a large set of doors guarded by none other than Happy Hogan. He gave you a quick smile and wave, gave Peter a wave &ndash; sans smile, to Peter&rsquo;s dismay &ndash; and opened the door for Tony to make his entrance.</p><p>\n\nThankfully, there weren&rsquo;t very many people arriving yet. The main doors had only just opened and people were quickly filtering in. Once Happy safely got you all inside, he showed you to your table and excused himself to return to security duties.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;While everyone is arriving, let&rsquo;s get a quick picture, and then we&rsquo;ll stick together so I can introduce you all to some people. Then we can split up and par-tay! But not too hard, of course. Sound good?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nYou nodded at Tony and followed him, arm still linked with Peter&rsquo;s, as he first walked over to the photo backdrop. The group took turns getting various pictures and, as requested, Peter got one with you. He put his arm around you and you put yours around him, surprised by how comfortable it felt. Of course, Tony had to jump in and up the ante, so he grabbed the hand you had on your hip and put it on Peter&rsquo;s chest like in tacky prom pictures. You felt a little silly but relaxed with the fact that you could feel Peter&rsquo;s heart pounding underneath your hand. You weren&rsquo;t sure why that brought you comfort, but something about knowing he was also nervous calmed your own nerves. Unbeknownst to you, though his heart was pounding, Peter was on cloud nine.</p><p>\n\nLeaving the pictures, Tony led everyone away and walked up to a man in a sharp military suit. He then pulled you forward and away from Peter to introduce you to his good friend, Sir Colonel James Rhodes, who immediately corrected his friend with a sigh and told you to call him James or Rhodey or whatever you were comfortable with.</p><p>\n\nBehind you, Peter took a second to text Ned. Though he wasn&rsquo;t sure how he felt about his friends gossiping about you and him <i>together</i> at the gala, he promised he&rsquo;d keep his friend up to date. Plus, he needed all the support he could get.</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Dude. I&rsquo;m in way over my head</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> What do you mean? Are there villains there? Are you in a super fight?</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b>  What? No. Remember when I said I was in trouble?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> Oh, yeah? Because you realized Y/N was perfect and you looooove her?</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> NED! Ok. I admit, she&rsquo;s incredible. But you have to chill. I need help, she looks amazing and I keep blabbering and Mr. Stark keeps making comments about young love?! What do I do?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> Woah. This is the big leagues. Have you talked to Y/N much?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> You gotta hold her hand, man. Girls love that stuff.</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Barely, we walked arm in arm for a bit? And she tripped and I caught her? And she keeps smiling and I don&rsquo;t know if I can do this Ned</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Wait, how do you know what girls love?</p><p>\n\n<b>Ned:</b> I get around, Pete. I have my ways.</p><p>\n\nBefore Peter could type up a reply, Tony pulled him forward to say hi to Rhodey, who he had previously met. Tony quickly whisked them away to person after person, bragging about you to each and every one. You kept trying to sneak back behind Tony and Pepper to hang out with Peter. As much as you loved Tony boasting about you and saying how proud he is (you couldn&rsquo;t get enough of it, to be honest), you also wanted to hang out with your friend.</p><p>\n\nHappy tapped on Tony&rsquo;s shoulder and whispered in his ear, then quickly strutted off.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Ah! Time for us to go sit down, and I believe I have a mini-speech to make,&rdquo; he announced to your small group, directing you toward the table. As you sat down, a woman tapped on the microphone and asked everyone to take their seats. You sat with Peter on your left and Tony and Pepper adjacent to him. You were about to ask Pepper who else would be sitting at the table when someone answered for her.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Excuse me, miss, is this seat taken?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nSteve stood just behind you, goofy grin on his face and hand on the back of the chair to your right.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Only by you!&rdquo; you exclaimed, jumping up to give him a quick hug.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;You look great, kid, and not in the fighting way this time,&rdquo; he whispered, looking over your shoulder at Peter seated behind you. &ldquo;Spider-boy is a lucky man.&rdquo; He leaned back and winked as he sat down, chuckling when you rolled your eyes with a smile.</p><p>\n\nGoing around the circle, next to Steve sat Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, Clint Barton, a woman you didn&rsquo;t recognize (Steve later told you it was Clint&rsquo;s wife, Laura), Thor, and Rhodey, who sat next to Pepper. Then there was, of course, Tony, Peter, and you. As the seats started to fill in, your eyes kept widening, as did Peter&rsquo;s. Once everyone was seated, you turned and looked at Peter with your jaw nearly on the floor. Sure, you had seen all of these superheroes around the compound, but to sit and have a fancy dinner with them? That was new.</p><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo;</i> you hissed, trying to get his attention from the Avengers seated around him. He turned to you, eyes just as wide as yours and brimming with delight.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;This is crazy&hellip;we&rsquo;re at a dinner with the <i>Avengers!&rdquo;</i> you whispered, unable to contain your own excitement.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I know! And we&rsquo;re kind of friends with them?&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t help but joke with you, clearly just as shocked by the arrangement. &ldquo;What even&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nHe was stopped by the lady at the front tapping on the microphone again and announcing the event. As Tony was introduced, the two of you couldn&rsquo;t help but be bored &ndash; you were only teenagers, after all &ndash; and resorted to playing <i>I Spy</i> under your breath until Tony got up to speak.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Welcome, welcome, and thank you for being here,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m Tony Stark, you&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo; He paused again &ndash; ever commanding of attention &ndash; while the crowd broke out in laughter. Everyone at your table, however, rolled their eyes at his classically cocky behavior.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I think we all want to get right to it &ndash; there&rsquo;s food! And a party to be had! So, without further ado, thank you again for sponsoring <i>Stark Industries</i> and I hope that you enjoy this evening as much as I will!&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nWith a bow, he exited the stage and plopped back down in his seat between Peter and Pepper. Dinners were quickly served but Tony jumped up again.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I would like to make a toast,&rdquo; he declared to the table. Pepper shook her head and turned to Rhodey as he sighed. <i>&ldquo;Stark Industries</i> has had a great year, sure, but so have the Avengers.&rdquo; Everyone nodded along now, far more invested in this message. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve celebrated that already &ndash; shout-out to shwarma &ndash; but I would also like to give a little shout-out to our little ones joining the team for stepping right into some big shoes. You&rsquo;ve both impressed me each and every step along the way and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what kind of trouble we&rsquo;ll have to bail you out of down the line. But just remember, the Avengers have your back. And you clearly have each other&rsquo;s backs. But you don&rsquo;t know that yet. I digress. Cheers!&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nPepper lightly punched him again as everyone raised their glasses and toasted. You and Peter raised your water glasses &ndash; which would have embarrassed you enough &ndash; but now Tony had to tease you in front of everyone. If you were honest with yourself, you couldn&rsquo;t say you hated it; anything that gave Peter a hint might help your case. But in the meantime, it was making you so incredibly nervous.</p><p>\n\nAs everyone dug into their meals, Steve pointed out to you twice how Tony kept leaning down to Peter and telling him something. Both times, Peter would weakly smile, nod, and continue eating while his eyes darted your direction. Every time Steve teased you, it reinforced his words from the previous day.<i> &ldquo;If you are interested - and you don&rsquo;t have to be! But&hellip;if you are&hellip;just know that it definitely isn&rsquo;t unrequited,&rdquo;</i> he told you. <i>Was he right?</i> Peter did seem nervous. <i>But that very well could be because he&rsquo;s surrounded by his idols,</i> you reminded yourself.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I have a bit of a bone to pick with some of you,&rdquo; Clint professed, drawing the attention of everyone at the table. &ldquo;Not exactly a bone to pick. More of a little friendly teasing. So, how is it that our hundred-year-old super soldier, decorated military colonel, and literal god of thunder don&rsquo;t have girls by their sides, but our little spider-boy does? I mean, come on! And I mean no offense to you, Spidey, I&rsquo;m impressed!&rdquo; He slow clapped at Peter as those not being called out laughed with him. Peter blushed and nodded, eyes coming up to meet yours only briefly as you played along with their banter.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as much the ladies that should be rewarded,&rdquo; Natasha reminded him with a smirk, looking straight at you. &ldquo;As usual, kudos to you, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nSteve patted you on the back as you sighed, realizing it was your turn to be embarrassed and teased by the table. These Avengers sure did like to take advantage of having kids around to poke fun at.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;How are you settling in? School going well?&rdquo; Bruce asked you, far more serious than any of the others.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going well and I&rsquo;m really loving it here,&rdquo; you reflected. &ldquo;I love training &ndash; Nat and Steve keep it very difficult for me,&rdquo; they grinned at you, not letting you say that without reminding you how successful you had been so far. &ldquo;And Peter has been really helpful at school&mdash;&rdquo; you felt your gaze look over to him. He faced your conversation rather than the one on the other side of the table and seemed to hang on your every word. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been really thankful to have him,&rdquo; you finally pulled your stare from Peter&rsquo;s to look back at Bruce. &ldquo;Plus, Tony let me try out a suit yesterday and it was one of the most amazing things ever!&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; Peter prodded your shoulder to get your attention back. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing! It went well? You had fun?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nYou couldn&rsquo;t help but think back to the first week you met him and how he felt threatened by you joining the team. Whatever changed to make him this supportive friend now sitting by your side doing nothing but encouraging you&hellip;you couldn&rsquo;t deny that it brought butterflies to your stomach.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;It was incredible,&rdquo; you explained, trying not to focus on Peter despite your mind being drawn to him. &ldquo;It was like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever experienced before&hellip;<i>obviously,&rdquo;</i> you joked, making everyone listening laugh along with you.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Now, Y/N, I know a little bit from what Tony told us before you arrived, but remind me again about what you were doing before Tony found you?&rdquo; Bruce asked.</p><p>\n\nFor some reason, the question made you uncertain. You hadn&rsquo;t thought about everyone back home and how they were probably all still doing the same thing and in the same routine as when you left just a few weeks ago. That easily could&rsquo;ve been you if Tony had picked one of the other millions of kids around the country, let alone the world. You couldn&rsquo;t put your finger on all the reasons, but the thought made you a bit uncomfortable. Thankful, but uncomfortable.</p><p>\n\nPeter&rsquo;s spidey sense started going off quietly and, while he first looked around for trouble, he quickly realized it was you. He wasn&rsquo;t in your head and didn&rsquo;t know the exact cause but pieced together that something about Bruce&rsquo;s question hit a sore subject. No one else seemed to pick up on it, however, and everyone patiently awaited your answer.</p><p>\n\nPeter could only explain what happened next as a result of the spidey sense amping up his adrenaline. His mind flashed back to Ned&rsquo;s advice: <i>&ldquo;you gotta hold her hand, man. Girls love that stuff.&rdquo;</i> As that piece of information crashed together with the sense that you were nervous, he covertly reached his hand out and held your two hands that you were fidgeting with in your lap.</p><p>\n\nAs his warm and, slightly clammy hand (so were yours, though &ndash; you couldn&rsquo;t blame him) wrapped around yours, your eyes followed his arm up his sleeve to see him looking at you with the same smile and encouraging gaze from earlier. Your doe eyes stared at his puppy-dog ones that somehow reassured you as he nodded. You didn&rsquo;t know how he knew you were uncomfortable or really understand any of what just happened, but that didn&rsquo;t mean you weren&rsquo;t a little excited about it.</p><p>  \n\nThankfully everything took place in a matter of seconds and you answered Bruce&rsquo;s original question quickly enough for all the nerves and the hand-holding and other little things to go unnoticed by the adults. As you answered that first question and all those after it, Peter&rsquo;s hand never left yours. He even gave the occasional squeeze when his spidey sense kicked up a little higher. He figured it meant whatever they asked was a topic you were more anxious talking about and wanted to be there for support. He could sense you relaxing into it and eventually holding his hand back as you spoke, giving him his own butterflies. Most of all, a voice in the back of his head was telling him he owed Ned. <i>Big time.</i></p><p>\n\nMany conversations and laughs later, the clock struck 9 and Tony announced it was time to get the real party part of the night started. He repeated the announcement on stage into the microphone, receiving applause of course, and then returned to the table.</p><p>\n\nTony turned to you and Peter as he sat back down. &ldquo;The bar is opening up, so children, you are now excused.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nYou both stared at him; you had no idea what he was trying to tell you.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I figured you&rsquo;d rather go upstairs and watch a movie or something than hang out with a bunch of drinking adults? Since you can&rsquo;t drink and all? I mean, I&rsquo;m a cool dad and I&rsquo;d let you have a sip, but you&rsquo;re not old enough for open bar, you know?&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t help but tease. &ldquo;Peter, you&rsquo;re welcome to stay the night or go home, whatever you want, just tell JARVIS so we make sure you get home safe if needed. You&rsquo;re a superhero but you&rsquo;re also a baby.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nYou and Peter glanced at each other, slightly confused, and got up to leave. Everyone said goodnight and wished you sweet dreams while you stood. Steve gave you a fist-bump, whispering, &ldquo;go get &lsquo;em,&rdquo; as you turned to go.</p><p>\n\nHappy, guarding the door through which you initially entered, let you back into the secure part of the compound. You walked down the same hall you tripped in a few hours ago with Peter still by your side, the two of you sharing a somehow comfortable silence as he walked with his hands in his pockets and eyes watching his shoes.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Are&hellip;are you going to stay?&rdquo; You asked, curious if you&rsquo;d be by yourself and going to sleep soon or if you&rsquo;d get to hang out a bit longer.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I, uh&hellip;yeah? If you want me to?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Yeah, we could hang out for a little bit?&rdquo; You laughed to yourself as you kept walking, finding it funny how you clearly wanted him to stay but spoke as if it was a question. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have to change, though, because as you know I can barely walk in this.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so relieved to hear you say that. I did not want to wear all these layers any longer,&rdquo; Peter confessed, loosening his tie and smiling as the tension started melting away.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; You stopped in place; your head tilted to the side. Peter stopped just a step in front of you and turned back. You reached your hand out and placed it on his shoulder closest to you. Peter panicked in that moment; all the air left his lungs as he had no idea what you planned to do.</p><p>\n\nSure enough, you kicked your foot up and slipped off one shoe after the other, relying on him for balance. Feet no planted on the floor, you sighed with relief. &ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; you exclaimed with a giggle, pulling your hand back and picking your dress up with the hand not holding your shoes to keep walking.</p><p>\n\nPeter let out a breath he didn&rsquo;t realize he was holding and caught up with you, now laughing at how dramatic that was. The two of you split up when you reach your rooms, which, coincidentally, were right across the hall from each other - and changed out of your gala clothes and into pajamas. You pulled on a fuzzy <i>Stark Industries</i> sweatshirt and your favorite, patterned Iron Man pajama shorts.</p><p>\n\nOn the other side of the door, Peter had finished changing and was heading back to the common room. Like you, he opted for a sweatshirt and shorts, but instead pulled on Midtown gear. In the brief second he had alone, he pulled out his phone to at least 20 texts from Ned, all asking how it was going and if you and Peter were married yet. <i>Oh, Ned,</i> he thought.</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Ned. Did you get my message saying chill? We just left the gala and are hanging out just the two of us upstairs</p><p>\n\n<b>Peter:</b> Btw? Hand-holding? Money!!!</p><p>\n\nYou walked into the common room before Ned could reply, but Peter felt his phone buzz once, twice, thrice &ndash; too many times to count. Peter sat down on the couch while you walked into the kitchen, offering snacks. When you brought the popcorn back, you sat down on the same couch as Peter but with a cushion in between you.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;What do you want to do? Game? Movie? Other?&rdquo; Peter chastised himself. <i>Why would I throw out &lsquo;other?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s so weird!</i></p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m up for whatever,&rdquo; you confided. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really sure what all our options are, but if we go the game route, you should know that I&rsquo;m very, very competitive.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see it,&rdquo; Peter teased, setting up some video game while you dug into the popcorn. With JARVIS&rsquo; help, he eventually got Mario Kart up and running and showed you how to play.</p><p>\n\nHe started you off easy, helping you pick your character and bike so you wouldn&rsquo;t be totally at a loss. It only took you beating him once for him to switch gears and go from trying to be nice and flirty to trash-talking up a storm. But you&rsquo;d be lying if you said you didn&rsquo;t do the same.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;TAKE THAT, LOSER!&rdquo; You yelled, jumping up on the couch as you threw a blue shell at his bike just a little bit up ahead. You could see the finish line on the last lap of Mushroom Gorge approaching and were not about to let him win.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;NOOOOOOO!&rdquo; He screamed, his bike spinning out and slowly sputtering back up to speed as you whipped by him. Within seconds you crossed the finish line, jumping around the room as he finished the race in second.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I win, you lose, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha,&rdquo; you mocked as he grimaced and glared at you.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I was being nice!&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Excuses, excuses, excuses&hellip;<i>Avengers</i> don&rsquo;t make excuses,&rdquo; you teased, rubbing salt in the wound.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he said coyly, a smirk growing on his face. &ldquo;Rematch. Rainbow Road. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nYou hopped back into your spot on the couch while he started up the next race, accepting his challenge without hesitation. Before you knew it, the countdown started and you floored it immediately.</p><p>\n\nYou took turns in first and second, constantly getting power-ups and passing each other. None of the computer players were anywhere close from the moment the race started, but both of you knew they weren&rsquo;t the competition. Near the end, Peter used the heavy weight of his character and pushed your light-weight character off the track, causing you to lose enough precious time that there was no way you&rsquo;d catch him in the last quarter-lap. Sure enough, he crossed the finish line first and quickly seized the opportunity to gloat.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I win, you lose, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha,&rdquo; he sang in the same tune you had, mocking your enthusiasm from before.</p><p>\n\nWithout skipping a beat, you whipped around to face him. &ldquo;Best two-out-of-three!&rdquo; Playful grins spreading on both your faces, he set up another race.</p><p>\n\nYou took turns winning race after race, upping the stakes more and more until finally you nearly did every race in the game. He&rsquo;d win one, you&rsquo;d win two, he&rsquo;d win two, you&rsquo;d win one &ndash; it went on and on until finally you slumped back on the couch and closed your eyes.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Peter, I think we&rsquo;re even,&rdquo; you said, hoping he&rsquo;d agree.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Yeah, I think you&rsquo;re right. Are you comfy there?&rdquo; He kicked your foot a little, teasing you for completely spreading out like a starfish.</p><p>\n\nYou didn&rsquo;t flinch. &ldquo;Yes, quite comfy, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nHe snagged a blanket from another chair and threw it at you, expecting you to jump up. But again, you didn&rsquo;t flinch, and just laid peacefully with the blanket now draped over your whole body. He laughed again and stepped over to you, pulling only the top of the blanket by your head back and peaking under so he could see your face.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;WANNA WATCH A MOVIE?&rdquo; You nearly shouted when his face appeared at the top of the blanket. He leapt back in shock and nearly fell over the coffee table but recovered his balance just in time. You pulled back the rest of the blanket, laughing so hard there was no sound coming out and you were nearly in tears.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;You scared me&hellip;<i>so badly&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Yeah, I know. So, what movie do you want to watch?&rdquo; You continued laughing and readjusted yourself on the couch. It was only 10:30, which was late for you, but you figured there would be noise in the compound until midnight.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Hmm. What&rsquo;s your favorite movie?&rdquo; Peter sat back down on the couch right next to you.</p><p>\n\n &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t really seen many movies; I don&rsquo;t know if I have a favorite. Most of the ones I got to watch were animated kids&rsquo; movies,&rdquo; you confided, slinking back into the couch as you spoke. You weren&rsquo;t embarrassed about it, but everything had been going so well with Peter and you didn&rsquo;t want that to change. The last thing you wanted to do was say the wrong thing.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Wait, wait, wait,&rdquo; Peter twisted himself on the couch to face you and froze. &ldquo;Please tell me you&rsquo;ve at least seen <i>Star Wars?&rdquo;</i> You shook your head, suddenly concerned he wouldn&rsquo;t like you or something because of it.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;NO WAY. We have to watch it. Right now.&rdquo; His eyes danced with excitement completely contrary to what you expected. &ldquo;Maybe all of them. You have to see them. I&rsquo;m going to watch every single one of them with you and we&rsquo;re starting right now.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;All of them? How many are there?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Well, seven currently. Six original, a new one came out in 2015, and the one after that comes out this December, and the one after that comes out in 2019! Plus, there&rsquo;s a spin-off movie that came out in 2016&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Hang on. That&rsquo;s a lot of movies. It&rsquo;s 10:30, Peter. What&rsquo;s the first one?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;Episode IV.&rdquo;</i></p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Well that makes no sense,&rdquo; you mocked as he grabbed your arm and shook you.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;TRUST ME, PLEASE Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Ok! Ok! Calm down, Peter, I&rsquo;ll watch your war of the stars movie,&rdquo; you teased, smirking at how exasperated he seemed with you calling the series you did in fact know the name of by the wrong name. &ldquo;JARVIS, can you play <i>Star Wars: Episode IV,</i> please?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Right away, Miss.&rdquo; The TV screen switched off from Mario Kart before showing the opening credits of the movie.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Oh my gosh! This is important, you have to read this,&rdquo; Peter exclaimed, sitting back down next to you. You just looked at him and smiled at the boy pointing at the screen, so passionate about this movie.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Y/N, I told you, you have to read this!&rdquo; He could feel your eyes on him and turned to look, his voice sounding nearly frustrated. You immediately burst out laughing.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?!&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;You, you goofball! You&rsquo;re so excited!&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Of course I am! I get to sit with you and see you enjoy my favorite movies for the first time!&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Ok, that&rsquo;s pretty sweet,&rdquo; you admitted.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I guess I understand why you&rsquo;re being a dork.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Hey&mdash;&rdquo; he started, but you were grinning wildly and already rewinding the movie to go back to the start. He sighed, content now, and sat facing forward again right next to you while the opening credits rolled for real. He looked over at you again, staring at your eyes. And this time, you were reading. Every single word.</p><hr /><p>\n\n\n\nBack down at the gala, Tony felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He excused himself and stepped outside. Looking down at his phone again, he couldn&rsquo;t figure out why the Secretary of State himself would be calling <i>him</i> of all people, especially so late on a Saturday.</p><p>\n\nHappy let him through the main doors and he traced the path back to the common room as he answered. <i>Might as well check on the lovebirds,</i> he thought as he hit accept on the call.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Tony Stark, good to hear your voice.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I wish I could say the same, Ross,&rdquo; Tony sassed.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I have some news for you and your gang, Stark, and I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;re going to like it,&rdquo; Thaddeus Ross explained. Tony reached the common room now and smiled seeing it illuminated by a movie he instantly recognized.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Given the events that occurred in Sokovia, the United Nations has decided that powers such as your Avengers need to be kept in check. We&rsquo;re giving you an ultimatum.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Sorry to burst your bubble, but we aren&rsquo;t going to propose to you any time soon.&rdquo; Tony stepped around the couch and, despite the tension he felt through the phone and the straightforward dislike he had for the man he was talking too, his heart warmed at seeing you and Peter on the couch. After the movie started, you had quickly dozed off, losing control of your head on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder. Peter trying his best not to squirm and upset you, somehow got his phone out of his pocket and texted Ned. He didn&rsquo;t want to move you, though, and ended up falling asleep himself and his head had dropped on top of yours.</p><p>\n\nRoss&rsquo; voice on the other end of the line snapped Tony back to reality. I&rsquo;ll tease them in the morning, he decided. &ldquo;We have a proposal for <i>you,</i> actually. It goes like this: either you sign some accords we&rsquo;ve written up and agree to only be dispatched when the United Nations deems necessary,&rdquo; he started while Tony grabbed the blanket on the floor that Peter had thrown at you earlier. &ldquo;Or you become criminals.&rdquo; Trying to avoid the crisis on the phone, Tony draped the blanket over you and Peter and leaned down to kiss your forehead. You shifted as he stepped back from you and he worried he woke you up, but instead you snuggled further into Peter&rsquo;s side and brought a smile to Tony&rsquo;s face.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t going to like this,&rdquo; Tony said into the phone.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have a choice,&rdquo; Ross replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there with the documents tomorrow for your team to make a decision.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nWith that, the call clicked off. Tony could sense there would be disagreements about what was about to take place with these so-called accords and hoped that none of it would impact either of you kids. Ignoring the problem he would have to confront tomorrow, he switched his phone to camera and took a quick picture of you and Peter, being sure to send it to all the Avengers (yourselves included) before cautiously heading back to end the party. \n</p>\n\n<p><b>taglist: </b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4U3Qv6EybA2SJYW6mZO5fQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starksnack</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzv9-KqY2nwVns3bh-ocUTA\" target=\"_blank\">@hollandbabesblog</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/184632134053/in-my-way-7\" target=\"_blank\">previous chapter (7)</a> | <a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/181672022943/inmyway\" target=\"_blank\">series masterlist</a> | <a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/184956278498/in-my-way-9\" target=\"_blank\"> next chapter (9)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/post/181671397318/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">masterlist</a> | <a href=\"https://myspideysensesrtingling.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">taglist</a></p>",

She told you she would do your hair and makeup for the gala so that all you had to do was get dressed when it was time. While you were excited to get totally dressed up, she was definitely more excited than you were. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more fun to stay in pajamas and hang out with friends?\n</p>\n</p>",
