No one knew you were here at this particular hotel, and you hadn\u2019t requested any backup. Tony had asked you to head downtown, checked you into a swanky hotel, wanting you to keep a close eye on a newly appointed government official. One that may or may not have been dipping a toe or two into Hydra\u2019s \u00a0pool of scum. \u00a0It was a walk in the park assignment, and you didn\u2019t need the help, as it was a simple watch and see what happens type of task. \u00a0Making sure you were decent, tying an extra loop in your belt, you call through to your unannounced visitors.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Your voice a bit higher than normal, faking a sweet innocence. </p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, we\u2019re from hotel maintenance. We have an order request. Did you call regarding your tv service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy tv service? What?\u201d Mumbling to yourself in confusion, you look through the door to see two slightly familiar faces, one of them pressing his eye closer to the peephole, giving himself a distorted fisheye look. </p><p>Opening the door, you stare, completely unamused at the two men in front of. One wearing a fake mustache, the other under a hat. Both wearing blue and white pinstripe hotel maintenance shirts with matching name tags. </p><p>\u201cMiss, we\u2019re here to fix your box.\u201d The man in the hat says, attempting to play off a sexy side grin. </p><p>\u201cThis feels like the beginning of a bad porn\u2026\u201d You announce to the workers.</p><p>\u201cOr a good one, depending on how you look at it.\u201d The man with the mustache says, as he strokes the end of the cable wires he has looped over his shoulder. </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m looking at it, and I have to be honest with you, I would not rent it. Lucky for me, it seems I won\u2019t have to, as I\u2019ve just learned my cable is broken.\u201d As you start to close your door, a small voice speaks into your ear.</p><p>\u201cWould you let them in already.\u201d The sound of Tony\u2019s voice bellows through your head, with a hint of urgency.</p><p>Scoffing, you roll your eyes, opening the door for the \u201cCablemen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought you could use some help.\u201d You can hear his smug tone from within.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you send Sam and Clint then?\u201d Your eyes follow them as they set down the wires, and cables on the table, and begin to make themselves at home, grabbing drinks, and laying down on the bed. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I thought you could use some company.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA bottle of wine would have been great company.\u201d You mumble back.</p><p>\u201cOnly one bed, huh? Nice.\u201d Sam nods his head, shifting his eyebrows up and down. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to blow my cover.\u201d You kick Sam off the bed and watch as they begin to set up a small receiver, running cables all along the wall between your room and the official\u2019s room next door.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s blowing anything.\u201d Clint speaks quietly as he secures the receiver in place. </p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s blowing\u2026.What kind of porno is this?\u201d Sam throws his hands up, speaking to the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing anyway? I&rsquo;ve already set up the mics and computer. I\u2019ve been recording for hours. He hasn&rsquo;t said anything useful yet. He does, however, have a meeting at 8pm with a guest that has yet to be named.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to snake this through the vent to his room for a live camera feed.\u201d Clint says as he pulls a chair over to a small vent located near your bathroom door. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s&hellip;actually helpful.\u201d You tip your head in approval, standing next to him to hold the wires, turning to Sam as he attempts to log into your computer.</p><p>\u201cUsername?\u201d He asks while adjusting your screen. </p><p>\u201cBestAvenger.\u201d You respond as you help Clint with the wire. </p><p>\u201cPassword?\u201d He asks while typing in your username, shaking his head, mumbling about lies and such.</p><p>\u201cFalconistweetybirdsbitch1. All caps.\u201d</p><p>Clint stops, closing his eyes tight, and dropping his head, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not typing that.\u201d He folds his arms, glaring up at you.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019re not getting your live feed then.\u201d Clint looks at you, clearly amused at your chosen password, while also giving you the slight look of annoyance, knowing you knew damn well you guys needed this intel. </p><p>\u201cWould you go help him&hellip;and also fix your robe, I can see everything from up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop looking at my boobs, Clint,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings one would never say in a porno\u2026\u201d Sam sits back and waits for your help, pointing to your computer with an expected look.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d You grab onto the laptop, sliding it to you.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really your password is it?\u201d Sam chuckles a bit, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was just kidding.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood. I was gonna \u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s RecycleRedwing18.\u201d \u00a0You type in the real password, but all he hears in the log in sound, and he glares in disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou come up with that all by yourself?\u201d He asks, throwing you a snarky glare.</p><p>\u201cNo, Bucky did.\u201d He squints harder at you, and you pretend not to see it. \u201cI wanted it to be Only1birdHawk4life, but he had already taken it.\u201d You didn\u2019t have to look to know that Clint was trying to hold in his laughter from across the room. </p><p>\u201cJerks.\u201d Sam walks over to help Clint finish connecting all the wires to the laptop, muttering under his breath about how he hates when you hang out with Bucky, and you can just barely make out the phrase \u201cI\u2019d like to recycle his old ass. I\u2019m gonna change my password to Scrapmetalsoldier101, or&hellip; Winterwasteofspace17. I\u2019ll show them.\u201d</p><p>Clint just holds his fist out for a quick bump to show he has Sam\u2019s back, and then continues to work.</p><p>Fifteen minutes, ten curse words, and five Bucky bashing passwords later, you finally get a picture and sound of the official in question next door.</p><p>\u201cThere we go. Hey, I know that guy! Steve and I ran into him a few months back. He\u2019s definitely Hydra. He was running a base in Sokovia, but then transferred out to Germany. \u00a0He\u2019s bad stuff.\u201d You snap a picture with your phone, and send the message off Steve\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cThey have weapons, Y/N.\u201d Clint points to the monitors, and holds an earphone to his head. \u201cLooks like they\u2019re trying to move them, selling them to the biggest player.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s take some pics of what we can, and record audio, I\u2019ll send it all to\u2026\u201d \u00a0A sudden knock on the door makes you all jump to action, all pulling weapons and surrounding the door. You carefully approach, a knife behind your back. \u201cTony, who else did you send?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. Just the birds. What\u2019s happening?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot sure, stand by.\u201d You slowly lean into the peephole once again, and breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Clint whispers from next to you.</p><p>You swing open the door, and smirk at the handsome man in front of you. Cleanly shaven, black slacks, crisp white shirt and tie, and wearing a small apron around his waist. \u00a0\u201cNow this right here, is what a good porn entrance looks like boys.\u201d </p><p>Holding on to a cart covered in a silky white tablecloth, multiple serving dishes with lids, and a small orchid, he rolls gently through the door.</p><p>\u201cYou ordered room service?\u201d He asks smoothly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, but if your fine ass is delivering, I\u2019ll happily take it. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she said.\u201d Sam chuckles out to you all. </p><p>\u201cYes, I know that\u2019s what she said , as I, she, just said it.\u201d </p><p>He mumbles something unrecognizable into the computer. </p><p>\u201dWhat\u2019s on the menu this evening?\u201d \u00a0You smile at the sight before you. Bucky looked good in dress clothes, not to mention his hair slicked back into a low bun.</p><p>\u201cTonight, the hotel is serving some of Shield\u2019s finest.\u201d He lifts the covers of each dish to reveal, guns, knives, comms, and radios. \u00a0You start unloading them onto the bed, taking stock, each claiming a weapon or device for your own.</p><p>\u201cWell, this all looks fantastic, but I just have one question.\u201d You ask, placing the covers back on carefully. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Buck?\u201d You walk away from the cart, and take your seat in front of the computer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad. I was against it. I told Steve you would be fine, but\u2026</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d You question.</p><p>\u201cBuuut, once Steve found out that Tony had sent these two asshats over, he figured you could use some actual help.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any help.\u201d You sigh in complete and utter annoyance.</p><p>\u201cI know, I told him that too, but you know how he gets.\u201d You watch as he looks around the room. \u201cThere\u2019s only one bed in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does everyone keep asking that? Yes, there is only one bed, as there was only supposed to be ONE person here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t plan on staying. I have a room on the next floor down.\u201d Bucky stops, \u00a0eyes wide as he sees your mouth drop, ready to scream at him.</p><p>\u201cBefore you start\u2026. I did it because I wanted to be close, just in case. I had no intentions of ever getting involved in this until Steve texted me the pic you sent him. That guy is bad news, and there was no fucking way you were taking him down without back-up&hellip;if needed.\u201d He put his hands out, trying to subdue your inner anger.</p><p>\u201cHow am I going to get you guys all out of here without looking suspicious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave in a few minutes, after I check out the feed, and go change. I can reroute it to my phone, so I can watch from anywhere in the hotel. I don\u2019t know about those two though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone see you come in here?\u201d You ask, already knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, my first day of preschool?\u201d Bucky shoots back.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well I have to get you guys out, because it actually is starting to look like I\u2019m entertaining a few gentleman callers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially with the robe, what\u2019s going on there?\u201d Bucky swirls his finger in your direction.</p><p>\u201cUghhh, I was about to get in the shower when those two came to \u2018fix my box,\u2019 as they so eloquently put it. Don\u2019t smirk at that, it\u2019s not funny.\u201d Placing your hand on your hips, you can\u2019t even believe that Bucky has fallen into the trap of stupidity.</p><p>\u201cEhhh, it\u2019s a little funny.\u201d He says, nodding to the boys in the corner in approval. \u201cI mean, two guys in work shirts, and a fake mustache? It kind of does scream seventies love den.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, with your room service crap and all? It wasn\u2019t any better than our idea.\u201d Sam pipes up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Of course it\u2019s better! It\u2019s highly likely I\u2019m going to order room service. He can deliver!\u201d You spout back to Sam.</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t think I can deliver?\u201d Sam gets up, becoming a bit too cocky for his own good.</p><p>\u201cYou&hellip;deliver? No. Mail&hellip;maybe, a pizza&hellip;yes&hellip;but that package right there\u2026\u201d You say pointing to Bucky. \u201cIts takes a different kind of man to drive that package home.\u201d</p><p>Bucky winks your way, as you nod back and smirk. You two were best friends, and you would never cross that line, but you both personally got off on driving Sam crazy at any and all costs.</p><p>\u201cOh, I can drive it home, girl. Don\u2019t you worry. This package is ready for delivery all year long.\u201d Sam approaches you, mock flirting, and teasing.</p><p>\u201cWhat is happening over there, and why am I listening to Sam talk about his package?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSteve, nice of you to join us.\u201d The deep sound of Steve\u2019s voice travels through your head. \u201cAlso, it\u2019s better you don\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy that. How are you doing? Any word on their plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeapons and tech. Big supply too, Steve.\u201d Bucky starts to get a count while he watches the monitor.</p><p>\u201cKeep me updated. What\u2019s everyone\u2019s plan?\u201d Steve questions into everyone\u2019s comms.</p><p>\u201cBucky is leaving in a few, Sam and Clint are heading out within the hour. \u00a0They\u2019ve been here for a bit, and I don\u2019t want it to look weird. So far, anyone who is willing to watch, has seen three men enter my room, and no one has left yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet them out soon. I don\u2019t want to miss this chance. This guy is a heavy hitter. Shield wants him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy that, Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky, stay close. Clint, Sam, where is your safe house, so to speak?\u201d Steve makes a mental note of everyone\u2019s plan. </p><p>\u201cTony got us a room three floors up, employee floooor.\u201d Clint voice drops out, realizing that he had now just blown his cover with you, and that you know knew that damn near everybody was here \u201chelping\u201d you out with what was supposed to be a single person recon order.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d You yell, causing everyone to throw a hand to their ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve reached Stark Industries. New York\u2019s personal savior is out saving the world at this time, please leave\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a piece of\u2026\u201d</p><p>You swear, a fraction of a second hadn\u2019t even passed before you felt Bucky grab you from behind, spinning you, placing his full body in front of you like a solid brick wall, metal arm gripped tightly on a gun pointing towards the door. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fu\u2026\u201d \u00a0Your shoulders jump as the lightest of knocks can be heard. </p><p>Bucky looks at the three of you, as Sam and you shake your head with confusion.</p><p>Clint steps off the bed and starts to head towards the door.</p><p>\u201cGeez, freak out much? I ordered Pizza, relax. So damn jumpy all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClint, why would you order pizza? I just \u201cordered\u201d room service!\u201d You quietly scream at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but your \u2018room service\u2019 isn\u2019t going to feed four of us, and it\u2019s getting late, and I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Bucky steps behind the door, waving the other two out of sight. After a quick nod your way, you ask who it is, and the reply is what you were waiting for.</p><p>\u201cPizza delivery ma\u2019am.\u201d The timid voice says. </p><p>\u201cYou have got to be kidding me right now.\u201d You know that voice like your own.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, another actor perhaps?\u201d Sam grins as he taps his fingers together in anticipation while you open the door. \u201cYeah, baby..Bow chicka wow wo&hellip;NO! No, I am not going to prison!\u201d</p><p>You emit a high pitched hum as you see who is standing in front of you. Grabbing him by the collar and hood, you pull him in the room as fast as you can without hurting him.</p><p>He stares at you all, ready to burst with a full spectrum of emotions. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Parker?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, what are you guys doing here? Tony told me this was my first single mission!\u201d He yells in a loud whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou and me both kid.\u201d You say, somewhat gently slamming the door.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to be here. Things look pretty covered.\u201d Peter says \u00a0looking around the room, giving a quick nod and salute to Bucky behind the door. \u201cMr. Winter&hellip;Barnes, Bucky, sir. Hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Bucky, I\u2019ve told you that. What are you doing here?\u201d Bucky drops his weapon, and approaches his calmly.</p><p>\u201cI sent him.\u201d Tony speaks through. I was tired of listening to all the gross innuendos, so I sent in Parker so you would all behave.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony! Are you serious right now, what if he gets hurt?\u201d Steve yells over the comms.</p><p>\u201cRelax, spangles, he\u2019s going to leave in a minute, right Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d He says holding his hand to his ear.</p><p>\u201cNo Tony, \u00a0he\u2019s not leaving. It\u2019s not safe now. \u00a0Fuck! Sorry, Frick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Y/N.\u201d He says sitting on the bed, unsure as to what to do in this tense situation.</p><p>\u201cBucky, you have to go. Wait down the hallway, and I\u2019ll send Peter out. He stays with you until we leave tonight. Peter, you meet Bucky in two, and I want a confirmation of meetup as soon as you reach him in the hallway. Got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan Y/N? Bucky asks waiting for further instructions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d You head into the bedroom and change into your bathing suit. \u201cI\u2019m going to get out of here for a bit. Give the \u2018repairman\u2019 time to work. I\u2019ll come back in thirty minutes, which is when you two will head back to your room, and we can end this shit show of a mission. Everyone clear on what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>A collection of six voices confirm a yes. </p><p>\u201cGood. Bucky, you\u2019re up.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGive me five kid. Southwest corner.\u201d \u00a0Bucky rolls his cart out of the room,a nd heads down towards the service elevators. Placing your hands on Peter\u2019s arms, you explain his next moves. </p><p>\u201cRight to him, ya got it? Don\u2019t talk to anyone, do not engage with anyone. Do you understand me?\u201d \u00a0Giving him a stern look, you nod towards to the door.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d You open the door for Peter, and he heads left.</p><p>Waiting a few minutes in between their departures, you stop to roll your eyes at how absolutely ridiculous this whole scene is. You head to the bedroom once again, throwing a cover up on, before exiting the room.</p><p> \u201cBucky&hellip;status?\u201d You question into your comm.</p><p>\u201cThe spider is in the web.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Okay, boys, I\u2019ll be back in thirty. If anything happens before then, you know what to do.\u201d \u00a0You leave the room, casually turning back to make somewhat of a \u201cscene\u201d in case anyone happened to be wandering by. \u201cIt\u2019s really no rush. I\u2019m on vacation, take your time. I\u2019ll be by the pool relaxing. Thank you again!\u201d </p><p>Sam gives you the finger as you flash him your biggest feux grin.</p><p>You check your comm device as you head down the hallway and into the elevator. Rubbing the stress from your forehead, you make your way from the building, venturing towards the beautiful pool, surrounded by trees, and cabanas. Just five minutes to think is all I need, you repeat to yourself, over and over again. Walking along the edge of the pool, you find a small hut like cabana to settle into. You lay the chair back a few inches, basking in the soft glow of the sun, the smell of coconuts drifting upwards towards you, calming you almost instantly. A young handsome waiter comes to take your drink order, and you ask for a simple sparkling water, not wanting anything to take you off your game should a fight happen. A small glass bottle is placed next to the book that you had brought down to \u201cread.\u201d Inside of the cover was nothing more than a dug out hole, that housed a small camera. One of the many items that Bucky had brought to the room. After downing half of your water, you pick up your book, and begin to dive into the storyline. You watched as the two main characters in your book spoke about \u00a0weapons for sale, targets they have killed, and soldiers of note that had expertise that could vouch for them. You reach over to take another sip of your water, the heat beginning to make you sweat a bit.</p><p>\u201cGo away, I\u2019m undercover.\u201d Pulling up your legs, you rest the book on top of your knees, and never look up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to help, just watch.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI swear when I get back, Tony is a\u2026\u201d You mumble under your breath, trying best as you can not to move your lips.</p><p>\u201cI sent her. It\u2019s not for you, it\u2019s for Bucky.\u201d Steve sounds serious this time. \u201cI did some more research on that agent after the last mission. It turns out, he played a big part in Pierce\u2019s game. He was with Bucky when he was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more. Does Bucky know?\u201d \u00a0Praying the answer was no, you take another sip of water, placing your head back down on the chair.</p><p>\u201cNo, and I would like to keep it that way.\u201d Steve states firmly.</p><p>\u201cAnother secret placed in my vault. Check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N? \u00a0Uhhh, we may or may not have a situation up here.\u201d You can hear the slight panic in Clint\u2019s voice, and you know something is wrong. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Clint?\u201d Looking over at Wanda who is in a cover up with a baseball cap, you motion for her to get out of the area, and go back to her stationed post.</p><p>\u201cUmm, we have Bucky here, and he\u2019s pretty upset. You may want to get up here sooner than later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N&hellip;he knows.\u201d The tone of Steve\u2019s voice told you all you needed to know. Taking two steps up the stairs at a time, you run as casually as you can making sure no one heard you booking down the hall.</p><p>The small circle on the keypad turns green, giving you access to enter your temporary room.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell happened?\u201d \u00a0Your eyes pop as your jaw widens at the sight in front of you.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t stop hitting me!\u201d Clint tries to speak every word but all you can hear are mumbles and slurs as Bucky presses his hand into his face, trying to push any part of Clint\u2019s body that he has access to. </p><p>\u201cYeah, now you know how it feels! It hurts when you get bit doesn\u2019t it!\u201d \u00a0Sam presses all of his weight onto Bucky\u2019s metal arm while straddling his chest. Bucky tosses the two of them around like two toddlers on a bucking bronco, while you just stare in shock. </p><p>\u201cA little help here would be nice! OW! NO! Bad Bucky!\u201d You run to the three of them as Sam starts to discipline Bucky by placing sharp slaps to his forehead. \u201cPinch me one more time, I swear!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI left you guys for twenty minutes!\u201d Jumping onto Bucky\u2019s legs he tries to buckle hard underneath you in an attempt to flip you all off. \u00a0He manages to flip Sam off finally, leaving Clint and you alone to tame the beast. Clint gets tossed after one metal punch to his ribs, and just like that, it\u2019s you alone for the ride. You feel him start to grab your leg and twist, and you think fast, knowing you can\u2019t take him alone. </p><p><i>I am so sick of this shit. I\u2019m ending this now.</i></p><p>Flipping your body in ways unimaginable, you manage to lock his head between your legs. You see him turn his head, as if he was really considering his next move carefully. Your expression turns to shock as he opens his mouth, teeth bared. </p><p><i>Is this mother about to bite me? Oh Hell no\u2026</i></p><p>Twisting your legs, you tighten your grip around his neck, and jerk hard while grabbing a handful of his most prized position. You open your mouth and slam your head down towards his lap. Just as you are about to bite he recoils, his eyes flashing a hint of fear and pain.</p><p>\u201cSTOP!\u201d He wails as you tighten your grip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop when you stop! \u00a0Don\u2019t fuck with me Barnes! I can play the biting game too, only I play to win.\u201d You can hear his neck crack as you twist your knees.</p><p>Putting his hand up in defense, he drops his head to the floor, panting, relief washing over his features.</p><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d Asking as you maintain your grip. </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He breathes out.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Raising your eyebrows, you stare menacingly his way, threatening him, and he knew it was true.</p><p>\u201cPlease let go.\u201d He begs</p><p>\u201cSay your sorry.\u201d \u00a0You demand</p><p>Clint and Sam sit on the floor next to you, panting, rubbing various parts of their body that Bucky had assaulted.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He mumbles out quietly, but you know he doesn\u2019t mean it.</p><p>\u201cBucky\u2026like you mean it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, because <i>I don\u2019t</i> mean\u2026 Ow Ow OWWW! Okay, \u00a0I\u2019m sorry&hellip; shit!\u201d </p><p>\u201cSay it to them! You probably broke Clint\u2019s ribs, and you bit Sam. You bit someone, dude. I mean, what the fu\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bit someone?\u201d A deep voice sounds out.</p><p>\u201cNot now Steve!\u201d All four of you shout into your comms.</p><p>\u201cAlright, take it easy.\u201d You can hear Steve\u2019s annoyed tone, and it\u2019s not helping.</p><p>Rolling off of Bucky, you fall onto your back, but not before giving him a not so gentle kick to the side of his calf.</p><p>\u201cI hate you sometimes.\u201d You speak into the air, panting on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI hate me too.\u201d Bucky replies back, just as out of breath as the rest of you. </p><p>\u201cI second that&hellip;or third that? \u00a0I hate myself sometimes.\u201d Clint mumbles while massaging his side.</p><p>\u201cI hate all of you too, so can you please just shut up?\u201d Sam throws a kick to Bucky\u2019s other leg.</p><p>Finally being able to catch your breath, sitting up, looking at the other three hot messes in front of you, you stop and question what had started this whole act of idiocracy to begin with. </p><p>\u201cSomeone want to tell me what happened?\u201d </p><p>Clint and Sam both point in Bucky\u2019s direction. \u201cHe started it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did.\u201d<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVoRn0Y6fH_fqa5qDidsWSQ\">@schilj79</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a>\u00a0@fuckmeupsebastian <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnTFn521ZEBJro32JhPBZGw\">@awkward-sydney</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a>\u00a0@samstuffworld @10robins \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp757tS4u6WsQaOYvTJ33bQ\">@lordemjay</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLKe0ai32q0pHD9A1g2R2g\">@lovemarvelousfics</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfzvEX9P8FUtHkeUq7TMR5Q\">@elishamcloughlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m08K--JEIOUffGaqd6YUOCw\">@quotemeow</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb4rvr_8QAxikDvWTjb7nQA\">@alycu1</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\">@redqueen1221</a></p><p>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a></p>",

Lucky for me, it seems I won\u2019t have to, as I\u2019ve just learned my cable is broken.\u201d As you start to close your door, a small voice speaks into your ear.</p><p>\u201cWould you let them in already.\u201d The sound of Tony\u2019s voice bellows through your head, with a hint of urgency.</p><p>Scoffing, you roll your eyes, opening the door for the \u201cCablemen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought you could use some help.\u201d You can hear his smug tone from within.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you send Sam and Clint then?\u201d Your eyes follow them as they set down the wires, and cables on the table, and begin to make themselves at home, grabbing drinks, and laying down on the bed. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I thought you could use some company.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA bottle of wine would have been great company.\u201d You mumble back.</p><p>\u201cOnly one bed, huh? Nice.\u201d Sam nods his head, shifting his eyebrows up and down. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to blow my cover.\u201d You kick Sam off the bed and watch as they begin to set up a small receiver, running cables all along the wall between your room and the official\u2019s room next door.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s blowing anything.\u201d Clint speaks quietly as he secures the receiver in place. </p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s blowing\u2026.What kind of porno is this?\u201d Sam throws his hands up, speaking to the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing anyway? I\u2019ve already set up the mics and computer. I\u2019ve been recording for hours. He hasn\u2019t said anything useful yet. He does, however, have a meeting at 8pm with a guest that has yet to be named.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to snake this through the vent to his room for a live camera feed.\u201d Clint says as he pulls a chair over to a small vent located near your bathroom door. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026actually helpful.\u201d You tip your head in approval, standing next to him to hold the wires, turning to Sam as he attempts to log into your computer.</p><p>\u201cUsername?\u201d He asks while adjusting your screen. </p><p>\u201cBestAvenger.\u201d You respond as you help Clint with the wire. </p><p>\u201cPassword?\u201d He asks while typing in your username, shaking his head, mumbling about lies and such.</p><p>\u201cFalconistweetybirdsbitch1. All caps.\u201d</p><p>Clint stops, closing his eyes tight, and dropping his head, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not typing that.\u201d He folds his arms, glaring up at you.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019re not getting your live feed then.\u201d Clint looks at you, clearly amused at your chosen password, while also giving you the slight look of annoyance, knowing you knew damn well you guys needed this intel. </p><p>\u201cWould you go help him\u2026and also fix your robe, I can see everything from up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop looking at my boobs, Clint,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings one would never say in a porno\u2026\u201d Sam sits back and waits for your help, pointing to your computer with an expected look.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d You grab onto the laptop, sliding it to you.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really your password is it?\u201d Sam chuckles a bit, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was just kidding.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood. I was gonna \u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s RecycleRedwing18.\u201d \u00a0You type in the real password, but all he hears in the log in sound, and he glares in disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou come up with that all by yourself?\u201d He asks, throwing you a snarky glare.</p><p>\u201cNo, Bucky did.\u201d He squints harder at you, and you pretend not to see it. \u201cI wanted it to be Only1birdHawk4life, but he had already taken it.\u201d You didn\u2019t have to look to know that Clint was trying to hold in his laughter from across the room. </p><p>\u201cJerks.\u201d Sam walks over to help Clint finish connecting all the wires to the laptop, muttering under his breath about how he hates when you hang out with Bucky, and you can just barely make out the phrase \u201cI\u2019d like to recycle his old ass. I\u2019m gonna change my password to Scrapmetalsoldier101, or\u2026 Winterwasteofspace17. I\u2019ll show them.\u201d</p><p>Clint just holds his fist out for a quick bump to show he has Sam\u2019s back, and then continues to work.</p><p>Fifteen minutes, ten curse words, and five Bucky bashing passwords later, you finally get a picture and sound of the official in question next door.</p><p>\u201cThere we go. Hey, I know that guy! Steve and I ran into him a few months back. He\u2019s definitely Hydra. He was running a base in Sokovia, but then transferred out to Germany. \u00a0He\u2019s bad stuff.\u201d You snap a picture with your phone, and send the message off Steve\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cThey have weapons, Y/N.\u201d Clint points to the monitors, and holds an earphone to his head. \u201cLooks like they\u2019re trying to move them, selling them to the biggest player.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s take some pics of what we can, and record audio, I\u2019ll send it all to\u2026\u201d \u00a0A sudden knock on the door makes you all jump to action, all pulling weapons and surrounding the door. You carefully approach, a knife behind your back. \u201cTony, who else did you send?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. Just the birds. What\u2019s happening?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot sure, stand by.\u201d You slowly lean into the peephole once again, and breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Clint whispers from next to you.</p><p>You swing open the door, and smirk at the handsome man in front of you. Cleanly shaven, black slacks, crisp white shirt and tie, and wearing a small apron around his waist. \u00a0\u201cNow this right here, is what a good porn entrance looks like boys.\u201d </p><p>Holding on to a cart covered in a silky white tablecloth, multiple serving dishes with lids, and a small orchid, he rolls gently through the door.</p><p>\u201cYou ordered room service?\u201d He asks smoothly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, but if your fine ass is delivering, I\u2019ll happily take it. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she said.\u201d Sam chuckles out to you all. </p><p>\u201cYes, I know that\u2019s what she said , as I, she, just said it.\u201d </p><p>He mumbles something unrecognizable into the computer. </p><p>\u201dWhat\u2019s on the menu this evening?\u201d \u00a0You smile at the sight before you. Bucky looked good in dress clothes, not to mention his hair slicked back into a low bun.</p><p>\u201cTonight, the hotel is serving some of Shield\u2019s finest.\u201d He lifts the covers of each dish to reveal, guns, knives, comms, and radios. \u00a0You start unloading them onto the bed, taking stock, each claiming a weapon or device for your own.</p><p>\u201cWell, this all looks fantastic, but I just have one question.\u201d You ask, placing the covers back on carefully. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Buck?\u201d You walk away from the cart, and take your seat in front of the computer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad. I was against it. I told Steve you would be fine, but\u2026</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d You question.</p><p>\u201cBuuut, once Steve found out that Tony had sent these two asshats over, he figured you could use some actual help.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any help.\u201d You sigh in complete and utter annoyance.</p><p>\u201cI know, I told him that too, but you know how he gets.\u201d You watch as he looks around the room. \u201cThere\u2019s only one bed in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does everyone keep asking that? Yes, there is only one bed, as there was only supposed to be ONE person here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t plan on staying. I have a room on the next floor down.\u201d Bucky stops, \u00a0eyes wide as he sees your mouth drop, ready to scream at him.</p><p>\u201cBefore you start\u2026. I did it because I wanted to be close, just in case. I had no intentions of ever getting involved in this until Steve texted me the pic you sent him. That guy is bad news, and there was no fucking way you were taking him down without back-up\u2026if needed.\u201d He put his hands out, trying to subdue your inner anger.</p><p>\u201cHow am I going to get you guys all out of here without looking suspicious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave in a few minutes, after I check out the feed, and go change. I can reroute it to my phone, so I can watch from anywhere in the hotel. I don\u2019t know about those two though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone see you come in here?\u201d You ask, already knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, my first day of preschool?\u201d Bucky shoots back.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well I have to get you guys out, because it actually is starting to look like I\u2019m entertaining a few gentleman callers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially with the robe, what\u2019s going on there?\u201d Bucky swirls his finger in your direction.</p><p>\u201cUghhh, I was about to get in the shower when those two came to \u2018fix my box,\u2019 as they so eloquently put it. Don\u2019t smirk at that, it\u2019s not funny.\u201d Placing your hand on your hips, you can\u2019t even believe that Bucky has fallen into the trap of stupidity.</p><p>\u201cEhhh, it\u2019s a little funny.\u201d He says, nodding to the boys in the corner in approval. \u201cI mean, two guys in work shirts, and a fake mustache? It kind of does scream seventies love den.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, with your room service crap and all? It wasn\u2019t any better than our idea.\u201d Sam pipes up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Of course it\u2019s better! It\u2019s highly likely I\u2019m going to order room service. He can deliver!\u201d You spout back to Sam.</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t think I can deliver?\u201d Sam gets up, becoming a bit too cocky for his own good.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026deliver? No. Mail\u2026maybe, a pizza\u2026yes\u2026but that package right there\u2026\u201d You say pointing to Bucky. \u201cIts takes a different kind of man to drive that package home.\u201d</p><p>Bucky winks your way, as you nod back and smirk. You two were best friends, and you would never cross that line, but you both personally got off on driving Sam crazy at any and all costs.</p><p>\u201cOh, I can drive it home, girl. Don\u2019t you worry. This package is ready for delivery all year long.\u201d Sam approaches you, mock flirting, and teasing.</p><p>\u201cWhat is happening over there, and why am I listening to Sam talk about his package?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSteve, nice of you to join us.\u201d The deep sound of Steve\u2019s voice travels through your head. \u201cAlso, it\u2019s better you don\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy that. How are you doing? Any word on their plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeapons and tech. Big supply too, Steve.\u201d Bucky starts to get a count while he watches the monitor.</p><p>\u201cKeep me updated. What\u2019s everyone\u2019s plan?\u201d Steve questions into everyone\u2019s comms.</p><p>\u201cBucky is leaving in a few, Sam and Clint are heading out within the hour. \u00a0They\u2019ve been here for a bit, and I don\u2019t want it to look weird. So far, anyone who is willing to watch, has seen three men enter my room, and no one has left yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet them out soon. I don\u2019t want to miss this chance. This guy is a heavy hitter. Shield wants him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy that, Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky, stay close. Clint, Sam, where is your safe house, so to speak?\u201d Steve makes a mental note of everyone\u2019s plan. </p><p>\u201cTony got us a room three floors up, employee floooor.\u201d Clint voice drops out, realizing that he had now just blown his cover with you, and that you know knew that damn near everybody was here \u201chelping\u201d you out with what was supposed to be a single person recon order.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d You yell, causing everyone to throw a hand to their ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve reached Stark Industries. New York\u2019s personal savior is out saving the world at this time, please leave\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a piece of\u2026\u201d</p><p>You swear, a fraction of a second hadn\u2019t even passed before you felt Bucky grab you from behind, spinning you, placing his full body in front of you like a solid brick wall, metal arm gripped tightly on a gun pointing towards the door. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fu\u2026\u201d \u00a0Your shoulders jump as the lightest of knocks can be heard. </p><p>Bucky looks at the three of you, as Sam and you shake your head with confusion.</p><p>Clint steps off the bed and starts to head towards the door.</p><p>\u201cGeez, freak out much? I ordered Pizza, relax. So damn jumpy all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClint, why would you order pizza? I just \u201cordered\u201d room service!\u201d You quietly scream at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but your \u2018room service\u2019 isn\u2019t going to feed four of us, and it\u2019s getting late, and I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Bucky steps behind the door, waving the other two out of sight. After a quick nod your way, you ask who it is, and the reply is what you were waiting for.</p><p>\u201cPizza delivery ma\u2019am.\u201d The timid voice says. </p><p>\u201cYou have got to be kidding me right now.\u201d You know that voice like your own.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, another actor perhaps?\u201d Sam grins as he taps his fingers together in anticipation while you open the door. \u201cYeah, baby..Bow chicka wow wo\u2026NO! No, I am not going to prison!\u201d</p><p>You emit a high pitched hum as you see who is standing in front of you. Grabbing him by the collar and hood, you pull him in the room as fast as you can without hurting him.</p><p>He stares at you all, ready to burst with a full spectrum of emotions. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Parker?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, what are you guys doing here? Tony told me this was my first single mission!\u201d He yells in a loud whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou and me both kid.\u201d You say, somewhat gently slamming the door.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to be here. Things look pretty covered.\u201d Peter says \u00a0looking around the room, giving a quick nod and salute to Bucky behind the door. \u201cMr. Winter\u2026Barnes, Bucky, sir. Hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Bucky, I\u2019ve told you that. What are you doing here?\u201d Bucky drops his weapon, and approaches his calmly.</p><p>\u201cI sent him.\u201d Tony speaks through. I was tired of listening to all the gross innuendos, so I sent in Parker so you would all behave.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony! Are you serious right now, what if he gets hurt?\u201d Steve yells over the comms.</p><p>\u201cRelax, spangles, he\u2019s going to leave in a minute, right Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d He says holding his hand to his ear.</p><p>\u201cNo Tony, \u00a0he\u2019s not leaving. It\u2019s not safe now. \u00a0Fuck! Sorry, Frick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Y/N.\u201d He says sitting on the bed, unsure as to what to do in this tense situation.</p><p>\u201cBucky, you have to go. Wait down the hallway, and I\u2019ll send Peter out. He stays with you until we leave tonight. Peter, you meet Bucky in two, and I want a confirmation of meetup as soon as you reach him in the hallway. Got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan Y/N? Bucky asks waiting for further instructions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d You head into the bedroom and change into your bathing suit. \u201cI\u2019m going to get out of here for a bit. Give the \u2018repairman\u2019 time to work. I\u2019ll come back in thirty minutes, which is when you two will head back to your room, and we can end this shit show of a mission. Everyone clear on what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>A collection of six voices confirm a yes. </p><p>\u201cGood. Bucky, you\u2019re up.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGive me five kid. Southwest corner.\u201d \u00a0Bucky rolls his cart out of the room,a nd heads down towards the service elevators. Placing your hands on Peter\u2019s arms, you explain his next moves. </p><p>\u201cRight to him, ya got it? Don\u2019t talk to anyone, do not engage with anyone. Do you understand me?\u201d \u00a0Giving him a stern look, you nod towards to the door.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d You open the door for Peter, and he heads left.</p><p>Waiting a few minutes in between their departures, you stop to roll your eyes at how absolutely ridiculous this whole scene is. You head to the bedroom once again, throwing a cover up on, before exiting the room.</p><p> \u201cBucky\u2026status?\u201d You question into your comm.</p><p>\u201cThe spider is in the web.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Okay, boys, I\u2019ll be back in thirty. If anything happens before then, you know what to do.\u201d \u00a0You leave the room, casually turning back to make somewhat of a \u201cscene\u201d in case anyone happened to be wandering by. \u201cIt\u2019s really no rush. I\u2019m on vacation, take your time. I\u2019ll be by the pool relaxing. Thank you again!\u201d </p><p>Sam gives you the finger as you flash him your biggest feux grin.</p><p>You check your comm device as you head down the hallway and into the elevator. Rubbing the stress from your forehead, you make your way from the building, venturing towards the beautiful pool, surrounded by trees, and cabanas. Just five minutes to think is all I need, you repeat to yourself, over and over again. Walking along the edge of the pool, you find a small hut like cabana to settle into. You lay the chair back a few inches, basking in the soft glow of the sun, the smell of coconuts drifting upwards towards you, calming you almost instantly. A young handsome waiter comes to take your drink order, and you ask for a simple sparkling water, not wanting anything to take you off your game should a fight happen. A small glass bottle is placed next to the book that you had brought down to \u201cread.\u201d Inside of the cover was nothing more than a dug out hole, that housed a small camera. One of the many items that Bucky had brought to the room. After downing half of your water, you pick up your book, and begin to dive into the storyline. You watched as the two main characters in your book spoke about \u00a0weapons for sale, targets they have killed, and soldiers of note that had expertise that could vouch for them. You reach over to take another sip of your water, the heat beginning to make you sweat a bit.</p><p>\u201cGo away, I\u2019m undercover.\u201d Pulling up your legs, you rest the book on top of your knees, and never look up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to help, just watch.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI swear when I get back, Tony is a\u2026\u201d You mumble under your breath, trying best as you can not to move your lips.</p><p>\u201cI sent her. It\u2019s not for you, it\u2019s for Bucky.\u201d Steve sounds serious this time. \u201cI did some more research on that agent after the last mission. It turns out, he played a big part in Pierce\u2019s game. He was with Bucky when he was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more. Does Bucky know?\u201d \u00a0Praying the answer was no, you take another sip of water, placing your head back down on the chair.</p><p>\u201cNo, and I would like to keep it that way.\u201d Steve states firmly.</p><p>\u201cAnother secret placed in my vault. Check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N? \u00a0Uhhh, we may or may not have a situation up here.\u201d You can hear the slight panic in Clint\u2019s voice, and you know something is wrong. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Clint?\u201d Looking over at Wanda who is in a cover up with a baseball cap, you motion for her to get out of the area, and go back to her stationed post.</p><p>\u201cUmm, we have Bucky here, and he\u2019s pretty upset. You may want to get up here sooner than later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026he knows.\u201d The tone of Steve\u2019s voice told you all you needed to know. Taking two steps up the stairs at a time, you run as casually as you can making sure no one heard you booking down the hall.</p><p>The small circle on the keypad turns green, giving you access to enter your temporary room.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell happened?\u201d \u00a0Your eyes pop as your jaw widens at the sight in front of you.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t stop hitting me!\u201d Clint tries to speak every word but all you can hear are mumbles and slurs as Bucky presses his hand into his face, trying to push any part of Clint\u2019s body that he has access to. </p><p>\u201cYeah, now you know how it feels! It hurts when you get bit doesn\u2019t it!\u201d \u00a0Sam presses all of his weight onto Bucky\u2019s metal arm while straddling his chest. Bucky tosses the two of them around like two toddlers on a bucking bronco, while you just stare in shock. </p><p>\u201cA little help here would be nice! OW! NO! Bad Bucky!\u201d You run to the three of them as Sam starts to discipline Bucky by placing sharp slaps to his forehead. \u201cPinch me one more time, I swear!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI left you guys for twenty minutes!\u201d Jumping onto Bucky\u2019s legs he tries to buckle hard underneath you in an attempt to flip you all off. \u00a0He manages to flip Sam off finally, leaving Clint and you alone to tame the beast. Clint gets tossed after one metal punch to his ribs, and just like that, it\u2019s you alone for the ride. You feel him start to grab your leg and twist, and you think fast, knowing you can\u2019t take him alone. </p><p><i>I am so sick of this shit. I\u2019m ending this now.</i></p><p>Flipping your body in ways unimaginable, you manage to lock his head between your legs. You see him turn his head, as if he was really considering his next move carefully. Your expression turns to shock as he opens his mouth, teeth bared. </p><p><i>Is this mother about to bite me? Oh Hell no\u2026</i></p><p>Twisting your legs, you tighten your grip around his neck, and jerk hard while grabbing a handful of his most prized position. You open your mouth and slam your head down towards his lap.

No one knew you were here at this particular hotel, and you hadn\u2019t requested any backup. Tony had asked you to head downtown, checked you into a swanky hotel, wanting you to keep a close eye on a newly appointed government official. One that may or may not have been dipping a toe or two into Hydra\u2019s \u00a0pool of scum. \u00a0It was a walk in the park assignment, and you didn\u2019t need the help, as it was a simple watch and see what happens type of task. \u00a0Making sure you were decent, tying an extra loop in your belt, you call through to your unannounced visitors.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Your voice a bit higher than normal, faking a sweet innocence. </p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, we\u2019re from hotel maintenance. We have an order request. Did you call regarding your tv service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy tv service? What?\u201d Mumbling to yourself in confusion, you look through the door to see two slightly familiar faces, one of them pressing his eye closer to the peephole, giving himself a distorted fisheye look. </p><p>Opening the door, you stare, completely unamused at the two men in front of. One wearing a fake mustache, the other under a hat. Both wearing blue and white pinstripe hotel maintenance shirts with matching name tags. </p><p>\u201cMiss, we\u2019re here to fix your box.\u201d The man in the hat says, attempting to play off a sexy side grin. </p><p>\u201cThis feels like the beginning of a bad porn\u2026\u201d You announce to the workers.</p><p>\u201cOr a good one, depending on how you look at it.\u201d The man with the mustache says, as he strokes the end of the cable wires he has looped over his shoulder. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m looking at it, and I have to be honest with you, I would not rent it. Lucky for me, it seems I won\u2019t have to, as I\u2019ve just learned my cable is broken.\u201d As you start to close your door, a small voice speaks into your ear.</p><p>\u201cWould you let them in already.\u201d The sound of Tony\u2019s voice bellows through your head, with a hint of urgency.</p><p>Scoffing, you roll your eyes, opening the door for the \u201cCablemen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought you could use some help.\u201d You can hear his smug tone from within.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you send Sam and Clint then?\u201d Your eyes follow them as they set down the wires, and cables on the table, and begin to make themselves at home, grabbing drinks, and laying down on the bed. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I thought you could use some company.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA bottle of wine would have been great company.\u201d You mumble back.</p><p>\u201cOnly one bed, huh? Nice.\u201d Sam nods his head, shifting his eyebrows up and down. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to blow my cover.\u201d You kick Sam off the bed and watch as they begin to set up a small receiver, running cables all along the wall between your room and the official\u2019s room next door.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s blowing anything.\u201d Clint speaks quietly as he secures the receiver in place. </p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s blowing\u2026.What kind of porno is this?\u201d Sam throws his hands up, speaking to the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing anyway? I\u2019ve already set up the mics and computer. I\u2019ve been recording for hours. He hasn\u2019t said anything useful yet. He does, however, have a meeting at 8pm with a guest that has yet to be named.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to snake this through the vent to his room for a live camera feed.\u201d Clint says as he pulls a chair over to a small vent located near your bathroom door. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026actually helpful.\u201d You tip your head in approval, standing next to him to hold the wires, turning to Sam as he attempts to log into your computer.</p><p>\u201cUsername?\u201d He asks while adjusting your screen. </p><p>\u201cBestAvenger.\u201d You respond as you help Clint with the wire. </p><p>\u201cPassword?\u201d He asks while typing in your username, shaking his head, mumbling about lies and such.</p><p>\u201cFalconistweetybirdsbitch1. All caps.\u201d</p><p>Clint stops, closing his eyes tight, and dropping his head, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not typing that.\u201d He folds his arms, glaring up at you.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019re not getting your live feed then.\u201d Clint looks at you, clearly amused at your chosen password, while also giving you the slight look of annoyance, knowing you knew damn well you guys needed this intel. </p><p>\u201cWould you go help him\u2026and also fix your robe, I can see everything from up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop looking at my boobs, Clint,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings one would never say in a porno\u2026\u201d Sam sits back and waits for your help, pointing to your computer with an expected look.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d You grab onto the laptop, sliding it to you.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really your password is it?\u201d Sam chuckles a bit, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was just kidding.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood. I was gonna \u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s RecycleRedwing18.\u201d \u00a0You type in the real password, but all he hears in the log in sound, and he glares in disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou come up with that all by yourself?\u201d He asks, throwing you a snarky glare.</p><p>\u201cNo, Bucky did.\u201d He squints harder at you, and you pretend not to see it. \u201cI wanted it to be Only1birdHawk4life, but he had already taken it.\u201d You didn\u2019t have to look to know that Clint was trying to hold in his laughter from across the room. </p><p>\u201cJerks.\u201d Sam walks over to help Clint finish connecting all the wires to the laptop, muttering under his breath about how he hates when you hang out with Bucky, and you can just barely make out the phrase \u201cI\u2019d like to recycle his old ass. I\u2019m gonna change my password to Scrapmetalsoldier101, or\u2026 Winterwasteofspace17. I\u2019ll show them.\u201d</p><p>Clint just holds his fist out for a quick bump to show he has Sam\u2019s back, and then continues to work.</p><p>Fifteen minutes, ten curse words, and five Bucky bashing passwords later, you finally get a picture and sound of the official in question next door.</p><p>\u201cThere we go. Hey, I know that guy! Steve and I ran into him a few months back. He\u2019s definitely Hydra. He was running a base in Sokovia, but then transferred out to Germany. \u00a0He\u2019s bad stuff.\u201d You snap a picture with your phone, and send the message off Steve\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cThey have weapons, Y/N.\u201d Clint points to the monitors, and holds an earphone to his head. \u201cLooks like they\u2019re trying to move them, selling them to the biggest player.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s take some pics of what we can, and record audio, I\u2019ll send it all to\u2026\u201d \u00a0A sudden knock on the door makes you all jump to action, all pulling weapons and surrounding the door. You carefully approach, a knife behind your back. \u201cTony, who else did you send?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. Just the birds. What\u2019s happening?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot sure, stand by.\u201d You slowly lean into the peephole once again, and breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Clint whispers from next to you.</p><p>You swing open the door, and smirk at the handsome man in front of you. Cleanly shaven, black slacks, crisp white shirt and tie, and wearing a small apron around his waist. \u00a0\u201cNow this right here, is what a good porn entrance looks like boys.\u201d </p><p>Holding on to a cart covered in a silky white tablecloth, multiple serving dishes with lids, and a small orchid, he rolls gently through the door.</p><p>\u201cYou ordered room service?\u201d He asks smoothly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, but if your fine ass is delivering, I\u2019ll happily take it. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she said.\u201d Sam chuckles out to you all. </p><p>\u201cYes, I know that\u2019s what she said , as I, she, just said it.\u201d </p><p>He mumbles something unrecognizable into the computer. </p><p>\u201dWhat\u2019s on the menu this evening?\u201d \u00a0You smile at the sight before you. Bucky looked good in dress clothes, not to mention his hair slicked back into a low bun.</p><p>\u201cTonight, the hotel is serving some of Shield\u2019s finest.\u201d He lifts the covers of each dish to reveal, guns, knives, comms, and radios. \u00a0You start unloading them onto the bed, taking stock, each claiming a weapon or device for your own.</p><p>\u201cWell, this all looks fantastic, but I just have one question.\u201d You ask, placing the covers back on carefully. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Buck?\u201d You walk away from the cart, and take your seat in front of the computer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad. I was against it. I told Steve you would be fine, but\u2026</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d You question.</p><p>\u201cBuuut, once Steve found out that Tony had sent these two asshats over, he figured you could use some actual help.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any help.\u201d You sigh in complete and utter annoyance.</p><p>\u201cI know, I told him that too, but you know how he gets.\u201d You watch as he looks around the room. \u201cThere\u2019s only one bed in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does everyone keep asking that? Yes, there is only one bed, as there was only supposed to be ONE person here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t plan on staying. I have a room on the next floor down.\u201d Bucky stops, \u00a0eyes wide as he sees your mouth drop, ready to scream at him.</p><p>\u201cBefore you start\u2026. I did it because I wanted to be close, just in case. I had no intentions of ever getting involved in this until Steve texted me the pic you sent him. That guy is bad news, and there was no fucking way you were taking him down without back-up\u2026if needed.\u201d He put his hands out, trying to subdue your inner anger.</p><p>\u201cHow am I going to get you guys all out of here without looking suspicious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave in a few minutes, after I check out the feed, and go change. I can reroute it to my phone, so I can watch from anywhere in the hotel. I don\u2019t know about those two though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone see you come in here?\u201d You ask, already knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, my first day of preschool?\u201d Bucky shoots back.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well I have to get you guys out, because it actually is starting to look like I\u2019m entertaining a few gentleman callers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially with the robe, what\u2019s going on there?\u201d Bucky swirls his finger in your direction.</p><p>\u201cUghhh, I was about to get in the shower when those two came to \u2018fix my box,\u2019 as they so eloquently put it. Don\u2019t smirk at that, it\u2019s not funny.\u201d Placing your hand on your hips, you can\u2019t even believe that Bucky has fallen into the trap of stupidity.</p><p>\u201cEhhh, it\u2019s a little funny.\u201d He says, nodding to the boys in the corner in approval. \u201cI mean, two guys in work shirts, and a fake mustache? It kind of does scream seventies love den.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, with your room service crap and all? It wasn\u2019t any better than our idea.\u201d Sam pipes up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Of course it\u2019s better! It\u2019s highly likely I\u2019m going to order room service. He can deliver!\u201d You spout back to Sam.</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t think I can deliver?\u201d Sam gets up, becoming a bit too cocky for his own good.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026deliver? No. Mail\u2026maybe, a pizza\u2026yes\u2026but that package right there\u2026\u201d You say pointing to Bucky. \u201cIts takes a different kind of man to drive that package home.\u201d</p><p>Bucky winks your way, as you nod back and smirk. You two were best friends, and you would never cross that line, but you both personally got off on driving Sam crazy at any and all costs.</p><p>\u201cOh, I can drive it home, girl. Don\u2019t you worry. This package is ready for delivery all year long.\u201d Sam approaches you, mock flirting, and teasing.</p><p>\u201cWhat is happening over there, and why am I listening to Sam talk about his package?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSteve, nice of you to join us.\u201d The deep sound of Steve\u2019s voice travels through your head. \u201cAlso, it\u2019s better you don\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy that. How are you doing? Any word on their plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeapons and tech. Big supply too, Steve.\u201d Bucky starts to get a count while he watches the monitor.</p><p>\u201cKeep me updated. What\u2019s everyone\u2019s plan?\u201d Steve questions into everyone\u2019s comms.</p><p>\u201cBucky is leaving in a few, Sam and Clint are heading out within the hour. \u00a0They\u2019ve been here for a bit, and I don\u2019t want it to look weird. So far, anyone who is willing to watch, has seen three men enter my room, and no one has left yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet them out soon. I don\u2019t want to miss this chance. This guy is a heavy hitter. Shield wants him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy that, Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky, stay close. Clint, Sam, where is your safe house, so to speak?\u201d Steve makes a mental note of everyone\u2019s plan. </p><p>\u201cTony got us a room three floors up, employee floooor.\u201d Clint voice drops out, realizing that he had now just blown his cover with you, and that you know knew that damn near everybody was here \u201chelping\u201d you out with what was supposed to be a single person recon order.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d You yell, causing everyone to throw a hand to their ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve reached Stark Industries. New York\u2019s personal savior is out saving the world at this time, please leave\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a piece of\u2026\u201d</p><p>You swear, a fraction of a second hadn\u2019t even passed before you felt Bucky grab you from behind, spinning you, placing his full body in front of you like a solid brick wall, metal arm gripped tightly on a gun pointing towards the door. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fu\u2026\u201d \u00a0Your shoulders jump as the lightest of knocks can be heard. </p><p>Bucky looks at the three of you, as Sam and you shake your head with confusion.</p><p>Clint steps off the bed and starts to head towards the door.</p><p>\u201cGeez, freak out much? I ordered Pizza, relax. So damn jumpy all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClint, why would you order pizza? I just \u201cordered\u201d room service!\u201d You quietly scream at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but your \u2018room service\u2019 isn\u2019t going to feed four of us, and it\u2019s getting late, and I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Bucky steps behind the door, waving the other two out of sight. After a quick nod your way, you ask who it is, and the reply is what you were waiting for.</p><p>\u201cPizza delivery ma\u2019am.\u201d The timid voice says. </p><p>\u201cYou have got to be kidding me right now.\u201d You know that voice like your own.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, another actor perhaps?\u201d Sam grins as he taps his fingers together in anticipation while you open the door. \u201cYeah, baby..Bow chicka wow wo\u2026NO! No, I am not going to prison!\u201d</p><p>You emit a high pitched hum as you see who is standing in front of you. Grabbing him by the collar and hood, you pull him in the room as fast as you can without hurting him.</p><p>He stares at you all, ready to burst with a full spectrum of emotions. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Parker?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, what are you guys doing here? Tony told me this was my first single mission!\u201d He yells in a loud whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou and me both kid.\u201d You say, somewhat gently slamming the door.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to be here. Things look pretty covered.\u201d Peter says \u00a0looking around the room, giving a quick nod and salute to Bucky behind the door. \u201cMr. Winter\u2026Barnes, Bucky, sir. Hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Bucky, I\u2019ve told you that. What are you doing here?\u201d Bucky drops his weapon, and approaches his calmly.</p><p>\u201cI sent him.\u201d Tony speaks through. I was tired of listening to all the gross innuendos, so I sent in Parker so you would all behave.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony! Are you serious right now, what if he gets hurt?\u201d Steve yells over the comms.</p><p>\u201cRelax, spangles, he\u2019s going to leave in a minute, right Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d He says holding his hand to his ear.</p><p>\u201cNo Tony, \u00a0he\u2019s not leaving. It\u2019s not safe now. \u00a0Fuck! Sorry, Frick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Y/N.\u201d He says sitting on the bed, unsure as to what to do in this tense situation.</p><p>\u201cBucky, you have to go. Wait down the hallway, and I\u2019ll send Peter out. He stays with you until we leave tonight. Peter, you meet Bucky in two, and I want a confirmation of meetup as soon as you reach him in the hallway. Got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan Y/N? Bucky asks waiting for further instructions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d You head into the bedroom and change into your bathing suit. \u201cI\u2019m going to get out of here for a bit. Give the \u2018repairman\u2019 time to work. I\u2019ll come back in thirty minutes, which is when you two will head back to your room, and we can end this shit show of a mission. Everyone clear on what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>A collection of six voices confirm a yes. </p><p>\u201cGood. Bucky, you\u2019re up.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGive me five kid. Southwest corner.\u201d \u00a0Bucky rolls his cart out of the room,a nd heads down towards the service elevators. Placing your hands on Peter\u2019s arms, you explain his next moves. </p><p>\u201cRight to him, ya got it? Don\u2019t talk to anyone, do not engage with anyone. Do you understand me?\u201d \u00a0Giving him a stern look, you nod towards to the door.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d You open the door for Peter, and he heads left.</p><p>Waiting a few minutes in between their departures, you stop to roll your eyes at how absolutely ridiculous this whole scene is. You head to the bedroom once again, throwing a cover up on, before exiting the room.</p><p> \u201cBucky\u2026status?\u201d You question into your comm.</p><p>\u201cThe spider is in the web.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Okay, boys, I\u2019ll be back in thirty. If anything happens before then, you know what to do.\u201d \u00a0You leave the room, casually turning back to make somewhat of a \u201cscene\u201d in case anyone happened to be wandering by. \u201cIt\u2019s really no rush. I\u2019m on vacation, take your time. I\u2019ll be by the pool relaxing. Thank you again!\u201d </p><p>Sam gives you the finger as you flash him your biggest feux grin.</p><p>You check your comm device as you head down the hallway and into the elevator. Rubbing the stress from your forehead, you make your way from the building, venturing towards the beautiful pool, surrounded by trees, and cabanas. Just five minutes to think is all I need, you repeat to yourself, over and over again. Walking along the edge of the pool, you find a small hut like cabana to settle into. You lay the chair back a few inches, basking in the soft glow of the sun, the smell of coconuts drifting upwards towards you, calming you almost instantly. A young handsome waiter comes to take your drink order, and you ask for a simple sparkling water, not wanting anything to take you off your game should a fight happen. A small glass bottle is placed next to the book that you had brought down to \u201cread.\u201d Inside of the cover was nothing more than a dug out hole, that housed a small camera. One of the many items that Bucky had brought to the room. After downing half of your water, you pick up your book, and begin to dive into the storyline. You watched as the two main characters in your book spoke about \u00a0weapons for sale, targets they have killed, and soldiers of note that had expertise that could vouch for them. You reach over to take another sip of your water, the heat beginning to make you sweat a bit.</p><p>\u201cGo away, I\u2019m undercover.\u201d Pulling up your legs, you rest the book on top of your knees, and never look up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to help, just watch.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI swear when I get back, Tony is a\u2026\u201d You mumble under your breath, trying best as you can not to move your lips.</p><p>\u201cI sent her. It\u2019s not for you, it\u2019s for Bucky.\u201d Steve sounds serious this time. \u201cI did some more research on that agent after the last mission. It turns out, he played a big part in Pierce\u2019s game. He was with Bucky when he was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more. Does Bucky know?\u201d \u00a0Praying the answer was no, you take another sip of water, placing your head back down on the chair.</p><p>\u201cNo, and I would like to keep it that way.\u201d Steve states firmly.</p><p>\u201cAnother secret placed in my vault. Check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N? \u00a0Uhhh, we may or may not have a situation up here.\u201d You can hear the slight panic in Clint\u2019s voice, and you know something is wrong. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Clint?\u201d Looking over at Wanda who is in a cover up with a baseball cap, you motion for her to get out of the area, and go back to her stationed post.</p><p>\u201cUmm, we have Bucky here, and he\u2019s pretty upset. You may want to get up here sooner than later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026he knows.\u201d The tone of Steve\u2019s voice told you all you needed to know. Taking two steps up the stairs at a time, you run as casually as you can making sure no one heard you booking down the hall.</p><p>The small circle on the keypad turns green, giving you access to enter your temporary room.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell happened?\u201d \u00a0Your eyes pop as your jaw widens at the sight in front of you.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t stop hitting me!\u201d Clint tries to speak every word but all you can hear are mumbles and slurs as Bucky presses his hand into his face, trying to push any part of Clint\u2019s body that he has access to. </p><p>\u201cYeah, now you know how it feels! It hurts when you get bit doesn\u2019t it!\u201d \u00a0Sam presses all of his weight onto Bucky\u2019s metal arm while straddling his chest. Bucky tosses the two of them around like two toddlers on a bucking bronco, while you just stare in shock. </p><p>\u201cA little help here would be nice! OW! NO! Bad Bucky!\u201d You run to the three of them as Sam starts to discipline Bucky by placing sharp slaps to his forehead. \u201cPinch me one more time, I swear!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI left you guys for twenty minutes!\u201d Jumping onto Bucky\u2019s legs he tries to buckle hard underneath you in an attempt to flip you all off. \u00a0He manages to flip Sam off finally, leaving Clint and you alone to tame the beast. Clint gets tossed after one metal punch to his ribs, and just like that, it\u2019s you alone for the ride. You feel him start to grab your leg and twist, and you think fast, knowing you can\u2019t take him alone. </p><p><i>I am so sick of this shit. I\u2019m ending this now.</i></p><p>Flipping your body in ways unimaginable, you manage to lock his head between your legs. You see him turn his head, as if he was really considering his next move carefully. Your expression turns to shock as he opens his mouth, teeth bared. </p><p><i>Is this mother about to bite me? Oh Hell no\u2026</i></p><p>Twisting your legs, you tighten your grip around his neck, and jerk hard while grabbing a handful of his most prized position. You open your mouth and slam your head down towards his lap. Just as you are about to bite he recoils, his eyes flashing a hint of fear and pain.</p><p>\u201cSTOP!\u201d He wails as you tighten your grip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop when you stop! \u00a0Don\u2019t fuck with me Barnes! I can play the biting game too, only I play to win.\u201d You can hear his neck crack as you twist your knees.</p><p>Putting his hand up in defense, he drops his head to the floor, panting, relief washing over his features.</p><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d Asking as you maintain your grip. </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He breathes out.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Raising your eyebrows, you stare menacingly his way, threatening him, and he knew it was true.</p><p>\u201cPlease let go.\u201d He begs</p><p>\u201cSay your sorry.\u201d \u00a0You demand</p><p>Clint and Sam sit on the floor next to you, panting, rubbing various parts of their body that Bucky had assaulted.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He mumbles out quietly, but you know he doesn\u2019t mean it.</p><p>\u201cBucky\u2026like you mean it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, because <i>I don\u2019t</i> mean\u2026 Ow Ow OWWW! Okay, \u00a0I\u2019m sorry\u2026 shit!\u201d </p><p>\u201cSay it to them! You probably broke Clint\u2019s ribs, and you bit Sam. You bit someone, dude. I mean, what the fu\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bit someone?\u201d A deep voice sounds out.</p><p>\u201cNot now Steve!\u201d All four of you shout into your comms.</p><p>\u201cAlright, take it easy.\u201d You can hear Steve\u2019s annoyed tone, and it\u2019s not helping.</p><p>Rolling off of Bucky, you fall onto your back, but not before giving him a not so gentle kick to the side of his calf.</p><p>\u201cI hate you sometimes.\u201d You speak into the air, panting on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI hate me too.\u201d Bucky replies back, just as out of breath as the rest of you. </p><p>\u201cI second that\u2026or third that? \u00a0I hate myself sometimes.\u201d Clint mumbles while massaging his side.</p><p>\u201cI hate all of you too, so can you please just shut up?\u201d Sam throws a kick to Bucky\u2019s other leg.</p><p>Finally being able to catch your breath, sitting up, looking at the other three hot messes in front of you, you stop and question what had started this whole act of idiocracy to begin with. </p><p>\u201cSomeone want to tell me what happened?\u201d </p><p>Clint and Sam both point in Bucky\u2019s direction. \u201cHe started it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did.\u201d<br></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVoRn0Y6fH_fqa5qDidsWSQ\">@schilj79</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a>\u00a0@fuckmeupsebastian <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnTFn521ZEBJro32JhPBZGw\">@awkward-sydney</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a>\u00a0@samstuffworld @10robins \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp757tS4u6WsQaOYvTJ33bQ\">@lordemjay</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLKe0ai32q0pHD9A1g2R2g\">@lovemarvelousfics</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfzvEX9P8FUtHkeUq7TMR5Q\">@elishamcloughlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m08K--JEIOUffGaqd6YUOCw\">@quotemeow</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb4rvr_8QAxikDvWTjb7nQA\">@alycu1</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\">@redqueen1221</a></p><p>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a></p></p>",

No one knew you were here at this particular hotel, and you hadn&rsquo;t requested any backup. Tony had asked you to head downtown, checked you into a swanky hotel, wanting you to keep a close eye on a newly appointed government official. One that may or may not have been dipping a toe or two into Hydra&rsquo;s &nbsp;pool of scum. &nbsp;It was a walk in the park assignment, and you didn&rsquo;t need the help, as it was a simple watch and see what happens type of task. &nbsp;Making sure you were decent, tying an extra loop in your belt, you call through to your unannounced visitors.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Your voice a bit higher than normal, faking a sweet innocence. </p><p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, we&rsquo;re from hotel maintenance. We have an order request. Did you call regarding your tv service?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My tv service? What?&rdquo; Mumbling to yourself in confusion, you look through the door to see two slightly familiar faces, one of them pressing his eye closer to the peephole, giving himself a distorted fisheye look. </p><p>Opening the door, you stare, completely unamused at the two men in front of. One wearing a fake mustache, the other under a hat. Both wearing blue and white pinstripe hotel maintenance shirts with matching name tags. </p><p>&ldquo;Miss, we&rsquo;re here to fix your box.&rdquo; The man in the hat says, attempting to play off a sexy side grin. </p><p>&ldquo;This feels like the beginning of a bad porn&hellip;&rdquo; You announce to the workers.</p><p>&ldquo;Or a good one, depending on how you look at it.&rdquo; The man with the mustache says, as he strokes the end of the cable wires he has looped over his shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m looking at it, and I have to be honest with you, I would not rent it. Lucky for me, it seems I won&rsquo;t have to, as I&rsquo;ve just learned my cable is broken.&rdquo; As you start to close your door, a small voice speaks into your ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you let them in already.&rdquo; The sound of Tony&rsquo;s voice bellows through your head, with a hint of urgency.</p><p>Scoffing, you roll your eyes, opening the door for the &ldquo;Cablemen.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tony&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I thought you could use some help.&rdquo; You can hear his smug tone from within.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you send Sam and Clint then?&rdquo; Your eyes follow them as they set down the wires, and cables on the table, and begin to make themselves at home, grabbing drinks, and laying down on the bed. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip; I thought you could use some company.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;A bottle of wine would have been great company.&rdquo; You mumble back.</p><p>&ldquo;Only one bed, huh? Nice.&rdquo; Sam nods his head, shifting his eyebrows up and down. </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to blow my cover.&rdquo; You kick Sam off the bed and watch as they begin to set up a small receiver, running cables all along the wall between your room and the official&rsquo;s room next door.</p><p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s blowing anything.&rdquo; Clint speaks quietly as he secures the receiver in place. </p><p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s blowing&hellip;.What kind of porno is this?&rdquo; Sam throws his hands up, speaking to the room.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you guys doing anyway? I&rsquo;ve already set up the mics and computer. I&rsquo;ve been recording for hours. He hasn&rsquo;t said anything useful yet. He does, however, have a meeting at 8pm with a guest that has yet to be named.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to snake this through the vent to his room for a live camera feed.&rdquo; Clint says as he pulls a chair over to a small vent located near your bathroom door. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;actually helpful.&rdquo; You tip your head in approval, standing next to him to hold the wires, turning to Sam as he attempts to log into your computer.</p><p>&ldquo;Username?&rdquo; He asks while adjusting your screen. </p><p>&ldquo;BestAvenger.&rdquo; You respond as you help Clint with the wire. </p><p>&ldquo;Password?&rdquo; He asks while typing in your username, shaking his head, mumbling about lies and such.</p><p>&ldquo;Falconistweetybirdsbitch1. All caps.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint stops, closing his eyes tight, and dropping his head, trying not to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not typing that.&rdquo; He folds his arms, glaring up at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;re not getting your live feed then.&rdquo; Clint looks at you, clearly amused at your chosen password, while also giving you the slight look of annoyance, knowing you knew damn well you guys needed this intel. </p><p>&ldquo;Would you go help him&hellip;and also fix your robe, I can see everything from up here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop looking at my boobs, Clint,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Things one would never say in a porno&hellip;&rdquo; Sam sits back and waits for your help, pointing to your computer with an expected look.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; You grab onto the laptop, sliding it to you.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not really your password is it?&rdquo; Sam chuckles a bit, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I was just kidding.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Good. I was gonna &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s RecycleRedwing18.&rdquo; &nbsp;You type in the real password, but all he hears in the log in sound, and he glares in disgust.</p><p>&ldquo;You come up with that all by yourself?&rdquo; He asks, throwing you a snarky glare.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Bucky did.&rdquo; He squints harder at you, and you pretend not to see it. &ldquo;I wanted it to be Only1birdHawk4life, but he had already taken it.&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t have to look to know that Clint was trying to hold in his laughter from across the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Jerks.&rdquo; Sam walks over to help Clint finish connecting all the wires to the laptop, muttering under his breath about how he hates when you hang out with Bucky, and you can just barely make out the phrase &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to recycle his old ass. I&rsquo;m gonna change my password to Scrapmetalsoldier101, or&hellip; Winterwasteofspace17. I&rsquo;ll show them.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint just holds his fist out for a quick bump to show he has Sam&rsquo;s back, and then continues to work.</p><p>Fifteen minutes, ten curse words, and five Bucky bashing passwords later, you finally get a picture and sound of the official in question next door.</p><p>&ldquo;There we go. Hey, I know that guy! Steve and I ran into him a few months back. He&rsquo;s definitely Hydra. He was running a base in Sokovia, but then transferred out to Germany. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s bad stuff.&rdquo; You snap a picture with your phone, and send the message off Steve&rsquo;s way.</p><p>&ldquo;They have weapons, Y/N.&rdquo; Clint points to the monitors, and holds an earphone to his head. &ldquo;Looks like they&rsquo;re trying to move them, selling them to the biggest player.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s take some pics of what we can, and record audio, I&rsquo;ll send it all to&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;A sudden knock on the door makes you all jump to action, all pulling weapons and surrounding the door. You carefully approach, a knife behind your back. &ldquo;Tony, who else did you send?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one. Just the birds. What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not sure, stand by.&rdquo; You slowly lean into the peephole once again, and breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Clint whispers from next to you.</p><p>You swing open the door, and smirk at the handsome man in front of you. Cleanly shaven, black slacks, crisp white shirt and tie, and wearing a small apron around his waist. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now this right here, is what a good porn entrance looks like boys.&rdquo; </p><p>Holding on to a cart covered in a silky white tablecloth, multiple serving dishes with lids, and a small orchid, he rolls gently through the door.</p><p>&ldquo;You ordered room service?&rdquo; He asks smoothly.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, but if your fine ass is delivering, I&rsquo;ll happily take it. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she said.&rdquo; Sam chuckles out to you all. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that&rsquo;s what she said , as I, she, just said it.&rdquo; </p><p>He mumbles something unrecognizable into the computer. </p><p>&rdquo;What&rsquo;s on the menu this evening?&rdquo; &nbsp;You smile at the sight before you. Bucky looked good in dress clothes, not to mention his hair slicked back into a low bun.</p><p>&ldquo;Tonight, the hotel is serving some of Shield&rsquo;s finest.&rdquo; He lifts the covers of each dish to reveal, guns, knives, comms, and radios. &nbsp;You start unloading them onto the bed, taking stock, each claiming a weapon or device for your own.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, this all looks fantastic, but I just have one question.&rdquo; You ask, placing the covers back on carefully. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; He asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you here, Buck?&rdquo; You walk away from the cart, and take your seat in front of the computer.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mad. I was against it. I told Steve you would be fine, but&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;But?&rdquo; You question.</p><p>&ldquo;Buuut, once Steve found out that Tony had sent these two asshats over, he figured you could use some actual help.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any help.&rdquo; You sigh in complete and utter annoyance.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I told him that too, but you know how he gets.&rdquo; You watch as he looks around the room. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one bed in here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why does everyone keep asking that? Yes, there is only one bed, as there was only supposed to be ONE person here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t plan on staying. I have a room on the next floor down.&rdquo; Bucky stops, &nbsp;eyes wide as he sees your mouth drop, ready to scream at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Before you start&hellip;. I did it because I wanted to be close, just in case. I had no intentions of ever getting involved in this until Steve texted me the pic you sent him. That guy is bad news, and there was no fucking way you were taking him down without back-up&hellip;if needed.&rdquo; He put his hands out, trying to subdue your inner anger.</p><p>&ldquo;How am I going to get you guys all out of here without looking suspicious?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave in a few minutes, after I check out the feed, and go change. I can reroute it to my phone, so I can watch from anywhere in the hotel. I don&rsquo;t know about those two though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did anyone see you come in here?&rdquo; You ask, already knowing the answer.</p><p>&ldquo;What is this, my first day of preschool?&rdquo; Bucky shoots back.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, well I have to get you guys out, because it actually is starting to look like I&rsquo;m entertaining a few gentleman callers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Especially with the robe, what&rsquo;s going on there?&rdquo; Bucky swirls his finger in your direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Ughhh, I was about to get in the shower when those two came to &lsquo;fix my box,&rsquo; as they so eloquently put it. Don&rsquo;t smirk at that, it&rsquo;s not funny.&rdquo; Placing your hand on your hips, you can&rsquo;t even believe that Bucky has fallen into the trap of stupidity.</p><p>&ldquo;Ehhh, it&rsquo;s a little funny.&rdquo; He says, nodding to the boys in the corner in approval. &ldquo;I mean, two guys in work shirts, and a fake mustache? It kind of does scream seventies love den.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about you, with your room service crap and all? It wasn&rsquo;t any better than our idea.&rdquo; Sam pipes up from the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Of course it&rsquo;s better! It&rsquo;s highly likely I&rsquo;m going to order room service. He can deliver!&rdquo; You spout back to Sam.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t think I can deliver?&rdquo; Sam gets up, becoming a bit too cocky for his own good.</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip;deliver? No. Mail&hellip;maybe, a pizza&hellip;yes&hellip;but that package right there&hellip;&rdquo; You say pointing to Bucky. &ldquo;Its takes a different kind of man to drive that package home.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky winks your way, as you nod back and smirk. You two were best friends, and you would never cross that line, but you both personally got off on driving Sam crazy at any and all costs.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I can drive it home, girl. Don&rsquo;t you worry. This package is ready for delivery all year long.&rdquo; Sam approaches you, mock flirting, and teasing.</p><p>&ldquo;What is happening over there, and why am I listening to Sam talk about his package?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Steve, nice of you to join us.&rdquo; The deep sound of Steve&rsquo;s voice travels through your head. &ldquo;Also, it&rsquo;s better you don&rsquo;t ask.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Copy that. How are you doing? Any word on their plan?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Weapons and tech. Big supply too, Steve.&rdquo; Bucky starts to get a count while he watches the monitor.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep me updated. What&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s plan?&rdquo; Steve questions into everyone&rsquo;s comms.</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky is leaving in a few, Sam and Clint are heading out within the hour. &nbsp;They&rsquo;ve been here for a bit, and I don&rsquo;t want it to look weird. So far, anyone who is willing to watch, has seen three men enter my room, and no one has left yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get them out soon. I don&rsquo;t want to miss this chance. This guy is a heavy hitter. Shield wants him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Copy that, Rogers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky, stay close. Clint, Sam, where is your safe house, so to speak?&rdquo; Steve makes a mental note of everyone&rsquo;s plan. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony got us a room three floors up, employee floooor.&rdquo; Clint voice drops out, realizing that he had now just blown his cover with you, and that you know knew that damn near everybody was here &ldquo;helping&rdquo; you out with what was supposed to be a single person recon order.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; You yell, causing everyone to throw a hand to their ear.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve reached Stark Industries. New York&rsquo;s personal savior is out saving the world at this time, please leave&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a piece of&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You swear, a fraction of a second hadn&rsquo;t even passed before you felt Bucky grab you from behind, spinning you, placing his full body in front of you like a solid brick wall, metal arm gripped tightly on a gun pointing towards the door. </p><p>&ldquo;What the fu&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;Your shoulders jump as the lightest of knocks can be heard. </p><p>Bucky looks at the three of you, as Sam and you shake your head with confusion.</p><p>Clint steps off the bed and starts to head towards the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Geez, freak out much? I ordered Pizza, relax. So damn jumpy all the time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Clint, why would you order pizza? I just &ldquo;ordered&rdquo; room service!&rdquo; You quietly scream at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but your &lsquo;room service&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t going to feed four of us, and it&rsquo;s getting late, and I&rsquo;m starving.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky steps behind the door, waving the other two out of sight. After a quick nod your way, you ask who it is, and the reply is what you were waiting for.</p><p>&ldquo;Pizza delivery ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; The timid voice says. </p><p>&ldquo;You have got to be kidding me right now.&rdquo; You know that voice like your own.</p><p>&ldquo;Ooooh, another actor perhaps?&rdquo; Sam grins as he taps his fingers together in anticipation while you open the door. &ldquo;Yeah, baby..Bow chicka wow wo&hellip;NO! No, I am not going to prison!&rdquo;</p><p>You emit a high pitched hum as you see who is standing in front of you. Grabbing him by the collar and hood, you pull him in the room as fast as you can without hurting him.</p><p>He stares at you all, ready to burst with a full spectrum of emotions. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell, Parker?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what are you guys doing here? Tony told me this was my first single mission!&rdquo; He yells in a loud whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;You and me both kid.&rdquo; You say, somewhat gently slamming the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m supposed to be here. Things look pretty covered.&rdquo; Peter says &nbsp;looking around the room, giving a quick nod and salute to Bucky behind the door. &ldquo;Mr. Winter&hellip;Barnes, Bucky, sir. Hi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just Bucky, I&rsquo;ve told you that. What are you doing here?&rdquo; Bucky drops his weapon, and approaches his calmly.</p><p>&ldquo;I sent him.&rdquo; Tony speaks through. I was tired of listening to all the gross innuendos, so I sent in Parker so you would all behave.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tony! Are you serious right now, what if he gets hurt?&rdquo; Steve yells over the comms.</p><p>&ldquo;Relax, spangles, he&rsquo;s going to leave in a minute, right Parker?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir.&rdquo; He says holding his hand to his ear.</p><p>&ldquo;No Tony, &nbsp;he&rsquo;s not leaving. It&rsquo;s not safe now. &nbsp;Fuck! Sorry, Frick!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Y/N.&rdquo; He says sitting on the bed, unsure as to what to do in this tense situation.</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky, you have to go. Wait down the hallway, and I&rsquo;ll send Peter out. He stays with you until we leave tonight. Peter, you meet Bucky in two, and I want a confirmation of meetup as soon as you reach him in the hallway. Got it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your plan Y/N? Bucky asks waiting for further instructions.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving.&rdquo; You head into the bedroom and change into your bathing suit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get out of here for a bit. Give the &lsquo;repairman&rsquo; time to work. I&rsquo;ll come back in thirty minutes, which is when you two will head back to your room, and we can end this shit show of a mission. Everyone clear on what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;</p><p>A collection of six voices confirm a yes. </p><p>&ldquo;Good. Bucky, you&rsquo;re up.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Give me five kid. Southwest corner.&rdquo; &nbsp;Bucky rolls his cart out of the room,a nd heads down towards the service elevators. Placing your hands on Peter&rsquo;s arms, you explain his next moves. </p><p>&ldquo;Right to him, ya got it? Don&rsquo;t talk to anyone, do not engage with anyone. Do you understand me?&rdquo; &nbsp;Giving him a stern look, you nod towards to the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo; You open the door for Peter, and he heads left.</p><p>Waiting a few minutes in between their departures, you stop to roll your eyes at how absolutely ridiculous this whole scene is. You head to the bedroom once again, throwing a cover up on, before exiting the room.</p><p> &ldquo;Bucky&hellip;status?&rdquo; You question into your comm.</p><p>&ldquo;The spider is in the web.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great. Okay, boys, I&rsquo;ll be back in thirty. If anything happens before then, you know what to do.&rdquo; &nbsp;You leave the room, casually turning back to make somewhat of a &ldquo;scene&rdquo; in case anyone happened to be wandering by. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really no rush. I&rsquo;m on vacation, take your time. I&rsquo;ll be by the pool relaxing. Thank you again!&rdquo; </p><p>Sam gives you the finger as you flash him your biggest feux grin.</p><p>You check your comm device as you head down the hallway and into the elevator. Rubbing the stress from your forehead, you make your way from the building, venturing towards the beautiful pool, surrounded by trees, and cabanas. Just five minutes to think is all I need, you repeat to yourself, over and over again. Walking along the edge of the pool, you find a small hut like cabana to settle into. You lay the chair back a few inches, basking in the soft glow of the sun, the smell of coconuts drifting upwards towards you, calming you almost instantly. A young handsome waiter comes to take your drink order, and you ask for a simple sparkling water, not wanting anything to take you off your game should a fight happen. A small glass bottle is placed next to the book that you had brought down to &ldquo;read.&rdquo; Inside of the cover was nothing more than a dug out hole, that housed a small camera. One of the many items that Bucky had brought to the room. After downing half of your water, you pick up your book, and begin to dive into the storyline. You watched as the two main characters in your book spoke about &nbsp;weapons for sale, targets they have killed, and soldiers of note that had expertise that could vouch for them. You reach over to take another sip of your water, the heat beginning to make you sweat a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Go away, I&rsquo;m undercover.&rdquo; Pulling up your legs, you rest the book on top of your knees, and never look up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to help, just watch.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I swear when I get back, Tony is a&hellip;&rdquo; You mumble under your breath, trying best as you can not to move your lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I sent her. It&rsquo;s not for you, it&rsquo;s for Bucky.&rdquo; Steve sounds serious this time. &ldquo;I did some more research on that agent after the last mission. It turns out, he played a big part in Pierce&rsquo;s game. He was with Bucky when he was&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say no more. Does Bucky know?&rdquo; &nbsp;Praying the answer was no, you take another sip of water, placing your head back down on the chair.</p><p>&ldquo;No, and I would like to keep it that way.&rdquo; Steve states firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;Another secret placed in my vault. Check.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N? &nbsp;Uhhh, we may or may not have a situation up here.&rdquo; You can hear the slight panic in Clint&rsquo;s voice, and you know something is wrong. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening, Clint?&rdquo; Looking over at Wanda who is in a cover up with a baseball cap, you motion for her to get out of the area, and go back to her stationed post.</p><p>&ldquo;Umm, we have Bucky here, and he&rsquo;s pretty upset. You may want to get up here sooner than later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;he knows.&rdquo; The tone of Steve&rsquo;s voice told you all you needed to know. Taking two steps up the stairs at a time, you run as casually as you can making sure no one heard you booking down the hall.</p><p>The small circle on the keypad turns green, giving you access to enter your temporary room.</p><p>&ldquo;What in the hell happened?&rdquo; &nbsp;Your eyes pop as your jaw widens at the sight in front of you.</p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t stop hitting me!&rdquo; Clint tries to speak every word but all you can hear are mumbles and slurs as Bucky presses his hand into his face, trying to push any part of Clint&rsquo;s body that he has access to. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, now you know how it feels! It hurts when you get bit doesn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; &nbsp;Sam presses all of his weight onto Bucky&rsquo;s metal arm while straddling his chest. Bucky tosses the two of them around like two toddlers on a bucking bronco, while you just stare in shock. </p><p>&ldquo;A little help here would be nice! OW! NO! Bad Bucky!&rdquo; You run to the three of them as Sam starts to discipline Bucky by placing sharp slaps to his forehead. &ldquo;Pinch me one more time, I swear!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I left you guys for twenty minutes!&rdquo; Jumping onto Bucky&rsquo;s legs he tries to buckle hard underneath you in an attempt to flip you all off. &nbsp;He manages to flip Sam off finally, leaving Clint and you alone to tame the beast. Clint gets tossed after one metal punch to his ribs, and just like that, it&rsquo;s you alone for the ride. You feel him start to grab your leg and twist, and you think fast, knowing you can&rsquo;t take him alone. </p><p><i>I am so sick of this shit. I&rsquo;m ending this now.</i></p><p>Flipping your body in ways unimaginable, you manage to lock his head between your legs. You see him turn his head, as if he was really considering his next move carefully. Your expression turns to shock as he opens his mouth, teeth bared. </p><p><i>Is this mother about to bite me? Oh Hell no&hellip;</i></p><p>Twisting your legs, you tighten your grip around his neck, and jerk hard while grabbing a handful of his most prized position. You open your mouth and slam your head down towards his lap. Just as you are about to bite he recoils, his eyes flashing a hint of fear and pain.</p><p>&ldquo;STOP!&rdquo; He wails as you tighten your grip.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stop when you stop! &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t fuck with me Barnes! I can play the biting game too, only I play to win.&rdquo; You can hear his neck crack as you twist your knees.</p><p>Putting his hand up in defense, he drops his head to the floor, panting, relief washing over his features.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you done?&rdquo; Asking as you maintain your grip. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He breathes out.</p><p>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; Raising your eyebrows, you stare menacingly his way, threatening him, and he knew it was true.</p><p>&ldquo;Please let go.&rdquo; He begs</p><p>&ldquo;Say your sorry.&rdquo; &nbsp;You demand</p><p>Clint and Sam sit on the floor next to you, panting, rubbing various parts of their body that Bucky had assaulted.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; He mumbles out quietly, but you know he doesn&rsquo;t mean it.</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky&hellip;like you mean it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, because <i>I don&rsquo;t</i> mean&hellip; Ow Ow OWWW! Okay, &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; shit!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Say it to them! You probably broke Clint&rsquo;s ribs, and you bit Sam. You bit someone, dude. I mean, what the fu&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You bit someone?&rdquo; A deep voice sounds out.</p><p>&ldquo;Not now Steve!&rdquo; All four of you shout into your comms.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, take it easy.&rdquo; You can hear Steve&rsquo;s annoyed tone, and it&rsquo;s not helping.</p><p>Rolling off of Bucky, you fall onto your back, but not before giving him a not so gentle kick to the side of his calf.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate you sometimes.&rdquo; You speak into the air, panting on the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate me too.&rdquo; Bucky replies back, just as out of breath as the rest of you. </p><p>&ldquo;I second that&hellip;or third that? &nbsp;I hate myself sometimes.&rdquo; Clint mumbles while massaging his side.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate all of you too, so can you please just shut up?&rdquo; Sam throws a kick to Bucky&rsquo;s other leg.</p><p>Finally being able to catch your breath, sitting up, looking at the other three hot messes in front of you, you stop and question what had started this whole act of idiocracy to begin with. </p><p>&ldquo;Someone want to tell me what happened?&rdquo; </p><p>Clint and Sam both point in Bucky&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;He started it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course he did.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVoRn0Y6fH_fqa5qDidsWSQ\">@schilj79</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a>&nbsp;@fuckmeupsebastian <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnTFn521ZEBJro32JhPBZGw\">@awkward-sydney</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a>&nbsp;@samstuffworld @10robins &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp757tS4u6WsQaOYvTJ33bQ\">@lordemjay</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLKe0ai32q0pHD9A1g2R2g\">@lovemarvelousfics</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfzvEX9P8FUtHkeUq7TMR5Q\">@elishamcloughlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m08K--JEIOUffGaqd6YUOCw\">@quotemeow</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb4rvr_8QAxikDvWTjb7nQA\">@alycu1</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrC5-3MwluGxPqdDXlCgNfw\">@redqueen1221</a></p><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a></p></p>",

No one knew you were here at this particular hotel, and you hadn&rsquo;t requested any backup. Tony had asked you to head downtown, checked you into a swanky hotel, wanting you to keep a close eye on a newly appointed government official. One that may or may not have been dipping a toe or two into Hydra&rsquo;s &nbsp;pool of scum. &nbsp;It was a walk in the park assignment, and you didn&rsquo;t need the help, as it was a simple watch and see what happens type of task. &nbsp;Making sure you were decent, tying an extra loop in your belt, you call through to your unannounced visitors.<b><br /></b></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Your voice a bit higher than normal, faking a sweet innocence. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, we&rsquo;re from hotel maintenance.

What?&rdquo; Mumbling to yourself in confusion, you look through the door to see two slightly familiar faces, one of them pressing his eye closer to the peephole, giving himself a distorted fisheye look. </p>\n<p>Opening the door, you stare, completely unamused at the two men in front of. One wearing a fake mustache, the other under a hat. Both wearing blue and white pinstripe hotel maintenance shirts with matching name tags. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Miss, we&rsquo;re here to fix your box.&rdquo; The man in the hat says, attempting to play off a sexy side grin. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;This feels like the beginning of a bad porn&hellip;&rdquo; You announce to the workers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Or a good one, depending on how you look at it.&rdquo; The man with the mustache says, as he strokes the end of the cable wires he has looped over his shoulder. </p>\n</p>",
