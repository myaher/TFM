Not to go back. Just to press pause at any given moment, and move\naround freely to do your own thing. You found out you could use your powers by\npure will. If you wanted to pause time, it would happen, and you could keep it\npaused for as long as you wanted. However, you never liked to keep it paused\nfor any more than 5 minutes, due to feeling lonely as the only thing moving.\nHowever, when the world became too loud, hitting pause for those few minutes\nwas refreshing. </p><p>Throughout your time using your powers, you\u2019d used them for\nboth good and bad. You didn\u2019t like doing bad with them, and preferred the\nlatter, but whatever good deed you did got punished it seemed. First you used\nyour powers to save a family member from being hit by a car, and that family\nmember snitched on you to the rest of the family, who forced you to admit and\nto show your powers, before the promptly abandoned you. That left you, a kid,\nhomeless, and setting a bad example of what to expect when people found out\nabout your powers. For a good few years you only used your powers for your own\nneeds. Like stealing food to survive without getting spotted, or even stealing\nmoney and sneaking into places. Pausing time just to sleep in a room you\u2019d\nsnuck into. It wasn\u2019t until heroes started popping up with powers, giving\npeople like you a better name that you decided to try and have a better look at\nyour own actions. </p><p>You first started with things that just crossed your path.\nMuggings, thieves, and just assholes. They usually left the victims alone when\nyou in turn stole their weapons and kicked their asses when they couldn\u2019t fight\nback. It was about this time that the victims of these crimes started to not\nfear you, and soon when you helped the shops, they gave you stuff for free, and\nspread the word of a new hero in town.</p><p>While a lot of the heroes were difficult to come across in\nperson, you were right there. People knew where to find you. They found you in\nthe middle of the city, with that guitar and that case, strumming and singing\nduring most of the day and into the afternoon, before looking for any trouble\nbetween working hours and later at night. Because of your new reputation, a lot\nof people offered more money. Their way of saying thank you for your little\ncontribution of helping someone they knew, or themselves. It got to the point\nwhere the neighbourhood had been trying to get you more attention so you could\nhave an official title. </p><p>This led to today\u2019s shenanigans. Spotting Tony Stark walking\n\u2018 in disguise\u2019 down the road, on the phone. You were on the opposite side of\nthe road, busy strumming a song, though you kept your eyes on him. Soon Tony\nput the phone down, and pulled off his glasses. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d He called,\ncatching everyone\u2019s attention, including you. \u201cEveryone needs to evacuate this\narea, there\u2019s a group coming this way that are bad news.\u201d He announced, and it\nwasn\u2019t long till people were taking off. However, you took your sweet time in\npacking up all the money given, not paying attention as Tony suited up. \u201cGet a\nmove on.\u201d Tony called at you. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about\u2026\u201d You turned, seeing someone sneaking up\non Tony with a gun. As he raised his gun to fire, Tony turned and you froze\ntime. You huffed, walking across the road, taking the gun off him, and throwing\nit down an alleyway. You decided that since you were here, you\u2019d do a quick\nsearch for any other bad guys. Searching the alleys you found two others, and\nyou even went to the top of one of the buildings to get a sniper. You threw his\ngun off the edge and carried him down. Because of the time being frozen or\nsomething of other, he felt weightless. It was probably something Tony himself\ncould explain, but you weren\u2019t bothered. You carried him down, rounded them up,\nbefore heading back to your spot, leaning against the wall and snapping your\nfingers.</p><p>You watched as the men were all groaning, some even throwing\nup due to the feeling of being moved from where they were not even a\nmillisecond ago, and Tony retracted his helmet, looking confused on what had\nhappened, looking over and seeing you watching. You have a small wave, before\nturning to walk off. \u201cWait!\u201d He called, flying over your head and stopping in\nfront of you. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d He asked. You shrugged, before you saw he\nwas looking behind you, and he raised his hand. You stopped time, looking back,\nseeing one of the man had a gun pointed at you both, and instead of thinking\nlogically, you raised your guitar and hit him with it, playing time again as he\nyelled in pain at the splinters and Tony took a shot to keep him down. \u201cYou\njust did it again. What is that?\u201d Stark insisted.</p><p>\u201cI have powers. I can stop time. It\u2019s nothing special.\u201d You\nshrugged, walking around him, this time not being followed. It wasn\u2019t till a\nblock later that you realised you\u2019d smashed your guitar, and you cursed, now\nthinking on how you were going to make money now outside of dealing with petty\ncrime. </p><p>A week later, you ended up back outside that building where\nit all happened. You had been planning to just walk down there for the cheap\nfood and drink at the caf\u00e9 down the road, until someone grabbed your shoulder.\nTime froze, you looked back, saw Tony, and started it again. \u201cWhat?\u201d You asked.\n</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cHave you been waiting for me to walk down this street all\nweek?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He asked again. You sighed. </p><p>\u201cY/N. My name is Y/N. Why do you want to know?\u201d You\nanswered, seeing a small smile on his face. </p><p>\u201cThought so\u2026 I want to hire you.\u201d He said. You crossed your\narms. </p><p>\u201cWhat does that entail, and what do I gain from it?\u201d You\nasked further. </p><p>\u201cA decent paycheck, fame, and if your reputation grows good,\nthen you\u2019ll be called in to become an Avenger like me.\u201d He explained. \u201cWhy,\nwhat else would you want? I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d He offered. </p><p>\u201cI want a place to stay.\u201d You answered, barely missing a\nbeat, seeing his features shift. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re homeless?\u201d He asked, shifting foot to foot. </p><p>\u201cYep. Have been since I was a teenager. All because of my\npowers. I want somewhere to stay at least until I can pay the rent myself.\u201d You\nexplained. Soon that smile returned. </p><p>\u201cAlright. I can arrange that. I\u2019ll also let you pick out a\nnew guitar since you smashed it to save me for the second time from being shot.\nCome on then.\u201d He motioned his head for you to follow, even offering his hand\nfor you. While you didn\u2019t take it, you did follow after him. Finally, maybe\nsomething good was coming from stopping time. </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

What is that?\u201d Stark insisted.</p><p>\u201cI have powers. I can stop time. It\u2019s nothing special.\u201d You\nshrugged, walking around him, this time not being followed. It wasn\u2019t till a\nblock later that you realised you\u2019d smashed your guitar, and you cursed, now\nthinking on how you were going to make money now outside of dealing with petty\ncrime. </p><p>A week later, you ended up back outside that building where\nit all happened. You had been planning to just walk down there for the cheap\nfood and drink at the caf\u00e9 down the road, until someone grabbed your shoulder.\nTime froze, you looked back, saw Tony, and started it again. \u201cWhat?\u201d You asked.\n</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cHave you been waiting for me to walk down this street all\nweek?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He asked again. You sighed. </p><p>\u201cY/N. My name is Y/N. Why do you want to know?\u201d You\nanswered, seeing a small smile on his face. </p><p>\u201cThought so\u2026 I want to hire you.\u201d He said. You crossed your\narms. </p><p>\u201cWhat does that entail, and what do I gain from it?\u201d You\nasked further. </p><p>\u201cA decent paycheck, fame, and if your reputation grows good,\nthen you\u2019ll be called in to become an Avenger like me.\u201d He explained. \u201cWhy,\nwhat else would you want? I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d He offered. </p><p>\u201cI want a place to stay.\u201d You answered, barely missing a\nbeat, seeing his features shift. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re homeless?\u201d He asked, shifting foot to foot. </p><p>\u201cYep. Have been since I was a teenager. All because of my\npowers. I want somewhere to stay at least until I can pay the rent myself.\u201d You\nexplained. Soon that smile returned. </p><p>\u201cAlright. I can arrange that. I\u2019ll also let you pick out a\nnew guitar since you smashed it to save me for the second time from being shot.\nCome on then.\u201d He motioned his head for you to follow, even offering his hand\nfor you. While you didn\u2019t take it, you did follow after him. Finally, maybe\nsomething good was coming from stopping time. </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

Sometimes you had moments of hatred for it, but then\nremembered your plan and pushed it back. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Your power was the ability to momentarily pause time. Not\nspeed it up. Not to go back. Just to press pause at any given moment, and move\naround freely to do your own thing. You found out you could use your powers by\npure will. If you wanted to pause time, it would happen, and you could keep it\npaused for as long as you wanted. However, you never liked to keep it paused\nfor any more than 5 minutes, due to feeling lonely as the only thing moving.\nHowever, when the world became too loud, hitting pause for those few minutes\nwas refreshing. </p><p>Throughout your time using your powers, you\u2019d used them for\nboth good and bad. You didn\u2019t like doing bad with them, and preferred the\nlatter, but whatever good deed you did got punished it seemed. First you used\nyour powers to save a family member from being hit by a car, and that family\nmember snitched on you to the rest of the family, who forced you to admit and\nto show your powers, before the promptly abandoned you. That left you, a kid,\nhomeless, and setting a bad example of what to expect when people found out\nabout your powers. For a good few years you only used your powers for your own\nneeds. Like stealing food to survive without getting spotted, or even stealing\nmoney and sneaking into places. Pausing time just to sleep in a room you\u2019d\nsnuck into. It wasn\u2019t until heroes started popping up with powers, giving\npeople like you a better name that you decided to try and have a better look at\nyour own actions. </p><p>You first started with things that just crossed your path.\nMuggings, thieves, and just assholes. They usually left the victims alone when\nyou in turn stole their weapons and kicked their asses when they couldn\u2019t fight\nback. It was about this time that the victims of these crimes started to not\nfear you, and soon when you helped the shops, they gave you stuff for free, and\nspread the word of a new hero in town.</p><p>While a lot of the heroes were difficult to come across in\nperson, you were right there. People knew where to find you. They found you in\nthe middle of the city, with that guitar and that case, strumming and singing\nduring most of the day and into the afternoon, before looking for any trouble\nbetween working hours and later at night. Because of your new reputation, a lot\nof people offered more money. Their way of saying thank you for your little\ncontribution of helping someone they knew, or themselves. It got to the point\nwhere the neighbourhood had been trying to get you more attention so you could\nhave an official title. </p><p>This led to today\u2019s shenanigans. Spotting Tony Stark walking\n\u2018 in disguise\u2019 down the road, on the phone. You were on the opposite side of\nthe road, busy strumming a song, though you kept your eyes on him. Soon Tony\nput the phone down, and pulled off his glasses. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d He called,\ncatching everyone\u2019s attention, including you. \u201cEveryone needs to evacuate this\narea, there\u2019s a group coming this way that are bad news.\u201d He announced, and it\nwasn\u2019t long till people were taking off. However, you took your sweet time in\npacking up all the money given, not paying attention as Tony suited up. \u201cGet a\nmove on.\u201d Tony called at you. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about\u2026\u201d You turned, seeing someone sneaking up\non Tony with a gun. As he raised his gun to fire, Tony turned and you froze\ntime. You huffed, walking across the road, taking the gun off him, and throwing\nit down an alleyway. You decided that since you were here, you\u2019d do a quick\nsearch for any other bad guys. Searching the alleys you found two others, and\nyou even went to the top of one of the buildings to get a sniper. You threw his\ngun off the edge and carried him down. Because of the time being frozen or\nsomething of other, he felt weightless. It was probably something Tony himself\ncould explain, but you weren\u2019t bothered. You carried him down, rounded them up,\nbefore heading back to your spot, leaning against the wall and snapping your\nfingers.</p><p>You watched as the men were all groaning, some even throwing\nup due to the feeling of being moved from where they were not even a\nmillisecond ago, and Tony retracted his helmet, looking confused on what had\nhappened, looking over and seeing you watching. You have a small wave, before\nturning to walk off. \u201cWait!\u201d He called, flying over your head and stopping in\nfront of you. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d He asked. You shrugged, before you saw he\nwas looking behind you, and he raised his hand.

You had been planning to just walk down there for the cheap\nfood and drink at the caf&eacute; down the road, until someone grabbed your shoulder.\nTime froze, you looked back, saw Tony, and started it again. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; You asked.\n</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; He asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you been waiting for me to walk down this street all\nweek?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; He asked again. You sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N. My name is Y/N. Why do you want to know?&rdquo; You\nanswered, seeing a small smile on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Thought so&hellip; I want to hire you.&rdquo; He said. You crossed your\narms. </p><p>&ldquo;What does that entail, and what do I gain from it?&rdquo; You\nasked further. </p><p>&ldquo;A decent paycheck, fame, and if your reputation grows good,\nthen you&rsquo;ll be called in to become an Avenger like me.&rdquo; He explained. &ldquo;Why,\nwhat else would you want? I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rdquo; He offered. </p><p>&ldquo;I want a place to stay.&rdquo; You answered, barely missing a\nbeat, seeing his features shift. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re homeless?&rdquo; He asked, shifting foot to foot. </p><p>&ldquo;Yep. Have been since I was a teenager. All because of my\npowers. I want somewhere to stay at least until I can pay the rent myself.&rdquo; You\nexplained. Soon that smile returned. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright. I can arrange that. I&rsquo;ll also let you pick out a\nnew guitar since you smashed it to save me for the second time from being shot.\nCome on then.&rdquo; He motioned his head for you to follow, even offering his hand\nfor you. While you didn&rsquo;t take it, you did follow after him. Finally, maybe\nsomething good was coming from stopping time. </p><hr /><p>Hope you like it!

She wanted a new start and no matter what her mother said about not being able to control her powers, she would leave.</p><p>Her father had known about her. She had been an experiment. According to her mother, they had met in 1975, a year before Alexa&rsquo;s birth and Howard had inserted a mysterious chemical onto her uterus, when she was sleeping. She had not known then that she was pregnant with Alexa. Not that her mother called her Alexa then. She had wanted to call her first child after her country- Hrvatska. Alexa was still thankful she decided not to.</p><p>As soon as Alexa&rsquo;s mother found out, she left, with her last words to Howard being in her native language and quite rude. She travelled to London and had raised her daughter there.</p><p>For as long as Alexa could remember, she could control time. When she was young, she could slow time and use it to run out of an uncomfortable situation. She could also teleport to different places, although the further it was the more energy it would take.</p><p>When she was in med school in Seattle (they had an incredible teaching school there), Alexa had bumped into him at a coffee shop and he had immediately recognised her. Apparently, she had been in their fathers&rsquo; files and Tony had thought that she was dead because the file said unknown on her locations. In her file, Howard had put how she had been injected with some chemical left over from a magical cube in the 40s. Tony had told her their father spent most of Tony&rsquo;s life searching for Captain America.</p><p>Smiling, he basically forced her to come on a&nbsp;&lsquo;Brother-Sister Bonding Trip&rsquo;. Alexa remembered thinking that he was crazy and craved a familial bond.&nbsp; She never regretted going along with him.</p><p>Since then, they&rsquo;d become incredibly close. Because she lived in Seattle, he tended to travel once every fortnight to see her and they always had Friday Face time. He had helped her find out how to better control her powers and even made her a cool suit.</p><hr /><p>&lsquo;Lil&rsquo; Grey, close up for me.&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Oh my God, really?&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Yes, now do it before I chose someone else.&rsquo;<br /></p><p>Alexa threw her bloody scrubs in the bin and left the operating room.</p><p>&lsquo;Yo, Ali, your brother is waiting for you in Hunt&rsquo;s office.&rsquo; Jackson strode with her.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Great. Did you watch my Harper-Avery-winning, mind-blowing surgery?&rsquo; Alexa smirked, sarcasm dripping from her lips.<br /></p><p>Jackson laughed,&rsquo;I think I would know if you win any Harper Averies.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Avery, come here,&rsquo; Mark Sloan ran up to Jackson and took his arm,&rsquo;Hey, nice surgery, Scone Woman!&rsquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Thanks, man-whore!&rsquo; Alexa shouted to the running men, entering the Chief of Surgery&rsquo;s office.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;Hey, sis.&rsquo;<br /></p>",
