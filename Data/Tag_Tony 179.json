Open Communication</h2><p>Steve and Clint returned just fine. \u00a0The worry was absolutely over nothing. \u00a0When he got home, I punched him in the arm and told him not to scare me like that. \u00a0He pulled me into his arms and held me against his chest, resting his cheek on the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for scaring you. \u00a0I just wanted you to know.\u201d \u00a0He said.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around his waist and breathed him in. \u00a0\u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to get used to the whole \u2018going out on missions\u2019 thing, aren\u2019t I?\u201d \u00a0I said into his chest.</p><p>\u201cWell, the good thing is there are eight people here you can talk to when you\u2019re freaking out. \u00a0We\u2019ve all got your back.\u201d \u00a0He said. \u00a0I looked up and he leaned down and kissed me softly. \u00a0\u201cI love you, Elly.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cLove you too, Steve,\u201d \u00a0I said with a smile.</p><p>The missions were tough. \u00a0It was one thing when it was just one or two of them, but when it was all of them I had trouble doing anything. \u00a0My work suffered, my stomach was constantly in knots, and I couldn\u2019t sleep. \u00a0I ended up seeing a therapist. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t until I started, that I realized how badly I needed it. \u00a0Not just for the stress of losing them. \u00a0I was in a relationship with eight people. \u00a0Eight superheroes who were famous, and could absolutely never come clean about the lives they lived because of the expectations society put on them. \u00a0It was surprising how much that had been weighing on me. \u00a0Having someone objective helping me and just listening to me was a godsend.</p><p>One of the issues I had was coming to terms with the fact that Tony kept throwing money at me. \u00a0I was fine with the way he spent it on himself or the others, but if he came to me with anything more than a t-shirt the first words out of my mouth were \u2018Tony, no.\u2019</p><p>It was something Tony had trouble with too. \u00a0He had the kind of money that spending it was nothing to him. \u00a0He could buy and sell companies without a thought. \u00a0So buying me a piece of jewelry or a little Knick Knack was nothing to him. \u00a0Having someone balk at the way he showed affection was painful for him too.</p><p>One day he came into my apartment while I was sorting out my finances. \u00a0Mostly paying off the different debts I had accrued since I ran away from home.</p><p>He dropped down on the couch next to me and draped his arm over the back of the couch behind me. \u00a0\u201cI thought we could go out.\u201d \u00a0He said.</p><p>\u201cYep, just give me a minute,\u201d \u00a0I answered, giving his thigh a rub.</p><p>Tony looked over my shoulder at what I was doing. \u00a0\u201cIs that how much debt you\u2019re in?\u201d \u00a0He said, dragging the computer over to him.</p><p>I snatched it back so I could continue doing what I was doing. \u00a0\u201cSome of it,\u201d \u00a0I said going back to what I was doing.</p><p>\u201cI can take care of it for you.\u201d \u00a0He said pulling out his phone.</p><p>I took the phone from his hand and put it on the coffee table. \u00a0\u201cTony, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? \u00a0It\u2019s nothing. \u00a0Let me do this for you.\u201d \u00a0He said, picking his phone back up again.</p><p>I moved my computer away and put my hand on his phone. \u00a0\u201cOkay, time for some open communication. \u00a0You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit. \u00a0What did I do?\u201d \u00a0Tony groaned.</p><p>\u201cNothing. \u00a0Nothing.\u201d \u00a0I moved his phone back to the coffee table and took both his hands in mine. \u00a0I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u00a0\u201cSo, out in the real world, you have a lot of fans. \u00a0You may have noticed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho can blame them? \u00a0I am Tony Stark.\u201d \u00a0He teased.</p><p>I chuckled and kissed the back of his hands. \u00a0\u201cThe term \u2018sugar daddy\u2019 gets used a lot out there. \u00a0I just\u2026 \u00a0don\u2019t want you to ever think that\u2019s why I am here. \u00a0I don\u2019t want you to think I only care about you for your money. \u00a0 You could go bankrupt tomorrow and I\u2019d still want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. \u00a0That\u2019s just\u2026 \u00a0No.\u201d \u00a0He said, looking at me shocked. \u00a0\u201cI have never thought that about you. \u00a0 I want to be able to look at something, go, El would love that and be able to buy it without you freaking out that I\u2019m spending too much on you. I make a ridiculous amount of money. I might not ever be able to say\u2026 I.\u201d \u00a0He coughed like he was trying to clear his throat. \u00a0\u201cLove.\u201d \u00a0 He paused his eyes darting around the room. \u201cYou know? \u00a0But I can buy you stuff. And stuff that is you, and that you\u2019ll like. It\u2019s as much part of my thing.\u201d \u00a0He tapped his temple.</p><p>I felt the threat of tears about to happen, and I wiped under my eyes with my fingertips. \u00a0\u201cUh oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not yelling at you. I don't\u2026. this is\u2026 I have\u2026There are\u2026\u201d \u00a0He rambled. \u00a0\u201cI have my issues. And one of them is the not verbalizing. And the other is the showering people with stuff for the not verbalizing.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my head against his chest for a moment. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d \u00a0I said. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to hear, and it\u2019s harder for me to say. \u00a0You ready for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d \u00a0He said quietly.</p><p>I sat back and looked at him. \u00a0\u201cSo you know how my dad is a complete piece of garbage right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d \u00a0He said, the word tinged with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cI know my dad loved me. \u00a0You know how I know that? \u00a0Every time he physically hurt me he would make up for it by buying me something. \u00a0When I was a kid he broke my arm, and the next day I got a new pony. \u00a0When I was sixteen I bought my girlfriend home and he dislocated my shoulder. \u00a0The next day he gave me a new car.\u201d \u00a0I explained.</p><p>Tony looked at me for a moment and then wrapped both his arms around me and pulled me against him. \u00a0\u201cShit. \u00a0Fuck. \u00a0I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u00a0He muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. \u00a0You didn\u2019t do that to me.\u201d \u00a0I said, snuggling into his chest.</p><p>\u201cI just\u2026 \u00a0I don\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d \u00a0He stammered.</p><p>I sat back and looked at him. \u00a0\u201cI know why you do it, Tony. \u00a0We\u2019re both in the bad dad club here. \u00a0But please know this, I\u2019m trying. \u00a0I\u2019m trying to be okay with it because you aren\u2019t him, and that\u2019s your way. \u00a0I get it. \u00a0I just\u2026 please know you\u2019re enough. \u00a0Without the money, you\u2019re enough. \u00a0Without saying the words you\u2019re enough. \u00a0I know how you feel about me and what you do is enough.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me into a hard kiss his hands going to my hair. \u00a0I cupped his jaw and ran my hands through his beard and down his neck. He pulled back and leaned his forehead on mine. \u00a0\u201cI love you, Tony,\u201d \u00a0I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI - You\u2026 \u00a0I.\u201d \u00a0 He stuttered.</p><p>I put my finger to his lips. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay. \u00a0Don\u2019t force it. \u00a0Now, I think we\u2019ve pushed this emotional stuff far enough. \u00a0We need to inject some snark.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and kissed my cheek. \u00a0\u201cDork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d \u00a0I joked pulling my computer back towards me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna let me pay that for you now though right? \u00a0Since we\u2019re both trying now?\u201d \u00a0He teased picking up his phone.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d \u00a0I yelled, shoving him.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5baf779348c3f6860c7902c2b9e1f299/tumblr_inline_pkmdnwKegK1wtom06_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"27\"/></figure><p>A few days later, Wanda, Natasha and I had our girls night. \u00a0We could only convince Natasha to do it if it was in her apartment. \u00a0So Wanda and I went to Natasha\u2019s apartment in pajamas and laden down with alcohol, popcorn, and candy. \u00a0I somehow even managed to get Natasha to sit on the ground in front of me so I could braid her hair while we watched a movie.</p><p>\u201cThere is not enough vodka in the world for this,\u201d \u00a0Natasha said taking a drink straight from the bottle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe her.\u201d \u00a0Wanda teased. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s loving it. \u00a0Every time your fingers touch her scalp she gets all shivery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanda!\u201d \u00a0Natasha yelped and jumped to her feet. \u00a0Wanda scrambled over the back of the couch and Natasha launched herself at her. \u00a0Wanda\u2019s hands went up and she caught Natasha mid-air with her powers and they both broke down into laughter.</p><p>Wanda placed Natasha back on the floor and they both took up the spots where they were sitting in before. \u00a0I went back to braiding Natasha\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cHey Tasha, can I ask you a question?\u201d \u00a0 I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mishka,\u201d \u00a0Natasha replied.</p><p>\u201cHow come when you are with me alone, or when we\u2019re with Steve or Clint you\u2019re at least a little bit domme, but with Bucky not at all?\u201d \u00a0I asked.</p><p>Natasha tilted her head back so it was on my lap and she was looking up at me. \u00a0She sighed. \u00a0\u201cYou know how I\u2019ve told you about the Red Room? \u00a0Where I grew up? \u00a0What they did to me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u00a0It was not a topic she brought up often. \u00a0It was grisly and awful and made my childhood look quite pleasant in comparison.</p><p>\u201cJames was there too,\u201d \u00a0Natasha said. \u00a0\u201cWell\u2026 not James. The Winter Soldier. \u00a0I saw what they did to him. \u00a0I know what he\u2019s been through. \u00a0I see him now and I just can\u2019t do that to him. \u00a0He\u2019s never asked. \u00a0So we just\u2026 play a different game.\u201d</p><p>I leaned down and kissed Natasha on the forehead and she reached up holding me in place as she brought her lips to mine. \u00a0Our tongues circled together and when I pulled back she dragged her teeth over my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do that domme stuff with me either,\u201d \u00a0 Wanda said.</p><p>Natasha, turned around shaking her hair so that the braid I\u2019d been doing fell loose, she crawled up onto the couch like she was a cat stalking a mouse. \u00a0\u201cThat is because you are my little za\u0301i\u0306ka.\u201d \u00a0She purred.</p><p>Wanda giggled and wrapped her arms around Natasha\u2019s neck. \u00a0The two of them kissed. \u00a0Wanda couldn\u2019t stop smiling through it. \u00a0When then broke apart Natasha sat back between both Wanda and me, and we curled into her. \u00a0\u201cIf I am your bunny and Elly is your mouse, what does that make you?\u201d \u00a0 Wanda asked.</p><p>\u201cI am the fox and I am going to eat you both.\u201d She said.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a sweet deal,\u201d \u00a0I said, nuzzling under her neck and placing slow open mouth kisses on her throat. \u00a0Natasha chuckled and ran her fingers up and down my back.</p><p>\u201cThat is lisichka in Russian?\u201d \u00a0Wanda asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d \u00a0Natasha answered. \u00a0 She leaned over towards Wanda and teased her lips over Wanda\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIn \u0159omani \u010dhib, it\u2019s veshen jukkal.\u201d \u00a0Wanda said.</p><p>They kissed again and I reached over and ran my hand up Wanda\u2019s thigh. \u00a0Natasha\u2019s hand went to Wanda\u2019s head and she brushed her hair from her face before cupping her cheek. \u00a0\u201cI think we should go to the bedroom. \u00a0What do you think, my sweet girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d \u00a0I agreed, getting to my feet. \u00a0Wanda and Natasha followed after me and we stripped our clothes off as we went dropping garments like a trail of breadcrumbs from the living room to the bedroom.</p><p>Wanda and I climbed up onto the bed and sat at the bedhead with our knees pulled up against ourselves waiting for Natasha to follow us. \u00a0She stood at the end of the bed looking at us. \u00a0Her deep red hair spilled over her pale shoulders in stark contrast. \u00a0\u201cYou girls start without me, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Wanda and I turned to each other and started kissing. \u00a0As we kissed we wriggled down and tangled our legs together. \u00a0The pink glow of Wanda\u2019s energy projection engaging swirled over her fingers and spread over me. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t focused on anything, just a general tingle being added to my skin making my hair follicles stand on end. \u00a0Our hands trailed over each other with no particular aim. \u00a0We just wanted to touch as much as we could.</p><p>Natasha returned to the room with a handful of toys, she climbed up on the bed and spooned me from behind kissing a trail over my shoulders. \u00a0She reached over me and began to knead Wanda\u2019s breasts. \u00a0Wanda and I broke our kiss and Wanda and Natasha began kissing over my shoulder. \u00a0The buzz became more focused, teasing my nipples and flickering against my clit. \u00a0The same must have started happening to Nat too because she let out a soft hum.</p><p>I kissed a trail down to Wanda\u2019s breasts and sucked a nipple into my mouth. \u00a0I pressed my teeth on it and flicked my tongue over the top. \u00a0Wanda made a squeaking sound and I smiled against her skin and kept moving down. \u00a0When I reached her pussy I spread her folds with my fingers and ran my tongue up them. \u00a0The intensity of the buzz increased and I whimpered against Wanda\u2019s cunt. \u00a0I began to flick my tongue, starting with just tiny kitten licks on her clit. \u00a0There was a shift of bodies around me and I rolled over so my head was between Wanda\u2019s leg and every lick went from her clit down to her entrance. \u00a0Natasha lay so she formed a triangle between Wanda and I. \u00a0Her mouth went to my cunt as Wanda began to lap at Natasha\u2019s.</p><p>The room began to fill with the sounds of our moans and whimpers as we each gradually brought the other to orgasm with our mouths. \u00a0 The buzz Wanda created continued to tease us. \u00a0It vibrated against my tongue as I flicked it over her clit and dipped it inside of her. \u00a0Wanda and Natasha seemed perfectly in tune with each other and me. \u00a0Like they could read every twitch and moan. \u00a0So when I felt that pressure in my core push down on me, threatening to break, Wanda\u2019s walls began to clench and flutter against my fingers. \u00a0When I came so did Natasha and Wanda. \u00a0The room filled with the sound of us, and I drank up Wanda\u2019s juices as I lapped through her orgasm.</p><p>When it passed through us we moved back up the bed, this time Natasha picked up the toys and handed one each to me and Wanda. \u00a0They were each vibrators, one red, and two slightly different shades of purple. \u00a0All three meant for g-spot and clit stimulation and each a little different to each other. \u00a0We lay down and turned the toys on. \u00a0I held mine against Natasha\u2019s clit and began to kiss Wanda neck. \u00a0Natasha began teasing Wanda\u2019s pussy with her vibe and latched onto my breast while Wanda began using her vibe on me and placed small kisses along Natasha\u2019s collarbone.</p><p>We became a tangled mass of mouths and limbs. \u00a0Fucking each other with the vibes as our mouths explored the rest. \u00a0We marked each other to the point that it was hard to know who caused which bruise. \u00a0There was no timing involved with the toys. \u00a0We just kept bringing each other to orgasm again and again until eventually we were all sweating and trembling and our voices were raw.</p><p>\u201cStop. \u00a0Stop.\u201d \u00a0Wanda croaked, taking the toy from me and pushing Natasha away from her. \u00a0We all stopped and collapsed down into a panting mess of limbs.</p><p>\u201cI lost track of how many times I came then.\u201d \u00a0I panted.</p><p>\u201cI think we all did, Mishka,\u201d \u00a0Natasha said and pressed her lips to my temple.</p><p>Wanda hummed and rested her head on my shoulder. \u00a0\u201cGirls night is fun.

And stuff that is you, and that you\u2019ll like. It\u2019s as much part of my thing.\u201d \u00a0He tapped his temple.</p><p>I felt the threat of tears about to happen, and I wiped under my eyes with my fingertips. \u00a0\u201cUh oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.

her hair so that the braid I\u2019d been doing fell loose, she crawled up onto the couch like she was a cat stalking a mouse. \u00a0\u201cThat is because you are my little za\u0301i\u0306ka.\u201d \u00a0She purred.</p><p>Wanda giggled and wrapped her arms around Natasha\u2019s neck. \u00a0The two of them kissed. \u00a0Wanda couldn\u2019t stop smiling through it. \u00a0When then broke apart Natasha sat back between both Wanda and me, and we curled into her. \u00a0\u201cIf I am your bunny and Elly is your mouse, what does that make you?\u201d \u00a0 Wanda asked.</p><p>\u201cI am the fox and I am going to eat you both.\u201d She said.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a sweet deal,\u201d \u00a0I said, nuzzling under her neck and placing slow open mouth kisses on her throat. \u00a0Natasha chuckled and ran her fingers up and down my back.</p><p>\u201cThat is lisichka in Russian?\u201d \u00a0Wanda asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d \u00a0Natasha answered. \u00a0 She leaned over towards Wanda and teased her lips over Wanda\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIn \u0159omani \u010dhib, it\u2019s veshen jukkal.\u201d \u00a0Wanda said.</p><p>They kissed again and I reached over and ran my hand up Wanda\u2019s thigh. \u00a0Natasha\u2019s hand went to Wanda\u2019s head and she brushed her hair from her face before cupping her cheek. \u00a0\u201cI think we should go to the bedroom. \u00a0What do you think, my sweet girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d \u00a0I agreed, getting to my feet. \u00a0Wanda and Natasha followed after me and we stripped our clothes off as we went dropping garments like a trail of breadcrumbs from the living room to the bedroom.</p><p>Wanda and I climbed up onto the bed and sat at the bedhead with our knees pulled up against ourselves waiting for Natasha to follow us. \u00a0She stood at the end of the bed looking at us. \u00a0Her deep red hair spilled over her pale shoulders in stark contrast. \u00a0\u201cYou girls start without me, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Wanda and I turned to each other and started kissing. \u00a0As we kissed we wriggled down and tangled our legs together. \u00a0The pink glow of Wanda\u2019s energy projection engaging swirled over her fingers and spread over me. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t focused on anything, just a general tingle being added to my skin making my hair follicles stand on end. \u00a0Our hands trailed over each other with no particular aim. \u00a0We just wanted to touch as much as we could.</p><p>Natasha returned to the room with a handful of toys, she climbed up on the bed and spooned me from behind kissing a trail over my shoulders. \u00a0She reached over me and began to knead Wanda\u2019s breasts. \u00a0Wanda and I broke our kiss and Wanda and Natasha began kissing over my shoulder. \u00a0The buzz became more focused, teasing my nipples and flickering against my clit. \u00a0The same must have started happening to Nat too because she let out a soft hum.</p><p>I kissed a trail down to Wanda\u2019s breasts and sucked a nipple into my mouth. \u00a0I pressed my teeth on it and flicked my tongue over the top. \u00a0Wanda made a squeaking sound and I smiled against her skin and kept moving down. \u00a0When I reached her pussy I spread her folds with my fingers and ran my tongue up them. \u00a0The intensity of the buzz increased and I whimpered against Wanda\u2019s cunt. \u00a0I began to flick my tongue, starting with just tiny kitten licks on her clit. \u00a0There was a shift of bodies around me and I rolled over so my head was between Wanda\u2019s leg and every lick went from her clit down to her entrance. \u00a0Natasha lay so she formed a triangle between Wanda and I. \u00a0Her mouth went to my cunt as Wanda began to lap at Natasha\u2019s.</p><p>The room began to fill with the sounds of our moans and whimpers as we each gradually brought the other to orgasm with our mouths. \u00a0 The buzz Wanda created continued to tease us. \u00a0It vibrated against my tongue as I flicked it over her clit and dipped it inside of her. \u00a0Wanda and Natasha seemed perfectly in tune with each other and me. \u00a0Like they could read every twitch and moan. \u00a0So when I felt that pressure in my core push down on me, threatening to break, Wanda\u2019s walls began to clench and flutter against my fingers. \u00a0When I came so did Natasha and Wanda. \u00a0The room filled with the sound of us, and I drank up Wanda\u2019s juices as I lapped through her orgasm.</p><p>When it passed through us we moved back up the bed, this time Natasha picked up the toys and handed one each to me and Wanda. \u00a0They were each vibrators, one red, and two slightly different shades of purple. \u00a0All three meant for g-spot and clit stimulation and each a little different to each other. \u00a0We lay down and turned the toys on. \u00a0I held mine against Natasha\u2019s clit and began to kiss Wanda neck. \u00a0Natasha began teasing Wanda\u2019s pussy with her vibe and latched onto my breast while Wanda began using her vibe on me and placed small kisses along Natasha\u2019s collarbone.</p><p>We became a tangled mass of mouths and limbs. \u00a0Fucking each other with the vibes as our mouths explored the rest. \u00a0We marked each other to the point that it was hard to know who caused which bruise. \u00a0There was no timing involved with the toys. \u00a0We just kept bringing each other to orgasm again and again until eventually we were all sweating and trembling and our voices were raw.</p><p>\u201cStop. \u00a0Stop.\u201d \u00a0Wanda croaked, taking the toy from me and pushing Natasha away from her. \u00a0We all stopped and collapsed down into a panting mess of limbs.</p><p>\u201cI lost track of how many times I came then.\u201d \u00a0I panted.</p><p>\u201cI think we all did, Mishka,\u201d \u00a0Natasha said and pressed her lips to my temple.</p><p>Wanda hummed and rested her head on my shoulder. \u00a0\u201cGirls night is fun. \u00a0We should do this more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, everyone knows that boys have cooties.\u201d \u00a0I teased.</p><p>Natasha and Wanda laughed. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork,\u201d Natasha said.</p><p>I hummed and gave them both a squeeze. \u00a0\u201cMm\u2026 \u00a0I know. \u00a0I love you both, too.\u201d</p></p>",

Open Communication</h2><p>Steve and Clint returned just fine. \u00a0The worry was absolutely over nothing. \u00a0When he got home, I punched him in the arm and told him not to scare me like that. \u00a0He pulled me into his arms and held me against his chest, resting his cheek on the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for scaring you. \u00a0I just wanted you to know.\u201d \u00a0He said.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around his waist and breathed him in. \u00a0\u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to get used to the whole \u2018going out on missions\u2019 thing, aren\u2019t I?\u201d \u00a0I said into his chest.</p><p>\u201cWell, the good thing is there are eight people here you can talk to when you\u2019re freaking out. \u00a0We\u2019ve all got your back.\u201d \u00a0He said. \u00a0I looked up and he leaned down and kissed me softly. \u00a0\u201cI love you, Elly.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cLove you too, Steve,\u201d \u00a0I said with a smile.</p><p>The missions were tough. \u00a0It was one thing when it was just one or two of them, but when it was all of them I had trouble doing anything. \u00a0My work suffered, my stomach was constantly in knots, and I couldn\u2019t sleep. \u00a0I ended up seeing a therapist. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t until I started, that I realized how badly I needed it. \u00a0Not just for the stress of losing them. \u00a0I was in a relationship with eight people. \u00a0Eight superheroes who were famous, and could absolutely never come clean about the lives they lived because of the expectations society put on them. \u00a0It was surprising how much that had been weighing on me. \u00a0Having someone objective helping me and just listening to me was a godsend.</p><p>One of the issues I had was coming to terms with the fact that Tony kept throwing money at me. \u00a0I was fine with the way he spent it on himself or the others, but if he came to me with anything more than a t-shirt the first words out of my mouth were \u2018Tony, no.\u2019</p><p>It was something Tony had trouble with too. \u00a0He had the kind of money that spending it was nothing to him. \u00a0He could buy and sell companies without a thought. \u00a0So buying me a piece of jewelry or a little Knick Knack was nothing to him. \u00a0Having someone balk at the way he showed affection was painful for him too.</p><p>One day he came into my apartment while I was sorting out my finances. \u00a0Mostly paying off the different debts I had accrued since I ran away from home.</p><p>He dropped down on the couch next to me and draped his arm over the back of the couch behind me. \u00a0\u201cI thought we could go out.\u201d \u00a0He said.</p><p>\u201cYep, just give me a minute,\u201d \u00a0I answered, giving his thigh a rub.</p><p>Tony looked over my shoulder at what I was doing. \u00a0\u201cIs that how much debt you\u2019re in?\u201d \u00a0He said, dragging the computer over to him.</p><p>I snatched it back so I could continue doing what I was doing. \u00a0\u201cSome of it,\u201d \u00a0I said going back to what I was doing.</p><p>\u201cI can take care of it for you.\u201d \u00a0He said pulling out his phone.</p><p>I took the phone from his hand and put it on the coffee table. \u00a0\u201cTony, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? \u00a0It\u2019s nothing. \u00a0Let me do this for you.\u201d \u00a0He said, picking his phone back up again.</p><p>I moved my computer away and put my hand on his phone. \u00a0\u201cOkay, time for some open communication. \u00a0You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit. \u00a0What did I do?\u201d \u00a0Tony groaned.</p><p>\u201cNothing. \u00a0Nothing.\u201d \u00a0I moved his phone back to the coffee table and took both his hands in mine. \u00a0I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u00a0\u201cSo, out in the real world, you have a lot of fans. \u00a0You may have noticed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho can blame them? \u00a0I am Tony Stark.\u201d \u00a0He teased.</p><p>I chuckled and kissed the back of his hands. \u00a0\u201cThe term \u2018sugar daddy\u2019 gets used a lot out there. \u00a0I just\u2026 \u00a0don\u2019t want you to ever think that\u2019s why I am here. \u00a0I don\u2019t want you to think I only care about you for your money. \u00a0 You could go bankrupt tomorrow and I\u2019d still want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. \u00a0That\u2019s just\u2026 \u00a0No.\u201d \u00a0He said, looking at me shocked. \u00a0\u201cI have never thought that about you. \u00a0 I want to be able to look at something, go, El would love that and be able to buy it without you freaking out that I\u2019m spending too much on you. I make a ridiculous amount of money. I might not ever be able to say\u2026 I.\u201d \u00a0He coughed like he was trying to clear his throat. \u00a0\u201cLove.\u201d \u00a0 He paused his eyes darting around the room. \u201cYou know? \u00a0But I can buy you stuff. And stuff that is you, and that you\u2019ll like. It\u2019s as much part of my thing.\u201d \u00a0He tapped his temple.</p><p>I felt the threat of tears about to happen, and I wiped under my eyes with my fingertips. \u00a0\u201cUh oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not yelling at you. I don't\u2026. this is\u2026 I have\u2026There are\u2026\u201d \u00a0He rambled. \u00a0\u201cI have my issues. And one of them is the not verbalizing. And the other is the showering people with stuff for the not verbalizing.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my head against his chest for a moment. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d \u00a0I said. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to hear, and it\u2019s harder for me to say. \u00a0You ready for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d \u00a0He said quietly.</p><p>I sat back and looked at him. \u00a0\u201cSo you know how my dad is a complete piece of garbage right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d \u00a0He said, the word tinged with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cI know my dad loved me. \u00a0You know how I know that? \u00a0Every time he physically hurt me he would make up for it by buying me something. \u00a0When I was a kid he broke my arm, and the next day I got a new pony. \u00a0When I was sixteen I bought my girlfriend home and he dislocated my shoulder. \u00a0The next day he gave me a new car.\u201d \u00a0I explained.</p><p>Tony looked at me for a moment and then wrapped both his arms around me and pulled me against him. \u00a0\u201cShit. \u00a0Fuck. \u00a0I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u00a0He muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. \u00a0You didn\u2019t do that to me.\u201d \u00a0I said, snuggling into his chest.</p><p>\u201cI just\u2026 \u00a0I don\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d \u00a0He stammered.</p><p>I sat back and looked at him. \u00a0\u201cI know why you do it, Tony. \u00a0We\u2019re both in the bad dad club here. \u00a0But please know this, I\u2019m trying. \u00a0I\u2019m trying to be okay with it because you aren\u2019t him, and that\u2019s your way. \u00a0I get it. \u00a0I just\u2026 please know you\u2019re enough. \u00a0Without the money, you\u2019re enough. \u00a0Without saying the words you\u2019re enough. \u00a0I know how you feel about me and what you do is enough.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me into a hard kiss his hands going to my hair. \u00a0I cupped his jaw and ran my hands through his beard and down his neck. He pulled back and leaned his forehead on mine. \u00a0\u201cI love you, Tony,\u201d \u00a0I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI - You\u2026 \u00a0I.\u201d \u00a0 He stuttered.</p><p>I put my finger to his lips. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay. \u00a0Don\u2019t force it. \u00a0Now, I think we\u2019ve pushed this emotional stuff far enough. \u00a0We need to inject some snark.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and kissed my cheek. \u00a0\u201cDork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d \u00a0I joked pulling my computer back towards me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna let me pay that for you now though right? \u00a0Since we\u2019re both trying now?\u201d \u00a0He teased picking up his phone.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d \u00a0I yelled, shoving him.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"27\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5baf779348c3f6860c7902c2b9e1f299/tumblr_inline_pkmdnwKegK1wtom06_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"27\"></figure><p>A few days later, Wanda, Natasha and I had our girls night. \u00a0We could only convince Natasha to do it if it was in her apartment. \u00a0So Wanda and I went to Natasha\u2019s apartment in pajamas and laden down with alcohol, popcorn, and candy. \u00a0I somehow even managed to get Natasha to sit on the ground in front of me so I could braid her hair while we watched a movie.</p><p>\u201cThere is not enough vodka in the world for this,\u201d \u00a0Natasha said taking a drink straight from the bottle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe her.\u201d \u00a0Wanda teased. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s loving it. \u00a0Every time your fingers touch her scalp she gets all shivery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanda!\u201d \u00a0Natasha yelped and jumped to her feet. \u00a0Wanda scrambled over the back of the couch and Natasha launched herself at her. \u00a0Wanda\u2019s hands went up and she caught Natasha mid-air with her powers and they both broke down into laughter.</p><p>Wanda placed Natasha back on the floor and they both took up the spots where they were sitting in before. \u00a0I went back to braiding Natasha\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cHey Tasha, can I ask you a question?\u201d \u00a0 I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mishka,\u201d \u00a0Natasha replied.</p><p>\u201cHow come when you are with me alone, or when we\u2019re with Steve or Clint you\u2019re at least a little bit domme, but with Bucky not at all?\u201d \u00a0I asked.</p><p>Natasha tilted her head back so it was on my lap and she was looking up at me. \u00a0She sighed. \u00a0\u201cYou know how I\u2019ve told you about the Red Room? \u00a0Where I grew up? \u00a0What they did to me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u00a0It was not a topic she brought up often. \u00a0It was grisly and awful and made my childhood look quite pleasant in comparison.</p><p>\u201cJames was there too,\u201d \u00a0Natasha said. \u00a0\u201cWell\u2026 not James. The Winter Soldier. \u00a0I saw what they did to him. \u00a0I know what he\u2019s been through. \u00a0I see him now and I just can\u2019t do that to him. \u00a0He\u2019s never asked. \u00a0So we just\u2026 play a different game.\u201d</p><p>I leaned down and kissed Natasha on the forehead and she reached up holding me in place as she brought her lips to mine. \u00a0Our tongues circled together and when I pulled back she dragged her teeth over my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do that domme stuff with me either,\u201d \u00a0 Wanda said.</p><p>Natasha, turned around shaking her hair so that the braid I\u2019d been doing fell loose, she crawled up onto the couch like she was a cat stalking a mouse. \u00a0\u201cThat is because you are my little za\u0301i\u0306ka.\u201d \u00a0She purred.</p><p>Wanda giggled and wrapped her arms around Natasha\u2019s neck. \u00a0The two of them kissed. \u00a0Wanda couldn\u2019t stop smiling through it. \u00a0When then broke apart Natasha sat back between both Wanda and me, and we curled into her. \u00a0\u201cIf I am your bunny and Elly is your mouse, what does that make you?\u201d \u00a0 Wanda asked.</p><p>\u201cI am the fox and I am going to eat you both.\u201d She said.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a sweet deal,\u201d \u00a0I said, nuzzling under her neck and placing slow open mouth kisses on her throat. \u00a0Natasha chuckled and ran her fingers up and down my back.</p><p>\u201cThat is lisichka in Russian?\u201d \u00a0Wanda asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d \u00a0Natasha answered. \u00a0 She leaned over towards Wanda and teased her lips over Wanda\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIn \u0159omani \u010dhib, it\u2019s veshen jukkal.\u201d \u00a0Wanda said.</p><p>They kissed again and I reached over and ran my hand up Wanda\u2019s thigh. \u00a0Natasha\u2019s hand went to Wanda\u2019s head and she brushed her hair from her face before cupping her cheek. \u00a0\u201cI think we should go to the bedroom. \u00a0What do you think, my sweet girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d \u00a0I agreed, getting to my feet. \u00a0Wanda and Natasha followed after me and we stripped our clothes off as we went dropping garments like a trail of breadcrumbs from the living room to the bedroom.</p><p>Wanda and I climbed up onto the bed and sat at the bedhead with our knees pulled up against ourselves waiting for Natasha to follow us. \u00a0She stood at the end of the bed looking at us. \u00a0Her deep red hair spilled over her pale shoulders in stark contrast. \u00a0\u201cYou girls start without me, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Wanda and I turned to each other and started kissing. \u00a0As we kissed we wriggled down and tangled our legs together. \u00a0The pink glow of Wanda\u2019s energy projection engaging swirled over her fingers and spread over me. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t focused on anything, just a general tingle being added to my skin making my hair follicles stand on end. \u00a0Our hands trailed over each other with no particular aim. \u00a0We just wanted to touch as much as we could.</p><p>Natasha returned to the room with a handful of toys, she climbed up on the bed and spooned me from behind kissing a trail over my shoulders. \u00a0She reached over me and began to knead Wanda\u2019s breasts. \u00a0Wanda and I broke our kiss and Wanda and Natasha began kissing over my shoulder. \u00a0The buzz became more focused, teasing my nipples and flickering against my clit. \u00a0The same must have started happening to Nat too because she let out a soft hum.</p><p>I kissed a trail down to Wanda\u2019s breasts and sucked a nipple into my mouth. \u00a0I pressed my teeth on it and flicked my tongue over the top. \u00a0Wanda made a squeaking sound and I smiled against her skin and kept moving down. \u00a0When I reached her pussy I spread her folds with my fingers and ran my tongue up them. \u00a0The intensity of the buzz increased and I whimpered against Wanda\u2019s cunt. \u00a0I began to flick my tongue, starting with just tiny kitten licks on her clit. \u00a0There was a shift of bodies around me and I rolled over so my head was between Wanda\u2019s leg and every lick went from her clit down to her entrance. \u00a0Natasha lay so she formed a triangle between Wanda and I. \u00a0Her mouth went to my cunt as Wanda began to lap at Natasha\u2019s.</p><p>The room began to fill with the sounds of our moans and whimpers as we each gradually brought the other to orgasm with our mouths. \u00a0 The buzz Wanda created continued to tease us. \u00a0It vibrated against my tongue as I flicked it over her clit and dipped it inside of her. \u00a0Wanda and Natasha seemed perfectly in tune with each other and me. \u00a0Like they could read every twitch and moan. \u00a0So when I felt that pressure in my core push down on me, threatening to break, Wanda\u2019s walls began to clench and flutter against my fingers. \u00a0When I came so did Natasha and Wanda. \u00a0The room filled with the sound of us, and I drank up Wanda\u2019s juices as I lapped through her orgasm.</p><p>When it passed through us we moved back up the bed, this time Natasha picked up the toys and handed one each to me and Wanda. \u00a0They were each vibrators, one red, and two slightly different shades of purple. \u00a0All three meant for g-spot and clit stimulation and each a little different to each other. \u00a0We lay down and turned the toys on. \u00a0I held mine against Natasha\u2019s clit and began to kiss Wanda neck. \u00a0Natasha began teasing Wanda\u2019s pussy with her vibe and latched onto my breast while Wanda began using her vibe on me and placed small kisses along Natasha\u2019s collarbone.</p><p>We became a tangled mass of mouths and limbs. \u00a0Fucking each other with the vibes as our mouths explored the rest. \u00a0We marked each other to the point that it was hard to know who caused which bruise. \u00a0There was no timing involved with the toys. \u00a0We just kept bringing each other to orgasm again and again until eventually we were all sweating and trembling and our voices were raw.</p><p>\u201cStop. \u00a0Stop.\u201d \u00a0Wanda croaked, taking the toy from me and pushing Natasha away from her. \u00a0We all stopped and collapsed down into a panting mess of limbs.</p><p>\u201cI lost track of how many times I came then.\u201d \u00a0I panted.</p><p>\u201cI think we all did, Mishka,\u201d \u00a0Natasha said and pressed her lips to my temple.</p><p>Wanda hummed and rested her head on my shoulder. \u00a0\u201cGirls night is fun. \u00a0We should do this more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, everyone knows that boys have cooties.\u201d \u00a0I teased.</p><p>Natasha and Wanda laughed. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork,\u201d Natasha said.</p><p>I hummed and gave them both a squeeze. \u00a0\u201cMm\u2026 \u00a0I know. \u00a0I love you both, too.\u201d</p></p>",

&nbsp;He said.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around his waist and breathed him in. &nbsp;&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m going to have to get used to the whole &lsquo;going out on missions&rsquo; thing, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; &nbsp;I said into his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, the good thing is there are eight people here you can talk to when you&rsquo;re freaking out. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve all got your back.&rdquo; &nbsp;He said. &nbsp;I looked up and he leaned down and kissed me softly. &nbsp;&ldquo;I love you, Elly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love you too, Steve,&rdquo; &nbsp;I said with a smile.</p><p>The missions were tough. &nbsp;It was one thing when it was just one or two of them, but when it was all of them I had trouble doing anything. &nbsp;My work suffered, my stomach was constantly in knots, and I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. &nbsp;I ended up seeing a therapist. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t until I started, that I realized how badly I needed it. &nbsp;Not just for the stress of losing them. &nbsp;I was in a relationship with eight people. &nbsp;Eight superheroes who were famous, and could absolutely never come clean about the lives they lived because of the expectations society put on them. &nbsp;It was surprising how much that had been weighing on me. &nbsp;Having someone objective helping me and just listening to me was a godsend.</p><p>One of the issues I had was coming to terms with the fact that Tony kept throwing money at me. &nbsp;I was fine with the way he spent it on himself or the others, but if he came to me with anything more than a t-shirt the first words out of my mouth were &lsquo;Tony, no.&rsquo;</p><p>It was something Tony had trouble with too. &nbsp;He had the kind of money that spending it was nothing to him. &nbsp;He could buy and sell companies without a thought. &nbsp;So buying me a piece of jewelry or a little Knick Knack was nothing to him. &nbsp;Having someone balk at the way he showed affection was painful for him too.</p><p>One day he came into my apartment while I was sorting out my finances. &nbsp;Mostly paying off the different debts I had accrued since I ran away from home.</p><p>He dropped down on the couch next to me and draped his arm over the back of the couch behind me. &nbsp;&ldquo;I thought we could go out.&rdquo; &nbsp;He said.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, just give me a minute,&rdquo; &nbsp;I answered, giving his thigh a rub.</p><p>Tony looked over my shoulder at what I was doing. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is that how much debt you&rsquo;re in?&rdquo; &nbsp;He said, dragging the computer over to him.</p><p>I snatched it back so I could continue doing what I was doing. &nbsp;&ldquo;Some of it,&rdquo; &nbsp;I said going back to what I was doing.</p><p>&ldquo;I can take care of it for you.&rdquo; &nbsp;He said pulling out his phone.</p><p>I took the phone from his hand and put it on the coffee table. &nbsp;&ldquo;Tony, please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s nothing. &nbsp;Let me do this for you.&rdquo; &nbsp;He said, picking his phone back up again.</p><p>I moved my computer away and put my hand on his phone. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, time for some open communication. &nbsp;You ready?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shit. &nbsp;What did I do?&rdquo; &nbsp;Tony groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing. &nbsp;Nothing.&rdquo; &nbsp;I moved his phone back to the coffee table and took both his hands in mine. &nbsp;I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. &nbsp;&ldquo;So, out in the real world, you have a lot of fans. &nbsp;You may have noticed that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who can blame them? &nbsp;I am Tony Stark.&rdquo; &nbsp;He teased.</p><p>I chuckled and kissed the back of his hands. &nbsp;&ldquo;The term &lsquo;sugar daddy&rsquo; gets used a lot out there. &nbsp;I just&hellip; &nbsp;don&rsquo;t want you to ever think that&rsquo;s why I am here. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want you to think I only care about you for your money. &nbsp; You could go bankrupt tomorrow and I&rsquo;d still want to be with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s just&hellip; &nbsp;No.&rdquo; &nbsp;He said, looking at me shocked. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have never thought that about you. &nbsp; I want to be able to look at something, go, El would love that and be able to buy it without you freaking out that I&rsquo;m spending too much on you. I make a ridiculous amount of money. I might not ever be able to say&hellip; I.&rdquo; &nbsp;He coughed like he was trying to clear his throat. &nbsp;&ldquo;Love.&rdquo; &nbsp; He paused his eyes darting around the room. &ldquo;You know? &nbsp;But I can buy you stuff. And stuff that is you, and that you&rsquo;ll like. It&rsquo;s as much part of my thing.&rdquo; &nbsp;He tapped his temple.</p><p>I felt the threat of tears about to happen, and I wiped under my eyes with my fingertips. &nbsp;&ldquo;Uh oh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m not yelling at you. I don't&hellip;. this is&hellip; I have&hellip;There are&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;He rambled. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have my issues. And one of them is the not verbalizing. And the other is the showering people with stuff for the not verbalizing.&rdquo;</p><p>I pressed my head against his chest for a moment. &nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else,&rdquo; &nbsp;I said. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be hard to hear, and it&rsquo;s harder for me to say. &nbsp;You ready for it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; &nbsp;He said quietly.</p><p>I sat back and looked at him. &nbsp;&ldquo;So you know how my dad is a complete piece of garbage right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &nbsp;He said, the word tinged with suspicion.</p><p>&ldquo;I know my dad loved me. &nbsp;You know how I know that? &nbsp;Every time he physically hurt me he would make up for it by buying me something. &nbsp;When I was a kid he broke my arm, and the next day I got a new pony. &nbsp;When I was sixteen I bought my girlfriend home and he dislocated my shoulder. &nbsp;The next day he gave me a new car.&rdquo; &nbsp;I explained.</p><p>Tony looked at me for a moment and then wrapped both his arms around me and pulled me against him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Shit. &nbsp;Fuck. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; &nbsp;He muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault. &nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t do that to me.&rdquo; &nbsp;I said, snuggling into his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I just&hellip; &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t&hellip; I can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;He stammered.</p><p>I sat back and looked at him. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know why you do it, Tony. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re both in the bad dad club here. &nbsp;But please know this, I&rsquo;m trying. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m trying to be okay with it because you aren&rsquo;t him, and that&rsquo;s your way. &nbsp;I get it. &nbsp;I just&hellip; please know you&rsquo;re enough. &nbsp;Without the money, you&rsquo;re enough. &nbsp;Without saying the words you&rsquo;re enough. &nbsp;I know how you feel about me and what you do is enough.&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled me into a hard kiss his hands going to my hair. &nbsp;I cupped his jaw and ran my hands through his beard and down his neck. He pulled back and leaned his forehead on mine. &nbsp;&ldquo;I love you, Tony,&rdquo; &nbsp;I whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;I - You&hellip; &nbsp;I.&rdquo; &nbsp; He stuttered.</p><p>I put my finger to his lips. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t force it. &nbsp;Now, I think we&rsquo;ve pushed this emotional stuff far enough. &nbsp;We need to inject some snark.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed and kissed my cheek. &nbsp;&ldquo;Dork.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, so I&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo; &nbsp;I joked pulling my computer back towards me.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna let me pay that for you now though right? &nbsp;Since we&rsquo;re both trying now?&rdquo; &nbsp;He teased picking up his phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; &nbsp;I yelled, shoving him.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5baf779348c3f6860c7902c2b9e1f299/tumblr_inline_pkmdnwKegK1wtom06_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>A few days later, Wanda, Natasha and I had our girls night. &nbsp;We could only convince Natasha to do it if it was in her apartment. &nbsp;So Wanda and I went to Natasha&rsquo;s apartment in pajamas and laden down with alcohol, popcorn, and candy. &nbsp;I somehow even managed to get Natasha to sit on the ground in front of me so I could braid her hair while we watched a movie.</p><p>&ldquo;There is not enough vodka in the world for this,&rdquo; &nbsp;Natasha said taking a drink straight from the bottle.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe her.&rdquo; &nbsp;Wanda teased. &nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s loving it. &nbsp;Every time your fingers touch her scalp she gets all shivery.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wanda!&rdquo; &nbsp;Natasha yelped and jumped to her feet. &nbsp;Wanda scrambled over the back of the couch and Natasha launched herself at her. &nbsp;Wanda&rsquo;s hands went up and she caught Natasha mid-air with her powers and they both broke down into laughter.</p><p>Wanda placed Natasha back on the floor and they both took up the spots where they were sitting in before. &nbsp;I went back to braiding Natasha&rsquo;s hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Tasha, can I ask you a question?&rdquo; &nbsp; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Mishka,&rdquo; &nbsp;Natasha replied.</p><p>&ldquo;How come when you are with me alone, or when we&rsquo;re with Steve or Clint you&rsquo;re at least a little bit domme, but with Bucky not at all?&rdquo; &nbsp;I asked.</p><p>Natasha tilted her head back so it was on my lap and she was looking up at me. &nbsp;She sighed. &nbsp;&ldquo;You know how I&rsquo;ve told you about the Red Room? &nbsp;Where I grew up? &nbsp;What they did to me?&rdquo;</p><p>I nodded. &nbsp;It was not a topic she brought up often. &nbsp;It was grisly and awful and made my childhood look quite pleasant in comparison.</p><p>&ldquo;James was there too,&rdquo; &nbsp;Natasha said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well&hellip; not James. The Winter Soldier. &nbsp;I saw what they did to him. &nbsp;I know what he&rsquo;s been through. &nbsp;I see him now and I just can&rsquo;t do that to him. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s never asked. &nbsp;So we just&hellip; play a different game.&rdquo;</p><p>I leaned down and kissed Natasha on the forehead and she reached up holding me in place as she brought her lips to mine. &nbsp;Our tongues circled together and when I pulled back she dragged her teeth over my bottom lip.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t do that domme stuff with me either,&rdquo; &nbsp; Wanda said.</p><p>Natasha, turned around shaking her hair so that the braid I&rsquo;d been doing fell loose, she crawled up onto the couch like she was a cat stalking a mouse. &nbsp;&ldquo;That is because you are my little za&#769;i&#774;ka.&rdquo; &nbsp;She purred.</p><p>Wanda giggled and wrapped her arms around Natasha&rsquo;s neck. &nbsp;The two of them kissed. &nbsp;Wanda couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling through it. &nbsp;When then broke apart Natasha sat back between both Wanda and me, and we curled into her. &nbsp;&ldquo;If I am your bunny and Elly is your mouse, what does that make you?&rdquo; &nbsp; Wanda asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I am the fox and I am going to eat you both.&rdquo; She said.</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds like a sweet deal,&rdquo; &nbsp;I said, nuzzling under her neck and placing slow open mouth kisses on her throat. &nbsp;Natasha chuckled and ran her fingers up and down my back.</p><p>&ldquo;That is lisichka in Russian?&rdquo; &nbsp;Wanda asked.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; &nbsp;Natasha answered. &nbsp; She leaned over towards Wanda and teased her lips over Wanda&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;In &#345;omani &#269;hib, it&rsquo;s veshen jukkal.&rdquo; &nbsp;Wanda said.</p><p>They kissed again and I reached over and ran my hand up Wanda&rsquo;s thigh. &nbsp;Natasha&rsquo;s hand went to Wanda&rsquo;s head and she brushed her hair from her face before cupping her cheek. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think we should go to the bedroom. &nbsp;What do you think, my sweet girls?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds good to me.&rdquo; &nbsp;I agreed, getting to my feet. &nbsp;Wanda and Natasha followed after me and we stripped our clothes off as we went dropping garments like a trail of breadcrumbs from the living room to the bedroom.</p><p>Wanda and I climbed up onto the bed and sat at the bedhead with our knees pulled up against ourselves waiting for Natasha to follow us. &nbsp;She stood at the end of the bed looking at us. &nbsp;Her deep red hair spilled over her pale shoulders in stark contrast. &nbsp;&ldquo;You girls start without me, I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p><p>Wanda and I turned to each other and started kissing. &nbsp;As we kissed we wriggled down and tangled our legs together. &nbsp;The pink glow of Wanda&rsquo;s energy projection engaging swirled over her fingers and spread over me. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t focused on anything, just a general tingle being added to my skin making my hair follicles stand on end. &nbsp;Our hands trailed over each other with no particular aim. &nbsp;We just wanted to touch as much as we could.</p><p>Natasha returned to the room with a handful of toys, she climbed up on the bed and spooned me from behind kissing a trail over my shoulders. &nbsp;She reached over me and began to knead Wanda&rsquo;s breasts. &nbsp;Wanda and I broke our kiss and Wanda and Natasha began kissing over my shoulder. &nbsp;The buzz became more focused, teasing my nipples and flickering against my clit. &nbsp;The same must have started happening to Nat too because she let out a soft hum.</p><p>I kissed a trail down to Wanda&rsquo;s breasts and sucked a nipple into my mouth. &nbsp;I pressed my teeth on it and flicked my tongue over the top. &nbsp;Wanda made a squeaking sound and I smiled against her skin and kept moving down. &nbsp;When I reached her pussy I spread her folds with my fingers and ran my tongue up them. &nbsp;The intensity of the buzz increased and I whimpered against Wanda&rsquo;s cunt. &nbsp;I began to flick my tongue, starting with just tiny kitten licks on her clit. &nbsp;There was a shift of bodies around me and I rolled over so my head was between Wanda&rsquo;s leg and every lick went from her clit down to her entrance. &nbsp;Natasha lay so she formed a triangle between Wanda and I. &nbsp;Her mouth went to my cunt as Wanda began to lap at Natasha&rsquo;s.</p><p>The room began to fill with the sounds of our moans and whimpers as we each gradually brought the other to orgasm with our mouths. &nbsp; The buzz Wanda created continued to tease us. &nbsp;It vibrated against my tongue as I flicked it over her clit and dipped it inside of her. &nbsp;Wanda and Natasha seemed perfectly in tune with each other and me. &nbsp;Like they could read every twitch and moan. &nbsp;So when I felt that pressure in my core push down on me, threatening to break, Wanda&rsquo;s walls began to clench and flutter against my fingers. &nbsp;When I came so did Natasha and Wanda. &nbsp;The room filled with the sound of us, and I drank up Wanda&rsquo;s juices as I lapped through her orgasm.</p><p>When it passed through us we moved back up the bed, this time Natasha picked up the toys and handed one each to me and Wanda. &nbsp;They were each vibrators, one red, and two slightly different shades of purple. &nbsp;All three meant for g-spot and clit stimulation and each a little different to each other. &nbsp;We lay down and turned the toys on. &nbsp;I held mine against Natasha&rsquo;s clit and began to kiss Wanda neck. &nbsp;Natasha began teasing Wanda&rsquo;s pussy with her vibe and latched onto my breast while Wanda began using her vibe on me and placed small kisses along Natasha&rsquo;s collarbone.</p><p>We became a tangled mass of mouths and limbs. &nbsp;Fucking each other with the vibes as our mouths explored the rest. &nbsp;We marked each other to the point that it was hard to know who caused which bruise. &nbsp;There was no timing involved with the toys. &nbsp;We just kept bringing each other to orgasm again and again until eventually we were all sweating and trembling and our voices were raw.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop. &nbsp;Stop.&rdquo; &nbsp;Wanda croaked, taking the toy from me and pushing Natasha away from her. &nbsp;We all stopped and collapsed down into a panting mess of limbs.</p><p>&ldquo;I lost track of how many times I came then.&rdquo; &nbsp;I panted.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we all did, Mishka,&rdquo; &nbsp;Natasha said and pressed her lips to my temple.</p><p>Wanda hummed and rested her head on my shoulder. &nbsp;&ldquo;Girls night is fun. &nbsp;We should do this more often.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, everyone knows that boys have cooties.&rdquo; &nbsp;I teased.</p><p>Natasha and Wanda laughed. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a dork,&rdquo; Natasha said.</p><p>I hummed and gave them both a squeeze. &nbsp;&ldquo;Mm&hellip; &nbsp;I know. &nbsp;I love you both, too.&rdquo;</p></p>",
