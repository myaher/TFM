Hit the ball!\u201d Tony groaned when you missed it yet again. Being athletic wasn\u2019t something you did. The only reason why you were on the team besides the fact that you were Bucky\u2019s sister, was for your big brain. When HYDR captured your brother, they also took you. As much as they tried, they couldn\u2019t turn you into one of their little experiments. They tried to figure out why none of their tests were working on you when they figured out your brain was the key to your survival. It was the one thing keeping you from going darkside.<br/></p><p>Years later when you and Bucky found the Avengers, they were impressed with your smarts and wanted you to be their eyes and ears throughout the computer world. They made you feel like you had a family all over again. The one person who made you feel the most welcome was Tony. He was especially impressed with how much you knew about everything, and you told him that your IQ was 187, and you could process 20,000 words a minute. Your brother liked to call you a prodigy, but you knew you got those abilities when HYDRA began testing on you.</p><!-- more --><p>Nevertheless, Tony was impressed. You two got along quickly when he kept asking you about the Iron Man suit, letting you help build it or fix it, and Banner would also ask you for your assistance in his lab. Everyone seemed to enjoy having you on their team, but this is not what you expected when you accepted. Brains were the only thing going for you, so when Tony asked you to participate in their weekly game of baseball, you hesitated tremendously. He managed to convince you by telling you that he would give you full access to his database so that you could carry out a project you really wanted to work on.</p><p>Everyone who was up to bat never failed to hit the ball, and since there was so score points available, you got to stay up there for however long you needed. 40 minutes had passed since you first stepped onto the plate, and you hadn\u2019t hit the ball once. When your brother enlisted, you decided to let him do the labor and heavy lifting while you were more comfortable behind a computer screen or a book.</p><p>Your relationship with Tony was a special one, but you never thought he would tease you for this. He was always flirty with you, telling you how much he liked you in a certain kind of clothing or color, always telling you how smart you are, but today was different.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, Tony. We\u2019re all not equipped for games like this,\u201d you sighed when your brother threw the ball back to Tony. He offered to be the catcher, but you knew he only took that position to give you points and hints without anyone knowing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing the best she can!\u201d Bucky called out as Tony got ready to throw it again.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, I\u2019ll go easy on you,\u201d Tony said before tossing the ball instead of throwing it. However, you saw the ball and freaked which caused you to miss it yet again. The billionaire couldn\u2019t help but snicker before that turned into a full-on laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so bad at this!\u201d he continued to laugh. Bucky could sense you were about to cry at the attention you were getting, so he got up and took off his helmet before sending glares at him.</p><p>\u201cApologize right now! You\u2019re not helping anything!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N, I really am. I don\u2019t mean to make fun of you for this. I\u2019ve just never seen someone play so bad at the easiest game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust throw the fucking ball again,\u201d you growled, pushing back the urge to cry. Tony knew this wasn\u2019t going to be a big hit, so he decided to play it slowly once more. When your brother put his helmet back on, he gave you a minute before throwing the ball. As the ball came hurling towards you, you pictured Tony\u2019s face on it as he laughed, and it took everything inside of you to want to hit it. The teasing and laughing, they all were motivators to try and get you to hit the damn ball.</p><p>Without even thinking, you swung the bat at the right moment, hitting the ball with a loud crack. Everyone in the stands, as well as Tony, were shocked, their mouths wide open. Gasping, you looked at your brother with a huge smile.</p><p>\u201cGo, run!\u201d he urged.

They tried to figure out why none of their tests were working on you when they figured out your brain was the key to your survival. It was the one thing keeping you from going darkside.<br></p><p>Years later when you and Bucky found the Avengers, they were impressed with your smarts and wanted you to be their eyes and ears throughout the computer world. They made you feel like you had a family all over again. The one person who made you feel the most welcome was Tony. He was especially impressed with how much you knew about everything, and you told him that your IQ was 187, and you could process 20,000 words a minute. Your brother liked to call you a prodigy, but you knew you got those abilities when HYDRA began testing on you.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Nevertheless, Tony was impressed. You two got along quickly when he kept asking you about the Iron Man suit, letting you help build it or fix it, and Banner would also ask you for your assistance in his lab. Everyone seemed to enjoy having you on their team, but this is not what you expected when you accepted. Brains were the only thing going for you, so when Tony asked you to participate in their weekly game of baseball, you hesitated tremendously. He managed to convince you by telling you that he would give you full access to his database so that you could carry out a project you really wanted to work on.</p><p>Everyone who was up to bat never failed to hit the ball, and since there was so score points available, you got to stay up there for however long you needed. 40 minutes had passed since you first stepped onto the plate, and you hadn\u2019t hit the ball once. When your brother enlisted, you decided to let him do the labor and heavy lifting while you were more comfortable behind a computer screen or a book.</p><p>Your relationship with Tony was a special one, but you never thought he would tease you for this. He was always flirty with you, telling you how much he liked you in a certain kind of clothing or color, always telling you how smart you are, but today was different.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, Tony. We\u2019re all not equipped for games like this,\u201d you sighed when your brother threw the ball back to Tony. He offered to be the catcher, but you knew he only took that position to give you points and hints without anyone knowing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing the best she can!\u201d Bucky called out as Tony got ready to throw it again.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, I\u2019ll go easy on you,\u201d Tony said before tossing the ball instead of throwing it. However, you saw the ball and freaked which caused you to miss it yet again. The billionaire couldn\u2019t help but snicker before that turned into a full-on laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so bad at this!\u201d he continued to laugh. Bucky could sense you were about to cry at the attention you were getting, so he got up and took off his helmet before sending glares at him.</p><p>\u201cApologize right now! You\u2019re not helping anything!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N, I really am. I don\u2019t mean to make fun of you for this. I\u2019ve just never seen someone play so bad at the easiest game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust throw the fucking ball again,\u201d you growled, pushing back the urge to cry. Tony knew this wasn\u2019t going to be a big hit, so he decided to play it slowly once more. When your brother put his helmet back on, he gave you a minute before throwing the ball. As the ball came hurling towards you, you pictured Tony\u2019s face on it as he laughed, and it took everything inside of you to want to hit it. The teasing and laughing, they all were motivators to try and get you to hit the damn ball.</p><p>Without even thinking, you swung the bat at the right moment, hitting the ball with a loud crack. Everyone in the stands, as well as Tony, were shocked, their mouths wide open. Gasping, you looked at your brother with a huge smile.</p><p>\u201cGo, run!\u201d he urged. Taking off running, you kept your eyes on the first base without worrying about the ball. Steve was in the outfield, and he rushed to grab it but missed it by a few inches. There was no way he was going to grab the ball and throw it to first base before you got there. It was a close call, but you slid on your knees to the base and touched it before Wanda could touch you with the ball in her hands.</p><p>\u201cSafe!\u201d she yelled.

Hit the ball!\u201d Tony groaned when you missed it yet again. Being athletic wasn\u2019t something you did. The only reason why you were on the team besides the fact that you were Bucky\u2019s sister, was for your big brain. When HYDR captured your brother, they also took you. As much as they tried, they couldn\u2019t turn you into one of their little experiments. They tried to figure out why none of their tests were working on you when they figured out your brain was the key to your survival. It was the one thing keeping you from going darkside.<br></p><p>Years later when you and Bucky found the Avengers, they were impressed with your smarts and wanted you to be their eyes and ears throughout the computer world. They made you feel like you had a family all over again. The one person who made you feel the most welcome was Tony. He was especially impressed with how much you knew about everything, and you told him that your IQ was 187, and you could process 20,000 words a minute. Your brother liked to call you a prodigy, but you knew you got those abilities when HYDRA began testing on you.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Nevertheless, Tony was impressed. You two got along quickly when he kept asking you about the Iron Man suit, letting you help build it or fix it, and Banner would also ask you for your assistance in his lab. Everyone seemed to enjoy having you on their team, but this is not what you expected when you accepted. Brains were the only thing going for you, so when Tony asked you to participate in their weekly game of baseball, you hesitated tremendously. He managed to convince you by telling you that he would give you full access to his database so that you could carry out a project you really wanted to work on.</p><p>Everyone who was up to bat never failed to hit the ball, and since there was so score points available, you got to stay up there for however long you needed. 40 minutes had passed since you first stepped onto the plate, and you hadn\u2019t hit the ball once. When your brother enlisted, you decided to let him do the labor and heavy lifting while you were more comfortable behind a computer screen or a book.</p><p>Your relationship with Tony was a special one, but you never thought he would tease you for this. He was always flirty with you, telling you how much he liked you in a certain kind of clothing or color, always telling you how smart you are, but today was different.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, Tony. We\u2019re all not equipped for games like this,\u201d you sighed when your brother threw the ball back to Tony. He offered to be the catcher, but you knew he only took that position to give you points and hints without anyone knowing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing the best she can!\u201d Bucky called out as Tony got ready to throw it again.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, I\u2019ll go easy on you,\u201d Tony said before tossing the ball instead of throwing it. However, you saw the ball and freaked which caused you to miss it yet again. The billionaire couldn\u2019t help but snicker before that turned into a full-on laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so bad at this!\u201d he continued to laugh. Bucky could sense you were about to cry at the attention you were getting, so he got up and took off his helmet before sending glares at him.</p><p>\u201cApologize right now! You\u2019re not helping anything!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N, I really am. I don\u2019t mean to make fun of you for this. I\u2019ve just never seen someone play so bad at the easiest game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust throw the fucking ball again,\u201d you growled, pushing back the urge to cry. Tony knew this wasn\u2019t going to be a big hit, so he decided to play it slowly once more. When your brother put his helmet back on, he gave you a minute before throwing the ball. As the ball came hurling towards you, you pictured Tony\u2019s face on it as he laughed, and it took everything inside of you to want to hit it. The teasing and laughing, they all were motivators to try and get you to hit the damn ball.</p><p>Without even thinking, you swung the bat at the right moment, hitting the ball with a loud crack. Everyone in the stands, as well as Tony, were shocked, their mouths wide open. Gasping, you looked at your brother with a huge smile.</p><p>\u201cGo, run!\u201d he urged. Taking off running, you kept your eyes on the first base without worrying about the ball. Steve was in the outfield, and he rushed to grab it but missed it by a few inches. There was no way he was going to grab the ball and throw it to first base before you got there. It was a close call, but you slid on your knees to the base and touched it before Wanda could touch you with the ball in her hands.</p><p>\u201cSafe!\u201d she yelled.

Hit the ball!&rdquo; Tony groaned when you missed it yet again. Being athletic wasn&rsquo;t something you did. The only reason why you were on the team besides the fact that you were Bucky&rsquo;s sister, was for your big brain. When HYDR captured your brother, they also took you. As much as they tried, they couldn&rsquo;t turn you into one of their little experiments. They tried to figure out why none of their tests were working on you when they figured out your brain was the key to your survival. It was the one thing keeping you from going darkside.<br /></p><p>Years later when you and Bucky found the Avengers, they were impressed with your smarts and wanted you to be their eyes and ears throughout the computer world. They made you feel like you had a family all over again. The one person who made you feel the most welcome was Tony. He was especially impressed with how much you knew about everything, and you told him that your IQ was 187, and you could process 20,000 words a minute. Your brother liked to call you a prodigy, but you knew you got those abilities when HYDRA began testing on you.</p><p>Nevertheless, Tony was impressed. You two got along quickly when he kept asking you about the Iron Man suit, letting you help build it or fix it, and Banner would also ask you for your assistance in his lab. Everyone seemed to enjoy having you on their team, but this is not what you expected when you accepted. Brains were the only thing going for you, so when Tony asked you to participate in their weekly game of baseball, you hesitated tremendously. He managed to convince you by telling you that he would give you full access to his database so that you could carry out a project you really wanted to work on.</p><p>Everyone who was up to bat never failed to hit the ball, and since there was so score points available, you got to stay up there for however long you needed. 40 minutes had passed since you first stepped onto the plate, and you hadn&rsquo;t hit the ball once. When your brother enlisted, you decided to let him do the labor and heavy lifting while you were more comfortable behind a computer screen or a book.</p><p>Your relationship with Tony was a special one, but you never thought he would tease you for this. He was always flirty with you, telling you how much he liked you in a certain kind of clothing or color, always telling you how smart you are, but today was different.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying, Tony. We&rsquo;re all not equipped for games like this,&rdquo; you sighed when your brother threw the ball back to Tony. He offered to be the catcher, but you knew he only took that position to give you points and hints without anyone knowing.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing the best she can!&rdquo; Bucky called out as Tony got ready to throw it again.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, fine, I&rsquo;ll go easy on you,&rdquo; Tony said before tossing the ball instead of throwing it. However, you saw the ball and freaked which caused you to miss it yet again. The billionaire couldn&rsquo;t help but snicker before that turned into a full-on laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so bad at this!&rdquo; he continued to laugh. Bucky could sense you were about to cry at the attention you were getting, so he got up and took off his helmet before sending glares at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Apologize right now! You&rsquo;re not helping anything!&rdquo; he yelled.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Y/N, I really am. I don&rsquo;t mean to make fun of you for this. I&rsquo;ve just never seen someone play so bad at the easiest game!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just throw the fucking ball again,&rdquo; you growled, pushing back the urge to cry. Tony knew this wasn&rsquo;t going to be a big hit, so he decided to play it slowly once more. When your brother put his helmet back on, he gave you a minute before throwing the ball. As the ball came hurling towards you, you pictured Tony&rsquo;s face on it as he laughed, and it took everything inside of you to want to hit it. The teasing and laughing, they all were motivators to try and get you to hit the damn ball.</p><p>Without even thinking, you swung the bat at the right moment, hitting the ball with a loud crack. Everyone in the stands, as well as Tony, were shocked, their mouths wide open. Gasping, you looked at your brother with a huge smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Go, run!&rdquo; he urged. Taking off running, you kept your eyes on the first base without worrying about the ball. Steve was in the outfield, and he rushed to grab it but missed it by a few inches. There was no way he was going to grab the ball and throw it to first base before you got there. It was a close call, but you slid on your knees to the base and touched it before Wanda could touch you with the ball in her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; she yelled. Grinning, you got up and stuck your tongue out at Tony for being so mean to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you, Stark! I can be athletic!&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9eff204dc52649425d7960721f7c8171/tumblr_inline_ptf0hz6slR1tw697t_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>If you want to be tagged, add yourself to <b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1loroENIL02JGGewSW98VZtyN9KafcYFdhYcLat6MPHQ%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&amp;t=MGFlYjI1MTFkYTQwMjc3ODA5ZjJlMGZlMzIxNjRjYjliYWZkYjRiNyxUbjFUTWx3YQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AfQpgf-Pc8j8gQyXeP5Nx8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fqueen-of-the-avengers.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F175535300947%2Fdealing-with-the-big-problems\">this document</a>! </b>If your tag doesn&rsquo;t work,<b> <b><a href=\"https://queen-of-deans-booty.tumblr.com/post/168949327179/no-mention-zone-tumblr\">find out why</a>!</b></b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDpk9mxC3Vgp2KzH4hBUpuQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDpk9mxC3Vgp2KzH4hBUpuQ\">@likiyoshi-lijie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCYBx_h35wOHSanz-KWYkSA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCYBx_h35wOHSanz-KWYkSA\">@gh0stgurl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdqJ3syPOMR3iOJOiNK9NCQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdqJ3syPOMR3iOJOiNK9NCQ\">@until-theend-oftheline</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWUBifNx_ALnyYf8QCGl6iw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWUBifNx_ALnyYf8QCGl6iw\">@2dreamcatcher8</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzINLfv17mQRDzuIowmuaA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzINLfv17mQRDzuIowmuaA\">@thisismysecrethappyplace</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAIE1bga0MiuOO7zD8AapaQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAIE1bga0MiuOO7zD8AapaQ\">@paintballkid711</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbtHTeE3_XqmFwNeHpBWuWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbtHTeE3_XqmFwNeHpBWuWQ\">@linkpk88</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt0NDolFnGpUbdpRp-oLMzw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt0NDolFnGpUbdpRp-oLMzw\">@vvishous</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPmSaWtNBYURkXYyTE4SQkQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPmSaWtNBYURkXYyTE4SQkQ\">@bemyqueenofdarkness</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6Il-apMbZXtrCjcwn6WzfQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6Il-apMbZXtrCjcwn6WzfQ\">@wittysunflower</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvnpbr0FaZJZ_2Yegj-CqQA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvnpbr0FaZJZ_2Yegj-CqQA\">@thejourneyneverendsx</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvp3BCrPWMwU2LPiWe4uHPQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvp3BCrPWMwU2LPiWe4uHPQ\">@cutelittlepurplesouls</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5U_u9GKDf0_WMKwI1CjkQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5U_u9GKDf0_WMKwI1CjkQ\">@feelmyroarrrr</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\">@jointhehunt67</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB1mtlcXR1DSj6i8V_2-9uw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB1mtlcXR1DSj6i8V_2-9uw\">@rayvenrider</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkDfcQ0-g2bBphYR6LZA8pA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkDfcQ0-g2bBphYR6LZA8pA\">@xxloki81xx</a>  &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVIjDeqbeldSeiZd2oLMTFA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVIjDeqbeldSeiZd2oLMTFA\">@fandomgirl17</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_O7eLBRNaAt7aaOLVrBX3w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_O7eLBRNaAt7aaOLVrBX3w\">@ironmandeficiency</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHq62L049STfdlTXHEJk0lA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHq62L049STfdlTXHEJk0lA\">@ivvitm1109</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mte4aYh4BCFhSdnNIECKQAg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mte4aYh4BCFhSdnNIECKQAg\">@kendall-michele</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq79fl6uHP0Ayz65mPxhdAQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq79fl6uHP0Ayz65mPxhdAQ\">@niall2017</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrXIpJO9dREEMnm0CDm8TjA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrXIpJO9dREEMnm0CDm8TjA\">@schwankyblock</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vV9Tri3x7cdvHjM9IL-5w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vV9Tri3x7cdvHjM9IL-5w\">@mackevanstanfan80</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKDwbu6idiycGZPI41sQ31g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKDwbu6idiycGZPI41sQ31g\">@fuckthatfeeling</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJp1hVuE-ruMYnLeUvhioLg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJp1hVuE-ruMYnLeUvhioLg\">@tardis-is-mine</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhq72MIcEjvxGR30ZHPmvgQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhq72MIcEjvxGR30ZHPmvgQ\">@kpoplover1306-depressedgirl315</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mE8PwfHGgQjGLK0cjfOpThA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mE8PwfHGgQjGLK0cjfOpThA\">@notyourtypicalrose</a> </p>",

Until one night Tony Stark himself shows up at your door, saying he needs your help.</p><p><b>A/N:</b> My first Tony fic ahhhhh! I really hope you guys enjoy it, and please let me know what you think! I already have another one-shot idea, so feedback will help me know if you want it! :)</p><p><br/></p><p>It had been a month since you&rsquo;d officially left your job at Stark Industries. A whole month and you still missed it and the work you did there, low level as you were. But staying there hadn&rsquo;t been a possibility either. </p><p>It had started a few months before. One of your coworkers in your lab decided he fancied you and refused to accept you didn&rsquo;t like him in return. It hadn&rsquo;t been too bad at first, annoying but not that bad. Mostly just him asking you out every few days, a few inappropriate comments about your looks here and there, but not enough for you to want to raise any issues. But then your lab threw a party for another colleague&rsquo;s birthday, complete with alcohol. </p><p>He&rsquo;d had too much and followed you into the bathroom. Cornering you in one of the stalls, he&rsquo;d refused to move or stop with the remarks about how much he wanted you and how tired he was off waiting. </p><p>Nothing happened in the end. Someone else came in and spooked him away. But it was more than you could handle. More than you should have had to handle. So you&rsquo;d filed a complaint with your supervisor. Who promptly dismissed it since he hadn&rsquo;t actually done anything. </p><p>You took it higher again to the floor manager. He called you in for a meeting, and later that day you handed in your resignation. He&rsquo;d been even worse than the others, and any thoughts about going higher again disappeared. It wasn&rsquo;t worth the stress or the shitty way it made you feel. </p><p>You&rsquo;d worked your notice and left. </p><p>Now you just needed to find a new job. Which was surprisingly harder than you&rsquo;d anticipated. Most hadn&rsquo;t even called you back. Why you didn&rsquo;t know. You were plenty qualified, and it was hard to get better previous experience than working at Stark Industries. </p><p>Sprawled on the sofa in your apartment, you scrolled through potential jobs on your tablet. The savings in your bank were starting to dwindle, and you were faced with the choice of looking for a lesser job or leaving New York altogether. You didn&rsquo;t want either. You&rsquo;d worked hard to get to New York, but you didn&rsquo;t want to get stuck at a job you hated either. </p><p>A knock on your door startled you from your miserable dwelling. You were tempted to ignore it, but then the person on the other side knocked again, and curiosity got the better of you. Who would come knocking at eight on a Thursday night? </p><p>Apparently Tony fucking Stark would.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Y/N Y/L/N?&rdquo; He asked, pocketing his sunglasses once you opened the door. </p><p>For an MIT graduate with two doctorates to your name, it took your brain an embarrassingly long time time to process what was going on and form actual words. &ldquo;Uhh&hellip;yeah. Yes. Sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great! Need to talk to you. May I?&rdquo; Stark gestured to the inside of your apartment. </p><p>You nodded dumbly, stepping aside to let him in. &ldquo;C-can I get you something to drink, sir?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, thanks. I can&rsquo;t stay too long,&rdquo; he said, taking a look around him. It was the first time you&rsquo;d really realized what a mess the whole place was. There were pieces of paper with notes and calculations for random things pinned up everywhere, covering most of the wall space. Then there were the couple of take-out cartons you hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to recycling yet, and the pile of thankfully clean laundry, that was stacked on a chair waiting to get put away. Stark didn&rsquo;t seem bothered by any of it though, but then he seemed more focused on the papers anyway. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to the point,&rdquo; he said, turning to face you again. &ldquo;You left my company and I&rsquo;m here to get you back.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;d been no time to really consider why he was here, but you knew for certain that wouldn&rsquo;t have even made the list. &ldquo;You want me back?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Stark pulled his phone from his pocket and tapped a couple buttons before showing you the screen. You recognized the blueprint on it immediately. &ldquo;Your design right?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I submitted it just before I left.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good. Amazing, really. I was stunned when I came across it. A little embarrassed I hadn&rsquo;t thought to use Iron Man tech like that, but that&rsquo;s just between you and me.&rdquo; Stark winked at you, switching off the screen again. &ldquo;I made it a research priority, something like this needs to be out there, but no one&rsquo;s been able to figure out how to fit that amount of tech into something so small. I&rsquo;ve had some ideas, but none have looked promising for long term viability.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you want to know if I know how to do it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;In theory. I&rsquo;ve not run any simulations.&rdquo;</p><p>Stark nodded. &ldquo;Theory is more than anyone else has come up with. Next question, what&rsquo;ll it take for you to come back? More money? Apartment upgrade? Name it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t leave because I wasn&rsquo;t earning enough, or anything like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why did you?&rdquo; </p><p>You bit the inside of your cheek, wondering what you should say. Stark was being overwhelmingly complimentary, but that didn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;d stay that way. He was another man after all. &ldquo;The people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The people? Gonna have to elaborate there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably be easier to pull the audio recording of Office 3A from February eighteenth. I was in a meeting with Pete and explained everything.&rdquo; It was the best solution you could think of. You didn&rsquo;t want to talk through everything again, and if he heard it himself at least he&rsquo;d believe you. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Jarvis, locate audio file of Peter Jamesons office on February eighteenth, 2019.&rdquo; Stark spoke into his phone, which was pretty unexpected. </p><p><i>Audio file found. Would you like to listen to the playback from a specific time?</i></p><p>Stark looked towards you, holding the phone forwards in a gesture to speak. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, 1 pm?&rdquo; </p><p><i>Playing Office 3A audio from 1 pm</i></p><p>You were expecting it, but it still gave you a shock when your own voice and that of Peter&rsquo;s, the floor managers, started to speak from Starks phone.</p><p>Most of it was you retelling your story about the coworker and the bathroom, and then your supervisor&rsquo;s dismissal of it.</p><p><i>&ldquo;What were you wearing?&rdquo; Pete asked.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;At the party, what were you wearing?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&hellip;it was straight after work. It was similar to this.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, those pants are very form fitting. And that shirt could be revealing if you were to bend over enough.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sir, are you saying I asked for it?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Not ask. But perhaps subconsciously you thought to invite it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I can promise you that wasn&rsquo;t the case.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Either way, you should&rsquo;ve expected something like this to happen.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&hellip;I should have?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a woman and this is a male-dominated environment. Of course, you should&rsquo;ve expected romantic advances.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not appropriate.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The truth isn&rsquo;t appropriate? Sweetheart, if you wanted to avoid this bother then you should&rsquo;ve stayed at home. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d exceed phenomenally in a kitchen.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m exceeding here.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you? Or did you get the job because of some diversity laws?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I got the job because I was the top of all my classes, earned two PhDs in some of the most difficult subjects and am one of the best in my field!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No need to get emotional. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re plenty smart. Just not smart enough to understand the natural way of things.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I take this means you&rsquo;re dismissing my complaint?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Doctor Grant did nothing wrong in my eyes, Ms. Y/L/N.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Fine. Then I want to take it higher.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Higher? I wouldn&rsquo;t advise that.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The ones higher don&rsquo;t like to be bothered with such trivial matters. They won&rsquo;t be happy telling you the same thing you&rsquo;ve been told twice already. Might not end well for you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you suggesting I&rsquo;ll be fired for reporting a case of harassment?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not suggesting anything, Ms.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;d thank you for your time, but I don&rsquo;t want to. You&rsquo;ll have my resignation by the end of the day.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; you said quietly when you heard the sound of a door closing, signaling that you left the office, and Jarvis stopped the recording.</p><p>Tony hadn&rsquo;t spoken a word as you listened, but his face said enough. He was angry, quiet but furious.</p><p>Sir, would you like me to inform Miss. Potts over this issue?</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going to deal with this personally. We&rsquo;ll discuss it later, Jarvis.&rdquo;</p><p>Yes, sir.</p><p>Stark tucked his phone away and looked back at you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. You shouldn&rsquo;t have had to deal with that.&rdquo;</p><p>Crossing your arms over your chest, you shrugged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not. We&rsquo;re meant to be making the world a better place, and we can&rsquo;t do that if our own employees get away with this shit. It&rsquo;s gonna be dealt with, I promise.*</p><p>&quot;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>Stark waved his hand through the air. &ldquo;Stop with the &lsquo;sir&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled and nodded. &ldquo;Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s watch chimed and he muttered under his breath. &ldquo;I need to go, but I&rsquo;m not done with you or your work. I want you back working for me. With me. Are you free, say tomorrow night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Only thing I had planned was more job hunting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s unnecessary now. What do you say to coming over and talking final details? All totally professional of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds great. I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Awesome! I&rsquo;ll send someone to get you around six?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grinned, heading to the door before stopping and gesturing to all the papers on your walls. &ldquo;Are all these for your blueprint?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Most. Some are just notes of other ideas. Easier to write them down and get them out of my head, y'know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do. Bring them with you. All of them. I want to know what else goes through that brilliant head of yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. See you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See you.&rdquo;</p><p>With that he was gone, leaving you wondering what the hell had really just happened. Tony Stark had been in your home, admitted the shit that was going on his own company, promised to fix it, then invited you to an informal business meeting. And what did he mean by working with him?</p><p>The only things you knew for sure were that you&rsquo;d happily to return to work at Stark Industries in whatever capacity if you were taken seriously and that you were definitely excited for the next night.</p><p>~</p><p>The rest of your night was spent pulling down all your notes and trying to put them in some kind of order. By the time you&rsquo;d actually made it your bed, it well into the early am, and by the time you woke up again, it was into the later am.</p><p>You were a modern, 21st-century woman, so of course, the first thing you did was grab your phone to check everything that was going on.</p><p>Stark Industries was trending.</p><p>Tony Stark himself had issued a statement barely an hour ago, stating that it had come to his attention that several members of staff were responsible for acts of gross misconduct. He went on to say that not only had said staff been removed from the company, an internal investigation was also being launched in order to root out any other bad seeds, and completely overhaul the way complaints and issues were raised and dealt with.</p><p>He&rsquo;d said he was going to deal with it, but this, this you hadn&rsquo;t expected. Not this fast and not at this scale. It was satisfying to know you&rsquo;d finally been taken seriously.</p><p>It was a good way to start the day.</p><p>The time went by quick. Most of it was spent catching up on chores and doing a final sort through of your notes. By the time it came to get ready, you were surprisingly not nervous. You should&rsquo;ve been, you thought. You were spending the evening with Tony Stark. It was just business, he said that himself, but it was still Tony Stark, and it was still one on one. Yet you weren&rsquo;t. For whatever reason, you felt at ease around him, and the only thing you felt was excitement.</p><p>You kept your clothes to business casual, not wanting to overdo it, but not wanting to look like you didn&rsquo;t care either.</p><p>Dead on six, there was a knock on your door, and sure enough, a driver was waiting to take you to Tony.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t that long a ride before you were stepping inside his living space at Stark Tower.</p><p><i>Welcome Dr. Y/L/N. Mr. Stark is currently downstairs in his lab, but he&rsquo;ll be up momentarily. Please, take a seat and make yourself comfortable. </i></p><p>The voice nearly made you jump out of your skin. It was the same one that spoke out of Tony&rsquo;s phone yesterday.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; you said, taking a moment to look around as you walked. &ldquo;Who\u2026who are you?&rsquo;</p><p><i>My name is Jarvis. A UI Mr. Stark created to run several aspects of his business and life. If I can be of assistance to you at any point, please do not hesitate to ask.</i></p><p>&quot;Right, thank you.&rdquo; You&rsquo;d figured out you were talking to a computer, but it was still a shock to talk to one that came across so\u2026human.</p><p>You walked into the main living area, setting your bag of notes down on the sofa. There was a pizza box sitting on the table, the brand familiar. It was the same name that was on the empty box in your kitchen yesterday. It wasn&rsquo;t all that expensive though, so the chances of someone like Tony buying it himself were slim. Which meant he&rsquo;d seen it and taken note.</p><p>It was a nice thought.</p><p>Wandering over to the window, you looked out across the city. It was dark by now, and the lights of New York were shining and twinkling below you.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a bad view, huh?&rdquo; Tony came up next to you, looking out the window too.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo; Tony was looking at you as he spoke.</p><p>Turning away from the view, you faced him. &ldquo;I saw what you did this morning. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing to thank. It needed to be done.&rdquo; Tony raised an arm gesturing to the sofa. &ldquo;Have a seat. Drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. Sounds good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me guess&hellip;Jack and coke?&rdquo; Tony walked over the bar, already pulling out two tumblers.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; You sat on the sofa, retrieving your bag and starting to pull out some of your notes. It was surprising how natural it felt being here. It was more like hanging out with a friend than one of the worlds most famous mean who also happened to be fucking Iron Man.</p><p>&ldquo;Lucky guess?&rdquo; You raised an eyebrow and he laughed. &ldquo;There was a bottle of Jack in the kitchen, and an empty can at the top of the trash. Educated guess then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Observant. I like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Count me flattered.&rdquo; Tony brought the two glasses over and set them down onto the table next to the pizza box.</p><p>&ldquo;You frequent tiny pizza places halfway across the city too or just another feat of observation?&rdquo; You asked, picking up one of the glasses and taking a sip. It was good. Tony knew how to mix a drink.</p><p>&ldquo;Point of tonight was to talk you back into working here, figured some creature comforts wouldn&rsquo;t hurt my efforts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty sure it&rsquo;s already safe to say I&rsquo;ll come back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just because of some pizza and liquor? A woman after my own heart.&rdquo;</p><p>Laughing, you matched his position, leaning against the back of the sofa. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a part of it, yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smiled, the look soft on his face. &ldquo;But seriously, you okay? After everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I spent over a decade getting degrees from places filled with men thinking I shouldn&rsquo;t be there. It&rsquo;ll take more than a few dicks to get me. Not worth the time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beats me how they even got hired. We need more staff like you and me, geniuses, not their prehistoric butts.&rdquo;</p><p>Geniuses. Plural. He thought you were on the same level. &ldquo;Flattery will get you everywhere, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; you said, putting on a fake posh voice, mainly to deflect how sincere he was being and how you were definitely not sure how to handle it.</p><p>Tony grinned, &ldquo;Everywhere? You are exceptionally intriguing, Dr. Y/L/N.&rdquo; He mimicked your accent, sounding like a terrible version of Jarvis.</p><p>The gentle moment successfully broken, you laughed again, grateful he&rsquo;d taken the cue instead of pushing it. The compliment had been well received, for sure. In fact, you were pretty sure it was the best compliment you could ever be given. It was the quiet concern that had thrown you. He had been worried that you weren&rsquo;t okay. It was both sweet and unexpected, though maybe it shouldn&rsquo;t have been given the events of the morning.</p><p>Tony reached over and flipped the pizza box open, then motioned to the papers sitting next to you. &ldquo;Shall we start?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded, figuring you&rsquo;d begin with the very reason he&rsquo;d asked you over. The blueprints you&rsquo;d left behind in the lab that no one else could get working. It had been an idea you&rsquo;d had for years, one that was never more than an idealistic fantasy until you&rsquo;d started work at Stark Industries. You&rsquo;d been browsing the blueprints of an older version of the Iron Man suit that Tony had released to the labs, and there staring right back at you was the technology you needed to make your idea become reality. Only problem was that you needed to figure out a way to scale it down to a fraction of the size. You&rsquo;d worked on it every day you were allowed to pursue your own individual tech projects rather than focusing on one&rsquo;s already established within the company.</p><p>You told Tony all about it, explained how exactly you were planning to shrink it down and fit it into the main tech itself. The breakthrough had come just days before you left, and there&rsquo;d been no time to see if it&rsquo;d work for certain, so you&rsquo;d taken the notes home with you, just leaving the main design as the company.</p><p>&ldquo;I can see why no one else came up with this. Even I&rsquo;d need to focus on nothing but it to come up with these solutions.&rdquo; Tony was reading through your notes, looking genuinely amazed. &ldquo;Gotta ask though, why didn&rsquo;t you take the design with you? Your ideas are your own until prototypes start getting made.&rdquo;</p><p>You shrugged, &ldquo;I hoped that leaving it in the databases would mean it&rsquo;d get made one day. And that was all I wanted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Commendable. A lot would&rsquo;ve taken it and tried to make a quick buck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They would. I just want to help people and that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what I want to do too. Which is why I want to give you your own lab, your own team, access to newer Iron Man tech, whatever you need to get this done.&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;d been anticipating a promotion, but not to that level. You didn&rsquo;t even know anyone who ran a lab dedicated to just one project. You&rsquo;d heard of people who ran them, but those were scientists who&rsquo;d been working for the company for years, the best of the best.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, I\u2026I don&rsquo;t even know what to say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How about yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Yes! Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something like this needs to be out there, and I want us to be the one to do it. And I want you to be the one to spearhead it. With things like this I try to be a bit more involved though, so there&rsquo;ll be more stuff like this. Catching up with what&rsquo;s going on one on one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not opposed to that. Especially if there&rsquo;s more pizza involved.&rdquo;.</p><p>Tony threw his head back as he laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll add it into the contract.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case when do I start?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monday work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; Tony clapped his hands together, then grabbed your now empty glasses and went to refill them. &ldquo;To new adventures,&rdquo; he toasted when he returned and passed you the glass back.</p><p>&ldquo;To new adventures.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Feel like telling me what&rsquo;s on the rest of the stuff you bought? Maybe we&rsquo;ll find the next big thing for the future.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doubtful,&rdquo; you chuckled, picking up the notebook you used for general notes and ideas. &ldquo;Most of the stuff in here is just random crap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, sometimes the best things from random crap. Humor me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well since it&rsquo;s you and you did just offer me the job a lifetime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whoever said money can&rsquo;t get you what you want?&rdquo;</p><p>Rolling your eyes with a smile, you grabbed the book and started going through it. A lot of it really was junk, but some, some could maybe turn into something more. Especially if you stayed on in the long run.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t even realize how long you talked about some of the things for. Once you started, you found you couldn&rsquo;t stop, especially when Tony didn&rsquo;t immediately laugh you out of the tower. And it was nice, for once, to get to just talk about all the little things that had popped into your head over the years, rather than focusing on making others ideas a reality.</p><p>When you finally stopped, Tony was silent. Looking up from the book and over to him, you saw him watching you with what could only be described as the human version of the heart eye emoji.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You asked, laughing nervously.</p><p>&ldquo;You really are a genius. This&hellip;this stuff, it&rsquo;s incredible. I have no idea how your brain works to come up with some of this, but I love it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? They&rsquo;re nothing special.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are! God, there are at least five things I can see being not only viable but exceptional, and two I definitely want to look into further because they could make great additions to the next Iron Man upgrade.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Figured I was going to be a one trick pony kinda girl, and the rest of time I&rsquo;d just be backing people up. Group projects and all that stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony had been keeping a respectable distance, but then he slid across the soft material until he was closer to you. He let a hand rest on your forearm, giving you the chance to pull back if you wanted. When you didn&rsquo;t, he smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re incredible. I pulled your file Y/N. I&rsquo;ve seen just how smart you are. You were the best person in that lab hands down, no one else even came close.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled. &ldquo;Thanks. Maybe those dicks did get to me a little.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Screw 'em. If they ever see you again they&rsquo;ll be calling you ma&rsquo; am and begging for some cash to fund some crummy little project, and you&rsquo;ll get the satisfaction of telling them they should go back home to their kitchen.&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t intentional, but you snorted a laugh at that. &ldquo;That would be exceptionally satisfying actually. The look on their faces\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See? Now you have another goal to work towards. One I&rsquo;ll happily help you with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How thoughtful,&rdquo; you grinned, starting to pick up all the papers that had been scattered about throughout the evening. A photo slipped out of the back of the notebook, falling to the ground.</p><p>Tony got to it before you did, picking it up and flipping it over to look at the picture. &ldquo;This you?&rdquo; he asked, gesturing to the little kid in the photo, proudly holding up a robot. Behind the kid was a grown-up woman, holding a large ribbon with a 1 in the center, looking like she couldn&rsquo;t be any prouder.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s me, and that&rsquo;s my Mom. I&rsquo;d just won a local robotics competition. Dad said I was too young to enter, but I wanted to go, so she took me anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your mom sounds pretty special.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is. She always encouraged me when things seemed like too much. And she&rsquo;s the reason why I came up with the band.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. When I was doing my first thesis, she had a health scare. She&rsquo;d been complaining of problems for months, but no one took her seriously, and by the time she was, it was almost too late. She&rsquo;s fine now, but if she&rsquo;d had the band-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten that far.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony handed you the photo and squeezed your hand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to stop shit like that from happening, I promise.*</p><p>&quot;Damn right we are.&rdquo; You looked down at the photo for a few seconds, making a note to call her in the morning to tell her all the news. She&rsquo;d been worried when you quit, but never once blamed you. To find out now that you&rsquo;d be heading a team and working with Tony would make her whole year.</p><p>She&rsquo;d like Tony. You already knew she&rsquo;d try to push the two of you together, especially since you both seemed to think so much alike. After spending the evening with him you wouldn&rsquo;t be opposed. Tony was interested in you that you were sure of. And compared to how you&rsquo;d felt when the other guy had made advances, it was totally different now. Whereas he had no concept of boundaries or even what the word 'no&rsquo; meant, it wasn&rsquo;t like that with Tony. You trusted he&rsquo;d respect whatever boundaries you set up, professional or otherwise without even thinking twice about it. You were comfortable around him too. It had been some time since you&rsquo;d felt so at ease and happy.</p><p>So, yeah, you were maybe definitely interested in Tony too.</p><p>Why wait for your Mom to get involved then?</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a hell of a cook too. When I won she offered to take me out somewhere to eat, but all I wanted was some of her grilled cheese and a piece of her apple pie. Actually made sure I brought a book of her recipes with me when I moved here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God, it&rsquo;s been forever since I&rsquo;ve had a Mom-approved meal. Always something special about the recipes, y'know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do. I was actually planning on making something of hers tomorrow. Won&rsquo;t be as good as her making it herself, but I&rsquo;m not bad. You could come try some if you wanted.&rdquo; Wow. Smooth.</p><p>Tony looked at you, eyebrows raised and an amused smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to, but doesn&rsquo;t very professional.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t really meant to be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fair enough. What time should I bring the wine?&rdquo;</p><p>Huffing a small sigh of relief, you matched his smile. &ldquo;Say seven?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there on the dot.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p><b>1 Year Later </b></p><p>Tony was up on stage, commanding the attention of journalists and experts, and who knew what else. You&rsquo;d left the arrangements of who to invite to those who actually knew what they were doing. You were too busy focusing on not throwing up.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine, love,&rdquo; your Mom was next to you, holding your hand in hers reassuringly. You needed to thank Tony again later for flying her in as a surprise for tonight.</p><p>&ldquo;What if I mess up? Tony&rsquo;s poured so much into this\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t. You have your speech on your tablet thing don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Yeah, it&rsquo;s all written down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll have no problem. This is what you&rsquo;ve been waiting for, I know you&rsquo;ll be amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now for why we&rsquo;re all here. The big reveal! Exciting! We&rsquo;ve all had fitness trackers, right? Little bands on our wrists that tell us how many steps we&rsquo;ve taken or what our heart rate is, but what if those bands could do more? What if they could tell us everything about our health? What if they could test our blood and scan us while we slept and spotted any anomalies? What if we could do away with expensive tests and long waiting times, and have all health updates uploaded straight to your patient file? Well, ladies and gents, I&rsquo;m here to tell you that we&rsquo;re no longer in a world of 'what-ifs&rsquo;. That time is now. Stark Industries is proud to announce a new step forward in health care. Introducing, Sanus.&rdquo;</p><p>On the stage, Tony finished his opening speech and stepped to one side as the introductory advert for your wrist band played to the crowd.</p><p>It was impossible to tell what the initial reaction was, but there was applause when it came to an end that sounded promising.</p><p>&ldquo;Fantastic, huh?&rdquo; Tony said as he walked back out to the center of the stage. &ldquo;Iron Man technology adapted so everyone can carry it around on their wrists. Say goodbye to self-diagnosing, or worrying that a random symptom could be more. Concerned one thing could be the start of something more? Sanus can check it out and ease your mind. Or if, there if there is something, let you and your Doctor know so you can work together to get you better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ever think that maybe you&rsquo;re being overlooked? Know in your gut you&rsquo;re sick but can&rsquo;t find anyone to take you seriously? Now you have the tool to find that evidence and get the diagnosis you need and the treatment you deserve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sanus is cost-effective and easy to use. You can communicate by voice or with just a few taps on the app it comes with. And don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s perfectly secure. Only you and you alone can dictate who has access to your information and if you want a person removed? Just tell Sanus and they&rsquo;ll be gone in seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re wondering how this is possible. After all the Iron Man suit is a lot bigger than this nifty little band. I&rsquo;d love to take the credit for it all, I really would. But this feat of ingenuity was not down to me. I&rsquo;d like to introduce you to the person capable of such brilliance though. Here to explain all the geeky techy bits about how everything works, please welcome Doctor Y/N Y/L/N.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gestured towards you as the crowd applauded again and your Mom squeezed your hand a final time before letting you go to walk onto the stage. Tony met you in the middle, an arm coming behind you to guide you to the podium that was rising up.</p><p>'You got this&rsquo; he mouthed with a grin and a wink, joining in with the applause as he took a few steps back.</p><p>Setting your tablet down, you looked out across the crowd. You couldn&rsquo;t make out anyone, the bright lights of the stage blocking them all out. You could hear them though as the clapping came to a stop. The clicks of cameras and the shuffling of feet. So many years of brainstorming and scrapping calculations to get something close to a valid idea. And now you were here, introducing it to the world and explaining everything. No time to fuck up now.</p><p>You started talking, continuously glancing down at speech in front of you at first. Yet as you went on, your confidence grew, and you found yourself looking down less and less, the words coming with ease. You spoke of where the idea came from, the work you&rsquo;d put in to make it viable, Tony&rsquo;s help and encouragement. Everything. Plenty probably wouldn&rsquo;t understand the finer details, but plenty would too.</p><p>There was a third round of applause when you were done, led by Tony who came back over to join you. The lights dimmed a little just enough for you to be able to make out some of the people. There were hundreds, if not over a thousand people watching.</p><p>Tony opened up the floor to questions of which there were plenty, and together you managed to get through them. Having him next to you bolstered your confidence further. It was contagious. That and the positive excitement was exhilarating. To see so many people wanting to know more about your own creation\u2026</p><p>You exited the stage together, Tony taking your hand as you descended the few steps. It wasn&rsquo;t needed, but it was welcome.</p><p>Tony caught you by surprise, pulling you close and picking you up from the floor, spinning you both around. &ldquo;You killed it, babe!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have done it without you, old man,&rdquo; you laughed when he set you down.</p><p>&ldquo;Less of the old, please!&rdquo; Tony grabbed you by the waist before you could get away, ignoring your squawk of protest as he held on tight. &ldquo;Say sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Make me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At least wait until you&rsquo;re somewhere private the both of you.&rdquo; Your mom appeared, and Tony let you go so you could go to her and hug her. &ldquo;You were amazing, sweetheart. I&rsquo;m proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mom.&rdquo;</p><p>She kissed your cheek and pulled back. &ldquo;You two should home and celebrate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could come with us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah. Too late for me. I&rsquo;m going back to the hotel for some sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have Happy drive you, Mrs. Y/L/N,&rdquo; Tony said, slipping his arm around your waist again.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, son. I&rsquo;ll see you both for lunch tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Course. Night, Mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; She kissed your cheek again, and then Tony&rsquo;s before grabbing her things and leaving.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for bringing her out here,&rdquo; you smiled, wrapping your arms around Tony&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;She needed to be here for tonight.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s hands settled on your hips as he leaned in for a kiss. &ldquo;What do you feel like doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we head to the after party thing Pepper&rsquo;s putting on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah. She knows me well enough not to expect me.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed. &ldquo;You make an excellent point, Mr. Stark. What d'you say we head home and have our own private party then?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grinned, &ldquo;I like the way you think, Dr. Y/L/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like? Not love?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love too. Definitely, love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>Together you started to make your way to the quiet exit that had been set aside, hand in hand. &ldquo;Have I told you yet how good you look in that outfit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, but you can show me what you think when we get home.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony opened the car door and followed you inside. &ldquo;God, I really do love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tagging: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF71hfhHEtE-O_-TMp9vPcg\" target=\"_blank\">@medicatemedrmccoy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXaDHpHMy0K39hd6MSlaRig\" target=\"_blank\">@thefanficfaerie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRCGtcrdAjAQWHH8wbalOw\" target=\"_blank\">@sidskywrote</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUQ8uRajg_cCooNltZ66TUg\" target=\"_blank\">@star-trekkin-across-theuniverse</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5U_u9GKDf0_WMKwI1CjkQ\" target=\"_blank\">@feelmyroarrrr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDTjUsNHMkwS8_QZ_5CSNzA\" target=\"_blank\">@ironwinterhawk</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpl5mIi4heCIbzdA984sAhg\" target=\"_blank\">@weasleyisourjedi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNLNsVwPe9B9L0t5skhE6_Q\" target=\"_blank\">@ketchavies-thoorrrr666</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTcYrJNoBbgZ1AP-UpWNfoQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nishanki1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gB-qc4i4kmz68r0WioGkw\" target=\"_blank\">@biglouche</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0eusIrNkdOM1Uqp-0qI5uw\" target=\"_blank\">@stephn-prkr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlfbP0dov72ynqmpGE7OBGA\" target=\"_blank\">@teddybluesclues</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7CsHBGCX8RYJgYJ4m3WnHQ\" target=\"_blank\">@wildefire</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAOZA_cBpLE5dXme-HS8Mfw\" target=\"_blank\">@magnetosgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMBhbyeirqdGDuFzAjCs31g\" target=\"_blank\">@bolontiku</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\" target=\"_blank\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH4ETjHt_Z1V1VA02FIyAQg\" target=\"_blank\">@saphirepearl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzEJqCW1j6ZBjCaheI0fTNw\" target=\"_blank\">@1d-killed-me</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBvPZvsc4FHgzYHQ5u5Bw5A\" target=\"_blank\">@akxra-amxn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7YoIKztmyr4NJk0Y7_CNXw\" target=\"_blank\">@sleep-i-ness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfm8Zt1szg9DaF2KS8-TYeQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thoughtfulllamaoperatoralien</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m44fkKk8XaRIOLxQV-4swwA\" target=\"_blank\">@suzen23smith</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX1fiwIGDMWTzeSU4b1Llow\" target=\"_blank\">@arromite</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLmxhACum2ZZjXo9i_69gJw\" target=\"_blank\">@valiisi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUVoioJqQCpfzOr_DeoBFAQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starmission</a>\u00a0\u00a0</p>",

Who would come knocking at eight on a Thursday night? </p><p>Apparently Tony fucking Stark would.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cY/N Y/L/N?\u201d He asked, pocketing his sunglasses once you opened the door. </p><p>For an MIT graduate with two doctorates to your name, it took your brain an embarrassingly long time time to process what was going on and form actual words. \u201cUhh\u2026yeah. Yes. Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! Need to talk to you. May I?\u201d Stark gestured to the inside of your apartment. </p><p>You nodded dumbly, stepping aside to let him in. \u201cC-can I get you something to drink, sir?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I can\u2019t stay too long,\u201d he said, taking a look around him. It was the first time you\u2019d really realized what a mess the whole place was. There were pieces of paper with notes and calculations for random things pinned up everywhere, covering most of the wall space. Then there were the couple of take-out cartons you hadn\u2019t gotten around to recycling yet, and the pile of thankfully clean laundry, that was stacked on a chair waiting to get put away. Stark didn\u2019t seem bothered by any of it though, but then he seemed more focused on the papers anyway. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to the point,\u201d he said, turning to face you again. \u201cYou left my company and I\u2019m here to get you back.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been no time to really consider why he was here, but you knew for certain that wouldn\u2019t have even made the list. \u201cYou want me back?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Stark pulled his phone from his pocket and tapped a couple buttons before showing you the screen. You recognized the blueprint on it immediately. \u201cYour design right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I submitted it just before I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. Amazing, really. I was stunned when I came across it. A little embarrassed I hadn\u2019t thought to use Iron Man tech like that, but that\u2019s just between you and me.\u201d Stark winked at you, switching off the screen again. \u201cI made it a research priority, something like this needs to be out there, but no one\u2019s been able to figure out how to fit that amount of tech into something so small. I\u2019ve had some ideas, but none have looked promising for long term viability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to know if I know how to do it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn theory. I\u2019ve not run any simulations.\u201d</p><p>Stark nodded. \u201cTheory is more than anyone else has come up with. Next question, what\u2019ll it take for you to come back? More money? Apartment upgrade? Name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir\u2026I didn\u2019t leave because I wasn\u2019t earning enough, or anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you?\u201d </p><p>You bit the inside of your cheek, wondering what you should say. Stark was being overwhelmingly complimentary, but that didn\u2019t mean it\u2019d stay that way. He was another man after all. \u201cThe people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people? Gonna have to elaborate there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably be easier to pull the audio recording of Office 3A from February eighteenth. I was in a meeting with Pete and explained everything.\u201d It was the best solution you could think of. You didn\u2019t want to talk through everything again, and if he heard it himself at least he\u2019d believe you. </p><p>\u201cOkay. Jarvis, locate audio file of Peter Jamesons office on February eighteenth, 2019.\u201d Stark spoke into his phone, which was pretty unexpected. </p><p><i>Audio file found. Would you like to listen to the playback from a specific time?</i></p><p>Stark looked towards you, holding the phone forwards in a gesture to speak. </p><p>\u201cUh, 1 pm?\u201d </p><p><i>Playing Office 3A audio from 1 pm</i></p><p>You were expecting it, but it still gave you a shock when your own voice and that of Peter\u2019s, the floor managers, started to speak from Starks phone.</p><p>Most of it was you retelling your story about the coworker and the bathroom, and then your supervisor\u2019s dismissal of it.</p><p><i>\u201cWhat were you wearing?\u201d Pete asked.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAt the party, what were you wearing?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026it was straight after work. It was similar to this.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, those pants are very form fitting. And that shirt could be revealing if you were to bend over enough.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSir, are you saying I asked for it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot ask. But perhaps subconsciously you thought to invite it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can promise you that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cEither way, you should\u2019ve expected something like this to happen.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026I should have?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re a woman and this is a male-dominated environment. Of course, you should\u2019ve expected romantic advances.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe truth isn\u2019t appropriate? Sweetheart, if you wanted to avoid this bother then you should\u2019ve stayed at home. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d exceed phenomenally in a kitchen.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m exceeding here.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you? Or did you get the job because of some diversity laws?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI got the job because I was the top of all my classes, earned two PhDs in some of the most difficult subjects and am one of the best in my field!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo need to get emotional. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re plenty smart. Just not smart enough to understand the natural way of things.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI take this means you\u2019re dismissing my complaint?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDoctor Grant did nothing wrong in my eyes, Ms. Y/L/N.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine. Then I want to take it higher.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHigher? I wouldn\u2019t advise that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe ones higher don\u2019t like to be bothered with such trivial matters. They won\u2019t be happy telling you the same thing you\u2019ve been told twice already. Might not end well for you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you suggesting I\u2019ll be fired for reporting a case of harassment?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting anything, Ms.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay. I\u2019d thank you for your time, but I don\u2019t want to. You\u2019ll have my resignation by the end of the day.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d you said quietly when you heard the sound of a door closing, signaling that you left the office, and Jarvis stopped the recording.</p><p>Tony hadn\u2019t spoken a word as you listened, but his face said enough. He was angry, quiet but furious.</p><p>Sir, would you like me to inform Miss. Potts over this issue?</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to deal with this personally. We\u2019ll discuss it later, Jarvis.\u201d</p><p>Yes, sir.</p><p>Stark tucked his phone away and looked back at you. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You shouldn\u2019t have had to deal with that.\u201d</p><p>Crossing your arms over your chest, you shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. We\u2019re meant to be making the world a better place, and we can\u2019t do that if our own employees get away with this shit. It\u2019s gonna be dealt with, I promise.*</p><p>\"Thank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Stark waved his hand through the air. \u201cStop with the \u2018sir\u2019. It\u2019s Tony.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and nodded. \u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Tony\u2019s watch chimed and he muttered under his breath. \u201cI need to go, but I\u2019m not done with you or your work. I want you back working for me. With me. Are you free, say tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Only thing I had planned was more job hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s unnecessary now. What do you say to coming over and talking final details? All totally professional of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome! I\u2019ll send someone to get you around six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned, heading to the door before stopping and gesturing to all the papers on your walls. \u201cAre all these for your blueprint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost. Some are just notes of other ideas. Easier to write them down and get them out of my head, y'know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Bring them with you. All of them. I want to know what else goes through that brilliant head of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you.\u201d</p><p>With that he was gone, leaving you wondering what the hell had really just happened. Tony Stark had been in your home, admitted the shit that was going on his own company, promised to fix it, then invited you to an informal business meeting. And what did he mean by working with him?</p><p>The only things you knew for sure were that you\u2019d happily to return to work at Stark Industries in whatever capacity if you were taken seriously and that you were definitely excited for the next night.</p><p>~</p><p>The rest of your night was spent pulling down all your notes and trying to put them in some kind of order. By the time you\u2019d actually made it your bed, it well into the early am, and by the time you woke up again, it was into the later am.</p><p>You were a modern, 21st-century woman, so of course, the first thing you did was grab your phone to check everything that was going on.</p><p>Stark Industries was trending.</p><p>Tony Stark himself had issued a statement barely an hour ago, stating that it had come to his attention that several members of staff were responsible for acts of gross misconduct. He went on to say that not only had said staff been removed from the company, an internal investigation was also being launched in order to root out any other bad seeds, and completely overhaul the way complaints and issues were raised and dealt with.</p><p>He\u2019d said he was going to deal with it, but this, this you hadn\u2019t expected. Not this fast and not at this scale. It was satisfying to know you\u2019d finally been taken seriously.</p><p>It was a good way to start the day.</p><p>The time went by quick. Most of it was spent catching up on chores and doing a final sort through of your notes. By the time it came to get ready, you were surprisingly not nervous. You should\u2019ve been, you thought. You were spending the evening with Tony Stark. It was just business, he said that himself, but it was still Tony Stark, and it was still one on one. Yet you weren\u2019t. For whatever reason, you felt at ease around him, and the only thing you felt was excitement.</p><p>You kept your clothes to business casual, not wanting to overdo it, but not wanting to look like you didn\u2019t care either.</p><p>Dead on six, there was a knock on your door, and sure enough, a driver was waiting to take you to Tony.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that long a ride before you were stepping inside his living space at Stark Tower.</p><p><i>Welcome Dr. Y/L/N. Mr. Stark is currently downstairs in his lab, but he\u2019ll be up momentarily. Please, take a seat and make yourself comfortable. </i></p><p>The voice nearly made you jump out of your skin. It was the same one that spoke out of Tony\u2019s phone yesterday.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you said, taking a moment to look around as you walked. \u201cWho\u2026who are you?\u2019</p><p><i>My name is Jarvis. A UI Mr. Stark created to run several aspects of his business and life. If I can be of assistance to you at any point, please do not hesitate to ask.</i></p><p>\"Right, thank you.\u201d You\u2019d figured out you were talking to a computer, but it was still a shock to talk to one that came across so\u2026human.</p><p>You walked into the main living area, setting your bag of notes down on the sofa. There was a pizza box sitting on the table, the brand familiar. It was the same name that was on the empty box in your kitchen yesterday. It wasn\u2019t all that expensive though, so the chances of someone like Tony buying it himself were slim. Which meant he\u2019d seen it and taken note.</p><p>It was a nice thought.</p><p>Wandering over to the window, you looked out across the city. It was dark by now, and the lights of New York were shining and twinkling below you.</p><p>\u201cNot a bad view, huh?\u201d Tony came up next to you, looking out the window too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Tony was looking at you as he spoke.</p><p>Turning away from the view, you faced him. \u201cI saw what you did this morning. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to thank. It needed to be done.\u201d Tony raised an arm gesturing to the sofa. \u201cHave a seat. Drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess\u2026Jack and coke?\u201d Tony walked over the bar, already pulling out two tumblers.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d You sat on the sofa, retrieving your bag and starting to pull out some of your notes. It was surprising how natural it felt being here. It was more like hanging out with a friend than one of the worlds most famous mean who also happened to be fucking Iron Man.</p><p>\u201cLucky guess?\u201d You raised an eyebrow and he laughed. \u201cThere was a bottle of Jack in the kitchen, and an empty can at the top of the trash. Educated guess then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObservant. I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount me flattered.\u201d Tony brought the two glasses over and set them down onto the table next to the pizza box.</p><p>\u201cYou frequent tiny pizza places halfway across the city too or just another feat of observation?\u201d You asked, picking up one of the glasses and taking a sip. It was good. Tony knew how to mix a drink.</p><p>\u201cPoint of tonight was to talk you back into working here, figured some creature comforts wouldn\u2019t hurt my efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure it\u2019s already safe to say I\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because of some pizza and liquor? A woman after my own heart.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, you matched his position, leaning against the back of the sofa. \u201cThat\u2019s a part of it, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled, the look soft on his face. \u201cBut seriously, you okay? After everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent over a decade getting degrees from places filled with men thinking I shouldn\u2019t be there. It\u2019ll take more than a few dicks to get me. Not worth the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats me how they even got hired. We need more staff like you and me, geniuses, not their prehistoric butts.\u201d</p><p>Geniuses. Plural. He thought you were on the same level. \u201cFlattery will get you everywhere, Mr. Stark,\u201d you said, putting on a fake posh voice, mainly to deflect how sincere he was being and how you were definitely not sure how to handle it.</p><p>Tony grinned, \u201cEverywhere? You are exceptionally intriguing, Dr. Y/L/N.\u201d He mimicked your accent, sounding like a terrible version of Jarvis.</p><p>The gentle moment successfully broken, you laughed again, grateful he\u2019d taken the cue instead of pushing it. The compliment had been well received, for sure. In fact, you were pretty sure it was the best compliment you could ever be given. It was the quiet concern that had thrown you. He had been worried that you weren\u2019t okay. It was both sweet and unexpected, though maybe it shouldn\u2019t have been given the events of the morning.</p><p>Tony reached over and flipped the pizza box open, then motioned to the papers sitting next to you. \u201cShall we start?\u201d</p><p>You nodded, figuring you\u2019d begin with the very reason he\u2019d asked you over. The blueprints you\u2019d left behind in the lab that no one else could get working. It had been an idea you\u2019d had for years, one that was never more than an idealistic fantasy until you\u2019d started work at Stark Industries. You\u2019d been browsing the blueprints of an older version of the Iron Man suit that Tony had released to the labs, and there staring right back at you was the technology you needed to make your idea become reality. Only problem was that you needed to figure out a way to scale it down to a fraction of the size. You\u2019d worked on it every day you were allowed to pursue your own individual tech projects rather than focusing on one\u2019s already established within the company.</p><p>You told Tony all about it, explained how exactly you were planning to shrink it down and fit it into the main tech itself. The breakthrough had come just days before you left, and there\u2019d been no time to see if it\u2019d work for certain, so you\u2019d taken the notes home with you, just leaving the main design as the company.</p><p>\u201cI can see why no one else came up with this. Even I\u2019d need to focus on nothing but it to come up with these solutions.\u201d Tony was reading through your notes, looking genuinely amazed. \u201cGotta ask though, why didn\u2019t you take the design with you? Your ideas are your own until prototypes start getting made.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged, \u201cI hoped that leaving it in the databases would mean it\u2019d get made one day. And that was all I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommendable. A lot would\u2019ve taken it and tried to make a quick buck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would. I just want to help people and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what I want to do too. Which is why I want to give you your own lab, your own team, access to newer Iron Man tech, whatever you need to get this done.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d been anticipating a promotion, but not to that level. You didn\u2019t even know anyone who ran a lab dedicated to just one project. You\u2019d heard of people who ran them, but those were scientists who\u2019d been working for the company for years, the best of the best.</p><p>\u201cWow, I\u2026I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yes! Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like this needs to be out there, and I want us to be the one to do it. And I want you to be the one to spearhead it. With things like this I try to be a bit more involved though, so there\u2019ll be more stuff like this. Catching up with what\u2019s going on one on one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not opposed to that. Especially if there\u2019s more pizza involved.\u201d.</p><p>Tony threw his head back as he laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll add it into the contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case when do I start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d Tony clapped his hands together, then grabbed your now empty glasses and went to refill them. \u201cTo new adventures,\u201d he toasted when he returned and passed you the glass back.</p><p>\u201cTo new adventures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel like telling me what\u2019s on the rest of the stuff you bought? Maybe we\u2019ll find the next big thing for the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d you chuckled, picking up the notebook you used for general notes and ideas. \u201cMost of the stuff in here is just random crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, sometimes the best things from random crap. Humor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell since it\u2019s you and you did just offer me the job a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever said money can\u2019t get you what you want?\u201d</p><p>Rolling your eyes with a smile, you grabbed the book and started going through it. A lot of it really was junk, but some, some could maybe turn into something more. Especially if you stayed on in the long run.</p><p>You didn\u2019t even realize how long you talked about some of the things for. Once you started, you found you couldn\u2019t stop, especially when Tony didn\u2019t immediately laugh you out of the tower. And it was nice, for once, to get to just talk about all the little things that had popped into your head over the years, rather than focusing on making others ideas a reality.</p><p>When you finally stopped, Tony was silent. Looking up from the book and over to him, you saw him watching you with what could only be described as the human version of the heart eye emoji.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You asked, laughing nervously.</p><p>\u201cYou really are a genius. This\u2026this stuff, it\u2019s incredible. I have no idea how your brain works to come up with some of this, but I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? They\u2019re nothing special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are! God, there are at least five things I can see being not only viable but exceptional, and two I definitely want to look into further because they could make great additions to the next Iron Man upgrade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Figured I was going to be a one trick pony kinda girl, and the rest of time I\u2019d just be backing people up. Group projects and all that stuff.\u201d</p><p>Tony had been keeping a respectable distance, but then he slid across the soft material until he was closer to you. He let a hand rest on your forearm, giving you the chance to pull back if you wanted. When you didn\u2019t, he smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible. I pulled your file Y/N. I\u2019ve seen just how smart you are. You were the best person in that lab hands down, no one else even came close.\u201d</p><p>You smiled. \u201cThanks. Maybe those dicks did get to me a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew 'em. If they ever see you again they\u2019ll be calling you ma\u2019 am and begging for some cash to fund some crummy little project, and you\u2019ll get the satisfaction of telling them they should go back home to their kitchen.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t intentional, but you snorted a laugh at that. \u201cThat would be exceptionally satisfying actually. The look on their faces\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Now you have another goal to work towards. One I\u2019ll happily help you with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow thoughtful,\u201d you grinned, starting to pick up all the papers that had been scattered about throughout the evening. A photo slipped out of the back of the notebook, falling to the ground.</p><p>Tony got to it before you did, picking it up and flipping it over to look at the picture. \u201cThis you?\u201d he asked, gesturing to the little kid in the photo, proudly holding up a robot. Behind the kid was a grown-up woman, holding a large ribbon with a 1 in the center, looking like she couldn\u2019t be any prouder.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s me, and that\u2019s my Mom. I\u2019d just won a local robotics competition. Dad said I was too young to enter, but I wanted to go, so she took me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom sounds pretty special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. She always encouraged me when things seemed like too much. And she\u2019s the reason why I came up with the band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. When I was doing my first thesis, she had a health scare. She\u2019d been complaining of problems for months, but no one took her seriously, and by the time she was, it was almost too late. She\u2019s fine now, but if she\u2019d had the band-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have gotten that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Tony handed you the photo and squeezed your hand. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop shit like that from happening, I promise.*</p><p>\"Damn right we are.\u201d You looked down at the photo for a few seconds, making a note to call her in the morning to tell her all the news. She\u2019d been worried when you quit, but never once blamed you. To find out now that you\u2019d be heading a team and working with Tony would make her whole year.</p><p>She\u2019d like Tony. You already knew she\u2019d try to push the two of you together, especially since you both seemed to think so much alike. After spending the evening with him you wouldn\u2019t be opposed. Tony was interested in you that you were sure of. And compared to how you\u2019d felt when the other guy had made advances, it was totally different now. Whereas he had no concept of boundaries or even what the word 'no\u2019 meant, it wasn\u2019t like that with Tony. You trusted he\u2019d respect whatever boundaries you set up, professional or otherwise without even thinking twice about it. You were comfortable around him too. It had been some time since you\u2019d felt so at ease and happy.</p><p>So, yeah, you were maybe definitely interested in Tony too.</p><p>Why wait for your Mom to get involved then?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a hell of a cook too. When I won she offered to take me out somewhere to eat, but all I wanted was some of her grilled cheese and a piece of her apple pie. Actually made sure I brought a book of her recipes with me when I moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s been forever since I\u2019ve had a Mom-approved meal. Always something special about the recipes, y'know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I was actually planning on making something of hers tomorrow. Won\u2019t be as good as her making it herself, but I\u2019m not bad. You could come try some if you wanted.\u201d Wow. Smooth.</p><p>Tony looked at you, eyebrows raised and an amused smile, \u201cI\u2019d love to, but doesn\u2019t very professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t really meant to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. What time should I bring the wine?\u201d</p><p>Huffing a small sigh of relief, you matched his smile. \u201cSay seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there on the dot.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p><b>1 Year Later </b></p><p>Tony was up on stage, commanding the attention of journalists and experts, and who knew what else. You\u2019d left the arrangements of who to invite to those who actually knew what they were doing. You were too busy focusing on not throwing up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, love,\u201d your Mom was next to you, holding your hand in hers reassuringly. You needed to thank Tony again later for flying her in as a surprise for tonight.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I mess up? Tony\u2019s poured so much into this\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. You have your speech on your tablet thing don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, it\u2019s all written down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll have no problem. This is what you\u2019ve been waiting for, I know you\u2019ll be amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow for why we\u2019re all here. The big reveal! Exciting! We\u2019ve all had fitness trackers, right? Little bands on our wrists that tell us how many steps we\u2019ve taken or what our heart rate is, but what if those bands could do more? What if they could tell us everything about our health? What if they could test our blood and scan us while we slept and spotted any anomalies? What if we could do away with expensive tests and long waiting times, and have all health updates uploaded straight to your patient file? Well, ladies and gents, I\u2019m here to tell you that we\u2019re no longer in a world of 'what-ifs\u2019. That time is now. Stark Industries is proud to announce a new step forward in health care. Introducing, Sanus.\u201d</p><p>On the stage, Tony finished his opening speech and stepped to one side as the introductory advert for your wrist band played to the crowd.</p><p>It was impossible to tell what the initial reaction was, but there was applause when it came to an end that sounded promising.</p><p>\u201cFantastic, huh?\u201d Tony said as he walked back out to the center of the stage. \u201cIron Man technology adapted so everyone can carry it around on their wrists. Say goodbye to self-diagnosing, or worrying that a random symptom could be more. Concerned one thing could be the start of something more? Sanus can check it out and ease your mind. Or if, there if there is something, let you and your Doctor know so you can work together to get you better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver think that maybe you\u2019re being overlooked? Know in your gut you\u2019re sick but can\u2019t find anyone to take you seriously? Now you have the tool to find that evidence and get the diagnosis you need and the treatment you deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSanus is cost-effective and easy to use. You can communicate by voice or with just a few taps on the app it comes with. And don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s perfectly secure. Only you and you alone can dictate who has access to your information and if you want a person removed? Just tell Sanus and they\u2019ll be gone in seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering how this is possible. After all the Iron Man suit is a lot bigger than this nifty little band. I\u2019d love to take the credit for it all, I really would. But this feat of ingenuity was not down to me. I\u2019d like to introduce you to the person capable of such brilliance though. Here to explain all the geeky techy bits about how everything works, please welcome Doctor Y/N Y/L/N.\u201d</p><p>Tony gestured towards you as the crowd applauded again and your Mom squeezed your hand a final time before letting you go to walk onto the stage. Tony met you in the middle, an arm coming behind you to guide you to the podium that was rising up.</p><p>'You got this\u2019 he mouthed with a grin and a wink, joining in with the applause as he took a few steps back.</p><p>Setting your tablet down, you looked out across the crowd. You couldn\u2019t make out anyone, the bright lights of the stage blocking them all out. You could hear them though as the clapping came to a stop. The clicks of cameras and the shuffling of feet. So many years of brainstorming and scrapping calculations to get something close to a valid idea. And now you were here, introducing it to the world and explaining everything. No time to fuck up now.</p><p>You started talking, continuously glancing down at speech in front of you at first. Yet as you went on, your confidence grew, and you found yourself looking down less and less, the words coming with ease. You spoke of where the idea came from, the work you\u2019d put in to make it viable, Tony\u2019s help and encouragement. Everything. Plenty probably wouldn\u2019t understand the finer details, but plenty would too.</p><p>There was a third round of applause when you were done, led by Tony who came back over to join you. The lights dimmed a little just enough for you to be able to make out some of the people. There were hundreds, if not over a thousand people watching.</p><p>Tony opened up the floor to questions of which there were plenty, and together you managed to get through them. Having him next to you bolstered your confidence further. It was contagious. That and the positive excitement was exhilarating. To see so many people wanting to know more about your own creation\u2026</p><p>You exited the stage together, Tony taking your hand as you descended the few steps. It wasn\u2019t needed, but it was welcome.</p><p>Tony caught you by surprise, pulling you close and picking you up from the floor, spinning you both around. \u201cYou killed it, babe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have done it without you, old man,\u201d you laughed when he set you down.</p><p>\u201cLess of the old, please!\u201d Tony grabbed you by the waist before you could get away, ignoring your squawk of protest as he held on tight. \u201cSay sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least wait until you\u2019re somewhere private the both of you.\u201d Your mom appeared, and Tony let you go so you could go to her and hug her. \u201cYou were amazing, sweetheart. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She kissed your cheek and pulled back. \u201cYou two should home and celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could come with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Too late for me. I\u2019m going back to the hotel for some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Happy drive you, Mrs. Y/L/N,\u201d Tony said, slipping his arm around your waist again.</p><p>\u201cThank you, son. I\u2019ll see you both for lunch tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse. Night, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d She kissed your cheek again, and then Tony\u2019s before grabbing her things and leaving.</p><p>\u201cThank you for bringing her out here,\u201d you smiled, wrapping your arms around Tony\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cShe needed to be here for tonight.\u201d Tony\u2019s hands settled on your hips as he leaned in for a kiss. \u201cWhat do you feel like doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we head to the after party thing Pepper\u2019s putting on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. She knows me well enough not to expect me.\u201d</p><p>You laughed. \u201cYou make an excellent point, Mr. Stark. What d'you say we head home and have our own private party then?\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned, \u201cI like the way you think, Dr. Y/L/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike? Not love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove too. Definitely, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Love you too.\u201d</p><p>Together you started to make your way to the quiet exit that had been set aside, hand in hand. \u201cHave I told you yet how good you look in that outfit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can show me what you think when we get home.\u201d</p><p>Tony opened the car door and followed you inside. \u201cGod, I really do love you.\u201d</p><p>Tagging: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF71hfhHEtE-O_-TMp9vPcg\" target=\"_blank\">@medicatemedrmccoy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXaDHpHMy0K39hd6MSlaRig\" target=\"_blank\">@thefanficfaerie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRCGtcrdAjAQWHH8wbalOw\" target=\"_blank\">@sidskywrote</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUQ8uRajg_cCooNltZ66TUg\" target=\"_blank\">@star-trekkin-across-theuniverse</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5U_u9GKDf0_WMKwI1CjkQ\" target=\"_blank\">@feelmyroarrrr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDTjUsNHMkwS8_QZ_5CSNzA\" target=\"_blank\">@ironwinterhawk</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpl5mIi4heCIbzdA984sAhg\" target=\"_blank\">@weasleyisourjedi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNLNsVwPe9B9L0t5skhE6_Q\" target=\"_blank\">@ketchavies-thoorrrr666</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTcYrJNoBbgZ1AP-UpWNfoQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nishanki1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gB-qc4i4kmz68r0WioGkw\" target=\"_blank\">@biglouche</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0eusIrNkdOM1Uqp-0qI5uw\" target=\"_blank\">@stephn-prkr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlfbP0dov72ynqmpGE7OBGA\" target=\"_blank\">@teddybluesclues</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7CsHBGCX8RYJgYJ4m3WnHQ\" target=\"_blank\">@wildefire</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAOZA_cBpLE5dXme-HS8Mfw\" target=\"_blank\">@magnetosgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMBhbyeirqdGDuFzAjCs31g\" target=\"_blank\">@bolontiku</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\" target=\"_blank\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH4ETjHt_Z1V1VA02FIyAQg\" target=\"_blank\">@saphirepearl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzEJqCW1j6ZBjCaheI0fTNw\" target=\"_blank\">@1d-killed-me</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBvPZvsc4FHgzYHQ5u5Bw5A\" target=\"_blank\">@akxra-amxn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7YoIKztmyr4NJk0Y7_CNXw\" target=\"_blank\">@sleep-i-ness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfm8Zt1szg9DaF2KS8-TYeQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thoughtfulllamaoperatoralien</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m44fkKk8XaRIOLxQV-4swwA\" target=\"_blank\">@suzen23smith</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX1fiwIGDMWTzeSU4b1Llow\" target=\"_blank\">@arromite</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLmxhACum2ZZjXo9i_69gJw\" target=\"_blank\">@valiisi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUVoioJqQCpfzOr_DeoBFAQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starmission</a>\u00a0\u00a0</p></p>",

Until one night Tony Stark himself shows up at your door, saying he needs your help.</p><p><b>A/N:</b> My first Tony fic ahhhhh! I really hope you guys enjoy it, and please let me know what you think! I already have another one-shot idea, so feedback will help me know if you want it! :)</p><p><br></p><p>It had been a month since you\u2019d officially left your job at Stark Industries. A whole month and you still missed it and the work you did there, low level as you were. But staying there hadn\u2019t been a possibility either. </p><p>It had started a few months before. One of your coworkers in your lab decided he fancied you and refused to accept you didn\u2019t like him in return. It hadn\u2019t been too bad at first, annoying but not that bad. Mostly just him asking you out every few days, a few inappropriate comments about your looks here and there, but not enough for you to want to raise any issues. But then your lab threw a party for another colleague\u2019s birthday, complete with alcohol. </p><p>He\u2019d had too much and followed you into the bathroom. Cornering you in one of the stalls, he\u2019d refused to move or stop with the remarks about how much he wanted you and how tired he was off waiting. </p><p>Nothing happened in the end. Someone else came in and spooked him away. But it was more than you could handle. More than you should have had to handle. So you\u2019d filed a complaint with your supervisor. Who promptly dismissed it since he hadn\u2019t actually done anything. </p><p>You took it higher again to the floor manager. He called you in for a meeting, and later that day you handed in your resignation. He\u2019d been even worse than the others, and any thoughts about going higher again disappeared. It wasn\u2019t worth the stress or the shitty way it made you feel. </p><p>You\u2019d worked your notice and left. </p><p>Now you just needed to find a new job. Which was surprisingly harder than you\u2019d anticipated. Most hadn\u2019t even called you back. Why you didn\u2019t know. You were plenty qualified, and it was hard to get better previous experience than working at Stark Industries. </p><p>Sprawled on the sofa in your apartment, you scrolled through potential jobs on your tablet. The savings in your bank were starting to dwindle, and you were faced with the choice of looking for a lesser job or leaving New York altogether. You didn\u2019t want either. You\u2019d worked hard to get to New York, but you didn\u2019t want to get stuck at a job you hated either. </p><p>A knock on your door startled you from your miserable dwelling. You were tempted to ignore it, but then the person on the other side knocked again, and curiosity got the better of you. Who would come knocking at eight on a Thursday night? </p><p>Apparently Tony fucking Stark would.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cY/N Y/L/N?\u201d He asked, pocketing his sunglasses once you opened the door. </p><p>For an MIT graduate with two doctorates to your name, it took your brain an embarrassingly long time time to process what was going on and form actual words. \u201cUhh\u2026yeah. Yes. Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! Need to talk to you. May I?\u201d Stark gestured to the inside of your apartment. </p><p>You nodded dumbly, stepping aside to let him in. \u201cC-can I get you something to drink, sir?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I can\u2019t stay too long,\u201d he said, taking a look around him. It was the first time you\u2019d really realized what a mess the whole place was. There were pieces of paper with notes and calculations for random things pinned up everywhere, covering most of the wall space. Then there were the couple of take-out cartons you hadn\u2019t gotten around to recycling yet, and the pile of thankfully clean laundry, that was stacked on a chair waiting to get put away. Stark didn\u2019t seem bothered by any of it though, but then he seemed more focused on the papers anyway. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to the point,\u201d he said, turning to face you again. \u201cYou left my company and I\u2019m here to get you back.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been no time to really consider why he was here, but you knew for certain that wouldn\u2019t have even made the list. \u201cYou want me back?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Stark pulled his phone from his pocket and tapped a couple buttons before showing you the screen. You recognized the blueprint on it immediately. \u201cYour design right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I submitted it just before I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. Amazing, really. I was stunned when I came across it. A little embarrassed I hadn\u2019t thought to use Iron Man tech like that, but that\u2019s just between you and me.\u201d Stark winked at you, switching off the screen again. \u201cI made it a research priority, something like this needs to be out there, but no one\u2019s been able to figure out how to fit that amount of tech into something so small. I\u2019ve had some ideas, but none have looked promising for long term viability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to know if I know how to do it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn theory. I\u2019ve not run any simulations.\u201d</p><p>Stark nodded. \u201cTheory is more than anyone else has come up with. Next question, what\u2019ll it take for you to come back? More money? Apartment upgrade? Name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir\u2026I didn\u2019t leave because I wasn\u2019t earning enough, or anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you?\u201d </p><p>You bit the inside of your cheek, wondering what you should say. Stark was being overwhelmingly complimentary, but that didn\u2019t mean it\u2019d stay that way. He was another man after all. \u201cThe people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people? Gonna have to elaborate there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably be easier to pull the audio recording of Office 3A from February eighteenth. I was in a meeting with Pete and explained everything.\u201d It was the best solution you could think of. You didn\u2019t want to talk through everything again, and if he heard it himself at least he\u2019d believe you. </p><p>\u201cOkay. Jarvis, locate audio file of Peter Jamesons office on February eighteenth, 2019.\u201d Stark spoke into his phone, which was pretty unexpected. </p><p><i>Audio file found. Would you like to listen to the playback from a specific time?</i></p><p>Stark looked towards you, holding the phone forwards in a gesture to speak. </p><p>\u201cUh, 1 pm?\u201d </p><p><i>Playing Office 3A audio from 1 pm</i></p><p>You were expecting it, but it still gave you a shock when your own voice and that of Peter\u2019s, the floor managers, started to speak from Starks phone.</p><p>Most of it was you retelling your story about the coworker and the bathroom, and then your supervisor\u2019s dismissal of it.</p><p><i>\u201cWhat were you wearing?\u201d Pete asked.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAt the party, what were you wearing?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026it was straight after work. It was similar to this.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, those pants are very form fitting. And that shirt could be revealing if you were to bend over enough.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSir, are you saying I asked for it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot ask. But perhaps subconsciously you thought to invite it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can promise you that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cEither way, you should\u2019ve expected something like this to happen.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026I should have?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re a woman and this is a male-dominated environment. Of course, you should\u2019ve expected romantic advances.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe truth isn\u2019t appropriate? Sweetheart, if you wanted to avoid this bother then you should\u2019ve stayed at home. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d exceed phenomenally in a kitchen.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m exceeding here.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you? Or did you get the job because of some diversity laws?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI got the job because I was the top of all my classes, earned two PhDs in some of the most difficult subjects and am one of the best in my field!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo need to get emotional. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re plenty smart. Just not smart enough to understand the natural way of things.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI take this means you\u2019re dismissing my complaint?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDoctor Grant did nothing wrong in my eyes, Ms. Y/L/N.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine. Then I want to take it higher.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHigher? I wouldn\u2019t advise that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe ones higher don\u2019t like to be bothered with such trivial matters. They won\u2019t be happy telling you the same thing you\u2019ve been told twice already. Might not end well for you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you suggesting I\u2019ll be fired for reporting a case of harassment?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting anything, Ms.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay. I\u2019d thank you for your time, but I don\u2019t want to. You\u2019ll have my resignation by the end of the day.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d you said quietly when you heard the sound of a door closing, signaling that you left the office, and Jarvis stopped the recording.</p><p>Tony hadn\u2019t spoken a word as you listened, but his face said enough. He was angry, quiet but furious.</p><p>Sir, would you like me to inform Miss. Potts over this issue?</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to deal with this personally. We\u2019ll discuss it later, Jarvis.\u201d</p><p>Yes, sir.</p><p>Stark tucked his phone away and looked back at you. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You shouldn\u2019t have had to deal with that.\u201d</p><p>Crossing your arms over your chest, you shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. We\u2019re meant to be making the world a better place, and we can\u2019t do that if our own employees get away with this shit. It\u2019s gonna be dealt with, I promise.*</p><p>\"Thank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Stark waved his hand through the air. \u201cStop with the \u2018sir\u2019. It\u2019s Tony.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and nodded. \u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Tony\u2019s watch chimed and he muttered under his breath. \u201cI need to go, but I\u2019m not done with you or your work. I want you back working for me. With me. Are you free, say tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Only thing I had planned was more job hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s unnecessary now. What do you say to coming over and talking final details? All totally professional of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome! I\u2019ll send someone to get you around six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned, heading to the door before stopping and gesturing to all the papers on your walls. \u201cAre all these for your blueprint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost. Some are just notes of other ideas. Easier to write them down and get them out of my head, y'know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Bring them with you. All of them. I want to know what else goes through that brilliant head of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you.\u201d</p><p>With that he was gone, leaving you wondering what the hell had really just happened. Tony Stark had been in your home, admitted the shit that was going on his own company, promised to fix it, then invited you to an informal business meeting. And what did he mean by working with him?</p><p>The only things you knew for sure were that you\u2019d happily to return to work at Stark Industries in whatever capacity if you were taken seriously and that you were definitely excited for the next night.</p><p>~</p><p>The rest of your night was spent pulling down all your notes and trying to put them in some kind of order. By the time you\u2019d actually made it your bed, it well into the early am, and by the time you woke up again, it was into the later am.</p><p>You were a modern, 21st-century woman, so of course, the first thing you did was grab your phone to check everything that was going on.</p><p>Stark Industries was trending.</p><p>Tony Stark himself had issued a statement barely an hour ago, stating that it had come to his attention that several members of staff were responsible for acts of gross misconduct. He went on to say that not only had said staff been removed from the company, an internal investigation was also being launched in order to root out any other bad seeds, and completely overhaul the way complaints and issues were raised and dealt with.</p><p>He\u2019d said he was going to deal with it, but this, this you hadn\u2019t expected. Not this fast and not at this scale. It was satisfying to know you\u2019d finally been taken seriously.</p><p>It was a good way to start the day.</p><p>The time went by quick. Most of it was spent catching up on chores and doing a final sort through of your notes. By the time it came to get ready, you were surprisingly not nervous. You should\u2019ve been, you thought. You were spending the evening with Tony Stark. It was just business, he said that himself, but it was still Tony Stark, and it was still one on one. Yet you weren\u2019t. For whatever reason, you felt at ease around him, and the only thing you felt was excitement.</p><p>You kept your clothes to business casual, not wanting to overdo it, but not wanting to look like you didn\u2019t care either.</p><p>Dead on six, there was a knock on your door, and sure enough, a driver was waiting to take you to Tony.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that long a ride before you were stepping inside his living space at Stark Tower.</p><p><i>Welcome Dr. Y/L/N. Mr. Stark is currently downstairs in his lab, but he\u2019ll be up momentarily. Please, take a seat and make yourself comfortable. </i></p><p>The voice nearly made you jump out of your skin. It was the same one that spoke out of Tony\u2019s phone yesterday.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you said, taking a moment to look around as you walked. \u201cWho\u2026who are you?\u2019</p><p><i>My name is Jarvis. A UI Mr. Stark created to run several aspects of his business and life. If I can be of assistance to you at any point, please do not hesitate to ask.</i></p><p>\"Right, thank you.\u201d You\u2019d figured out you were talking to a computer, but it was still a shock to talk to one that came across so\u2026human.</p><p>You walked into the main living area, setting your bag of notes down on the sofa. There was a pizza box sitting on the table, the brand familiar. It was the same name that was on the empty box in your kitchen yesterday. It wasn\u2019t all that expensive though, so the chances of someone like Tony buying it himself were slim. Which meant he\u2019d seen it and taken note.</p><p>It was a nice thought.</p><p>Wandering over to the window, you looked out across the city. It was dark by now, and the lights of New York were shining and twinkling below you.</p><p>\u201cNot a bad view, huh?\u201d Tony came up next to you, looking out the window too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Tony was looking at you as he spoke.</p><p>Turning away from the view, you faced him. \u201cI saw what you did this morning. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to thank. It needed to be done.\u201d Tony raised an arm gesturing to the sofa. \u201cHave a seat. Drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess\u2026Jack and coke?\u201d Tony walked over the bar, already pulling out two tumblers.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d You sat on the sofa, retrieving your bag and starting to pull out some of your notes. It was surprising how natural it felt being here. It was more like hanging out with a friend than one of the worlds most famous mean who also happened to be fucking Iron Man.</p><p>\u201cLucky guess?\u201d You raised an eyebrow and he laughed. \u201cThere was a bottle of Jack in the kitchen, and an empty can at the top of the trash. Educated guess then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObservant. I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount me flattered.\u201d Tony brought the two glasses over and set them down onto the table next to the pizza box.</p><p>\u201cYou frequent tiny pizza places halfway across the city too or just another feat of observation?\u201d You asked, picking up one of the glasses and taking a sip. It was good. Tony knew how to mix a drink.</p><p>\u201cPoint of tonight was to talk you back into working here, figured some creature comforts wouldn\u2019t hurt my efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure it\u2019s already safe to say I\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because of some pizza and liquor? A woman after my own heart.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, you matched his position, leaning against the back of the sofa. \u201cThat\u2019s a part of it, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled, the look soft on his face. \u201cBut seriously, you okay? After everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent over a decade getting degrees from places filled with men thinking I shouldn\u2019t be there. It\u2019ll take more than a few dicks to get me. Not worth the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats me how they even got hired. We need more staff like you and me, geniuses, not their prehistoric butts.\u201d</p><p>Geniuses. Plural. He thought you were on the same level. \u201cFlattery will get you everywhere, Mr. Stark,\u201d you said, putting on a fake posh voice, mainly to deflect how sincere he was being and how you were definitely not sure how to handle it.</p><p>Tony grinned, \u201cEverywhere? You are exceptionally intriguing, Dr. Y/L/N.\u201d He mimicked your accent, sounding like a terrible version of Jarvis.</p><p>The gentle moment successfully broken, you laughed again, grateful he\u2019d taken the cue instead of pushing it. The compliment had been well received, for sure. In fact, you were pretty sure it was the best compliment you could ever be given. It was the quiet concern that had thrown you. He had been worried that you weren\u2019t okay. It was both sweet and unexpected, though maybe it shouldn\u2019t have been given the events of the morning.</p><p>Tony reached over and flipped the pizza box open, then motioned to the papers sitting next to you. \u201cShall we start?\u201d</p><p>You nodded, figuring you\u2019d begin with the very reason he\u2019d asked you over. The blueprints you\u2019d left behind in the lab that no one else could get working. It had been an idea you\u2019d had for years, one that was never more than an idealistic fantasy until you\u2019d started work at Stark Industries. You\u2019d been browsing the blueprints of an older version of the Iron Man suit that Tony had released to the labs, and there staring right back at you was the technology you needed to make your idea become reality. Only problem was that you needed to figure out a way to scale it down to a fraction of the size. You\u2019d worked on it every day you were allowed to pursue your own individual tech projects rather than focusing on one\u2019s already established within the company.</p><p>You told Tony all about it, explained how exactly you were planning to shrink it down and fit it into the main tech itself. The breakthrough had come just days before you left, and there\u2019d been no time to see if it\u2019d work for certain, so you\u2019d taken the notes home with you, just leaving the main design as the company.</p><p>\u201cI can see why no one else came up with this. Even I\u2019d need to focus on nothing but it to come up with these solutions.\u201d Tony was reading through your notes, looking genuinely amazed. \u201cGotta ask though, why didn\u2019t you take the design with you? Your ideas are your own until prototypes start getting made.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged, \u201cI hoped that leaving it in the databases would mean it\u2019d get made one day. And that was all I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommendable. A lot would\u2019ve taken it and tried to make a quick buck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would. I just want to help people and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what I want to do too. Which is why I want to give you your own lab, your own team, access to newer Iron Man tech, whatever you need to get this done.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d been anticipating a promotion, but not to that level. You didn\u2019t even know anyone who ran a lab dedicated to just one project. You\u2019d heard of people who ran them, but those were scientists who\u2019d been working for the company for years, the best of the best.</p><p>\u201cWow, I\u2026I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yes! Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like this needs to be out there, and I want us to be the one to do it. And I want you to be the one to spearhead it. With things like this I try to be a bit more involved though, so there\u2019ll be more stuff like this. Catching up with what\u2019s going on one on one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not opposed to that. Especially if there\u2019s more pizza involved.\u201d.</p><p>Tony threw his head back as he laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll add it into the contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case when do I start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d Tony clapped his hands together, then grabbed your now empty glasses and went to refill them. \u201cTo new adventures,\u201d he toasted when he returned and passed you the glass back.</p><p>\u201cTo new adventures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel like telling me what\u2019s on the rest of the stuff you bought? Maybe we\u2019ll find the next big thing for the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d you chuckled, picking up the notebook you used for general notes and ideas. \u201cMost of the stuff in here is just random crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, sometimes the best things from random crap. Humor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell since it\u2019s you and you did just offer me the job a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever said money can\u2019t get you what you want?\u201d</p><p>Rolling your eyes with a smile, you grabbed the book and started going through it. A lot of it really was junk, but some, some could maybe turn into something more. Especially if you stayed on in the long run.</p><p>You didn\u2019t even realize how long you talked about some of the things for. Once you started, you found you couldn\u2019t stop, especially when Tony didn\u2019t immediately laugh you out of the tower. And it was nice, for once, to get to just talk about all the little things that had popped into your head over the years, rather than focusing on making others ideas a reality.</p><p>When you finally stopped, Tony was silent. Looking up from the book and over to him, you saw him watching you with what could only be described as the human version of the heart eye emoji.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You asked, laughing nervously.</p><p>\u201cYou really are a genius. This\u2026this stuff, it\u2019s incredible. I have no idea how your brain works to come up with some of this, but I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? They\u2019re nothing special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are! God, there are at least five things I can see being not only viable but exceptional, and two I definitely want to look into further because they could make great additions to the next Iron Man upgrade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Figured I was going to be a one trick pony kinda girl, and the rest of time I\u2019d just be backing people up. Group projects and all that stuff.\u201d</p><p>Tony had been keeping a respectable distance, but then he slid across the soft material until he was closer to you. He let a hand rest on your forearm, giving you the chance to pull back if you wanted. When you didn\u2019t, he smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible. I pulled your file Y/N. I\u2019ve seen just how smart you are. You were the best person in that lab hands down, no one else even came close.\u201d</p><p>You smiled. \u201cThanks. Maybe those dicks did get to me a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew 'em. If they ever see you again they\u2019ll be calling you ma\u2019 am and begging for some cash to fund some crummy little project, and you\u2019ll get the satisfaction of telling them they should go back home to their kitchen.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t intentional, but you snorted a laugh at that. \u201cThat would be exceptionally satisfying actually. The look on their faces\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Now you have another goal to work towards. One I\u2019ll happily help you with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow thoughtful,\u201d you grinned, starting to pick up all the papers that had been scattered about throughout the evening. A photo slipped out of the back of the notebook, falling to the ground.</p><p>Tony got to it before you did, picking it up and flipping it over to look at the picture. \u201cThis you?\u201d he asked, gesturing to the little kid in the photo, proudly holding up a robot. Behind the kid was a grown-up woman, holding a large ribbon with a 1 in the center, looking like she couldn\u2019t be any prouder.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s me, and that\u2019s my Mom. I\u2019d just won a local robotics competition. Dad said I was too young to enter, but I wanted to go, so she took me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom sounds pretty special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. She always encouraged me when things seemed like too much. And she\u2019s the reason why I came up with the band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. When I was doing my first thesis, she had a health scare. She\u2019d been complaining of problems for months, but no one took her seriously, and by the time she was, it was almost too late. She\u2019s fine now, but if she\u2019d had the band-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have gotten that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Tony handed you the photo and squeezed your hand. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop shit like that from happening, I promise.*</p><p>\"Damn right we are.\u201d You looked down at the photo for a few seconds, making a note to call her in the morning to tell her all the news. She\u2019d been worried when you quit, but never once blamed you. To find out now that you\u2019d be heading a team and working with Tony would make her whole year.</p><p>She\u2019d like Tony. You already knew she\u2019d try to push the two of you together, especially since you both seemed to think so much alike. After spending the evening with him you wouldn\u2019t be opposed. Tony was interested in you that you were sure of. And compared to how you\u2019d felt when the other guy had made advances, it was totally different now. Whereas he had no concept of boundaries or even what the word 'no\u2019 meant, it wasn\u2019t like that with Tony. You trusted he\u2019d respect whatever boundaries you set up, professional or otherwise without even thinking twice about it. You were comfortable around him too. It had been some time since you\u2019d felt so at ease and happy.</p><p>So, yeah, you were maybe definitely interested in Tony too.</p><p>Why wait for your Mom to get involved then?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a hell of a cook too. When I won she offered to take me out somewhere to eat, but all I wanted was some of her grilled cheese and a piece of her apple pie. Actually made sure I brought a book of her recipes with me when I moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s been forever since I\u2019ve had a Mom-approved meal. Always something special about the recipes, y'know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I was actually planning on making something of hers tomorrow. Won\u2019t be as good as her making it herself, but I\u2019m not bad. You could come try some if you wanted.\u201d Wow. Smooth.</p><p>Tony looked at you, eyebrows raised and an amused smile, \u201cI\u2019d love to, but doesn\u2019t very professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t really meant to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. What time should I bring the wine?\u201d</p><p>Huffing a small sigh of relief, you matched his smile. \u201cSay seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there on the dot.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p><b>1 Year Later </b></p><p>Tony was up on stage, commanding the attention of journalists and experts, and who knew what else. You\u2019d left the arrangements of who to invite to those who actually knew what they were doing. You were too busy focusing on not throwing up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, love,\u201d your Mom was next to you, holding your hand in hers reassuringly. You needed to thank Tony again later for flying her in as a surprise for tonight.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I mess up? Tony\u2019s poured so much into this\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. You have your speech on your tablet thing don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, it\u2019s all written down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll have no problem. This is what you\u2019ve been waiting for, I know you\u2019ll be amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow for why we\u2019re all here. The big reveal! Exciting! We\u2019ve all had fitness trackers, right? Little bands on our wrists that tell us how many steps we\u2019ve taken or what our heart rate is, but what if those bands could do more? What if they could tell us everything about our health? What if they could test our blood and scan us while we slept and spotted any anomalies? What if we could do away with expensive tests and long waiting times, and have all health updates uploaded straight to your patient file? Well, ladies and gents, I\u2019m here to tell you that we\u2019re no longer in a world of 'what-ifs\u2019. That time is now. Stark Industries is proud to announce a new step forward in health care. Introducing, Sanus.\u201d</p><p>On the stage, Tony finished his opening speech and stepped to one side as the introductory advert for your wrist band played to the crowd.</p><p>It was impossible to tell what the initial reaction was, but there was applause when it came to an end that sounded promising.</p><p>\u201cFantastic, huh?\u201d Tony said as he walked back out to the center of the stage. \u201cIron Man technology adapted so everyone can carry it around on their wrists. Say goodbye to self-diagnosing, or worrying that a random symptom could be more. Concerned one thing could be the start of something more? Sanus can check it out and ease your mind. Or if, there if there is something, let you and your Doctor know so you can work together to get you better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver think that maybe you\u2019re being overlooked? Know in your gut you\u2019re sick but can\u2019t find anyone to take you seriously? Now you have the tool to find that evidence and get the diagnosis you need and the treatment you deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSanus is cost-effective and easy to use. You can communicate by voice or with just a few taps on the app it comes with. And don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s perfectly secure. Only you and you alone can dictate who has access to your information and if you want a person removed? Just tell Sanus and they\u2019ll be gone in seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering how this is possible. After all the Iron Man suit is a lot bigger than this nifty little band. I\u2019d love to take the credit for it all, I really would. But this feat of ingenuity was not down to me. I\u2019d like to introduce you to the person capable of such brilliance though. Here to explain all the geeky techy bits about how everything works, please welcome Doctor Y/N Y/L/N.\u201d</p><p>Tony gestured towards you as the crowd applauded again and your Mom squeezed your hand a final time before letting you go to walk onto the stage. Tony met you in the middle, an arm coming behind you to guide you to the podium that was rising up.</p><p>'You got this\u2019 he mouthed with a grin and a wink, joining in with the applause as he took a few steps back.</p><p>Setting your tablet down, you looked out across the crowd. You couldn\u2019t make out anyone, the bright lights of the stage blocking them all out. You could hear them though as the clapping came to a stop. The clicks of cameras and the shuffling of feet. So many years of brainstorming and scrapping calculations to get something close to a valid idea. And now you were here, introducing it to the world and explaining everything. No time to fuck up now.</p><p>You started talking, continuously glancing down at speech in front of you at first. Yet as you went on, your confidence grew, and you found yourself looking down less and less, the words coming with ease. You spoke of where the idea came from, the work you\u2019d put in to make it viable, Tony\u2019s help and encouragement. Everything. Plenty probably wouldn\u2019t understand the finer details, but plenty would too.</p><p>There was a third round of applause when you were done, led by Tony who came back over to join you. The lights dimmed a little just enough for you to be able to make out some of the people. There were hundreds, if not over a thousand people watching.</p><p>Tony opened up the floor to questions of which there were plenty, and together you managed to get through them. Having him next to you bolstered your confidence further. It was contagious. That and the positive excitement was exhilarating. To see so many people wanting to know more about your own creation\u2026</p><p>You exited the stage together, Tony taking your hand as you descended the few steps. It wasn\u2019t needed, but it was welcome.</p><p>Tony caught you by surprise, pulling you close and picking you up from the floor, spinning you both around. \u201cYou killed it, babe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have done it without you, old man,\u201d you laughed when he set you down.</p><p>\u201cLess of the old, please!\u201d Tony grabbed you by the waist before you could get away, ignoring your squawk of protest as he held on tight. \u201cSay sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least wait until you\u2019re somewhere private the both of you.\u201d Your mom appeared, and Tony let you go so you could go to her and hug her. \u201cYou were amazing, sweetheart. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She kissed your cheek and pulled back. \u201cYou two should home and celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could come with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Too late for me. I\u2019m going back to the hotel for some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Happy drive you, Mrs. Y/L/N,\u201d Tony said, slipping his arm around your waist again.</p><p>\u201cThank you, son. I\u2019ll see you both for lunch tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse. Night, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d She kissed your cheek again, and then Tony\u2019s before grabbing her things and leaving.</p><p>\u201cThank you for bringing her out here,\u201d you smiled, wrapping your arms around Tony\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cShe needed to be here for tonight.\u201d Tony\u2019s hands settled on your hips as he leaned in for a kiss. \u201cWhat do you feel like doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we head to the after party thing Pepper\u2019s putting on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. She knows me well enough not to expect me.\u201d</p><p>You laughed. \u201cYou make an excellent point, Mr. Stark. What d'you say we head home and have our own private party then?\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned, \u201cI like the way you think, Dr. Y/L/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike? Not love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove too. Definitely, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Love you too.\u201d</p><p>Together you started to make your way to the quiet exit that had been set aside, hand in hand. \u201cHave I told you yet how good you look in that outfit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can show me what you think when we get home.\u201d</p><p>Tony opened the car door and followed you inside. \u201cGod, I really do love you.\u201d</p><p>Tagging: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF71hfhHEtE-O_-TMp9vPcg\" target=\"_blank\">@medicatemedrmccoy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXaDHpHMy0K39hd6MSlaRig\" target=\"_blank\">@thefanficfaerie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRCGtcrdAjAQWHH8wbalOw\" target=\"_blank\">@sidskywrote</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUQ8uRajg_cCooNltZ66TUg\" target=\"_blank\">@star-trekkin-across-theuniverse</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5U_u9GKDf0_WMKwI1CjkQ\" target=\"_blank\">@feelmyroarrrr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDTjUsNHMkwS8_QZ_5CSNzA\" target=\"_blank\">@ironwinterhawk</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpl5mIi4heCIbzdA984sAhg\" target=\"_blank\">@weasleyisourjedi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNLNsVwPe9B9L0t5skhE6_Q\" target=\"_blank\">@ketchavies-thoorrrr666</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTcYrJNoBbgZ1AP-UpWNfoQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nishanki1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gB-qc4i4kmz68r0WioGkw\" target=\"_blank\">@biglouche</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0eusIrNkdOM1Uqp-0qI5uw\" target=\"_blank\">@stephn-prkr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlfbP0dov72ynqmpGE7OBGA\" target=\"_blank\">@teddybluesclues</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7CsHBGCX8RYJgYJ4m3WnHQ\" target=\"_blank\">@wildefire</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAOZA_cBpLE5dXme-HS8Mfw\" target=\"_blank\">@magnetosgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMBhbyeirqdGDuFzAjCs31g\" target=\"_blank\">@bolontiku</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\" target=\"_blank\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH4ETjHt_Z1V1VA02FIyAQg\" target=\"_blank\">@saphirepearl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzEJqCW1j6ZBjCaheI0fTNw\" target=\"_blank\">@1d-killed-me</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBvPZvsc4FHgzYHQ5u5Bw5A\" target=\"_blank\">@akxra-amxn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7YoIKztmyr4NJk0Y7_CNXw\" target=\"_blank\">@sleep-i-ness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfm8Zt1szg9DaF2KS8-TYeQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thoughtfulllamaoperatoralien</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m44fkKk8XaRIOLxQV-4swwA\" target=\"_blank\">@suzen23smith</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX1fiwIGDMWTzeSU4b1Llow\" target=\"_blank\">@arromite</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLmxhACum2ZZjXo9i_69gJw\" target=\"_blank\">@valiisi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUVoioJqQCpfzOr_DeoBFAQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starmission</a>\u00a0\u00a0</p></p>",

Until one night Tony Stark himself shows up at your door, saying he needs your help.</p><p><b>A/N:</b> My first Tony fic ahhhhh! I really hope you guys enjoy it, and please let me know what you think! I already have another one-shot idea, so feedback will help me know if you want it! :)</p><p><br /></p><p>It had been a month since you&rsquo;d officially left your job at Stark Industries. A whole month and you still missed it and the work you did there, low level as you were. But staying there hadn&rsquo;t been a possibility either. </p><p>It had started a few months before. One of your coworkers in your lab decided he fancied you and refused to accept you didn&rsquo;t like him in return. It hadn&rsquo;t been too bad at first, annoying but not that bad. Mostly just him asking you out every few days, a few inappropriate comments about your looks here and there, but not enough for you to want to raise any issues. But then your lab threw a party for another colleague&rsquo;s birthday, complete with alcohol. </p><p>He&rsquo;d had too much and followed you into the bathroom. Cornering you in one of the stalls, he&rsquo;d refused to move or stop with the remarks about how much he wanted you and how tired he was off waiting. </p><p>Nothing happened in the end. Someone else came in and spooked him away. But it was more than you could handle. More than you should have had to handle. So you&rsquo;d filed a complaint with your supervisor. Who promptly dismissed it since he hadn&rsquo;t actually done anything. </p><p>You took it higher again to the floor manager. He called you in for a meeting, and later that day you handed in your resignation. He&rsquo;d been even worse than the others, and any thoughts about going higher again disappeared. It wasn&rsquo;t worth the stress or the shitty way it made you feel. </p><p>You&rsquo;d worked your notice and left. </p><p>Now you just needed to find a new job. Which was surprisingly harder than you&rsquo;d anticipated. Most hadn&rsquo;t even called you back. Why you didn&rsquo;t know. You were plenty qualified, and it was hard to get better previous experience than working at Stark Industries. </p><p>Sprawled on the sofa in your apartment, you scrolled through potential jobs on your tablet. The savings in your bank were starting to dwindle, and you were faced with the choice of looking for a lesser job or leaving New York altogether. You didn&rsquo;t want either. You&rsquo;d worked hard to get to New York, but you didn&rsquo;t want to get stuck at a job you hated either. </p><p>A knock on your door startled you from your miserable dwelling. You were tempted to ignore it, but then the person on the other side knocked again, and curiosity got the better of you. Who would come knocking at eight on a Thursday night? </p><p>Apparently Tony fucking Stark would.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N Y/L/N?&rdquo; He asked, pocketing his sunglasses once you opened the door. </p><p>For an MIT graduate with two doctorates to your name, it took your brain an embarrassingly long time time to process what was going on and form actual words. &ldquo;Uhh&hellip;yeah. Yes. Sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great! Need to talk to you. May I?&rdquo; Stark gestured to the inside of your apartment. </p><p>You nodded dumbly, stepping aside to let him in. &ldquo;C-can I get you something to drink, sir?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, thanks. I can&rsquo;t stay too long,&rdquo; he said, taking a look around him. It was the first time you&rsquo;d really realized what a mess the whole place was. There were pieces of paper with notes and calculations for random things pinned up everywhere, covering most of the wall space. Then there were the couple of take-out cartons you hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to recycling yet, and the pile of thankfully clean laundry, that was stacked on a chair waiting to get put away. Stark didn&rsquo;t seem bothered by any of it though, but then he seemed more focused on the papers anyway. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to the point,&rdquo; he said, turning to face you again. &ldquo;You left my company and I&rsquo;m here to get you back.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;d been no time to really consider why he was here, but you knew for certain that wouldn&rsquo;t have even made the list. &ldquo;You want me back?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Stark pulled his phone from his pocket and tapped a couple buttons before showing you the screen. You recognized the blueprint on it immediately. &ldquo;Your design right?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I submitted it just before I left.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good. Amazing, really. I was stunned when I came across it. A little embarrassed I hadn&rsquo;t thought to use Iron Man tech like that, but that&rsquo;s just between you and me.&rdquo; Stark winked at you, switching off the screen again. &ldquo;I made it a research priority, something like this needs to be out there, but no one&rsquo;s been able to figure out how to fit that amount of tech into something so small. I&rsquo;ve had some ideas, but none have looked promising for long term viability.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you want to know if I know how to do it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;In theory. I&rsquo;ve not run any simulations.&rdquo;</p><p>Stark nodded. &ldquo;Theory is more than anyone else has come up with. Next question, what&rsquo;ll it take for you to come back? More money? Apartment upgrade? Name it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t leave because I wasn&rsquo;t earning enough, or anything like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why did you?&rdquo; </p><p>You bit the inside of your cheek, wondering what you should say. Stark was being overwhelmingly complimentary, but that didn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;d stay that way. He was another man after all. &ldquo;The people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The people? Gonna have to elaborate there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably be easier to pull the audio recording of Office 3A from February eighteenth. I was in a meeting with Pete and explained everything.&rdquo; It was the best solution you could think of. You didn&rsquo;t want to talk through everything again, and if he heard it himself at least he&rsquo;d believe you. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Jarvis, locate audio file of Peter Jamesons office on February eighteenth, 2019.&rdquo; Stark spoke into his phone, which was pretty unexpected. </p><p><i>Audio file found. Would you like to listen to the playback from a specific time?</i></p><p>Stark looked towards you, holding the phone forwards in a gesture to speak. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, 1 pm?&rdquo; </p><p><i>Playing Office 3A audio from 1 pm</i></p><p>You were expecting it, but it still gave you a shock when your own voice and that of Peter&rsquo;s, the floor managers, started to speak from Starks phone.</p><p>Most of it was you retelling your story about the coworker and the bathroom, and then your supervisor&rsquo;s dismissal of it.</p><p><i>&ldquo;What were you wearing?&rdquo; Pete asked.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;At the party, what were you wearing?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&hellip;it was straight after work. It was similar to this.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, those pants are very form fitting. And that shirt could be revealing if you were to bend over enough.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sir, are you saying I asked for it?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Not ask. But perhaps subconsciously you thought to invite it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I can promise you that wasn&rsquo;t the case.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Either way, you should&rsquo;ve expected something like this to happen.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&hellip;I should have?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a woman and this is a male-dominated environment. Of course, you should&rsquo;ve expected romantic advances.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not appropriate.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The truth isn&rsquo;t appropriate? Sweetheart, if you wanted to avoid this bother then you should&rsquo;ve stayed at home. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d exceed phenomenally in a kitchen.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m exceeding here.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you? Or did you get the job because of some diversity laws?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I got the job because I was the top of all my classes, earned two PhDs in some of the most difficult subjects and am one of the best in my field!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No need to get emotional. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re plenty smart. Just not smart enough to understand the natural way of things.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I take this means you&rsquo;re dismissing my complaint?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Doctor Grant did nothing wrong in my eyes, Ms. Y/L/N.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Fine. Then I want to take it higher.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Higher? I wouldn&rsquo;t advise that.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The ones higher don&rsquo;t like to be bothered with such trivial matters. They won&rsquo;t be happy telling you the same thing you&rsquo;ve been told twice already. Might not end well for you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you suggesting I&rsquo;ll be fired for reporting a case of harassment?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not suggesting anything, Ms.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;d thank you for your time, but I don&rsquo;t want to. You&rsquo;ll have my resignation by the end of the day.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; you said quietly when you heard the sound of a door closing, signaling that you left the office, and Jarvis stopped the recording.</p><p>Tony hadn&rsquo;t spoken a word as you listened, but his face said enough. He was angry, quiet but furious.</p><p>Sir, would you like me to inform Miss. Potts over this issue?</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going to deal with this personally. We&rsquo;ll discuss it later, Jarvis.&rdquo;</p><p>Yes, sir.</p><p>Stark tucked his phone away and looked back at you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. You shouldn&rsquo;t have had to deal with that.&rdquo;</p><p>Crossing your arms over your chest, you shrugged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not. We&rsquo;re meant to be making the world a better place, and we can&rsquo;t do that if our own employees get away with this shit. It&rsquo;s gonna be dealt with, I promise.*</p><p>\"Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>Stark waved his hand through the air. &ldquo;Stop with the &lsquo;sir&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled and nodded. &ldquo;Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s watch chimed and he muttered under his breath. &ldquo;I need to go, but I&rsquo;m not done with you or your work. I want you back working for me. With me. Are you free, say tomorrow night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Only thing I had planned was more job hunting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s unnecessary now. What do you say to coming over and talking final details? All totally professional of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds great. I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Awesome! I&rsquo;ll send someone to get you around six?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grinned, heading to the door before stopping and gesturing to all the papers on your walls. &ldquo;Are all these for your blueprint?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Most. Some are just notes of other ideas. Easier to write them down and get them out of my head, y'know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do. Bring them with you. All of them. I want to know what else goes through that brilliant head of yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. See you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See you.&rdquo;</p><p>With that he was gone, leaving you wondering what the hell had really just happened. Tony Stark had been in your home, admitted the shit that was going on his own company, promised to fix it, then invited you to an informal business meeting. And what did he mean by working with him?</p><p>The only things you knew for sure were that you&rsquo;d happily to return to work at Stark Industries in whatever capacity if you were taken seriously and that you were definitely excited for the next night.</p><p>~</p><p>The rest of your night was spent pulling down all your notes and trying to put them in some kind of order. By the time you&rsquo;d actually made it your bed, it well into the early am, and by the time you woke up again, it was into the later am.</p><p>You were a modern, 21st-century woman, so of course, the first thing you did was grab your phone to check everything that was going on.</p><p>Stark Industries was trending.</p><p>Tony Stark himself had issued a statement barely an hour ago, stating that it had come to his attention that several members of staff were responsible for acts of gross misconduct. He went on to say that not only had said staff been removed from the company, an internal investigation was also being launched in order to root out any other bad seeds, and completely overhaul the way complaints and issues were raised and dealt with.</p><p>He&rsquo;d said he was going to deal with it, but this, this you hadn&rsquo;t expected. Not this fast and not at this scale. It was satisfying to know you&rsquo;d finally been taken seriously.</p><p>It was a good way to start the day.</p><p>The time went by quick. Most of it was spent catching up on chores and doing a final sort through of your notes. By the time it came to get ready, you were surprisingly not nervous. You should&rsquo;ve been, you thought. You were spending the evening with Tony Stark. It was just business, he said that himself, but it was still Tony Stark, and it was still one on one. Yet you weren&rsquo;t. For whatever reason, you felt at ease around him, and the only thing you felt was excitement.</p><p>You kept your clothes to business casual, not wanting to overdo it, but not wanting to look like you didn&rsquo;t care either.</p><p>Dead on six, there was a knock on your door, and sure enough, a driver was waiting to take you to Tony.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t that long a ride before you were stepping inside his living space at Stark Tower.</p><p><i>Welcome Dr. Y/L/N. Mr. Stark is currently downstairs in his lab, but he&rsquo;ll be up momentarily. Please, take a seat and make yourself comfortable. </i></p><p>The voice nearly made you jump out of your skin. It was the same one that spoke out of Tony&rsquo;s phone yesterday.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; you said, taking a moment to look around as you walked. &ldquo;Who&hellip;who are you?&rsquo;</p><p><i>My name is Jarvis. A UI Mr. Stark created to run several aspects of his business and life. If I can be of assistance to you at any point, please do not hesitate to ask.</i></p><p>\"Right, thank you.&rdquo; You&rsquo;d figured out you were talking to a computer, but it was still a shock to talk to one that came across so&hellip;human.</p><p>You walked into the main living area, setting your bag of notes down on the sofa. There was a pizza box sitting on the table, the brand familiar. It was the same name that was on the empty box in your kitchen yesterday. It wasn&rsquo;t all that expensive though, so the chances of someone like Tony buying it himself were slim. Which meant he&rsquo;d seen it and taken note.</p><p>It was a nice thought.</p><p>Wandering over to the window, you looked out across the city. It was dark by now, and the lights of New York were shining and twinkling below you.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a bad view, huh?&rdquo; Tony came up next to you, looking out the window too.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo; Tony was looking at you as he spoke.</p><p>Turning away from the view, you faced him. &ldquo;I saw what you did this morning. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing to thank. It needed to be done.&rdquo; Tony raised an arm gesturing to the sofa. &ldquo;Have a seat. Drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. Sounds good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me guess&hellip;Jack and coke?&rdquo; Tony walked over the bar, already pulling out two tumblers.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; You sat on the sofa, retrieving your bag and starting to pull out some of your notes. It was surprising how natural it felt being here. It was more like hanging out with a friend than one of the worlds most famous mean who also happened to be fucking Iron Man.</p><p>&ldquo;Lucky guess?&rdquo; You raised an eyebrow and he laughed. &ldquo;There was a bottle of Jack in the kitchen, and an empty can at the top of the trash. Educated guess then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Observant. I like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Count me flattered.&rdquo; Tony brought the two glasses over and set them down onto the table next to the pizza box.</p><p>&ldquo;You frequent tiny pizza places halfway across the city too or just another feat of observation?&rdquo; You asked, picking up one of the glasses and taking a sip. It was good. Tony knew how to mix a drink.</p><p>&ldquo;Point of tonight was to talk you back into working here, figured some creature comforts wouldn&rsquo;t hurt my efforts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty sure it&rsquo;s already safe to say I&rsquo;ll come back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just because of some pizza and liquor? A woman after my own heart.&rdquo;</p><p>Laughing, you matched his position, leaning against the back of the sofa. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a part of it, yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smiled, the look soft on his face. &ldquo;But seriously, you okay? After everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I spent over a decade getting degrees from places filled with men thinking I shouldn&rsquo;t be there. It&rsquo;ll take more than a few dicks to get me. Not worth the time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beats me how they even got hired. We need more staff like you and me, geniuses, not their prehistoric butts.&rdquo;</p><p>Geniuses. Plural. He thought you were on the same level. &ldquo;Flattery will get you everywhere, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; you said, putting on a fake posh voice, mainly to deflect how sincere he was being and how you were definitely not sure how to handle it.</p><p>Tony grinned, &ldquo;Everywhere? You are exceptionally intriguing, Dr. Y/L/N.&rdquo; He mimicked your accent, sounding like a terrible version of Jarvis.</p><p>The gentle moment successfully broken, you laughed again, grateful he&rsquo;d taken the cue instead of pushing it. The compliment had been well received, for sure. In fact, you were pretty sure it was the best compliment you could ever be given. It was the quiet concern that had thrown you. He had been worried that you weren&rsquo;t okay. It was both sweet and unexpected, though maybe it shouldn&rsquo;t have been given the events of the morning.</p><p>Tony reached over and flipped the pizza box open, then motioned to the papers sitting next to you. &ldquo;Shall we start?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded, figuring you&rsquo;d begin with the very reason he&rsquo;d asked you over. The blueprints you&rsquo;d left behind in the lab that no one else could get working. It had been an idea you&rsquo;d had for years, one that was never more than an idealistic fantasy until you&rsquo;d started work at Stark Industries. You&rsquo;d been browsing the blueprints of an older version of the Iron Man suit that Tony had released to the labs, and there staring right back at you was the technology you needed to make your idea become reality. Only problem was that you needed to figure out a way to scale it down to a fraction of the size. You&rsquo;d worked on it every day you were allowed to pursue your own individual tech projects rather than focusing on one&rsquo;s already established within the company.</p><p>You told Tony all about it, explained how exactly you were planning to shrink it down and fit it into the main tech itself. The breakthrough had come just days before you left, and there&rsquo;d been no time to see if it&rsquo;d work for certain, so you&rsquo;d taken the notes home with you, just leaving the main design as the company.</p><p>&ldquo;I can see why no one else came up with this. Even I&rsquo;d need to focus on nothing but it to come up with these solutions.&rdquo; Tony was reading through your notes, looking genuinely amazed. &ldquo;Gotta ask though, why didn&rsquo;t you take the design with you? Your ideas are your own until prototypes start getting made.&rdquo;</p><p>You shrugged, &ldquo;I hoped that leaving it in the databases would mean it&rsquo;d get made one day. And that was all I wanted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Commendable. A lot would&rsquo;ve taken it and tried to make a quick buck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They would. I just want to help people and that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what I want to do too. Which is why I want to give you your own lab, your own team, access to newer Iron Man tech, whatever you need to get this done.&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;d been anticipating a promotion, but not to that level. You didn&rsquo;t even know anyone who ran a lab dedicated to just one project. You&rsquo;d heard of people who ran them, but those were scientists who&rsquo;d been working for the company for years, the best of the best.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t even know what to say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How about yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Yes! Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something like this needs to be out there, and I want us to be the one to do it. And I want you to be the one to spearhead it. With things like this I try to be a bit more involved though, so there&rsquo;ll be more stuff like this. Catching up with what&rsquo;s going on one on one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not opposed to that. Especially if there&rsquo;s more pizza involved.&rdquo;.</p><p>Tony threw his head back as he laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll add it into the contract.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case when do I start?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monday work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; Tony clapped his hands together, then grabbed your now empty glasses and went to refill them. &ldquo;To new adventures,&rdquo; he toasted when he returned and passed you the glass back.</p><p>&ldquo;To new adventures.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Feel like telling me what&rsquo;s on the rest of the stuff you bought? Maybe we&rsquo;ll find the next big thing for the future.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doubtful,&rdquo; you chuckled, picking up the notebook you used for general notes and ideas. &ldquo;Most of the stuff in here is just random crap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, sometimes the best things from random crap. Humor me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well since it&rsquo;s you and you did just offer me the job a lifetime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whoever said money can&rsquo;t get you what you want?&rdquo;</p><p>Rolling your eyes with a smile, you grabbed the book and started going through it. A lot of it really was junk, but some, some could maybe turn into something more. Especially if you stayed on in the long run.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t even realize how long you talked about some of the things for. Once you started, you found you couldn&rsquo;t stop, especially when Tony didn&rsquo;t immediately laugh you out of the tower. And it was nice, for once, to get to just talk about all the little things that had popped into your head over the years, rather than focusing on making others ideas a reality.</p><p>When you finally stopped, Tony was silent. Looking up from the book and over to him, you saw him watching you with what could only be described as the human version of the heart eye emoji.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You asked, laughing nervously.</p><p>&ldquo;You really are a genius. This&hellip;this stuff, it&rsquo;s incredible. I have no idea how your brain works to come up with some of this, but I love it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? They&rsquo;re nothing special.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are! God, there are at least five things I can see being not only viable but exceptional, and two I definitely want to look into further because they could make great additions to the next Iron Man upgrade.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Figured I was going to be a one trick pony kinda girl, and the rest of time I&rsquo;d just be backing people up. Group projects and all that stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony had been keeping a respectable distance, but then he slid across the soft material until he was closer to you. He let a hand rest on your forearm, giving you the chance to pull back if you wanted. When you didn&rsquo;t, he smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re incredible. I pulled your file Y/N. I&rsquo;ve seen just how smart you are. You were the best person in that lab hands down, no one else even came close.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled. &ldquo;Thanks. Maybe those dicks did get to me a little.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Screw 'em. If they ever see you again they&rsquo;ll be calling you ma&rsquo; am and begging for some cash to fund some crummy little project, and you&rsquo;ll get the satisfaction of telling them they should go back home to their kitchen.&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t intentional, but you snorted a laugh at that. &ldquo;That would be exceptionally satisfying actually. The look on their faces&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See? Now you have another goal to work towards. One I&rsquo;ll happily help you with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How thoughtful,&rdquo; you grinned, starting to pick up all the papers that had been scattered about throughout the evening. A photo slipped out of the back of the notebook, falling to the ground.</p><p>Tony got to it before you did, picking it up and flipping it over to look at the picture. &ldquo;This you?&rdquo; he asked, gesturing to the little kid in the photo, proudly holding up a robot. Behind the kid was a grown-up woman, holding a large ribbon with a 1 in the center, looking like she couldn&rsquo;t be any prouder.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s me, and that&rsquo;s my Mom. I&rsquo;d just won a local robotics competition. Dad said I was too young to enter, but I wanted to go, so she took me anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your mom sounds pretty special.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is. She always encouraged me when things seemed like too much. And she&rsquo;s the reason why I came up with the band.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. When I was doing my first thesis, she had a health scare. She&rsquo;d been complaining of problems for months, but no one took her seriously, and by the time she was, it was almost too late. She&rsquo;s fine now, but if she&rsquo;d had the band-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten that far.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony handed you the photo and squeezed your hand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to stop shit like that from happening, I promise.*</p><p>\"Damn right we are.&rdquo; You looked down at the photo for a few seconds, making a note to call her in the morning to tell her all the news. She&rsquo;d been worried when you quit, but never once blamed you. To find out now that you&rsquo;d be heading a team and working with Tony would make her whole year.</p><p>She&rsquo;d like Tony. You already knew she&rsquo;d try to push the two of you together, especially since you both seemed to think so much alike. After spending the evening with him you wouldn&rsquo;t be opposed. Tony was interested in you that you were sure of. And compared to how you&rsquo;d felt when the other guy had made advances, it was totally different now. Whereas he had no concept of boundaries or even what the word 'no&rsquo; meant, it wasn&rsquo;t like that with Tony. You trusted he&rsquo;d respect whatever boundaries you set up, professional or otherwise without even thinking twice about it. You were comfortable around him too. It had been some time since you&rsquo;d felt so at ease and happy.</p><p>So, yeah, you were maybe definitely interested in Tony too.</p><p>Why wait for your Mom to get involved then?</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a hell of a cook too. When I won she offered to take me out somewhere to eat, but all I wanted was some of her grilled cheese and a piece of her apple pie. Actually made sure I brought a book of her recipes with me when I moved here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God, it&rsquo;s been forever since I&rsquo;ve had a Mom-approved meal. Always something special about the recipes, y'know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do. I was actually planning on making something of hers tomorrow. Won&rsquo;t be as good as her making it herself, but I&rsquo;m not bad. You could come try some if you wanted.&rdquo; Wow. Smooth.</p><p>Tony looked at you, eyebrows raised and an amused smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to, but doesn&rsquo;t very professional.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t really meant to be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fair enough. What time should I bring the wine?&rdquo;</p><p>Huffing a small sigh of relief, you matched his smile. &ldquo;Say seven?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there on the dot.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p><b>1 Year Later </b></p><p>Tony was up on stage, commanding the attention of journalists and experts, and who knew what else. You&rsquo;d left the arrangements of who to invite to those who actually knew what they were doing. You were too busy focusing on not throwing up.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine, love,&rdquo; your Mom was next to you, holding your hand in hers reassuringly. You needed to thank Tony again later for flying her in as a surprise for tonight.</p><p>&ldquo;What if I mess up? Tony&rsquo;s poured so much into this&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t. You have your speech on your tablet thing don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Yeah, it&rsquo;s all written down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll have no problem. This is what you&rsquo;ve been waiting for, I know you&rsquo;ll be amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now for why we&rsquo;re all here. The big reveal! Exciting! We&rsquo;ve all had fitness trackers, right? Little bands on our wrists that tell us how many steps we&rsquo;ve taken or what our heart rate is, but what if those bands could do more? What if they could tell us everything about our health? What if they could test our blood and scan us while we slept and spotted any anomalies? What if we could do away with expensive tests and long waiting times, and have all health updates uploaded straight to your patient file? Well, ladies and gents, I&rsquo;m here to tell you that we&rsquo;re no longer in a world of 'what-ifs&rsquo;. That time is now. Stark Industries is proud to announce a new step forward in health care. Introducing, Sanus.&rdquo;</p><p>On the stage, Tony finished his opening speech and stepped to one side as the introductory advert for your wrist band played to the crowd.</p><p>It was impossible to tell what the initial reaction was, but there was applause when it came to an end that sounded promising.</p><p>&ldquo;Fantastic, huh?&rdquo; Tony said as he walked back out to the center of the stage. &ldquo;Iron Man technology adapted so everyone can carry it around on their wrists. Say goodbye to self-diagnosing, or worrying that a random symptom could be more. Concerned one thing could be the start of something more? Sanus can check it out and ease your mind. Or if, there if there is something, let you and your Doctor know so you can work together to get you better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ever think that maybe you&rsquo;re being overlooked? Know in your gut you&rsquo;re sick but can&rsquo;t find anyone to take you seriously? Now you have the tool to find that evidence and get the diagnosis you need and the treatment you deserve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sanus is cost-effective and easy to use. You can communicate by voice or with just a few taps on the app it comes with. And don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s perfectly secure. Only you and you alone can dictate who has access to your information and if you want a person removed? Just tell Sanus and they&rsquo;ll be gone in seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re wondering how this is possible. After all the Iron Man suit is a lot bigger than this nifty little band. I&rsquo;d love to take the credit for it all, I really would. But this feat of ingenuity was not down to me. I&rsquo;d like to introduce you to the person capable of such brilliance though. Here to explain all the geeky techy bits about how everything works, please welcome Doctor Y/N Y/L/N.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gestured towards you as the crowd applauded again and your Mom squeezed your hand a final time before letting you go to walk onto the stage. Tony met you in the middle, an arm coming behind you to guide you to the podium that was rising up.</p><p>'You got this&rsquo; he mouthed with a grin and a wink, joining in with the applause as he took a few steps back.</p><p>Setting your tablet down, you looked out across the crowd. You couldn&rsquo;t make out anyone, the bright lights of the stage blocking them all out. You could hear them though as the clapping came to a stop. The clicks of cameras and the shuffling of feet. So many years of brainstorming and scrapping calculations to get something close to a valid idea. And now you were here, introducing it to the world and explaining everything. No time to fuck up now.</p><p>You started talking, continuously glancing down at speech in front of you at first. Yet as you went on, your confidence grew, and you found yourself looking down less and less, the words coming with ease. You spoke of where the idea came from, the work you&rsquo;d put in to make it viable, Tony&rsquo;s help and encouragement. Everything. Plenty probably wouldn&rsquo;t understand the finer details, but plenty would too.</p><p>There was a third round of applause when you were done, led by Tony who came back over to join you. The lights dimmed a little just enough for you to be able to make out some of the people. There were hundreds, if not over a thousand people watching.</p><p>Tony opened up the floor to questions of which there were plenty, and together you managed to get through them. Having him next to you bolstered your confidence further. It was contagious. That and the positive excitement was exhilarating. To see so many people wanting to know more about your own creation&hellip;</p><p>You exited the stage together, Tony taking your hand as you descended the few steps. It wasn&rsquo;t needed, but it was welcome.</p><p>Tony caught you by surprise, pulling you close and picking you up from the floor, spinning you both around. &ldquo;You killed it, babe!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have done it without you, old man,&rdquo; you laughed when he set you down.</p><p>&ldquo;Less of the old, please!&rdquo; Tony grabbed you by the waist before you could get away, ignoring your squawk of protest as he held on tight. &ldquo;Say sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Make me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At least wait until you&rsquo;re somewhere private the both of you.&rdquo; Your mom appeared, and Tony let you go so you could go to her and hug her. &ldquo;You were amazing, sweetheart. I&rsquo;m proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mom.&rdquo;</p><p>She kissed your cheek and pulled back. &ldquo;You two should home and celebrate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could come with us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah. Too late for me. I&rsquo;m going back to the hotel for some sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have Happy drive you, Mrs. Y/L/N,&rdquo; Tony said, slipping his arm around your waist again.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, son. I&rsquo;ll see you both for lunch tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Course. Night, Mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; She kissed your cheek again, and then Tony&rsquo;s before grabbing her things and leaving.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for bringing her out here,&rdquo; you smiled, wrapping your arms around Tony&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;She needed to be here for tonight.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s hands settled on your hips as he leaned in for a kiss. &ldquo;What do you feel like doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we head to the after party thing Pepper&rsquo;s putting on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah. She knows me well enough not to expect me.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed. &ldquo;You make an excellent point, Mr. Stark. What d'you say we head home and have our own private party then?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grinned, &ldquo;I like the way you think, Dr. Y/L/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like? Not love?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love too. Definitely, love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>Together you started to make your way to the quiet exit that had been set aside, hand in hand. &ldquo;Have I told you yet how good you look in that outfit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, but you can show me what you think when we get home.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony opened the car door and followed you inside. &ldquo;God, I really do love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tagging: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF71hfhHEtE-O_-TMp9vPcg\" target=\"_blank\">@medicatemedrmccoy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXaDHpHMy0K39hd6MSlaRig\" target=\"_blank\">@thefanficfaerie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRCGtcrdAjAQWHH8wbalOw\" target=\"_blank\">@sidskywrote</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUQ8uRajg_cCooNltZ66TUg\" target=\"_blank\">@star-trekkin-across-theuniverse</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5U_u9GKDf0_WMKwI1CjkQ\" target=\"_blank\">@feelmyroarrrr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDTjUsNHMkwS8_QZ_5CSNzA\" target=\"_blank\">@ironwinterhawk</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpl5mIi4heCIbzdA984sAhg\" target=\"_blank\">@weasleyisourjedi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNLNsVwPe9B9L0t5skhE6_Q\" target=\"_blank\">@ketchavies-thoorrrr666</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTcYrJNoBbgZ1AP-UpWNfoQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nishanki1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gB-qc4i4kmz68r0WioGkw\" target=\"_blank\">@biglouche</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0eusIrNkdOM1Uqp-0qI5uw\" target=\"_blank\">@stephn-prkr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlfbP0dov72ynqmpGE7OBGA\" target=\"_blank\">@teddybluesclues</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7CsHBGCX8RYJgYJ4m3WnHQ\" target=\"_blank\">@wildefire</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAOZA_cBpLE5dXme-HS8Mfw\" target=\"_blank\">@magnetosgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMBhbyeirqdGDuFzAjCs31g\" target=\"_blank\">@bolontiku</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH1VmxgP16D6lxvSlpEDAng\" target=\"_blank\">@startrekkingaroundasgard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH4ETjHt_Z1V1VA02FIyAQg\" target=\"_blank\">@saphirepearl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzEJqCW1j6ZBjCaheI0fTNw\" target=\"_blank\">@1d-killed-me</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBvPZvsc4FHgzYHQ5u5Bw5A\" target=\"_blank\">@akxra-amxn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7YoIKztmyr4NJk0Y7_CNXw\" target=\"_blank\">@sleep-i-ness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfm8Zt1szg9DaF2KS8-TYeQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thoughtfulllamaoperatoralien</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m44fkKk8XaRIOLxQV-4swwA\" target=\"_blank\">@suzen23smith</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX1fiwIGDMWTzeSU4b1Llow\" target=\"_blank\">@arromite</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLmxhACum2ZZjXo9i_69gJw\" target=\"_blank\">@valiisi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUVoioJqQCpfzOr_DeoBFAQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starmission</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p>",

I really hope you guys enjoy it, and please let me know what you think! I already have another one-shot idea, so feedback will help me know if you want it! :)</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>It had been a month since you&rsquo;d officially left your job at Stark Industries. A whole month and you still missed it and the work you did there, low level as you were. But staying there hadn&rsquo;t been a possibility either. </p>\n<p>It had started a few months before. One of your coworkers in your lab decided he fancied you and refused to accept you didn&rsquo;t like him in return. It hadn&rsquo;t been too bad at first, annoying but not that bad. Mostly just him asking you out every few days, a few inappropriate comments about your looks here and there, but not enough for you to want to raise any issues. But then your lab threw a party for another colleague&rsquo;s birthday, complete with alcohol. </p>\n<p>He&rsquo;d had too much and followed you into the bathroom. Cornering you in one of the stalls, he&rsquo;d refused to move or stop with the remarks about how much he wanted you and how tired he was off waiting. </p>\n<p>Nothing happened in the end. Someone else came in and spooked him away. But it was more than you could handle. More than you should have had to handle. So you&rsquo;d filed a complaint with your supervisor. Who promptly dismissed it since he hadn&rsquo;t actually done anything. </p>\n<p>You took it higher again to the floor manager. He called you in for a meeting, and later that day you handed in your resignation. He&rsquo;d been even worse than the others, and any thoughts about going higher again disappeared. It wasn&rsquo;t worth the stress or the shitty way it made you feel. </p>\n<p>You&rsquo;d worked your notice and left. </p>\n<p>Now you just needed to find a new job. Which was surprisingly harder than you&rsquo;d anticipated. Most hadn&rsquo;t even called you back. Why you didn&rsquo;t know. You were plenty qualified, and it was hard to get better previous experience than working at Stark Industries. </p>\n<p>Sprawled on the sofa in your apartment, you scrolled through potential jobs on your tablet. The savings in your bank were starting to dwindle, and you were faced with the choice of looking for a lesser job or leaving New York altogether. You didn&rsquo;t want either. You&rsquo;d worked hard to get to New York, but you didn&rsquo;t want to get stuck at a job you hated either. </p>\n<p>A knock on your door startled you from your miserable dwelling. You were tempted to ignore it, but then the person on the other side knocked again, and curiosity got the better of you. Who would come knocking at eight on a Thursday night? </p>\n<p>Apparently Tony fucking Stark would.</p>\n</p>",

Memories of the previous night came flooding back to her in a flashback sequence. Her eyes darted back at the bed in which he slept peacefully, she could see his back, even though in his relaxed state, she still could see the definition of the muscles of his back. The Egyptian cotton sheets covered his firm backside, after the night\u2019s exploits, it seemed like he couldn\u2019t be bothered to cover up, not that he needed to.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>She looked at her phone. </p><p><b><i>8:00 AM</i></b></p><p>Several unread texts. One by her husband, and five by Natasha, all at different times. She could hear her voice through her texts, concern mixed with her usual wittiness. </p><p><i>\u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Your husband called and I covered for you.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m serious, I\u2019m getting worried.\u2019 \u2018Wherever you are please be safe.\u2019 \u2018It must be serious if you lied to Tony.\u2019 </i></p><p>Tony. She was lying to him. She didn\u2019t know how to feel about it, seeing as he was constantly disloyal to her. And she knew that the ones she knew about weren\u2019t all. There was more to his exploits, but she never dared to ask. The thing was, she couldn\u2019t care less about what he would\u2019ve said. Because for once in a long time, she felt wanted, desired. </p><p>And she felt like this for the past two weeks, James had been treating her like a queen. The weekends were her favorite, because that was when she got to take her time with him. Each day they\u2019d go to a New York landmark and try to defile it in someway, so they\u2019d have a pleasant memory of it. Somehow it was exciting, as if she was a young girl again. And with James, every moment was exhilarating. </p><p>As he spent more time with her, giving her his full attention, the parties slowly stopped. Billionaire\u2019s Row stopped being full of crowds of people, waiting to get in the biggest party in New York. It was an unnatural phenomenon to the New Yorkers who spent all their time there. </p><p>People who had flown in from other states, even countries only for the party, had to fly back, unsure of what to do without the party. The lights turned off in all the floors, as they made not much use without ongoing parties, making people wonder what had happened to the mysterious reclusive billionaire. </p><p>\u201cYou leavin\u2019 so early?\u201d His voice asked groggily, and yet it still managed to be sexy. He pushed his hair back, his eyes were barely open, as he and just woken up. </p><p>\u201cI was just getting dressed. I have a home to go to.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut this is your home.\u201d He said, as he sat up the bed, revealing his pectoral muscles which made her weak in the knees. </p><p>\u201cI meant my other home. To my daughter, my\u2026 husband.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go to MOMA today.\u201d He immediately changed subject. He hated to think that she was already taken by someone else. In fact he liked to avoid the subject all together. </p><p>\u201cMOMA?\u201d She looked at him, cocking an eyebrow. \u201cAre you telling me we\u2019re going to defile one of the world\u2019s best modern art museums?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant for the art. I\u2019ve made a lot of donations to the museum, it\u2019d be nice to actually see what they did with it.\u201d </p><p>James unlike her husband, had a penchant for the arts, so much he had invested in so many art projects, and funded art schools. There was something about a man who dedicated so much time in something he believed in, that got her hot. So she had no problem with agreeing to spend a little more time with him. </p><p>She took out an Ala\u00efa dress, amongst the selection of clothing he had his team carefully select for her, from the large wardrobe. She liked the life Bucky was giving to her, it made her feel younger, and more alive. Sexy and daring were something she hadn\u2019t felt in ages, with her vanilla life with Tony, she was constricted in a life her parents had planned out for her. With Bucky, everything was different. He made her feel wanted, feeding her Ossetra caviar for brunch and sipping Mo\u00ebt Chandon while eating chocolate covered strawberries on the rooftop. </p><p>\u201cYou look gorgeous.\u201d She saw his reflection in the mirror, water dripping down his chest. Y/N had to take a moment to process what had happened the night before. </p><p>Another night, amongst the many they had already spent together. If she closed her eyes, she could feel everything she had felt. Every kiss or touch, that made her whimper beneath him. His tie gently wrapped around her eyes, heightened every feeling he gave her. His hands gently roaming down from her bare breasts, to her waist, all the way down to her hips.</p><p>\u201cSo you ready for MOMA doll?\u201d He asked as he snapped her out of her impure thoughts, already dressed. </p><p>\u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be. Now let me finish getting ready, I\u2019ll doubt I\u2019ll do so when you\u2019re here looking like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not tempt me.\u201d He said in his deep voice, his hands were on her shoulders, his lips so dangerously close to her ear. </p><p>\u201cI would never.\u201d </p><p>A statement she had said a couple of times in the past weeks, and had not quite fulfilled, due to Bucky looking always the way he did. </p><p>\u201cCome on, James. I don\u2019t want to miss a second of it.\u201d She said excitedly, as she rushed towards the museum entrance. It was times like that, she reminded him most of the Y/N he had met all those years ago. The same Y/N he had kept in his heart and mind all those years. </p><p>Y/N waited for him to catch up to her, and then she reached out for his hand, taking him by surprise. It was the first time she had held his hand in public. Sure, she was disguised, with a foulard wrapped around her head and a pair of big sunglasses, but it warmed his heart.</p><p>They politely greeted the people who worked there, at the entrance, and made their way to the galleries. It was a hall, full of bright colored canvas paintings. He watched her, as she slowly walked up to one of them, her dainty steps echoing throughout the room with tempo. Stopping to analyze every brushstroke and little detail, by tilting down her sunglasses. </p><p>\u201cI like this one.\u201d She said, as she continued to admire it. Her eyes gleamed with admiration, the edges of her lips curling up. </p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t say anything, for fear that he would ruin the moment. </p><p>She hurriedly led him to a video installation, a dark room, with a screen projecting a video which was a political commentary in form of stop motion animation. In there, she could spot a lonely bench, for them to sit on, so she guided him towards it, and they sat there silently. <br/><br/>As intriguing the video was, they couldn\u2019t help but notice they were finally alone. Alone in a dark room, with a fairly loud video playing in the background. His heartbeat quickened at the thought of being so close to her. They had been close many times before, but that was just what he felt when he was near her. He would have married her, if he was ever given the chance. <br/><br/>He felt her gently squeeze his hand, and he turned to her. She was looking at him. Her face lit up by the screen and nothing else, she had taken off her disguise, letting him see her face. The beautiful face he had fallen in love with. <br/><br/>\u201cIn here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a kiss.\u201d She whispered, an innocent smile appearing on her lips. He couldn\u2019t resist her when she did that.</p><p>\u201cDo you promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, you just have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>Their lips touched just for a second before pulling away. There was such mischief behind her eyes, there was no way she was just going to kiss him. She pulled him back in, this time, it was hungry, passionate. Bucky could taste the hint of ros\u00e8 mixed with the artificial taste of her lipstick, he was sure was smeared on his lips as well as hers.</p><p>Her hand moved to his thigh, he glanced at her, but her eyes were still fixed on the screen where the video was still playing. His cock stiffened at the thought of her touching and taking him right there. They were alone, however there was a chance anyone would have joined them in that room. That possibility dampened her panties,</p><p>Y/N swiftly wrapped her arms around his neck and climbed onto his lap, all while donning an all too knowing look. She knew exactly what she was doing to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game doll.\u201d He warned.</p><p>\u201cAm I now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll behave if you keep doing that\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you waiting for?\u201d She sinfully whispered in his year. \u201cLet\u2019s misbehave.\u201d</p><p>Before he could say another word, she was no longer on him, rather down on her knees in front of him, teasingly palming his erection through his pants.</p><p>Her fingers pulled down his zipper, and it took everything in him for Bucky to not let out anything more than a hiss when he felt her hand around him.</p><p>The feeling of her soft warm hand around his cock made him shudder in surprise, as she proceeded to stroke him a couple times, he tried to concentrate on something else, such as the flashing images on the screen. However, as she dragged her hand up again, \u00a0he swore he could\u2019ve just blown his load right then and there when she licked the bead of precum from the tip, before slowly wrapping her soft lips around him. </p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He managed to say in between gasps and moans. \u201cI want you to look at me.\u201d</p><p>What he didn\u2019t know was she was, she admired his flushed face and eyes closed shut. The way his taut lips parted in the most picturesque way, made her chuckle around his hard cock. She had no idea how he managed to look so good even from that angle. </p><p>Once he had gathered the control to open his eyes, he saw her looking up at him. </p><p>Of all the positions he had seen Y/N in, one of his favorites had to be her on her knees, with her pretty lips around his cock, and her pretty eyes gazing right into his. It was torture, what she was doing, slowly working him up towards his release. </p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t know he could be as frustrated as he was when she released him from her mouth with a lewd pop. She didn\u2019t want him coming, just yet, not until he was inside of her. Y/N stood in front of him, drool dribbling from the corner of her mouth which she sensually wiped away with her finger. As her hands tried to reach for the zipper, but he stopped her. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I want to fuck you like this. There\u2019s no time for that.\u201d </p><p>His hands went to her dress, as he pushed it up to her waist, his fingers went straight to her pussy. He felt the damp spot on her panties, his fingers tracing her pussy lips through the lace. Bucky loved teasing her, it might have been his favourite part. Seeing her gasp and plead, trying to get more friction from rutting her hips to much avail.</p><p>Y/N was now helpless, on his lap, her legs on each side of him, open to take him. His finger circled around her clit, earning some stifled moans from her, while he peppered kisses on the side of her neck. His cock was still painfully hard against her lower back, and she was just waiting for him to act upon his urge. </p><p>\u201cI need you inside of me.\u201d She gasped not being able to wait any longer, her hand trying to reach for his cock. The only thing that were keeping his cock from her were her panties. </p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d He asked teasingly, as he dragged his cock up and down her covered slit. \u00a0</p><p>She nodded, unable to utter complete sentences, not when he was doing that to her. He completely gave in when she let out a lip biting moan, and sunk into her warm pussy. </p><p>Her pussy lips welcoming him each time he eased himself inside her. Dreadfully slowly, so he could feel every inch of her. She gripped him tightly, as she rode him, her back against his chest and her dress bunched up to her hips, panties to one side. He didn\u2019t even bother taking her panties off, he wanted her at all costs, even at the one of not feeling her soft breasts in his large hands. He held her hips and thrusted up into her, harder and deeper, her sweet moans only spurred him on.</p><p>\u201cShh.. sweetheart. You don\u2019t want anyone coming in\u2026\u201d He sucked in her neck, careful to not leave any marks of his. Bucky, with his skillfulness, \u00a0played her body like an instrument, he fucked her pussy hitting the spot that made her toes curl, until both of them were right on edge.</p><p>The thought of being in public, and being caught, sparked something in her, as she turned her head and guided her lips onto his for a short but passionate kiss, as she rode him while he thrusted himself deep inside of her. </p><p>\u201cBucky, I\u2019m going to come.\u201d She announced. </p><p>\u201cCome for me, tell everyone who\u2019s making you feel this good.\u201d</p><p>He felt her pussy tightly clenching his cock, as she felt herself fall apart around him. She chanted his name, her moans making it near to impossible to not make Bucky spank her ass, while still thrusting through her orgasm.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t done with her. Yet.</p><p>\u201cCan you come again for me?\u201d Bucky whispered in her ear sultrily, as he once again started to pick up the pace. She wasn\u2019t still done feeling the aftermaths of her orgasm</p><p>She eagerly nodded, grinding her hips while following his rhythm. He was still hard, it took a lot more for him to come, but as usual, he put her needs first. Her juices already coated his cock, intensifying the noise of his thrusts as he pumped in and out of her.</p><p>\u201cFuck me Bucky, Fuck me-\u201c She repeated like a mantra, as if it as the only phrase she had learnt. </p><p>\u201cFuck Bucky, I\u2019m-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close\u2026\u201d</p><p>Her moans were drowned out by the sinful slapping of their bodies, and his pants, which were quickening by the second. His balls tightened, he was extremely close, letting out a final grunt, before spilling thick ribbons in her. </p><p>Her head rested on his shoulder, as she tried to catch her breath. Y/N could hear her fast heartbeat in her ears, it was loud above the heavy breathing. She stayed there still, as he wrapped his arms around her, his lips planting a gentle kiss on her exposed shoulder. That orgasm he had just given her, she still felt in her pussy. He was still there ever since, keeping his cum deep inside of her. Y/N propped herself on her uneasy feet, still not ready to leave the warmth and comfort of his body. His cum slowly trickling out of her, as she walked to compose herself. She caught Bucky watching her every move intently. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll tire of seeing you.\u201d His face radiated with happiness. \u00a0\u201cKnowing you\u2019re with me. I\u2019ve waited for this moment for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so poetic. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>There they were, the three little words she had been waiting her own husband to tell her, three little words that could\u2019ve changed things for them. Somehow sounded different when uttered by Bucky. She got a strange feeling, which she shook off. She wasn\u2019t used to hearing them.</p><p>\u201cI love you too\u201d</p><p><br/>That feeling only intensified when she kissed him, Y/N never wanted to leave that place. She didn\u2019t want to think it was just a summer affair, bound to end by the start of September. That was what had happened all those years ago. She wasn\u2019t going to wait another decade or so to see him again. <br/><br/>After their tryst at the Museum Of Modern Art, it was incredible how they could go back to their everyday lives as if nothing had happened. They did it often, so they were quite used to it. Y/N would go home and when questioned about her whereabouts that day and the night before, she\u2019d say she had slept over at Natasha\u2019s, not that her husband would have cared that much. He was far too busy in his affairs to even note her absence. </p><p>That night, go occupy his thoughts with something that wasn\u2019t Y/N, Bucky decided to go to the famed gentlemen\u2019s club, to which he had a membership but rarely ever made an appearance. He liked being unknown. He wasn\u2019t one of those millionaires who thrived under the spotlight. After all, he did it all for her. </p><p>\u201cSteve, thanks for meeting me here.\u201d Steve noted that his face was glowing, and directly assumed it was because of her. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, it\u2019s just these past few weeks have been the best I\u2019ve ever lived.\u201d He admitted, rather shyly, even blushing a little. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it was nothing. Though I have seen more articles of you as of late.\u201d </p><p>Bucky knew of the articles. He had seen some while he was on a party hiatus, some of which speculated that he got entangled with the mob, or other senseless rumors he had never paid to mind before. However ever since Y/N started coming to his place, instead of meeting up at the Plaza, they had been photographed twice, on the same day. They had been careless that day, the sun was so hot it was unbearable to stay outdoors. All they could think about was what they were about to do, that they didn\u2019t notice someone sneakily taking a picture of them giggling like teenagers while they were heading in. Y/N was photographed again, heading out three hours later, with a jet black bob cut wig and ridiculously large sunglasses on. </p><p>After which stories surrounding the mysterious James Barnes mainly centered on the mystery woman he was seeing, and how attractive he was, as no one had the face to the name until then. </p><p>\u201cRogers! What are you doing here?\u201d Tony asked incredulously, as he reached his table, followed closely by two other men. He told them to go take their usual seat, while he stood there. Bucky looked at him from head to toe. A little jealous because he knew he was the man Y/N went home to. \u201cI thought gentlemen\u2019s clubs weren\u2019t your \u2018thing\u2019.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always room for change.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo that, I agree.\u201d Tony chuckled, which made Bucky feel nervous. </p><p>\u201cTony, this is my friend, Mr. Barnes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr. Barnes as in the White Wolf?\u201d He chuckled mockingly at the nickname, making Bucky scowl a little. He didn\u2019t like the man at all, not just because he was her husband, but also because he was not a nice man at all. And apparently he had a thing of putting other people down. </p><p>\u201cYes, it is just a silly nickname which the Wakandans have given me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI met your wife.\u201d It sounded more of a threat than a statement. </p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d Tony asked smugly, challenging Bucky to get into detail. </p><p>Tony didn\u2019t like Bucky one bit. It wasn\u2019t so hard to tell. </p><p>Not because he was probably richer than him, but because he knew his wife. It bothered him that when he returned home, she was no longer there, lounging in the living room while reading a book or a magazine. She disappeared in the morning when she got in the town car with her daughter to drop her off at preschool. Nothing he said seemed to faze her any longer, as if she had found herself something to entertain herself with. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it if you both could join us for my next party, this weekend.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI heard you weren\u2019t throwing any parties lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been rather busy.\u201d <i>Screwing your wife</i>. Bucky wanted to add, to wipe off the smug smirk off of his face, but he still had a little self control left. </p><p>\u201cWell then, we\u2019ll be there.\u201d </p><p>There they were, two of the most powerful men in New York, silently battling for dominance. It was the most awkward scene Steve had ever witnessed, the tension could\u2019ve been cut with a butter knife. All for a woman. One didn\u2019t even care much for, and the other wanted her. Though Steve didn\u2019t think Bucky was actually in love with her. And if he had known, maybe things could have been a little different. </p>",

Memories of the previous night came flooding back to her in a flashback sequence. Her eyes darted back at the bed in which he slept peacefully, she could see his back, even though in his relaxed state, she still could see the definition of the muscles of his back. The Egyptian cotton sheets covered his firm backside, after the night\u2019s exploits, it seemed like he couldn\u2019t be bothered to cover up, not that he needed to.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>She looked at her phone. </p><p><b><i>8:00 AM</i></b></p><p>Several unread texts. One by her husband, and five by Natasha, all at different times. She could hear her voice through her texts, concern mixed with her usual wittiness. </p><p><i>\u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Your husband called and I covered for you.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m serious, I\u2019m getting worried.\u2019 \u2018Wherever you are please be safe.\u2019 \u2018It must be serious if you lied to Tony.\u2019 </i></p><p>Tony. She was lying to him. She didn\u2019t know how to feel about it, seeing as he was constantly disloyal to her. And she knew that the ones she knew about weren\u2019t all. There was more to his exploits, but she never dared to ask. The thing was, she couldn\u2019t care less about what he would\u2019ve said. Because for once in a long time, she felt wanted, desired. </p><p>And she felt like this for the past two weeks, James had been treating her like a queen. The weekends were her favorite, because that was when she got to take her time with him. Each day they\u2019d go to a New York landmark and try to defile it in someway, so they\u2019d have a pleasant memory of it. Somehow it was exciting, as if she was a young girl again. And with James, every moment was exhilarating. </p><p>As he spent more time with her, giving her his full attention, the parties slowly stopped. Billionaire\u2019s Row stopped being full of crowds of people, waiting to get in the biggest party in New York. It was an unnatural phenomenon to the New Yorkers who spent all their time there. </p><p>People who had flown in from other states, even countries only for the party, had to fly back, unsure of what to do without the party. The lights turned off in all the floors, as they made not much use without ongoing parties, making people wonder what had happened to the mysterious reclusive billionaire. </p><p>\u201cYou leavin\u2019 so early?\u201d His voice asked groggily, and yet it still managed to be sexy. He pushed his hair back, his eyes were barely open, as he and just woken up. </p><p>\u201cI was just getting dressed. I have a home to go to.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut this is your home.\u201d He said, as he sat up the bed, revealing his pectoral muscles which made her weak in the knees. </p><p>\u201cI meant my other home. To my daughter, my\u2026 husband.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go to MOMA today.\u201d He immediately changed subject. He hated to think that she was already taken by someone else. In fact he liked to avoid the subject all together. </p><p>\u201cMOMA?\u201d She looked at him, cocking an eyebrow. \u201cAre you telling me we\u2019re going to defile one of the world\u2019s best modern art museums?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant for the art. I\u2019ve made a lot of donations to the museum, it\u2019d be nice to actually see what they did with it.\u201d </p><p>James unlike her husband, had a penchant for the arts, so much he had invested in so many art projects, and funded art schools. There was something about a man who dedicated so much time in something he believed in, that got her hot. So she had no problem with agreeing to spend a little more time with him. </p><p>She took out an Ala\u00efa dress, amongst the selection of clothing he had his team carefully select for her, from the large wardrobe. She liked the life Bucky was giving to her, it made her feel younger, and more alive. Sexy and daring were something she hadn\u2019t felt in ages, with her vanilla life with Tony, she was constricted in a life her parents had planned out for her. With Bucky, everything was different. He made her feel wanted, feeding her Ossetra caviar for brunch and sipping Mo\u00ebt Chandon while eating chocolate covered strawberries on the rooftop. </p><p>\u201cYou look gorgeous.\u201d She saw his reflection in the mirror, water dripping down his chest. Y/N had to take a moment to process what had happened the night before. </p><p>Another night, amongst the many they had already spent together. If she closed her eyes, she could feel everything she had felt. Every kiss or touch, that made her whimper beneath him. His tie gently wrapped around her eyes, heightened every feeling he gave her. His hands gently roaming down from her bare breasts, to her waist, all the way down to her hips.</p><p>\u201cSo you ready for MOMA doll?\u201d He asked as he snapped her out of her impure thoughts, already dressed. </p><p>\u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be. Now let me finish getting ready, I\u2019ll doubt I\u2019ll do so when you\u2019re here looking like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not tempt me.\u201d He said in his deep voice, his hands were on her shoulders, his lips so dangerously close to her ear. </p><p>\u201cI would never.\u201d </p><p>A statement she had said a couple of times in the past weeks, and had not quite fulfilled, due to Bucky looking always the way he did. </p><p>\u201cCome on, James. I don\u2019t want to miss a second of it.\u201d She said excitedly, as she rushed towards the museum entrance. It was times like that, she reminded him most of the Y/N he had met all those years ago. The same Y/N he had kept in his heart and mind all those years. </p><p>Y/N waited for him to catch up to her, and then she reached out for his hand, taking him by surprise. It was the first time she had held his hand in public. Sure, she was disguised, with a foulard wrapped around her head and a pair of big sunglasses, but it warmed his heart.</p><p>They politely greeted the people who worked there, at the entrance, and made their way to the galleries. It was a hall, full of bright colored canvas paintings. He watched her, as she slowly walked up to one of them, her dainty steps echoing throughout the room with tempo. Stopping to analyze every brushstroke and little detail, by tilting down her sunglasses. </p><p>\u201cI like this one.\u201d She said, as she continued to admire it. Her eyes gleamed with admiration, the edges of her lips curling up. </p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t say anything, for fear that he would ruin the moment. </p><p>She hurriedly led him to a video installation, a dark room, with a screen projecting a video which was a political commentary in form of stop motion animation. In there, she could spot a lonely bench, for them to sit on, so she guided him towards it, and they sat there silently. <br><br>As intriguing the video was, they couldn\u2019t help but notice they were finally alone. Alone in a dark room, with a fairly loud video playing in the background. His heartbeat quickened at the thought of being so close to her. They had been close many times before, but that was just what he felt when he was near her. He would have married her, if he was ever given the chance. <br><br>He felt her gently squeeze his hand, and he turned to her. She was looking at him. Her face lit up by the screen and nothing else, she had taken off her disguise, letting him see her face. The beautiful face he had fallen in love with. <br><br>\u201cIn here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a kiss.\u201d She whispered, an innocent smile appearing on her lips. He couldn\u2019t resist her when she did that.</p><p>\u201cDo you promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, you just have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>Their lips touched just for a second before pulling away. There was such mischief behind her eyes, there was no way she was just going to kiss him. She pulled him back in, this time, it was hungry, passionate. Bucky could taste the hint of ros\u00e8 mixed with the artificial taste of her lipstick, he was sure was smeared on his lips as well as hers.</p><p>Her hand moved to his thigh, he glanced at her, but her eyes were still fixed on the screen where the video was still playing. His cock stiffened at the thought of her touching and taking him right there. They were alone, however there was a chance anyone would have joined them in that room. That possibility dampened her panties,</p><p>Y/N swiftly wrapped her arms around his neck and climbed onto his lap, all while donning an all too knowing look. She knew exactly what she was doing to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game doll.\u201d He warned.</p><p>\u201cAm I now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll behave if you keep doing that\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you waiting for?\u201d She sinfully whispered in his year. \u201cLet\u2019s misbehave.\u201d</p><p>Before he could say another word, she was no longer on him, rather down on her knees in front of him, teasingly palming his erection through his pants.</p><p>Her fingers pulled down his zipper, and it took everything in him for Bucky to not let out anything more than a hiss when he felt her hand around him.</p><p>The feeling of her soft warm hand around his cock made him shudder in surprise, as she proceeded to stroke him a couple times, he tried to concentrate on something else, such as the flashing images on the screen. However, as she dragged her hand up again, \u00a0he swore he could\u2019ve just blown his load right then and there when she licked the bead of precum from the tip, before slowly wrapping her soft lips around him. </p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He managed to say in between gasps and moans. \u201cI want you to look at me.\u201d</p><p>What he didn\u2019t know was she was, she admired his flushed face and eyes closed shut. The way his taut lips parted in the most picturesque way, made her chuckle around his hard cock. She had no idea how he managed to look so good even from that angle. </p><p>Once he had gathered the control to open his eyes, he saw her looking up at him. </p><p>Of all the positions he had seen Y/N in, one of his favorites had to be her on her knees, with her pretty lips around his cock, and her pretty eyes gazing right into his. It was torture, what she was doing, slowly working him up towards his release. </p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t know he could be as frustrated as he was when she released him from her mouth with a lewd pop. She didn\u2019t want him coming, just yet, not until he was inside of her. Y/N stood in front of him, drool dribbling from the corner of her mouth which she sensually wiped away with her finger. As her hands tried to reach for the zipper, but he stopped her. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I want to fuck you like this. There\u2019s no time for that.\u201d </p><p>His hands went to her dress, as he pushed it up to her waist, his fingers went straight to her pussy. He felt the damp spot on her panties, his fingers tracing her pussy lips through the lace. Bucky loved teasing her, it might have been his favourite part. Seeing her gasp and plead, trying to get more friction from rutting her hips to much avail.</p><p>Y/N was now helpless, on his lap, her legs on each side of him, open to take him. His finger circled around her clit, earning some stifled moans from her, while he peppered kisses on the side of her neck. His cock was still painfully hard against her lower back, and she was just waiting for him to act upon his urge. </p><p>\u201cI need you inside of me.\u201d She gasped not being able to wait any longer, her hand trying to reach for his cock. The only thing that were keeping his cock from her were her panties. </p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d He asked teasingly, as he dragged his cock up and down her covered slit. \u00a0</p><p>She nodded, unable to utter complete sentences, not when he was doing that to her. He completely gave in when she let out a lip biting moan, and sunk into her warm pussy. </p><p>Her pussy lips welcoming him each time he eased himself inside her. Dreadfully slowly, so he could feel every inch of her. She gripped him tightly, as she rode him, her back against his chest and her dress bunched up to her hips, panties to one side. He didn\u2019t even bother taking her panties off, he wanted her at all costs, even at the one of not feeling her soft breasts in his large hands. He held her hips and thrusted up into her, harder and deeper, her sweet moans only spurred him on.</p><p>\u201cShh.. sweetheart. You don\u2019t want anyone coming in\u2026\u201d He sucked in her neck, careful to not leave any marks of his. Bucky, with his skillfulness, \u00a0played her body like an instrument, he fucked her pussy hitting the spot that made her toes curl, until both of them were right on edge.</p><p>The thought of being in public, and being caught, sparked something in her, as she turned her head and guided her lips onto his for a short but passionate kiss, as she rode him while he thrusted himself deep inside of her. </p><p>\u201cBucky, I\u2019m going to come.\u201d She announced. </p><p>\u201cCome for me, tell everyone who\u2019s making you feel this good.\u201d</p><p>He felt her pussy tightly clenching his cock, as she felt herself fall apart around him. She chanted his name, her moans making it near to impossible to not make Bucky spank her ass, while still thrusting through her orgasm.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t done with her. Yet.</p><p>\u201cCan you come again for me?\u201d Bucky whispered in her ear sultrily, as he once again started to pick up the pace. She wasn\u2019t still done feeling the aftermaths of her orgasm</p><p>She eagerly nodded, grinding her hips while following his rhythm. He was still hard, it took a lot more for him to come, but as usual, he put her needs first. Her juices already coated his cock, intensifying the noise of his thrusts as he pumped in and out of her.</p><p>\u201cFuck me Bucky, Fuck me-\u201c She repeated like a mantra, as if it as the only phrase she had learnt. </p><p>\u201cFuck Bucky, I\u2019m-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close\u2026\u201d</p><p>Her moans were drowned out by the sinful slapping of their bodies, and his pants, which were quickening by the second. His balls tightened, he was extremely close, letting out a final grunt, before spilling thick ribbons in her. </p><p>Her head rested on his shoulder, as she tried to catch her breath. Y/N could hear her fast heartbeat in her ears, it was loud above the heavy breathing. She stayed there still, as he wrapped his arms around her, his lips planting a gentle kiss on her exposed shoulder. That orgasm he had just given her, she still felt in her pussy. He was still there ever since, keeping his cum deep inside of her. Y/N propped herself on her uneasy feet, still not ready to leave the warmth and comfort of his body. His cum slowly trickling out of her, as she walked to compose herself. She caught Bucky watching her every move intently. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll tire of seeing you.\u201d His face radiated with happiness. \u00a0\u201cKnowing you\u2019re with me. I\u2019ve waited for this moment for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so poetic. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>There they were, the three little words she had been waiting her own husband to tell her, three little words that could\u2019ve changed things for them. Somehow sounded different when uttered by Bucky. She got a strange feeling, which she shook off. She wasn\u2019t used to hearing them.</p><p>\u201cI love you too\u201d</p><p><br>That feeling only intensified when she kissed him, Y/N never wanted to leave that place. She didn\u2019t want to think it was just a summer affair, bound to end by the start of September. That was what had happened all those years ago. She wasn\u2019t going to wait another decade or so to see him again. <br><br>After their tryst at the Museum Of Modern Art, it was incredible how they could go back to their everyday lives as if nothing had happened. They did it often, so they were quite used to it. Y/N would go home and when questioned about her whereabouts that day and the night before, she\u2019d say she had slept over at Natasha\u2019s, not that her husband would have cared that much. He was far too busy in his affairs to even note her absence. </p><p>That night, go occupy his thoughts with something that wasn\u2019t Y/N, Bucky decided to go to the famed gentlemen\u2019s club, to which he had a membership but rarely ever made an appearance. He liked being unknown. He wasn\u2019t one of those millionaires who thrived under the spotlight. After all, he did it all for her. </p><p>\u201cSteve, thanks for meeting me here.\u201d Steve noted that his face was glowing, and directly assumed it was because of her. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, it\u2019s just these past few weeks have been the best I\u2019ve ever lived.\u201d He admitted, rather shyly, even blushing a little. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it was nothing. Though I have seen more articles of you as of late.\u201d </p><p>Bucky knew of the articles. He had seen some while he was on a party hiatus, some of which speculated that he got entangled with the mob, or other senseless rumors he had never paid to mind before. However ever since Y/N started coming to his place, instead of meeting up at the Plaza, they had been photographed twice, on the same day. They had been careless that day, the sun was so hot it was unbearable to stay outdoors. All they could think about was what they were about to do, that they didn\u2019t notice someone sneakily taking a picture of them giggling like teenagers while they were heading in. Y/N was photographed again, heading out three hours later, with a jet black bob cut wig and ridiculously large sunglasses on. </p><p>After which stories surrounding the mysterious James Barnes mainly centered on the mystery woman he was seeing, and how attractive he was, as no one had the face to the name until then. </p><p>\u201cRogers! What are you doing here?\u201d Tony asked incredulously, as he reached his table, followed closely by two other men. He told them to go take their usual seat, while he stood there. Bucky looked at him from head to toe. A little jealous because he knew he was the man Y/N went home to. \u201cI thought gentlemen\u2019s clubs weren\u2019t your \u2018thing\u2019.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always room for change.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo that, I agree.\u201d Tony chuckled, which made Bucky feel nervous. </p><p>\u201cTony, this is my friend, Mr. Barnes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr. Barnes as in the White Wolf?\u201d He chuckled mockingly at the nickname, making Bucky scowl a little. He didn\u2019t like the man at all, not just because he was her husband, but also because he was not a nice man at all. And apparently he had a thing of putting other people down. </p><p>\u201cYes, it is just a silly nickname which the Wakandans have given me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI met your wife.\u201d It sounded more of a threat than a statement. </p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d Tony asked smugly, challenging Bucky to get into detail. </p><p>Tony didn\u2019t like Bucky one bit. It wasn\u2019t so hard to tell. </p><p>Not because he was probably richer than him, but because he knew his wife. It bothered him that when he returned home, she was no longer there, lounging in the living room while reading a book or a magazine. She disappeared in the morning when she got in the town car with her daughter to drop her off at preschool. Nothing he said seemed to faze her any longer, as if she had found herself something to entertain herself with. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it if you both could join us for my next party, this weekend.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI heard you weren\u2019t throwing any parties lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been rather busy.\u201d <i>Screwing your wife</i>. Bucky wanted to add, to wipe off the smug smirk off of his face, but he still had a little self control left. </p><p>\u201cWell then, we\u2019ll be there.\u201d </p><p>There they were, two of the most powerful men in New York, silently battling for dominance. It was the most awkward scene Steve had ever witnessed, the tension could\u2019ve been cut with a butter knife. All for a woman. One didn\u2019t even care much for, and the other wanted her. Though Steve didn\u2019t think Bucky was actually in love with her. And if he had known, maybe things could have been a little different. </p>",

Memories of the previous night came flooding back to her in a flashback sequence. Her eyes darted back at the bed in which he slept peacefully, she could see his back, even though in his relaxed state, she still could see the definition of the muscles of his back. The Egyptian cotton sheets covered his firm backside, after the night\u2019s exploits, it seemed like he couldn\u2019t be bothered to cover up, not that he needed to.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>She looked at her phone. </p><p><b><i>8:00 AM</i></b></p><p>Several unread texts. One by her husband, and five by Natasha, all at different times. She could hear her voice through her texts, concern mixed with her usual wittiness. </p><p><i>\u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Your husband called and I covered for you.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m serious, I\u2019m getting worried.\u2019 \u2018Wherever you are please be safe.\u2019 \u2018It must be serious if you lied to Tony.\u2019 </i></p><p>Tony. She was lying to him. She didn\u2019t know how to feel about it, seeing as he was constantly disloyal to her. And she knew that the ones she knew about weren\u2019t all. There was more to his exploits, but she never dared to ask. The thing was, she couldn\u2019t care less about what he would\u2019ve said. Because for once in a long time, she felt wanted, desired. </p><p>And she felt like this for the past two weeks, James had been treating her like a queen. The weekends were her favorite, because that was when she got to take her time with him. Each day they\u2019d go to a New York landmark and try to defile it in someway, so they\u2019d have a pleasant memory of it. Somehow it was exciting, as if she was a young girl again. And with James, every moment was exhilarating. </p><p>As he spent more time with her, giving her his full attention, the parties slowly stopped. Billionaire\u2019s Row stopped being full of crowds of people, waiting to get in the biggest party in New York. It was an unnatural phenomenon to the New Yorkers who spent all their time there. </p><p>People who had flown in from other states, even countries only for the party, had to fly back, unsure of what to do without the party. The lights turned off in all the floors, as they made not much use without ongoing parties, making people wonder what had happened to the mysterious reclusive billionaire. </p><p>\u201cYou leavin\u2019 so early?\u201d His voice asked groggily, and yet it still managed to be sexy. He pushed his hair back, his eyes were barely open, as he and just woken up. </p><p>\u201cI was just getting dressed. I have a home to go to.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut this is your home.\u201d He said, as he sat up the bed, revealing his pectoral muscles which made her weak in the knees. </p><p>\u201cI meant my other home. To my daughter, my\u2026 husband.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go to MOMA today.\u201d He immediately changed subject. He hated to think that she was already taken by someone else. In fact he liked to avoid the subject all together. </p><p>\u201cMOMA?\u201d She looked at him, cocking an eyebrow. \u201cAre you telling me we\u2019re going to defile one of the world\u2019s best modern art museums?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant for the art. I\u2019ve made a lot of donations to the museum, it\u2019d be nice to actually see what they did with it.\u201d </p><p>James unlike her husband, had a penchant for the arts, so much he had invested in so many art projects, and funded art schools. There was something about a man who dedicated so much time in something he believed in, that got her hot. So she had no problem with agreeing to spend a little more time with him. </p><p>She took out an Ala\u00efa dress, amongst the selection of clothing he had his team carefully select for her, from the large wardrobe. She liked the life Bucky was giving to her, it made her feel younger, and more alive. Sexy and daring were something she hadn\u2019t felt in ages, with her vanilla life with Tony, she was constricted in a life her parents had planned out for her. With Bucky, everything was different. He made her feel wanted, feeding her Ossetra caviar for brunch and sipping Mo\u00ebt Chandon while eating chocolate covered strawberries on the rooftop. </p><p>\u201cYou look gorgeous.\u201d She saw his reflection in the mirror, water dripping down his chest. Y/N had to take a moment to process what had happened the night before. </p><p>Another night, amongst the many they had already spent together. If she closed her eyes, she could feel everything she had felt. Every kiss or touch, that made her whimper beneath him. His tie gently wrapped around her eyes, heightened every feeling he gave her. His hands gently roaming down from her bare breasts, to her waist, all the way down to her hips.</p><p>\u201cSo you ready for MOMA doll?\u201d He asked as he snapped her out of her impure thoughts, already dressed. </p><p>\u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be. Now let me finish getting ready, I\u2019ll doubt I\u2019ll do so when you\u2019re here looking like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not tempt me.\u201d He said in his deep voice, his hands were on her shoulders, his lips so dangerously close to her ear. </p><p>\u201cI would never.\u201d </p><p>A statement she had said a couple of times in the past weeks, and had not quite fulfilled, due to Bucky looking always the way he did. </p><p>\u201cCome on, James. I don\u2019t want to miss a second of it.\u201d She said excitedly, as she rushed towards the museum entrance. It was times like that, she reminded him most of the Y/N he had met all those years ago. The same Y/N he had kept in his heart and mind all those years. </p><p>Y/N waited for him to catch up to her, and then she reached out for his hand, taking him by surprise. It was the first time she had held his hand in public. Sure, she was disguised, with a foulard wrapped around her head and a pair of big sunglasses, but it warmed his heart.</p><p>They politely greeted the people who worked there, at the entrance, and made their way to the galleries. It was a hall, full of bright colored canvas paintings. He watched her, as she slowly walked up to one of them, her dainty steps echoing throughout the room with tempo. Stopping to analyze every brushstroke and little detail, by tilting down her sunglasses. </p><p>\u201cI like this one.\u201d She said, as she continued to admire it. Her eyes gleamed with admiration, the edges of her lips curling up. </p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t say anything, for fear that he would ruin the moment. </p><p>She hurriedly led him to a video installation, a dark room, with a screen projecting a video which was a political commentary in form of stop motion animation. In there, she could spot a lonely bench, for them to sit on, so she guided him towards it, and they sat there silently. <br><br>As intriguing the video was, they couldn\u2019t help but notice they were finally alone. Alone in a dark room, with a fairly loud video playing in the background. His heartbeat quickened at the thought of being so close to her. They had been close many times before, but that was just what he felt when he was near her. He would have married her, if he was ever given the chance. <br><br>He felt her gently squeeze his hand, and he turned to her. She was looking at him. Her face lit up by the screen and nothing else, she had taken off her disguise, letting him see her face. The beautiful face he had fallen in love with. <br><br>\u201cIn here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a kiss.\u201d She whispered, an innocent smile appearing on her lips. He couldn\u2019t resist her when she did that.</p><p>\u201cDo you promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, you just have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>Their lips touched just for a second before pulling away. There was such mischief behind her eyes, there was no way she was just going to kiss him. She pulled him back in, this time, it was hungry, passionate. Bucky could taste the hint of ros\u00e8 mixed with the artificial taste of her lipstick, he was sure was smeared on his lips as well as hers.</p><p>Her hand moved to his thigh, he glanced at her, but her eyes were still fixed on the screen where the video was still playing. His cock stiffened at the thought of her touching and taking him right there. They were alone, however there was a chance anyone would have joined them in that room. That possibility dampened her panties,</p><p>Y/N swiftly wrapped her arms around his neck and climbed onto his lap, all while donning an all too knowing look. She knew exactly what she was doing to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game doll.\u201d He warned.</p><p>\u201cAm I now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll behave if you keep doing that\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you waiting for?\u201d She sinfully whispered in his year. \u201cLet\u2019s misbehave.\u201d</p><p>Before he could say another word, she was no longer on him, rather down on her knees in front of him, teasingly palming his erection through his pants.</p><p>Her fingers pulled down his zipper, and it took everything in him for Bucky to not let out anything more than a hiss when he felt her hand around him.</p><p>The feeling of her soft warm hand around his cock made him shudder in surprise, as she proceeded to stroke him a couple times, he tried to concentrate on something else, such as the flashing images on the screen. However, as she dragged her hand up again, \u00a0he swore he could\u2019ve just blown his load right then and there when she licked the bead of precum from the tip, before slowly wrapping her soft lips around him. </p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He managed to say in between gasps and moans. \u201cI want you to look at me.\u201d</p><p>What he didn\u2019t know was she was, she admired his flushed face and eyes closed shut. The way his taut lips parted in the most picturesque way, made her chuckle around his hard cock. She had no idea how he managed to look so good even from that angle. </p><p>Once he had gathered the control to open his eyes, he saw her looking up at him. </p><p>Of all the positions he had seen Y/N in, one of his favorites had to be her on her knees, with her pretty lips around his cock, and her pretty eyes gazing right into his. It was torture, what she was doing, slowly working him up towards his release. </p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t know he could be as frustrated as he was when she released him from her mouth with a lewd pop. She didn\u2019t want him coming, just yet, not until he was inside of her. Y/N stood in front of him, drool dribbling from the corner of her mouth which she sensually wiped away with her finger. As her hands tried to reach for the zipper, but he stopped her. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I want to fuck you like this. There\u2019s no time for that.\u201d </p><p>His hands went to her dress, as he pushed it up to her waist, his fingers went straight to her pussy. He felt the damp spot on her panties, his fingers tracing her pussy lips through the lace. Bucky loved teasing her, it might have been his favourite part. Seeing her gasp and plead, trying to get more friction from rutting her hips to much avail.</p><p>Y/N was now helpless, on his lap, her legs on each side of him, open to take him. His finger circled around her clit, earning some stifled moans from her, while he peppered kisses on the side of her neck. His cock was still painfully hard against her lower back, and she was just waiting for him to act upon his urge. </p><p>\u201cI need you inside of me.\u201d She gasped not being able to wait any longer, her hand trying to reach for his cock. The only thing that were keeping his cock from her were her panties. </p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d He asked teasingly, as he dragged his cock up and down her covered slit. \u00a0</p><p>She nodded, unable to utter complete sentences, not when he was doing that to her. He completely gave in when she let out a lip biting moan, and sunk into her warm pussy. </p><p>Her pussy lips welcoming him each time he eased himself inside her. Dreadfully slowly, so he could feel every inch of her. She gripped him tightly, as she rode him, her back against his chest and her dress bunched up to her hips, panties to one side. He didn\u2019t even bother taking her panties off, he wanted her at all costs, even at the one of not feeling her soft breasts in his large hands. He held her hips and thrusted up into her, harder and deeper, her sweet moans only spurred him on.</p><p>\u201cShh.. sweetheart. You don\u2019t want anyone coming in\u2026\u201d He sucked in her neck, careful to not leave any marks of his. Bucky, with his skillfulness, \u00a0played her body like an instrument, he fucked her pussy hitting the spot that made her toes curl, until both of them were right on edge.</p><p>The thought of being in public, and being caught, sparked something in her, as she turned her head and guided her lips onto his for a short but passionate kiss, as she rode him while he thrusted himself deep inside of her. </p><p>\u201cBucky, I\u2019m going to come.\u201d She announced. </p><p>\u201cCome for me, tell everyone who\u2019s making you feel this good.\u201d</p><p>He felt her pussy tightly clenching his cock, as she felt herself fall apart around him. She chanted his name, her moans making it near to impossible to not make Bucky spank her ass, while still thrusting through her orgasm.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t done with her. Yet.</p><p>\u201cCan you come again for me?\u201d Bucky whispered in her ear sultrily, as he once again started to pick up the pace. She wasn\u2019t still done feeling the aftermaths of her orgasm</p><p>She eagerly nodded, grinding her hips while following his rhythm. He was still hard, it took a lot more for him to come, but as usual, he put her needs first. Her juices already coated his cock, intensifying the noise of his thrusts as he pumped in and out of her.</p><p>\u201cFuck me Bucky, Fuck me-\u201c She repeated like a mantra, as if it as the only phrase she had learnt. </p><p>\u201cFuck Bucky, I\u2019m-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close\u2026\u201d</p><p>Her moans were drowned out by the sinful slapping of their bodies, and his pants, which were quickening by the second. His balls tightened, he was extremely close, letting out a final grunt, before spilling thick ribbons in her. </p><p>Her head rested on his shoulder, as she tried to catch her breath. Y/N could hear her fast heartbeat in her ears, it was loud above the heavy breathing. She stayed there still, as he wrapped his arms around her, his lips planting a gentle kiss on her exposed shoulder. That orgasm he had just given her, she still felt in her pussy. He was still there ever since, keeping his cum deep inside of her. Y/N propped herself on her uneasy feet, still not ready to leave the warmth and comfort of his body. His cum slowly trickling out of her, as she walked to compose herself. She caught Bucky watching her every move intently. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll tire of seeing you.\u201d His face radiated with happiness. \u00a0\u201cKnowing you\u2019re with me. I\u2019ve waited for this moment for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so poetic. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>There they were, the three little words she had been waiting her own husband to tell her, three little words that could\u2019ve changed things for them. Somehow sounded different when uttered by Bucky. She got a strange feeling, which she shook off. She wasn\u2019t used to hearing them.</p><p>\u201cI love you too\u201d</p><p><br>That feeling only intensified when she kissed him, Y/N never wanted to leave that place. She didn\u2019t want to think it was just a summer affair, bound to end by the start of September. That was what had happened all those years ago. She wasn\u2019t going to wait another decade or so to see him again. <br><br>After their tryst at the Museum Of Modern Art, it was incredible how they could go back to their everyday lives as if nothing had happened. They did it often, so they were quite used to it. Y/N would go home and when questioned about her whereabouts that day and the night before, she\u2019d say she had slept over at Natasha\u2019s, not that her husband would have cared that much. He was far too busy in his affairs to even note her absence. </p><p>That night, go occupy his thoughts with something that wasn\u2019t Y/N, Bucky decided to go to the famed gentlemen\u2019s club, to which he had a membership but rarely ever made an appearance. He liked being unknown. He wasn\u2019t one of those millionaires who thrived under the spotlight. After all, he did it all for her. </p><p>\u201cSteve, thanks for meeting me here.\u201d Steve noted that his face was glowing, and directly assumed it was because of her. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, it\u2019s just these past few weeks have been the best I\u2019ve ever lived.\u201d He admitted, rather shyly, even blushing a little. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it was nothing. Though I have seen more articles of you as of late.\u201d </p><p>Bucky knew of the articles. He had seen some while he was on a party hiatus, some of which speculated that he got entangled with the mob, or other senseless rumors he had never paid to mind before. However ever since Y/N started coming to his place, instead of meeting up at the Plaza, they had been photographed twice, on the same day. They had been careless that day, the sun was so hot it was unbearable to stay outdoors. All they could think about was what they were about to do, that they didn\u2019t notice someone sneakily taking a picture of them giggling like teenagers while they were heading in. Y/N was photographed again, heading out three hours later, with a jet black bob cut wig and ridiculously large sunglasses on. </p><p>After which stories surrounding the mysterious James Barnes mainly centered on the mystery woman he was seeing, and how attractive he was, as no one had the face to the name until then. </p><p>\u201cRogers! What are you doing here?\u201d Tony asked incredulously, as he reached his table, followed closely by two other men. He told them to go take their usual seat, while he stood there. Bucky looked at him from head to toe. A little jealous because he knew he was the man Y/N went home to. \u201cI thought gentlemen\u2019s clubs weren\u2019t your \u2018thing\u2019.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always room for change.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo that, I agree.\u201d Tony chuckled, which made Bucky feel nervous. </p><p>\u201cTony, this is my friend, Mr. Barnes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr. Barnes as in the White Wolf?\u201d He chuckled mockingly at the nickname, making Bucky scowl a little. He didn\u2019t like the man at all, not just because he was her husband, but also because he was not a nice man at all. And apparently he had a thing of putting other people down. </p><p>\u201cYes, it is just a silly nickname which the Wakandans have given me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI met your wife.\u201d It sounded more of a threat than a statement. </p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d Tony asked smugly, challenging Bucky to get into detail. </p><p>Tony didn\u2019t like Bucky one bit. It wasn\u2019t so hard to tell. </p><p>Not because he was probably richer than him, but because he knew his wife. It bothered him that when he returned home, she was no longer there, lounging in the living room while reading a book or a magazine. She disappeared in the morning when she got in the town car with her daughter to drop her off at preschool. Nothing he said seemed to faze her any longer, as if she had found herself something to entertain herself with. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it if you both could join us for my next party, this weekend.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI heard you weren\u2019t throwing any parties lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been rather busy.\u201d <i>Screwing your wife</i>. Bucky wanted to add, to wipe off the smug smirk off of his face, but he still had a little self control left. </p><p>\u201cWell then, we\u2019ll be there.\u201d </p><p>There they were, two of the most powerful men in New York, silently battling for dominance. It was the most awkward scene Steve had ever witnessed, the tension could\u2019ve been cut with a butter knife. All for a woman. One didn\u2019t even care much for, and the other wanted her. Though Steve didn\u2019t think Bucky was actually in love with her. And if he had known, maybe things could have been a little different. </p>",

Memories of the previous night came flooding back to her in a flashback sequence. Her eyes darted back at the bed in which he slept peacefully, she could see his back, even though in his relaxed state, she still could see the definition of the muscles of his back. The Egyptian cotton sheets covered his firm backside, after the night&rsquo;s exploits, it seemed like he couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to cover up, not that he needed to.&nbsp;</p><p>She looked at her phone. </p><p><b><i>8:00 AM</i></b></p><p>Several unread texts. One by her husband, and five by Natasha, all at different times. She could hear her voice through her texts, concern mixed with her usual wittiness. </p><p><i>&lsquo;Where are you?&rsquo; &lsquo;Your husband called and I covered for you.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m serious, I&rsquo;m getting worried.&rsquo; &lsquo;Wherever you are please be safe.&rsquo; &lsquo;It must be serious if you lied to Tony.&rsquo; </i></p><p>Tony. She was lying to him. She didn&rsquo;t know how to feel about it, seeing as he was constantly disloyal to her. And she knew that the ones she knew about weren&rsquo;t all. There was more to his exploits, but she never dared to ask. The thing was, she couldn&rsquo;t care less about what he would&rsquo;ve said. Because for once in a long time, she felt wanted, desired. </p><p>And she felt like this for the past two weeks, James had been treating her like a queen. The weekends were her favorite, because that was when she got to take her time with him. Each day they&rsquo;d go to a New York landmark and try to defile it in someway, so they&rsquo;d have a pleasant memory of it. Somehow it was exciting, as if she was a young girl again. And with James, every moment was exhilarating. </p><p>As he spent more time with her, giving her his full attention, the parties slowly stopped. Billionaire&rsquo;s Row stopped being full of crowds of people, waiting to get in the biggest party in New York. It was an unnatural phenomenon to the New Yorkers who spent all their time there. </p><p>People who had flown in from other states, even countries only for the party, had to fly back, unsure of what to do without the party. The lights turned off in all the floors, as they made not much use without ongoing parties, making people wonder what had happened to the mysterious reclusive billionaire. </p><p>&ldquo;You leavin&rsquo; so early?&rdquo; His voice asked groggily, and yet it still managed to be sexy. He pushed his hair back, his eyes were barely open, as he and just woken up. </p><p>&ldquo;I was just getting dressed. I have a home to go to.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But this is your home.&rdquo; He said, as he sat up the bed, revealing his pectoral muscles which made her weak in the knees. </p><p>&ldquo;I meant my other home. To my daughter, my&hellip; husband.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just go to MOMA today.&rdquo; He immediately changed subject. He hated to think that she was already taken by someone else. In fact he liked to avoid the subject all together. </p><p>&ldquo;MOMA?&rdquo; She looked at him, cocking an eyebrow. &ldquo;Are you telling me we&rsquo;re going to defile one of the world&rsquo;s best modern art museums?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I meant for the art. I&rsquo;ve made a lot of donations to the museum, it&rsquo;d be nice to actually see what they did with it.&rdquo; </p><p>James unlike her husband, had a penchant for the arts, so much he had invested in so many art projects, and funded art schools. There was something about a man who dedicated so much time in something he believed in, that got her hot. So she had no problem with agreeing to spend a little more time with him. </p><p>She took out an Ala&iuml;a dress, amongst the selection of clothing he had his team carefully select for her, from the large wardrobe. She liked the life Bucky was giving to her, it made her feel younger, and more alive. Sexy and daring were something she hadn&rsquo;t felt in ages, with her vanilla life with Tony, she was constricted in a life her parents had planned out for her. With Bucky, everything was different. He made her feel wanted, feeding her Ossetra caviar for brunch and sipping Mo&euml;t Chandon while eating chocolate covered strawberries on the rooftop. </p><p>&ldquo;You look gorgeous.&rdquo; She saw his reflection in the mirror, water dripping down his chest. Y/N had to take a moment to process what had happened the night before. </p><p>Another night, amongst the many they had already spent together. If she closed her eyes, she could feel everything she had felt. Every kiss or touch, that made her whimper beneath him. His tie gently wrapped around her eyes, heightened every feeling he gave her. His hands gently roaming down from her bare breasts, to her waist, all the way down to her hips.</p><p>&ldquo;So you ready for MOMA doll?&rdquo; He asked as he snapped her out of her impure thoughts, already dressed. </p><p>&ldquo;Ready as I&rsquo;ll ever be. Now let me finish getting ready, I&rsquo;ll doubt I&rsquo;ll do so when you&rsquo;re here looking like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do not tempt me.&rdquo; He said in his deep voice, his hands were on her shoulders, his lips so dangerously close to her ear. </p><p>&ldquo;I would never.&rdquo; </p><p>A statement she had said a couple of times in the past weeks, and had not quite fulfilled, due to Bucky looking always the way he did. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on, James. I don&rsquo;t want to miss a second of it.&rdquo; She said excitedly, as she rushed towards the museum entrance. It was times like that, she reminded him most of the Y/N he had met all those years ago. The same Y/N he had kept in his heart and mind all those years. </p><p>Y/N waited for him to catch up to her, and then she reached out for his hand, taking him by surprise. It was the first time she had held his hand in public. Sure, she was disguised, with a foulard wrapped around her head and a pair of big sunglasses, but it warmed his heart.</p><p>They politely greeted the people who worked there, at the entrance, and made their way to the galleries. It was a hall, full of bright colored canvas paintings. He watched her, as she slowly walked up to one of them, her dainty steps echoing throughout the room with tempo. Stopping to analyze every brushstroke and little detail, by tilting down her sunglasses. </p><p>&ldquo;I like this one.&rdquo; She said, as she continued to admire it. Her eyes gleamed with admiration, the edges of her lips curling up. </p><p>Bucky didn&rsquo;t say anything, for fear that he would ruin the moment. </p><p>She hurriedly led him to a video installation, a dark room, with a screen projecting a video which was a political commentary in form of stop motion animation. In there, she could spot a lonely bench, for them to sit on, so she guided him towards it, and they sat there silently. <br /><br />As intriguing the video was, they couldn&rsquo;t help but notice they were finally alone. Alone in a dark room, with a fairly loud video playing in the background. His heartbeat quickened at the thought of being so close to her. They had been close many times before, but that was just what he felt when he was near her. He would have married her, if he was ever given the chance. <br /><br />He felt her gently squeeze his hand, and he turned to her. She was looking at him. Her face lit up by the screen and nothing else, she had taken off her disguise, letting him see her face. The beautiful face he had fallen in love with. <br /><br />&ldquo;In here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just a kiss.&rdquo; She whispered, an innocent smile appearing on her lips. He couldn&rsquo;t resist her when she did that.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you promise?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, you just have to wait and see.&rdquo;</p><p>Their lips touched just for a second before pulling away. There was such mischief behind her eyes, there was no way she was just going to kiss him. She pulled him back in, this time, it was hungry, passionate. Bucky could taste the hint of ros&egrave; mixed with the artificial taste of her lipstick, he was sure was smeared on his lips as well as hers.</p><p>Her hand moved to his thigh, he glanced at her, but her eyes were still fixed on the screen where the video was still playing. His cock stiffened at the thought of her touching and taking him right there. They were alone, however there was a chance anyone would have joined them in that room. That possibility dampened her panties,</p><p>Y/N swiftly wrapped her arms around his neck and climbed onto his lap, all while donning an all too knowing look. She knew exactly what she was doing to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re playing a dangerous game doll.&rdquo; He warned.</p><p>&ldquo;Am I now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t promise I&rsquo;ll behave if you keep doing that&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then what are you waiting for?&rdquo; She sinfully whispered in his year. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s misbehave.&rdquo;</p><p>Before he could say another word, she was no longer on him, rather down on her knees in front of him, teasingly palming his erection through his pants.</p><p>Her fingers pulled down his zipper, and it took everything in him for Bucky to not let out anything more than a hiss when he felt her hand around him.</p><p>The feeling of her soft warm hand around his cock made him shudder in surprise, as she proceeded to stroke him a couple times, he tried to concentrate on something else, such as the flashing images on the screen. However, as she dragged her hand up again, &nbsp;he swore he could&rsquo;ve just blown his load right then and there when she licked the bead of precum from the tip, before slowly wrapping her soft lips around him. </p><p>&ldquo;Look at me.&rdquo; He managed to say in between gasps and moans. &ldquo;I want you to look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>What he didn&rsquo;t know was she was, she admired his flushed face and eyes closed shut. The way his taut lips parted in the most picturesque way, made her chuckle around his hard cock. She had no idea how he managed to look so good even from that angle. </p><p>Once he had gathered the control to open his eyes, he saw her looking up at him. </p><p>Of all the positions he had seen Y/N in, one of his favorites had to be her on her knees, with her pretty lips around his cock, and her pretty eyes gazing right into his.

She didn&rsquo;t want him coming, just yet, not until he was inside of her. Y/N stood in front of him, drool dribbling from the corner of her mouth which she sensually wiped away with her finger. As her hands tried to reach for the zipper, but he stopped her. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. I want to fuck you like this. There&rsquo;s no time for that.&rdquo; </p><p>His hands went to her dress, as he pushed it up to her waist, his fingers went straight to her pussy. He felt the damp spot on her panties, his fingers tracing her pussy lips through the lace. Bucky loved teasing her, it might have been his favourite part. Seeing her gasp and plead, trying to get more friction from rutting her hips to much avail.</p><p>Y/N was now helpless, on his lap, her legs on each side of him, open to take him. His finger circled around her clit, earning some stifled moans from her, while he peppered kisses on the side of her neck. His cock was still painfully hard against her lower back, and she was just waiting for him to act upon his urge. </p><p>&ldquo;I need you inside of me.&rdquo; She gasped not being able to wait any longer, her hand trying to reach for his cock.

She chanted his name, her moans making it near to impossible to not make Bucky spank her ass, while still thrusting through her orgasm.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t done with her. Yet.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you come again for me?&rdquo; Bucky whispered in her ear sultrily, as he once again started to pick up the pace.

I&rsquo;ve waited for this moment for so long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You make it sound so poetic. I love it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>There they were, the three little words she had been waiting her own husband to tell her, three little words that could&rsquo;ve changed things for them. Somehow sounded different when uttered by Bucky. She got a strange feeling, which she shook off. She wasn&rsquo;t used to hearing them.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too&rdquo;</p><p><br />That feeling only intensified when she kissed him, Y/N never wanted to leave that place. She didn&rsquo;t want to think it was just a summer affair, bound to end by the start of September. That was what had happened all those years ago. She wasn&rsquo;t going to wait another decade or so to see him again. <br /><br />After their tryst at the Museum Of Modern Art, it was incredible how they could go back to their everyday lives as if nothing had happened. They did it often, so they were quite used to it. Y/N would go home and when questioned about her whereabouts that day and the night before, she&rsquo;d say she had slept over at Natasha&rsquo;s, not that her husband would have cared that much. He was far too busy in his affairs to even note her absence. </p><p>That night, go occupy his thoughts with something that wasn&rsquo;t Y/N, Bucky decided to go to the famed gentlemen&rsquo;s club, to which he had a membership but rarely ever made an appearance. He liked being unknown. He wasn&rsquo;t one of those millionaires who thrived under the spotlight. After all, he did it all for her. </p><p>&ldquo;Steve, thanks for meeting me here.&rdquo; Steve noted that his face was glowing, and directly assumed it was because of her. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to see you again, it&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, it&rsquo;s just these past few weeks have been the best I&rsquo;ve ever lived.&rdquo; He admitted, rather shyly, even blushing a little. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, it was nothing. Though I have seen more articles of you as of late.&rdquo; </p><p>Bucky knew of the articles. He had seen some while he was on a party hiatus, some of which speculated that he got entangled with the mob, or other senseless rumors he had never paid to mind before. However ever since Y/N started coming to his place, instead of meeting up at the Plaza, they had been photographed twice, on the same day. They had been careless that day, the sun was so hot it was unbearable to stay outdoors. All they could think about was what they were about to do, that they didn&rsquo;t notice someone sneakily taking a picture of them giggling like teenagers while they were heading in. Y/N was photographed again, heading out three hours later, with a jet black bob cut wig and ridiculously large sunglasses on. </p><p>After which stories surrounding the mysterious James Barnes mainly centered on the mystery woman he was seeing, and how attractive he was, as no one had the face to the name until then. </p><p>&ldquo;Rogers! What are you doing here?&rdquo; Tony asked incredulously, as he reached his table, followed closely by two other men. He told them to go take their usual seat, while he stood there. Bucky looked at him from head to toe. A little jealous because he knew he was the man Y/N went home to. &ldquo;I thought gentlemen&rsquo;s clubs weren&rsquo;t your &lsquo;thing&rsquo;.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always room for change.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;To that, I agree.&rdquo; Tony chuckled, which made Bucky feel nervous. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony, this is my friend, Mr. Barnes.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Barnes as in the White Wolf?&rdquo; He chuckled mockingly at the nickname, making Bucky scowl a little. He didn&rsquo;t like the man at all, not just because he was her husband, but also because he was not a nice man at all. And apparently he had a thing of putting other people down. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it is just a silly nickname which the Wakandans have given me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I met your wife.&rdquo; It sounded more of a threat than a statement. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; Tony asked smugly, challenging Bucky to get into detail. </p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t like Bucky one bit. It wasn&rsquo;t so hard to tell. </p><p>Not because he was probably richer than him, but because he knew his wife. It bothered him that when he returned home, she was no longer there, lounging in the living room while reading a book or a magazine. She disappeared in the morning when she got in the town car with her daughter to drop her off at preschool. Nothing he said seemed to faze her any longer, as if she had found herself something to entertain herself with. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love it if you both could join us for my next party, this weekend.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I heard you weren&rsquo;t throwing any parties lately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been rather busy.&rdquo; <i>Screwing your wife</i>. Bucky wanted to add, to wipe off the smug smirk off of his face, but he still had a little self control left. </p><p>&ldquo;Well then, we&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo; </p><p>There they were, two of the most powerful men in New York, silently battling for dominance. It was the most awkward scene Steve had ever witnessed, the tension could&rsquo;ve been cut with a butter knife. All for a woman. One didn&rsquo;t even care much for, and the other wanted her. Though Steve didn&rsquo;t think Bucky was actually in love with her. And if he had known, maybe things could have been a little different. </p>",
