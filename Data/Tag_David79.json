Script\neditor Matt Fitton says: \u201cWe knew straightaway we could bring the wider Noble\nfamily into it by having Donna and Sylvia together, so we gave James that\nbrief. It meant it had to be set on Donna\u2019s contemporary Earth, since her mum\nisn\u2019t aware of her space and time travel yet.\u201d </p><p>Former Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies, creator of\nDonna, Sylvia and Wilf, tells Vortex: \u201cI\u2019m so excited about the return of the\nNoble family. I put in a request to Big Finish never thinking they\u2019d actually\npull it off. But, I might have known, they\u2019re unstoppable! Marvellously, I\nhaven\u2019t heard the adventure myself yet, so I\u2019m like any fan, dying to hear what\nthe Nobles, Wilf and the Doctor get up to. What a dream cast!\u201d </p><p>Jacqueline King was delighted to be back as Sylvia. </p><p>She says: \u201cSince we finished on TV I\u2019ve seen David a couple\nof times, and I keep in touch with Bernard because he\u2019s so gorgeous! He and I\ndid the quiz show Pointless. And Catherine was in a play which Bernard and I\nwent to see together, so that was lovely. We\u2019ve just not been all together so\nthere was so much to catch up on. I felt desperately maternal towards\nCatherine, wanting to know how she was! </p><p>\u201cI was very jealous that David and Catherine were going on\nto do more stories over the next couple of days without Bernard and myself.\nBernard and I were joking, asking, How can you do that? That\u2019s just disloyal! </p><p>\u201cIt was lovely, and if we could have carried on I would have\nbut it was just one day. It would be heaven if we could do more!\u201d </p><p>Matt continues: \u201cJames came back with this \u2018haunted\nmakeovers\u2019 idea which was great, and as it was being developed we asked James\nto keep in mind a role for Wilf in case we were able to get Bernard Cribbins \u2013\nperhaps just a cameo role. As it turned out we learned fairly early on that we\ncould have Bernard for the whole day, so it all worked out perfectly and Wilf\nwas fully included in the episode at the storyline stage.\u201d </p><p>In a similar vein to what the TV show did at the time, No\nPlace taps into the zeitgeist of what is currently popular on TV, which in this\ncase brings in the feed of ghost and home makeover reality TV shows. </p><p><br/></p><h2><i>\u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of either <b>Buzzfeed Unsolved</b> or <b>Homes\nUnder The Hammer</b> you\u2019ll find lots to love in this.\u201d\u00a0</i></h2><blockquote><p><i>\u2013 James Goss</i></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>James explains: \u201cHonestly, when you think about it most\nhorror films are home makeover shows! Family moves into house on haunted graveyard.\nTries to do it up. Ends up running away screaming/being dead/finds out they\nwere always dead so probably shouldn\u2019t have bothered wallpapering the\ndownstairs bathroom. This was inspired by that. Imagining a horror film but\nwith Kirsty Allsop following our screaming family about. And making the\nscreaming family the Doctor, Donna, Sylvia and Wilf. </p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of either <b>Buzzfeed Unsolved</b> or <b>Homes\nUnder the Hammer</b> you\u2019ll find lots to love in this. We\u2019ve got a ghostbox,\nwe\u2019ve got replacement light fittings, we\u2019ve mysterious voices, we\u2019ve endless\ndiscussions about plumbing. The one thing we couldn\u2019t do was <b>Hammer</b>\u2019s endless, appalling punning\nmusic track. (Presenter: \u2018They really do love this hopeless place.\u2019 Music: \u2018We\nFound Love in a Hopeless Place\u2019)!\u201d </p><p>\n\nProducer David Richardson adds: \u201cI\u2019m struck by\nhow creepy it all sounds. Some of the sequences in the old house are really\nunsettling even without any effects or music, which is a sure sign of how great\nthe writing, performances and direction are.\u201d \n\n\n\n</p><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7329f85c8628da3bb4c574bb40f54772/tumblr_inline_pprgaa3vxq1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"600\"/></figure><blockquote><p><b>[</b><i><b>Above</b> Cover for \u201cOne Mile Down\u201d by Jenny T Colgan, featuring <b>(l-r)</b> David Tennant, a Judoon, and Catherine Tate.</i><b>]</b></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>One Mile Down by Jenny T Colgan continues the Doctor and\nDonna\u2019s adventures when they find themselves in an underwater city and\nencounter the Judoon. </p><p>Matt continues: \u201cIn terms of using new series monsters, the\nJudoon are one of the most recognisable and the Tenth Doctor has some history\nwith them, meeting them several times during his era. </p><p>\u201cBecause of what\u2019s been established on screen there are\ncertain monsters he\u2019s meeting for the first time, but with the Judoon he knows\nwhat they\u2019re about and how they work. They are not power-crazed evil monsters,\nthey are mercenaries working for other people, and their agenda isn\u2019t always\nimmediately clear. It\u2019s nice to have that bit of potential uncertainty \u2013 are\nthey an ally? Are they a threat? We get to play with that in this story.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe have individuals in the Judoon ranks which we\u2019ve touched\non before. There\u2019s the trainee, Klo, who starts to side with the Doctor and\nDonna, realising they can do some good during the story, which is a fun thing\nto play with.\u201d The story\u2019s setting lends itself to a good soundscape, with a\ncity beneath the waves. </p><p>Matt explains: \u201cIn the TV episode Smith and Jones, the first\nthing we see the Judoon do is control the rain and send it upwards with their\nH2O scoop. </p><p>\u201cThat means we can make use of their technology which lends\nitself perfectly to an audio story.\u201d </p><p>Of course, Donna has also encountered the Judoon on TV, and\nMatt adds: \u201cWatching Donna in The Stolen Earth, we get a reaction from her to\nthe Judoon, but when we checked with Russell he watched it back and felt there\nwas no reason why Donna couldn\u2019t have met them before. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s clearly a surprise to her is the Doctor speaking\nJudoon, so we were very careful not to have him doing that in front of her.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ecb4f3c2047500622279ed4cd8216121/tumblr_inline_pprge8Xc3H1rkf3jm_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"600\"/></figure><blockquote><p>\n\n<b>[</b><i><b>Above</b> Cover for \u201cThe Creeping Death\u201d by Roy Gill, featuring <b>(l-r)</b> David Tennant, Catherine Tate, and Lauren Cornelius dressed in 1952 London period-costume, holding a torch.</i><b>]</b>\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>Concluding this series is The Creeping Death by Roy Gill. </p><p>David explains: \u201cWe asked the writers for short pitches \u2013 I\nthink they might have sent in three ideas each. I\u2019ve actually been keeping a\nlist of things I want to see in a Doctor Who story, one of which was \u2018The\nLondon Fog of 1952\u2019, so it was a no-brainer when Roy pitched that one!\u201d </p><p>Roy was delighted to be able to write for David Tennant, a\nfellow Scotsman, as well as Donna. </p><p>He admits it was: \u201cHugely exciting. They\u2019re one of my Doctor\nWho dream teams, really. The Doctor and Donna are best friends, they\u2019re fast\nand funny, they wind each other up but most importantly they make each other\nstronger and better. Their dialogue was a joy to write \u2013 and yes please, if the\nopportunity ever comes up, I absolutely want to do more!\u201d </p><p>Roy travelled from his Edinburgh home to attend the\nrecording at Moat Studios in London, and has plenty of happy memories from the\nsessions. </p><p>Roy adds: \u201cOh, loads! David asking, \u2018Is that a Scottish\naccent?\u2019 as soon as he met me \u2013 and then me kind of over-explaining where I\u2019m\nfrom (sorry, David&hellip;). Catherine cracking up over her lines about \u2018bad air\u2019\nand cheese and onion crisps\u2026 How quickly all the big, exciting scenes flew by\nin the recording booths.</p><p>\u201cStephen Critchlow talking over lunch about the classic <b>Who</b> he\u2019d been watching with his\ndaughter. Lauren Cornelius telling me she\u2019d loved her character and the story\nso much that when she got the script she read it from cover to cover then\nimmediately turned it over and read it again! Theo Stevenson saying he\u2019d watched\nDavid Tennant\u2019s Doctor when he was about 10 or 12. He was thrilled to be in a\nDoctor Who \u2013 making us all feel ancient!\u201d </p><p>Producer David adds: \u201cThis story is brilliant! Just a\ncharacter piece about a group of people lost in the fog and there\u2019s something really\nnasty out there\u2026 David has some terrific speeches, Catherine gets to play out\nsome lovely relationships with the guest characters, and the whole thing feels\nlike it was on TV back in 2008.\u201d </p><p>Director Ken Bentley was relieved when recording was complete\nafter three successive days in studio \u2013 which Big Finish rarely do. </p><p>He explains: \u201cIt\u2019s great to know we have a complete box set\nin the bag! These days availabilities are such that we\u2019re squeezing in\nrecordings as and when we can, sometimes over quite long periods of time. It\u2019s\nrare to record three days straight and know you\u2019ve got it all, but given the\nschedule we\u2019re all on it\u2019s a huge relief!\u201d </p><p><br/></p><h2><i>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe\nwhole thing feels like it was on TV back in 2008.\u201d\u00a0</i></h2><blockquote><p><i>\u2013 David Richardson</i></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Responsible for music and sound design is Howard Carter, who\nsays: \u201cI\u2019ll usually go through and work out if there are any background or\natmosphere tracks that reappear throughout the play, or any individual\nrecurring effects (specific vehicles or weapons, for example). If so I will\ncreate these in advance and add them to the project library so they are ready to\ndrag and drop in when I\u2019m working. I\u2019ll record the foley sound as I go and\nlayer up all the relevant backgrounds and effects scene by scene. Once the full\nplay is assembled I\u2019ll send a draft off to the director and move on to the\nscore. </p><p>\u201cI will usually spend a couple of days scoring a play\nalthough if there\u2019s more time I will always spend longer (I\u2019m a composer by\ntrade!). At this point I know the play well so will have a sense of the mood,\nstyle and pacing. </p><p>\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m working on a completely new play I\u2019ll\ncreate a template and start adding instruments and sounds as I see fit in order\nto start with a completely fresh palette. Every play is different so I don\u2019t\nhave one fixed approach. There are scene breaks which usually need a cue, and there\nare sometimes musical directions in the script, but otherwise a lot of the\nprocess is instinctive. A play may need a lot of music to keep energy levels up\nand maintain a sense of pace, or it may need the music to really take a\nbackground role and just glue certain elements together. Each one is unique.\u201d\n\n\n\n</p><h2><b>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 VORTEX Magazine, Issue 122, Pages 4-8</b></h2><p><br/></p><p>THE TENTH DOCTOR ADVENTURES VOLUME THREE IS OUT IN MAY ON CD\nAND DOWNLOAD. </p><p>The Tenth Doctor Adventures Volume Three is out in May on CD and Download.</p><p>The special edition release comes complete with exclusive\nproduction notes, storyboards from Mike Tucker and costume designs from June\nHudson. </p><p>For full details visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:/www.bigfinish.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.bigfinish.com</a>\u00a0.<br/></p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><i>(Edited to include Lauren Cornelius\u2019 name in the image description of\u00a0\u201cThe Creeping Death\u201d cover.)</i></p></blockquote>",

Catherine cracking up over her lines about \u2018bad air\u2019\nand cheese and onion crisps\u2026 How quickly all the big, exciting scenes flew by\nin the recording booths.</p><p>\u201cStephen Critchlow talking over lunch about the classic <b>Who</b> he\u2019d been watching with his\ndaughter.

Just a\ncharacter piece about a group of people lost in the fog and there\u2019s something really\nnasty out there\u2026 David has some terrific speeches, Catherine gets to play out\nsome lovely relationships with the guest characters, and the whole thing feels\nlike it was on TV back in 2008.\u201d </p><p>Director Ken Bentley was relieved when recording was complete\nafter three successive days in studio \u2013 which Big Finish rarely do. </p><p>He explains: \u201cIt\u2019s great to know we have a complete box set\nin the bag!

If so I will\ncreate these in advance and add them to the project library so they are ready to\ndrag and drop in when I\u2019m working. I\u2019ll record the foley sound as I go and\nlayer up all the relevant backgrounds and effects scene by scene. Once the full\nplay is assembled I\u2019ll send a draft off to the director and move on to the\nscore. </p><p>\u201cI will usually spend a couple of days scoring a play\nalthough if there\u2019s more time I will always spend longer (I\u2019m a composer by\ntrade!). At this point I know the play well so will have a sense of the mood,\nstyle and pacing. </p><p>\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m working on a completely new play I\u2019ll\ncreate a template and start adding instruments and sounds as I see fit in order\nto start with a completely fresh palette. Every play is different so I don\u2019t\nhave one fixed approach. There are scene breaks which usually need a cue, and there\nare sometimes musical directions in the script, but otherwise a lot of the\nprocess is instinctive. A play may need a lot of music to keep energy levels up\nand maintain a sense of pace, or it may need the music to really take a\nbackground role and just glue certain elements together. Each one is unique.\u201d\n\n\n\n</p><h2><b>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 VORTEX Magazine, Issue 122, Pages 4-8</b></h2><p><br></p><p>THE TENTH DOCTOR ADVENTURES VOLUME THREE IS OUT IN MAY ON CD\nAND DOWNLOAD. </p><p>The Tenth Doctor Adventures Volume Three is out in May on CD and Download.</p><p>The special edition release comes complete with exclusive\nproduction notes, storyboards from Mike Tucker and costume designs from June\nHudson. </p><p>For full details visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:/www.bigfinish.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.bigfinish.com</a>\u00a0.<br></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p><i>(Edited to include Lauren Cornelius\u2019 name in the image description of\u00a0\u201cThe Creeping Death\u201d cover.)</i></p></blockquote></p>",

Script\neditor Matt Fitton says: &ldquo;We knew straightaway we could bring the wider Noble\nfamily into it by having Donna and Sylvia together, so we gave James that\nbrief. It meant it had to be set on Donna&rsquo;s contemporary Earth, since her mum\nisn&rsquo;t aware of her space and time travel yet.&rdquo; </p><p>Former Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies, creator of\nDonna, Sylvia and Wilf, tells Vortex: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited about the return of the\nNoble family. I put in a request to Big Finish never thinking they&rsquo;d actually\npull it off. But, I might have known, they&rsquo;re unstoppable! Marvellously, I\nhaven&rsquo;t heard the adventure myself yet, so I&rsquo;m like any fan, dying to hear what\nthe Nobles, Wilf and the Doctor get up to. What a dream cast!&rdquo; </p><p>Jacqueline King was delighted to be back as Sylvia. </p><p>She says: &ldquo;Since we finished on TV I&rsquo;ve seen David a couple\nof times, and I keep in touch with Bernard because he&rsquo;s so gorgeous! He and I\ndid the quiz show Pointless. And Catherine was in a play which Bernard and I\nwent to see together, so that was lovely. We&rsquo;ve just not been all together so\nthere was so much to catch up on. I felt desperately maternal towards\nCatherine, wanting to know how she was! </p><p>&ldquo;I was very jealous that David and Catherine were going on\nto do more stories over the next couple of days without Bernard and myself.\nBernard and I were joking, asking, How can you do that? That&rsquo;s just disloyal! </p><p>&ldquo;It was lovely, and if we could have carried on I would have\nbut it was just one day. It would be heaven if we could do more!&rdquo; </p><p>Matt continues: &ldquo;James came back with this &lsquo;haunted\nmakeovers&rsquo; idea which was great, and as it was being developed we asked James\nto keep in mind a role for Wilf in case we were able to get Bernard Cribbins &ndash;\nperhaps just a cameo role. As it turned out we learned fairly early on that we\ncould have Bernard for the whole day, so it all worked out perfectly and Wilf\nwas fully included in the episode at the storyline stage.&rdquo; </p><p>In a similar vein to what the TV show did at the time, No\nPlace taps into the zeitgeist of what is currently popular on TV, which in this\ncase brings in the feed of ghost and home makeover reality TV shows. </p><p><br /></p><h2><i>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a fan of either <b>Buzzfeed Unsolved</b> or <b>Homes\nUnder The Hammer</b> you&rsquo;ll find lots to love in this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></h2><blockquote><p><i>&ndash; James Goss</i></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>James explains: &ldquo;Honestly, when you think about it most\nhorror films are home makeover shows! Family moves into house on haunted graveyard.\nTries to do it up. Ends up running away screaming/being dead/finds out they\nwere always dead so probably shouldn&rsquo;t have bothered wallpapering the\ndownstairs bathroom. This was inspired by that. Imagining a horror film but\nwith Kirsty Allsop following our screaming family about. And making the\nscreaming family the Doctor, Donna, Sylvia and Wilf. </p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a fan of either <b>Buzzfeed Unsolved</b> or <b>Homes\nUnder the Hammer</b> you&rsquo;ll find lots to love in this.
