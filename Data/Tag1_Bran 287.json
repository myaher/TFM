He has an older brother Robb, a younger brother Rickon, two older sisters Sansa and Arya, and an older &ldquo;bastard half-brother&rdquo;, Jon Snow, who is actually <b>Bran&rsquo;s </b>first cousin by his aunt Lyanna Stark. <b>Bran </b>was named for Ned&rsquo;s elder brother, Brandon, who was brutally executed by the Mad King along with <b>Bran&rsquo;s </b>paternal grandfather Rickard Stark. He is only called &ldquo;<b>Brandon</b>&rdquo; by his mother when he has done something wrong. <b>Bran </b>dreams of being a knight of the Kingsguard, and his favorite hobby is climbing the walls of Winterfell, using its old rooftops and passageways to get around.\n\n<br/></p><p><b>Bran </b>is a warg and currently the new Three-Eyed Raven, using his supernatural gifts to assist his family in the war against the White Walkers.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1018\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img data-orig-height=\"1018\" data-orig-width=\"800\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7490d98c88e07335d6ca0736c570c75e/tumblr_inline_pewgnyUnbu1qbv7u8_540.jpg\"/></figure><h2><b><i>Appearance and Personality</i></b></h2><p><b>Bran </b>has his mother&rsquo;s coloring, with the thick auburn hair and deep blue eyes associated with House Tully.</p><p><b>Bran </b>is a pleasant young boy, regarded fondly by the people of Winterfell.\u00a0Before the incident of his fall, <b>Bran </b>was an extremely curious and adventurous boy. He was noted by his mother, and by his brother Robb, to have done a great amount of climbing around the walls of Winterfell and having never fallen, showing a considerable amount of bravery on his part. His curiosity was in large part what led to his fall in the first place, since he was drawn into the encounter between Jaime and Cersei out of sheer curiosity as to what was happening.\u00a0After his fall, <b>Bran&rsquo;s </b>rapidly worsening situation forced him to become far more solemn and apprehensive than the cheerful child he had once been. After words <b>Bran </b>had it in him to be a good lord in his own right, as proven by his brief tenure as acting Lord of Winterfell when Robb left to fight Tywin Lannister.</p><p>Upon meeting Jojen Reed, <b>Bran </b>proved capable of accepting the powers that he possessed, showing an open mind on his part, even if such a thing set him apart from companions like Osha. He became almost unbreakably determined to meet the Three-Eyed Raven that kept coming to him in his dreams, even if it meant separating from his brother Rickon and, later on, from Jon Snow. When <b>Bran </b>finally reached the Three-Eyed Raven, one of the first things he pressed the Three-Eyed Raven about is whether or not <b>Bran </b>could walk again, and is briefly disappointed when told that he will never walk again.</p><p>After growing up under the tutelage of the Three-Eyed Raven, <b>Bran </b>maintains his curious nature, especially when he and the Raven visit Winterfell; his curiosity piques when he sees his long-dead aunt Lyanna. <b>Bran </b>is disappointed by the prospect of returning to the real world. Later on, <b>Bran </b>expresses confusion when witnessing the duel at the Tower of Joy, especially when his young father started losing the duel - this confusion turned to horror when he realized that Arthur Dayne lost only because Howland Reed blindsided him, having been told all his life that Ned ultimately killed the man in an honorable duel. This horror resurfaced when he realized that the Children of the Forest were responsible for the creation of the White Walkers, only to be silenced when <a title=\"Leaf\" href=\"http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Leaf\">Leaf</a> cited the havoc caused by men to be the main reason for this course of action. He also shows incredulity at what his own powers can accomplish, as shown when he realizes how he is responsible for breaking Hodor&rsquo;s mind in the first place.</p><p>Upon returning from Beyond the Wall, <b>Bran&rsquo;s </b>personality has changed significantly, as a result of the expansion his powers have taken since the battle at the Cave of the Three-Eyed Raven. He has become extremely calm to a fault, to the point of being almost detached from everyone else around him. Having become the new Three-Eyed Raven, <b>Bran </b>has been given access to many more events, which he explains several times, so much that <b>Bran </b>becomes aware of almost anything, for example the wedding between his sister Sansa and Ramsay Bolton, and even the conversation between Littlefinger and Varys. He also shows a rather dangerous and threatening side, as evidenced by his deadpan recital of Chaos is a ladder to Petyr Baelish, outright showing that he knows how treacherous Petyr is and what he has done against House Stark in the past, but also suggesting that Petyr is unable to manipulate him. Also, <b>Bran </b>shows himself to have become almost wiser than he was before, ultimately not accepting the Valyrian steel dagger that Littlefinger gives him, citing that it would be useless for a cripple, but at the same time obviously not trusting the gifts that the man gives him. However, <b>Bran </b>is not truly omniscient, as he still needs to witness events in order to find out about them, as shown by his surprise when he heard that Rhaegar and Lyanna were secretly married.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1378\" data-orig-width=\"956\"><img data-orig-height=\"1378\" data-orig-width=\"956\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/640330f1f11f0f7e44b50bb3a587594c/tumblr_inline_pewgniWIwD1qbv7u8_540.jpg\"/></figure><h2><b><i>Skills</i></b></h2><p><b>Bran Stark</b> is one of a few characters known to possess magical abilities.</p><p><b>Greensight </b>- also called simply &ldquo;The Sight&rdquo;, is the ability to receive prophetic visions, starting off in the form of dreams. <b>Bran&rsquo;s </b>powers extend far beyond simply viewing events unfold; he is capable of influencing past events, though he cannot change what was predestined to occur already.<br/><b>Warg </b>- <b>Bran </b>is a warg, a human who can send his consciousness into the mind of an animal, to see through its eyes and control its body as if it were his own. Jojen Reed states that this is a different, though related, ability to the Sight. Though he still needs training, <b>Bran </b>is inherently a very powerful warg, even able to enter the mind of another human, something the wargs among the wildlings are unable and unwilling to do. <b>Bran </b>has already become skilled at entering the mind of his direwolf Summer, in which he is a dangerous fighter, capable of dispatching several wildlings or wights, and uses Hodor to perform more complicated tasks or to supplement Summer&rsquo;s fighting capacity.</p><ul><li>Skinchanging with a Heart tree, a Weirwood with a face carved in it by the Children of the Forest, allows <b>Bran </b>to have vivid visions of past, present, and future events, including those far away from himself.

Pensamos que at\u00e9 os deuses morrem. Tudo muda. Talvez a magia um dia tenha sido uma for\u00e7a poderosa no mundo, mas j\u00e1 n\u00e3o o \u00e9. O pouco que resta n\u00e3o \u00e9 mais do que o fiapo de fuma\u00e7a que permanece no ar depois de um grande inc\u00eandio se extinguir, e at\u00e9 isso est\u00e1 se desvanecendo. Val\u00edria foi a \u00faltima brasa, e ela desapareceu. J\u00e1 n\u00e3o h\u00e1 drag\u00f5es, os gigantes est\u00e3o mortos, e os filhos da floresta, esquecidos com todo o seu saber. N\u00e3o, meu pr\u00edncipe. Jojen Reed pode ter tido um sonho ou dois que acredita se tornaram verdade, mas n\u00e3o tem a vis\u00e3o verde. Nenhum homem vivo det\u00e9m esse poder.",
