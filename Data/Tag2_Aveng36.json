In the scene with the ancient one there was only a split if the stones stayed gone, but they were returned so it&rsquo;s all the same timeline. When the stones aren\u2019t in the correct place at the correct time it\u2019s a multiverse situation, so that explains how Nebula shot her past self, because that timeline, without the stone, was\u00a0\u2018doomed.\u2019</p><p>To quote Lewis Black:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t have enough breadcrumbs to get home.\u201d</p><p>For one, what are\u00a0\u2018certain things\u2019? Just removing the stones? But Loki took the Tesseract, so even if they return the stones they took, Loki still took the stone in 2012, so what happens with that? Is time not linear in that one instance? Also, if they didn\u2019t have to worry about messing up the past beyond removing the stones because things would just be reset somehow (which is not explained in the movie - what is explained is that the stones get returned and the timeline isn\u2019t doomed; <i>not </i>that it is magically reset), why did they even bother dressing up as their past selves and trying to steal them totally unnoticed?
