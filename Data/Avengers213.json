The schedule helped keep you in order, and you knew you\u2019d be an anxious mess without it. Luckily the two prominent people in your life helped to keep your schedule intact each week.</p><p><i>1.Wake up</i></p><p>You woke with a sigh, sunlight creeping into the room through your sheer white curtains. You turned your head to the man lying next to you with a smile. Greyson. Greyson Marlow was your boyfriend of nine months, he decided to move in with you a month ago. Things with him always moved fast, but it felt right. Greyson never treated you badly, he cared about you and always trusted you. He was the perfect guy. You imagined getting married to him and having children, even before you started dating him. You had the biggest crush on him, finally getting the courage once your best friend told you to go for it.</p><p>You watched Greyson as his eyes fluttered open, letting out a heavy breath as he pulled you closer to him. Your soft giggle made him smile wide, his eyes filled with adoration.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019 (Y/N),\u201d he murmured sweetly as he pressed a kiss to your forehead.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Grey,\u201d You smiled warmly at him. Your heart flutters when he returns an adoring smile.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get some food in you before you gotta go to work,\u201d He chuckled and sat up, \u201cIt\u2019s Friday, date night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhmm..\u201d You nuzzled into his side, not really wanting to get up. You wanted to stay in bed with Greyson all day, but you knew you couldn\u2019t. He pulled away from you and climbed out of the bed, his sweet smile never faltering. The two of you enjoyed each others presence, it sweet and calm. The entire thing was so much better than what you\u2019re used to, it almost seemed too perfect.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, love,\u201d He reached out his hand to help you stand, you graciously took it. You couldn\u2019t help but feel intoxicated every time his eyes gazed into your own. Greyson was this angelic being, mystical and magical, he could never do wrong.</p><p>As Greyson eventually pulled you into the kitchen, you went straight for the coffee and he went straight for the fridge. \u00a0This has been the norm for the past month, you prepare coffee while he prepares breakfast then you eat together. You ate your perfectly cooked eggs and sparsely sip your coffee in a comfortable silence with Greyson. \u00a0You hoped that every morning would be as peaceful as this one.</p><p><i>2.Work</i></p><p>After showering and getting dressed, you trudged on to work. You hoped that today wouldn\u2019t be another slow day. As much as you enjoyed relaxation, you couldn\u2019t handle any more days without a decent amount of work to do. You breathed in the chill San Francisco air before opening the door the building you work in. You worked for a small local journalism company which didn\u2019t pay too well, but you also did freelance work on the side.</p><p>\u201cMorning (Y/N),\u201d Your boss, Mr Belleville, greeted.</p><p>\u201cMorning Mr Belleville,\u201d you responded cheerily while sitting down at your desk.</p><p>You felt your phone buzz and saw a text from Eddie. Eddie. Eddie Brock has been your best friend for a year, you met him when you first moved to San Fransisco. He was possibly the strangest man you\u2019d ever met, and you were possibly the weirdest woman he had ever met. You could tell him anything on your mind, and vice versa, but it wasn\u2019t like you would. Some things just need to stay unsaid.</p><p><b><i>Eddie: I know its out of schedule but could we do lunch today?</i></b></p><p>You sighed, not wanting to go out of your schedule. You agreed to meet Eddie for lunch despite the weird feeling in your stomach. Every time you thought about Eddie you smiled, the man meant the world to you. You pictured his face deep in thought and then smiling when you\u2019d been caught staring by him. The images playing in your mind we\u2019re almost enough to make you giggle to yourself. Eddie was the most incredible best friend you could ask for. He even helped you gather the confidence to confess your feelings to Greyson.</p><p>You looked through the files on your desk, you realized you forgot to put away a bunch of your completed work. Sighing, you accepted your fate of having a boring workday.</p><p>\u201cFuck this..\u201d you murmured as you began to filed some papers.</p><p>You missed all the big crimes, those really gave you something to work on. You were bored of the local murderers. How you would kill for a big crime lord to take down with your impressive research skills. It had been months since your last big project. Boredom got the best of you and you waited for what felt like days for your lunch break.</p><p><i>3. Meet Eddie on your lunch break- Only on Tuesdays and Thursdays- then go back to work</i></p><p>Finally! It was time for your lunch break after filing papers and proofreading some upcoming articles. You clocked out and headed towards Val\u2019s Diner. Val\u2019s was yours and Eddies spot, almost every time you had lunch or hung out with him it was at Val\u2019s. You smiled as you saw that Eddie was already inside sitting at your favourite booth, your smile quickly faded when you noticed how upset he looked. He seemed sad and frustrated, you decided to enter the diner with a neutral expression.</p><p>Eddies head shot up as he heard a bell that signalled a new customer entering. The corners of his mouth curled up ever so slightly when he saw you. You flashed a small smile as you approached and sat down across from him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lucky man, Ed,\u201d You smirked, \u201cI don\u2019t go off schedule for just anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,(Y/N), I know,\u201d Eddie chuckled, \u201cI just\u2026 wanted to see you, \u2018s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay? You seem a bit,\u201d You paused to find the right word, \u201coff.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and reassured you that he was fine before a waitress dropped off some plates full of warm and delicious smelling food. One of the plates you recognized as your usual, but there were two other meals for Eddie.</p><p>\u201cYou invite someone else I don\u2019t know about?\u201d You chuckled as you took a bite of your sandwich.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d He titled his head in confusion, a mouthful of food muffling him.</p><p>\u201cYou normally only get one meal,\u201d You quirked an eyebrow at him, \u201cI was just messing with you.\u201d</p><p>Eddie smirked and swallowed his food. His eyes stayed on you for a little too long, but your eyes were on him too. You felt strange, sitting there staring at your best friend.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you really want to have lunch today, Ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I wanted to see you,\u201d He repeated before you gave him a stern glare, \u201cOkay fine! I have something to tell you but I-uh I don\u2019t know&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keepin\u2019 secrets from me now?\u201d Your tone turned serious, you never had secrets with Eddie. You were always one hundred per cent honest with him, no secrets and no big lies.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N),\u201d his voice was serious too, but a little quieter than it was before, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing really, don\u2019t worry about.\u201d</p><p>You nodded. For a second you could\u2019ve sworn you saw something change in his eyes, you thought you saw them turn blank white. You could tell the smile he offered was forced, but you offered a tight-lipped smile anyway. The two of you ate in silence from that point on, not a comfortable silence. The silence made you feel queasy, but maybe it was actually that weird feeling of being watched since you left work.</p><p><i>4. Go on a date with Greyson- Friday and Saturday</i></p><p>You finally went home after what felt like pointless hours at work and the awkward lunch with Eddie. You never really shook that feeling of being watched that entire day. Hopefully, Greyson could make this weird day better.</p><p>\u201cGrey,\u201d You called out, \u201cYou home?\u201d</p><p>No response. You looked around the small but nicely decorated apartment. You finally made it into the bedroom where you found Greyson laying on the bed. His arms were crossed and if his eyes were open he\u2019d be staring at the ceiling. He looked very peaceful, you couldn\u2019t tell if he was sleeping or not, so you just laid down next to him. Your head gently lay on his shoulder and you soon found your breathing patterns matching his.</p><p>\u201cHey, (Y/N),\u201d Greyson greeted softly, he didn\u2019t move or open his eyes, and his voice sounded rougher than normal.</p><p>\u201cYou doin\u2019 okay?\u201d You asked as you pressed a soft kiss to his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfect,\u201d His words began to sound harsh, angry, \u201cHow is Eddie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d You sat up so you could get a better look at his face, \u201cBabe, what\u2019s wrong?</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping with Eddie?\u201d His voice was below a whisper, but you heard him loud and clear.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Grey-\u201d Your voice faltered slightly, \u201cNothing like that is happening between me and Eddie.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at you with more anger than you thought was possible with him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on your schedule,\u201d Greyson hissed, \u201cAnd today you broke your schedule to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you even know about that?\u201d You furrowed your brows.</p><p>Greyson growled in anger and before you could even think of fighting back he had you pinned down underneath him.</p><p>\u201cYou lying slut,\u201d Greyson\u2019s voice was laced with poison, \u201cI know you\u2019re cheating on me! Just admit it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t admit to something I haven\u2019t done, Grey!\u201d You cried out, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d</p><p>He growled and you felt his hands move roughly from your shoulders to your neck. It took mere seconds before you couldn\u2019t breathe. You squirmed and tried to pull his hands off of your neck, but each time you tried the tighter he choked you. It wasn\u2019t long before you started getting dizzy, the string of insults and profanities escaping Greysons mouth were becoming jumbled into your thoughts.</p><p>\u2018Breathe. Just fucking breathe!\u2019 you thought to yourself.</p><p>You tried to escape his grasp once more and you felt his lips crash onto yours. You couldn\u2019t turn your head to escape his kiss that tried to soothe you into death. You lay there waiting, waiting for him to stop. Waiting for him to just kill you already. Waiting for yourself to lose consciousness.</p><p>Suddenly Greyson was flung off of you, you didn\u2019t see what but you could hear a monstrous growl in the room. You decided to focus on breathing. You got your strength back a little bit and sat up in the bed. Your eyes widened and your jaw nearly fell through the floor when you saw a giant figure towering above Greyson.</p><p>It was huge and muscular, covered in what looked like thick black ink. Its eyes were almost the scariest part, they were big and white, shaped like a strange moon cut in half. Its teeth, there were so many, they were so sharp. Its long pink tongue swirled out of its mouth as it picked up Greyson.</p><p><b>\u201cYou might want to look away, sweetheart,\u201d</b> The creature hissed.</p><p>You wanted to look away, and how you wish you had. You saw the creature bite Greyson&rsquo;s entire head off with a deafening crack of his neck. You quickly covered your mouth as to hold back the screams that were caught in your throat anyway.</p><p>You were quickly blinded by your fear induced tears, and only heard the rest of Greyson being devoured by the creature.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t breathe again, but no one&rsquo;s hands were around your neck. You clutched onto your chest and everything was blurry. You couldn\u2019t focus on anything, you could hardly hear anything.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)? (Y/N) \u00a0are you okay?\u201d Eddie was right in front of you, his hands gently placed on your biceps and a concerned look plastered on his face.</p><p>You came to your senses and looked him in the eyes with your tearful ones. He quickly pulled you into a hug, a sudden sob racked through you. It was then that you noticed that your entire body was shaking. You heard Eddie cooing reassurances in your ear, rubbing your back gently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay you\u2019re safe now, (Y/N),\u201d Eddie whispers.</p><p>\u201cEd-Eddie what was that.. that thing?\u201d You managed to ask, referring to the creature you had witnessed just minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Venom,\u201d Eddie responded calmly, \u201cHe and I are sorta&hellip; stuck together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Your tears finally stopped, and you felt like you had a clearer mind. Well, as clear as it gets after your boyfriend tries to kill you then gets eaten by a giant ink monster.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d Eddie backed away from you, allowing the black inky goo to begin covering his body slowly. The black goo formed the creature you saw previously, and you stared in awe. Half of its face pulled back to reveal Eddies face.</p><p><b>\u201cWe&hellip; Are Venom,\u201d</b> Eddie and Venom spoke at the same time.</p><p>You were nearly speechless, but managed a small, \u201cIncredible\u2026\u201d</p><p>Venom\u2019s black tendrils climbed back to their hiding place, leaving just you and Eddie.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of questions but,\u201d You stood up, \u201cCould we maybe go to your place? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to stay sane here.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>\u201cSo, how did you know I was in danger?\u201d You asked while nursing a cup of coffee on Eddie&rsquo;s couch.</p><p>Eddie has been sat next to you for the past thirty minutes, trying to answer your questions to the best of his ability.</p><p>\u201cUh, V\u2019 told me,\u201d Eddie cleared his throat, \u201cI guess he has better senses than we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that makes sense,\u201d you chuckled, \u201cHe is an alien.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence, Eddie was looking at you. You were sipping on your coffee. It was your second cup since arriving at Eddie\u2019s. You couldn\u2019t tell if you were jittery from the coffee of the stress of what happened to you not even an hour ago.</p><p>\u201cIs this whole Venom thing what you wanted to tell me at Val\u2019s?\u201d You titled your head as you looked at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cN-no it isn\u2019t,\u201d He looked down, trying to avoid telling you.</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019ve been keeping two secrets from me then?\u201d You poked his shoulder roughly but playfully.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d He chuckled nervously, \u201cI don\u2019t know if now is the right time.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cStop being a pussy and tell her, Edster,\u201d</b> Venom poked out from behind Eddie, making you laugh.</p><p>\u201cI like him,\u201d You giggled and winked at Venom.</p><p><b>\u201cThe feeling is mutual, (Y/N),</b>\u201d Venom hissed back playfully. Eddie rolled his eyes and let out a huff.</p><p>\u201cI- I like you (Y/N),\u201d Eddie rushed his words out, \u201cRomantically. And I have liked you for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie\u2026\u201d You whispered, a somewhat shocked expression on your face.</p><p>\u201cI know I told you to go get with another guy, which was so dumb,\u201d Eddie began to ramble, \u201cBut I thought it would help to get over you, it didn\u2019t work and\u2026 and I think I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie,\u201d You spoke up a little bit, your voice firm.</p><p>\u201cI know, its stupid, I shouldn\u2019t have-\u201d Eddie was cut off by you resting your hands on either side of his face.</p><p>He gazed into your eyes and you smiled, not saying a word. Eddie just sat there staring into you, wondering what your next move was. Your face inched closer to him before your lips smoothly crashed on to his.</p><p>\u201cI think I might love you too, Ed\u2019\u201d You chuckled as you pulled away from the kiss.</p><p>Every feeling you\u2019ve ever felt about Eddie finally made sense. All the dreamy looks, all the conversations that lasted for hours, all the times you\u2019d smile when you merely heard his name. Eddie was the one you were meant to be with this whole time, how could you not see it before? He laughed, his face full of relief and joy.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d You smirked, \u201cNow what\u2019s with all those packs of tater tots in your fridge?\u201d</p><p>Eddie laughed heartily and put a hand on your cheek lovingly. The two of you talked the night away and fell asleep in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>",

You finally made it into the bedroom where you found Greyson laying on the bed. His arms were crossed and if his eyes were open he\u2019d be staring at the ceiling. He looked very peaceful, you couldn\u2019t tell if he was sleeping or not, so you just laid down next to him. Your head gently lay on his shoulder and you soon found your breathing patterns matching his.</p><p>\u201cHey, (Y/N),\u201d Greyson greeted softly, he didn\u2019t move or open his eyes, and his voice sounded rougher than normal.</p><p>\u201cYou doin\u2019 okay?\u201d You asked as you pressed a soft kiss to his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfect,\u201d His words began to sound harsh, angry, \u201cHow is Eddie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d You sat up so you could get a better look at his face, \u201cBabe, what\u2019s wrong?</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping with Eddie?\u201d His voice was below a whisper, but you heard him loud and clear.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Grey-\u201d Your voice faltered slightly, \u201cNothing like that is happening between me and Eddie.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at you with more anger than you thought was possible with him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on your schedule,\u201d Greyson hissed, \u201cAnd today you broke your schedule to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you even know about that?\u201d You furrowed your brows.</p><p>Greyson growled in anger and before you could even think of fighting back he had you pinned down underneath him.</p><p>\u201cYou lying slut,\u201d Greyson\u2019s voice was laced with poison, \u201cI know you\u2019re cheating on me! Just admit it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t admit to something I haven\u2019t done, Grey!\u201d You cried out, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d</p><p>He growled and you felt his hands move roughly from your shoulders to your neck. It took mere seconds before you couldn\u2019t breathe. You squirmed and tried to pull his hands off of your neck, but each time you tried the tighter he choked you. It wasn\u2019t long before you started getting dizzy, the string of insults and profanities escaping Greysons mouth were becoming jumbled into your thoughts.</p><p>\u2018Breathe. Just fucking breathe!\u2019 you thought to yourself.</p><p>You tried to escape his grasp once more and you felt his lips crash onto yours. You couldn\u2019t turn your head to escape his kiss that tried to soothe you into death. You lay there waiting, waiting for him to stop. Waiting for him to just kill you already. Waiting for yourself to lose consciousness.</p><p>Suddenly Greyson was flung off of you, you didn\u2019t see what but you could hear a monstrous growl in the room. You decided to focus on breathing. You got your strength back a little bit and sat up in the bed. Your eyes widened and your jaw nearly fell through the floor when you saw a giant figure towering above Greyson.</p><p>It was huge and muscular, covered in what looked like thick black ink. Its eyes were almost the scariest part, they were big and white, shaped like a strange moon cut in half. Its teeth, there were so many, they were so sharp. Its long pink tongue swirled out of its mouth as it picked up Greyson.</p><p><b>\u201cYou might want to look away, sweetheart,\u201d</b> The creature hissed.</p><p>You wanted to look away, and how you wish you had. You saw the creature bite Greyson\u2019s entire head off with a deafening crack of his neck. You quickly covered your mouth as to hold back the screams that were caught in your throat anyway.</p><p>You were quickly blinded by your fear induced tears, and only heard the rest of Greyson being devoured by the creature.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t breathe again, but no one\u2019s hands were around your neck. You clutched onto your chest and everything was blurry. You couldn\u2019t focus on anything, you could hardly hear anything.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)? (Y/N) \u00a0are you okay?\u201d Eddie was right in front of you, his hands gently placed on your biceps and a concerned look plastered on his face.</p><p>You came to your senses and looked him in the eyes with your tearful ones. He quickly pulled you into a hug, a sudden sob racked through you. It was then that you noticed that your entire body was shaking. You heard Eddie cooing reassurances in your ear, rubbing your back gently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay you\u2019re safe now, (Y/N),\u201d Eddie whispers.</p><p>\u201cEd-Eddie what was that.. that thing?\u201d You managed to ask, referring to the creature you had witnessed just minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Venom,\u201d Eddie responded calmly, \u201cHe and I are sorta\u2026 stuck together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Your tears finally stopped, and you felt like you had a clearer mind. Well, as clear as it gets after your boyfriend tries to kill you then gets eaten by a giant ink monster.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d Eddie backed away from you, allowing the black inky goo to begin covering his body slowly. The black goo formed the creature you saw previously, and you stared in awe. Half of its face pulled back to reveal Eddies face.</p><p><b>\u201cWe\u2026 Are Venom,\u201d</b> Eddie and Venom spoke at the same time.</p><p>You were nearly speechless, but managed a small, \u201cIncredible\u2026\u201d</p><p>Venom\u2019s black tendrils climbed back to their hiding place, leaving just you and Eddie.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of questions but,\u201d You stood up, \u201cCould we maybe go to your place? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to stay sane here.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo, how did you know I was in danger?\u201d You asked while nursing a cup of coffee on Eddie\u2019s couch.</p><p>Eddie has been sat next to you for the past thirty minutes, trying to answer your questions to the best of his ability.</p><p>\u201cUh, V\u2019 told me,\u201d Eddie cleared his throat, \u201cI guess he has better senses than we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that makes sense,\u201d you chuckled, \u201cHe is an alien.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence, Eddie was looking at you. You were sipping on your coffee. It was your second cup since arriving at Eddie\u2019s. You couldn\u2019t tell if you were jittery from the coffee of the stress of what happened to you not even an hour ago.</p><p>\u201cIs this whole Venom thing what you wanted to tell me at Val\u2019s?\u201d You titled your head as you looked at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cN-no it isn\u2019t,\u201d He looked down, trying to avoid telling you.</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019ve been keeping two secrets from me then?\u201d You poked his shoulder roughly but playfully.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d He chuckled nervously, \u201cI don\u2019t know if now is the right time.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cStop being a pussy and tell her, Edster,\u201d</b> Venom poked out from behind Eddie, making you laugh.</p><p>\u201cI like him,\u201d You giggled and winked at Venom.</p><p><b>\u201cThe feeling is mutual, (Y/N),</b>\u201d Venom hissed back playfully. Eddie rolled his eyes and let out a huff.</p><p>\u201cI- I like you (Y/N),\u201d Eddie rushed his words out, \u201cRomantically. And I have liked you for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie\u2026\u201d You whispered, a somewhat shocked expression on your face.</p><p>\u201cI know I told you to go get with another guy, which was so dumb,\u201d Eddie began to ramble, \u201cBut I thought it would help to get over you, it didn\u2019t work and\u2026 and I think I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie,\u201d You spoke up a little bit, your voice firm.</p><p>\u201cI know, its stupid, I shouldn\u2019t have-\u201d Eddie was cut off by you resting your hands on either side of his face.</p><p>He gazed into your eyes and you smiled, not saying a word. Eddie just sat there staring into you, wondering what your next move was. Your face inched closer to him before your lips smoothly crashed on to his.</p><p>\u201cI think I might love you too, Ed\u2019\u201d You chuckled as you pulled away from the kiss.</p><p>Every feeling you\u2019ve ever felt about Eddie finally made sense. All the dreamy looks, all the conversations that lasted for hours, all the times you\u2019d smile when you merely heard his name. Eddie was the one you were meant to be with this whole time, how could you not see it before? He laughed, his face full of relief and joy.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d You smirked, \u201cNow what\u2019s with all those packs of tater tots in your fridge?\u201d</p><p>Eddie laughed heartily and put a hand on your cheek lovingly. The two of you talked the night away and fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms.</p>",

The schedule helped keep you in order, and you knew you\u2019d be an anxious mess without it. Luckily the two prominent people in your life helped to keep your schedule intact each week.</p><p><i>1.Wake up</i></p><p>You woke with a sigh, sunlight creeping into the room through your sheer white curtains. You turned your head to the man lying next to you with a smile. Greyson. Greyson Marlow was your boyfriend of nine months, he decided to move in with you a month ago. Things with him always moved fast, but it felt right. Greyson never treated you badly, he cared about you and always trusted you. He was the perfect guy. You imagined getting married to him and having children, even before you started dating him. You had the biggest crush on him, finally getting the courage once your best friend told you to go for it.</p><p>You watched Greyson as his eyes fluttered open, letting out a heavy breath as he pulled you closer to him. Your soft giggle made him smile wide, his eyes filled with adoration.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019 (Y/N),\u201d he murmured sweetly as he pressed a kiss to your forehead.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Grey,\u201d You smiled warmly at him. Your heart flutters when he returns an adoring smile.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get some food in you before you gotta go to work,\u201d He chuckled and sat up, \u201cIt\u2019s Friday, date night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhmm..\u201d You nuzzled into his side, not really wanting to get up. You wanted to stay in bed with Greyson all day, but you knew you couldn\u2019t. He pulled away from you and climbed out of the bed, his sweet smile never faltering. The two of you enjoyed each others presence, it sweet and calm. The entire thing was so much better than what you\u2019re used to, it almost seemed too perfect.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, love,\u201d He reached out his hand to help you stand, you graciously took it. You couldn\u2019t help but feel intoxicated every time his eyes gazed into your own. Greyson was this angelic being, mystical and magical, he could never do wrong.</p><p>As Greyson eventually pulled you into the kitchen, you went straight for the coffee and he went straight for the fridge. \u00a0This has been the norm for the past month, you prepare coffee while he prepares breakfast then you eat together. You ate your perfectly cooked eggs and sparsely sip your coffee in a comfortable silence with Greyson. \u00a0You hoped that every morning would be as peaceful as this one.</p><p><i>2.Work</i></p><p>After showering and getting dressed, you trudged on to work. You hoped that today wouldn\u2019t be another slow day. As much as you enjoyed relaxation, you couldn\u2019t handle any more days without a decent amount of work to do. You breathed in the chill San Francisco air before opening the door the building you work in. You worked for a small local journalism company which didn\u2019t pay too well, but you also did freelance work on the side.</p><p>\u201cMorning (Y/N),\u201d Your boss, Mr Belleville, greeted.</p><p>\u201cMorning Mr Belleville,\u201d you responded cheerily while sitting down at your desk.</p><p>You felt your phone buzz and saw a text from Eddie. Eddie. Eddie Brock has been your best friend for a year, you met him when you first moved to San Fransisco. He was possibly the strangest man you\u2019d ever met, and you were possibly the weirdest woman he had ever met. You could tell him anything on your mind, and vice versa, but it wasn\u2019t like you would. Some things just need to stay unsaid.</p><p><b><i>Eddie: I know its out of schedule but could we do lunch today?</i></b></p><p>You sighed, not wanting to go out of your schedule. You agreed to meet Eddie for lunch despite the weird feeling in your stomach. Every time you thought about Eddie you smiled, the man meant the world to you. You pictured his face deep in thought and then smiling when you\u2019d been caught staring by him. The images playing in your mind we\u2019re almost enough to make you giggle to yourself. Eddie was the most incredible best friend you could ask for. He even helped you gather the confidence to confess your feelings to Greyson.</p><p>You looked through the files on your desk, you realized you forgot to put away a bunch of your completed work. Sighing, you accepted your fate of having a boring workday.</p><p>\u201cFuck this..\u201d you murmured as you began to filed some papers.</p><p>You missed all the big crimes, those really gave you something to work on. You were bored of the local murderers. How you would kill for a big crime lord to take down with your impressive research skills. It had been months since your last big project. Boredom got the best of you and you waited for what felt like days for your lunch break.</p><p><i>3. Meet Eddie on your lunch break- Only on Tuesdays and Thursdays- then go back to work</i></p><p>Finally! It was time for your lunch break after filing papers and proofreading some upcoming articles. You clocked out and headed towards Val\u2019s Diner. Val\u2019s was yours and Eddies spot, almost every time you had lunch or hung out with him it was at Val\u2019s. You smiled as you saw that Eddie was already inside sitting at your favourite booth, your smile quickly faded when you noticed how upset he looked. He seemed sad and frustrated, you decided to enter the diner with a neutral expression.</p><p>Eddies head shot up as he heard a bell that signalled a new customer entering. The corners of his mouth curled up ever so slightly when he saw you. You flashed a small smile as you approached and sat down across from him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lucky man, Ed,\u201d You smirked, \u201cI don\u2019t go off schedule for just anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,(Y/N), I know,\u201d Eddie chuckled, \u201cI just\u2026 wanted to see you, \u2018s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay? You seem a bit,\u201d You paused to find the right word, \u201coff.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and reassured you that he was fine before a waitress dropped off some plates full of warm and delicious smelling food. One of the plates you recognized as your usual, but there were two other meals for Eddie.</p><p>\u201cYou invite someone else I don\u2019t know about?\u201d You chuckled as you took a bite of your sandwich.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d He titled his head in confusion, a mouthful of food muffling him.</p><p>\u201cYou normally only get one meal,\u201d You quirked an eyebrow at him, \u201cI was just messing with you.\u201d</p><p>Eddie smirked and swallowed his food. His eyes stayed on you for a little too long, but your eyes were on him too. You felt strange, sitting there staring at your best friend.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you really want to have lunch today, Ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I wanted to see you,\u201d He repeated before you gave him a stern glare, \u201cOkay fine! I have something to tell you but I-uh I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keepin\u2019 secrets from me now?\u201d Your tone turned serious, you never had secrets with Eddie. You were always one hundred per cent honest with him, no secrets and no big lies.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N),\u201d his voice was serious too, but a little quieter than it was before, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing really, don\u2019t worry about.\u201d</p><p>You nodded. For a second you could\u2019ve sworn you saw something change in his eyes, you thought you saw them turn blank white. You could tell the smile he offered was forced, but you offered a tight-lipped smile anyway. The two of you ate in silence from that point on, not a comfortable silence. The silence made you feel queasy, but maybe it was actually that weird feeling of being watched since you left work.</p><p><i>4. Go on a date with Greyson- Friday and Saturday</i></p><p>You finally went home after what felt like pointless hours at work and the awkward lunch with Eddie. You never really shook that feeling of being watched that entire day. Hopefully, Greyson could make this weird day better.</p><p>\u201cGrey,\u201d You called out, \u201cYou home?\u201d</p><p>No response. You looked around the small but nicely decorated apartment. You finally made it into the bedroom where you found Greyson laying on the bed. His arms were crossed and if his eyes were open he\u2019d be staring at the ceiling. He looked very peaceful, you couldn\u2019t tell if he was sleeping or not, so you just laid down next to him. Your head gently lay on his shoulder and you soon found your breathing patterns matching his.</p><p>\u201cHey, (Y/N),\u201d Greyson greeted softly, he didn\u2019t move or open his eyes, and his voice sounded rougher than normal.</p><p>\u201cYou doin\u2019 okay?\u201d You asked as you pressed a soft kiss to his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfect,\u201d His words began to sound harsh, angry, \u201cHow is Eddie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d You sat up so you could get a better look at his face, \u201cBabe, what\u2019s wrong?</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping with Eddie?\u201d His voice was below a whisper, but you heard him loud and clear.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Grey-\u201d Your voice faltered slightly, \u201cNothing like that is happening between me and Eddie.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at you with more anger than you thought was possible with him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on your schedule,\u201d Greyson hissed, \u201cAnd today you broke your schedule to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you even know about that?\u201d You furrowed your brows.</p><p>Greyson growled in anger and before you could even think of fighting back he had you pinned down underneath him.</p><p>\u201cYou lying slut,\u201d Greyson\u2019s voice was laced with poison, \u201cI know you\u2019re cheating on me! Just admit it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t admit to something I haven\u2019t done, Grey!\u201d You cried out, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d</p><p>He growled and you felt his hands move roughly from your shoulders to your neck. It took mere seconds before you couldn\u2019t breathe. You squirmed and tried to pull his hands off of your neck, but each time you tried the tighter he choked you. It wasn\u2019t long before you started getting dizzy, the string of insults and profanities escaping Greysons mouth were becoming jumbled into your thoughts.</p><p>\u2018Breathe. Just fucking breathe!\u2019 you thought to yourself.</p><p>You tried to escape his grasp once more and you felt his lips crash onto yours. You couldn\u2019t turn your head to escape his kiss that tried to soothe you into death. You lay there waiting, waiting for him to stop. Waiting for him to just kill you already. Waiting for yourself to lose consciousness.</p><p>Suddenly Greyson was flung off of you, you didn\u2019t see what but you could hear a monstrous growl in the room. You decided to focus on breathing. You got your strength back a little bit and sat up in the bed. Your eyes widened and your jaw nearly fell through the floor when you saw a giant figure towering above Greyson.</p><p>It was huge and muscular, covered in what looked like thick black ink. Its eyes were almost the scariest part, they were big and white, shaped like a strange moon cut in half. Its teeth, there were so many, they were so sharp. Its long pink tongue swirled out of its mouth as it picked up Greyson.</p><p><b>\u201cYou might want to look away, sweetheart,\u201d</b> The creature hissed.</p><p>You wanted to look away, and how you wish you had. You saw the creature bite Greyson\u2019s entire head off with a deafening crack of his neck. You quickly covered your mouth as to hold back the screams that were caught in your throat anyway.</p><p>You were quickly blinded by your fear induced tears, and only heard the rest of Greyson being devoured by the creature.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t breathe again, but no one\u2019s hands were around your neck. You clutched onto your chest and everything was blurry. You couldn\u2019t focus on anything, you could hardly hear anything.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)? (Y/N) \u00a0are you okay?\u201d Eddie was right in front of you, his hands gently placed on your biceps and a concerned look plastered on his face.</p><p>You came to your senses and looked him in the eyes with your tearful ones. He quickly pulled you into a hug, a sudden sob racked through you. It was then that you noticed that your entire body was shaking. You heard Eddie cooing reassurances in your ear, rubbing your back gently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay you\u2019re safe now, (Y/N),\u201d Eddie whispers.</p><p>\u201cEd-Eddie what was that.. that thing?\u201d You managed to ask, referring to the creature you had witnessed just minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Venom,\u201d Eddie responded calmly, \u201cHe and I are sorta\u2026 stuck together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Your tears finally stopped, and you felt like you had a clearer mind. Well, as clear as it gets after your boyfriend tries to kill you then gets eaten by a giant ink monster.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d Eddie backed away from you, allowing the black inky goo to begin covering his body slowly. The black goo formed the creature you saw previously, and you stared in awe. Half of its face pulled back to reveal Eddies face.</p><p><b>\u201cWe\u2026 Are Venom,\u201d</b> Eddie and Venom spoke at the same time.</p><p>You were nearly speechless, but managed a small, \u201cIncredible\u2026\u201d</p><p>Venom\u2019s black tendrils climbed back to their hiding place, leaving just you and Eddie.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of questions but,\u201d You stood up, \u201cCould we maybe go to your place? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to stay sane here.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo, how did you know I was in danger?\u201d You asked while nursing a cup of coffee on Eddie\u2019s couch.</p><p>Eddie has been sat next to you for the past thirty minutes, trying to answer your questions to the best of his ability.</p><p>\u201cUh, V\u2019 told me,\u201d Eddie cleared his throat, \u201cI guess he has better senses than we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that makes sense,\u201d you chuckled, \u201cHe is an alien.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence, Eddie was looking at you. You were sipping on your coffee. It was your second cup since arriving at Eddie\u2019s. You couldn\u2019t tell if you were jittery from the coffee of the stress of what happened to you not even an hour ago.</p><p>\u201cIs this whole Venom thing what you wanted to tell me at Val\u2019s?\u201d You titled your head as you looked at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cN-no it isn\u2019t,\u201d He looked down, trying to avoid telling you.</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019ve been keeping two secrets from me then?\u201d You poked his shoulder roughly but playfully.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d He chuckled nervously, \u201cI don\u2019t know if now is the right time.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cStop being a pussy and tell her, Edster,\u201d</b> Venom poked out from behind Eddie, making you laugh.</p><p>\u201cI like him,\u201d You giggled and winked at Venom.</p><p><b>\u201cThe feeling is mutual, (Y/N),</b>\u201d Venom hissed back playfully. Eddie rolled his eyes and let out a huff.</p><p>\u201cI- I like you (Y/N),\u201d Eddie rushed his words out, \u201cRomantically. And I have liked you for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie\u2026\u201d You whispered, a somewhat shocked expression on your face.</p><p>\u201cI know I told you to go get with another guy, which was so dumb,\u201d Eddie began to ramble, \u201cBut I thought it would help to get over you, it didn\u2019t work and\u2026 and I think I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie,\u201d You spoke up a little bit, your voice firm.</p><p>\u201cI know, its stupid, I shouldn\u2019t have-\u201d Eddie was cut off by you resting your hands on either side of his face.</p><p>He gazed into your eyes and you smiled, not saying a word. Eddie just sat there staring into you, wondering what your next move was. Your face inched closer to him before your lips smoothly crashed on to his.</p><p>\u201cI think I might love you too, Ed\u2019\u201d You chuckled as you pulled away from the kiss.</p><p>Every feeling you\u2019ve ever felt about Eddie finally made sense. All the dreamy looks, all the conversations that lasted for hours, all the times you\u2019d smile when you merely heard his name. Eddie was the one you were meant to be with this whole time, how could you not see it before? He laughed, his face full of relief and joy.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d You smirked, \u201cNow what\u2019s with all those packs of tater tots in your fridge?\u201d</p><p>Eddie laughed heartily and put a hand on your cheek lovingly. The two of you talked the night away and fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms.</p>",

I hope you like it</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>(not my gif)</p><hr /><p>You always had a schedule, it might be a rather small schedule but it was one you never broke. The schedule helped keep you in order, and you knew you&rsquo;d be an anxious mess without it. Luckily the two prominent people in your life helped to keep your schedule intact each week.</p><p><i>1.Wake up</i></p><p>You woke with a sigh, sunlight creeping into the room through your sheer white curtains. You turned your head to the man lying next to you with a smile. Greyson. Greyson Marlow was your boyfriend of nine months, he decided to move in with you a month ago. Things with him always moved fast, but it felt right. Greyson never treated you badly, he cared about you and always trusted you. He was the perfect guy. You imagined getting married to him and having children, even before you started dating him. You had the biggest crush on him, finally getting the courage once your best friend told you to go for it.</p><p>You watched Greyson as his eyes fluttered open, letting out a heavy breath as he pulled you closer to him. Your soft giggle made him smile wide, his eyes filled with adoration.</p><p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; (Y/N),&rdquo; he murmured sweetly as he pressed a kiss to your forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, Grey,&rdquo; You smiled warmly at him. Your heart flutters when he returns an adoring smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get some food in you before you gotta go to work,&rdquo; He chuckled and sat up, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Friday, date night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmhmm..&rdquo; You nuzzled into his side, not really wanting to get up. You wanted to stay in bed with Greyson all day, but you knew you couldn&rsquo;t. He pulled away from you and climbed out of the bed, his sweet smile never faltering. The two of you enjoyed each others presence, it sweet and calm. The entire thing was so much better than what you&rsquo;re used to, it almost seemed too perfect.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, love,&rdquo; He reached out his hand to help you stand, you graciously took it. You couldn&rsquo;t help but feel intoxicated every time his eyes gazed into your own. Greyson was this angelic being, mystical and magical, he could never do wrong.</p><p>As Greyson eventually pulled you into the kitchen, you went straight for the coffee and he went straight for the fridge. &nbsp;This has been the norm for the past month, you prepare coffee while he prepares breakfast then you eat together. You ate your perfectly cooked eggs and sparsely sip your coffee in a comfortable silence with Greyson. &nbsp;You hoped that every morning would be as peaceful as this one.</p><p><i>2.Work</i></p><p>After showering and getting dressed, you trudged on to work. You hoped that today wouldn&rsquo;t be another slow day. As much as you enjoyed relaxation, you couldn&rsquo;t handle any more days without a decent amount of work to do. You breathed in the chill San Francisco air before opening the door the building you work in. You worked for a small local journalism company which didn&rsquo;t pay too well, but you also did freelance work on the side.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning (Y/N),&rdquo; Your boss, Mr Belleville, greeted.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning Mr Belleville,&rdquo; you responded cheerily while sitting down at your desk.</p><p>You felt your phone buzz and saw a text from Eddie. Eddie. Eddie Brock has been your best friend for a year, you met him when you first moved to San Fransisco. He was possibly the strangest man you&rsquo;d ever met, and you were possibly the weirdest woman he had ever met. You could tell him anything on your mind, and vice versa, but it wasn&rsquo;t like you would. Some things just need to stay unsaid.</p><p><b><i>Eddie: I know its out of schedule but could we do lunch today?</i></b></p><p>You sighed, not wanting to go out of your schedule. You agreed to meet Eddie for lunch despite the weird feeling in your stomach. Every time you thought about Eddie you smiled, the man meant the world to you. You pictured his face deep in thought and then smiling when you&rsquo;d been caught staring by him. The images playing in your mind we&rsquo;re almost enough to make you giggle to yourself. Eddie was the most incredible best friend you could ask for. He even helped you gather the confidence to confess your feelings to Greyson.</p><p>You looked through the files on your desk, you realized you forgot to put away a bunch of your completed work. Sighing, you accepted your fate of having a boring workday.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck this..&rdquo; you murmured as you began to filed some papers.</p><p>You missed all the big crimes, those really gave you something to work on. You were bored of the local murderers. How you would kill for a big crime lord to take down with your impressive research skills. It had been months since your last big project. Boredom got the best of you and you waited for what felt like days for your lunch break.</p><p><i>3. Meet Eddie on your lunch break- Only on Tuesdays and Thursdays- then go back to work</i></p><p>Finally! It was time for your lunch break after filing papers and proofreading some upcoming articles. You clocked out and headed towards Val&rsquo;s Diner. Val&rsquo;s was yours and Eddies spot, almost every time you had lunch or hung out with him it was at Val&rsquo;s. You smiled as you saw that Eddie was already inside sitting at your favourite booth, your smile quickly faded when you noticed how upset he looked. He seemed sad and frustrated, you decided to enter the diner with a neutral expression.</p><p>Eddies head shot up as he heard a bell that signalled a new customer entering. The corners of his mouth curled up ever so slightly when he saw you. You flashed a small smile as you approached and sat down across from him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lucky man, Ed,&rdquo; You smirked, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go off schedule for just anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,(Y/N), I know,&rdquo; Eddie chuckled, &ldquo;I just&hellip; wanted to see you, &lsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is everything okay? You seem a bit,&rdquo; You paused to find the right word, &ldquo;off.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded and reassured you that he was fine before a waitress dropped off some plates full of warm and delicious smelling food. One of the plates you recognized as your usual, but there were two other meals for Eddie.</p><p>&ldquo;You invite someone else I don&rsquo;t know about?&rdquo; You chuckled as you took a bite of your sandwich.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; He titled his head in confusion, a mouthful of food muffling him.</p><p>&ldquo;You normally only get one meal,&rdquo; You quirked an eyebrow at him, &ldquo;I was just messing with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Eddie smirked and swallowed his food. His eyes stayed on you for a little too long, but your eyes were on him too. You felt strange, sitting there staring at your best friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you really want to have lunch today, Ed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I wanted to see you,&rdquo; He repeated before you gave him a stern glare, &ldquo;Okay fine! I have something to tell you but I-uh I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You keepin&rsquo; secrets from me now?&rdquo; Your tone turned serious, you never had secrets with Eddie. You were always one hundred per cent honest with him, no secrets and no big lies.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N),&rdquo; his voice was serious too, but a little quieter than it was before, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing really, don&rsquo;t worry about.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded. For a second you could&rsquo;ve sworn you saw something change in his eyes, you thought you saw them turn blank white. You could tell the smile he offered was forced, but you offered a tight-lipped smile anyway. The two of you ate in silence from that point on, not a comfortable silence. The silence made you feel queasy, but maybe it was actually that weird feeling of being watched since you left work.</p><p><i>4. Go on a date with Greyson- Friday and Saturday</i></p><p>You finally went home after what felt like pointless hours at work and the awkward lunch with Eddie. You never really shook that feeling of being watched that entire day. Hopefully, Greyson could make this weird day better.</p><p>&ldquo;Grey,&rdquo; You called out, &ldquo;You home?&rdquo;</p><p>No response. You looked around the small but nicely decorated apartment. You finally made it into the bedroom where you found Greyson laying on the bed. His arms were crossed and if his eyes were open he&rsquo;d be staring at the ceiling. He looked very peaceful, you couldn&rsquo;t tell if he was sleeping or not, so you just laid down next to him. Your head gently lay on his shoulder and you soon found your breathing patterns matching his.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, (Y/N),&rdquo; Greyson greeted softly, he didn&rsquo;t move or open his eyes, and his voice sounded rougher than normal.</p><p>&ldquo;You doin&rsquo; okay?&rdquo; You asked as you pressed a soft kiss to his cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfect,&rdquo; His words began to sound harsh, angry, &ldquo;How is Eddie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; You sat up so you could get a better look at his face, &ldquo;Babe, what&rsquo;s wrong?</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sleeping with Eddie?&rdquo; His voice was below a whisper, but you heard him loud and clear.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Grey-&rdquo; Your voice faltered slightly, &ldquo;Nothing like that is happening between me and Eddie.&rdquo;</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at you with more anger than you thought was possible with him.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s on your schedule,&rdquo; Greyson hissed, &ldquo;And today you broke your schedule to see him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you even know about that?&rdquo; You furrowed your brows.</p><p>Greyson growled in anger and before you could even think of fighting back he had you pinned down underneath him.</p><p>&ldquo;You lying slut,&rdquo; Greyson&rsquo;s voice was laced with poison, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re cheating on me! Just admit it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t admit to something I haven&rsquo;t done, Grey!&rdquo; You cried out, &ldquo;What the hell are you doing?!&rdquo;</p><p>He growled and you felt his hands move roughly from your shoulders to your neck. It took mere seconds before you couldn&rsquo;t breathe. You squirmed and tried to pull his hands off of your neck, but each time you tried the tighter he choked you. It wasn&rsquo;t long before you started getting dizzy, the string of insults and profanities escaping Greysons mouth were becoming jumbled into your thoughts.</p><p>&lsquo;Breathe. Just fucking breathe!&rsquo; you thought to yourself.</p><p>You tried to escape his grasp once more and you felt his lips crash onto yours. You couldn&rsquo;t turn your head to escape his kiss that tried to soothe you into death. You lay there waiting, waiting for him to stop. Waiting for him to just kill you already. Waiting for yourself to lose consciousness.</p><p>Suddenly Greyson was flung off of you, you didn&rsquo;t see what but you could hear a monstrous growl in the room. You decided to focus on breathing. You got your strength back a little bit and sat up in the bed. Your eyes widened and your jaw nearly fell through the floor when you saw a giant figure towering above Greyson.</p><p>It was huge and muscular, covered in what looked like thick black ink. Its eyes were almost the scariest part, they were big and white, shaped like a strange moon cut in half. Its teeth, there were so many, they were so sharp. Its long pink tongue swirled out of its mouth as it picked up Greyson.</p><p><b>&ldquo;You might want to look away, sweetheart,&rdquo;</b> The creature hissed.</p><p>You wanted to look away, and how you wish you had. You saw the creature bite Greyson&rsquo;s entire head off with a deafening crack of his neck. You quickly covered your mouth as to hold back the screams that were caught in your throat anyway.</p><p>You were quickly blinded by your fear induced tears, and only heard the rest of Greyson being devoured by the creature.</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t breathe again, but no one&rsquo;s hands were around your neck. You clutched onto your chest and everything was blurry. You couldn&rsquo;t focus on anything, you could hardly hear anything.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)? (Y/N) &nbsp;are you okay?&rdquo; Eddie was right in front of you, his hands gently placed on your biceps and a concerned look plastered on his face.</p><p>You came to your senses and looked him in the eyes with your tearful ones. He quickly pulled you into a hug, a sudden sob racked through you. It was then that you noticed that your entire body was shaking. You heard Eddie cooing reassurances in your ear, rubbing your back gently.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay you&rsquo;re safe now, (Y/N),&rdquo; Eddie whispers.</p><p>&ldquo;Ed-Eddie what was that.. that thing?&rdquo; You managed to ask, referring to the creature you had witnessed just minutes ago.</p><p>&ldquo;His name is Venom,&rdquo; Eddie responded calmly, &ldquo;He and I are sorta&hellip; stuck together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Your tears finally stopped, and you felt like you had a clearer mind. Well, as clear as it gets after your boyfriend tries to kill you then gets eaten by a giant ink monster.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; Eddie backed away from you, allowing the black inky goo to begin covering his body slowly. The black goo formed the creature you saw previously, and you stared in awe. Half of its face pulled back to reveal Eddies face.</p><p><b>&ldquo;We&hellip; Are Venom,&rdquo;</b> Eddie and Venom spoke at the same time.</p><p>You were nearly speechless, but managed a small, &ldquo;Incredible&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Venom&rsquo;s black tendrils climbed back to their hiding place, leaving just you and Eddie.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a lot of questions but,&rdquo; You stood up, &ldquo;Could we maybe go to your place?

It was such an important day, and yet, nobody really knows what happened. So I guess I\u2019ll just start from the beginning&hellip; We were sitting in my apartment, close on the couch, her in my arms, the news on the TV. New York had been through a wild ride, so we were lucky to be up in Seattle. Word of a second invasion was spreading, not in the big apple, but in another country too. We were petrified. Neither of us could move, eyes glued to the television screen. No one could quite make out what was happening other than a truckload of destruction earlier this morning. There were reports of a large figure with a massive ax, accompanied by a smaller one that could move things with his mind. Flash forward a few hours and new york has been abandoned; not by people, but the invaders. News reports went berserk, blaming Tony Stark and talking about reported sightings of Steve Rogers. At this point there wasn\u2019t too much concern for us here in Seattle, most of the stuff that happens in New York stayed there. Obviously, my girlfriend and I were concerned, but we decided to not give it too much thought and went on with our day. See, luckily we both had off, It was our first anniversary of being together\u2026 officially. Jump ahead an hour or two again. That\u2019s when things started to go haywire. Reports of a war broke out in Wakanda. Hundreds of thousands of what looked like these six-legged animal creatures. It was really hard to get a close look at them, but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what they were and why they were there. The fight was brutal; there were so many of those things, but so little warriors. There\u2019s one shot I\u2019ll always remember, though, It was hard to believe at the time. An aerial capture of a man we came to know as the Black Panther, and another\u2026 An aged Steve Rogers. His hair was grown out and pushed back, and by the looks of it, he had a bit of a beard. Running, They ran extraordinarily fast, much much quicker than any of the warriors, even faster than the two flying ones. The battle went on for a good few hours but then there was this extremely bright flash of light. The TV went blank. The lights flickered, then went out.

It was really hard to get a close look at them, but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what they were and why they were there. The fight was brutal; there were so many of those things, but so little warriors. There\u2019s one shot I\u2019ll always remember, though, It was hard to believe at the time. An aerial capture of a man we came to know as the Black Panther, and another\u2026 An aged Steve Rogers. His hair was grown out and pushed back, and by the looks of it, he had a bit of a beard. Running, They ran extraordinarily fast, much much quicker than any of the warriors, even faster than the two flying ones. The battle went on for a good few hours but then there was this extremely bright flash of light. The TV went blank. The lights flickered, then went out.

I&rsquo;ll never forget her face&hellip; Her goddamn face. It was such an important day, and yet, nobody really knows what happened. So I guess I&rsquo;ll just start from the beginning&hellip; We were sitting in my apartment, close on the couch, her in my arms, the news on the TV. New York had been through a wild ride, so we were lucky to be up in Seattle. Word of a second invasion was spreading, not in the big apple, but in another country too. We were petrified. Neither of us could move, eyes glued to the television screen. No one could quite make out what was happening other than a truckload of destruction earlier this morning. There were reports of a large figure with a massive ax, accompanied by a smaller one that could move things with his mind. Flash forward a few hours and new york has been abandoned; not by people, but the invaders. News reports went berserk, blaming Tony Stark and talking about reported sightings of Steve Rogers. At this point there wasn&rsquo;t too much concern for us here in Seattle, most of the stuff that happens in New York stayed there. Obviously, my girlfriend and I were concerned, but we decided to not give it too much thought and went on with our day.
