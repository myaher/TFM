Once you sat down\nyou saw a text. </p><p>Mara: Is it okay if we head back to the hotel or do\nyou want us to wait for you? </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d you told Chris as you texted back that they\ncould go without you and you\u2019ll see them once they get back to the park. </p><p>Kate: Way to ditch us!</p><p>\u201cTexting your friends?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah they are heading back to the room for a little\nwhile and wanted to make sure I was okay to stay by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was sweet of them.\u201d He offered you a smile and\nyou couldn\u2019t help but smile back.

Not full\nlaugh but enough. \u201cWell right now he is spending time with this cute girl that\nhe met in line.\u201d He winked at you making your cheeks heat up. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if\nyou knew me.

Well not personally cause\nI\u2019m not famous but I understand. Plus, it took me a while to realize where I\nknew you from. Even though your disguise isn\u2019t the best.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell anything more would be too obvious.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou just look like yourself at a baseball game.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright Paul Rudd,\u201d he said laughing and you joined\nhim. Smiling you asked him about his trip and was hopeful to hear that he still\nhad a week left of his trip, although you didn\u2019t get your hopes up that you\ncould get to spend more than just a few hours with him. </p><p>He talked about his family happily and even talked\nabout the mischief him and his brother Scott got up to the other night when\nthey visited Mickey\u2019s Dark Side. </p><p>\u201cHow is Mickey\u2019s Darkside?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been.\u201d He placed a hand on his chest dramatizing\nhis shock. </p><p>You shook your head. \u201cNo one ever wanted to go with me\nor they weren\u2019t old enough to go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI might just have to take you myself.\u201d </p><p>After the show ended, you and Chris were two of the\nlast people to leave the theatre and you sang <i>Be Our Guest</i>, while you skipped up the stairs. Once at the top, you\nturned around to see Chris shaking his head but smiling at you causing you to\nspin around on one foot with arms out wide and your backpack swinging around\nwith you as you continued to sing. </p><p>You paused for a moment as the song switched to\nLumiere\u2019s dramatic solo hoping that Chris would join you. He did sing just a\nfew lines before stopping. You clapped for him cheering bravo. \u201cHow about we go\nget some ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never say no to ice cream,\u201d you told him as you\nslightly followed behind him towards the ice cream stand not sure where he\nwanted to go exactly since you remember there being a few ice cream spots in\nHollywood Studios. </p><p>You ordered the Mickey Ice Cream Sandwich, while Chris\ngot a Mickey Ice Cream Bar, treating you to the dessert even though you tried\nto pay. </p><p>The two of you sat and talked at an empty table near\nsunset boulevard. </p><p>\u201cYou ordered the wrong one,\u201d Chris said gesturing with\nhis mickey to your own. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe ice cream sandwich is better.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt is not!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIce cream sandwiches are always the best!\u201d He shook\nhis head. \u201cI grew up eating these with my family every time that we came to\nDisney World. That\u2019s five people to one.\u201d </p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that. You\u2019ve been to Disney\na lot?\u201d </p><p>You nodded and started telling him a little bit about\nyour family vacations to Disney World, although you\u2019ve been to Disneyland once\nbefore. You told him about your family themselves. Chris then talked about his\nown family trips to Disney World growing up. </p><p>\u201cOnce we got off the ride he ran with our mom to the\nbathroom needing to change his clothes. I kind of felt back but at the time it\nwas hilarious.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPoor Scott.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry he got revenge on me since. Where to\nnext?\u201d </p><p>You looked around even though you knew all the rides\nthat were around you and what rides were farther away. \u201cThere\u2019s Toy Story\nMania, Tower of Terror, and Muppets.\u201d You turned your attention back to him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you pick.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI narrowed down your options,\u201d you told him really\nnot wanting to pick. You hate having to pick things, especially when you had no\nidea what the other person likes to go on.</p><p>He leaned forward just inches away from your face and\nyou could feel your heart rate pick up. \u201cIf you give me a kiss, I\u2019ll pick.\u201d </p><p>Thinking quickly, you offered him a peak on the cheek\nand threw your hands up, \u201cyou never specified where.\u201d A proud smile appeared on\nyour face as you felt your heart rate slow down. You were not nearly brave\nenough to kiss him on the lips. </p><p>He pouted before answering. \u201cHow about Toy Story\nMania?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBe prepared to lose,\u201d you told him. </p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m very much prepared to win.\u201d </p><p>He picked up the two wrappers from the table and\nstarted to get up to throw them away, when you said, \u201cRace you.\u201d </p><p>You took off running and turned around once you got to\nthe end of the street to see him just turning around to chase after you.\nSprinting past the restaurant at the corner, you hurried around the bend of\nAnimation Courtyard and to the back of the Chinese Theatre. You looked for the\nsign only to see it gone. </p><p>\u201cShoot,\u201d you whispered before hurrying off to the new\npart of Toy Story Land hoping that it would be there. It didn\u2019t take you too\nlong to find it just behind where the line used to be. Catching your breath,\nyou stood outside waiting for Chris. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that they moved it,\u201d he said as he\napproached you just a few minutes later. \u201cI kept thinking that I missed it.\u201d </p><p>You headed into the queue with Chris following close\nbehind you. The wait wasn\u2019t as long as it normally was and you were surprised\nthat you were close to the front and loved looking at all the new decorations\nin the queue like the Mister Potato Head that actually talked. </p><p>\u201cHow about we make this interesting,\u201d Chris said. You\nturned towards him and raised your eyebrow at him curiously. \u201cIf you win, you\ncan ask for anything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d you asked with a light chuckle. </p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd if you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d You stuck out your hand for him to\nshake not thinking about it too much. </p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d you asked and he took your hand. </p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, what would you like,\u201d you asked Chris as you spotted\nhim exiting the ride. You waited nearby sitting on the railing as you waited.\nThe two of you got split up by a large family exiting at once. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know, when I decide.\u201d He stopped next to\nyou and you pouted slightly causing Chris to laugh. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re adorable when you pout.\u201d You pouted even more\nand Chris hesitated a moment before leaning in and kissing you. Before you had\ntime to react, he pulled away and you smiled, heat raising to your face. \u00a0\u201cNo more pouting.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo more pouting? Well if that\u2019s the response for\npouting,\u201d you said slowly thinking about it teasingly. You couldn\u2019t believe you\nwere managing to tease. And Chris Evans at that! He was just about how you\nimagined him being in real life and probably was even better. </p><p>\u201cWhere to next,\u201d he asked you chuckling. Your phone\nstarted ringing and you pulled it out to see Kate calling. You answered giving\nChris an apologetic look. </p><p>\u201cY/N! You didn\u2019t answer our texts and we got worried.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cI was on a ride sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Kate said. \u201cWe\u2019re heading back to the\npark now and will be there in like 10 minutes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to meet?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe were thinking of going on Toy Story Mania since we\nhaven\u2019t been on it yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds good! I can wait for you guys there if that\u2019s\nalright.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPerfect! See you!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour friends returning,\u201d Chris asked. You nodded. </p><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t meeting up with your family yet, my\nfriends wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have plans till after 6,\u201d Chris told you\nsmiling. </p><p>\u201cI have to warn you that my one friend is going to\nfreak out when she sees you. So, I\u2019m going to apologize now. Maybe both of them\nactually.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he smiled setting you at ease.\nYou knew that it couldn\u2019t have been easy for him to be famous. You couldn\u2019t\nimagine what it\u2019s like. </p><p>\u201cDo you care if we walk around a little? I haven\u2019t\nseen Toy Story Land yet.\u201d </p><p> \u201cI haven\u2019t\neither,\u201d he said as he gave you a hand to grab onto as you jumped down even\nthough you didn\u2019t need it. He kept a strong grasp on it as you walked further\nin weaving through the crowd as best as you could almost getting lost a few\ntimes. </p><p>The two of you were walking around as aimlessly as you\ncould pointing to all the different details you could find from the movies\nuntil you phone buzzed. You pulled it out and looked to see a picture from your\nfriend with a lot of question marks. Chuckling, Chris turned towards you,\n\u201cwhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy friends are here and snapped a photo of us.\u201d You\nshowed him the photo. It was taken from behind with you guys hand in hand\nwithout many people around you. Chris was looking towards you in the photo a\nsmile on his face. \u201cI have some explaining to do.\u201d The next one was a photo of\nChris making a weird face. </p><p>\u201cI need that photo.\u201d You turned around heading towards\nyour friends and handed your phone over to him to send the photos to himself\nand type in his number. </p><p>\u201cY/N, what are you doing-,\u201d Kate started to ask once\nthey got passed a family blocking them from you and Chris. She stopped in her\ntracks as did Mara. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mara whispered. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her hand shoot up to her mouth. You nodded and\nshe shook her head. </p><p>Kate walked closer to you. \u201cIs that really-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you interrupted her. </p><p>\u201cHow did this? When did this? WHAT!\u201d</p><p>You only laughed linking you arm through hers and\nthrough Mara\u2019s and pulled them towards the entrance of the ride. \u201cAll because\nyou didn\u2019t ride Tower of Terror.\u201d You turned to see Chris right behind you. The\nfour of you entered and quickly caught up to the line, which was slightly\nlonger than it was about forty minutes ago. Mara and Kate stood in front of you\nand Chris as the line settled. </p><p>\u201cSo Chris,\u201d Mara started. \u201cWhat is your intentions\nwith our friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMara,\u201d you slightly yelled. </p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s a valid question.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the 1800s,\u201d Kate said. </p><p>\u201cChris this is my bestie Kate and my bestie Mara. I\u2019ve\nknown them since Kindergarten.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Kate said with a slight wave. </p><p>\u201cAre you not going to introduce him,\u201d Mara asked. </p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d you told her with a smirk. Chris only\nlaughed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you guys,\u201d Chris told them. </p><p>Kate leaned against Mara. \u201cSo, Chris, do you like our\ngirl here,\u201d Kate asked and you felt heat rise to your face. </p><p>\u201cYou guys suck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, we are being good wing women.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell him how I can make bread,\u201d you asked\nreferencing the time that she tried talking up a guy for you and that was what\nshe came up with. </p><p>\u201cYou can make bread,\u201d Chris asked. </p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d Kate yelled back. \u201cHow long do you think this\nline is going to be?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI would say about forty five minutes,\u201d you told her. </p><p>\u201cPlenty of time to play heads up,\u201d she hinted. </p><p>\u201cY/N and Chris against me and you,\u201d Mara asked Kate. </p><p>\u201cHell yeah!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe should do the Marvel pack,\u201d Mara added. </p><p>Kate grabbed your phone from your backpack, unlocking\nit and pulling up the game. She found the right pack and handed the phone over\nto Chris as it started to play. He did and Kate moved you so that you were\nfacing him. </p><p>You gave her a look before reading the first clue. \u201cOh\num&hellip; Sebastian Stan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWinter Soldier,\u201d Chris asked and you nodded. He\npulled down the phone and up swiftly. </p><p>\u201cRobert Downey Jr!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIron Man!\u201d He didn\u2019t even wait for you to respond\nbefore clearing it. </p><p>\u201cOh!! Um, he has cards.\u201d Chris gave you a look. \u201cI\nthink he\u2019s a part of the X-Men. Long trench coat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGambit?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d You said pointing. \u201cHe\u2019s super fast.\u201d </p><p>\u201cQuicksilver.\u201d You nodded. </p><p>\u201cGod of Thunder!\u201d</p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t help laughing at your deep voice trying\nto mimic Chris Hemsworth. It took him a few moments to calm down enough to\nanswer, \u201cThor.\u201d </p><p>\u201cControls the weather. Um.. Another x-men!\u201d </p><p>\u201cStorm?\u201d </p><p>You nodded before laughing at the next one. \u201cYou.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCaptain America.\u201d You shook your head. </p><p>\u201cNo, the other one.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe Human Torched,\u201d he asked laughing and you nodded\nyour head. \u201cWow, that seems like forever ago.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLittle baby Christopher.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was 24!\u201d </p><p>\u201cTimes up,\u201d you told him and he moved it down watching\neach one get counted as you squished against him to watch. </p><p>\u201cNot terrible,\u201d he said as he handed the phone over to\nMara. </p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d </p>",

The wait wasn\u2019t as long as it normally was and you were surprised\nthat you were close to the front and loved looking at all the new decorations\nin the queue like the Mister Potato Head that actually talked. </p><p>\u201cHow about we make this interesting,\u201d Chris said. You\nturned towards him and raised your eyebrow at him curiously. \u201cIf you win, you\ncan ask for anything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d you asked with a light chuckle. </p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd if you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d You stuck out your hand for him to\nshake not thinking about it too much. </p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d you asked and he took your hand. </p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, what would you like,\u201d you asked Chris as you spotted\nhim exiting the ride. You waited nearby sitting on the railing as you waited.\nThe two of you got split up by a large family exiting at once. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know, when I decide.\u201d He stopped next to\nyou and you pouted slightly causing Chris to laugh. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re adorable when you pout.\u201d You pouted even more\nand Chris hesitated a moment before leaning in and kissing you. Before you had\ntime to react, he pulled away and you smiled, heat raising to your face. \u00a0\u201cNo more pouting.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo more pouting? Well if that\u2019s the response for\npouting,\u201d you said slowly thinking about it teasingly. You couldn\u2019t believe you\nwere managing to tease. And Chris Evans at that! He was just about how you\nimagined him being in real life and probably was even better. </p><p>\u201cWhere to next,\u201d he asked you chuckling. Your phone\nstarted ringing and you pulled it out to see Kate calling. You answered giving\nChris an apologetic look. </p><p>\u201cY/N! You didn\u2019t answer our texts and we got worried.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cI was on a ride sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Kate said. \u201cWe\u2019re heading back to the\npark now and will be there in like 10 minutes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to meet?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe were thinking of going on Toy Story Mania since we\nhaven\u2019t been on it yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds good! I can wait for you guys there if that\u2019s\nalright.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPerfect! See you!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour friends returning,\u201d Chris asked. You nodded. </p><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t meeting up with your family yet, my\nfriends wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have plans till after 6,\u201d Chris told you\nsmiling. </p><p>\u201cI have to warn you that my one friend is going to\nfreak out when she sees you. So, I\u2019m going to apologize now. Maybe both of them\nactually.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he smiled setting you at ease.\nYou knew that it couldn\u2019t have been easy for him to be famous. You couldn\u2019t\nimagine what it\u2019s like. </p><p>\u201cDo you care if we walk around a little? I haven\u2019t\nseen Toy Story Land yet.\u201d </p><p> \u201cI haven\u2019t\neither,\u201d he said as he gave you a hand to grab onto as you jumped down even\nthough you didn\u2019t need it. He kept a strong grasp on it as you walked further\nin weaving through the crowd as best as you could almost getting lost a few\ntimes. </p><p>The two of you were walking around as aimlessly as you\ncould pointing to all the different details you could find from the movies\nuntil you phone buzzed. You pulled it out and looked to see a picture from your\nfriend with a lot of question marks. Chuckling, Chris turned towards you,\n\u201cwhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy friends are here and snapped a photo of us.\u201d You\nshowed him the photo. It was taken from behind with you guys hand in hand\nwithout many people around you. Chris was looking towards you in the photo a\nsmile on his face. \u201cI have some explaining to do.\u201d The next one was a photo of\nChris making a weird face. </p><p>\u201cI need that photo.\u201d You turned around heading towards\nyour friends and handed your phone over to him to send the photos to himself\nand type in his number. </p><p>\u201cY/N, what are you doing-,\u201d Kate started to ask once\nthey got passed a family blocking them from you and Chris. She stopped in her\ntracks as did Mara. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mara whispered. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her hand shoot up to her mouth. You nodded and\nshe shook her head. </p><p>Kate walked closer to you. \u201cIs that really-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you interrupted her. </p><p>\u201cHow did this? When did this? WHAT!\u201d</p><p>You only laughed linking you arm through hers and\nthrough Mara\u2019s and pulled them towards the entrance of the ride. \u201cAll because\nyou didn\u2019t ride Tower of Terror.\u201d You turned to see Chris right behind you. The\nfour of you entered and quickly caught up to the line, which was slightly\nlonger than it was about forty minutes ago. Mara and Kate stood in front of you\nand Chris as the line settled. </p><p>\u201cSo Chris,\u201d Mara started. \u201cWhat is your intentions\nwith our friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMara,\u201d you slightly yelled. </p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s a valid question.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the 1800s,\u201d Kate said. </p><p>\u201cChris this is my bestie Kate and my bestie Mara. I\u2019ve\nknown them since Kindergarten.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Kate said with a slight wave. </p><p>\u201cAre you not going to introduce him,\u201d Mara asked. </p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d you told her with a smirk. Chris only\nlaughed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you guys,\u201d Chris told them. </p><p>Kate leaned against Mara. \u201cSo, Chris, do you like our\ngirl here,\u201d Kate asked and you felt heat rise to your face. </p><p>\u201cYou guys suck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, we are being good wing women.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell him how I can make bread,\u201d you asked\nreferencing the time that she tried talking up a guy for you and that was what\nshe came up with. </p><p>\u201cYou can make bread,\u201d Chris asked. </p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d Kate yelled back. \u201cHow long do you think this\nline is going to be?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI would say about forty five minutes,\u201d you told her. </p><p>\u201cPlenty of time to play heads up,\u201d she hinted. </p><p>\u201cY/N and Chris against me and you,\u201d Mara asked Kate. </p><p>\u201cHell yeah!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe should do the Marvel pack,\u201d Mara added. </p><p>Kate grabbed your phone from your backpack, unlocking\nit and pulling up the game. She found the right pack and handed the phone over\nto Chris as it started to play. He did and Kate moved you so that you were\nfacing him. </p><p>You gave her a look before reading the first clue. \u201cOh\num\u2026 Sebastian Stan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWinter Soldier,\u201d Chris asked and you nodded. He\npulled down the phone and up swiftly. </p><p>\u201cRobert Downey Jr!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIron Man!\u201d He didn\u2019t even wait for you to respond\nbefore clearing it. </p><p>\u201cOh!! Um, he has cards.\u201d Chris gave you a look. \u201cI\nthink he\u2019s a part of the X-Men. Long trench coat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGambit?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d You said pointing. \u201cHe\u2019s super fast.\u201d </p><p>\u201cQuicksilver.\u201d You nodded. </p><p>\u201cGod of Thunder!\u201d</p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t help laughing at your deep voice trying\nto mimic Chris Hemsworth. It took him a few moments to calm down enough to\nanswer, \u201cThor.\u201d </p><p>\u201cControls the weather. Um.. Another x-men!\u201d </p><p>\u201cStorm?\u201d </p><p>You nodded before laughing at the next one. \u201cYou.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCaptain America.\u201d You shook your head. </p><p>\u201cNo, the other one.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe Human Torched,\u201d he asked laughing and you nodded\nyour head. \u201cWow, that seems like forever ago.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLittle baby Christopher.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was 24!\u201d </p><p>\u201cTimes up,\u201d you told him and he moved it down watching\neach one get counted as you squished against him to watch. </p><p>\u201cNot terrible,\u201d he said as he handed the phone over to\nMara. </p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d </p>",

You were slightly behind him as you slowed down\nto text your friends and not trip like you were prone to do. Once you sat down\nyou saw a text. </p><p>Mara: Is it okay if we head back to the hotel or do\nyou want us to wait for you? </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d you told Chris as you texted back that they\ncould go without you and you\u2019ll see them once they get back to the park. </p><p>Kate: Way to ditch us!</p><p>\u201cTexting your friends?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah they are heading back to the room for a little\nwhile and wanted to make sure I was okay to stay by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was sweet of them.\u201d He offered you a smile and\nyou couldn\u2019t help but smile back. A part of you wondered why he was spending\ntime with you, but you tried to ignore it and just enjoy. </p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d You paused a moment before deciding to\ncontinue. \u201cSo, what is Captain America doing at Hollywood Studios?\u201d You offered\nhim a smile and you asked quiet enough that no one could overhear. </p><p>He laughed throwing his head back and you smiled wider\nas you got to witness IN PERSON a little bit of his famous laugh. Not full\nlaugh but enough. \u201cWell right now he is spending time with this cute girl that\nhe met in line.\u201d He winked at you making your cheeks heat up. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if\nyou knew me. Not saying that you have to know me or anything but you know I\nalways have to-\u201d You were surprised that he was rambling on nervously. </p><p>\u201cI understand what you mean. Well not personally cause\nI\u2019m not famous but I understand. Plus, it took me a while to realize where I\nknew you from. Even though your disguise isn\u2019t the best.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell anything more would be too obvious.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou just look like yourself at a baseball game.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright Paul Rudd,\u201d he said laughing and you joined\nhim. Smiling you asked him about his trip and was hopeful to hear that he still\nhad a week left of his trip, although you didn\u2019t get your hopes up that you\ncould get to spend more than just a few hours with him. </p><p>He talked about his family happily and even talked\nabout the mischief him and his brother Scott got up to the other night when\nthey visited Mickey\u2019s Dark Side. </p><p>\u201cHow is Mickey\u2019s Darkside?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been.\u201d He placed a hand on his chest dramatizing\nhis shock. </p><p>You shook your head. \u201cNo one ever wanted to go with me\nor they weren\u2019t old enough to go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI might just have to take you myself.\u201d </p><p>After the show ended, you and Chris were two of the\nlast people to leave the theatre and you sang <i>Be Our Guest</i>, while you skipped up the stairs. Once at the top, you\nturned around to see Chris shaking his head but smiling at you causing you to\nspin around on one foot with arms out wide and your backpack swinging around\nwith you as you continued to sing. </p><p>You paused for a moment as the song switched to\nLumiere\u2019s dramatic solo hoping that Chris would join you. He did sing just a\nfew lines before stopping. You clapped for him cheering bravo. \u201cHow about we go\nget some ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never say no to ice cream,\u201d you told him as you\nslightly followed behind him towards the ice cream stand not sure where he\nwanted to go exactly since you remember there being a few ice cream spots in\nHollywood Studios. </p><p>You ordered the Mickey Ice Cream Sandwich, while Chris\ngot a Mickey Ice Cream Bar, treating you to the dessert even though you tried\nto pay. </p><p>The two of you sat and talked at an empty table near\nsunset boulevard. </p><p>\u201cYou ordered the wrong one,\u201d Chris said gesturing with\nhis mickey to your own. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe ice cream sandwich is better.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt is not!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIce cream sandwiches are always the best!\u201d He shook\nhis head. \u201cI grew up eating these with my family every time that we came to\nDisney World. That\u2019s five people to one.\u201d </p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that. You\u2019ve been to Disney\na lot?\u201d </p><p>You nodded and started telling him a little bit about\nyour family vacations to Disney World, although you\u2019ve been to Disneyland once\nbefore. You told him about your family themselves. Chris then talked about his\nown family trips to Disney World growing up. </p><p>\u201cOnce we got off the ride he ran with our mom to the\nbathroom needing to change his clothes. I kind of felt back but at the time it\nwas hilarious.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPoor Scott.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry he got revenge on me since. Where to\nnext?\u201d </p><p>You looked around even though you knew all the rides\nthat were around you and what rides were farther away. \u201cThere\u2019s Toy Story\nMania, Tower of Terror, and Muppets.\u201d You turned your attention back to him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you pick.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI narrowed down your options,\u201d you told him really\nnot wanting to pick. You hate having to pick things, especially when you had no\nidea what the other person likes to go on.</p><p>He leaned forward just inches away from your face and\nyou could feel your heart rate pick up. \u201cIf you give me a kiss, I\u2019ll pick.\u201d </p><p>Thinking quickly, you offered him a peak on the cheek\nand threw your hands up, \u201cyou never specified where.\u201d A proud smile appeared on\nyour face as you felt your heart rate slow down. You were not nearly brave\nenough to kiss him on the lips. </p><p>He pouted before answering. \u201cHow about Toy Story\nMania?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBe prepared to lose,\u201d you told him. </p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m very much prepared to win.\u201d </p><p>He picked up the two wrappers from the table and\nstarted to get up to throw them away, when you said, \u201cRace you.\u201d </p><p>You took off running and turned around once you got to\nthe end of the street to see him just turning around to chase after you.\nSprinting past the restaurant at the corner, you hurried around the bend of\nAnimation Courtyard and to the back of the Chinese Theatre. You looked for the\nsign only to see it gone. </p><p>\u201cShoot,\u201d you whispered before hurrying off to the new\npart of Toy Story Land hoping that it would be there. It didn\u2019t take you too\nlong to find it just behind where the line used to be. Catching your breath,\nyou stood outside waiting for Chris. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that they moved it,\u201d he said as he\napproached you just a few minutes later. \u201cI kept thinking that I missed it.\u201d </p><p>You headed into the queue with Chris following close\nbehind you. The wait wasn\u2019t as long as it normally was and you were surprised\nthat you were close to the front and loved looking at all the new decorations\nin the queue like the Mister Potato Head that actually talked. </p><p>\u201cHow about we make this interesting,\u201d Chris said. You\nturned towards him and raised your eyebrow at him curiously. \u201cIf you win, you\ncan ask for anything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d you asked with a light chuckle. </p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd if you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d You stuck out your hand for him to\nshake not thinking about it too much. </p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d you asked and he took your hand. </p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, what would you like,\u201d you asked Chris as you spotted\nhim exiting the ride. You waited nearby sitting on the railing as you waited.\nThe two of you got split up by a large family exiting at once. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know, when I decide.\u201d He stopped next to\nyou and you pouted slightly causing Chris to laugh. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re adorable when you pout.\u201d You pouted even more\nand Chris hesitated a moment before leaning in and kissing you.

I haven\u2019t\nseen Toy Story Land yet.\u201d </p><p> \u201cI haven\u2019t\neither,\u201d he said as he gave you a hand to grab onto as you jumped down even\nthough you didn\u2019t need it. He kept a strong grasp on it as you walked further\nin weaving through the crowd as best as you could almost getting lost a few\ntimes. </p><p>The two of you were walking around as aimlessly as you\ncould pointing to all the different details you could find from the movies\nuntil you phone buzzed. You pulled it out and looked to see a picture from your\nfriend with a lot of question marks. Chuckling, Chris turned towards you,\n\u201cwhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy friends are here and snapped a photo of us.\u201d You\nshowed him the photo. It was taken from behind with you guys hand in hand\nwithout many people around you. Chris was looking towards you in the photo a\nsmile on his face. \u201cI have some explaining to do.\u201d The next one was a photo of\nChris making a weird face. </p><p>\u201cI need that photo.\u201d You turned around heading towards\nyour friends and handed your phone over to him to send the photos to himself\nand type in his number. </p><p>\u201cY/N, what are you doing-,\u201d Kate started to ask once\nthey got passed a family blocking them from you and Chris. She stopped in her\ntracks as did Mara. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mara whispered. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her hand shoot up to her mouth. You nodded and\nshe shook her head. </p><p>Kate walked closer to you. \u201cIs that really-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you interrupted her. </p><p>\u201cHow did this? When did this? WHAT!\u201d</p><p>You only laughed linking you arm through hers and\nthrough Mara\u2019s and pulled them towards the entrance of the ride. \u201cAll because\nyou didn\u2019t ride Tower of Terror.\u201d You turned to see Chris right behind you. The\nfour of you entered and quickly caught up to the line, which was slightly\nlonger than it was about forty minutes ago. Mara and Kate stood in front of you\nand Chris as the line settled. </p><p>\u201cSo Chris,\u201d Mara started. \u201cWhat is your intentions\nwith our friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMara,\u201d you slightly yelled. </p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s a valid question.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the 1800s,\u201d Kate said. </p><p>\u201cChris this is my bestie Kate and my bestie Mara. I\u2019ve\nknown them since Kindergarten.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Kate said with a slight wave. </p><p>\u201cAre you not going to introduce him,\u201d Mara asked. </p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d you told her with a smirk. Chris only\nlaughed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you guys,\u201d Chris told them. </p><p>Kate leaned against Mara. \u201cSo, Chris, do you like our\ngirl here,\u201d Kate asked and you felt heat rise to your face. </p><p>\u201cYou guys suck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, we are being good wing women.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell him how I can make bread,\u201d you asked\nreferencing the time that she tried talking up a guy for you and that was what\nshe came up with. </p><p>\u201cYou can make bread,\u201d Chris asked. </p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d Kate yelled back. \u201cHow long do you think this\nline is going to be?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI would say about forty five minutes,\u201d you told her. </p><p>\u201cPlenty of time to play heads up,\u201d she hinted. </p><p>\u201cY/N and Chris against me and you,\u201d Mara asked Kate. </p><p>\u201cHell yeah!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe should do the Marvel pack,\u201d Mara added. </p><p>Kate grabbed your phone from your backpack, unlocking\nit and pulling up the game. She found the right pack and handed the phone over\nto Chris as it started to play. He did and Kate moved you so that you were\nfacing him. </p><p>You gave her a look before reading the first clue. \u201cOh\num\u2026 Sebastian Stan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWinter Soldier,\u201d Chris asked and you nodded. He\npulled down the phone and up swiftly. </p><p>\u201cRobert Downey Jr!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIron Man!\u201d He didn\u2019t even wait for you to respond\nbefore clearing it. </p><p>\u201cOh!! Um, he has cards.\u201d Chris gave you a look. \u201cI\nthink he\u2019s a part of the X-Men. Long trench coat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGambit?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d You said pointing. \u201cHe\u2019s super fast.\u201d </p><p>\u201cQuicksilver.\u201d You nodded. </p><p>\u201cGod of Thunder!\u201d</p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t help laughing at your deep voice trying\nto mimic Chris Hemsworth. It took him a few moments to calm down enough to\nanswer, \u201cThor.\u201d </p><p>\u201cControls the weather. Um.. Another x-men!\u201d </p><p>\u201cStorm?\u201d </p><p>You nodded before laughing at the next one. \u201cYou.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCaptain America.\u201d You shook your head. </p><p>\u201cNo, the other one.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe Human Torched,\u201d he asked laughing and you nodded\nyour head. \u201cWow, that seems like forever ago.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLittle baby Christopher.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was 24!\u201d </p><p>\u201cTimes up,\u201d you told him and he moved it down watching\neach one get counted as you squished against him to watch. </p><p>\u201cNot terrible,\u201d he said as he handed the phone over to\nMara. </p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d </p>",
                "content": "<p>A/N: Again, sorry for the inaccuracies, typos, or weird sentences. Hope you\nenjoy!</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>You followed behind Chris as you walked into the open\ntheatre and texted in your group message. </p><p>You: Going to watch Beauty and The Beast since you saw\nit without me. </p><p>Chris walked ahead of you and sat down on one of the\nempty bleachers to the right. You were slightly behind him as you slowed down\nto text your friends and not trip like you were prone to do. Once you sat down\nyou saw a text. </p><p>Mara: Is it okay if we head back to the hotel or do\nyou want us to wait for you? </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; you told Chris as you texted back that they\ncould go without you and you&rsquo;ll see them once they get back to the park. </p><p>Kate: Way to ditch us!</p><p>&ldquo;Texting your friends?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah they are heading back to the room for a little\nwhile and wanted to make sure I was okay to stay by myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was sweet of them.&rdquo; He offered you a smile and\nyou couldn&rsquo;t help but smile back. A part of you wondered why he was spending\ntime with you, but you tried to ignore it and just enjoy. </p><p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo; You paused a moment before deciding to\ncontinue. &ldquo;So, what is Captain America doing at Hollywood Studios?&rdquo; You offered\nhim a smile and you asked quiet enough that no one could overhear. </p><p>He laughed throwing his head back and you smiled wider\nas you got to witness IN PERSON a little bit of his famous laugh. Not full\nlaugh but enough. &ldquo;Well right now he is spending time with this cute girl that\nhe met in line.&rdquo; He winked at you making your cheeks heat up. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure if\nyou knew me. Not saying that you have to know me or anything but you know I\nalways have to-&rdquo; You were surprised that he was rambling on nervously. </p><p>&ldquo;I understand what you mean. Well not personally cause\nI&rsquo;m not famous but I understand. Plus, it took me a while to realize where I\nknew you from. Even though your disguise isn&rsquo;t the best.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well anything more would be too obvious.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You just look like yourself at a baseball game.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Alright Paul Rudd,&rdquo; he said laughing and you joined\nhim. Smiling you asked him about his trip and was hopeful to hear that he still\nhad a week left of his trip, although you didn&rsquo;t get your hopes up that you\ncould get to spend more than just a few hours with him. </p><p>He talked about his family happily and even talked\nabout the mischief him and his brother Scott got up to the other night when\nthey visited Mickey&rsquo;s Dark Side. </p><p>&ldquo;How is Mickey&rsquo;s Darkside?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been.&rdquo; He placed a hand on his chest dramatizing\nhis shock. </p><p>You shook your head. &ldquo;No one ever wanted to go with me\nor they weren&rsquo;t old enough to go.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I might just have to take you myself.&rdquo; </p><p>After the show ended, you and Chris were two of the\nlast people to leave the theatre and you sang <i>Be Our Guest</i>, while you skipped up the stairs. Once at the top, you\nturned around to see Chris shaking his head but smiling at you causing you to\nspin around on one foot with arms out wide and your backpack swinging around\nwith you as you continued to sing. </p><p>You paused for a moment as the song switched to\nLumiere&rsquo;s dramatic solo hoping that Chris would join you. He did sing just a\nfew lines before stopping. You clapped for him cheering bravo. &ldquo;How about we go\nget some ice cream?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never say no to ice cream,&rdquo; you told him as you\nslightly followed behind him towards the ice cream stand not sure where he\nwanted to go exactly since you remember there being a few ice cream spots in\nHollywood Studios. </p><p>You ordered the Mickey Ice Cream Sandwich, while Chris\ngot a Mickey Ice Cream Bar, treating you to the dessert even though you tried\nto pay. </p><p>The two of you sat and talked at an empty table near\nsunset boulevard. </p><p>&ldquo;You ordered the wrong one,&rdquo; Chris said gesturing with\nhis mickey to your own. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The ice cream sandwich is better.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It is not!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ice cream sandwiches are always the best!&rdquo; He shook\nhis head. &ldquo;I grew up eating these with my family every time that we came to\nDisney World. That&rsquo;s five people to one.&rdquo; </p><p>He laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you that. You&rsquo;ve been to Disney\na lot?&rdquo; </p><p>You nodded and started telling him a little bit about\nyour family vacations to Disney World, although you&rsquo;ve been to Disneyland once\nbefore. You told him about your family themselves. Chris then talked about his\nown family trips to Disney World growing up. </p><p>&ldquo;Once we got off the ride he ran with our mom to the\nbathroom needing to change his clothes. I kind of felt back but at the time it\nwas hilarious.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Poor Scott.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry he got revenge on me since. Where to\nnext?&rdquo; </p><p>You looked around even though you knew all the rides\nthat were around you and what rides were farther away. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Toy Story\nMania, Tower of Terror, and Muppets.&rdquo; You turned your attention back to him. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you pick.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I narrowed down your options,&rdquo; you told him really\nnot wanting to pick. You hate having to pick things, especially when you had no\nidea what the other person likes to go on.</p><p>He leaned forward just inches away from your face and\nyou could feel your heart rate pick up. &ldquo;If you give me a kiss, I&rsquo;ll pick.&rdquo; </p><p>Thinking quickly, you offered him a peak on the cheek\nand threw your hands up, &ldquo;you never specified where.&rdquo; A proud smile appeared on\nyour face as you felt your heart rate slow down. You were not nearly brave\nenough to kiss him on the lips. </p><p>He pouted before answering. &ldquo;How about Toy Story\nMania?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Be prepared to lose,&rdquo; you told him. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m very much prepared to win.&rdquo; </p><p>He picked up the two wrappers from the table and\nstarted to get up to throw them away, when you said, &ldquo;Race you.&rdquo; </p><p>You took off running and turned around once you got to\nthe end of the street to see him just turning around to chase after you.\nSprinting past the restaurant at the corner, you hurried around the bend of\nAnimation Courtyard and to the back of the Chinese Theatre. You looked for the\nsign only to see it gone. </p><p>&ldquo;Shoot,&rdquo; you whispered before hurrying off to the new\npart of Toy Story Land hoping that it would be there. It didn&rsquo;t take you too\nlong to find it just behind where the line used to be. Catching your breath,\nyou stood outside waiting for Chris. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize that they moved it,&rdquo; he said as he\napproached you just a few minutes later. &ldquo;I kept thinking that I missed it.&rdquo; </p><p>You headed into the queue with Chris following close\nbehind you. The wait wasn&rsquo;t as long as it normally was and you were surprised\nthat you were close to the front and loved looking at all the new decorations\nin the queue like the Mister Potato Head that actually talked. </p><p>&ldquo;How about we make this interesting,&rdquo; Chris said. You\nturned towards him and raised your eyebrow at him curiously. &ldquo;If you win, you\ncan ask for anything.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; you asked with a light chuckle. </p><p>&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And if you win?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure yet.&rdquo; You stuck out your hand for him to\nshake not thinking about it too much. </p><p>&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; you asked and he took your hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, what would you like,&rdquo; you asked Chris as you spotted\nhim exiting the ride. You waited nearby sitting on the railing as you waited.\nThe two of you got split up by a large family exiting at once. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know, when I decide.&rdquo; He stopped next to\nyou and you pouted slightly causing Chris to laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re adorable when you pout.&rdquo; You pouted even more\nand Chris hesitated a moment before leaning in and kissing you. Before you had\ntime to react, he pulled away and you smiled, heat raising to your face. &nbsp;&ldquo;No more pouting.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No more pouting? Well if that&rsquo;s the response for\npouting,&rdquo; you said slowly thinking about it teasingly. You couldn&rsquo;t believe you\nwere managing to tease. And Chris Evans at that! He was just about how you\nimagined him being in real life and probably was even better. </p><p>&ldquo;Where to next,&rdquo; he asked you chuckling. Your phone\nstarted ringing and you pulled it out to see Kate calling. You answered giving\nChris an apologetic look. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! You didn&rsquo;t answer our texts and we got worried.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;I was on a ride sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Kate said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re heading back to the\npark now and will be there in like 10 minutes?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Where do you want to meet?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We were thinking of going on Toy Story Mania since we\nhaven&rsquo;t been on it yet.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sounds good! I can wait for you guys there if that&rsquo;s\nalright.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Perfect! See you!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your friends returning,&rdquo; Chris asked. You nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t meeting up with your family yet, my\nfriends wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have plans till after 6,&rdquo; Chris told you\nsmiling. </p><p>&ldquo;I have to warn you that my one friend is going to\nfreak out when she sees you. So, I&rsquo;m going to apologize now. Maybe both of them\nactually.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; he smiled setting you at ease.\nYou knew that it couldn&rsquo;t have been easy for him to be famous. You couldn&rsquo;t\nimagine what it&rsquo;s like. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you care if we walk around a little? I haven&rsquo;t\nseen Toy Story Land yet.&rdquo; </p><p> &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t\neither,&rdquo; he said as he gave you a hand to grab onto as you jumped down even\nthough you didn&rsquo;t need it.
