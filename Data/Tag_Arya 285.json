This quote\nfrom the books always stayed with me. At the time I didn\u2019t know how this could\nbe possible, but I don\u2019t believe George writes quotes like those just to filled\nup pages.

I\nbelieve that Jon Snow will be the King by the end of this story and will marry\nhis cousin Sansa Stark. And I think this marriage will unite the Kingdom, bringing peace to a nation destroyed by years of wars.But I dont believe the North will ever bend the knee to the south again. The North independence has been a topic since book 1 and it is still a important issue in the story. I believe the North will be reunited with the rest of the Westeros by a marrigae alliance, like Dorne was in the past. And the kingdom will be able to keep part of their independence and the Tittles of King and Queen in the Norh, like Dorne was able to keep in the past the titles of Princes and Princesses.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>\u201c\ufeffIts the dragons that we married\nand the dragons are all dead.\u201d</p><p>\n\nCatelyn XI - AGOT</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>_______________________________________________________________</p><blockquote><p>You might have knelt, damn you.

If we go back to book 1, George\nleft us a foreshadowed hinting that both girls would have a very special ending\nin this story.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know\nwhat to do. He always did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell,\neverything. <b>He was born to be a King&rsquo;s Hand and a father to queens.</b> I never\nasked for this cup to pass to me.&rdquo;</p><p>AGOT - Catelyn</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>That was my first hint. This quote\nfrom the books always stayed with me. At the time I didn&rsquo;t know how this could\nbe possible, but I don&rsquo;t believe George writes quotes like those just to filled\nup pages. I saw it as a foreshadowed for an ending.</p><p><br /></p><h2><b>&nbsp;SANSA FORESHADOW TO BE A QUEEN.</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/84aefd4a96b9b508631796939ef0d7bd/tumblr_inline_pf4e8h0OSQ1sgp768_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Season 1 Episode 4 - Septa Mordane and Sansa in the Throne Room discussing Sansa&rsquo;s future as queen and the future of her children.This scene was written especially for the show, it is not in the books, and it seems to foreshadow Sansa&rsquo;s future.&nbsp;&ldquo;Someday your husband will sit here\nand you will sit by his side.&rdquo;</p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; Ned said, kissing\nher lightly on the brow, &ldquo;will marry a king and rule his castle, and your\nsons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High\nSepton.&rdquo;</b><br /></p><p><b>Arya screwed up her face.\n&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Sansa.&rdquo;</b> She folded up her right leg\nand resumed her balancing.

There have been a lot of speculation on how and if the direwolves play a role. And my kind of recent theory doesn&rsquo;t involve who lives or dies, but who remains a Stark at the very end. Talking about the show, not books. Sansa and Bran no longer have their wolves while Jon does and Arya&rsquo;s is still alive. So what if it&rsquo;s foreshadowing? Bran is 3 eye raven now and you could debate not really a Stark anymore. Could that mean Sansa marries someone in the final season? Someone who isn&rsquo;t a Stark? Maybe Arya goes off to explore and live the life she wants to live, but remains close to her pack? That would leave Jon. Maybe he remains a Stark in the North, possibly not in name but that would be great too. He&rsquo;s always been a Stark to me and I feel like that is still part of how he identifies. </p><p>I could be reaching, but it&rsquo;s just something that came into my head a couple of nights ago </p>",
