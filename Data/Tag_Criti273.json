This man is established as definitely being on the evil scale of things.</p><p>* Stalker dude was also a slaver. I don\u2019t care if Marids are not human beings, they are not\u00a0\u201cevil\u201d as some claimed, they\u2019re generally chaotic neutral, and they\u2019re intelligent, sentient creatures. There\u2019s no justifying slavery, I don\u2019t care if Nicodranus could collapse because of them setting the Marid free, that\u2019s not on the mighty nein, that\u2019s on the slavers for creating that situation in the first place and ensuring that the city was reliant on their machinations (which criminal enterprises generally do in order to establish and wield leverage). Stalker dude had bosses, but he was a willful participant in that corrupt, evil system.</p><p>* Stalker dude also decided that the proper response to people sneaking around the tunnels is to outright murder them via his control over the slave, getting the marid to do his dirty work, rather than ordering to apprehend and question. A lot of folks were saying they could have de-escalated things, or tried talking to the guy, but he was very clearly past that from the get go. He, like a lot of abusers and power-hungry cretins, didn\u2019t care a lick about their lives. It\u2019s not evil to defend themselves as swiftly and effectively as possible in the scenario, that\u2019s a neutral morality slant.</p><p>* When Fjord and Beau had him cornered, the rest of the group was in trouble. Beau was definitely aware of this, Fjord was likely at least somewhat aware of the threat posed to the rest of the party.\u00a0</p><p>* Magical items are not necessarily easy to remove from a person.

Picture the most elaborate fantasy video game imaginable, where the story shifts and adapts in real-time with every one of their actions, and the players all get super into character, including putting on voices. It&rsquo;s a good time.</p><p>D&amp;D campaigns last a very, very long time, and they just rounded off their first campaign at the end of 2017, so now they&rsquo;re into a new campaign with all-new characters, set on a different continent of the same world as the last one.</p><p>If you enjoy the&nbsp;&ldquo;misfits banding together to become family&rdquo; trope, this is the show for you. This campaign focuses on seven people (and one magic cat) stumbling together into a variety of difficult, terrifying, and often hilarious situations in the middle of an oppressive and ominous empire teetering on the brink of war.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve watched an animated series or played a video game released in the past decade, you&rsquo;ve probably come across the voices of most (if not all) of the folks featured in the show: Matt Mercer (the DM running the show), Travis Willingham (plays Fjord, a half-orc warlock), Marisha Ray (plays Beau, a human monk), Liam O&rsquo;Brien (plays Caleb, a human wizard), Sam Riegel (plays Nott, a goblin rogue), Laura Bailey (plays Jester, a tiefling cleric), Taliesin Jaffe (plays Molly, a tiefling blood hunter), and Ashley Johnson (plays Yasha, an aasimar barbarian). They&rsquo;ve been playing D&amp;D together for about five years now, and the group&rsquo;s obvious close friendship and hilarious out-of-character interactions are another huge draw, even beyond the show&rsquo;s great story and characters.</p><p>\n\nCampaign 2 of Critical Role is already up to 36 episodes! In gameplay alone, that&rsquo;s over 124 hours of content. To put it into perspective, that&rsquo;s almost as long as the seven-season entirety of Star Trek: The Next Generation. If you&rsquo;re interested in jumping in, it can be intimidating to tackle that much show, especially knowing there&rsquo;s another 4 hours of content every single week.\n\n<br /></p><p>If you want to catch up super quickly, Dani Carr (segment producer at CR) has been running a show called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7atuZxmT957HmF7l0AFBLyC4w8TTvVTd\">Critical Recap</a> that runs five-minute summaries of each episode (with the first ten episodes summarized in one twenty-minute episode). It&rsquo;s also a great way to catch up quickly if you miss an episode here or there.</p><p>Want something written? D&amp;D Beyond has <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/tag/critical-role\">summaries of the new campaign&rsquo;s episodes</a>! They&rsquo;re written by James Haeck, who has co-authored a book with Matt about the campaign, and they feature two options for summaries: a two-paragraph one as well as a longer and more complete one (the first eight episodes are summarized in one article).</p><p>Another option is to just&hellip; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7atuZxmT955Cw-fFS-_3IQvaCpQgDzWA\">go to the episodes</a> and jump around. In the comments section of each episode, a valiant individual will usually have timestamped various highlights, and it&rsquo;s easy enough to just click through and watch the clips.</p><p>All caught up? Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a 115-episode first campaign just waiting for you to watch!&nbsp;</p><p>CR also has a lot of additional content, including a large number of one-shot games (often run by other members of the cast),\n\n Talks Machina (an aftershow that features hilarious and informal discussions with the cast, crew, and community), \n\n Handbooker Helper (a show aimed at supplementing the Player&rsquo;s Handbook with bite-sized guides), Between the Sheets (an in-depth one-on-one interview show currently featuring each member of the cast), and All Work No Play (the continuation of the podcast that started the game in the first place). There&rsquo;s a <i>lot</i>&nbsp;of content.</p><p>Have fun!</p>",
