What\u2019s up? You usually don\u2019t call me this late,\u201d I reply with a smile on my face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Hyung. He\u2019s still at the studio working. And he won\u2019t pick up our calls. Could you call him? He may answer if he sees that it\u2019s you.\u201d He says sounding pretty worried.</p><p>\u201cWell, I would hope so. I am his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like you\u2019re more important than his brothers.\u201d He says with an annoyed tone.</p><p>\u201cAlright, I&rsquo;ll call him.\u201d</p><p> \u201cYou didn\u2019t even deny it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Kookie! I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow!\u201d</p><p> \u201cWait Noon-\u201c I hang up the phone with a giggle and look to the clock on my wall.</p><p>\u201cEleven? Jeez, does he ever stop working?\u201d I ask myself. \u201cAish..\u201d I groan as I roll off my bed to put on one of Yoongi\u2019s sweater and my shoes.</p><p>When I arrive at BigHit, the receptionist smiles at me and nods for me to go on up. I\u2019ve come here so many times that nearly all the staff knows who I am. \u201cMiss (Y/n)? Would you mind locking up after you and Yoongi leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. I\u2019ll just leave the spare keys in your desk. Have a good night!\u201d I tell her as I head towards the stairwell. She thanks me before hurrying out into the cold weather. I check my phone for any new texts before running up the stairs to Yoongi\u2019s studio. I look through his window and see him staring at his computer with tired eyes and big headphones covering his ears. The door was cracked open a bit, so I find it okay to let myself in and stand in the doorway as pull my phone out again and dial his number. His phone, which is laying next to his mouse on his desk, starts to vibrate. Luckily, it seems to be enough to get him to notice. He throws the headphones off his head and angrily puts the phone to his ear.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYah, Jungkook! I\u2019m ignoring your calls for a reason! You\u2019re so annoying! Quit it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, Oppa. At least look at the ID before answering the call. Aish.\u201d Yoongi\u2019s eyes widen and he pulls the phone away from his ear to look at the screen. &lsquo;Princess\ud83d\udda4&rsquo; it says. I grin and clear my throat. His head turns so fast, I\u2019m surprised he doesn\u2019t get dizzy. His mouth is open slightly in surprise.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWha- when um- when did you get here, Princess?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t you try and act all cute now. You do realize that its almost midnight, yes?\u201d He glances at his computer clock and sighs. \u201cBabe, you can\u2019t overwork yourself like this. It isn\u2019t healthy.\u201d I walk over to him and run my hands through his newly dyed black hair. He sighs again and rests his head on my stomach and drapes his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cEven when you\u2019re standing your tummy is a good pillow.\u201d He mumbles.</p><p>\u201cYah, Min Yoongi are you calling me fat?\u201d I ask smacking his head very gently.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just saying you\u2019re very comfortable.\u201d He says before yawning. I sigh with a smile on my face and start playing with his hair again. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so important that you need to continue to work so late at night and ignore the boys\u2019 calls?&rdquo; I ask. Yoongi groans in annoyance when my fingers stop massaging his scalp. A soft giggle escapes my mouth at his childlike actions, so I give him what he wants.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re working on our next album. I want to make sure its perfect.&rdquo; he says lifting his head up to meet my eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, let\u2019s worry about getting you in bed first and you can work on making it perfect tomorrow. You need to sleep.&rdquo; I bend down to plant a small kiss on his forehead and then one on the tip of his nose. He leans closer, expecting one on the lips, but I stand up. &ldquo;Come on, babe. Shut it down and let\u2019s go. You can stay at my place tonight if you want to.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi looks up at me with a pout before popping his back and stretching out a bit. He stands up, making him now taller than me. &ldquo;I can leave it running. It&rsquo;ll go to sleep and I can just work on it when I get back.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Then are you ready to get out of here?&rdquo; He smiles at me and ruffles his hair before nodding. He flicks off his light switch and leads me to the elevator. &ldquo;What, too lazy for the stairs?&rdquo; I ask with a giggle as we walk in.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only part of it,&rdquo; he says hitting the button to the main floor. I look at him in confusion when he turns to face me. His eyes dart from my eyes down to my lips as he steps closer to me. He cups my face with his hand with a smile before leaning in and sealing my lips in a tender kiss. I grip onto his hoodie and lean into his hand as I respond to his affection. The elevator dings at every floor we pass as we continue to kiss.\u00a0</p><p>His kisses were slow, but they were also deep and passionate. Yoongi wasn&rsquo;t someone that would shower you with words of affection, but instead he would show you how much he cares with his actions. He lifts his other hand to cup my face and pull me closer to him. He pulls away first so we\u2019re able to catch our breath. He meets my eyes and breathes out a quiet &ldquo;God, I love you so much,&rdquo; before his lips were on mine again. My hands traveled to the back of his neck to intertwine with strands of Yoongi&rsquo;s hair. I could tell my lips were swollen, but I couldn\u2019t care less when I felt him smile into the kiss. </p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi..&rdquo; I muttered against his mouth, but he ignored me and continued to kiss me. &ldquo;Babe, quit..&rdquo; he grabbed my cheeks again in attempt to keep me quiet. I turn my head away from him and giggle as he begins to plant small kisses on my cheeks and nose. &ldquo;Yoongi-Oppa! Stop it! The door opened!&rdquo; I laugh and push at him playfully. </p><p>&ldquo;You little demon. Let me kiss you,&rdquo; he says trying to kiss my lips again. I simply push him away and run out of the elevator laughing. &ldquo;Yah! Come back here!&rdquo; Yoongi starts chasing after me around the lobby. Luckily no one was left here to see us acting like children. Suddenly, I fell two strong arms wrap around my stomach and pull me against a firm chest. &ldquo;Got you, Princess,&rdquo; he says cockily.</p><p>&ldquo;Who knew that my motionless Min was so fast?&rdquo; I ask with a giggle. I turn around in his arms and plant a kiss on the tip of his nose. &ldquo;And here I thought you were sleepy.&rdquo;</p><p>As if on cue, a large yawn erupts from his mouth, causing me to yawn as well. &ldquo;Looks like I&rsquo;m not the only sleepy one. Come on, Princess. Let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I have to lock up. Give me just a minute,&rdquo; I say before running over to the front door, locking it, then stashing the spare key in the receptionist&rsquo;s drawer. &ldquo;Okay done.\u201d I say as I grab his hand so we can walk to the car.</p><p>&quot;Can you drive us home?&rdquo; I ask him with pleading eyes.</p><p>He shakes his head with a small laugh. &ldquo;Okay, fine.&rdquo; he says taking the keys from my hand. I get into the passenger seat as he closes the door behind me and walks around to get in the driver\u2019s side. &ldquo;How come I didn&rsquo;t notice that you were wearing my sweater earlier?&rdquo; He say as he put the keys in the ignition. I shrug tiredly. &ldquo;I like it on you.&rdquo; I smile at him and relax into the seat. As I slowly begin to fall asleep, I feel Yoongi rubbing my lower thigh softly. &ldquo;Rest well, Princess. We&rsquo;ll be home soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Yoongi..so much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, baby. I love you too. And I always will.&rdquo;</p>",

What\u2019s up? You usually don\u2019t call me this late,\u201d I reply with a smile on my face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Hyung. He\u2019s still at the studio working. And he won\u2019t pick up our calls. Could you call him? He may answer if he sees that it\u2019s you.\u201d He says sounding pretty worried.</p><p>\u201cWell, I would hope so. I am his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like you\u2019re more important than his brothers.\u201d He says with an annoyed tone.</p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll call him.\u201d</p><p> \u201cYou didn\u2019t even deny it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Kookie! I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow!\u201d</p><p> \u201cWait Noon-\u201c I hang up the phone with a giggle and look to the clock on my wall.</p><p>\u201cEleven? Jeez, does he ever stop working?\u201d I ask myself. \u201cAish..\u201d I groan as I roll off my bed to put on one of Yoongi\u2019s sweater and my shoes.</p><p>When I arrive at BigHit, the receptionist smiles at me and nods for me to go on up. I\u2019ve come here so many times that nearly all the staff knows who I am. \u201cMiss (Y/n)? Would you mind locking up after you and Yoongi leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. I\u2019ll just leave the spare keys in your desk. Have a good night!\u201d I tell her as I head towards the stairwell. She thanks me before hurrying out into the cold weather. I check my phone for any new texts before running up the stairs to Yoongi\u2019s studio. I look through his window and see him staring at his computer with tired eyes and big headphones covering his ears. The door was cracked open a bit, so I find it okay to let myself in and stand in the doorway as pull my phone out again and dial his number. His phone, which is laying next to his mouse on his desk, starts to vibrate. Luckily, it seems to be enough to get him to notice. He throws the headphones off his head and angrily puts the phone to his ear.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYah, Jungkook! I\u2019m ignoring your calls for a reason! You\u2019re so annoying! Quit it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, Oppa. At least look at the ID before answering the call. Aish.\u201d Yoongi\u2019s eyes widen and he pulls the phone away from his ear to look at the screen. \u2018Princess\ud83d\udda4\u2019 it says. I grin and clear my throat. His head turns so fast, I\u2019m surprised he doesn\u2019t get dizzy. His mouth is open slightly in surprise.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWha- when um- when did you get here, Princess?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t you try and act all cute now. You do realize that its almost midnight, yes?\u201d He glances at his computer clock and sighs. \u201cBabe, you can\u2019t overwork yourself like this. It isn\u2019t healthy.\u201d I walk over to him and run my hands through his newly dyed black hair. He sighs again and rests his head on my stomach and drapes his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cEven when you\u2019re standing your tummy is a good pillow.\u201d He mumbles.</p><p>\u201cYah, Min Yoongi are you calling me fat?\u201d I ask smacking his head very gently.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just saying you\u2019re very comfortable.\u201d He says before yawning. I sigh with a smile on my face and start playing with his hair again. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so important that you need to continue to work so late at night and ignore the boys\u2019 calls?\u201d I ask. Yoongi groans in annoyance when my fingers stop massaging his scalp. A soft giggle escapes my mouth at his childlike actions, so I give him what he wants.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working on our next album. I want to make sure its perfect.\u201d he says lifting his head up to meet my eyes. </p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s worry about getting you in bed first and you can work on making it perfect tomorrow. You need to sleep.\u201d I bend down to plant a small kiss on his forehead and then one on the tip of his nose. He leans closer, expecting one on the lips, but I stand up. \u201cCome on, babe. Shut it down and let\u2019s go. You can stay at my place tonight if you want to.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi looks up at me with a pout before popping his back and stretching out a bit. He stands up, making him now taller than me. \u201cI can leave it running. It\u2019ll go to sleep and I can just work on it when I get back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay. Then are you ready to get out of here?\u201d He smiles at me and ruffles his hair before nodding. He flicks off his light switch and leads me to the elevator. \u201cWhat, too lazy for the stairs?\u201d I ask with a giggle as we walk in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only part of it,\u201d he says hitting the button to the main floor. I look at him in confusion when he turns to face me. His eyes dart from my eyes down to my lips as he steps closer to me. He cups my face with his hand with a smile before leaning in and sealing my lips in a tender kiss. I grip onto his hoodie and lean into his hand as I respond to his affection. The elevator dings at every floor we pass as we continue to kiss.\u00a0</p><p>His kisses were slow, but they were also deep and passionate. Yoongi wasn\u2019t someone that would shower you with words of affection, but instead he would show you how much he cares with his actions. He lifts his other hand to cup my face and pull me closer to him. He pulls away first so we\u2019re able to catch our breath. He meets my eyes and breathes out a quiet \u201cGod, I love you so much,\u201d before his lips were on mine again. My hands traveled to the back of his neck to intertwine with strands of Yoongi\u2019s hair. I could tell my lips were swollen, but I couldn\u2019t care less when I felt him smile into the kiss. </p><p>\u201cYoongi..\u201d I muttered against his mouth, but he ignored me and continued to kiss me. \u201cBabe, quit..\u201d he grabbed my cheeks again in attempt to keep me quiet. I turn my head away from him and giggle as he begins to plant small kisses on my cheeks and nose. \u201cYoongi-Oppa! Stop it! The door opened!\u201d I laugh and push at him playfully. </p><p>\u201cYou little demon. Let me kiss you,\u201d he says trying to kiss my lips again. I simply push him away and run out of the elevator laughing. \u201cYah! Come back here!\u201d Yoongi starts chasing after me around the lobby. Luckily no one was left here to see us acting like children. Suddenly, I fell two strong arms wrap around my stomach and pull me against a firm chest. \u201cGot you, Princess,\u201d he says cockily.</p><p>\u201cWho knew that my motionless Min was so fast?\u201d I ask with a giggle. I turn around in his arms and plant a kiss on the tip of his nose. \u201cAnd here I thought you were sleepy.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, a large yawn erupts from his mouth, causing me to yawn as well. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m not the only sleepy one. Come on, Princess. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have to lock up. Give me just a minute,\u201d I say before running over to the front door, locking it, then stashing the spare key in the receptionist\u2019s drawer. \u201cOkay done.\u201d I say as I grab his hand so we can walk to the car.</p><p>\"Can you drive us home?\u201d I ask him with pleading eyes.</p><p>He shakes his head with a small laugh. \u201cOkay, fine.\u201d he says taking the keys from my hand. I get into the passenger seat as he closes the door behind me and walks around to get in the driver\u2019s side. \u201cHow come I didn\u2019t notice that you were wearing my sweater earlier?\u201d He say as he put the keys in the ignition. I shrug tiredly. \u201cI like it on you.\u201d I smile at him and relax into the seat. As I slowly begin to fall asleep, I feel Yoongi rubbing my lower thigh softly. \u201cRest well, Princess. We\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Yoongi..so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby. I love you too. And I always will.\u201d</p>",

Taehyung loves photography. Yoongi likes eating good food and dogs and holding hands. Taehyung likes holding hands and dogs and eating good food. \u00a0Yoongi does not, dear God, like kids. \u00a0Taehyung, thank God, loves kids. But when his brother dies, it\u2019s Yoongi who suddenly has to look after four-year-old Jimin and three-year-old Jungkook.<br/></p><p><b>A/N: </b>Who\u2019s in love with baby Jungkook and Jimin already?\u00a0 Me is!\u00a0 I am.\u00a0 Whatever.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>The italics in this story are past conversations or thoughts.</i></p><p><b>Warnings: </b>Some bad words (bad Yoo-yoo!)</p><p><b>WC:</b>\u00a03,593</p><p><b><a href=\"https://54daysormore.tumblr.com/post/184164457872/jugs-tae-poe-sition-masterlist\">Masterlist</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://54daysormore.tumblr.com/post/183938384752/jugs-tae-poe-sition\">1. Fun-er-ule</a></b></p><p><b>2. It\u2019s Where It Goes</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s funny how easily people\nunderestimate kids, especially when it comes to their memory. \u00a0Yoongi was sure the boys would forget that\nafternoon, would ask the next day where their dad was, would forget why they\nwere staying at his and not grandma\u2019s now, would not remember the last time\nthey had spent the night at his apartment.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yoongi is wrong about a lot of\nthings.</p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He made them carry things purely out\nof necessity, knowing full well they were tiny children who shouldn\u2019t be\nburdened with such things, especially up a flight of stairs, but Yoongi wasn\u2019t\nabout to make twenty trips when they had two hands and were capable of\nwalking. \u00a0They went slowly, sure, but\nthey both had a look of determination on their faces as they trudged up ahead\nof him. \u00a0Yoongi wasn\u2019t foolish or mean\nenough to have them walk behind him; if they started to fall, he\u2019d drop\nwhatever he was holding to make sure to catch them. \u00a0He assumed Jungkook would poop out first\npurely due to his age, but he dumped his load and stood waiting for Yoongi to\ngo out again while Jimin started to look around the apartment, trying to find\nhis place.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStay here, okay, Jimin? \u00a0Jungkook and I will be right back.\u201d \u00a0The boy waved a hand at them, so Yoongi took\nJungkook\u2019s and headed back downstairs, risking a smile at how excited the boy\nseemed to be simply going up and down a flight of stairs. \u00a0Kids love work until they realize it\u2019s work,\nYoongi figured. \u00a0They hadn\u2019t quite\nbrought everything from his brother\u2019s. \nFor one, it wouldn\u2019t all fit. \nYoongi\u2019s place was barely a loft, and his nephews were spoiled. \u00a0Getting them to pare down their toys would be\ndifficult, but if they can go a week without asking for a certain toy, he\u2019ll\nknow they must not have valued it very much. \nJungkook had his bunny,\nand Jimin had his blanket,\nand maybe Yoongi can maintain his sanity if can stay content with those.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He and Jungkook couldn\u2019t have been\ngone more than five minutes unloading the car he had borrowed from his parents,\nso for Jimin to have made such a fantastic mess in such a short period of time\nwas purely unbelievable. \u00a0He had thrown\ntheir clothes everywhere, for one thing, and he was trying to pull Yoongi\u2019s\nmattress off of its low frame. \u00a0A pot in\nthe windowsill had somehow fallen off, the dirt spilled over the floor like an\noverturned paint can, the succulent in no hurry to go anywhere as long as no\none stepped on it.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJimin,\u201d Yoongi said, surprised at\nhow calm he sounded despite how upset he felt.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot right, not right,\u201d Jimin\nmuttered, tugging fruitlessly on the mattress.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Yoongi tried\nagain, putting the bags down he was carrying and sharing a confused look with\nJungkook.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot right, it\u2019s not right,\u201d Jimin\nsaid again. \u00a0Sighing, Yoongi patted\nJungkook\u2019s head and went over to Jimin, stepping over the piles of clothes and\ntoys already taking up his floor.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s not right?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis goes there,\u201d Jimin said,\npointing to the bed and then toward the wall with the TV.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy does it go there?\u201d Yoongi asked\nseriously. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s where it goes,\u201d Jimin said, as\nif that helped prove his point. \u00a0Yoongi\nsat on the floor and leaned against the mattress, thereby making it even more\nimpossible for Jimin to move it. \u00a0The boy\nhuffed and stomped his foot. \u00a0\u201cYoo-yoo!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJimin. \u00a0This is my bed, and it stays here.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, it was there! \u00a0It was there,\u201d Jimin said, pointing again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was there, like, last year,\u201d\nYoongi said slowly, furrowing his brow. \nHaving found his rabbit, Jungkook came over and pulled on the mattress\nonce, too, before shrugging and giving up.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHeavy.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is,\u201d Yoongi nodded, trying not\nto smile the boy started to climb on top of it. \nHe gave him a boost up by pushing on his bottom, watching as Jungkook\nhalf-stood, half rested on his knees to look out the window. \u00a0\u201cJimin, my bed used to be over there. \u00a0Do you remember the last time you spent the\nnight?\u201d \u00a0Jimin nodded as he rushed to the\nother side of the small room. \u00a0It was\nlined with shelves, book shelves, a TV stand, and cabinets and nooks filled\nwith supplies. \u00a0His dresser and desk\nstood against the opposite wall while his mattress was under the wall with the\nwindow by the door to the patio because, believe it or not, it was the spot\nthat actually got the least amount of sun.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe made a fort!\u201d Jimin recalled,\nwaving his hands over his head. \u00a0\u201cAnd the\nceiling was so high.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis high!\u201d Jungkook explained,\nwaving his hands over his head, too. \nYoongi was pretty positive the younger boy didn\u2019t remember this at all,\nand he doubted Jimin really did, either. \nStill, the boy seemed adamant. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI remember,\u201d Yoongi said, not\nchoosing to remind the pair how much of a mess they had gotten into and how he\nhad taken them back to his brother with a footnote that read something along\nthe lines of: <i>Never again, hyung.</i></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had gotten the boys changed and\nlaid them down after getting wet from the pond at the funeral home, only waking\nthem up when his mom had told him if he let them sleep for too long they\nwouldn\u2019t sleep that night. \u00a0Plus, it had\nbeen dinner time. \u00a0Disturbing them had\nbeen almost as hard as trying to explain that their dad was dead to them. \u00a0To disrupt their nap would be to disrupt\ntheir peace, and they were going to need all of the time they could get in\nblissful ignorance before being rudely awakened to the fact that their new home\nwas a tiny apartment owned and occupied by the uncle. \u00a0But he had shaken them lightly on the mats,\nunable to hide a smile at how they smacked their lips and wrung their hands and\nblinked their sleepy eyes up at him. \u00a0The\npromise of food had been an effective lure, during which they had proceeded to\nget dirty again, plus moving boxes and bags had gotten them sweaty, and Yoongi\nlooked around the room and sighed, unsure if cleaning or taking a bath first\nwas the right thing to do. \u00a0He had no\nidea how any of this was going to work. \nHe could already foresee his electric bill tripling, his water bill\ndoubling, and his time to work dwindling. \nHis brother had left him money, but all the money in the world couldn\u2019t buy\ntime, and certainly couldn\u2019t buy what his sons would actually need.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJimin, Jungkook,\u201d Yoongi said,\nleaning his head back on the couch and unbuttoning his shirt. \u00a0\u201cWe need to talk about a few rules,\nokay? \u00a0Can you both come sit here and\nlisten?\u201d \u00a0Jungkook wiggled backwards off\nthe bed, his little legs dangling over the side until Yoongi reached up to help\nhim, and Jimin finally sighed exaggeratedly and sat down on his knees again,\nhis hands pressed against his thighs as he waited. \u00a0\u201cFirst, you need to clean up the mess you\nmade. \u00a0I\u2019m going to show you where to put\nyour clothes and where to put your toys, okay?\u201d \nTwo bobbing heads. \u00a0\u201cThen we\u2019re\ngoing to take a bath, no discussion. \nThen we\u2019re going to go to sleep.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut we need a bed to sleep,\u201d Jimin\npointed out.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll have to sleep with me\ntonight, okay?\u201d \u00a0The idea seemed more\nthan okay to the boys who both nodded enthusiastically. \u00a0Yoongi had no idea where he would put another\nbed, much less two, even if they were child-sized, in his apartment, but he\ncould come up with a solution later. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd\nI mean it. \u00a0Sleep. \u00a0Okay,\u201d Yoongi said, peeling off his shirt and\npointing to the two bottom shelves by the TV. \n\u201cSee those red and blue bins? \nThat\u2019s where your toys need to go. \nYour shoes need to go by the door.\u201d \nThe instructions seemed clear enough, but the boys simply sat there,\ntheir eyes wide and mouths in little \u201co\u201d shapes. \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi frowned before the two boys\nwere clamoring toward him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYoo-yoo, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFlower,\u201d Jungkook said, poking Yoongi\u2019s\nforearm hard enough that he flinched a little.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve seen my tattoos before.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot this one,\u201d Jimin said, patting\nthe one on his ribcage carefully.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I guess that\u2019s true,\u201d Yoongi\nsaid, looking down at the boy. \u00a0He could\ndistinctly remember a time his brother forced him to go to the beach. \u00a0Jungkook had been just a baby, then, and\nJimin was probably too young to remember it. \nYoongi hated the water, and he hated being shirtless, but he knows he\nwas that day. \u00a0It may be hard to remember\nwhat the water and the sun felt like, but the stares were impossible to forget. \u00a0His heart leapt and fell over, but Yoongi\nwasn\u2019t going to cry. \u00a0\u201cHow about\nthis?\u201d \u00a0He cleared his throat. \u00a0\u201cOnce you pick up your toys, we can take a\nbath, and I\u2019ll show you all of them.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMore tat\u2019oos?\u201d Jungkook whispered,\nand Yoongi held back a snort, nodding and patting his head. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go, Jimin, glean, glean.\u201d \u00a0Yoongi shouldn\u2019t have been so surprised when\nJungkook took the blue bin and Jimin took the red bin. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t even told them to separate their\ntoys, but they were smarter than he gave them credit for. \u00a0Perhaps smarter than anyone had given them\ncredit for, even their dad. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shaking his head, Yoongi sat up and\nstarted to pick up the clothes Jimin had thrown around, gathering them all in a\npile he placed by his dresser. \u00a0He had\nalready tried to make as much room as possible, stuffing his small closet as\nfull as possible with his own clothes to make space in the drawers. \u00a0Kids\u2019 clothes were also tiny, thankfully, so\nit looked like everything they had brought so far would fit in the bottom\ndrawer.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYoo-yoo,\u201d Jimin said, wiggling against\nYoongi\u2019s back. \u00a0Jungkook stood by his\nshoulder, still holding his bunny, the boy\u2019s eyes already getting droopy\nagain. \u00a0\u201cWe done!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh?\u201d Yoongi said, turning around to\nsee his floor clean again. \u00a0A few bags\nstill sat by the door, but most of them held food leftover from the wake. \u00a0\u201cGood job, you two.\u201d \u00a0Jimin beamed, and Jungkook smiled slightly,\nhugging his bunny closer to his chest. \n\u201cWe need to clean up the plant and those bags now.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut you said bath!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd tat\u2019oos,\u201d Jungkook whispered.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, I forgot about the plant and\nthe food. \u00a0We have to put the food up so\nwe can eat tomorrow. \u00a0And if don\u2019t pick\nup the plant, it will die. \u00a0Do you want\nit to die?\u201d \u00a0It was the wrong\nquestion. \u00a0The wrong word. \u00a0Yoongi knew immediately and somehow managed\nto keep his curse in his own head.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t wanna die,\u201d Jungkook\nmumbled. \u00a0Jimin looked like he was about\nto melt or explode right there.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not going to. \u00a0The plant will be fine,\u201d Yoongi said, scurrying\nacross the floor to pick it up to show them. \n\u201cLook, it\u2019s fine. \u00a0Jimin, can\nyou\u2014do you see that cup by the sink? \u00a0No,\nyou can\u2019t reach that. \u00a0Here, hold this,\u201d\nhe said, holding out the plant still in a little bed of dirt to the boy. \u00a0Jimin held out both of his hands carefully\nand took the plant as if it was a precious relic. \u00a0Brushing his hands on his already dirty\npants, Yoongi patted him on the head and stepped into the kitchen to grab a\nglass. \u00a0\u201cOkay, you can put it in here.\u201d \u00a0Jimin did, transferring the plant to the cup\ncarefully as Jungkook looked on. \u00a0\u201cGood\njob. \u00a0Now, this needs to go back in the\nwindowsill. \u00a0Think you can do that?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI can do it,\u201d Jimin nodded\nseriously, taking the cup and walking slowly toward the bed. \u00a0Yoongi watched as he tried to decide what to\ndo as he bent down to pick up the biggest pieces of the broken pot.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe Jungkook can hold it while\nyou climb up, then he can pass it to you?\u201d Yoongi suggested, and Jungkook\nhurried to help. \u00a0The plan seemed to\nwork, and Yoongi swept up the rest of the dirt and sharp bits quickly, thankful\nthe boys seemed patient for the time being. \nThey stayed quiet while he put the food away, too, and at one point when\nhe turned away from the fridge Jungkook was behind him, handing him another container.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, meaning every\nword. \u00a0By the time he was done, Jimin was\nlying on his side on the mattress, his eyes open but blinking rapidly. \u00a0\u201cUh uh,\u201d Yoongi said, \u201cbath first.\u201d \u00a0He expected more pouting and whining, as kids\nwho were tired usually got that way, but the pair seemed to grow quieter. \u00a0They stood against the wall while he stopped\nup the tub and began to fill it, dipping his fingers under the faucet a few\ntimes to check the temperature. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan you undress yourselves?\u201d Yoongi\nsaid after pouring some bubble bath in the water, which, yes he had lying\naround. \u00a0Jimin nodded and began working\non his shirt and pants while Jungkook simply held his bunny and stood watching\nYoongi. \u00a0\u201cJungkook?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe needs help \u2018cause he\u2019s a baby,\u201d\nJimin explained.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c\u2019m not,\u201d Jungkook muttered, but\nYoongi squatted down next to him anyway, holding out his hand.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBunny can\u2019t get wet, so let me put\nhim on the counter. \u00a0Then you can take\nyour shirt off.\u201d \u00a0The look Jungkook gave\nYoongi almost made him laugh it was so absurd. \nEventually, with Jimin naked and bouncing on his toes beside him,\nJungkook handed his bunny over, watching carefully as Yoongi put it on the\ncounter and then raised his eyebrows. \n\u201cShirt.\u201d \u00a0Yoongi and his mom had\nhelped them get out of their suits earlier, but he had a t-shirt and pants with\nelastic on them now, so he just needed to pull and tug, and they would come\noff. \u00a0Still, Jungkook reached for the hem\nand started to pull it off, but the second it went over his head he started to\nthrash around. \u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d Yoongi said,\ntugging the shirt off immediately, \u201cthere you go.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s eyes were wide, and he tried to\nreach for his bunny, but Yoongi grabbed his hands and squeezed them\ngently. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, bath first. \u00a0You\u2019re okay. \nPants now, alright?\u201d \u00a0Shaking his\nhead, Jungkook stamped his foot.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYoo-yoo, can I get in?\u201d Jimin said,\ngrowing impatient. \u00a0Yoongi nodded,\nwatching him climb over the edge as he took off Jungkook\u2019s pants. \u00a0The little boy went a little limp against him\nas he did all of the work, taking off his pull-up, too. \u00a0Realizing the boy must be on his last leg,\nYoongi took pity on him, picking him up and placing in the bath next to Jimin.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhere are your toys?\u201d Jimin said\nonce his brother was beside him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t have any toys,\u201d Yoongi\nsaid, unzipping his slacks and slipping them off. \u00a0He was reminded why he hated them as soon as\nthey pooled at his ankles. \u00a0Legs didn\u2019t\ntechnically need to breathe, and neither did his waist, but they suddenly felt\nlike they could again. \u00a0\u201cBath time is for\ngetting clean, not playing.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBoring,\u201d Jimin pouted, smacking the\nwater and sending a spray of water in Jungkook\u2019s face. \u00a0The boy whined and rubbed at his eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBath time is for getting clean,\u201d\nYoongi repeated, \u201cnot making a mess.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBoring,\u201d Jimin said again, but\nbefore he could slap the water again Yoongi took off his boxers and tried to\nslip into the bath next to them. \u00a0\u201cAh,\nYoo-yoo!\u201d the boy practically screamed, pointing as his uncle. \u00a0Jungkook followed his finger, and his pout\ndisappeared as his eyes got a little wide.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour pee-pee is big,\u201d Jungkook\nsaid, sounding wowed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\u2014\u201d Yoongi looked down and blinked\nbefore rolling his eyes. \u00a0He picked\nJungkook up a little to make room for himself before sitting down, being\ncareful not to let the water slosh up and over the sides. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t call it that.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s so big. \u00a0Why\u2019s it so big?\u201d Jimin said, trying to climb\nthrough the water to get a better look.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStop,\u201d Yoongi said, holding a hand\nto the boy\u2019s head to stop him from doing so. \nJungkook was staring down past his own lap, poking himself\nexperimentally. \u00a0\u201cMy penis,\u201d he said,\nemphasizing the word, \u201cis bigger than yours because I\u2019m an adult. \u00a0Yours will grow with your body.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d Jimin said, sitting back\ndown.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, and you should call things\nwhat they are. \u00a0It\u2019s not a pee-pee.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin hummed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow, can you get clean while I show\nyou my tattoos?\u201d \u00a0The boys assured him\nthey could, and while it was mostly him doing the cleaning of all three of\nthem, and they interrupted him more than they let him just tell them what each\nmeant, they at least got done before the water got too cold. \u00a0Satisfied with how clean they both were,\nYoongi got out first and found a towel for each of them. \u00a0Jungkook once again seemed incapable of\ntaking care of himself, so Yoongi kept him wrapped up until he was dry himself\nbefore he gave the boy a final rub down. \nAfter brushing their teeth and using the bathroom and making sure\neveryone was dressed, they both seemed more than compliant enough to go to bed\neasily, but the moment he got them both under the covers, his back against the\nwall like he was used to, Jungkook started to cry, and Jimin started to kick\nhim to try to get him to stop, which only made it worse. \u00a0Yoongi actually let them for a moment as he\ntook a deep breath. \u00a0He felt like crying,\ntoo, but he knew he couldn\u2019t. \u00a0Instead,\nwith a sigh, he pulled Jungkook away from his brother and laid on his back so\nthe boy could lay on his chest, rubbing his hand up and down his back.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s being a baby,\u201d Jimin fussed,\nkicking Yoongi\u2019s leg now.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStop kicking,\u201d Yoongi hissed. \u00a0\u201cAnd leave Jungkook alone. \u00a0He\u2019s sad. \nLet him be sad if he wants to be sad. \nGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNeed a story,\u201d Jimin said,\nthankfully stopping his kicking.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Yoongi said, shushing\nJungkook and running his fingers through his hair as he tried to think. \u00a0\u201cOkay, there were once two boys who were\nbrothers.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook sniffed, the topic\nobviously interesting to him. \u00a0\u201cAnd one\ntime they went out into the woods behind their house. \u00a0Their mother had told them to be careful and\nnot get lost. \u00a0There was a path they\nshould have stayed on. \u00a0But one of the\nboys wanted to go off of the path.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin said, about to put in\nhis two cents about why that was a bad idea, but Yoongi patted his leg and\nshushed him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe wasn\u2019t sure why he wanted to go\noff the path. \u00a0He had only heard of bad\nthings happening to people who did. \u00a0It\nwould be smarter and safer to stay on the path. \nThe boy knew this. \u00a0Both boys did. \u00a0But the younger brother wanted to anyway, so\none day he did. \u00a0His brother stayed on\nthe path, and he told his brother, begged his brother, not to leave, but do you\nknow what the younger brother did?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin said. \u00a0Jungkook hiccupped.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe went anyway. \u00a0And his brother thought he would never see\nhim again, but he still managed to come home that night. \u00a0The next time they went into the woods, the\nboy strayed off the path again. \u00a0He told\nhis brother it wasn\u2019t that bad, and since he found his way back once, he could\nfind it again. \u00a0This went on for\nyears. \u00a0The older brother grew more and\nmore worried, and the younger brother grew less and less concerned. \u00a0Each time he left the path, he was gone for\nlonger and longer, and it was harder and harder for him to find his way\nhome. \u00a0One time, he didn\u2019t come back for\nso long, his older brother had to go off the path to look for him. \u00a0When he found his baby brother, he was so\nglad, so happy, that he cried and cried. \nHe made his brother promise to never leave the path again, and his\nbrother did. \u00a0But he didn\u2019t keep that\npromise for long. \u00a0And eventually, he\nchose to never come home. \u00a0He decided\nleaving the path was better than staying with his brother. \u00a0It was a terrible decision. \u00a0It cost him his life. \u00a0After being away from his brother for too\nlong, he died.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin mumbled, curling up\naround Yoongi\u2019s arm. \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s breath\nhad evened out, and he had mostly gone quiet and still.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, oh.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t like this story,\u201d Jimin\nsaid, and Yoongi reached down to pat his leg again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t either, Jimin. \u00a0Hopefully tomorrow I can come up with a\nbetter one.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay, Yoo-yoo,\u201d Jimin whispered. \u00a0\u201cG\u2019night.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNight Jimin. \u00a0Night Jungkook,\u201d Yoongi whispered back. \u00a0He waited until the pair was asleep, his mind\nrunning through everything he was going to have to do and coming up with five\nnegative explanations for why he wasn\u2019t going to be able to do any of them,\nbefore he squeezed his eyes shut and kept them pressed together until they\nhurt, until his tears finally slipped out. \nJust a few. \u00a0That was all he\nneeded. \u00a0One for his brother, and one for\nhimself. \u00a0One for Jungkook, and one for\nJimin.</p><hr><p><b>A/N:</b></p><p>That\u2019s\nright, of course Jungkook has a bunny.</p><p>That\u2019s\nright, of course Jimin has a blanket.\u00a0 And yes, it\u2019s yellow.</p><p>Yoongi\u2019s first revealed tattoo is flowers on his left forearm.\u00a0 He has \u201cNevermind\u201d on his ribs that Jimin points out.\u00a0 Yes, I did that.\u00a0 The other ones will be revealed soon!</p><p>Here we begin Jimin and Jungkook living with Yoongi and having Issues.\u00a0 They\u2019re little kids trying to deal with things they can\u2019t even comprehend.\u00a0 So don\u2019t expect them to just be cute and OK.</p><p>TAE NEXT CHAPTER YAY.</p>",

boys would forget that\nafternoon, would ask the next day where their dad was, would forget why they\nwere staying at his and not grandma\u2019s now, would not remember the last time\nthey had spent the night at his apartment.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yoongi is wrong about a lot of\nthings.</p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He made them carry things purely out\nof necessity, knowing full well they were tiny children who shouldn\u2019t be\nburdened with such things, especially up a flight of stairs, but Yoongi wasn\u2019t\nabout to make twenty trips when they had two hands and were capable of\nwalking. \u00a0They went slowly, sure, but\nthey both had a look of determination on their faces as they trudged up ahead\nof him. \u00a0Yoongi wasn\u2019t foolish or mean\nenough to have them walk behind him; if they started to fall, he\u2019d drop\nwhatever he was holding to make sure to catch them. \u00a0He assumed Jungkook would poop out first\npurely due to his age, but he dumped his load and stood waiting for Yoongi to\ngo out again while Jimin started to look around the apartment, trying to find\nhis place.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStay here, okay, Jimin? \u00a0Jungkook and I will be right back.\u201d \u00a0The boy waved a hand at them, so Yoongi took\nJungkook\u2019s and headed back downstairs, risking a smile at how excited the boy\nseemed to be simply going up and down a flight of stairs. \u00a0Kids love work until they realize it\u2019s work,\nYoongi figured. \u00a0They hadn\u2019t quite\nbrought everything from his brother\u2019s. \nFor one, it wouldn\u2019t all fit. \nYoongi\u2019s place was barely a loft, and his nephews were spoiled. \u00a0Getting them to pare down their toys would be\ndifficult, but if they can go a week without asking for a certain toy, he\u2019ll\nknow they must not have valued it very much. \nJungkook had his bunny,\nand Jimin had his blanket,\nand maybe Yoongi can maintain his sanity if can stay content with those.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He and Jungkook couldn\u2019t have been\ngone more than five minutes unloading the car he had borrowed from his parents,\nso for Jimin to have made such a fantastic mess in such a short period of time\nwas purely unbelievable. \u00a0He had thrown\ntheir clothes everywhere, for one thing, and he was trying to pull Yoongi\u2019s\nmattress off of its low frame. \u00a0A pot in\nthe windowsill had somehow fallen off, the dirt spilled over the floor like an\noverturned paint can, the succulent in no hurry to go anywhere as long as no\none stepped on it.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJimin,\u201d Yoongi said, surprised at\nhow calm he sounded despite how upset he felt.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot right, not right,\u201d Jimin\nmuttered, tugging fruitlessly on the mattress.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Yoongi tried\nagain, putting the bags down he was carrying and sharing a confused look with\nJungkook.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot right, it\u2019s not right,\u201d Jimin\nsaid again. \u00a0Sighing, Yoongi patted\nJungkook\u2019s head and went over to Jimin, stepping over the piles of clothes and\ntoys already taking up his floor.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s not right?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis goes there,\u201d Jimin said,\npointing to the bed and then toward the wall with the TV.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy does it go there?\u201d Yoongi asked\nseriously. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s where it goes,\u201d Jimin said, as\nif that helped prove his point. \u00a0Yoongi\nsat on the floor and leaned against the mattress, thereby making it even more\nimpossible for Jimin to move it. \u00a0The boy\nhuffed and stomped his foot. \u00a0\u201cYoo-yoo!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJimin. \u00a0This is my bed, and it stays here.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, it was there! \u00a0It was there,\u201d Jimin said, pointing again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was there, like, last year,\u201d\nYoongi said slowly, furrowing his brow. \nHaving found his rabbit, Jungkook came over and pulled on the mattress\nonce, too, before shrugging and giving up.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHeavy.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is,\u201d Yoongi nodded, trying not\nto smile the boy started to climb on top of it. \nHe gave him a boost up by pushing on his bottom, watching as Jungkook\nhalf-stood, half rested on his knees to look out the window. \u00a0\u201cJimin, my bed used to be over there. \u00a0Do you remember the last time you spent the\nnight?\u201d \u00a0Jimin nodded as he rushed to the\nother side of the small room. \u00a0It was\nlined with shelves, book shelves, a TV stand, and cabinets and nooks filled\nwith supplies. \u00a0His dresser and desk\nstood against the opposite wall while his mattress was under the wall with the\nwindow by the door to the patio because, believe it or not, it was the spot\nthat actually got the least amount of sun.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe made a fort!\u201d Jimin recalled,\nwaving his hands over his head. \u00a0\u201cAnd the\nceiling was so high.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis high!\u201d Jungkook explained,\nwaving his hands over his head, too. \nYoongi was pretty positive the younger boy didn\u2019t remember this at all,\nand he doubted Jimin really did, either. \nStill, the boy seemed adamant. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI remember,\u201d Yoongi said, not\nchoosing to remind the pair how much of a mess they had gotten into and how he\nhad taken them back to his brother with a footnote that read something along\nthe lines of: <i>Never again, hyung.</i></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had gotten the boys changed and\nlaid them down after getting wet from the pond at the funeral home, only waking\nthem up when his mom had told him if he let them sleep for too long they\nwouldn\u2019t sleep that night. \u00a0Plus, it had\nbeen dinner time. \u00a0Disturbing them had\nbeen almost as hard as trying to explain that their dad was dead to them. \u00a0To disrupt their nap would be to disrupt\ntheir peace, and they were going to need all of the time they could get in\nblissful ignorance before being rudely awakened to the fact that their new home\nwas a tiny apartment owned and occupied by the uncle. \u00a0But he had shaken them lightly on the mats,\nunable to hide a smile at how they smacked their lips and wrung their hands and\nblinked their sleepy eyes up at him. \u00a0The\npromise of food had been an effective lure, during which they had proceeded to\nget dirty again, plus moving boxes and bags had gotten them sweaty, and Yoongi\nlooked around the room and sighed, unsure if cleaning or taking a bath first\nwas the right thing to do. \u00a0He had no\nidea how any of this was going to work. \nHe could already foresee his electric bill tripling, his water bill\ndoubling, and his time to work dwindling. \nHis brother had left him money, but all the money in the world couldn\u2019t buy\ntime, and certainly couldn\u2019t buy what his sons would actually need.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJimin, Jungkook,\u201d Yoongi said,\nleaning his head back on the couch and unbuttoning his shirt. \u00a0\u201cWe need to talk about a few rules,\nokay? \u00a0Can you both come sit here and\nlisten?\u201d \u00a0Jungkook wiggled backwards off\nthe bed, his little legs dangling over the side until Yoongi reached up to help\nhim, and Jimin finally sighed exaggeratedly and sat down on his knees again,\nhis hands pressed against his thighs as he waited. \u00a0\u201cFirst, you need to clean up the mess you\nmade. \u00a0I\u2019m going to show you where to put\nyour clothes and where to put your toys, okay?\u201d \nTwo bobbing heads. \u00a0\u201cThen we\u2019re\ngoing to take a bath, no discussion. \nThen we\u2019re going to go to sleep.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut we need a bed to sleep,\u201d Jimin\npointed out.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll have to sleep with me\ntonight, okay?\u201d \u00a0The idea seemed more\nthan okay to the boys who both nodded enthusiastically. \u00a0Yoongi had no idea where he would put another\nbed, much less two, even if they were child-sized, in his apartment, but he\ncould come up with a solution later. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd\nI mean it. \u00a0Sleep. \u00a0Okay,\u201d Yoongi said, peeling off his shirt and\npointing to the two bottom shelves by the TV. \n\u201cSee those red and blue bins? \nThat\u2019s where your toys need to go. \nYour shoes need to go by the door.\u201d \nThe instructions seemed clear enough, but the boys simply sat there,\ntheir eyes wide and mouths in little \u201co\u201d shapes. \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi frowned before the two boys\nwere clamoring toward him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYoo-yoo, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFlower,\u201d Jungkook said, poking Yoongi\u2019s\nforearm hard enough that he flinched a little.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve seen my tattoos before.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot this one,\u201d Jimin said, patting\nthe one on his ribcage carefully.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I guess that\u2019s true,\u201d Yoongi\nsaid, looking down at the boy. \u00a0He could\ndistinctly remember a time his brother forced him to go to the beach. \u00a0Jungkook had been just a baby, then, and\nJimin was probably too young to remember it. \nYoongi hated the water, and he hated being shirtless, but he knows he\nwas that day. \u00a0It may be hard to remember\nwhat the water and the sun felt like, but the stares were impossible to forget. \u00a0His heart leapt and fell over, but Yoongi\nwasn\u2019t going to cry. \u00a0\u201cHow about\nthis?\u201d \u00a0He cleared his throat. \u00a0\u201cOnce you pick up your toys, we can take a\nbath, and I\u2019ll show you all of them.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMore tat\u2019oos?\u201d Jungkook whispered,\nand Yoongi held back a snort, nodding and patting his head. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go, Jimin, glean, glean.\u201d \u00a0Yoongi shouldn\u2019t have been so surprised when\nJungkook took the blue bin and Jimin took the red bin. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t even told them to separate their\ntoys, but they were smarter than he gave them credit for. \u00a0Perhaps smarter than anyone had given them\ncredit for, even their dad. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shaking his head, Yoongi sat up and\nstarted to pick up the clothes Jimin had thrown around, gathering them all in a\npile he placed by his dresser. \u00a0He had\nalready tried to make as much room as possible, stuffing his small closet as\nfull as possible with his own clothes to make space in the drawers. \u00a0Kids\u2019 clothes were also tiny, thankfully, so\nit looked like everything they had brought so far would fit in the bottom\ndrawer.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYoo-yoo,\u201d Jimin said, wiggling against\nYoongi\u2019s back. \u00a0Jungkook stood by his\nshoulder, still holding his bunny, the boy\u2019s eyes already getting droopy\nagain. \u00a0\u201cWe done!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh?\u201d Yoongi said, turning around to\nsee his floor clean again. \u00a0A few bags\nstill sat by the door, but most of them held food leftover from the wake. \u00a0\u201cGood job, you two.\u201d \u00a0Jimin beamed, and Jungkook smiled slightly,\nhugging his bunny closer to his chest. \n\u201cWe need to clean up the plant and those bags now.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut you said bath!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd tat\u2019oos,\u201d Jungkook whispered.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, I forgot about the plant and\nthe food. \u00a0We have to put the food up so\nwe can eat tomorrow. \u00a0And if don\u2019t pick\nup the plant, it will die. \u00a0Do you want\nit to die?\u201d \u00a0It was the wrong\nquestion. \u00a0The wrong word. \u00a0Yoongi knew immediately and somehow managed\nto keep his curse in his own head.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t wanna die,\u201d Jungkook\nmumbled. \u00a0Jimin looked like he was about\nto melt or explode right there.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not going to. \u00a0The plant will be fine,\u201d Yoongi said, scurrying\nacross the floor to pick it up to show them. \n\u201cLook, it\u2019s fine. \u00a0Jimin, can\nyou\u2014do you see that cup by the sink? \u00a0No,\nyou can\u2019t reach that. \u00a0Here, hold this,\u201d\nhe said, holding out the plant still in a little bed of dirt to the boy. \u00a0Jimin held out both of his hands carefully\nand took the plant as if it was a precious relic. \u00a0Brushing his hands on his already dirty\npants, Yoongi patted him on the head and stepped into the kitchen to grab a\nglass. \u00a0\u201cOkay, you can put it in here.\u201d \u00a0Jimin did, transferring the plant to the cup\ncarefully as Jungkook looked on. \u00a0\u201cGood\njob. \u00a0Now, this needs to go back in the\nwindowsill. \u00a0Think you can do that?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI can do it,\u201d Jimin nodded\nseriously, taking the cup and walking slowly toward the bed. \u00a0Yoongi watched as he tried to decide what to\ndo as he bent down to pick up the biggest pieces of the broken pot.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe Jungkook can hold it while\nyou climb up, then he can pass it to you?\u201d Yoongi suggested, and Jungkook\nhurried to help. \u00a0The plan seemed to\nwork, and Yoongi swept up the rest of the dirt and sharp bits quickly, thankful\nthe boys seemed patient for the time being. \nThey stayed quiet while he put the food away, too, and at one point when\nhe turned away from the fridge Jungkook was behind him, handing him another container.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, meaning every\nword. \u00a0By the time he was done, Jimin was\nlying on his side on the mattress, his eyes open but blinking rapidly. \u00a0\u201cUh uh,\u201d Yoongi said, \u201cbath first.\u201d \u00a0He expected more pouting and whining, as kids\nwho were tired usually got that way, but the pair seemed to grow quieter. \u00a0They stood against the wall while he stopped\nup the tub and began to fill it, dipping his fingers under the faucet a few\ntimes to check the temperature. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan you undress yourselves?\u201d Yoongi\nsaid after pouring some bubble bath in the water, which, yes he had lying\naround. \u00a0Jimin nodded and began working\non his shirt and pants while Jungkook simply held his bunny and stood watching\nYoongi. \u00a0\u201cJungkook?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe needs help \u2018cause he\u2019s a baby,\u201d\nJimin explained.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c\u2019m not,\u201d Jungkook muttered, but\nYoongi squatted down next to him anyway, holding out his hand.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBunny can\u2019t get wet, so let me put\nhim on the counter. \u00a0Then you can take\nyour shirt off.\u201d \u00a0The look Jungkook gave\nYoongi almost made him laugh it was so absurd. \nEventually, with Jimin naked and bouncing on his toes beside him,\nJungkook handed his bunny over, watching carefully as Yoongi put it on the\ncounter and then raised his eyebrows. \n\u201cShirt.\u201d \u00a0Yoongi and his mom had\nhelped them get out of their suits earlier, but he had a t-shirt and pants with\nelastic on them now, so he just needed to pull and tug, and they would come\noff. \u00a0Still, Jungkook reached for the hem\nand started to pull it off, but the second it went over his head he started to\nthrash around. \u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d Yoongi said,\ntugging the shirt off immediately, \u201cthere you go.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s eyes were wide, and he tried to\nreach for his bunny, but Yoongi grabbed his hands and squeezed them\ngently. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, bath first. \u00a0You\u2019re okay. \nPants now, alright?\u201d \u00a0Shaking his\nhead, Jungkook stamped his foot.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYoo-yoo, can I get in?\u201d Jimin said,\ngrowing impatient. \u00a0Yoongi nodded,\nwatching him climb over the edge as he took off Jungkook\u2019s pants. \u00a0The little boy went a little limp against him\nas he did all of the work, taking off his pull-up, too. \u00a0Realizing the boy must be on his last leg,\nYoongi took pity on him, picking him up and placing in the bath next to Jimin.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhere are your toys?\u201d Jimin said\nonce his brother was beside him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t have any toys,\u201d Yoongi\nsaid, unzipping his slacks and slipping them off. \u00a0He was reminded why he hated them as soon as\nthey pooled at his ankles. \u00a0Legs didn\u2019t\ntechnically need to breathe, and neither did his waist, but they suddenly felt\nlike they could again. \u00a0\u201cBath time is for\ngetting clean, not playing.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBoring,\u201d Jimin pouted, smacking the\nwater and sending a spray of water in Jungkook\u2019s face. \u00a0The boy whined and rubbed at his eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBath time is for getting clean,\u201d\nYoongi repeated, \u201cnot making a mess.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBoring,\u201d Jimin said again, but\nbefore he could slap the water again Yoongi took off his boxers and tried to\nslip into the bath next to them. \u00a0\u201cAh,\nYoo-yoo!\u201d the boy practically screamed, pointing as his uncle. \u00a0Jungkook followed his finger, and his pout\ndisappeared as his eyes got a little wide.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour pee-pee is big,\u201d Jungkook\nsaid, sounding wowed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\u2014\u201d Yoongi looked down and blinked\nbefore rolling his eyes. \u00a0He picked\nJungkook up a little to make room for himself before sitting down, being\ncareful not to let the water slosh up and over the sides. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t call it that.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s so big. \u00a0Why\u2019s it so big?\u201d Jimin said, trying to climb\nthrough the water to get a better look.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStop,\u201d Yoongi said, holding a hand\nto the boy\u2019s head to stop him from doing so. \nJungkook was staring down past his own lap, poking himself\nexperimentally. \u00a0\u201cMy penis,\u201d he said,\nemphasizing the word, \u201cis bigger than yours because I\u2019m an adult. \u00a0Yours will grow with your body.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d Jimin said, sitting back\ndown.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, and you should call things\nwhat they are. \u00a0It\u2019s not a pee-pee.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin hummed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow, can you get clean while I show\nyou my tattoos?\u201d \u00a0The boys assured him\nthey could, and while it was mostly him doing the cleaning of all three of\nthem, and they interrupted him more than they let him just tell them what each\nmeant, they at least got done before the water got too cold. \u00a0Satisfied with how clean they both were,\nYoongi got out first and found a towel for each of them. \u00a0Jungkook once again seemed incapable of\ntaking care of himself, so Yoongi kept him wrapped up until he was dry himself\nbefore he gave the boy a final rub down. \nAfter brushing their teeth and using the bathroom and making sure\neveryone was dressed, they both seemed more than compliant enough to go to bed\neasily, but the moment he got them both under the covers, his back against the\nwall like he was used to, Jungkook started to cry, and Jimin started to kick\nhim to try to get him to stop, which only made it worse. \u00a0Yoongi actually let them for a moment as he\ntook a deep breath. \u00a0He felt like crying,\ntoo, but he knew he couldn\u2019t. \u00a0Instead,\nwith a sigh, he pulled Jungkook away from his brother and laid on his back so\nthe boy could lay on his chest, rubbing his hand up and down his back.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s being a baby,\u201d Jimin fussed,\nkicking Yoongi\u2019s leg now.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStop kicking,\u201d Yoongi hissed. \u00a0\u201cAnd leave Jungkook alone. \u00a0He\u2019s sad. \nLet him be sad if he wants to be sad. \nGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNeed a story,\u201d Jimin said,\nthankfully stopping his kicking.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Yoongi said, shushing\nJungkook and running his fingers through his hair as he tried to think. \u00a0\u201cOkay, there were once two boys who were\nbrothers.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook sniffed, the topic\nobviously interesting to him. \u00a0\u201cAnd one\ntime they went out into the woods behind their house. \u00a0Their mother had told them to be careful and\nnot get lost. \u00a0There was a path they\nshould have stayed on. \u00a0But one of the\nboys wanted to go off of the path.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin said, about to put in\nhis two cents about why that was a bad idea, but Yoongi patted his leg and\nshushed him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe wasn\u2019t sure why he wanted to go\noff the path. \u00a0He had only heard of bad\nthings happening to people who did. \u00a0It\nwould be smarter and safer to stay on the path. \nThe boy knew this. \u00a0Both boys did. \u00a0But the younger brother wanted to anyway, so\none day he did. \u00a0His brother stayed on\nthe path, and he told his brother, begged his brother, not to leave, but do you\nknow what the younger brother did?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin said. \u00a0Jungkook hiccupped.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe went anyway. \u00a0And his brother thought he would never see\nhim again, but he still managed to come home that night. \u00a0The next time they went into the woods, the\nboy strayed off the path again. \u00a0He told\nhis brother it wasn\u2019t that bad, and since he found his way back once, he could\nfind it again. \u00a0This went on for\nyears. \u00a0The older brother grew more and\nmore worried, and the younger brother grew less and less concerned. \u00a0Each time he left the path, he was gone for\nlonger and longer, and it was harder and harder for him to find his way\nhome. \u00a0One time, he didn\u2019t come back for\nso long, his older brother had to go off the path to look for him. \u00a0When he found his baby brother, he was so\nglad, so happy, that he cried and cried. \nHe made his brother promise to never leave the path again, and his\nbrother did. \u00a0But he didn\u2019t keep that\npromise for long. \u00a0And eventually, he\nchose to never come home. \u00a0He decided\nleaving the path was better than staying with his brother. \u00a0It was a terrible decision. \u00a0It cost him his life. \u00a0After being away from his brother for too\nlong, he died.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin mumbled, curling up\naround Yoongi\u2019s arm. \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s breath\nhad evened out, and he had mostly gone quiet and still.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, oh.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t like this story,\u201d Jimin\nsaid, and Yoongi reached down to pat his leg again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t either, Jimin. \u00a0Hopefully tomorrow I can come up with a\nbetter one.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay, Yoo-yoo,\u201d Jimin whispered. \u00a0\u201cG\u2019night.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNight Jimin. \u00a0Night Jungkook,\u201d Yoongi whispered back. \u00a0He waited until the pair was asleep, his mind\nrunning through everything he was going to have to do and coming up with five\nnegative explanations for why he wasn\u2019t going to be able to do any of them,\nbefore he squeezed his eyes shut and kept them pressed together until they\nhurt, until his tears finally slipped out. \nJust a few. \u00a0That was all he\nneeded. \u00a0One for his brother, and one for\nhimself. \u00a0One for Jungkook, and one for\nJimin.</p><hr><p><b>A/N:</b></p><p>That\u2019s\nright, of course Jungkook has a bunny.</p><p>That\u2019s\nright, of course Jimin has a blanket.\u00a0 And yes, it\u2019s

Fun-er-ule</a></b></p><p><b>2. It\u2019s Where It Goes</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s funny how easily people\nunderestimate kids, especially when it comes to their memory. \u00a0Yoongi was sure the boys would forget that\nafternoon, would ask the next day where their dad was, would forget why they\nwere staying at his and not grandma\u2019s now, would not remember the last time\nthey had spent the night at his apartment.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yoongi is wrong about a lot of\nthings.</p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He made them carry things purely out\nof necessity, knowing full well they were tiny children who shouldn\u2019t be\nburdened with such things, especially up a flight of stairs, but Yoongi wasn\u2019t\nabout to make twenty trips when they had two hands and were capable of\nwalking. \u00a0They went slowly, sure, but\nthey both had a look of determination on their faces as they trudged up ahead\nof him. \u00a0Yoongi wasn\u2019t foolish or mean\nenough to have them walk behind him; if they started to fall, he\u2019d drop\nwhatever he was holding to make sure to catch them. \u00a0He assumed Jungkook would poop out first\npurely due to his age, but he dumped his load and stood waiting for Yoongi to\ngo out again while Jimin started to look around the apartment, trying to find\nhis place.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStay here, okay, Jimin? \u00a0Jungkook and I will be right back.\u201d \u00a0The boy waved a hand at them, so Yoongi took\nJungkook\u2019s and headed back downstairs, risking a smile at how excited the boy\nseemed to be simply going up and down a flight of stairs. \u00a0Kids love work until they realize it\u2019s work,\nYoongi figured. \u00a0They hadn\u2019t quite\nbrought everything from his brother\u2019s. \nFor one, it wouldn\u2019t all fit. \nYoongi\u2019s place was barely a loft, and his nephews were spoiled. \u00a0Getting them to pare down their toys would be\ndifficult, but if they can go a week without asking for a certain toy, he\u2019ll\nknow they must not have valued it very much. \nJungkook had his bunny,\nand Jimin had his blanket,\nand maybe Yoongi can maintain his sanity if can stay content with those.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He and Jungkook couldn\u2019t have been\ngone more than five minutes unloading the car he had borrowed from his parents,\nso for Jimin to have made such a fantastic mess in such a short period of time\nwas purely unbelievable. \u00a0He had thrown\ntheir clothes everywhere, for one thing, and he was trying to pull Yoongi\u2019s\nmattress off of its low frame. \u00a0A pot in\nthe windowsill had somehow fallen off, the dirt spilled over the floor like an\noverturned paint can, the succulent in no hurry to go anywhere as long as no\none stepped on it.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJimin,\u201d Yoongi said, surprised at\nhow calm he sounded despite how upset he felt.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot right, not right,\u201d Jimin\nmuttered, tugging fruitlessly on the mattress.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Yoongi tried\nagain, putting the bags down he was carrying and sharing a confused look with\nJungkook.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot right, it\u2019s not right,\u201d Jimin\nsaid again. \u00a0Sighing, Yoongi patted\nJungkook\u2019s head and went over to Jimin, stepping over the piles of clothes and\ntoys already taking up his floor.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s not right?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis goes there,\u201d Jimin said,\npointing to the bed and then toward the wall with the TV.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy does it go there?\u201d Yoongi asked\nseriously. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s where it goes,\u201d Jimin said, as\nif that helped prove his point. \u00a0Yoongi\nsat on the floor and leaned against the mattress, thereby making it even more\nimpossible for Jimin to move it. \u00a0The boy\nhuffed and stomped his foot. \u00a0\u201cYoo-yoo!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJimin. \u00a0This is my bed, and it stays here.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, it was there! \u00a0It was there,\u201d Jimin said, pointing again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was there, like, last year,\u201d\nYoongi said slowly, furrowing his brow. \nHaving found his rabbit, Jungkook came over and pulled on the mattress\nonce, too, before shrugging and giving up.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHeavy.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is,\u201d Yoongi nodded, trying not\nto smile the boy started to climb on top of it. \nHe gave him a boost up by pushing on his bottom, watching as Jungkook\nhalf-stood, half rested on his knees to look out the window. \u00a0\u201cJimin, my bed used to be over there. \u00a0Do you remember the last time you spent the\nnight?\u201d \u00a0Jimin nodded as he rushed to the\nother side of the small room. \u00a0It was\nlined with shelves, book shelves, a TV stand, and cabinets and nooks filled\nwith supplies. \u00a0His dresser and desk\nstood against the opposite wall while his mattress was under the wall with the\nwindow by the door to the patio because, believe it or not, it was the spot\nthat actually got the least amount of sun.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe made a fort!\u201d Jimin recalled,\nwaving his hands over his head. \u00a0\u201cAnd the\nceiling was so high.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis high!\u201d Jungkook explained,\nwaving his hands over his head, too. \nYoongi was pretty positive the younger boy didn\u2019t remember this at all,\nand he doubted Jimin really did, either. \nStill, the boy seemed adamant. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI remember,\u201d Yoongi said, not\nchoosing to remind the pair how much of a mess they had gotten into and how he\nhad taken them back to his brother with a footnote that read something along\nthe lines of: <i>Never again, hyung.</i></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had gotten the boys changed and\nlaid them down after getting wet from the pond at the funeral home, only waking\nthem up when his mom had told him if he let them sleep for too long they\nwouldn\u2019t sleep that night. \u00a0Plus, it had\nbeen dinner time. \u00a0Disturbing them had\nbeen almost as hard as trying to explain that their dad was dead to them. \u00a0To disrupt their nap would be to disrupt\ntheir peace, and they were going to need all of the time they could get in\nblissful ignorance before being rudely awakened to the fact that their new home\nwas a tiny apartment owned and occupied by the uncle. \u00a0But he had shaken them lightly on the mats,\nunable to hide a smile at how they smacked their lips and wrung their hands and\nblinked their sleepy eyes up at him. \u00a0The\npromise of food had been an effective lure, during which they had proceeded to\nget dirty again, plus moving boxes and bags had gotten them sweaty, and Yoongi\nlooked around the room and sighed, unsure if cleaning or taking a bath first\nwas the right thing to do. \u00a0He had no\nidea how any of this was going to work. \nHe could already foresee his electric bill tripling, his water bill\ndoubling, and his time to work dwindling. \nHis brother had left him money, but all the money in the world couldn\u2019t buy\ntime, and certainly couldn\u2019t buy what his sons would actually need.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJimin, Jungkook,\u201d Yoongi said,\nleaning his head back on the couch and unbuttoning his shirt. \u00a0\u201cWe need to talk about a few rules,\nokay? \u00a0Can you both come sit here and\nlisten?\u201d \u00a0Jungkook wiggled backwards off\nthe bed, his little legs dangling over the side until Yoongi reached up to help\nhim, and Jimin finally sighed exaggeratedly and sat down on his knees again,\nhis hands pressed against his thighs as he waited. \u00a0\u201cFirst, you need to clean up the mess you\nmade. \u00a0I\u2019m going to show you where to put\nyour clothes and where to put your toys, okay?\u201d \nTwo bobbing heads. \u00a0\u201cThen we\u2019re\ngoing to take a bath, no discussion. \nThen we\u2019re going to go to sleep.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut we need a bed to sleep,\u201d Jimin\npointed out.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll have to sleep with me\ntonight, okay?\u201d \u00a0The idea seemed more\nthan okay to the boys who both nodded enthusiastically. \u00a0Yoongi had no idea where he would put another\nbed, much less two, even if they were child-sized, in his apartment, but he\ncould come up with a solution later. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd\nI mean it. \u00a0Sleep. \u00a0Okay,\u201d Yoongi said, peeling off his shirt and\npointing to the two bottom shelves by the TV. \n\u201cSee those red and blue bins? \nThat\u2019s where your toys need to go. \nYour shoes need to go by the door.\u201d \nThe instructions seemed clear enough, but the boys simply sat there,\ntheir eyes wide and mouths in little \u201co\u201d shapes. \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi frowned before the two boys\nwere clamoring toward him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYoo-yoo, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFlower,\u201d Jungkook said, poking Yoongi\u2019s\nforearm hard enough that he flinched a little.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve seen my tattoos before.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot this one,\u201d Jimin said, patting\nthe one on his ribcage carefully.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I guess that\u2019s true,\u201d Yoongi\nsaid, looking down at the boy. \u00a0He could\ndistinctly remember a time his brother forced him to go to the beach. \u00a0Jungkook had been just a baby, then, and\nJimin was probably too young to remember it. \nYoongi hated the water, and he hated being shirtless, but he knows he\nwas that day. \u00a0It may be hard to remember\nwhat the water and the sun felt like, but the stares were impossible to forget. \u00a0His heart leapt and fell over, but Yoongi\nwasn\u2019t going to cry. \u00a0\u201cHow about\nthis?\u201d \u00a0He cleared his throat. \u00a0\u201cOnce you pick up your toys, we can take a\nbath, and I\u2019ll show you all of them.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMore tat\u2019oos?\u201d Jungkook whispered,\nand Yoongi held back a snort, nodding and patting his head. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go, Jimin, glean, glean.\u201d \u00a0Yoongi shouldn\u2019t have been so surprised when\nJungkook took the blue bin and Jimin took the red bin. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t even told them to separate their\ntoys, but they were smarter than he gave them credit for. \u00a0Perhaps smarter than anyone had given them\ncredit for, even their dad. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shaking his head, Yoongi sat up and\nstarted to pick up the clothes Jimin had thrown around, gathering them all in a\npile he placed by his dresser. \u00a0He had\nalready tried to make as much room as possible, stuffing his small closet as\nfull as possible with his own clothes to make space in the drawers. \u00a0Kids\u2019 clothes were also tiny, thankfully, so\nit looked like everything they had brought so far would fit in the bottom\ndrawer.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYoo-yoo,\u201d Jimin said, wiggling against\nYoongi\u2019s back. \u00a0Jungkook stood by his\nshoulder, still holding his bunny, the boy\u2019s eyes already getting droopy\nagain. \u00a0\u201cWe done!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh?\u201d Yoongi said, turning around to\nsee his floor clean again. \u00a0A few bags\nstill sat by the door, but most of them held food leftover from the wake. \u00a0\u201cGood job, you two.\u201d \u00a0Jimin beamed, and Jungkook smiled slightly,\nhugging his bunny closer to his chest. \n\u201cWe need to clean up the plant and those bags now.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut you said bath!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd tat\u2019oos,\u201d Jungkook whispered.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, I forgot about the plant and\nthe food. \u00a0We have to put the food up so\nwe can eat tomorrow. \u00a0And if don\u2019t pick\nup the plant, it will die. \u00a0Do you want\nit to die?\u201d \u00a0It was the wrong\nquestion. \u00a0The wrong word. \u00a0Yoongi knew immediately and somehow managed\nto keep his curse in his own head.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t wanna die,\u201d Jungkook\nmumbled. \u00a0Jimin looked like he was about\nto melt or explode right there.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not going to. \u00a0The plant will be fine,\u201d Yoongi said, scurrying\nacross the floor to pick it up to show them. \n\u201cLook, it\u2019s fine. \u00a0Jimin, can\nyou\u2014do you see that cup by the sink? \u00a0No,\nyou can\u2019t reach that. \u00a0Here, hold this,\u201d\nhe said, holding out the plant still in a little bed of dirt to the boy. \u00a0Jimin held out both of his hands carefully\nand took the plant as if it was a precious relic. \u00a0Brushing his hands on his already dirty\npants, Yoongi patted him on the head and stepped into the kitchen to grab a\nglass. \u00a0\u201cOkay, you can put it in here.\u201d \u00a0Jimin did, transferring the plant to the cup\ncarefully as Jungkook looked on. \u00a0\u201cGood\njob. \u00a0Now, this needs to go back in the\nwindowsill. \u00a0Think you can do that?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI can do it,\u201d Jimin nodded\nseriously, taking the cup and walking slowly toward the bed. \u00a0Yoongi watched as he tried to decide what to\ndo as he bent down to pick up the biggest pieces of the broken pot.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe Jungkook can hold it while\nyou climb up, then he can pass it to you?\u201d Yoongi suggested, and Jungkook\nhurried to help. \u00a0The plan seemed to\nwork, and Yoongi swept up the rest of the dirt and sharp bits quickly, thankful\nthe boys seemed patient for the time being. \nThey stayed quiet while he put the food away, too, and at one point when\nhe turned away from the fridge Jungkook was behind him, handing him another container.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, meaning every\nword. \u00a0By the time he was done, Jimin was\nlying on his side on the mattress, his eyes open but blinking rapidly. \u00a0\u201cUh uh,\u201d Yoongi said, \u201cbath first.\u201d \u00a0He expected more pouting and whining, as kids\nwho were tired usually got that way, but the pair seemed to grow quieter. \u00a0They stood against the wall while he stopped\nup the tub and began to fill it, dipping his fingers under the faucet a few\ntimes to check the temperature. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan you undress yourselves?\u201d Yoongi\nsaid after pouring some bubble bath in the water, which, yes he had lying\naround. \u00a0Jimin nodded and began working\non his shirt and pants while Jungkook simply held his bunny and stood watching\nYoongi. \u00a0\u201cJungkook?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe needs help \u2018cause he\u2019s a baby,\u201d\nJimin explained.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c\u2019m not,\u201d Jungkook muttered, but\nYoongi squatted down next to him anyway, holding out his hand.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBunny can\u2019t get wet, so let me put\nhim on the counter. \u00a0Then you can take\nyour shirt off.\u201d \u00a0The look Jungkook gave\nYoongi almost made him laugh it was so absurd. \nEventually, with Jimin naked and bouncing on his toes beside him,\nJungkook handed his bunny over, watching carefully as Yoongi put it on the\ncounter and then raised his eyebrows. \n\u201cShirt.\u201d \u00a0Yoongi and his mom had\nhelped them get out of their suits earlier, but he had a t-shirt and pants with\nelastic on them now, so he just needed to pull and tug, and they would come\noff. \u00a0Still, Jungkook reached for the hem\nand started to pull it off, but the second it went over his head he started to\nthrash around. \u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d Yoongi said,\ntugging the shirt off immediately, \u201cthere you go.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s eyes were wide, and he tried to\nreach for his bunny, but Yoongi grabbed his hands and squeezed them\ngently. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, bath first. \u00a0You\u2019re okay. \nPants now, alright?\u201d \u00a0Shaking his\nhead, Jungkook stamped his foot.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYoo-yoo, can I get in?\u201d Jimin said,\ngrowing impatient. \u00a0Yoongi nodded,\nwatching him climb over the edge as he took off Jungkook\u2019s pants. \u00a0The little boy went a little limp against him\nas he did all of the work, taking off his pull-up, too. \u00a0Realizing the boy must be on his last leg,\nYoongi took pity on him, picking him up and placing in the bath next to Jimin.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhere are your toys?\u201d Jimin said\nonce his brother was beside him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t have any toys,\u201d Yoongi\nsaid, unzipping his slacks and slipping them off. \u00a0He was reminded why he hated them as soon as\nthey pooled at his ankles. \u00a0Legs didn\u2019t\ntechnically need to breathe, and neither did his waist, but they suddenly felt\nlike they could again. \u00a0\u201cBath time is for\ngetting clean, not playing.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBoring,\u201d Jimin pouted, smacking the\nwater and sending a spray of water in Jungkook\u2019s face. \u00a0The boy whined and rubbed at his eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBath time is for getting clean,\u201d\nYoongi repeated, \u201cnot making a mess.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBoring,\u201d Jimin said again, but\nbefore he could slap the water again Yoongi took off his boxers and tried to\nslip into the bath next to them. \u00a0\u201cAh,\nYoo-yoo!\u201d the boy practically screamed, pointing as his uncle. \u00a0Jungkook followed his finger, and his pout\ndisappeared as his eyes got a little wide.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour pee-pee is big,\u201d Jungkook\nsaid, sounding wowed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\u2014\u201d Yoongi looked down and blinked\nbefore rolling his eyes. \u00a0He picked\nJungkook up a little to make room for himself before sitting down, being\ncareful not to let the water slosh up and over the sides. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t call it that.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s so big. \u00a0Why\u2019s it so big?\u201d Jimin said, trying to climb\nthrough the water to get a better look.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStop,\u201d Yoongi said, holding a hand\nto the boy\u2019s head to stop him from doing so. \nJungkook was staring down past his own lap, poking himself\nexperimentally. \u00a0\u201cMy penis,\u201d he said,\nemphasizing the word, \u201cis bigger than yours because I\u2019m an adult. \u00a0Yours will grow with your body.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d Jimin said, sitting back\ndown.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, and you should call things\nwhat they are. \u00a0It\u2019s not a pee-pee.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin hummed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow, can you get clean while I show\nyou my tattoos?\u201d \u00a0The boys assured him\nthey could, and while it was mostly him doing the cleaning of all three of\nthem, and they interrupted him more than they let him just tell them what each\nmeant, they at least got done before the water got too cold. \u00a0Satisfied with how clean they both were,\nYoongi got out first and found a towel for each of them. \u00a0Jungkook once again seemed incapable of\ntaking care of himself, so Yoongi kept him wrapped up until he was dry himself\nbefore he gave the boy a final rub down. \nAfter brushing their teeth and using the bathroom and making sure\neveryone was dressed, they both seemed more than compliant enough to go to bed\neasily, but the moment he got them both under the covers, his back against the\nwall like he was used to, Jungkook started to cry, and Jimin started to kick\nhim to try to get him to stop, which only made it worse. \u00a0Yoongi actually let them for a moment as he\ntook a deep breath. \u00a0He felt like crying,\ntoo, but he knew he couldn\u2019t. \u00a0Instead,\nwith a sigh, he pulled Jungkook away from his brother and laid on his back so\nthe boy could lay on his chest, rubbing his hand up and down his back.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s being a baby,\u201d Jimin fussed,\nkicking Yoongi\u2019s leg now.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStop kicking,\u201d Yoongi hissed. \u00a0\u201cAnd leave Jungkook alone. \u00a0He\u2019s sad. \nLet him be sad if he wants to be sad. \nGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNeed a story,\u201d Jimin said,\nthankfully stopping his kicking.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Yoongi said, shushing\nJungkook and running his fingers through his hair as he tried to think. \u00a0\u201cOkay, there were once two boys who were\nbrothers.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook sniffed, the topic\nobviously interesting to him. \u00a0\u201cAnd one\ntime they went out into the woods behind their house. \u00a0Their mother had told them to be careful and\nnot get lost. \u00a0There was a path they\nshould have stayed on. \u00a0But one of the\nboys wanted to go off of the path.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin said, about to put in\nhis two cents about why that was a bad idea, but Yoongi patted his leg and\nshushed him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe wasn\u2019t sure why he wanted to go\noff the path. \u00a0He had only heard of bad\nthings happening to people who did. \u00a0It\nwould be smarter and safer to stay on the path. \nThe boy knew this. \u00a0Both boys did. \u00a0But the younger brother wanted to anyway, so\none day he did. \u00a0His brother stayed on\nthe path, and he told his brother, begged his brother, not to leave, but do you\nknow what the younger brother did?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin said. \u00a0Jungkook hiccupped.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe went anyway. \u00a0And his brother thought he would never see\nhim again, but he still managed to come home that night. \u00a0The next time they went into the woods, the\nboy strayed off the path again. \u00a0He told\nhis brother it wasn\u2019t that bad, and since he found his way back once, he could\nfind it again. \u00a0This went on for\nyears. \u00a0The older brother grew more and\nmore worried, and the younger brother grew less and less concerned. \u00a0Each time he left the path, he was gone for\nlonger and longer, and it was harder and harder for him to find his way\nhome. \u00a0One time, he didn\u2019t come back for\nso long, his older brother had to go off the path to look for him. \u00a0When he found his baby brother, he was so\nglad, so happy, that he cried and cried. \nHe made his brother promise to never leave the path again, and his\nbrother did. \u00a0But he didn\u2019t keep that\npromise for long. \u00a0And eventually, he\nchose to never come home. \u00a0He decided\nleaving the path was better than staying with his brother. \u00a0It was a terrible decision. \u00a0It cost him his life. \u00a0After being away from his brother for too\nlong, he died.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin mumbled, curling up\naround Yoongi\u2019s arm. \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s breath\nhad evened out, and he had mostly gone quiet and still.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, oh.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t like this story,\u201d Jimin\nsaid, and Yoongi reached down to pat his leg again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t either, Jimin. \u00a0Hopefully tomorrow I can come up with a\nbetter one.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay, Yoo-yoo,\u201d Jimin whispered. \u00a0\u201cG\u2019night.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNight Jimin. \u00a0Night Jungkook,\u201d Yoongi whispered back. \u00a0He waited until the pair was asleep, his mind\nrunning through everything he was going to have to do and coming up with five\nnegative explanations for why he wasn\u2019t going to be able to do any of them,\nbefore he squeezed his eyes shut and kept them pressed together until they\nhurt, until his tears finally slipped out. \nJust a few. \u00a0That was all he\nneeded. \u00a0One for his brother, and one for\nhimself. \u00a0One for Jungkook, and one for\nJimin.</p><hr><p><b>A/N:</b></p><p>That\u2019s\nright, of course Jungkook has a bunny.</p><p>That\u2019s\nright, of course Jimin has a blanket.\u00a0 And yes, it\u2019s

Fun-er-ule</a></b></p><p><b>2. It&rsquo;s Where It Goes</b></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s funny how easily people\nunderestimate kids, especially when it comes to their memory. &nbsp;Yoongi was sure the boys would forget that\nafternoon, would ask the next day where their dad was, would forget why they\nwere staying at his and not grandma&rsquo;s now, would not remember the last time\nthey had spent the night at his apartment.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi is wrong about a lot of\nthings.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He made them carry things purely out\nof necessity, knowing full well they were tiny children who shouldn&rsquo;t be\nburdened with such things, especially up a flight of stairs, but Yoongi wasn&rsquo;t\nabout to make twenty trips when they had two hands and were capable of\nwalking. &nbsp;They went slowly, sure, but\nthey both had a look of determination on their faces as they trudged up ahead\nof him. &nbsp;Yoongi wasn&rsquo;t foolish or mean\nenough to have them walk behind him; if they started to fall, he&rsquo;d drop\nwhatever he was holding to make sure to catch them. &nbsp;He assumed Jungkook would poop out first\npurely due to his age, but he dumped his load and stood waiting for Yoongi to\ngo out again while Jimin started to look around the apartment, trying to find\nhis place.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Stay here, okay, Jimin? &nbsp;Jungkook and I will be right back.&rdquo; &nbsp;The boy waved a hand at them, so Yoongi took\nJungkook&rsquo;s and headed back downstairs, risking a smile at how excited the boy\nseemed to be simply going up and down a flight of stairs. &nbsp;Kids love work until they realize it&rsquo;s work,\nYoongi figured. &nbsp;They hadn&rsquo;t quite\nbrought everything from his brother&rsquo;s. \nFor one, it wouldn&rsquo;t all fit. \nYoongi&rsquo;s place was barely a loft, and his nephews were spoiled. &nbsp;Getting them to pare down their toys would be\ndifficult, but if they can go a week without asking for a certain toy, he&rsquo;ll\nknow they must not have valued it very much. \nJungkook had his bunny,\nand Jimin had his blanket,\nand maybe Yoongi can maintain his sanity if can stay content with those.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He and Jungkook couldn&rsquo;t have been\ngone more than five minutes unloading the car he had borrowed from his parents,\nso for Jimin to have made such a fantastic mess in such a short period of time\nwas purely unbelievable. &nbsp;He had thrown\ntheir clothes everywhere, for one thing, and he was trying to pull Yoongi&rsquo;s\nmattress off of its low frame. &nbsp;A pot in\nthe windowsill had somehow fallen off, the dirt spilled over the floor like an\noverturned paint can, the succulent in no hurry to go anywhere as long as no\none stepped on it.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jimin,&rdquo; Yoongi said, surprised at\nhow calm he sounded despite how upset he felt.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Not right, not right,&rdquo; Jimin\nmuttered, tugging fruitlessly on the mattress.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Yoongi tried\nagain, putting the bags down he was carrying and sharing a confused look with\nJungkook.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Not right, it&rsquo;s not right,&rdquo; Jimin\nsaid again. &nbsp;Sighing, Yoongi patted\nJungkook&rsquo;s head and went over to Jimin, stepping over the piles of clothes and\ntoys already taking up his floor.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s not right?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;This goes there,&rdquo; Jimin said,\npointing to the bed and then toward the wall with the TV.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why does it go there?&rdquo; Yoongi asked\nseriously. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s where it goes,&rdquo; Jimin said, as\nif that helped prove his point. &nbsp;Yoongi\nsat on the floor and leaned against the mattress, thereby making it even more\nimpossible for Jimin to move it. &nbsp;The boy\nhuffed and stomped his foot. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yoo-yoo!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jimin. &nbsp;This is my bed, and it stays here.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No, it was there! &nbsp;It was there,&rdquo; Jimin said, pointing again.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It was there, like, last year,&rdquo;\nYoongi said slowly, furrowing his brow. \nHaving found his rabbit, Jungkook came over and pulled on the mattress\nonce, too, before shrugging and giving up.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Heavy.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Yoongi nodded, trying not\nto smile the boy started to climb on top of it. \nHe gave him a boost up by pushing on his bottom, watching as Jungkook\nhalf-stood, half rested on his knees to look out the window. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jimin, my bed used to be over there. &nbsp;Do you remember the last time you spent the\nnight?&rdquo; &nbsp;Jimin nodded as he rushed to the\nother side of the small room. &nbsp;It was\nlined with shelves, book shelves, a TV stand, and cabinets and nooks filled\nwith supplies. &nbsp;His dresser and desk\nstood against the opposite wall while his mattress was under the wall with the\nwindow by the door to the patio because, believe it or not, it was the spot\nthat actually got the least amount of sun.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;We made a fort!&rdquo; Jimin recalled,\nwaving his hands over his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;And the\nceiling was so high.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;This high!&rdquo; Jungkook explained,\nwaving his hands over his head, too. \nYoongi was pretty positive the younger boy didn&rsquo;t remember this at all,\nand he doubted Jimin really did, either. \nStill, the boy seemed adamant. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Yoongi said, not\nchoosing to remind the pair how much of a mess they had gotten into and how he\nhad taken them back to his brother with a footnote that read something along\nthe lines of: <i>Never again, hyung.</i></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had gotten the boys changed and\nlaid them down after getting wet from the pond at the funeral home, only waking\nthem up when his mom had told him if he let them sleep for too long they\nwouldn&rsquo;t sleep that night. &nbsp;Plus, it had\nbeen dinner time. &nbsp;Disturbing them had\nbeen almost as hard as trying to explain that their dad was dead to them. &nbsp;To disrupt their nap would be to disrupt\ntheir peace, and they were going to need all of the time they could get in\nblissful ignorance before being rudely awakened to the fact that their new home\nwas a tiny apartment owned and occupied by the uncle. &nbsp;But he had shaken them lightly on the mats,\nunable to hide a smile at how they smacked their lips and wrung their hands and\nblinked their sleepy eyes up at him. &nbsp;The\npromise of food had been an effective lure, during which they had proceeded to\nget dirty again, plus moving boxes and bags had gotten them sweaty, and Yoongi\nlooked around the room and sighed, unsure if cleaning or taking a bath first\nwas the right thing to do. &nbsp;He had no\nidea how any of this was going to work. \nHe could already foresee his electric bill tripling, his water bill\ndoubling, and his time to work dwindling. \nHis brother had left him money, but all the money in the world couldn&rsquo;t buy\ntime, and certainly couldn&rsquo;t buy what his sons would actually need.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jimin, Jungkook,&rdquo; Yoongi said,\nleaning his head back on the couch and unbuttoning his shirt. &nbsp;&ldquo;We need to talk about a few rules,\nokay? &nbsp;Can you both come sit here and\nlisten?&rdquo; &nbsp;Jungkook wiggled backwards off\nthe bed, his little legs dangling over the side until Yoongi reached up to help\nhim, and Jimin finally sighed exaggeratedly and sat down on his knees again,\nhis hands pressed against his thighs as he waited. &nbsp;&ldquo;First, you need to clean up the mess you\nmade. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to show you where to put\nyour clothes and where to put your toys, okay?&rdquo; \nTwo bobbing heads. &nbsp;&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re\ngoing to take a bath, no discussion. \nThen we&rsquo;re going to go to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;But we need a bed to sleep,&rdquo; Jimin\npointed out.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to sleep with me\ntonight, okay?&rdquo; &nbsp;The idea seemed more\nthan okay to the boys who both nodded enthusiastically. &nbsp;Yoongi had no idea where he would put another\nbed, much less two, even if they were child-sized, in his apartment, but he\ncould come up with a solution later. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And\nI mean it. &nbsp;Sleep. &nbsp;Okay,&rdquo; Yoongi said, peeling off his shirt and\npointing to the two bottom shelves by the TV. \n&ldquo;See those red and blue bins? \nThat&rsquo;s where your toys need to go. \nYour shoes need to go by the door.&rdquo; \nThe instructions seemed clear enough, but the boys simply sat there,\ntheir eyes wide and mouths in little &ldquo;o&rdquo; shapes. &nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Yoongi frowned before the two boys\nwere clamoring toward him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yoo-yoo, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Flower,&rdquo; Jungkook said, poking Yoongi&rsquo;s\nforearm hard enough that he flinched a little.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen my tattoos before.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Not this one,&rdquo; Jimin said, patting\nthe one on his ribcage carefully.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, I guess that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Yoongi\nsaid, looking down at the boy. &nbsp;He could\ndistinctly remember a time his brother forced him to go to the beach. &nbsp;Jungkook had been just a baby, then, and\nJimin was probably too young to remember it. \nYoongi hated the water, and he hated being shirtless, but he knows he\nwas that day. &nbsp;It may be hard to remember\nwhat the water and the sun felt like, but the stares were impossible to forget. &nbsp;His heart leapt and fell over, but Yoongi\nwasn&rsquo;t going to cry. &nbsp;&ldquo;How about\nthis?&rdquo; &nbsp;He cleared his throat. &nbsp;&ldquo;Once you pick up your toys, we can take a\nbath, and I&rsquo;ll show you all of them.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;More tat&rsquo;oos?&rdquo; Jungkook whispered,\nand Yoongi held back a snort, nodding and patting his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Jimin, glean, glean.&rdquo; &nbsp;Yoongi shouldn&rsquo;t have been so surprised when\nJungkook took the blue bin and Jimin took the red bin. &nbsp;He hadn&rsquo;t even told them to separate their\ntoys, but they were smarter than he gave them credit for. &nbsp;Perhaps smarter than anyone had given them\ncredit for, even their dad. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shaking his head, Yoongi sat up and\nstarted to pick up the clothes Jimin had thrown around, gathering them all in a\npile he placed by his dresser. &nbsp;He had\nalready tried to make as much room as possible, stuffing his small closet as\nfull as possible with his own clothes to make space in the drawers. &nbsp;Kids&rsquo; clothes were also tiny, thankfully, so\nit looked like everything they had brought so far would fit in the bottom\ndrawer.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yoo-yoo,&rdquo; Jimin said, wiggling against\nYoongi&rsquo;s back. &nbsp;Jungkook stood by his\nshoulder, still holding his bunny, the boy&rsquo;s eyes already getting droopy\nagain. &nbsp;&ldquo;We done!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Yoongi said, turning around to\nsee his floor clean again. &nbsp;A few bags\nstill sat by the door, but most of them held food leftover from the wake. &nbsp;&ldquo;Good job, you two.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jimin beamed, and Jungkook smiled slightly,\nhugging his bunny closer to his chest. \n&ldquo;We need to clean up the plant and those bags now.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;But you said bath!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;And tat&rsquo;oos,&rdquo; Jungkook whispered.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I forgot about the plant and\nthe food. &nbsp;We have to put the food up so\nwe can eat tomorrow. &nbsp;And if don&rsquo;t pick\nup the plant, it will die. &nbsp;Do you want\nit to die?&rdquo; &nbsp;It was the wrong\nquestion. &nbsp;The wrong word. &nbsp;Yoongi knew immediately and somehow managed\nto keep his curse in his own head.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wanna die,&rdquo; Jungkook\nmumbled. &nbsp;Jimin looked like he was about\nto melt or explode right there.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to. &nbsp;The plant will be fine,&rdquo; Yoongi said, scurrying\nacross the floor to pick it up to show them. \n&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s fine. &nbsp;Jimin, can\nyou&mdash;do you see that cup by the sink? &nbsp;No,\nyou can&rsquo;t reach that. &nbsp;Here, hold this,&rdquo;\nhe said, holding out the plant still in a little bed of dirt to the boy. &nbsp;Jimin held out both of his hands carefully\nand took the plant as if it was a precious relic. &nbsp;Brushing his hands on his already dirty\npants, Yoongi patted him on the head and stepped into the kitchen to grab a\nglass. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, you can put it in here.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jimin did, transferring the plant to the cup\ncarefully as Jungkook looked on. &nbsp;&ldquo;Good\njob. &nbsp;Now, this needs to go back in the\nwindowsill. &nbsp;Think you can do that?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I can do it,&rdquo; Jimin nodded\nseriously, taking the cup and walking slowly toward the bed. &nbsp;Yoongi watched as he tried to decide what to\ndo as he bent down to pick up the biggest pieces of the broken pot.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe Jungkook can hold it while\nyou climb up, then he can pass it to you?&rdquo; Yoongi suggested, and Jungkook\nhurried to help. &nbsp;The plan seemed to\nwork, and Yoongi swept up the rest of the dirt and sharp bits quickly, thankful\nthe boys seemed patient for the time being. \nThey stayed quiet while he put the food away, too, and at one point when\nhe turned away from the fridge Jungkook was behind him, handing him another container.\n &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, meaning every\nword. &nbsp;By the time he was done, Jimin was\nlying on his side on the mattress, his eyes open but blinking rapidly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Uh uh,&rdquo; Yoongi said, &ldquo;bath first.&rdquo; &nbsp;He expected more pouting and whining, as kids\nwho were tired usually got that way, but the pair seemed to grow quieter. &nbsp;They stood against the wall while he stopped\nup the tub and began to fill it, dipping his fingers under the faucet a few\ntimes to check the temperature. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Can you undress yourselves?&rdquo; Yoongi\nsaid after pouring some bubble bath in the water, which, yes he had lying\naround. &nbsp;Jimin nodded and began working\non his shirt and pants while Jungkook simply held his bunny and stood watching\nYoongi. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jungkook?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;He needs help &lsquo;cause he&rsquo;s a baby,&rdquo;\nJimin explained.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Jungkook muttered, but\nYoongi squatted down next to him anyway, holding out his hand.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Bunny can&rsquo;t get wet, so let me put\nhim on the counter. &nbsp;Then you can take\nyour shirt off.&rdquo; &nbsp;The look Jungkook gave\nYoongi almost made him laugh it was so absurd. \nEventually, with Jimin naked and bouncing on his toes beside him,\nJungkook handed his bunny over, watching carefully as Yoongi put it on the\ncounter and then raised his eyebrows. \n&ldquo;Shirt.&rdquo; &nbsp;Yoongi and his mom had\nhelped them get out of their suits earlier, but he had a t-shirt and pants with\nelastic on them now, so he just needed to pull and tug, and they would come\noff. &nbsp;Still, Jungkook reached for the hem\nand started to pull it off, but the second it went over his head he started to\nthrash around. &nbsp; &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Yoongi said,\ntugging the shirt off immediately, &ldquo;there you go.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes were wide, and he tried to\nreach for his bunny, but Yoongi grabbed his hands and squeezed them\ngently. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, bath first. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re okay. \nPants now, alright?&rdquo; &nbsp;Shaking his\nhead, Jungkook stamped his foot.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yoo-yoo, can I get in?&rdquo; Jimin said,\ngrowing impatient. &nbsp;Yoongi nodded,\nwatching him climb over the edge as he took off Jungkook&rsquo;s pants. &nbsp;The little boy went a little limp against him\nas he did all of the work, taking off his pull-up, too. &nbsp;Realizing the boy must be on his last leg,\nYoongi took pity on him, picking him up and placing in the bath next to Jimin.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Where are your toys?&rdquo; Jimin said\nonce his brother was beside him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any toys,&rdquo; Yoongi\nsaid, unzipping his slacks and slipping them off. &nbsp;He was reminded why he hated them as soon as\nthey pooled at his ankles. &nbsp;Legs didn&rsquo;t\ntechnically need to breathe, and neither did his waist, but they suddenly felt\nlike they could again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Bath time is for\ngetting clean, not playing.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Boring,&rdquo; Jimin pouted, smacking the\nwater and sending a spray of water in Jungkook&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;The boy whined and rubbed at his eyes.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Bath time is for getting clean,&rdquo;\nYoongi repeated, &ldquo;not making a mess.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Boring,&rdquo; Jimin said again, but\nbefore he could slap the water again Yoongi took off his boxers and tried to\nslip into the bath next to them. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ah,\nYoo-yoo!&rdquo; the boy practically screamed, pointing as his uncle. &nbsp;Jungkook followed his finger, and his pout\ndisappeared as his eyes got a little wide.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Your pee-pee is big,&rdquo; Jungkook\nsaid, sounding wowed.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My&mdash;&rdquo; Yoongi looked down and blinked\nbefore rolling his eyes. &nbsp;He picked\nJungkook up a little to make room for himself before sitting down, being\ncareful not to let the water slosh up and over the sides. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call it that.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so big. &nbsp;Why&rsquo;s it so big?&rdquo; Jimin said, trying to climb\nthrough the water to get a better look.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; Yoongi said, holding a hand\nto the boy&rsquo;s head to stop him from doing so. \nJungkook was staring down past his own lap, poking himself\nexperimentally. &nbsp;&ldquo;My penis,&rdquo; he said,\nemphasizing the word, &ldquo;is bigger than yours because I&rsquo;m an adult. &nbsp;Yours will grow with your body.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Jimin said, sitting back\ndown.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, and you should call things\nwhat they are. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not a pee-pee.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Jimin hummed.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Now, can you get clean while I show\nyou my tattoos?&rdquo; &nbsp;The boys assured him\nthey could, and while it was mostly him doing the cleaning of all three of\nthem, and they interrupted him more than they let him just tell them what each\nmeant, they at least got done before the water got too cold. &nbsp;Satisfied with how clean they both were,\nYoongi got out first and found a towel for each of them. &nbsp;Jungkook once again seemed incapable of\ntaking care of himself, so Yoongi kept him wrapped up until he was dry himself\nbefore he gave the boy a final rub down. \nAfter brushing their teeth and using the bathroom and making sure\neveryone was dressed, they both seemed more than compliant enough to go to bed\neasily, but the moment he got them both under the covers, his back against the\nwall like he was used to, Jungkook started to cry, and Jimin started to kick\nhim to try to get him to stop, which only made it worse. &nbsp;Yoongi actually let them for a moment as he\ntook a deep breath. &nbsp;He felt like crying,\ntoo, but he knew he couldn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Instead,\nwith a sigh, he pulled Jungkook away from his brother and laid on his back so\nthe boy could lay on his chest, rubbing his hand up and down his back.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s being a baby,&rdquo; Jimin fussed,\nkicking Yoongi&rsquo;s leg now.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Stop kicking,&rdquo; Yoongi hissed. &nbsp;&ldquo;And leave Jungkook alone. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s sad. \nLet him be sad if he wants to be sad. \nGo to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Need a story,&rdquo; Jimin said,\nthankfully stopping his kicking.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Yoongi said, shushing\nJungkook and running his fingers through his hair as he tried to think. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, there were once two boys who were\nbrothers.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jungkook sniffed, the topic\nobviously interesting to him. &nbsp;&ldquo;And one\ntime they went out into the woods behind their house. &nbsp;Their mother had told them to be careful and\nnot get lost. &nbsp;There was a path they\nshould have stayed on. &nbsp;But one of the\nboys wanted to go off of the path.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Jimin said, about to put in\nhis two cents about why that was a bad idea, but Yoongi patted his leg and\nshushed him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t sure why he wanted to go\noff the path. &nbsp;He had only heard of bad\nthings happening to people who did. &nbsp;It\nwould be smarter and safer to stay on the path. \nThe boy knew this. &nbsp;Both boys did. &nbsp;But the younger brother wanted to anyway, so\none day he did. &nbsp;His brother stayed on\nthe path, and he told his brother, begged his brother, not to leave, but do you\nknow what the younger brother did?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Jimin said. &nbsp;Jungkook hiccupped.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;He went anyway. &nbsp;And his brother thought he would never see\nhim again, but he still managed to come home that night. &nbsp;The next time they went into the woods, the\nboy strayed off the path again. &nbsp;He told\nhis brother it wasn&rsquo;t that bad, and since he found his way back once, he could\nfind it again. &nbsp;This went on for\nyears. &nbsp;The older brother grew more and\nmore worried, and the younger brother grew less and less concerned. &nbsp;Each time he left the path, he was gone for\nlonger and longer, and it was harder and harder for him to find his way\nhome. &nbsp;One time, he didn&rsquo;t come back for\nso long, his older brother had to go off the path to look for him. &nbsp;When he found his baby brother, he was so\nglad, so happy, that he cried and cried. \nHe made his brother promise to never leave the path again, and his\nbrother did. &nbsp;But he didn&rsquo;t keep that\npromise for long. &nbsp;And eventually, he\nchose to never come home. &nbsp;He decided\nleaving the path was better than staying with his brother. &nbsp;It was a terrible decision. &nbsp;It cost him his life. &nbsp;After being away from his brother for too\nlong, he died.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Jimin mumbled, curling up\naround Yoongi&rsquo;s arm. &nbsp;Jungkook&rsquo;s breath\nhad evened out, and he had mostly gone quiet and still.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, oh.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this story,&rdquo; Jimin\nsaid, and Yoongi reached down to pat his leg again.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either, Jimin. &nbsp;Hopefully tomorrow I can come up with a\nbetter one.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, Yoo-yoo,&rdquo; Jimin whispered. &nbsp;&ldquo;G&rsquo;night.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Night Jimin. &nbsp;Night Jungkook,&rdquo; Yoongi whispered back. &nbsp;He waited until the pair was asleep, his mind\nrunning through everything he was going to have to do and coming up with five\nnegative explanations for why he wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to do any of them,\nbefore he squeezed his eyes shut and kept them pressed together until they\nhurt, until his tears finally slipped out. \nJust a few. &nbsp;That was all he\nneeded. &nbsp;One for his brother, and one for\nhimself. &nbsp;One for Jungkook, and one for\nJimin.</p><hr /><p><b>A/N:</b></p><p>That&rsquo;s\nright, of course Jungkook has a bunny.</p><p>That&rsquo;s\nright, of course Jimin has a blanket.&nbsp;
