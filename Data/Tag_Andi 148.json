        "answer": "<p>I was so hyped the day those pictures came out oh my god. I would be interested in knowing more about how that photo campaign came together. Although they seemed to cover their bases as far as relevant teen TV shows go (Riverdale, 13RW, Andi Mack) it doesn\u2019t seem like they were all too concerned about how recognizable everyone was since there were also much lesser known models included in the campaign. But Luke and Josh were the only two people included in the campaign who were actually too young to vote in the election, so I\u2019m assuming they weren\u2019t really interested in any of the younger cast members to be part of it. I doubt Josh and Luke would have even been included if Andi Mack weren\u2019t so well known for its diversity, and if Josh wasn\u2019t so political.\u00a0</p><p>Either way. Still thrilled that they did that. It was such a good shoot.</p>",
