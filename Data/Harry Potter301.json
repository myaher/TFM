Only this time, they were down a few numbers. Mad-Eye, then Tonks, Lupin, and Fred. It was as if the light that formerly blazed brightly had been stifled, choked out. Where did they go from here?</p><p>Molly was busying herself cooking after the burial. Arthur tried stopping her, but she refused. She needed to get her mind off things; she needed someone to take care of. Thankfully, she had a house full of people, with more trickling in as time went on. </p><p>Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione were distracting themselves with little Teddy. Andromeda brought him to pay her respects to the young man who fought with her daughter for a better future for her grandson. Andromeda was currently helping Molly with the meal preparations, also grateful for the distraction. </p><p>\u201cHow does it feel to be a godfather, Harry?\u201d Hermione asked as she let the month old baby grab her finger.</p><p>\u201cA bit strange. I\u2019m partially responsible for this tiny person but I\u2019m-\u201d Harry stopped when he realized Ginny and Ron had started softly crying again. Ron reached for his sister\u2019s hand, which she gave him, squeezing his own. Hermione brought her forehead to Ron\u2019s shoulder and grasped his other hand while Harry shifted Teddy to his other arm, slipping his free hand into Ginny\u2019s vacant hand. </p><p>As they sat in quiet grief, another visitor arrived at the Burrow. She cautiously entered the house and looked around. Harry didn\u2019t recognize her, but his observation of her was noticed by those near him, who also looked up.</p><p>Ron rubbed his eyes, \u201cBlimey Gin, is that her?\u201d</p><p>Ginny squinted, \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen her in years, have we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was at Bill\u2019s wedding before\u2026 everything that happened. But I didn\u2019t expect to see her here. Charlie said she was in the Netherlands.\u201d Harry and Hermione looked at each other with raised eyebrows as Ron spoke of the mystery woman. Before they could ask who she was, it seemed Molly had taken notice of her.</p><p>\u201cOh darling, my darling girl.\u201d Molly ran to her and embraced her in a hug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you Mrs. Weasley.\u201d The woman wrapped her arms around the older woman.</p><p>\u201cFor the last time, I\u2019m Molly. Or Mom, whichever you prefer.\u201d The unknown woman blushed bright red, leaving Harry and Hermione confused.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Harry asked. </p><p>\u201cCharlie\u2019s old girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought Charlie dated anyone.\u201d Hermione posed quizzically.</p><p>\u201cJust her. They went to Hogwarts together. She\u2019s a friend of Bill\u2019s too.\u201d Ron watched his mother call after the rest of their family to greet her.</p><p>\u201cShe seems pretty close with your family. How come we\u2019ve never met her before?\u201d Harry was thankful for her arrival; it gave them something to do besides thinking of the unimaginable horror they experienced just a week ago. The woman was now being greeted by Arthur, Percy, and George.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working in Holland. She\u2019s researching cultural differences between different wizarding communities.\u201d Ginny looked at Ron. \u201cWe should probably go say hi.\u201d The two begrudgingly stood, leaving Harry and Hermione alone with Teddy.</p><p>\u201cI guess we ought to stay put.\u201d Harry posited as the two watched the woman greet Ginny and Ron. </p><p>\u201cLook at you! You\u2019re all grown up.\u201d She gave them a sad smile. \u201cI hear that your whole family played a part in defeating Voldemort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d Ron shuffled, unsure on how to continue the conversation on such a heavy topic without opening the fresh wound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been prouder to know you all. What you\u2019ve done is amazing.\u201d As she spoke, Bill and Charlie ambled up.</p><p>\u201cAnya?\u201d Charlie half-whispered. When she met his eye, she flushed and nearly threw herself on him. The two were wrapped around each other as if their lives\u2019 depended on it, while everyone else watched. They quietly whispered to each other during their embrace when finally Bill cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you too, Anya.\u201d Anya pulled away from Charlie, reddening a bit, and hugged Bill. </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s alright. I know where I stand with you two.\u201d Bill tried his best to smile before calling over his wife to greet his old friend. </p><p>As Anya spoke to the Weasleys, Harry watched her face shift. \u201cHe\u2019s here?\u201d </p><p>Harry saw Charlie point in his direction and Harry felt overwhelmed. Sure he was used to the stares and comments at this point, but he didn\u2019t feel comfortable receiving that kind of attention at his friend\u2019s funeral. As Anya walked over, Harry\u2019s stomach turned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s Harry, right?\u201d She asked delicately.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan I hold him?\u201d Only then did Harry realize she was talking about Teddy. </p><p>\u201cOh, uh, of course.\u201d Harry gingerly handed her the infant.</p><p>\u201cHe looks just like her.\u201d Anya delicately dragged a finger along his face. \u201cHis name is Edward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we call him Teddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there, Teddy.\u201d Anya sat down as she whispered to the baby. Charlie sat next to her. \u201cYour mother was a very good friend of mine. She was a wonderful woman.\u201d Harry noticed Anya was choking back tears, also noticing when Charlie began to rub her back to comfort her. Anya looked back at Harry, \u201cYou\u2019re the godfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm, yes. His dad- Remus- was one of my dad\u2019s best friends.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss.\u201d Anya gave him a sad smile.</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d was all Harry could bring himself to say without crying.</p><p>\u201cHarry is Ginny\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d Charlie nudged Anya. \u201cAnd Hermione over here,\u201d only then did Harry realize how quiet she\u2019d been, \u201cis Ron\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d Hermione blushed scarlet upon the description. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard an awful lot about the two of you from Charlie and Bill.\u201d Anya spoke to them but her eyes kept darting back to Teddy.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Hermione said with a tone of surprise. </p><p>\u201cYeah, really?\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t help but blurt out. He\u2019d only met Charlie a handful of times and was never too close with Bill either. It shocked him that either of them would mention him to a total stranger.</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s not everyday your siblings meet the Chosen One and the brightest witch of her age.\u201d Charlie winked at the two. \u201cOr get dragged into breaking about fifty school rules with them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t break just as many rules back in our day.\u201d Anya chided jokingly. </p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow. He knew Charlie had been a prefect, and pretty well-behaved from what he\u2019d heard, aside from his dangerous fascination with magical creatures.</p><p>\u201cAt least I wasn\u2019t Head Boy like Bill!\u201d Charlie turned his attention back to Hermione and Harry. \u201cThis girl could\u2019ve gotten us expelled more times than I can count.\u201d</p><p>The lighter mood was broken when Teddy started to cry, reminding everyone of the gravity of their circumstances. Andromeda hurried over to take him off Anya\u2019s hands, greeting her with a hug in the process.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, dear girl?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well, Mrs. Tonks, thank you. Your grandson is absolutely beautiful.\u201d Anya placed a light kiss on Teddy\u2019s forehead before she handed him back to his grandmother. </p><p>\u201cHe keeps me young. Thankfully, I\u2019ve got Harry to help out with him.\u201d Andromeda had returned with a bottle of milk, which she placed in Teddy\u2019s mouth. </p><p>\u201cI can take him if you need to go back to the kitchen.\u201d Hermione reached for the baby and Andromeda obliged.</p><p>\u201cThe food will be about twenty more minutes.\u201d And hurried back.</p><p>\u201cRowan wanted to come but she wasn\u2019t able to get back in time. She sends her regards.\u201d Anya turned to Charlie. \u201cHave you heard from the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Barnaby was here earlier but he had to leave. The rest sent owls. I guess we\u2019ll see them later this week.\u201d Harry wondered what was happening later this week before realizing Charlie had gone to school with Tonks- and Tonks and Lupin\u2019s joint funeral was that next Tuesday. He felt his stomach churn.</p><p>Anya carefully turned to Charlie. \u201cWould you mind if I- if I went outside to- to say goodbye?\u201d Charlie nodded and stood. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go with me, it\u2019s fine-\u201d </p><p>Charlie silently grabbed her hand and escorted her to the backyard. As he did, Ginny and Ron finally returned.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the two of them going? To snog?\u201d Ron made his best attempt at a joke, realizing the actual situation when it was too late. </p><p>\u201cSo, Anya is her name?\u201d Hermione asked, holding Teddy\u2019s bottle. Ron nodded and she continued. \u201cAnd she used to date Charlie? As in, they\u2019re not together anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d Ginny sat back down next to Harry and rested her head on shoulder. </p><p>\u201cCharlie doesn\u2019t talk about it much, at least not with us. Bill probably knows loads more.\u201d Ron absentmindedly rubbed Teddy\u2019s tiny arm. </p><p>\u201cIt seems like they still love each other.\u201d Ginny continued. \u201cBut they love their work too. And that puts them in different places a lot of the time. It\u2019s hard to be together when you\u2019re on opposite sides of the continent.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey graduated right before we started Hogwarts. So she went to school with Bill, Charlie, Percy, George, and\u2026 Fred.\u201d Ron winced while saying his name. \u201cWe only know her from summer visits and all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe seems\u2026 kind.\u201d Hermione was careful not to move as Teddy had just fallen asleep.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s pretty alright.\u201d </p><p>-</p><p>Dinner was served and Anya and Charlie made their way back inside. Their eyes were bloodshot but Anya tried to smile regardless. </p><p>\u201cThe food looks excellent, Molly.\u201d Anya handed Charlie a plate before grabbing her own. \u201cOh, and I almost forgot!\u201d Anya ran back to the living room where she\u2019d dropped off her back, returning with a metal tin. \u201cI made cookies. They\u2019re called stroopwafels, they\u2019re a Dutch cookie.\u201d</p><p>Charlie immediately reached for a cookie, \u201cGod, I miss your baking.\u201d </p><p>Anya smacked his hand away, \u201cEat your dinner first, you animal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cKeep him in check, Anya.\u201d Molly squeezed her shoulder before continuing to dole out the plates. </p><p>\u201cSee? She agrees with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mum, of course she agrees with you.\u201d</p><p>Charlie and Anya made their way over to Bill and Fleur, where Fleur and Anya entered deep conversation over Bill\u2019s days in Hogwarts.</p><p>\u201cI had the biggest crush on your husband when I was twelve years old!\u201d Anya elbowed Bill in the ribs playfully.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t \u2018ave one now!\u201d Fleur retorted.</p><p>\u201cAh no, I think I ended up liking someone else a whole lot more.\u201d Anya shot a glance at Charlie who turned the same color as his hair.</p><p>They were interrupted by George, who cleared his throat and stood. Angelina and Lee, who\u2019d been by his side most of the night, shushed the others. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite know what to say, but I know I\u2019ve got to say something. My best friend is gone. And a part of me is missing.\u201d George took a moment to breathe, while everyone in the room started to choke back tears. \u201cFred knew this was a possibility. We all did. But he fought because it was right. And I know he doesn\u2019t regret it for a second. He\u2019d hate to see us crying over him, but what else are we supposed to do when the light in the room is gone? I- we- have to take it one day at a time. But I want to toast him for now, I want to celebrate him. To Fred.\u201d George raises his glass. </p><p>\u201cTo Fred.\u201d</p>",

The worst day many of them had ever come to know. Today was the day they buried Fred. </p><p>The air was thick that May morning and the Burrow was silent. It was Molly who insisted on burying Fred in the back. She never wanted to be far from him again. This was the first time so many of the Order had reunited since the craziness of the previous year. Only this time, they were down a few numbers. Mad-Eye, then Tonks, Lupin, and Fred. It was as if the light that formerly blazed brightly had been stifled, choked out. Where did they go from here?</p><p>Molly was busying herself cooking after the burial. Arthur tried stopping her, but she refused. She needed to get her mind off things; she needed someone to take care of. Thankfully, she had a house full of people, with more trickling in as time went on. </p><p>Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione were distracting themselves with little Teddy. Andromeda brought him to pay her respects to the young man who fought with her daughter for a better future for her grandson. Andromeda was currently helping Molly with the meal preparations, also grateful for the distraction. </p><p>\u201cHow does it feel to be a godfather, Harry?\u201d Hermione asked as she let the month old baby grab her finger.</p><p>\u201cA bit strange. I\u2019m partially responsible for this tiny person but I\u2019m-\u201d Harry stopped when he realized Ginny and Ron had started softly crying again. Ron reached for his sister\u2019s hand, which she gave him, squeezing his own. Hermione brought her forehead to Ron\u2019s shoulder and grasped his other hand while Harry shifted Teddy to his other arm, slipping his free hand into Ginny\u2019s vacant hand. </p><p>As they sat in quiet grief, another visitor arrived at the Burrow. She cautiously entered the house and looked around. Harry didn\u2019t recognize her, but his observation of her was noticed by those near him, who also looked up.</p><p>Ron rubbed his eyes, \u201cBlimey Gin, is that her?\u201d</p><p>Ginny squinted, \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen her in years, have we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was at Bill\u2019s wedding before\u2026 everything that happened. But I didn\u2019t expect to see her here. Charlie said she was in the Netherlands.\u201d Harry and Hermione looked at each other with raised eyebrows as Ron spoke of the mystery woman. Before they could ask who she was, it seemed Molly had taken notice of her.</p><p>\u201cOh darling, my darling girl.\u201d Molly ran to her and embraced her in a hug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you Mrs. Weasley.\u201d The woman wrapped her arms around the older woman.</p><p>\u201cFor the last time, I\u2019m Molly. Or Mom, whichever you prefer.\u201d The unknown woman blushed bright red, leaving Harry and Hermione confused.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Harry asked. </p><p>\u201cCharlie\u2019s old girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought Charlie dated anyone.\u201d Hermione posed quizzically.</p><p>\u201cJust her. They went to Hogwarts together. She\u2019s a friend of Bill\u2019s too.\u201d Ron watched his mother call after the rest of their family to greet her.</p><p>\u201cShe seems pretty close with your family. How come we\u2019ve never met her before?\u201d Harry was thankful for her arrival; it gave them something to do besides thinking of the unimaginable horror they experienced just a week ago. The woman was now being greeted by Arthur, Percy, and George.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working in Holland. She\u2019s researching cultural differences between different wizarding communities.\u201d Ginny looked at Ron. \u201cWe should probably go say hi.\u201d The two begrudgingly stood, leaving Harry and Hermione alone with Teddy.</p><p>\u201cI guess we ought to stay put.\u201d Harry posited as the two watched the woman greet Ginny and Ron. </p><p>\u201cLook at you! You\u2019re all grown up.\u201d She gave them a sad smile. \u201cI hear that your whole family played a part in defeating Voldemort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d Ron shuffled, unsure on how to continue the conversation on such a heavy topic without opening the fresh wound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been prouder to know you all. What you\u2019ve done is amazing.\u201d As she spoke, Bill and Charlie ambled up.</p><p>\u201cAnya?\u201d Charlie half-whispered. When she met his eye, she flushed and nearly threw herself on him. The two were wrapped around each other as if their lives\u2019 depended on it, while everyone else watched. They quietly whispered to each other during their embrace when finally Bill cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you too, Anya.\u201d Anya pulled away from Charlie, reddening a bit, and hugged Bill. </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s alright. I know where I stand with you two.\u201d Bill tried his best to smile before calling over his wife to greet his old friend. </p><p>As Anya spoke to the Weasleys, Harry watched her face shift. \u201cHe\u2019s here?\u201d </p><p>Harry saw Charlie point in his direction and Harry felt overwhelmed. Sure he was used to the stares and comments at this point, but he didn\u2019t feel comfortable receiving that kind of attention at his friend\u2019s funeral. As Anya walked over, Harry\u2019s stomach turned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s Harry, right?\u201d She asked delicately.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan I hold him?\u201d Only then did Harry realize she was talking about Teddy. </p><p>\u201cOh, uh, of course.\u201d Harry gingerly handed her the infant.</p><p>\u201cHe looks just like her.\u201d Anya delicately dragged a finger along his face. \u201cHis name is Edward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we call him Teddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there, Teddy.\u201d Anya sat down as she whispered to the baby. Charlie sat next to her. \u201cYour mother was a very good friend of mine. She was a wonderful woman.\u201d Harry noticed Anya was choking back tears, also noticing when Charlie began to rub her back to comfort her. Anya looked back at Harry, \u201cYou\u2019re the godfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm, yes. His dad- Remus- was one of my dad\u2019s best friends.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss.\u201d Anya gave him a sad smile.</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d was all Harry could bring himself to say without crying.</p><p>\u201cHarry is Ginny\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d Charlie nudged Anya. \u201cAnd Hermione over here,\u201d only then did Harry realize how quiet she\u2019d been, \u201cis Ron\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d Hermione blushed scarlet upon the description. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard an awful lot about the two of you from Charlie and Bill.\u201d Anya spoke to them but her eyes kept darting back to Teddy.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Hermione said with a tone of surprise. </p><p>\u201cYeah, really?\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t help but blurt out. He\u2019d only met Charlie a handful of times and was never too close with Bill either. It shocked him that either of them would mention him to a total stranger.</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s not everyday your siblings meet the Chosen One and the brightest witch of her age.\u201d Charlie winked at the two. \u201cOr get dragged into breaking about fifty school rules with them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t break just as many rules back in our day.\u201d Anya chided jokingly. </p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow. He knew Charlie had been a prefect, and pretty well-behaved from what he\u2019d heard, aside from his dangerous fascination with magical creatures.</p><p>\u201cAt least I wasn\u2019t Head Boy like Bill!\u201d Charlie turned his attention back to Hermione and Harry. \u201cThis girl could\u2019ve gotten us expelled more times than I can count.\u201d</p><p>The lighter mood was broken when Teddy started to cry, reminding everyone of the gravity of their circumstances. Andromeda hurried over to take him off Anya\u2019s hands, greeting her with a hug in the process.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, dear girl?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well, Mrs. Tonks, thank you. Your grandson is absolutely beautiful.\u201d Anya placed a light kiss on Teddy\u2019s forehead before she handed him back to his grandmother. </p><p>\u201cHe keeps me young. Thankfully, I\u2019ve got Harry to help out with him.\u201d Andromeda had returned with a bottle of milk, which she placed in Teddy\u2019s mouth. </p><p>\u201cI can take him if you need to go back to the kitchen.\u201d Hermione reached for the baby and Andromeda obliged.</p><p>\u201cThe food will be about twenty more minutes.\u201d And hurried back.</p><p>\u201cRowan wanted to come but she wasn\u2019t able to get back in time. She sends her regards.\u201d Anya turned to Charlie. \u201cHave you heard from the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Barnaby was here earlier but he had to leave. The rest sent owls. I guess we\u2019ll see them later this week.\u201d Harry wondered what was happening later this week before realizing Charlie had gone to school with Tonks- and Tonks and Lupin\u2019s joint funeral was that next Tuesday. He felt his stomach churn.</p><p>Anya carefully turned to Charlie. \u201cWould you mind if I- if I went outside to- to say goodbye?\u201d Charlie nodded and stood. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go with me, it\u2019s fine-\u201d </p><p>Charlie silently grabbed her hand and escorted her to the backyard. As he did, Ginny and Ron finally returned.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the two of them going? To snog?\u201d Ron made his best attempt at a joke, realizing the actual situation when it was too late. </p><p>\u201cSo, Anya is her name?\u201d Hermione asked, holding Teddy\u2019s bottle. Ron nodded and she continued. \u201cAnd she used to date Charlie? As in, they\u2019re not together anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d Ginny sat back down next to Harry and rested her head on shoulder. </p><p>\u201cCharlie doesn\u2019t talk about it much, at least not with us. Bill probably knows loads more.\u201d Ron absentmindedly rubbed Teddy\u2019s tiny arm. </p><p>\u201cIt seems like they still love each other.\u201d Ginny continued. \u201cBut they love their work too. And that puts them in different places a lot of the time. It\u2019s hard to be together when you\u2019re on opposite sides of the continent.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey graduated right before we started Hogwarts. So she went to school with Bill, Charlie, Percy, George, and\u2026 Fred.\u201d Ron winced while saying his name. \u201cWe only know her from summer visits and all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe seems\u2026 kind.\u201d Hermione was careful not to move as Teddy had just fallen asleep.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s pretty alright.\u201d </p><p>-</p><p>Dinner was served and Anya and Charlie made their way back inside. Their eyes were bloodshot but Anya tried to smile regardless. </p><p>\u201cThe food looks excellent, Molly.\u201d Anya handed Charlie a plate before grabbing her own. \u201cOh, and I almost forgot!\u201d Anya ran back to the living room where she\u2019d dropped off her back, returning with a metal tin. \u201cI made cookies. They\u2019re called stroopwafels, they\u2019re a Dutch cookie.\u201d</p><p>Charlie immediately reached for a cookie, \u201cGod, I miss your baking.\u201d </p><p>Anya smacked his hand away, \u201cEat your dinner first, you animal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cKeep him in check, Anya.\u201d Molly squeezed her shoulder before continuing to dole out the plates. </p><p>\u201cSee? She agrees with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mum, of course she agrees with you.\u201d</p><p>Charlie and Anya made their way over to Bill and Fleur, where Fleur and Anya entered deep conversation over Bill\u2019s days in Hogwarts.</p><p>\u201cI had the biggest crush on your husband when I was twelve years old!\u201d Anya elbowed Bill in the ribs playfully.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t \u2018ave one now!\u201d Fleur retorted.</p><p>\u201cAh no, I think I ended up liking someone else a whole lot more.\u201d Anya shot a glance at Charlie who turned the same color as his hair.</p><p>They were interrupted by George, who cleared his throat and stood. Angelina and Lee, who\u2019d been by his side most of the night, shushed the others. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite know what to say, but I know I\u2019ve got to say something. My best friend is gone. And a part of me is missing.\u201d George took a moment to breathe, while everyone in the room started to choke back tears. \u201cFred knew this was a possibility. We all did. But he fought because it was right. And I know he doesn\u2019t regret it for a second.

It&rsquo;s not everyday your siblings meet the Chosen One and the brightest witch of her age.&rdquo; Charlie winked at the two. &ldquo;Or get dragged into breaking about fifty school rules with them.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act like you didn&rsquo;t break just as many rules back in our day.&rdquo; Anya chided jokingly. </p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow. He knew Charlie had been a prefect, and pretty well-behaved from what he&rsquo;d heard, aside from his dangerous fascination with magical creatures.</p><p>&ldquo;At least I wasn&rsquo;t Head Boy like Bill!&rdquo; Charlie turned his attention back to Hermione and Harry. &ldquo;This girl could&rsquo;ve gotten us expelled more times than I can count.&rdquo;</p><p>The lighter mood was broken when Teddy started to cry, reminding everyone of the gravity of their circumstances. Andromeda hurried over to take him off Anya&rsquo;s hands, greeting her with a hug in the process.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you, dear girl?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m well, Mrs. Tonks, thank you. Your grandson is absolutely beautiful.&rdquo; Anya placed a light kiss on Teddy&rsquo;s forehead before she handed him back to his grandmother. </p><p>&ldquo;He keeps me young. Thankfully, I&rsquo;ve got Harry to help out with him.&rdquo; Andromeda had returned with a bottle of milk, which she placed in Teddy&rsquo;s mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;I can take him if you need to go back to the kitchen.&rdquo; Hermione reached for the baby and Andromeda obliged.</p><p>&ldquo;The food will be about twenty more minutes.&rdquo; And hurried back.</p><p>&ldquo;Rowan wanted to come but she wasn&rsquo;t able to get back in time. She sends her regards.&rdquo; Anya turned to Charlie. &ldquo;Have you heard from the others?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Barnaby was here earlier but he had to leave. The rest sent owls. I guess we&rsquo;ll see them later this week.&rdquo; Harry wondered what was happening later this week before realizing Charlie had gone to school with Tonks- and Tonks and Lupin&rsquo;s joint funeral was that next Tuesday. He felt his stomach churn.</p><p>Anya carefully turned to Charlie. &ldquo;Would you mind if I- if I went outside to- to say goodbye?&rdquo; Charlie nodded and stood. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go with me, it&rsquo;s fine-&rdquo; </p><p>Charlie silently grabbed her hand and escorted her to the backyard. As he did, Ginny and Ron finally returned.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are the two of them going? To snog?&rdquo; Ron made his best attempt at a joke, realizing the actual situation when it was too late. </p><p>&ldquo;So, Anya is her name?&rdquo; Hermione asked, holding Teddy&rsquo;s bottle. Ron nodded and she continued. &ldquo;And she used to date Charlie? As in, they&rsquo;re not together anymore?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated.&rdquo; Ginny sat back down next to Harry and rested her head on shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Charlie doesn&rsquo;t talk about it much, at least not with us. Bill probably knows loads more.&rdquo; Ron absentmindedly rubbed Teddy&rsquo;s tiny arm. </p><p>&ldquo;It seems like they still love each other.&rdquo; Ginny continued. &ldquo;But they love their work too. And that puts them in different places a lot of the time. It&rsquo;s hard to be together when you&rsquo;re on opposite sides of the continent.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;They graduated right before we started Hogwarts. So she went to school with Bill, Charlie, Percy, George, and&hellip; Fred.&rdquo; Ron winced while saying his name. &ldquo;We only know her from summer visits and all.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;She seems&hellip; kind.&rdquo; Hermione was careful not to move as Teddy had just fallen asleep.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s pretty alright.&rdquo; </p><p>-</p><p>Dinner was served and Anya and Charlie made their way back inside. Their eyes were bloodshot but Anya tried to smile regardless. </p><p>&ldquo;The food looks excellent, Molly.&rdquo; Anya handed Charlie a plate before grabbing her own. &ldquo;Oh, and I almost forgot!&rdquo; Anya ran back to the living room where she&rsquo;d dropped off her back, returning with a metal tin. &ldquo;I made cookies. They&rsquo;re called stroopwafels, they&rsquo;re a Dutch cookie.&rdquo;</p><p>Charlie immediately reached for a cookie, &ldquo;God, I miss your baking.&rdquo; </p><p>Anya smacked his hand away, &ldquo;Eat your dinner first, you animal.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Keep him in check, Anya.&rdquo; Molly squeezed her shoulder before continuing to dole out the plates. </p><p>&ldquo;See? She agrees with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my mum, of course she agrees with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Charlie and Anya made their way over to Bill and Fleur, where Fleur and Anya entered deep conversation over Bill&rsquo;s days in Hogwarts.</p><p>&ldquo;I had the biggest crush on your husband when I was twelve years old!&rdquo; Anya elbowed Bill in the ribs playfully.</p><p>&ldquo;As long as you don&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave one now!&rdquo; Fleur retorted.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah no, I think I ended up liking someone else a whole lot more.&rdquo; Anya shot a glance at Charlie who turned the same color as his hair.</p><p>They were interrupted by George, who cleared his throat and stood. Angelina and Lee, who&rsquo;d been by his side most of the night, shushed the others. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know what to say, but I know I&rsquo;ve got to say something. My best friend is gone. And a part of me is missing.&rdquo; George took a moment to breathe, while everyone in the room started to choke back tears. &ldquo;Fred knew this was a possibility. We all did. But he fought because it was right. And I know he doesn&rsquo;t regret it for a second. He&rsquo;d hate to see us crying over him, but what else are we supposed to do when the light in the room is gone? I- we- have to take it one day at a time. But I want to toast him for now, I want to celebrate him. To Fred.&rdquo; George raises his glass. </p><p>&ldquo;To Fred.&rdquo;</p></p>",
