Her robotic hand is clamped around his wrist, a vice holding him in place, preventing him from throwing himself into sheer destruction. In a way, he&rsquo;s thankful for her presence. There&rsquo;s a truth to her words - any one person would be unable to take on the monstrosity that is Thanos on their own. </p><p>But perhaps that isn&rsquo;t the case for an entire team of heroes.</p><p>Tony looks behind him, past Nebula, surveying the damage. All of his remaining comrades are there. Natasha and Bruce, along with two Wakandan warriors whose names Tony didn&rsquo;t have enough time to catch, are motionless on the ground, possibly only lacking consciousness, but more likely dead, to which Tony silently hopes for the former. Only Steve, Thor, Rhodey, and of course Nebula remain, the men incapacitated by harsh wounds. Nebula is strong enough to stand, at least, but the mechanical parts of her body are contorted in ways they shouldn&rsquo;t be, her limbs nearly broken, a large dent glinting off of the metal plate in her head. Tony is weak, barely able to keep his aching body moving, but still in better shape than the rest of them, despite the stab wound through his abdomen.</p><p>Tony spins around at the sound of movement coming from his other side.</p><p>There, before him, Thanos is slowly rising to his feet, hand charred to a useless stump by the sheer power of the Infinity Stones and a large axe through his body.</p><p>In that moment Tony makes a split-second decision, one that he knows he&rsquo;ll regret later if he&rsquo;s still alive to.</p><p>He looks behind him once more, his eyes meeting Steve&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s been years since they&rsquo;ve fought alongside each other like this, years since they&rsquo;ve talked to each other, since they&rsquo;ve seen each other. Tony regrets every day of it, and by the look in Steve&rsquo;s eyes, he&rsquo;s not alone. He hasn&rsquo;t even spoken to Steve since they partnered back up to fight this. Another thing to regret in a few moments. A moment of understanding passes between him and his old friend, and it&rsquo;s as if all bad blood is gone, no words spoken, just a look of sheer, complete apology. At the very least, Tony has one moment he doesn&rsquo;t regret. </p><p>Tony wrenches his hand out of Nebula&rsquo;s and launches himself forward.</p><p>He reaches the destroyed metal of the Infinity Gauntlet a moment before Thanos, his fingers scrambling for the green glow of the Time Stone. </p><p>Within seconds the stone is in Tony&rsquo;s grasp and green symbols he doesn&rsquo;t recognize wrap around his wrists. His hands act without him trying, his arms moving with a power he doesn&rsquo;t know, like a language he doesn&rsquo;t understand, only one he&rsquo;s seen Strange use a few times before. Everything freezes momentarily, Thanos&rsquo;s face inches from his own, a look of bloodthirsty anger drawn across it.</p><p>Then everything moves backward with Tony in the middle of it all. </p><p>Minutes go by and the remaining Guardians re-board their ship from Titan with empty space where Tony should be. More time passes, the world spinning in reverse far faster than it should, like watching life in rewind sped up eight times. The ship Tony arrived on is long gone. He watches as all of the destruction in Wakanda repairs itself in the blink of an eye. And then-</p><p>The snap.</p><p>Those who disintegrated into space dust are reformed from the fabric of time in the span of a second. Faces Tony recognizes reappear beside their friends and companions in the fight.</p><p>The Wakandan armies, and those they fought against too.</p><p>Wanda. Sam. Bucky, beside Steve.</p><p>And somehow, like a hole in Tony&rsquo;s heart that was ripped into him on Titan has been been refilled, he knows <i>they&rsquo;re</i> safe. The one who gave his life for him and the one he cares about the most are safe.</p><p>Stephen and Peter are safe, and that&rsquo;s all that matters.</p><p>Tony almost exhales. Almost.</p><p>Thor&rsquo;s axe pulls itself out of Thanos&rsquo;s body.</p><p>As soon as he realizes what&rsquo;s going on, Thanos breaks into Tony&rsquo;s rewind and the whole thing shatters, time resuming from the point seconds before the snap. Thanos moves for the green crystal in Tony&rsquo;s possession.</p><p>Tony planned for this.</p><p>His hands move out of control again. Now comes the part Tony knows he&rsquo;s going to regret.</p><p>Tony Stark locks himself in a time loop with Thanos, something only he can break, effectively dooming himself to be killed over and over again at the hands of Thanos for the rest of time.</p><p>Thanos is enraged beyond all reason and the first few deaths are completely brutal, more painful than anything Tony has ever experienced in his lifetime.

And Peter, well, Peter is drunk.</p><p>Words: 2632, Chapters: 1/1, Language: English</p><ul><li>Fandoms: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe/works\" target=\"_blank\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/The%20Avengers%20(Marvel%20Movies)/works\" target=\"_blank\">The Avengers (Marvel Movies)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Spider-Man%20-%20All%20Media%20Types/works\" target=\"_blank\">Spider-Man - All Media Types</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/The%20Avengers%20(Marvel)%20-%20All%20Media%20Types/works\" target=\"_blank\">The Avengers (Marvel) - All Media Types</a></li><li>Rating: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/General%20Audiences/works\" target=\"_blank\">General Audiences</a></li><li>Warnings: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/No%20Archive%20Warnings%20Apply/works\" target=\"_blank\">No Archive Warnings Apply</a></li><li>Characters: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker/works\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Parker</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Steve%20Rogers/works\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Rogers</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tony%20Stark/works\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Stark</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Ned%20Leeds/works\" target=\"_blank\">Ned Leeds</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/MJ/works\" target=\"_blank\">MJ</a></li><li>Relationships: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker%20*a*%20Tony%20Stark/works\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Parker &amp; Tony Stark</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker%20*a*%20Steve%20Rogers/works\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Parker &amp; Steve Rogers</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker%20*a*%20Steve%20Rogers%20*a*%20Tony%20Stark/works\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Parker &amp; Steve Rogers &amp; Tony Stark</a></li><li>Additional Tags: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker%20is%20a%20Good%20Bro/works\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Parker is a Good Bro</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/but%20he%20wants%20to%20be%20a%20rebel/works\" target=\"_blank\">but he wants to be a rebel</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Teenage%20Rebellion/works\" target=\"_blank\">Teenage Rebellion</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Parent%20Tony%20Stark/works\" target=\"_blank\">Parent Tony Stark</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Parent%20Steve%20Rogers/works\" target=\"_blank\">Parent Steve Rogers</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tony%20Stark%20Acting%20as%20Peter%20Parker's%20Parental%20Figure/works\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Stark Acting as Peter Parker&rsquo;s Parental Figure</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/I%20am%20unhappily%20tagging%20this%20next%20one/works\" target=\"_blank\">I am unhappily tagging this next one</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tony%20Stark%20Has%20A%20Heart/works\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Stark Has A Heart</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/you%20will%20all%20feel%20bad%20when%20Tony%20sacrifices%20himself%20in%20Avengers%204/works\" target=\"_blank\">you will all feel bad when Tony sacrifices himself in Avengers 4</a></li></ul><br /><br />\nread it on the AO3 at <strong><a href=\"https://ift.tt/2KAWhZN\" target=\"_blank\">https://ift.tt/2KAWhZN</a></strong></p>",

Perfectly trimmed and maintained. And although he\nwould never admit it, you knew his facial hair was a point of pride for the\nman. Maybe it had something to do with him always being so much younger than\nhis classmates as a kid, so when everyone else was growing beards he was still\nfighting acne. </p><p>You never questioned how he maintained such perfect facial\nhair, despite the fact that you never saw the man shave. But Tony was up all\nhours, so you figured he just shaved when you were asleep or not around. </p><p>But the longer you lived with Tony Stark the more suspicious\nyou grew\u2026 You checked the cupboards in your shared washroom and found no\nshaving materials. You never saw any small hairs that needed cleaning up,\ndespite not having a maid anymore. And yet\u2026perfectly maintained facial hair\u2026</p><p>One night when Tony and you were watching a movie, you found\nyourself staring at his jaw rather intently. <i>Does it just\u2026not grow? Did he invent some kind of a formula to keep it\nperfect? No, that\u2019s impossible\u2026Is it? I mean\u2026he is Tony Stark?</i></p><p>\u201cHey (Y/N)\u2026\u201d Tony\u2019s voice interrupted your internal spiral.\n\u201cSomething bothering you, or are you just captivated by my handsomeness?\u201d He\nasked, with a smirk. </p><p>\u201cOption three.\u201d You said, deadpan. </p><p>Tony raised an eyebrow and pursed his lips, eyes narrowing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing a thing\u2026a weird thing with your face. What is that face?\u201d He\nasked.</p><p>You slowly stood up, still eyeing the man suspiciously.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the face of someone who\u2019s onto you, Stark\u2026\u201d You replied ominously, before\nwalking away. </p><p>\u201cDramatic exits aside, are we finishing this movie or\u2026?\u201d </p><p>The next day you involved Rhodey in your conspiracy theory. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I have never seen the man shave! I\u2019ve\nnever even seen any evidence of shaving!\u201d You exclaimed to the man. \u201cYou\u2019re his\nbest friend. Don\u2019t guys talk about guy stuff with each other? Has he ever\nmentioned his beard before?\u201d</p><p>Rhodey scratched his jaw, staring down at the floor. \u201cNow\nthat you mention it\u2026no? I mean, I make fun of him for it sometimes because it\u2019s\nquite frankly ridiculous. But he\u2019s never mentioned like a barber or anything.\u201d </p><p>You put your hands over your face, letting out a frustrated\nsigh. This conspiracy was getting wilder. <i>It\nmust go all the way to the top\u2026</i>You thought. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026You\u2019ve got a kind of crazy eyed look going on right\nnow\u2026So\u2026I\u2019m ganna head out\u2026 Don\u2019t uh\u2026like go crazy and murder Tony or something\naight?\u201d He paused, shrugging. \u201cOr do, y\u2019know&hellip;as long as it\u2019s not me.\u201d He\nadded, slowly exiting the room.</p><p>That night you waited until Tony finally came to bed, at\naround 4 am. You pretended to be asleep as he curled around you, and dozed off.\nAnd when you were sure the man was out, you slipped out of bed and snuck down\nto Tony\u2019s lab.</p><p>You used your code to get in, and began looking around for\nsome kind of remnants of a high-tech shaver. Something possibly involving holograms\nand laser grids. </p><p>Mid-search, when half your body was inside a cupboard, you\nwere interrupted by a certain AI. \u201cMight I inquire as to what you are searching\nfor [Ms/Mr] (Y/L/N)?\u201d JARVIS asked.</p><p>You jumped, banging your head against the counter. \u201cJARVIS\u2026\u201d\nYou began, standing up and rubbing the back of your sore head. \u201cDoes Tony have\nany\u2026shaving equipment around here?\u201d You asked, conspiratorially. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s classified.\u201d The AI responded\nquickly\u2026.Too quickly\u2026 </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean classified? I knew something was up!\u201d You\nshouted, running a hand through your hair some-what neurotically. </p><p>\u201cSo the jigs up.\u201d Tony said behind you. </p><p>You turned to see the man leaning against the door frame,\narms crossed. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on Tony?!\u201d You asked. \u201cThis is\ninsane. This is an actual conspiracy! Are you in the Illuminati or something?\u201d\nYou half asked, half accused.</p><p>Tony chuckled, walking over to you and gently placing his\nhands on your shoulders. \u201c(Y/N), sweetie, honey\u2026Calm down. As amusing as\nwatching you go insane has been, I think this has gone a little too far.\u201d </p><p>The man sighed, looking down for a moment before meeting\nyour eyes. \u201cThe truth is, I\u2014OW!\u201d Tony yelped, in reaction to you quickly\ntugging on a piece of his beard. </p><p>\u201cSorry. Had to make sure it wasn\u2019t stick on or something.\u201d\nYou apologized. </p><p>Tony rubbed his sore jaw, shaking his head. \u201cIs it weird\nthat I\u2019m kind of turned on right now?\u201d The man questioned, grinning slightly. </p><p>You looked at the man incredulously. \u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, you\u2019re all crazy eyed and sneaking around\nlike some kind of sexy spy, tugging hair, yelling at me. No? Just me whose\nturned on? Okay, sure.\u201d He rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTony so help me if you don\u2019t tell me what the hell is going\non with you and that beard I will tie you down and shave it off!\u201d You\nthreatened.</p><p>Tony held back a laugh, rubbing your shoulders soothingly.\n\u201cHoney, calm down. No need to resort to sexy threats.\u201d He said, calmly. \u201cThe\ntruth is, I made a laser-based program operated through JARVIS that gives me\nthe closest shave possible. He runs it everyday when I come down to the lab to\nkeep the lines clean. Razor bumps are a thing of the past.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut\u2026.if that\u2019s all\u2026.Why all the secrecy? When you realized\nI was asking questions why didn\u2019t you just tell me!?\u201d You asked, utterly\nconfused.</p><p>Tony pulled you into a tight hug, rubbing your back\nsoothingly. \u201cBecause (Y/N)\u2026\u201d He whispered in your ear. \u201cI live to torment you.\u201d\n</p><p>You gasped, pulling back and slapping Tony\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\nasshole!\u201d You shouted. \u201cI thought I was going insane!\u201d</p><p>Tony only laughed, trying to pull you back into his embrace.\n\u201cAww, come on my little superspy\u2026Investigate me some more.\u201d He teased. \u201cTry and\nfind out all my dirty little secrets.\u201d He winked. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d You groaned, begrudgingly letting the\nman kiss you softly. </p><p>\u201cCome back to bed, Sherlock Holmes.\u201d Tony smiled, holding\nyour hand and leading you back to your bedroom. </p><p>Even as the two of you got into bed, you were still pouting.\n\u201cI hate you.\u201d You muttered, as Tony wrapped his arms around you.</p><p>\u201cI know, honey, I know.\u201d He whispered, cuddling you closely\u2026</p><p><i>The End.</i></p><hr><p>\n\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3CsTvSzu7Bm9Ac_fPn0U2g\">@captainsherlockwinchester110283</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\">@lilylovelyxo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIWJ6ijHZJcEM-YIF59_Pw\">@not-reptilian</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m76mRZjFU5Yp4Yk46kf_BFA\">@thevanishedillusion</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mte-5Jm2i9Zikyw_9Upx3UA\">@kilamanjiro</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAH7GvmnqLLaX9LesHCd17Q\">@xxcxrolinexx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp51EbMXiQF89KF9wmaofdA\">@txnystarkimagines</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS9-LI9kDmgffTYO1m4ntew\">@broadwayandnetflix</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZei9UpBnkmXbD2HCt_xnNw\">@mythrealfan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFRUouye0_OsVJIe6hzG1Rg\">@sophiatomlinson23</a>\n\n<br/></p>",

Perfectly trimmed and maintained. And although he\nwould never admit it, you knew his facial hair was a point of pride for the\nman. Maybe it had something to do with him always being so much younger than\nhis classmates as a kid, so when everyone else was growing beards he was still\nfighting acne. </p><p>You never questioned how he maintained such perfect facial\nhair, despite the fact that you never saw the man shave. But Tony was up all\nhours, so you figured he just shaved when you were asleep or not around. </p><p>But the longer you lived with Tony Stark the more suspicious\nyou grew&hellip; You checked the cupboards in your shared washroom and found no\nshaving materials. You never saw any small hairs that needed cleaning up,\ndespite not having a maid anymore. And yet&hellip;perfectly maintained facial hair&hellip;</p><p>One night when Tony and you were watching a movie, you found\nyourself staring at his jaw rather intently. <i>Does it just&hellip;not grow? Did he invent some kind of a formula to keep it\nperfect? No, that&rsquo;s impossible&hellip;Is it? I mean&hellip;he is Tony Stark?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Hey (Y/N)&hellip;&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice interrupted your internal spiral.\n&ldquo;Something bothering you, or are you just captivated by my handsomeness?&rdquo; He\nasked, with a smirk. </p><p>&ldquo;Option three.&rdquo; You said, deadpan. </p><p>Tony raised an eyebrow and pursed his lips, eyes narrowing.\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing a thing&hellip;a weird thing with your face. What is that face?&rdquo; He\nasked.</p><p>You slowly stood up, still eyeing the man suspiciously.\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the face of someone who&rsquo;s onto you, Stark&hellip;&rdquo; You replied ominously, before\nwalking away. </p><p>&ldquo;Dramatic exits aside, are we finishing this movie or&hellip;?&rdquo; </p><p>The next day you involved Rhodey in your conspiracy theory. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you, I have never seen the man shave! I&rsquo;ve\nnever even seen any evidence of shaving!&rdquo; You exclaimed to the man. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re his\nbest friend. Don&rsquo;t guys talk about guy stuff with each other? Has he ever\nmentioned his beard before?&rdquo;</p><p>Rhodey scratched his jaw, staring down at the floor. &ldquo;Now\nthat you mention it&hellip;no? I mean, I make fun of him for it sometimes because it&rsquo;s\nquite frankly ridiculous. But he&rsquo;s never mentioned like a barber or anything.&rdquo; </p><p>You put your hands over your face, letting out a frustrated\nsigh. This conspiracy was getting wilder. <i>It\nmust go all the way to the top&hellip;</i>You thought. </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)&hellip;You&rsquo;ve got a kind of crazy eyed look going on right\nnow&hellip;So&hellip;I&rsquo;m ganna head out&hellip; Don&rsquo;t uh&hellip;like go crazy and murder Tony or something\naight?&rdquo; He paused, shrugging. &ldquo;Or do, y&rsquo;know&hellip;as long as it&rsquo;s not me.&rdquo; He\nadded, slowly exiting the room.</p><p>That night you waited until Tony finally came to bed, at\naround 4 am. You pretended to be asleep as he curled around you, and dozed off.\nAnd when you were sure the man was out, you slipped out of bed and snuck down\nto Tony&rsquo;s lab.</p><p>You used your code to get in, and began looking around for\nsome kind of remnants of a high-tech shaver. Something possibly involving holograms\nand laser grids. </p><p>Mid-search, when half your body was inside a cupboard, you\nwere interrupted by a certain AI. &ldquo;Might I inquire as to what you are searching\nfor [Ms/Mr] (Y/L/N)?&rdquo; JARVIS asked.</p><p>You jumped, banging your head against the counter. &ldquo;JARVIS&hellip;&rdquo;\nYou began, standing up and rubbing the back of your sore head. &ldquo;Does Tony have\nany&hellip;shaving equipment around here?&rdquo; You asked, conspiratorially. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s classified.&rdquo; The AI responded\nquickly&hellip;.Too quickly&hellip; </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean classified? I knew something was up!&rdquo; You\nshouted, running a hand through your hair some-what neurotically. </p><p>&ldquo;So the jigs up.&rdquo; Tony said behind you. </p><p>You turned to see the man leaning against the door frame,\narms crossed. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell is going on Tony?!&rdquo; You asked. &ldquo;This is\ninsane. This is an actual conspiracy! Are you in the Illuminati or something?&rdquo;\nYou half asked, half accused.</p><p>Tony chuckled, walking over to you and gently placing his\nhands on your shoulders. &ldquo;(Y/N), sweetie, honey&hellip;Calm down. As amusing as\nwatching you go insane has been, I think this has gone a little too far.&rdquo; </p><p>The man sighed, looking down for a moment before meeting\nyour eyes. &ldquo;The truth is, I&mdash;OW!&rdquo; Tony yelped, in reaction to you quickly\ntugging on a piece of his beard. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry. Had to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t stick on or something.&rdquo;\nYou apologized. </p><p>Tony rubbed his sore jaw, shaking his head. &ldquo;Is it weird\nthat I&rsquo;m kind of turned on right now?&rdquo; The man questioned, grinning slightly. </p><p>You looked at the man incredulously. &ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, you&rsquo;re all crazy eyed and sneaking around\nlike some kind of sexy spy, tugging hair, yelling at me. No? Just me whose\nturned on? Okay, sure.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony so help me if you don&rsquo;t tell me what the hell is going\non with you and that beard I will tie you down and shave it off!&rdquo; You\nthreatened.</p><p>Tony held back a laugh, rubbing your shoulders soothingly.\n&ldquo;Honey, calm down. No need to resort to sexy threats.&rdquo; He said, calmly. &ldquo;The\ntruth is, I made a laser-based program operated through JARVIS that gives me\nthe closest shave possible. He runs it everyday when I come down to the lab to\nkeep the lines clean. Razor bumps are a thing of the past.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;.if that&rsquo;s all&hellip;.Why all the secrecy?
