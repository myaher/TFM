Sitting in a lecture during a heatwave, listening to your boring professor drone on about everything you&rsquo;ve heard before wasn&rsquo;t your ideal Monday afternoon.</p><p>However, your college situation wasn&rsquo;t the only situation on your mind. Your mind wandered to the tall, dark haired man that currently sat at your apartment. He was probably trying to figure out how to use the oven, or how to make a cup of tea by himself. </p><p>You and Loki had met by pure chance a few weeks ago, and he claimed the two of you were &lsquo;soul mates&rsquo; and that you were meant to be together. His claims then led to him deciding to move in with you. At first you resented the idea, and you resented him, but after a week or two, you realised that maybe he wasn&rsquo;t so bad.</p><p>During class you often found your mind wandering to Loki. You couldn&rsquo;t help it, but every so often you would lose focus and think about him. You would think about his hair, his eyes, his silky smooth voice. You weren&rsquo;t exactly sure why he was always on your mind, but you could take a few guesses.</p><p>Finally, the bell rang, and you were able to leave class. You grabbed your books and pens, shoving them into your bag quickly, then left the classroom. You walked out into the hallway and pulled out your phone. </p><p>You dialled the number of the phone you gave Loki, and after a few seconds he picked up. You smiled a little, &ldquo;Hey. Do you wanna meet me after my classes?&rdquo;</p><p>He hesitated for a few seconds, &ldquo;I could&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>You frowned, &ldquo;Loki, is everything alright? Where are you now?&rdquo;</p><p>He gave a little chuckle, &ldquo;Closer than you think.&rdquo;</p><p>You hung up and furrowed your eyebrows, wondering where the hell Loki could be. However, your question as to where Loki was was soon answered, when you felt something, or someone poke your side.</p><p>You jumped, and turned quickly to be met with the face of Loki. Your eyes widened, &ldquo;Loki, what are you doing here?!&rdquo;</p><p>He gave you a small smile, &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come and surprise you.&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head and grabbed his hand, pulling him into a closet just down the hallway. You sighed, &ldquo;Loki, you can&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;</p><p>He frowned, &ldquo;I was just attempting to court you.&rdquo;</p><p>You bit your lip. You felt bad for telling him that he couldn&rsquo;t be here. You sighed, &ldquo;Look, I appreciate your, uh&hellip;.courting. It&rsquo;s a lovely gesture, Loki. But you can&rsquo;t show up here dressed like that.&rdquo; You gestured to his Asgardian clothing.</p><p>Loki nodded, &ldquo;I do apologise.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled a little, &ldquo;You know what, it&rsquo;s fine. Do you wanna get out of here? I&rsquo;m so fed up already, I need a break.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki nodded, &ldquo;I would love that.&rdquo; He took your hand and led you out of the small closet, and the two of you made your way to the doors of the college. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>A few weeks had passed since Loki had turned up at your college and taken you out, and you two had been getting on better than ever. </p><p>Loki dragged you down the street, and you giggled quietly, \u201cWhere are you taking me, Loki?\u201d</p><p>Loki smiled and continued pulling you, \u201cJust follow me.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and nodded, \u201cWell, I am following you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Loki gave you a grin, and stopped walking. You furrowed your eyebrows when you realised where you were; in front of a shabby food truck.</p><p>Loki smiled, \u201cDo you like it? I spoke to the man or iron about the most romantic places to take women on a date, and he said that this food truck is the most romantic venue in New York.\u201d</p><p>You giggled, \u201cLoki, as much as I appreciate you and all the effort you go to for me, this,\u201d you gestured to the food truck, \u201cisn\u2019t the most romantic. It seems that maybe Tony lied to you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, \u201cI should have known. We can go home if you\u2019d like?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cNo, no it\u2019s fine.

Looking up to the blank ceiling of your bedroom with your back nuzzled into the comfort of your bed. You felt anything but comfort. </p><p>You were currently wide awake in the early hours of the morning, waiting anxiously for your best friend, Peter Parker, to come back after his night of taking on the persona of Spiderman. It had been almost a tradition, a couple times a week he would come over to your place to avoid Aunt May\u2019s questions of his whereabouts, going off to then come back and stay the night.</p><p>Undoubtedly, like most nights, he was out there saving someone&rsquo;s life and bringing a sense of safety to the streets of Queens. A soft sigh escapes your parted lips as you attempt to divert your mind from the haunting thoughts of Peter possibly being hurt. He was usually back by this time, but alas, he was nowhere in your line of sight. </p><p>You knew he was always safe, keeping things within his limits and always looking back cautiously. He would always continuously reassure you every night, a smile laced on his lips as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back (Y/N), I promise.\u201d</p><p>And as much as you trusted him, there was always that \u2018what if\u2019 present in your mind. Not being able to imagine a world where you didn\u2019t get to see a soft smile grace his face. </p><p>You often wondered if he ever thought about you in this way. Did he hang on to every word that left your lips? Did he wake up every day with a small smile knowing that he would see you? Did he always want to make you happy? </p><p>You prayed day and night that these were the thoughts that would run in his mind. Because they continued to linger in yours. </p><p>A small, sudden knock on the glass of your window snapped you from your pressing thoughts. Sliding off of your bed and walking over to let your superhero best friend in. A breath of relief leaves your chest as you scan over his body, noticing no physical injuries. </p><p>Snapping open the lock, you slowly push the window frame up, the cold air of the night slipping in as well as Peter. He closes the window back down for you, walking a couple steps away and sliding off the mask to let his skin breathe. He scrunches his nose up at the feeling of the air on his skin, running a hand through his messy curls before turning back to face you with soft eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry (Y/N) I got caught up in some stuff. You didn\u2019t need to wait for me,\u201d he apologises.</p><p>You shake your head, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, your lucky I don\u2019t mind giving up my beauty sleep for you Parker,\u201d you joke making him smile.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it,\u201d he responds genuinely. </p><p>A smile reaches your lips as you sit cross-legged on your bed, looking up at Peter who starts to slip out of the spider suit. You divert your eyes when more of his chest is revealed, as much as you convinced yourself you only looked away for his privacy, it was more for him not to see the redness of your cheeks. </p><p>\u201cSo, anything new tonight?\u201d you ask as he grabs his clothes out of the backpack he left on the floor of your room. </p><p>He hums in thought, \u201cNo, not really, though there were literally two robberies going on at the same time. I thought I might not make it to one but hey I\u2019m just that amazing,\u201d he boasts playfully.</p><p>You laugh at his response, \u201cThank goodness for that,\u201d when you look back at him he is fully dressed. </p><p>\u201cOh and I helped that nice old lady who gave me that churro last time, and you\u2019ll never guess, but she gave me another churro,\u201d he smiled proudly.</p><p>\u201cShe must prepare them just for you huh?\u201d you reply.</p><p>He shrugs, \u201cMaybe, but next time I do get one, i\u2019ll be sure to save it for you.\u201d</p><p>Your heart fluttered lightly at his words, eyes diverting to your hands in thought. Peter takes note of your silence, sitting down on your bed next to you. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N), is there something wrong?\u201d he questions, concern prominent in his tone. </p><p>You shake your head softly, \u201cNo-well, I don\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re here, you go out there and risk your life and I worry that you won\u2019t come back sometimes,\u201d you admit. </p><p>Peter frowns at your confession, his hand coming up to rest on your shoulder, \u201cHey, you don\u2019t need to worry about me okay. I\u2019m always trying to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that Peter, but, you can\u2019t guarantee anything. l can\u2019t help it, I can\u2019t help but care,\u201d you respond softly, refusing to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to cause you any worry (Y/N),\u201d he answers solemnly. </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you feel the same way if it was me?\u201d you felt like when you asked him this, you were really trying to answer something else. </p><p>He is silent, stumped, he hadn\u2019t really thought about it before but the answer seemed so incredibly obvious. He cared, he couldn\u2019t help but care about you as well. For more reasons than one that you weren\u2019t aware of. </p><p>He nods, \u201cOf course I would.\u201d</p><p>A weight seemed to lift off of your chest, making your head lift up. His chocolate coloured eyes gazed at your face in silence, you wondered desperately about what he was thinking about. </p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop caring,\u201d the confession left your lips and suddenly his eyes were opened to something he had tried to suppress for a long time.

He places his chin a top of your head before pressing his lips to it, kissing your head softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever will either.\u201d</p>",

A breath of relief leaves your chest as you scan over his body, noticing no physical injuries. </p><p>Snapping open the lock, you slowly push the window frame up, the cold air of the night slipping in as well as Peter. He closes the window back down for you, walking a couple steps away and sliding off the mask to let his skin breathe. He scrunches his nose up at the feeling of the air on his skin, running a hand through his messy curls before turning back to face you with soft eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry (Y/N) I got caught up in some stuff. You didn&rsquo;t need to wait for me,&rdquo; he apologises.</p><p>You shake your head, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, your lucky I don&rsquo;t mind giving up my beauty sleep for you Parker,&rdquo; you joke making him smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I appreciate it,&rdquo; he responds genuinely. </p><p>A smile reaches your lips as you sit cross-legged on your bed, looking up at Peter who starts to slip out of the spider suit. You divert your eyes when more of his chest is revealed, as much as you convinced yourself you only looked away for his privacy, it was more for him not to see the redness of your cheeks. </p><p>&ldquo;So, anything new tonight?&rdquo; you ask as he grabs his clothes out of the backpack he left on the floor of your room. </p><p>He hums in thought, &ldquo;No, not really, though there were literally two robberies going on at the same time. I thought I might not make it to one but hey I&rsquo;m just that amazing,&rdquo; he boasts playfully.</p><p>You laugh at his response, &ldquo;Thank goodness for that,&rdquo; when you look back at him he is fully dressed. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh and I helped that nice old lady who gave me that churro last time, and you&rsquo;ll never guess, but she gave me another churro,&rdquo; he smiled proudly.</p><p>&ldquo;She must prepare them just for you huh?&rdquo; you reply.</p><p>He shrugs, &ldquo;Maybe, but next time I do get one, i&rsquo;ll be sure to save it for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Your heart fluttered lightly at his words, eyes diverting to your hands in thought. Peter takes note of your silence, sitting down on your bed next to you. </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N), is there something wrong?&rdquo; he questions, concern prominent in his tone. </p><p>You shake your head softly, &ldquo;No-well, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; I&rsquo;m just glad you&rsquo;re here, you go out there and risk your life and I worry that you won&rsquo;t come back sometimes,&rdquo; you admit. </p><p>Peter frowns at your confession, his hand coming up to rest on your shoulder, &ldquo;Hey, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about me okay. I&rsquo;m always trying to be careful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that Peter, but, you can&rsquo;t guarantee anything. l can&rsquo;t help it, I can&rsquo;t help but care,&rdquo; you respond softly, refusing to meet his gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t want to cause you any worry (Y/N),&rdquo; he answers solemnly. </p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you feel the same way if it was me?&rdquo; you felt like when you asked him this, you were really trying to answer something else. </p><p>He is silent, stumped, he hadn&rsquo;t really thought about it before but the answer seemed so incredibly obvious. He cared, he couldn&rsquo;t help but care about you as well. For more reasons than one that you weren&rsquo;t aware of. </p><p>He nods, &ldquo;Of course I would.&rdquo;</p><p>A weight seemed to lift off of your chest, making your head lift up. His chocolate coloured eyes gazed at your face in silence, you wondered desperately about what he was thinking about. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever stop caring,&rdquo; the confession left your lips and suddenly his eyes were opened to something he had tried to suppress for a long time. Gently, he pulled your body into his chest, wrapping his arms around you in a warm embrace, you are stunned at his sudden affection but don&rsquo;t deny it.You reciprocate, wrapping your arms around his back. He places his chin a top of your head before pressing his lips to it, kissing your head softly.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever will either.&rdquo;</p>",
