It started with teenage Harry throwing pebbles at his crush&rsquo;s window and getting chased by her father, to 24-year-old Harry picking up the call from the person he&rsquo;d been avoiding for months.</p><p>Though his number one advice to himself had always been: &rsquo;<i>if you&rsquo;re awake at two in the morning, just go to sleep&rsquo;,\u00a0</i>it was still something<i>\u00a0</i>he&rsquo;d never learnt.</p><p>Sitting in the swivel chair by the floor-to-ceiling window, Harry looked out at the city, one hand gripping the phone at his ear, the other subconsciously tapping on his knee. The woman on the phone was waiting for his reply, but what she wanted to hear wasn&rsquo;t what he could give.</p><p><i>&ldquo;H, say something.&rdquo;</i></p><p>A little part of him wanted to end the call and go back to bed where his present and possible future was expecting him, yet there he was, clinging onto the ghost of his past by prolonging that unnecessary conversation that was heading nowhere.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Can I\u2014&rdquo;</i>\u00a0Ruby spoke again when all she could hear was his ragged breathing.\u00a0<i>&ldquo;Can I just come over? I need to see you.&rdquo;</i></p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;I don't\u00a0<i>want</i>\u00a0to see you,&rdquo; he finally said. Judging by the sudden pause, he knew she was taken aback by that stone cold answer.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I broke things off with him. It&rsquo;s true this time.&rdquo;</i>\u00a0Her voice trembled just like how she&rsquo;d told him she would never leave him the night before she left. This might be another one of her easy lies. But why did he keep on listening instead of hanging up?</p><p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna make an official announcement soon. But I wanted you to hear it from me,&quot;\u00a0</i>she went on to fill in his silence.\u00a0<i>&quot;Baby, I-I know you won&rsquo;t believe me when I tell you this, but\u00a0</i><i>I love you</i><i>. I still do. As much as I did before. I&rsquo;m sorry I waited until now to finally end things with James. I guess I was just scared, but I&rsquo;m not scared anymore. Now I know what I want. And I want us.&rdquo;</i></p><p>That was exactly what Harry had wanted to hear a couple months ago. But everything was different now.</p><p>&ldquo;Rubes,&rdquo; he whispered, eyes squeezed shut as his brows furrowed harder. The sound of her laugh used to take him to heaven, now it only dragged him to hell.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I missed your voice,&quot;\u00a0</i>Ruby said, funny how a smile could be heard through the phone.\u00a0<i>&quot;I miss you. Terribly.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He shook his head slowly, afterward smiling to himself as he remembered she couldn&rsquo;t see him.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Please say something, H. Anything. Let me come see you.&rdquo;</i></p><p>His face contorted as she begged him in the most tragic tone he&rsquo;d ever heard. It was like cleaning your closet and trying to debate if you should throw away the t-shirt you used to love that didn&rsquo;t fit anymore. He wanted her to shut up, but at the same time, didn&rsquo;t have the heart to end the conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;I loved you a lot,&rdquo; he said at last, trying to steady his breathing when he heard her do the same. &ldquo;I guess&hellip;you&rsquo;re always gonna mean something to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Ruby released a slight laugh as he took a pause.<i>\u00a0&quot;But?&ldquo;</i></p><p>He sighed in response to her voice crack, praying that she wouldn&rsquo;t burst into tears, for he wouldn&rsquo;t know how to cope with it. &quot;I can&rsquo;t do this again, Rubes. Go back to your fianc\u00e9. We&rsquo;re over.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go back to the man I don&rsquo;t love.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;You did once before. Sure you can do it again.&rdquo; He chuckled wryly. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m very sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t the woman he loved anymore. She was\u00a0<i>Ruby Ellis \u2014\u00a0</i>his co-star, an actress, a stranger. That was who she was to him from now on. And he knew better than to go back to her. However, for some reasons his heart ached to the thought of never hearing from her again after this call. Now he was so confused. What was it that he wanted?</p><p>Ruby didn&rsquo;t say anything, yet he could hear her quiet sobs which were slowly killing him. He pinched the bridge of his nose, holding his breath while waiting impatiently for her reply, which, sadly, never came.</p><p>The loud noise at the living room entrance caused his head to spin just in time Y/N caught the vase before it collided with the floor. Her big eyes stared straight at him, and his heart broke in reaction to her expression. Without reluctance, he ended the call with his ex-lover and rose from the chair, keeping eye-contact with Y/N as she took a few steps forward, eyes already filled with tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Ruby?&rdquo; Her voice was strained. &ldquo;Ruby Ellis? The actress?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry nodded, eyes glued to the floor. Y/N held her head with both hands, trying to fight the battle of emotions inside her chest as she put two and two together.</p><p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;d been with her fianc\u00e9 for three years.&rdquo; It was more like her talking to herself than to him. &ldquo;Did she&hellip;cheat on him with you?&rdquo;</p><p>Hurt and disbelief was etched on her face, but she still had to ask, expecting a different answer from the truth. However, Harry picked the worst time to finally be honest. He sucked in a breath, nodding his head and finally looking up to meet her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;We had an affair, but&hellip;it was more than that, at least for me. I was in love with her.&rdquo; Harry swallowed hard as he broke their eye-contact. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t walk away even though we&rsquo;d tried to call it quit endless of times. She told me she wasn&rsquo;t happy and that she was gonna leave him soon, and I was stupid enough to believe her&hellip;until she left me.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s face fell fast. In that instant her skin became pale, her mouth hung with lips slightly parted and her eyes stretched wide.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; She almost choked on her own words, but he wasn&rsquo;t looking at her to see how broken she was. &ldquo;I told you everything about Blake. I trusted you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re overreacting,&rdquo; he mumbled and turned away. Immediately, she marched straight towards him and clutched his elbow to force him to look at her.</p><p>&ldquo;What else are you hiding from me, Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; He scoffed. &ldquo;The past is the past. Why are you digging into mine now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because you can&rsquo;t seem to let it go!&rdquo; Y/N shook her head fast. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have a healthy relationship if you keep things like this from me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not in a relationship, are we?&rdquo;</p><p>Those words which got out on spur of the moment shocked her to the point that she let go of his arm and stumbled two steps back. Harry wasn&rsquo;t even thinking when he blurted out that sentence. He should&rsquo;ve stopped there. If only he&rsquo;d stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;You're\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0my girlfriend, I don&rsquo;t have to tell you everything. Even if I&rsquo;d told you, you would&rsquo;ve judged me like you do now, just like everyone else!&rdquo; Harry raised his voice, apparently too out of his mind to even notice the fear in her glistened eyes.\u00a0&quot;You had <i>one</i> boyfriend and the break up wasn&rsquo;t even that bad. You don&rsquo;t <i>fucking</i> know how awful it feels to give someone everything you\u2019ve got, and still cannot compete with the person who doesn\u2019t love them.&ldquo;</p><p>Y/N stared into those green eyes burning with anger. Her heart fell silent.</p><p>&quot;Then how do you think I&rsquo;m feeling right now?&rdquo;</p><p>That question struck Harry like lighting. It was only then that warmth flooded back to his features. Once he saw tears streaming down her pretty face, his entire body went limp and the rapid beating of his heart echoed within his brain. The red mark on her cheek was there to remind him she&rsquo;d been hurt before, now it was him who caused her more damage. The second lesson that he had never learnt, was never to let anger do the talking.</p><p>\u201cBlake left me just a week before my mother died, then you came back, you kissed me and left me too&hellip;Now put yourself in my shoes, H.\u00a0Just because your pain was different from mine, it doesn\u2019t mean you had it worse. I hurt too. I was depressed and starved myself for weeks&hellip;Is that what you want to hear?\u201d<br/></p><p>Trembling and afraid, Harry shook his head fast as he reached for her hands, but she shrugged him off to cover her face and muffle the heartbreaking sobs that were tearing him apart. Although she was standing right there, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like she was slipping through his fingers. He quickly clutched her arms, tears shone in his eyes yet she refused to look at him now.</p><p>&ldquo;I\u2019m so sorry&hellip;I shouldn\u2019t&hellip;I-I\u00a0don&rsquo;t love her anymore&hellip;You have to trust me,&rdquo; he pleaded, tilting his head to catch a glimpse of her face. He watched her shoulders tremble with despair. Finally, she looked up, both pairs of tear-filled eyes staring at one another.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t love me either.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N could see that Harry was taken aback by those words so she gave him a nod to confirm the truth.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew what I said, Harry.\u00a0<i>I love you</i>. I thought you just needed more time,&rdquo; she whispered, her brows drew closer together. &ldquo;But now I know&hellip;I can never compete with her.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s heart sank to the pit of his stomach as he heard those words. Y/N stood still, arms glued to her sides. She should feel affection when he held her face, not\u00a0<i>this</i>, not the discomfort of his cold palms against her skin. She wanted to push him away, but she didn&rsquo;t have any energy left to even flinch.</p><p>He shook his head fast, pressing their foreheads together. &ldquo;Bambi, look at me&hellip;You&rsquo;re not here to replace her.\u00a0I don&rsquo;t love her anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>When he repeated those words, she almost believed him.\u00a0<i>Almost</i>. But she couldn&rsquo;t. Not after what he&rsquo;d said on the phone. Not after what he&rsquo;d said to her when he lost his temper.</p><p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not what you meant.&rdquo; She exhaled sharply. &ldquo;She still has a place in your heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&hellip;I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t&hellip;I just\u2014&rdquo; He tried to explain though the words that got out made absolutely no sense.</p><p>&ldquo;Did she leave you right before you came back for my mother&rsquo;s funeral?&rdquo; She cut him off, not wanting to be fed with more of his meaningless words. She just wanted solid proofs that she wasn&rsquo;t his rebound, yet there he was, looking startled and hesitating before nodding his head to confirm her fear was real.</p><p>&ldquo;Was she the one who called you after we kissed in the treehouse? The reason you were so eager to leave?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It's\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes or no, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Now both of them were crying in front of one another. Y/N soon forgot about the mark on her cheek. Not a single slap could compare to this pain she must endure from hearing his confessions.</p><p>&ldquo;One last question. And please be honest with me,&rdquo; she spoke with a breathy voice.\u00a0<i>&ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Silence.</p><p>Utter silence.</p><p>He could&rsquo;ve said no, and it would&rsquo;ve felt less insulting than him giving her silence and reluctance instead. She loved him so much that she wanted to justify for his reaction by saying he&rsquo;d been hurt before and was terrified by the idea of love,\u00a0<i>that</i>\u00a0she could understand. But weren&rsquo;t they both the same? She&rsquo;d been hurt too. She had every single reason to believe love didn&rsquo;t exist until she looked into his eyes. She had fought all that fear within her just to say those words to him, and\u00a0<i>meant</i>\u00a0it. If he couldn&rsquo;t fight for her, if he must have a second thought to decide how he should feel about her, then what was she still doing here?</p><p>Harry sucked in a breath when Y/N grabbed both of his hands and removed them from her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be like my dad.&rdquo; Her voice became as fragile as glass. &ldquo;I love you&hellip;but if you don&rsquo;t love me back, you have to let me go.&rdquo;</p><p>When Y/N said those words, she did hope that he would change his mind. She did wait. But he didn&rsquo;t speak. And when her time for him had run out, she quietly went back to the bedroom. As for Harry, he was rooted to the spot, still trying to get grip on reality.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take too long until Y/N returned, now dressed in her own clothes and holding her handbag. He was still standing there, waiting for her to leave him instead of saying those words she&rsquo;d shrugged off all of her pride to say to him. His face was paler than her ever recalled it being, as if his blood was all shrinking away.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the door fell shut. And she was gone.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>When Y/N stumbled out on the street, her eyes flooded with tears and the first person she called was Celine. She just needed to talk to someone or else her heart might combust any minute now. She bit her nails while waiting for her best friend to pick up the phone. Though it took a bit longer than usual, she knew Celine would never miss any of her calls.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, baby! Wow, I was just about to call you. Talk about being soulmates!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Cece, I\u2014&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re sitting down right now because your girl has an announcement to make!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N literally held her breath for that one second pause.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m engaged!&rdquo;</i></p><p>When Celine screamed the big news into the phone, her best friend from across the ocean was so shocked she couldn&rsquo;t make a sound. She stood like a corpse on the side of the road, tears in her eyes but she was too afraid her heartbreak would ruin her best friend&rsquo;s happy day.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N, are you still there?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you crying?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N faked a laugh. The last thing she wanted was to make this about herself.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;m just so happy for you two,&rdquo; she said, trying to sound as cheerful as she could pretend.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Aww, my love! Gosh, I wish you were here with us.&quot;\u00a0</i>Celine giggled.\u00a0<i>&quot;Oh, why did you call by the way?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I just missed you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Y/N pressed her lips together, taking a deep breath. &ldquo;Hey, something just came up, I gotta go now. I&rsquo;ll call you another time, yeah? Then we can spend hours talking about this.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, we certainly will! Love you, baby.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Love you too, baby.&rdquo;</p><p>When that phone call came to an end, Y/N sank even deeper into depression.</p><p>How could it be?</p><p>In less than twelve hours,\u00a0<i>everything</i>\u00a0had been taken away from her. She had prided herself on being independent and laughed in the faces of the ones who needed the company of another to feel fulfill. Here she was, completely lost with no one to turn to, not even herself. So she kept on walking, letting her tears fall and her feet lead the way. Maybe when the sun rose in a few hours, everything would be alright.</p><p>If only it&rsquo;d been that easy.</p><p>The rain came without warning. It started our with little droplets, and the next second it was a torrential downpour, washing over her skin so strongly that it felt as if she was standing under a giant waterfall. Y/N didn&rsquo;t have an umbrella with her, so the only thing she could do was cover her head with the handbag and attempt to call a taxi on the phone. Due to unfortunate carelessness, the device slipped out of her grip and fell right into the puddle on the pavement, causing Y/N to literally scream out a curse word. There wasn&rsquo;t anyone around to think she was insane anyway.</p><p>The phone was dripping in rainwater when she picked it up, thus only magic could get it to work again. This time, instead of risking her life to run home, she dashed to find cover under a roof nearby, just in time two headlights appeared through the thick water curtain.</p><p>A car pulled over in front of Y/N. The familiar voice grabbed her attention right before she could recognize the person in the driver seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Get in!&rdquo; Marcy shouted as she tapped on the window.</p><p>This woman would be the last person Y/N wanted to be around at a moment like this, but she was given no other choice. It was either being safe in the car with the crazy person who&rsquo;d slapped her, or risking standing there and getting swept away by the thunderstorm. Any sane person would&rsquo;ve chosen the former in a heartbeat.</p><p>Immediately, Y/N got into the passenger seat and heaved a heavy sigh as she slammed the door shut, trying to catch her breath with her head back tossed back and eyes shut. Marcy quickly turned back to grab something from the backseat.</p><p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; She wrapped the huge blanket around Y/N&rsquo;s body, stroking both of her arms to keep her warm.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have a huge ass blanket in your car?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I get cold easily.&rdquo; Marcy rolled her eyes, although she did find it amusing how Y/N was more shocked by the blanket, than the fact that she&rsquo;d showed up just in time to rescue her from the storm.</p><p>&ldquo;Better?&rdquo; Asked the blonde as she drove away in the rain, taking a quick glance at her future stepdaughter whose eyes were still shut, too lost in her own head to even hear that one-word question.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you find me?&rdquo; Y/N asked once she&rsquo;d calmed down.</p><p>&ldquo;It was pure luck I guess,&rdquo; replied Marcy. &ldquo;I was driving around the city looking for you, and when it began to rain I was about to give up, then I saw you on the side of the road.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t say anything, instead turning her head to the left. Water droplets hit the car window as they drove onwards. She watched those raindrops race down, somehow finding a little bit of peace and calmness in the loud and chaotic storm.</p><p>Now that the heavy shower had washed away his scent on her body, she didn&rsquo;t want to go back anymore. She didn&rsquo;t even want to return to her flat where everywhere she looked reminded her of him. Now she had no other place to go but one.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you heading back to Holmes Chapel?&rdquo; She asked Marcy, who was taken aback by the sudden question.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;yeah, but I can drop you off\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She shook her head, staring at the road ahead instead of the woman in the driver seat. &ldquo;Just keep on driving.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry completely lost track of time, which seemed to fly faster as he was lost in his own thoughts. Maybe he would&rsquo;ve continued sitting there on his sofa and replaying Y/N&rsquo;s words over and over again in his head until he passed out from exhaustion, if the sound of thunder hadn&rsquo;t dragged him back to reality.</p><p>His head turned to the glass window when the rain started to pour. All that he could see was a thick curtain of water and the hazy city light hidden underneath it. His heart stopped for a second when he recalled the accident which left Y/N with a sprained ankle. He couldn&rsquo;t show up to help her then, now she was out in the rain because of him.</p><p>If something bad happened to her&hellip;</p><p>Harry quickly rose up as the thought briefly crossed his mind, just in time his phone began to ring. The name\u00a0Ruby\u00a0appeared on the screen again, but this time, he didn&rsquo;t even care. It was funny and sad at the same time, how the moment of realization always came a bit too late.</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>Not until then did it occur to Harry that his Bambi had left him for good. He&rsquo;d officially lost her.</p><p>Now that she was gone, he missed her, he needed her, he worried about her. Now that he knew there was a high chance that he could never get her back, it felt as if he was bleeding internally. The pain couldn&rsquo;t compare to when Ruby left him, no, it was\u00a0<i>much</i>\u00a0worse. It tore his chest opened. If something bad happened to her tonight, how could he possibly live with himself?</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>Harry ran fast to his bedroom to throw on a pair of jeans and the t-shirt she&rsquo;d left on his bed, which still smelt like her. He returned to the living room and grabbed an umbrella before heading out as fast as possible. He rushed to the street, gasping for air as the raindrops hit his cold skin. Even with an umbrella above his head, Harry couldn&rsquo;t save his clothes from getting soaked just in less than a minute. But it was the least of his concerns now. He turned left, then right, mouth agape, eyebrows knitted together. There was not a single person or car in sight. Where was she? Where was his Bambi?</p><p>He dialed her number but he couldn&rsquo;t reach her. She either had him blocked or her phone turned off, whichever it was, he wasn&rsquo;t sure if she was safe, and he couldn&rsquo;t rest knowing she was somewhere out there in this pouring rain, all on her own.</p><p>He must go find her now.</p><p><i>What had he done?</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was a long drive back to Holmes Chapel, for no vehicle could go fast in this kind of weather. The more time it took the more uncomfortable it got for the two young women in this car.</p><p>Marcy inhaled deeply as she stole another glance at Y/N, who had been so quiet that Marcy felt like it would be a crime if she breathed a bit too loud. She thought it might be for the best if she just kept silent and her eyes on the road. However, it was hard to ignore the mark on Y/N&rsquo;s cheek. Although it looked better now than before, it reminded Marcy of what she&rsquo;d done. And she&rsquo;d been tormenting herself over it from the night before.</p><p>After a couple seconds of contemplating, she finally spoke up, &ldquo;About what happened in the store&hellip;&rdquo; She paused to clear her throat. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m very sorry. I shouldn&rsquo;t have\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; Y/N cut her off, speaking in a monotone. The girl couldn&rsquo;t sound any less indifferent, not her usual aggressive and sarcastic tone. That was how Marcy knew it had a lot to do with the big reason behind her wanting to go back to Holmes Chapel. Marcy was just too afraid to ask.</p><p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; Y/N went on, this time sounding breathless. &ldquo;My father was the one who took the ring from my mother, not you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Marcy sucked in a deep breath. &ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t take the ring back.&rdquo;</p><p>This time, Y/N finally turned to look at her, eyes broadened at once. Marcy kept her focus on the road, yet her expression hardened as if what she was about to say was going to be very brutal to the young girl sitting next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;On the night of the accident, before your mother left, she gave it back to him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;W-What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your father asked me not to tell you this but&hellip;I think you deserve to know the truth.&rdquo; Marcy sighed, tightening her grip on the steering wheel. &ldquo;Your parents had planned on getting divorced two months prior to Tam&rsquo;s death. I-I had nothing to do with it, I don&rsquo;t even know the reason. It wasn&rsquo;t until after she&rsquo;d left that Brad and I began to grow feelings for each other. But everyone blames me for their fight, for her accident. I guess that was why I got so fed up with your attitude and\u2014&rdquo; Marcy blinked fast, shaking her head in guilt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to justify my action, because I know it was wrong. But I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you on purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t expect any of that. Besides the divorce, nothing else seemed to make sense. Why did her mother take off the ring that she loved more than herself? What was it that they were arguing about that night?</p><p>She had hoped that Marcy was just lying, yet for someone with such a troubled past, she would be able to tell if someone was spilling out lies. Therefore she was sure Marcy had said exactly what she knew. Now Y/N felt like she knew nothing at all, not even her mother, the one she loved most.</p><p>&ldquo;You should take a nap. I&rsquo;ll wake you up when we&rsquo;re almost home,&rdquo; Marcy said with a smile.</p><p>Now that the rain was over, the sky glowed like a summer peach and the sun slowly emerged from the skyline as tall buildings rose out of darkness. Y/N&rsquo;s heart was at peace once again, knowing she would be\u00a0<i>home</i>\u00a0soon.</p><p>But as she closed her eyes to get some rest, all that she could see was\u00a0<i>him</i>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Bambi! Please, open the door if you&rsquo;re in there!&rdquo; Harry knocked more urgently this time as he tried to catch his breath and fight back the tears. His voice was hoarse from pleading for her to let him in. It had been a while, and now he began to think she wasn&rsquo;t there.</p><p>The first golden light of the new day snuck through the little window near the ceiling into the hallway, blinding Harry for a second as if to let him know that the sun had come once again. How often we saw the dawn and took it for granted, that when darkness took over we suddenly craved for the light and the life it brought to our world? Same as Y/N. Now that she was gone, he finally realized what he&rsquo;d lost.</p><p>Harry sat down on the floor with his back against her front door, head in his hands. Their last conversation soon came back to haunt him, and so was the look on her face when he let her go. He knew he deserved that. He was unworthy of her love. But now that he&rsquo;d lost his ray of sunshine, how could he live with this cold?</p><p>In just a minute, Harry&rsquo;s eyes dripped with tears as he gazed toward the window above, as if the light could soothe him. His face twisted and his fists clenched so tight he could feel the sweat trapped inside them. He looked like the same distressed little boy who&rsquo;d lost the stuffed bunny\u00a0<i>and</i>\u00a0the girl he loved. It would take more than a black eye and losing his captain armband to win her back this time.</p><p>But right now, he just wanted to know if she was safe. He wiped his tears and pulled out his phone, quickly making a call to the only person he knew would be able to help.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</i>\u00a0Isaac answered after five seconds. His sleepy voice was evident that he was barely awake.</p><p>&ldquo;Mate&hellip;did Y/N come to you, or at least contact you?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;No. What&rsquo;s wrong? Did something happen to her?&quot;\u00a0</i>Just like him, his best friend sounded overly distraught.</p><p>&quot;We had a fight and she ran off in the rain and&hellip;I&rsquo;m right outside her place right now but she&rsquo;s not home yet.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t answer your calls?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Harry sighed, combing his fingers through his hair. &ldquo;Maybe if you call her, she&rsquo;ll pick up.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll text you if I know where she is.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. I-I appreciate that.&rdquo;</p><p>Isaac hummed as a reply, and hung up the phone. Harry sat there with his head tossed back, resting against the door, his eyes on the ceiling. Now he was too stressed to even get on with his day and act like nothing was wrong when\u00a0<i>everything</i>\u00a0was. But if he continued to sit there for too long, one of Y/N&rsquo;s neighbors might report him, or even worse, someone could start a false rumor that might damage her reputation. Sighing, he pushed himself off the floor to stand up straight, one palm pressed against the wall to keep his balance.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey you!&rdquo;</p><p>When Harry heard that voice, his head jerked in its direction where he found an old lady walking up the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, ma'am,&rdquo; he mumbled, pressing his lips into a small smile as she approached him. But the woman couldn&rsquo;t look more irritated.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dating the girl in that flat, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry parted his lips, not knowing how to answer, but he assumed the old woman must be Mrs. Huang, the angry neighbor who kept complaining about him and Y/N having sex a bit too loud. She didn&rsquo;t even need a response him him, and just went straight into the point, handing him the pink notebook which he hadn&rsquo;t noticed that she&rsquo;d been holding until now.</p><p>&ldquo;She dropped this yesterday. Maybe you can give it back to her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Huang eyed at the young man from head to toes, making him think she might begin to lecture him on how to not disturb the neighbors. However, what she said to him was this.</p><p>&ldquo;Ever since you came around, I&rsquo;ve seen her sing a different song everyday when she leaves the building. As annoying as she might be sometimes, that girl seems to be head over heels for you.&rdquo; Then the woman sighed happily, her wrinkles became more visible now that she was smiling at him. &ldquo;I miss being young and in love with someone. Hold onto it while you still can, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>When Mrs. Huang patted him on the arm and returned to her home, Harry looked down at the pink notebook in his hand. And in a few seconds, all the memories flooded back and the different images of her beautiful smile flashed right through his mind. At that moment, he realized, the goodbye wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be the hardest part, it was the flashbacks that followed right after.</p><p>Every single day he&rsquo;d spent with Ruby had been filled with fear and anxiety, which he&rsquo;d mistook for passion. But Y/N was his medicine. When he was with her, the pain stopped. She made him feel safe even though their relationship had never been solid, and with her he could get away from the chaotic of his world to find real peace.</p><p>After getting soaked in the rain, his old t-shirt no longer smelt like his Bambi, which meant he had nothing left of her to keep, not even her scent. Now he missed her with a pain in his guts like fire burning slow.</p><p>Had he been brave enough to just face his fear and accept the fact that it was love. It wasn&rsquo;t anything like the love he&rsquo;d had for Ruby, but it\u00a0<i>was</i>\u00a0love. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have trembled every time she called his name, his knees wouldn&rsquo;t have gone weak every time he caught her smiling at him, he wouldn&rsquo;t have spent most of the time during a day thinking, fantasizing, daydreaming about her.</p><p>If it wasn&rsquo;t love, what else could it be?</p><p>In his heart he retracted all the terrible things he had said to her. He&rsquo;d learnt his lessons the hard way, but not soon enough for the two of them.<br/></p><p>.<br/></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Your sim card is okay, but I&rsquo;m gonna have to take your phone to the repair store. Meanwhile, you can use my old Blackberry, it still works pretty damn fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N pressed her lips into a small smile as she took the phone from her dad, sitting down on the edge of her bed with a blanket wrapped around her now dry and warm body. Bradford stood there for a moment to make sure his daughter didn&rsquo;t need anything else. He was debating with himself whether or not he should ask about why she&rsquo;d come back. But once he saw the look on her face as she acted busy with the device, he took it as a cue to leave her alone for now.</p><p>Once her bedroom door was shut, Y/N finally lifted her eyes as sadness clouded her features at once. She carefully looked around the room. There was a strange melancholy feeling in her heart to be back in her childhood home after two years. Everything looked almost the same as the day she left for college, but it didn&rsquo;t feel the same because she was the one who&rsquo;d changed.</p><p>Through that window, she used to secretly watch Harry return home from school everyday. In this bed, he used to hold her as they both fell asleep on nights when her parents were both out of town, and her irresponsible aunt didn&rsquo;t care if there was a boy in her room. On that desk, she&rsquo;d written countless pages about him,\u00a0<i>for</i>\u00a0him, that he might never get to read. She looked around this room and all she could see were their ghosts lurking in every single corner.</p><p>After all those years, the boy next door was still so far out of reach. And she was still the same fourteen-year-old pining over her older neighbor who didn&rsquo;t love her in return. That bitter truth made her eyes well up, but she was too old to live in Wonderland anymore. It was time for her to go back.</p><p>The new ringtone blasted from the old phone shocked Y/N to the point that she almost tossed her dad&rsquo;s Blackberry across the room. Fortunately, she didn&rsquo;t. She sighed in relief the second the name\u00a0Isey\u00a0appeared on the screen. Wiping away her tears, she pressed answer immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;H-Hi&hellip;&rdquo; Y/N exhaled a nervous laugh, hoping he wasn&rsquo;t able to tell what a wreck she was. But he already knew that when he decided to call.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Smiley, are you okay? Where are you? Are you safe? Are you with someone?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Then the answer just appeared in her head on its own. Her smile faded soon as realization sank in. Her voice was soft and careful as she questioned, &ldquo;what did Harry tell you?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;That you two got into a fight and you ran off in the storm.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N scoffed, looking down and shaking her head slightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no big deal really.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; She pursed her lips, trying to come up with a white lie good enough to convince him she was okay. &ldquo;We just had a small disagreement and, yeah, like we always do. It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I still think you should call him back,&rdquo;</i>\u00a0Isaac said. She could imagine the frown upon his face.<i>\u00a0&quot;He was so worried.&ldquo;</i></p><p>&quot;Hmm,&rdquo; she hummed, pressing her lips to form a straight line, not knowing what else to say.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Where are you now?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;in Holmes Chapel.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Hiding.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back for my father&rsquo;s wedding in two days.&rdquo; She chuckled nervously, eyes glancing at the spinning fan above her head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about me.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a long pause from Isaac&rsquo;s side when all she could hear was his soft yet heavy breathing. She wished she could tell him what had happened, but neither her heart nor her head agreed it was a good idea to confide in Harry&rsquo;s best friend. So she just sat in silence and waited for him to speak. Eventually, he did.</p><p><i>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sad, just say so.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N nodded in response to those words, yet she soon realized that he couldn&rsquo;t see her so she quietly reassured him that she was fine. Though Isaac could probably tell she only said that so he would stop worrying about her, he was nice enough to not call her out for being a terrible liar.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I gotta go now&hellip;&rdquo; She said fast, her brows pinched together as her eyes squeezed shut. &ldquo;Talk to you another time?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Alright.&quot;\u00a0</i>He let our a short breath.\u00a0<i>&quot;Have a great day, Smiley.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Wait! One more thing!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</i>\u00a0His light chuckle caused her to smile a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell Harry I&rsquo;m here&hellip;I&rsquo;m gonna talk to him myself when I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Promise?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Promise.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Knowing that Isaac always kept his words, Y/N trusted him entirely as she muttered a goodbye and waited for him to hang up first.</p><p>She put her phone down, staring at the window where came the new daylight welcoming her back to the small town of Holmes Chapel. The girl smiled sadly as she curled up in a ball on her childhood bed, her eyes fell shut in an instant. The exhaustion caused her body to hang limp like wet laundry on a winter day, now every one of her muscles was giving into gravity.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she could feel the sorrow in her chest waiting to take over, yet the fear didn&rsquo;t seem to exist like many times before. She knew the feeling of losing someone she loved, physically, emotionally, or\u00a0<i>both</i>; and knowing it probably made it less scary. But what was worse than fear was the emptiness that followed when that someone was gone. She was learning how to deal with it, but slowly.</p>",

Judging by the sudden pause, he knew she was taken aback by that stone cold answer.</p><p><i>\u201cI broke things off with him. It\u2019s true this time.\u201d</i>\u00a0Her voice trembled just like how she\u2019d told him she would never leave him the night before she left. This might be another one of her easy lies. But why did he keep on listening instead of hanging up?</p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna make an official announcement soon. But I wanted you to hear it from me,\"\u00a0</i>she went on to fill in his silence.\u00a0<i>\"Baby, I-I know you won\u2019t believe me when I tell you this, but\u00a0</i><i>I love you</i><i>. I still do. As much as I did before. I\u2019m sorry I waited until now to finally end things with James. I guess I was just scared, but I\u2019m not scared anymore. Now I know what I want. And I want us.\u201d</i></p><p>That was exactly what Harry had wanted to hear a couple months ago. But everything was different now.</p><p>\u201cRubes,\u201d he whispered, eyes squeezed shut as his brows furrowed harder. The sound of her laugh used to take him to heaven, now it only dragged him to hell.</p><p><i>\u201cI missed your voice,\"\u00a0</i>Ruby said, funny how a smile could be heard through the phone.\u00a0<i>\"I miss you. Terribly.\u201d</i></p><p>He shook his head slowly, afterward smiling to himself as he remembered she couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p><i>\u201cPlease say something, H. Anything. Let me come see you.\u201d</i></p><p>His face contorted as she begged him in the most tragic tone he\u2019d ever heard. It was like cleaning your closet and trying to debate if you should throw away the t-shirt you used to love that didn\u2019t fit anymore. He wanted her to shut up, but at the same time, didn\u2019t have the heart to end the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI loved you a lot,\u201d he said at last, trying to steady his breathing when he heard her do the same. \u201cI guess\u2026you\u2019re always gonna mean something to me.\u201d</p><p>Ruby released a slight laugh as he took a pause.<i>\u00a0\"But?\u201c</i></p><p>He sighed in response to her voice crack, praying that she wouldn\u2019t burst into tears, for he wouldn\u2019t know how to cope with it. \"I can\u2019t do this again, Rubes. Go back to your fianc\u00e9. We\u2019re over.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t go back to the man I don\u2019t love.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou did once before. Sure you can do it again.\u201d He chuckled wryly. \u201cI-I\u2019m very sorry.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the woman he loved anymore. She was\u00a0<i>Ruby Ellis \u2014\u00a0</i>his co-star, an actress, a stranger. That was who she was to him from now on. And he knew better than to go back to her. However, for some reasons his heart ached to the thought of never hearing from her again after this call. Now he was so confused. What was it that he wanted?</p><p>Ruby didn\u2019t say anything, yet he could hear her quiet sobs which were slowly killing him. He pinched the bridge of his nose, holding his breath while waiting impatiently for her reply, which, sadly, never came.</p><p>The loud noise at the living room entrance caused his head to spin just in time Y/N caught the vase before it collided with the floor. Her big eyes stared straight at him, and his heart broke in reaction to her expression. Without reluctance, he ended the call with his ex-lover and rose from the chair, keeping eye-contact with Y/N as she took a few steps forward, eyes already filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cRuby?\u201d Her voice was strained. \u201cRuby Ellis? The actress?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded, eyes glued to the floor. Y/N held her head with both hands, trying to fight the battle of emotions inside her chest as she put two and two together.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019d been with her fianc\u00e9 for three years.\u201d It was more like her talking to herself than to him. \u201cDid she\u2026cheat on him with you?\u201d</p><p>Hurt and disbelief was etched on her face, but she still had to ask, expecting a different answer from the truth. However, Harry picked the worst time to finally be honest. He sucked in a breath, nodding his head and finally looking up to meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe had an affair, but\u2026it was more than that, at least for me. I was in love with her.\u201d Harry swallowed hard as he broke their eye-contact. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk away even though we\u2019d tried to call it quit endless of times. She told me she wasn\u2019t happy and that she was gonna leave him soon, and I was stupid enough to believe her\u2026until she left me.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s face fell fast. In that instant her skin became pale, her mouth hung with lips slightly parted and her eyes stretched wide.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d She almost choked on her own words, but he wasn\u2019t looking at her to see how broken she was. \u201cI told you everything about Blake. I trusted you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overreacting,\u201d he mumbled and turned away. Immediately, she marched straight towards him and clutched his elbow to force him to look at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat else are you hiding from me, Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cThe past is the past. Why are you digging into mine now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can\u2019t seem to let it go!\u201d Y/N shook her head fast. \u201cWe won\u2019t have a healthy relationship if you keep things like this from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re not in a relationship, are we?\u201d</p><p>Those words which got out on spur of the moment shocked her to the point that she let go of his arm and stumbled two steps back. Harry wasn\u2019t even thinking when he blurted out that sentence. He should\u2019ve stopped there. If only he\u2019d stopped.</p><p>\u201cYou're\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0my girlfriend, I don\u2019t have to tell you everything. Even if I\u2019d told you, you would\u2019ve judged me like you do now, just like everyone else!\u201d Harry raised his voice, apparently too out of his mind to even notice the fear in her glistened eyes.\u00a0\"You had <i>one</i> boyfriend and the break up wasn\u2019t even that bad. You don\u2019t <i>fucking</i> know how awful it feels to give someone everything you\u2019ve got, and still cannot compete with the person who doesn\u2019t love them.\u201c</p><p>Y/N stared into those green eyes burning with anger. Her heart fell silent.</p><p>\"Then how do you think I\u2019m feeling right now?\u201d</p><p>That question struck Harry like lighting. It was only then that warmth flooded back to his features. Once he saw tears streaming down her pretty face, his entire body went limp and the rapid beating of his heart echoed within his brain. The red mark on her cheek was there to remind him she\u2019d been hurt before, now it was him who caused her more damage. The second lesson that he had never learnt, was never to let anger do the talking.</p><p>\u201cBlake left me just a week before my mother died, then you came back, you kissed me and left me too\u2026Now put yourself in my shoes, H.\u00a0Just because your pain was different from mine, it doesn\u2019t mean you had it worse. I hurt too. I was depressed and starved myself for weeks\u2026Is that what you want to hear?\u201d<br></p><p>Trembling and afraid, Harry shook his head fast as he reached for her hands, but she shrugged him off to cover her face and muffle the heartbreaking sobs that were tearing him apart. Although she was standing right there, he couldn\u2019t help but feel like she was slipping through his fingers. He quickly clutched her arms, tears shone in his eyes yet she refused to look at him now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026I shouldn\u2019t\u2026I-I\u00a0don\u2019t love her anymore\u2026You have to trust me,\u201d he pleaded, tilting his head to catch a glimpse of her face. He watched her shoulders tremble with despair. Finally, she looked up, both pairs of tear-filled eyes staring at one another.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love me either.\u201d</p><p>Y/N could see that Harry was taken aback by those words so she gave him a nod to confirm the truth.</p><p>\u201cYes, I knew what I said, Harry.\u00a0<i>I love you</i>. I thought you just needed more time,\u201d she whispered, her brows drew closer together. \u201cBut now I know\u2026I can never compete with her.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s heart sank to the pit of his stomach as he heard those words. Y/N stood still, arms glued to her sides. She should feel affection when he held her face, not\u00a0<i>this</i>, not the discomfort of his cold palms against her skin. She wanted to push him away, but she didn\u2019t have any energy left to even flinch.</p><p>He shook his head fast, pressing their foreheads together. \u201cBambi, look at me\u2026You\u2019re not here to replace her.\u00a0I don\u2019t love her anymore.\u201d</p><p>When he repeated those words, she almost believed him.\u00a0<i>Almost</i>. But she couldn\u2019t. Not after what he\u2019d said on the phone. Not after what he\u2019d said to her when he lost his temper.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not what you meant.\u201d She exhaled sharply. \u201cShe still has a place in your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2026I\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026I just\u2014\u201d He tried to explain though the words that got out made absolutely no sense.</p><p>\u201cDid she leave you right before you came back for my mother\u2019s funeral?\u201d She cut him off, not wanting to be fed with more of his meaningless words. She just wanted solid proofs that she wasn\u2019t his rebound, yet there he was, looking startled and hesitating before nodding his head to confirm her fear was real.</p><p>\u201cWas she the one who called you after we kissed in the treehouse? The reason you were so eager to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt's\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes or no, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-Yes.\u201d</p><p>Now both of them were crying in front of one another. Y/N soon forgot about the mark on her cheek. Not a single slap could compare to this pain she must endure from hearing his confessions.</p><p>\u201cOne last question. And please be honest with me,\u201d she spoke with a breathy voice.\u00a0<i>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d</i></p><p>Silence.</p><p>Utter silence.</p><p>He could\u2019ve said no, and it would\u2019ve felt less insulting than him giving her silence and reluctance instead. She loved him so much that she wanted to justify for his reaction by saying he\u2019d been hurt before and was terrified by the idea of love,\u00a0<i>that</i>\u00a0she could understand. But weren\u2019t they both the same? She\u2019d been hurt too. She had every single reason to believe love didn\u2019t exist until she looked into his eyes. She had fought all that fear within her just to say those words to him, and\u00a0<i>meant</i>\u00a0it. If he couldn\u2019t fight for her, if he must have a second thought to decide how he should feel about her, then what was she still doing here?</p><p>Harry sucked in a breath when Y/N grabbed both of his hands and removed them from her face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like my dad.\u201d Her voice became as fragile as glass. \u201cI love you\u2026but if you don\u2019t love me back, you have to let me go.\u201d</p><p>When Y/N said those words, she did hope that he would change his mind. She did wait. But he didn\u2019t speak. And when her time for him had run out, she quietly went back to the bedroom. As for Harry, he was rooted to the spot, still trying to get grip on reality.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take too long until Y/N returned, now dressed in her own clothes and holding her handbag. He was still standing there, waiting for her to leave him instead of saying those words she\u2019d shrugged off all of her pride to say to him. His face was paler than her ever recalled it being, as if his blood was all shrinking away.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the door fell shut. And she was gone.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>When Y/N stumbled out on the street, her eyes flooded with tears and the first person she called was Celine. She just needed to talk to someone or else her heart might combust any minute now. She bit her nails while waiting for her best friend to pick up the phone. Though it took a bit longer than usual, she knew Celine would never miss any of her calls.</p><p><i>\u201cHey, baby! Wow, I was just about to call you. Talk about being soulmates!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cCece, I\u2014\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI hope you\u2019re sitting down right now because your girl has an announcement to make!\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N literally held her breath for that one second pause.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m engaged!\u201d</i></p><p>When Celine screamed the big news into the phone, her best friend from across the ocean was so shocked she couldn\u2019t make a sound. She stood like a corpse on the side of the road, tears in her eyes but she was too afraid her heartbreak would ruin her best friend\u2019s happy day.</p><p><i>\u201cY/N, are you still there?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N faked a laugh. The last thing she wanted was to make this about herself.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m just so happy for you two,\u201d she said, trying to sound as cheerful as she could pretend.</p><p><i>\u201cAww, my love! Gosh, I wish you were here with us.\"\u00a0</i>Celine giggled.\u00a0<i>\"Oh, why did you call by the way?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI just missed you, that\u2019s all.\u201d Y/N pressed her lips together, taking a deep breath. \u201cHey, something just came up, I gotta go now. I\u2019ll call you another time, yeah? Then we can spend hours talking about this.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOh, we certainly will! Love you, baby.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cLove you too, baby.\u201d</p><p>When that phone call came to an end, Y/N sank even deeper into depression.</p><p>How could it be?</p><p>In less than twelve hours,\u00a0<i>everything</i>\u00a0had been taken away from her. She had prided herself on being independent and laughed in the faces of the ones who needed the company of another to feel fulfill. Here she was, completely lost with no one to turn to, not even herself. So she kept on walking, letting her tears fall and her feet lead the way. Maybe when the sun rose in a few hours, everything would be alright.</p><p>If only it\u2019d been that easy.</p><p>The rain came without warning. It started our with little droplets, and the next second it was a torrential downpour, washing over her skin so strongly that it felt as if she was standing under a giant waterfall. Y/N didn\u2019t have an umbrella with her, so the only thing she could do was cover her head with the handbag and attempt to call a taxi on the phone. Due to unfortunate carelessness, the device slipped out of her grip and fell right into the puddle on the pavement, causing Y/N to literally scream out a curse word. There wasn\u2019t anyone around to think she was insane anyway.</p><p>The phone was dripping in rainwater when she picked it up, thus only magic could get it to work again. This time, instead of risking her life to run home, she dashed to find cover under a roof nearby, just in time two headlights appeared through the thick water curtain.</p><p>A car pulled over in front of Y/N. The familiar voice grabbed her attention right before she could recognize the person in the driver seat.</p><p>\u201cGet in!\u201d Marcy shouted as she tapped on the window.</p><p>This woman would be the last person Y/N wanted to be around at a moment like this, but she was given no other choice. It was either being safe in the car with the crazy person who\u2019d slapped her, or risking standing there and getting swept away by the thunderstorm. Any sane person would\u2019ve chosen the former in a heartbeat.</p><p>Immediately, Y/N got into the passenger seat and heaved a heavy sigh as she slammed the door shut, trying to catch her breath with her head back tossed back and eyes shut. Marcy quickly turned back to grab something from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She wrapped the huge blanket around Y/N\u2019s body, stroking both of her arms to keep her warm.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have a huge ass blanket in your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get cold easily.\u201d Marcy rolled her eyes, although she did find it amusing how Y/N was more shocked by the blanket, than the fact that she\u2019d showed up just in time to rescue her from the storm.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d Asked the blonde as she drove away in the rain, taking a quick glance at her future stepdaughter whose eyes were still shut, too lost in her own head to even hear that one-word question.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d Y/N asked once she\u2019d calmed down.</p><p>\u201cIt was pure luck I guess,\u201d replied Marcy. \u201cI was driving around the city looking for you, and when it began to rain I was about to give up, then I saw you on the side of the road.\u201d</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t say anything, instead turning her head to the left. Water droplets hit the car window as they drove onwards. She watched those raindrops race down, somehow finding a little bit of peace and calmness in the loud and chaotic storm.</p><p>Now that the heavy shower had washed away his scent on her body, she didn\u2019t want to go back anymore. She didn\u2019t even want to return to her flat where everywhere she looked reminded her of him. Now she had no other place to go but one.</p><p>\u201cAre you heading back to Holmes Chapel?\u201d She asked Marcy, who was taken aback by the sudden question.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026yeah, but I can drop you off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, staring at the road ahead instead of the woman in the driver seat. \u201cJust keep on driving.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry completely lost track of time, which seemed to fly faster as he was lost in his own thoughts. Maybe he would\u2019ve continued sitting there on his sofa and replaying Y/N\u2019s words over and over again in his head until he passed out from exhaustion, if the sound of thunder hadn\u2019t dragged him back to reality.</p><p>His head turned to the glass window when the rain started to pour. All that he could see was a thick curtain of water and the hazy city light hidden underneath it. His heart stopped for a second when he recalled the accident which left Y/N with a sprained ankle. He couldn\u2019t show up to help her then, now she was out in the rain because of him.</p><p>If something bad happened to her\u2026</p><p>Harry quickly rose up as the thought briefly crossed his mind, just in time his phone began to ring. The name\u00a0Ruby\u00a0appeared on the screen again, but this time, he didn\u2019t even care. It was funny and sad at the same time, how the moment of realization always came a bit too late.</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>Not until then did it occur to Harry that his Bambi had left him for good. He\u2019d officially lost her.</p><p>Now that she was gone, he missed her, he needed her, he worried about her. Now that he knew there was a high chance that he could never get her back, it felt as if he was bleeding internally. The pain couldn\u2019t compare to when Ruby left him, no, it was\u00a0<i>much</i>\u00a0worse. It tore his chest opened. If something bad happened to her tonight, how could he possibly live with himself?</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>Harry ran fast to his bedroom to throw on a pair of jeans and the t-shirt she\u2019d left on his bed, which still smelt like her. He returned to the living room and grabbed an umbrella before heading out as fast as possible. He rushed to the street, gasping for air as the raindrops hit his cold skin. Even with an umbrella above his head, Harry couldn\u2019t save his clothes from getting soaked just in less than a minute. But it was the least of his concerns now. He turned left, then right, mouth agape, eyebrows knitted together. There was not a single person or car in sight. Where was she? Where was his Bambi?</p><p>He dialed her number but he couldn\u2019t reach her. She either had him blocked or her phone turned off, whichever it was, he wasn\u2019t sure if she was safe, and he couldn\u2019t rest knowing she was somewhere out there in this pouring rain, all on her own.</p><p>He must go find her now.</p><p><i>What had he done?</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was a long drive back to Holmes Chapel, for no vehicle could go fast in this kind of weather. The more time it took the more uncomfortable it got for the two young women in this car.</p><p>Marcy inhaled deeply as she stole another glance at Y/N, who had been so quiet that Marcy felt like it would be a crime if she breathed a bit too loud. She thought it might be for the best if she just kept silent and her eyes on the road. However, it was hard to ignore the mark on Y/N\u2019s cheek. Although it looked better now than before, it reminded Marcy of what she\u2019d done. And she\u2019d been tormenting herself over it from the night before.</p><p>After a couple seconds of contemplating, she finally spoke up, \u201cAbout what happened in the store\u2026\u201d She paused to clear her throat. \u201cI-I\u2019m very sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Y/N cut her off, speaking in a monotone. The girl couldn\u2019t sound any less indifferent, not her usual aggressive and sarcastic tone. That was how Marcy knew it had a lot to do with the big reason behind her wanting to go back to Holmes Chapel. Marcy was just too afraid to ask.</p><p>\u201cAfter all,\u201d Y/N went on, this time sounding breathless. \u201cMy father was the one who took the ring from my mother, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Marcy sucked in a deep breath. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t take the ring back.\u201d</p><p>This time, Y/N finally turned to look at her, eyes broadened at once. Marcy kept her focus on the road, yet her expression hardened as if what she was about to say was going to be very brutal to the young girl sitting next to her.</p><p>\u201cOn the night of the accident, before your mother left, she gave it back to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father asked me not to tell you this but\u2026I think you deserve to know the truth.\u201d Marcy sighed, tightening her grip on the steering wheel. \u201cYour parents had planned on getting divorced two months prior to Tam\u2019s death. I-I had nothing to do with it, I don\u2019t even know the reason. It wasn\u2019t until after she\u2019d left that Brad and I began to grow feelings for each other. But everyone blames me for their fight, for her accident. I guess that was why I got so fed up with your attitude and\u2014\u201d Marcy blinked fast, shaking her head in guilt. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to justify my action, because I know it was wrong. But I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you on purpose.\u201d</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t expect any of that. Besides the divorce, nothing else seemed to make sense. Why did her mother take off the ring that she loved more than herself? What was it that they were arguing about that night?</p><p>She had hoped that Marcy was just lying, yet for someone with such a troubled past, she would be able to tell if someone was spilling out lies. Therefore she was sure Marcy had said exactly what she knew. Now Y/N felt like she knew nothing at all, not even her mother, the one she loved most.</p><p>\u201cYou should take a nap. I\u2019ll wake you up when we\u2019re almost home,\u201d Marcy said with a smile.</p><p>Now that the rain was over, the sky glowed like a summer peach and the sun slowly emerged from the skyline as tall buildings rose out of darkness. Y/N\u2019s heart was at peace once again, knowing she would be\u00a0<i>home</i>\u00a0soon.</p><p>But as she closed her eyes to get some rest, all that she could see was\u00a0<i>him</i>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cBambi! Please, open the door if you\u2019re in there!\u201d Harry knocked more urgently this time as he tried to catch his breath and fight back the tears. His voice was hoarse from pleading for her to let him in. It had been a while, and now he began to think she wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>The first golden light of the new day snuck through the little window near the ceiling into the hallway, blinding Harry for a second as if to let him know that the sun had come once again. How often we saw the dawn and took it for granted, that when darkness took over we suddenly craved for the light and the life it brought to our world? Same as Y/N. Now that she was gone, he finally realized what he\u2019d lost.</p><p>Harry sat down on the floor with his back against her front door, head in his hands. Their last conversation soon came back to haunt him, and so was the look on her face when he let her go. He knew he deserved that. He was unworthy of her love. But now that he\u2019d lost his ray of sunshine, how could he live with this cold?</p><p>In just a minute, Harry\u2019s eyes dripped with tears as he gazed toward the window above, as if the light could soothe him. His face twisted and his fists clenched so tight he could feel the sweat trapped inside them. He looked like the same distressed little boy who\u2019d lost the stuffed bunny\u00a0<i>and</i>\u00a0the girl he loved. It would take more than a black eye and losing his captain armband to win her back this time.</p><p>But right now, he just wanted to know if she was safe. He wiped his tears and pulled out his phone, quickly making a call to the only person he knew would be able to help.</p><p><i>\u201cHello?\u201d</i>\u00a0Isaac answered after five seconds. His sleepy voice was evident that he was barely awake.</p><p>\u201cMate\u2026did Y/N come to you, or at least contact you?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cNo. What\u2019s wrong? Did something happen to her?\"\u00a0</i>Just like him, his best friend sounded overly distraught.</p><p>\"We had a fight and she ran off in the rain and\u2026I\u2019m right outside her place right now but she\u2019s not home yet.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cShe didn\u2019t answer your calls?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry sighed, combing his fingers through his hair. \u201cMaybe if you call her, she\u2019ll pick up.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll text you if I know where she is.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cThank you. I-I appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>Isaac hummed as a reply, and hung up the phone. Harry sat there with his head tossed back, resting against the door, his eyes on the ceiling. Now he was too stressed to even get on with his day and act like nothing was wrong when\u00a0<i>everything</i>\u00a0was. But if he continued to sit there for too long, one of Y/N\u2019s neighbors might report him, or even worse, someone could start a false rumor that might damage her reputation. Sighing, he pushed himself off the floor to stand up straight, one palm pressed against the wall to keep his balance.</p><p>\u201cHey you!\u201d</p><p>When Harry heard that voice, his head jerked in its direction where he found an old lady walking up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHi, ma'am,\u201d he mumbled, pressing his lips into a small smile as she approached him. But the woman couldn\u2019t look more irritated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating the girl in that flat, right?\u201d</p><p>Harry parted his lips, not knowing how to answer, but he assumed the old woman must be Mrs. Huang, the angry neighbor who kept complaining about him and Y/N having sex a bit too loud. She didn\u2019t even need a response him him, and just went straight into the point, handing him the pink notebook which he hadn\u2019t noticed that she\u2019d been holding until now.</p><p>\u201cShe dropped this yesterday. Maybe you can give it back to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026thank you.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Huang eyed at the young man from head to toes, making him think she might begin to lecture him on how to not disturb the neighbors. However, what she said to him was this.</p><p>\u201cEver since you came around, I\u2019ve seen her sing a different song everyday when she leaves the building. As annoying as she might be sometimes, that girl seems to be head over heels for you.\u201d Then the woman sighed happily, her wrinkles became more visible now that she was smiling at him. \u201cI miss being young and in love with someone. Hold onto it while you still can, alright?\u201d</p><p>When Mrs. Huang patted him on the arm and returned to her home, Harry looked down at the pink notebook in his hand. And in a few seconds, all the memories flooded back and the different images of her beautiful smile flashed right through his mind. At that moment, he realized, the goodbye wasn\u2019t supposed to be the hardest part, it was the flashbacks that followed right after.</p><p>Every single day he\u2019d spent with Ruby had been filled with fear and anxiety, which he\u2019d mistook for passion. But Y/N was his medicine. When he was with her, the pain stopped. She made him feel safe even though their relationship had never been solid, and with her he could get away from the chaotic of his world to find real peace.</p><p>After getting soaked in the rain, his old t-shirt no longer smelt like his Bambi, which meant he had nothing left of her to keep, not even her scent. Now he missed her with a pain in his guts like fire burning slow.</p><p>Had he been brave enough to just face his fear and accept the fact that it was love. It wasn\u2019t anything like the love he\u2019d had for Ruby, but it\u00a0<i>was</i>\u00a0love. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have trembled every time she called his name, his knees wouldn\u2019t have gone weak every time he caught her smiling at him, he wouldn\u2019t have spent most of the time during a day thinking, fantasizing, daydreaming about her.</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t love, what else could it be?</p><p>In his heart he retracted all the terrible things he had said to her. He\u2019d learnt his lessons the hard way, but not soon enough for the two of them.<br></p><p>.<br></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cYour sim card is okay, but I\u2019m gonna have to take your phone to the repair store. Meanwhile, you can use my old Blackberry, it still works pretty damn fine.\u201d</p><p>Y/N pressed her lips into a small smile as she took the phone from her dad, sitting down on the edge of her bed with a blanket wrapped around her now dry and warm body. Bradford stood there for a moment to make sure his daughter didn\u2019t need anything else. He was debating with himself whether or not he should ask about why she\u2019d come back. But once he saw the look on her face as she acted busy with the device, he took it as a cue to leave her alone for now.</p><p>Once her bedroom door was shut, Y/N finally lifted her eyes as sadness clouded her features at once. She carefully looked around the room. There was a strange melancholy feeling in her heart to be back in her childhood home after two years. Everything looked almost the same as the day she left for college, but it didn\u2019t feel the same because she was the one who\u2019d changed.</p><p>Through that window, she used to secretly watch Harry return home from school everyday. In this bed, he used to hold her as they both fell asleep on nights when her parents were both out of town, and her irresponsible aunt didn\u2019t care if there was a boy in her room. On that desk, she\u2019d written countless pages about him,\u00a0<i>for</i>\u00a0him, that he might never get to read. She looked around this room and all she could see were their ghosts lurking in every single corner.</p><p>After all those years, the boy next door was still so far out of reach. And she was still the same fourteen-year-old pining over her older neighbor who didn\u2019t love her in return. That bitter truth made her eyes well up, but she was too old to live in Wonderland anymore. It was time for her to go back.</p><p>The new ringtone blasted from the old phone shocked Y/N to the point that she almost tossed her dad\u2019s Blackberry across the room. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t. She sighed in relief the second the name\u00a0Isey\u00a0appeared on the screen. Wiping away her tears, she pressed answer immediately.</p><p>\u201cH-Hi\u2026\u201d Y/N exhaled a nervous laugh, hoping he wasn\u2019t able to tell what a wreck she was. But he already knew that when he decided to call.</p><p><i>\u201cSmiley, are you okay? Where are you? Are you safe? Are you with someone?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Then the answer just appeared in her head on its own. Her smile faded soon as realization sank in. Her voice was soft and careful as she questioned, \u201cwhat did Harry tell you?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cThat you two got into a fight and you ran off in the storm.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N scoffed, looking down and shaking her head slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal really.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d She pursed her lips, trying to come up with a white lie good enough to convince him she was okay. \u201cWe just had a small disagreement and, yeah, like we always do. It\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI still think you should call him back,\u201d</i>\u00a0Isaac said. She could imagine the frown upon his face.<i>\u00a0\"He was so worried.\u201c</i></p><p>\"Hmm,\u201d she hummed, pressing her lips to form a straight line, not knowing what else to say.</p><p><i>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026in Holmes Chapel.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Hiding.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back for my father\u2019s wedding in two days.\u201d She chuckled nervously, eyes glancing at the spinning fan above her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about me.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause from Isaac\u2019s side when all she could hear was his soft yet heavy breathing. She wished she could tell him what had happened, but neither her heart nor her head agreed it was a good idea to confide in Harry\u2019s best friend. So she just sat in silence and waited for him to speak. Eventually, he did.</p><p><i>\u201cIf you\u2019re sad, just say so.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N nodded in response to those words, yet she soon realized that he couldn\u2019t see her so she quietly reassured him that she was fine. Though Isaac could probably tell she only said that so he would stop worrying about her, he was nice enough to not call her out for being a terrible liar.</p><p>\u201cLook, I gotta go now\u2026\u201d She said fast, her brows pinched together as her eyes squeezed shut. \u201cTalk to you another time?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cAlright.\"\u00a0</i>He let our a short breath.\u00a0<i>\"Have a great day, Smiley.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWait! One more thing!\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYeah?\u201d</i>\u00a0His light chuckle caused her to smile a bit.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell Harry I\u2019m here\u2026I\u2019m gonna talk to him myself when I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOkay.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cPromise.\u201d</i></p><p>Knowing that Isaac always kept his words, Y/N trusted him entirely as she muttered a goodbye and waited for him to hang up first.</p><p>She put her phone down, staring at the window where came the new daylight welcoming her back to the small town of Holmes Chapel. The girl smiled sadly as she curled up in a ball on her childhood bed, her eyes fell shut in an instant. The exhaustion caused her body to hang limp like wet laundry on a winter day, now every one of her muscles was giving into gravity.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she could feel the sorrow in her chest waiting to take over, yet the fear didn\u2019t seem to exist like many times before. She knew the feeling of losing someone she loved, physically, emotionally, or\u00a0<i>both</i>; and knowing it probably made it less scary. But what was worse than fear was the emptiness that followed when that someone was gone. She was learning how to deal with it, but slowly.</p></p>",

It started with teenage Harry throwing pebbles at his crush\u2019s window and getting chased by her father, to 24-year-old Harry picking up the call from the person he\u2019d been avoiding for months.</p><p>Though his number one advice to himself had always been: \u2019<i>if you\u2019re awake at two in the morning, just go to sleep\u2019,\u00a0</i>it was still something<i>\u00a0</i>he\u2019d never learnt.</p><p>Sitting in the swivel chair by the floor-to-ceiling window, Harry looked out at the city, one hand gripping the phone at his ear, the other subconsciously tapping on his knee. The woman on the phone was waiting for his reply, but what she wanted to hear wasn\u2019t what he could give.</p><p><i>\u201cH, say something.\u201d</i></p><p>A little part of him wanted to end the call and go back to bed where his present and possible future was expecting him, yet there he was, clinging onto the ghost of his past by prolonging that unnecessary conversation that was heading nowhere.</p><p><i>\u201cCan I\u2014\u201d</i>\u00a0Ruby spoke again when all she could hear was his ragged breathing.\u00a0<i>\u201cCan I just come over? I need to see you.\u201d</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI don't\u00a0<i>want</i>\u00a0to see you,\u201d he finally said. Judging by the sudden pause, he knew she was taken aback by that stone cold answer.</p><p><i>\u201cI broke things off with him. It\u2019s true this time.\u201d</i>\u00a0Her voice trembled just like how she\u2019d told him she would never leave him the night before she left. This might be another one of her easy lies. But why did he keep on listening instead of hanging up?</p><p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna make an official announcement soon. But I wanted you to hear it from me,\"\u00a0</i>she went on to fill in his silence.\u00a0<i>\"Baby, I-I know you won\u2019t believe me when I tell you this, but\u00a0</i><i>I love you</i><i>. I still do. As much as I did before. I\u2019m sorry I waited until now to finally end things with James. I guess I was just scared, but I\u2019m not scared anymore. Now I know what I want. And I want us.\u201d</i></p><p>That was exactly what Harry had wanted to hear a couple months ago. But everything was different now.</p><p>\u201cRubes,\u201d he whispered, eyes squeezed shut as his brows furrowed harder. The sound of her laugh used to take him to heaven, now it only dragged him to hell.</p><p><i>\u201cI missed your voice,\"\u00a0</i>Ruby said, funny how a smile could be heard through the phone.\u00a0<i>\"I miss you. Terribly.\u201d</i></p><p>He shook his head slowly, afterward smiling to himself as he remembered she couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p><i>\u201cPlease say something, H. Anything. Let me come see you.\u201d</i></p><p>His face contorted as she begged him in the most tragic tone he\u2019d ever heard. It was like cleaning your closet and trying to debate if you should throw away the t-shirt you used to love that didn\u2019t fit anymore. He wanted her to shut up, but at the same time, didn\u2019t have the heart to end the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI loved you a lot,\u201d he said at last, trying to steady his breathing when he heard her do the same. \u201cI guess\u2026you\u2019re always gonna mean something to me.\u201d</p><p>Ruby released a slight laugh as he took a pause.<i>\u00a0\"But?\u201c</i></p><p>He sighed in response to her voice crack, praying that she wouldn\u2019t burst into tears, for he wouldn\u2019t know how to cope with it. \"I can\u2019t do this again, Rubes. Go back to your fianc\u00e9. We\u2019re over.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t go back to the man I don\u2019t love.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou did once before. Sure you can do it again.\u201d He chuckled wryly. \u201cI-I\u2019m very sorry.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the woman he loved anymore. She was\u00a0<i>Ruby Ellis \u2014\u00a0</i>his co-star, an actress, a stranger. That was who she was to him from now on. And he knew better than to go back to her. However, for some reasons his heart ached to the thought of never hearing from her again after this call. Now he was so confused. What was it that he wanted?</p><p>Ruby didn\u2019t say anything, yet he could hear her quiet sobs which were slowly killing him. He pinched the bridge of his nose, holding his breath while waiting impatiently for her reply, which, sadly, never came.</p><p>The loud noise at the living room entrance caused his head to spin just in time Y/N caught the vase before it collided with the floor. Her big eyes stared straight at him, and his heart broke in reaction to her expression. Without reluctance, he ended the call with his ex-lover and rose from the chair, keeping eye-contact with Y/N as she took a few steps forward, eyes already filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cRuby?\u201d Her voice was strained. \u201cRuby Ellis? The actress?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded, eyes glued to the floor. Y/N held her head with both hands, trying to fight the battle of emotions inside her chest as she put two and two together.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019d been with her fianc\u00e9 for three years.\u201d It was more like her talking to herself than to him. \u201cDid she\u2026cheat on him with you?\u201d</p><p>Hurt and disbelief was etched on her face, but she still had to ask, expecting a different answer from the truth. However, Harry picked the worst time to finally be honest. He sucked in a breath, nodding his head and finally looking up to meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe had an affair, but\u2026it was more than that, at least for me. I was in love with her.\u201d Harry swallowed hard as he broke their eye-contact. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk away even though we\u2019d tried to call it quit endless of times. She told me she wasn\u2019t happy and that she was gonna leave him soon, and I was stupid enough to believe her\u2026until she left me.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s face fell fast. In that instant her skin became pale, her mouth hung with lips slightly parted and her eyes stretched wide.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d She almost choked on her own words, but he wasn\u2019t looking at her to see how broken she was. \u201cI told you everything about Blake. I trusted you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overreacting,\u201d he mumbled and turned away. Immediately, she marched straight towards him and clutched his elbow to force him to look at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat else are you hiding from me, Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cThe past is the past. Why are you digging into mine now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can\u2019t seem to let it go!\u201d Y/N shook her head fast. \u201cWe won\u2019t have a healthy relationship if you keep things like this from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re not in a relationship, are we?\u201d</p><p>Those words which got out on spur of the moment shocked her to the point that she let go of his arm and stumbled two steps back. Harry wasn\u2019t even thinking when he blurted out that sentence. He should\u2019ve stopped there. If only he\u2019d stopped.</p><p>\u201cYou're\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0my girlfriend, I don\u2019t have to tell you everything. Even if I\u2019d told you, you would\u2019ve judged me like you do now, just like everyone else!\u201d Harry raised his voice, apparently too out of his mind to even notice the fear in her glistened eyes.\u00a0\"You had <i>one</i> boyfriend and the break up wasn\u2019t even that bad. You don\u2019t <i>fucking</i> know how awful it feels to give someone everything you\u2019ve got, and still cannot compete with the person who doesn\u2019t love them.\u201c</p><p>Y/N stared into those green eyes burning with anger. Her heart fell silent.</p><p>\"Then how do you think I\u2019m feeling right now?\u201d</p><p>That question struck Harry like lighting. It was only then that warmth flooded back to his features. Once he saw tears streaming down her pretty face, his entire body went limp and the rapid beating of his heart echoed within his brain. The red mark on her cheek was there to remind him she\u2019d been hurt before, now it was him who caused her more damage. The second lesson that he had never learnt, was never to let anger do the talking.</p><p>\u201cBlake left me just a week before my mother died, then you came back, you kissed me and left me too\u2026Now put yourself in my shoes, H.\u00a0Just because your pain was different from mine, it doesn\u2019t mean you had it worse. I hurt too. I was depressed and starved myself for weeks\u2026Is that what you want to hear?\u201d<br></p><p>Trembling and afraid, Harry shook his head fast as he reached for her hands, but she shrugged him off to cover her face and muffle the heartbreaking sobs that were tearing him apart. Although she was standing right there, he couldn\u2019t help but feel like she was slipping through his fingers. He quickly clutched her arms, tears shone in his eyes yet she refused to look at him now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026I shouldn\u2019t\u2026I-I\u00a0don\u2019t love her anymore\u2026You have to trust me,\u201d he pleaded, tilting his head to catch a glimpse of her face. He watched her shoulders tremble with despair. Finally, she looked up, both pairs of tear-filled eyes staring at one another.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love me either.\u201d</p><p>Y/N could see that Harry was taken aback by those words so she gave him a nod to confirm the truth.</p><p>\u201cYes, I knew what I said, Harry.\u00a0<i>I love you</i>. I thought you just needed more time,\u201d she whispered, her brows drew closer together. \u201cBut now I know\u2026I can never compete with her.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s heart sank to the pit of his stomach as he heard those words. Y/N stood still, arms glued to her sides. She should feel affection when he held her face, not\u00a0<i>this</i>, not the discomfort of his cold palms against her skin. She wanted to push him away, but she didn\u2019t have any energy left to even flinch.</p><p>He shook his head fast, pressing their foreheads together. \u201cBambi, look at me\u2026You\u2019re not here to replace her.\u00a0I don\u2019t love her anymore.\u201d</p><p>When he repeated those words, she almost believed him.\u00a0<i>Almost</i>. But she couldn\u2019t. Not after what he\u2019d said on the phone. Not after what he\u2019d said to her when he lost his temper.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not what you meant.\u201d She exhaled sharply. \u201cShe still has a place in your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2026I\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026I just\u2014\u201d He tried to explain though the words that got out made absolutely no sense.</p><p>\u201cDid she leave you right before you came back for my mother\u2019s funeral?\u201d She cut him off, not wanting to be fed with more of his meaningless words. She just wanted solid proofs that she wasn\u2019t his rebound, yet there he was, looking startled and hesitating before nodding his head to confirm her fear was real.</p><p>\u201cWas she the one who called you after we kissed in the treehouse? The reason you were so eager to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt's\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes or no, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-Yes.\u201d</p><p>Now both of them were crying in front of one another. Y/N soon forgot about the mark on her cheek. Not a single slap could compare to this pain she must endure from hearing his confessions.</p><p>\u201cOne last question. And please be honest with me,\u201d she spoke with a breathy voice.\u00a0<i>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d</i></p><p>Silence.</p><p>Utter silence.</p><p>He could\u2019ve said no, and it would\u2019ve felt less insulting than him giving her silence and reluctance instead. She loved him so much that she wanted to justify for his reaction by saying he\u2019d been hurt before and was terrified by the idea of love,\u00a0<i>that</i>\u00a0she could understand. But weren\u2019t they both the same? She\u2019d been hurt too. She had every single reason to believe love didn\u2019t exist until she looked into his eyes. She had fought all that fear within her just to say those words to him, and\u00a0<i>meant</i>\u00a0it. If he couldn\u2019t fight for her, if he must have a second thought to decide how he should feel about her, then what was she still doing here?</p><p>Harry sucked in a breath when Y/N grabbed both of his hands and removed them from her face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like my dad.\u201d Her voice became as fragile as glass. \u201cI love you\u2026but if you don\u2019t love me back, you have to let me go.\u201d</p><p>When Y/N said those words, she did hope that he would change his mind. She did wait. But he didn\u2019t speak. And when her time for him had run out, she quietly went back to the bedroom. As for Harry, he was rooted to the spot, still trying to get grip on reality.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take too long until Y/N returned, now dressed in her own clothes and holding her handbag. He was still standing there, waiting for her to leave him instead of saying those words she\u2019d shrugged off all of her pride to say to him. His face was paler than her ever recalled it being, as if his blood was all shrinking away.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the door fell shut. And she was gone.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>When Y/N stumbled out on the street, her eyes flooded with tears and the first person she called was Celine. She just needed to talk to someone or else her heart might combust any minute now. She bit her nails while waiting for her best friend to pick up the phone. Though it took a bit longer than usual, she knew Celine would never miss any of her calls.</p><p><i>\u201cHey, baby! Wow, I was just about to call you. Talk about being soulmates!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cCece, I\u2014\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI hope you\u2019re sitting down right now because your girl has an announcement to make!\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N literally held her breath for that one second pause.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m engaged!\u201d</i></p><p>When Celine screamed the big news into the phone, her best friend from across the ocean was so shocked she couldn\u2019t make a sound. She stood like a corpse on the side of the road, tears in her eyes but she was too afraid her heartbreak would ruin her best friend\u2019s happy day.</p><p><i>\u201cY/N, are you still there?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N faked a laugh. The last thing she wanted was to make this about herself.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m just so happy for you two,\u201d she said, trying to sound as cheerful as she could pretend.</p><p><i>\u201cAww, my love! Gosh, I wish you were here with us.\"\u00a0</i>Celine giggled.\u00a0<i>\"Oh, why did you call by the way?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI just missed you, that\u2019s all.\u201d Y/N pressed her lips together, taking a deep breath. \u201cHey, something just came up, I gotta go now. I\u2019ll call you another time, yeah? Then we can spend hours talking about this.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOh, we certainly will! Love you, baby.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cLove you too, baby.\u201d</p><p>When that phone call came to an end, Y/N sank even deeper into depression.</p><p>How could it be?</p><p>In less than twelve hours,\u00a0<i>everything</i>\u00a0had been taken away from her. She had prided herself on being independent and laughed in the faces of the ones who needed the company of another to feel fulfill. Here she was, completely lost with no one to turn to, not even herself. So she kept on walking, letting her tears fall and her feet lead the way. Maybe when the sun rose in a few hours, everything would be alright.</p><p>If only it\u2019d been that easy.</p><p>The rain came without warning. It started our with little droplets, and the next second it was a torrential downpour, washing over her skin so strongly that it felt as if she was standing under a giant waterfall. Y/N didn\u2019t have an umbrella with her, so the only thing she could do was cover her head with the handbag and attempt to call a taxi on the phone. Due to unfortunate carelessness, the device slipped out of her grip and fell right into the puddle on the pavement, causing Y/N to literally scream out a curse word. There wasn\u2019t anyone around to think she was insane anyway.</p><p>The phone was dripping in rainwater when she picked it up, thus only magic could get it to work again. This time, instead of risking her life to run home, she dashed to find cover under a roof nearby, just in time two headlights appeared through the thick water curtain.</p><p>A car pulled over in front of Y/N. The familiar voice grabbed her attention right before she could recognize the person in the driver seat.</p><p>\u201cGet in!\u201d Marcy shouted as she tapped on the window.</p><p>This woman would be the last person Y/N wanted to be around at a moment like this, but she was given no other choice. It was either being safe in the car with the crazy person who\u2019d slapped her, or risking standing there and getting swept away by the thunderstorm. Any sane person would\u2019ve chosen the former in a heartbeat.</p><p>Immediately, Y/N got into the passenger seat and heaved a heavy sigh as she slammed the door shut, trying to catch her breath with her head back tossed back and eyes shut. Marcy quickly turned back to grab something from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She wrapped the huge blanket around Y/N\u2019s body, stroking both of her arms to keep her warm.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have a huge ass blanket in your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get cold easily.\u201d Marcy rolled her eyes, although she did find it amusing how Y/N was more shocked by the blanket, than the fact that she\u2019d showed up just in time to rescue her from the storm.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d Asked the blonde as she drove away in the rain, taking a quick glance at her future stepdaughter whose eyes were still shut, too lost in her own head to even hear that one-word question.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d Y/N asked once she\u2019d calmed down.</p><p>\u201cIt was pure luck I guess,\u201d replied Marcy. \u201cI was driving around the city looking for you, and when it began to rain I was about to give up, then I saw you on the side of the road.\u201d</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t say anything, instead turning her head to the left. Water droplets hit the car window as they drove onwards. She watched those raindrops race down, somehow finding a little bit of peace and calmness in the loud and chaotic storm.</p><p>Now that the heavy shower had washed away his scent on her body, she didn\u2019t want to go back anymore. She didn\u2019t even want to return to her flat where everywhere she looked reminded her of him. Now she had no other place to go but one.</p><p>\u201cAre you heading back to Holmes Chapel?\u201d She asked Marcy, who was taken aback by the sudden question.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026yeah, but I can drop you off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, staring at the road ahead instead of the woman in the driver seat. \u201cJust keep on driving.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry completely lost track of time, which seemed to fly faster as he was lost in his own thoughts. Maybe he would\u2019ve continued sitting there on his sofa and replaying Y/N\u2019s words over and over again in his head until he passed out from exhaustion, if the sound of thunder hadn\u2019t dragged him back to reality.</p><p>His head turned to the glass window when the rain started to pour. All that he could see was a thick curtain of water and the hazy city light hidden underneath it. His heart stopped for a second when he recalled the accident which left Y/N with a sprained ankle. He couldn\u2019t show up to help her then, now she was out in the rain because of him.</p><p>If something bad happened to her\u2026</p><p>Harry quickly rose up as the thought briefly crossed his mind, just in time his phone began to ring. The name\u00a0Ruby\u00a0appeared on the screen again, but this time, he didn\u2019t even care. It was funny and sad at the same time, how the moment of realization always came a bit too late.</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>Not until then did it occur to Harry that his Bambi had left him for good. He\u2019d officially lost her.</p><p>Now that she was gone, he missed her, he needed her, he worried about her. Now that he knew there was a high chance that he could never get her back, it felt as if he was bleeding internally. The pain couldn\u2019t compare to when Ruby left him, no, it was\u00a0<i>much</i>\u00a0worse. It tore his chest opened. If something bad happened to her tonight, how could he possibly live with himself?</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>Harry ran fast to his bedroom to throw on a pair of jeans and the t-shirt she\u2019d left on his bed, which still smelt like her. He returned to the living room and grabbed an umbrella before heading out as fast as possible. He rushed to the street, gasping for air as the raindrops hit his cold skin. Even with an umbrella above his head, Harry couldn\u2019t save his clothes from getting soaked just in less than a minute. But it was the least of his concerns now. He turned left, then right, mouth agape, eyebrows knitted together. There was not a single person or car in sight. Where was she? Where was his Bambi?</p><p>He dialed her number but he couldn\u2019t reach her. She either had him blocked or her phone turned off, whichever it was, he wasn\u2019t sure if she was safe, and he couldn\u2019t rest knowing she was somewhere out there in this pouring rain, all on her own.</p><p>He must go find her now.</p><p><i>What had he done?</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was a long drive back to Holmes Chapel, for no vehicle could go fast in this kind of weather. The more time it took the more uncomfortable it got for the two young women in this car.</p><p>Marcy inhaled deeply as she stole another glance at Y/N, who had been so quiet that Marcy felt like it would be a crime if she breathed a bit too loud. She thought it might be for the best if she just kept silent and her eyes on the road. However, it was hard to ignore the mark on Y/N\u2019s cheek. Although it looked better now than before, it reminded Marcy of what she\u2019d done. And she\u2019d been tormenting herself over it from the night before.</p><p>After a couple seconds of contemplating, she finally spoke up, \u201cAbout what happened in the store\u2026\u201d She paused to clear her throat. \u201cI-I\u2019m very sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Y/N cut her off, speaking in a monotone. The girl couldn\u2019t sound any less indifferent, not her usual aggressive and sarcastic tone. That was how Marcy knew it had a lot to do with the big reason behind her wanting to go back to Holmes Chapel. Marcy was just too afraid to ask.</p><p>\u201cAfter all,\u201d Y/N went on, this time sounding breathless. \u201cMy father was the one who took the ring from my mother, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Marcy sucked in a deep breath. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t take the ring back.\u201d</p><p>This time, Y/N finally turned to look at her, eyes broadened at once. Marcy kept her focus on the road, yet her expression hardened as if what she was about to say was going to be very brutal to the young girl sitting next to her.</p><p>\u201cOn the night of the accident, before your mother left, she gave it back to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father asked me not to tell you this but\u2026I think you deserve to know the truth.\u201d Marcy sighed, tightening her grip on the steering wheel. \u201cYour parents had planned on getting divorced two months prior to Tam\u2019s death. I-I had nothing to do with it, I don\u2019t even know the reason. It wasn\u2019t until after she\u2019d left that Brad and I began to grow feelings for each other. But everyone blames me for their fight, for her accident. I guess that was why I got so fed up with your attitude and\u2014\u201d Marcy blinked fast, shaking her head in guilt. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to justify my action, because I know it was wrong. But I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you on purpose.\u201d</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t expect any of that. Besides the divorce, nothing else seemed to make sense. Why did her mother take off the ring that she loved more than herself? What was it that they were arguing about that night?</p><p>She had hoped that Marcy was just lying, yet for someone with such a troubled past, she would be able to tell if someone was spilling out lies. Therefore she was sure Marcy had said exactly what she knew. Now Y/N felt like she knew nothing at all, not even her mother, the one she loved most.</p><p>\u201cYou should take a nap. I\u2019ll wake you up when we\u2019re almost home,\u201d Marcy said with a smile.</p><p>Now that the rain was over, the sky glowed like a summer peach and the sun slowly emerged from the skyline as tall buildings rose out of darkness. Y/N\u2019s heart was at peace once again, knowing she would be\u00a0<i>home</i>\u00a0soon.</p><p>But as she closed her eyes to get some rest, all that she could see was\u00a0<i>him</i>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cBambi! Please, open the door if you\u2019re in there!\u201d Harry knocked more urgently this time as he tried to catch his breath and fight back the tears. His voice was hoarse from pleading for her to let him in. It had been a while, and now he began to think she wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>The first golden light of the new day snuck through the little window near the ceiling into the hallway, blinding Harry for a second as if to let him know that the sun had come once again. How often we saw the dawn and took it for granted, that when darkness took over we suddenly craved for the light and the life it brought to our world? Same as Y/N. Now that she was gone, he finally realized what he\u2019d lost.</p><p>Harry sat down on the floor with his back against her front door, head in his hands. Their last conversation soon came back to haunt him, and so was the look on her face when he let her go. He knew he deserved that. He was unworthy of her love. But now that he\u2019d lost his ray of sunshine, how could he live with this cold?</p><p>In just a minute, Harry\u2019s eyes dripped with tears as he gazed toward the window above, as if the light could soothe him. His face twisted and his fists clenched so tight he could feel the sweat trapped inside them. He looked like the same distressed little boy who\u2019d lost the stuffed bunny\u00a0<i>and</i>\u00a0the girl he loved. It would take more than a black eye and losing his captain armband to win her back this time.</p><p>But right now, he just wanted to know if she was safe. He wiped his tears and pulled out his phone, quickly making a call to the only person he knew would be able to help.</p><p><i>\u201cHello?\u201d</i>\u00a0Isaac answered after five seconds. His sleepy voice was evident that he was barely awake.</p><p>\u201cMate\u2026did Y/N come to you, or at least contact you?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cNo. What\u2019s wrong? Did something happen to her?\"\u00a0</i>Just like him, his best friend sounded overly distraught.</p><p>\"We had a fight and she ran off in the rain and\u2026I\u2019m right outside her place right now but she\u2019s not home yet.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cShe didn\u2019t answer your calls?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry sighed, combing his fingers through his hair. \u201cMaybe if you call her, she\u2019ll pick up.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll text you if I know where she is.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cThank you. I-I appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>Isaac hummed as a reply, and hung up the phone. Harry sat there with his head tossed back, resting against the door, his eyes on the ceiling. Now he was too stressed to even get on with his day and act like nothing was wrong when\u00a0<i>everything</i>\u00a0was. But if he continued to sit there for too long, one of Y/N\u2019s neighbors might report him, or even worse, someone could start a false rumor that might damage her reputation. Sighing, he pushed himself off the floor to stand up straight, one palm pressed against the wall to keep his balance.</p><p>\u201cHey you!\u201d</p><p>When Harry heard that voice, his head jerked in its direction where he found an old lady walking up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHi, ma'am,\u201d he mumbled, pressing his lips into a small smile as she approached him. But the woman couldn\u2019t look more irritated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating the girl in that flat, right?\u201d</p><p>Harry parted his lips, not knowing how to answer, but he assumed the old woman must be Mrs. Huang, the angry neighbor who kept complaining about him and Y/N having sex a bit too loud. She didn\u2019t even need a response him him, and just went straight into the point, handing him the pink notebook which he hadn\u2019t noticed that she\u2019d been holding until now.</p><p>\u201cShe dropped this yesterday. Maybe you can give it back to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026thank you.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Huang eyed at the young man from head to toes, making him think she might begin to lecture him on how to not disturb the neighbors. However, what she said to him was this.</p><p>\u201cEver since you came around, I\u2019ve seen her sing a different song everyday when she leaves the building. As annoying as she might be sometimes, that girl seems to be head over heels for you.\u201d Then the woman sighed happily, her wrinkles became more visible now that she was smiling at him. \u201cI miss being young and in love with someone. Hold onto it while you still can, alright?\u201d</p><p>When Mrs. Huang patted him on the arm and returned to her home, Harry looked down at the pink notebook in his hand. And in a few seconds, all the memories flooded back and the different images of her beautiful smile flashed right through his mind. At that moment, he realized, the goodbye wasn\u2019t supposed to be the hardest part, it was the flashbacks that followed right after.</p><p>Every single day he\u2019d spent with Ruby had been filled with fear and anxiety, which he\u2019d mistook for passion. But Y/N was his medicine. When he was with her, the pain stopped. She made him feel safe even though their relationship had never been solid, and with her he could get away from the chaotic of his world to find real peace.</p><p>After getting soaked in the rain, his old t-shirt no longer smelt like his Bambi, which meant he had nothing left of her to keep, not even her scent. Now he missed her with a pain in his guts like fire burning slow.</p><p>Had he been brave enough to just face his fear and accept the fact that it was love. It wasn\u2019t anything like the love he\u2019d had for Ruby, but it\u00a0<i>was</i>\u00a0love. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have trembled every time she called his name, his knees wouldn\u2019t have gone weak every time he caught her smiling at him, he wouldn\u2019t have spent most of the time during a day thinking, fantasizing, daydreaming about her.</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t love, what else could it be?</p><p>In his heart he retracted all the terrible things he had said to her. He\u2019d learnt his lessons the hard way, but not soon enough for the two of them.<br></p><p>.<br></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cYour sim card is okay, but I\u2019m gonna have to take your phone to the repair store. Meanwhile, you can use my old Blackberry, it still works pretty damn fine.\u201d</p><p>Y/N pressed her lips into a small smile as she took the phone from her dad, sitting down on the edge of her bed with a blanket wrapped around her now dry and warm body. Bradford stood there for a moment to make sure his daughter didn\u2019t need anything else. He was debating with himself whether or not he should ask about why she\u2019d come back. But once he saw the look on her face as she acted busy with the device, he took it as a cue to leave her alone for now.</p><p>Once her bedroom door was shut, Y/N finally lifted her eyes as sadness clouded her features at once. She carefully looked around the room. There was a strange melancholy feeling in her heart to be back in her childhood home after two years. Everything looked almost the same as the day she left for college, but it didn\u2019t feel the same because she was the one who\u2019d changed.</p><p>Through that window, she used to secretly watch Harry return home from school everyday. In this bed, he used to hold her as they both fell asleep on nights when her parents were both out of town, and her irresponsible aunt didn\u2019t care if there was a boy in her room. On that desk, she\u2019d written countless pages about him,\u00a0<i>for</i>\u00a0him, that he might never get to read. She looked around this room and all she could see were their ghosts lurking in every single corner.</p><p>After all those years, the boy next door was still so far out of reach. And she was still the same fourteen-year-old pining over her older neighbor who didn\u2019t love her in return. That bitter truth made her eyes well up, but she was too old to live in Wonderland anymore. It was time for her to go back.</p><p>The new ringtone blasted from the old phone shocked Y/N to the point that she almost tossed her dad\u2019s Blackberry across the room. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t. She sighed in relief the second the name\u00a0Isey\u00a0appeared on the screen. Wiping away her tears, she pressed answer immediately.</p><p>\u201cH-Hi\u2026\u201d Y/N exhaled a nervous laugh, hoping he wasn\u2019t able to tell what a wreck she was. But he already knew that when he decided to call.</p><p><i>\u201cSmiley, are you okay? Where are you? Are you safe? Are you with someone?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Then the answer just appeared in her head on its own. Her smile faded soon as realization sank in. Her voice was soft and careful as she questioned, \u201cwhat did Harry tell you?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cThat you two got into a fight and you ran off in the storm.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N scoffed, looking down and shaking her head slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal really.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d She pursed her lips, trying to come up with a white lie good enough to convince him she was okay. \u201cWe just had a small disagreement and, yeah, like we always do. It\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI still think you should call him back,\u201d</i>\u00a0Isaac said. She could imagine the frown upon his face.<i>\u00a0\"He was so worried.\u201c</i></p><p>\"Hmm,\u201d she hummed, pressing her lips to form a straight line, not knowing what else to say.</p><p><i>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026in Holmes Chapel.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Hiding.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back for my father\u2019s wedding in two days.\u201d She chuckled nervously, eyes glancing at the spinning fan above her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about me.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause from Isaac\u2019s side when all she could hear was his soft yet heavy breathing. She wished she could tell him what had happened, but neither her heart nor her head agreed it was a good idea to confide in Harry\u2019s best friend. So she just sat in silence and waited for him to speak. Eventually, he did.</p><p><i>\u201cIf you\u2019re sad, just say so.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N nodded in response to those words, yet she soon realized that he couldn\u2019t see her so she quietly reassured him that she was fine. Though Isaac could probably tell she only said that so he would stop worrying about her, he was nice enough to not call her out for being a terrible liar.</p><p>\u201cLook, I gotta go now\u2026\u201d She said fast, her brows pinched together as her eyes squeezed shut. \u201cTalk to you another time?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cAlright.\"\u00a0</i>He let our a short breath.\u00a0<i>\"Have a great day, Smiley.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWait! One more thing!\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYeah?\u201d</i>\u00a0His light chuckle caused her to smile a bit.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell Harry I\u2019m here\u2026I\u2019m gonna talk to him myself when I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOkay.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cPromise.\u201d</i></p><p>Knowing that Isaac always kept his words, Y/N trusted him entirely as she muttered a goodbye and waited for him to hang up first.</p><p>She put her phone down, staring at the window where came the new daylight welcoming her back to the small town of Holmes Chapel. The girl smiled sadly as she curled up in a ball on her childhood bed, her eyes fell shut in an instant. The exhaustion caused her body to hang limp like wet laundry on a winter day, now every one of her muscles was giving into gravity.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she could feel the sorrow in her chest waiting to take over, yet the fear didn\u2019t seem to exist like many times before. She knew the feeling of losing someone she loved, physically, emotionally, or\u00a0<i>both</i>; and knowing it probably made it less scary. But what was worse than fear was the emptiness that followed when that someone was gone. She was learning how to deal with it, but slowly.</p></p>",

It started with teenage Harry throwing pebbles at his crush&rsquo;s window and getting chased by her father, to 24-year-old Harry picking up the call from the person he&rsquo;d been avoiding for months.</p><p>Though his number one advice to himself had always been: &rsquo;<i>if you&rsquo;re awake at two in the morning, just go to sleep&rsquo;,&nbsp;</i>it was still something<i>&nbsp;</i>he&rsquo;d never learnt.</p><p>Sitting in the swivel chair by the floor-to-ceiling window, Harry looked out at the city, one hand gripping the phone at his ear, the other subconsciously tapping on his knee. The woman on the phone was waiting for his reply, but what she wanted to hear wasn&rsquo;t what he could give.</p><p><i>&ldquo;H, say something.&rdquo;</i></p><p>A little part of him wanted to end the call and go back to bed where his present and possible future was expecting him, yet there he was, clinging onto the ghost of his past by prolonging that unnecessary conversation that was heading nowhere.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Can I&mdash;&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;Ruby spoke again when all she could hear was his ragged breathing.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Can I just come over? I need to see you.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I don't&nbsp;<i>want</i>&nbsp;to see you,&rdquo; he finally said. Judging by the sudden pause, he knew she was taken aback by that stone cold answer.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I broke things off with him. It&rsquo;s true this time.&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;Her voice trembled just like how she&rsquo;d told him she would never leave him the night before she left. This might be another one of her easy lies. But why did he keep on listening instead of hanging up?</p><p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna make an official announcement soon. But I wanted you to hear it from me,\"&nbsp;</i>she went on to fill in his silence.&nbsp;<i>\"Baby, I-I know you won&rsquo;t believe me when I tell you this, but&nbsp;</i><i>I love you</i><i>. I still do. As much as I did before. I&rsquo;m sorry I waited until now to finally end things with James. I guess I was just scared, but I&rsquo;m not scared anymore. Now I know what I want. And I want us.&rdquo;</i></p><p>That was exactly what Harry had wanted to hear a couple months ago. But everything was different now.</p><p>&ldquo;Rubes,&rdquo; he whispered, eyes squeezed shut as his brows furrowed harder. The sound of her laugh used to take him to heaven, now it only dragged him to hell.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I missed your voice,\"&nbsp;</i>Ruby said, funny how a smile could be heard through the phone.&nbsp;<i>\"I miss you. Terribly.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He shook his head slowly, afterward smiling to himself as he remembered she couldn&rsquo;t see him.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Please say something, H. Anything. Let me come see you.&rdquo;</i></p><p>His face contorted as she begged him in the most tragic tone he&rsquo;d ever heard. It was like cleaning your closet and trying to debate if you should throw away the t-shirt you used to love that didn&rsquo;t fit anymore. He wanted her to shut up, but at the same time, didn&rsquo;t have the heart to end the conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;I loved you a lot,&rdquo; he said at last, trying to steady his breathing when he heard her do the same. &ldquo;I guess&hellip;you&rsquo;re always gonna mean something to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Ruby released a slight laugh as he took a pause.<i>&nbsp;\"But?&ldquo;</i></p><p>He sighed in response to her voice crack, praying that she wouldn&rsquo;t burst into tears, for he wouldn&rsquo;t know how to cope with it. \"I can&rsquo;t do this again, Rubes. Go back to your fianc&eacute;. We&rsquo;re over.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go back to the man I don&rsquo;t love.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;You did once before. Sure you can do it again.&rdquo; He chuckled wryly. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m very sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t the woman he loved anymore. She was&nbsp;<i>Ruby Ellis &mdash;&nbsp;</i>his co-star, an actress, a stranger. That was who she was to him from now on. And he knew better than to go back to her. However, for some reasons his heart ached to the thought of never hearing from her again after this call. Now he was so confused. What was it that he wanted?</p><p>Ruby didn&rsquo;t say anything, yet he could hear her quiet sobs which were slowly killing him. He pinched the bridge of his nose, holding his breath while waiting impatiently for her reply, which, sadly, never came.</p><p>The loud noise at the living room entrance caused his head to spin just in time Y/N caught the vase before it collided with the floor. Her big eyes stared straight at him, and his heart broke in reaction to her expression. Without reluctance, he ended the call with his ex-lover and rose from the chair, keeping eye-contact with Y/N as she took a few steps forward, eyes already filled with tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Ruby?&rdquo; Her voice was strained. &ldquo;Ruby Ellis? The actress?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry nodded, eyes glued to the floor. Y/N held her head with both hands, trying to fight the battle of emotions inside her chest as she put two and two together.</p><p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;d been with her fianc&eacute; for three years.&rdquo; It was more like her talking to herself than to him. &ldquo;Did she&hellip;cheat on him with you?&rdquo;</p><p>Hurt and disbelief was etched on her face, but she still had to ask, expecting a different answer from the truth. However, Harry picked the worst time to finally be honest. He sucked in a breath, nodding his head and finally looking up to meet her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;We had an affair, but&hellip;it was more than that, at least for me. I was in love with her.&rdquo; Harry swallowed hard as he broke their eye-contact. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t walk away even though we&rsquo;d tried to call it quit endless of times. She told me she wasn&rsquo;t happy and that she was gonna leave him soon, and I was stupid enough to believe her&hellip;until she left me.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s face fell fast. In that instant her skin became pale, her mouth hung with lips slightly parted and her eyes stretched wide.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; She almost choked on her own words, but he wasn&rsquo;t looking at her to see how broken she was. &ldquo;I told you everything about Blake. I trusted you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re overreacting,&rdquo; he mumbled and turned away. Immediately, she marched straight towards him and clutched his elbow to force him to look at her.</p><p>&ldquo;What else are you hiding from me, Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; He scoffed. &ldquo;The past is the past. Why are you digging into mine now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because you can&rsquo;t seem to let it go!&rdquo; Y/N shook her head fast. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have a healthy relationship if you keep things like this from me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not in a relationship, are we?&rdquo;</p><p>Those words which got out on spur of the moment shocked her to the point that she let go of his arm and stumbled two steps back. Harry wasn&rsquo;t even thinking when he blurted out that sentence. He should&rsquo;ve stopped there. If only he&rsquo;d stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;You're&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;my girlfriend, I don&rsquo;t have to tell you everything. Even if I&rsquo;d told you, you would&rsquo;ve judged me like you do now, just like everyone else!&rdquo; Harry raised his voice, apparently too out of his mind to even notice the fear in her glistened eyes.&nbsp;\"You had <i>one</i> boyfriend and the break up wasn&rsquo;t even that bad. You don&rsquo;t <i>fucking</i> know how awful it feels to give someone everything you&rsquo;ve got, and still cannot compete with the person who doesn&rsquo;t love them.&ldquo;</p><p>Y/N stared into those green eyes burning with anger. Her heart fell silent.</p><p>\"Then how do you think I&rsquo;m feeling right now?&rdquo;</p><p>That question struck Harry like lighting. It was only then that warmth flooded back to his features. Once he saw tears streaming down her pretty face, his entire body went limp and the rapid beating of his heart echoed within his brain. The red mark on her cheek was there to remind him she&rsquo;d been hurt before, now it was him who caused her more damage. The second lesson that he had never learnt, was never to let anger do the talking.</p><p>&ldquo;Blake left me just a week before my mother died, then you came back, you kissed me and left me too&hellip;Now put yourself in my shoes, H.&nbsp;Just because your pain was different from mine, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you had it worse. I hurt too. I was depressed and starved myself for weeks&hellip;Is that what you want to hear?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Trembling and afraid, Harry shook his head fast as he reached for her hands, but she shrugged him off to cover her face and muffle the heartbreaking sobs that were tearing him apart. Although she was standing right there, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like she was slipping through his fingers. He quickly clutched her arms, tears shone in his eyes yet she refused to look at him now.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry&hellip;I shouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;I-I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t love her anymore&hellip;You have to trust me,&rdquo; he pleaded, tilting his head to catch a glimpse of her face. He watched her shoulders tremble with despair. Finally, she looked up, both pairs of tear-filled eyes staring at one another.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t love me either.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N could see that Harry was taken aback by those words so she gave him a nod to confirm the truth.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew what I said, Harry.&nbsp;<i>I love you</i>. I thought you just needed more time,&rdquo; she whispered, her brows drew closer together. &ldquo;But now I know&hellip;I can never compete with her.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s heart sank to the pit of his stomach as he heard those words. Y/N stood still, arms glued to her sides. She should feel affection when he held her face, not&nbsp;<i>this</i>, not the discomfort of his cold palms against her skin. She wanted to push him away, but she didn&rsquo;t have any energy left to even flinch.</p><p>He shook his head fast, pressing their foreheads together. &ldquo;Bambi, look at me&hellip;You&rsquo;re not here to replace her.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t love her anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>When he repeated those words, she almost believed him.&nbsp;<i>Almost</i>. But she couldn&rsquo;t. Not after what he&rsquo;d said on the phone. Not after what he&rsquo;d said to her when he lost his temper.</p><p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not what you meant.&rdquo; She exhaled sharply. &ldquo;She still has a place in your heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&hellip;I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t&hellip;I just&mdash;&rdquo; He tried to explain though the words that got out made absolutely no sense.</p><p>&ldquo;Did she leave you right before you came back for my mother&rsquo;s funeral?&rdquo; She cut him off, not wanting to be fed with more of his meaningless words. She just wanted solid proofs that she wasn&rsquo;t his rebound, yet there he was, looking startled and hesitating before nodding his head to confirm her fear was real.</p><p>&ldquo;Was she the one who called you after we kissed in the treehouse? The reason you were so eager to leave?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It's&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes or no, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Now both of them were crying in front of one another. Y/N soon forgot about the mark on her cheek. Not a single slap could compare to this pain she must endure from hearing his confessions.</p><p>&ldquo;One last question. And please be honest with me,&rdquo; she spoke with a breathy voice.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Silence.</p><p>Utter silence.</p><p>He could&rsquo;ve said no, and it would&rsquo;ve felt less insulting than him giving her silence and reluctance instead. She loved him so much that she wanted to justify for his reaction by saying he&rsquo;d been hurt before and was terrified by the idea of love,&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;she could understand. But weren&rsquo;t they both the same? She&rsquo;d been hurt too. She had every single reason to believe love didn&rsquo;t exist until she looked into his eyes. She had fought all that fear within her just to say those words to him, and&nbsp;<i>meant</i>&nbsp;it. If he couldn&rsquo;t fight for her, if he must have a second thought to decide how he should feel about her, then what was she still doing here?</p><p>Harry sucked in a breath when Y/N grabbed both of his hands and removed them from her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be like my dad.&rdquo; Her voice became as fragile as glass. &ldquo;I love you&hellip;but if you don&rsquo;t love me back, you have to let me go.&rdquo;</p><p>When Y/N said those words, she did hope that he would change his mind. She did wait. But he didn&rsquo;t speak. And when her time for him had run out, she quietly went back to the bedroom. As for Harry, he was rooted to the spot, still trying to get grip on reality.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take too long until Y/N returned, now dressed in her own clothes and holding her handbag. He was still standing there, waiting for her to leave him instead of saying those words she&rsquo;d shrugged off all of her pride to say to him. His face was paler than her ever recalled it being, as if his blood was all shrinking away.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the door fell shut. And she was gone.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>When Y/N stumbled out on the street, her eyes flooded with tears and the first person she called was Celine. She just needed to talk to someone or else her heart might combust any minute now. She bit her nails while waiting for her best friend to pick up the phone. Though it took a bit longer than usual, she knew Celine would never miss any of her calls.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, baby! Wow, I was just about to call you. Talk about being soulmates!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Cece, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re sitting down right now because your girl has an announcement to make!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N literally held her breath for that one second pause.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m engaged!&rdquo;</i></p><p>When Celine screamed the big news into the phone, her best friend from across the ocean was so shocked she couldn&rsquo;t make a sound. She stood like a corpse on the side of the road, tears in her eyes but she was too afraid her heartbreak would ruin her best friend&rsquo;s happy day.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N, are you still there?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you crying?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N faked a laugh. The last thing she wanted was to make this about herself.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;m just so happy for you two,&rdquo; she said, trying to sound as cheerful as she could pretend.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Aww, my love! Gosh, I wish you were here with us.\"&nbsp;</i>Celine giggled.&nbsp;<i>\"Oh, why did you call by the way?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I just missed you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Y/N pressed her lips together, taking a deep breath. &ldquo;Hey, something just came up, I gotta go now. I&rsquo;ll call you another time, yeah? Then we can spend hours talking about this.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, we certainly will! Love you, baby.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Love you too, baby.&rdquo;</p><p>When that phone call came to an end, Y/N sank even deeper into depression.</p><p>How could it be?</p><p>In less than twelve hours,&nbsp;<i>everything</i>&nbsp;had been taken away from her. She had prided herself on being independent and laughed in the faces of the ones who needed the company of another to feel fulfill. Here she was, completely lost with no one to turn to, not even herself. So she kept on walking, letting her tears fall and her feet lead the way. Maybe when the sun rose in a few hours, everything would be alright.</p><p>If only it&rsquo;d been that easy.</p><p>The rain came without warning. It started our with little droplets, and the next second it was a torrential downpour, washing over her skin so strongly that it felt as if she was standing under a giant waterfall. Y/N didn&rsquo;t have an umbrella with her, so the only thing she could do was cover her head with the handbag and attempt to call a taxi on the phone. Due to unfortunate carelessness, the device slipped out of her grip and fell right into the puddle on the pavement, causing Y/N to literally scream out a curse word. There wasn&rsquo;t anyone around to think she was insane anyway.</p><p>The phone was dripping in rainwater when she picked it up, thus only magic could get it to work again. This time, instead of risking her life to run home, she dashed to find cover under a roof nearby, just in time two headlights appeared through the thick water curtain.</p><p>A car pulled over in front of Y/N. The familiar voice grabbed her attention right before she could recognize the person in the driver seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Get in!&rdquo; Marcy shouted as she tapped on the window.</p><p>This woman would be the last person Y/N wanted to be around at a moment like this, but she was given no other choice. It was either being safe in the car with the crazy person who&rsquo;d slapped her, or risking standing there and getting swept away by the thunderstorm. Any sane person would&rsquo;ve chosen the former in a heartbeat.</p><p>Immediately, Y/N got into the passenger seat and heaved a heavy sigh as she slammed the door shut, trying to catch her breath with her head back tossed back and eyes shut. Marcy quickly turned back to grab something from the backseat.</p><p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; She wrapped the huge blanket around Y/N&rsquo;s body, stroking both of her arms to keep her warm.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have a huge ass blanket in your car?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I get cold easily.&rdquo; Marcy rolled her eyes, although she did find it amusing how Y/N was more shocked by the blanket, than the fact that she&rsquo;d showed up just in time to rescue her from the storm.</p><p>&ldquo;Better?&rdquo; Asked the blonde as she drove away in the rain, taking a quick glance at her future stepdaughter whose eyes were still shut, too lost in her own head to even hear that one-word question.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you find me?&rdquo; Y/N asked once she&rsquo;d calmed down.</p><p>&ldquo;It was pure luck I guess,&rdquo; replied Marcy. &ldquo;I was driving around the city looking for you, and when it began to rain I was about to give up, then I saw you on the side of the road.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t say anything, instead turning her head to the left. Water droplets hit the car window as they drove onwards. She watched those raindrops race down, somehow finding a little bit of peace and calmness in the loud and chaotic storm.</p><p>Now that the heavy shower had washed away his scent on her body, she didn&rsquo;t want to go back anymore. She didn&rsquo;t even want to return to her flat where everywhere she looked reminded her of him. Now she had no other place to go but one.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you heading back to Holmes Chapel?&rdquo; She asked Marcy, who was taken aback by the sudden question.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;yeah, but I can drop you off&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She shook her head, staring at the road ahead instead of the woman in the driver seat. &ldquo;Just keep on driving.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry completely lost track of time, which seemed to fly faster as he was lost in his own thoughts. Maybe he would&rsquo;ve continued sitting there on his sofa and replaying Y/N&rsquo;s words over and over again in his head until he passed out from exhaustion, if the sound of thunder hadn&rsquo;t dragged him back to reality.</p><p>His head turned to the glass window when the rain started to pour. All that he could see was a thick curtain of water and the hazy city light hidden underneath it. His heart stopped for a second when he recalled the accident which left Y/N with a sprained ankle. He couldn&rsquo;t show up to help her then, now she was out in the rain because of him.</p><p>If something bad happened to her&hellip;</p><p>Harry quickly rose up as the thought briefly crossed his mind, just in time his phone began to ring. The name&nbsp;Ruby&nbsp;appeared on the screen again, but this time, he didn&rsquo;t even care. It was funny and sad at the same time, how the moment of realization always came a bit too late.</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>Not until then did it occur to Harry that his Bambi had left him for good. He&rsquo;d officially lost her.</p><p>Now that she was gone, he missed her, he needed her, he worried about her. Now that he knew there was a high chance that he could never get her back, it felt as if he was bleeding internally. The pain couldn&rsquo;t compare to when Ruby left him, no, it was&nbsp;<i>much</i>&nbsp;worse. It tore his chest opened. If something bad happened to her tonight, how could he possibly live with himself?</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>Harry ran fast to his bedroom to throw on a pair of jeans and the t-shirt she&rsquo;d left on his bed, which still smelt like her. He returned to the living room and grabbed an umbrella before heading out as fast as possible. He rushed to the street, gasping for air as the raindrops hit his cold skin. Even with an umbrella above his head, Harry couldn&rsquo;t save his clothes from getting soaked just in less than a minute. But it was the least of his concerns now. He turned left, then right, mouth agape, eyebrows knitted together. There was not a single person or car in sight. Where was she? Where was his Bambi?</p><p>He dialed her number but he couldn&rsquo;t reach her. She either had him blocked or her phone turned off, whichever it was, he wasn&rsquo;t sure if she was safe, and he couldn&rsquo;t rest knowing she was somewhere out there in this pouring rain, all on her own.</p><p>He must go find her now.</p><p><i>What had he done?</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It was a long drive back to Holmes Chapel, for no vehicle could go fast in this kind of weather. The more time it took the more uncomfortable it got for the two young women in this car.</p><p>Marcy inhaled deeply as she stole another glance at Y/N, who had been so quiet that Marcy felt like it would be a crime if she breathed a bit too loud. She thought it might be for the best if she just kept silent and her eyes on the road. However, it was hard to ignore the mark on Y/N&rsquo;s cheek. Although it looked better now than before, it reminded Marcy of what she&rsquo;d done. And she&rsquo;d been tormenting herself over it from the night before.</p><p>After a couple seconds of contemplating, she finally spoke up, &ldquo;About what happened in the store&hellip;&rdquo; She paused to clear her throat. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m very sorry. I shouldn&rsquo;t have&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; Y/N cut her off, speaking in a monotone. The girl couldn&rsquo;t sound any less indifferent, not her usual aggressive and sarcastic tone. That was how Marcy knew it had a lot to do with the big reason behind her wanting to go back to Holmes Chapel. Marcy was just too afraid to ask.</p><p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; Y/N went on, this time sounding breathless. &ldquo;My father was the one who took the ring from my mother, not you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Marcy sucked in a deep breath. &ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t take the ring back.&rdquo;</p><p>This time, Y/N finally turned to look at her, eyes broadened at once. Marcy kept her focus on the road, yet her expression hardened as if what she was about to say was going to be very brutal to the young girl sitting next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;On the night of the accident, before your mother left, she gave it back to him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;W-What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your father asked me not to tell you this but&hellip;I think you deserve to know the truth.&rdquo; Marcy sighed, tightening her grip on the steering wheel. &ldquo;Your parents had planned on getting divorced two months prior to Tam&rsquo;s death. I-I had nothing to do with it, I don&rsquo;t even know the reason. It wasn&rsquo;t until after she&rsquo;d left that Brad and I began to grow feelings for each other. But everyone blames me for their fight, for her accident. I guess that was why I got so fed up with your attitude and&mdash;&rdquo; Marcy blinked fast, shaking her head in guilt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to justify my action, because I know it was wrong. But I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you on purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t expect any of that. Besides the divorce, nothing else seemed to make sense. Why did her mother take off the ring that she loved more than herself? What was it that they were arguing about that night?</p><p>She had hoped that Marcy was just lying, yet for someone with such a troubled past, she would be able to tell if someone was spilling out lies. Therefore she was sure Marcy had said exactly what she knew. Now Y/N felt like she knew nothing at all, not even her mother, the one she loved most.</p><p>&ldquo;You should take a nap. I&rsquo;ll wake you up when we&rsquo;re almost home,&rdquo; Marcy said with a smile.</p><p>Now that the rain was over, the sky glowed like a summer peach and the sun slowly emerged from the skyline as tall buildings rose out of darkness. Y/N&rsquo;s heart was at peace once again, knowing she would be&nbsp;<i>home</i>&nbsp;soon.</p><p>But as she closed her eyes to get some rest, all that she could see was&nbsp;<i>him</i>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Bambi! Please, open the door if you&rsquo;re in there!&rdquo; Harry knocked more urgently this time as he tried to catch his breath and fight back the tears. His voice was hoarse from pleading for her to let him in. It had been a while, and now he began to think she wasn&rsquo;t there.</p><p>The first golden light of the new day snuck through the little window near the ceiling into the hallway, blinding Harry for a second as if to let him know that the sun had come once again. How often we saw the dawn and took it for granted, that when darkness took over we suddenly craved for the light and the life it brought to our world? Same as Y/N. Now that she was gone, he finally realized what he&rsquo;d lost.</p><p>Harry sat down on the floor with his back against her front door, head in his hands. Their last conversation soon came back to haunt him, and so was the look on her face when he let her go. He knew he deserved that. He was unworthy of her love. But now that he&rsquo;d lost his ray of sunshine, how could he live with this cold?</p><p>In just a minute, Harry&rsquo;s eyes dripped with tears as he gazed toward the window above, as if the light could soothe him. His face twisted and his fists clenched so tight he could feel the sweat trapped inside them. He looked like the same distressed little boy who&rsquo;d lost the stuffed bunny&nbsp;<i>and</i>&nbsp;the girl he loved. It would take more than a black eye and losing his captain armband to win her back this time.</p><p>But right now, he just wanted to know if she was safe. He wiped his tears and pulled out his phone, quickly making a call to the only person he knew would be able to help.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;Isaac answered after five seconds. His sleepy voice was evident that he was barely awake.</p><p>&ldquo;Mate&hellip;did Y/N come to you, or at least contact you?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;No. What&rsquo;s wrong? Did something happen to her?\"&nbsp;</i>Just like him, his best friend sounded overly distraught.</p><p>\"We had a fight and she ran off in the rain and&hellip;I&rsquo;m right outside her place right now but she&rsquo;s not home yet.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t answer your calls?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Harry sighed, combing his fingers through his hair. &ldquo;Maybe if you call her, she&rsquo;ll pick up.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll text you if I know where she is.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. I-I appreciate that.&rdquo;</p><p>Isaac hummed as a reply, and hung up the phone. Harry sat there with his head tossed back, resting against the door, his eyes on the ceiling. Now he was too stressed to even get on with his day and act like nothing was wrong when&nbsp;<i>everything</i>&nbsp;was. But if he continued to sit there for too long, one of Y/N&rsquo;s neighbors might report him, or even worse, someone could start a false rumor that might damage her reputation. Sighing, he pushed himself off the floor to stand up straight, one palm pressed against the wall to keep his balance.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey you!&rdquo;</p><p>When Harry heard that voice, his head jerked in its direction where he found an old lady walking up the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, ma'am,&rdquo; he mumbled, pressing his lips into a small smile as she approached him. But the woman couldn&rsquo;t look more irritated.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dating the girl in that flat, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry parted his lips, not knowing how to answer, but he assumed the old woman must be Mrs. Huang, the angry neighbor who kept complaining about him and Y/N having sex a bit too loud. She didn&rsquo;t even need a response him him, and just went straight into the point, handing him the pink notebook which he hadn&rsquo;t noticed that she&rsquo;d been holding until now.</p><p>&ldquo;She dropped this yesterday. Maybe you can give it back to her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Huang eyed at the young man from head to toes, making him think she might begin to lecture him on how to not disturb the neighbors. However, what she said to him was this.</p><p>&ldquo;Ever since you came around, I&rsquo;ve seen her sing a different song everyday when she leaves the building. As annoying as she might be sometimes, that girl seems to be head over heels for you.&rdquo; Then the woman sighed happily, her wrinkles became more visible now that she was smiling at him. &ldquo;I miss being young and in love with someone. Hold onto it while you still can, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>When Mrs. Huang patted him on the arm and returned to her home, Harry looked down at the pink notebook in his hand. And in a few seconds, all the memories flooded back and the different images of her beautiful smile flashed right through his mind. At that moment, he realized, the goodbye wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be the hardest part, it was the flashbacks that followed right after.</p><p>Every single day he&rsquo;d spent with Ruby had been filled with fear and anxiety, which he&rsquo;d mistook for passion. But Y/N was his medicine. When he was with her, the pain stopped. She made him feel safe even though their relationship had never been solid, and with her he could get away from the chaotic of his world to find real peace.</p><p>After getting soaked in the rain, his old t-shirt no longer smelt like his Bambi, which meant he had nothing left of her to keep, not even her scent. Now he missed her with a pain in his guts like fire burning slow.</p><p>Had he been brave enough to just face his fear and accept the fact that it was love. It wasn&rsquo;t anything like the love he&rsquo;d had for Ruby, but it&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;love. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have trembled every time she called his name, his knees wouldn&rsquo;t have gone weak every time he caught her smiling at him, he wouldn&rsquo;t have spent most of the time during a day thinking, fantasizing, daydreaming about her.</p><p>If it wasn&rsquo;t love, what else could it be?</p><p>In his heart he retracted all the terrible things he had said to her. He&rsquo;d learnt his lessons the hard way, but not soon enough for the two of them.<br /></p><p>.<br /></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Your sim card is okay, but I&rsquo;m gonna have to take your phone to the repair store. Meanwhile, you can use my old Blackberry, it still works pretty damn fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N pressed her lips into a small smile as she took the phone from her dad, sitting down on the edge of her bed with a blanket wrapped around her now dry and warm body. Bradford stood there for a moment to make sure his daughter didn&rsquo;t need anything else. He was debating with himself whether or not he should ask about why she&rsquo;d come back. But once he saw the look on her face as she acted busy with the device, he took it as a cue to leave her alone for now.</p><p>Once her bedroom door was shut, Y/N finally lifted her eyes as sadness clouded her features at once. She carefully looked around the room. There was a strange melancholy feeling in her heart to be back in her childhood home after two years. Everything looked almost the same as the day she left for college, but it didn&rsquo;t feel the same because she was the one who&rsquo;d changed.</p><p>Through that window, she used to secretly watch Harry return home from school everyday. In this bed, he used to hold her as they both fell asleep on nights when her parents were both out of town, and her irresponsible aunt didn&rsquo;t care if there was a boy in her room. On that desk, she&rsquo;d written countless pages about him,&nbsp;<i>for</i>&nbsp;him, that he might never get to read. She looked around this room and all she could see were their ghosts lurking in every single corner.</p><p>After all those years, the boy next door was still so far out of reach. And she was still the same fourteen-year-old pining over her older neighbor who didn&rsquo;t love her in return. That bitter truth made her eyes well up, but she was too old to live in Wonderland anymore. It was time for her to go back.</p><p>The new ringtone blasted from the old phone shocked Y/N to the point that she almost tossed her dad&rsquo;s Blackberry across the room. Fortunately, she didn&rsquo;t. She sighed in relief the second the name&nbsp;Isey&nbsp;appeared on the screen. Wiping away her tears, she pressed answer immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;H-Hi&hellip;&rdquo; Y/N exhaled a nervous laugh, hoping he wasn&rsquo;t able to tell what a wreck she was. But he already knew that when he decided to call.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Smiley, are you okay? Where are you? Are you safe? Are you with someone?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Then the answer just appeared in her head on its own. Her smile faded soon as realization sank in. Her voice was soft and careful as she questioned, &ldquo;what did Harry tell you?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;That you two got into a fight and you ran off in the storm.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N scoffed, looking down and shaking her head slightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no big deal really.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; She pursed her lips, trying to come up with a white lie good enough to convince him she was okay. &ldquo;We just had a small disagreement and, yeah, like we always do. It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I still think you should call him back,&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;Isaac said. She could imagine the frown upon his face.<i>&nbsp;\"He was so worried.&ldquo;</i></p><p>\"Hmm,&rdquo; she hummed, pressing her lips to form a straight line, not knowing what else to say.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Where are you now?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;in Holmes Chapel.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Hiding.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back for my father&rsquo;s wedding in two days.&rdquo; She chuckled nervously, eyes glancing at the spinning fan above her head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about me.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a long pause from Isaac&rsquo;s side when all she could hear was his soft yet heavy breathing. She wished she could tell him what had happened, but neither her heart nor her head agreed it was a good idea to confide in Harry&rsquo;s best friend. So she just sat in silence and waited for him to speak. Eventually, he did.</p><p><i>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sad, just say so.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N nodded in response to those words, yet she soon realized that he couldn&rsquo;t see her so she quietly reassured him that she was fine. Though Isaac could probably tell she only said that so he would stop worrying about her, he was nice enough to not call her out for being a terrible liar.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I gotta go now&hellip;&rdquo; She said fast, her brows pinched together as her eyes squeezed shut. &ldquo;Talk to you another time?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Alright.\"&nbsp;</i>He let our a short breath.&nbsp;<i>\"Have a great day, Smiley.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Wait! One more thing!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;His light chuckle caused her to smile a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell Harry I&rsquo;m here&hellip;I&rsquo;m gonna talk to him myself when I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Promise?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Promise.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Knowing that Isaac always kept his words, Y/N trusted him entirely as she muttered a goodbye and waited for him to hang up first.</p><p>She put her phone down, staring at the window where came the new daylight welcoming her back to the small town of Holmes Chapel. The girl smiled sadly as she curled up in a ball on her childhood bed, her eyes fell shut in an instant. The exhaustion caused her body to hang limp like wet laundry on a winter day, now every one of her muscles was giving into gravity.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she could feel the sorrow in her chest waiting to take over, yet the fear didn&rsquo;t seem to exist like many times before. She knew the feeling of losing someone she loved, physically, emotionally, or&nbsp;<i>both</i>; and knowing it probably made it less scary. But what was worse than fear was the emptiness that followed when that someone was gone. She was learning how to deal with it, but slowly.</p></p>",
