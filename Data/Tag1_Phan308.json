I love you,&rdquo; to Dan this is just a stab in the heart, each time reminds him of what should be.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you. I love you. What am I doing?

I&rsquo;ve got to get off this plane.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the first words Dan himself has said in the one sided conversation that is happening with Phil and his machine. His heart rate accelerates rapidly, tears still in his eyes as the man he loves is realising he loves him too, but realising too late.</p><p>The voices start again silencing every sound Dan makes, too scared to even breathe in fear of missing it.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay excuse me,&rdquo; a new voice is heard now most likely a flight attendant &ldquo;sir, please sit down.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m really sorry but I need to get off the plane. I need to just tell someone that I love them,&rdquo; it sounds like typical Phil, even in this breakdown he is still saying the things that make Dan&rsquo;s heart ache for the man. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir, I can&rsquo;t let you off the plane.&rdquo; Dan knew this response was coming but the excitement of Phil, his Phil saying he loved him got his hopes up in the slightest that this could finally work after so many years so he still screamed.</p><p>&ldquo;Let him off the plane!&rdquo; Internally he knew Phil couldn&rsquo;t hear him and that even if he could it is too late now as Phil is gone half way to Paris now.</p><p>&ldquo;I am afraid you are going to have to take your seat.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, please miss, you don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; It was Phil&rsquo;s begging voice, if used on Dan, Phil could get him to do just about anything but the flight attendant isn&rsquo;t in love with Phil like he is, the voice most likely won&rsquo;t work and his hopes will be shattered again but still his brain still makes him say something, anything to try and get Phil off the plane.</p><p>&ldquo;Try to understand!&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice is shaking now, so full of raw emotions that are so close to overflowing.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on miss, isn&rsquo;t there any way that you can just let me off the&rdquo; a beep fills the room. The dreaded beep of the message ending. He doesn&rsquo;t know if the man he wants to spend his life with is here or on a plane, if he&rsquo;s running towards his apartment or flying away from it.</p><p>&ldquo;No! No!, Oh my god, did he get off the plane, did he get off the plane?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s frustrated cries wailed throughout the apartment as he jams every button on the machine hoping that another message plays.</p><p>&ldquo;I got off the plane.&rdquo; Dan spins around making himself almost dizzy with the speed and there he is, in his 6'2 form in the doorway is Phil Lester, the man who means so much to him and he&rsquo;s loved for so long is finally there so they can be together.</p><p>The silence hangs in the air and the two of the have tears crawling their way down each of their cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;You got off the plane.&rdquo; Dan whispers out.</p><p>The run into eachothers arms, an embrace that has taken far too long to happen and Dan pulls Phil, into the kiss that should have happened so long ago. The whole world seems to stop as the two jigsaw pieces of Dan and Phil finally find their way together after so many years of dancing around each other.</p><p>&ldquo;I do love you.&rdquo; Phil speaks after breaking the kiss that lasted simultaneously a lifetime and a second, to reassure Dan of the decision he just made.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too and I am never letting you go again.&rdquo; Dan replied and he meant it, if he had to spend the rest of his life clinging to Phil every hour of every day then so be it because he can never let this man leave him again and go through even a fraction of what he just went through.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Phil smiled up at Dan while saying this, &ldquo;Because this is where I want to be, okay? No more messing around. I don&rsquo;t want to mess this up again.&rdquo;</p><p>Without even thinking, the words just spewing out, Dan began his reply, still an inch away from Phil&rsquo;s face not releasing him from the embrace he had on him. &ldquo;Me neither, we&rsquo;re done being stupid.&rdquo; It only took them so many years but they were finally done playing games and were in it for a lifetime.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, it&rsquo;s just you and me all right? This is it.&rdquo; He could see that Phil meant it and that&rsquo;s all he ever wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;This is it.&rdquo; Dan paused, &ldquo;Unless we&rsquo;re on a break,&rdquo; he could almost see Phil leaving and getting back on the plane as soon as the words left his mouth. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make jokes now.&rdquo; He awkwardly broke Phil&rsquo;s death glare and inwardly face palmed and how stupid he is.</p><p>He looked back up at the man who had a smirk on his face and brought his hands up to his cheeks and kissed him, the first on many kisses to follow but each as great as the last because they were between him and Phil. His Phil that loved him just as much as he loved him back. His Phil that got off a plane just for him. His Phil that has been there since day one and till the end. His Phil.</p>",

The worst outcome had occured, he had made it and Phil got on the plane anyway. He is flying further and further away from him every second, off to Paris to live a better life, one without Dan.</p><p>The apartment is silent, what used to be full with the sounds of the two of them is no more, it felt suffocating. The room was plain without Phil there, no one to make the place home. The red light on his answering machince was blinking so he chucked his keys onto the coffee table pressed the black button to play and sat down.</p><p>The beep rang throughout the empty apartment echoing off the walls and a familiar voice filled the room from the machine. </p><p>\u201cDan, hi it\u2019s me,\u201d Dan inhaled, whatever this message was about to say it was most likely going to break him further but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop it \u201cI just got back on the plane and I just feel awful,\u201d Dan looked over at the machine almost to feel closer to Phil \u201cthat is so not how I wanted things to end with us\u201d Dan\u2019s immediate thoughts were to how he didn\u2019t want them to end at all, he wanted to grow old with the man he loved, start a family and get a house in the country not on two entirely sepearte continents with other people.</p><p>His thoughts were cut short by Phil\u2019s voice continuing \u201cIt\u2019s just that I wasn\u2019t expecting to see you and all of a sudden you\u2019re there and saying these things and now I\u2019m just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said and I didn\u2019t. I mean I didn\u2019t even get to tell you that I love you too,\u201d tears began to form in Dan\u2019s eyes, his mind screaming WHY COULDN\u2019T PHIL HAD SAID THIS EARLIER, they could have been here together cuddling, making out doing god knows what not flying apart from each other </p><p>\u201cBecause of course I do. I love you,\u201d to Dan this is just a stab in the heart, each time reminds him of what should be.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you.\u201d Dan\u2019s head whips around to the phone, the sudden realisation of regret is clear in Phil\u2019s voice and it\u2019s tearing him apart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to see you. I\u2019ve got to get off this plane.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d It\u2019s the first words Dan himself has said in the one sided conversation that is happening with Phil and his machine. His heart rate accelerates rapidly, tears still in his eyes as the man he loves is realising he loves him too, but realising too late.</p><p>The voices start again silencing every sound Dan makes, too scared to even breathe in fear of missing it.</p><p>\u201cOkay excuse me,\u201d a new voice is heard now most likely a flight attendant \u201csir, please sit down.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m really sorry but I need to get off the plane. I need to just tell someone that I love them,\u201d it sounds like typical Phil, even in this breakdown he is still saying the things that make Dan\u2019s heart ache for the man. </p><p>\u201cSir, I can\u2019t let you off the plane.\u201d Dan knew this response was coming but the excitement of Phil, his Phil saying he loved him got his hopes up in the slightest that this could finally work after so many years so he still screamed.</p><p>\u201cLet him off the plane!\u201d Internally he knew Phil couldn\u2019t hear him and that even if he could it is too late now as Phil is gone half way to Paris now.</p><p>\u201cI am afraid you are going to have to take your seat.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, please miss, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d It was Phil\u2019s begging voice, if used on Dan, Phil could get him to do just about anything but the flight attendant isn\u2019t in love with Phil like he is, the voice most likely won\u2019t work and his hopes will be shattered again but still his brain still makes him say something, anything to try and get Phil off the plane.</p><p>\u201cTry to understand!\u201d Dan\u2019s voice is shaking now, so full of raw emotions that are so close to overflowing.</p><p>\u201cCome on miss, isn\u2019t there any way that you can just let me off the\u201d a beep fills the room. The dreaded beep of the message ending. He doesn\u2019t know if the man he wants to spend his life with is here or on a plane, if he\u2019s running towards his apartment or flying away from it.</p><p>\u201cNo! No!, Oh my god, did he get off the plane, did he get off the plane?\u201d Dan\u2019s frustrated cries wailed throughout the apartment as he jams every button on the machine hoping that another message plays.</p><p>\u201cI got off the plane.\u201d Dan spins around making himself almost dizzy with the speed and there he is, in his 6'2 form in the doorway is Phil Lester, the man who means so much to him and he\u2019s loved for so long is finally there so they can be together.</p><p>The silence hangs in the air and the two of the have tears crawling their way down each of their cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou got off the plane.\u201d Dan whispers out.</p><p>The run into eachothers arms, an embrace that has taken far too long to happen and Dan pulls Phil, into the kiss that should have happened so long ago. The whole world seems to stop as the two jigsaw pieces of Dan and Phil finally find their way together after so many years of dancing around each other.</p><p>\u201cI do love you.\u201d Phil speaks after breaking the kiss that lasted simultaneously a lifetime and a second, to reassure Dan of the decision he just made.</p><p>\u201cI love you too and I am never letting you go again.\u201d Dan replied and he meant it, if he had to spend the rest of his life clinging to Phil every hour of every day then so be it because he can never let this man leave him again and go through even a fraction of what he just went through.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Phil smiled up at Dan while saying this, \u201cBecause this is where I want to be, okay? No more messing around. I don\u2019t want to mess this up again.\u201d</p><p>Without even thinking, the words just spewing out, Dan began his reply, still an inch away from Phil\u2019s face not releasing him from the embrace he had on him. \u201cMe neither, we\u2019re done being stupid.\u201d It only took them so many years but they were finally done playing games and were in it for a lifetime.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s just you and me all right?

Song: Fools by Lauren Aqualina. Beta\u2019d by the amazing <a href=\"http://twitter.com/fiveby_five\" target=\"_blank\">Jasmine</a>.</p><hr><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t keep going on like this.\u201d</p><p>It was out of the blue. A blow of a hammer smashing into what was left of their fragile relationship. It had them both stopping dead in their tracks and retreating into themselves. They were quiet, the fight was over, and each went to a different room.</p><p>They had never been good at \u2018talking it out\u2019, usually settling for leaving the truth somewhere in the middle; apologising and moving on. Never had either of them said something like this before and they had both felt the impact in their gut. Phil lay curled up on their bed, pulling Dan\u2019s pillow to him and holding onto it for dear life. He knew Dan was right but taking in the familiar smell of his boyfriend he could not find it within himself to accept it.</p><p>Seven years of friendship.</p><p>Two years of dating.</p><p>They went wrong somewhere, took a left where they should\u2019ve taken a right, and maybe this turn was the one they took when they went from being friends to being boyfriends. He couldn\u2019t imagine being without the person he loved most. The person whose smile lit up his life. The person he imagined himself growing old with. Dan was probably in the other room going over the same things in his head and maybe he had already come to a conclusion. Maybe he was going to come in any minute now to break it all into tiny little pieces in front of Phil\u2019s eyes.</p><!-- more --><p>Instead, something even worse happened. Phil heard the front door open and close and a heavy silence descended upon the house. Against his better judgement he still found himself roaming the rooms of the house for a sign of Dan where he knew he wouldn\u2019t find one. He seemed to have taken nothing but his phone which gave Phil some sort of inkling of hope, which he desperately tried to hold onto as the day progressed.</p><p>He texted Dan, \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019, but didn\u2019t get a response. As a last resort he called his mum, knowing that she couldn\u2019t put him back together, but she could try. He lay on the sofa, tears soaking the cushions, as his mum talked to him for hours. She was doing her best, but all Phil was hearing were the echoes of her voice bouncing off the walls in the empty apartment. There was no soft piano playing coming from the bedroom. No opening cabinets in the kitchen. No quiet laughing from the gaming room.</p><p>At some point just before dawn Phil fell asleep. He hadn\u2019t moved from his spot on the sofa and when he woke up a mere two hours later he stayed there. His eyes stayed glued to his phone screen, desperate for a sign, any sign, of life from Dan. Any acknowledgment of what they still had.</p><p>He didn\u2019t get up until his phone died and he had to go looking for a charger. Dan\u2019s was on the table but Phil couldn\u2019t bring himself to take it and before he knew it he was already crying again. He made some sort of an attempt to clean himself up in the bathroom mirror, splashing water on his face and running a helpless hand through his hair.</p><p>Any inclination towards self-preservation was out the door. He spent the day on the floor where his phone was charging and stayed there even after his phone was at 100%. He didn\u2019t eat, drink or sleep, only just dragging himself to the bathroom every couple of hours. Dan was completely MIA.

Phil heard the front door open and close and a heavy silence descended upon the house. Against his better judgement he still found himself roaming the rooms of the house for a sign of Dan where he knew he wouldn\u2019t find one. He seemed to have taken nothing but his phone which gave Phil some sort of inkling of hope, which he desperately tried to hold onto as the day progressed.</p><p>He texted Dan, \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019, but didn\u2019t get a response. As a last resort he called his mum, knowing that she couldn\u2019t put him back together, but she could try. He lay on the sofa, tears soaking the cushions, as his mum talked to him for hours. She was doing her best, but all Phil was hearing were the echoes of her voice bouncing off the walls in the empty apartment. There was no soft piano playing coming from the bedroom. No opening cabinets in the kitchen. No quiet laughing from the gaming room.</p><p>At some point just before dawn Phil fell asleep. He hadn\u2019t moved from his spot on the sofa and when he woke up a mere two hours later he stayed there. His eyes stayed glued to his phone screen, desperate for a sign, any sign, of life from Dan. Any acknowledgment of what they still had.</p><p>He didn\u2019t get up until his phone died and he had to go looking for a charger. Dan\u2019s was on the table but Phil couldn\u2019t bring himself to take it and before he knew it he was already crying again. He made some sort of an attempt to clean himself up in the bathroom mirror, splashing water on his face and running a helpless hand through his hair.</p><p>Any inclination towards self-preservation was out the door. He spent the day on the floor where his phone was charging and stayed there even after his phone was at 100%. He didn\u2019t eat, drink or sleep, only just dragging himself to the bathroom every couple of hours. Dan was completely MIA.

Maybe he was going to come in any minute now to break it all into tiny little pieces in front of Phil&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>Instead, something even worse happened. Phil heard the front door open and close and a heavy silence descended upon the house. Against his better judgement he still found himself roaming the rooms of the house for a sign of Dan where he knew he wouldn&rsquo;t find one. He seemed to have taken nothing but his phone which gave Phil some sort of inkling of hope, which he desperately tried to hold onto as the day progressed.</p><p>He texted Dan, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rsquo;, but didn&rsquo;t get a response. As a last resort he called his mum, knowing that she couldn&rsquo;t put him back together, but she could try. He lay on the sofa, tears soaking the cushions, as his mum talked to him for hours. She was doing her best, but all Phil was hearing were the echoes of her voice bouncing off the walls in the empty apartment. There was no soft piano playing coming from the bedroom. No opening cabinets in the kitchen. No quiet laughing from the gaming room.</p><p>At some point just before dawn Phil fell asleep. He hadn&rsquo;t moved from his spot on the sofa and when he woke up a mere two hours later he stayed there. His eyes stayed glued to his phone screen, desperate for a sign, any sign, of life from Dan. Any acknowledgment of what they still had.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t get up until his phone died and he had to go looking for a charger. Dan&rsquo;s was on the table but Phil couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to take it and before he knew it he was already crying again. He made some sort of an attempt to clean himself up in the bathroom mirror, splashing water on his face and running a helpless hand through his hair.</p><p>Any inclination towards self-preservation was out the door. He spent the day on the floor where his phone was charging and stayed there even after his phone was at 100%. He didn&rsquo;t eat, drink or sleep, only just dragging himself to the bathroom every couple of hours. Dan was completely MIA. He didn&rsquo;t respond to any of Phil&rsquo;s pleading messages and didn&rsquo;t have any presence on social media. Instagram confirmed that he had not been online since the day before.</p><p>His mum called him again, but Phil didn&rsquo;t pick up. He couldn&rsquo;t find his voice or the willpower to make any sort of sound.</p><p>When the doorbell rang at eleven that night Phil almost thought he was imagining it. He&rsquo;d half dozed off, head in an uncomfortable position against the wall and phone still clutched in his hand. It wasn&rsquo;t until the doorbell rang a second time that he grabbed the armrest of the sofa and pulled himself to his feet. He didn&rsquo;t want to give himself false hope but every fibre of his being was aching for Dan and pulling him to the front door.</p><p>Dan looked just as dishevelled as his boyfriend. He clearly had not slept and was wearing the same clothes as the day before; that dumb Kanye West jumper that Phil loved to hate.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Dan responded. He pushed past him into the apartment and led them into the lounge. &ldquo;I meant it.&rdquo;</p><p>The words almost knocked Phil to his knees. He couldn&rsquo;t manage any sounds, just a shaky breath that conveyed everything he felt better than anything he couldn&rsquo;t say.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Dan said softly, &ldquo;but something needs to change.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can change.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil finally looked up and faced Dan, their eyes meeting somewhere in the space between them.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to change. Us. Not you, not me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For seven years we ran smoothly and we were happy. Something changed then, we started dating.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You want to go back to being friends?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan bit his lip and broke their eye contact.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan.&rdquo; He reached out and took his boyfriend&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to stop trying so hard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A relationship means trying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been trying so hard to be in a relationship that we&rsquo;ve lost sight of who we are together.&rdquo;</p><p>They were both quiet for a moment as Phil processed this.</p><p>&ldquo;I spent all night trying to find a way to put how I feel into words, and that is the closest I think I&rsquo;m going to get.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want us to take off the label &lsquo;boyfriends&rsquo; and go back to basics. I want us to be how we are naturally. I want to kiss you and hold your hand without feeling like I need to make a performance of it. I want to do it for the sake of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite the cold glass that seemed to be coursing through his veins, Phil understood. He knew what Dan was describing, this performance they had been putting on since the moment they had officially started dating. Before that, they had just done what felt right, but the tag &lsquo;boyfriends&rsquo; had come with requirements in their minds and neither of them had fit into that circle but they had felt like they had to so they&rsquo;d pretended. It was stressful and tiring when all Phil had really wanted was to have someone to come home to.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just be you and me then.&rdquo; He said.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes widened as he nodded, &ldquo;You know what I mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I didn&rsquo;t know I knew till you put it into words just now. But I know.&rdquo;</p><p>When Dan pulled him into a hug everything melted away. That familiar warm smell of home and love and everything Phil couldn&rsquo;t quite describe but that made Dan <i>Dan</i>.</p><p>Phil couldn&rsquo;t imagine his life without him, and he didn&rsquo;t have to.</p>",
