        "answer": "<p>In the beginning it all started like a game (and let me tell you, Y/N was the best at playing these kind of games). Her boyfriend was preparing for the show in his dress room when she walked in, bored out of her mind. He was just putting on his Gucci suit when she sat down on the couch, opposite of the mirror he was standing in front of, and spreaded her legs wide open. Her skirt clunged to her thighs, exposing her lacy panties to him. Harry took a quick look and then locked his eyes with hers, raising an eyebrow at her.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try, pet. You\u2019re not getting me distracted right before the show.\u201d He simply stated, fixing the hem of his shirt.<br/></p><p>\u201cBut i\u2019m bored\u201d, Y/N whined, starting to rub small circles on her clit.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFind a way to entertain yourself then.\u201d<br/></p><p>She smiled devilishly and shook her head, biting on her lower lip. Harry felt himself twitching in his pants.\u00a0\u201c<b>Stop biting that fucking lip!</b>\u201d He growled, voice getting deeper.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Make me</b>\u201d, his girlfriend challanged him, moving her panties aside and showing him how wet she is,\u00a0\u201cdaddy.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry tried to think sober just for a second but the sight of her dripping pussy and the sound of his bedroom name drove him insane. He couldn\u2019t go on stage with a huge bulge in his pants now. So the only way to deal with it was to deal with the not so bored anymore Y/N as well.\u00a0</p><p>With just three quick steps from the one end of the room to the other, he got to the couch and pinned his girlfriend to the backrest, getting a strong hold of her jaw and kissing her like a mad man. She felt the cold metal of his rings on her skin and this made her close her thighs around Harry\u2019s in an order to calm the fire inbetween her legs.

This was one of my requests from the <a href=\"http://drunkirkharry.tumblr.com/post/184207101982/200-dialogue-prompts\" target=\"_blank\">list of prompts</a> I reblogged earlier this week. It was supposed to be a prompt but this has actually turned into an 8K bestfriend!harry one shot,\u00a0 based on the angsty,<b> \u201cI can\u2019t remember why I ever loved you.\u201d</b>\u00a0Hopefully it\u2019s enough angst but you know I can\u2019t make Harry a <i>complete</i> dickhead! So we also feature fluff \u2014 like Easter chicks and bunnies, because it\u2019s that time of year again!</p><p><b>Please remember that feedback is always welcomed!</b></p><p>Also, Happy Easter to anyone celebrating \u2014 and if you\u2019re not celebrating, then I hope you have a lovely weekend, however you plan to spend it \u2014 and enjoy the chocolate eggs because you know, chocolate!</p><p><b>Cookie Monsters and Easter Bunnies.</b></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that all about?\u201d you ask incredulously, your burgundy Vans thundering heavily underneath your running legs and against the concrete as you chase after Harry into the car park of The Old Red Lion. </p><p>Visiting Harry and his family in Holmes Chapel had been a tradition for as long as you could remember when it came to birthdays, and Anne\u2019s birthday this year had been no different. With a table booked at the local Ember Inns - an authentic pub which prides itself in serving traditional British classics, affordable wines and ales, along with it\u2019s roaring log fires which welcome guests into the homely environment - a small gathering of family and close friends of Anne\u2019s had been invited to join the birthday celebrations.</p><p>You had arrived in Harry\u2019s childhood hometown a few hours prior to the event to spend some quality time with your best friend and his family. Yet, you couldn\u2019t fathom how he had behaved so unpredictably towards you throughout the course of the evening.</p><p>\u201cHarry, will you at least have the decency to look at me when I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d your voice suddenly booms into the night air as you follow closely behind the large male figure. </p><p>His footsteps instantly ease the moment you shout at him, his ears pricking up at your warning tone and his body immediately halting. Harry had never known you to shout - not at him, at least - within your years of close friendship. Slowly turning on his heel, he meets your gaze, only to be met with your teary eyes and a silence filling the space between you both.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he eventually asks, licking his lips.</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d you ask breathlessly, your chest heaving slightly as you shudder.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d he asks, nonchalantly, shrugging his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve barely spoken to me all night, H,\u201d you tell him, sadly.</p><p>\u201cI asked you how you are, I asked how work is for ya,\u201d he begins, pouting his bottom lip and scuffing his shoes against the concrete of the car park that you\u2019re undoubtedly about to have a disagreement in \u2014 because based on his attitude towards you, and you lacking the knowledge of why the sudden change in his behaviour, it\u2019s inevitable that at least one of you is going to be left heartbroken tonight.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and that\u2019s all you\u2019ve said,\u201d you whisper. \u201cYou haven\u2019t spoken to me in weeks, Harry. You came back to London for a few weeks before disappearing off the face of the earth again-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to LA,\u201d he clarifies gently.</p><p>\u201c\u2014 and you never bothered to message me?\u201d you ask, pulling the sleeves of your cardigan down over your thumbs before wrapping it around your shivering frame \u2014 you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s a defence mechanism or if you are genuinely cold.</p><p>\u201cMy life doesn\u2019t revolve around you!\u201d he half yells. </p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d you gulp, swallowing the lump in your throat.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you acting as if me not contacting you is a big deal?\u201d he asks, running his hands through his hair, tugging at the curls at the nape of his neck in frustration at how, unintentionally, disastrous the evening has played out.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t even just about you not contacting me. You\u2019ve been so flaky with me tonight and I don\u2019t even know why! You\u2019re my best friend, Harry, and you can barely string together two words and talk to me. I didn\u2019t even hear it from <i>you</i> that you were back in London a few weeks ago,\u201d you cry.</p><p>\u201cI was busy,\u201d he sighs, excusing his recent lack of communication.</p><p>\u201cSo I saw,\u201d you tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d he scoffs.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re busy, H,\u201d you begin, nodding your head in understanding at his situation regarding his fame, \u201cbut seeing the media posting pictures and articles of you meeting up with people, it\u2019s hard. You mean to tell me that you couldn\u2019t at least spare five minutes of your time to drop me a text to tell me you were home? You mean you were too busy to come and see me?\u201d</p><p>Since arriving back home to London, Harry had been sighted in North London pubs with a string of high profile celebrities, including the CEO of Sony. You were none the wiser as to whether these well-known males in the public eye were just friends of Harry\u2019s, or if they were involved in helping him achieve success with his upcoming album.</p><p>\u201cJust like you couldn\u2019t spare five minutes of <i>your</i> time to drop me a text and tell me you were going on a date?\u201d he attempts to bite back, but his voice fails him as the harsh tone he strives for refuses to deliver. Instead, you\u2019re met with his soft timbre, yet the hurt within his expression is enough to resonate into the autumn air. </p><p>\u201cThat \u2014\u201d you begin, struggling to form your words. The statement had caught you off guard, leaving you baffled. \u201cThis is what all of this has been about? You\u2019re pissed off at me because I didn\u2019t tell you I was going on a date?\u201d you ask, the crease on your forehead becoming more prominent as you struggle to comprehend Harry\u2019s emotions. \u201cI would have told you in person, you know, when you were back in London, when I thought we\u2019d <i>actually</i> see each other. Besides, there was nothing to tell \u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s quick to cut you off with a scoff and raised eyebrows. \u201cNothing to tell? Why are being so self-righteous? If I have to tell you everything that\u2019s going on in my life, then surely you should be telling me everything you\u2019re getting up to in yours?\u201d he counter argues. \u201cBut instead, I find out through fans on Twitter that my best friend is hooking up with some random guy.\u201d</p><p>You shrug your shoulders at his words, realising that perhaps he has a point. Whilst you find it devastating that you only know about Harry\u2019s movements via social media, you hadn\u2019t considered that maybe Harry feels equally as hurt when you don\u2019t openly discuss things with him either. He\u2019s your best friend, after all.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d have more important things to worry about,\u201d you murmur softly.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d he asks, awaiting your next answer.</p><p>Lowering your gaze to the ground, you gently chew your bottom lip, unsure of how to express yourself. Inhaling a deep breath, you continue, \u201cCamille,\u201d and your eyes squeeze shut at the sound of her name bitterly leaving your lips.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re jealous,\u201d he states. It wasn\u2019t a question and you both knew it.</p><p>You quickly shake your head, your heart thumping against your chest. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d The unwelcome taste of salt suddenly lingers on your lips and you know that the tears that had been threatening to spill over during your confrontation had done so. You only hoped Harry wouldn\u2019t notice as you bring your hand up to rid your cheeks of the track marks they most likely left. \u201cWhy are you so bothered anyway? Why do you care who I\u2019m dating?\u201d you quickly attempt to change the topic of conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bothered,\u201d he sneers. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit who you\u2019re fucking each week.\u201d</p><p>You struggle to decipher what is being communicated, his words stabbing at your heart as he cheapens your experiences \u2014 or rather lack of \u2014 with the opposite gender. Unable to prevent your bottom lip from trembling, you let out a small sob at your best friend\u2019s unrelenting words.</p><p>With glossy eyes and a shaky breath, you endeavour to maintain at least some dignity you may have within yourself as the conflict between the two of you persists. \u201cWhat, are<i> you</i> jealous?\u201d you bite back.</p><p>His disparaging smile speaks louder than words, but the remark that follows is one that resounds, \u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself.\u201d He spits his words venomously, cruelty expressed in his stance as he narrows his eyes at you.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d you sob. \u201cI\u2019ve been there for you through everything, Harry! And this is how you repay me?\u201d you cry. Disregarding the constant flow of tears from your red, blotchy cheeks with the back of your hand, you sigh heavily before taking a deep breath and continuing, \u201cIt\u2019s been so hard without you being around the past few months, and I was really looking forward to seeing you tonight and spending time together. But now? <b>I can\u2019t remember why I ever loved you</b>,\u201d you whimper.</p><!-- more --><p>Your eyes instantly widen at your disclosure \u2014 in shock, fear, surprise, and you\u2019re not even sure where the sudden declaration had come from. Your hidden feelings had never meant to be exposed \u2014 you dreamt most nights that you would both eventually be in a stable position in your lives where you could unselfishly confess your undying love for the boy in front of you. But this wasn\u2019t what you had envisaged, and you hadn\u2019t intended to overshadow Anne\u2019s birthday celebrations. You were only too grateful that the other adults had pursued their night of revelry within the comfort of the quaint pub, none the wiser of the events occurring in Harry\u2019s childhood village.</p><p>Perhaps the weight being lifted from deep within your heart had heightened your senses. A group of young men had drunkenly cheered, \u201cOi Oi,\u201d at the revelation, a scene more common in a rom-com movie that Harry most likely owned a copy of. The smoke from their cigarettes in the designated area lingered in the October sky, and you knew that you would have to wash your hair at least twice before you no longer smell like a bonfire. Besides the jibes from the young adults loitering in the pub car park, the only other sound heard in Holmes Chapel was the eery ringing of the bells at St Luke\u2019s Church behind you, and your heavy breathing, your hot breath forming a misty cloud before you.</p><p>\u201cYou \u2014\u201d Harry begins, scuffing the heel of his boot against the concrete as he places a hand on his hip, wetting his lips with his tongue, \u201c\u2014 you love me?\u201d he stammers.</p><p>\u201cI \u2014\u201d you stutter, fingers fumbling around in your clutch bag until you find the car key you desire. Grasping it between your thumb and forefinger, you step back slightly, almost losing your balance in the process.</p><p>Harry whispers your name gently in the cold breeze, your name effortlessly rolling off his tongue as though any cruel words he had spoken prior to your revelation had diminished. \u201cDarling?\u201d he tries again with a pet name, his Cheshire dialect pronouncing the word you love hear him vocalise so much.</p><p>His effort at comforting you with his soft tone proves to be unsuccessful as you take advantage of the space between you and run from him, your car within only a few steps. Even under pressure and with trembling fingers, you\u2019re able to unlock the door to the driver\u2019s side and climb into the car, locking it behind you as you ignore Harry\u2019s pleas, your mind blocking out the desperate call of your name whilst in pursuit of you.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters under his breath, running a hand through his hair as he watches you speed away from the pub \u2014 and indubitably from Holmes Chapel. He never wants you to run from him. Taking his bottom lip between his thumb and forefinger \u2014 a sign that he\u2019s in deep thought \u2014 he\u2019s left alone to ponder before reaching a decision that will affect his future.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Your hand firmly grips the handle of the Walt Disney Dumbo mug that houses your hot liquid as you trail up the stairs and back to your bedroom. Whilst recent events would be a satisfactory excuse to wallow, you didn\u2019t want to waste your day off hiding underneath your duvet and pitying yourself.</p><p>Instead, you had taken to playing online games and watching ridiculously romantic movies, whilst simultaneously rearranging your iTunes folder. In other words, you were busying yourself with unnecessary and menial tasks, but it proved to be a welcomed distraction, at least.</p><p>It had been a week, a whole seven days, since you had confessed your love to Harry. As you had expected, you\u2019d heard from him instantly upon your journey home \u2014 you\u2019d received several messages on the same night following your declaration, requesting that you either come back to Holmes Chapel and talk things through with him, answer your phone, or at least respond to his messages so as he knows you\u2019re safe. But since arriving back at your London home, it seemed as though Harry had given up all hope of contacting you.</p><p>Taking a sip of your hot chocolate, you inevitably smear whipped cream onto your nose, before placing the mug onto the coaster on your desk and seating yourself in the cushioned swivel chair. Tutting at the minor inconvenience, you wipe it away with the back of your hand before opening the lid to your computer and heading straight into the games section and loading your Sims family.</p><p>Beneath the cover of the chilly October skies, you took advantage of having the smallest bedroom window open onto the latch to allow fresh air to circulate the room. Your bedroom is aesthetically pleasing \u2014 the warm glow of a Yankee candle burning on your windowsill, the flickering flame reflecting against the darkness outside caused by the autumn season, and the battery powered moon phase fairy lights decorate the metal headboard of your bed, the small white lights displaying a warmth to your safe haven.</p><p>You\u2019re so immersed in your game that a knock at the front door barely distracts you. Taking a glance at the clock, you note that whilst it\u2019s not an unthinkable hour, you\u2019re home alone and it\u2019s dark outside. Only when the knocking becomes persistent do you remove yourself from the screen that\u2019s providing you with the evening\u2019s entertainment. You log out of your account, before sighing heavily as you trudge down the stairs. </p><p>Swinging the door open, you\u2019re surprised as to who the uninvited guest standing in the doorway is. You blink in disbelief, before being the first to break the silence between you.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, H?\u201d you ask, wrapping your arms around your frame protectively. There\u2019s a hint of annoyance in your voice at his unannounced visit, but sadness overpowers any other emotion that you\u2019re internally battling as the boy who broke your heart stands before you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to make amends,\u201d he gives you a small smile, \u201cif you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>You lower your gaze and chew your bottom lip gently, your eyes averting to his jewellery clad hand - his H and S Gucci rings dressing his fingers, expressing his narcissistic manner \u2014 yet you knew Harry better than anyone, and you would never describe him as a person who has excessive interest in himself.</p><p>The handle of a Tesco carrier bag is firmly within his hold and it warms your heart that even with his ever growing fame, he continues to carry out the dull task of high street shopping. \u201cI bought cookies,\u201d he smirks in an attempt to win you over, \u201cwith chocolate chips,\u201d he clarifies, once he notices your gaze upon the bag he\u2019s carrying.</p><p>You raise an eyebrow at him before frowning, pouting your lips ever so slightly. \u201cWhat chocolate chips?\u201d you dare to ask, suddenly realising that you sound like a five year old child having to be bribed by their parents to complete a household chore.</p><p>\u201cWhite chocolate, \u2019f course,\u201d his heart skipping a beat as a smile dances upon your lips \u2014 a smile that he had missed and desperately craved, especially after the agonisingly long week he\u2019d experienced. \u201cOnly the best for my favourite girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been your favourite girl for a few months now, Harry,\u201d you murmur, your features etched with disappointment and sadness as you purse your lips together and avert your sad gaze towards the concrete step he stands on, Harry\u2019s feet much too big for small paving slabs.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey doll, look at me,\u201d his soft voice encourages you to maintain eye contact as his fingertips reach for your elbow. </p><p>The comforting action achieves it\u2019s intention as your eyes scan his face. His boyish grin from only moments ago has disappeared and his expression is serious \u2014 apologetic. The slight tint of redness in his eyes is proof that he\u2019s tired, perhaps having had the same amount of restless nights as you.</p><p>\u201cYou goin\u2019 to let me in?\u201d he pushes the conversation gently. \u201cBecause as much as I love the cold and rain, I don\u2019t really fancy getting sick before the album release,\u201d he smirks. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want your cookies getting wet,\u201d he adds, pouting his lips.</p><p>You nod, rolling your eyes, but the small smile that reappears on your lips is enough to display to Harry that you\u2019re more than happy to have him within the comfort of your own home. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just in time, I made a hot chocolate. Do you want one?\u201d you ask, as you step back and allow him to enter the narrow hallway of your home.</p><p>\u201cSo I can see,\u201d he smirks, bopping your button nose with his forefinger. You mirror his expression as his playfulness displays itself, and he quickly licks the whipped cream, that he removed from the tip of your nose, off of his finger. \u201cSilly question, really, \u2018f course I\u2019ll have one,\u201d he laughs.</p><p>\u201cGo on, go upstairs and I\u2019ll bring it up,\u201d you tell him.</p><p>Kicking off his boots and leaving them beside the front door, he quickly obliges to your request and heads upstairs, leaving you to head to the kitchen to cater for him. Whilst Harry was more than capable of looking after himself, a small part of you always felt a need to mother him. </p><p>Reaching for the mugs in the cupboard, you knowingly pull out the blue porcelain one with the famous Sesame Street Cookie Monster Muppet on it, along with the childhood classic expression, \u201cMe want cookie! Om nom nom.\u201d You know your sense of humour would be welcomed by him when he eats his white chocolate chip cookie whilst drinking out of the Cookie Monster mug you provide for him. Within only a few minutes, you had made the milky drink and you head upstairs with Harry\u2019s hot chocolate. </p><p>\u201cHere you go, cream <i>and</i> marshmallows, don\u2019t say I never spoil you,\u201d you hum softly as you enter your bedroom. You almost drop the mug at the sight of Harry sat in the padded swivel chair, exploring your online game. \u201cHey, that\u2019s private!\u201d you exclaim. You quickly place the mug down onto your wooden dresser, before reaching for the desktop mouse within Harry\u2019s hand, removing it from his grip. </p><p>His boyish grin returns, paired with a laugh, before stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not private if I know your password. Told ya before, lovie, you shouldn\u2019t have the same password for everything, y\u2019know.\u201d </p><p>Giving you a wink, he stands from his spot, freeing the chair for you. Taking his mug of hot chocolate into his hands, he murmurs his gratitude to you before pacing to the other side of your bedroom and lowering himself onto your freshly made bed. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re married, I see?\u201d he asks rhetorically, raising an eyebrow as he nods towards your computer, referring to The Sims game you were previously playing prior to his unannounced arrival.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of getting a divorce,\u201d you murmur nonchalantly, as once again you log out of your account and focus your attention back to the young man \u2014 who seemed to make himself right at home propped up against the cushions with his legs outstretched \u2014 on your bed.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d he replies, taking a sip of his hot liquid. \u201cOn what grounds?\u201d he dares to ask, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>You shrug, \u201cOn the grounds that my husband accused me of fucking someone else every week,\u201d and despite your voice being of a quiet tone, there was a hint of bitterness to your words, clearly establishing that you won\u2019t forget some of Harry\u2019s vicious comments in a hurry. \u201cYou can keep the kids,\u201d you tell him. \u201cWe have two girls \u2014 they both have a very artistic side, can play the piano, and they enjoy swimming. They go to private school so are very academic. I\u2019m keeping the dog, she\u2019s a Golden Retriever and she\u2019s pregnant,\u201d you clarify. \u201cAnd so am I, because we woo hoo\u2019d a couple of weeks ago. Also, I have a date tonight,\u201d you add, filling him in on your fantasy life.</p><p>The last comment nearly makes Harry spit the mouthful of hot chocolate out onto your crisp white bed sheets, his pulse raging, his blood boiling, and his heart thumping within his chest as he fears he may have to decipher the metaphorical terminology you\u2019re potentially using.</p><p>He coughs, \u201cand do you?\u201d he asks. \u201cI mean, do you have a date tonight?\u201d</p><p>You shake your head. \u201cNo, not in real life,\u201d you confirm.</p><p>Harry instantly relaxes \u2014 his chest is no longer puffed and his breathing slows once again, his once hunched over shoulders suddenly release their tension, and his ringed fingers which were momentarily curled into a fist, whilst resting on his knee, are now outstretched before him again.</p><p>The flickering light within his peripheral vision is enough to distract him from his thoughts \u2014 even if only for a short time \u2014 and his eyes avert to the window sill of your bedroom which is home to a Yankee Candle. However, with four of them in your bedroom readily available to light at any one time, he\u2019s not sure how you make the tough decision of which scent you would like to indulge yourself in. It seemed that you were comforted by the Belgian Waffles aroma throughout the October nights, whilst Salt Mist Rose, Pink Sands, and Christmas Cookie take a back seat.</p><p>\u201cHow did \u2014\u201d he begins nervously, breaking the silence, \u201chow did your date go?\u201d he asks, placing his mug on the table beside him before leaning forwards ever so slightly at the sudden change of direction in conversation. He raises his left hand behind his head, resting the palm behind him as he subconsciously scratches the back of his head, simultaneously adjusting his right knee into an upright position.</p><p>You shrug, \u201cI didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an element of worry and fear in Harry\u2019s features, his brows furrowing, with creases appearing on the centre of his forehead. \u201cWhat \u2018appened? Do I need to kick his arse? Chop his bollocks off?\u201d his British accent somewhat stronger when he curses.</p><p>You laugh at his protectiveness, surprised at how quickly you had fallen back into your accustomed routine of friendship despite recent events. \u201cNothing happened,\u201d you ease his obvious anxiety with only two words. \u201cHe was a nice guy actually, we just didn\u2019t click. It\u2019s not my fault my heart\u2019s not in it. Ironically, somebody else has my heart. I just tried ignoring those feels in the hope they would go away, not realising that they wouldn\u2019t just disappear on their own,\u201d you smile sadly, chewing your bottom lip.</p><p>Harry pouts, bringing a hand up towards his face, his thumb and forefinger make light work of his plush lips as he caresses the chapped skin that the recent cold and windy weather had been responsible for biting away at. You reach into the top drawer of your dresser, pulling out a chapstick.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d you murmur softly, standing from your spot and heading towards him. You hand him the cosmetic as you lower yourself onto your bed opposite him, cross legged as he takes the product into his larger hands and holds it at each end.</p><p>Swivelling it around within his loose grip, he reads aloud the words printed on the yellow lidded cylindrical object, \u201cNivea, milk and honey,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cBit girly, init? Won\u2019t do much for my masculinity,\u201d he jokes with a small smile, but he removes the lid and applies the balm to his lips regardless.</p><p>\u201cWell, nobody\u2019s going to kiss you, not with lips like that,\u201d you murmur softly as you watch him evenly spread the salve, moisturising his dry skin. </p><p>His brows continue to furrow with his intent focus on the tedious \u2014 yet simplest \u2014 task. </p><p>\u201cYou know, if you keep frowning like that, you\u2019ll be left with worry lines,\u201d you tell him, reaching up and delicately caressing his forehead with your soft fingertips. You immediately still at your gesture of close contact. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you breathlessly whisper, hastily removing your hand from his face and grabbing for the closest object within reach \u2014 Mr Bunny \u2014 in an attempt to put a literal barrier between the two of you.</p><p>Harry shakes his head, \u201cDon\u2019t apologise. I like being touched by you,\u201d he murmurs softly. He reflects your posture, straightening his back and sitting upright, crossing his legs. Leaning forwards, he cautiously reaches for the hand you\u2019d rapidly withdrawn from him and envelopes it within his own.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t. Don\u2019t make it any harder than it already is,\u201d you beg in a whimper at his intimate actions and affectionate words that would usually uplift your spirits and put you on cloud nine. Now, his utterances seem like empty promises and that would only threaten to break you down further, weakening the confidence you\u2019d merely regained within the last few days.</p><p>It shatters Harry\u2019s heart when you pull your fingers out of his hold, instead, averting your attention and caress to Mr Bunny\u2019s long, floppy ears, your fingers twiddling with the off-white fluff of the stuffed animal sat securely within your lap.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I buy you this?\u201d he asks with a small smile, his voice remarkably composed as he battled internally with the bubbling anger towards himself along with ] the hurt he was experiencing at your apparent rejection of his touch.</p><p>It was a statement as opposed to a question, Harry remembering with clarity the day he entered the Build-a-Bear Workshop in the shopping mall as it fast approached Easter only a year ago. He had chosen the bunny rabbit solitarily, shamelessly stuffing him \u2014 with love, quite literally, as the floor manager handed him a heart shape and requested he press a kiss to it before fitting it within the teddy \u2014 before printing off a birth certificate and choosing a wrist accessory \u2014 an Easter flower bouquet consisting of three coloured roses \u2014 pink, yellow, and purple.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you laugh breathily, as he removes the soft toy from your lap and inspects it. \u201cYou know, most people buy their friend\u2019s Easter eggs that time of year,\u201d you smile up at him, meeting his gaze since the first time you\u2019d willingly expressed your endearment towards him with the tender touch of your fingertips. </p><p>\u2018I did get you an Easter egg,\u201d he cockily states with a smirk, simultaneously shrugging his shoulders whilst his hands cordially stroke the ears of the bunny now sat in his lap. \u201cA Crunchie one, if I remember correctly,\u201d he grins knowingly.</p><p>\u201cYou did get me a Crunchie one, but you bought me the teddy, too,\u201d you state matter of factly, attempting to prove the point of his need to go excessively overboard regarding buying gifts for his loved ones for an array of occasions that he could find any reason to celebrate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rabbit,\u201d he informs you.</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d you dismiss.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re actually not,\u201d he mumbles softly. \u201cAnyway, it was the flower bouquet as an accessory that made your smile burst into full bloom,\u201d he beams, his boyish grin returning once again as he teases you. \u201cYou do love your teddies,\u201d he notes, as he looks around your childhood bedroom.</p><p>Harry sought great comfort in the ordinary bedroom you possessed throughout your childhood. He had watched both you, and your living environment, mature with time. Your shelves displayed some of your most treasured possessions \u2014 photographs of yourself surrounded by the most important people in your life, and Harry was honoured to be included in the colour transparencies. </p><p>A star sign pot which housed your crystals stood on the same shelf \u2014 Harry couldn\u2019t understand your obsession with crystals and if he was honest, he didn\u2019t care that Obsidian, Quartz, Jasper and Moonstone possessed qualities inclusive of \u2014 but not limited to \u2014 healing, strength, wisdom, and protection, nor did he know the difference between the stones, but it\u2019s clear they serve an importance in your life as he notes that the pot is paired with a book titled, The Little Book of Crystals, which he knows, with little to no doubt, that it is a quirky Urban Outfitters purchase.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry suddenly murmurs, and his apologetic tone encourages you to both make eye contact with each other. \u201cI\u2019ve been a total dickhead,\u201d he admits, pouting before licking his lips, wetting the dry skin. He looks up, eyes finding the ceiling before he squeezes them shut. \u201cWe should talk about what happened,\u201d his words resonate within your bedroom.</p><p>As he regains his courage and looks back down at you, he\u2019s met with your glossy eyes, tears threatening to spill over as the confrontation you dreaded has finally materialised.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t cry,\u201d he whispers softly, his fingertips dancing on your knee as you remain cross legged before him. Your name rolls facilely off of his tongue. \u201cYou know I hate seeing you cry,\u201d he adds with complete integrity. </p><p>Harry places Mr Bunny beside him on the bed before reaching for the box of tissues on the bedside table. He instantly notices the novel, Turtles All the Way Down, accompanied by the turtle ornament he had bought for you following his visit to Jamaica, after having written and produced the first self-titled album. The attention to detail in your bedroom tugged at his heartstrings fractionally more as he realises that there\u2019s something so reassuring about the consistency you offer him when he returns home.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you murmur gratefully through your tears as you reach for a piece of the material. Removing a tissue from the box, you scrunch it into a ball before wiping away the streaky track marks that had stained your red cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI need you to be honest with me, angel. How long have you felt like this?\u201d he asks, gently pushing the topic.</p><p>Taking a deep and shaky breath, you reply with your answer. \u201cA while,\u201d you whimper as your chest heaves and your body shudders, your breathing become a little more erratic as your sobs increase.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, doll, it\u2019s just me,\u201d he murmurs softly, raising a hand to your cheek and resting his palm against you. \u201cIt\u2019s just me, init,\u201d he repeats his comforting statement as you seek reassurance from him, nuzzling your face into him as his thumb skims the salty tears on your skin. \u201cIt\u2019s Harry,<i> your</i> Harry,\u201d he confirms.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not <i>my</i> Harry,\u201d you quiver against his touch at your own words.</p><p>\u201cI decide who I do and don\u2019t belong to, and right now, I\u2019m telling you that I\u2019m<i> your</i> Harry,\u201d he states simply. \u201cIs this about what you said the other night? About me seeing Camille?\u201d he asks. His suspicions are confirmed when the unmistakable look of hurt lingers in your eyes, far too long for his liking. \u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters under his breath, \u201cfuck, doll, she\u2019s just a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that before,\u201d you tell him, a slight scoff emitting from your lips as you roll your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love her,\u201d he tells you firmly.</p><p>\u201cH,\u201d you sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d his voice is adamant, \u201cI don\u2019t love her,\u201d he repeats with confidence. </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you do, Harry, you can\u2019t help who you fall for,\u201d you assure him.</p><p>\u201cFuck \u2014 will you just listen!\u201d he exclaims, running a hand frustratedly through his hair as he stands up from his position, pacing the wooden floor of your bedroom, clearly agitated at how the situation before him is playing out. \u201cI don\u2019t love Camille because \u2014\u201d he pauses, running a hand over his face, before turning back to you, \u201cbecause I fucking love you!\u201d he cries, gesturing towards you.</p><p>A deafening silence, paired with a suddenly uncomfortable atmosphere, surrounds you both, almost as though creating a barrier between the two of you. The howling of a harsh gust of wind rattles the garden fences that segregate yourself from your neighbours, and the rain lashing against at the glass panes of your windows are the only signs of life around you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>in love</i> with <i>you</i>, sweetheart,\u201d he murmurs softly, as he resumes his position on the bed opposite you, mirroring your demeanour. \u201cPlease say something,\u201d he practically begs, as he reaches for your hand once more, his thumb skimming your fingers and he breathes a noticeable sigh of relief when you don\u2019t flinch at the contact.</p><p>\u201cYou \u2014 you love me?\u201d you ask in disbelief.</p><p>He nods, pulling his bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes.</p><p>\u201cHow \u2014 how long?\u201d you ask, shocked.</p><p>He curls his hand into a fist, coughing lightly to clear his throat. \u201cAbout two years, roughly,\u201d he replies.</p><p>You frown, your brows creasing as you mentally put together the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle you envisage, revisiting two years worth of friendship and trying desperately to discover where along the line his feelings for you had developed further.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Harry, you must be confused,\u201d you mutter softly, shaking your head, almost refusing to believe his declaration of being in love with you. \u201cYou can\u2019t \u2014\u201d you begin, \u201c\u2014 you can\u2019t be in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2014\u201d he sighs, angry, feeling defeated as you have difficulty in understanding his feelings towards you. \u201cI\u2019m not confused, I just \u2014 I know how I feel!\u201d he exclaims, frustratedly. \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you for two years! I was just too self absorbed, focusing on the album to act on anything I felt, and then I had people around me trying to set me up with high profile celebrities \u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201cModels,\u201d you clarify, your expression pained.</p><p>He shakes his head, \u201cLook, it doesn\u2019t matter<i> who</i>, ok,\u201d he tells you. </p><p>Pausing, his eyes find the ceiling once more as he contemplates how to express himself, words wrestling with each other as they swim around his mind. He struggles to comprehend vocalising his feelings, before attempting his honesty once more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me this long to tell you,\u201d he apologises, opening his eyes to make contact with yours. \u201cI\u2019m a coward because I couldn\u2019t admit my feelings. I just \u2014 I can\u2019t be selfish with you, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelfish?\u201d you question with caution. \u201cHarry, you\u2019re the least selfish person I know,\u201d you assure him.</p><p>\u201cRuining our friendship would have been selfish of me,\u201d he shakes his head. \u201cDrawing you into a lifestyle like mine would be selfish. I can\u2019t drag you into a world \u2014 <i>my world</i>,\u201d he closes his hurt filled eyes for a second before continuing, \u201c \u2014 of publicity and judgement on everything you do. It chews you up and spits you out, and that\u2019s not a life I would promise to <i>anyone</i> I\u2019m in a relationship with, especially not you.\u201d</p><p>You nod, understanding his impassioned process of thinking.</p><p>\u201cLike you, I hoped that these feelings would just go away too \u2014 and when they didn\u2019t \u2014\u201d he pauses, his expression guilty as he struggles to maintain eye contact with you before his admission, \u201cI wished that you would go away instead. That\u2019s why I started ignoring you and for that, I am really sorry,\u201d he admits, biting at his bottom lip nervously.</p><p>\u201cH \u2014\u201d you begin with a heavy sigh.</p><p>\u201cSeeing you go on a date,\u201d he begins, before clarifying, \u201cIt felt like someone was stabbing me in the heart twenty times over because I felt like you were moving forwards with your life and I was no longer a part of it,\u201d he confesses. \u201cI thought maybe my feelings for you had just resurfaced, but in reality, they never left.\u201d</p><p>Once again, you nod before clarifying, \u201cIt was just a date, Harry. Nothing came of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he sighs. \u201cBut what if you really liked him? What if you were compatible with each other and everything went well? The next time I\u2019d hear from you would be in two years when you\u2019re getting married \u2018nd you\u2019re pregnant with his kid or somethin\u2019,\u201d he pouts.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just being silly,\u201d you tut at the sudden change in direction of the conversation, Harry fast forwarding years into your life. \u201cDo \u2014 do you really love me?\u201d you dare to ask, still having difficulty in comprehending the massive curveball he had thrown tonight.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes. \u201cWhy is that so hard for you to understand?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cBecause \u2014\u201d you gulp, \u201cbecause I\u2019m nothing,\u201d you shrug. \u201cYou could have any girl in the world \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stopping you right there. I don\u2019t want to listen to you belittle yourself. It\u2019s not necessary, and anything bad you say about yourself isn\u2019t true,\u201d he tells you, firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2014 fuck me, doll, you\u2019re perfect,\u201d he breathes softly, squeezing your hand reassuringly.</p><p>You twiddle your fingers together, intertwining them in your lap as you chew your bottom lip, struggling with the compliments he\u2019s paying you. You always found flattery difficult, unable to believe any sincere praise and admiration anyone has for you. </p><p>\u201cIt seemed that someone knew how you and I felt,\u201d he smirks, before pursing his lips together and his eyes rolling towards the ceiling, a breathy laugh escaping his lips.</p><p>You blush at the revelation, your cheeks reddening as you become flustered in front of the boy you\u2019d discussed your feelings with. You had never declared your feelings for Harry to any of his family, nor did you think you\u2019d made your adoration for him obvious to anyone. A medley of reasons contributed to your hidden feelings \u2014 inclusive of embarrassment, being knowledgeable enough to realise you\u2019re not Harry\u2019s usual type, worry of not being good enough, fear of rejection, but most of all, the apprehension of losing a lifelong best friend.</p><p>\u201cRobin knew,\u201d he clarifies, in an attempt to ease your suddenly obvious anxious state.</p><p>\u201cHe was a wise man,\u201d you tell him softly with a small nod of your head. A small lump forms at the base of your throat. Robin had been a trusting male figure in your life, and talking about Harry\u2019s step-father was still a raw and emotional topic for everyone following his battle with cancer.</p><p>\u201cHe certainly was. If he could see us now, he\u2019d probably bang our heads together,\u201d he gives you a small smile but with his bottom lip trembling, you know he\u2019ll likely reach breaking point within a short space of time. Your hand suddenly becomes the dominant one as you enclose his in your own, giving him a gentle squeeze of his fingers \u2014 a symbolic gesture that you\u2019re always here for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s up there laughing at us,\u201d you return the smile, knowing that Robin\u2019s sense of humour would be at the forefront of this situation. You raise Harry\u2019s hand to your lips, brushing them mindfully across his knuckles.</p><p>Harry scoffs, \u201cI promised him I wouldn\u2019t fuck up and that I\u2019d look after everyone around me. Now look at me, eh? Not even two years on and I\u2019ve already broken that promise,\u201d he whimpers at his own words. \u201cI just seem to be fucking everything up as of late,\u201d he trembles, wiping away at the tear that escapes in the hope that you don\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this to yourself, Harry, please,\u201d you beg that he\u2019s not harsh on himself at a difficult time. \u201cI know I haven\u2019t exactly made it easy telling you how I feel,\u201d you say. \u201cFor me and you to ever be in a relationship \u2014 the complexity of it,\u201d you stutter, unsure of how to approach the subject, \u201cIt just can\u2019t happen for us. It wouldn\u2019t be fair on you. You want to travel the world, make music and tour. Me? I\u2019m just plain and simple and boring \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not \u2014\u201d Harry attempts to cut you off but the threatening stare he receives from you as a warning \u2014 albeit jokingly \u2014 is enough to scold him for interrupting you.</p><p>\u201cI just want to settle down. I\u2019m ready for my life to move forwards,\u201d you tell him with integrity.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you sound like Gemma,\u201d he jokes, although he\u2019s had the immediate realisation of just how mature the young women in his life are actually becoming. \u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d he smirks, and you\u2019re only too appreciative that Harry \u2014 despite his glossy red rimmed eyes \u2014 seems to have regained a sense of humour and happiness. He sighs heavily before leaning forwards, resting his forehead against your own and resting his free hand on your knee, caressing your skin. </p><p>Butterflies flutter in your tummy at the close contact, your hot breaths fanning over each other\u2019s faces. Anxiousness is at the forefront of your emotions, and you can\u2019t help but feel a little disquieted as you consider the possibility that Harry will get your hopes up, only for you to be let down again by the same boy who appears before you. </p><p>The concept makes the metaphorical insects within you plummet to the pits of your stomach, the constant ache inside of you bubbling away and overpowering your sentiment. You\u2019re not sure you could overcome rejection if it arose after the day\u2019s intimacy between the two of you, the idea alone soul destroying.</p><p>You moisten your lips with your tongue, before quivering underneath his clement touch. \u201cHarry, I can\u2019t \u2014\u201d you mutter softly, closing your eyes. You quickly swing your legs over the edge of the bed, pulling your hand away from his before standing from the spot you had been sat and pacing into the centre of your bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t what, eh?\u201d he asks gently, his voice encouraging as he follows suit, close behind your frame. His eyes, filled with sympathy and empathy, watch you diligently from behind, as you fold your arms protectively across your chest. \u201cWhat can\u2019t ya do, darling?\u201d his thick accent resounds once more.</p><p>Your body instinctively twitches the moment his hand makes contact with your waist from behind you, his fingertips gently dancing on your hip. Despite the small flinch, you don\u2019t move away from Harry, and instead, you welcome his affectionate touch. You stare down at your naked feet \u2014 your nails painted a baby pink shade from the BarryM Under the Sea collection \u2014 twiddling the soft circular rug, which lies beneath your skin, between your toes. Composing yourself, you turn around to face the taller boy, his bottom lip pulled between his teeth as he looks down at you.</p><p>\u201c\u2018m sorry,\u201d you whisper softly.</p><p>Brushing a strand of hair away from your hair, he shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t apologise. We\u2019re both feeling pretty defensive right now, a lot\u2019s happened,\u201d he states. A momentary silence fills the tiny gap between you, before he finally plucks up the courage to express his desires. \u201cI want to try something, darling,\u201d he begins, a little hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019d like to try,\u201d he repeats, \u201cif you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>You nod, your body anticipating the next move the moment Harry\u2019s right hand makes contact with your jawline, his palm cupping your face as his thumb skims your cheekbone, his soothing gesture hoping that you\u2019ll relax in his embrace. </p><p>\u201c\u2019s just me yeah?\u201d he reminds you softly, yearning to rid you of any apprehension in the potentially awkward encounter. \u201c<i>Your</i> Harry.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s the first to lean in towards you, eyelids fluttering closed as his plush lips make contact with your trembling ones. Encouraging you closer towards him, he places his left hand on the small of your back and pulls your frame tentatively towards him, not forcing you into anything you don\u2019t feel comfortable with. </p><p>It\u2019s your next action that\u2019s the proof he needs. Your once clammy hands make contact with Harry, one snaking around the back of his neck as your thumb finds the sensitive spot behind his ear, making light work behind it as you stroke it gently. The other finds itself fisting through his hair, gently tugging at the curls at the nape of his neck. With a gentle tug of his locks, he moans into you, and he wonders how on earth he was able to deprive himself of this heaven for such a long time.</p><p>It\u2019s your turn to vocalise your gratification with a soft groan into his mouth as his hands caress your skin, passion ignited within you both. His lips form a narcissistic smile against yours as he realises that he\u2019s working you up. You feel giddy, like an inexperienced teenager having her seven minutes in heaven with her crush.</p><p>But you\u2019re with Harry, and his delicate touch and passionate kiss reminds you that whilst he\u2019ll lead you into this, you\u2019re the one in control of the situation, and you\u2019re always safe with him. Your lips greedily steal more kisses from him, his seemingly readily available for you. Each one becomes deeper as your tongues attempt to dominate each other\u2019s.</p><p>The sweet taste of him lingers on your tongue, along with a hint of saltiness \u2014 a mixture of both of your tears \u2014 as his hot breath fans over you throughout the affectionate embrace. A moan leaves his mouth in disappointment when you pull away breathlessly, your glossy eyes gazing up at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to do that more often,\u201d he pulls his face away and smiles down at you, not once losing body contact as his thumb continues to skim your cheek. \u201cOnly if you want me to,\u201d he continues.</p><p>Your giggly reply is the only confirmation he needs, \u201cI always want you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means you lied to me,\u201d he smirks.</p><p>You reply with a frown, your lips pouting as you display your confusion at his comment, whilst your fingertips continuously stroke the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou said nobody would kiss me with lips like these,\u201d he leans towards you and murmurs tauntingly close against your mouth, his lips dancing above your own once again.</p><p>\u201cShut up and kiss me, H,\u201d you whimper, hungrily stealing another kiss from him.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d he murmurs breathlessly between kisses. \u201cLove you \u2014 I love you, I love you,\u201d he repeats.</p><p>With his pants becoming breathier, you fight the internal battle of wanting him to tell you how much you mean to him, and needing the actions to follow up with his sincerity, and instead you settle on your audacious remark, begging him, \u201cSo show me you love me, then.\u201d</p>",

This was one of my requests from the <a href=\"http://drunkirkharry.tumblr.com/post/184207101982/200-dialogue-prompts\" target=\"_blank\">list of prompts</a> I reblogged earlier this week. It was supposed to be a prompt but this has actually turned into an 8K bestfriend!harry one shot,&nbsp; based on the angsty,<b> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember why I ever loved you.&rdquo;</b>&nbsp;Hopefully it&rsquo;s enough angst but you know I can&rsquo;t make Harry a <i>complete</i> dickhead! So we also feature fluff &mdash; like Easter chicks and bunnies, because it&rsquo;s that time of year again!</p>\n<p><b>Please remember that feedback is always welcomed!</b></p>\n<p>Also, Happy Easter to anyone celebrating &mdash; and if you&rsquo;re not celebrating, then I hope you have a lovely weekend, however you plan to spend it &mdash; and enjoy the chocolate eggs because you know, chocolate!</p>\n<p><b>Cookie Monsters and Easter Bunnies.</b></p>\n<p>&ldquo;What the hell was that all about?&rdquo; you ask incredulously, your burgundy Vans thundering heavily underneath your running legs and against the concrete as you chase after Harry into the car park of The Old Red Lion. </p>\n<p>Visiting Harry and his family in Holmes Chapel had been a tradition for as long as you could remember when it came to birthdays, and Anne&rsquo;s birthday this year had been no different. With a table booked at the local Ember Inns - an authentic pub which prides itself in serving traditional British classics, affordable wines and ales, along with it&rsquo;s roaring log fires which welcome guests into the homely environment - a small gathering of family and close friends of Anne&rsquo;s had been invited to join the birthday celebrations.</p>\n<p>You had arrived in Harry&rsquo;s childhood hometown a few hours prior to the event to spend some quality time with your best friend and his family. Yet, you couldn&rsquo;t fathom how he had behaved so unpredictably towards you throughout the course of the evening.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Harry, will you at least have the decency to look at me when I&rsquo;m talking to you!&rdquo; your voice suddenly booms into the night air as you follow closely behind the large male figure. </p>\n<p>His footsteps instantly ease the moment you shout at him, his ears pricking up at your warning tone and his body immediately halting. Harry had never known you to shout - not at him, at least - within your years of close friendship. Slowly turning on his heel, he meets your gaze, only to be met with your teary eyes and a silence filling the space between you both.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he eventually asks, licking his lips.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo; you ask breathlessly, your chest heaving slightly as you shudder.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to say?&rdquo; he asks, nonchalantly, shrugging his shoulders. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve barely spoken to me all night, H,&rdquo; you tell him, sadly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I asked you how you are, I asked how work is for ya,&rdquo; he begins, pouting his bottom lip and scuffing his shoes against the concrete of the car park that you&rsquo;re undoubtedly about to have a disagreement in &mdash; because based on his attitude towards you, and you lacking the knowledge of why the sudden change in his behaviour, it&rsquo;s inevitable that at least one of you is going to be left heartbroken tonight.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, and that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve said,&rdquo; you whisper. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t spoken to me in weeks, Harry. You came back to London for a few weeks before disappearing off the face of the earth again-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I went to LA,&rdquo; he clarifies gently.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&mdash; and you never bothered to message me?&rdquo; you ask, pulling the sleeves of your cardigan down over your thumbs before wrapping it around your shivering frame &mdash; you&rsquo;re not sure if it&rsquo;s a defence mechanism or if you are genuinely cold.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My life doesn&rsquo;t revolve around you!&rdquo; he half yells. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; you gulp, swallowing the lump in your throat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Then why are you acting as if me not contacting you is a big deal?&rdquo; he asks, running his hands through his hair, tugging at the curls at the nape of his neck in frustration at how, unintentionally, disastrous the evening has played out.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t even just about you not contacting me. You&rsquo;ve been so flaky with me tonight and I don&rsquo;t even know why! You&rsquo;re my best friend, Harry, and you can barely string together two words and talk to me. I didn&rsquo;t even hear it from <i>you</i> that you were back in London a few weeks ago,&rdquo; you cry.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was busy,&rdquo; he sighs, excusing his recent lack of communication.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So I saw,&rdquo; you tell him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What the hell is that supposed to mean?&rdquo; he scoffs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re busy, H,&rdquo; you begin, nodding your head in understanding at his situation regarding his fame, &ldquo;but seeing the media posting pictures and articles of you meeting up with people, it&rsquo;s hard. You mean to tell me that you couldn&rsquo;t at least spare five minutes of your time to drop me a text to tell me you were home? You mean you were too busy to come and see me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Since arriving back home to London, Harry had been sighted in North London pubs with a string of high profile celebrities, including the CEO of Sony. You were none the wiser as to whether these well-known males in the public eye were just friends of Harry&rsquo;s, or if they were involved in helping him achieve success with his upcoming album.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just like you couldn&rsquo;t spare five minutes of <i>your</i> time to drop me a text and tell me you were going on a date?&rdquo; he attempts to bite back, but his voice fails him as the harsh tone he strives for refuses to deliver. Instead, you&rsquo;re met with his soft timbre, yet the hurt within his expression is enough to resonate into the autumn air. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;That &mdash;&rdquo; you begin, struggling to form your words. The statement had caught you off guard, leaving you baffled. &ldquo;This is what all of this has been about? You&rsquo;re pissed off at me because I didn&rsquo;t tell you I was going on a date?&rdquo; you ask, the crease on your forehead becoming more prominent as you struggle to comprehend Harry&rsquo;s emotions. &ldquo;I would have told you in person, you know, when you were back in London, when I thought we&rsquo;d <i>actually</i> see each other. Besides, there was nothing to tell &mdash;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Harry&rsquo;s quick to cut you off with a scoff and raised eyebrows. &ldquo;Nothing to tell? Why are being so self-righteous? If I have to tell you everything that&rsquo;s going on in my life, then surely you should be telling me everything you&rsquo;re getting up to in yours?&rdquo; he counter argues. &ldquo;But instead, I find out through fans on Twitter that my best friend is hooking up with some random guy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You shrug your shoulders at his words, realising that perhaps he has a point. Whilst you find it devastating that you only know about Harry&rsquo;s movements via social media, you hadn&rsquo;t considered that maybe Harry feels equally as hurt when you don&rsquo;t openly discuss things with him either. He&rsquo;s your best friend, after all.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d have more important things to worry about,&rdquo; you murmur softly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; he asks, awaiting your next answer.</p>\n<p>Lowering your gaze to the ground, you gently chew your bottom lip, unsure of how to express yourself. Inhaling a deep breath, you continue, &ldquo;Camille,&rdquo; and your eyes squeeze shut at the sound of her name bitterly leaving your lips.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re jealous,&rdquo; he states. It wasn&rsquo;t a question and you both knew it.</p>\n<p>You quickly shake your head, your heart thumping against your chest. &ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo; The unwelcome taste of salt suddenly lingers on your lips and you know that the tears that had been threatening to spill over during your confrontation had done so. You only hoped Harry wouldn&rsquo;t notice as you bring your hand up to rid your cheeks of the track marks they most likely left. &ldquo;Why are you so bothered anyway? Why do you care who I&rsquo;m dating?&rdquo; you quickly attempt to change the topic of conversation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bothered,&rdquo; he sneers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a shit who you&rsquo;re fucking each week.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You struggle to decipher what is being communicated, his words stabbing at your heart as he cheapens your experiences &mdash; or rather lack of &mdash; with the opposite gender. Unable to prevent your bottom lip from trembling, you let out a small sob at your best friend&rsquo;s unrelenting words.</p>\n<p>With glossy eyes and a shaky breath, you endeavour to maintain at least some dignity you may have within yourself as the conflict between the two of you persists. &ldquo;What, are<i> you</i> jealous?&rdquo; you bite back.</p>\n<p>His disparaging smile speaks louder than words, but the remark that follows is one that resounds, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself.&rdquo; He spits his words venomously, cruelty expressed in his stance as he narrows his eyes at you.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; you sob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been there for you through everything, Harry! And this is how you repay me?&rdquo; you cry. Disregarding the constant flow of tears from your red, blotchy cheeks with the back of your hand, you sigh heavily before taking a deep breath and continuing, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so hard without you being around the past few months, and I was really looking forward to seeing you tonight and spending time together. But now? <b>I can&rsquo;t remember why I ever loved you</b>,&rdquo; you whimper.</p>\n",

So we also feature fluff \u2014 like Easter chicks and bunnies, because it\u2019s that time of year again!</p><p><b>Please remember that feedback is always welcomed!</b></p><p>Also, Happy Easter to anyone celebrating \u2014 and if you\u2019re not celebrating, then I hope you have a lovely weekend, however you plan to spend it \u2014 and enjoy the chocolate eggs because you know, chocolate!</p><p><b>Cookie Monsters and Easter Bunnies.</b></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that all about?\u201d you ask incredulously, your burgundy Vans thundering heavily underneath your running legs and against the concrete as you chase after Harry into the car park of The Old Red Lion. </p><p>Visiting Harry and his family in Holmes Chapel had been a tradition for as long as you could remember when it came to birthdays, and Anne\u2019s birthday this year had been no different. With a table booked at the local Ember Inns - an authentic pub which prides itself in serving traditional British classics, affordable wines and ales, along with it\u2019s roaring log fires which welcome guests into the homely environment - a small gathering of family and close friends of Anne\u2019s had been invited to join the birthday celebrations.</p><p>You had arrived in Harry\u2019s childhood hometown a few hours prior to the event to spend some quality time with your best friend and his family. Yet, you couldn\u2019t fathom how he had behaved so unpredictably towards you throughout the course of the evening.</p><p>\u201cHarry, will you at least have the decency to look at me when I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d your voice suddenly booms into the night air as you follow closely behind the large male figure. </p><p>His footsteps instantly ease the moment you shout at him, his ears pricking up at your warning tone and his body immediately halting. Harry had never known you to shout - not at him, at least - within your years of close friendship. Slowly turning on his heel, he meets your gaze, only to be met with your teary eyes and a silence filling the space between you both.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he eventually asks, licking his lips.</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d you ask breathlessly, your chest heaving slightly as you shudder.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d he asks, nonchalantly, shrugging his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve barely spoken to me all night, H,\u201d you tell him, sadly.</p><p>\u201cI asked you how you are, I asked how work is for ya,\u201d he begins, pouting his bottom lip and scuffing his shoes against the concrete of the car park that you\u2019re undoubtedly about to have a disagreement in \u2014 because based on his attitude towards you, and you lacking the knowledge of why the sudden change in his behaviour, it\u2019s inevitable that at least one of you is going to be left heartbroken tonight.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and that\u2019s all you\u2019ve said,\u201d you whisper. \u201cYou haven\u2019t spoken to me in weeks, Harry. You came back to London for a few weeks before disappearing off the face of the earth again-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to LA,\u201d he clarifies gently.</p><p>\u201c\u2014 and you never bothered to message me?\u201d you ask, pulling the sleeves of your cardigan down over your thumbs before wrapping it around your shivering frame \u2014 you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s a defence mechanism or if you are genuinely cold.</p><p>\u201cMy life doesn\u2019t revolve around you!\u201d he half yells. </p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d you gulp, swallowing the lump in your throat.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you acting as if me not contacting you is a big deal?\u201d he asks, running his hands through his hair, tugging at the curls at the nape of his neck in frustration at how, unintentionally, disastrous the evening has played out.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t even just about you not contacting me. You\u2019ve been so flaky with me tonight and I don\u2019t even know why! You\u2019re my best friend, Harry, and you can barely string together two words and talk to me. I didn\u2019t even hear it from <i>you</i> that you were back in London a few weeks ago,\u201d you cry.</p><p>\u201cI was busy,\u201d he sighs, excusing his recent lack of communication.</p><p>\u201cSo I saw,\u201d you tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d he scoffs.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re busy, H,\u201d you begin, nodding your head in understanding at his situation regarding his fame, \u201cbut seeing the media posting pictures and articles of you meeting up with people, it\u2019s hard. You mean to tell me that you couldn\u2019t at least spare five minutes of your time to drop me a text to tell me you were home? You mean you were too busy to come and see me?\u201d</p><p>Since arriving back home to London, Harry had been sighted in North London pubs with a string of high profile celebrities, including the CEO of Sony. You were none the wiser as to whether these well-known males in the public eye were just friends of Harry\u2019s, or if they were involved in helping him achieve success with his upcoming album.</p><p>\u201cJust like you couldn\u2019t spare five minutes of <i>your</i> time to drop me a text and tell me you were going on a date?\u201d he attempts to bite back, but his voice fails him as the harsh tone he strives for refuses to deliver. Instead, you\u2019re met with his soft timbre, yet the hurt within his expression is enough to resonate into the autumn air. </p><p>\u201cThat \u2014\u201d you begin, struggling to form your words. The statement had caught you off guard, leaving you baffled. \u201cThis is what all of this has been about? You\u2019re pissed off at me because I didn\u2019t tell you I was going on a date?\u201d you ask, the crease on your forehead becoming more prominent as you struggle to comprehend Harry\u2019s emotions. \u201cI would have told you in person, you know, when you were back in London, when I thought we\u2019d <i>actually</i> see each other. Besides, there was nothing to tell \u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s quick to cut you off with a scoff and raised eyebrows. \u201cNothing to tell? Why are being so self-righteous? If I have to tell you everything that\u2019s going on in my life, then surely you should be telling me everything you\u2019re getting up to in yours?\u201d he counter argues. \u201cBut instead, I find out through fans on Twitter that my best friend is hooking up with some random guy.\u201d</p><p>You shrug your shoulders at his words, realising that perhaps he has a point. Whilst you find it devastating that you only know about Harry\u2019s movements via social media, you hadn\u2019t considered that maybe Harry feels equally as hurt when you don\u2019t openly discuss things with him either. He\u2019s your best friend, after all.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d have more important things to worry about,\u201d you murmur softly.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d he asks, awaiting your next answer.</p><p>Lowering your gaze to the ground, you gently chew your bottom lip, unsure of how to express yourself. Inhaling a deep breath, you continue, \u201cCamille,\u201d and your eyes squeeze shut at the sound of her name bitterly leaving your lips.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re jealous,\u201d he states. It wasn\u2019t a question and you both knew it.</p><p>You quickly shake your head, your heart thumping against your chest. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d The unwelcome taste of salt suddenly lingers on your lips and you know that the tears that had been threatening to spill over during your confrontation had done so. You only hoped Harry wouldn\u2019t notice as you bring your hand up to rid your cheeks of the track marks they most likely left. \u201cWhy are you so bothered anyway? Why do you care who I\u2019m dating?\u201d you quickly attempt to change the topic of conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bothered,\u201d he sneers. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit who you\u2019re fucking each week.\u201d</p><p>You struggle to decipher what is being communicated, his words stabbing at your heart as he cheapens your experiences \u2014 or rather lack of \u2014 with the opposite gender. Unable to prevent your bottom lip from trembling, you let out a small sob at your best friend\u2019s unrelenting words.</p><p>With glossy eyes and a shaky breath, you endeavour to maintain at least some dignity you may have within yourself as the conflict between the two of you persists. \u201cWhat, are<i> you</i> jealous?\u201d you bite back.</p><p>His disparaging smile speaks louder than words, but the remark that follows is one that resounds, \u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself.\u201d He spits his words venomously, cruelty expressed in his stance as he narrows his eyes at you.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d you sob. \u201cI\u2019ve been there for you through everything, Harry! And this is how you repay me?\u201d you cry. Disregarding the constant flow of tears from your red, blotchy cheeks with the back of your hand, you sigh heavily before taking a deep breath and continuing, \u201cIt\u2019s been so hard without you being around the past few months, and I was really looking forward to seeing you tonight and spending time together. But now? <b>I can\u2019t remember why I ever loved you</b>,\u201d you whimper.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Your eyes instantly widen at your disclosure \u2014 in shock, fear, surprise, and you\u2019re not even sure where the sudden declaration had come from. Your hidden feelings had never meant to be exposed \u2014 you dreamt most nights that you would both eventually be in a stable position in your lives where you could unselfishly confess your undying love for the boy in front of you. But this wasn\u2019t what you had envisaged, and you hadn\u2019t intended to overshadow Anne\u2019s birthday celebrations. You were only too grateful that the other adults had pursued their night of revelry within the comfort of the quaint pub, none the wiser of the events occurring in Harry\u2019s childhood village.</p><p>Perhaps the weight being lifted from deep within your heart had heightened your senses. A group of young men had drunkenly cheered, \u201cOi Oi,\u201d at the revelation, a scene more common in a rom-com movie that Harry most likely owned a copy of. The smoke from their cigarettes in the designated area lingered in the October sky, and you knew that you would have to wash your hair at least twice before you no longer smell like a bonfire. Besides the jibes from the young adults loitering in the pub car park, the only other sound heard in Holmes Chapel was the eery ringing of the bells at St Luke\u2019s Church behind you, and your heavy breathing, your hot breath forming a misty cloud before you.</p><p>\u201cYou \u2014\u201d Harry begins, scuffing the heel of his boot against the concrete as he places a hand on his hip, wetting his lips with his tongue, \u201c\u2014 you love me?\u201d he stammers.</p><p>\u201cI \u2014\u201d you stutter, fingers fumbling around in your clutch bag until you find the car key you desire. Grasping it between your thumb and forefinger, you step back slightly, almost losing your balance in the process.</p><p>Harry whispers your name gently in the cold breeze, your name effortlessly rolling off his tongue as though any cruel words he had spoken prior to your revelation had diminished. \u201cDarling?\u201d he tries again with a pet name, his Cheshire dialect pronouncing the word you love hear him vocalise so much.</p><p>His effort at comforting you with his soft tone proves to be unsuccessful as you take advantage of the space between you and run from him, your car within only a few steps. Even under pressure and with trembling fingers, you\u2019re able to unlock the door to the driver\u2019s side and climb into the car, locking it behind you as you ignore Harry\u2019s pleas, your mind blocking out the desperate call of your name whilst in pursuit of you.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters under his breath, running a hand through his hair as he watches you speed away from the pub \u2014 and indubitably from Holmes Chapel. He never wants you to run from him. Taking his bottom lip between his thumb and forefinger \u2014 a sign that he\u2019s in deep thought \u2014 he\u2019s left alone to ponder before reaching a decision that will affect his future.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Your hand firmly grips the handle of the Walt Disney Dumbo mug that houses your hot liquid as you trail up the stairs and back to your bedroom. Whilst recent events would be a satisfactory excuse to wallow, you didn\u2019t want to waste your day off hiding underneath your duvet and pitying yourself.</p><p>Instead, you had taken to playing online games and watching ridiculously romantic movies, whilst simultaneously rearranging your iTunes folder. In other words, you were busying yourself with unnecessary and menial tasks, but it proved to be a welcomed distraction, at least.</p><p>It had been a week, a whole seven days, since you had confessed your love to Harry. As you had expected, you\u2019d heard from him instantly upon your journey home \u2014 you\u2019d received several messages on the same night following your declaration, requesting that you either come back to Holmes Chapel and talk things through with him, answer your phone, or at least respond to his messages so as he knows you\u2019re safe. But since arriving back at your London home, it seemed as though Harry had given up all hope of contacting you.</p><p>Taking a sip of your hot chocolate, you inevitably smear whipped cream onto your nose, before placing the mug onto the coaster on your desk and seating yourself in the cushioned swivel chair. Tutting at the minor inconvenience, you wipe it away with the back of your hand before opening the lid to your computer and heading straight into the games section and loading your Sims family.</p><p>Beneath the cover of the chilly October skies, you took advantage of having the smallest bedroom window open onto the latch to allow fresh air to circulate the room. Your bedroom is aesthetically pleasing \u2014 the warm glow of a Yankee candle burning on your windowsill, the flickering flame reflecting against the darkness outside caused by the autumn season, and the battery powered moon phase fairy lights decorate the metal headboard of your bed, the small white lights displaying a warmth to your safe haven.</p><p>You\u2019re so immersed in your game that a knock at the front door barely distracts you. Taking a glance at the clock, you note that whilst it\u2019s not an unthinkable hour, you\u2019re home alone and it\u2019s dark outside. Only when the knocking becomes persistent do you remove yourself from the screen that\u2019s providing you with the evening\u2019s entertainment. You log out of your account, before sighing heavily as you trudge down the stairs. </p><p>Swinging the door open, you\u2019re surprised as to who the uninvited guest standing in the doorway is. You blink in disbelief, before being the first to break the silence between you.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, H?\u201d you ask, wrapping your arms around your frame protectively. There\u2019s a hint of annoyance in your voice at his unannounced visit, but sadness overpowers any other emotion that you\u2019re internally battling as the boy who broke your heart stands before you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to make amends,\u201d he gives you a small smile, \u201cif you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>You lower your gaze and chew your bottom lip gently, your eyes averting to his jewellery clad hand - his H and S Gucci rings dressing his fingers, expressing his narcissistic manner \u2014 yet you knew Harry better than anyone, and you would never describe him as a person who has excessive interest in himself.</p><p>The handle of a Tesco carrier bag is firmly within his hold and it warms your heart that even with his ever growing fame, he continues to carry out the dull task of high street shopping. \u201cI bought cookies,\u201d he smirks in an attempt to win you over, \u201cwith chocolate chips,\u201d he clarifies, once he notices your gaze upon the bag he\u2019s carrying.</p><p>You raise an eyebrow at him before frowning, pouting your lips ever so slightly. \u201cWhat chocolate chips?\u201d you dare to ask, suddenly realising that you sound like a five year old child having to be bribed by their parents to complete a household chore.</p><p>\u201cWhite chocolate, \u2019f course,\u201d his heart skipping a beat as a smile dances upon your lips \u2014 a smile that he had missed and desperately craved, especially after the agonisingly long week he\u2019d experienced. \u201cOnly the best for my favourite girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been your favourite girl for a few months now, Harry,\u201d you murmur, your features etched with disappointment and sadness as you purse your lips together and avert your sad gaze towards the concrete step he stands on, Harry\u2019s feet much too big for small paving slabs.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey doll, look at me,\u201d his soft voice encourages you to maintain eye contact as his fingertips reach for your elbow. </p><p>The comforting action achieves it\u2019s intention as your eyes scan his face. His boyish grin from only moments ago has disappeared and his expression is serious \u2014 apologetic. The slight tint of redness in his eyes is proof that he\u2019s tired, perhaps having had the same amount of restless nights as you.</p><p>\u201cYou goin\u2019 to let me in?\u201d he pushes the conversation gently. \u201cBecause as much as I love the cold and rain, I don\u2019t really fancy getting sick before the album release,\u201d he smirks. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want your cookies getting wet,\u201d he adds, pouting his lips.</p><p>You nod, rolling your eyes, but the small smile that reappears on your lips is enough to display to Harry that you\u2019re more than happy to have him within the comfort of your own home. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just in time, I made a hot chocolate. Do you want one?\u201d you ask, as you step back and allow him to enter the narrow hallway of your home.</p><p>\u201cSo I can see,\u201d he smirks, bopping your button nose with his forefinger. You mirror his expression as his playfulness displays itself, and he quickly licks the whipped cream, that he removed from the tip of your nose, off of his finger. \u201cSilly question, really, \u2018f course I\u2019ll have one,\u201d he laughs.</p><p>\u201cGo on, go upstairs and I\u2019ll bring it up,\u201d you tell him.</p><p>Kicking off his boots and leaving them beside the front door, he quickly obliges to your request and heads upstairs, leaving you to head to the kitchen to cater for him. Whilst Harry was more than capable of looking after himself, a small part of you always felt a need to mother him. </p><p>Reaching for the mugs in the cupboard, you knowingly pull out the blue porcelain one with the famous Sesame Street Cookie Monster Muppet on it, along with the childhood classic expression, \u201cMe want cookie! Om nom nom.\u201d You know your sense of humour would be welcomed by him when he eats his white chocolate chip cookie whilst drinking out of the Cookie Monster mug you provide for him. Within only a few minutes, you had made the milky drink and you head upstairs with Harry\u2019s hot chocolate. </p><p>\u201cHere you go, cream <i>and</i> marshmallows, don\u2019t say I never spoil you,\u201d you hum softly as you enter your bedroom. You almost drop the mug at the sight of Harry sat in the padded swivel chair, exploring your online game. \u201cHey, that\u2019s private!\u201d you exclaim. You quickly place the mug down onto your wooden dresser, before reaching for the desktop mouse within Harry\u2019s hand, removing it from his grip. </p><p>His boyish grin returns, paired with a laugh, before stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not private if I know your password. Told ya before, lovie, you shouldn\u2019t have the same password for everything, y\u2019know.\u201d </p><p>Giving you a wink, he stands from his spot, freeing the chair for you. Taking his mug of hot chocolate into his hands, he murmurs his gratitude to you before pacing to the other side of your bedroom and lowering himself onto your freshly made bed. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re married, I see?\u201d he asks rhetorically, raising an eyebrow as he nods towards your computer, referring to The Sims game you were previously playing prior to his unannounced arrival.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of getting a divorce,\u201d you murmur nonchalantly, as once again you log out of your account and focus your attention back to the young man \u2014 who seemed to make himself right at home propped up against the cushions with his legs outstretched \u2014 on your bed.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d he replies, taking a sip of his hot liquid. \u201cOn what grounds?\u201d he dares to ask, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>You shrug, \u201cOn the grounds that my husband accused me of fucking someone else every week,\u201d and despite your voice being of a quiet tone, there was a hint of bitterness to your words, clearly establishing that you won\u2019t forget some of Harry\u2019s vicious comments in a hurry. \u201cYou can keep the kids,\u201d you tell him. \u201cWe have two girls \u2014 they both have a very artistic side, can play the piano, and they enjoy swimming. They go to private school so are very academic. I\u2019m keeping the dog, she\u2019s a Golden Retriever and she\u2019s pregnant,\u201d you clarify. \u201cAnd so am I, because we woo hoo\u2019d a couple of weeks ago. Also, I have a date tonight,\u201d you add, filling him in on your fantasy life.</p><p>The last comment nearly makes Harry spit the mouthful of hot chocolate out onto your crisp white bed sheets, his pulse raging, his blood boiling, and his heart thumping within his chest as he fears he may have to decipher the metaphorical terminology you\u2019re potentially using.</p><p>He coughs, \u201cand do you?\u201d he asks. \u201cI mean, do you have a date tonight?\u201d</p><p>You shake your head. \u201cNo, not in real life,\u201d you confirm.</p><p>Harry instantly relaxes \u2014 his chest is no longer puffed and his breathing slows once again, his once hunched over shoulders suddenly release their tension, and his ringed fingers which were momentarily curled into a fist, whilst resting on his knee, are now outstretched before him again.</p><p>The flickering light within his peripheral vision is enough to distract him from his thoughts \u2014 even if only for a short time \u2014 and his eyes avert to the window sill of your bedroom which is home to a Yankee Candle. However, with four of them in your bedroom readily available to light at any one time, he\u2019s not sure how you make the tough decision of which scent you would like to indulge yourself in. It seemed that you were comforted by the Belgian Waffles aroma throughout the October nights, whilst Salt Mist Rose, Pink Sands, and Christmas Cookie take a back seat.</p><p>\u201cHow did \u2014\u201d he begins nervously, breaking the silence, \u201chow did your date go?\u201d he asks, placing his mug on the table beside him before leaning forwards ever so slightly at the sudden change of direction in conversation. He raises his left hand behind his head, resting the palm behind him as he subconsciously scratches the back of his head, simultaneously adjusting his right knee into an upright position.</p><p>You shrug, \u201cI didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an element of worry and fear in Harry\u2019s features, his brows furrowing, with creases appearing on the centre of his forehead. \u201cWhat \u2018appened? Do I need to kick his arse? Chop his bollocks off?\u201d his British accent somewhat stronger when he curses.</p><p>You laugh at his protectiveness, surprised at how quickly you had fallen back into your accustomed routine of friendship despite recent events. \u201cNothing happened,\u201d you ease his obvious anxiety with only two words. \u201cHe was a nice guy actually, we just didn\u2019t click. It\u2019s not my fault my heart\u2019s not in it. Ironically, somebody else has my heart. I just tried ignoring those feels in the hope they would go away, not realising that they wouldn\u2019t just disappear on their own,\u201d you smile sadly, chewing your bottom lip.</p><p>Harry pouts, bringing a hand up towards his face, his thumb and forefinger make light work of his plush lips as he caresses the chapped skin that the recent cold and windy weather had been responsible for biting away at. You reach into the top drawer of your dresser, pulling out a chapstick.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d you murmur softly, standing from your spot and heading towards him. You hand him the cosmetic as you lower yourself onto your bed opposite him, cross legged as he takes the product into his larger hands and holds it at each end.</p><p>Swivelling it around within his loose grip, he reads aloud the words printed on the yellow lidded cylindrical object, \u201cNivea, milk and honey,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cBit girly, init? Won\u2019t do much for my masculinity,\u201d he jokes with a small smile, but he removes the lid and applies the balm to his lips regardless.</p><p>\u201cWell, nobody\u2019s going to kiss you, not with lips like that,\u201d you murmur softly as you watch him evenly spread the salve, moisturising his dry skin. </p><p>His brows continue to furrow with his intent focus on the tedious \u2014 yet simplest \u2014 task. </p><p>\u201cYou know, if you keep frowning like that, you\u2019ll be left with worry lines,\u201d you tell him, reaching up and delicately caressing his forehead with your soft fingertips. You immediately still at your gesture of close contact. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you breathlessly whisper, hastily removing your hand from his face and grabbing for the closest object within reach \u2014 Mr Bunny \u2014 in an attempt to put a literal barrier between the two of you.</p><p>Harry shakes his head, \u201cDon\u2019t apologise. I like being touched by you,\u201d he murmurs softly. He reflects your posture, straightening his back and sitting upright, crossing his legs. Leaning forwards, he cautiously reaches for the hand you\u2019d rapidly withdrawn from him and envelopes it within his own.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t. Don\u2019t make it any harder than it already is,\u201d you beg in a whimper at his intimate actions and affectionate words that would usually uplift your spirits and put you on cloud nine. Now, his utterances seem like empty promises and that would only threaten to break you down further, weakening the confidence you\u2019d merely regained within the last few days.</p><p>It shatters Harry\u2019s heart when you pull your fingers out of his hold, instead, averting your attention and caress to Mr Bunny\u2019s long, floppy ears, your fingers twiddling with the off-white fluff of the stuffed animal sat securely within your lap.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I buy you this?\u201d he asks with a small smile, his voice remarkably composed as he battled internally with the bubbling anger towards himself along with ] the hurt he was experiencing at your apparent rejection of his touch.</p><p>It was a statement as opposed to a question, Harry remembering with clarity the day he entered the Build-a-Bear Workshop in the shopping mall as it fast approached Easter only a year ago. He had chosen the bunny rabbit solitarily, shamelessly stuffing him \u2014 with love, quite literally, as the floor manager handed him a heart shape and requested he press a kiss to it before fitting it within the teddy \u2014 before printing off a birth certificate and choosing a wrist accessory \u2014 an Easter flower bouquet consisting of three coloured roses \u2014 pink, yellow, and purple.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you laugh breathily, as he removes the soft toy from your lap and inspects it. \u201cYou know, most people buy their friend\u2019s Easter eggs that time of year,\u201d you smile up at him, meeting his gaze since the first time you\u2019d willingly expressed your endearment towards him with the tender touch of your fingertips. </p><p>\u2018I did get you an Easter egg,\u201d he cockily states with a smirk, simultaneously shrugging his shoulders whilst his hands cordially stroke the ears of the bunny now sat in his lap. \u201cA Crunchie one, if I remember correctly,\u201d he grins knowingly.</p><p>\u201cYou did get me a Crunchie one, but you bought me the teddy, too,\u201d you state matter of factly, attempting to prove the point of his need to go excessively overboard regarding buying gifts for his loved ones for an array of occasions that he could find any reason to celebrate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rabbit,\u201d he informs you.</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d you dismiss.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re actually not,\u201d he mumbles softly. \u201cAnyway, it was the flower bouquet as an accessory that made your smile burst into full bloom,\u201d he beams, his boyish grin returning once again as he teases you. \u201cYou do love your teddies,\u201d he notes, as he looks around your childhood bedroom.</p><p>Harry sought great comfort in the ordinary bedroom you possessed throughout your childhood. He had watched both you, and your living environment, mature with time. Your shelves displayed some of your most treasured possessions \u2014 photographs of yourself surrounded by the most important people in your life, and Harry was honoured to be included in the colour transparencies. </p><p>A star sign pot which housed your crystals stood on the same shelf \u2014 Harry couldn\u2019t understand your obsession with crystals and if he was honest, he didn\u2019t care that Obsidian, Quartz, Jasper and Moonstone possessed qualities inclusive of \u2014 but not limited to \u2014 healing, strength, wisdom, and protection, nor did he know the difference between the stones, but it\u2019s clear they serve an importance in your life as he notes that the pot is paired with a book titled, The Little Book of Crystals, which he knows, with little to no doubt, that it is a quirky Urban Outfitters purchase.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry suddenly murmurs, and his apologetic tone encourages you to both make eye contact with each other. \u201cI\u2019ve been a total dickhead,\u201d he admits, pouting before licking his lips, wetting the dry skin. He looks up, eyes finding the ceiling before he squeezes them shut. \u201cWe should talk about what happened,\u201d his words resonate within your bedroom.</p><p>As he regains his courage and looks back down at you, he\u2019s met with your glossy eyes, tears threatening to spill over as the confrontation you dreaded has finally materialised.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t cry,\u201d he whispers softly, his fingertips dancing on your knee as you remain cross legged before him. Your name rolls facilely off of his tongue. \u201cYou know I hate seeing you cry,\u201d he adds with complete integrity. </p><p>Harry places Mr Bunny beside him on the bed before reaching for the box of tissues on the bedside table. He instantly notices the novel, Turtles All the Way Down, accompanied by the turtle ornament he had bought for you following his visit to Jamaica, after having written and produced the first self-titled album. The attention to detail in your bedroom tugged at his heartstrings fractionally more as he realises that there\u2019s something so reassuring about the consistency you offer him when he returns home.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you murmur gratefully through your tears as you reach for a piece of the material. Removing a tissue from the box, you scrunch it into a ball before wiping away the streaky track marks that had stained your red cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI need you to be honest with me, angel. How long have you felt like this?\u201d he asks, gently pushing the topic.</p><p>Taking a deep and shaky breath, you reply with your answer. \u201cA while,\u201d you whimper as your chest heaves and your body shudders, your breathing become a little more erratic as your sobs increase.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, doll, it\u2019s just me,\u201d he murmurs softly, raising a hand to your cheek and resting his palm against you. \u201cIt\u2019s just me, init,\u201d he repeats his comforting statement as you seek reassurance from him, nuzzling your face into him as his thumb skims the salty tears on your skin. \u201cIt\u2019s Harry,<i> your</i> Harry,\u201d he confirms.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not <i>my</i> Harry,\u201d you quiver against his touch at your own words.</p><p>\u201cI decide who I do and don\u2019t belong to, and right now, I\u2019m telling you that I\u2019m<i> your</i> Harry,\u201d he states simply. \u201cIs this about what you said the other night? About me seeing Camille?\u201d he asks. His suspicions are confirmed when the unmistakable look of hurt lingers in your eyes, far too long for his liking. \u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters under his breath, \u201cfuck, doll, she\u2019s just a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that before,\u201d you tell him, a slight scoff emitting from your lips as you roll your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love her,\u201d he tells you firmly.</p><p>\u201cH,\u201d you sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d his voice is adamant, \u201cI don\u2019t love her,\u201d he repeats with confidence. </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you do, Harry, you can\u2019t help who you fall for,\u201d you assure him.</p><p>\u201cFuck \u2014 will you just listen!\u201d he exclaims, running a hand frustratedly through his hair as he stands up from his position, pacing the wooden floor of your bedroom, clearly agitated at how the situation before him is playing out. \u201cI don\u2019t love Camille because \u2014\u201d he pauses, running a hand over his face, before turning back to you, \u201cbecause I fucking love you!\u201d he cries, gesturing towards you.</p><p>A deafening silence, paired with a suddenly uncomfortable atmosphere, surrounds you both, almost as though creating a barrier between the two of you. The howling of a harsh gust of wind rattles the garden fences that segregate yourself from your neighbours, and the rain lashing against at the glass panes of your windows are the only signs of life around you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>in love</i> with <i>you</i>, sweetheart,\u201d he murmurs softly, as he resumes his position on the bed opposite you, mirroring your demeanour. \u201cPlease say something,\u201d he practically begs, as he reaches for your hand once more, his thumb skimming your fingers and he breathes a noticeable sigh of relief when you don\u2019t flinch at the contact.</p><p>\u201cYou \u2014 you love me?\u201d you ask in disbelief.</p><p>He nods, pulling his bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes.</p><p>\u201cHow \u2014 how long?\u201d you ask, shocked.</p><p>He curls his hand into a fist, coughing lightly to clear his throat. \u201cAbout two years, roughly,\u201d he replies.</p><p>You frown, your brows creasing as you mentally put together the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle you envisage, revisiting two years worth of friendship and trying desperately to discover where along the line his feelings for you had developed further.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Harry, you must be confused,\u201d you mutter softly, shaking your head, almost refusing to believe his declaration of being in love with you. \u201cYou can\u2019t \u2014\u201d you begin, \u201c\u2014 you can\u2019t be in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2014\u201d he sighs, angry, feeling defeated as you have difficulty in understanding his feelings towards you. \u201cI\u2019m not confused, I just \u2014 I know how I feel!\u201d he exclaims, frustratedly. \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you for two years! I was just too self absorbed, focusing on the album to act on anything I felt, and then I had people around me trying to set me up with high profile celebrities \u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201cModels,\u201d you clarify, your expression pained.</p><p>He shakes his head, \u201cLook, it doesn\u2019t matter<i> who</i>, ok,\u201d he tells you. </p><p>Pausing, his eyes find the ceiling once more as he contemplates how to express himself, words wrestling with each other as they swim around his mind. He struggles to comprehend vocalising his feelings, before attempting his honesty once more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me this long to tell you,\u201d he apologises, opening his eyes to make contact with yours. \u201cI\u2019m a coward because I couldn\u2019t admit my feelings. I just \u2014 I can\u2019t be selfish with you, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelfish?\u201d you question with caution. \u201cHarry, you\u2019re the least selfish person I know,\u201d you assure him.</p><p>\u201cRuining our friendship would have been selfish of me,\u201d he shakes his head. \u201cDrawing you into a lifestyle like mine would be selfish. I can\u2019t drag you into a world \u2014 <i>my world</i>,\u201d he closes his hurt filled eyes for a second before continuing, \u201c \u2014 of publicity and judgement on everything you do. It chews you up and spits you out, and that\u2019s not a life I would promise to <i>anyone</i> I\u2019m in a relationship with, especially not you.\u201d</p><p>You nod, understanding his impassioned process of thinking.</p><p>\u201cLike you, I hoped that these feelings would just go away too \u2014 and when they didn\u2019t \u2014\u201d he pauses, his expression guilty as he struggles to maintain eye contact with you before his admission, \u201cI wished that you would go away instead. That\u2019s why I started ignoring you and for that, I am really sorry,\u201d he admits, biting at his bottom lip nervously.</p><p>\u201cH \u2014\u201d you begin with a heavy sigh.</p><p>\u201cSeeing you go on a date,\u201d he begins, before clarifying, \u201cIt felt like someone was stabbing me in the heart twenty times over because I felt like you were moving forwards with your life and I was no longer a part of it,\u201d he confesses. \u201cI thought maybe my feelings for you had just resurfaced, but in reality, they never left.\u201d</p><p>Once again, you nod before clarifying, \u201cIt was just a date, Harry. Nothing came of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he sighs. \u201cBut what if you really liked him? What if you were compatible with each other and everything went well? The next time I\u2019d hear from you would be in two years when you\u2019re getting married \u2018nd you\u2019re pregnant with his kid or somethin\u2019,\u201d he pouts.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just being silly,\u201d you tut at the sudden change in direction of the conversation, Harry fast forwarding years into your life. \u201cDo \u2014 do you really love me?\u201d you dare to ask, still having difficulty in comprehending the massive curveball he had thrown tonight.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes. \u201cWhy is that so hard for you to understand?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cBecause \u2014\u201d you gulp, \u201cbecause I\u2019m nothing,\u201d you shrug. \u201cYou could have any girl in the world \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stopping you right there. I don\u2019t want to listen to you belittle yourself. It\u2019s not necessary, and anything bad you say about yourself isn\u2019t true,\u201d he tells you, firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2014 fuck me, doll, you\u2019re perfect,\u201d he breathes softly, squeezing your hand reassuringly.</p><p>You twiddle your fingers together, intertwining them in your lap as you chew your bottom lip, struggling with the compliments he\u2019s paying you. You always found flattery difficult, unable to believe any sincere praise and admiration anyone has for you. </p><p>\u201cIt seemed that someone knew how you and I felt,\u201d he smirks, before pursing his lips together and his eyes rolling towards the ceiling, a breathy laugh escaping his lips.</p><p>You blush at the revelation, your cheeks reddening as you become flustered in front of the boy you\u2019d discussed your feelings with. You had never declared your feelings for Harry to any of his family, nor did you think you\u2019d made your adoration for him obvious to anyone. A medley of reasons contributed to your hidden feelings \u2014 inclusive of embarrassment, being knowledgeable enough to realise you\u2019re not Harry\u2019s usual type, worry of not being good enough, fear of rejection, but most of all, the apprehension of losing a lifelong best friend.</p><p>\u201cRobin knew,\u201d he clarifies, in an attempt to ease your suddenly obvious anxious state.</p><p>\u201cHe was a wise man,\u201d you tell him softly with a small nod of your head. A small lump forms at the base of your throat. Robin had been a trusting male figure in your life, and talking about Harry\u2019s step-father was still a raw and emotional topic for everyone following his battle with cancer.</p><p>\u201cHe certainly was. If he could see us now, he\u2019d probably bang our heads together,\u201d he gives you a small smile but with his bottom lip trembling, you know he\u2019ll likely reach breaking point within a short space of time. Your hand suddenly becomes the dominant one as you enclose his in your own, giving him a gentle squeeze of his fingers \u2014 a symbolic gesture that you\u2019re always here for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s up there laughing at us,\u201d you return the smile, knowing that Robin\u2019s sense of humour would be at the forefront of this situation. You raise Harry\u2019s hand to your lips, brushing them mindfully across his knuckles.</p><p>Harry scoffs, \u201cI promised him I wouldn\u2019t fuck up and that I\u2019d look after everyone around me. Now look at me, eh? Not even two years on and I\u2019ve already broken that promise,\u201d he whimpers at his own words. \u201cI just seem to be fucking everything up as of late,\u201d he trembles, wiping away at the tear that escapes in the hope that you don\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this to yourself, Harry, please,\u201d you beg that he\u2019s not harsh on himself at a difficult time. \u201cI know I haven\u2019t exactly made it easy telling you how I feel,\u201d you say. \u201cFor me and you to ever be in a relationship \u2014 the complexity of it,\u201d you stutter, unsure of how to approach the subject, \u201cIt just can\u2019t happen for us. It wouldn\u2019t be fair on you. You want to travel the world, make music and tour. Me? I\u2019m just plain and simple and boring \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not \u2014\u201d Harry attempts to cut you off but the threatening stare he receives from you as a warning \u2014 albeit jokingly \u2014 is enough to scold him for interrupting you.</p><p>\u201cI just want to settle down. I\u2019m ready for my life to move forwards,\u201d you tell him with integrity.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you sound like Gemma,\u201d he jokes, although he\u2019s had the immediate realisation of just how mature the young women in his life are actually becoming. \u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d he smirks, and you\u2019re only too appreciative that Harry \u2014 despite his glossy red rimmed eyes \u2014 seems to have regained a sense of humour and happiness. He sighs heavily before leaning forwards, resting his forehead against your own and resting his free hand on your knee, caressing your skin. </p><p>Butterflies flutter in your tummy at the close contact, your hot breaths fanning over each other\u2019s faces. Anxiousness is at the forefront of your emotions, and you can\u2019t help but feel a little disquieted as you consider the possibility that Harry will get your hopes up, only for you to be let down again by the same boy who appears before you. </p><p>The concept makes the metaphorical insects within you plummet to the pits of your stomach, the constant ache inside of you bubbling away and overpowering your sentiment. You\u2019re not sure you could overcome rejection if it arose after the day\u2019s intimacy between the two of you, the idea alone soul destroying.</p><p>You moisten your lips with your tongue, before quivering underneath his clement touch. \u201cHarry, I can\u2019t \u2014\u201d you mutter softly, closing your eyes. You quickly swing your legs over the edge of the bed, pulling your hand away from his before standing from the spot you had been sat and pacing into the centre of your bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t what, eh?\u201d he asks gently, his voice encouraging as he follows suit, close behind your frame. His eyes, filled with sympathy and empathy, watch you diligently from behind, as you fold your arms protectively across your chest. \u201cWhat can\u2019t ya do, darling?\u201d his thick accent resounds once more.</p><p>Your body instinctively twitches the moment his hand makes contact with your waist from behind you, his fingertips gently dancing on your hip. Despite the small flinch, you don\u2019t move away from Harry, and instead, you welcome his affectionate touch. You stare down at your naked feet \u2014 your nails painted a baby pink shade from the BarryM Under the Sea collection \u2014 twiddling the soft circular rug, which lies beneath your skin, between your toes. Composing yourself, you turn around to face the taller boy, his bottom lip pulled between his teeth as he looks down at you.</p><p>\u201c\u2018m sorry,\u201d you whisper softly.</p><p>Brushing a strand of hair away from your hair, he shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t apologise. We\u2019re both feeling pretty defensive right now, a lot\u2019s happened,\u201d he states. A momentary silence fills the tiny gap between you, before he finally plucks up the courage to express his desires. \u201cI want to try something, darling,\u201d he begins, a little hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019d like to try,\u201d he repeats, \u201cif you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>You nod, your body anticipating the next move the moment Harry\u2019s right hand makes contact with your jawline, his palm cupping your face as his thumb skims your cheekbone, his soothing gesture hoping that you\u2019ll relax in his embrace. </p><p>\u201c\u2019s just me yeah?\u201d he reminds you softly, yearning to rid you of any apprehension in the potentially awkward encounter. \u201c<i>Your</i> Harry.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s the first to lean in towards you, eyelids fluttering closed as his plush lips make contact with your trembling ones. Encouraging you closer towards him, he places his left hand on the small of your back and pulls your frame tentatively towards him, not forcing you into anything you don\u2019t feel comfortable with. </p><p>It\u2019s your next action that\u2019s the proof he needs. Your once clammy hands make contact with Harry, one snaking around the back of his neck as your thumb finds the sensitive spot behind his ear, making light work behind it as you stroke it gently. The other finds itself fisting through his hair, gently tugging at the curls at the nape of his neck. With a gentle tug of his locks, he moans into you, and he wonders how on earth he was able to deprive himself of this heaven for such a long time.</p><p>It\u2019s your turn to vocalise your gratification with a soft groan into his mouth as his hands caress your skin, passion ignited within you both. His lips form a narcissistic smile against yours as he realises that he\u2019s working you up. You feel giddy, like an inexperienced teenager having her seven minutes in heaven with her crush.</p><p>But you\u2019re with Harry, and his delicate touch and passionate kiss reminds you that whilst he\u2019ll lead you into this, you\u2019re the one in control of the situation, and you\u2019re always safe with him. Your lips greedily steal more kisses from him, his seemingly readily available for you. Each one becomes deeper as your tongues attempt to dominate each other\u2019s.</p><p>The sweet taste of him lingers on your tongue, along with a hint of saltiness \u2014 a mixture of both of your tears \u2014 as his hot breath fans over you throughout the affectionate embrace. A moan leaves his mouth in disappointment when you pull away breathlessly, your glossy eyes gazing up at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to do that more often,\u201d he pulls his face away and smiles down at you, not once losing body contact as his thumb continues to skim your cheek. \u201cOnly if you want me to,\u201d he continues.</p><p>Your giggly reply is the only confirmation he needs, \u201cI always want you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means you lied to me,\u201d he smirks.</p><p>You reply with a frown, your lips pouting as you display your confusion at his comment, whilst your fingertips continuously stroke the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou said nobody would kiss me with lips like these,\u201d he leans towards you and murmurs tauntingly close against your mouth, his lips dancing above your own once again.</p><p>\u201cShut up and kiss me, H,\u201d you whimper, hungrily stealing another kiss from him.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d he murmurs breathlessly between kisses. \u201cLove you \u2014 I love you, I love you,\u201d he repeats.</p><p>With his pants becoming breathier, you fight the internal battle of wanting him to tell you how much you mean to him, and needing the actions to follow up with his sincerity, and instead you settle on your audacious remark, begging him, \u201cSo show me you love me, then.\u201d</p>",

This was one of my requests from the <a href=\"http://drunkirkharry.tumblr.com/post/184207101982/200-dialogue-prompts\" target=\"_blank\">list of prompts</a> I reblogged earlier this week. It was supposed to be a prompt but this has actually turned into an 8K bestfriend!harry one shot,\u00a0 based on the angsty,<b> \u201cI can\u2019t remember why I ever loved you.\u201d</b>\u00a0Hopefully it\u2019s enough angst but you know I can\u2019t make Harry a <i>complete</i> dickhead! So we also feature fluff \u2014 like Easter chicks and bunnies, because it\u2019s that time of year again!</p><p><b>Please remember that feedback is always welcomed!</b></p><p>Also, Happy Easter to anyone celebrating \u2014 and if you\u2019re not celebrating, then I hope you have a lovely weekend, however you plan to spend it \u2014 and enjoy the chocolate eggs because you know, chocolate!</p><p><b>Cookie Monsters and Easter Bunnies.</b></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that all about?\u201d you ask incredulously, your burgundy Vans thundering heavily underneath your running legs and against the concrete as you chase after Harry into the car park of The Old Red Lion. </p><p>Visiting Harry and his family in Holmes Chapel had been a tradition for as long as you could remember when it came to birthdays, and Anne\u2019s birthday this year had been no different. With a table booked at the local Ember Inns - an authentic pub which prides itself in serving traditional British classics, affordable wines and ales, along with it\u2019s roaring log fires which welcome guests into the homely environment - a small gathering of family and close friends of Anne\u2019s had been invited to join the birthday celebrations.</p><p>You had arrived in Harry\u2019s childhood hometown a few hours prior to the event to spend some quality time with your best friend and his family. Yet, you couldn\u2019t fathom how he had behaved so unpredictably towards you throughout the course of the evening.</p><p>\u201cHarry, will you at least have the decency to look at me when I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d your voice suddenly booms into the night air as you follow closely behind the large male figure. </p><p>His footsteps instantly ease the moment you shout at him, his ears pricking up at your warning tone and his body immediately halting. Harry had never known you to shout - not at him, at least - within your years of close friendship. Slowly turning on his heel, he meets your gaze, only to be met with your teary eyes and a silence filling the space between you both.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he eventually asks, licking his lips.</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d you ask breathlessly, your chest heaving slightly as you shudder.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d he asks, nonchalantly, shrugging his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve barely spoken to me all night, H,\u201d you tell him, sadly.</p><p>\u201cI asked you how you are, I asked how work is for ya,\u201d he begins, pouting his bottom lip and scuffing his shoes against the concrete of the car park that you\u2019re undoubtedly about to have a disagreement in \u2014 because based on his attitude towards you, and you lacking the knowledge of why the sudden change in his behaviour, it\u2019s inevitable that at least one of you is going to be left heartbroken tonight.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and that\u2019s all you\u2019ve said,\u201d you whisper. \u201cYou haven\u2019t spoken to me in weeks, Harry. You came back to London for a few weeks before disappearing off the face of the earth again-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to LA,\u201d he clarifies gently.</p><p>\u201c\u2014 and you never bothered to message me?\u201d you ask, pulling the sleeves of your cardigan down over your thumbs before wrapping it around your shivering frame \u2014 you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s a defence mechanism or if you are genuinely cold.</p><p>\u201cMy life doesn\u2019t revolve around you!\u201d he half yells. </p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d you gulp, swallowing the lump in your throat.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you acting as if me not contacting you is a big deal?\u201d he asks, running his hands through his hair, tugging at the curls at the nape of his neck in frustration at how, unintentionally, disastrous the evening has played out.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t even just about you not contacting me. You\u2019ve been so flaky with me tonight and I don\u2019t even know why! You\u2019re my best friend, Harry, and you can barely string together two words and talk to me. I didn\u2019t even hear it from <i>you</i> that you were back in London a few weeks ago,\u201d you cry.</p><p>\u201cI was busy,\u201d he sighs, excusing his recent lack of communication.</p><p>\u201cSo I saw,\u201d you tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d he scoffs.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re busy, H,\u201d you begin, nodding your head in understanding at his situation regarding his fame, \u201cbut seeing the media posting pictures and articles of you meeting up with people, it\u2019s hard. You mean to tell me that you couldn\u2019t at least spare five minutes of your time to drop me a text to tell me you were home? You mean you were too busy to come and see me?\u201d</p><p>Since arriving back home to London, Harry had been sighted in North London pubs with a string of high profile celebrities, including the CEO of Sony. You were none the wiser as to whether these well-known males in the public eye were just friends of Harry\u2019s, or if they were involved in helping him achieve success with his upcoming album.</p><p>\u201cJust like you couldn\u2019t spare five minutes of <i>your</i> time to drop me a text and tell me you were going on a date?\u201d he attempts to bite back, but his voice fails him as the harsh tone he strives for refuses to deliver. Instead, you\u2019re met with his soft timbre, yet the hurt within his expression is enough to resonate into the autumn air. </p><p>\u201cThat \u2014\u201d you begin, struggling to form your words. The statement had caught you off guard, leaving you baffled. \u201cThis is what all of this has been about? You\u2019re pissed off at me because I didn\u2019t tell you I was going on a date?\u201d you ask, the crease on your forehead becoming more prominent as you struggle to comprehend Harry\u2019s emotions. \u201cI would have told you in person, you know, when you were back in London, when I thought we\u2019d <i>actually</i> see each other. Besides, there was nothing to tell \u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s quick to cut you off with a scoff and raised eyebrows. \u201cNothing to tell? Why are being so self-righteous? If I have to tell you everything that\u2019s going on in my life, then surely you should be telling me everything you\u2019re getting up to in yours?\u201d he counter argues. \u201cBut instead, I find out through fans on Twitter that my best friend is hooking up with some random guy.\u201d</p><p>You shrug your shoulders at his words, realising that perhaps he has a point. Whilst you find it devastating that you only know about Harry\u2019s movements via social media, you hadn\u2019t considered that maybe Harry feels equally as hurt when you don\u2019t openly discuss things with him either. He\u2019s your best friend, after all.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d have more important things to worry about,\u201d you murmur softly.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d he asks, awaiting your next answer.</p><p>Lowering your gaze to the ground, you gently chew your bottom lip, unsure of how to express yourself. Inhaling a deep breath, you continue, \u201cCamille,\u201d and your eyes squeeze shut at the sound of her name bitterly leaving your lips.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re jealous,\u201d he states. It wasn\u2019t a question and you both knew it.</p><p>You quickly shake your head, your heart thumping against your chest. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d The unwelcome taste of salt suddenly lingers on your lips and you know that the tears that had been threatening to spill over during your confrontation had done so. You only hoped Harry wouldn\u2019t notice as you bring your hand up to rid your cheeks of the track marks they most likely left. \u201cWhy are you so bothered anyway? Why do you care who I\u2019m dating?\u201d you quickly attempt to change the topic of conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bothered,\u201d he sneers. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit who you\u2019re fucking each week.\u201d</p><p>You struggle to decipher what is being communicated, his words stabbing at your heart as he cheapens your experiences \u2014 or rather lack of \u2014 with the opposite gender. Unable to prevent your bottom lip from trembling, you let out a small sob at your best friend\u2019s unrelenting words.</p><p>With glossy eyes and a shaky breath, you endeavour to maintain at least some dignity you may have within yourself as the conflict between the two of you persists. \u201cWhat, are<i> you</i> jealous?\u201d you bite back.</p><p>His disparaging smile speaks louder than words, but the remark that follows is one that resounds, \u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself.\u201d He spits his words venomously, cruelty expressed in his stance as he narrows his eyes at you.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d you sob. \u201cI\u2019ve been there for you through everything, Harry! And this is how you repay me?\u201d you cry. Disregarding the constant flow of tears from your red, blotchy cheeks with the back of your hand, you sigh heavily before taking a deep breath and continuing, \u201cIt\u2019s been so hard without you being around the past few months, and I was really looking forward to seeing you tonight and spending time together. But now? <b>I can\u2019t remember why I ever loved you</b>,\u201d you whimper.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Your eyes instantly widen at your disclosure \u2014 in shock, fear, surprise, and you\u2019re not even sure where the sudden declaration had come from. Your hidden feelings had never meant to be exposed \u2014 you dreamt most nights that you would both eventually be in a stable position in your lives where you could unselfishly confess your undying love for the boy in front of you. But this wasn\u2019t what you had envisaged, and you hadn\u2019t intended to overshadow Anne\u2019s birthday celebrations. You were only too grateful that the other adults had pursued their night of revelry within the comfort of the quaint pub, none the wiser of the events occurring in Harry\u2019s childhood village.</p><p>Perhaps the weight being lifted from deep within your heart had heightened your senses. A group of young men had drunkenly cheered, \u201cOi Oi,\u201d at the revelation, a scene more common in a rom-com movie that Harry most likely owned a copy of. The smoke from their cigarettes in the designated area lingered in the October sky, and you knew that you would have to wash your hair at least twice before you no longer smell like a bonfire. Besides the jibes from the young adults loitering in the pub car park, the only other sound heard in Holmes Chapel was the eery ringing of the bells at St Luke\u2019s Church behind you, and your heavy breathing, your hot breath forming a misty cloud before you.</p><p>\u201cYou \u2014\u201d Harry begins, scuffing the heel of his boot against the concrete as he places a hand on his hip, wetting his lips with his tongue, \u201c\u2014 you love me?\u201d he stammers.</p><p>\u201cI \u2014\u201d you stutter, fingers fumbling around in your clutch bag until you find the car key you desire. Grasping it between your thumb and forefinger, you step back slightly, almost losing your balance in the process.</p><p>Harry whispers your name gently in the cold breeze, your name effortlessly rolling off his tongue as though any cruel words he had spoken prior to your revelation had diminished. \u201cDarling?\u201d he tries again with a pet name, his Cheshire dialect pronouncing the word you love hear him vocalise so much.</p><p>His effort at comforting you with his soft tone proves to be unsuccessful as you take advantage of the space between you and run from him, your car within only a few steps. Even under pressure and with trembling fingers, you\u2019re able to unlock the door to the driver\u2019s side and climb into the car, locking it behind you as you ignore Harry\u2019s pleas, your mind blocking out the desperate call of your name whilst in pursuit of you.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters under his breath, running a hand through his hair as he watches you speed away from the pub \u2014 and indubitably from Holmes Chapel. He never wants you to run from him. Taking his bottom lip between his thumb and forefinger \u2014 a sign that he\u2019s in deep thought \u2014 he\u2019s left alone to ponder before reaching a decision that will affect his future.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Your hand firmly grips the handle of the Walt Disney Dumbo mug that houses your hot liquid as you trail up the stairs and back to your bedroom. Whilst recent events would be a satisfactory excuse to wallow, you didn\u2019t want to waste your day off hiding underneath your duvet and pitying yourself.</p><p>Instead, you had taken to playing online games and watching ridiculously romantic movies, whilst simultaneously rearranging your iTunes folder. In other words, you were busying yourself with unnecessary and menial tasks, but it proved to be a welcomed distraction, at least.</p><p>It had been a week, a whole seven days, since you had confessed your love to Harry. As you had expected, you\u2019d heard from him instantly upon your journey home \u2014 you\u2019d received several messages on the same night following your declaration, requesting that you either come back to Holmes Chapel and talk things through with him, answer your phone, or at least respond to his messages so as he knows you\u2019re safe. But since arriving back at your London home, it seemed as though Harry had given up all hope of contacting you.</p><p>Taking a sip of your hot chocolate, you inevitably smear whipped cream onto your nose, before placing the mug onto the coaster on your desk and seating yourself in the cushioned swivel chair. Tutting at the minor inconvenience, you wipe it away with the back of your hand before opening the lid to your computer and heading straight into the games section and loading your Sims family.</p><p>Beneath the cover of the chilly October skies, you took advantage of having the smallest bedroom window open onto the latch to allow fresh air to circulate the room. Your bedroom is aesthetically pleasing \u2014 the warm glow of a Yankee candle burning on your windowsill, the flickering flame reflecting against the darkness outside caused by the autumn season, and the battery powered moon phase fairy lights decorate the metal headboard of your bed, the small white lights displaying a warmth to your safe haven.</p><p>You\u2019re so immersed in your game that a knock at the front door barely distracts you. Taking a glance at the clock, you note that whilst it\u2019s not an unthinkable hour, you\u2019re home alone and it\u2019s dark outside. Only when the knocking becomes persistent do you remove yourself from the screen that\u2019s providing you with the evening\u2019s entertainment. You log out of your account, before sighing heavily as you trudge down the stairs. </p><p>Swinging the door open, you\u2019re surprised as to who the uninvited guest standing in the doorway is. You blink in disbelief, before being the first to break the silence between you.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, H?\u201d you ask, wrapping your arms around your frame protectively. There\u2019s a hint of annoyance in your voice at his unannounced visit, but sadness overpowers any other emotion that you\u2019re internally battling as the boy who broke your heart stands before you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to make amends,\u201d he gives you a small smile, \u201cif you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>You lower your gaze and chew your bottom lip gently, your eyes averting to his jewellery clad hand - his H and S Gucci rings dressing his fingers, expressing his narcissistic manner \u2014 yet you knew Harry better than anyone, and you would never describe him as a person who has excessive interest in himself.</p><p>The handle of a Tesco carrier bag is firmly within his hold and it warms your heart that even with his ever growing fame, he continues to carry out the dull task of high street shopping. \u201cI bought cookies,\u201d he smirks in an attempt to win you over, \u201cwith chocolate chips,\u201d he clarifies, once he notices your gaze upon the bag he\u2019s carrying.</p><p>You raise an eyebrow at him before frowning, pouting your lips ever so slightly. \u201cWhat chocolate chips?\u201d you dare to ask, suddenly realising that you sound like a five year old child having to be bribed by their parents to complete a household chore.</p><p>\u201cWhite chocolate, \u2019f course,\u201d his heart skipping a beat as a smile dances upon your lips \u2014 a smile that he had missed and desperately craved, especially after the agonisingly long week he\u2019d experienced. \u201cOnly the best for my favourite girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been your favourite girl for a few months now, Harry,\u201d you murmur, your features etched with disappointment and sadness as you purse your lips together and avert your sad gaze towards the concrete step he stands on, Harry\u2019s feet much too big for small paving slabs.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey doll, look at me,\u201d his soft voice encourages you to maintain eye contact as his fingertips reach for your elbow. </p><p>The comforting action achieves it\u2019s intention as your eyes scan his face. His boyish grin from only moments ago has disappeared and his expression is serious \u2014 apologetic. The slight tint of redness in his eyes is proof that he\u2019s tired, perhaps having had the same amount of restless nights as you.</p><p>\u201cYou goin\u2019 to let me in?\u201d he pushes the conversation gently. \u201cBecause as much as I love the cold and rain, I don\u2019t really fancy getting sick before the album release,\u201d he smirks. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want your cookies getting wet,\u201d he adds, pouting his lips.</p><p>You nod, rolling your eyes, but the small smile that reappears on your lips is enough to display to Harry that you\u2019re more than happy to have him within the comfort of your own home. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just in time, I made a hot chocolate. Do you want one?\u201d you ask, as you step back and allow him to enter the narrow hallway of your home.</p><p>\u201cSo I can see,\u201d he smirks, bopping your button nose with his forefinger. You mirror his expression as his playfulness displays itself, and he quickly licks the whipped cream, that he removed from the tip of your nose, off of his finger. \u201cSilly question, really, \u2018f course I\u2019ll have one,\u201d he laughs.</p><p>\u201cGo on, go upstairs and I\u2019ll bring it up,\u201d you tell him.</p><p>Kicking off his boots and leaving them beside the front door, he quickly obliges to your request and heads upstairs, leaving you to head to the kitchen to cater for him. Whilst Harry was more than capable of looking after himself, a small part of you always felt a need to mother him. </p><p>Reaching for the mugs in the cupboard, you knowingly pull out the blue porcelain one with the famous Sesame Street Cookie Monster Muppet on it, along with the childhood classic expression, \u201cMe want cookie! Om nom nom.\u201d You know your sense of humour would be welcomed by him when he eats his white chocolate chip cookie whilst drinking out of the Cookie Monster mug you provide for him. Within only a few minutes, you had made the milky drink and you head upstairs with Harry\u2019s hot chocolate. </p><p>\u201cHere you go, cream <i>and</i> marshmallows, don\u2019t say I never spoil you,\u201d you hum softly as you enter your bedroom. You almost drop the mug at the sight of Harry sat in the padded swivel chair, exploring your online game. \u201cHey, that\u2019s private!\u201d you exclaim. You quickly place the mug down onto your wooden dresser, before reaching for the desktop mouse within Harry\u2019s hand, removing it from his grip. </p><p>His boyish grin returns, paired with a laugh, before stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not private if I know your password. Told ya before, lovie, you shouldn\u2019t have the same password for everything, y\u2019know.\u201d </p><p>Giving you a wink, he stands from his spot, freeing the chair for you. Taking his mug of hot chocolate into his hands, he murmurs his gratitude to you before pacing to the other side of your bedroom and lowering himself onto your freshly made bed. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re married, I see?\u201d he asks rhetorically, raising an eyebrow as he nods towards your computer, referring to The Sims game you were previously playing prior to his unannounced arrival.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of getting a divorce,\u201d you murmur nonchalantly, as once again you log out of your account and focus your attention back to the young man \u2014 who seemed to make himself right at home propped up against the cushions with his legs outstretched \u2014 on your bed.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d he replies, taking a sip of his hot liquid. \u201cOn what grounds?\u201d he dares to ask, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>You shrug, \u201cOn the grounds that my husband accused me of fucking someone else every week,\u201d and despite your voice being of a quiet tone, there was a hint of bitterness to your words, clearly establishing that you won\u2019t forget some of Harry\u2019s vicious comments in a hurry. \u201cYou can keep the kids,\u201d you tell him. \u201cWe have two girls \u2014 they both have a very artistic side, can play the piano, and they enjoy swimming. They go to private school so are very academic. I\u2019m keeping the dog, she\u2019s a Golden Retriever and she\u2019s pregnant,\u201d you clarify. \u201cAnd so am I, because we woo hoo\u2019d a couple of weeks ago. Also, I have a date tonight,\u201d you add, filling him in on your fantasy life.</p><p>The last comment nearly makes Harry spit the mouthful of hot chocolate out onto your crisp white bed sheets, his pulse raging, his blood boiling, and his heart thumping within his chest as he fears he may have to decipher the metaphorical terminology you\u2019re potentially using.</p><p>He coughs, \u201cand do you?\u201d he asks. \u201cI mean, do you have a date tonight?\u201d</p><p>You shake your head. \u201cNo, not in real life,\u201d you confirm.</p><p>Harry instantly relaxes \u2014 his chest is no longer puffed and his breathing slows once again, his once hunched over shoulders suddenly release their tension, and his ringed fingers which were momentarily curled into a fist, whilst resting on his knee, are now outstretched before him again.</p><p>The flickering light within his peripheral vision is enough to distract him from his thoughts \u2014 even if only for a short time \u2014 and his eyes avert to the window sill of your bedroom which is home to a Yankee Candle. However, with four of them in your bedroom readily available to light at any one time, he\u2019s not sure how you make the tough decision of which scent you would like to indulge yourself in. It seemed that you were comforted by the Belgian Waffles aroma throughout the October nights, whilst Salt Mist Rose, Pink Sands, and Christmas Cookie take a back seat.</p><p>\u201cHow did \u2014\u201d he begins nervously, breaking the silence, \u201chow did your date go?\u201d he asks, placing his mug on the table beside him before leaning forwards ever so slightly at the sudden change of direction in conversation. He raises his left hand behind his head, resting the palm behind him as he subconsciously scratches the back of his head, simultaneously adjusting his right knee into an upright position.</p><p>You shrug, \u201cI didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an element of worry and fear in Harry\u2019s features, his brows furrowing, with creases appearing on the centre of his forehead. \u201cWhat \u2018appened? Do I need to kick his arse? Chop his bollocks off?\u201d his British accent somewhat stronger when he curses.</p><p>You laugh at his protectiveness, surprised at how quickly you had fallen back into your accustomed routine of friendship despite recent events. \u201cNothing happened,\u201d you ease his obvious anxiety with only two words. \u201cHe was a nice guy actually, we just didn\u2019t click. It\u2019s not my fault my heart\u2019s not in it. Ironically, somebody else has my heart. I just tried ignoring those feels in the hope they would go away, not realising that they wouldn\u2019t just disappear on their own,\u201d you smile sadly, chewing your bottom lip.</p><p>Harry pouts, bringing a hand up towards his face, his thumb and forefinger make light work of his plush lips as he caresses the chapped skin that the recent cold and windy weather had been responsible for biting away at. You reach into the top drawer of your dresser, pulling out a chapstick.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d you murmur softly, standing from your spot and heading towards him. You hand him the cosmetic as you lower yourself onto your bed opposite him, cross legged as he takes the product into his larger hands and holds it at each end.</p><p>Swivelling it around within his loose grip, he reads aloud the words printed on the yellow lidded cylindrical object, \u201cNivea, milk and honey,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cBit girly, init? Won\u2019t do much for my masculinity,\u201d he jokes with a small smile, but he removes the lid and applies the balm to his lips regardless.</p><p>\u201cWell, nobody\u2019s going to kiss you, not with lips like that,\u201d you murmur softly as you watch him evenly spread the salve, moisturising his dry skin. </p><p>His brows continue to furrow with his intent focus on the tedious \u2014 yet simplest \u2014 task. </p><p>\u201cYou know, if you keep frowning like that, you\u2019ll be left with worry lines,\u201d you tell him, reaching up and delicately caressing his forehead with your soft fingertips. You immediately still at your gesture of close contact. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you breathlessly whisper, hastily removing your hand from his face and grabbing for the closest object within reach \u2014 Mr Bunny \u2014 in an attempt to put a literal barrier between the two of you.</p><p>Harry shakes his head, \u201cDon\u2019t apologise. I like being touched by you,\u201d he murmurs softly. He reflects your posture, straightening his back and sitting upright, crossing his legs. Leaning forwards, he cautiously reaches for the hand you\u2019d rapidly withdrawn from him and envelopes it within his own.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t. Don\u2019t make it any harder than it already is,\u201d you beg in a whimper at his intimate actions and affectionate words that would usually uplift your spirits and put you on cloud nine. Now, his utterances seem like empty promises and that would only threaten to break you down further, weakening the confidence you\u2019d merely regained within the last few days.</p><p>It shatters Harry\u2019s heart when you pull your fingers out of his hold, instead, averting your attention and caress to Mr Bunny\u2019s long, floppy ears, your fingers twiddling with the off-white fluff of the stuffed animal sat securely within your lap.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I buy you this?\u201d he asks with a small smile, his voice remarkably composed as he battled internally with the bubbling anger towards himself along with ] the hurt he was experiencing at your apparent rejection of his touch.</p><p>It was a statement as opposed to a question, Harry remembering with clarity the day he entered the Build-a-Bear Workshop in the shopping mall as it fast approached Easter only a year ago. He had chosen the bunny rabbit solitarily, shamelessly stuffing him \u2014 with love, quite literally, as the floor manager handed him a heart shape and requested he press a kiss to it before fitting it within the teddy \u2014 before printing off a birth certificate and choosing a wrist accessory \u2014 an Easter flower bouquet consisting of three coloured roses \u2014 pink, yellow, and purple.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you laugh breathily, as he removes the soft toy from your lap and inspects it. \u201cYou know, most people buy their friend\u2019s Easter eggs that time of year,\u201d you smile up at him, meeting his gaze since the first time you\u2019d willingly expressed your endearment towards him with the tender touch of your fingertips. </p><p>\u2018I did get you an Easter egg,\u201d he cockily states with a smirk, simultaneously shrugging his shoulders whilst his hands cordially stroke the ears of the bunny now sat in his lap. \u201cA Crunchie one, if I remember correctly,\u201d he grins knowingly.</p><p>\u201cYou did get me a Crunchie one, but you bought me the teddy, too,\u201d you state matter of factly, attempting to prove the point of his need to go excessively overboard regarding buying gifts for his loved ones for an array of occasions that he could find any reason to celebrate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rabbit,\u201d he informs you.</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d you dismiss.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re actually not,\u201d he mumbles softly. \u201cAnyway, it was the flower bouquet as an accessory that made your smile burst into full bloom,\u201d he beams, his boyish grin returning once again as he teases you. \u201cYou do love your teddies,\u201d he notes, as he looks around your childhood bedroom.</p><p>Harry sought great comfort in the ordinary bedroom you possessed throughout your childhood. He had watched both you, and your living environment, mature with time. Your shelves displayed some of your most treasured possessions \u2014 photographs of yourself surrounded by the most important people in your life, and Harry was honoured to be included in the colour transparencies. </p><p>A star sign pot which housed your crystals stood on the same shelf \u2014 Harry couldn\u2019t understand your obsession with crystals and if he was honest, he didn\u2019t care that Obsidian, Quartz, Jasper and Moonstone possessed qualities inclusive of \u2014 but not limited to \u2014 healing, strength, wisdom, and protection, nor did he know the difference between the stones, but it\u2019s clear they serve an importance in your life as he notes that the pot is paired with a book titled, The Little Book of Crystals, which he knows, with little to no doubt, that it is a quirky Urban Outfitters purchase.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry suddenly murmurs, and his apologetic tone encourages you to both make eye contact with each other. \u201cI\u2019ve been a total dickhead,\u201d he admits, pouting before licking his lips, wetting the dry skin. He looks up, eyes finding the ceiling before he squeezes them shut. \u201cWe should talk about what happened,\u201d his words resonate within your bedroom.</p><p>As he regains his courage and looks back down at you, he\u2019s met with your glossy eyes, tears threatening to spill over as the confrontation you dreaded has finally materialised.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t cry,\u201d he whispers softly, his fingertips dancing on your knee as you remain cross legged before him. Your name rolls facilely off of his tongue. \u201cYou know I hate seeing you cry,\u201d he adds with complete integrity. </p><p>Harry places Mr Bunny beside him on the bed before reaching for the box of tissues on the bedside table. He instantly notices the novel, Turtles All the Way Down, accompanied by the turtle ornament he had bought for you following his visit to Jamaica, after having written and produced the first self-titled album. The attention to detail in your bedroom tugged at his heartstrings fractionally more as he realises that there\u2019s something so reassuring about the consistency you offer him when he returns home.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you murmur gratefully through your tears as you reach for a piece of the material. Removing a tissue from the box, you scrunch it into a ball before wiping away the streaky track marks that had stained your red cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI need you to be honest with me, angel. How long have you felt like this?\u201d he asks, gently pushing the topic.</p><p>Taking a deep and shaky breath, you reply with your answer. \u201cA while,\u201d you whimper as your chest heaves and your body shudders, your breathing become a little more erratic as your sobs increase.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, doll, it\u2019s just me,\u201d he murmurs softly, raising a hand to your cheek and resting his palm against you. \u201cIt\u2019s just me, init,\u201d he repeats his comforting statement as you seek reassurance from him, nuzzling your face into him as his thumb skims the salty tears on your skin. \u201cIt\u2019s Harry,<i> your</i> Harry,\u201d he confirms.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not <i>my</i> Harry,\u201d you quiver against his touch at your own words.</p><p>\u201cI decide who I do and don\u2019t belong to, and right now, I\u2019m telling you that I\u2019m<i> your</i> Harry,\u201d he states simply. \u201cIs this about what you said the other night? About me seeing Camille?\u201d he asks. His suspicions are confirmed when the unmistakable look of hurt lingers in your eyes, far too long for his liking. \u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters under his breath, \u201cfuck, doll, she\u2019s just a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that before,\u201d you tell him, a slight scoff emitting from your lips as you roll your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love her,\u201d he tells you firmly.</p><p>\u201cH,\u201d you sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d his voice is adamant, \u201cI don\u2019t love her,\u201d he repeats with confidence. </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you do, Harry, you can\u2019t help who you fall for,\u201d you assure him.</p><p>\u201cFuck \u2014 will you just listen!\u201d he exclaims, running a hand frustratedly through his hair as he stands up from his position, pacing the wooden floor of your bedroom, clearly agitated at how the situation before him is playing out. \u201cI don\u2019t love Camille because \u2014\u201d he pauses, running a hand over his face, before turning back to you, \u201cbecause I fucking love you!\u201d he cries, gesturing towards you.</p><p>A deafening silence, paired with a suddenly uncomfortable atmosphere, surrounds you both, almost as though creating a barrier between the two of you. The howling of a harsh gust of wind rattles the garden fences that segregate yourself from your neighbours, and the rain lashing against at the glass panes of your windows are the only signs of life around you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>in love</i> with <i>you</i>, sweetheart,\u201d he murmurs softly, as he resumes his position on the bed opposite you, mirroring your demeanour. \u201cPlease say something,\u201d he practically begs, as he reaches for your hand once more, his thumb skimming your fingers and he breathes a noticeable sigh of relief when you don\u2019t flinch at the contact.</p><p>\u201cYou \u2014 you love me?\u201d you ask in disbelief.</p><p>He nods, pulling his bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes.</p><p>\u201cHow \u2014 how long?\u201d you ask, shocked.</p><p>He curls his hand into a fist, coughing lightly to clear his throat. \u201cAbout two years, roughly,\u201d he replies.</p><p>You frown, your brows creasing as you mentally put together the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle you envisage, revisiting two years worth of friendship and trying desperately to discover where along the line his feelings for you had developed further.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Harry, you must be confused,\u201d you mutter softly, shaking your head, almost refusing to believe his declaration of being in love with you. \u201cYou can\u2019t \u2014\u201d you begin, \u201c\u2014 you can\u2019t be in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2014\u201d he sighs, angry, feeling defeated as you have difficulty in understanding his feelings towards you. \u201cI\u2019m not confused, I just \u2014 I know how I feel!\u201d he exclaims, frustratedly. \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you for two years! I was just too self absorbed, focusing on the album to act on anything I felt, and then I had people around me trying to set me up with high profile celebrities \u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201cModels,\u201d you clarify, your expression pained.</p><p>He shakes his head, \u201cLook, it doesn\u2019t matter<i> who</i>, ok,\u201d he tells you. </p><p>Pausing, his eyes find the ceiling once more as he contemplates how to express himself, words wrestling with each other as they swim around his mind. He struggles to comprehend vocalising his feelings, before attempting his honesty once more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me this long to tell you,\u201d he apologises, opening his eyes to make contact with yours. \u201cI\u2019m a coward because I couldn\u2019t admit my feelings. I just \u2014 I can\u2019t be selfish with you, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelfish?\u201d you question with caution. \u201cHarry, you\u2019re the least selfish person I know,\u201d you assure him.</p><p>\u201cRuining our friendship would have been selfish of me,\u201d he shakes his head. \u201cDrawing you into a lifestyle like mine would be selfish. I can\u2019t drag you into a world \u2014 <i>my world</i>,\u201d he closes his hurt filled eyes for a second before continuing, \u201c \u2014 of publicity and judgement on everything you do. It chews you up and spits you out, and that\u2019s not a life I would promise to <i>anyone</i> I\u2019m in a relationship with, especially not you.\u201d</p><p>You nod, understanding his impassioned process of thinking.</p><p>\u201cLike you, I hoped that these feelings would just go away too \u2014 and when they didn\u2019t \u2014\u201d he pauses, his expression guilty as he struggles to maintain eye contact with you before his admission, \u201cI wished that you would go away instead. That\u2019s why I started ignoring you and for that, I am really sorry,\u201d he admits, biting at his bottom lip nervously.</p><p>\u201cH \u2014\u201d you begin with a heavy sigh.</p><p>\u201cSeeing you go on a date,\u201d he begins, before clarifying, \u201cIt felt like someone was stabbing me in the heart twenty times over because I felt like you were moving forwards with your life and I was no longer a part of it,\u201d he confesses. \u201cI thought maybe my feelings for you had just resurfaced, but in reality, they never left.\u201d</p><p>Once again, you nod before clarifying, \u201cIt was just a date, Harry. Nothing came of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he sighs. \u201cBut what if you really liked him? What if you were compatible with each other and everything went well? The next time I\u2019d hear from you would be in two years when you\u2019re getting married \u2018nd you\u2019re pregnant with his kid or somethin\u2019,\u201d he pouts.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just being silly,\u201d you tut at the sudden change in direction of the conversation, Harry fast forwarding years into your life. \u201cDo \u2014 do you really love me?\u201d you dare to ask, still having difficulty in comprehending the massive curveball he had thrown tonight.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes. \u201cWhy is that so hard for you to understand?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cBecause \u2014\u201d you gulp, \u201cbecause I\u2019m nothing,\u201d you shrug. \u201cYou could have any girl in the world \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stopping you right there. I don\u2019t want to listen to you belittle yourself. It\u2019s not necessary, and anything bad you say about yourself isn\u2019t true,\u201d he tells you, firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2014 fuck me, doll, you\u2019re perfect,\u201d he breathes softly, squeezing your hand reassuringly.</p><p>You twiddle your fingers together, intertwining them in your lap as you chew your bottom lip, struggling with the compliments he\u2019s paying you. You always found flattery difficult, unable to believe any sincere praise and admiration anyone has for you. </p><p>\u201cIt seemed that someone knew how you and I felt,\u201d he smirks, before pursing his lips together and his eyes rolling towards the ceiling, a breathy laugh escaping his lips.</p><p>You blush at the revelation, your cheeks reddening as you become flustered in front of the boy you\u2019d discussed your feelings with. You had never declared your feelings for Harry to any of his family, nor did you think you\u2019d made your adoration for him obvious to anyone. A medley of reasons contributed to your hidden feelings \u2014 inclusive of embarrassment, being knowledgeable enough to realise you\u2019re not Harry\u2019s usual type, worry of not being good enough, fear of rejection, but most of all, the apprehension of losing a lifelong best friend.</p><p>\u201cRobin knew,\u201d he clarifies, in an attempt to ease your suddenly obvious anxious state.</p><p>\u201cHe was a wise man,\u201d you tell him softly with a small nod of your head. A small lump forms at the base of your throat. Robin had been a trusting male figure in your life, and talking about Harry\u2019s step-father was still a raw and emotional topic for everyone following his battle with cancer.</p><p>\u201cHe certainly was. If he could see us now, he\u2019d probably bang our heads together,\u201d he gives you a small smile but with his bottom lip trembling, you know he\u2019ll likely reach breaking point within a short space of time. Your hand suddenly becomes the dominant one as you enclose his in your own, giving him a gentle squeeze of his fingers \u2014 a symbolic gesture that you\u2019re always here for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s up there laughing at us,\u201d you return the smile, knowing that Robin\u2019s sense of humour would be at the forefront of this situation. You raise Harry\u2019s hand to your lips, brushing them mindfully across his knuckles.</p><p>Harry scoffs, \u201cI promised him I wouldn\u2019t fuck up and that I\u2019d look after everyone around me. Now look at me, eh? Not even two years on and I\u2019ve already broken that promise,\u201d he whimpers at his own words. \u201cI just seem to be fucking everything up as of late,\u201d he trembles, wiping away at the tear that escapes in the hope that you don\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this to yourself, Harry, please,\u201d you beg that he\u2019s not harsh on himself at a difficult time. \u201cI know I haven\u2019t exactly made it easy telling you how I feel,\u201d you say. \u201cFor me and you to ever be in a relationship \u2014 the complexity of it,\u201d you stutter, unsure of how to approach the subject, \u201cIt just can\u2019t happen for us. It wouldn\u2019t be fair on you. You want to travel the world, make music and tour. Me? I\u2019m just plain and simple and boring \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not \u2014\u201d Harry attempts to cut you off but the threatening stare he receives from you as a warning \u2014 albeit jokingly \u2014 is enough to scold him for interrupting you.</p><p>\u201cI just want to settle down. I\u2019m ready for my life to move forwards,\u201d you tell him with integrity.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you sound like Gemma,\u201d he jokes, although he\u2019s had the immediate realisation of just how mature the young women in his life are actually becoming. \u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d he smirks, and you\u2019re only too appreciative that Harry \u2014 despite his glossy red rimmed eyes \u2014 seems to have regained a sense of humour and happiness. He sighs heavily before leaning forwards, resting his forehead against your own and resting his free hand on your knee, caressing your skin. </p><p>Butterflies flutter in your tummy at the close contact, your hot breaths fanning over each other\u2019s faces. Anxiousness is at the forefront of your emotions, and you can\u2019t help but feel a little disquieted as you consider the possibility that Harry will get your hopes up, only for you to be let down again by the same boy who appears before you. </p><p>The concept makes the metaphorical insects within you plummet to the pits of your stomach, the constant ache inside of you bubbling away and overpowering your sentiment. You\u2019re not sure you could overcome rejection if it arose after the day\u2019s intimacy between the two of you, the idea alone soul destroying.</p><p>You moisten your lips with your tongue, before quivering underneath his clement touch. \u201cHarry, I can\u2019t \u2014\u201d you mutter softly, closing your eyes. You quickly swing your legs over the edge of the bed, pulling your hand away from his before standing from the spot you had been sat and pacing into the centre of your bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t what, eh?\u201d he asks gently, his voice encouraging as he follows suit, close behind your frame. His eyes, filled with sympathy and empathy, watch you diligently from behind, as you fold your arms protectively across your chest. \u201cWhat can\u2019t ya do, darling?\u201d his thick accent resounds once more.</p><p>Your body instinctively twitches the moment his hand makes contact with your waist from behind you, his fingertips gently dancing on your hip. Despite the small flinch, you don\u2019t move away from Harry, and instead, you welcome his affectionate touch. You stare down at your naked feet \u2014 your nails painted a baby pink shade from the BarryM Under the Sea collection \u2014 twiddling the soft circular rug, which lies beneath your skin, between your toes. Composing yourself, you turn around to face the taller boy, his bottom lip pulled between his teeth as he looks down at you.</p><p>\u201c\u2018m sorry,\u201d you whisper softly.</p><p>Brushing a strand of hair away from your hair, he shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t apologise. We\u2019re both feeling pretty defensive right now, a lot\u2019s happened,\u201d he states. A momentary silence fills the tiny gap between you, before he finally plucks up the courage to express his desires. \u201cI want to try something, darling,\u201d he begins, a little hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019d like to try,\u201d he repeats, \u201cif you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>You nod, your body anticipating the next move the moment Harry\u2019s right hand makes contact with your jawline, his palm cupping your face as his thumb skims your cheekbone, his soothing gesture hoping that you\u2019ll relax in his embrace. </p><p>\u201c\u2019s just me yeah?\u201d he reminds you softly, yearning to rid you of any apprehension in the potentially awkward encounter. \u201c<i>Your</i> Harry.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s the first to lean in towards you, eyelids fluttering closed as his plush lips make contact with your trembling ones. Encouraging you closer towards him, he places his left hand on the small of your back and pulls your frame tentatively towards him, not forcing you into anything you don\u2019t feel comfortable with. </p><p>It\u2019s your next action that\u2019s the proof he needs. Your once clammy hands make contact with Harry, one snaking around the back of his neck as your thumb finds the sensitive spot behind his ear, making light work behind it as you stroke it gently. The other finds itself fisting through his hair, gently tugging at the curls at the nape of his neck. With a gentle tug of his locks, he moans into you, and he wonders how on earth he was able to deprive himself of this heaven for such a long time.</p><p>It\u2019s your turn to vocalise your gratification with a soft groan into his mouth as his hands caress your skin, passion ignited within you both. His lips form a narcissistic smile against yours as he realises that he\u2019s working you up. You feel giddy, like an inexperienced teenager having her seven minutes in heaven with her crush.</p><p>But you\u2019re with Harry, and his delicate touch and passionate kiss reminds you that whilst he\u2019ll lead you into this, you\u2019re the one in control of the situation, and you\u2019re always safe with him. Your lips greedily steal more kisses from him, his seemingly readily available for you. Each one becomes deeper as your tongues attempt to dominate each other\u2019s.</p><p>The sweet taste of him lingers on your tongue, along with a hint of saltiness \u2014 a mixture of both of your tears \u2014 as his hot breath fans over you throughout the affectionate embrace. A moan leaves his mouth in disappointment when you pull away breathlessly, your glossy eyes gazing up at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to do that more often,\u201d he pulls his face away and smiles down at you, not once losing body contact as his thumb continues to skim your cheek. \u201cOnly if you want me to,\u201d he continues.</p><p>Your giggly reply is the only confirmation he needs, \u201cI always want you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means you lied to me,\u201d he smirks.</p><p>You reply with a frown, your lips pouting as you display your confusion at his comment, whilst your fingertips continuously stroke the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou said nobody would kiss me with lips like these,\u201d he leans towards you and murmurs tauntingly close against your mouth, his lips dancing above your own once again.</p><p>\u201cShut up and kiss me, H,\u201d you whimper, hungrily stealing another kiss from him.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d he murmurs breathlessly between kisses. \u201cLove you \u2014 I love you, I love you,\u201d he repeats.</p><p>With his pants becoming breathier, you fight the internal battle of wanting him to tell you how much you mean to him, and needing the actions to follow up with his sincerity, and instead you settle on your audacious remark, begging him, \u201cSo show me you love me, then.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p>Hey everyone! This was one of my requests from the <a href=\"http://drunkirkharry.tumblr.com/post/184207101982/200-dialogue-prompts\" target=\"_blank\">list of prompts</a> I reblogged earlier this week. It was supposed to be a prompt but this has actually turned into an 8K bestfriend!harry one shot,&nbsp; based on the angsty,<b> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember why I ever loved you.&rdquo;</b>&nbsp;Hopefully it&rsquo;s enough angst but you know I can&rsquo;t make Harry a <i>complete</i> dickhead! So we also feature fluff &mdash; like Easter chicks and bunnies, because it&rsquo;s that time of year again!</p><p><b>Please remember that feedback is always welcomed!</b></p><p>Also, Happy Easter to anyone celebrating &mdash; and if you&rsquo;re not celebrating, then I hope you have a lovely weekend, however you plan to spend it &mdash; and enjoy the chocolate eggs because you know, chocolate!</p><p><b>Cookie Monsters and Easter Bunnies.</b></p><p>&ldquo;What the hell was that all about?&rdquo; you ask incredulously, your burgundy Vans thundering heavily underneath your running legs and against the concrete as you chase after Harry into the car park of The Old Red Lion. </p><p>Visiting Harry and his family in Holmes Chapel had been a tradition for as long as you could remember when it came to birthdays, and Anne&rsquo;s birthday this year had been no different. With a table booked at the local Ember Inns - an authentic pub which prides itself in serving traditional British classics, affordable wines and ales, along with it&rsquo;s roaring log fires which welcome guests into the homely environment - a small gathering of family and close friends of Anne&rsquo;s had been invited to join the birthday celebrations.</p><p>You had arrived in Harry&rsquo;s childhood hometown a few hours prior to the event to spend some quality time with your best friend and his family. Yet, you couldn&rsquo;t fathom how he had behaved so unpredictably towards you throughout the course of the evening.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, will you at least have the decency to look at me when I&rsquo;m talking to you!&rdquo; your voice suddenly booms into the night air as you follow closely behind the large male figure. </p><p>His footsteps instantly ease the moment you shout at him, his ears pricking up at your warning tone and his body immediately halting. Harry had never known you to shout - not at him, at least - within your years of close friendship. Slowly turning on his heel, he meets your gaze, only to be met with your teary eyes and a silence filling the space between you both.</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he eventually asks, licking his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo; you ask breathlessly, your chest heaving slightly as you shudder.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want me to say?&rdquo; he asks, nonchalantly, shrugging his shoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve barely spoken to me all night, H,&rdquo; you tell him, sadly.</p><p>&ldquo;I asked you how you are, I asked how work is for ya,&rdquo; he begins, pouting his bottom lip and scuffing his shoes against the concrete of the car park that you&rsquo;re undoubtedly about to have a disagreement in &mdash; because based on his attitude towards you, and you lacking the knowledge of why the sudden change in his behaviour, it&rsquo;s inevitable that at least one of you is going to be left heartbroken tonight.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, and that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve said,&rdquo; you whisper. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t spoken to me in weeks, Harry. You came back to London for a few weeks before disappearing off the face of the earth again-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I went to LA,&rdquo; he clarifies gently.</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash; and you never bothered to message me?&rdquo; you ask, pulling the sleeves of your cardigan down over your thumbs before wrapping it around your shivering frame &mdash; you&rsquo;re not sure if it&rsquo;s a defence mechanism or if you are genuinely cold.</p><p>&ldquo;My life doesn&rsquo;t revolve around you!&rdquo; he half yells. </p><p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; you gulp, swallowing the lump in your throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you acting as if me not contacting you is a big deal?&rdquo; he asks, running his hands through his hair, tugging at the curls at the nape of his neck in frustration at how, unintentionally, disastrous the evening has played out.</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t even just about you not contacting me. You&rsquo;ve been so flaky with me tonight and I don&rsquo;t even know why! You&rsquo;re my best friend, Harry, and you can barely string together two words and talk to me. I didn&rsquo;t even hear it from <i>you</i> that you were back in London a few weeks ago,&rdquo; you cry.</p><p>&ldquo;I was busy,&rdquo; he sighs, excusing his recent lack of communication.</p><p>&ldquo;So I saw,&rdquo; you tell him.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell is that supposed to mean?&rdquo; he scoffs.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re busy, H,&rdquo; you begin, nodding your head in understanding at his situation regarding his fame, &ldquo;but seeing the media posting pictures and articles of you meeting up with people, it&rsquo;s hard. You mean to tell me that you couldn&rsquo;t at least spare five minutes of your time to drop me a text to tell me you were home? You mean you were too busy to come and see me?&rdquo;</p><p>Since arriving back home to London, Harry had been sighted in North London pubs with a string of high profile celebrities, including the CEO of Sony. You were none the wiser as to whether these well-known males in the public eye were just friends of Harry&rsquo;s, or if they were involved in helping him achieve success with his upcoming album.</p><p>&ldquo;Just like you couldn&rsquo;t spare five minutes of <i>your</i> time to drop me a text and tell me you were going on a date?&rdquo; he attempts to bite back, but his voice fails him as the harsh tone he strives for refuses to deliver. Instead, you&rsquo;re met with his soft timbre, yet the hurt within his expression is enough to resonate into the autumn air. </p><p>&ldquo;That &mdash;&rdquo; you begin, struggling to form your words. The statement had caught you off guard, leaving you baffled. &ldquo;This is what all of this has been about? You&rsquo;re pissed off at me because I didn&rsquo;t tell you I was going on a date?&rdquo; you ask, the crease on your forehead becoming more prominent as you struggle to comprehend Harry&rsquo;s emotions. &ldquo;I would have told you in person, you know, when you were back in London, when I thought we&rsquo;d <i>actually</i> see each other. Besides, there was nothing to tell &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s quick to cut you off with a scoff and raised eyebrows. &ldquo;Nothing to tell? Why are being so self-righteous? If I have to tell you everything that&rsquo;s going on in my life, then surely you should be telling me everything you&rsquo;re getting up to in yours?&rdquo; he counter argues. &ldquo;But instead, I find out through fans on Twitter that my best friend is hooking up with some random guy.&rdquo;</p><p>You shrug your shoulders at his words, realising that perhaps he has a point. Whilst you find it devastating that you only know about Harry&rsquo;s movements via social media, you hadn&rsquo;t considered that maybe Harry feels equally as hurt when you don&rsquo;t openly discuss things with him either. He&rsquo;s your best friend, after all.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d have more important things to worry about,&rdquo; you murmur softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; he asks, awaiting your next answer.</p><p>Lowering your gaze to the ground, you gently chew your bottom lip, unsure of how to express yourself. Inhaling a deep breath, you continue, &ldquo;Camille,&rdquo; and your eyes squeeze shut at the sound of her name bitterly leaving your lips.</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re jealous,&rdquo; he states. It wasn&rsquo;t a question and you both knew it.</p><p>You quickly shake your head, your heart thumping against your chest. &ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo; The unwelcome taste of salt suddenly lingers on your lips and you know that the tears that had been threatening to spill over during your confrontation had done so. You only hoped Harry wouldn&rsquo;t notice as you bring your hand up to rid your cheeks of the track marks they most likely left. &ldquo;Why are you so bothered anyway? Why do you care who I&rsquo;m dating?&rdquo; you quickly attempt to change the topic of conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bothered,&rdquo; he sneers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a shit who you&rsquo;re fucking each week.&rdquo;</p><p>You struggle to decipher what is being communicated, his words stabbing at your heart as he cheapens your experiences &mdash; or rather lack of &mdash; with the opposite gender. Unable to prevent your bottom lip from trembling, you let out a small sob at your best friend&rsquo;s unrelenting words.</p><p>With glossy eyes and a shaky breath, you endeavour to maintain at least some dignity you may have within yourself as the conflict between the two of you persists. &ldquo;What, are<i> you</i> jealous?&rdquo; you bite back.</p><p>His disparaging smile speaks louder than words, but the remark that follows is one that resounds, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself.&rdquo; He spits his words venomously, cruelty expressed in his stance as he narrows his eyes at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; you sob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been there for you through everything, Harry! And this is how you repay me?&rdquo; you cry. Disregarding the constant flow of tears from your red, blotchy cheeks with the back of your hand, you sigh heavily before taking a deep breath and continuing, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so hard without you being around the past few months, and I was really looking forward to seeing you tonight and spending time together. But now? <b>I can&rsquo;t remember why I ever loved you</b>,&rdquo; you whimper.</p><p>Your eyes instantly widen at your disclosure &mdash; in shock, fear, surprise, and you&rsquo;re not even sure where the sudden declaration had come from. Your hidden feelings had never meant to be exposed &mdash; you dreamt most nights that you would both eventually be in a stable position in your lives where you could unselfishly confess your undying love for the boy in front of you. But this wasn&rsquo;t what you had envisaged, and you hadn&rsquo;t intended to overshadow Anne&rsquo;s birthday celebrations. You were only too grateful that the other adults had pursued their night of revelry within the comfort of the quaint pub, none the wiser of the events occurring in Harry&rsquo;s childhood village.</p><p>Perhaps the weight being lifted from deep within your heart had heightened your senses. A group of young men had drunkenly cheered, &ldquo;Oi Oi,&rdquo; at the revelation, a scene more common in a rom-com movie that Harry most likely owned a copy of. The smoke from their cigarettes in the designated area lingered in the October sky, and you knew that you would have to wash your hair at least twice before you no longer smell like a bonfire. Besides the jibes from the young adults loitering in the pub car park, the only other sound heard in Holmes Chapel was the eery ringing of the bells at St Luke&rsquo;s Church behind you, and your heavy breathing, your hot breath forming a misty cloud before you.</p><p>&ldquo;You &mdash;&rdquo; Harry begins, scuffing the heel of his boot against the concrete as he places a hand on his hip, wetting his lips with his tongue, &ldquo;&mdash; you love me?&rdquo; he stammers.</p><p>&ldquo;I &mdash;&rdquo; you stutter, fingers fumbling around in your clutch bag until you find the car key you desire. Grasping it between your thumb and forefinger, you step back slightly, almost losing your balance in the process.</p><p>Harry whispers your name gently in the cold breeze, your name effortlessly rolling off his tongue as though any cruel words he had spoken prior to your revelation had diminished. &ldquo;Darling?&rdquo; he tries again with a pet name, his Cheshire dialect pronouncing the word you love hear him vocalise so much.</p><p>His effort at comforting you with his soft tone proves to be unsuccessful as you take advantage of the space between you and run from him, your car within only a few steps. Even under pressure and with trembling fingers, you&rsquo;re able to unlock the door to the driver&rsquo;s side and climb into the car, locking it behind you as you ignore Harry&rsquo;s pleas, your mind blocking out the desperate call of your name whilst in pursuit of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; he mutters under his breath, running a hand through his hair as he watches you speed away from the pub &mdash; and indubitably from Holmes Chapel. He never wants you to run from him. Taking his bottom lip between his thumb and forefinger &mdash; a sign that he&rsquo;s in deep thought &mdash; he&rsquo;s left alone to ponder before reaching a decision that will affect his future.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Your hand firmly grips the handle of the Walt Disney Dumbo mug that houses your hot liquid as you trail up the stairs and back to your bedroom. Whilst recent events would be a satisfactory excuse to wallow, you didn&rsquo;t want to waste your day off hiding underneath your duvet and pitying yourself.</p><p>Instead, you had taken to playing online games and watching ridiculously romantic movies, whilst simultaneously rearranging your iTunes folder. In other words, you were busying yourself with unnecessary and menial tasks, but it proved to be a welcomed distraction, at least.</p><p>It had been a week, a whole seven days, since you had confessed your love to Harry. As you had expected, you&rsquo;d heard from him instantly upon your journey home &mdash; you&rsquo;d received several messages on the same night following your declaration, requesting that you either come back to Holmes Chapel and talk things through with him, answer your phone, or at least respond to his messages so as he knows you&rsquo;re safe. But since arriving back at your London home, it seemed as though Harry had given up all hope of contacting you.</p><p>Taking a sip of your hot chocolate, you inevitably smear whipped cream onto your nose, before placing the mug onto the coaster on your desk and seating yourself in the cushioned swivel chair. Tutting at the minor inconvenience, you wipe it away with the back of your hand before opening the lid to your computer and heading straight into the games section and loading your Sims family.</p><p>Beneath the cover of the chilly October skies, you took advantage of having the smallest bedroom window open onto the latch to allow fresh air to circulate the room. Your bedroom is aesthetically pleasing &mdash; the warm glow of a Yankee candle burning on your windowsill, the flickering flame reflecting against the darkness outside caused by the autumn season, and the battery powered moon phase fairy lights decorate the metal headboard of your bed, the small white lights displaying a warmth to your safe haven.</p><p>You&rsquo;re so immersed in your game that a knock at the front door barely distracts you. Taking a glance at the clock, you note that whilst it&rsquo;s not an unthinkable hour, you&rsquo;re home alone and it&rsquo;s dark outside. Only when the knocking becomes persistent do you remove yourself from the screen that&rsquo;s providing you with the evening&rsquo;s entertainment. You log out of your account, before sighing heavily as you trudge down the stairs. </p><p>Swinging the door open, you&rsquo;re surprised as to who the uninvited guest standing in the doorway is. You blink in disbelief, before being the first to break the silence between you.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, H?&rdquo; you ask, wrapping your arms around your frame protectively. There&rsquo;s a hint of annoyance in your voice at his unannounced visit, but sadness overpowers any other emotion that you&rsquo;re internally battling as the boy who broke your heart stands before you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to make amends,&rdquo; he gives you a small smile, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo;</p><p>You lower your gaze and chew your bottom lip gently, your eyes averting to his jewellery clad hand - his H and S Gucci rings dressing his fingers, expressing his narcissistic manner &mdash; yet you knew Harry better than anyone, and you would never describe him as a person who has excessive interest in himself.</p><p>The handle of a Tesco carrier bag is firmly within his hold and it warms your heart that even with his ever growing fame, he continues to carry out the dull task of high street shopping. &ldquo;I bought cookies,&rdquo; he smirks in an attempt to win you over, &ldquo;with chocolate chips,&rdquo; he clarifies, once he notices your gaze upon the bag he&rsquo;s carrying.</p><p>You raise an eyebrow at him before frowning, pouting your lips ever so slightly. &ldquo;What chocolate chips?&rdquo; you dare to ask, suddenly realising that you sound like a five year old child having to be bribed by their parents to complete a household chore.</p><p>&ldquo;White chocolate, &rsquo;f course,&rdquo; his heart skipping a beat as a smile dances upon your lips &mdash; a smile that he had missed and desperately craved, especially after the agonisingly long week he&rsquo;d experienced. &ldquo;Only the best for my favourite girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been your favourite girl for a few months now, Harry,&rdquo; you murmur, your features etched with disappointment and sadness as you purse your lips together and avert your sad gaze towards the concrete step he stands on, Harry&rsquo;s feet much too big for small paving slabs.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey doll, look at me,&rdquo; his soft voice encourages you to maintain eye contact as his fingertips reach for your elbow. </p><p>The comforting action achieves it&rsquo;s intention as your eyes scan his face. His boyish grin from only moments ago has disappeared and his expression is serious &mdash; apologetic. The slight tint of redness in his eyes is proof that he&rsquo;s tired, perhaps having had the same amount of restless nights as you.</p><p>&ldquo;You goin&rsquo; to let me in?&rdquo; he pushes the conversation gently. &ldquo;Because as much as I love the cold and rain, I don&rsquo;t really fancy getting sick before the album release,&rdquo; he smirks. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want your cookies getting wet,&rdquo; he adds, pouting his lips.</p><p>You nod, rolling your eyes, but the small smile that reappears on your lips is enough to display to Harry that you&rsquo;re more than happy to have him within the comfort of your own home. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just in time, I made a hot chocolate. Do you want one?&rdquo; you ask, as you step back and allow him to enter the narrow hallway of your home.</p><p>&ldquo;So I can see,&rdquo; he smirks, bopping your button nose with his forefinger. You mirror his expression as his playfulness displays itself, and he quickly licks the whipped cream, that he removed from the tip of your nose, off of his finger. &ldquo;Silly question, really, &lsquo;f course I&rsquo;ll have one,&rdquo; he laughs.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on, go upstairs and I&rsquo;ll bring it up,&rdquo; you tell him.</p><p>Kicking off his boots and leaving them beside the front door, he quickly obliges to your request and heads upstairs, leaving you to head to the kitchen to cater for him. Whilst Harry was more than capable of looking after himself, a small part of you always felt a need to mother him. </p><p>Reaching for the mugs in the cupboard, you knowingly pull out the blue porcelain one with the famous Sesame Street Cookie Monster Muppet on it, along with the childhood classic expression, &ldquo;Me want cookie! Om nom nom.&rdquo; You know your sense of humour would be welcomed by him when he eats his white chocolate chip cookie whilst drinking out of the Cookie Monster mug you provide for him. Within only a few minutes, you had made the milky drink and you head upstairs with Harry&rsquo;s hot chocolate. </p><p>&ldquo;Here you go, cream <i>and</i> marshmallows, don&rsquo;t say I never spoil you,&rdquo; you hum softly as you enter your bedroom. You almost drop the mug at the sight of Harry sat in the padded swivel chair, exploring your online game. &ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s private!&rdquo; you exclaim. You quickly place the mug down onto your wooden dresser, before reaching for the desktop mouse within Harry&rsquo;s hand, removing it from his grip. </p><p>His boyish grin returns, paired with a laugh, before stating, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not private if I know your password. Told ya before, lovie, you shouldn&rsquo;t have the same password for everything, y&rsquo;know.&rdquo; </p><p>Giving you a wink, he stands from his spot, freeing the chair for you. Taking his mug of hot chocolate into his hands, he murmurs his gratitude to you before pacing to the other side of your bedroom and lowering himself onto your freshly made bed. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re married, I see?&rdquo; he asks rhetorically, raising an eyebrow as he nods towards your computer, referring to The Sims game you were previously playing prior to his unannounced arrival.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the process of getting a divorce,&rdquo; you murmur nonchalantly, as once again you log out of your account and focus your attention back to the young man &mdash; who seemed to make himself right at home propped up against the cushions with his legs outstretched &mdash; on your bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Touch&eacute;,&rdquo; he replies, taking a sip of his hot liquid. &ldquo;On what grounds?&rdquo; he dares to ask, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>You shrug, &ldquo;On the grounds that my husband accused me of fucking someone else every week,&rdquo; and despite your voice being of a quiet tone, there was a hint of bitterness to your words, clearly establishing that you won&rsquo;t forget some of Harry&rsquo;s vicious comments in a hurry. &ldquo;You can keep the kids,&rdquo; you tell him. &ldquo;We have two girls &mdash; they both have a very artistic side, can play the piano, and they enjoy swimming. They go to private school so are very academic. I&rsquo;m keeping the dog, she&rsquo;s a Golden Retriever and she&rsquo;s pregnant,&rdquo; you clarify. &ldquo;And so am I, because we woo hoo&rsquo;d a couple of weeks ago. Also, I have a date tonight,&rdquo; you add, filling him in on your fantasy life.</p><p>The last comment nearly makes Harry spit the mouthful of hot chocolate out onto your crisp white bed sheets, his pulse raging, his blood boiling, and his heart thumping within his chest as he fears he may have to decipher the metaphorical terminology you&rsquo;re potentially using.</p><p>He coughs, &ldquo;and do you?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;I mean, do you have a date tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>You shake your head. &ldquo;No, not in real life,&rdquo; you confirm.</p><p>Harry instantly relaxes &mdash; his chest is no longer puffed and his breathing slows once again, his once hunched over shoulders suddenly release their tension, and his ringed fingers which were momentarily curled into a fist, whilst resting on his knee, are now outstretched before him again.</p><p>The flickering light within his peripheral vision is enough to distract him from his thoughts &mdash; even if only for a short time &mdash; and his eyes avert to the window sill of your bedroom which is home to a Yankee Candle. However, with four of them in your bedroom readily available to light at any one time, he&rsquo;s not sure how you make the tough decision of which scent you would like to indulge yourself in. It seemed that you were comforted by the Belgian Waffles aroma throughout the October nights, whilst Salt Mist Rose, Pink Sands, and Christmas Cookie take a back seat.</p><p>&ldquo;How did &mdash;&rdquo; he begins nervously, breaking the silence, &ldquo;how did your date go?&rdquo; he asks, placing his mug on the table beside him before leaning forwards ever so slightly at the sudden change of direction in conversation. He raises his left hand behind his head, resting the palm behind him as he subconsciously scratches the back of his head, simultaneously adjusting his right knee into an upright position.</p><p>You shrug, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s an element of worry and fear in Harry&rsquo;s features, his brows furrowing, with creases appearing on the centre of his forehead. &ldquo;What &lsquo;appened? Do I need to kick his arse? Chop his bollocks off?&rdquo; his British accent somewhat stronger when he curses.</p><p>You laugh at his protectiveness, surprised at how quickly you had fallen back into your accustomed routine of friendship despite recent events. &ldquo;Nothing happened,&rdquo; you ease his obvious anxiety with only two words. &ldquo;He was a nice guy actually, we just didn&rsquo;t click. It&rsquo;s not my fault my heart&rsquo;s not in it. Ironically, somebody else has my heart. I just tried ignoring those feels in the hope they would go away, not realising that they wouldn&rsquo;t just disappear on their own,&rdquo; you smile sadly, chewing your bottom lip.</p><p>Harry pouts, bringing a hand up towards his face, his thumb and forefinger make light work of his plush lips as he caresses the chapped skin that the recent cold and windy weather had been responsible for biting away at. You reach into the top drawer of your dresser, pulling out a chapstick.</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; you murmur softly, standing from your spot and heading towards him. You hand him the cosmetic as you lower yourself onto your bed opposite him, cross legged as he takes the product into his larger hands and holds it at each end.</p><p>Swivelling it around within his loose grip, he reads aloud the words printed on the yellow lidded cylindrical object, &ldquo;Nivea, milk and honey,&rdquo; he murmurs. &ldquo;Bit girly, init? Won&rsquo;t do much for my masculinity,&rdquo; he jokes with a small smile, but he removes the lid and applies the balm to his lips regardless.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, nobody&rsquo;s going to kiss you, not with lips like that,&rdquo; you murmur softly as you watch him evenly spread the salve, moisturising his dry skin. </p><p>His brows continue to furrow with his intent focus on the tedious &mdash; yet simplest &mdash; task. </p><p>&ldquo;You know, if you keep frowning like that, you&rsquo;ll be left with worry lines,&rdquo; you tell him, reaching up and delicately caressing his forehead with your soft fingertips. You immediately still at your gesture of close contact. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you breathlessly whisper, hastily removing your hand from his face and grabbing for the closest object within reach &mdash; Mr Bunny &mdash; in an attempt to put a literal barrier between the two of you.</p><p>Harry shakes his head, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologise. I like being touched by you,&rdquo; he murmurs softly. He reflects your posture, straightening his back and sitting upright, crossing his legs. Leaning forwards, he cautiously reaches for the hand you&rsquo;d rapidly withdrawn from him and envelopes it within his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t make it any harder than it already is,&rdquo; you beg in a whimper at his intimate actions and affectionate words that would usually uplift your spirits and put you on cloud nine. Now, his utterances seem like empty promises and that would only threaten to break you down further, weakening the confidence you&rsquo;d merely regained within the last few days.</p><p>It shatters Harry&rsquo;s heart when you pull your fingers out of his hold, instead, averting your attention and caress to Mr Bunny&rsquo;s long, floppy ears, your fingers twiddling with the off-white fluff of the stuffed animal sat securely within your lap.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I buy you this?&rdquo; he asks with a small smile, his voice remarkably composed as he battled internally with the bubbling anger towards himself along with ] the hurt he was experiencing at your apparent rejection of his touch.</p><p>It was a statement as opposed to a question, Harry remembering with clarity the day he entered the Build-a-Bear Workshop in the shopping mall as it fast approached Easter only a year ago. He had chosen the bunny rabbit solitarily, shamelessly stuffing him &mdash; with love, quite literally, as the floor manager handed him a heart shape and requested he press a kiss to it before fitting it within the teddy &mdash; before printing off a birth certificate and choosing a wrist accessory &mdash; an Easter flower bouquet consisting of three coloured roses &mdash; pink, yellow, and purple.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you laugh breathily, as he removes the soft toy from your lap and inspects it. &ldquo;You know, most people buy their friend&rsquo;s Easter eggs that time of year,&rdquo; you smile up at him, meeting his gaze since the first time you&rsquo;d willingly expressed your endearment towards him with the tender touch of your fingertips. </p><p>&lsquo;I did get you an Easter egg,&rdquo; he cockily states with a smirk, simultaneously shrugging his shoulders whilst his hands cordially stroke the ears of the bunny now sat in his lap. &ldquo;A Crunchie one, if I remember correctly,&rdquo; he grins knowingly.</p><p>&ldquo;You did get me a Crunchie one, but you bought me the teddy, too,&rdquo; you state matter of factly, attempting to prove the point of his need to go excessively overboard regarding buying gifts for his loved ones for an array of occasions that he could find any reason to celebrate.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rabbit,&rdquo; he informs you.</p><p>&ldquo;Same thing,&rdquo; you dismiss.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re actually not,&rdquo; he mumbles softly. &ldquo;Anyway, it was the flower bouquet as an accessory that made your smile burst into full bloom,&rdquo; he beams, his boyish grin returning once again as he teases you. &ldquo;You do love your teddies,&rdquo; he notes, as he looks around your childhood bedroom.</p><p>Harry sought great comfort in the ordinary bedroom you possessed throughout your childhood. He had watched both you, and your living environment, mature with time. Your shelves displayed some of your most treasured possessions &mdash; photographs of yourself surrounded by the most important people in your life, and Harry was honoured to be included in the colour transparencies. </p><p>A star sign pot which housed your crystals stood on the same shelf &mdash; Harry couldn&rsquo;t understand your obsession with crystals and if he was honest, he didn&rsquo;t care that Obsidian, Quartz, Jasper and Moonstone possessed qualities inclusive of &mdash; but not limited to &mdash; healing, strength, wisdom, and protection, nor did he know the difference between the stones, but it&rsquo;s clear they serve an importance in your life as he notes that the pot is paired with a book titled, The Little Book of Crystals, which he knows, with little to no doubt, that it is a quirky Urban Outfitters purchase.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Harry suddenly murmurs, and his apologetic tone encourages you to both make eye contact with each other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a total dickhead,&rdquo; he admits, pouting before licking his lips, wetting the dry skin. He looks up, eyes finding the ceiling before he squeezes them shut. &ldquo;We should talk about what happened,&rdquo; his words resonate within your bedroom.</p><p>As he regains his courage and looks back down at you, he&rsquo;s met with your glossy eyes, tears threatening to spill over as the confrontation you dreaded has finally materialised.</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; he whispers softly, his fingertips dancing on your knee as you remain cross legged before him. Your name rolls facilely off of his tongue. &ldquo;You know I hate seeing you cry,&rdquo; he adds with complete integrity. </p><p>Harry places Mr Bunny beside him on the bed before reaching for the box of tissues on the bedside table. He instantly notices the novel, Turtles All the Way Down, accompanied by the turtle ornament he had bought for you following his visit to Jamaica, after having written and produced the first self-titled album. The attention to detail in your bedroom tugged at his heartstrings fractionally more as he realises that there&rsquo;s something so reassuring about the consistency you offer him when he returns home.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; you murmur gratefully through your tears as you reach for a piece of the material. Removing a tissue from the box, you scrunch it into a ball before wiping away the streaky track marks that had stained your red cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;I need you to be honest with me, angel. How long have you felt like this?&rdquo; he asks, gently pushing the topic.</p><p>Taking a deep and shaky breath, you reply with your answer. &ldquo;A while,&rdquo; you whimper as your chest heaves and your body shudders, your breathing become a little more erratic as your sobs increase.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, doll, it&rsquo;s just me,&rdquo; he murmurs softly, raising a hand to your cheek and resting his palm against you. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just me, init,&rdquo; he repeats his comforting statement as you seek reassurance from him, nuzzling your face into him as his thumb skims the salty tears on your skin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Harry,<i> your</i> Harry,&rdquo; he confirms.</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not <i>my</i> Harry,&rdquo; you quiver against his touch at your own words.</p><p>&ldquo;I decide who I do and don&rsquo;t belong to, and right now, I&rsquo;m telling you that I&rsquo;m<i> your</i> Harry,&rdquo; he states simply. &ldquo;Is this about what you said the other night? About me seeing Camille?&rdquo; he asks. His suspicions are confirmed when the unmistakable look of hurt lingers in your eyes, far too long for his liking. &ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; he mutters under his breath, &ldquo;fuck, doll, she&rsquo;s just a friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that before,&rdquo; you tell him, a slight scoff emitting from your lips as you roll your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love her,&rdquo; he tells you firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;H,&rdquo; you sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; his voice is adamant, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love her,&rdquo; he repeats with confidence. </p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you do, Harry, you can&rsquo;t help who you fall for,&rdquo; you assure him.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck &mdash; will you just listen!&rdquo; he exclaims, running a hand frustratedly through his hair as he stands up from his position, pacing the wooden floor of your bedroom, clearly agitated at how the situation before him is playing out. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love Camille because &mdash;&rdquo; he pauses, running a hand over his face, before turning back to you, &ldquo;because I fucking love you!&rdquo; he cries, gesturing towards you.</p><p>A deafening silence, paired with a suddenly uncomfortable atmosphere, surrounds you both, almost as though creating a barrier between the two of you. The howling of a harsh gust of wind rattles the garden fences that segregate yourself from your neighbours, and the rain lashing against at the glass panes of your windows are the only signs of life around you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>in love</i> with <i>you</i>, sweetheart,&rdquo; he murmurs softly, as he resumes his position on the bed opposite you, mirroring your demeanour. &ldquo;Please say something,&rdquo; he practically begs, as he reaches for your hand once more, his thumb skimming your fingers and he breathes a noticeable sigh of relief when you don&rsquo;t flinch at the contact.</p><p>&ldquo;You &mdash; you love me?&rdquo; you ask in disbelief.</p><p>He nods, pulling his bottom lip between his teeth. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he breathes.</p><p>&ldquo;How &mdash; how long?&rdquo; you ask, shocked.</p><p>He curls his hand into a fist, coughing lightly to clear his throat. &ldquo;About two years, roughly,&rdquo; he replies.</p><p>You frown, your brows creasing as you mentally put together the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle you envisage, revisiting two years worth of friendship and trying desperately to discover where along the line his feelings for you had developed further.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, Harry, you must be confused,&rdquo; you mutter softly, shaking your head, almost refusing to believe his declaration of being in love with you. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t &mdash;&rdquo; you begin, &ldquo;&mdash; you can&rsquo;t be in love with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not &mdash;&rdquo; he sighs, angry, feeling defeated as you have difficulty in understanding his feelings towards you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not confused, I just &mdash; I know how I feel!&rdquo; he exclaims, frustratedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in love with you for two years! I was just too self absorbed, focusing on the album to act on anything I felt, and then I had people around me trying to set me up with high profile celebrities &mdash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Models,&rdquo; you clarify, your expression pained.</p><p>He shakes his head, &ldquo;Look, it doesn&rsquo;t matter<i> who</i>, ok,&rdquo; he tells you. </p><p>Pausing, his eyes find the ceiling once more as he contemplates how to express himself, words wrestling with each other as they swim around his mind. He struggles to comprehend vocalising his feelings, before attempting his honesty once more.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it took me this long to tell you,&rdquo; he apologises, opening his eyes to make contact with yours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a coward because I couldn&rsquo;t admit my feelings. I just &mdash; I can&rsquo;t be selfish with you, darling.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Selfish?&rdquo; you question with caution. &ldquo;Harry, you&rsquo;re the least selfish person I know,&rdquo; you assure him.</p><p>&ldquo;Ruining our friendship would have been selfish of me,&rdquo; he shakes his head. &ldquo;Drawing you into a lifestyle like mine would be selfish. I can&rsquo;t drag you into a world &mdash; <i>my world</i>,&rdquo; he closes his hurt filled eyes for a second before continuing, &ldquo; &mdash; of publicity and judgement on everything you do. It chews you up and spits you out, and that&rsquo;s not a life I would promise to <i>anyone</i> I&rsquo;m in a relationship with, especially not you.&rdquo;</p><p>You nod, understanding his impassioned process of thinking.</p><p>&ldquo;Like you, I hoped that these feelings would just go away too &mdash; and when they didn&rsquo;t &mdash;&rdquo; he pauses, his expression guilty as he struggles to maintain eye contact with you before his admission, &ldquo;I wished that you would go away instead. That&rsquo;s why I started ignoring you and for that, I am really sorry,&rdquo; he admits, biting at his bottom lip nervously.</p><p>&ldquo;H &mdash;&rdquo; you begin with a heavy sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Seeing you go on a date,&rdquo; he begins, before clarifying, &ldquo;It felt like someone was stabbing me in the heart twenty times over because I felt like you were moving forwards with your life and I was no longer a part of it,&rdquo; he confesses. &ldquo;I thought maybe my feelings for you had just resurfaced, but in reality, they never left.&rdquo;</p><p>Once again, you nod before clarifying, &ldquo;It was just a date, Harry. Nothing came of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he sighs. &ldquo;But what if you really liked him? What if you were compatible with each other and everything went well? The next time I&rsquo;d hear from you would be in two years when you&rsquo;re getting married &lsquo;nd you&rsquo;re pregnant with his kid or somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he pouts.</p><p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re just being silly,&rdquo; you tut at the sudden change in direction of the conversation, Harry fast forwarding years into your life. &ldquo;Do &mdash; do you really love me?&rdquo; you dare to ask, still having difficulty in comprehending the massive curveball he had thrown tonight.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he breathes. &ldquo;Why is that so hard for you to understand?&rdquo; he asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Because &mdash;&rdquo; you gulp, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m nothing,&rdquo; you shrug. &ldquo;You could have any girl in the world &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m stopping you right there. I don&rsquo;t want to listen to you belittle yourself. It&rsquo;s not necessary, and anything bad you say about yourself isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; he tells you, firmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re &mdash; fuck me, doll, you&rsquo;re perfect,&rdquo; he breathes softly, squeezing your hand reassuringly.</p><p>You twiddle your fingers together, intertwining them in your lap as you chew your bottom lip, struggling with the compliments he&rsquo;s paying you. You always found flattery difficult, unable to believe any sincere praise and admiration anyone has for you. </p><p>&ldquo;It seemed that someone knew how you and I felt,&rdquo; he smirks, before pursing his lips together and his eyes rolling towards the ceiling, a breathy laugh escaping his lips.</p><p>You blush at the revelation, your cheeks reddening as you become flustered in front of the boy you&rsquo;d discussed your feelings with. You had never declared your feelings for Harry to any of his family, nor did you think you&rsquo;d made your adoration for him obvious to anyone. A medley of reasons contributed to your hidden feelings &mdash; inclusive of embarrassment, being knowledgeable enough to realise you&rsquo;re not Harry&rsquo;s usual type, worry of not being good enough, fear of rejection, but most of all, the apprehension of losing a lifelong best friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Robin knew,&rdquo; he clarifies, in an attempt to ease your suddenly obvious anxious state.</p><p>&ldquo;He was a wise man,&rdquo; you tell him softly with a small nod of your head. A small lump forms at the base of your throat. Robin had been a trusting male figure in your life, and talking about Harry&rsquo;s step-father was still a raw and emotional topic for everyone following his battle with cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;He certainly was. If he could see us now, he&rsquo;d probably bang our heads together,&rdquo; he gives you a small smile but with his bottom lip trembling, you know he&rsquo;ll likely reach breaking point within a short space of time. Your hand suddenly becomes the dominant one as you enclose his in your own, giving him a gentle squeeze of his fingers &mdash; a symbolic gesture that you&rsquo;re always here for him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s up there laughing at us,&rdquo; you return the smile, knowing that Robin&rsquo;s sense of humour would be at the forefront of this situation. You raise Harry&rsquo;s hand to your lips, brushing them mindfully across his knuckles.</p><p>Harry scoffs, &ldquo;I promised him I wouldn&rsquo;t fuck up and that I&rsquo;d look after everyone around me. Now look at me, eh? Not even two years on and I&rsquo;ve already broken that promise,&rdquo; he whimpers at his own words. &ldquo;I just seem to be fucking everything up as of late,&rdquo; he trembles, wiping away at the tear that escapes in the hope that you don&rsquo;t notice.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do this to yourself, Harry, please,&rdquo; you beg that he&rsquo;s not harsh on himself at a difficult time. &ldquo;I know I haven&rsquo;t exactly made it easy telling you how I feel,&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;For me and you to ever be in a relationship &mdash; the complexity of it,&rdquo; you stutter, unsure of how to approach the subject, &ldquo;It just can&rsquo;t happen for us. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair on you. You want to travel the world, make music and tour. Me? I&rsquo;m just plain and simple and boring &mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not &mdash;&rdquo; Harry attempts to cut you off but the threatening stare he receives from you as a warning &mdash; albeit jokingly &mdash; is enough to scold him for interrupting you.</p><p>&ldquo;I just want to settle down. I&rsquo;m ready for my life to move forwards,&rdquo; you tell him with integrity.</p><p>&ldquo;Christ, you sound like Gemma,&rdquo; he jokes, although he&rsquo;s had the immediate realisation of just how mature the young women in his life are actually becoming. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kidding,&rdquo; he smirks, and you&rsquo;re only too appreciative that Harry &mdash; despite his glossy red rimmed eyes &mdash; seems to have regained a sense of humour and happiness. He sighs heavily before leaning forwards, resting his forehead against your own and resting his free hand on your knee, caressing your skin. </p><p>Butterflies flutter in your tummy at the close contact, your hot breaths fanning over each other&rsquo;s faces. Anxiousness is at the forefront of your emotions, and you can&rsquo;t help but feel a little disquieted as you consider the possibility that Harry will get your hopes up, only for you to be let down again by the same boy who appears before you. </p><p>The concept makes the metaphorical insects within you plummet to the pits of your stomach, the constant ache inside of you bubbling away and overpowering your sentiment. You&rsquo;re not sure you could overcome rejection if it arose after the day&rsquo;s intimacy between the two of you, the idea alone soul destroying.</p><p>You moisten your lips with your tongue, before quivering underneath his clement touch. &ldquo;Harry, I can&rsquo;t &mdash;&rdquo; you mutter softly, closing your eyes. You quickly swing your legs over the edge of the bed, pulling your hand away from his before standing from the spot you had been sat and pacing into the centre of your bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t what, eh?&rdquo; he asks gently, his voice encouraging as he follows suit, close behind your frame. His eyes, filled with sympathy and empathy, watch you diligently from behind, as you fold your arms protectively across your chest. &ldquo;What can&rsquo;t ya do, darling?&rdquo; his thick accent resounds once more.</p><p>Your body instinctively twitches the moment his hand makes contact with your waist from behind you, his fingertips gently dancing on your hip. Despite the small flinch, you don&rsquo;t move away from Harry, and instead, you welcome his affectionate touch. You stare down at your naked feet &mdash; your nails painted a baby pink shade from the BarryM Under the Sea collection &mdash; twiddling the soft circular rug, which lies beneath your skin, between your toes. Composing yourself, you turn around to face the taller boy, his bottom lip pulled between his teeth as he looks down at you.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you whisper softly.</p><p>Brushing a strand of hair away from your hair, he shakes his head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologise. We&rsquo;re both feeling pretty defensive right now, a lot&rsquo;s happened,&rdquo; he states. A momentary silence fills the tiny gap between you, before he finally plucks up the courage to express his desires. &ldquo;I want to try something, darling,&rdquo; he begins, a little hesitantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try,&rdquo; he repeats, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo;</p><p>You nod, your body anticipating the next move the moment Harry&rsquo;s right hand makes contact with your jawline, his palm cupping your face as his thumb skims your cheekbone, his soothing gesture hoping that you&rsquo;ll relax in his embrace. </p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;s just me yeah?&rdquo; he reminds you softly, yearning to rid you of any apprehension in the potentially awkward encounter. &ldquo;<i>Your</i> Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s the first to lean in towards you, eyelids fluttering closed as his plush lips make contact with your trembling ones. Encouraging you closer towards him, he places his left hand on the small of your back and pulls your frame tentatively towards him, not forcing you into anything you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable with. </p><p>It&rsquo;s your next action that&rsquo;s the proof he needs. Your once clammy hands make contact with Harry, one snaking around the back of his neck as your thumb finds the sensitive spot behind his ear, making light work behind it as you stroke it gently. The other finds itself fisting through his hair, gently tugging at the curls at the nape of his neck. With a gentle tug of his locks, he moans into you, and he wonders how on earth he was able to deprive himself of this heaven for such a long time.</p><p>It&rsquo;s your turn to vocalise your gratification with a soft groan into his mouth as his hands caress your skin, passion ignited within you both. His lips form a narcissistic smile against yours as he realises that he&rsquo;s working you up. You feel giddy, like an inexperienced teenager having her seven minutes in heaven with her crush.</p><p>But you&rsquo;re with Harry, and his delicate touch and passionate kiss reminds you that whilst he&rsquo;ll lead you into this, you&rsquo;re the one in control of the situation, and you&rsquo;re always safe with him. Your lips greedily steal more kisses from him, his seemingly readily available for you. Each one becomes deeper as your tongues attempt to dominate each other&rsquo;s.</p><p>The sweet taste of him lingers on your tongue, along with a hint of saltiness &mdash; a mixture of both of your tears &mdash; as his hot breath fans over you throughout the affectionate embrace. A moan leaves his mouth in disappointment when you pull away breathlessly, your glossy eyes gazing up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to do that more often,&rdquo; he pulls his face away and smiles down at you, not once losing body contact as his thumb continues to skim your cheek. &ldquo;Only if you want me to,&rdquo; he continues.</p><p>Your giggly reply is the only confirmation he needs, &ldquo;I always want you to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That means you lied to me,&rdquo; he smirks.</p><p>You reply with a frown, your lips pouting as you display your confusion at his comment, whilst your fingertips continuously stroke the nape of his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;You said nobody would kiss me with lips like these,&rdquo; he leans towards you and murmurs tauntingly close against your mouth, his lips dancing above your own once again.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up and kiss me, H,&rdquo; you whimper, hungrily stealing another kiss from him.</p><p>&ldquo;Love you,&rdquo; he murmurs breathlessly between kisses. &ldquo;Love you &mdash; I love you, I love you,&rdquo; he repeats.</p><p>With his pants becoming breathier, you fight the internal battle of wanting him to tell you how much you mean to him, and needing the actions to follow up with his sincerity, and instead you settle on your audacious remark, begging him, &ldquo;So show me you love me, then.&rdquo;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Hey everyone! This was one of my requests from the <a href=\"http://drunkirkharry.tumblr.com/post/184207101982/200-dialogue-prompts\" target=\"_blank\">list of prompts</a> I reblogged earlier this week. It was supposed to be a prompt but this has actually turned into an 8K bestfriend!harry one shot,&nbsp; based on the angsty,<b> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember why I ever loved you.&rdquo;</b>&nbsp;Hopefully it&rsquo;s enough angst but you know I can&rsquo;t make Harry a <i>complete</i> dickhead! So we also feature fluff &mdash; like Easter chicks and bunnies, because it&rsquo;s that time of year again!</p>\n<p><b>Please remember that feedback is always welcomed!</b></p>\n<p>Also, Happy Easter to anyone celebrating &mdash; and if you&rsquo;re not celebrating, then I hope you have a lovely weekend, however you plan to spend it &mdash; and enjoy the chocolate eggs because you know, chocolate!</p>\n<p><b>Cookie Monsters and Easter Bunnies.</b></p>\n<p>&ldquo;What the hell was that all about?&rdquo; you ask incredulously, your burgundy Vans thundering heavily underneath your running legs and against the concrete as you chase after Harry into the car park of The Old Red Lion. </p>\n<p>Visiting Harry and his family in Holmes Chapel had been a tradition for as long as you could remember when it came to birthdays, and Anne&rsquo;s birthday this year had been no different. With a table booked at the local Ember Inns - an authentic pub which prides itself in serving traditional British classics, affordable wines and ales, along with it&rsquo;s roaring log fires which welcome guests into the homely environment - a small gathering of family and close friends of Anne&rsquo;s had been invited to join the birthday celebrations.</p>\n<p>You had arrived in Harry&rsquo;s childhood hometown a few hours prior to the event to spend some quality time with your best friend and his family. Yet, you couldn&rsquo;t fathom how he had behaved so unpredictably towards you throughout the course of the evening.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Harry, will you at least have the decency to look at me when I&rsquo;m talking to you!&rdquo; your voice suddenly booms into the night air as you follow closely behind the large male figure. </p>\n<p>His footsteps instantly ease the moment you shout at him, his ears pricking up at your warning tone and his body immediately halting. Harry had never known you to shout - not at him, at least - within your years of close friendship. Slowly turning on his heel, he meets your gaze, only to be met with your teary eyes and a silence filling the space between you both.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he eventually asks, licking his lips.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo; you ask breathlessly, your chest heaving slightly as you shudder.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to say?&rdquo; he asks, nonchalantly, shrugging his shoulders. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve barely spoken to me all night, H,&rdquo; you tell him, sadly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I asked you how you are, I asked how work is for ya,&rdquo; he begins, pouting his bottom lip and scuffing his shoes against the concrete of the car park that you&rsquo;re undoubtedly about to have a disagreement in &mdash; because based on his attitude towards you, and you lacking the knowledge of why the sudden change in his behaviour, it&rsquo;s inevitable that at least one of you is going to be left heartbroken tonight.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, and that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve said,&rdquo; you whisper. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t spoken to me in weeks, Harry. You came back to London for a few weeks before disappearing off the face of the earth again-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I went to LA,&rdquo; he clarifies gently.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&mdash; and you never bothered to message me?&rdquo; you ask, pulling the sleeves of your cardigan down over your thumbs before wrapping it around your shivering frame &mdash; you&rsquo;re not sure if it&rsquo;s a defence mechanism or if you are genuinely cold.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My life doesn&rsquo;t revolve around you!&rdquo; he half yells. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; you gulp, swallowing the lump in your throat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Then why are you acting as if me not contacting you is a big deal?&rdquo; he asks, running his hands through his hair, tugging at the curls at the nape of his neck in frustration at how, unintentionally, disastrous the evening has played out.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t even just about you not contacting me. You&rsquo;ve been so flaky with me tonight and I don&rsquo;t even know why! You&rsquo;re my best friend, Harry, and you can barely string together two words and talk to me. I didn&rsquo;t even hear it from <i>you</i> that you were back in London a few weeks ago,&rdquo; you cry.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was busy,&rdquo; he sighs, excusing his recent lack of communication.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So I saw,&rdquo; you tell him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What the hell is that supposed to mean?&rdquo; he scoffs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re busy, H,&rdquo; you begin, nodding your head in understanding at his situation regarding his fame, &ldquo;but seeing the media posting pictures and articles of you meeting up with people, it&rsquo;s hard. You mean to tell me that you couldn&rsquo;t at least spare five minutes of your time to drop me a text to tell me you were home? You mean you were too busy to come and see me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Since arriving back home to London, Harry had been sighted in North London pubs with a string of high profile celebrities, including the CEO of Sony. You were none the wiser as to whether these well-known males in the public eye were just friends of Harry&rsquo;s, or if they were involved in helping him achieve success with his upcoming album.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just like you couldn&rsquo;t spare five minutes of <i>your</i> time to drop me a text and tell me you were going on a date?&rdquo; he attempts to bite back, but his voice fails him as the harsh tone he strives for refuses to deliver. Instead, you&rsquo;re met with his soft timbre, yet the hurt within his expression is enough to resonate into the autumn air. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;That &mdash;&rdquo; you begin, struggling to form your words. The statement had caught you off guard, leaving you baffled. &ldquo;This is what all of this has been about? You&rsquo;re pissed off at me because I didn&rsquo;t tell you I was going on a date?&rdquo; you ask, the crease on your forehead becoming more prominent as you struggle to comprehend Harry&rsquo;s emotions. &ldquo;I would have told you in person, you know, when you were back in London, when I thought we&rsquo;d <i>actually</i> see each other. Besides, there was nothing to tell &mdash;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Harry&rsquo;s quick to cut you off with a scoff and raised eyebrows. &ldquo;Nothing to tell? Why are being so self-righteous? If I have to tell you everything that&rsquo;s going on in my life, then surely you should be telling me everything you&rsquo;re getting up to in yours?&rdquo; he counter argues. &ldquo;But instead, I find out through fans on Twitter that my best friend is hooking up with some random guy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You shrug your shoulders at his words, realising that perhaps he has a point. Whilst you find it devastating that you only know about Harry&rsquo;s movements via social media, you hadn&rsquo;t considered that maybe Harry feels equally as hurt when you don&rsquo;t openly discuss things with him either. He&rsquo;s your best friend, after all.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d have more important things to worry about,&rdquo; you murmur softly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; he asks, awaiting your next answer.</p>\n<p>Lowering your gaze to the ground, you gently chew your bottom lip, unsure of how to express yourself. Inhaling a deep breath, you continue, &ldquo;Camille,&rdquo; and your eyes squeeze shut at the sound of her name bitterly leaving your lips.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re jealous,&rdquo; he states. It wasn&rsquo;t a question and you both knew it.</p>\n<p>You quickly shake your head, your heart thumping against your chest. &ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo; The unwelcome taste of salt suddenly lingers on your lips and you know that the tears that had been threatening to spill over during your confrontation had done so. You only hoped Harry wouldn&rsquo;t notice as you bring your hand up to rid your cheeks of the track marks they most likely left. &ldquo;Why are you so bothered anyway? Why do you care who I&rsquo;m dating?&rdquo; you quickly attempt to change the topic of conversation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bothered,&rdquo; he sneers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a shit who you&rsquo;re fucking each week.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You struggle to decipher what is being communicated, his words stabbing at your heart as he cheapens your experiences &mdash; or rather lack of &mdash; with the opposite gender. Unable to prevent your bottom lip from trembling, you let out a small sob at your best friend&rsquo;s unrelenting words.</p>\n<p>With glossy eyes and a shaky breath, you endeavour to maintain at least some dignity you may have within yourself as the conflict between the two of you persists. &ldquo;What, are<i> you</i> jealous?&rdquo; you bite back.</p>\n<p>His disparaging smile speaks louder than words, but the remark that follows is one that resounds, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself.&rdquo; He spits his words venomously, cruelty expressed in his stance as he narrows his eyes at you.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; you sob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been there for you through everything, Harry! And this is how you repay me?&rdquo; you cry. Disregarding the constant flow of tears from your red, blotchy cheeks with the back of your hand, you sigh heavily before taking a deep breath and continuing, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so hard without you being around the past few months, and I was really looking forward to seeing you tonight and spending time together. But now? <b>I can&rsquo;t remember why I ever loved you</b>,&rdquo; you whimper.</p>\n</p>",

I wrote a lil sumn sumn and decided to share. I\u2019m hoping to actually follow thru on this story as I\u2019m feeling pretty inspired so fingers crossed it doesn\u2019t float away. Anyway, if you decide to read I hope you enjoy! It\u2019s 3.2k words and chapter numero uno of a kind of&hellip;supernatural&hellip;harry fic I\u2019m starting. (Let\u2019s hope this copies correctly and the format isn\u2019t fucked up)<strike>(omg it\u2019s so fucked up)</strike></i></b></p><p>Summer arrived in full force that year, sweeping into Ferris Point on an oppressive heatwave that made your whole body sweat just by looking out the window and into the harsh sunlight splintering through the still, humid air. The only refuge Lila had was her dingy apartment, if you could even call it that. The converted attic of an old rickety church was advertised as a \u201cstudio apartment\u201d and it was two rooms scarcely bigger than a shoebox. She guesses she shouldn\u2019t complain as it <i>was</i> a roof over her head&hellip;no matter how often that roof leaked. And hey. It was dirt cheap.</p><p>Lila\u2019s humble abode includes a small kitchen area and three pretty big circular windows all intricately stained glass and one square window that\u2019s not. A full-size mattress resides on the floor next to a mug of lukewarm lemonade on top of a stack of books from the very minuscule town library, and a lamp <i>behind</i> the stack of books that looks suspiciously like the lamps at said library. A large and impressive peace lily sits treasured in one corner and a somewhat dusty dresser adorned with a plethora of trinkets and things in the other corner. </p><p>And of course; the air conditioner.</p><p>Lila\u2019s beautiful and most prized possession during these hot, hot summer months in the state of New York. She found it off on the side of the road in May along with a small table balancing precipitously on three good legs and a loveseat with a multitude of mysterious stains on the seat cushion, back cushion <i>and</i> armrests. They sat behind a cardboard sign scrawled with one glorious, godsent word. <i>Free</i>. So Lila, only equipped with her dear and trusty bicycle, Lorraine, looked at her wicker basket nestled between the handlebars and back to the shining air conditioner beaming in the high afternoon sun. She then made a very important decision before her mile trek back to the run down church. </p><p>She clicked her tongue and heaved the air conditioner into her tan arms and staggered all the way home, leaving poor Lorraine to fend for herself before she came back for her at sundown and rode all the way home with a smile on her face. Lila had no reason to believe that this beautiful object, circa the late 70\u2019s from the looks of it, would actually work. But the stiflingly hot nights that were already happening at the tail end of just <i>spring</i> was something she didn\u2019t even want to entertain anymore. She <i>needed</i> this to work. And work it did. For two months.</p><p>On July 14th, the warmest day thus far, reaching 115 degrees, it had ceased to function. Her teeny tiny home was no longer a refuge from the heat but rather a prison to it. The heat rose so quickly and relentlessly through the top floor of the church that Lila barely had time to collect her things before going outside to seek some shade under a cool canopy of trees and hopefully not keel over from heatstroke. </p><p>With her bag on her back and the soles of her shoes melting on the gravel driveway, Lila set off into the mouth of the woods near her house. Every time she walked into the forest she found herself increasingly more comfortable navigating its slopes and turns. The forest was a safe place for her now.</p><p>One early afternoon in April when she found herself relieved of her desk duty at the local library two hours before her shift was to end, she looked out her clear square window into the budding willow trees. They seemed to open their arms to her, inviting her in.</p><p>Growing up, Lila would have to be dragged inside by her feet, kicking and screaming and throwing mud and clumps of grass at her mother who did most of the dragging. She would play outside in the sun until her skin was peeling and rolling around in the snow until her fingers were blue. The comfort and curiosity she felt amongst the wide open world of the outdoors was unparalleled and played a key role of who she was today.</p><p>That early afternoon in April when her shadow was only a sliver of her being, she wandered into the yawning forest. The bugs and little creatures were just coming out to bask in the moderate spring temperatures, waking up from their winter sleep and rubbing the crust out of their eyes. Snowdrop flowers littered the ground and patches of sunlight bounced off the damp tree trunks and onto the forest floor, not unlike the way water from a swimming pool looks, illuminated from its depths. </p><p>On her walk, she was careful not to get lost. There wasn\u2019t really a distinct trail to follow as not many people from her small town ventured into the decently sized forest. She mentally marked trees and formations of rocks that stood out along the way, tripping over the majority of them. Before long, she stumbled upon a small clearing with long tendrils of deadened grass coming back to life and a steep drop off into a body of water. The small spring looked like it had just recently started moving again after winters ice with the water clogged with globs of grass and silt that rose to the top to make a murky appearance. </p><p>Lila, however, was in awe. The natural spring was relatively untouched and it seemed worlds away from her dingy church and monotonous job that didn\u2019t pay nearly enough for a liveable wage. Her worries about rent and groceries floated away and disappeared into the sunbeams shining down on the water. The sweat on the back of her neck trickled down through her shirt as Lila worked to discard her sneakers and take off her clothes. She carefully made her way down short cliff on a small kind of natural stairway made of boulders and stood before the slow moving water.</p><p>Lila dipped her foot in the pleasantly warm water and swirled the silt around. She waded further out, cautious of sharp shale and any living critters, and found that the spring only really got about 6 feet deep at the center. She could touch the bottom if she submerged herself a few inches and popped back up to the surface, smiling wide. Lila spent the whole day soaking up the sun&rsquo;s rays like a lazy fat cat. She indulged in her own little accomplishment at finding a place so serene right before the thick of summer and fantasized about all the days she\u2019d spend here. </p><p>Or so she thought. </p><p>With the heat wave and blue skies came a small drought. Nothing detrimental, just a few weeks where the dark, rich soil turned to dust and flowers began to scorch in the wretched path of the sun. It made everything ugly and surrounded by an orange hue. The trees even seemed defeated by gravity, panting like a dog and drooping towards the ground in hopes of extending their roots further to find any drop of water hiding in the earth. </p><p>This also meant that Lila\u2019s dear spring had completely evaporated from the last time she visited, just yesterday. Given, the water was a bit low then, only coming up to her chest. But she didn\u2019t think it could happen so fast. </p><p>As she walks under the shade of the forest in the pathway of trampled grass she drew out herself, she comes out the other side to the clearing full of wildflowers and sharp miscanthus grass. Lila peers over the cliff, expecting to see the sparkling gleam from the reflection of the water but discovering only a pit of rust colored dust gazing back at her. </p><p>There\u2019s a strange haze that settles over her mind suddenly and she can\u2019t seem to remember the last time she visited the spring, even though it was certainly less than 24 hours ago. There\u2019s no way a body of water this big could disappear overnight. Lila shakes her head and chalks her confusion up to dehydration. She hasn\u2019t been drinking nearly enough water as she should.</p><p>Heaving a deep sigh and wiping an exasperated hand down her face, Lila stands there for a couple of minutes feeling mildly defeated. She turns on her heel, accidentally kicking up an <i>grotesque</i> amount of dust that sticks to the <i>obscene</i> amount of moisture on her.</p><p>Coming out from beneath the lovely shade of willows and oaks, Lila walks straight past her church-home-hell and continues on the uneven gravel towards the heart of Ferris Point. </p><p>Ferris Point, population 1,559, is a small town in upstate New York. It consists of two gas stations, one movie theater, four competing bars, a handful of overflowing consignment shops and a 24 hour diner called Sandy\u2019s Gateway Getaway but everybody calls it Sandy\u2019s, for short. Sandy\u2019s dabbles in a bit of everything, from inventive food specials of the day to questionable live \u201centertainment\u201d to the ever-changing paint on its walls. </p><p>The owner, Beau, a bit of an eccentric, stout old man in his 60\u2019s with an almost full head of hair and a matching full face of beard, inherited the diner when his father passed. Sandy\u2019s is named after Beau\u2019s late mother and stays as lively and indecisive as she was. Beau has a habit of painting the diners walls to whatever color suits his mood that month, and when he paints it\u2019s the only time Sandy\u2019s is closed. </p><p>This month, the walls are a light lilac color and a beautiful respite to the burning orange haze that\u2019s covered the town. Lila heaves a sigh and this time it\u2019s in relief as a blast of ice cold air envelops her body. The diner is relatively empty and she walks towards the first booth in front of the wall of windows to the left, taking it all for herself. </p><p>She dumps her bag on the glossy enamel surface of the table, accidentally knocking over the ketchup bottle and cursing under her breath as a few books coming flying out of the broken zipper. A group of elderly women sitting at a table in the corner shoot her somewhat of an annoyed glance as Lila interrupts their riveting book club discussion about whether or not Ms. Bennett really deserved Mr. Darcy\u2019s undivided love and attention. She smiles sheepishly and ducks her head to look at the contents of her bag for her copy of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. She\u2019s been on a reread of the series, her fifth one, and she never fails to get those gleeful goosebumps.</p><p>Beau, wiping down the long oval bar that takes up the entire back wall of the diner, looks at Lila and smiles.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I getcha today, Ms. Lila? The usual?\u201d </p><p>Lila nods and grins while Beau shouts her order out to the cook. Two pancakes with warm blueberry jam and syrup, a side of scrambled eggs and a cup of orange juice, with the pulp.</p><p>\u201cYes, and can I get your biggest glass of water? If you have a very big bucket then that\u2019s fine too. Fill her up,\u201d she says with a wink. </p><p>Beau shakes his head. \u201cIs it still a fire hazard out there? I don\u2019t even want to step outside to drive home. I think my engine might blow up just by going a few blocks over,\u201d he chuckles. </p><p>\u201cYes sir,\u201d Lila says. \u201cAnd your car might just combust. My air conditioner finally kicked the bucket so I\u2019m thinking of catching a bus into Harrisburg to find a cheap fan at the Walmart or something.\u201d</p><p>Beau purses his lips, an action barely noticeable through the nest of grey hair surrounding his mouth. He makes a funny squelching noise behind his teeth and begins to talk.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cI think I might have somethin\u2019 in the back for ya. It\u2019s been there since the dawn of time practically. You\u2019re gonna have to clean the dust offa it if by some miracle it works.\u201d</p><p>Lila perks up and nods enthusiastically. \u201cWhat is it? Is it a fan? An air conditioner? Please say air conditioner, Beau, <i>please</i>. I think I might suffocate in my sleep because of this humidity,\u201d she groans out. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big industrial fan,\u201d Beau says with a chuckle. \u201cIf it turns on, you can call it yours. If you need me to, I can drop it off at your house when I leave. I take it you\u2019re gonna stay here for a while?\u201d he says, raising his eyebrows and pointedly looking at her already cozy set up. Her book is open face up in front of her and her feet are propped up on the cushion in front of her. Her phone is plugged into an outlet hiding just underneath the table behind the napkin dispenser and her bag has been turned into a makeshift armrest. </p><p>Lila laughs, a quick light sound, and she can feel the sweat already cooling her neck as she nods. She\u2019s never felt comfier. She could sleep here, she thinks.</p><p>\u201cThank you <i>so</i> much Beau. How much do you want for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d the owner says, waving away her question. \u201cIt only collects dust back there anyway. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least let me pay you for bringing it to my house. But please don\u2019t try bringing it up to my hallway. No offense, but you might break your back. I fear for the safety of my spine just carrying my groceries up those flights of stairs. It\u2019s ridiculously steep so leave that to me,\u201d Lila says with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d he laughs. He walks through the swinging doors to the back to plug the fan in. He walks back out and gives a quick thumbs up signaling that it works. Lila tilts her head back onto the plush seat, smiling, and closes her eyes. It\u2019s something, she thinks. She thanks her lucky stars and hears someone make a shushing sound and the volume on the TV increase. The screen shows a weatherman standing in front of a map of the region and gesturing to the temperatures at each city on the map, reporting on this next weeks forecast. </p><p>\u201cWell, folks, it looks like there\u2019s no break in this heatwave anytime soon,\u201d the man says with a click of his tongue. He points to the dot on the map saying Ferris Point as well as Harrisburg and Troy and all the towns around it. </p><p>\u201cIt seems this region in particular has been hit the worst with temperatures rising up to almost 120 degrees and with little refuge during the night as it drops down to 92 with the humidity at 81 percent. This week&rsquo;s forecast stays at a steady 110 degrees and above with little temperature fluctuation. Mostly sunny with little chance of rain until next Friday where hopefully, fingers crossed, a mean looking storm cloud heading in from the Midwest will break the wave and end the drought. This has been your local weather forecast with Bob Kadinsky, thank you for tuning in.\u201d</p><p>The old-lady-book-club in the corner all visibly deflate at once while slowly fanning themselves with their paperbacks of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. As does Lila. She\u2019s sick of the heat and sick of constantly being in a near dehydrated state for the past week. </p><p>Lila slumps back into her seat, diving into the greatest literary creation of all time, until her food is brought out. She practically inhales the warm and fluffy pancakes and is pretty sure she beat some kind of record for taking the fastest drink of water ever. She asks for a second mason jar of the icy cold goodness and gets comfortable again. </p><p>An hour in the women have left and the only people in the diner are Lila, the cook and one waitress typing something into the register with one hand on her hip. Beau left some ten or so minutes ago reminding Lila about the fan.</p><p>The sun is setting and a reddish glow enters the room, washing over the checkerboard tile and the vibrancy catches the fresh lilac paint on fire, it seems. </p><p>Just then, the bell above the front door calls out, signaling a new arrival. Lila pays no attention, mindlessly shrinking away from the hot air blowing into the back of her hair, entirely engrossed in the world of Harry Potter. She registers the sound of heavy footsteps that kind of drag across the ground walk up to the register and the sound of a throat being cleared.  </p><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d a male voice begins, deep and raspy and <i>slow</i>, like smoke curling up. \u201cWas wondering if you could point me in the direction of the nearest store. I left my phone at home and the roads get a bit confusing here,\u201d he says with a slight laugh. </p><p>\u201cNo problem sweetie. Turn left on Clark and Mallow, another left at the stop sign on Broad Street and continue onto Route 9 for about 5 miles. There\u2019s a Walmart in Harrisburg, it\u2019s the biggest building there, ya can\u2019t miss it,\u201d the waitress says with a steady click of her nails on the screen in front of her. </p><p>\u201cThank you ma\u2019am, you\u2019re a lifesaver,\u201d the voice says, audibly relieved. Lila looks up just as he turns around and meets his eye. She\u2019s never seen him before, which is strange, because everyone here knows everyone else here.</p><p>He\u2019s about Lila\u2019s age, if not a bit older, with dirt brown hair curling around his face and glowing red in the sunset, a couple strands around his ears wet with sweat. He\u2019s got a bit of a flushed complexion and a permanent furrow to his nicely shaped brow that creates an indent just above the bridge of his nose, which is a bit of a pointy thing, but not overly. She\u2019s almost jealous of how deep his Cupid\u2019s bow is and how pink his lips are. <i>Does he have lipstick on? </i>she wonders for a split second. She can\u2019t make out the color of his eyes behind his glasses but she can see the fiery sunset behind her in their reflection. It looks like the apocalypse has already happened in his eyes. He reaches up to push back a damp curl and an assortment of rings glint in the light. </p><p>He smiles at her with closed lips and nods as a brief greeting before walking out into the offensive air, the bell above the door yelling at him to keep the heat out. Lila stares at his figure retreating into a small, old looking car but kept in a clean condition. He looks a little funny, folding his legs up and crouching down into his seat. She watches his silhouette flip the visor down and pull out of the parking lot, going the complete wrong way the lady at the register told him. </p><p>She scoffs and turns back to the words illuminated on blood red pages. As the light dies down and dips below the horizon, setting the moon on fire, Lila finds herself stuck in the back of her mind, replaying the image of this man she\u2019s never seen before, walking straight into the sun. </p>",

The diner is relatively empty and she walks towards the first booth in front of the wall of windows to the left, taking it all for herself. </p><p>She dumps her bag on the glossy enamel surface of the table, accidentally knocking over the ketchup bottle and cursing under her breath as a few books coming flying out of the broken zipper. A group of elderly women sitting at a table in the corner shoot her somewhat of an annoyed glance as Lila interrupts their riveting book club discussion about whether or not Ms. Bennett really deserved Mr. Darcy\u2019s undivided love and attention. She smiles sheepishly and ducks her head to look at the contents of her bag for her copy of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. She\u2019s been on a reread of the series, her fifth one, and she never fails to get those gleeful goosebumps.</p><p>Beau, wiping down the long oval bar that takes up the entire back wall of the diner, looks at Lila and smiles.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I getcha today, Ms. Lila? The usual?\u201d </p><p>Lila nods and grins while Beau shouts her order out to the cook. Two pancakes with warm blueberry jam and syrup, a side of scrambled eggs and a cup of orange juice, with the pulp.</p><p>\u201cYes, and can I get your biggest glass of water? If you have a very big bucket then that\u2019s fine too. Fill her up,\u201d she says with a wink. </p><p>Beau shakes his head. \u201cIs it still a fire hazard out there? I don\u2019t even want to step outside to drive home. I think my engine might blow up just by going a few blocks over,\u201d he chuckles. </p><p>\u201cYes sir,\u201d Lila says. \u201cAnd your car might just combust. My air conditioner finally kicked the bucket so I\u2019m thinking of catching a bus into Harrisburg to find a cheap fan at the Walmart or something.\u201d</p><p>Beau purses his lips, an action barely noticeable through the nest of grey hair surrounding his mouth. He makes a funny squelching noise behind his teeth and begins to talk.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cI think I might have somethin\u2019 in the back for ya. It\u2019s been there since the dawn of time practically. You\u2019re gonna have to clean the dust offa it if by some miracle it works.\u201d</p><p>Lila perks up and nods enthusiastically. \u201cWhat is it? Is it a fan? An air conditioner? Please say air conditioner, Beau, <i>please</i>. I think I might suffocate in my sleep because of this humidity,\u201d she groans out. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big industrial fan,\u201d Beau says with a chuckle. \u201cIf it turns on, you can call it yours. If you need me to, I can drop it off at your house when I leave. I take it you\u2019re gonna stay here for a while?\u201d he says, raising his eyebrows and pointedly looking at her already cozy set up. Her book is open face up in front of her and her feet are propped up on the cushion in front of her. Her phone is plugged into an outlet hiding just underneath the table behind the napkin dispenser and her bag has been turned into a makeshift armrest. </p><p>Lila laughs, a quick light sound, and she can feel the sweat already cooling her neck as she nods. She\u2019s never felt comfier. She could sleep here, she thinks.</p><p>\u201cThank you <i>so</i> much Beau. How much do you want for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d the owner says, waving away her question. \u201cIt only collects dust back there anyway. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least let me pay you for bringing it to my house. But please don\u2019t try bringing it up to my hallway. No offense, but you might break your back. I fear for the safety of my spine just carrying my groceries up those flights of stairs. It\u2019s ridiculously steep so leave that to me,\u201d Lila says with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d he laughs. He walks through the swinging doors to the back to plug the fan in. He walks back out and gives a quick thumbs up signaling that it works. Lila tilts her head back onto the plush seat, smiling, and closes her eyes. It\u2019s something, she thinks. She thanks her lucky stars and hears someone make a shushing sound and the volume on the TV increase. The screen shows a weatherman standing in front of a map of the region and gesturing to the temperatures at each city on the map, reporting on this next weeks forecast. </p><p>\u201cWell, folks, it looks like there\u2019s no break in this heatwave anytime soon,\u201d the man says with a click of his tongue. He points to the dot on the map saying Ferris Point as well as Harrisburg and Troy and all the towns around it. </p><p>\u201cIt seems this region in particular has been hit the worst with temperatures rising up to almost 120 degrees and with little refuge during the night as it drops down to 92 with the humidity at 81 percent. This week\u2019s forecast stays at a steady 110 degrees and above with little temperature fluctuation. Mostly sunny with little chance of rain until next Friday where hopefully, fingers crossed, a mean looking storm cloud heading in from the Midwest will break the wave and end the drought. This has been your local weather forecast with Bob Kadinsky, thank you for tuning in.\u201d</p><p>The old-lady-book-club in the corner all visibly deflate at once while slowly fanning themselves with their paperbacks of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. As does Lila. She\u2019s sick of the heat and sick of constantly being in a near dehydrated state for the past week. </p><p>Lila slumps back into her seat, diving into the greatest literary creation of all time, until her food is brought out. She practically inhales the warm and fluffy pancakes and is pretty sure she beat some kind of record for taking the fastest drink of water ever. She asks for a second mason jar of the icy cold goodness and gets comfortable again. </p><p>An hour in the women have left and the only people in the diner are Lila, the cook and one waitress typing something into the register with one hand on her hip. Beau left some ten or so minutes ago reminding Lila about the fan.</p><p>The sun is setting and a reddish glow enters the room, washing over the checkerboard tile and the vibrancy catches the fresh lilac paint on fire, it seems. </p><p>Just then, the bell above the front door calls out, signaling a new arrival. Lila pays no attention, mindlessly shrinking away from the hot air blowing into the back of her hair, entirely engrossed in the world of Harry Potter. She registers the sound of heavy footsteps that kind of drag across the ground walk up to the register and the sound of a throat being cleared.  </p><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d a male voice begins, deep and raspy and <i>slow</i>, like smoke curling up. \u201cWas wondering if you could point me in the direction of the nearest store. I left my phone at home and the roads get a bit confusing here,\u201d he says with a slight laugh. </p><p>\u201cNo problem sweetie. Turn left on Clark and Mallow, another left at the stop sign on Broad Street and continue onto Route 9 for about 5 miles. There\u2019s a Walmart in Harrisburg, it\u2019s the biggest building there, ya can\u2019t miss it,\u201d the waitress says with a steady click of her nails on the screen in front of her. </p><p>\u201cThank you ma\u2019am, you\u2019re a lifesaver,\u201d the voice says, audibly relieved. Lila looks up just as he turns around and meets his eye. She\u2019s never seen him before, which is strange, because everyone here knows everyone else here.</p><p>He\u2019s about Lila\u2019s age, if not a bit older, with dirt brown hair curling around his face and glowing red in the sunset, a couple strands around his ears wet with sweat. He\u2019s got a bit of a flushed complexion and a permanent furrow to his nicely shaped brow that creates an indent just above the bridge of his nose, which is a bit of a pointy thing, but not overly. She\u2019s almost jealous of how deep his Cupid\u2019s bow is and how pink his lips are. <i>Does he have lipstick on? </i>she wonders for a split second. She can\u2019t make out the color of his eyes behind his glasses but she can see the fiery sunset behind her in their reflection. It looks like the apocalypse has already happened in his eyes. He reaches up to push back a damp curl and an assortment of rings glint in the light. </p><p>He smiles at her with closed lips and nods as a brief greeting before walking out into the offensive air, the bell above the door yelling at him to keep the heat out. Lila stares at his figure retreating into a small, old looking car but kept in a clean condition. He looks a little funny, folding his legs up and crouching down into his seat. She watches his silhouette flip the visor down and pull out of the parking lot, going the complete wrong way the lady at the register told him. </p><p>She scoffs and turns back to the words illuminated on blood red pages. As the light dies down and dips below the horizon, setting the moon on fire, Lila finds herself stuck in the back of her mind, replaying the image of this man she\u2019s never seen before, walking straight into the sun. </p></p>",

I wrote a lil sumn sumn and decided to share. I\u2019m hoping to actually follow thru on this story as I\u2019m feeling pretty inspired so fingers crossed it doesn\u2019t float away. Anyway, if you decide to read I hope you enjoy! It\u2019s 3.2k words and chapter numero uno of a kind of\u2026supernatural\u2026harry fic I\u2019m starting. (Let\u2019s hope this copies correctly and the format isn\u2019t fucked up)<strike>(omg it\u2019s so fucked up)</strike></i></b></p><p>Summer arrived in full force that year, sweeping into Ferris Point on an oppressive heatwave that made your whole body sweat just by looking out the window and into the harsh sunlight splintering through the still, humid air. The only refuge Lila had was her dingy apartment, if you could even call it that. The converted attic of an old rickety church was advertised as a \u201cstudio apartment\u201d and it was two rooms scarcely bigger than a shoebox. She guesses she shouldn\u2019t complain as it <i>was</i> a roof over her head\u2026no matter how often that roof leaked. And hey. It was dirt cheap.</p><p>Lila\u2019s humble abode includes a small kitchen area and three pretty big circular windows all intricately stained glass and one square window that\u2019s not. A full-size mattress resides on the floor next to a mug of lukewarm lemonade on top of a stack of books from the very minuscule town library, and a lamp <i>behind</i> the stack of books that looks suspiciously like the lamps at said library. A large and impressive peace lily sits treasured in one corner and a somewhat dusty dresser adorned with a plethora of trinkets and things in the other corner. </p><p>And of course; the air conditioner.</p><p>Lila\u2019s beautiful and most prized possession during these hot, hot summer months in the state of New York. She found it off on the side of the road in May along with a small table balancing precipitously on three good legs and a loveseat with a multitude of mysterious stains on the seat cushion, back cushion <i>and</i> armrests. They sat behind a cardboard sign scrawled with one glorious, godsent word. <i>Free</i>. So Lila, only equipped with her dear and trusty bicycle, Lorraine, looked at her wicker basket nestled between the handlebars and back to the shining air conditioner beaming in the high afternoon sun. She then made a very important decision before her mile trek back to the run down church. </p><p>She clicked her tongue and heaved the air conditioner into her tan arms and staggered all the way home, leaving poor Lorraine to fend for herself before she came back for her at sundown and rode all the way home with a smile on her face. Lila had no reason to believe that this beautiful object, circa the late 70\u2019s from the looks of it, would actually work. But the stiflingly hot nights that were already happening at the tail end of just <i>spring</i> was something she didn\u2019t even want to entertain anymore. She <i>needed</i> this to work. And work it did. For two months.</p><p>On July 14th, the warmest day thus far, reaching 115 degrees, it had ceased to function. Her teeny tiny home was no longer a refuge from the heat but rather a prison to it. The heat rose so quickly and relentlessly through the top floor of the church that Lila barely had time to collect her things before going outside to seek some shade under a cool canopy of trees and hopefully not keel over from heatstroke. </p><p>With her bag on her back and the soles of her shoes melting on the gravel driveway, Lila set off into the mouth of the woods near her house. Every time she walked into the forest she found herself increasingly more comfortable navigating its slopes and turns. The forest was a safe place for her now.</p><p>One early afternoon in April when she found herself relieved of her desk duty at the local library two hours before her shift was to end, she looked out her clear square window into the budding willow trees. They seemed to open their arms to her, inviting her in.</p><p>Growing up, Lila would have to be dragged inside by her feet, kicking and screaming and throwing mud and clumps of grass at her mother who did most of the dragging. She would play outside in the sun until her skin was peeling and rolling around in the snow until her fingers were blue. The comfort and curiosity she felt amongst the wide open world of the outdoors was unparalleled and played a key role of who she was today.</p><p>That early afternoon in April when her shadow was only a sliver of her being, she wandered into the yawning forest. The bugs and little creatures were just coming out to bask in the moderate spring temperatures, waking up from their winter sleep and rubbing the crust out of their eyes. Snowdrop flowers littered the ground and patches of sunlight bounced off the damp tree trunks and onto the forest floor, not unlike the way water from a swimming pool looks, illuminated from its depths. </p><p>On her walk, she was careful not to get lost. There wasn\u2019t really a distinct trail to follow as not many people from her small town ventured into the decently sized forest. She mentally marked trees and formations of rocks that stood out along the way, tripping over the majority of them. Before long, she stumbled upon a small clearing with long tendrils of deadened grass coming back to life and a steep drop off into a body of water. The small spring looked like it had just recently started moving again after winters ice with the water clogged with globs of grass and silt that rose to the top to make a murky appearance. </p><p>Lila, however, was in awe. The natural spring was relatively untouched and it seemed worlds away from her dingy church and monotonous job that didn\u2019t pay nearly enough for a liveable wage. Her worries about rent and groceries floated away and disappeared into the sunbeams shining down on the water. The sweat on the back of her neck trickled down through her shirt as Lila worked to discard her sneakers and take off her clothes. She carefully made her way down short cliff on a small kind of natural stairway made of boulders and stood before the slow moving water.</p><p>Lila dipped her foot in the pleasantly warm water and swirled the silt around. She waded further out, cautious of sharp shale and any living critters, and found that the spring only really got about 6 feet deep at the center. She could touch the bottom if she submerged herself a few inches and popped back up to the surface, smiling wide. Lila spent the whole day soaking up the sun\u2019s rays like a lazy fat cat. She indulged in her own little accomplishment at finding a place so serene right before the thick of summer and fantasized about all the days she\u2019d spend here. </p><p>Or so she thought. </p><p>With the heat wave and blue skies came a small drought. Nothing detrimental, just a few weeks where the dark, rich soil turned to dust and flowers began to scorch in the wretched path of the sun. It made everything ugly and surrounded by an orange hue. The trees even seemed defeated by gravity, panting like a dog and drooping towards the ground in hopes of extending their roots further to find any drop of water hiding in the earth. </p><p>This also meant that Lila\u2019s dear spring had completely evaporated from the last time she visited, just yesterday. Given, the water was a bit low then, only coming up to her chest. But she didn\u2019t think it could happen so fast. </p><p>As she walks under the shade of the forest in the pathway of trampled grass she drew out herself, she comes out the other side to the clearing full of wildflowers and sharp miscanthus grass. Lila peers over the cliff, expecting to see the sparkling gleam from the reflection of the water but discovering only a pit of rust colored dust gazing back at her. </p><p>There\u2019s a strange haze that settles over her mind suddenly and she can\u2019t seem to remember the last time she visited the spring, even though it was certainly less than 24 hours ago. There\u2019s no way a body of water this big could disappear overnight. Lila shakes her head and chalks her confusion up to dehydration. She hasn\u2019t been drinking nearly enough water as she should.</p><p>Heaving a deep sigh and wiping an exasperated hand down her face, Lila stands there for a couple of minutes feeling mildly defeated. She turns on her heel, accidentally kicking up an <i>grotesque</i> amount of dust that sticks to the <i>obscene</i> amount of moisture on her.</p><p>Coming out from beneath the lovely shade of willows and oaks, Lila walks straight past her church-home-hell and continues on the uneven gravel towards the heart of Ferris Point. </p><p>Ferris Point, population 1,559, is a small town in upstate New York. It consists of two gas stations, one movie theater, four competing bars, a handful of overflowing consignment shops and a 24 hour diner called Sandy\u2019s Gateway Getaway but everybody calls it Sandy\u2019s, for short. Sandy\u2019s dabbles in a bit of everything, from inventive food specials of the day to questionable live \u201centertainment\u201d to the ever-changing paint on its walls. </p><p>The owner, Beau, a bit of an eccentric, stout old man in his 60\u2019s with an almost full head of hair and a matching full face of beard, inherited the diner when his father passed. Sandy\u2019s is named after Beau\u2019s late mother and stays as lively and indecisive as she was. Beau has a habit of painting the diners walls to whatever color suits his mood that month, and when he paints it\u2019s the only time Sandy\u2019s is closed. </p><p>This month, the walls are a light lilac color and a beautiful respite to the burning orange haze that\u2019s covered the town. Lila heaves a sigh and this time it\u2019s in relief as a blast of ice cold air envelops her body. The diner is relatively empty and she walks towards the first booth in front of the wall of windows to the left, taking it all for herself. </p><p>She dumps her bag on the glossy enamel surface of the table, accidentally knocking over the ketchup bottle and cursing under her breath as a few books coming flying out of the broken zipper. A group of elderly women sitting at a table in the corner shoot her somewhat of an annoyed glance as Lila interrupts their riveting book club discussion about whether or not Ms. Bennett really deserved Mr. Darcy\u2019s undivided love and attention. She smiles sheepishly and ducks her head to look at the contents of her bag for her copy of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. She\u2019s been on a reread of the series, her fifth one, and she never fails to get those gleeful goosebumps.</p><p>Beau, wiping down the long oval bar that takes up the entire back wall of the diner, looks at Lila and smiles.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I getcha today, Ms. Lila? The usual?\u201d </p><p>Lila nods and grins while Beau shouts her order out to the cook. Two pancakes with warm blueberry jam and syrup, a side of scrambled eggs and a cup of orange juice, with the pulp.</p><p>\u201cYes, and can I get your biggest glass of water? If you have a very big bucket then that\u2019s fine too. Fill her up,\u201d she says with a wink. </p><p>Beau shakes his head. \u201cIs it still a fire hazard out there? I don\u2019t even want to step outside to drive home. I think my engine might blow up just by going a few blocks over,\u201d he chuckles. </p><p>\u201cYes sir,\u201d Lila says. \u201cAnd your car might just combust. My air conditioner finally kicked the bucket so I\u2019m thinking of catching a bus into Harrisburg to find a cheap fan at the Walmart or something.\u201d</p><p>Beau purses his lips, an action barely noticeable through the nest of grey hair surrounding his mouth. He makes a funny squelching noise behind his teeth and begins to talk.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cI think I might have somethin\u2019 in the back for ya. It\u2019s been there since the dawn of time practically. You\u2019re gonna have to clean the dust offa it if by some miracle it works.\u201d</p><p>Lila perks up and nods enthusiastically. \u201cWhat is it? Is it a fan? An air conditioner?

She registers the sound of heavy footsteps that kind of drag across the ground walk up to the register and the sound of a throat being cleared.  </p><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d a male voice begins, deep and raspy and <i>slow</i>, like smoke curling up. \u201cWas wondering if you could point me in the direction of the nearest store. I left my phone at home and the roads get a bit confusing here,\u201d he says with a slight laugh. </p><p>\u201cNo problem sweetie. Turn left on Clark and Mallow, another left at the stop sign on Broad Street and continue onto Route 9 for about 5 miles. There\u2019s a Walmart in Harrisburg, it\u2019s the biggest building there, ya can\u2019t miss it,\u201d the waitress says with a steady click of her nails on the screen in front of her. </p><p>\u201cThank you ma\u2019am, you\u2019re a lifesaver,\u201d the voice says, audibly relieved. Lila looks up just as he turns around and meets his eye. She\u2019s never seen him before, which is strange, because everyone here knows everyone else here.</p><p>He\u2019s about Lila\u2019s age, if not a bit older, with dirt brown hair curling around his face and glowing red in the sunset, a couple strands around his ears wet with sweat. He\u2019s got a bit of a flushed complexion and a permanent furrow to his nicely shaped brow that creates an indent just above the bridge of his nose, which is a bit of a pointy thing, but not overly. She\u2019s almost jealous of how deep his Cupid\u2019s bow is and how pink his lips are. <i>Does he have lipstick on? </i>she wonders for a split second. She can\u2019t make out the color of his eyes behind his glasses but she can see the fiery sunset behind her in their reflection. It looks like the apocalypse has already happened in his eyes. He reaches up to push back a damp curl and an assortment of rings glint in the light. </p><p>He smiles at her with closed lips and nods as a brief greeting before walking out into the offensive air, the bell above the door yelling at him to keep the heat out. Lila stares at his figure retreating into a small, old looking car but kept in a clean condition. He looks a little funny, folding his legs up and crouching down into his seat. She watches his silhouette flip the visor down and pull out of the parking lot, going the complete wrong way the lady at the register told him. </p><p>She scoffs and turns back to the words illuminated on blood red pages. As the light dies down and dips below the horizon, setting the moon on fire, Lila finds herself stuck in the back of her mind, replaying the image of this man she\u2019s never seen before, walking straight into the sun. </p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1><b><i>Heatwave</i></b> <i><b>Chapter 1:</b></i></h1><h1><i>Don&rsquo;t Look Too Long At Something That Doesn&rsquo;t Look Right</i></h1><p><b><i>Hello! I wrote a lil sumn sumn and decided to share. I&rsquo;m hoping to actually follow thru on this story as I&rsquo;m feeling pretty inspired so fingers crossed it doesn&rsquo;t float away. Anyway, if you decide to read I hope you enjoy! It&rsquo;s 3.2k words and chapter numero uno of a kind of&hellip;supernatural&hellip;harry fic I&rsquo;m starting. (Let&rsquo;s hope this copies correctly and the format isn&rsquo;t fucked up)<strike>(omg it&rsquo;s so fucked up)</strike></i></b></p><p>Summer arrived in full force that year, sweeping into Ferris Point on an oppressive heatwave that made your whole body sweat just by looking out the window and into the harsh sunlight splintering through the still, humid air. The only refuge Lila had was her dingy apartment, if you could even call it that. The converted attic of an old rickety church was advertised as a &ldquo;studio apartment&rdquo; and it was two rooms scarcely bigger than a shoebox. She guesses she shouldn&rsquo;t complain as it <i>was</i> a roof over her head&hellip;no matter how often that roof leaked. And hey. It was dirt cheap.</p><p>Lila&rsquo;s humble abode includes a small kitchen area and three pretty big circular windows all intricately stained glass and one square window that&rsquo;s not. A full-size mattress resides on the floor next to a mug of lukewarm lemonade on top of a stack of books from the very minuscule town library, and a lamp <i>behind</i> the stack of books that looks suspiciously like the lamps at said library. A large and impressive peace lily sits treasured in one corner and a somewhat dusty dresser adorned with a plethora of trinkets and things in the other corner. </p><p>And of course; the air conditioner.</p><p>Lila&rsquo;s beautiful and most prized possession during these hot, hot summer months in the state of New York. She found it off on the side of the road in May along with a small table balancing precipitously on three good legs and a loveseat with a multitude of mysterious stains on the seat cushion, back cushion <i>and</i> armrests. They sat behind a cardboard sign scrawled with one glorious, godsent word. <i>Free</i>. So Lila, only equipped with her dear and trusty bicycle, Lorraine, looked at her wicker basket nestled between the handlebars and back to the shining air conditioner beaming in the high afternoon sun. She then made a very important decision before her mile trek back to the run down church. </p><p>She clicked her tongue and heaved the air conditioner into her tan arms and staggered all the way home, leaving poor Lorraine to fend for herself before she came back for her at sundown and rode all the way home with a smile on her face. Lila had no reason to believe that this beautiful object, circa the late 70&rsquo;s from the looks of it, would actually work. But the stiflingly hot nights that were already happening at the tail end of just <i>spring</i> was something she didn&rsquo;t even want to entertain anymore. She <i>needed</i> this to work. And work it did. For two months.</p><p>On July 14th, the warmest day thus far, reaching 115 degrees, it had ceased to function. Her teeny tiny home was no longer a refuge from the heat but rather a prison to it. The heat rose so quickly and relentlessly through the top floor of the church that Lila barely had time to collect her things before going outside to seek some shade under a cool canopy of trees and hopefully not keel over from heatstroke. </p><p>With her bag on her back and the soles of her shoes melting on the gravel driveway, Lila set off into the mouth of the woods near her house. Every time she walked into the forest she found herself increasingly more comfortable navigating its slopes and turns. The forest was a safe place for her now.</p><p>One early afternoon in April when she found herself relieved of her desk duty at the local library two hours before her shift was to end, she looked out her clear square window into the budding willow trees. They seemed to open their arms to her, inviting her in.</p><p>Growing up, Lila would have to be dragged inside by her feet, kicking and screaming and throwing mud and clumps of grass at her mother who did most of the dragging. She would play outside in the sun until her skin was peeling and rolling around in the snow until her fingers were blue. The comfort and curiosity she felt amongst the wide open world of the outdoors was unparalleled and played a key role of who she was today.</p><p>That early afternoon in April when her shadow was only a sliver of her being, she wandered into the yawning forest. The bugs and little creatures were just coming out to bask in the moderate spring temperatures, waking up from their winter sleep and rubbing the crust out of their eyes. Snowdrop flowers littered the ground and patches of sunlight bounced off the damp tree trunks and onto the forest floor, not unlike the way water from a swimming pool looks, illuminated from its depths. </p><p>On her walk, she was careful not to get lost. There wasn&rsquo;t really a distinct trail to follow as not many people from her small town ventured into the decently sized forest. She mentally marked trees and formations of rocks that stood out along the way, tripping over the majority of them. Before long, she stumbled upon a small clearing with long tendrils of deadened grass coming back to life and a steep drop off into a body of water. The small spring looked like it had just recently started moving again after winters ice with the water clogged with globs of grass and silt that rose to the top to make a murky appearance. </p><p>Lila, however, was in awe. The natural spring was relatively untouched and it seemed worlds away from her dingy church and monotonous job that didn&rsquo;t pay nearly enough for a liveable wage. Her worries about rent and groceries floated away and disappeared into the sunbeams shining down on the water. The sweat on the back of her neck trickled down through her shirt as Lila worked to discard her sneakers and take off her clothes. She carefully made her way down short cliff on a small kind of natural stairway made of boulders and stood before the slow moving water.</p><p>Lila dipped her foot in the pleasantly warm water and swirled the silt around. She waded further out, cautious of sharp shale and any living critters, and found that the spring only really got about 6 feet deep at the center. She could touch the bottom if she submerged herself a few inches and popped back up to the surface, smiling wide. Lila spent the whole day soaking up the sun&rsquo;s rays like a lazy fat cat. She indulged in her own little accomplishment at finding a place so serene right before the thick of summer and fantasized about all the days she&rsquo;d spend here. </p><p>Or so she thought. </p><p>With the heat wave and blue skies came a small drought. Nothing detrimental, just a few weeks where the dark, rich soil turned to dust and flowers began to scorch in the wretched path of the sun. It made everything ugly and surrounded by an orange hue. The trees even seemed defeated by gravity, panting like a dog and drooping towards the ground in hopes of extending their roots further to find any drop of water hiding in the earth. </p><p>This also meant that Lila&rsquo;s dear spring had completely evaporated from the last time she visited, just yesterday. Given, the water was a bit low then, only coming up to her chest. But she didn&rsquo;t think it could happen so fast. </p><p>As she walks under the shade of the forest in the pathway of trampled grass she drew out herself, she comes out the other side to the clearing full of wildflowers and sharp miscanthus grass. Lila peers over the cliff, expecting to see the sparkling gleam from the reflection of the water but discovering only a pit of rust colored dust gazing back at her. </p><p>There&rsquo;s a strange haze that settles over her mind suddenly and she can&rsquo;t seem to remember the last time she visited the spring, even though it was certainly less than 24 hours ago. There&rsquo;s no way a body of water this big could disappear overnight. Lila shakes her head and chalks her confusion up to dehydration. She hasn&rsquo;t been drinking nearly enough water as she should.</p><p>Heaving a deep sigh and wiping an exasperated hand down her face, Lila stands there for a couple of minutes feeling mildly defeated. She turns on her heel, accidentally kicking up an <i>grotesque</i> amount of dust that sticks to the <i>obscene</i> amount of moisture on her.</p><p>Coming out from beneath the lovely shade of willows and oaks, Lila walks straight past her church-home-hell and continues on the uneven gravel towards the heart of Ferris Point. </p><p>Ferris Point, population 1,559, is a small town in upstate New York. It consists of two gas stations, one movie theater, four competing bars, a handful of overflowing consignment shops and a 24 hour diner called Sandy&rsquo;s Gateway Getaway but everybody calls it Sandy&rsquo;s, for short. Sandy&rsquo;s dabbles in a bit of everything, from inventive food specials of the day to questionable live &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; to the ever-changing paint on its walls. </p><p>The owner, Beau, a bit of an eccentric, stout old man in his 60&rsquo;s with an almost full head of hair and a matching full face of beard, inherited the diner when his father passed. Sandy&rsquo;s is named after Beau&rsquo;s late mother and stays as lively and indecisive as she was. Beau has a habit of painting the diners walls to whatever color suits his mood that month, and when he paints it&rsquo;s the only time Sandy&rsquo;s is closed. </p><p>This month, the walls are a light lilac color and a beautiful respite to the burning orange haze that&rsquo;s covered the town. Lila heaves a sigh and this time it&rsquo;s in relief as a blast of ice cold air envelops her body. The diner is relatively empty and she walks towards the first booth in front of the wall of windows to the left, taking it all for herself. </p><p>She dumps her bag on the glossy enamel surface of the table, accidentally knocking over the ketchup bottle and cursing under her breath as a few books coming flying out of the broken zipper. A group of elderly women sitting at a table in the corner shoot her somewhat of an annoyed glance as Lila interrupts their riveting book club discussion about whether or not Ms. Bennett really deserved Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s undivided love and attention. She smiles sheepishly and ducks her head to look at the contents of her bag for her copy of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. She&rsquo;s been on a reread of the series, her fifth one, and she never fails to get those gleeful goosebumps.</p><p>Beau, wiping down the long oval bar that takes up the entire back wall of the diner, looks at Lila and smiles.</p><p>&ldquo;What can I getcha today, Ms. Lila? The usual?&rdquo; </p><p>Lila nods and grins while Beau shouts her order out to the cook. Two pancakes with warm blueberry jam and syrup, a side of scrambled eggs and a cup of orange juice, with the pulp.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and can I get your biggest glass of water? If you have a very big bucket then that&rsquo;s fine too. Fill her up,&rdquo; she says with a wink. </p><p>Beau shakes his head. &ldquo;Is it still a fire hazard out there? I don&rsquo;t even want to step outside to drive home. I think my engine might blow up just by going a few blocks over,&rdquo; he chuckles. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; Lila says. &ldquo;And your car might just combust. My air conditioner finally kicked the bucket so I&rsquo;m thinking of catching a bus into Harrisburg to find a cheap fan at the Walmart or something.&rdquo;</p><p>Beau purses his lips, an action barely noticeable through the nest of grey hair surrounding his mouth. He makes a funny squelching noise behind his teeth and begins to talk.</p><p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I think I might have somethin&rsquo; in the back for ya. It&rsquo;s been there since the dawn of time practically. You&rsquo;re gonna have to clean the dust offa it if by some miracle it works.&rdquo;</p><p>Lila perks up and nods enthusiastically. &ldquo;What is it? Is it a fan? An air conditioner? Please say air conditioner, Beau, <i>please</i>. I think I might suffocate in my sleep because of this humidity,&rdquo; she groans out. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big industrial fan,&rdquo; Beau says with a chuckle. &ldquo;If it turns on, you can call it yours. If you need me to, I can drop it off at your house when I leave. I take it you&rsquo;re gonna stay here for a while?&rdquo; he says, raising his eyebrows and pointedly looking at her already cozy set up. Her book is open face up in front of her and her feet are propped up on the cushion in front of her. Her phone is plugged into an outlet hiding just underneath the table behind the napkin dispenser and her bag has been turned into a makeshift armrest. </p><p>Lila laughs, a quick light sound, and she can feel the sweat already cooling her neck as she nods. She&rsquo;s never felt comfier. She could sleep here, she thinks.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you <i>so</i> much Beau. How much do you want for it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; the owner says, waving away her question. &ldquo;It only collects dust back there anyway. I mean it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At least let me pay you for bringing it to my house. But please don&rsquo;t try bringing it up to my hallway. No offense, but you might break your back. I fear for the safety of my spine just carrying my groceries up those flights of stairs. It&rsquo;s ridiculously steep so leave that to me,&rdquo; Lila says with a grimace.</p><p>&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; he laughs. He walks through the swinging doors to the back to plug the fan in. He walks back out and gives a quick thumbs up signaling that it works. Lila tilts her head back onto the plush seat, smiling, and closes her eyes. It&rsquo;s something, she thinks. She thanks her lucky stars and hears someone make a shushing sound and the volume on the TV increase. The screen shows a weatherman standing in front of a map of the region and gesturing to the temperatures at each city on the map, reporting on this next weeks forecast. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, folks, it looks like there&rsquo;s no break in this heatwave anytime soon,&rdquo; the man says with a click of his tongue. He points to the dot on the map saying Ferris Point as well as Harrisburg and Troy and all the towns around it. </p><p>&ldquo;It seems this region in particular has been hit the worst with temperatures rising up to almost 120 degrees and with little refuge during the night as it drops down to 92 with the humidity at 81 percent. This week&rsquo;s forecast stays at a steady 110 degrees and above with little temperature fluctuation. Mostly sunny with little chance of rain until next Friday where hopefully, fingers crossed, a mean looking storm cloud heading in from the Midwest will break the wave and end the drought. This has been your local weather forecast with Bob Kadinsky, thank you for tuning in.&rdquo;</p><p>The old-lady-book-club in the corner all visibly deflate at once while slowly fanning themselves with their paperbacks of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. As does Lila. She&rsquo;s sick of the heat and sick of constantly being in a near dehydrated state for the past week. </p><p>Lila slumps back into her seat, diving into the greatest literary creation of all time, until her food is brought out. She practically inhales the warm and fluffy pancakes and is pretty sure she beat some kind of record for taking the fastest drink of water ever. She asks for a second mason jar of the icy cold goodness and gets comfortable again. </p><p>An hour in the women have left and the only people in the diner are Lila, the cook and one waitress typing something into the register with one hand on her hip. Beau left some ten or so minutes ago reminding Lila about the fan.</p><p>The sun is setting and a reddish glow enters the room, washing over the checkerboard tile and the vibrancy catches the fresh lilac paint on fire, it seems. </p><p>Just then, the bell above the front door calls out, signaling a new arrival. Lila pays no attention, mindlessly shrinking away from the hot air blowing into the back of her hair, entirely engrossed in the world of Harry Potter.

        "answer": "<p><b>Oh my god, it broke me but I managed to give it a happy ending!! Hope you like it :)<br/></b></p><hr><p>Y/N and Harry had been married for two years.</p><p>In these two years, both of them had been fighting non stop. Because of Harry\u2019s career as a rockstar means that him and his life would be in spotlight constantly. Y/N wasn\u2019t too happy about it, but she\u2019s willing to\u00a0compromise for Harry. He is the love of her life, after all.<br/><br/>But being in the spotlight for too long made her tired. There\u2019s always paparazzi outside their house taking pictures of her doing stuff, and she will be paranoid because there\u2019s always someone watching. Whenever she told her husband, he would say that he\u2019ll deal with it, but a week later the paps would still come back.<br/><br/>It\u2019s not Harry\u2019s fault, honestly. But she really needs a break, she needs Harry. She needs her husband to be there, by her side. Sometimes both of them are so tired that they would argue, from small things like doing chores to big things like him flirting with other girls while he\u2019s drunk. And it\u2019s hurting her and Harry, so much to a point she had to call it quits.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s\u2026give it a break.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019ll never forget that look Harry had on his face. He\u2019s heartbroken, the tears in his eyes threatening to fall out, he looks so helpless, but he still gave her what she wanted, separation.<br/><br/>She just couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u00a0Before marriage they were in love, but now they are like strangers. Maybe they were rushing, maybe they should\u2019ve waited a few more years to get married. It\u2019s like they didn\u2019t think through. If someone asks Y/N two years ago, she would say was sure that he loves her very much.</p><p><i></i></p><p>Now she thinks that Harry\u2019s love for her had slowly faded.
