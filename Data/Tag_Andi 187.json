TJ, his roommate, looked over at him from where he was sitting on the couch. Cyrus continued groaning as he took off his jacket and sat down on the couch. TJ watched him the whole time.</p><p>\u201cYou alright, Cy?\u201d TJ asked putting away the book he was reading. Cyrus, who was looking up at the ceiling in despair, didn\u2019t respond. TJ punched Cyrus\u2019s arm lightly. \u201cCy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go home for Hanukkah,\u201d Cyrus explained. TJ\u2019s heart sank. He knew how much Hanukkah meant to Cyrus. \u201cI have finals all week, and there\u2019s supposed to be this huge snowstorm. I have to stay here until like the end of December.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d TJ said putting a hand on Cyrus\u2019s knee. \u201cI\u2019ll be here, though. I have finals, and I have to work at the library during break anyway. Somebody has to organize the books while everyone\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as long as I have you,\u201d Cyrus said smiling for the first time since he walked through the door. Cyrus stood up abruptly, ruffled TJ\u2019s hair, and walked to his room. </p><p>TJ knew how important Hanukkah was to Cyrus. He knew Cyrus was completely devastated even if he pretended to be fine. He also knew another thing: he had to make Hanukkah great for Cyrus. He pulled out his phone and started researching Hanukkah traditions.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>The next few days were incredibly hectic for TJ. He had to buy all the ingredients and things. He also had to hide everything from Cyrus. All eight of his presents were hidden under TJ\u2019s bed. TJ decided to wait until the first day of Hanukkah to start cooking everything. Cyrus had two finals, so he wouldn\u2019t be home until later.</p><p>TJ thought it was the perfect idea, but maybe it wasn\u2019t. He pretty much had no idea what he was doing. At first, nothing was that bad. He made the brisket, and it actually turned out pretty well. </p><p>The problem began with the sufganiyot. The whole baking and frying part was simple, but the whole jelly thing was a problem and a half. It was a whole lot messier than TJ had imagined. He got jelly all over the place. But, they were filled and done. He would clean up the mess later.</p><p>Then, came the latkes. TJ thought he had it all under control. However, he was completely wrong. Within minutes, they were burned, and the smoke alarm was going off. TJ ran over to it and tried to fan it with a towel. He ran back over to the stove and shut it off. In the process, he knocked the sufganiyot off the table. They all fell to the floor.</p><p>TJ heard the door open, and he ran over to stop Cyrus from seeing the mess he created. In the process, he slipped on the sufganiyot and fell flat on his ass. Cyrus ran over to him to make sure he was okay.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d Cyrus asked looking around. TJ sat up looking very embarrassed and disappointed. </p><p>\u201cI just wanted you to have a good Hanukkah, and I ruined everything,\u201d TJ explained bitterly. Cyrus was smiling at him. \u201cWhy are you smiling? I ruined everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried so hard, and that means the world to me,\u201d Cyrus said hugging TJ. TJ hugged him back. \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad that it didn\u2019t work out perfectly. Besides, we still have seven more nights to make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still feel awful,\u201d TJ said, but Cyrus looked at him with a soft smile. \u201cAre you sure everything\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is more than okay,\u201d Cyrus reassured him. He leaned in and kissed TJ. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how long I\u2019ve been waiting to hear that,\u201d TJ whispered causing Cyrus to blush. TJ stood up and pulled Cyrus up with him. \u201cWanna help me clean this up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually, but I think I have something a little more fun in mind,\u201d Cyrus said pulling TJ over to the couch.

TJ, his roommate, looked over at him from where he was sitting on the couch. Cyrus continued groaning as he took off his jacket and sat down on the couch. TJ watched him the whole time.</p><p>\u201cYou alright, Cy?\u201d TJ asked putting away the book he was reading. Cyrus, who was looking up at the ceiling in despair, didn\u2019t respond. TJ punched Cyrus\u2019s arm lightly. \u201cCy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go home for Hanukkah,\u201d Cyrus explained. TJ\u2019s heart sank. He knew how much Hanukkah meant to Cyrus. \u201cI have finals all week, and there\u2019s supposed to be this huge snowstorm. I have to stay here until like the end of December.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d TJ said putting a hand on Cyrus\u2019s knee. \u201cI\u2019ll be here, though. I have finals, and I have to work at the library during break anyway. Somebody has to organize the books while everyone\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as long as I have you,\u201d Cyrus said smiling for the first time since he walked through the door. Cyrus stood up abruptly, ruffled TJ\u2019s hair, and walked to his room. </p><p>TJ knew how important Hanukkah was to Cyrus. He knew Cyrus was completely devastated even if he pretended to be fine. He also knew another thing: he had to make Hanukkah great for Cyrus. He pulled out his phone and started researching Hanukkah traditions.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>The next few days were incredibly hectic for TJ. He had to buy all the ingredients and things. He also had to hide everything from Cyrus. All eight of his presents were hidden under TJ\u2019s bed. TJ decided to wait until the first day of Hanukkah to start cooking everything. Cyrus had two finals, so he wouldn\u2019t be home until later.</p><p>TJ thought it was the perfect idea, but maybe it wasn\u2019t. He pretty much had no idea what he was doing. At first, nothing was that bad. He made the brisket, and it actually turned out pretty well. </p><p>The problem began with the sufganiyot. The whole baking and frying part was simple, but the whole jelly thing was a problem and a half. It was a whole lot messier than TJ had imagined. He got jelly all over the place. But, they were filled and done. He would clean up the mess later.</p><p>Then, came the latkes. TJ thought he had it all under control. However, he was completely wrong. Within minutes, they were burned, and the smoke alarm was going off. TJ ran over to it and tried to fan it with a towel. He ran back over to the stove and shut it off. In the process, he knocked the sufganiyot off the table. They all fell to the floor.</p><p>TJ heard the door open, and he ran over to stop Cyrus from seeing the mess he created. In the process, he slipped on the sufganiyot and fell flat on his ass. Cyrus ran over to him to make sure he was okay.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d Cyrus asked looking around. TJ sat up looking very embarrassed and disappointed. </p><p>\u201cI just wanted you to have a good Hanukkah, and I ruined everything,\u201d TJ explained bitterly. Cyrus was smiling at him. \u201cWhy are you smiling? I ruined everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried so hard, and that means the world to me,\u201d Cyrus said hugging TJ. TJ hugged him back. \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad that it didn\u2019t work out perfectly. Besides, we still have seven more nights to make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still feel awful,\u201d TJ said, but Cyrus looked at him with a soft smile. \u201cAre you sure everything\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is more than okay,\u201d Cyrus reassured him. He leaned in and kissed TJ. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how long I\u2019ve been waiting to hear that,\u201d TJ whispered causing Cyrus to blush. TJ stood up and pulled Cyrus up with him. \u201cWanna help me clean this up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually, but I think I have something a little more fun in mind,\u201d Cyrus said pulling TJ over to the couch. Just like that, the worst Hanukkah ever turned into the best Hanukkah ever. </p></p>",
