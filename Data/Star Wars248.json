The rest of the coloring for the Y-Wings was handled with decals.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/21e0e682a8260df2a3665ec639c6319f/tumblr_inline_pf5h3gHpAx1tof5ad_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I\n purchased pre-weathered decals for these from Nicholas Sagan from eBay.\n The decals were way too soft at first and kept curling up , so I \nsprayed them a few times with Testors Decal Bonder to make them a bit \nfirmer.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c9c9e258e97304d35bd4e7bc8514902/tumblr_inline_pf5h4dgPTj1tof5ad_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dffe0e32e1e94aa487a59b4980ef894c/tumblr_inline_pf5h4eJNP01tof5ad_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/efac2c5febf8394d5a7d44114b67191f/tumblr_inline_pf5h4jLYgX1tof5ad_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0f04e0a9bb25c208c310ef492145b11/tumblr_inline_pf5h4myBTo1tof5ad_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/93ae4b19548c9cd8303b52357c1b6992/tumblr_inline_pf5h5jHTsO1tof5ad_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/51d0862a35fdadce6f2c536e839e25de/tumblr_inline_pf5h5kCUnk1tof5ad_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7938f92f0397550c4fb91c3883b283b0/tumblr_inline_pf5h5m6XOX1tof5ad_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The bases have custom decals I printed up on white Fine Molds decal paper.

But while Leia possesses some of her biological father\u2019s\npersonality traits&ndash;including a quick temper and a tendency to snarkily comment on people\u2019s height,\nor lack thereof&ndash;she did not inherit his predilection for telekinesis. Leia\u2019s\nnatural inclinations through the Force lean toward the empathic.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cOrgana has been shown to possess a\nstrong Force sense.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAfter her birth, Organa was left with\na lasting impression of images and feelings of her mother\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhen Skywalker failed to contact\nKenobi while hanging underneath Bespin&rsquo;s Cloud City, weak and helpless, he\ncalled out to Organa with the Force, apparently out of instinct. Organa sensed\nhim and was able to direct the\u00a0Millennium Falcon\u00a0to his\nlocation.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAfter the second Death Star blew up,\nOrgana assured Solo that Skywalker had not been on it at the time, actively\ndemonstrating the ability to sense her brother&rsquo;s presence.\u00a0A few days\nlater, she was able to sense the lingering dark presence of Darth Maul in the\nTheed Royal Palace, dating back to his duel against Obi-Wan Kenobi and\u00a0</i><i>Qui-Gon Jinn</i><i>\u00a0during the\u00a0</i><i>Battle of Naboo</i><i> </i>(<i>Shattered Empire, Part\nIII</i>)<i>. She felt a disturbance in the Force when the Hosnian System was destroyed\nby Starkiller Base. She later was able to sense Han Solo&rsquo;s death at the hands\nof their son through the Force while she was present on D'Qar, the event\noccurring on Starkiller Base\u201d.\u00a0 </i>&ndash;<a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Leia_Organa\" target=\"_blank\">Wookieepedia, Leia Organa</a></p></blockquote><p>And, mixed with her\nmaternal instinct and the biological connection of pregnancy, she was able to sense\nbaby Ben\u2019s impending personality, his gender, his inherent light, and\nSnoke\u2019s encroaching presence, when he was still in the womb (<i>Aftermath: Life\nDebt</i> and <i>Empire\u2019s End</i>).\u00a0</p><p>Luke didn\u2019t inherit their father\u2019s\nnatural telekinetic proficiency, either. He became very good at it&ndash;the hutsplosion may have been \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextra\u2122 as all hell, but it <i>was</i> impressive, I\u2019ll give him that&ndash;but it took\na lot of work and years of training and gradual development.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c\u2026Skywalker surmised on his own that\nthe Force could be used to manipulate matter in the manner of telekinesis and\nmanaged to learn how to move small objects\u2026\u00a0</i>(<i>Heir to the Jedi</i>)<i> By the time\nof the Battle of Hoth, Skywalker had the ability to pull his lightsaber to his\nhands, though not without difficulty. Under Yoda&rsquo;s training, this ability was\nfurther developed, enabling him to levitate several objects at once while\nmeditating. At the time of his exile some 30 years later, Luke demonstrated\neven stronger telekinesis\u2026\u201d</i>\u00a0 &ndash;<a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker\" target=\"_blank\">Luke Skywalker, Wookieepedia</a></p></blockquote><p>I do think he got a <i>different</i> natural Force\ninclination from Anakin, though. Dreams and visions.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c[Anakin] Skywalker also showed\u00a0<b>aptitude\nfor precognitive dreams</b>, as was the case when he foresaw the deaths of both\nhis mother and his wife in dreams, but also of himself becoming a Jedi, back\nwhen he lived with his mother on Tatooine.\u201d\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\u00a0\u201c[Luke] also demonstrated the <b>ability\nto have visions</b> several times\u201d.\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><p>This happened with him in <i>The Weapon\nof a Jedi</i>, there\u2019s his cave vision on Dagobah, as well as the premonition of\nLeia and Han being captured and harmed. Same as with Anakin, these weren\u2019t\nthings he was actively <i>trying</i>\u00a0to see, the Force just showed them to him. Just as\nit did with his AU dream that prologues the <i>Last Jedi</i> novelization.</p><hr><p>So, back\nto the Skywalker masters of telekinesis. As for Anakin:</p><p>There were the couple times he nonchalantly floated objects around in <i>Attack of the Clones</i>, which he mentioned Obi-Wan wouldn\u2019t approve of. In <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>, he inadvertently grief/rage-crushed all the medical equipment in the room after Palpatine told him Padme was dead. Then, in the <i>Darth Vader </i>comic that takes place beginning in this scene, he Force-slammed Palpatine into a wall. Later on&hellip;</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHe demonstrated enough telekinetic\npower to stop an AT-AT from stepping on him, and had been in the process of\ntearing it apart before he was interrupted in doing so </i>(<i>SW #2, Skywalker Strikes,\nPart II</i>)<i>. On another occasion he also telekinetically lifted two AT-DP\nwalkers off of himself without any apparent strain\u201d </i>(<i>SW Rebels, </i>\u201cThe Siege of\nLothal\u201d)<i>.</i></p></blockquote><p>And reminder, this was when he was Vader,\nso he was half cybernetic at the time.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHe also demonstrated the ability to\ngrab hold of an engine-damaged Twi'lek freighter and bring it to the\nground,\u00a0and\u00a0crush a\u00a0Lambda-class\nshuttle\u2019s engines in mid-flight\u00a0to take it down </i>(<i>Lords of the Sith; DV #15, Vader Down, Part IV</i>)<i>.\u00a0He was able to utilize a Force push that was\npowerful enough to blow apart numerous lyleks simultaneously, despite the fact\nthat the creatures\u2019 carapaces were impervious to even heavy blaster fire </i>(<i>LotS</i>)<i>.\n\u2026On at least one occasion, he demonstrated that he was\u00a0able to telekinetically manipulate objects\nwithout the<b> </b>need to gesture at them<b>\u00a0</b>as virtually all\nother Force adepts did. This granted him the\u00a0<b>ability to throw objects with the Force whilst actively engaged in\nswordplay</b>\u201d<b>\u00a0</b></i>(<i>TESB</i>)<i>.</i></p></blockquote><p>I don\u2019t think this has been confirmed,\nbut isn\u2019t that <i>maybe</i> what Ben did during the Praetorian guard fight when Rey\nused him for leverage and it looks like he did a backhanded Force push on the\nguards she was facing? Anyway&ndash;</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cVader was also capable of using his\ntelekinetic abilities to\u00a0perform\nextremely delicate, complex, and precise tasks. On one occasion, he\nreturned his badly damaged cybernetic limbs to perfect working order by\ndismantling a broken droid and telekinetically repairing himself with its\ncomponents\u00a0</i>(<i>DV, Dark Lord of the Sith #4: The Chosen One, Part IV</i>)<i>.\u00a0He also demonstrated the ability to crush internal organs with\nthe Force.<sup></sup> At one point\nduring an interrogation he used the Force to inflict torturous amounts of pain\non several insurgent prisoners, to the point of causing heart failure in one of\nthem\u201d </i>(<i>Tarkin</i>)<i>.</i></p></blockquote><p>So basically, Poe was lucky Ben isn\u2019t\n<i>as</i> adept at telekinesis as Anakin came to be and he got off pretty easy,\nbecause, YIKES.\u00a0\ud83d\ude2c And speaking of Ben:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe dark side that flowed through him\nmade him a nearly unstoppable force, and he was <b>a powerful user of telekinetic\nattacks and defenses</b>. He notably used this to send Rey flying against a tree\nand to pull Dopheld Mitaka by the neck to his hand, as well as to hold him up\nwith one hand while still pulling them with the Force.\u00a0When defending\nhimself from Skywalker the night his master came close to murdering him, Ren\nwas able to telekinetically collapse an entire hut on Luke while keeping it\nfrom harming him and clashing blades with Skywalker at the same time.\u00a0He\nwas proficient enough to use telekinetic halts in combat, which notably allowed\nhim to freeze the motion of a target, allowing him to immobilize and restrain\npeople and even to hold a blaster bolt midair for over a minute. He was also\nable to manipulate the movements of living beings, which allowed him to force\nRey to point her blaster at the floor as he simultaneously froze her in place.\u201d\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\n\nEven his use of the <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mind_probe_(Force_power)\" title=\"Mind probe (Force power)\" target=\"_blank\">mind probe</a> was strong enough to exert physical force on a subject, as he pinned Poe Dameron against his interrogation chair and held up Del Meeko by the arms without touching them</i> (SW Battlefront 2).\u00a0 &ndash;<a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Telekinesis\" target=\"_blank\">Wookieepedia, Telekinesis</a><br/></p></blockquote><p>Yet with all this, and his apparent ability to stop a torpedo like it\u2019s nothing, my mind was stuck on them being just indications of how powerful he is. Which they <i>are</i>, but of course he\u2019s very powerful, he\u2019s a Skywalker. I wasn\u2019t putting it together that all this was also telekinesis, and that it\u2019s Ben\u2019s&ndash;*Obi-Wan voice*&ndash;speciality. It wasn\u2019t until coming upon this little\ntidbit <a href=\"https://fluffycakesistainted.tumblr.com/post/176928538302/just-skimming-through-anakins-wookieepedia-page\" target=\"_blank\">while skimming</a> Ani\u2019s Wookiepedia page that the connection really started to click:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHe could lift lightsabers in the air\n</i><b><i>and ignite them with ease</i></b><i>, as he did once to scare a pair of Padawans who had called him a \u2018slave\nto his emotions\u2019\u201d\u00a0</i>(<i>Obi-Wan &amp; Anakin, Part I</i>)\n\n</p></blockquote><p>Ummmmm&hellip; Ok. And then there\u2019s <i>this</i>:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\u201cWhen the last Sugi warrior appears with their lightsabers, Anakin </i><b><i>uses the Force to activate them, killing him</i></b><i> as well\u201d. \u00a0&ndash; </i><a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/In_Search_of_the_Crystal\" target=\"_blank\">Wookieepedia, \u201cIn Search of the Crystal\u201d</a> (an unfinished, but canon, <i>Clone Wars</i> episode)\n\n<br/></p><p><i>\u201cA pragmatic combatant, Skywalker\u2026would\nresort to activate to lethal results when being held by unsuspecting enemies,\nonce impressing Kenobi by <b>telekinetically activating their lightsabers</b> (both in\nChong&rsquo;s possession) <b>and cutting apart the Sugi before pulling the lightsabers\nto his hands</b>.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>lmao, WUT?!\u00a0\ud83d\ude02</p><p>Well uh, ergo,\u00a0the manner of Snoke\u2019s death may not have\nbeen something Rian Johnson thought up whole cloth, but was probably inspired\nby Anakin\u2019s actions in established canon. Which would make complete sense,\nsince Ben <i>used Anakin\u2019s lightsaber to do it</i>, and he\u2019s meant to parallel Anakin\nin general. Plus, the whole thing was a perfect combination of both his\ngrandfather, <i>and</i> his namesake. The bisection was pure Obi-Wan (Maul says hi,\nbtw) and the method was pure Anakin. Almost as if the dynamic duo of \u201cKenobi and\nSkywalker\u201d were working together again\u2014but spiritually, through the young Solo.\u00a0</p><p>So in conclusion, Anakin was naturally\nan absolute <i>BEAST</i> with Force telekinesis, and so is his grandson, Ben&ndash;a talent which he\ninherited directly from his grandfather, and which completely skipped a\ngeneration, seeing as neither his mother nor his uncle exhibited such levels of\ninherent telekinetic skill. \u00a0</p>",

He was also\nable to manipulate the movements of living beings, which allowed him to force\nRey to point her blaster at the floor as he simultaneously froze her in place.\u201d\u00a0</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\n\nEven his use of the <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mind_probe_(Force_power)\" title=\"Mind probe (Force power)\" target=\"_blank\">mind probe</a> was strong enough to exert physical force on a subject, as he pinned Poe Dameron against his interrogation chair and held up Del Meeko by the arms without touching them</i> (SW Battlefront 2).\u00a0 \u2013<a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Telekinesis\" target=\"_blank\">Wookieepedia, Telekinesis</a><br></p></blockquote><p>Yet with all this, and his apparent ability to stop a torpedo like it\u2019s nothing, my mind was stuck on them being just indications of how powerful he is. Which they <i>are</i>, but of course he\u2019s very powerful, he\u2019s a Skywalker. I wasn\u2019t putting it together that all this was also telekinesis, and that it\u2019s Ben\u2019s\u2013*Obi-Wan voice*\u2013speciality. It wasn\u2019t until coming upon this little\ntidbit <a href=\"https://fluffycakesistainted.tumblr.com/post/176928538302/just-skimming-through-anakins-wookieepedia-page\" target=\"_blank\">while skimming</a> Ani\u2019s Wookiepedia page that the connection really started to click:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHe could lift lightsabers in the air\n</i><b><i>and ignite them with ease</i></b><i>, as he did once to scare a pair of Padawans who had called him a \u2018slave\nto his emotions\u2019\u201d\u00a0</i>(<i>Obi-Wan &amp; Anakin, Part I</i>)\n\n</p></blockquote><p>Ummmmm\u2026 Ok. And then there\u2019s <i>this</i>:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\u201cWhen the last Sugi warrior appears with their lightsabers, Anakin </i><b><i>uses the Force to activate them, killing him</i></b><i> as well\u201d. \u00a0\u2013 </i><a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/In_Search_of_the_Crystal\" target=\"_blank\">Wookieepedia, \u201cIn Search of the Crystal\u201d</a> (an unfinished, but canon, <i>Clone Wars</i> episode)\n\n<br></p><p><i>\u201cA pragmatic combatant, Skywalker\u2026would\nresort to activate to lethal results when being held by unsuspecting enemies,\nonce impressing Kenobi by <b>telekinetically activating their lightsabers</b> (both in\nChong\u2019s possession) <b>and cutting apart the Sugi before pulling the lightsabers\nto his hands</b>.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>lmao, WUT?!\u00a0\ud83d\ude02</p><p>Well uh, ergo,\u00a0the manner of Snoke\u2019s death may not have\nbeen something Rian Johnson thought up whole cloth, but was probably inspired\nby Anakin\u2019s actions in established canon. Which would make complete sense,\nsince Ben <i>used Anakin\u2019s lightsaber to do it</i>, and he\u2019s meant to parallel Anakin\nin general. Plus, the whole thing was a perfect combination of both his\ngrandfather, <i>and</i> his namesake. The bisection was pure Obi-Wan (Maul says hi,\nbtw) and the method was pure Anakin. Almost as if the dynamic duo of \u201cKenobi and\nSkywalker\u201d were working together again\u2014but spiritually, through the young Solo.\u00a0</p><p>So in conclusion, Anakin was naturally\nan absolute <i>BEAST</i> with Force telekinesis, and so is his grandson, Ben\u2013a talent which he\ninherited directly from his grandfather, and which completely skipped a\ngeneration, seeing as neither his mother nor his uncle exhibited such levels of\ninherent telekinetic skill. \u00a0</p></p>",

For instance, Anakin \u201c<i>struggled in using the Force to control and\nbefriend animals, noting that Kenobi was much better at it than he was</i>\u201d (<a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker\" target=\"_blank\">X</a>, <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Crystal_Crisis\" target=\"_blank\">X</a>). This\nwas also shown to be a significant skill of Ezra Bridger\u2019s in <i>Star Wars Rebels</i>.\nMace Windu\u2019s \u201c<i>particular gift [was] to see how people and situations fit together\nin the Force. \u2026Though he could not consistently determine the significance of\nthe structures he perceived\u2026the presence of shatterpoints was always clear</i>\u201d\n(M.S, <i>RotS</i>). Then there was Obi-Wan\u2019s famous penchant for mind tricks (telepathy). Which his Master, Qui-Gon, also seemed to favor. And Anakin, throughout the entirety of his Jedi- and Sithhood\u2026</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026was\u00a0<b>skilled in telekinesis</b>: even as a late beginner, by his own\nadmission, he was very good at it, <b>better than any Padawan his age, and most of\nthe older ones as well</b>\u201d </i>(<i>Obi-Wan &amp; Anakin, Part III</i>)<i>\u00a0 \u2013</i><a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker\" target=\"_blank\">Wookieepedia, Anakin Skywalker</a><br></p></blockquote>[[MORE]]<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nOT established that Vader\u2019s go-to offensive maneuver was Force choking, which\nis telekinetic. And one of my favorite things ever in <i>Star Wars </i>is when he just\nstarts chucking large objects at Luke with the Force during their Bespin duel,\nuntil he breaks that window. Then come the ST, and the very first Force move we\nsee Ben enact is stopping a blaster bolt midair, which was just the <i>first</i> sign\nthat telekinesis is His Thing\u2122. I mean, seeing Force-users easily <i>deflect </i>blaster\nbolts via lightsaber, with form technique and what Qui-Gon would call \u201c<i>Jedi reflexes</i>\u201d,\nis old hat to long-time fans. But to <i>halt</i> one midair? That is literally somethin else. And Ben\nclaimed that he\u2019d also be able to do a much larger-scale version of this when,\nhis wingmate having fired at and hit the Raddus in <i>TLJ</i>, he wished he hadn\u2019t\nbeen caught off-guard so that \u201c<i>he could have stopped the torpedo\u2014freezing it in\nspace with a thought</i>\u201d (J.F., <i>TLJ</i>).

Just like grandpa. \n\n\n\n<br></p><p>Of course, Ben got his immense Force-sensitivity\nthrough his mother.

And one of my favorite things ever in <i>Star Wars </i>is when he just\nstarts chucking large objects at Luke with the Force during their Bespin duel,\nuntil he breaks that window. Then come the ST, and the very first Force move we\nsee Ben enact is stopping a blaster bolt midair, which was just the <i>first</i> sign\nthat telekinesis is His Thing&trade;. I mean, seeing Force-users easily <i>deflect </i>blaster\nbolts via lightsaber, with form technique and what Qui-Gon would call &ldquo;<i>Jedi reflexes</i>&rdquo;,\nis old hat to long-time fans. But to <i>halt</i> one midair? That is literally somethin else. And Ben\nclaimed that he&rsquo;d also be able to do a much larger-scale version of this when,\nhis wingmate having fired at and hit the Raddus in <i>TLJ</i>, he wished he hadn&rsquo;t\nbeen caught off-guard so that &ldquo;<i>he could have stopped the torpedo&mdash;freezing it in\nspace with a thought</i>&rdquo; (J.F., <i>TLJ</i>). And to be able to do something like <i>that</i>, at\n<i>his</i> age? Yeah, that&rsquo;s not just training. He&rsquo;s a natural. Just like grandpa. \n\n\n\n<br /></p><p>Of course, Ben got his immense Force-sensitivity\nthrough his mother. But while Leia possesses some of her biological father&rsquo;s\npersonality traits&ndash;including a quick temper and a tendency to snarkily comment on people&rsquo;s height,\nor lack thereof&ndash;she did not inherit his predilection for telekinesis. Leia&rsquo;s\nnatural inclinations through the Force lean toward the empathic.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Organa has been shown to possess a\nstrong Force sense.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;After her birth, Organa was left with\na lasting impression of images and feelings of her mother&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;When Skywalker failed to contact\nKenobi while hanging underneath Bespin&rsquo;s Cloud City, weak and helpless, he\ncalled out to Organa with the Force, apparently out of instinct. Organa sensed\nhim and was able to direct the&nbsp;Millennium Falcon&nbsp;to his\nlocation.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;After the second Death Star blew up,\nOrgana assured Solo that Skywalker had not been on it at the time, actively\ndemonstrating the ability to sense her brother&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp;A few days\nlater, she was able to sense the lingering dark presence of Darth Maul in the\nTheed Royal Palace, dating back to his duel against Obi-Wan Kenobi and&nbsp;</i><i>Qui-Gon Jinn</i><i>&nbsp;during the&nbsp;</i><i>Battle of Naboo</i><i> </i>(<i>Shattered Empire, Part\nIII</i>)<i>. She felt a disturbance in the Force when the Hosnian System was destroyed\nby Starkiller Base. She later was able to sense Han Solo&rsquo;s death at the hands\nof their son through the Force while she was present on D'Qar, the event\noccurring on Starkiller Base&rdquo;.&nbsp; </i>&ndash;<a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Leia_Organa\" target=\"_blank\">Wookieepedia, Leia Organa</a></p></blockquote><p>And, mixed with her\nmaternal instinct and the biological connection of pregnancy, she was able to sense\nbaby Ben&rsquo;s impending personality, his gender, his inherent light, and\nSnoke&rsquo;s encroaching presence, when he was still in the womb (<i>Aftermath: Life\nDebt</i> and <i>Empire&rsquo;s End</i>).&nbsp;</p><p>Luke didn&rsquo;t inherit their father&rsquo;s\nnatural telekinetic proficiency, either. He became very good at it&ndash;the hutsplosion may have been \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextra&trade; as all hell, but it <i>was</i> impressive, I&rsquo;ll give him that&ndash;but it took\na lot of work and years of training and gradual development.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;Skywalker surmised on his own that\nthe Force could be used to manipulate matter in the manner of telekinesis and\nmanaged to learn how to move small objects&hellip;&nbsp;</i>(<i>Heir to the Jedi</i>)<i> By the time\nof the Battle of Hoth, Skywalker had the ability to pull his lightsaber to his\nhands, though not without difficulty. Under Yoda&rsquo;s training, this ability was\nfurther developed, enabling him to levitate several objects at once while\nmeditating. At the time of his exile some 30 years later, Luke demonstrated\neven stronger telekinesis&hellip;&rdquo;</i>&nbsp; &ndash;<a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker\" target=\"_blank\">Luke Skywalker, Wookieepedia</a></p></blockquote><p>I do think he got a <i>different</i> natural Force\ninclination from Anakin, though. Dreams and visions.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;[Anakin] Skywalker also showed&nbsp;<b>aptitude\nfor precognitive dreams</b>, as was the case when he foresaw the deaths of both\nhis mother and his wife in dreams, but also of himself becoming a Jedi, back\nwhen he lived with his mother on Tatooine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>&nbsp;&ldquo;[Luke] also demonstrated the <b>ability\nto have visions</b> several times&rdquo;.&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>This happened with him in <i>The Weapon\nof a Jedi</i>, there&rsquo;s his cave vision on Dagobah, as well as the premonition of\nLeia and Han being captured and harmed. Same as with Anakin, these weren&rsquo;t\nthings he was actively <i>trying</i>&nbsp;to see, the Force just showed them to him. Just as\nit did with his AU dream that prologues the <i>Last Jedi</i> novelization.</p><hr /><p>So, back\nto the Skywalker masters of telekinesis. As for Anakin:</p><p>There were the couple times he nonchalantly floated objects around in <i>Attack of the Clones</i>, which he mentioned Obi-Wan wouldn&rsquo;t approve of. In <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>, he inadvertently grief/rage-crushed all the medical equipment in the room after Palpatine told him Padme was dead. Then, in the <i>Darth Vader </i>comic that takes place beginning in this scene, he Force-slammed Palpatine into a wall. Later on&hellip;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;He demonstrated enough telekinetic\npower to stop an AT-AT from stepping on him, and had been in the process of\ntearing it apart before he was interrupted in doing so </i>(<i>SW #2, Skywalker Strikes,\nPart II</i>)<i>. On another occasion he also telekinetically lifted two AT-DP\nwalkers off of himself without any apparent strain&rdquo; </i>(<i>SW Rebels, </i>&ldquo;The Siege of\nLothal&rdquo;)<i>.</i></p></blockquote><p>And reminder, this was when he was Vader,\nso he was half cybernetic at the time.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;He also demonstrated the ability to\ngrab hold of an engine-damaged Twi'lek freighter and bring it to the\nground,&nbsp;and&nbsp;crush a&nbsp;Lambda-class\nshuttle&rsquo;s engines in mid-flight&nbsp;to take it down </i>(<i>Lords of the Sith; DV #15, Vader Down, Part IV</i>)<i>.&nbsp;He was able to utilize a Force push that was\npowerful enough to blow apart numerous lyleks simultaneously, despite the fact\nthat the creatures&rsquo; carapaces were impervious to even heavy blaster fire </i>(<i>LotS</i>)<i>.\n&hellip;On at least one occasion, he demonstrated that he was&nbsp;able to telekinetically manipulate objects\nwithout the<b> </b>need to gesture at them<b>&nbsp;</b>as virtually all\nother Force adepts did.

He licked the slit with a satisfied sound.</p><p>Not all clones were identical down there: the size was\nroughly the same for all of them, of course, but here too, they loved to\nexpress their individuality, let it be in piercings or playing with razors. </p><p>Longshot had no tattoo, his hairs were simply cut\nshort without anything fancy, but here&hellip;Bare, and it was always fun when he gave\nObi-Wan the razor and his trust, and pierced in the foreskin, a very small\nthing, in the colour of the 212<sup>th</sup>. </p><p>Obi-Wan wanted to purr when Longshot petted his hair,\ndespite his promises to not touch.</p><p>How could Longshot resist? The colour was more vivid\nthan usual, the undertones of red more present than usual, because they had had\nseveral assignations to desert worlds before that horrible mission to Lola\nSayu. He licked the entire shaft a few times, kissed the head and ran his tongue\non the slit, then went to play with the piercing, teasing his lover.</p><p>&ldquo;Open for me, cyare&rdquo;\ngrowled Longshot, as avid as Obi-Wan to reaffirm he was alive, and Obi-Wan made\na show from it, his eyes burning as he observed the vod and the effects of his\nefforts. Longshot fisted his hands in his hair, just shy of hurting, just\nenough for Obi-Wan too feel it, and he mewled in answer around his mouthful as\nhe let Longshot guide him lower, lower&hellip; </p><p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; said Longshot, &ldquo;Stars, the view you make.\nIf you could see&hellip;Sucking me off, your lips stretched and those eyes burning&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>His hips rose of the bed despite themselves and he\ngrimaced, the pain of electrocution sill present. Obi-Wan had sensed it and his\ngrip on his hips made itself stronger, keeping them in check.</p><p>He worshiped Longshot&rsquo;s cock, there was no other words\nfor it, using every trick of his very complete catalogue, his tongue, his lips,\nhis throat and his hands would probably leave small bruises on his lover&rsquo;s\nhips. </p><p>But Longshot was alive, alive, and Obi-Wan expressed\nhis joy at it the only way he let himself. A last time, he took the entire\nshaft in his throat and he heard the tell-tale groan of his lover. He let go of\nalmost the entire sex, keeping only the head in his mouth, and he swallowed eagerly,\nletting only the last spurt paint his lips and beard, because that always made\nthe vode crazy to see him marked that way. </p><p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; Longshot whispered when he could again\ntell which direction was up, and Obi-Wan obeyed, almost trembling from desire,\nexhaustion of the last days, and joy. </p><p>Longshot opened his pants, despite his protestations\nthat it wasn&rsquo;t necessary, and pushed his hand inside. </p><p>Obi-Wan groaned against his mouth. Longshot wasn&rsquo;t the\nonly one to suffer from insomnia, but after that, he was sure the two of them\nwould sleep like shinies. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to see you come. That&rsquo;s it, Obi-Wan, our Jedi,\nour cyare. Fuck my fist. I want to see you make a mess. Pretty sure the medics\nwill yell at us later, make it count. That&rsquo;s it, cyare.&rdquo;</p><p>And Obi-Wan whined and came, without thinking of the\nstate of his pants and his tunics. It didn&rsquo;t matter. Because for another day,\nthis vod, this man he loved, was alive. </p>",
