The stories are automatically posted here from the AO3 RSS feed using an IFTTT recipe, but this was made easy thanks to astolat (astolat.tumblr.com). If you would like to set up a similar blog, see the instructions tab :) To check announcements regarding these blogs, go to the tumblr tag #ao3feed announcement.

Steve slid\nback down to join her, wrapping his arm around her shoulders and pulling her\nclose to him.

He\nbit his lip, considering that maybe he should have kept what he\u2019d seen a secret.\n</p><p>It was still early, so most of the Avengers were still\nasleep. However, this was not the case when Tony went bellowing around the\ncompound. \u201cHey, Capsicle! You wanna come out here?\u201d he yelled, making his way\ndown the corridor towards Cap\u2019s bedroom. Bruce opened his door and looked\naround, confused. Natasha appeared behind him soon after. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nshe yawned, rubbing her eyes. </p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s on a rampage. Guessing he found out about (Y/N) and\nSteve,\u201d Bruce responded. </p><p>Tony whipped around and charged at Bruce. \u201cYou knew about\nthis?\u201d he spat in the scientist\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cHey, calm down,\u201d Nat held her hand up, \u201cWe don\u2019t need the\nother guy making an appearance.\u201d </p><p>Tony backed up and continued his pursuit of Steve. \u201cI\u2019ll deal\nwith you later,\u201d he called over his shoulder. </p><p>He reached Steve\u2019s bedroom door and hammered on it with his\nfist. Without waiting for a response, he kicked the door open. Steve sat up\njust in time to see Tony advancing. He jumped back out of his bed. \u201cWoah! What\u2019s\ngoing on?\u201d</p><p>Tony pinned Cap against the wall, his forearm pushing against\nhis neck. \u201cYou know exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d </p><p>At this point, Tony\u2019s outburst had drawn the attention of\nthe rest of the Avengers. They crowded around the door. Thor and Clint pushed\ntheir way through to split apart the two men. (Y/N) was late to the party,\nentering the room to see her dad and boyfriend being restrained. </p><p>\u201cOh god,\u201d she whispered. It wasn\u2019t quiet enough. Tony struggled\nin Thor\u2019s tight hold when he heard (Y/N)\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cLet me go, Thor.\u201d The god did as he was told. Tony turned\nto face his daughter. \u201cPete told me something interesting this morning, said he\nsaw the two of you,\u201d he gestured between (Y/N) and Steve, \u201cdoing \u2018stuff\u2019 last night\nin the training room.\u201d He paused, his eyes boring into Steve\u2019s. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>(Y/N) slowly nodded. </p><p>\u201cHow long\u2019s this been going on for?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbout a year,\u201d Steve dared to speak up. </p><p>Tony rubbed his forehead, sighing. \u201cI have nothing more to\nsay, for now. But,\u201d he pointed at (Y/N), \u201ctell your mother.\u201d (Y/N) nodded and\nTony left the room, followed by the Avengers. They went back to whatever they\nwere doing before the drama, leaving just (Y/N) and Steve. </p><p>\u201cLooks like the secret is out,\u201d Steve said. He said on the\nedge of the bed, gesturing for (Y/N) to join him. She shook her head. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t right now. Dad\u2019s right, I need to talk to Mum.\u201d She\nplanted a gentle kiss on his lips before leaving for Stark Tower. </p><p>~</p><p>\u201cSo, she has a boyfriend? Isn\u2019t that a good thing? She\u2019s socialising,\nafter an entire life hidden, I thought it would be near to impossible for her\nto just fit back into society,\u201d Pepper reasoned with her husband as he paced\nabout the lab. </p><p>\u201cShe kept this a secret for a year, Pep! A year! We raised\nher, kept her safe and she\u2019s keeping secrets.\u201d With one angry sweep of his arm,\nhe pushed a load of test tubes and papers off of the nearest table. Pepper\njumped back, as glass shattered everywhere. </p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d (Y/N) appeared at the door. She was biting her nails,\nan old habit she hadn\u2019t succeeded in giving up. </p><p>\u201cHey sweetie,\u201d Pepper beamed, giving her daughter a hug. \u201cYour\nfather is in a mood. Why don\u2019t we go have a girly chat?\u201d she whispered in (Y/N)\u2019s\near. </p><p>~</p><p>They sat on the sofa, sipping at hot chocolate and looking\nout over the city. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Pepper said, at last, \u201cYou at Captain America? How\nvery rebellious of you.\u201d She smiled. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it just kinda happened\u2026\u201d (Y/N) muttered. She knew\nPepper wouldn\u2019t react the same as Tony had, but she was still nervous. </p><p>Pepper put down her mug and leaned over to (Y/N). she\nsqueezed her arm, \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, darling. Ignore your dad, he\u2019s just being\nover-protective.\u201d (Y/N) managed a half of a smile. It was hard enough\ntransitioning into being an Avenger and suddenly being in the public eye, but\nhaving Tony mad at her was something she didn\u2019t needed. Pepper noticed the\nworry in (Y/N)\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe\u2019ll come around. Go home. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have calmed\ndown a little by tomorrow. I\u2019ll have words,\u201d she winked. \u201cI\u2019ll call the driver,\nhe\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d (Y/N) said, \u201cSteve is coming to get me.\u201d</p><p>Pepper laughed, \u201cFor god\u2019s sake don\u2019t let Tony see.\u201d </p><p><b>\u00a0Tag List: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNTQjpqRUNopo6NmS5i3k-A\">@edwisenpai</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mini5uVfVCqBnof0UcwKFJg\">@chibiyanai</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOSsIZ1m_cTzgtiGD3HQIzw\">@alphaaddict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBTp6Rnu9xpsPHmAX-3TtPg\">@this-is-happening</a></b></p>",

You wanna come out here?\u201d he yelled, making his way\ndown the corridor towards Cap\u2019s bedroom. Bruce opened his door and looked\naround, confused. Natasha appeared behind him soon after. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nshe yawned, rubbing her eyes. </p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s on a rampage. Guessing he found out about (Y/N) and\nSteve,\u201d Bruce responded. </p><p>Tony whipped around and charged at Bruce. \u201cYou knew about\nthis?\u201d he spat in the scientist\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cHey, calm down,\u201d Nat held her hand up, \u201cWe don\u2019t need the\nother guy making an appearance.\u201d </p><p>Tony backed up and continued his pursuit of Steve. \u201cI\u2019ll deal\nwith you later,\u201d he called over his shoulder. </p><p>He reached Steve\u2019s bedroom door and hammered on it with his\nfist. Without waiting for a response, he kicked the door open. Steve sat up\njust in time to see Tony advancing. He jumped back out of his bed. \u201cWoah! What\u2019s\ngoing on?\u201d</p><p>Tony pinned Cap against the wall, his forearm pushing against\nhis neck. \u201cYou know exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d </p><p>At this point, Tony\u2019s outburst had drawn the attention of\nthe rest of the Avengers. They crowded around the door. Thor and Clint pushed\ntheir way through to split apart the two men. (Y/N) was late to the party,\nentering the room to see her dad and boyfriend being restrained. </p><p>\u201cOh god,\u201d she whispered. It wasn\u2019t quiet enough. Tony struggled\nin Thor\u2019s tight hold when he heard (Y/N)\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cLet me go, Thor.\u201d The god did as he was told. Tony turned\nto face his daughter. \u201cPete told me something interesting this morning, said he\nsaw the two of you,\u201d he gestured between (Y/N) and Steve, \u201cdoing \u2018stuff\u2019 last night\nin the training room.\u201d He paused, his eyes boring into Steve\u2019s. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>(Y/N) slowly nodded. </p><p>\u201cHow long\u2019s this been going on for?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbout a year,\u201d Steve dared to speak up. </p><p>Tony rubbed his forehead, sighing. \u201cI have nothing more to\nsay, for now. But,\u201d he pointed at (Y/N), \u201ctell your mother.\u201d (Y/N) nodded and\nTony left the room, followed by the Avengers. They went back to whatever they\nwere doing before the drama, leaving just (Y/N) and Steve. </p><p>\u201cLooks like the secret is out,\u201d Steve said. He said on the\nedge of the bed, gesturing for (Y/N) to join him. She shook her head. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t right now. Dad\u2019s right, I need to talk to Mum.\u201d She\nplanted a gentle kiss on his lips before leaving for Stark Tower. </p><p>~</p><p>\u201cSo, she has a boyfriend? Isn\u2019t that a good thing? She\u2019s socialising,\nafter an entire life hidden, I thought it would be near to impossible for her\nto just fit back into society,\u201d Pepper reasoned with her husband as he paced\nabout the lab. </p><p>\u201cShe kept this a secret for a year, Pep! A year! We raised\nher, kept her safe and she\u2019s keeping secrets.\u201d With one angry sweep of his arm,\nhe pushed a load of test tubes and papers off of the nearest table. Pepper\njumped back, as glass shattered everywhere. </p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d (Y/N) appeared at the door. She was biting her nails,\nan old habit she hadn\u2019t succeeded in giving up. </p><p>\u201cHey sweetie,\u201d Pepper beamed, giving her daughter a hug. \u201cYour\nfather is in a mood. Why don\u2019t we go have a girly chat?\u201d she whispered in (Y/N)\u2019s\near. </p><p>~</p><p>They sat on the sofa, sipping at hot chocolate and looking\nout over the city. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Pepper said, at last, \u201cYou at Captain America? How\nvery rebellious of you.\u201d She smiled. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it just kinda happened\u2026\u201d (Y/N) muttered. She knew\nPepper wouldn\u2019t react the same as Tony had, but she was still nervous. </p><p>Pepper put down her mug and leaned over to (Y/N). she\nsqueezed her arm, \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, darling. Ignore your dad, he\u2019s just being\nover-protective.\u201d (Y/N) managed a half of a smile. It was hard enough\ntransitioning into being an Avenger and suddenly being in the public eye, but\nhaving Tony mad at her was something she didn\u2019t needed. Pepper noticed the\nworry in (Y/N)\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe\u2019ll come around. Go home. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have calmed\ndown a little by tomorrow. I\u2019ll have words,\u201d she winked. \u201cI\u2019ll call the driver,\nhe\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d (Y/N) said, \u201cSteve is coming to get me.\u201d</p><p>Pepper laughed, \u201cFor god\u2019s sake don\u2019t let Tony see.\u201d </p><p><b>\u00a0Tag List: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNTQjpqRUNopo6NmS5i3k-A\">@edwisenpai</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mini5uVfVCqBnof0UcwKFJg\">@chibiyanai</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOSsIZ1m_cTzgtiGD3HQIzw\">@alphaaddict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBTp6Rnu9xpsPHmAX-3TtPg\">@this-is-happening</a></b></p>",

(Y/N) looked\nup and scowled at him, which he met with a wink. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Steve got to his feet, holding a hand out for\n(Y/N), &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to bed. We can deal with Stark in the morning.&rdquo; </p><p>(Y/N) groaned again and took his hand. She let herself be led\nfrom the room. </p><p>~</p><p>Tony willed it not to be true. &ldquo;Can you repeat that again,\nSpidey.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter stood in front of him, looking extremely embarrassed. &ldquo;I&hellip;\numm&hellip; I saw (Y/N) and the Captain in the gym and they were&hellip; umm&hellip; they were\nkissing and&hellip; stuff.&rdquo; </p><p>The billionaire didn&rsquo;t wait to hear anymore. He stormed out\nof the kitchen, slamming the door behind him. This was not the news he wanted\nto wake up to. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought you should know,&rdquo; Peter called after his boss. He\nbit his lip, considering that maybe he should have kept what he&rsquo;d seen a secret.\n</p><p>It was still early, so most of the Avengers were still\nasleep. However, this was not the case when Tony went bellowing around the\ncompound. &ldquo;Hey, Capsicle! You wanna come out here?&rdquo; he yelled, making his way\ndown the corridor towards Cap&rsquo;s bedroom. Bruce opened his door and looked\naround, confused. Natasha appeared behind him soon after. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;\nshe yawned, rubbing her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s on a rampage. Guessing he found out about (Y/N) and\nSteve,&rdquo; Bruce responded. </p><p>Tony whipped around and charged at Bruce. &ldquo;You knew about\nthis?&rdquo; he spat in the scientist&rsquo;s face. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, calm down,&rdquo; Nat held her hand up, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need the\nother guy making an appearance.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony backed up and continued his pursuit of Steve. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deal\nwith you later,&rdquo; he called over his shoulder. </p><p>He reached Steve&rsquo;s bedroom door and hammered on it with his\nfist. Without waiting for a response, he kicked the door open. Steve sat up\njust in time to see Tony advancing. He jumped back out of his bed. &ldquo;Woah! What&rsquo;s\ngoing on?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony pinned Cap against the wall, his forearm pushing against\nhis neck. &ldquo;You know exactly what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; </p><p>At this point, Tony&rsquo;s outburst had drawn the attention of\nthe rest of the Avengers. They crowded around the door. Thor and Clint pushed\ntheir way through to split apart the two men. (Y/N) was late to the party,\nentering the room to see her dad and boyfriend being restrained. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh god,&rdquo; she whispered. It wasn&rsquo;t quiet enough. Tony struggled\nin Thor&rsquo;s tight hold when he heard (Y/N)&rsquo;s voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Let me go, Thor.&rdquo; The god did as he was told. Tony turned\nto face his daughter. &ldquo;Pete told me something interesting this morning, said he\nsaw the two of you,&rdquo; he gestured between (Y/N) and Steve, &ldquo;doing &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; last night\nin the training room.&rdquo; He paused, his eyes boring into Steve&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo;</p><p>(Y/N) slowly nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;How long&rsquo;s this been going on for?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;About a year,&rdquo; Steve dared to speak up. </p><p>Tony rubbed his forehead, sighing. &ldquo;I have nothing more to\nsay, for now. But,&rdquo; he pointed at (Y/N), &ldquo;tell your mother.&rdquo; (Y/N) nodded and\nTony left the room, followed by the Avengers. They went back to whatever they\nwere doing before the drama, leaving just (Y/N) and Steve. </p><p>&ldquo;Looks like the secret is out,&rdquo; Steve said. He said on the\nedge of the bed, gesturing for (Y/N) to join him. She shook her head. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t right now. Dad&rsquo;s right, I need to talk to Mum.&rdquo; She\nplanted a gentle kiss on his lips before leaving for Stark Tower. </p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;So, she has a boyfriend? Isn&rsquo;t that a good thing? She&rsquo;s socialising,\nafter an entire life hidden, I thought it would be near to impossible for her\nto just fit back into society,&rdquo; Pepper reasoned with her husband as he paced\nabout the lab. </p><p>&ldquo;She kept this a secret for a year, Pep! A year! We raised\nher, kept her safe and she&rsquo;s keeping secrets.&rdquo; With one angry sweep of his arm,\nhe pushed a load of test tubes and papers off of the nearest table. Pepper\njumped back, as glass shattered everywhere. </p><p>&ldquo;Dad?&rdquo; (Y/N) appeared at the door. She was biting her nails,\nan old habit she hadn&rsquo;t succeeded in giving up. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey sweetie,&rdquo; Pepper beamed, giving her daughter a hug. &ldquo;Your\nfather is in a mood. Why don&rsquo;t we go have a girly chat?&rdquo; she whispered in (Y/N)&rsquo;s\near. </p><p>~</p><p>They sat on the sofa, sipping at hot chocolate and looking\nout over the city. </p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Pepper said, at last, &ldquo;You at Captain America? How\nvery rebellious of you.&rdquo; She smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it just kinda happened&hellip;&rdquo; (Y/N) muttered. She knew\nPepper wouldn&rsquo;t react the same as Tony had, but she was still nervous. </p><p>Pepper put down her mug and leaned over to (Y/N). she\nsqueezed her arm, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy for you, darling. Ignore your dad, he&rsquo;s just being\nover-protective.&rdquo; (Y/N) managed a half of a smile. It was hard enough\ntransitioning into being an Avenger and suddenly being in the public eye, but\nhaving Tony mad at her was something she didn&rsquo;t needed. Pepper noticed the\nworry in (Y/N)&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come around. Go home. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll have calmed\ndown a little by tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll have words,&rdquo; she winked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call the driver,\nhe&rsquo;ll take you home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; (Y/N) said, &ldquo;Steve is coming to get me.&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper laughed, &ldquo;For god&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t let Tony see.&rdquo; </p><p><b>&nbsp;Tag List: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNTQjpqRUNopo6NmS5i3k-A\">@edwisenpai</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mini5uVfVCqBnof0UcwKFJg\">@chibiyanai</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOSsIZ1m_cTzgtiGD3HQIzw\">@alphaaddict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBTp6Rnu9xpsPHmAX-3TtPg\">@this-is-happening</a></b></p>",

A lot had changed since that day. </p>\n<p>Just as Tony had hoped, Wanda and Vision had taken (Y/N) under\ntheir wing. They became like second parents to her. This didn&rsquo;t bother either\nTony nor Pepper, as Wanda and Vision understood (Y/N)&rsquo;s powers better than they\never could. Wanda taught the younger girl how to control her abilities and how\nto use them for good. However, she still hadn&rsquo;t experienced a battle, so hadn&rsquo;t\nhad the chance to test her skills. Tony was secretly pleased. He still saw his\ndaughter as the sweet, innocent child he needed to protect. He was completely\nunaware of just how strong she was, but also about a certain other Avenger she\nhad grown particularly fond of. </p>\n</p>",

They took her from her mother the second she was out of the womb, killed the mother afterwards.</h2><h2>Since then, she has been injected, probed, cut, and put back together, over and over again. She was then proclaimed as the youngest out of many of HYDRA&rsquo;s assassin.</h2><p><b>Warning:</b> Violence, mentions of blood and torture</p><h2>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</h2><p>Screams of terror.</p><p>That\u2019s all you\u2019re familiar to. Whether it\u2019s someone else\u2019s or your own.  Sixteen  years of your life was filled with it. You may be young but your soul was anything but that, it was dead, for as long as you can remember.</p><p>You watched as the middle aged man fell limp in front of you, terror filled his eyes, open but lifeless. Fresh blood was still pouring from the open slash on his neck. </p><p><i>Just another casuality of a much bigger war</i>, you thought as you slipped your knife back to it\u2019s holster. You turned around to leave the scene, stepping over a few more dead bodies on your way. </p><p>Digging for information was never really your thing, you were more of the \u2018shoot first ask questions later\u2019 type of person, that was what your Creators taught you. </p><p>So far the only information you had was that The Winter Soldier is now living at The Avengers HQ. Not that you didn\u2019t already know that, but you can\u2019t just go and attack a building filled with superhumans and is designed to keep villains out. You needed a better plan and that plan is still yet to be made.</p><p>So here you were, coming up to anyone your Creators believed had any connection of any kind to the Avengers, and whether they don\u2019t tell you what you need to know or they do, you kill them. It\u2019s been like that for almost a year now. And no one ever told you what you needed to know. Well until now.</p><p>You had received information that in two days a GALA ball will be held by Stark Industries, and the Avengers were going to be there. It was a fairly public event, as long as you know someone who knows someone, you\u2019ll get in.</p><p>You went back to your base, reported your findings to your Creators and soon you were told what your next move would be. You were to attend the event along with them. </p><p>One a man, a soldier that goes by the name of Stanislav. The other one was a woman, Tatyana, a scientist who worked both on you and The Winter Soldier. Hoping that the magical mantra would be able to turn the good Bucky Barnes back to the evil Winter Soldier without causing too much commotion. They \u2013along with you, were the only bits of HYDRA left after the destruction.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>As the driver pulled up to the venue, you braced yourself for the amount of people present. Even from afar you can hear how loud it was, and when you were finally there you saw dozens of reporters, cameramen, and the flashes of their cameras bring back memories. Not good ones of course.</p><p><i>Your small frame was curled up in to a ball in the corner of your cell. Another sleepless night had passed and you were once again faced by the horrifying reality.</i></p><p><i>The metal door opened with a bang, making you flinch as a few tears run down your face. </i></p><p><i>\u201cGet up.\u201d The man said in Russian, one out of twenty two languages you had managed to cram inside your three year old brain.</i></p><p><i>When you didn\u2019t budge, he picked you up with ease. You didn\u2019t even fight, you knew there was no use. On the way to the examination room, you passed a glass cell where a man sat solemnly. He was the only person you\u2019ve ever seen aside from the soldiers and the scientists. You knew he was neither of them, or at least he didn\u2019t look like one.</i></p><p><i>The star imprinted on his metal arm fascinates your somewhat innocent brain for a reason you didn\u2019t know. You stared at the star and caught his eyes, he was staring back at you for a couple of seconds before he went out of your line of sight.</i></p><p><i>The man carrying you stepped in to a sickeningly clean white room and strapped you in a chair. You whined and sobbed but he only gave you a disgusted look.</i></p><p><i>\u201cGood morning, child,\u201d said a woman from the other side of the room, your \u2018Doctor\u2019. \u201cReady for today?\u201d</i></p><p><i>The man put another strap over your mouth, you bite in to it out of instinct. You struggled to break free, the strap muffled your screams of protest. Just then the machine turned on, the blinding light in front of you flashes in a pattern that changes everyday, the seat started to shake as your small body was shocked with electricity just below the rate where it will kill you. You cried, and cried, but it was no use. </i></p><p>By the time you really snapped out of your trance, you were already inside the venue. You\u2019ve never been in the middle of this much people before, it feels weird. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t long until the three of you spotted the Avengers bunch in the VIP Lounge. Your Creators entered the VIP Lounge with ease as you were told to stay put and be on alert. And as always, you complied.</p><p>The plan was to separate Barnes from the others, or at least most of them. How? You weren\u2019t told, so it was not your problem. You were only told to chime in if the situation gets out of hand.</p><p>Just then you heard a crash followed by shouting. Seems like the situation just got out of hand. </p><p>You acted quickly and jumped over the gate to the lounge and you saw the Winter Soldier out cold, not far from him was Tatyana, reciting the trigger words. A few meters away was a man you recognized as The Falcon, fighting his way to get to his friend, but without his suit he was  struggling to win over the armed former HYDRA soldier.</p><p>The other Avengers were no where in sight, but it won\u2019t be long until they get here. You must act fast.</p><p>You went to take on The Falcon and signalled to Stanislav to go help with Barnes. As you stood in front of the man, he was already out of breath with bruises on his face. He looked confused as to why a child was in front of him in the middle of this dangerous situation.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d He asked.</p><p>You didn\u2019t answer, instead you pushed him back against a wall. He struggled on your grasp but you didn\u2019t let go. You melted a piece of window railing in your reach, burning your glove and exposing your vibranium arm in process.

You were to attend the event along with them. </p><p>One a man, a soldier that goes by the name of Stanislav.

Not good ones of course.</p><p><i>Your small frame was curled up in to a ball in the corner of your cell. Another sleepless night had passed and you were once again faced by the horrifying reality.</i></p><p><i>The metal door opened with a bang, making you flinch as a few tears run down your face. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Get up.&rdquo; The man said in Russian, one out of twenty two languages you had managed to cram inside your three year old brain.</i></p><p><i>When you didn&rsquo;t budge, he picked you up with ease. You didn&rsquo;t even fight, you knew there was no use. On the way to the examination room, you passed a glass cell where a man sat solemnly. He was the only person you&rsquo;ve ever seen aside from the soldiers and the scientists. You knew he was neither of them, or at least he didn&rsquo;t look like one.</i></p><p><i>The star imprinted on his metal arm fascinates your somewhat innocent brain for a reason you didn&rsquo;t know. You stared at the star and caught his eyes, he was staring back at you for a couple of seconds before he went out of your line of sight.</i></p><p><i>The man carrying you stepped in to a sickeningly clean white room and strapped you in a chair. You whined and sobbed but he only gave you a disgusted look.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Good morning, child,&rdquo; said a woman from the other side of the room, your &lsquo;Doctor&rsquo;. &ldquo;Ready for today?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The man put another strap over your mouth, you bite in to it out of instinct. You struggled to break free, the strap muffled your screams of protest. Just then the machine turned on, the blinding light in front of you flashes in a pattern that changes everyday, the seat started to shake as your small body was shocked with electricity just below the rate where it will kill you. You cried, and cried, but it was no use. </i></p><p>By the time you really snapped out of your trance, you were already inside the venue. You&rsquo;ve never been in the middle of this much people before, it feels weird. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t long until the three of you spotted the Avengers bunch in the VIP Lounge. Your Creators entered the VIP Lounge with ease as you were told to stay put and be on alert. And as always, you complied.</p><p>The plan was to separate Barnes from the others, or at least most of them. How? You weren&rsquo;t told, so it was not your problem. You were only told to chime in if the situation gets out of hand.</p><p>Just then you heard a crash followed by shouting. Seems like the situation just got out of hand. </p><p>You acted quickly and jumped over the gate to the lounge and you saw the Winter Soldier out cold, not far from him was Tatyana, reciting the trigger words. A few meters away was a man you recognized as The Falcon, fighting his way to get to his friend, but without his suit he was  struggling to win over the armed former HYDRA soldier.</p><p>The other Avengers were no where in sight, but it won&rsquo;t be long until they get here. You must act fast.</p><p>You went to take on The Falcon and signalled to Stanislav to go help with Barnes. As you stood in front of the man, he was already out of breath with bruises on his face. He looked confused as to why a child was in front of him in the middle of this dangerous situation.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t answer, instead you pushed him back against a wall. He struggled on your grasp but you didn&rsquo;t let go. You melted a piece of window railing in your reach, burning your glove and exposing your vibranium arm in process. You stuck his hand in to the scorching hot metal and he screamed in pain. You held it in place as the metal turned back cold and hard, locking the hero&rsquo;s hand along with it.</p><p>By the time you were done with him and you spun around, your two Creators were no where to be seen and so was The Winter Soldier. Instead, about half of the Earth&rsquo;s mightiest heroes came swarming the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Sam!&rdquo; One of them shouted, Captain America.</p><p>You felt like a trapped animal, ready to attack. You ripped the remaining fabric of your dress&rsquo; sleeves to make it easier to move as you eyed your opponents. The vibranium arms you&rsquo;ve had for the last six years caught the eyes of the heroes in front of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, shit.&rdquo; Another man remarked upon seeing your arms, a suitless Iron Man.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; The Black Widow asked.</p><p>Again, you didn&rsquo;t answer. You attacked, like what you were trained to do. The closest to you was The Black Widow, it was fairly easy for you to win over her if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact it was a four versus one fight. </p><p>Just when you got her in a choke hold, seconds away from breaking her neck, Iron Man threw you off of Romanoff as his suit attached itself to him, you flew and hit the wall leaving a dent, but you weren&rsquo;t phased at all. </p><p>Captain America turned his attention from helping Wilson to you, leaving Vision to try and get him out. At the same time, Iron Man was also approaching. You avoided him just by a few inches and grabbed on to his suit, getting your powers to the maximum level in order to melt the metal.</p><p>&ldquo;This is bringing back bad memories,&rdquo; you heard him comment as the suit started to crumble under your fingers.</p><p>On your right you saw Captain America running towards you with shield in hand, you threw Iron Man towards him, sending both backwards from the impact. </p><p>Just then, you saw an open way to a window, that was your chance to take your leave. You started to bolt to the window but Vision shot his laser just a foot away from you. </p><p>You jumped at him, trying to get him to set foot and it worked. As soon as he landed you tried to melt whatever that thing was on his forehead that shoots laser.</p><p>You haven&rsquo;t even touched the yellow stone when you felt someone creeping up behind you. You turned to be greeted by Scarlet Witch, who was not present before. You were about to attack when she put her hand on your forehead sending you deep in to sleep.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://nagaindcsiar.tumblr.com/post/177373980026/subject-302-avengers-x-youngassassinreader\">Part 2</a> </b></p></p>",
