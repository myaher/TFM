I hope you guys enjoy :)</b></i></p><hr><p>Tyrion made a point to go to his rooms first before heading to breakfast. He didn&rsquo;t want Daenerys to be the last one there\u2014he&rsquo;d pull the attention to himself so not to illicit questions in her direction. So when he closed his bedroom door, he went to his own bottle of wine and swirled it around his mouth to scent his breath and to calm his nerves.<br/></p><p>Cersei&rsquo;s pregnant. Daenerys may be pregnant. Two queens hell-bent on winning this war with a Mother&rsquo;s ferocity. <i>Oh, the bloodshed</i>.</p><!-- more --><p>He adjusted his garb and forced himself to make leisurely to breakfast. The grey morning with her foggy cloak made him grimace, but he stopped to look out anyway, if only to give the queen more time.</p><p>Two more days and they should be in Winterfell. <i>Gods</i>, it&rsquo;s been so long since he&rsquo;d been there. Hopefully no one tried to kill them\u2026</p><p>How will Winterfell be after all the tragedy had torn through them? So much death done by southern rulers that he feared the citizens wouldn&rsquo;t accept a foreigner, a Mad-King&rsquo;s daughter at that, as their possible queen.</p><p>What if Dany&rsquo;s really pregnant? But what if she&rsquo;s not pregnant and she ends up going mad because of it?</p><p>He bit the inside of his cheek until his eyes filled. Oh, he&rsquo;s messed this up truly. He thought of the promise he made to Cersei, his only sister who birthed two beautiful children, to her unborn child.</p><p>Now, he&rsquo;ll have to betray her, because if Daenerys is or ever does have children, it&rsquo;ll be a miracle one. Whoever it is would probably conquer the world.</p><p>If she&rsquo;s truly pregnant, he thought, I&rsquo;ll have to tell her sooner rather than later.</p><p><i>Gods</i>, why did he lie in the first place? He shook his head, his shaggy hair whipping in the wind. If he was being honest, he didn&rsquo;t want the Queen to do anything rash. Like burn Cersei and her unborn child.</p><p>He stood on his toes for a moment to watch the sea. His calf muscles clenched and unclenched; it wasn&rsquo;t right\u2014the things he thinks his queen to be capable of. Dany&rsquo;s impulsive, yes, but not a true murderer. This is a mother and child on the line. She wouldn't\u2026</p><p>Granted the mother is his merciless, cold-blooded killer-sister who actually birthed a demon incarnate. Tyrion still thought of Joffery&rsquo;s death as one of his best memories.</p><p>Alright, he&rsquo;ll have to tell her before they land. How he&rsquo;ll muster up the courage, he didn&rsquo;t know. But his loyalty was with her, and the new world she promised.</p><hr><p>Daenerys giggled while facing the best mirror they could find on the ship. She didn&rsquo;t mind for in its reflection she could see her dearest friend laugh. How could she actually be happy at a time like this? She sighed, touching the amethysts encrusting the bodice of her dress. Thankfully, a thick liner of fur saved the inside from being itchy.</p><p>Missandei laid her chin on Dany&rsquo;s shoulder and held her hand, giving her fingers a squeeze.</p><p>&ldquo;You are most beautiful when you smile, khalessi.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany smiled wider. &ldquo;Why do you continue to call me by my old titles?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it forever, I promise,&rdquo; she answered, breaking eye contact for a moment, &ldquo;but surrounded by your enemies is the perfect time to remember where you came from. Where you have been.&rdquo; Missandei went to her trunks and pulled out a beautiful grey and black coat. Dany sighed into it. The extra layer felt like a hug.</p><p>Dany turned toward her friend. &ldquo;I could never forget.&rdquo;</p><p>A smile lingered on Miss&rsquo; lips, but it was sad. &ldquo;I know. These are just different lands\u2026 this is a game for these people.&rdquo; Dany nodded, thinking of Cersei&rsquo;s complete disregard for the Other&rsquo;s at the Dragon Pit. The woman saw the rotted, snapping teeth at her throat and chose to let them die. Until Tyrion talked with her.. whatever he said must have shaken her enough to fight with them. Unless he made some sort of deal.</p><p>&ldquo;My whole life has been leading up to this\u2014training me to be best at this silly game. Even my brother,&rdquo; Dany huffed and sat down slowly in a chair, &ldquo;he trained me to be silent and observant. When that no longer served me, I learned from Drogo to be merciless, to be a khalessi.&rdquo; She looked up to her friend, who looked like she was about to cry. &ldquo;When you call me that, it shoots fire through me. The word reminds me of who I was, yes, but do I continue to be it even though the people here are so different?&rdquo;</p><p>Missandei knelt down and gently grasped Dany&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I was scared when you came to my city,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;but you made real change. You were compassionate, and fierce, and a sad but fearful Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains. You are what they say, Queen Daenerys. But you are so, so much more. You are a savior, my friend.&rdquo; Her eyes glimmered with brindled fire. Dany knew Miss wasn&rsquo;t just speaking politics. This was now life or death. &ldquo;Save these people.&rdquo;</p><p>A light knock of the cabin door made the women jump into each other before they burst out laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;We only have a day or two more of normalcy. Let&rsquo;s enjoy it while we can,&rdquo; Dany suggested as Missandei went to get the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes? Oh\u2014&rdquo; Dany heard Miss say to whoever was at the door. When she looked over her shoulder, heat spread to her cheeks. &ldquo;King Jon, good morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon grinned at Missandei, glanced at Dany, then looked down sheepishly. &ldquo;Good morning. My apologies for the interruption, but I was hoping to escort the Queen and her Lady to the breakfast hall.&rdquo;</p><p>Miss looked over to her Queen, eye widening. Dany nodded with a growing smile and lifted herself from the chair, stepping closer to her guest. &ldquo;Please come in from the cold while Missandei gathers her coat. How are your rooms?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon stepped inside and closed the door, keeping his hands clasped in front of him. &ldquo;Pretty drab compared to yours, my Queen.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Delicious</i> is all she could think whenever Jon licked his lips after my Queen. How could a man do such things to her? She wanted to run over and taste his lips herself. She adjusted her dress instead.</p><p>Missandei interrupted Dany&rsquo;s thoughts, thankfully by walking to the door already cloaked. How can every other one of her thoughts be of his lips?</p><p>With Missandei&rsquo;s back was to them, Jon captured her fingers in his. Her breath caught in her throat. <i>This man will be the death of me</i>.</p><p>The cold air pierced her lungs as soon as she breathed again, reminding her of just two nights ago. Was it really just the other night? Memories of the Wight Hunt sent tears stinging in her eyes. That was the one of the worst days of her life, and the air was a constant reminder of the child she lost. Ice slashed at her face as she had looked back to see Viscerion sinking into the frozen, broken lake while Jon stood, deserted in that godsforsaken place.</p><p>Jon must have noticed her shoulders slightly droop because he tugged her hand to his chest and kissed her fingers. Wings fluttered below her heart, curling a tail lovingly around her ribs. She stood a little straighter, and tried to step a little closer, but Missandei was already gesturing for them forwards. Dany moved her hand to Jon&rsquo;s elbow and he led them out towards breakfast.</p><p>&ldquo;This cold is getting out of hand,&rdquo; Dany began shielding her eyes away from the wind.</p><p>Jon covered her hand with his. &ldquo;Ah, this is only in the morning. By the sun&rsquo;s rise, the winds simmer, but we won&rsquo;t see our sun for a long while.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys sighed and hoped she wasn&rsquo;t frowning. &ldquo;How awful. My children and I haven&rsquo;t truly tried our luck in the Winter yet. They remind me of cats.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Jon exclaimed, not at all seeing the comparison. &ldquo;Are you mad? They&rsquo;re like\u2026&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t know what do say with out saying the words beasts or monsters.</p><p>&ldquo;Cats, I swear to you,&rdquo; she promised, &ldquo;They love to find a sunny spot and stretch out for hours. Twisting around the spiky mountains in Dragonstone. They would curl their tails around a peak, or most likely Drogon would snag that green, patchy part of the cliff and nap all day. Just like cats.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon chuckled and Dany heard Missandei snort a little. As much as her friend and lover feared her children, they respected them. They understood the magnificence of them. Her dragons were gods-sent. A miracle.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember seeing that for the first time,&rdquo; Jon recalled, &ldquo;it was the strangest thing I ever saw. Almost thought I was dreaming.&rdquo; He stopped for a moment, then started, &ldquo;I wonder\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>Dany waited a moment but when he didn&rsquo;t continue, she asked, &ldquo;What do you wonder, Jon?&rdquo;</p><p>He swept his eyes around her face then in front before saying, &ldquo;I wonder how Ghost is doing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;ve heard of your Ghost. A direwolf\u2014 the Stark sigil.&rdquo; She thought of the wolf baring it&rsquo;s fangs on a green and white banner.</p><p>&ldquo;You were a good student weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps. I loved stories.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s your favorite Stark story, eh?&rdquo; He bumped her hip playfully.</p><p>She took a deep breath. &ldquo;I believe it was called Brandon the Builder. I always thought of him as a Creator, of sorts. Honorable.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon smiled, but then his eyes darkened. He looked at her again. &ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s named after him, Bran. He used to want to be a knight before Jamie Lannister pushed him off a window ledge,&rdquo; he tried not to spit that part, but he couldn&rsquo;t help it.&ldquo; Bran liked climbing, you see. And\u2026 I just know Lady Kat told him to not go around like an animal. Not that day. Because the King was there. But Bran wasn&rsquo;t a great listener. He was only eight at the time, and the only thing he thought he was good at was climbing. So that&rsquo;s what he did. While Jamie and Cersei were\u2026 Bran saw them through the window. Probably didn&rsquo;t know what he saw. Jamie pushed him anyway. I\u2014 it took a lot out of me to not beat that man&rsquo;s face to a pulp at the Unveiling.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany considered the story for a bit. Processing the information about his brother. &ldquo;He survived the fall I was told, however, he is paralyzed. I do not trust Cersei in the slightest. Jamie gave off a different aura. Something is off between the two. Did you notice?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon blinked away the simmering fury and thought for a moment. Did he? Jamie was still the Hand of the Queen, and unlike Cersei, he was terrified of the wight. He looked like he might actually want to help their cause. If only for his and Cersei&rsquo;s safety.</p><p>&ldquo;I noticed his fear of the wight. But he still follows Cersei. I don&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany nodded. &ldquo;Neither do I, but he could be our way to the Army of the Seven Kingdoms. And he and Cersei were not on good terms. The tension was palpable. We should figure out a way to use this against him.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon raised his brows, really studying her face before they opened the doors to the breakfast hall. &ldquo;You think we could manipulate the Queen&rsquo;s Hand?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have his brother. And the wights did scare him. Any wrong move on Cersei&rsquo;s part could end their love affair for good. Didn&rsquo;t you notice how exhausted he looked? He&rsquo;s ready for peace.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon nodded to the guards at the door, and they opened the doors. The smell of potatoes, eggs, and peppers tickled her tongue and Dany momentarily forget what they were talking about.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s discuss this later. I&rsquo;ve worked myself to quite the appetite,&rdquo; the Queen added with a wink and sat herself at the one end of the table. Jon looked at the other end and Dany&rsquo;s eyes clouded for a moment. Of course he would sit at the other end. He&rsquo;s a King. It&rsquo;s just so far away.</p><p>Jon pulled up the chair to her right and gave her a smile, eliciting the wings inside to flurry in her stomach. The Mother of Dragons practically swooned.</p><p>Dany looked around the table noting Jorah and Ser Davos, but where was Tyrion?</p><p>With a rush and a sigh, her Hand waltzed it smelling of grapes. &ldquo;Good morning, all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the one with the late morning,&rdquo; Jorah quipped.</p><p>Immediately, Tyrion started to pile his plate. &ldquo;I almost always have late mornings, Ser Mormont.&rdquo;</p><p>Jorah rolled his eyes while Dany and Missandei snickered. Dany knew why Tyrion came in late. Attention diverted to him, no one even questioned the King and Queen. As they should. It&rsquo;s none of their business who lays with who. When it is their business, she&rsquo;ll tell them so. Jon&rsquo;s hand found her&rsquo;s underneath the table and squeezed a bit before splaying his whole palm on her thigh.</p><p>She gave him a wicked grin and scooped some egg into her mouth. One more night before the fun ends abruptly into cold, deadly reality. Might as well make the most of it.</p>",

The grey morning with her foggy cloak made him grimace, but he stopped to look out anyway, if only to give the queen more time.</p><p>Two more days and they should be in Winterfell. <i>Gods</i>, it\u2019s been so long since he\u2019d been there. Hopefully no one tried to kill them\u2026</p><p>How will Winterfell be after all the tragedy had torn through them?

But what if she\u2019s not pregnant and she ends up going mad because of it?</p><p>He bit the inside of his cheek until his eyes filled. Oh, he\u2019s messed this up truly. He thought of the promise he made to Cersei, his only sister who birthed two beautiful children, to her unborn child.</p><p>Now, he\u2019ll have to betray her, because if Daenerys is or ever does have children, it\u2019ll be a miracle one. Whoever it is would probably conquer the world.</p><p>If she\u2019s truly pregnant, he thought, I\u2019ll have to tell her sooner rather than later.</p><p><i>Gods</i>, why did he lie in the first place? He shook his head, his shaggy hair whipping in the wind. If he was being honest, he didn\u2019t want the Queen to do anything rash. Like burn Cersei and her unborn child.</p><p>He stood on his toes for a moment to watch the sea. His calf muscles clenched and unclenched; it wasn\u2019t right\u2014the things he thinks his queen to be capable of. Dany\u2019s impulsive, yes, but not a true murderer. This is a mother and child on the line. She wouldn't\u2026</p><p>Granted the mother is his merciless, cold-blooded killer-sister who actually birthed a demon incarnate. Tyrion still thought of Joffery\u2019s death as one of his best memories.</p><p>Alright, he\u2019ll have to tell her before they land. How he\u2019ll muster up the courage, he didn\u2019t know. But his loyalty was with her, and the new world she promised.</p><hr><p>Daenerys giggled while facing the best mirror they could find on the ship. She didn\u2019t mind for in its reflection she could see her dearest friend laugh. How could she actually be happy at a time like this? She sighed, touching the amethysts encrusting the bodice of her dress. Thankfully, a thick liner of fur saved the inside from being itchy.</p><p>Missandei laid her chin on Dany\u2019s shoulder and held her hand, giving her fingers a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYou are most beautiful when you smile, khalessi.\u201d</p><p>Dany smiled wider. \u201cWhy do you continue to call me by my old titles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it forever, I promise,\u201d she answered, breaking eye contact for a moment, \u201cbut surrounded by your enemies is the perfect time to remember where you came from. Where you have been.\u201d Missandei went to her trunks and pulled out a beautiful grey and black coat. Dany sighed into it. The extra layer felt like a hug.</p><p>Dany turned toward her friend. \u201cI could never forget.\u201d</p><p>A smile lingered on Miss\u2019 lips, but it was sad. \u201cI know. These are just different lands\u2026 this is a game for these people.\u201d Dany nodded, thinking of Cersei\u2019s complete disregard for the Other\u2019s at the Dragon Pit. The woman saw the rotted, snapping teeth at her throat and chose to let them die. Until Tyrion talked with her.. whatever he said must have shaken her enough to fight with them. Unless he made some sort of deal.</p><p>\u201cMy whole life has been leading up to this\u2014training me to be best at this silly game. Even my brother,\u201d Dany huffed and sat down slowly in a chair, \u201che trained me to be silent and observant. When that no longer served me, I learned from Drogo to be merciless, to be a khalessi.\u201d She looked up to her friend, who looked like she was about to cry. \u201cWhen you call me that, it shoots fire through me. The word reminds me of who I was, yes, but do I continue to be it even though the people here are so different?\u201d</p><p>Missandei knelt down and gently grasped Dany\u2019s hand. \u201cI was scared when you came to my city,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut you made real change. You were compassionate, and fierce, and a sad but fearful Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains. You are what they say, Queen Daenerys. But you are so, so much more. You are a savior, my friend.\u201d Her eyes glimmered with brindled fire. Dany knew Miss wasn\u2019t just speaking politics. This was now life or death. \u201cSave these people.\u201d</p><p>A light knock of the cabin door made the women jump into each other before they burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cWe only have a day or two more of normalcy. Let\u2019s enjoy it while we can,\u201d Dany suggested as Missandei went to get the door.</p><p>\u201cYes? Oh\u2014\u201d Dany heard Miss say to whoever was at the door. When she looked over her shoulder, heat spread to her cheeks. \u201cKing Jon, good morning.\u201d</p><p>Jon grinned at Missandei, glanced at Dany, then looked down sheepishly. \u201cGood morning. My apologies for the interruption, but I was hoping to escort the Queen and her Lady to the breakfast hall.\u201d</p><p>Miss looked over to her Queen, eye widening. Dany nodded with a growing smile and lifted herself from the chair, stepping closer to her guest. \u201cPlease come in from the cold while Missandei gathers her coat. How are your rooms?\u201d</p><p>Jon stepped inside and closed the door, keeping his hands clasped in front of him. \u201cPretty drab compared to yours, my Queen.\u201d</p><p><i>Delicious</i> is all she could think whenever Jon licked his lips after my Queen. How could a man do such things to her? She wanted to run over and taste his lips herself. She adjusted her dress instead.</p><p>Missandei interrupted Dany\u2019s thoughts, thankfully by walking to the door already cloaked. How can every other one of her thoughts be of his lips?</p><p>With Missandei\u2019s back was to them, Jon captured her fingers in his. Her breath caught in her throat. <i>This man will be the death of me</i>.</p><p>The cold air pierced her lungs as soon as she breathed again, reminding her of just two nights ago. Was it really just the other night? Memories of the Wight Hunt sent tears stinging in her eyes. That was the one of the worst days of her life, and the air was a constant reminder of the child she lost. Ice slashed at her face as she had looked back to see Viscerion sinking into the frozen, broken lake while Jon stood, deserted in that godsforsaken place.</p><p>Jon must have noticed her shoulders slightly droop because he tugged her hand to his chest and kissed her fingers. Wings fluttered below her heart, curling a tail lovingly around her ribs. She stood a little straighter, and tried to step a little closer, but Missandei was already gesturing for them forwards. Dany moved her hand to Jon\u2019s elbow and he led them out towards breakfast.</p><p>\u201cThis cold is getting out of hand,\u201d Dany began shielding her eyes away from the wind.</p><p>Jon covered her hand with his. \u201cAh, this is only in the morning. By the sun\u2019s rise, the winds simmer, but we won\u2019t see our sun for a long while.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys sighed and hoped she wasn\u2019t frowning. \u201cHow awful. My children and I haven\u2019t truly tried our luck in the Winter yet. They remind me of cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jon exclaimed, not at all seeing the comparison. \u201cAre you mad? They\u2019re like\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t know what do say with out saying the words beasts or monsters.</p><p>\u201cCats, I swear to you,\u201d she promised, \u201cThey love to find a sunny spot and stretch out for hours. Twisting around the spiky mountains in Dragonstone. They would curl their tails around a peak, or most likely Drogon would snag that green, patchy part of the cliff and nap all day. Just like cats.\u201d</p><p>Jon chuckled and Dany heard Missandei snort a little. As much as her friend and lover feared her children, they respected them. They understood the magnificence of them. Her dragons were gods-sent. A miracle.</p><p>\u201cI remember seeing that for the first time,\u201d Jon recalled, \u201cit was the strangest thing I ever saw. Almost thought I was dreaming.\u201d He stopped for a moment, then started, \u201cI wonder\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dany waited a moment but when he didn\u2019t continue, she asked, \u201cWhat do you wonder, Jon?\u201d</p><p>He swept his eyes around her face then in front before saying, \u201cI wonder how Ghost is doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019ve heard of your Ghost. A direwolf\u2014 the Stark sigil.\u201d She thought of the wolf baring it\u2019s fangs on a green and white banner.</p><p>\u201cYou were a good student weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.

This is a mother and child on the line. She wouldn't\u2026</p><p>Granted the mother is his merciless, cold-blooded killer-sister who actually birthed a demon incarnate. Tyrion still thought of Joffery\u2019s death as one of his best memories.</p><p>Alright, he\u2019ll have to tell her before they land. How he\u2019ll muster up the courage, he didn\u2019t know. But his loyalty was with her, and the new world she promised.</p><hr><p>Daenerys giggled while facing the best mirror they could find on the ship. She didn\u2019t mind for in its reflection she could see her dearest friend laugh. How could she actually be happy at a time like this? She sighed, touching the amethysts encrusting the bodice of her dress. Thankfully, a thick liner of fur saved the inside from being itchy.</p><p>Missandei laid her chin on Dany\u2019s shoulder and held her hand, giving her fingers a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYou are most beautiful when you smile, khalessi.\u201d</p><p>Dany smiled wider. \u201cWhy do you continue to call me by my old titles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it forever, I promise,\u201d she answered, breaking eye contact for a moment, \u201cbut surrounded by your enemies is the perfect time to remember where you came from. Where you have been.\u201d Missandei went to her trunks and pulled out a beautiful grey and black coat. Dany sighed into it. The extra layer felt like a hug.</p><p>Dany turned toward her friend. \u201cI could never forget.\u201d</p><p>A smile lingered on Miss\u2019 lips, but it was sad. \u201cI know. These are just different lands\u2026 this is a game for these people.\u201d Dany nodded, thinking of Cersei\u2019s complete disregard for the Other\u2019s at the Dragon Pit. The woman saw the rotted, snapping teeth at her throat and chose to let them die. Until Tyrion talked with her.. whatever he said must have shaken her enough to fight with them. Unless he made some sort of deal.</p><p>\u201cMy whole life has been leading up to this\u2014training me to be best at this silly game. Even my brother,\u201d Dany huffed and sat down slowly in a chair, \u201che trained me to be silent and observant. When that no longer served me, I learned from Drogo to be merciless, to be a khalessi.\u201d She looked up to her friend, who looked like she was about to cry. \u201cWhen you call me that, it shoots fire through me. The word reminds me of who I was, yes, but do I continue to be it even though the people here are so different?\u201d</p><p>Missandei knelt down and gently grasped Dany\u2019s hand. \u201cI was scared when you came to my city,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut you made real change. You were compassionate, and fierce, and a sad but fearful Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains. You are what they say, Queen Daenerys. But you are so, so much more. You are a savior, my friend.\u201d Her eyes glimmered with brindled fire. Dany knew Miss wasn\u2019t just speaking politics. This was now life or death. \u201cSave these people.\u201d</p><p>A light knock of the cabin door made the women jump into each other before they burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cWe only have a day or two more of normalcy. Let\u2019s enjoy it while we can,\u201d Dany suggested as Missandei went to get the door.</p><p>\u201cYes? Oh\u2014\u201d Dany heard Miss say to whoever was at the door. When she looked over her shoulder, heat spread to her cheeks. \u201cKing Jon, good morning.\u201d</p><p>Jon grinned at Missandei, glanced at Dany, then looked down sheepishly. \u201cGood morning. My apologies for the interruption, but I was hoping to escort the Queen and her Lady to the breakfast hall.\u201d</p><p>Miss looked over to her Queen, eye widening. Dany nodded with a growing smile and lifted herself from the chair, stepping closer to her guest. \u201cPlease come in from the cold while Missandei gathers her coat. How are your rooms?\u201d</p><p>Jon stepped inside and closed the door, keeping his hands clasped in front of him. \u201cPretty drab compared to yours, my Queen.\u201d</p><p><i>Delicious</i> is all she could think whenever Jon licked his lips after my Queen. How could a man do such things to her? She wanted to run over and taste his lips herself. She adjusted her dress instead.</p><p>Missandei interrupted Dany\u2019s thoughts, thankfully by walking to the door already cloaked. How can every other one of her thoughts be of his lips?</p><p>With Missandei\u2019s back was to them, Jon captured her fingers in his. Her breath caught in her throat. <i>This man will be the death of me</i>.</p><p>The cold air pierced her lungs as soon as she breathed again, reminding her of just two nights ago. Was it really just the other night? Memories of the Wight Hunt sent tears stinging in her eyes. That was the one of the worst days of her life, and the air was a constant reminder of the child she lost. Ice slashed at her face as she had looked back to see Viscerion sinking into the frozen, broken lake while Jon stood, deserted in that godsforsaken place.</p><p>Jon must have noticed her shoulders slightly droop because he tugged her hand to his chest and kissed her fingers. Wings fluttered below her heart, curling a tail lovingly around her ribs. She stood a little straighter, and tried to step a little closer, but Missandei was already gesturing for them forwards. Dany moved her hand to Jon\u2019s elbow and he led them out towards breakfast.</p><p>\u201cThis cold is getting out of hand,\u201d Dany began shielding her eyes away from the wind.</p><p>Jon covered her hand with his. \u201cAh, this is only in the morning. By the sun\u2019s rise, the winds simmer, but we won\u2019t see our sun for a long while.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys sighed and hoped she wasn\u2019t frowning. \u201cHow awful. My children and I haven\u2019t truly tried our luck in the Winter yet. They remind me of cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jon exclaimed, not at all seeing the comparison. \u201cAre you mad? They\u2019re like\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t know what do say with out saying the words beasts or monsters.</p><p>\u201cCats, I swear to you,\u201d she promised, \u201cThey love to find a sunny spot and stretch out for hours. Twisting around the spiky mountains in Dragonstone. They would curl their tails around a peak, or most likely Drogon would snag that green, patchy part of the cliff and nap all day. Just like cats.\u201d</p><p>Jon chuckled and Dany heard Missandei snort a little. As much as her friend and lover feared her children, they respected them. They understood the magnificence of them. Her dragons were gods-sent. A miracle.</p><p>\u201cI remember seeing that for the first time,\u201d Jon recalled, \u201cit was the strangest thing I ever saw. Almost thought I was dreaming.\u201d He stopped for a moment, then started, \u201cI wonder\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dany waited a moment but when he didn\u2019t continue, she asked, \u201cWhat do you wonder, Jon?\u201d</p><p>He swept his eyes around her face then in front before saying, \u201cI wonder how Ghost is doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019ve heard of your Ghost. A direwolf\u2014 the Stark sigil.\u201d She thought of the wolf baring it\u2019s fangs on a green and white banner.</p><p>\u201cYou were a good student weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. I loved stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s your favorite Stark story, eh?\u201d He bumped her hip playfully.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI believe it was called Brandon the Builder. I always thought of him as a Creator, of sorts. Honorable.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled, but then his eyes darkened. He looked at her again. \u201cMy brother\u2019s named after him, Bran. He used to want to be a knight before Jamie Lannister pushed him off a window ledge,\u201d he tried not to spit that part, but he couldn\u2019t help it.\u201c Bran liked climbing, you see. And\u2026 I just know Lady Kat told him to not go around like an animal. Not that day. Because the King was there. But Bran wasn\u2019t a great listener. He was only eight at the time, and the only thing he thought he was good at was climbing. So that\u2019s what he did. While Jamie and Cersei were\u2026 Bran saw them through the window. Probably didn\u2019t know what he saw. Jamie pushed him anyway. I\u2014 it took a lot out of me to not beat that man\u2019s face to a pulp at the Unveiling.\u201d</p><p>Dany considered the story for a bit. Processing the information about his brother. \u201cHe survived the fall I was told, however, he is paralyzed. I do not trust Cersei in the slightest. Jamie gave off a different aura. Something is off between the two. Did you notice?\u201d</p><p>Jon blinked away the simmering fury and thought for a moment. Did he? Jamie was still the Hand of the Queen, and unlike Cersei, he was terrified of the wight. He looked like he might actually want to help their cause. If only for his and Cersei\u2019s safety.</p><p>\u201cI noticed his fear of the wight. But he still follows Cersei. I don\u2019t trust him.\u201d</p><p>Dany nodded. \u201cNeither do I, but he could be our way to the Army of the Seven Kingdoms. And he and Cersei were not on good terms. The tension was palpable. We should figure out a way to use this against him.\u201d</p><p>Jon raised his brows, really studying her face before they opened the doors to the breakfast hall. \u201cYou think we could manipulate the Queen\u2019s Hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have his brother. And the wights did scare him. Any wrong move on Cersei\u2019s part could end their love affair for good. Didn\u2019t you notice how exhausted he looked? He\u2019s ready for peace.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded to the guards at the door, and they opened the doors. The smell of potatoes, eggs, and peppers tickled her tongue and Dany momentarily forget what they were talking about.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s discuss this later. I\u2019ve worked myself to quite the appetite,\u201d the Queen added with a wink and sat herself at the one end of the table. Jon looked at the other end and Dany\u2019s eyes clouded for a moment. Of course he would sit at the other end. He\u2019s a King. It\u2019s just so far away.</p><p>Jon pulled up the chair to her right and gave her a smile, eliciting the wings inside to flurry in her stomach. The Mother of Dragons practically swooned.</p><p>Dany looked around the table noting Jorah and Ser Davos, but where was Tyrion?</p><p>With a rush and a sigh, her Hand waltzed it smelling of grapes. \u201cGood morning, all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the one with the late morning,\u201d Jorah quipped.</p><p>Immediately, Tyrion started to pile his plate. \u201cI almost always have late mornings, Ser Mormont.\u201d</p><p>Jorah rolled his eyes while Dany and Missandei snickered. Dany knew why Tyrion came in late. Attention diverted to him, no one even questioned the King and Queen. As they should. It\u2019s none of their business who lays with who. When it is their business, she\u2019ll tell them so. Jon\u2019s hand found her\u2019s underneath the table and squeezed a bit before splaying his whole palm on her thigh.</p><p>She gave him a wicked grin and scooped some egg into her mouth. One more night before the fun ends abruptly into cold, deadly reality. Might as well make the most of it.</p>",

But what if she&rsquo;s not pregnant and she ends up going mad because of it?</p><p>He bit the inside of his cheek until his eyes filled. Oh, he&rsquo;s messed this up truly.

Whoever it is would probably conquer the world.</p><p>If she&rsquo;s truly pregnant, he thought, I&rsquo;ll have to tell her sooner rather than later.</p><p><i>Gods</i>, why did he lie in the first place?
