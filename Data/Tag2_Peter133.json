Peter wanted the floor to open up and eat him whole.\u00a0 He continued staring at the floor, praying for Tony to say something&hellip; <i>anything</i>&hellip; even a rejection would be better than this painful silence.</p><p>When Tony didn\u2019t speak, Peter knew it was time to bolt.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI- I\u2019ll just leave, then,\u201d Peter murmured, still avoiding eye contact and turning to walk towards the door.\u00a0 As he turned, he felt a hand grasp his arm, holding him back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d Tony said, his voice sounding soft, surprisingly vulnerable.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Peter asked.\u00a0 His heart was thumping in his chest so hard that he was sure that Tony could hear it.<br/></p><p>Tony sighed, his hand still gripping Peter\u2019s arm.\u00a0 It would have hurt if Peter wasn\u2019t too focused on everything else that was going on.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBecause I&hellip; <i>want</i>\u00a0you.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinked and stared at Tony.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou&hellip;. want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I- <i>fuck</i>.\u00a0 Peter, we can\u2019t.\u00a0 It\u2019s wrong.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peter stepped closer to Tony, feeling a sudden save of confidence wash over him.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not wrong, Mr Stark.\u00a0 I\u2019m eighteen.\u201d</p><p>Tony laughed, although Peter could tell he didn\u2019t think anything was funny.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou turned eighteen four months ago,\u201d Tony said, loosening his grip on Peter\u2019s arm and shaking his head.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m over double your age.\u00a0 We both know it\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Peter whispered desperately.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPlease, it\u2019s all I want.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cPeter, I-\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter leaned in to close the gap between them, breaking Tony off mid-sentence and catching the older man by surprise.\u00a0 Tony let go of Peter\u2019s arm completely and let both his arms move up to wrap easily around Peter\u2019s small waist, pulling him closer so their bodies were pressed together.\u00a0 The kiss wasn\u2019t heated, but it was passionate.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t rough, but it was intense.\u00a0 It was an exploration; an experimentation.\u00a0 And God, it was <i>so </i>good.\u00a0 Peter didn\u2019t want it to ever end, but soon enough, Tony\u2019s lips were gone.</p><p>Tony\u2019s arms were still wrapped around Peter.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI kinda really love you too, Peter,\u201d Tony said with the most heart-warming smile Peter had ever seen in his life.\u00a0 But the younger man couldn\u2019t believe his ears - had Tony <i>really</i>\u00a0just said that?\u00a0 Well, what had he really expected?\u00a0 Tony had just KISSED him.\u00a0 There had to have been <i>some</i>\u00a0feelings, but&hellip; love?</p><p>\u201cMr Stark-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c-Call me Tony,\u201d Tony said softly, pulling Peter closer yet.\u00a0 He leaned in towards Peter\u2019s ear.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou can call me\u00a0\u2018Mr Stark\u2019 in the bedroom,\u201d he whispered.<br/></p><p>Peter felt like his legs would collapse beneath him.\u00a0 Had Tony just insinuated&hellip; had he just <i>suggested</i>&hellip;\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Peter muttered, despite the fact that the man who always berated him for swearing was standing right in front of him.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, we can do that too,\u201d Tony smirked.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMr- <i>Tony</i>!\u201d Peter exclaimed, blushing deeply.<br/></p><p>\u201cMr Tony?\u201d Tony smiled.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a new one.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI- uh-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c-Kiss me again,\u201d Tony murmured, interrupting his nervous stuttering.\u00a0 And how could Peter say no?\u00a0 How could he refuse the beautiful man in front of him?\u00a0 So he obliged, with pleasure.\u00a0 It was the best day of his life.</p>",

        "body": "<p><b>Ship: </b>Harley Keener/Peter Parker</p><p><b>Summary: </b>Peter Parker feels on top of the world! Getting good grades in high school, spending time with Tony Stark (!!!) on his weekends, and at night, he roams the city as the hero known as Spider-Man! Everything changes when a new student shows up at Midtown who seems determined to take it all away from him.<br/></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17695649/chapters/42001172\" target=\"_blank\">AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13200736/4/All-I-see-is-green\" target=\"_blank\">FF.net</a></p><hr><p>Harley watched as threatening clouds rolled in overhead, the side of his head pressed against the cold side window. He wonders, over his head deep into his own teenage angst, whether the weather would continue to accurate reflect his mood all day, and sighed as the first rain drops started to splash onto the windshield. </p><p>\u201cAm I going to have to pick you up after school, kid?\u201d Harley could tell Happy was experimenting with how much reluctance he could passively make known to the teen, without outright saying it.<br/></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cUh, probably,\u201d he replied honestly, not sure how else he would be finding his way back to the compound. </p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Happy sighed, \u201cthat sounds like it might be no. Just text me if you change your mind.\u201d Harley simply nodded, not feeling up for giving an outright response. He wished he could have stayed home today, but Tony was quite insistent that he faced the music. \u201cPeter is not upset with you,\u201d he had pressed, but did not elaborate on why he knew this so certainly. On the one hand, he hoped nothing more than to encounter Peter as soon as possible today, so he could apologise and ask to start over. On the other hand\u2026 Peter had plenty of reason to hate him, and Harley wasn\u2019t sure if he would be up for a confrontation like that.</p><p>\u201cHey, Happy?\u201d The man simply grunted in response, which Harley took as a sign that he was listening. </p><p>\u201cDo you know Peter Parker?\u201d Squinted eyes flickered in his direction, before immediately turning back to the road ahead. </p><p>\u201cYeah, annoying little boy. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I just,\u201d Harley swallowed, \u201cI said some pretty mean things to him. I mean, I didn\u2019t know him, but\u2026 Yeah, I said some awful stuff, and I don\u2019t really know how to talk to him about it, you know?\u201d Happy\u2019s eyes flickered over again, although this time including a sceptically raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, kid,\u201d he spoke as he turned back to the windshield. \u201cThere is no way to get rid of that Parker boy, and God knows I\u2019ve tried. You could probably punch him in the face and he would apologise for getting in the way of your fist. Just say you\u2019re sorry and give him some attention, and he\u2019ll be all over you. He\u2019s like a puppy that way.\u201d Is this also the case if you publically falsely accuse him in front of all his classmates, and then humiliate and bully him all day, Harley wanted to say, guilt sitting heavy in his abdomen. </p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he, ever so eloquently, chose to say instead. He turned back to look outside, and noticed that they were pulling up on Midtown\u2019s parking lot. He grabbed his backpack from where he had put it between his legs, and unbuckled his seatbelt. He paused, with his hand on the door handle, and looked towards Happy. Fear and anticipation were rolling around his stomach, fighting a battle for dominance until they finally settled as a feeling of general anxiety. </p><p>\u201cDo you really think-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid, can you save the heart-to-hearts for Tony? I have better things to do.\u201d Harley deflated and turned away, opening the car door. Just as he was about to close it, he heard Happy mutter something about \u201cdriving those kids himself\u201d, and decided he didn\u2019t really like Tony\u2019s former bodyguard very much. </p><p>Although he had been nervous to go into school yesterday, it seemed to pale in comparison to what he felt now as he looked up at the looming building towering over his head. He clenched and unclenched his hands, feeling his finger nails dig into the palms of his hands as he stood, contemplating what his day would look like. A sudden hand on his shoulder aggressively shook him out of his stupor. </p><p>\u201cHey, Harles! Good to see you, man. How are you doing today?\u201d Flash stood next to him, uncovering his shockingly white teeth in his characteristic grin. Harley turned to him, trying to remember the (one of many) speeches he had prepared as he was lying wide awake in bed last night. </p><p>\u201cGood morning, Flash. Listen, I really need to talk to you. It\u2019s about Peter.\u201d Flash\u2019s grin fell, and turned into a confused frown in record time.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to talk about Penis Parker? Did he do something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, no, I just-\u201d He was cut off by the first warning bell that rang across the school grounds, and Flash started walking away.</p><p>\u201cSorry, dude, but we have P.E. first period and we have to go now if we want to be on time,\u201d he explained as he rushed towards the school, followed suit by Harley. \u201cJust tell me at lunch.\u201d Harley sighed but chased Flash, deep in thought. He knew that Flash\u2019s behaviour towards Peter was horrible: it was straight-up bullying, even. Yet he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Flash was really a likable person. He had shown Harley nothing but genuine kindness and he seemed like a funny guy. And honestly, Harley would be the biggest hypocrite on Earth to blame him for acting out against Peter because he thought he was lying. He hoped that, by telling Flash the truth about what happened he could get him to be nicer to Peter as well. </p><p>They quickly changed in the mostly empty changing rooms as soon as they arrived at the sports hall, and rushed inside the hall, where the majority of their classmates were already waiting for class to start. Harley\u2019s eyes skimmed the crowd until he saw Peter, sat curled up on the bench on the very left, his head turned towards his friend, who was enthusiastically telling him about something, gesturing wildly. He looked tired, but wore a tired smile at his friend\u2019s antics nonetheless. Flash dragged him over to the right side, just as the teacher entered the hall, and class started.</p><hr><p>All day, Harley had been trying to get Flash and Peter alone for long enough to talk to them, but Peter seemed to (and rightfully so, of course) avoid him like the plague, and Flash was constantly surrounded by his friends. Although Harley did not necessarily dislike the other boys, he felt that talking to Flash about their mistake in front of his friend might be humiliating for him, and ruining two persons\u2019 reputations by public humiliation in two days didn\u2019t seem like the kind of track record he\u2019d want to be aiming for at his new school. </p><p>Eventually, as he was taking his books out of his bag for his final class of the day, Flash leaned over and asked: \u201cHey, do you want to hang out after school? We can go to my place, if you want.\u201d </p><p>Harley thought about Tony, and how upset he had seemed that morning, no matter how hard he had tried to hide it. He thought about Happy, who did not do justice to his name, and seemed highly reluctant to pick him up from school. He thought about Flash, who\u2019s presence around him seemed to scare away students who came looking to mess with the \u2018new kid\u2019. The decision came easy.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, sounds great!\u201d He quickly whipped out his phone and sent a text of dismissal to Happy, before turning to smile at Flash, who was grinning back at him. </p><hr><p>Flash\u2019s car was really cool. Granted, it was his father\u2019s car, as he had admitted as soon as Harley stopped ranting about its beauty and luxury, but it didn\u2019t make it any less impressive to the other boy. The car took off with surprising speed as Flash turned onto the road, and Harley couldn\u2019t help but grin at the butterflies that appeared in his stomach as a result. Meanwhile, Flash was chatting nonstop. </p><p>\u201c\u2026 she was quite pretty, as well, but just didn\u2019t understand that that isn\u2019t how customer service works, you know? So, I was explaining this calmly to her as I was driving her to Homecoming, when all of a sudden Spider-Man appeared on the hood of my car!\u201d At the mention of the infamous Queens vigilante, Harley\u2019s attention snapped back to the other\u2019s words. </p><p>\u201cWoah, Spider-Man?\u201d Flash nodded with a shit-eating grin, obviously enjoying Harley\u2019s engagement in his story. </p><p>\u201cYeah, dude, Spider-Man! He had just saved my life a couple weeks earlier when I almost died in the elevator in the Washington Monument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in there?! I saw it on the news!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was really scary, but Spider-Man helped us out. It was a little weird, because Spider-Man usually only helps out in Queens, you know? And suddenly he was in DC, saving my ass. That\u2019s like, what? Four hours from NYC? A little out of his usual range, you know?\u201d Harley vaguely remember Spider-Man fighting in a German airport with Tony a while back, but chose not to mention it, instead nodding along to Flash\u2019s story.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d Harley almost wanted to laugh at the childlike question, but knew better, considering the other teen was sharing a story of when his life was in serious danger. He nodded again.</p><p>\u201cI think Spider-Man is in love with me.\u201d At that, Harley\u2019s head snapped up and he stared at Flash, his eyes wide, and a smile forming on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked incredulously. \u201cNo offence, dude, but why do you think Spider-Man is in love with you?\u201d Flash laughed, a blush forming on his face as he visibly grew embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man, I just\u2026 the coincidence of him constantly showing up where I am\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe he\u2019s not in love, maybe it\u2019s just a crush, but\u2026\u201d He sighed. \u201cWhat are the chances of him just picking my car out of everyone who was on the road in New York City that night, you know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPretty slim,\u201d Harley agreed, humouring Flash\u2019s thoughts. </p><p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like I have a crush on him, or anything,\u201d Flash hastily added, glancing towards Harley. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 you know, I don\u2019t do that stuff, but I just\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a weird thing to have told you. Forget I said anything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, dude, it\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Harley quickly assured him, his heart thundering in his chest as he took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m gay. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Flash glanced at him again, but his gaze lingered slightly, before turning back to the road.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d he muttered. \u201cOh, that\u2019s cool, dude, that\u2019s perfectly fine.\u201d Harley couldn\u2019t suppress his smile just as Flash pulled up to a big house in the New York suburbs, putting a code into the gate leading to a seemingly endless driveway to open it. </p><hr><p>Harley ended up spending hours at Flash\u2019s mansion (honestly, it was way too big to call a house. \u2018Castle\u2019 would have been more fitting), and couldn\u2019t deny having endless fun. They played Mario Kart and talking about Spider-Man, and school, and college, and family. Harley even ended up telling him about Jason. He was about to tell Flash about Tony, about meeting Iron Man, and being taken in by him years later, but then it hit him. What if Flash would think he was lying too? After such a vulnerable, yet fun afternoon, he didn\u2019t want to risk losing his friend to a misunderstanding like that. He would tell him, eventually, by showing him his home at the Avengers Compound, but in that moment, he chose to keep it to himself, and by doing so, also neglected to tell Flash about Peter\u2019s situation. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay getting home?\u201d Flash asked as he leaned against the gate that he was dropped Harley off at. \u201cIt\u2019s really no problem to drive you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Harley quickly responded. \u201cI\u2019ll walk to the closest bus stop and travel home by public transport.\u201d In reality, he had asked Tony to pick him up from there, but Flash really didn\u2019t need to know that. The latter nodded, and grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cGet home safe, dude,\u201d he said, as he walked away, waving his hand at the boy as he closed the gate behind him. Harley set off, his StarkPhone in hand as he manoeuvred his way through the winding street of suburban New York. The bus stop was supposed to only be a block away, and although his phone insistently told him to go straight ahead and turn left at the end, simply observation told him that the alley to his right would take him straight to the stop. He shrugged, and ducked into the alley, quickly making his way towards the light at the end, trying to shake the unreasonable anxiety that rose in his stomach. </p><p>\u201cSlow your stroll, asshole, unless you want some extra holes in that body of yours.\u201d Right\u2026 Not that unreasonable, then.<br/></p>",

Just text me if you change your mind.\u201d Harley simply nodded, not feeling up for giving an outright response. He wished he could have stayed home today, but Tony was quite insistent that he faced the music. \u201cPeter is not upset with you,\u201d he had pressed, but did not elaborate on why he knew this so certainly. On the one hand, he hoped nothing more than to encounter Peter as soon as possible today, so he could apologise and ask to start over. On the other hand\u2026 Peter had plenty of reason to hate him, and Harley wasn\u2019t sure if he would be up for a confrontation like that.</p><p>\u201cHey, Happy?\u201d The man simply grunted in response, which Harley took as a sign that he was listening. </p><p>\u201cDo you know Peter Parker?\u201d Squinted eyes flickered in his direction, before immediately turning back to the road ahead. </p><p>\u201cYeah, annoying little boy. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I just,\u201d Harley swallowed, \u201cI said some pretty mean things to him. I mean, I didn\u2019t know him, but\u2026 Yeah, I said some awful stuff, and I don\u2019t really know how to talk to him about it, you know?\u201d Happy\u2019s eyes flickered over again, although this time including a sceptically raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, kid,\u201d he spoke as he turned back to the windshield. \u201cThere is no way to get rid of that Parker boy, and God knows I\u2019ve tried. You could probably punch him in the face and he would apologise for getting in the way of your fist. Just say you\u2019re sorry and give him some attention, and he\u2019ll be all over you. He\u2019s like a puppy that way.\u201d Is this also the case if you publically falsely accuse him in front of all his classmates, and then humiliate and bully him all day, Harley wanted to say, guilt sitting heavy in his abdomen. </p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he, ever so eloquently, chose to say instead. He turned back to look outside, and noticed that they were pulling up on Midtown\u2019s parking lot. He grabbed his backpack from where he had put it between his legs, and unbuckled his seatbelt. He paused, with his hand on the door handle, and looked towards Happy. Fear and anticipation were rolling around his stomach, fighting a battle for dominance until they finally settled as a feeling of general anxiety. </p><p>\u201cDo you really think-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid, can you save the heart-to-hearts for Tony? I have better things to do.\u201d Harley deflated and turned away, opening the car door. Just as he was about to close it, he heard Happy mutter something about \u201cdriving those kids himself\u201d, and decided he didn\u2019t really like Tony\u2019s former bodyguard very much. </p><p>Although he had been nervous to go into school yesterday, it seemed to pale in comparison to what he felt now as he looked up at the looming building towering over his head. He clenched and unclenched his hands, feeling his finger nails dig into the palms of his hands as he stood, contemplating what his day would look like. A sudden hand on his shoulder aggressively shook him out of his stupor. </p><p>\u201cHey, Harles! Good to see you, man. How are you doing today?\u201d Flash stood next to him, uncovering his shockingly white teeth in his characteristic grin. Harley turned to him, trying to remember the (one of many) speeches he had prepared as he was lying wide awake in bed last night. </p><p>\u201cGood morning, Flash. Listen, I really need to talk to you. It\u2019s about Peter.\u201d Flash\u2019s grin fell, and turned into a confused frown in record time.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to talk about Penis Parker? Did he do something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, no, I just-\u201d He was cut off by the first warning bell that rang across the school grounds, and Flash started walking away.</p><p>\u201cSorry, dude, but we have P.E. first period and we have to go now if we want to be on time,\u201d he explained as he rushed towards the school, followed suit by Harley. \u201cJust tell me at lunch.\u201d Harley sighed but chased Flash, deep in thought. He knew that Flash\u2019s behaviour towards Peter was horrible: it was straight-up bullying, even. Yet he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Flash was really a likable person. He had shown Harley nothing but genuine kindness and he seemed like a funny guy. And honestly, Harley would be the biggest hypocrite on Earth to blame him for acting out against Peter because he thought he was lying. He hoped that, by telling Flash the truth about what happened he could get him to be nicer to Peter as well. </p><p>They quickly changed in the mostly empty changing rooms as soon as they arrived at the sports hall, and rushed inside the hall, where the majority of their classmates were already waiting for class to start. Harley\u2019s eyes skimmed the crowd until he saw Peter, sat curled up on the bench on the very left, his head turned towards his friend, who was enthusiastically telling him about something, gesturing wildly. He looked tired, but wore a tired smile at his friend\u2019s antics nonetheless. Flash dragged him over to the right side, just as the teacher entered the hall, and class started.</p><hr><p>All day, Harley had been trying to get Flash and Peter alone for long enough to talk to them, but Peter seemed to (and rightfully so, of course) avoid him like the plague, and Flash was constantly surrounded by his friends. Although Harley did not necessarily dislike the other boys, he felt that talking to Flash about their mistake in front of his friend might be humiliating for him, and ruining two persons\u2019 reputations by public humiliation in two days didn\u2019t seem like the kind of track record he\u2019d want to be aiming for at his new school. </p><p>Eventually, as he was taking his books out of his bag for his final class of the day, Flash leaned over and asked: \u201cHey, do you want to hang out after school? We can go to my place, if you want.\u201d </p><p>Harley thought about Tony, and how upset he had seemed that morning, no matter how hard he had tried to hide it. He thought about Happy, who did not do justice to his name, and seemed highly reluctant to pick him up from school. He thought about Flash, who\u2019s presence around him seemed to scare away students who came looking to mess with the \u2018new kid\u2019. The decision came easy.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, sounds great!\u201d He quickly whipped out his phone and sent a text of dismissal to Happy, before turning to smile at Flash, who was grinning back at him. </p><hr><p>Flash\u2019s car was really cool. Granted, it was his father\u2019s car, as he had admitted as soon as Harley stopped ranting about its beauty and luxury, but it didn\u2019t make it any less impressive to the other boy. The car took off with surprising speed as Flash turned onto the road, and Harley couldn\u2019t help but grin at the butterflies that appeared in his stomach as a result. Meanwhile, Flash was chatting nonstop. </p><p>\u201c\u2026 she was quite pretty, as well, but just didn\u2019t understand that that isn\u2019t how customer service works, you know? So, I was explaining this calmly to her as I was driving her to Homecoming, when all of a sudden Spider-Man appeared on the hood of my car!\u201d At the mention of the infamous Queens vigilante, Harley\u2019s attention snapped back to the other\u2019s words. </p><p>\u201cWoah, Spider-Man?\u201d Flash nodded with a shit-eating grin, obviously enjoying Harley\u2019s engagement in his story. </p><p>\u201cYeah, dude, Spider-Man! He had just saved my life a couple weeks earlier when I almost died in the elevator in the Washington Monument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in there?! I saw it on the news!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was really scary, but Spider-Man helped us out. It was a little weird, because Spider-Man usually only helps out in Queens, you know? And suddenly he was in DC, saving my ass. That\u2019s like, what? Four hours from NYC? A little out of his usual range, you know?\u201d Harley vaguely remember Spider-Man fighting in a German airport with Tony a while back, but chose not to mention it, instead nodding along to Flash\u2019s story.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d Harley almost wanted to laugh at the childlike question, but knew better, considering the other teen was sharing a story of when his life was in serious danger. He nodded again.</p><p>\u201cI think Spider-Man is in love with me.\u201d At that, Harley\u2019s head snapped up and he stared at Flash, his eyes wide, and a smile forming on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked incredulously. \u201cNo offence, dude, but why do you think Spider-Man is in love with you?\u201d Flash laughed, a blush forming on his face as he visibly grew embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man, I just\u2026 the coincidence of him constantly showing up where I am\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe he\u2019s not in love, maybe it\u2019s just a crush, but\u2026\u201d He sighed. \u201cWhat are the chances of him just picking my car out of everyone who was on the road in New York City that night, you know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPretty slim,\u201d Harley agreed, humouring Flash\u2019s thoughts. </p><p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like I have a crush on him, or anything,\u201d Flash hastily added, glancing towards Harley. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 you know, I don\u2019t do that stuff, but I just\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a weird thing to have told you.

It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Flash glanced at him again, but his gaze lingered slightly, before turning back to the road.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d he muttered. \u201cOh, that\u2019s cool, dude, that\u2019s perfectly fine.\u201d Harley couldn\u2019t suppress his smile just as Flash pulled up to a big house in the New York suburbs, putting a code into the gate leading to a seemingly endless driveway to open it. </p><hr><p>Harley ended up spending hours at Flash\u2019s mansion (honestly, it was way too big to call a house. \u2018Castle\u2019 would have been more fitting), and couldn\u2019t deny having endless fun. They played Mario Kart and talking about Spider-Man, and school, and college, and family. Harley even ended up telling him about Jason. He was about to tell Flash about Tony, about meeting Iron Man, and being taken in by him years later, but then it hit him. What if Flash would think he was lying too?

Just as he was about to close it, he heard Happy mutter something about \u201cdriving those kids himself\u201d, and decided he didn\u2019t really like Tony\u2019s former bodyguard very much. </p><p>Although he had been nervous to go into school yesterday, it seemed to pale in comparison to what he felt now as he looked up at the looming building towering over his head. He clenched and unclenched his hands, feeling his finger nails dig into the palms of his hands as he stood, contemplating what his day would look like. A sudden hand on his shoulder aggressively shook him out of his stupor. </p><p>\u201cHey, Harles! Good to see you, man. How are you doing today?\u201d Flash stood next to him, uncovering his shockingly white teeth in his characteristic grin. Harley turned to him, trying to remember the (one of many) speeches he had prepared as he was lying wide awake in bed last night. </p><p>\u201cGood morning, Flash. Listen, I really need to talk to you. It\u2019s about Peter.\u201d Flash\u2019s grin fell, and turned into a confused frown in record time.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to talk about Penis Parker? Did he do something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, no, I just-\u201d He was cut off by the first warning bell that rang across the school grounds, and Flash started walking away.</p><p>\u201cSorry, dude, but we have P.E. first period and we have to go now if we want to be on time,\u201d he explained as he rushed towards the school, followed suit by Harley. \u201cJust tell me at lunch.\u201d Harley sighed but chased Flash, deep in thought. He knew that Flash\u2019s behaviour towards Peter was horrible: it was straight-up bullying, even. Yet he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Flash was really a likable person. He had shown Harley nothing but genuine kindness and he seemed like a funny guy. And honestly, Harley would be the biggest hypocrite on Earth to blame him for acting out against Peter because he thought he was lying. He hoped that, by telling Flash the truth about what happened he could get him to be nicer to Peter as well. </p><p>They quickly changed in the mostly empty changing rooms as soon as they arrived at the sports hall, and rushed inside the hall, where the majority of their classmates were already waiting for class to start. Harley\u2019s eyes skimmed the crowd until he saw Peter, sat curled up on the bench on the very left, his head turned towards his friend, who was enthusiastically telling him about something, gesturing wildly. He looked tired, but wore a tired smile at his friend\u2019s antics nonetheless. Flash dragged him over to the right side, just as the teacher entered the hall, and class started.</p><hr><p>All day, Harley had been trying to get Flash and Peter alone for long enough to talk to them, but Peter seemed to (and rightfully so, of course) avoid him like the plague, and Flash was constantly surrounded by his friends. Although Harley did not necessarily dislike the other boys, he felt that talking to Flash about their mistake in front of his friend might be humiliating for him, and ruining two persons\u2019 reputations by public humiliation in two days didn\u2019t seem like the kind of track record he\u2019d want to be aiming for at his new school. </p><p>Eventually, as he was taking his books out of his bag for his final class of the day, Flash leaned over and asked: \u201cHey, do you want to hang out after school? We can go to my place, if you want.\u201d </p><p>Harley thought about Tony, and how upset he had seemed that morning, no matter how hard he had tried to hide it. He thought about Happy, who did not do justice to his name, and seemed highly reluctant to pick him up from school. He thought about Flash, who\u2019s presence around him seemed to scare away students who came looking to mess with the \u2018new kid\u2019. The decision came easy.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, sounds great!\u201d He quickly whipped out his phone and sent a text of dismissal to Happy, before turning to smile at Flash, who was grinning back at him. </p><hr><p>Flash\u2019s car was really cool. Granted, it was his father\u2019s car, as he had admitted as soon as Harley stopped ranting about its beauty and luxury, but it didn\u2019t make it any less impressive to the other boy. The car took off with surprising speed as Flash turned onto the road, and Harley couldn\u2019t help but grin at the butterflies that appeared in his stomach as a result. Meanwhile, Flash was chatting nonstop. </p><p>\u201c\u2026 she was quite pretty, as well, but just didn\u2019t understand that that isn\u2019t how customer service works, you know? So, I was explaining this calmly to her as I was driving her to Homecoming, when all of a sudden Spider-Man appeared on the hood of my car!\u201d At the mention of the infamous Queens vigilante, Harley\u2019s attention snapped back to the other\u2019s words. </p><p>\u201cWoah, Spider-Man?\u201d Flash nodded with a shit-eating grin, obviously enjoying Harley\u2019s engagement in his story. </p><p>\u201cYeah, dude, Spider-Man! He had just saved my life a couple weeks earlier when I almost died in the elevator in the Washington Monument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in there?! I saw it on the news!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was really scary, but Spider-Man helped us out. It was a little weird, because Spider-Man usually only helps out in Queens, you know? And suddenly he was in DC, saving my ass. That\u2019s like, what? Four hours from NYC? A little out of his usual range, you know?\u201d Harley vaguely remember Spider-Man fighting in a German airport with Tony a while back, but chose not to mention it, instead nodding along to Flash\u2019s story.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d Harley almost wanted to laugh at the childlike question, but knew better, considering the other teen was sharing a story of when his life was in serious danger. He nodded again.</p><p>\u201cI think Spider-Man is in love with me.\u201d At that, Harley\u2019s head snapped up and he stared at Flash, his eyes wide, and a smile forming on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked incredulously. \u201cNo offence, dude, but why do you think Spider-Man is in love with you?\u201d Flash laughed, a blush forming on his face as he visibly grew embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man, I just\u2026 the coincidence of him constantly showing up where I am\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe he\u2019s not in love, maybe it\u2019s just a crush, but\u2026\u201d He sighed. \u201cWhat are the chances of him just picking my car out of everyone who was on the road in New York City that night, you know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPretty slim,\u201d Harley agreed, humouring Flash\u2019s thoughts. </p><p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like I have a crush on him, or anything,\u201d Flash hastily added, glancing towards Harley. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 you know, I don\u2019t do that stuff, but I just\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a weird thing to have told you. Forget I said anything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, dude, it\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Harley quickly assured him, his heart thundering in his chest as he took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m gay. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Flash glanced at him again, but his gaze lingered slightly, before turning back to the road.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d he muttered. \u201cOh, that\u2019s cool, dude, that\u2019s perfectly fine.\u201d Harley couldn\u2019t suppress his smile just as Flash pulled up to a big house in the New York suburbs, putting a code into the gate leading to a seemingly endless driveway to open it. </p><hr><p>Harley ended up spending hours at Flash\u2019s mansion (honestly, it was way too big to call a house. \u2018Castle\u2019 would have been more fitting), and couldn\u2019t deny having endless fun. They played Mario Kart and talking about Spider-Man, and school, and college, and family. Harley even ended up telling him about Jason. He was about to tell Flash about Tony, about meeting Iron Man, and being taken in by him years later, but then it hit him. What if Flash would think he was lying too? After such a vulnerable, yet fun afternoon, he didn\u2019t want to risk losing his friend to a misunderstanding like that. He would tell him, eventually, by showing him his home at the Avengers Compound, but in that moment, he chose to keep it to himself, and by doing so, also neglected to tell Flash about Peter\u2019s situation. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay getting home?\u201d Flash asked as he leaned against the gate that he was dropped Harley off at. \u201cIt\u2019s really no problem to drive you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Harley quickly responded. \u201cI\u2019ll walk to the closest bus stop and travel home by public transport.\u201d In reality, he had asked Tony to pick him up from there, but Flash really didn\u2019t need to know that. The latter nodded, and grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cGet home safe, dude,\u201d he said, as he walked away, waving his hand at the boy as he closed the gate behind him. Harley set off, his StarkPhone in hand as he manoeuvred his way through the winding street of suburban New York. The bus stop was supposed to only be a block away, and although his phone insistently told him to go straight ahead and turn left at the end, simply observation told him that the alley to his right would take him straight to the stop. He shrugged, and ducked into the alley, quickly making his way towards the light at the end, trying to shake the unreasonable anxiety that rose in his stomach. </p><p>\u201cSlow your stroll, asshole, unless you want some extra holes in that body of yours.\u201d Right\u2026 Not that unreasonable, then.<br></p>",

He wonders, over his head deep into his own teenage angst, whether the weather would continue to accurate reflect his mood all day, and sighed as the first rain drops started to splash onto the windshield. </p><p>&ldquo;Am I going to have to pick you up after school, kid?&rdquo; Harley could tell Happy was experimenting with how much reluctance he could passively make known to the teen, without outright saying it.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uh, probably,&rdquo; he replied honestly, not sure how else he would be finding his way back to the compound. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Happy sighed, &ldquo;that sounds like it might be no. Just text me if you change your mind.&rdquo; Harley simply nodded, not feeling up for giving an outright response. He wished he could have stayed home today, but Tony was quite insistent that he faced the music. &ldquo;Peter is not upset with you,&rdquo; he had pressed, but did not elaborate on why he knew this so certainly. On the one hand, he hoped nothing more than to encounter Peter as soon as possible today, so he could apologise and ask to start over. On the other hand&hellip; Peter had plenty of reason to hate him, and Harley wasn&rsquo;t sure if he would be up for a confrontation like that.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Happy?&rdquo; The man simply grunted in response, which Harley took as a sign that he was listening. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you know Peter Parker?&rdquo; Squinted eyes flickered in his direction, before immediately turning back to the road ahead. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, annoying little boy. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I- I just,&rdquo; Harley swallowed, &ldquo;I said some pretty mean things to him. I mean, I didn&rsquo;t know him, but&hellip; Yeah, I said some awful stuff, and I don&rsquo;t really know how to talk to him about it, you know?&rdquo; Happy&rsquo;s eyes flickered over again, although this time including a sceptically raised eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, kid,&rdquo; he spoke as he turned back to the windshield. &ldquo;There is no way to get rid of that Parker boy, and God knows I&rsquo;ve tried. You could probably punch him in the face and he would apologise for getting in the way of your fist. Just say you&rsquo;re sorry and give him some attention, and he&rsquo;ll be all over you. He&rsquo;s like a puppy that way.&rdquo; Is this also the case if you publically falsely accuse him in front of all his classmates, and then humiliate and bully him all day, Harley wanted to say, guilt sitting heavy in his abdomen. </p><p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; he, ever so eloquently, chose to say instead. He turned back to look outside, and noticed that they were pulling up on Midtown&rsquo;s parking lot. He grabbed his backpack from where he had put it between his legs, and unbuckled his seatbelt. He paused, with his hand on the door handle, and looked towards Happy. Fear and anticipation were rolling around his stomach, fighting a battle for dominance until they finally settled as a feeling of general anxiety. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you really think-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, can you save the heart-to-hearts for Tony?
