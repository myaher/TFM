This is essentially fanfic research, and for that it\u2019s always best to go back to the original source.</p><p>So if this is a Jon and Sansa reread why am I starting with a Bran chapter? Because while on the surface Bran I is about Bran, it\u2019s also equally about introducing the male side of the Starks and so has a lot of valuable insight into Jon\u2019s character. It\u2019s also one of my favorite chapters in the series for just how sparse and laconic Martin\u2019s style is throughout.</p><blockquote><p><i>The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king\u2019s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran\u2019s life.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is such a great hook to open a chapter and the book as a whole with and ticks a lot of important boxes in just a paragraph: the setting, Bran\u2019s age and state of mind, and a good hook. Who is being beheaded? Why is he being beheaded? Why is a child going to go see it? As a writer you almost always want to have an underlying tension or question that the reader wants answered to drive them forwards.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bran\u2019s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \u201cKeep the pony well in hand,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd don\u2019t look away. Father will know if you do.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s interesting Martin has Jon play the role of older brother here rather than Robb. Despite his half-brother bastard status Jon is clearly close with Bran, as we\u2019ll see later when he visits Bran\u2019s bedside after he falls. He doesn\u2019t coddle Bran though; partly this is to emphasize the Stark coldness, but also I think it\u2019s an insight into Jon\u2019s character.</p><p>There\u2019s a recurring thread through these early chapters that Jon doesn\u2019t have quite the same leeway as the true born Starks in Winterfell. He\u2019s probably especially sensitive to disappointing Ned. After all, his existence at all is already an embarrassment and spot on Ned\u2019s honor.</p><!-- more --><blockquote><p><i>Bran\u2019s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father\u2019s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.</i></p></blockquote><p>As Ned\u2019s son Jon does exactly this in ADWD when he has to don his own Lord Commander face. While in this chapter we don\u2019t get to see into Ned\u2019s head, in ASOS and ADWD we\u2019ll see just how much it costs Jon to maintain the cold Lord Stark persona both personally and politically when he makes Gilly touch the fire and give up her child, or forces Sam to travel south, or demands child hostages from the Wildlings to cross the Wall.</p><p>Jon\u2019s cold practically is an aspect of his character that doesn\u2019t really get explored much in fanfic, or even really included at all. There\u2019s a couple reasons for it, I think. First, even if they have read the books, the show\u2019s presentation of Jon tends to be what sticks in most people\u2019s heads, and the show has definite habit of softening and whitewashing Jon\u2019s character so he can be the Hero, not to mention Kit Harington\u2019s constantly plaintive look.</p><p>Second, I think a lot of fic writers prefer to have Sansa be the cold hard one (which is also a show invention, but we\u2019ll get into that later) paired with Jon as the emotionally softer one. Which is fair. I love that contrast and dynamic. But I do wish we got a little more examination and exploration of the parallels between how they both got to their Stark face and how they interact now.</p><blockquote><p><i>The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy\u2019s feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. \u201cAss,\u201d Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\u2019s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. \u201cYou did well,\u201d Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.</i></p></blockquote><p>Just in case you were wondering if Theon was a terrible person or not.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe deserter died bravely,\u201d Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\u2019s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \u201cHe had courage, at the least.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon Snow said quietly. \u201cIt was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.\u201d Jon\u2019s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon calling Robb \u201cStark\u201d here is interesting for a couple reasons. Partly this is just Martin trying to set up really quickly for the reader Jon\u2019s bastard status; even Arya, who Jon is closest to, will in her inner narration call him her half-brother quite a bit. But it also signals a kind of a acknowledged formal space between Jon and the other Starklings, even if it\u2019s one they\u2019re used to.</p><blockquote><p><i>Robb was not impressed. \u201cThe Others take his eyes,\u201d he swore. \u201cHe died well.

It\u2019s a bit of a cheap shot at Theon to make us like Jon more as a character, but is also very in line with his character. Very rarely even in later books does Jon react emotionally to things (with a few exceptions like when he tries to murder Alliser Thorne); he tends not to from a place of emotion and almost always takes time to think things through. The reason for this is Jon is calm because he has to be. It\u2019s a result of his marginalized status in the Stark household.

Theon as a whole is a really interesting foil to Jon; irreverent where Jon is serious, emotional where Jon is calm, dismissive where Jon is willing to learn about others.</p><p>They both have outsider status in the Stark household, but instead of bonding, Theon is significantly closer to Robb. While Jon does have privilege, Theon has more (he is the Greyjoy heir after all) and more importantly, has internalized it far more. It makes sense that aside from just personality differences Theon would think himself above Jon and be drawn to Robb as a source of privilege.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cBorn with the dead,\u201d another man put in. \u201cWorse luck.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo matter,\u201d said Hullen. \u201cThey be dead soon enough too.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe sooner the better,\u201d Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \u201cGive the beast here, Bran.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>In case you had any doubt Theon is in fact the worst, here we have him enthusiastically ready to commit puppy murder.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cLord Stark,\u201d Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. \u201cThere are five pups,\u201d he told Father. \u201cThree male, two female.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat of it, Jon?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou have five trueborn children,\u201d Jon said. \u201cThree sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran saw his father\u2019s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</i></p><p><i>Their father understood as well. \u201cYou want no pup for yourself, Jon?\u201d he asked softly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\u201d Jon pointed out. \u201cI am no Stark, Father.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>I don\u2019t have a lot to say about this passage, but it\u2019s a good example of Jon choosing to do the right thing despite how it won\u2019t benefit him and also show just how much he loves his siblings that he\u2019s willing to do this for them.</p><blockquote><p><i>Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat is it, Jon?\u201d their lord father asked.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan\u2019t you hear it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere,\u201d Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe must have crawled away from the others,\u201d Jon said.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOr been driven away,\u201d their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is such a powerful moment to me. Remember that of all the direwolves Ghost never growls or howls or makes any sound at all. And yet Jon hears him somehow. Even though we just met Jon we understand by this point just how left out Jon feels, and here he has a creature that wants him, needs him, loves him. Later when Jon makes the decision to refuse Stannis\u2019 offer of legitimization we\u2019ll see just how much Ghost means to him.</p><p>(I\u2019m not bitter about how the show forgets about Ghost and all the direwolves for long periods. Really. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s fine.)</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAn albino,\u201d Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. \u201cThis one will die even faster than the others.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon Snow gave his father\u2019s ward a long, chilling look. \u201cI think not, Greyjoy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one belongs to me.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cI think not, Greyjoy\u201d is low-key my favorite line of the series as a whole, and I hate that they cut it from the show. Instead Theon says Ghost is the run of the litter and Jon gives Theon a look that\u2019s neither long nor chilling and actually feels more like he\u2019s slightly annoyed that Theon is right. It goes back to the difference of how the show softens Jon and casts him more as the reluctant and slightly dense Hero instead of sharp and smart and slightly vicious at times.</p><p>That\u2019s largely it for Bran I. Overall it\u2019s a really great insight into Jon\u2019s character and his place in the Stark household while also setting up character threads later chapters will pick up. Speaking of, next up will be Jon I, in which Jon gets drunk and talks with Tyrion.

His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father\u2019s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.</i></p></blockquote><p>As Ned\u2019s son Jon does exactly this in ADWD when he has to don his own Lord Commander face. While in this chapter we don\u2019t get to see into Ned\u2019s head, in ASOS and ADWD we\u2019ll see just how much it costs Jon to maintain the cold Lord Stark persona both personally and politically when he makes Gilly touch the fire and give up her child, or forces Sam to travel south, or demands child hostages from the Wildlings to cross the Wall.</p><p>Jon\u2019s cold practically is an aspect of his character that doesn\u2019t really get explored much in fanfic, or even really included at all. There\u2019s a couple reasons for it, I think. First, even if they have read the books, the show\u2019s presentation of Jon tends to be what sticks in most people\u2019s heads, and the show has definite habit of softening and whitewashing Jon\u2019s character so he can be the Hero, not to mention Kit Harington\u2019s constantly plaintive look.</p><p>Second, I think a lot of fic writers prefer to have Sansa be the cold hard one (which is also a show invention, but we\u2019ll get into that later) paired with Jon as the emotionally softer one. Which is fair. I love that contrast and dynamic. But I do wish we got a little more examination and exploration of the parallels between how they both got to their Stark face and how they interact now.</p><blockquote><p><i>The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy\u2019s feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. \u201cAss,\u201d Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\u2019s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. \u201cYou did well,\u201d Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.</i></p></blockquote><p>Just in case you were wondering if Theon was a terrible person or not.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe deserter died bravely,\u201d Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\u2019s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \u201cHe had courage, at the least.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon Snow said quietly. \u201cIt was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.\u201d Jon\u2019s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon calling Robb \u201cStark\u201d here is interesting for a couple reasons. Partly this is just Martin trying to set up really quickly for the reader Jon\u2019s bastard status; even Arya, who Jon is closest to, will in her inner narration call him her half-brother quite a bit. But it also signals a kind of a acknowledged formal space between Jon and the other Starklings, even if it\u2019s one they\u2019re used to.</p><blockquote><p><i>Robb was not impressed. \u201cThe Others take his eyes,\u201d he swore. \u201cHe died well.

Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.</i></p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s a really chilling kind of casualness to the older boys\u2019 reaction to the execution.

It makes sense that aside from just personality differences Theon would think himself above Jon and be drawn to Robb as a source of privilege.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cBorn with the dead,\u201d another man put in. \u201cWorse luck.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo matter,\u201d said Hullen. \u201cThey be dead soon enough too.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe sooner the better,\u201d Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \u201cGive the beast here, Bran.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>In case you had any doubt Theon is in fact the worst, here we have him enthusiastically ready to commit puppy murder.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cLord Stark,\u201d Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. \u201cThere are five pups,\u201d he told Father. \u201cThree male, two female.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat of it, Jon?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou have five trueborn children,\u201d Jon said. \u201cThree sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran saw his father\u2019s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</i></p><p><i>Their father understood as well. \u201cYou want no pup for yourself, Jon?\u201d he asked softly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\u201d Jon pointed out. \u201cI am no Stark, Father.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>I don\u2019t have a lot to say about this passage, but it\u2019s a good example of Jon choosing to do the right thing despite how it won\u2019t benefit him and also show just how much he loves his siblings that he\u2019s willing to do this for them.</p><blockquote><p><i>Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat is it, Jon?\u201d their lord father asked.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan\u2019t you hear it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere,\u201d Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe must have crawled away from the others,\u201d Jon said.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOr been driven away,\u201d their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is such a powerful moment to me. Remember that of all the direwolves Ghost never growls or howls or makes any sound at all. And yet Jon hears him somehow. Even though we just met Jon we understand by this point just how left out Jon feels, and here he has a creature that wants him, needs him, loves him. Later when Jon makes the decision to refuse Stannis\u2019 offer of legitimization we\u2019ll see just how much Ghost means to him.</p><p>(I\u2019m not bitter about how the show forgets about Ghost and all the direwolves for long periods. Really. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s fine.)</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAn albino,\u201d Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. \u201cThis one will die even faster than the others.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon Snow gave his father\u2019s ward a long, chilling look. \u201cI think not, Greyjoy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one belongs to me.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cI think not, Greyjoy\u201d is low-key my favorite line of the series as a whole, and I hate that they cut it from the show. Instead Theon says Ghost is the run of the litter and Jon gives Theon a look that\u2019s neither long nor chilling and actually feels more like he\u2019s slightly annoyed that Theon is right. It goes back to the difference of how the show softens Jon and casts him more as the reluctant and slightly dense Hero instead of sharp and smart and slightly vicious at times.</p><p>That\u2019s largely it for Bran I. Overall it\u2019s a really great insight into Jon\u2019s character and his place in the Stark household while also setting up character threads later chapters will pick up.

This is essentially fanfic research, and for that it\u2019s always best to go back to the original source.</p><p>So if this is a Jon and Sansa reread why am I starting with a Bran chapter? Because while on the surface Bran I is about Bran, it\u2019s also equally about introducing the male side of the Starks and so has a lot of valuable insight into Jon\u2019s character. It\u2019s also one of my favorite chapters in the series for just how sparse and laconic Martin\u2019s style is throughout.</p><blockquote><p><i>The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king\u2019s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran\u2019s life.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is such a great hook to open a chapter and the book as a whole with and ticks a lot of important boxes in just a paragraph: the setting, Bran\u2019s age and state of mind, and a good hook. Who is being beheaded? Why is he being beheaded? Why is a child going to go see it? As a writer you almost always want to have an underlying tension or question that the reader wants answered to drive them forwards.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bran\u2019s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \u201cKeep the pony well in hand,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd don\u2019t look away. Father will know if you do.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s interesting Martin has Jon play the role of older brother here rather than Robb. Despite his half-brother bastard status Jon is clearly close with Bran, as we\u2019ll see later when he visits Bran\u2019s bedside after he falls. He doesn\u2019t coddle Bran though; partly this is to emphasize the Stark coldness, but also I think it\u2019s an insight into Jon\u2019s character.</p><p>There\u2019s a recurring thread through these early chapters that Jon doesn\u2019t have quite the same leeway as the true born Starks in Winterfell. He\u2019s probably especially sensitive to disappointing Ned. After all, his existence at all is already an embarrassment and spot on Ned\u2019s honor.</p>[[MORE]]<blockquote><p><i>Bran\u2019s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father\u2019s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.</i></p></blockquote><p>As Ned\u2019s son Jon does exactly this in ADWD when he has to don his own Lord Commander face. While in this chapter we don\u2019t get to see into Ned\u2019s head, in ASOS and ADWD we\u2019ll see just how much it costs Jon to maintain the cold Lord Stark persona both personally and politically when he makes Gilly touch the fire and give up her child, or forces Sam to travel south, or demands child hostages from the Wildlings to cross the Wall.</p><p>Jon\u2019s cold practically is an aspect of his character that doesn\u2019t really get explored much in fanfic, or even really included at all. There\u2019s a couple reasons for it, I think. First, even if they have read the books, the show\u2019s presentation of Jon tends to be what sticks in most people\u2019s heads, and the show has definite habit of softening and whitewashing Jon\u2019s character so he can be the Hero, not to mention Kit Harington\u2019s constantly plaintive look.</p><p>Second, I think a lot of fic writers prefer to have Sansa be the cold hard one (which is also a show invention, but we\u2019ll get into that later) paired with Jon as the emotionally softer one. Which is fair. I love that contrast and dynamic. But I do wish we got a little more examination and exploration of the parallels between how they both got to their Stark face and how they interact now.</p><blockquote><p><i>The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy\u2019s feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. \u201cAss,\u201d Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\u2019s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. \u201cYou did well,\u201d Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.</i></p></blockquote><p>Just in case you were wondering if Theon was a terrible person or not.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe deserter died bravely,\u201d Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\u2019s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \u201cHe had courage, at the least.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon Snow said quietly. \u201cIt was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.\u201d Jon\u2019s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon calling Robb \u201cStark\u201d here is interesting for a couple reasons. Partly this is just Martin trying to set up really quickly for the reader Jon\u2019s bastard status; even Arya, who Jon is closest to, will in her inner narration call him her half-brother quite a bit. But it also signals a kind of a acknowledged formal space between Jon and the other Starklings, even if it\u2019s one they\u2019re used to.</p><blockquote><p><i>Robb was not impressed. \u201cThe Others take his eyes,\u201d he swore. \u201cHe died well. Race you to the bridge?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDone,\u201d Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.</i></p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s a really chilling kind of casualness to the older boys\u2019 reaction to the execution. Even Jon who treats it more seriously than Theon is still able to shift modes easily. Part of this I think is just <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness\" target=\"_blank\">early installment weirdness</a>, but it also nicely shoves the reader into the medieval mindset of westeros in a way that the show never quite achieves. Though it\u2019s underrated, the underlying medieval mindset is one of the key differences between books and show and causes havoc in later seasons as the showrunners have to adjust and soften character to make them more palatable to a modern audience while not changing the underlying actions themselves. It creates a sort of cognitive dissonance and some of the themes logical coherence slip through the crack.</p><p>The contrast between Robb laughing and Jon silent and intent is a great character detail. Robb isn\u2019t taking this as seriously as Jon, because Jon takes everything seriously. He has to. It\u2019s another way his bastard status influences his personality. Robb can lose and he\u2019ll still be lord of Winterfell one day. Jon? Not so much. So this is how Jon treats everything in his life: seriously. It\u2019s a also a bit of a childhood and teenager thing.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bran thought about it. \u201cCan a man still be brave if he\u2019s afraid?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat is the only time a man can be brave,\u201d his father told him.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the clearest articulations of Martin\u2019s ethos and the theme in all of his work, but especially ASOIAF, of existential heroism. When we talk about Jon as a hero, it\u2019s that which makes him one in the end, not the magical sword or rags to riches; when it comes down to it he does the right thing no matter how much it costs him personally (ASOS) or materially (ADWD). It\u2019s also one of the themes the show completely misses, instead espousing that being honorable makes you stupid.</p><blockquote><p><i>His lord father smiled. \u201cOld Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night\u2019s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran had no answer for that. \u201cKing Robert has a headsman,\u201d he said, uncertainly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe does,\u201d his father admitted. \u201cAs did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man\u2019s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOne day, Bran, you will be Robb\u2019s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>This has been explored more and better in other meta, but the Starks and the north in general has a far more personal view of justice and governing than the south. This isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s better, but it is different. Later as Lord Commander we\u2019ll see just how much of that ethos Jon picked up from Ned: in beheading Janos Slynt, in the mission creep at Hardhome, and in his failure to really use his institutional power to make changes to the Night\u2019s Watch. There\u2019s a strong sense of personal responsibility and connections in northern governance.</p><blockquote><p><i>Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman\u2019s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father\u2019s kennel.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s no freak,\u201d Jon said calmly. \u201cThat\u2019s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Theon Greyjoy said, \u201cThere\u2019s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see one now,\u201d Jon replied.</i></p></blockquote><p>Notice how calm is Jon with Theon here. It\u2019s a bit of a cheap shot at Theon to make us like Jon more as a character, but is also very in line with his character. Very rarely even in later books does Jon react emotionally to things (with a few exceptions like when he tries to murder Alliser Thorne); he tends not to from a place of emotion and almost always takes time to think things through. The reason for this is Jon is calm because he has to be. It\u2019s a result of his marginalized status in the Stark household. There\u2019s no leeway in his bastard position for emotional outbursts: Catelyn isn\u2019t going to put up with that shit, and he\u2019s already enough of an embarrassment to Ned just by existing.</p><p>While we don\u2019t ever really get much thought from either Jon or Theon about their relationship with each other, their interaction in this chapter is I think indicative of it as a whole; slightly adversarial and only cordial because of their mutual friendship with Robb. Theon as a whole is a really interesting foil to Jon; irreverent where Jon is serious, emotional where Jon is calm, dismissive where Jon is willing to learn about others.</p><p>They both have outsider status in the Stark household, but instead of bonding, Theon is significantly closer to Robb. While Jon does have privilege, Theon has more (he is the Greyjoy heir after all) and more importantly, has internalized it far more. It makes sense that aside from just personality differences Theon would think himself above Jon and be drawn to Robb as a source of privilege.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cBorn with the dead,\u201d another man put in. \u201cWorse luck.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo matter,\u201d said Hullen. \u201cThey be dead soon enough too.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe sooner the better,\u201d Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \u201cGive the beast here, Bran.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>In case you had any doubt Theon is in fact the worst, here we have him enthusiastically ready to commit puppy murder.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cLord Stark,\u201d Jon said.

It goes back to the difference of how the show softens Jon and casts him more as the reluctant and slightly dense Hero instead of sharp and smart and slightly vicious at times.</p><p>That\u2019s largely it for Bran I. Overall it\u2019s a really great insight into Jon\u2019s character and his place in the Stark household while also setting up character threads later chapters will pick up. Speaking of, next up will be Jon I, in which Jon gets drunk and talks with Tyrion.

This is essentially fanfic research, and for that it&rsquo;s always best to go back to the original source.</p><p>So if this is a Jon and Sansa reread why am I starting with a Bran chapter? Because while on the surface Bran I is about Bran, it&rsquo;s also equally about introducing the male side of the Starks and so has a lot of valuable insight into Jon&rsquo;s character. It&rsquo;s also one of my favorite chapters in the series for just how sparse and laconic Martin&rsquo;s style is throughout.</p><blockquote><p><i>The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king&rsquo;s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran&rsquo;s life.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is such a great hook to open a chapter and the book as a whole with and ticks a lot of important boxes in just a paragraph: the setting, Bran&rsquo;s age and state of mind, and a good hook. Who is being beheaded? Why is he being beheaded? Why is a child going to go see it? As a writer you almost always want to have an underlying tension or question that the reader wants answered to drive them forwards.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bran&rsquo;s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. &ldquo;Keep the pony well in hand,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t look away. Father will know if you do.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s interesting Martin has Jon play the role of older brother here rather than Robb. Despite his half-brother bastard status Jon is clearly close with Bran, as we&rsquo;ll see later when he visits Bran&rsquo;s bedside after he falls. He doesn&rsquo;t coddle Bran though; partly this is to emphasize the Stark coldness, but also I think it&rsquo;s an insight into Jon&rsquo;s character.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a recurring thread through these early chapters that Jon doesn&rsquo;t have quite the same leeway as the true born Starks in Winterfell. He&rsquo;s probably especially sensitive to disappointing Ned. After all, his existence at all is already an embarrassment and spot on Ned&rsquo;s honor.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bran&rsquo;s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father&rsquo;s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.</i></p></blockquote><p>As Ned&rsquo;s son Jon does exactly this in ADWD when he has to don his own Lord Commander face. While in this chapter we don&rsquo;t get to see into Ned&rsquo;s head, in ASOS and ADWD we&rsquo;ll see just how much it costs Jon to maintain the cold Lord Stark persona both personally and politically when he makes Gilly touch the fire and give up her child, or forces Sam to travel south, or demands child hostages from the Wildlings to cross the Wall.</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s cold practically is an aspect of his character that doesn&rsquo;t really get explored much in fanfic, or even really included at all. There&rsquo;s a couple reasons for it, I think. First, even if they have read the books, the show&rsquo;s presentation of Jon tends to be what sticks in most people&rsquo;s heads, and the show has definite habit of softening and whitewashing Jon&rsquo;s character so he can be the Hero, not to mention Kit Harington&rsquo;s constantly plaintive look.</p><p>Second, I think a lot of fic writers prefer to have Sansa be the cold hard one (which is also a show invention, but we&rsquo;ll get into that later) paired with Jon as the emotionally softer one. Which is fair. I love that contrast and dynamic. But I do wish we got a little more examination and exploration of the parallels between how they both got to their Stark face and how they interact now.</p><blockquote><p><i>The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy&rsquo;s feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. &ldquo;Ass,&rdquo; Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran&rsquo;s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. &ldquo;You did well,&rdquo; Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.</i></p></blockquote><p>Just in case you were wondering if Theon was a terrible person or not.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;The deserter died bravely,&rdquo; Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother&rsquo;s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. &ldquo;He had courage, at the least.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jon Snow said quietly. &ldquo;It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon calling Robb &ldquo;Stark&rdquo; here is interesting for a couple reasons. Partly this is just Martin trying to set up really quickly for the reader Jon&rsquo;s bastard status; even Arya, who Jon is closest to, will in her inner narration call him her half-brother quite a bit. But it also signals a kind of a acknowledged formal space between Jon and the other Starklings, even if it&rsquo;s one they&rsquo;re used to.</p><blockquote><p><i>Robb was not impressed. &ldquo;The Others take his eyes,&rdquo; he swore. &ldquo;He died well. Race you to the bridge?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.</i></p></blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s a really chilling kind of casualness to the older boys&rsquo; reaction to the execution. Even Jon who treats it more seriously than Theon is still able to shift modes easily. Part of this I think is just <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness\" target=\"_blank\">early installment weirdness</a>, but it also nicely shoves the reader into the medieval mindset of westeros in a way that the show never quite achieves. Though it&rsquo;s underrated, the underlying medieval mindset is one of the key differences between books and show and causes havoc in later seasons as the showrunners have to adjust and soften character to make them more palatable to a modern audience while not changing the underlying actions themselves. It creates a sort of cognitive dissonance and some of the themes logical coherence slip through the crack.</p><p>The contrast between Robb laughing and Jon silent and intent is a great character detail. Robb isn&rsquo;t taking this as seriously as Jon, because Jon takes everything seriously. He has to. It&rsquo;s another way his bastard status influences his personality. Robb can lose and he&rsquo;ll still be lord of Winterfell one day. Jon? Not so much. So this is how Jon treats everything in his life: seriously. It&rsquo;s a also a bit of a childhood and teenager thing.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bran thought about it. &ldquo;Can a man still be brave if he&rsquo;s afraid?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That is the only time a man can be brave,&rdquo; his father told him.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the clearest articulations of Martin&rsquo;s ethos and the theme in all of his work, but especially ASOIAF, of existential heroism. When we talk about Jon as a hero, it&rsquo;s that which makes him one in the end, not the magical sword or rags to riches; when it comes down to it he does the right thing no matter how much it costs him personally (ASOS) or materially (ADWD). It&rsquo;s also one of the themes the show completely misses, instead espousing that being honorable makes you stupid.</p><blockquote><p><i>His lord father smiled. &ldquo;Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night&rsquo;s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bran had no answer for that. &ldquo;King Robert has a headsman,&rdquo; he said, uncertainly.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He does,&rdquo; his father admitted. &ldquo;As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man&rsquo;s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;One day, Bran, you will be Robb&rsquo;s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>This has been explored more and better in other meta, but the Starks and the north in general has a far more personal view of justice and governing than the south. This isn&rsquo;t to say it&rsquo;s better, but it is different. Later as Lord Commander we&rsquo;ll see just how much of that ethos Jon picked up from Ned: in beheading Janos Slynt, in the mission creep at Hardhome, and in his failure to really use his institutional power to make changes to the Night&rsquo;s Watch. There&rsquo;s a strong sense of personal responsibility and connections in northern governance.</p><blockquote><p><i>Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman&rsquo;s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father&rsquo;s kennel.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no freak,&rdquo; Jon said calmly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Theon Greyjoy said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I see one now,&rdquo; Jon replied.</i></p></blockquote><p>Notice how calm is Jon with Theon here. It&rsquo;s a bit of a cheap shot at Theon to make us like Jon more as a character, but is also very in line with his character. Very rarely even in later books does Jon react emotionally to things (with a few exceptions like when he tries to murder Alliser Thorne); he tends not to from a place of emotion and almost always takes time to think things through. The reason for this is Jon is calm because he has to be. It&rsquo;s a result of his marginalized status in the Stark household. There&rsquo;s no leeway in his bastard position for emotional outbursts: Catelyn isn&rsquo;t going to put up with that shit, and he&rsquo;s already enough of an embarrassment to Ned just by existing.</p><p>While we don&rsquo;t ever really get much thought from either Jon or Theon about their relationship with each other, their interaction in this chapter is I think indicative of it as a whole; slightly adversarial and only cordial because of their mutual friendship with Robb. Theon as a whole is a really interesting foil to Jon; irreverent where Jon is serious, emotional where Jon is calm, dismissive where Jon is willing to learn about others.</p><p>They both have outsider status in the Stark household, but instead of bonding, Theon is significantly closer to Robb. While Jon does have privilege, Theon has more (he is the Greyjoy heir after all) and more importantly, has internalized it far more. It makes sense that aside from just personality differences Theon would think himself above Jon and be drawn to Robb as a source of privilege.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Born with the dead,&rdquo; another man put in. &ldquo;Worse luck.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said Hullen. &ldquo;They be dead soon enough too.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. &ldquo;Give the beast here, Bran.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>In case you had any doubt Theon is in fact the worst, here we have him enthusiastically ready to commit puppy murder.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Lord Stark,&rdquo; Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. &ldquo;There are five pups,&rdquo; he told Father. &ldquo;Three male, two female.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What of it, Jon?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You have five trueborn children,&rdquo; Jon said. &ldquo;Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bran saw his father&rsquo;s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</i></p><p><i>Their father understood as well. &ldquo;You want no pup for yourself, Jon?&rdquo; he asked softly.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,&rdquo; Jon pointed out. &ldquo;I am no Stark, Father.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t have a lot to say about this passage, but it&rsquo;s a good example of Jon choosing to do the right thing despite how it won&rsquo;t benefit him and also show just how much he loves his siblings that he&rsquo;s willing to do this for them.</p><blockquote><p><i>Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What is it, Jon?&rdquo; their lord father asked.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear it?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He must have crawled away from the others,&rdquo; Jon said.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Or been driven away,&rdquo; their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is such a powerful moment to me. Remember that of all the direwolves Ghost never growls or howls or makes any sound at all. And yet Jon hears him somehow. Even though we just met Jon we understand by this point just how left out Jon feels, and here he has a creature that wants him, needs him, loves him. Later when Jon makes the decision to refuse Stannis&rsquo; offer of legitimization we&rsquo;ll see just how much Ghost means to him.</p><p>(I&rsquo;m not bitter about how the show forgets about Ghost and all the direwolves for long periods. Really. It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m fine. It&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m fine. It&rsquo;s fine.)</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;An albino,&rdquo; Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. &ldquo;This one will die even faster than the others.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Jon Snow gave his father&rsquo;s ward a long, chilling look. &ldquo;I think not, Greyjoy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This one belongs to me.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think not, Greyjoy&rdquo; is low-key my favorite line of the series as a whole, and I hate that they cut it from the show. Instead Theon says Ghost is the run of the litter and Jon gives Theon a look that&rsquo;s neither long nor chilling and actually feels more like he&rsquo;s slightly annoyed that Theon is right. It goes back to the difference of how the show softens Jon and casts him more as the reluctant and slightly dense Hero instead of sharp and smart and slightly vicious at times.</p><p>That&rsquo;s largely it for Bran I.
