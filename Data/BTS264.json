This was the third time today that he had come to yell at you for messing up some documents. You were sort of new at this job, so you had asked your co-worker, Matt, for some help. But turning around to look at him, you were only met with a knowing smirk. Matt looked you up and down, chuckling as he turned back to his computer. Forcing your tears away, you turned back to fix the documents your boss had slammed on the table.<br/></p><p>\u201c(Y/N)! Wanna come play video games with us?\u201d Jimin asked as you walked through the door. You were finally home after fixing all of your mistakes on today\u2019s cases. Your head pounded as you dragged your feet to the living room. Jungkook, Jimin, Taehyung, and Hoseok were all sitting on the couch ready to start a game of Mario Kart. And normally, you would love to join them, but you didn\u2019t feel well enough to play today. Your boss\u2019s scolding running through your head on repeat.</p><p>Smiling weakly, you shook your head.\u00a0\u201cSorry Chim, not today.\u201d You went to go to your room only to bump into Jin in the hallway.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry (Y/N), didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d You gave yet another weak smile as you nodded, telling him not to worry.\u00a0\u201cUm, are you tired?\u201d Jin looked worried as he looked at your appearance. Your eyes were bloodshot, your shoulders slumped and all of your movements seemed to be sluggish. You nodded, not wanting to speak aloud for some reason. Jin slowly nodded before letting you walk to your room. But as you closed the door to your room, Jin couldn\u2019t help but wonder what was wrong.</p><p>This week has been pure torture. You had made so many mistakes at work and not to mention the fact that Matt was personally out to get you. A rumor about how you slept with the interviewer to get this position, was now floating around the office. And Matt always seemed to be at the center of the gossip. With everything going on you just felt like everything was crashing down. What did you do to deserve this? Were you really that much of a screw-up?\u00a0</p><p>And to top it all off, your weekly evaluation with your boss was today, and you were dreading it beyond belief. After scolding you on every single mistake you\u2019ve made, he dropped the bomb.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N), one more mistake and you\u2019re fired. We can\u2019t have anymore mistakes, do you understand? Ask Matt for help instead of doing whatever you want and ruining everything!\u201d You kept hearing his voice over and over again as you drove home. A few tears slipped out onto your cheeks as you parked in the driveway.</p><p><i>Why? Why did you make so many mistakes? Why did you have to be the one to get yelled at? Why was Matt making those rumors about you? Why did your boss assume Matt was the best worker ever when he was trying to ruin you? </i>You\u00a0banged your head against the steering wheel, letting the tears flow down to the carpet. You didn\u2019t know what to do, you were helpless and you were about to lose your job.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N), pull yourself together.\u201d You whispered to yourself before wiping your tears and getting out of the car. You made sure there were no tears left on your face before heading inside. The boys were always so caring, but you didn\u2019t want to bother them with this. This was all your fault and you had to deal with yourself.</p><p>Walking past the kitchen, you could see that all the boys were already having dinner at the table. Yoongi was the first one to see you at the door, giving you a soft smile.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N), how was work? Come sit down.\u201d He waved you over as all the other boys turned to you, excited for you to be back.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m not very hungry. I\u2019m just gonna go to my room.\u201d Everyone frowned slightly, looking at one another before Namjoon spoke up.<br/></p><p>\u201c(Y/N) are you sure you\u2019re okay? You\u2019ve just seemed a little down this week.\u201d He spoke slowly as to not upset you, but you could already feel your throat closing up and the tears trying to push past your eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Running to your room, you slammed the door. Tears poured out as you threw yourself onto your bed. You let out a scream into your pillow as you let the heavy sobs leave your lips, tears soaking your pillowcase.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHave you guys noticed anything wrong with (Y/N) this week?\u201d Jin stood up from the table, placing the dirty plates into the sink.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s been a little off. I hope everything\u2019s okay.\u201d Jungkook frowned as he looked down at the table. The other boys nodded in agreement before all standing up to head to the living room.<br/></p><p>\u201cDo you think we should check on her?\u201d Hoseok asked, he really wanted to make sure everything was okay, but Namjoon shook his head.<br/></p><p>\u201cI think we better let her have some time alone. We\u2019ll check on her later. Who knows, maybe she\u2019s just been really tired this week?\u201d He didn\u2019t believe it himself, and neither did the other boys, but they agreed regardless. Jimin however couldn\u2019t get your face out of his mind. He knew something was wrong, so he told the boys he was going to the bathroom before going to your check on you.<br/></p><p>Sobs and screams could be heard from the other side of your door. His heart broke as he ran to get the others. The boys all turned to see Jimin panting as he pointed upstairs. A frown was glued to his face as he spoke.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)\u2019s crying.\u201d Not another word was said before everyone ran to your room. Namjoon, quickly unlocked the door, letting everyone pile into the room. You turned, face red and wet with tears. Their hearts broke. You were always so happy and caring, you always noticed when something was wrong. But this week you seemed so quiet and lonely.</p><p>Taehyung ran to your bed, embracing you as tears fell from his eyes. Jimin and Jungkook were on the verge of tears as they joined the embrace. The older boys all stood by your bed, their hearts shattering as they watched you cry into Taehyung\u2019s arms.</p><p>An hour had passed when you were finally calm enough to talk. The boys all sat around you on your bed as you explained what happened. From the mistakes, to your boss, to Matt, and to how you were about to lose your job. They all listened patiently as you spoke, and when you were done Hoseok was the first to speak up.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell us?\u201d He frowned, upset that you had gone through so much this week with no support from anyone. You shook your head sadly at them.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, I didn\u2019t want you guys to have to listen to all my problems. I just couldn\u2019t get anything right.\u201d Taehyung suddenly grabbed your shoulders, his expression full of anger now.<br/></p><p>\u201c(Y/N)! This is not your fault! Everyone makes mistakes, and your co-worker is just a jerk. None of this is your fault.\u201d He stared deeply into your eyes. You smiled weakly before letting out a soft laugh.<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks Tae.\u201d Looking around you could see all the boys smiling at you, happy to see a smile on your face for the first time this week. You should\u2019ve told them earlier. You never expected to become this close with your roommates, but over time they had become your best friends, your family. And looking around now, you could see that they cared about you just as much as you cared about them.<br/></p><p>\u201cGROUP HUG!\u201d Jimin yelled out before tackling you into a tight embrace. The other boys laughed before hugging you as well. You laughed trying to hug everyone back before you all fell off of the bed.

This was the third time today that he had come to yell at you for messing up some documents. You were sort of new at this job, so you had asked your co-worker, Matt, for some help. But turning around to look at him, you were only met with a knowing smirk. Matt looked you up and down, chuckling as he turned back to his computer. Forcing your tears away, you turned back to fix the documents your boss had slammed on the table.<br></p><p>\u201c(Y/N)! Wanna come play video games with us?\u201d Jimin asked as you walked through the door. You were finally home after fixing all of your mistakes on today\u2019s cases. Your head pounded as you dragged your feet to the living room. Jungkook, Jimin, Taehyung, and Hoseok were all sitting on the couch ready to start a game of Mario Kart. And normally, you would love to join them, but you didn\u2019t feel well enough to play today. Your boss\u2019s scolding running through your head on repeat.</p><p>Smiling weakly, you shook your head.\u00a0\u201cSorry Chim, not today.\u201d You went to go to your room only to bump into Jin in the hallway.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry (Y/N), didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d You gave yet another weak smile as you nodded, telling him not to worry.\u00a0\u201cUm, are you tired?\u201d Jin looked worried as he looked at your appearance. Your eyes were bloodshot, your shoulders slumped and all of your movements seemed to be sluggish. You nodded, not wanting to speak aloud for some reason. Jin slowly nodded before letting you walk to your room. But as you closed the door to your room, Jin couldn\u2019t help but wonder what was wrong.</p><p>This week has been pure torture. You had made so many mistakes at work and not to mention the fact that Matt was personally out to get you. A rumor about how you slept with the interviewer to get this position, was now floating around the office. And Matt always seemed to be at the center of the gossip. With everything going on you just felt like everything was crashing down. What did you do to deserve this? Were you really that much of a screw-up?\u00a0</p><p>And to top it all off, your weekly evaluation with your boss was today, and you were dreading it beyond belief. After scolding you on every single mistake you\u2019ve made, he dropped the bomb.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N), one more mistake and you\u2019re fired. We can\u2019t have anymore mistakes, do you understand? Ask Matt for help instead of doing whatever you want and ruining everything!\u201d You kept hearing his voice over and over again as you drove home. A few tears slipped out onto your cheeks as you parked in the driveway.</p><p><i>Why? Why did you make so many mistakes? Why did you have to be the one to get yelled at? Why was Matt making those rumors about you? Why did your boss assume Matt was the best worker ever when he was trying to ruin you? </i>You\u00a0banged your head against the steering wheel, letting the tears flow down to the carpet. You didn\u2019t know what to do, you were helpless and you were about to lose your job.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N), pull yourself together.\u201d You whispered to yourself before wiping your tears and getting out of the car. You made sure there were no tears left on your face before heading inside. The boys were always so caring, but you didn\u2019t want to bother them with this. This was all your fault and you had to deal with yourself.</p><p>Walking past the kitchen, you could see that all the boys were already having dinner at the table. Yoongi was the first one to see you at the door, giving you a soft smile.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N), how was work? Come sit down.\u201d He waved you over as all the other boys turned to you, excited for you to be back.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m not very hungry. I\u2019m just gonna go to my room.\u201d Everyone frowned slightly, looking at one another before Namjoon spoke up.<br></p><p>\u201c(Y/N) are you sure you\u2019re okay? You\u2019ve just seemed a little down this week.\u201d He spoke slowly as to not upset you, but you could already feel your throat closing up and the tears trying to push past your eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Running to your room, you slammed the door. Tears poured out as you threw yourself onto your bed. You let out a scream into your pillow as you let the heavy sobs leave your lips, tears soaking your pillowcase.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHave you guys noticed anything wrong with (Y/N) this week?\u201d Jin stood up from the table, placing the dirty plates into the sink.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s been a little off. I hope everything\u2019s okay.\u201d Jungkook frowned as he looked down at the table. The other boys nodded in agreement before all standing up to head to the living room.<br></p><p>\u201cDo you think we should check on her?\u201d Hoseok asked, he really wanted to make sure everything was okay, but Namjoon shook his head.<br></p><p>\u201cI think we better let her have some time alone. We\u2019ll check on her later. Who knows, maybe she\u2019s just been really tired this week?\u201d He didn\u2019t believe it himself, and neither did the other boys, but they agreed regardless.

He knew something was wrong, so he told the boys he was going to the bathroom before going to your check on you.<br></p><p>Sobs and screams could be heard from the other side of your door. His heart broke as he ran to get the others. The boys all turned to see Jimin panting as he pointed upstairs.

You&rsquo;ve just seemed a little down this week.&rdquo; He spoke slowly as to not upset you, but you could already feel your throat closing up and the tears trying to push past your eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Running to your room, you slammed the door. Tears poured out as you threw yourself onto your bed. You let out a scream into your pillow as you let the heavy sobs leave your lips, tears soaking your pillowcase.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Have you guys noticed anything wrong with (Y/N) this week?&rdquo; Jin stood up from the table, placing the dirty plates into the sink.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s been a little off. I hope everything&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; Jungkook frowned as he looked down at the table. The other boys nodded in agreement before all standing up to head to the living room.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do you think we should check on her?&rdquo; Hoseok asked, he really wanted to make sure everything was okay, but Namjoon shook his head.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think we better let her have some time alone. We&rsquo;ll check on her later. Who knows, maybe she&rsquo;s just been really tired this week?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t believe it himself, and neither did the other boys, but they agreed regardless. Jimin however couldn&rsquo;t get your face out of his mind. He knew something was wrong, so he told the boys he was going to the bathroom before going to your check on you.<br /></p><p>Sobs and screams could be heard from the other side of your door. His heart broke as he ran to get the others. The boys all turned to see Jimin panting as he pointed upstairs. A frown was glued to his face as he spoke.&nbsp;&ldquo;(Y/N)&rsquo;s crying.&rdquo; Not another word was said before everyone ran to your room. Namjoon, quickly unlocked the door, letting everyone pile into the room. You turned, face red and wet with tears. Their hearts broke. You were always so happy and caring, you always noticed when something was wrong. But this week you seemed so quiet and lonely.</p><p>Taehyung ran to your bed, embracing you as tears fell from his eyes. Jimin and Jungkook were on the verge of tears as they joined the embrace. The older boys all stood by your bed, their hearts shattering as they watched you cry into Taehyung&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>An hour had passed when you were finally calm enough to talk. The boys all sat around you on your bed as you explained what happened. From the mistakes, to your boss, to Matt, and to how you were about to lose your job. They all listened patiently as you spoke, and when you were done Hoseok was the first to speak up.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you just tell us?&rdquo; He frowned, upset that you had gone through so much this week with no support from anyone. You shook your head sadly at them.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault, I didn&rsquo;t want you guys to have to listen to all my problems. I just couldn&rsquo;t get anything right.&rdquo; Taehyung suddenly grabbed your shoulders, his expression full of anger now.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)! This is not your fault! Everyone makes mistakes, and your co-worker is just a jerk. None of this is your fault.&rdquo; He stared deeply into your eyes. You smiled weakly before letting out a soft laugh.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks Tae.&rdquo; Looking around you could see all the boys smiling at you, happy to see a smile on your face for the first time this week. You should&rsquo;ve told them earlier. You never expected to become this close with your roommates, but over time they had become your best friends, your family. And looking around now, you could see that they cared about you just as much as you cared about them.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;GROUP HUG!&rdquo; Jimin yelled out before tackling you into a tight embrace. The other boys laughed before hugging you as well. You laughed trying to hug everyone back before you all fell off of the bed. The laughter didn&rsquo;t stop as you all looked at each other, happy to be together once again.&nbsp;<br /></p></p>",
