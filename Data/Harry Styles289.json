        "answer": "<p>OOh dress shopping!!!<b><br/></b></p><p>_____________________ </p><p>For the dress shopping you got yourself a little entourage to help you pick a dress. You weren\u2019t really sure what dress you wanted. So you could really use your mother, sister, best friend, Anne and Gemma\u2019s help.</p><p>You all arrived at this little bridal boutique just outside the city of London. One of your co-workers had recommended this shop since she found her dress there too.</p><p>You entered and immediately you were in awe with all the beautiful dresses that were displayed in the shop.</p><p>You immediately went your seperate way to a dress that catches your eyes. It was this very simple yet elegant dress with lace around the shoulders.</p><p>\u2018Hello everybody, can I help with anything?\u2019 You heard a woman\u2019s voice say and you turned around. \u2018Yes, I am looking for a wedding dress.\u2019 You said. \u2018Anything in particular that you are looking for?\u2019 The woman whose name was apparently Wendy asked.</p><p>\u2018Well, I really love this dress.\u2019 You say and point at the dress that you were just standing by.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s really pretty YN.\u2019 Anne says.</p><p>\u2018It is, well if you like that one I think I have two other dresses that you may like.\u2019 Wendy says. \u2018Would you like to try them on?\u2019 She asked and you nodded. \u2018Well, let me get them for you. Your entourage can sit down there.\u2019 Wendy said and pointed at a place in the shop where there were couches.</p><p>\u2018And you can follow me to the dressing room.\u2019 Wendy pointed at you and you followed her to the back of the store. Before you turned the corner you waved at your entourage and your sister, best friend and Gemma gave you a thumbs up.</p><p>\u2018So, YN I got you the dress you saw in the store, then I have this dress with a longer sleeve and a belt in the center and then finally this more off-white dress with no lace but the same style as the first one.\u2019 \u2018Should we start with the one you picked out?\u2019 Wendy asked and you nodded. You tried on the dress and you fell tears in your eyes. The dress was really beautiful and the style was really flattering for your figure. </p><p>\u2018Ready to show the rest?\u2019 Wendy asked with a small smile on her face. \u2018Yes.\u2019 you said and rubbed your eyes to get rid of the glossiness. </p><p>When you walked out everybody smiled. \u2018You look beautiful YN.\u2019 Your mom said and you smiled at her. \u2018I really love the dress!\u2019 Gemma said. \u2018Oh god I am crying!\u2019 Your best friend said and you could feel the tears in your eyes again.</p><p>\u2018Well it seems like you all love the dress a lot. There are tissues at the side table over there.\u2019 Wendy said with a little laugh. \u2018I don\u2019t know what is happening to me, I keep crying in this dress.\u2019 You said while drying your tears, this comment made everybody laugh. </p><p>\u2018That is a good sign darling.\u2019 Anne said. </p><p>\u2018Would you like to try on the other two dresses I picked?\u2019 Wendy asked and you nodded, but you knew they weren\u2019t going to top this dress. And apparently you weren\u2019t the only one who thought the first one was the best. The other dresses were also very beautiful but your dress had something that you just couldn\u2019t describe.</p><p>\u2018Well, if only all my customers were as easy as you YN.\u2019 Wendy said when you were all standing at her desk. \u2018I didn\u2019t think I would find the dress so fast. Normally it takes me longer to find clothes.\u2019 You said and your sister laughed at that and added \u2018Yes, that\u2019s true.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So, your dress will be ready next month and then you can come back to do \u00a0a final fitting.\u2019 Wendy said and you all thanked her. </p><p>You walked out the store with the biggest smile on your face because you just bought yourself the most amazing wedding dress. </p><p>______________</p><p><a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/ask\">Request are open!</a></p>",

        "answer": "<p>It means he\u2019s sensitive, he\u2019s moody, he\u2019s gentle and kind, he\u2019s a secret do-gooder, he has secret affairs he\u2019ll never tell people about. Secrets, especially of the emotional variety, are sort of his thing, in general.\u00a0</p><p>The thing about the 12th house is the planet that resides in it is sort of going at it all from the blind spot of the chart native. The planet still functions, but the chart native can\u2019t SEE the functions of the planet. Often times, neither can anyone else. The chart native can only see the results of the planet, again, because it\u2019s in his blind spot. He may not fully understand <i>why </i>he behaves the way he does when it comes to his emotions<i>. </i>Chances are, he knows he\u2019s the way he is, but he\u2019s just at a loss as to why.\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s moon is well aspected by his mars, sun and Venus. This means his actions, his ego, and his loves are all touched by his secret emotions. Harry will always be private. He\u2019ll always physically do things we will never hear about, unless he wants us to hear about them. He can be egotistical, but if he doesn\u2019t want people to see his ego, they won\u2019t. Harry will have many loves that we never know the names of, unless he wants us to. In the moment, when these things are happening, he almost always prefers to keep them secret. I think people with this placement do this because of the fact that they themselves don\u2019t know exactly how to emotionally maneuver the situation in real time, and so what they do is allow the situation to happen and unfold as it happens, and then they have to go off in some way on their own and process the emotions that came from the situation. These people normally learn to play it very safe, especially as they get older.\u00a0</p><p>When they\u2019re younger, they\u2019ll probably be slightly rash, not stopping to think about how their actions might affect others.</p><p>The things about someone with a placement like this, especially in a sign like Libra, is that they need things to be just and fair. It would probably make them sick to know that they did anything to another human being that was unfair, so they would go out of their way to make it right. Harry\u2019s kindness is NOT an act. He really has a very gentle soul. When he tears up randomly on stage or when he gets to sing with his idol or when he hears something that he knows isn\u2019t true and it hurts him, those are real tears. Now, Harry is smart, and cunning, and he knows how to play a crowd and manipulate to his advantage, but those spontaneous unrehearsed moments where he wells up out of nowhere and you hear the emotion thicken his voice, that\u2019s all real.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s probably had to work really hard at accepting the fact that just is.. emotional. He\u2019s also probably worked pretty hard to structure his life in a way that emotional situations don\u2019t happen everytime he turns around.\u00a0</p><p>People with 12th house placements need a lot of time to themselves to recoup. While he has the energy to handle the concerts and tours, I\u2019d imagine behind closed doors, especially later in the tour, he really suffers. It will all start to get to him after awhile, even though he literally loves it like nothing else.\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s probably a lot more charitable than any of us could ever imagine. He probably sees the injustices of the world and wonders why the hell he was the one to make it, and what can he do to make someone else\u2019s life easier? If he was chosen for whatever reason, to be in this position, he\u2019s going to stop at nothing to make the world a better place. It\u2019s the least he can do, in his mind.</p><p>I have my moon in the 6th house in Aries (in his and my chart, we have the same rising within a degree in Libra), and if I was around him, I\u2019d probably body check people on a regular basis in an attempt to protect him, which he\u2019d hate because he\u2019d feel it wasn\u2019t fair to them. I don\u2019t think many people will ever know quite how gentle Harry really is, deep down, but with this placement, and with it well aspected, he\u2019d have to be.</p>",
