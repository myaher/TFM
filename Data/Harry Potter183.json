Rated G. 1.4k words.</p><p>\u201cPotter, firewood.\u201d Draco called out as the brunette was getting ready to walk out of the tent they had just set up. Little footsteps were heard and Potter turned around to catch the little girl who squealed in her father\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cYes, Potter.\u201d Harry said looking at Draco with a soft look in his eyes. Draco was laying on the cot with a book in his hands already. The gold band glinted from Draco\u2019s hand off of the soft light emitting from the string of fairy lights hung inside.</p><p>\u201cDaddy! Can I come with you?\u201d Lilith had long blond hair and bright green eyes. Magic was a special thing and it was the most brilliant idea to combine science and magic. It brought this little girl into their lives 8 years ago.</p><p>\u201cOf course, love.\u201d Harry said. He looked back up to get Draco\u2019s attention but he found cool grey eyes already watching him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get firewood. Dinner?\u201d Harry said. Draco nodded and closed the book before setting it down next to the cot. Harry lifted the girl and carried her out into the forest. Two weeks ago, Harry took Draco out to lunch and told him that he wished to take his two blonds on a small adventure. Draco reminded his husband that Lilith had school and a dance recital coming up, but Harry didn\u2019t let that stop him. A week later and Harry was packing a backpack with a storage charm full of supplies needed to spend four days in the woods.</p><p>\u201cFour days isn\u2019t too much. Two off of school and she\u2019ll only miss one dance lesson.\u201d Harry reasoned. Draco pursed his lips and tried his hardest to glare at the man but he couldn\u2019t keep a straight face. Now, it was the first day and Harry was off collecting firewood with his daughter while Draco cooked dinner.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s that?\u201d Lilith asked pointing to something in the distance. Harry followed the line of sight and smiled. They were set up at a muggle campsite and Harry wasn\u2019t surprised at the animals in the surrounding areas.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a deer. They are very nice creatures but they keep to themselves. Don\u2019t be loud, or they\u2019ll run away.\u201d Harry told the girl. She had an arm wrapped around Harry\u2019s neck and was looking at all of the trees and plants surrounding them. Her blond hair was tucked into a grey cap because the leaves were changing and it was starting to be cold outside.</p><p>\u201cWhat does firewood look like?\u201d She asked. Harry laughed.</p><p>\u201cFirewood is what we call big pieces of fallen tree. It\u2019s used because it burns a long time and doesn\u2019t need to be replaced a lot of the time.\u201d Harry explained. If he hadn\u2019t been watching the doctor\u2019s movements so carefully when he combined the needed components, Harry would swear they got the DNA mixed up. He couldn\u2019t remember ever being so curious and when he asked Draco, the blond said the same thing.</p><p>\u201cSo would that be good firewood?\u201d Lilith asked pointing at an entire fallen tree. Another adoring smile stretched over Harry\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really big tree, isn\u2019t it? It would work. But we have to make it smaller. Do you know how we do that?\u201d He asked. She began manifesting her magic a little over two months ago and was thrilled when she could make the coffee mug float like Draco always did. Harry remembered getting the call and hearing Draco\u2019s annoyed worries.</p><p>\u201cShe hovered my mug, Harry. Above my head and out of reach.\u201d He had growled.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s got magic.\u201d Harry had laughed. \u201cAnd a sense of humor, apparently.\u201d</p><p>Draco didn\u2019t see the humor but after a visit to the Healer, he allowed Harry to enter the apartment.</p><p>Now, Lilith was able to do small tasks.</p><p>\u201cWe chop it up!\u201d She shouted, voice bouncing off of the surrounding trees. Harry set her on her feet and pulled out his wand.</p><p>\u201cStand back, Lili.\u201d He said. The little blond went to stand a distance and watched as her father flicked his wrist.</p><p>\u201cDiffindo!\u201d He said. The tree trunk split in half. A few more flicks and Harry had chopped up a good amount of logs. He put his wand back in his sleeve and motioned for Lilith to come closer.</p><p>\u201cAlright, now let\u2019s get these back to our site. I\u2019m sure Father has dinner ready and we don\u2019t want to keep him waiting.\u201d Harry said. Lilith held her arms out and Harry began stacking small logs on them. He grabbed what he could and they made their way back to the tent. They set the wood in a pile to the side and Harry spelled them clean before they entered the tent.</p><p>Just as Harry predicted, Draco had finished making dinner and was setting everything at the table. The tent looked like a normal, muggle tent on the outside. Inside, however, it had been altered with an enlargement charm and fit a small table, couch, and two beds. One bed was small and had soft blue bedding. The other sat on a raised platform and had a fur throw over navy blue sheets. Between the beds was a fireplace with a soft rug in front of it.</p><p>Lilith hurried over to the table and climbed into a chair. Harry set a hand on Draco\u2019s waist as he leaned around him to set the juice on the table.</p><p>\u201cFirewood is outside and ready to burn.\u201d He told the blond. He moved to take his seat as Draco brought over the dish holding a small casserole.</p><p>After placing it on the table, he took his seat on the other side of Lilith. They began serving and eating immediately.</p><p>\u201cFather, I know I\u2019m missing Monday\u2019s lesson, but am I still getting my costume?\u201d Lilith asked. Draco finished the bite he had.</p><p>\u201cOf course, darling. We\u2019ll just pick it up on Wednesday. I\u2019ve seen the costumes and they look wonderful.\u201d He said, smiling with the knowledge he knew something she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAww, can\u2019t I see them!\u201d She whined. Draco shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou will this week.\u201d Was all he replied with.</p><p>\u201cDad, has Aunt Hermione messaged you yet? I want to make sure Leo is okay.\u201d Lilith asked turning to her left.</p><p>\u201cAunt Hermione is a busy woman, Lili. Leo will be fine. Ferrets are good like that.\u201d Harry replied.</p><p>After dinner was finished, Harry cleared the table while Draco went with Lilith to start the fire. When Harry finished with the dishes, he came back into the tent, closed it, then turned around to see Lilith holding up a book over hers and Draco\u2019s heads.</p><p>\u201cThat one should be the North Star. Also known as Sirius.\u201d Lilith said pointing to the transparent ceiling of the tent. Harry walked over and also laid down on his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we looking at?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cLili\u2019s showing me where the constellations are tonight.\u201d Draco said. He put his hand out searching for Harry\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cOh! And here\u2019s the constellation Ursa Major.\u201d Lilith said confidently even though the pattern she was pointing to was in fact, not Ursa Major. Harry pushed his hand out and found Draco\u2019s still searching. He entwined their fingers and with his other hand pointed at the book then the sky to show how the pattern translated. Not too long after that, Lilith was beginning to fall asleep. Draco stood up and carried her off to bed after Harry gave her goodnight kisses. Harry moved to the couch and waited for his husband to come back. He heard the blond cast a sound blocking charm around Lilith\u2019s bed and watched the blond saunter over to him. They were silent as Draco sat down and curled into Harry. They didn\u2019t need to speak. At some point, Harry took Draco\u2019s hand in his again and pointed at the sky.</p><p>\u201cYou see that one?\u201d He asked. Draco looked up through the transparent roof.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d The blond asked. Harry squeezed his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s my favorite constellation. It\u2019s name reminds me of the person I\u2019ve decided to love until the end of time. It\u2019s actually his namesake from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d Harry said pulling Draco to sit in his lap. Draco watched Harry talk with a fond look in his eyes and a shake of disbelief.</p><p>\u201cThat was sappy, Potter.\u201d Draco murmured. Harry leaned in so their lips were centimeters from meeting.</p><p>\u201cYou make me sappy, Potter.\u201d Harry murmured back before closing the distance. Each kiss felt like the first time and everytime Harry had one thought go through his head:</p><p>He was damn happy he survived the war because this life, the one he\u2019s built around his husband and their daughter, was the best thing he\u2019s ever had.</p>",

Draco was laying on the cot with a book in his hands already. The gold band glinted from Draco\u2019s hand off of the soft light emitting from the string of fairy lights hung inside.</p><p>\u201cDaddy! Can I come with you?\u201d Lilith had long blond hair and bright green eyes. Magic was a special thing and it was the most brilliant idea to combine science and magic. It brought this little girl into their lives 8 years ago.</p><p>\u201cOf course, love.\u201d Harry said. He looked back up to get Draco\u2019s attention but he found cool grey eyes already watching him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get firewood. Dinner?\u201d Harry said. Draco nodded and closed the book before setting it down next to the cot. Harry lifted the girl and carried her out into the forest. Two weeks ago, Harry took Draco out to lunch and told him that he wished to take his two blonds on a small adventure. Draco reminded his husband that Lilith had school and a dance recital coming up, but Harry didn\u2019t let that stop him. A week later and Harry was packing a backpack with a storage charm full of supplies needed to spend four days in the woods.</p><p>\u201cFour days isn\u2019t too much. Two off of school and she\u2019ll only miss one dance lesson.\u201d Harry reasoned. Draco pursed his lips and tried his hardest to glare at the man but he couldn\u2019t keep a straight face. Now, it was the first day and Harry was off collecting firewood with his daughter while Draco cooked dinner.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s that?\u201d Lilith asked pointing to something in the distance. Harry followed the line of sight and smiled. They were set up at a muggle campsite and Harry wasn\u2019t surprised at the animals in the surrounding areas.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a deer. They are very nice creatures but they keep to themselves. Don\u2019t be loud, or they\u2019ll run away.\u201d Harry told the girl. She had an arm wrapped around Harry\u2019s neck and was looking at all of the trees and plants surrounding them. Her blond hair was tucked into a grey cap because the leaves were changing and it was starting to be cold outside.</p><p>\u201cWhat does firewood look like?\u201d She asked. Harry laughed.</p><p>\u201cFirewood is what we call big pieces of fallen tree. It\u2019s used because it burns a long time and doesn\u2019t need to be replaced a lot of the time.\u201d Harry explained. If he hadn\u2019t been watching the doctor\u2019s movements so carefully when he combined the needed components, Harry would swear they got the DNA mixed up. He couldn\u2019t remember ever being so curious and when he asked Draco, the blond said the same thing.</p><p>\u201cSo would that be good firewood?\u201d Lilith asked pointing at an entire fallen tree. Another adoring smile stretched over Harry\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really big tree, isn\u2019t it? It would work. But we have to make it smaller. Do you know how we do that?\u201d He asked. She began manifesting her magic a little over two months ago and was thrilled when she could make the coffee mug float like Draco always did. Harry remembered getting the call and hearing Draco\u2019s annoyed worries.</p><p>\u201cShe hovered my mug, Harry. Above my head and out of reach.\u201d He had growled.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s got magic.\u201d Harry had laughed. \u201cAnd a sense of humor, apparently.\u201d</p><p>Draco didn\u2019t see the humor but after a visit to the Healer, he allowed Harry to enter the apartment.</p><p>Now, Lilith was able to do small tasks.</p><p>\u201cWe chop it up!\u201d She shouted, voice bouncing off of the surrounding trees. Harry set her on her feet and pulled out his wand.</p><p>\u201cStand back, Lili.\u201d He said. The little blond went to stand a distance and watched as her father flicked his wrist.</p><p>\u201cDiffindo!\u201d He said. The tree trunk split in half. A few more flicks and Harry had chopped up a good amount of logs. He put his wand back in his sleeve and motioned for Lilith to come closer.</p><p>\u201cAlright, now let\u2019s get these back to our site. I\u2019m sure Father has dinner ready and we don\u2019t want to keep him waiting.\u201d Harry said. Lilith held her arms out and Harry began stacking small logs on them. He grabbed what he could and they made their way back to the tent. They set the wood in a pile to the side and Harry spelled them clean before they entered the tent.</p><p>Just as Harry predicted, Draco had finished making dinner and was setting everything at the table. The tent looked like a normal, muggle tent on the outside. Inside, however, it had been altered with an enlargement charm and fit a small table, couch, and two beds. One bed was small and had soft blue bedding. The other sat on a raised platform and had a fur throw over navy blue sheets. Between the beds was a fireplace with a soft rug in front of it.</p><p>Lilith hurried over to the table and climbed into a chair. Harry set a hand on Draco\u2019s waist as he leaned around him to set the juice on the table.</p><p>\u201cFirewood is outside and ready to burn.\u201d He told the blond. He moved to take his seat as Draco brought over the dish holding a small casserole.</p><p>After placing it on the table, he took his seat on the other side of Lilith. They began serving and eating immediately.</p><p>\u201cFather, I know I\u2019m missing Monday\u2019s lesson, but am I still getting my costume?\u201d Lilith asked. Draco finished the bite he had.</p><p>\u201cOf course, darling. We\u2019ll just pick it up on Wednesday. I\u2019ve seen the costumes and they look wonderful.\u201d He said, smiling with the knowledge he knew something she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAww, can\u2019t I see them!\u201d She whined. Draco shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou will this week.\u201d Was all he replied with.</p><p>\u201cDad, has Aunt Hermione messaged you yet? I want to make sure Leo is okay.\u201d Lilith asked turning to her left.</p><p>\u201cAunt Hermione is a busy woman, Lili. Leo will be fine. Ferrets are good like that.\u201d Harry replied.</p><p>After dinner was finished, Harry cleared the table while Draco went with Lilith to start the fire. When Harry finished with the dishes, he came back into the tent, closed it, then turned around to see Lilith holding up a book over hers and Draco\u2019s heads.</p><p>\u201cThat one should be the North Star. Also known as Sirius.\u201d Lilith said pointing to the transparent ceiling of the tent. Harry walked over and also laid down on his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we looking at?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cLili\u2019s showing me where the constellations are tonight.\u201d Draco said. He put his hand out searching for Harry\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cOh! And here\u2019s the constellation Ursa Major.\u201d Lilith said confidently even though the pattern she was pointing to was in fact, not Ursa Major. Harry pushed his hand out and found Draco\u2019s still searching. He entwined their fingers and with his other hand pointed at the book then the sky to show how the pattern translated. Not too long after that, Lilith was beginning to fall asleep. Draco stood up and carried her off to bed after Harry gave her goodnight kisses. Harry moved to the couch and waited for his husband to come back. He heard the blond cast a sound blocking charm around Lilith\u2019s bed and watched the blond saunter over to him. They were silent as Draco sat down and curled into Harry. They didn\u2019t need to speak. At some point, Harry took Draco\u2019s hand in his again and pointed at the sky.</p><p>\u201cYou see that one?\u201d He asked. Draco looked up through the transparent roof.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d The blond asked. Harry squeezed his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s my favorite constellation. It\u2019s name reminds me of the person I\u2019ve decided to love until the end of time. It\u2019s actually his namesake from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d Harry said pulling Draco to sit in his lap. Draco watched Harry talk with a fond look in his eyes and a shake of disbelief.</p><p>\u201cThat was sappy, Potter.\u201d Draco murmured. Harry leaned in so their lips were centimeters from meeting.</p><p>\u201cYou make me sappy, Potter.\u201d Harry murmured back before closing the distance. Each kiss felt like the first time and everytime Harry had one thought go through his head:</p><p>He was damn happy he survived the war because this life, the one he\u2019s built around his husband and their daughter, was the best thing he\u2019s ever had.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Camping</h1><p>No read more, on mobile, sorry. Domestic, soft Drarry. Rated G. 1.4k words.</p><p>&ldquo;Potter, firewood.&rdquo; Draco called out as the brunette was getting ready to walk out of the tent they had just set up. Little footsteps were heard and Potter turned around to catch the little girl who squealed in her father&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Potter.&rdquo; Harry said looking at Draco with a soft look in his eyes. Draco was laying on the cot with a book in his hands already. The gold band glinted from Draco&rsquo;s hand off of the soft light emitting from the string of fairy lights hung inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Daddy! Can I come with you?&rdquo; Lilith had long blond hair and bright green eyes. Magic was a special thing and it was the most brilliant idea to combine science and magic. It brought this little girl into their lives 8 years ago.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, love.&rdquo; Harry said. He looked back up to get Draco&rsquo;s attention but he found cool grey eyes already watching him.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get firewood. Dinner?&rdquo; Harry said. Draco nodded and closed the book before setting it down next to the cot. Harry lifted the girl and carried her out into the forest. Two weeks ago, Harry took Draco out to lunch and told him that he wished to take his two blonds on a small adventure. Draco reminded his husband that Lilith had school and a dance recital coming up, but Harry didn&rsquo;t let that stop him. A week later and Harry was packing a backpack with a storage charm full of supplies needed to spend four days in the woods.</p><p>&ldquo;Four days isn&rsquo;t too much. Two off of school and she&rsquo;ll only miss one dance lesson.&rdquo; Harry reasoned. Draco pursed his lips and tried his hardest to glare at the man but he couldn&rsquo;t keep a straight face. Now, it was the first day and Harry was off collecting firewood with his daughter while Draco cooked dinner.</p><p>&ldquo;Daddy, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Lilith asked pointing to something in the distance. Harry followed the line of sight and smiled. They were set up at a muggle campsite and Harry wasn&rsquo;t surprised at the animals in the surrounding areas.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a deer. They are very nice creatures but they keep to themselves. Don&rsquo;t be loud, or they&rsquo;ll run away.&rdquo; Harry told the girl. She had an arm wrapped around Harry&rsquo;s neck and was looking at all of the trees and plants surrounding them. Her blond hair was tucked into a grey cap because the leaves were changing and it was starting to be cold outside.</p><p>&ldquo;What does firewood look like?&rdquo; She asked. Harry laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Firewood is what we call big pieces of fallen tree. It&rsquo;s used because it burns a long time and doesn&rsquo;t need to be replaced a lot of the time.&rdquo; Harry explained. If he hadn&rsquo;t been watching the doctor&rsquo;s movements so carefully when he combined the needed components, Harry would swear they got the DNA mixed up. He couldn&rsquo;t remember ever being so curious and when he asked Draco, the blond said the same thing.</p><p>&ldquo;So would that be good firewood?&rdquo; Lilith asked pointing at an entire fallen tree.
