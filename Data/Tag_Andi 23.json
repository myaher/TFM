It\u2019ll let up,\u201d he\nsaid reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cNo, the flight got cancelled! I have to stay overnight in\nthis hotel they are gonna put up all the people in some hotel,\u201d Buffy said,\npinching the bridge of her nose. \u201cI\u2019ll only be able to reach by tomorrow\nafternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Buffy. I\u2019m sure if you call up the company,\nthey will be willing to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. It\u2019s just so inconvenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But hey, maybe you\u2019ll get some sleep at this hotel\nnow!\u201d Marty said, trying to get Buffy to lighten up. She appreciated his\nefforts, letting a small smile form on her face.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Marty. The bus is gonna reach in some time,\u201d\nBuffy said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Buffy. Get some rest, okay?\u201d Marty said,\nbefore Buffy ended the call. She looked around her at the other passengers\ndoomed to her fate. <i>Nothing better than being stuck in a situation with\npeople you don\u2019t know, and will never see again.</i> She sighed and opened her\nphone, checking her social media. Scrolling through a bit, she landed on a\npicture of her and Marty from back in high school.</p><p>High school. Basketball, milkshakes, the Good Hair Crew.\nAndi and Cyrus. God, it had been so long. High school friends drift apart, but\nnever had they thought back then that it would happen to them. But happen it\ndid. Buffy sighed, scrolling past the picture, pushing away the memories.\nDwelling did no good. Buffy was positive that if her friends saw her today,\nthey wouldn\u2019t recognise the person she had become. And a part of her knew she\nwouldn\u2019t recognise them either. Shutting off her phone, Buffy leaned against\nthe seat, looking out the window as the announcement for the arrival of the bus\nrang through the air.</p><p>At least the night would pass by quick.</p><p>*</p><p>Andi huffed as she threw down her duffel bag and sank into\nthe shitty airport seat as she waited for more information about the transport\nto the hotel. She hadn\u2019t had any intention of spending her night there, but\ncancelled flights called for desperate measures. She pushed her sunglasses to\nthe top of her head, unable to use her phone because it decided it was a good\ntime to conk off. She rummaged through the meagre collection of magazines on\nthe stand next to the seats, and settled for a travel magazine. She opened it\nand began to read from a random page, wanting only to pass the time. Beads of\nsweat were already forming on the back of her neck. Despite the air\nconditioning being on full. <i>Maybe a leather jacket was not the best choice.</i></p><p>Andi busied herself in reading about the \u20185 Restaurants You\nHave to Try in Prague\u2019, turning the pages lazily, every movement betraying\ndisinterest. At one point, she felt someone\u2019s eyes on her. She turned around to\nsee a guy around her age staring at her intently. With that look in his eyes.\nShe knew that look. She had seen that look.</p><p>She despised that look.</p><p>\u201cThe fuck you looking at?\u201d she asked, making a dismissing\nmotion with her hand as she raised her eyebrows at the guy. \u00a0He just smirked at her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t a guy just look?\u201d he said in that voice that exuded\nfaux innocence. It sounded like nails on chalkboards to Andi\u2019s ears. </p><p>\u201cWell then, can\u2019t I just connect my fist to your nose?\u201d she\nasked, smiling at him, her eyes fiery. That got him to look away grumbling, not\nbefore he whispered, \u201cBitch,\u201d under his breath.</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes and looked back at the magazine, not\nbefore shooting looks at all the people who were staring at her after that\nincident. \u201cWhat are you watching? Nothing to see here,\u201d she said, moving her\nhands as if she were shooing them away.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t always been like this, so snappy and angry. She\nhad grown up a sweet, albeit dramatic girl. She had a weird but perfect life\nall the way till high school, with perfect friends and perfect relationships. But\nlife is a bitch.</p><p>So you have to be a bitch to survive.</p><p>*</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>sorry mom looks like itll be tomorrow when i\nget a flight</p><p><b>Mom:</b> oh dear okay cyrus. take care of yourself</p><p><b>Mom:</b> see you tomorrow :)</p><p>Cyrus sighed and put his phone in his pocket, cursing the\nbuilding headache that was making its presence very much known. He shut his\neyes for a moment, trying to quell the pain. It was then he really regretted\nnot carrying aspiring with him. Ignoring his headache, he looked around\nobserving all the people sitting there waiting for the bus to the hotel.\nDiagonally across from him was a girl with brown hair just above shoulder\nlength in a leather jacket, sunglasses perched on her head. She was flipping\nthrough a travel magazine rather disinterestedly. She had just told off a guy\nfor staring at her, earning some passing comments about her being \u2018rude\u2019, but\nCyrus was with the girl on this one. Though he didn\u2019t need to voice his\nsupport, she had the situation very much under her control. </p><p>For some reason, as he caught glimpses of her, Cyrus\ncouldn\u2019t shake the thought that <i>she looked incredibly familiar.</i> He had\nthe feeling that he knew this girl from somewhere, from a distant point in his\nlife. But he couldn\u2019t place her. </p><p>He shook his head slightly. <i>It was probably just a\npassing similarity. </i>He opened his phone for a distraction, noticing an\nInstagram notification.</p><p><b>cygoodman, see your post from 6 years ago today</b></p><p>Curious, he clicked on the notification and it took him all\nthe way back to senior year of high school, to baby taters and milkshakes. To\nthe Good Hair Crew.</p><p>To TJ.</p><p>The picture wasn\u2019t spectacular, it was just a slightly shaky\nselfie taken by Andi, with him, Buffy, Jonah, Marty, Amber. And TJ. Cyrus\u2019\nboyfriend. Well, \u2018then\u2019 boyfriend.</p><p>The picture made Cyrus\u2019 breath catch in his throat, a\nwistful smile spreading across his face. It had been over 4 years since he had\nspoken to anyone in that picture. 5 years since he and TJ had practically\nbroken up. 6 years since they left high school.</p><p>6 years since they hammered the last nail into the coffin of\ntheir childhood friendship.</p><p>High school and childhood friendships don\u2019t always last,\nthey all knew that. It came to no one\u2019s surprise when the messages and video\ncalls grew less frequent, they met up less and less. And soon enough, that was\nit. There was no great fight, no blowout. It just faded with time. Still, Cyrus\ncouldn\u2019t help but feel a pang of nostalgia for his friends. And for TJ.</p><p>TJ Kippen waltzing into his life in middle school was the\nsingle most unexpected thing to have ever happened to Cyrus. He came in a cold\njock, but it didn\u2019t take Cyrus long to see through the cracks to see the soft\nside, the kind and caring side. With TJ, Cyrus felt like he could do anything,\nwhich was saying a lot. With TJ, nothing was impossible. TJ burned bright like\nthe sun, and for some reason, he saw the moon in Cyrus. But of course, high\nschool ends, and so do high school sweethearts. In the end, it wasn\u2019t an\nexplosion that ended them. It was radio silence. But a part of Cyrus missed him\ndeeply. It was probably why he hadn\u2019t been in a serious relationship since TJ,\nsettling only for the casual and running at the first sign of more.</p><p><i>Where could they all be? Probably further away than he\ncould imagine.</i></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cOkay I kinda wish now we didn\u2019t meet up and decide to get\nthis flight together,\u201d TJ groaned as he started to gather his things from\naround the seat. </p><p>Amber scoffed, rolling her eyes. \u201cPlease, TJ. You\u2019re\ngrateful I\u2019m here with you, or else you wouldn\u2019t know anyone.\u201d</p><p>TJ simply looked away, knowing very well that Amber was\nright. They were both heading back to Shadyside to meet their parents, and TJ\nwas both dreading and looking forward to it. On one hand, it had been 5 years\nsince he had last been in Shadyside, so it would be good to see the place where\nhe had grown up. But on the other hand, he was dreading his mother pestering\nhim about his non-existent love life. He had only been in 2 real relationships,\nand only one of them was even worth remembering. But remembering was painful.\nHow fitting that the place he was going back to was also the place that held\nthe memories of that relationship at every corner.</p><p>Cyrus Goodman was, and always had been, an enigma to TJ\nKippen. He had swung into his life, almost literally, with his soft encouraging\nsmiles and reassuring words, making TJ feel like maybe, letting his guard down\nwouldn\u2019t mean the monsters would get to him faster. Cyrus had shaken him to the\ncore in the best way possible, and God alone knows how someone as incredible as\nhim could ever have fallen for someone like TJ. Their ups and downs had only\nmade them stronger, but eventually, some downs are just too hard to come back\nfrom. College means drifting apart, it means leaving those people behind. It\nwas practically mutual, but it didn\u2019t mean that the memories didn\u2019t come with\nthat mixture of warmth and a sting.</p><p>\u201cYo, TJ,\u201d Amber said, snapping her fingers in front of TJ\u2019s\nface, bringing him out of his thoughts. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving now.\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, taking his bags and following Amber out of the\ngate to the bus.</p><p><i>Probably better to leave the memories back in Shadyside\nso he could finally truly move on.</i></p><p>*</p><p><b>Emily: </b>I miss you</p><p><b>Emily: </b>maybe we made a mistake</p><p>Amber didn\u2019t need to open her phone to read the messages\nagain. They were burned into the back of her mind. With every step she took\nforward, the words inched closer to her heart. It didn\u2019t help that just above\nthose messages were the ones where Emily was telling her, \u2018I just don\u2019t feel\nthe same way anymore,\u2019 and, \u2018It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u2019.</p><p><i>Bullshit. It was always her.</i> </p><p>Amber couldn\u2019t believe that Emily even had the balls to send\nher a message saying she missed her. After she had brutally ripped her heart\nout and stepped on it with her signature Converse sneakers. That had been a\nmonth ago, and it took everything in Amber to try and piece herself back\ntogether. That was also part of the reason she was content in returning to\nShadyside for a while. She needed a break, and going home seemed the best\noption. She needed to find herself again. As dramatic as that sounded.</p><p>TJ, who was walking next to her, purposely bumped into her,\nforcing her to smack him upside the head. But she was glad he was there. She\ndidn\u2019t know if she could handle the memories of going home alone. </p><p>As she loaded her luggage into the bus, she let her mind\nwander to Emily. Was it a surprise she liked her? Not at all. She was exactly\nher type. Brown-haired, sweet and sunshiney personality, and proficient at\ncrafts. There had been one person before her, but that was just a crush, and\nleft at that.</p><p>Andi Mack. </p><p>Amber smiled to herself, thinking about Andi. Her bracelets,\nher dressing style, her smile, her laugh. While Amber had crushed on her from\nafar, that didn\u2019t erase the fact that Andi had become a really good friend of\nhers. She had helped her change from being the stereotypical mean girl, to\nbeing a girl who was tough but let people in. Amber wanted nothing more than to\npick up her phone and talk to Andi, reminisce on the old times. But that wasn\u2019t\ngoing to happen. They had parted ways. Life had taken them on different paths.</p><p>Paths that would never intersect.</p><p>*</p><p>Jonah Beck got onto the bus, carefully clutching his guitar\nclose to him. His suitcase had been stowed away, and he stared out of the\nwindow blankly. His hands were shaking slightly, the flight cancellation\nputting his on the edge. His breaths were growing incredibly unsteady, and he\ncouldn\u2019t let it get out of control. He pulled on the sleeves of his jacket,\nscratching himself in the process. Ultimately, opened his wallet and pulled out\na highly crumpled picture from it, and smoothed it out, the sight of it\nimmediately calming him down.</p><p>It was a Polaroid he, Cyrus, Andi and Buffy had taken the\nlast day of high school. Even though he no longer spoke to them, and their\npaths had diverged long ago, that picture was one of the only things that truly\nmade Jonah feel at ease. He looked at it so often that the creases were growing\nat an alarming rate. But he didn\u2019t care. It went with him wherever he would go.</p><p>Loosely clutching onto the picture, he looked out the window\nas the bus moved, thinking about their whole friend group. Andi, Buffy, Cyrus,\nAmber, TJ, Marty. Where were they? What were they doing? He knew they would\nprobably be far, far away, living their perfect lives. He smiled to himself,\njust wishing they all also missed high school, even if it was just for a\nsecond. He leaned against the window, closing his eyes, falling into a restless\nsleep until the bus reached the hotel.</p><p>*</p><p>As the evening progressed slowly into night, Andi, Buffy,\nCyrus, TJ, Amber and Jonah sat in the bus to the hotel, all starting out\nthinking about their broken, messed up, confused lives. And all of their trains\nof thoughts leading to the same station. Them in high school.</p><p>All felt like they knew the others were far away, living\nideal lives. They kept to their windows and phones for the ride, thinking about\nthe others. They reminisced separately, but prayed for the night to go by fast,\nto get to the places they needed to go.</p><p>But the night hadn\u2019t even begun yet.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p><b>\n\nSo I got this idea like a while ago, and I&rsquo;m finally writing it!

It had been over 4 years since he had\nspoken to anyone in that picture. 5 years since he and TJ had practically\nbroken up. 6 years since they left high school.</p><p>6 years since they hammered the last nail into the coffin of\ntheir childhood friendship.</p><p>High school and childhood friendships don\u2019t always last,\nthey all knew that. It came to no one\u2019s surprise when the messages and video\ncalls grew less frequent, they met up less and less. And soon enough, that was\nit. There was no great fight, no blowout. It just faded with time. Still, Cyrus\ncouldn\u2019t help but feel a pang of nostalgia for his friends. And for TJ.</p><p>TJ Kippen waltzing into his life in middle school was the\nsingle most unexpected thing to have ever happened to Cyrus. He came in a cold\njock, but it didn\u2019t take Cyrus long to see through the cracks to see the soft\nside, the kind and caring side. With TJ, Cyrus felt like he could do anything,\nwhich was saying a lot. With TJ, nothing was impossible. TJ burned bright like\nthe sun, and for some reason, he saw the moon in Cyrus. But of course, high\nschool ends, and so do high school sweethearts. In the end, it wasn\u2019t an\nexplosion that ended them. It was radio silence. But a part of Cyrus missed him\ndeeply. It was probably why he hadn\u2019t been in a serious relationship since TJ,\nsettling only for the casual and running at the first sign of more.</p><p><i>Where could they all be? Probably further away than he\ncould imagine.</i></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cOkay I kinda wish now we didn\u2019t meet up and decide to get\nthis flight together,\u201d TJ groaned as he started to gather his things from\naround the seat. </p><p>Amber scoffed, rolling her eyes. \u201cPlease, TJ. You\u2019re\ngrateful I\u2019m here with you, or else you wouldn\u2019t know anyone.\u201d</p><p>TJ simply looked away, knowing very well that Amber was\nright. They were both heading back to Shadyside to meet their parents, and TJ\nwas both dreading and looking forward to it. On one hand, it had been 5 years\nsince he had last been in Shadyside, so it would be good to see the place where\nhe had grown up. But on the other hand, he was dreading his mother pestering\nhim about his non-existent love life. He had only been in 2 real relationships,\nand only one of them was even worth remembering. But remembering was painful.\nHow fitting that the place he was going back to was also the place that held\nthe memories of that relationship at every corner.</p><p>Cyrus Goodman was, and always had been, an enigma to TJ\nKippen. He had swung into his life, almost literally, with his soft encouraging\nsmiles and reassuring words, making TJ feel like maybe, letting his guard down\nwouldn\u2019t mean the monsters would get to him faster. Cyrus had shaken him to the\ncore in the best way possible, and God alone knows how someone as incredible as\nhim could ever have fallen for someone like TJ. Their ups and downs had only\nmade them stronger, but eventually, some downs are just too hard to come back\nfrom. College means drifting apart, it means leaving those people behind. It\nwas practically mutual, but it didn\u2019t mean that the memories didn\u2019t come with\nthat mixture of warmth and a sting.</p><p>\u201cYo, TJ,\u201d Amber said, snapping her fingers in front of TJ\u2019s\nface, bringing him out of his thoughts. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving now.\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, taking his bags and following Amber out of the\ngate to the bus.</p><p><i>Probably better to leave the memories back in Shadyside\nso he could finally truly move on.</i></p><p>*</p><p><b>Emily: </b>I miss you</p><p><b>Emily: </b>maybe we made a mistake</p><p>Amber didn\u2019t need to open her phone to read the messages\nagain. They were burned into the back of her mind. With every step she took\nforward, the words inched closer to her heart. It didn\u2019t help that just above\nthose messages were the ones where Emily was telling her, \u2018I just don\u2019t feel\nthe same way anymore,\u2019 and, \u2018It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u2019.</p><p><i>Bullshit. It was always her.</i> </p><p>Amber couldn\u2019t believe that Emily even had the balls to send\nher a message saying she missed her. After she had brutally ripped her heart\nout and stepped on it with her signature Converse sneakers. That had been a\nmonth ago, and it took everything in Amber to try and piece herself back\ntogether. That was also part of the reason she was content in returning to\nShadyside for a while. She needed a break, and going home seemed the best\noption. She needed to find herself again. As dramatic as that sounded.</p><p>TJ, who was walking next to her, purposely bumped into her,\nforcing her to smack him upside the head. But she was glad he was there. She\ndidn\u2019t know if she could handle the memories of going home alone. </p><p>As she loaded her luggage into the bus, she let her mind\nwander to Emily. Was it a surprise she liked her? Not at all. She was exactly\nher type. Brown-haired, sweet and sunshiney personality, and proficient at\ncrafts. There had been one person before her, but that was just a crush, and\nleft at that.</p><p>Andi Mack. </p><p>Amber smiled to herself, thinking about Andi. Her bracelets,\nher dressing style, her smile, her laugh. While Amber had crushed on her from\nafar, that didn\u2019t erase the fact that Andi had become a really good friend of\nhers. She had helped her change from being the stereotypical mean girl, to\nbeing a girl who was tough but let people in. Amber wanted nothing more than to\npick up her phone and talk to Andi, reminisce on the old times. But that wasn\u2019t\ngoing to happen. They had parted ways. Life had taken them on different paths.</p><p>Paths that would never intersect.</p><p>*</p><p>Jonah Beck got onto the bus, carefully clutching his guitar\nclose to him. His suitcase had been stowed away, and he stared out of the\nwindow blankly. His hands were shaking slightly, the flight cancellation\nputting his on the edge. His breaths were growing incredibly unsteady, and he\ncouldn\u2019t let it get out of control. He pulled on the sleeves of his jacket,\nscratching himself in the process. Ultimately, opened his wallet and pulled out\na highly crumpled picture from it, and smoothed it out, the sight of it\nimmediately calming him down.</p><p>It was a Polaroid he, Cyrus, Andi and Buffy had taken the\nlast day of high school. Even though he no longer spoke to them, and their\npaths had diverged long ago, that picture was one of the only things that truly\nmade Jonah feel at ease. He looked at it so often that the creases were growing\nat an alarming rate. But he didn\u2019t care. It went with him wherever he would go.</p><p>Loosely clutching onto the picture, he looked out the window\nas the bus moved, thinking about their whole friend group. Andi, Buffy, Cyrus,\nAmber, TJ, Marty. Where were they? What were they doing? He knew they would\nprobably be far, far away, living their perfect lives. He smiled to himself,\njust wishing they all also missed high school, even if it was just for a\nsecond. He leaned against the window, closing his eyes, falling into a restless\nsleep until the bus reached the hotel.</p><p>*</p><p>As the evening progressed slowly into night, Andi, Buffy,\nCyrus, TJ, Amber and Jonah sat in the bus to the hotel, all starting out\nthinking about their broken, messed up, confused lives. And all of their trains\nof thoughts leading to the same station. Them in high school.</p><p>All felt like they knew the others were far away, living\nideal lives.

They reminisced separately but prayed for the night to go by fast, to get to the places they needed to go.<br>But the night hadn\u2019t even begun yet.\u201d<br>High school ended 6 years ago, and with it, so did the friendship between Andi, Buffy, Cyrus, Jonah, TJ and Amber.<br>But now their flight is delayed and they are stuck in a hotel together for the night. Not much can change in one night, though.<br>Can it?\n\n</i></p><p><i><b>AO3 LINK IN REBLOG</b></i></p><p>~~~~~~~</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cThis sucks,\u201d Buffy groaned down to phone to Marty, who\nlaughed pleasantly in amusement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Buffy, just a flight delay. It\u2019ll let up,\u201d he\nsaid reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cNo, the flight got cancelled! I have to stay overnight in\nthis hotel they are gonna put up all the people in some hotel,\u201d Buffy said,\npinching the bridge of her nose. \u201cI\u2019ll only be able to reach by tomorrow\nafternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Buffy. I\u2019m sure if you call up the company,\nthey will be willing to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. It\u2019s just so inconvenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But hey, maybe you\u2019ll get some sleep at this hotel\nnow!\u201d Marty said, trying to get Buffy to lighten up. She appreciated his\nefforts, letting a small smile form on her face.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Marty. The bus is gonna reach in some time,\u201d\nBuffy said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Buffy. Get some rest, okay?\u201d Marty said,\nbefore Buffy ended the call. She looked around her at the other passengers\ndoomed to her fate. <i>Nothing better than being stuck in a situation with\npeople you don\u2019t know, and will never see again.</i> She sighed and opened her\nphone, checking her social media. Scrolling through a bit, she landed on a\npicture of her and Marty from back in high school.</p><p>High school. Basketball, milkshakes, the Good Hair Crew.\nAndi and Cyrus. God, it had been so long. High school friends drift apart, but\nnever had they thought back then that it would happen to them. But happen it\ndid. Buffy sighed, scrolling past the picture, pushing away the memories.\nDwelling did no good. Buffy was positive that if her friends saw her today,\nthey wouldn\u2019t recognise the person she had become. And a part of her knew she\nwouldn\u2019t recognise them either. Shutting off her phone, Buffy leaned against\nthe seat, looking out the window as the announcement for the arrival of the bus\nrang through the air.</p><p>At least the night would pass by quick.</p><p>*</p><p>Andi huffed as she threw down her duffel bag and sank into\nthe shitty airport seat as she waited for more information about the transport\nto the hotel. She hadn\u2019t had any intention of spending her night there, but\ncancelled flights called for desperate measures. She pushed her sunglasses to\nthe top of her head, unable to use her phone because it decided it was a good\ntime to conk off. She rummaged through the meagre collection of magazines on\nthe stand next to the seats, and settled for a travel magazine. She opened it\nand began to read from a random page, wanting only to pass the time. Beads of\nsweat were already forming on the back of her neck. Despite the air\nconditioning being on full. <i>Maybe a leather jacket was not the best choice.</i></p><p>Andi busied herself in reading about the \u20185 Restaurants You\nHave to Try in Prague\u2019, turning the pages lazily, every movement betraying\ndisinterest. At one point, she felt someone\u2019s eyes on her. She turned around to\nsee a guy around her age staring at her intently. With that look in his eyes.\nShe knew that look. She had seen that look.</p><p>She despised that look.</p><p>\u201cThe fuck you looking at?\u201d she asked, making a dismissing\nmotion with her hand as she raised her eyebrows at the guy. \u00a0He just smirked at her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t a guy just look?\u201d he said in that voice that exuded\nfaux innocence. It sounded like nails on chalkboards to Andi\u2019s ears. </p><p>\u201cWell then, can\u2019t I just connect my fist to your nose?\u201d she\nasked, smiling at him, her eyes fiery. That got him to look away grumbling, not\nbefore he whispered, \u201cBitch,\u201d under his breath.</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes and looked back at the magazine, not\nbefore shooting looks at all the people who were staring at her after that\nincident. \u201cWhat are you watching? Nothing to see here,\u201d she said, moving her\nhands as if she were shooing them away.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t always been like this, so snappy and angry. She\nhad grown up a sweet, albeit dramatic girl. She had a weird but perfect life\nall the way till high school, with perfect friends and perfect relationships. But\nlife is a bitch.</p><p>So you have to be a bitch to survive.</p><p>*</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>sorry mom looks like itll be tomorrow when i\nget a flight</p><p><b>Mom:</b> oh dear okay cyrus. take care of yourself</p><p><b>Mom:</b> see you tomorrow :)</p><p>Cyrus sighed and put his phone in his pocket, cursing the\nbuilding headache that was making its presence very much known. He shut his\neyes for a moment, trying to quell the pain. It was then he really regretted\nnot carrying aspiring with him. Ignoring his headache, he looked around\nobserving all the people sitting there waiting for the bus to the hotel.\nDiagonally across from him was a girl with brown hair just above shoulder\nlength in a leather jacket, sunglasses perched on her head. She was flipping\nthrough a travel magazine rather disinterestedly. She had just told off a guy\nfor staring at her, earning some passing comments about her being \u2018rude\u2019, but\nCyrus was with the girl on this one. Though he didn\u2019t need to voice his\nsupport, she had the situation very much under her control. </p><p>For some reason, as he caught glimpses of her, Cyrus\ncouldn\u2019t shake the thought that <i>she looked incredibly familiar.</i> He had\nthe feeling that he knew this girl from somewhere, from a distant point in his\nlife. But he couldn\u2019t place her. </p><p>He shook his head slightly. <i>It was probably just a\npassing similarity. </i>He opened his phone for a distraction, noticing an\nInstagram notification.</p><p><b>cygoodman, see your post from 6 years ago today</b></p><p>Curious, he clicked on the notification and it took him all\nthe way back to senior year of high school, to baby taters and milkshakes. To\nthe Good Hair Crew.</p><p>To TJ.</p><p>The picture wasn\u2019t spectacular, it was just a slightly shaky\nselfie taken by Andi, with him, Buffy, Jonah, Marty, Amber. And TJ.

They kept to their windows and phones for the ride, thinking about the others. They reminisced separately but prayed for the night to go by fast, to get to the places they needed to go.<br />But the night hadn&rsquo;t even begun yet.&rdquo;<br />High school ended 6 years ago, and with it, so did the friendship between Andi, Buffy, Cyrus, Jonah, TJ and Amber.<br />But now their flight is delayed and they are stuck in a hotel together for the night. Not much can change in one night, though.<br />Can it?\n\n</i></p><p><i><b>AO3 LINK IN REBLOG</b></i></p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>&ldquo;This sucks,&rdquo; Buffy groaned down to phone to Marty, who\nlaughed pleasantly in amusement.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay Buffy, just a flight delay. It&rsquo;ll let up,&rdquo; he\nsaid reassuringly.</p><p>&ldquo;No, the flight got cancelled! I have to stay overnight in\nthis hotel they are gonna put up all the people in some hotel,&rdquo; Buffy said,\npinching the bridge of her nose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only be able to reach by tomorrow\nafternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, Buffy. I&rsquo;m sure if you call up the company,\nthey will be willing to understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess. It&rsquo;s just so inconvenient.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;True. But hey, maybe you&rsquo;ll get some sleep at this hotel\nnow!&rdquo; Marty said, trying to get Buffy to lighten up. She appreciated his\nefforts, letting a small smile form on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Marty. The bus is gonna reach in some time,&rdquo;\nBuffy said.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, Buffy. Get some rest, okay?&rdquo; Marty said,\nbefore Buffy ended the call. She looked around her at the other passengers\ndoomed to her fate. <i>Nothing better than being stuck in a situation with\npeople you don&rsquo;t know, and will never see again.</i> She sighed and opened her\nphone, checking her social media. Scrolling through a bit, she landed on a\npicture of her and Marty from back in high school.</p><p>High school. Basketball, milkshakes, the Good Hair Crew.\nAndi and Cyrus. God, it had been so long. High school friends drift apart, but\nnever had they thought back then that it would happen to them. But happen it\ndid. Buffy sighed, scrolling past the picture, pushing away the memories.\nDwelling did no good. Buffy was positive that if her friends saw her today,\nthey wouldn&rsquo;t recognise the person she had become. And a part of her knew she\nwouldn&rsquo;t recognise them either. Shutting off her phone, Buffy leaned against\nthe seat, looking out the window as the announcement for the arrival of the bus\nrang through the air.</p><p>At least the night would pass by quick.</p><p>*</p><p>Andi huffed as she threw down her duffel bag and sank into\nthe shitty airport seat as she waited for more information about the transport\nto the hotel. She hadn&rsquo;t had any intention of spending her night there, but\ncancelled flights called for desperate measures. She pushed her sunglasses to\nthe top of her head, unable to use her phone because it decided it was a good\ntime to conk off. She rummaged through the meagre collection of magazines on\nthe stand next to the seats, and settled for a travel magazine. She opened it\nand began to read from a random page, wanting only to pass the time. Beads of\nsweat were already forming on the back of her neck. Despite the air\nconditioning being on full. <i>Maybe a leather jacket was not the best choice.</i></p><p>Andi busied herself in reading about the &lsquo;5 Restaurants You\nHave to Try in Prague&rsquo;, turning the pages lazily, every movement betraying\ndisinterest. At one point, she felt someone&rsquo;s eyes on her. She turned around to\nsee a guy around her age staring at her intently. With that look in his eyes.\nShe knew that look. She had seen that look.</p><p>She despised that look.</p><p>&ldquo;The fuck you looking at?&rdquo; she asked, making a dismissing\nmotion with her hand as she raised her eyebrows at the guy. &nbsp;He just smirked at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a guy just look?&rdquo; he said in that voice that exuded\nfaux innocence. It sounded like nails on chalkboards to Andi&rsquo;s ears. </p><p>&ldquo;Well then, can&rsquo;t I just connect my fist to your nose?&rdquo; she\nasked, smiling at him, her eyes fiery. That got him to look away grumbling, not\nbefore he whispered, &ldquo;Bitch,&rdquo; under his breath.</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes and looked back at the magazine, not\nbefore shooting looks at all the people who were staring at her after that\nincident. &ldquo;What are you watching? Nothing to see here,&rdquo; she said, moving her\nhands as if she were shooing them away.</p><p>She hadn&rsquo;t always been like this, so snappy and angry. She\nhad grown up a sweet, albeit dramatic girl. She had a weird but perfect life\nall the way till high school, with perfect friends and perfect relationships. But\nlife is a bitch.</p><p>So you have to be a bitch to survive.</p><p>*</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>sorry mom looks like itll be tomorrow when i\nget a flight</p><p><b>Mom:</b> oh dear okay cyrus. take care of yourself</p><p><b>Mom:</b> see you tomorrow :)</p><p>Cyrus sighed and put his phone in his pocket, cursing the\nbuilding headache that was making its presence very much known. He shut his\neyes for a moment, trying to quell the pain. It was then he really regretted\nnot carrying aspiring with him. Ignoring his headache, he looked around\nobserving all the people sitting there waiting for the bus to the hotel.\nDiagonally across from him was a girl with brown hair just above shoulder\nlength in a leather jacket, sunglasses perched on her head. She was flipping\nthrough a travel magazine rather disinterestedly. She had just told off a guy\nfor staring at her, earning some passing comments about her being &lsquo;rude&rsquo;, but\nCyrus was with the girl on this one. Though he didn&rsquo;t need to voice his\nsupport, she had the situation very much under her control. </p><p>For some reason, as he caught glimpses of her, Cyrus\ncouldn&rsquo;t shake the thought that <i>she looked incredibly familiar.</i> He had\nthe feeling that he knew this girl from somewhere, from a distant point in his\nlife. But he couldn&rsquo;t place her. </p><p>He shook his head slightly. <i>It was probably just a\npassing similarity. </i>He opened his phone for a distraction, noticing an\nInstagram notification.</p><p><b>cygoodman, see your post from 6 years ago today</b></p><p>Curious, he clicked on the notification and it took him all\nthe way back to senior year of high school, to baby taters and milkshakes. To\nthe Good Hair Crew.</p><p>To TJ.</p><p>The picture wasn&rsquo;t spectacular, it was just a slightly shaky\nselfie taken by Andi, with him, Buffy, Jonah, Marty, Amber. And TJ. Cyrus&rsquo;\nboyfriend. Well, &lsquo;then&rsquo; boyfriend.</p><p>The picture made Cyrus&rsquo; breath catch in his throat, a\nwistful smile spreading across his face. It had been over 4 years since he had\nspoken to anyone in that picture. 5 years since he and TJ had practically\nbroken up. 6 years since they left high school.</p><p>6 years since they hammered the last nail into the coffin of\ntheir childhood friendship.</p><p>High school and childhood friendships don&rsquo;t always last,\nthey all knew that. It came to no one&rsquo;s surprise when the messages and video\ncalls grew less frequent, they met up less and less. And soon enough, that was\nit. There was no great fight, no blowout. It just faded with time. Still, Cyrus\ncouldn&rsquo;t help but feel a pang of nostalgia for his friends. And for TJ.</p><p>TJ Kippen waltzing into his life in middle school was the\nsingle most unexpected thing to have ever happened to Cyrus. He came in a cold\njock, but it didn&rsquo;t take Cyrus long to see through the cracks to see the soft\nside, the kind and caring side. With TJ, Cyrus felt like he could do anything,\nwhich was saying a lot. With TJ, nothing was impossible. TJ burned bright like\nthe sun, and for some reason, he saw the moon in Cyrus. But of course, high\nschool ends, and so do high school sweethearts. In the end, it wasn&rsquo;t an\nexplosion that ended them. It was radio silence. But a part of Cyrus missed him\ndeeply. It was probably why he hadn&rsquo;t been in a serious relationship since TJ,\nsettling only for the casual and running at the first sign of more.</p><p><i>Where could they all be? Probably further away than he\ncould imagine.</i></p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Okay I kinda wish now we didn&rsquo;t meet up and decide to get\nthis flight together,&rdquo; TJ groaned as he started to gather his things from\naround the seat. </p><p>Amber scoffed, rolling her eyes. &ldquo;Please, TJ. You&rsquo;re\ngrateful I&rsquo;m here with you, or else you wouldn&rsquo;t know anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ simply looked away, knowing very well that Amber was\nright. They were both heading back to Shadyside to meet their parents, and TJ\nwas both dreading and looking forward to it. On one hand, it had been 5 years\nsince he had last been in Shadyside, so it would be good to see the place where\nhe had grown up. But on the other hand, he was dreading his mother pestering\nhim about his non-existent love life. He had only been in 2 real relationships,\nand only one of them was even worth remembering. But remembering was painful.\nHow fitting that the place he was going back to was also the place that held\nthe memories of that relationship at every corner.</p><p>Cyrus Goodman was, and always had been, an enigma to TJ\nKippen. He had swung into his life, almost literally, with his soft encouraging\nsmiles and reassuring words, making TJ feel like maybe, letting his guard down\nwouldn&rsquo;t mean the monsters would get to him faster. Cyrus had shaken him to the\ncore in the best way possible, and God alone knows how someone as incredible as\nhim could ever have fallen for someone like TJ. Their ups and downs had only\nmade them stronger, but eventually, some downs are just too hard to come back\nfrom. College means drifting apart, it means leaving those people behind. It\nwas practically mutual, but it didn&rsquo;t mean that the memories didn&rsquo;t come with\nthat mixture of warmth and a sting.</p><p>&ldquo;Yo, TJ,&rdquo; Amber said, snapping her fingers in front of TJ&rsquo;s\nface, bringing him out of his thoughts. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving now.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nodded, taking his bags and following Amber out of the\ngate to the bus.</p><p><i>Probably better to leave the memories back in Shadyside\nso he could finally truly move on.</i></p><p>*</p><p><b>Emily: </b>I miss you</p><p><b>Emily: </b>maybe we made a mistake</p><p>Amber didn&rsquo;t need to open her phone to read the messages\nagain. They were burned into the back of her mind. With every step she took\nforward, the words inched closer to her heart. It didn&rsquo;t help that just above\nthose messages were the ones where Emily was telling her, &lsquo;I just don&rsquo;t feel\nthe same way anymore,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s me&rsquo;.</p><p><i>Bullshit. It was always her.</i> </p><p>Amber couldn&rsquo;t believe that Emily even had the balls to send\nher a message saying she missed her. After she had brutally ripped her heart\nout and stepped on it with her signature Converse sneakers. That had been a\nmonth ago, and it took everything in Amber to try and piece herself back\ntogether. That was also part of the reason she was content in returning to\nShadyside for a while. She needed a break, and going home seemed the best\noption. She needed to find herself again. As dramatic as that sounded.</p><p>TJ, who was walking next to her, purposely bumped into her,\nforcing her to smack him upside the head. But she was glad he was there. She\ndidn&rsquo;t know if she could handle the memories of going home alone. </p><p>As she loaded her luggage into the bus, she let her mind\nwander to Emily. Was it a surprise she liked her? Not at all. She was exactly\nher type. Brown-haired, sweet and sunshiney personality, and proficient at\ncrafts. There had been one person before her, but that was just a crush, and\nleft at that.</p><p>Andi Mack. </p><p>Amber smiled to herself, thinking about Andi. Her bracelets,\nher dressing style, her smile, her laugh. While Amber had crushed on her from\nafar, that didn&rsquo;t erase the fact that Andi had become a really good friend of\nhers. She had helped her change from being the stereotypical mean girl, to\nbeing a girl who was tough but let people in. Amber wanted nothing more than to\npick up her phone and talk to Andi, reminisce on the old times. But that wasn&rsquo;t\ngoing to happen. They had parted ways. Life had taken them on different paths.</p><p>Paths that would never intersect.</p><p>*</p><p>Jonah Beck got onto the bus, carefully clutching his guitar\nclose to him. His suitcase had been stowed away, and he stared out of the\nwindow blankly. His hands were shaking slightly, the flight cancellation\nputting his on the edge. His breaths were growing incredibly unsteady, and he\ncouldn&rsquo;t let it get out of control. He pulled on the sleeves of his jacket,\nscratching himself in the process. Ultimately, opened his wallet and pulled out\na highly crumpled picture from it, and smoothed it out, the sight of it\nimmediately calming him down.</p><p>It was a Polaroid he, Cyrus, Andi and Buffy had taken the\nlast day of high school. Even though he no longer spoke to them, and their\npaths had diverged long ago, that picture was one of the only things that truly\nmade Jonah feel at ease. He looked at it so often that the creases were growing\nat an alarming rate. But he didn&rsquo;t care. It went with him wherever he would go.</p><p>Loosely clutching onto the picture, he looked out the window\nas the bus moved, thinking about their whole friend group. Andi, Buffy, Cyrus,\nAmber, TJ, Marty. Where were they? What were they doing? He knew they would\nprobably be far, far away, living their perfect lives. He smiled to himself,\njust wishing they all also missed high school, even if it was just for a\nsecond. He leaned against the window, closing his eyes, falling into a restless\nsleep until the bus reached the hotel.</p><p>*</p><p>As the evening progressed slowly into night, Andi, Buffy,\nCyrus, TJ, Amber and Jonah sat in the bus to the hotel, all starting out\nthinking about their broken, messed up, confused lives. And all of their trains\nof thoughts leading to the same station. Them in high school.</p><p>All felt like they knew the others were far away, living\nideal lives. They kept to their windows and phones for the ride, thinking about\nthe others. They reminisced separately, but prayed for the night to go by fast,\nto get to the places they needed to go.</p><p>But the night hadn&rsquo;t even begun yet.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p><b>\n\nSo I got this idea like a while ago, and I&rsquo;m finally writing it!
