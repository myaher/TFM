But now that Peter is here,Steve and Tony both feel protective over him. It doesn\u2019t help that Peter hates everyone other than Steve and tony.

Tony who was buried in work, designing and programming and testing out new suits. Steve had asked if Tony had needed any help but Tony had simply shook his head and focused on something else. So Steve had sat down on the couch in the corner and entertained Peter.<br/>&ldquo;Can you say papa for me Pete?&rdquo; Steve asked gently. Peter merely smiled up at Steve and Steve knew he loved this kid more than words could explain. He felt that fierce protectiveness wash over him again, <i>my son</i>. And god forbid if anyone ever hurt his son. <br/>&ldquo;P-Pa.&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s jaw dropped and Tony whirled and looked at them with wide, astonished eyes.<br/>&ldquo;Did he just say his first word?&rdquo; Tony breathed and Steve nodded slightly.<br/>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo; Tony made his way over and crouched down in front of Peter.<br/>&ldquo;Can you do it again Pete?&rdquo; Peter looked between them both and giggled.<br/>&ldquo;Say papa Peter.&rdquo; Steve encouraged and Peter made another attempt.<br/>&ldquo;P-pa.&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;Close enough.&rdquo; Tony chuckled and stared at Peter with so much love and adoration. This was it. They were a family.<br/>&ldquo;What about Dad?&rdquo; Steve asked and Peter scrunched his face up in concentration.<br/>&ldquo;P-Pa.&rdquo; He looked so excited and Steve grinned.<br/>&ldquo;Maybe dad will be tomorrow.&rdquo; Tony murmured and Steve nodded.<br/>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Steve studied Tony&rsquo;s mahogany eyes for a long moment before looking back at Peter. And then a startling realisation hit him.<br/>&ldquo;We have to call May!&rdquo; Tony nodded and pulled out his phone, she answered almost instantly.<br/>&ldquo;Hey Tony.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Say it Peter.&rdquo; Tony murmured and he did, May gasped aloud and Steve&rsquo;s grin grew wider.<br/>&ldquo;Did he just speak?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Tony chuckled.<br/>&ldquo;Oh my gosh!&rdquo; May sounded ecstatic.<br/>&ldquo;It was a shock for us too.&rdquo; Tony murmured and took May off of speaker phone. He talked with her for a couple minutes before he sat back down in his desk chair.<br/>&ldquo;Smile.&rdquo; Tony said and Steve looked up and saw as Tony took a photo. <br/>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t ready!&rdquo; Steve called out and Tony was grinning at the picture.<br/>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes it so good, this is perfect.&rdquo; Then Tony turned back to his desk and focused back on his work. Steve sighed and looked back down at Peter.<br/>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him back for that one.&rdquo; Steve whispered.\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>\n\nTony worked all day and made a lot of progress on the suits he was developing. But not as much progress as he would&rsquo;ve liked. Tony knew he could have done more if he&rsquo;d been alone. Because Steve and Peter were a constant distraction which decreased the amount of Tony&rsquo;s productivity. But Tony didn&rsquo;t mind. His mind wandered back to the hug, the way it felt for Steve&rsquo;s arms to be wrapped around Tony&rsquo;s body and- No. Tony couldn&rsquo;t continue to have these thoughts. He had to do something about this, because the longer he dwelled on that stupid hug, the higher the chance of Tony starting to have feelings for Steve. He had to stop this, because he and Steve would never be more than friends. When Tony opened his eyes and glanced over his shoulder, he found Steve was watching him.<br/>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Steve asked gently and Tony nodded.<br/>&ldquo;Always.&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s brows furrowed ever so slightly but he was wise enough to understand that he needed to let it go. <br/>&ldquo;Are <i>you</i> okay?&rdquo; Tony retaliated. Steve smirked and nodded his head.<br/>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m just coming up with all the ways I&rsquo;m going to destroy you at Monopoly tonight.&rdquo; Steve told him and Tony couldn&rsquo;t stop the grin from appearing on his face.<br/>&ldquo;Not a chance Rogers.&rdquo; Steve chuckled, and Tony had to look away.<br/>&ldquo;You should take a break, you&rsquo;ve been going at it for a while now.&rdquo; Steve advised, but Tony thought about the amount of work he&rsquo;d done today and simply shook his head.<br/>&ldquo;No, I think I&rsquo;m going to stay a couple hours longer. But you and Peter should go home and maybe while you&rsquo;re there you can figure out a better strategy for Monopoly.&rdquo; Steve rolled his eyes.<br/>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Tony nodded his head.<br/>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll call you when I&rsquo;m on my way home.&rdquo; Steve nodded and stood up, shot a grin at Tony and then left. Tony let out a deep and heavy sigh, then turned back to his work and finally gave his full and undivided attention to his job.\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>\n\nSteve made dinner, ate it, made Peter&rsquo;s dinner, fed Peter, bathed Peter, read Peter to sleep <i>and</i> spent two hours surfing channels on the tv. Still, no Tony. Steve kept checking the clock, watching as the minutes ticked by. At first it didn&rsquo;t concern Steve that Tony hadn&rsquo;t returned, but after a while Steve began to worry. He started to pace around the apartment, constantly checking the clock. Tony had said he would stay a couple hours longer, so maybe this wasn&rsquo;t that strange. Not so unusual. Maybe Steve was simply overreacting, so Steve settled down on the couch and began to watch some bad late night reality tv show.\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>\n\nAfter another two hours, Steve rang. It was one am, and time for Tony to come home. Steve picked up the phone and rang, pacing around the apartment. Tony didn&rsquo;t answer. So Steve tried again, and again and when he didn&rsquo;t answer for the third time, Steve called the one person who he knew would definitely be awake at this hour.<br/>&ldquo;What do you want Steve?&rdquo; Natasha asked, she sounded tired, maybe she hadn&rsquo;t been awake.<br/>&ldquo;Are you at the compound?&rdquo; Steve asked and checked up on Peter, who was still fast asleep. <br/>&ldquo;Yeah, why? What&rsquo;s going on? Why aren&rsquo;t you asleep.&rdquo; She seemed to be on high alert now, fully awake and ready to help Steve with whatever problem he had.<br/>&ldquo;Is Tony there?&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t speak for a long time.<br/>&ldquo;Steve, did you call me in the middle of the night to keep tabs on Stark?&rdquo; Nat asked and sounded mildly irritated. A wave of guilt flashed through Steve, but it was one am and there son was in the next room and Tony hadn&rsquo;t come home.<br/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She heaved a deep and heavy sigh.<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go check the workshop and the kitchen.&rdquo; Nat murmured and a part of Steve relaxed a little.<br/>&ldquo;Thanks, it&rsquo;s just he said he&rsquo;d stay a while longer but it&rsquo;s late and I called and he didn&rsquo;t answer and-&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. Whatever.&rdquo; Nat muttered and Steve waited.<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if you were asleep Nat.&rdquo; Steve murmured and she sighed.<br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine Steve, and yes he&rsquo;s in the workshop.&rdquo; Steve relaxed, at least he knew where Tony was.<br/>&ldquo;Thanks Nat, can you put him on the phone?&rdquo; Steve asked and sat down on his couch.<br/>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Tony asked, he sounded confused and a part of Steve wanted to pick a fight with Tony, a wiser part knew better than that.<br/>&ldquo;Are you coming home soon?&rdquo; Steve asked and Tony swore.<br/>&ldquo;Sorry I lost track of time, I&rsquo;ll head home now-&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just stay at the compound tonight?&rdquo; Steve suggested and Tony didn&rsquo;t respond for a while. It had come out harsher than Steve had intended and he knew that Tony would take it the wrong way.<br/>&ldquo;I just lost track of time Steve-&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I know and I&rsquo;m not mad-&rdquo; But Tony interrupted before Steve could finish.<br/>&ldquo;Are you sure? Because you sound mad to me.&rdquo; Steve heaved a heavy sigh.<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad. You&rsquo;d just get more sleep if you spent the night at the compound and Pete and I can come in the morning.&rdquo; Steve explained and waited.<br/>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of me moving in if we have nights like this?&rdquo; Tony asked and Steve could already tell this was turning into a fight. <br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one night Tony, you said you lost track of time and it&rsquo;s not like every night is going to be like this-&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;But what if it is? I can&rsquo;t just stop working Steve and if you&rsquo;re going to be mad-&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad Tony!&rdquo; Steve hissed and was now starting to feel irritated by this conversation.<br/>&ldquo;You sound mad.&rdquo; Tony whispered and Steve sighed. He seemed to be sighing a lot nowadays.<br/>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we talk about this in the morning?&rdquo; Steve suggested and Tony simply hung up. With a loud groan, Steve flopped onto the couch and stared up at the ceiling. It seemed that he had fucked up. Although it wasn&rsquo;t entirely his fault. \n\n<br/></p><hr><p>\n\nTony was unable to sleep that night. After he handed back Nat&rsquo;s phone, he made a show of packing up. The second she had gone back to bed, Tony had started to work again. At one point he did try to take a nap on the couch, but the argument with Steve had echoed in his head. He hated this, hated the arguments. This wasn&rsquo;t right, this wasn&rsquo;t how this was supposed to be. So at four in the morning, Tony got in a cab and went back to the apartment. He found Steve asleep on the couch. Tony checked on Peter, relieved he was asleep and then crawled into the bed in the guest bedroom. He could have slept in here while Steve was away, but the room had been filled with boxes of Steve&rsquo;s stuff and Tony wasn&rsquo;t sure if he was allowed to move them then. The room had no such boxes anymore, and Tony crawled into the comfortable bed and dozed off into a fitful sleep.\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>From the looks of things, Steve had had as rough a night as Tony had. But then again, Steve had slept on the couch. Tony woke up to the smell of eggs and had made his way out of the guest bedroom. Steve, who was unaware that Tony had come home, screamed and threw a spoon at Tony&rsquo;s head.<br/>&ldquo;Is that how you take out hydra agents?&rdquo; Tony asked, staring at the spoon which had smacked him on the forehead.<br/>&ldquo;When did you get back?&rdquo; Steve demanded.<br/>&ldquo;Four am, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo; Tony shrugged and checked on Peter who had mercifully not been woken up by Steve terrifying scream.<br/>&ldquo;Did I wake him?&rdquo; Steve asked softly and Tony shook his head. <br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t call, I really did lose track of time.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I sounded mad last night, I really wasn&rsquo;t. I was just worried about you.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;You were mad and you had you had every right to be mad.&rdquo; Tony told Steve softly, he was shocked to see Nat walk into his workshop, even more so when she had handed over the phone. Tony could have sworn it had only been an hour, how wrong he was in that particular moment.<br/>&ldquo;Fine. I was a little mad, but I was mainly worried. I didn&rsquo;t know if something had happened to you or-&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m fine Steve.&rdquo; Tony didn&rsquo;t want to hear about Steve worrying about him. It just piled on the guilt that Tony felt.<br/>&ldquo;I know that now.&rdquo; Steve murmured and the room felt silent. Tony couldn&rsquo;t look away from Steve&rsquo;s eyes. They were a pale blue this morning, and the sun hit the back of his head, lighting up his hair and almost giving him a halo. What a perfect sight. America&rsquo;s golden boy with his golden halo. It was Steve who managed to look away, Steve who cleared his throat and cleaned out the eggs which had burned. Tony watched as Steve made breakfast and then turned on the tv. They watched the news quietly and Tony ate his eggs. <br/>&ldquo;What plans do you have for today?&rdquo; Tony asked and Steve shrugged.<br/>&ldquo;I was going to research all the ways to destroy you at monopoly.&rdquo; Tony snorted and Steve grinned at him.<br/>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that one cap.&rdquo; It was a nice change, usually only Pepper had the patience to play board games with Tony, and she beat him every time. It was nice to have someone else to play against.<br/>&ldquo;I also need to get Natasha her cupcakes, I woke her up last night so I need to make it up to her.&rdquo; Another flash of guilt, but Tony shoved it down. He would make it up to Nat, or she&rsquo;d forget about it within the next three days. Tony hoped for the latter, it was easier when Nat let things slide, rather than making it up to her. Tony had no idea how Clint constantly stayed in her good graces. There had to be some deep backstory behind those two. Tony let his mind drift off and wander about what that potential backstory could be when he heard Peter calling out to them.<br/>&ldquo;P-pa!&rdquo; Steve smiled at Tony and stood up.<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him.&rdquo; And Tony focused on the news, something about some upcoming charity ball for orphanages. Tony had heard about it nearly a million times, and had always donated at least some money to it in the past years. But he never thought about it for more than five minutes once a year. Now though, as Steve walked out with Peter in his arms, Tony decided he would donate more than the usual. Peter had been orphaned, and if he hadn&rsquo;t been dropped off at the compound&hellip;<br/>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Steve asked and tilted his head.<br/>&ldquo;Pepper usually makes me go to this thing, but should we go?&rdquo; Tony motioned to the ball and Steve tilted his head.<br/>&ldquo;Because of Peter?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Yeah, because of Peter.&rdquo; Steve seemed to think the idea over and nodded.<br/>&ldquo;When is it?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Two weeks.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; And then Steve put Peter down and went about making the kid his breakfast.</p>",

Tony who was buried in work, designing and programming and testing out new suits. Steve had asked if Tony had needed any help but Tony had simply shook his head and focused on something else. So Steve had sat down on the couch in the corner and entertained Peter.<br>\u201cCan you say papa for me Pete?\u201d Steve asked gently. Peter merely smiled up at Steve and Steve knew he loved this kid more than words could explain. He felt that fierce protectiveness wash over him again, <i>my son</i>. And god forbid if anyone ever hurt his son. <br>\u201cP-Pa.\u201d Steve\u2019s jaw dropped and Tony whirled and looked at them with wide, astonished eyes.<br>\u201cDid he just say his first word?\u201d Tony breathed and Steve nodded slightly.<br>\u201cI think so.\u201d Tony made his way over and crouched down in front of Peter.<br>\u201cCan you do it again Pete?\u201d Peter looked between them both and giggled.<br>\u201cSay papa Peter.\u201d Steve encouraged and Peter made another attempt.<br>\u201cP-pa.\u201d <br>\u201cClose enough.\u201d Tony chuckled and stared at Peter with so much love and adoration. This was it. They were a family.<br>\u201cWhat about Dad?\u201d Steve asked and Peter scrunched his face up in concentration.<br>\u201cP-Pa.\u201d He looked so excited and Steve grinned.<br>\u201cMaybe dad will be tomorrow.\u201d Tony murmured and Steve nodded.<br>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Steve studied Tony\u2019s mahogany eyes for a long moment before looking back at Peter. And then a startling realisation hit him.<br>\u201cWe have to call May!\u201d Tony nodded and pulled out his phone, she answered almost instantly.<br>\u201cHey Tony.\u201d<br>\u201cSay it Peter.\u201d Tony murmured and he did, May gasped aloud and Steve\u2019s grin grew wider.<br>\u201cDid he just speak?\u201d<br>\u201cYeah.\u201d Tony chuckled.<br>\u201cOh my gosh!\u201d May sounded ecstatic.<br>\u201cIt was a shock for us too.\u201d Tony murmured and took May off of speaker phone. He talked with her for a couple minutes before he sat back down in his desk chair.<br>\u201cSmile.\u201d Tony said and Steve looked up and saw as Tony took a photo. <br>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready!\u201d Steve called out and Tony was grinning at the picture.<br>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so good, this is perfect.\u201d Then Tony turned back to his desk and focused back on his work. Steve sighed and looked back down at Peter.<br>\u201cWe\u2019ll get him back for that one.\u201d Steve whispered.\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\nTony worked all day and made a lot of progress on the suits he was developing. But not as much progress as he would\u2019ve liked. Tony knew he could have done more if he\u2019d been alone. Because Steve and Peter were a constant distraction which decreased the amount of Tony\u2019s productivity. But Tony didn\u2019t mind. His mind wandered back to the hug, the way it felt for Steve\u2019s arms to be wrapped around Tony\u2019s body and- No. Tony couldn\u2019t continue to have these thoughts. He had to do something about this, because the longer he dwelled on that stupid hug, the higher the chance of Tony starting to have feelings for Steve. He had to stop this, because he and Steve would never be more than friends. When Tony opened his eyes and glanced over his shoulder, he found Steve was watching him.<br>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Steve asked gently and Tony nodded.<br>\u201cAlways.\u201d Steve\u2019s brows furrowed ever so slightly but he was wise enough to understand that he needed to let it go. <br>\u201cAre <i>you</i> okay?\u201d Tony retaliated. Steve smirked and nodded his head.<br>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just coming up with all the ways I\u2019m going to destroy you at Monopoly tonight.\u201d Steve told him and Tony couldn\u2019t stop the grin from appearing on his face.<br>\u201cNot a chance Rogers.\u201d Steve chuckled, and Tony had to look away.<br>\u201cYou should take a break, you\u2019ve been going at it for a while now.\u201d Steve advised, but Tony thought about the amount of work he\u2019d done today and simply shook his head.<br>\u201cNo, I think I\u2019m going to stay a couple hours longer. But you and Peter should go home and maybe while you\u2019re there you can figure out a better strategy for Monopoly.\u201d Steve rolled his eyes.<br>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Tony nodded his head.<br>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m on my way home.\u201d Steve nodded and stood up, shot a grin at Tony and then left. Tony let out a deep and heavy sigh, then turned back to his work and finally gave his full and undivided attention to his job.\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\nSteve made dinner, ate it, made Peter\u2019s dinner, fed Peter, bathed Peter, read Peter to sleep <i>and</i> spent two hours surfing channels on the tv. Still, no Tony. Steve kept checking the clock, watching as the minutes ticked by. At first it didn\u2019t concern Steve that Tony hadn\u2019t returned, but after a while Steve began to worry. He started to pace around the apartment, constantly checking the clock. Tony had said he would stay a couple hours longer, so maybe this wasn\u2019t that strange. Not so unusual. Maybe Steve was simply overreacting, so Steve settled down on the couch and began to watch some bad late night reality tv show.\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\nAfter another two hours, Steve rang. It was one am, and time for Tony to come home. Steve picked up the phone and rang, pacing around the apartment. Tony didn\u2019t answer. So Steve tried again, and again and when he didn\u2019t answer for the third time, Steve called the one person who he knew would definitely be awake at this hour.<br>\u201cWhat do you want Steve?\u201d Natasha asked, she sounded tired, maybe she hadn\u2019t been awake.<br>\u201cAre you at the compound?\u201d Steve asked and checked up on Peter, who was still fast asleep. <br>\u201cYeah, why? What\u2019s going on? Why aren\u2019t you asleep.\u201d She seemed to be on high alert now, fully awake and ready to help Steve with whatever problem he had.<br>\u201cIs Tony there?\u201d She didn\u2019t speak for a long time.<br>\u201cSteve, did you call me in the middle of the night to keep tabs on Stark?\u201d Nat asked and sounded mildly irritated. A wave of guilt flashed through Steve, but it was one am and there son was in the next room and Tony hadn\u2019t come home.<br>\u201cYes.\u201d She heaved a deep and heavy sigh.<br>\u201cI\u2019ll go check the workshop and the kitchen.\u201d Nat murmured and a part of Steve relaxed a little.<br>\u201cThanks, it\u2019s just he said he\u2019d stay a while longer but it\u2019s late and I called and he didn\u2019t answer and-\u201d<br>\u201cYeah, yeah. Whatever.\u201d Nat muttered and Steve waited.<br>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you were asleep Nat.\u201d Steve murmured and she sighed.<br>\u201cIt\u2019s fine Steve, and yes he\u2019s in the workshop.\u201d Steve relaxed, at least he knew where Tony was.<br>\u201cThanks Nat, can you put him on the phone?\u201d Steve asked and sat down on his couch.<br>\u201cHello?\u201d Tony asked, he sounded confused and a part of Steve wanted to pick a fight with Tony, a wiser part knew better than that.<br>\u201cAre you coming home soon?\u201d Steve asked and Tony swore.<br>\u201cSorry I lost track of time, I\u2019ll head home now-\u201d<br>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just stay at the compound tonight?\u201d Steve suggested and Tony didn\u2019t respond for a while. It had come out harsher than Steve had intended and he knew that Tony would take it the wrong way.<br>\u201cI just lost track of time Steve-\u201d<br>\u201cI know and I\u2019m not mad-\u201d But Tony interrupted before Steve could finish.<br>\u201cAre you sure? Because you sound mad to me.\u201d Steve heaved a heavy sigh.<br>\u201cI\u2019m not mad. You\u2019d just get more sleep if you spent the night at the compound and Pete and I can come in the morning.\u201d Steve explained and waited.<br>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of me moving in if we have nights like this?\u201d Tony asked and Steve could already tell this was turning into a fight. <br>\u201cIt\u2019s one night Tony, you said you lost track of time and it\u2019s not like every night is going to be like this-\u201d<br>\u201cBut what if it is? I can\u2019t just stop working Steve and if you\u2019re going to be mad-\u201d<br>\u201cI\u2019m not mad Tony!\u201d Steve hissed and was now starting to feel irritated by this conversation.<br>\u201cYou sound mad.\u201d Tony whispered and Steve sighed. He seemed to be sighing a lot nowadays.<br>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk about this in the morning?\u201d Steve suggested and Tony simply hung up. With a loud groan, Steve flopped onto the couch and stared up at the ceiling. It seemed that he had fucked up. Although it wasn\u2019t entirely his fault. \n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\nTony was unable to sleep that night. After he handed back Nat\u2019s phone, he made a show of packing up. The second she had gone back to bed, Tony had started to work again. At one point he did try to take a nap on the couch, but the argument with Steve had echoed in his head. He hated this, hated the arguments. This wasn\u2019t right, this wasn\u2019t how this was supposed to be. So at four in the morning, Tony got in a cab and went back to the apartment. He found Steve asleep on the couch. Tony checked on Peter, relieved he was asleep and then crawled into the bed in the guest bedroom. He could have slept in here while Steve was away, but the room had been filled with boxes of Steve\u2019s stuff and Tony wasn\u2019t sure if he was allowed to move them then. The room had no such boxes anymore, and Tony crawled into the comfortable bed and dozed off into a fitful sleep.\n\n<br></p><hr><p>From the looks of things, Steve had had as rough a night as Tony had. But then again, Steve had slept on the couch. Tony woke up to the smell of eggs and had made his way out of the guest bedroom. Steve, who was unaware that Tony had come home, screamed and threw a spoon at Tony\u2019s head.<br>\u201cIs that how you take out hydra agents?\u201d Tony asked, staring at the spoon which had smacked him on the forehead.<br>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d Steve demanded.<br>\u201cFour am, I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d Tony shrugged and checked on Peter who had mercifully not been woken up by Steve terrifying scream.<br>\u201cDid I wake him?\u201d Steve asked softly and Tony shook his head. <br>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t call, I really did lose track of time.\u201d<br>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I sounded mad last night, I really wasn\u2019t. I was just worried about you.\u201d<br>\u201cYou were mad and you had you had every right to be mad.\u201d Tony told Steve softly, he was shocked to see Nat walk into his workshop, even more so when she had handed over the phone.

They were a pale blue this morning, and the sun hit the back of his head, lighting up his hair and almost giving him a halo. What a perfect sight. America\u2019s golden boy with his golden halo.

Tony who was buried in work, designing and programming and testing out new suits. Steve had asked if Tony had needed any help but Tony had simply shook his head and focused on something else. So Steve had sat down on the couch in the corner and entertained Peter.<br>\u201cCan you say papa for me Pete?\u201d Steve asked gently. Peter merely smiled up at Steve and Steve knew he loved this kid more than words could explain. He felt that fierce protectiveness wash over him again, <i>my son</i>. And god forbid if anyone ever hurt his son. <br>\u201cP-Pa.\u201d Steve\u2019s jaw dropped and Tony whirled and looked at them with wide, astonished eyes.<br>\u201cDid he just say his first word?\u201d Tony breathed and Steve nodded slightly.<br>\u201cI think so.\u201d Tony made his way over and crouched down in front of Peter.<br>\u201cCan you do it again Pete?\u201d Peter looked between them both and giggled.<br>\u201cSay papa Peter.\u201d Steve encouraged and Peter made another attempt.<br>\u201cP-pa.\u201d <br>\u201cClose enough.\u201d Tony chuckled and stared at Peter with so much love and adoration. This was it. They were a family.<br>\u201cWhat about Dad?\u201d Steve asked and Peter scrunched his face up in concentration.<br>\u201cP-Pa.\u201d He looked so excited and Steve grinned.<br>\u201cMaybe dad will be tomorrow.\u201d Tony murmured and Steve nodded.<br>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Steve studied Tony\u2019s mahogany eyes for a long moment before looking back at Peter. And then a startling realisation hit him.<br>\u201cWe have to call May!\u201d Tony nodded and pulled out his phone, she answered almost instantly.<br>\u201cHey Tony.\u201d<br>\u201cSay it Peter.\u201d Tony murmured and he did, May gasped aloud and Steve\u2019s grin grew wider.<br>\u201cDid he just speak?\u201d<br>\u201cYeah.\u201d Tony chuckled.<br>\u201cOh my gosh!\u201d May sounded ecstatic.<br>\u201cIt was a shock for us too.\u201d Tony murmured and took May off of speaker phone. He talked with her for a couple minutes before he sat back down in his desk chair.<br>\u201cSmile.\u201d Tony said and Steve looked up and saw as Tony took a photo. <br>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready!\u201d Steve called out and Tony was grinning at the picture.<br>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so good, this is perfect.\u201d Then Tony turned back to his desk and focused back on his work. Steve sighed and looked back down at Peter.<br>\u201cWe\u2019ll get him back for that one.\u201d Steve whispered.\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\nTony worked all day and made a lot of progress on the suits he was developing. But not as much progress as he would\u2019ve liked. Tony knew he could have done more if he\u2019d been alone. Because Steve and Peter were a constant distraction which decreased the amount of Tony\u2019s productivity. But Tony didn\u2019t mind. His mind wandered back to the hug, the way it felt for Steve\u2019s arms to be wrapped around Tony\u2019s body and- No. Tony couldn\u2019t continue to have these thoughts. He had to do something about this, because the longer he dwelled on that stupid hug, the higher the chance of Tony starting to have feelings for Steve. He had to stop this, because he and Steve would never be more than friends. When Tony opened his eyes and glanced over his shoulder, he found Steve was watching him.<br>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Steve asked gently and Tony nodded.<br>\u201cAlways.\u201d Steve\u2019s brows furrowed ever so slightly but he was wise enough to understand that he needed to let it go. <br>\u201cAre <i>you</i> okay?\u201d Tony retaliated. Steve smirked and nodded his head.<br>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just coming up with all the ways I\u2019m going to destroy you at Monopoly tonight.\u201d Steve told him and Tony couldn\u2019t stop the grin from appearing on his face.<br>\u201cNot a chance Rogers.\u201d Steve chuckled, and Tony had to look away.<br>\u201cYou should take a break, you\u2019ve been going at it for a while now.\u201d Steve advised, but Tony thought about the amount of work he\u2019d done today and simply shook his head.<br>\u201cNo, I think I\u2019m going to stay a couple hours longer. But you and Peter should go home and maybe while you\u2019re there you can figure out a better strategy for Monopoly.\u201d Steve rolled his eyes.<br>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Tony nodded his head.<br>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m on my way home.\u201d Steve nodded and stood up, shot a grin at Tony and then left. Tony let out a deep and heavy sigh, then turned back to his work and finally gave his full and undivided attention to his job.\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\nSteve made dinner, ate it, made Peter\u2019s dinner, fed Peter, bathed Peter, read Peter to sleep <i>and</i> spent two hours surfing channels on the tv. Still, no Tony. Steve kept checking the clock, watching as the minutes ticked by. At first it didn\u2019t concern Steve that Tony hadn\u2019t returned, but after a while Steve began to worry. He started to pace around the apartment, constantly checking the clock. Tony had said he would stay a couple hours longer, so maybe this wasn\u2019t that strange. Not so unusual. Maybe Steve was simply overreacting, so Steve settled down on the couch and began to watch some bad late night reality tv show.\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\nAfter another two hours, Steve rang. It was one am, and time for Tony to come home. Steve picked up the phone and rang, pacing around the apartment. Tony didn\u2019t answer. So Steve tried again, and again and when he didn\u2019t answer for the third time, Steve called the one person who he knew would definitely be awake at this hour.<br>\u201cWhat do you want Steve?\u201d Natasha asked, she sounded tired, maybe she hadn\u2019t been awake.<br>\u201cAre you at the compound?\u201d Steve asked and checked up on Peter, who was still fast asleep. <br>\u201cYeah, why? What\u2019s going on? Why aren\u2019t you asleep.\u201d She seemed to be on high alert now, fully awake and ready to help Steve with whatever problem he had.<br>\u201cIs Tony there?\u201d She didn\u2019t speak for a long time.<br>\u201cSteve, did you call me in the middle of the night to keep tabs on Stark?\u201d Nat asked and sounded mildly irritated. A wave of guilt flashed through Steve, but it was one am and there son was in the next room and Tony hadn\u2019t come home.<br>\u201cYes.\u201d She heaved a deep and heavy sigh.<br>\u201cI\u2019ll go check the workshop and the kitchen.\u201d Nat murmured and a part of Steve relaxed a little.<br>\u201cThanks, it\u2019s just he said he\u2019d stay a while longer but it\u2019s late and I called and he didn\u2019t answer and-\u201d<br>\u201cYeah, yeah. Whatever.\u201d Nat muttered and Steve waited.<br>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you were asleep Nat.\u201d Steve murmured and she sighed.<br>\u201cIt\u2019s fine Steve, and yes he\u2019s in the workshop.\u201d Steve relaxed, at least he knew where Tony was.<br>\u201cThanks Nat, can you put him on the phone?\u201d Steve asked and sat down on his couch.<br>\u201cHello?\u201d Tony asked, he sounded confused and a part of Steve wanted to pick a fight with Tony, a wiser part knew better than that.<br>\u201cAre you coming home soon?\u201d Steve asked and Tony swore.<br>\u201cSorry I lost track of time, I\u2019ll head home now-\u201d<br>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just stay at the compound tonight?\u201d Steve suggested and Tony didn\u2019t respond for a while. It had come out harsher than Steve had intended and he knew that Tony would take it the wrong way.<br>\u201cI just lost track of time Steve-\u201d<br>\u201cI know and I\u2019m not mad-\u201d But Tony interrupted before Steve could finish.<br>\u201cAre you sure? Because you sound mad to me.\u201d Steve heaved a heavy sigh.<br>\u201cI\u2019m not mad. You\u2019d just get more sleep if you spent the night at the compound and Pete and I can come in the morning.\u201d Steve explained and waited.<br>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of me moving in if we have nights like this?\u201d Tony asked and Steve could already tell this was turning into a fight. <br>\u201cIt\u2019s one night Tony, you said you lost track of time and it\u2019s not like every night is going to be like this-\u201d<br>\u201cBut what if it is? I can\u2019t just stop working Steve and if you\u2019re going to be mad-\u201d<br>\u201cI\u2019m not mad Tony!\u201d Steve hissed and was now starting to feel irritated by this conversation.<br>\u201cYou sound mad.\u201d Tony whispered and Steve sighed. He seemed to be sighing a lot nowadays.<br>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk about this in the morning?\u201d Steve suggested and Tony simply hung up. With a loud groan, Steve flopped onto the couch and stared up at the ceiling. It seemed that he had fucked up. Although it wasn\u2019t entirely his fault. \n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\nTony was unable to sleep that night. After he handed back Nat\u2019s phone, he made a show of packing up. The second she had gone back to bed, Tony had started to work again. At one point he did try to take a nap on the couch, but the argument with Steve had echoed in his head. He hated this, hated the arguments. This wasn\u2019t right, this wasn\u2019t how this was supposed to be. So at four in the morning, Tony got in a cab and went back to the apartment. He found Steve asleep on the couch. Tony checked on Peter, relieved he was asleep and then crawled into the bed in the guest bedroom. He could have slept in here while Steve was away, but the room had been filled with boxes of Steve\u2019s stuff and Tony wasn\u2019t sure if he was allowed to move them then. The room had no such boxes anymore, and Tony crawled into the comfortable bed and dozed off into a fitful sleep.\n\n<br></p><hr><p>From the looks of things, Steve had had as rough a night as Tony had. But then again, Steve had slept on the couch. Tony woke up to the smell of eggs and had made his way out of the guest bedroom. Steve, who was unaware that Tony had come home, screamed and threw a spoon at Tony\u2019s head.<br>\u201cIs that how you take out hydra agents?\u201d Tony asked, staring at the spoon which had smacked him on the forehead.<br>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d Steve demanded.<br>\u201cFour am, I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d Tony shrugged and checked on Peter who had mercifully not been woken up by Steve terrifying scream.<br>\u201cDid I wake him?\u201d Steve asked softly and Tony shook his head. <br>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t call, I really did lose track of time.\u201d<br>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I sounded mad last night, I really wasn\u2019t. I was just worried about you.\u201d<br>\u201cYou were mad and you had you had every right to be mad.\u201d Tony told Steve softly, he was shocked to see Nat walk into his workshop, even more so when she had handed over the phone. Tony could have sworn it had only been an hour, how wrong he was in that particular moment.<br>\u201cFine. I was a little mad, but I was mainly worried. I didn\u2019t know if something had happened to you or-\u201d<br>\u201cBut I\u2019m fine Steve.\u201d Tony didn\u2019t want to hear about Steve worrying about him. It just piled on the guilt that Tony felt.<br>\u201cI know that now.\u201d Steve murmured and the room felt silent. Tony couldn\u2019t look away from Steve\u2019s eyes. They were a pale blue this morning, and the sun hit the back of his head, lighting up his hair and almost giving him a halo. What a perfect sight. America\u2019s golden boy with his golden halo. It was Steve who managed to look away, Steve who cleared his throat and cleaned out the eggs which had burned. Tony watched as Steve made breakfast and then turned on the tv. They watched the news quietly and Tony ate his eggs. <br>\u201cWhat plans do you have for today?\u201d Tony asked and Steve shrugged.<br>\u201cI was going to research all the ways to destroy you at monopoly.\u201d Tony snorted and Steve grinned at him.<br>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that one cap.\u201d It was a nice change, usually only Pepper had the patience to play board games with Tony, and she beat him every time. It was nice to have someone else to play against.<br>\u201cI also need to get Natasha her cupcakes, I woke her up last night so I need to make it up to her.\u201d Another flash of guilt, but Tony shoved it down. He would make it up to Nat, or she\u2019d forget about it within the next three days. Tony hoped for the latter, it was easier when Nat let things slide, rather than making it up to her. Tony had no idea how Clint constantly stayed in her good graces. There had to be some deep backstory behind those two. Tony let his mind drift off and wander about what that potential backstory could be when he heard Peter calling out to them.<br>\u201cP-pa!\u201d Steve smiled at Tony and stood up.<br>\u201cI\u2019ll get him.\u201d And Tony focused on the news, something about some upcoming charity ball for orphanages. Tony had heard about it nearly a million times, and had always donated at least some money to it in the past years. But he never thought about it for more than five minutes once a year. Now though, as Steve walked out with Peter in his arms, Tony decided he would donate more than the usual. Peter had been orphaned, and if he hadn\u2019t been dropped off at the compound\u2026<br>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asked and tilted his head.<br>\u201cPepper usually makes me go to this thing, but should we go?\u201d Tony motioned to the ball and Steve tilted his head.<br>\u201cBecause of Peter?\u201d<br>\u201cYeah, because of Peter.\u201d Steve seemed to think the idea over and nodded.<br>\u201cWhen is it?\u201d<br>\u201cTwo weeks.\u201d<br>\u201cOkay.\u201d And then Steve put Peter down and went about making the kid his breakfast.</p>",

The room had no such boxes anymore, and Tony crawled into the comfortable bed and dozed off into a fitful sleep.\n\n<br /></p><hr /><p>From the looks of things, Steve had had as rough a night as Tony had. But then again, Steve had slept on the couch. Tony woke up to the smell of eggs and had made his way out of the guest bedroom. Steve, who was unaware that Tony had come home, screamed and threw a spoon at Tony&rsquo;s head.<br />&ldquo;Is that how you take out hydra agents?&rdquo; Tony asked, staring at the spoon which had smacked him on the forehead.<br />&ldquo;When did you get back?&rdquo; Steve demanded.<br />&ldquo;Four am, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo; Tony shrugged and checked on Peter who had mercifully not been woken up by Steve terrifying scream.<br />&ldquo;Did I wake him?&rdquo; Steve asked softly and Tony shook his head. <br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t call, I really did lose track of time.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I sounded mad last night, I really wasn&rsquo;t. I was just worried about you.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You were mad and you had you had every right to be mad.&rdquo; Tony told Steve softly, he was shocked to see Nat walk into his workshop, even more so when she had handed over the phone. Tony could have sworn it had only been an hour, how wrong he was in that particular moment.<br />&ldquo;Fine. I was a little mad, but I was mainly worried. I didn&rsquo;t know if something had happened to you or-&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m fine Steve.&rdquo; Tony didn&rsquo;t want to hear about Steve worrying about him. It just piled on the guilt that Tony felt.<br />&ldquo;I know that now.&rdquo; Steve murmured and the room felt silent. Tony couldn&rsquo;t look away from Steve&rsquo;s eyes. They were a pale blue this morning, and the sun hit the back of his head, lighting up his hair and almost giving him a halo. What a perfect sight. America&rsquo;s golden boy with his golden halo. It was Steve who managed to look away, Steve who cleared his throat and cleaned out the eggs which had burned. Tony watched as Steve made breakfast and then turned on the tv. They watched the news quietly and Tony ate his eggs. <br />&ldquo;What plans do you have for today?&rdquo; Tony asked and Steve shrugged.<br />&ldquo;I was going to research all the ways to destroy you at monopoly.&rdquo; Tony snorted and Steve grinned at him.<br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that one cap.&rdquo; It was a nice change, usually only Pepper had the patience to play board games with Tony, and she beat him every time. It was nice to have someone else to play against.<br />&ldquo;I also need to get Natasha her cupcakes, I woke her up last night so I need to make it up to her.&rdquo; Another flash of guilt, but Tony shoved it down. He would make it up to Nat, or she&rsquo;d forget about it within the next three days. Tony hoped for the latter, it was easier when Nat let things slide, rather than making it up to her. Tony had no idea how Clint constantly stayed in her good graces. There had to be some deep backstory behind those two. Tony let his mind drift off and wander about what that potential backstory could be when he heard Peter calling out to them.<br />&ldquo;P-pa!&rdquo; Steve smiled at Tony and stood up.<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him.&rdquo; And Tony focused on the news, something about some upcoming charity ball for orphanages. Tony had heard about it nearly a million times, and had always donated at least some money to it in the past years. But he never thought about it for more than five minutes once a year. Now though, as Steve walked out with Peter in his arms, Tony decided he would donate more than the usual. Peter had been orphaned, and if he hadn&rsquo;t been dropped off at the compound&hellip;<br />&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Steve asked and tilted his head.<br />&ldquo;Pepper usually makes me go to this thing, but should we go?&rdquo; Tony motioned to the ball and Steve tilted his head.<br />&ldquo;Because of Peter?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yeah, because of Peter.&rdquo; Steve seemed to think the idea over and nodded.<br />&ldquo;When is it?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Two weeks.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; And then Steve put Peter down and went about making the kid his breakfast.</p>",

She exchanged a look with Bucky, knowing it would be security announcing a visitor. If it were Steve, he would just come up, and no one else was scheduled to visit.</p><p>At least tonight she\u2019d gotten the chance to eat the spaghetti before being interrupted. They\u2019d managed to have an enjoyable dinner in which they\u2019d discussed a few of her projects in greater detail without snapping, snarling, or yelling at each other.</p><p>She was pleasantly full. In fact, she\u2019d eaten more today than she usually did in three days. Barnes was obsessed with stuffing food in her face and with cutting back her caffeine intake. She\u2019d reached for her fifth cup of coffee when they\u2019d returned from the lab, only to be handed a cup of tea instead. As she\u2019d been on the phone with the Head of Oncology at Johns Hopkins, she hadn\u2019t the ability to bitch Barnes out, ending up drinking the surprisingly tasty tea.</p><p>By six he\u2019d been dragging her to her feet, refusing to let her stay longer her first day back, and hustled her out the door, down the elevator, and into the car even as she protested she still had work to do. He\u2019d ignored her, and by the time they got to the parking garage beneath her apartment, Penny had been dozing off in the back seat.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>When Bucky had smirked at her standing in the open car door, Penny had just rolled her eyes and shooed him out of the way, deciding a bath was on the docket for tonight after dinner. She hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d saved the pasta from the night before, but he\u2019d muttered about waste not want not something she remembered his mother saying, and gone to heat them both plates while she\u2019d changed out of her work clothes.</p><p>Bucky\u2019s suit jacket hung on the back of one of the bar stools along with his shoulder harness. He hadn\u2019t bothered to change himself yet, though his sleeves were rolled to the elbows as he\u2019d been helping dry the dishes. When he answered the house phone, it was with a blunt, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Penny watched his face harden and pulled the plug on the sink. She\u2019d put on leggings and a tank top, adding thick socks and a warm wool cardigan she wrapped tighter around herself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck what he\u2019s insisting,\u201d Bucky growled. \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky?\u201d she murmured, stepping closer. He mouthed the words, <i>call your lawyer,</i> and caused her heart to kick erratically when she scrambled for her phone.</p><p>\u201cTell Detective McGilvery he can cool his heels in the lobby until Miss Rogers lawyer arrives and ride up with her.\u201d He hung up before the guard could respond and looked pointedly at Penny.</p><p>\u201cTamara? I\u2019m sorry to call you so late, but the Detective from earlier is in my lobby. Alright, I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d Penny hung up and placed her phone on the island before gripping her elbows. \u201cWhat do we tell him?\u201d</p><p>Bucky moved around the counter to stand before her and gently rub her upper arms. \u201cThe truth. You went down to get in your car. It blew up, and in the process of getting to your panic room to wait for Steve, the guard shot at you, and the men were already waiting when you got upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he asks about why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell the truth. You don\u2019t know why,\u201d Bucky said, drawing her in for a hug. \u201cI\u2019m right here, Pen. If he gets out of line, I\u2019ll kick his ass out of here.\u201d</p><p>She leaned into him, finding his warmth so comforting, and wrapped her arms around his waist. It was ridiculously easy to accept his help. It was even easier to rest her forehead against his throat and breathe his scent, something musky with a hint of citrus. Bucky\u2019s hand gently stroked her hair, his fingers tangling and carding, working through the loose curls she\u2019d released from her ponytail earlier.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s weird, but I liked having you around today,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cIt was\u2026 enlightening,\u201d Bucky chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re so damn smart, Pen. I can see why Steve brags so much.\u201d</p><p>Penny lifted her head and smirked up at him. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t pay attention?\u201d</p><p>Something flared to life in his eyes, and his hand closed in her hair. \u201cSome things stuck,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>His metal hand ever so gently cupped her cheek. His thumb swept over her lip and paused in the center. He tugged it down, rubbing a little. It made Penny\u2019s heart skip and the breath catch in her lungs. His gaze jumped from her lips to her eyes, and Penny could feel her cheeks warm at his look of appreciation.</p><p>\u201cYou sure grew up pretty, Pen,\u201d he said softly. \u201cOne gorgeous dame.\u201d</p><p><i>You sure grew up pretty</i>\u2026 The words sent a shiver of memory through her which seemed to echo in her head. Terror streaked down her spine, and she ripped herself away from Bucky, her hand flying to her mouth as bile rose up her throat when she almost lost the dinner she\u2019d just eaten.</p><p>\u201cPenny?\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice rose with concern. \u201cBaby what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she croaked. When he tried to touch her, she skittered out from under his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny.\u201d Bucky held his hands up and out, not touching her but not allowing her to move away from where he cornered her against the kitchen island. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. Tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s nothing. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPen,\u201d he murmured, sliding closer. \u201cIt does matter.\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d buried the memories of that time so deep she\u2019d thought she\u2019d gotten rid of them. Now, with a single simple utterance, they were pounding at her, wanting out, shaking the very foundations of everything she\u2019d done to make herself immune to them. \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t, Bucky. Don\u2019t make me do it,\u201d she whimpered, his face seeming to rise out of the dark in her mind.</p><p>Penny squeezed her eyes tightly closed, fighting with every ounce of her being to shut it out. To shut <i>him </i>out. Bucky\u2019s arms wrapped around her and Penny cried out, jerking against him when he wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Pen. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to. I swear. Just breathe, baby. You\u2019re gonna have a panic attack if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She went limp, unable to fight him and the memories at the same time. When Bucky lifted her up, she wrapped herself around him like a snake and held on until he deposited her on the dark grey sofa in the living room and dragged the white throw from the back to tuck around her.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know what the trigger had been, but he knew fear when he saw it. This wasn&rsquo;t from her recent trauma. This was old, deeply buried, and painful. A wound she hid that had festered. Once she was covered beneath the heavy blanket, Bucky gently collected her hands.</p><p>\u201cPenny.\u201d He didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon&rsquo;t, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, doll, I won&rsquo;t push,\u201d not yet anyway, \u201cbut have you talked to someone about this?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and looked away. \u201cIt was a long time ago. I thought I&rsquo;d gotten past it.\u201d</p><p>Shame filled her face. Embarrassment followed. Bucky prayed as he hadn&rsquo;t in years that what he suspected was wrong, but he\u2019d seen enough faces of abuse to recognize it. To find it on hers, on Penelope&rsquo;s, broke something inside him.</p><p>Nat\u2019s voice whispered in his mind. <i>You weren&rsquo;t the cause, but you made her choice easier.</i></p><p>\u201cMy God, Pen. My God,\u201d he whispered, horrified as moments from that night began to click together in his mind.</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t. Please, James. Not now,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>He dropped his head to her thigh and breathed through his mouth until the shaking stopped. They were about to have unwelcome guests. Being this out of control could be dangerous.</p><p>The light touch of her hand in his hair nearly broke him all over again. \u201cI could really use a stiff drink, Buck,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He lifted his head to look at her. The sad smile shattered his heart. But then she cupped his cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Buck.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t, but she was trying to pull herself together, and he rose to stand on weak legs, and stumble his way to the brass and glass cart near the fireplace where he poured three fingers of scotch for her, and an entire tumbler for himself. He drank half of it before returning to her side.</p><p>She took the glass but gripped his hand before he could walk away. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn&rsquo;t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause none of it was your fault,\u201d she sighed, appearing small and fragile.</p><p>He threw the rest of the scotch down his throat relishing the burn which dried the threatening tears but didn&rsquo;t let go of her hand. \u201cSteve doesn&rsquo;t know, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone?\u201d</p><p>She pressed the tumbler to her cheek. \u201cBecca.\u201d</p><p>He ground his teeth together and put the glass down before he broke it. \u201cI&rsquo;m sorry, Pen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t look up but didn&rsquo;t release his hand either. That single point of contact was the only thing keeping him steady in his suddenly upside down world. He wanted to wrap his arms around her and hold her close. Comfort her like he should have all those years ago. Shame made him sick to his stomach for how he&rsquo;d treated her that night. It rolled in his gut.</p><p>He wanted to ask. It was worse not knowing the extent of how badly he\u2019d missed the signs. There he was, jealous, angry, thinking she&rsquo;d let someone paw at her, only to find out-</p><p>He slammed the brakes on that train of thought when the sound of the elevator starting its ascent dinged through the main floor of the apartment.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got this,\u201d she assured him, looking a little steadier than she had, though the erratic tripping of her heart concerned him.</p><p>\u201cTake deep breaths, Pen,\u201d he murmured, releasing her fingers to stride up the few steps from her sunken living area and cross the floor to wait arms crossed before the elevator.</p><p>No wonder she didn&rsquo;t date. She didn&rsquo;t trust men.</p><p>When Bucky caught a glimpse of himself in the polished doors, he thrust a hand through his hair and quickly rolled down his sleeves. He had his glove out and on, and a semblance of control returned to his face before the doors opened.</p><p>Detective McGilvrey was, according to his record, a good cop. But even good cops on paper could be bad guys. Bucky didn&rsquo;t trust his squeaky clean record.</p><p>When the second ding announced the arrival of the elevator, he slipped his right hand to the small of his back and gripped the Glock tucked there.</p><p>Tamara burst forth, paused, her eyes darting over him, before stepping around Bucky to head for the living room. It was clear she&rsquo;d come from some class as her hair was tied up, her clothes were leggings and a tank top over a colourful sports bra beneath a warm coat, and the sky-high heels from earlier were now running shoes.</p><p>\u201cMiss Smith,\u201d he nodded to Tamara.</p><p>\u201cSergeant Barnes,\u201d she said, her eyes sharp and face pinched. Evidently, her ride up in the elevator hadn&rsquo;t been a pleasant one with the detective for company.</p><p>\u201cMcGilvery,\u201d he growled at the man. \u201cMiss Rogers has had a long day. Make it quick and watch yourself our I&rsquo;ll be seeing you out of the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like, \u201cThe fast way,\u201d should be tacked onto that statement,\u201d he muttered, indicating the glass windows and balcony with a jerk of his chin.</p><p>A slow smile spread over Bucky&rsquo;s mouth when he stepped out of the way and motioned the man to proceed him, his right hand still gripping his gun. \u201cTake it whatever way you want.\u201d</p><p>McGilvery&rsquo;s shoes clicked on the floors, and Bucky smirked when the detective became aware his did not. The man&rsquo;s shoulders tightened and rose an inch before he forced them to relax, but Bucky could see the way the hair on the back of his neck stood up.</p><p>\u201cYou ex-military?\u201d McGilvery asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen is anyone ever <i>ex</i>-military?\u201d Bucky murmured.</p><p>\u201cMarines, two tours in Afghanistan. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I&rsquo;m stupid, Detective? You know who I am,\u201d Bucky chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I do. I&rsquo;m a fan. Never thought I&rsquo;d come face to face with James Barnes when I went to speak with Miss Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoping for Steve?\u201d Bucky asked.</p><p>\u201cMiss Romanoff actually.\u201d</p><p>Bucky snorted. \u201cThe Widow would eat you alive.\u201d</p><p>McGilvery shot him a look and a wry smile. \u201cWould you think less of me if that was what I was hoping for?\u201d</p><p>A chuckle escaped him. The guy was charismatic when he wanted to be; Bucky would give him that. It wasn&rsquo;t hard to see Penny&rsquo;s blonde head where she was propped in the corner of the couch in her wide open floor plan, and Bucky followed McGilvery into the living room where Tamara had taken a seat beside Penny. Bucky stopped at Penny&rsquo;s side and laid his hand gently on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMiss Rogers, thank you for seeing me. It&rsquo;s rather difficult to get past all your defences,\u201d McGilvery said, taking a seat across the coffee table from her.</p><p>\u201cNot difficult enough,\u201d Penny murmured, sipping from her cup.</p><p>\u201cI know you&rsquo;ve been through a trying time. I&rsquo;ll make this quick and painless,\u201d McGilvery said with a smile.</p><p>Penny shuddered beneath Bucky&rsquo;s hand. \u201cI&rsquo;d appreciate you getting on with it then, Detective instead of repeating the words my assailant used to see if you can get a reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk your questions, Detective,\u201d Tamara said sharply.</p><p>\u201cNate, please ladies. No need for formalities. After all, it&rsquo;s not as if Miss Rogers had anything to do with her assault.\u201d He looked straight at Penny.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d Penny snapped.</p><p>\u201cJust what are you implying, Detective? That my client hired those people? For what purpose?\u201d Tamara demanded.</p><p>\u201cPeople have done stranger things for publicity, or to cover up something else. After all, you&rsquo;ve got that nasty company audit coming up. What better way to push it back then an attack on the owner.\u201d</p><p>Penny stiffened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>McGilvery smirked. \u201cCome now, Miss Rogers. Don&rsquo;t play innocent. Your capital gains and losses are off the charts. And with the rumours you&rsquo;ll be going public in the next year swirling, it was bound to happen that the IRS would be sticking their nose in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky, I need my phone,\u201d she breathed on a rush of air.</p><p>Though he didn&rsquo;t like leaving her, it wasn&rsquo;t far from the kitchen, and he could see all the players easily enough. When he returned with it, no one had moved or spoken. Penny took it from him, dialled a preset number, clicked the speaker button, and set it on the coffee table in front of her.</p><p>It rang five times before he picked it up. \u201cPenny, dear! How are you?\u201d From the sound of the background noise, the man was partying rather hard.</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Marcus!\u201d Penny snapped. \u201cAm I being audited?\u201d</p><p>Silence, then the background noise faded as a door clicked shut. \u201cLook, Penny\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, Marcus! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?\u201d she exploded.</p><p>\u201cIt was your first day back!\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cMarcus, don\u2019t! From the sounds of it, this isn&rsquo;t something you <i>just </i>found out about! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s fine, Penny. I&rsquo;ve got it under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;d better,\u201d she snarled and hung up, an unholy fire blazing in her eyes. \u201cAs you can see, Detective, I have only just been made aware of this. And as my brother has already stated, the attack on me had to do with getting back at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith an inside twist,\u201d McGilvery said. \u201cAfter all, your building has more security than most in the city. They had to have help getting in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new higher security guard was the source of that, Detective, as you should also know,\u201d Tamara snapped. \u201cMy client had nothing to do with what&rsquo;s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were they after, Penelope? What were they looking for in your office?\u201d McGilvery pressed, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t know!\u201d Penny said, slamming her glass down on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cThis interview is over,\u201d Bucky stated coldly, motion for McGilvery to stand up.</p><p>\u201cThis had nothing to do with your brother, did it? We can&rsquo;t protect you if you don&rsquo;t coopera-&ldquo;</p><p>McGilvery never got to finish his sentence when Bucky wrapped his gloved hand around the man&rsquo;s throat, thumb and forefinger squeezing his jawbone hard enough to make it clear Bucky could and would break it to shut him up, and lifted the large man with minimal effort to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI said you&rsquo;re done. Time to go.\u201d He jerked the detective around and gave him a shove which sent him stumbling toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI could have you arrested for assaulting an officer!\u201d McGilvery snarled.</p><p>\u201cYou could try,\u201d Bucky smiled darkly. \u201cBut then, I outrank you, <i>Detective</i>. So you go ahead. Let&rsquo;s see what happens.\u201d</p><p>McGilvery ground his teeth together and stormed for the elevator. When the doors opened, Bucky reached around and pounded the button for the lobby.</p><p>\u201cThis isn&rsquo;t over,\u201d Nate stated as the doors began to close.</p><p>Bucky caught them before they could. \u201cYou just came into Penelope Rogers home and harassed her. Yeah, Detective, it is. And when I explain this fucking shit show to her brother and just how upset she was by it, boy, you&rsquo;ll be lucky to keep your badge.\u201d Bucky let the doors go on McGilvery&rsquo;s pale face.</p><p>Penny was speaking quietly with Tamara when he returned. \u201cDid you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, I didn&rsquo;t. I swear. I don&rsquo;t know why he didn&rsquo;t contact legal as soon as the notice arrived.\u201d Tamara fidgeted with her shirt. \u201cMarcus has been\u2026 distant lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistant?\u201d Penny frowned. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhispered conversations. Late night texts. He disappears for hours and won&rsquo;t tell me where he&rsquo;s gone. Penny, I know I&rsquo;m not exactly an <i>attentive </i>girlfriend being busy with my firm, but I thought\u2026 we were happy. Now? I don&rsquo;t know,\u201d she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tam.\u201d Penny threw her arms around the woman. \u201cI&rsquo;m so sorry. I haven&rsquo;t exactly been the best friend these last few years, have I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all busy now, but I do miss Friday night drinks,\u201d Tamara sighed, hugging her back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to try harder,\u201d Penny announced.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m in!\u201d Tamara laughed. \u201cUgh, but not tonight. I smell like spin class.\u201d</p><p>Penny\u2019s nose wrinkled. \u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Tamara smirked. \u201cKick a girl when she&rsquo;s down. And in front of hot bodyguard. Some friend you are.\u201d</p><p>A snort left Penny when she turned to look at Bucky, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. \u201cHe&rsquo;s not that hot. I&rsquo;ve seen better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour pretty boy brother doesn&rsquo;t count,\u201d Bucky groused, causing both women to laugh.</p><p>***</p><p>Later, after Tamara and Penny had spent another hour visiting and regaling Bucky with stories of their university adventures, he showed Tamara to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cSergeant?\u201d she said softly, her hand hovering over the button for the lobby. \u201cTake care of her. She acts tough, but she&rsquo;s more fragile than people know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe&rsquo;s stronger than you think, Miss Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven strong people can break under this kind of stress. She&rsquo;s terrible at needing people. I think she&rsquo;s going to need you, and not just for protection.\u201d</p><p>Tamara\u2019s dark eyes locked with his as the elevator doors closed. Something in them warned him to heed her request.</p><p>Bucky turned around to find the living room empty and sighed, wondering if Penny had gone to bed. He had questions. Lots of questions. Was he ever going to get answers? Then the light clicked on in her office, and he headed down the hall.</p><p>Penny was talking to her AI when he arrived in the doorway. \u201cFriday, you remember those numbers you said were funky in the last round of financials Marcus sent us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Penny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to take a closer look,\u201d she all but growled. \u201cFull scan. In-depth. Dig deep, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Friday murmured.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d Bucky asked, striding into the room.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d she said, glancing his way.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t sleep tonight,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be sleeping anyway.\u201d She stood to her full height, the look on her face the bone-chilling one of the Ice Queen. \u201cThe only reason I can think of for him not telling me about this when it happened? Marcus has been cooking my books. My books! Dammit!\u201d She brought her fist down on the desk hard enough it had to hurt.</p><p>\u201cPen, if he has you\u2019ll find it,\u201d he said, striding forward to collect her hands before she could do herself further damage.</p><p>\u201cWhy, though?\u201d she asked, suddenly sounding lost and confused along with angry. \u201cHe\u2019s paid better than anyone else on staff. The man makes seven figures a year! There\u2019s no reason to steal from me. And these rumours about going public? That\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve heard it today! What the hell is going on in my company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d Bucky murmured, releasing her hands to frame her face. The hurt in her eyes gutted him. \u201cPeople steal for any number of reasons, but if he was embezzling from your company, and he thought killing you would give him control and get the government off his back, allowing him the time to take the company public and replace the funds he\u2019d stolen\u2026 Penny, that\u2019s motive.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled sharply.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he murmured, gently massaging the tight muscles of her neck. \u201cYou run the numbers. I\u2019m going to work a deep dive into Marcus\u2019s background. I already skimmed the surface today, but I\u2019ll look deeper and see what I can find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She closed her eyes and exhaled hard. Her shoulders slumped right before her forehead landed on his chest. \u201cI hate all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Pen. I know,\u201d Bucky murmured, hugging her carefully. \u201cI\u2019ll make the coffee.\u201d He patted her back and headed for the kitchen.</p><p>***</p><p>Hours later, Bucky had a sick feeling in his stomach when he set his tablet down and looked at Penny dozing off at her desk. He had more questions then he did answers, but one thing had become glaringly apparent.</p><p>Taft had ties to Hydra.</p><p>Penny\u2019s eyes closed and stayed that way. Her breathing deepened, and Bucky stood slowly to his feet. He may have made the coffee, but he hadn\u2019t promised to make it caffeinated. He preferred tea anyway. Too many cups of coffee and he was jittering, on edge, and surly. Tea had a much more soothing effect and didn\u2019t make him jumpy.</p><p>\u201cFriday,\u201d he murmured, still watching Penny.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sergeant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still compiling the data,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment before a sound like a sigh registered. \u201cI have looked at the last five years of financials from Mr. Taft. All five years show discrepancies. The information Penny has been given does not correlate with what has been coming in and going out from the different departments. I have also found two departments which do not exist. One has money being syphoned into it. The other has money going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying someone is washing their money through Penny\u2019s company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears so,\u201d Friday murmured. \u201cBut the money going out is higher than what is coming in. So far, thirty million is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Bucky hissed.</p><p>\u201cAnd I am not yet finished. Penny has had this company for ten years. If Taft has been doing this since the beginning, it will be higher.\u201d</p><p>Bucky scrubbed his hand over his face. \u201cFuck. Can you follow the money? See where it is going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have. It is routed many times into offshore accounts, and while I am talented, I am not Jarvis. I do not have the ability to slip past their firewalls to see where it has gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying Stark\u2019s AI could get us all the way to the end point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is highly probable,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>He pulled his phone from his pocket and made the call, unsurprised when Stark answered the phone at three in the morning.</p><p>\u201cTinman, what do you want? It better not be that arm. It was perfect when you left.\u201d</p><p>Bucky snorted at that after what Penny had to say about it earlier. \u201cHardly, Stark. I need your AI.\u201d</p><p>Tony remained silent for a moment before muttering, \u201cHe\u2019s already in the vehicle. What more could you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday says Jarvis can do what she can\u2019t. I need your AI to follow the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, money. And before you ask, no, I won\u2019t tell you what money. Let\u2019s just say it has to do with Penny and why she was attacked. Can I borrow him or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarnes, Jarvis isn\u2019t I toy I can lend you, you can hand back when you\u2019re done. Once he\u2019s in the system, he\u2019s in. You can\u2019t limit what he does and what he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday?\u201d Bucky murmured. \u201cThoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps\u2026 Jarvis could teach me what I need to know to be of better assistance to Penny? I would appreciate the company,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Friday?\u201d Stark asked.</p><p>\u201cPenny\u2019s Jarvis,\u201d Bucky muttered. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll email you a link. Open it and set your phone on Penelope\u2019s desk.\u201d</p><p>Stark hung up, and a second later Bucky\u2019s phone chimed with the email. \u201cYou sure about this, Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I need the assistance,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Bucky took a deep breath, shot a glance at Penny, and blew it out. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna skin me, I just know it.\u201d Still, he tapped the link and laid his phone on her desk before moving to her side and lifting her from her chair.</p><p>She mumbled something unintelligible and curled into him trustingly. Bucky\u2019s heart lurched. Her trust after what he\u2019d learned today was humbling, and while he wanted answers, tonight wasn\u2019t the time to ask for them. But he vowed to be more careful with her.</p><p>Striding from the room, Bucky took her up the stairs two at a time. She was too light to his mind, and even at rest, he could hear the strange fluttering of her heart. It didn\u2019t beat as it should but skipped and jumped around. The sound was odd, but he pushed aside for later contemplation.</p><p>He took her to her bed and laid her down, gently removing her sweater and socks before covering her with the throw from the foot of her bed. It was a moment of deja vu, but this time he sat on the edge of it and brushed her hair from her cheek. Her face was soft in sleep; her long lashes pillowed on her cheeks. She was beautiful no matter how he looked at her, but now she looked fragile and so very innocent.</p><p>Guilt soured his stomach again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pen,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSorry for not seeing it then. So damn sorry for how I acted. I was a stupid, jealous idiot. I thought\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter what I thought. I should never have done what I did when you were upset.\u201d</p><p>She surprised him when she rolled over and looked at him, her blue eyes dark with memories. \u201cI had such a crush on you.\u201d</p><p>Bucky looked away, more guilt weighing on him. \u201cI was immature and stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to hate you. I did for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me what happened?\u201d he asked, his voice breaking.</p><p>This time she looked away. Then she sat up, pulled her knees to her chest, and set her chin on them. \u201cBecca and I went to that party. I was feeling pretty good what with being newly seventeen and having finally caught the notice of James Barnes. I think I was living on a virtual high with how giddy spending time with you made me feel,\u201d she smirked a little, then sighed. \u201cMarcy\u2019s parents were out of town, and by the time we got there, the party was huge. Becca was seeing Kevin at the time and ditched me as soon as she found him, but I was used to it. I love her, but the girl was boy crazy. I went and got a drink and hung out with some other friends, then\u2026\u201d she hesitated, her breath catching, \u201cthis guy came up and started talking to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know him?\u201d Bucky asked, wondering if she went to school with them.</p><p>Penny shook her head. \u201cHe was older than me. Some friend of a friend\u2019s brother or something.\u201d She closed her eyes and set her cheek on her knee; her face turned toward him. \u201cHe offered to get me a drink.\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped into his stomach. \u201cPen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stupid thing is, I knew better, but I thought that could never happen to me. I kept thinking that right up until I came to with him on top of me.\u201d Tears filled her voice, hoarse and torn enough to make Bucky\u2019s ache in sympathy. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him, but he knew me. He said, \u201cI sure grew up pretty,\u201d and thanked me for the fuck. I was so horrified and disgusted both with him and myself I threw up over the side of the bed. It freaked him out, and he got off of me, threw out the condom he\u2019d used, got dressed and left. For a moment, all I could think was, \u201cThank God he used protection.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny.\u201d Hearing it was like being stabbed with a knife to the heart over and over.</p><p>\u201cI tore my shirt getting dressed I was in such a hurry to get the hell out of there, but I could taste him in my mouth.\u201d She gave a silent gasp, tears escaping past her closed lids. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what he did. I hurt&hellip; everywhere, but he\u2019d been in my mouth\u2026\u201d</p><p>Bucky wanted to reach out and hold her but was afraid to touch her until she groped for his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo I stopped in the kitchen and grabbed a can of beer, but I was shaking so hard I spilled it on myself. I drank half of it before I couldn\u2019t taste him anymore and then left, running home to hide in the treehouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere I showed up and\u2026\u201d Bucky couldn\u2019t finish. \u201cGod, Pen.\u201d The tears he\u2019d been fighting spilled down his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m the biggest jerk.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know. I was too numb and too sick and embarrassed and horrified to be able to express myself. I could hardly admit it to myself, let alone tell you. God!\u201d She gave a choked laugh. \u201cI was terrified to tell anyone. So scared you\u2019d be as disgusted with me as I was with myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Penny! Of course not! Fuck, if Steve and I had known, we would have hunted that fucker down and-\u201d He cut himself off from finishing with <i>castrated him.</i></p><p>\u201cMade him eat his own balls?\u201d she murmured, her ocean eyes peering out at him from behind her wet lashes.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that, yeah,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou know not every man is like that.\u201d</p><p>She gave a tired sigh. \u201cI know that in theory, but then I met Aaron in Uni.\u201d</p><p>His blood froze. Not twice. If she said it happened twice, he was going to lose his mind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d she murmured, evidently seeing the panic on his face. \u201cWe dated, but I couldn\u2019t\u2026 when things would get physical, I got\u2026\u201d Red filled her cheeks as she turned her face away. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember what happened thanks to the drugs, but I just\u2026 just couldn\u2019t. And he was okay with it. He didn\u2019t push me for sex. I was so thankful until I realized he was using me. He stole one of my very first designs and tried to pass it off as his own. Thankfully I had the documents and things to back up my claim, but when I confronted him about it and asked him if anything about our relationship was real,\u201d she pressed her forehead to her knees, \u201che laughed,\u201d Penny whispered. \u201cLaughed and called me frigid. He and his buddies had quite the chuckle over the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist!\u201d Bucky hissed.</p><p>\u201cI got the last laugh when I had him arrested for theft, and then turned around and sold my invention for fifty thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDollars!\u201d Bucky barked.</p><p>Penny chuckled. \u201cYeah. Dollars.\u201d She leaned toward him and rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cAfter Aaron, I gave up on men. What was the point when they just kept taking things from me? The only one I could trust to have my back was Steve, and you were right about one thing. There\u2019s no one like him, and few people can live up to his standards. Now with what Marcus is probably doing, it looks like my luck with men is holding.\u201d</p><p>She gave a defeated sigh and Bucky wrapped his arm around her. \u201cI\u2019m real sorry, Pen. I should never have said what I did. It was mean, and I was jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t say it, not after what she\u2019d just told him. \u201cI was mad because\u2026 <i>fuck</i>! I was twenty-four, and so fucking attracted to you \u2014 my best friend\u2019s seventeen-year-old sister. You were so sweet and good and lovely. Looking at you helped me forget some of the less tenable parts of what Steve and I were being asked to do. The idea you\u2019d\u2026 been with someone else, I was hurt and jealous and said foolish things.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head to look at him, surprise in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2026 you wanted me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Pen. I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI so badly wanted you to kiss me on my birthday,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThen when you did after what happened\u2026 all I could think was, \u201cIf you knew what had just happened, you\u2019d be so disgusted by me.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know what he\u2019d done, and your mouth was on mine. Then you said what you did, and it was everything I felt about myself at that moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby girl,\u201d Bucky gently cupped her chin in his hand. \u201cI could never be disgusted with you. Nothing that happened was your fault. You know that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew better than to take that drink,\u201d she whispered, her eyes haunted.</p><p>\u201cHe chose to drug you. He\u2019s the one who-\u201d Bucky swallowed the bile in his throat, \u201craped you. None of that is on you, Pen.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and closed her eyes. \u201cI know that, but I still feel\u2026 dirty. It\u2019s been years, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m cursed to be disappointed in men. Steve\u2019s so\u2026 good. It\u2019s like he\u2019s all the good I\u2019m allowed to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Pen. You can\u2019t think like that!\u201d he insisted, pulling her closer until they were hip to hip, her hand linked with his, the other curled against his chest. \u201cThere are good guys out there besides Steve.\u201d He shifted his metal hand to the back of her neck and drew her up out of her hunched position. \u201cThere are other guys you can trust to have your back. Like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she whispered, her hand gliding up to rest against his neck; her thumb skimmed the edge of his jaw, back and forth over his stubble.</p><p>\u201cPenny, baby girl,\u201d he swallowed thickly. \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering everything I just told you?\u201d She gave a wry smile. \u201cYeah, Bucky. Anything.\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted down to her lips, plump and pink and parted before lifting to lock with her eyes. The ocean blue was mesmerizing, deep and dark and mysterious like the sea itself. \u201cI wanted to kiss you on your birthday, too.\u201d</p><p>Her breath shuddered out, and her gaze dropped to his lips. \u201cI wish you had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have done it so differently,\u201d he murmured, her thumb continuing to gently stroke his jaw.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSofter, gentler. Sweet like you.\u201d</p><p>Her hand skimmed slowly forward until her thumb rubbed over his lower lip. \u201cYou were my first.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and let his forehead rest against hers. \u201cDamn, Pen. Now I really feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2026 um\u2026\u201d She cleared her throat and looked away. \u201cMaybe we could have a do-over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d he asked, his heart jumping to his throat.\u00a0</p><p>Her lashes lifted slowly to reveal the uncertainty but also the tentative hope in her eyes. \u201cIt would be nice to have one from someone who wanted to, and who didn\u2019t want to take something from me in return,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBaby, are you sure?\u201d</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, Bucky just say so.\u201d</p><p>Bucky tugged her back. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that, darlin\u2019. Not at all. You\u2019ve just told me some pretty emotional stuff. I don\u2019t want to take advantage here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d she said, slowly shaking her head. \u201cYou won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>He lightly stroked her spine. \u201cA do-over, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby girl, that was real sweet,\u201d he sighed, a smile twitching his lips. \u201cShould I show you how it should have been? Your first kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, James,\u201d she purred, carding her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s real nice.\u201d His hand tightened gently in Penny\u2019s hair and pulled to tilt her chin up. He took his time bringing their mouths together, watching desire swim in her ocean blues. Their noses brushed, bumped, and rubbed together as he teased her a little, his upper lip ever so lightly skimming hers until a quiet whimper left her. Only then did he take her lips, her sweet, soft lips in a tender kiss. The kind of kiss that lingered. The kind of first kiss she deserved. The kind that smouldered instead of burned.</p><p>Her lips parted on a gentle sigh. Bucky couldn\u2019t help but flick his tongue over the bottom one. Penny\u2019s arm went around his neck as he lifted her to his thigh. The taste of her was like candy, sweet and sinful when her tongue tangled with his. She moaned and he echoed it, deciding kissing her was a bad idea. Penny was addictive. He was never going to get enough.</p><p>Penny pulled slowly back, her lips clinging to his until the last possible second. Her quiet sigh was nearly his undoing, so he drew her down and kissed her again. It was just as soft and sweet, just as tender until she sank her teeth into his lower lip and nibbled.</p><p>\u201cPenny,\u201d Bucky groaned.</p><p>She smiled when she lifted her head and ran her fingers through his hair. \u201cThank you, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time, baby girl,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAny time.\u201d</p><p>She rested her head on his shoulder, and Bucky held her close. It was comfortable, and though he still felt terrible about how he\u2019d treated her and what she\u2019d gone through, he thought maybe they\u2019d found a place to start from again. If she could trust him, he would do his best to help her heal the worst of her wounds.</p><p>Bucky tucked his nose down in her hair and breathed in the scent of peaches and vanilla. The smell made him smile even as her trauma made his heart ache.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://tilltheendwilliwrite.tumblr.com/post/178919420478/the-bodyguard\">Next Chapter</a></i></b></p><p><b><i>To be added to the tag list, please send an Ask.</i></b></p>",

He\u2019d ignored her, and by the time they got to the parking garage beneath her apartment, Penny had been dozing off in the back seat.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>When Bucky had smirked at her standing in the open car door, Penny had just rolled her eyes and shooed him out of the way, deciding a bath was on the docket for tonight after dinner. She hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d saved the pasta from the night before, but he\u2019d muttered about waste not want not something she remembered his mother saying, and gone to heat them both plates while she\u2019d changed out of her work clothes.</p><p>Bucky\u2019s suit jacket hung on the back of one of the bar stools along with his shoulder harness. He hadn\u2019t bothered to change himself yet, though his sleeves were rolled to the elbows as he\u2019d been helping dry the dishes. When he answered the house phone, it was with a blunt, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Penny watched his face harden and pulled the plug on the sink. She\u2019d put on leggings and a tank top, adding thick socks and a warm wool cardigan she wrapped tighter around herself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck what he\u2019s insisting,\u201d Bucky growled. \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky?\u201d she murmured, stepping closer. He mouthed the words, <i>call your lawyer,</i> and caused her heart to kick erratically when she scrambled for her phone.</p><p>\u201cTell Detective McGilvery he can cool his heels in the lobby until Miss Rogers lawyer arrives and ride up with her.\u201d He hung up before the guard could respond and looked pointedly at Penny.</p><p>\u201cTamara? I\u2019m sorry to call you so late, but the Detective from earlier is in my lobby. Alright, I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d Penny hung up and placed her phone on the island before gripping her elbows. \u201cWhat do we tell him?\u201d</p><p>Bucky moved around the counter to stand before her and gently rub her upper arms. \u201cThe truth. You went down to get in your car. It blew up, and in the process of getting to your panic room to wait for Steve, the guard shot at you, and the men were already waiting when you got upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he asks about why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell the truth. You don\u2019t know why,\u201d Bucky said, drawing her in for a hug. \u201cI\u2019m right here, Pen. If he gets out of line, I\u2019ll kick his ass out of here.\u201d</p><p>She leaned into him, finding his warmth so comforting, and wrapped her arms around his waist. It was ridiculously easy to accept his help. It was even easier to rest her forehead against his throat and breathe his scent, something musky with a hint of citrus. Bucky\u2019s hand gently stroked her hair, his fingers tangling and carding, working through the loose curls she\u2019d released from her ponytail earlier.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s weird, but I liked having you around today,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cIt was\u2026 enlightening,\u201d Bucky chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re so damn smart, Pen. I can see why Steve brags so much.\u201d</p><p>Penny lifted her head and smirked up at him. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t pay attention?\u201d</p><p>Something flared to life in his eyes, and his hand closed in her hair. \u201cSome things stuck,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>His metal hand ever so gently cupped her cheek. His thumb swept over her lip and paused in the center. He tugged it down, rubbing a little. It made Penny\u2019s heart skip and the breath catch in her lungs. His gaze jumped from her lips to her eyes, and Penny could feel her cheeks warm at his look of appreciation.</p><p>\u201cYou sure grew up pretty, Pen,\u201d he said softly. \u201cOne gorgeous dame.\u201d</p><p><i>You sure grew up pretty</i>\u2026 The words sent a shiver of memory through her which seemed to echo in her head. Terror streaked down her spine, and she ripped herself away from Bucky, her hand flying to her mouth as bile rose up her throat when she almost lost the dinner she\u2019d just eaten.</p><p>\u201cPenny?\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice rose with concern. \u201cBaby what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she croaked. When he tried to touch her, she skittered out from under his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny.\u201d Bucky held his hands up and out, not touching her but not allowing her to move away from where he cornered her against the kitchen island. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. Tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s nothing. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPen,\u201d he murmured, sliding closer. \u201cIt does matter.\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d buried the memories of that time so deep she\u2019d thought she\u2019d gotten rid of them. Now, with a single simple utterance, they were pounding at her, wanting out, shaking the very foundations of everything she\u2019d done to make herself immune to them. \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t, Bucky. Don\u2019t make me do it,\u201d she whimpered, his face seeming to rise out of the dark in her mind.</p><p>Penny squeezed her eyes tightly closed, fighting with every ounce of her being to shut it out. To shut <i>him </i>out. Bucky\u2019s arms wrapped around her and Penny cried out, jerking against him when he wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Pen. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to. I swear. Just breathe, baby. You\u2019re gonna have a panic attack if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She went limp, unable to fight him and the memories at the same time. When Bucky lifted her up, she wrapped herself around him like a snake and held on until he deposited her on the dark grey sofa in the living room and dragged the white throw from the back to tuck around her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what the trigger had been, but he knew fear when he saw it. This wasn\u2019t from her recent trauma. This was old, deeply buried, and painful. A wound she hid that had festered. Once she was covered beneath the heavy blanket, Bucky gently collected her hands.</p><p>\u201cPenny.\u201d He didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, doll, I won\u2019t push,\u201d not yet anyway, \u201cbut have you talked to someone about this?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and looked away. \u201cIt was a long time ago. I thought I\u2019d gotten past it.\u201d</p><p>Shame filled her face. Embarrassment followed. Bucky prayed as he hadn\u2019t in years that what he suspected was wrong, but he\u2019d seen enough faces of abuse to recognize it. To find it on hers, on Penelope\u2019s, broke something inside him.</p><p>Nat\u2019s voice whispered in his mind. <i>You weren\u2019t the cause, but you made her choice easier.</i></p><p>\u201cMy God, Pen. My God,\u201d he whispered, horrified as moments from that night began to click together in his mind.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Please, James. Not now,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>He dropped his head to her thigh and breathed through his mouth until the shaking stopped. They were about to have unwelcome guests. Being this out of control could be dangerous.</p><p>The light touch of her hand in his hair nearly broke him all over again. \u201cI could really use a stiff drink, Buck,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He lifted his head to look at her. The sad smile shattered his heart. But then she cupped his cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Buck.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t, but she was trying to pull herself together, and he rose to stand on weak legs, and stumble his way to the brass and glass cart near the fireplace where he poured three fingers of scotch for her, and an entire tumbler for himself. He drank half of it before returning to her side.</p><p>She took the glass but gripped his hand before he could walk away. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause none of it was your fault,\u201d she sighed, appearing small and fragile.</p><p>He threw the rest of the scotch down his throat relishing the burn which dried the threatening tears but didn\u2019t let go of her hand. \u201cSteve doesn\u2019t know, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone?\u201d</p><p>She pressed the tumbler to her cheek. \u201cBecca.\u201d</p><p>He ground his teeth together and put the glass down before he broke it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look up but didn\u2019t release his hand either. That single point of contact was the only thing keeping him steady in his suddenly upside down world. He wanted to wrap his arms around her and hold her close. Comfort her like he should have all those years ago. Shame made him sick to his stomach for how he\u2019d treated her that night. It rolled in his gut.</p><p>He wanted to ask. It was worse not knowing the extent of how badly he\u2019d missed the signs. There he was, jealous, angry, thinking she\u2019d let someone paw at her, only to find out-</p><p>He slammed the brakes on that train of thought when the sound of the elevator starting its ascent dinged through the main floor of the apartment.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got this,\u201d she assured him, looking a little steadier than she had, though the erratic tripping of her heart concerned him.</p><p>\u201cTake deep breaths, Pen,\u201d he murmured, releasing her fingers to stride up the few steps from her sunken living area and cross the floor to wait arms crossed before the elevator.</p><p>No wonder she didn\u2019t date. She didn\u2019t trust men.</p><p>When Bucky caught a glimpse of himself in the polished doors, he thrust a hand through his hair and quickly rolled down his sleeves. He had his glove out and on, and a semblance of control returned to his face before the doors opened.</p><p>Detective McGilvrey was, according to his record, a good cop. But even good cops on paper could be bad guys. Bucky didn\u2019t trust his squeaky clean record.</p><p>When the second ding announced the arrival of the elevator, he slipped his right hand to the small of his back and gripped the Glock tucked there.</p><p>Tamara burst forth, paused, her eyes darting over him, before stepping around Bucky to head for the living room. It was clear she\u2019d come from some class as her hair was tied up, her clothes were leggings and a tank top over a colourful sports bra beneath a warm coat, and the sky-high heels from earlier were now running shoes.</p><p>\u201cMiss Smith,\u201d he nodded to Tamara.</p><p>\u201cSergeant Barnes,\u201d she said, her eyes sharp and face pinched. Evidently, her ride up in the elevator hadn\u2019t been a pleasant one with the detective for company.</p><p>\u201cMcGilvery,\u201d he growled at the man. \u201cMiss Rogers has had a long day. Make it quick and watch yourself our I\u2019ll be seeing you out of the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like, \u201cThe fast way,\u201d should be tacked onto that statement,\u201d he muttered, indicating the glass windows and balcony with a jerk of his chin.</p><p>A slow smile spread over Bucky\u2019s mouth when he stepped out of the way and motioned the man to proceed him, his right hand still gripping his gun. \u201cTake it whatever way you want.\u201d</p><p>McGilvery\u2019s shoes clicked on the floors, and Bucky smirked when the detective became aware his did not. The man\u2019s shoulders tightened and rose an inch before he forced them to relax, but Bucky could see the way the hair on the back of his neck stood up.</p><p>\u201cYou ex-military?\u201d McGilvery asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen is anyone ever <i>ex</i>-military?\u201d Bucky murmured.</p><p>\u201cMarines, two tours in Afghanistan. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid, Detective? You know who I am,\u201d Bucky chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I do. I\u2019m a fan. Never thought I\u2019d come face to face with James Barnes when I went to speak with Miss Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoping for Steve?\u201d Bucky asked.</p><p>\u201cMiss Romanoff actually.\u201d</p><p>Bucky snorted. \u201cThe Widow would eat you alive.\u201d</p><p>McGilvery shot him a look and a wry smile. \u201cWould you think less of me if that was what I was hoping for?\u201d</p><p>A chuckle escaped him. The guy was charismatic when he wanted to be; Bucky would give him that. It wasn\u2019t hard to see Penny\u2019s blonde head where she was propped in the corner of the couch in her wide open floor plan, and Bucky followed McGilvery into the living room where Tamara had taken a seat beside Penny. Bucky stopped at Penny\u2019s side and laid his hand gently on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMiss Rogers, thank you for seeing me. It\u2019s rather difficult to get past all your defences,\u201d McGilvery said, taking a seat across the coffee table from her.</p><p>\u201cNot difficult enough,\u201d Penny murmured, sipping from her cup.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve been through a trying time. I\u2019ll make this quick and painless,\u201d McGilvery said with a smile.</p><p>Penny shuddered beneath Bucky\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate you getting on with it then, Detective instead of repeating the words my assailant used to see if you can get a reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk your questions, Detective,\u201d Tamara said sharply.</p><p>\u201cNate, please ladies. No need for formalities. After all, it\u2019s not as if Miss Rogers had anything to do with her assault.\u201d He looked straight at Penny.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d Penny snapped.</p><p>\u201cJust what are you implying, Detective? That my client hired those people? For what purpose?\u201d Tamara demanded.</p><p>\u201cPeople have done stranger things for publicity, or to cover up something else. After all, you\u2019ve got that nasty company audit coming up. What better way to push it back then an attack on the owner.\u201d</p><p>Penny stiffened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>McGilvery smirked. \u201cCome now, Miss Rogers. Don\u2019t play innocent. Your capital gains and losses are off the charts. And with the rumours you\u2019ll be going public in the next year swirling, it was bound to happen that the IRS would be sticking their nose in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky, I need my phone,\u201d she breathed on a rush of air.</p><p>Though he didn\u2019t like leaving her, it wasn\u2019t far from the kitchen, and he could see all the players easily enough. When he returned with it, no one had moved or spoken. Penny took it from him, dialled a preset number, clicked the speaker button, and set it on the coffee table in front of her.</p><p>It rang five times before he picked it up. \u201cPenny, dear! How are you?\u201d From the sound of the background noise, the man was partying rather hard.</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Marcus!\u201d Penny snapped. \u201cAm I being audited?\u201d</p><p>Silence, then the background noise faded as a door clicked shut. \u201cLook, Penny\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, Marcus! Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d she exploded.</p><p>\u201cIt was your first day back!\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cMarcus, don\u2019t! From the sounds of it, this isn\u2019t something you <i>just </i>found out about! Why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Penny. I\u2019ve got it under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d she snarled and hung up, an unholy fire blazing in her eyes. \u201cAs you can see, Detective, I have only just been made aware of this. And as my brother has already stated, the attack on me had to do with getting back at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith an inside twist,\u201d McGilvery said. \u201cAfter all, your building has more security than most in the city. They had to have help getting in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new higher security guard was the source of that, Detective, as you should also know,\u201d Tamara snapped. \u201cMy client had nothing to do with what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were they after, Penelope? What were they looking for in your office?\u201d McGilvery pressed, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Penny said, slamming her glass down on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cThis interview is over,\u201d Bucky stated coldly, motion for McGilvery to stand up.</p><p>\u201cThis had nothing to do with your brother, did it? We can\u2019t protect you if you don\u2019t coopera-\u201c</p><p>McGilvery never got to finish his sentence when Bucky wrapped his gloved hand around the man\u2019s throat, thumb and forefinger squeezing his jawbone hard enough to make it clear Bucky could and would break it to shut him up, and lifted the large man with minimal effort to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI said you\u2019re done. Time to go.\u201d He jerked the detective around and gave him a shove which sent him stumbling toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI could have you arrested for assaulting an officer!\u201d McGilvery snarled.</p><p>\u201cYou could try,\u201d Bucky smiled darkly. \u201cBut then, I outrank you, <i>Detective</i>. So you go ahead. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d</p><p>McGilvery ground his teeth together and stormed for the elevator. When the doors opened, Bucky reached around and pounded the button for the lobby.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Nate stated as the doors began to close.</p><p>Bucky caught them before they could. \u201cYou just came into Penelope Rogers home and harassed her. Yeah, Detective, it is. And when I explain this fucking shit show to her brother and just how upset she was by it, boy, you\u2019ll be lucky to keep your badge.\u201d Bucky let the doors go on McGilvery\u2019s pale face.</p><p>Penny was speaking quietly with Tamara when he returned. \u201cDid you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, I didn\u2019t. I swear. I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t contact legal as soon as the notice arrived.\u201d Tamara fidgeted with her shirt. \u201cMarcus has been\u2026 distant lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistant?\u201d Penny frowned. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhispered conversations. Late night texts. He disappears for hours and won\u2019t tell me where he\u2019s gone. Penny, I know I\u2019m not exactly an <i>attentive </i>girlfriend being busy with my firm, but I thought\u2026 we were happy. Now? I don\u2019t know,\u201d she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tam.\u201d Penny threw her arms around the woman. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I haven\u2019t exactly been the best friend these last few years, have I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all busy now, but I do miss Friday night drinks,\u201d Tamara sighed, hugging her back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to try harder,\u201d Penny announced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d Tamara laughed. \u201cUgh, but not tonight. I smell like spin class.\u201d</p><p>Penny\u2019s nose wrinkled. \u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Tamara smirked. \u201cKick a girl when she\u2019s down. And in front of hot bodyguard. Some friend you are.\u201d</p><p>A snort left Penny when she turned to look at Bucky, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. \u201cHe\u2019s not that hot. I\u2019ve seen better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour pretty boy brother doesn\u2019t count,\u201d Bucky groused, causing both women to laugh.</p><p>***</p><p>Later, after Tamara and Penny had spent another hour visiting and regaling Bucky with stories of their university adventures, he showed Tamara to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cSergeant?\u201d she said softly, her hand hovering over the button for the lobby. \u201cTake care of her. She acts tough, but she\u2019s more fragile than people know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stronger than you think, Miss Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven strong people can break under this kind of stress. She\u2019s terrible at needing people. I think she\u2019s going to need you, and not just for protection.\u201d</p><p>Tamara\u2019s dark eyes locked with his as the elevator doors closed. Something in them warned him to heed her request.</p><p>Bucky turned around to find the living room empty and sighed, wondering if Penny had gone to bed. He had questions. Lots of questions. Was he ever going to get answers? Then the light clicked on in her office, and he headed down the hall.</p><p>Penny was talking to her AI when he arrived in the doorway. \u201cFriday, you remember those numbers you said were funky in the last round of financials Marcus sent us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Penny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to take a closer look,\u201d she all but growled. \u201cFull scan. In-depth. Dig deep, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Friday murmured.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d Bucky asked, striding into the room.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d she said, glancing his way.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t sleep tonight,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be sleeping anyway.\u201d She stood to her full height, the look on her face the bone-chilling one of the Ice Queen. \u201cThe only reason I can think of for him not telling me about this when it happened? Marcus has been cooking my books. My books! Dammit!\u201d She brought her fist down on the desk hard enough it had to hurt.</p><p>\u201cPen, if he has you\u2019ll find it,\u201d he said, striding forward to collect her hands before she could do herself further damage.</p><p>\u201cWhy, though?\u201d she asked, suddenly sounding lost and confused along with angry. \u201cHe\u2019s paid better than anyone else on staff. The man makes seven figures a year! There\u2019s no reason to steal from me. And these rumours about going public? That\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve heard it today! What the hell is going on in my company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d Bucky murmured, releasing her hands to frame her face. The hurt in her eyes gutted him. \u201cPeople steal for any number of reasons, but if he was embezzling from your company, and he thought killing you would give him control and get the government off his back, allowing him the time to take the company public and replace the funds he\u2019d stolen\u2026 Penny, that\u2019s motive.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled sharply.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he murmured, gently massaging the tight muscles of her neck. \u201cYou run the numbers. I\u2019m going to work a deep dive into Marcus\u2019s background. I already skimmed the surface today, but I\u2019ll look deeper and see what I can find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She closed her eyes and exhaled hard. Her shoulders slumped right before her forehead landed on his chest. \u201cI hate all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Pen. I know,\u201d Bucky murmured, hugging her carefully. \u201cI\u2019ll make the coffee.\u201d He patted her back and headed for the kitchen.</p><p>***</p><p>Hours later, Bucky had a sick feeling in his stomach when he set his tablet down and looked at Penny dozing off at her desk. He had more questions then he did answers, but one thing had become glaringly apparent.</p><p>Taft had ties to Hydra.</p><p>Penny\u2019s eyes closed and stayed that way. Her breathing deepened, and Bucky stood slowly to his feet. He may have made the coffee, but he hadn\u2019t promised to make it caffeinated. He preferred tea anyway. Too many cups of coffee and he was jittering, on edge, and surly. Tea had a much more soothing effect and didn\u2019t make him jumpy.</p><p>\u201cFriday,\u201d he murmured, still watching Penny.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sergeant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still compiling the data,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment before a sound like a sigh registered. \u201cI have looked at the last five years of financials from Mr. Taft. All five years show discrepancies. The information Penny has been given does not correlate with what has been coming in and going out from the different departments. I have also found two departments which do not exist. One has money being syphoned into it. The other has money going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying someone is washing their money through Penny\u2019s company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears so,\u201d Friday murmured. \u201cBut the money going out is higher than what is coming in. So far, thirty million is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Bucky hissed.</p><p>\u201cAnd I am not yet finished. Penny has had this company for ten years. If Taft has been doing this since the beginning, it will be higher.\u201d</p><p>Bucky scrubbed his hand over his face. \u201cFuck. Can you follow the money? See where it is going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have. It is routed many times into offshore accounts, and while I am talented, I am not Jarvis. I do not have the ability to slip past their firewalls to see where it has gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying Stark\u2019s AI could get us all the way to the end point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is highly probable,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>He pulled his phone from his pocket and made the call, unsurprised when Stark answered the phone at three in the morning.</p><p>\u201cTinman, what do you want? It better not be that arm. It was perfect when you left.\u201d</p><p>Bucky snorted at that after what Penny had to say about it earlier. \u201cHardly, Stark. I need your AI.\u201d</p><p>Tony remained silent for a moment before muttering, \u201cHe\u2019s already in the vehicle. What more could you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday says Jarvis can do what she can\u2019t. I need your AI to follow the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, money. And before you ask, no, I won\u2019t tell you what money. Let\u2019s just say it has to do with Penny and why she was attacked. Can I borrow him or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarnes, Jarvis isn\u2019t I toy I can lend you, you can hand back when you\u2019re done. Once he\u2019s in the system, he\u2019s in. You can\u2019t limit what he does and what he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday?\u201d Bucky murmured. \u201cThoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps\u2026 Jarvis could teach me what I need to know to be of better assistance to Penny? I would appreciate the company,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Friday?\u201d Stark asked.</p><p>\u201cPenny\u2019s Jarvis,\u201d Bucky muttered. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll email you a link. Open it and set your phone on Penelope\u2019s desk.\u201d</p><p>Stark hung up, and a second later Bucky\u2019s phone chimed with the email. \u201cYou sure about this, Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I need the assistance,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Bucky took a deep breath, shot a glance at Penny, and blew it out. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna skin me, I just know it.\u201d Still, he tapped the link and laid his phone on her desk before moving to her side and lifting her from her chair.</p><p>She mumbled something unintelligible and curled into him trustingly. Bucky\u2019s heart lurched. Her trust after what he\u2019d learned today was humbling, and while he wanted answers, tonight wasn\u2019t the time to ask for them. But he vowed to be more careful with her.</p><p>Striding from the room, Bucky took her up the stairs two at a time. She was too light to his mind, and even at rest, he could hear the strange fluttering of her heart. It didn\u2019t beat as it should but skipped and jumped around. The sound was odd, but he pushed aside for later contemplation.</p><p>He took her to her bed and laid her down, gently removing her sweater and socks before covering her with the throw from the foot of her bed. It was a moment of deja vu, but this time he sat on the edge of it and brushed her hair from her cheek. Her face was soft in sleep; her long lashes pillowed on her cheeks. She was beautiful no matter how he looked at her, but now she looked fragile and so very innocent.</p><p>Guilt soured his stomach again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pen,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSorry for not seeing it then. So damn sorry for how I acted. I was a stupid, jealous idiot. I thought\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter what I thought. I should never have done what I did when you were upset.\u201d</p><p>She surprised him when she rolled over and looked at him, her blue eyes dark with memories. \u201cI had such a crush on you.\u201d</p><p>Bucky looked away, more guilt weighing on him. \u201cI was immature and stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to hate you. I did for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me what happened?\u201d he asked, his voice breaking.</p><p>This time she looked away. Then she sat up, pulled her knees to her chest, and set her chin on them. \u201cBecca and I went to that party. I was feeling pretty good what with being newly seventeen and having finally caught the notice of James Barnes. I think I was living on a virtual high with how giddy spending time with you made me feel,\u201d she smirked a little, then sighed. \u201cMarcy\u2019s parents were out of town, and by the time we got there, the party was huge. Becca was seeing Kevin at the time and ditched me as soon as she found him, but I was used to it. I love her, but the girl was boy crazy. I went and got a drink and hung out with some other friends, then\u2026\u201d she hesitated, her breath catching, \u201cthis guy came up and started talking to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know him?\u201d Bucky asked, wondering if she went to school with them.</p><p>Penny shook her head. \u201cHe was older than me. Some friend of a friend\u2019s brother or something.\u201d She closed her eyes and set her cheek on her knee; her face turned toward him. \u201cHe offered to get me a drink.\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped into his stomach. \u201cPen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stupid thing is, I knew better, but I thought that could never happen to me. I kept thinking that right up until I came to with him on top of me.\u201d Tears filled her voice, hoarse and torn enough to make Bucky\u2019s ache in sympathy. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him, but he knew me. He said, \u201cI sure grew up pretty,\u201d and thanked me for the fuck. I was so horrified and disgusted both with him and myself I threw up over the side of the bed. It freaked him out, and he got off of me, threw out the condom he\u2019d used, got dressed and left. For a moment, all I could think was, \u201cThank God he used protection.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny.\u201d Hearing it was like being stabbed with a knife to the heart over and over.</p><p>\u201cI tore my shirt getting dressed I was in such a hurry to get the hell out of there, but I could taste him in my mouth.\u201d She gave a silent gasp, tears escaping past her closed lids. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what he did. I hurt\u2026 everywhere, but he\u2019d been in my mouth\u2026\u201d</p><p>Bucky wanted to reach out and hold her but was afraid to touch her until she groped for his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo I stopped in the kitchen and grabbed a can of beer, but I was shaking so hard I spilled it on myself. I drank half of it before I couldn\u2019t taste him anymore and then left, running home to hide in the treehouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere I showed up and\u2026\u201d Bucky couldn\u2019t finish. \u201cGod, Pen.\u201d The tears he\u2019d been fighting spilled down his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m the biggest jerk.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know. I was too numb and too sick and embarrassed and horrified to be able to express myself. I could hardly admit it to myself, let alone tell you. God!\u201d She gave a choked laugh. \u201cI was terrified to tell anyone. So scared you\u2019d be as disgusted with me as I was with myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Penny! Of course not! Fuck, if Steve and I had known, we would have hunted that fucker down and-\u201d He cut himself off from finishing with <i>castrated him.</i></p><p>\u201cMade him eat his own balls?\u201d she murmured, her ocean eyes peering out at him from behind her wet lashes.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that, yeah,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou know not every man is like that.\u201d</p><p>She gave a tired sigh. \u201cI know that in theory, but then I met Aaron in Uni.\u201d</p><p>His blood froze. Not twice. If she said it happened twice, he was going to lose his mind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d she murmured, evidently seeing the panic on his face. \u201cWe dated, but I couldn\u2019t\u2026 when things would get physical, I got\u2026\u201d Red filled her cheeks as she turned her face away. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember what happened thanks to the drugs, but I just\u2026 just couldn\u2019t. And he was okay with it. He didn\u2019t push me for sex. I was so thankful until I realized he was using me. He stole one of my very first designs and tried to pass it off as his own. Thankfully I had the documents and things to back up my claim, but when I confronted him about it and asked him if anything about our relationship was real,\u201d she pressed her forehead to her knees, \u201che laughed,\u201d Penny whispered. \u201cLaughed and called me frigid. He and his buddies had quite the chuckle over the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist!\u201d Bucky hissed.</p><p>\u201cI got the last laugh when I had him arrested for theft, and then turned around and sold my invention for fifty thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDollars!\u201d Bucky barked.</p><p>Penny chuckled. \u201cYeah. Dollars.\u201d She leaned toward him and rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cAfter Aaron, I gave up on men. What was the point when they just kept taking things from me? The only one I could trust to have my back was Steve, and you were right about one thing. There\u2019s no one like him, and few people can live up to his standards. Now with what Marcus is probably doing, it looks like my luck with men is holding.\u201d</p><p>She gave a defeated sigh and Bucky wrapped his arm around her. \u201cI\u2019m real sorry, Pen. I should never have said what I did. It was mean, and I was jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t say it, not after what she\u2019d just told him. \u201cI was mad because\u2026 <i>fuck</i>! I was twenty-four, and so fucking attracted to you \u2014 my best friend\u2019s seventeen-year-old sister. You were so sweet and good and lovely. Looking at you helped me forget some of the less tenable parts of what Steve and I were being asked to do. The idea you\u2019d\u2026 been with someone else, I was hurt and jealous and said foolish things.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head to look at him, surprise in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2026 you wanted me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Pen. I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI so badly wanted you to kiss me on my birthday,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThen when you did after what happened\u2026 all I could think was, \u201cIf you knew what had just happened, you\u2019d be so disgusted by me.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know what he\u2019d done, and your mouth was on mine. Then you said what you did, and it was everything I felt about myself at that moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby girl,\u201d Bucky gently cupped her chin in his hand. \u201cI could never be disgusted with you. Nothing that happened was your fault. You know that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew better than to take that drink,\u201d she whispered, her eyes haunted.</p><p>\u201cHe chose to drug you. He\u2019s the one who-\u201d Bucky swallowed the bile in his throat, \u201craped you. None of that is on you, Pen.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and closed her eyes. \u201cI know that, but I still feel\u2026 dirty. It\u2019s been years, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m cursed to be disappointed in men. Steve\u2019s so\u2026 good. It\u2019s like he\u2019s all the good I\u2019m allowed to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Pen. You can\u2019t think like that!\u201d he insisted, pulling her closer until they were hip to hip, her hand linked with his, the other curled against his chest. \u201cThere are good guys out there besides Steve.\u201d He shifted his metal hand to the back of her neck and drew her up out of her hunched position. \u201cThere are other guys you can trust to have your back. Like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she whispered, her hand gliding up to rest against his neck; her thumb skimmed the edge of his jaw, back and forth over his stubble.</p><p>\u201cPenny, baby girl,\u201d he swallowed thickly. \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering everything I just told you?\u201d She gave a wry smile. \u201cYeah, Bucky. Anything.\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted down to her lips, plump and pink and parted before lifting to lock with her eyes. The ocean blue was mesmerizing, deep and dark and mysterious like the sea itself. \u201cI wanted to kiss you on your birthday, too.\u201d</p><p>Her breath shuddered out, and her gaze dropped to his lips. \u201cI wish you had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have done it so differently,\u201d he murmured, her thumb continuing to gently stroke his jaw.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSofter, gentler. Sweet like you.\u201d</p><p>Her hand skimmed slowly forward until her thumb rubbed over his lower lip. \u201cYou were my first.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and let his forehead rest against hers. \u201cDamn, Pen. Now I really feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2026 um\u2026\u201d She cleared her throat and looked away. \u201cMaybe we could have a do-over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d he asked, his heart jumping to his throat.\u00a0</p><p>Her lashes lifted slowly to reveal the uncertainty but also the tentative hope in her eyes. \u201cIt would be nice to have one from someone who wanted to, and who didn\u2019t want to take something from me in return,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBaby, are you sure?\u201d</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, Bucky just say so.\u201d</p><p>Bucky tugged her back. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that, darlin\u2019. Not at all. You\u2019ve just told me some pretty emotional stuff. I don\u2019t want to take advantage here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d she said, slowly shaking her head. \u201cYou won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>He lightly stroked her spine. \u201cA do-over, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby girl, that was real sweet,\u201d he sighed, a smile twitching his lips. \u201cShould I show you how it should have been? Your first kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, James,\u201d she purred, carding her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s real nice.\u201d His hand tightened gently in Penny\u2019s hair and pulled to tilt her chin up. He took his time bringing their mouths together, watching desire swim in her ocean blues. Their noses brushed, bumped, and rubbed together as he teased her a little, his upper lip ever so lightly skimming hers until a quiet whimper left her. Only then did he take her lips, her sweet, soft lips in a tender kiss. The kind of kiss that lingered. The kind of first kiss she deserved. The kind that smouldered instead of burned.</p><p>Her lips parted on a gentle sigh. Bucky couldn\u2019t help but flick his tongue over the bottom one. Penny\u2019s arm went around his neck as he lifted her to his thigh. The taste of her was like candy, sweet and sinful when her tongue tangled with his. She moaned and he echoed it, deciding kissing her was a bad idea. Penny was addictive. He was never going to get enough.</p><p>Penny pulled slowly back, her lips clinging to his until the last possible second. Her quiet sigh was nearly his undoing, so he drew her down and kissed her again. It was just as soft and sweet, just as tender until she sank her teeth into his lower lip and nibbled.</p><p>\u201cPenny,\u201d Bucky groaned.</p><p>She smiled when she lifted her head and ran her fingers through his hair. \u201cThank you, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time, baby girl,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAny time.\u201d</p><p>She rested her head on his shoulder, and Bucky held her close. It was comfortable, and though he still felt terrible about how he\u2019d treated her and what she\u2019d gone through, he thought maybe they\u2019d found a place to start from again. If she could trust him, he would do his best to help her heal the worst of her wounds.</p><p>Bucky tucked his nose down in her hair and breathed in the scent of peaches and vanilla. The smell made him smile even as her trauma made his heart ache.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://tilltheendwilliwrite.tumblr.com/post/178919420478/the-bodyguard\">Next Chapter</a></i></b></p><p><b><i>To be added to the tag list, please send an Ask.</i></b></p></p>",

She exchanged a look with Bucky, knowing it would be security announcing a visitor. If it were Steve, he would just come up, and no one else was scheduled to visit.</p><p>At least tonight she\u2019d gotten the chance to eat the spaghetti before being interrupted. They\u2019d managed to have an enjoyable dinner in which they\u2019d discussed a few of her projects in greater detail without snapping, snarling, or yelling at each other.</p><p>She was pleasantly full. In fact, she\u2019d eaten more today than she usually did in three days. Barnes was obsessed with stuffing food in her face and with cutting back her caffeine intake. She\u2019d reached for her fifth cup of coffee when they\u2019d returned from the lab, only to be handed a cup of tea instead. As she\u2019d been on the phone with the Head of Oncology at Johns Hopkins, she hadn\u2019t the ability to bitch Barnes out, ending up drinking the surprisingly tasty tea.</p><p>By six he\u2019d been dragging her to her feet, refusing to let her stay longer her first day back, and hustled her out the door, down the elevator, and into the car even as she protested she still had work to do. He\u2019d ignored her, and by the time they got to the parking garage beneath her apartment, Penny had been dozing off in the back seat.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>When Bucky had smirked at her standing in the open car door, Penny had just rolled her eyes and shooed him out of the way, deciding a bath was on the docket for tonight after dinner. She hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d saved the pasta from the night before, but he\u2019d muttered about waste not want not something she remembered his mother saying, and gone to heat them both plates while she\u2019d changed out of her work clothes.</p><p>Bucky\u2019s suit jacket hung on the back of one of the bar stools along with his shoulder harness. He hadn\u2019t bothered to change himself yet, though his sleeves were rolled to the elbows as he\u2019d been helping dry the dishes. When he answered the house phone, it was with a blunt, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Penny watched his face harden and pulled the plug on the sink. She\u2019d put on leggings and a tank top, adding thick socks and a warm wool cardigan she wrapped tighter around herself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck what he\u2019s insisting,\u201d Bucky growled. \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky?\u201d she murmured, stepping closer. He mouthed the words, <i>call your lawyer,</i> and caused her heart to kick erratically when she scrambled for her phone.</p><p>\u201cTell Detective McGilvery he can cool his heels in the lobby until Miss Rogers lawyer arrives and ride up with her.\u201d He hung up before the guard could respond and looked pointedly at Penny.</p><p>\u201cTamara? I\u2019m sorry to call you so late, but the Detective from earlier is in my lobby. Alright, I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d Penny hung up and placed her phone on the island before gripping her elbows. \u201cWhat do we tell him?\u201d</p><p>Bucky moved around the counter to stand before her and gently rub her upper arms. \u201cThe truth. You went down to get in your car. It blew up, and in the process of getting to your panic room to wait for Steve, the guard shot at you, and the men were already waiting when you got upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he asks about why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell the truth. You don\u2019t know why,\u201d Bucky said, drawing her in for a hug. \u201cI\u2019m right here, Pen. If he gets out of line, I\u2019ll kick his ass out of here.\u201d</p><p>She leaned into him, finding his warmth so comforting, and wrapped her arms around his waist. It was ridiculously easy to accept his help. It was even easier to rest her forehead against his throat and breathe his scent, something musky with a hint of citrus. Bucky\u2019s hand gently stroked her hair, his fingers tangling and carding, working through the loose curls she\u2019d released from her ponytail earlier.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s weird, but I liked having you around today,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cIt was\u2026 enlightening,\u201d Bucky chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re so damn smart, Pen. I can see why Steve brags so much.\u201d</p><p>Penny lifted her head and smirked up at him. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t pay attention?\u201d</p><p>Something flared to life in his eyes, and his hand closed in her hair. \u201cSome things stuck,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>His metal hand ever so gently cupped her cheek. His thumb swept over her lip and paused in the center. He tugged it down, rubbing a little. It made Penny\u2019s heart skip and the breath catch in her lungs. His gaze jumped from her lips to her eyes, and Penny could feel her cheeks warm at his look of appreciation.</p><p>\u201cYou sure grew up pretty, Pen,\u201d he said softly. \u201cOne gorgeous dame.\u201d</p><p><i>You sure grew up pretty</i>\u2026 The words sent a shiver of memory through her which seemed to echo in her head. Terror streaked down her spine, and she ripped herself away from Bucky, her hand flying to her mouth as bile rose up her throat when she almost lost the dinner she\u2019d just eaten.</p><p>\u201cPenny?\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice rose with concern. \u201cBaby what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she croaked. When he tried to touch her, she skittered out from under his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny.\u201d Bucky held his hands up and out, not touching her but not allowing her to move away from where he cornered her against the kitchen island. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. Tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s nothing. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPen,\u201d he murmured, sliding closer. \u201cIt does matter.\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d buried the memories of that time so deep she\u2019d thought she\u2019d gotten rid of them. Now, with a single simple utterance, they were pounding at her, wanting out, shaking the very foundations of everything she\u2019d done to make herself immune to them. \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t, Bucky. Don\u2019t make me do it,\u201d she whimpered, his face seeming to rise out of the dark in her mind.</p><p>Penny squeezed her eyes tightly closed, fighting with every ounce of her being to shut it out. To shut <i>him </i>out. Bucky\u2019s arms wrapped around her and Penny cried out, jerking against him when he wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Pen. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to. I swear. Just breathe, baby. You\u2019re gonna have a panic attack if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She went limp, unable to fight him and the memories at the same time. When Bucky lifted her up, she wrapped herself around him like a snake and held on until he deposited her on the dark grey sofa in the living room and dragged the white throw from the back to tuck around her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what the trigger had been, but he knew fear when he saw it. This wasn\u2019t from her recent trauma. This was old, deeply buried, and painful. A wound she hid that had festered. Once she was covered beneath the heavy blanket, Bucky gently collected her hands.</p><p>\u201cPenny.\u201d He didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, doll, I won\u2019t push,\u201d not yet anyway, \u201cbut have you talked to someone about this?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and looked away. \u201cIt was a long time ago. I thought I\u2019d gotten past it.\u201d</p><p>Shame filled her face. Embarrassment followed. Bucky prayed as he hadn\u2019t in years that what he suspected was wrong, but he\u2019d seen enough faces of abuse to recognize it. To find it on hers, on Penelope\u2019s, broke something inside him.</p><p>Nat\u2019s voice whispered in his mind. <i>You weren\u2019t the cause, but you made her choice easier.</i></p><p>\u201cMy God, Pen. My God,\u201d he whispered, horrified as moments from that night began to click together in his mind.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Please, James. Not now,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>He dropped his head to her thigh and breathed through his mouth until the shaking stopped. They were about to have unwelcome guests. Being this out of control could be dangerous.</p><p>The light touch of her hand in his hair nearly broke him all over again. \u201cI could really use a stiff drink, Buck,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He lifted his head to look at her. The sad smile shattered his heart. But then she cupped his cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Buck.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t, but she was trying to pull herself together, and he rose to stand on weak legs, and stumble his way to the brass and glass cart near the fireplace where he poured three fingers of scotch for her, and an entire tumbler for himself. He drank half of it before returning to her side.</p><p>She took the glass but gripped his hand before he could walk away. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause none of it was your fault,\u201d she sighed, appearing small and fragile.</p><p>He threw the rest of the scotch down his throat relishing the burn which dried the threatening tears but didn\u2019t let go of her hand. \u201cSteve doesn\u2019t know, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone?\u201d</p><p>She pressed the tumbler to her cheek. \u201cBecca.\u201d</p><p>He ground his teeth together and put the glass down before he broke it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look up but didn\u2019t release his hand either. That single point of contact was the only thing keeping him steady in his suddenly upside down world. He wanted to wrap his arms around her and hold her close. Comfort her like he should have all those years ago. Shame made him sick to his stomach for how he\u2019d treated her that night. It rolled in his gut.</p><p>He wanted to ask. It was worse not knowing the extent of how badly he\u2019d missed the signs. There he was, jealous, angry, thinking she\u2019d let someone paw at her, only to find out-</p><p>He slammed the brakes on that train of thought when the sound of the elevator starting its ascent dinged through the main floor of the apartment.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got this,\u201d she assured him, looking a little steadier than she had, though the erratic tripping of her heart concerned him.</p><p>\u201cTake deep breaths, Pen,\u201d he murmured, releasing her fingers to stride up the few steps from her sunken living area and cross the floor to wait arms crossed before the elevator.</p><p>No wonder she didn\u2019t date. She didn\u2019t trust men.</p><p>When Bucky caught a glimpse of himself in the polished doors, he thrust a hand through his hair and quickly rolled down his sleeves. He had his glove out and on, and a semblance of control returned to his face before the doors opened.</p><p>Detective McGilvrey was, according to his record, a good cop. But even good cops on paper could be bad guys. Bucky didn\u2019t trust his squeaky clean record.</p><p>When the second ding announced the arrival of the elevator, he slipped his right hand to the small of his back and gripped the Glock tucked there.</p><p>Tamara burst forth, paused, her eyes darting over him, before stepping around Bucky to head for the living room. It was clear she\u2019d come from some class as her hair was tied up, her clothes were leggings and a tank top over a colourful sports bra beneath a warm coat, and the sky-high heels from earlier were now running shoes.</p><p>\u201cMiss Smith,\u201d he nodded to Tamara.</p><p>\u201cSergeant Barnes,\u201d she said, her eyes sharp and face pinched. Evidently, her ride up in the elevator hadn\u2019t been a pleasant one with the detective for company.</p><p>\u201cMcGilvery,\u201d he growled at the man. \u201cMiss Rogers has had a long day. Make it quick and watch yourself our I\u2019ll be seeing you out of the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like, \u201cThe fast way,\u201d should be tacked onto that statement,\u201d he muttered, indicating the glass windows and balcony with a jerk of his chin.</p><p>A slow smile spread over Bucky\u2019s mouth when he stepped out of the way and motioned the man to proceed him, his right hand still gripping his gun. \u201cTake it whatever way you want.\u201d</p><p>McGilvery\u2019s shoes clicked on the floors, and Bucky smirked when the detective became aware his did not. The man\u2019s shoulders tightened and rose an inch before he forced them to relax, but Bucky could see the way the hair on the back of his neck stood up.</p><p>\u201cYou ex-military?\u201d McGilvery asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen is anyone ever <i>ex</i>-military?\u201d Bucky murmured.</p><p>\u201cMarines, two tours in Afghanistan. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid, Detective? You know who I am,\u201d Bucky chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I do. I\u2019m a fan. Never thought I\u2019d come face to face with James Barnes when I went to speak with Miss Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoping for Steve?\u201d Bucky asked.</p><p>\u201cMiss Romanoff actually.\u201d</p><p>Bucky snorted. \u201cThe Widow would eat you alive.\u201d</p><p>McGilvery shot him a look and a wry smile. \u201cWould you think less of me if that was what I was hoping for?\u201d</p><p>A chuckle escaped him. The guy was charismatic when he wanted to be; Bucky would give him that. It wasn\u2019t hard to see Penny\u2019s blonde head where she was propped in the corner of the couch in her wide open floor plan, and Bucky followed McGilvery into the living room where Tamara had taken a seat beside Penny. Bucky stopped at Penny\u2019s side and laid his hand gently on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMiss Rogers, thank you for seeing me. It\u2019s rather difficult to get past all your defences,\u201d McGilvery said, taking a seat across the coffee table from her.</p><p>\u201cNot difficult enough,\u201d Penny murmured, sipping from her cup.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve been through a trying time. I\u2019ll make this quick and painless,\u201d McGilvery said with a smile.</p><p>Penny shuddered beneath Bucky\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate you getting on with it then, Detective instead of repeating the words my assailant used to see if you can get a reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk your questions, Detective,\u201d Tamara said sharply.</p><p>\u201cNate, please ladies. No need for formalities. After all, it\u2019s not as if Miss Rogers had anything to do with her assault.\u201d He looked straight at Penny.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d Penny snapped.</p><p>\u201cJust what are you implying, Detective? That my client hired those people? For what purpose?\u201d Tamara demanded.</p><p>\u201cPeople have done stranger things for publicity, or to cover up something else. After all, you\u2019ve got that nasty company audit coming up. What better way to push it back then an attack on the owner.\u201d</p><p>Penny stiffened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>McGilvery smirked. \u201cCome now, Miss Rogers. Don\u2019t play innocent. Your capital gains and losses are off the charts. And with the rumours you\u2019ll be going public in the next year swirling, it was bound to happen that the IRS would be sticking their nose in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky, I need my phone,\u201d she breathed on a rush of air.</p><p>Though he didn\u2019t like leaving her, it wasn\u2019t far from the kitchen, and he could see all the players easily enough. When he returned with it, no one had moved or spoken. Penny took it from him, dialled a preset number, clicked the speaker button, and set it on the coffee table in front of her.</p><p>It rang five times before he picked it up. \u201cPenny, dear! How are you?\u201d From the sound of the background noise, the man was partying rather hard.</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Marcus!\u201d Penny snapped. \u201cAm I being audited?\u201d</p><p>Silence, then the background noise faded as a door clicked shut. \u201cLook, Penny\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, Marcus! Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d she exploded.</p><p>\u201cIt was your first day back!\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cMarcus, don\u2019t! From the sounds of it, this isn\u2019t something you <i>just </i>found out about! Why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Penny. I\u2019ve got it under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d she snarled and hung up, an unholy fire blazing in her eyes. \u201cAs you can see, Detective, I have only just been made aware of this. And as my brother has already stated, the attack on me had to do with getting back at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith an inside twist,\u201d McGilvery said. \u201cAfter all, your building has more security than most in the city. They had to have help getting in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new higher security guard was the source of that, Detective, as you should also know,\u201d Tamara snapped. \u201cMy client had nothing to do with what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were they after, Penelope? What were they looking for in your office?\u201d McGilvery pressed, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Penny said, slamming her glass down on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cThis interview is over,\u201d Bucky stated coldly, motion for McGilvery to stand up.</p><p>\u201cThis had nothing to do with your brother, did it? We can\u2019t protect you if you don\u2019t coopera-\u201c</p><p>McGilvery never got to finish his sentence when Bucky wrapped his gloved hand around the man\u2019s throat, thumb and forefinger squeezing his jawbone hard enough to make it clear Bucky could and would break it to shut him up, and lifted the large man with minimal effort to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI said you\u2019re done. Time to go.\u201d He jerked the detective around and gave him a shove which sent him stumbling toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI could have you arrested for assaulting an officer!\u201d McGilvery snarled.</p><p>\u201cYou could try,\u201d Bucky smiled darkly. \u201cBut then, I outrank you, <i>Detective</i>. So you go ahead. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d</p><p>McGilvery ground his teeth together and stormed for the elevator. When the doors opened, Bucky reached around and pounded the button for the lobby.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Nate stated as the doors began to close.</p><p>Bucky caught them before they could. \u201cYou just came into Penelope Rogers home and harassed her. Yeah, Detective, it is. And when I explain this fucking shit show to her brother and just how upset she was by it, boy, you\u2019ll be lucky to keep your badge.\u201d Bucky let the doors go on McGilvery\u2019s pale face.</p><p>Penny was speaking quietly with Tamara when he returned. \u201cDid you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, I didn\u2019t. I swear. I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t contact legal as soon as the notice arrived.\u201d Tamara fidgeted with her shirt. \u201cMarcus has been\u2026 distant lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistant?\u201d Penny frowned. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhispered conversations. Late night texts. He disappears for hours and won\u2019t tell me where he\u2019s gone. Penny, I know I\u2019m not exactly an <i>attentive </i>girlfriend being busy with my firm, but I thought\u2026 we were happy. Now? I don\u2019t know,\u201d she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tam.\u201d Penny threw her arms around the woman. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I haven\u2019t exactly been the best friend these last few years, have I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all busy now, but I do miss Friday night drinks,\u201d Tamara sighed, hugging her back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to try harder,\u201d Penny announced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d Tamara laughed. \u201cUgh, but not tonight. I smell like spin class.\u201d</p><p>Penny\u2019s nose wrinkled. \u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Tamara smirked. \u201cKick a girl when she\u2019s down. And in front of hot bodyguard. Some friend you are.\u201d</p><p>A snort left Penny when she turned to look at Bucky, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. \u201cHe\u2019s not that hot. I\u2019ve seen better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour pretty boy brother doesn\u2019t count,\u201d Bucky groused, causing both women to laugh.</p><p>***</p><p>Later, after Tamara and Penny had spent another hour visiting and regaling Bucky with stories of their university adventures, he showed Tamara to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cSergeant?\u201d she said softly, her hand hovering over the button for the lobby. \u201cTake care of her. She acts tough, but she\u2019s more fragile than people know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stronger than you think, Miss Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven strong people can break under this kind of stress. She\u2019s terrible at needing people. I think she\u2019s going to need you, and not just for protection.\u201d</p><p>Tamara\u2019s dark eyes locked with his as the elevator doors closed. Something in them warned him to heed her request.</p><p>Bucky turned around to find the living room empty and sighed, wondering if Penny had gone to bed. He had questions. Lots of questions. Was he ever going to get answers? Then the light clicked on in her office, and he headed down the hall.</p><p>Penny was talking to her AI when he arrived in the doorway. \u201cFriday, you remember those numbers you said were funky in the last round of financials Marcus sent us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Penny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to take a closer look,\u201d she all but growled. \u201cFull scan. In-depth. Dig deep, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Friday murmured.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d Bucky asked, striding into the room.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d she said, glancing his way.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t sleep tonight,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be sleeping anyway.\u201d She stood to her full height, the look on her face the bone-chilling one of the Ice Queen. \u201cThe only reason I can think of for him not telling me about this when it happened? Marcus has been cooking my books. My books! Dammit!\u201d She brought her fist down on the desk hard enough it had to hurt.</p><p>\u201cPen, if he has you\u2019ll find it,\u201d he said, striding forward to collect her hands before she could do herself further damage.</p><p>\u201cWhy, though?\u201d she asked, suddenly sounding lost and confused along with angry. \u201cHe\u2019s paid better than anyone else on staff. The man makes seven figures a year! There\u2019s no reason to steal from me. And these rumours about going public? That\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve heard it today! What the hell is going on in my company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d Bucky murmured, releasing her hands to frame her face. The hurt in her eyes gutted him. \u201cPeople steal for any number of reasons, but if he was embezzling from your company, and he thought killing you would give him control and get the government off his back, allowing him the time to take the company public and replace the funds he\u2019d stolen\u2026 Penny, that\u2019s motive.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled sharply.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he murmured, gently massaging the tight muscles of her neck. \u201cYou run the numbers. I\u2019m going to work a deep dive into Marcus\u2019s background. I already skimmed the surface today, but I\u2019ll look deeper and see what I can find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She closed her eyes and exhaled hard. Her shoulders slumped right before her forehead landed on his chest. \u201cI hate all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Pen. I know,\u201d Bucky murmured, hugging her carefully. \u201cI\u2019ll make the coffee.\u201d He patted her back and headed for the kitchen.</p><p>***</p><p>Hours later, Bucky had a sick feeling in his stomach when he set his tablet down and looked at Penny dozing off at her desk. He had more questions then he did answers, but one thing had become glaringly apparent.</p><p>Taft had ties to Hydra.</p><p>Penny\u2019s eyes closed and stayed that way. Her breathing deepened, and Bucky stood slowly to his feet. He may have made the coffee, but he hadn\u2019t promised to make it caffeinated. He preferred tea anyway. Too many cups of coffee and he was jittering, on edge, and surly. Tea had a much more soothing effect and didn\u2019t make him jumpy.</p><p>\u201cFriday,\u201d he murmured, still watching Penny.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sergeant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still compiling the data,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment before a sound like a sigh registered. \u201cI have looked at the last five years of financials from Mr. Taft. All five years show discrepancies. The information Penny has been given does not correlate with what has been coming in and going out from the different departments. I have also found two departments which do not exist. One has money being syphoned into it. The other has money going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying someone is washing their money through Penny\u2019s company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears so,\u201d Friday murmured. \u201cBut the money going out is higher than what is coming in. So far, thirty million is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Bucky hissed.</p><p>\u201cAnd I am not yet finished. Penny has had this company for ten years. If Taft has been doing this since the beginning, it will be higher.\u201d</p><p>Bucky scrubbed his hand over his face. \u201cFuck. Can you follow the money? See where it is going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have. It is routed many times into offshore accounts, and while I am talented, I am not Jarvis. I do not have the ability to slip past their firewalls to see where it has gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying Stark\u2019s AI could get us all the way to the end point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is highly probable,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>He pulled his phone from his pocket and made the call, unsurprised when Stark answered the phone at three in the morning.</p><p>\u201cTinman, what do you want? It better not be that arm. It was perfect when you left.\u201d</p><p>Bucky snorted at that after what Penny had to say about it earlier. \u201cHardly, Stark. I need your AI.\u201d</p><p>Tony remained silent for a moment before muttering, \u201cHe\u2019s already in the vehicle. What more could you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday says Jarvis can do what she can\u2019t. I need your AI to follow the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, money. And before you ask, no, I won\u2019t tell you what money. Let\u2019s just say it has to do with Penny and why she was attacked. Can I borrow him or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarnes, Jarvis isn\u2019t I toy I can lend you, you can hand back when you\u2019re done. Once he\u2019s in the system, he\u2019s in. You can\u2019t limit what he does and what he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday?\u201d Bucky murmured. \u201cThoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps\u2026 Jarvis could teach me what I need to know to be of better assistance to Penny? I would appreciate the company,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Friday?\u201d Stark asked.</p><p>\u201cPenny\u2019s Jarvis,\u201d Bucky muttered. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll email you a link. Open it and set your phone on Penelope\u2019s desk.\u201d</p><p>Stark hung up, and a second later Bucky\u2019s phone chimed with the email. \u201cYou sure about this, Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I need the assistance,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Bucky took a deep breath, shot a glance at Penny, and blew it out. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna skin me, I just know it.\u201d Still, he tapped the link and laid his phone on her desk before moving to her side and lifting her from her chair.</p><p>She mumbled something unintelligible and curled into him trustingly. Bucky\u2019s heart lurched. Her trust after what he\u2019d learned today was humbling, and while he wanted answers, tonight wasn\u2019t the time to ask for them. But he vowed to be more careful with her.</p><p>Striding from the room, Bucky took her up the stairs two at a time. She was too light to his mind, and even at rest, he could hear the strange fluttering of her heart. It didn\u2019t beat as it should but skipped and jumped around. The sound was odd, but he pushed aside for later contemplation.</p><p>He took her to her bed and laid her down, gently removing her sweater and socks before covering her with the throw from the foot of her bed. It was a moment of deja vu, but this time he sat on the edge of it and brushed her hair from her cheek. Her face was soft in sleep; her long lashes pillowed on her cheeks. She was beautiful no matter how he looked at her, but now she looked fragile and so very innocent.</p><p>Guilt soured his stomach again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pen,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSorry for not seeing it then. So damn sorry for how I acted. I was a stupid, jealous idiot. I thought\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter what I thought. I should never have done what I did when you were upset.\u201d</p><p>She surprised him when she rolled over and looked at him, her blue eyes dark with memories. \u201cI had such a crush on you.\u201d</p><p>Bucky looked away, more guilt weighing on him. \u201cI was immature and stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to hate you. I did for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me what happened?\u201d he asked, his voice breaking.</p><p>This time she looked away. Then she sat up, pulled her knees to her chest, and set her chin on them. \u201cBecca and I went to that party. I was feeling pretty good what with being newly seventeen and having finally caught the notice of James Barnes. I think I was living on a virtual high with how giddy spending time with you made me feel,\u201d she smirked a little, then sighed. \u201cMarcy\u2019s parents were out of town, and by the time we got there, the party was huge. Becca was seeing Kevin at the time and ditched me as soon as she found him, but I was used to it. I love her, but the girl was boy crazy. I went and got a drink and hung out with some other friends, then\u2026\u201d she hesitated, her breath catching, \u201cthis guy came up and started talking to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know him?\u201d Bucky asked, wondering if she went to school with them.</p><p>Penny shook her head. \u201cHe was older than me. Some friend of a friend\u2019s brother or something.\u201d She closed her eyes and set her cheek on her knee; her face turned toward him. \u201cHe offered to get me a drink.\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped into his stomach. \u201cPen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stupid thing is, I knew better, but I thought that could never happen to me. I kept thinking that right up until I came to with him on top of me.\u201d Tears filled her voice, hoarse and torn enough to make Bucky\u2019s ache in sympathy. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him, but he knew me. He said, \u201cI sure grew up pretty,\u201d and thanked me for the fuck. I was so horrified and disgusted both with him and myself I threw up over the side of the bed. It freaked him out, and he got off of me, threw out the condom he\u2019d used, got dressed and left. For a moment, all I could think was, \u201cThank God he used protection.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny.\u201d Hearing it was like being stabbed with a knife to the heart over and over.</p><p>\u201cI tore my shirt getting dressed I was in such a hurry to get the hell out of there, but I could taste him in my mouth.\u201d She gave a silent gasp, tears escaping past her closed lids. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what he did. I hurt\u2026 everywhere, but he\u2019d been in my mouth\u2026\u201d</p><p>Bucky wanted to reach out and hold her but was afraid to touch her until she groped for his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo I stopped in the kitchen and grabbed a can of beer, but I was shaking so hard I spilled it on myself. I drank half of it before I couldn\u2019t taste him anymore and then left, running home to hide in the treehouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere I showed up and\u2026\u201d Bucky couldn\u2019t finish. \u201cGod, Pen.\u201d The tears he\u2019d been fighting spilled down his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m the biggest jerk.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know. I was too numb and too sick and embarrassed and horrified to be able to express myself. I could hardly admit it to myself, let alone tell you. God!\u201d She gave a choked laugh. \u201cI was terrified to tell anyone. So scared you\u2019d be as disgusted with me as I was with myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Penny! Of course not! Fuck, if Steve and I had known, we would have hunted that fucker down and-\u201d He cut himself off from finishing with <i>castrated him.</i></p><p>\u201cMade him eat his own balls?\u201d she murmured, her ocean eyes peering out at him from behind her wet lashes.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that, yeah,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou know not every man is like that.\u201d</p><p>She gave a tired sigh. \u201cI know that in theory, but then I met Aaron in Uni.\u201d</p><p>His blood froze. Not twice. If she said it happened twice, he was going to lose his mind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d she murmured, evidently seeing the panic on his face. \u201cWe dated, but I couldn\u2019t\u2026 when things would get physical, I got\u2026\u201d Red filled her cheeks as she turned her face away. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember what happened thanks to the drugs, but I just\u2026 just couldn\u2019t. And he was okay with it. He didn\u2019t push me for sex. I was so thankful until I realized he was using me. He stole one of my very first designs and tried to pass it off as his own. Thankfully I had the documents and things to back up my claim, but when I confronted him about it and asked him if anything about our relationship was real,\u201d she pressed her forehead to her knees, \u201che laughed,\u201d Penny whispered. \u201cLaughed and called me frigid. He and his buddies had quite the chuckle over the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist!\u201d Bucky hissed.</p><p>\u201cI got the last laugh when I had him arrested for theft, and then turned around and sold my invention for fifty thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDollars!\u201d Bucky barked.</p><p>Penny chuckled. \u201cYeah. Dollars.\u201d She leaned toward him and rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cAfter Aaron, I gave up on men. What was the point when they just kept taking things from me? The only one I could trust to have my back was Steve, and you were right about one thing. There\u2019s no one like him, and few people can live up to his standards. Now with what Marcus is probably doing, it looks like my luck with men is holding.\u201d</p><p>She gave a defeated sigh and Bucky wrapped his arm around her. \u201cI\u2019m real sorry, Pen. I should never have said what I did. It was mean, and I was jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t say it, not after what she\u2019d just told him. \u201cI was mad because\u2026 <i>fuck</i>! I was twenty-four, and so fucking attracted to you \u2014 my best friend\u2019s seventeen-year-old sister. You were so sweet and good and lovely. Looking at you helped me forget some of the less tenable parts of what Steve and I were being asked to do. The idea you\u2019d\u2026 been with someone else, I was hurt and jealous and said foolish things.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head to look at him, surprise in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2026 you wanted me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Pen. I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI so badly wanted you to kiss me on my birthday,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThen when you did after what happened\u2026 all I could think was, \u201cIf you knew what had just happened, you\u2019d be so disgusted by me.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know what he\u2019d done, and your mouth was on mine. Then you said what you did, and it was everything I felt about myself at that moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby girl,\u201d Bucky gently cupped her chin in his hand. \u201cI could never be disgusted with you. Nothing that happened was your fault. You know that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew better than to take that drink,\u201d she whispered, her eyes haunted.</p><p>\u201cHe chose to drug you. He\u2019s the one who-\u201d Bucky swallowed the bile in his throat, \u201craped you. None of that is on you, Pen.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and closed her eyes. \u201cI know that, but I still feel\u2026 dirty. It\u2019s been years, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m cursed to be disappointed in men. Steve\u2019s so\u2026 good. It\u2019s like he\u2019s all the good I\u2019m allowed to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Pen. You can\u2019t think like that!\u201d he insisted, pulling her closer until they were hip to hip, her hand linked with his, the other curled against his chest. \u201cThere are good guys out there besides Steve.\u201d He shifted his metal hand to the back of her neck and drew her up out of her hunched position. \u201cThere are other guys you can trust to have your back. Like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she whispered, her hand gliding up to rest against his neck; her thumb skimmed the edge of his jaw, back and forth over his stubble.</p><p>\u201cPenny, baby girl,\u201d he swallowed thickly. \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering everything I just told you?\u201d She gave a wry smile. \u201cYeah, Bucky. Anything.\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted down to her lips, plump and pink and parted before lifting to lock with her eyes. The ocean blue was mesmerizing, deep and dark and mysterious like the sea itself. \u201cI wanted to kiss you on your birthday, too.\u201d</p><p>Her breath shuddered out, and her gaze dropped to his lips. \u201cI wish you had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have done it so differently,\u201d he murmured, her thumb continuing to gently stroke his jaw.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSofter, gentler. Sweet like you.\u201d</p><p>Her hand skimmed slowly forward until her thumb rubbed over his lower lip. \u201cYou were my first.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and let his forehead rest against hers. \u201cDamn, Pen. Now I really feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2026 um\u2026\u201d She cleared her throat and looked away. \u201cMaybe we could have a do-over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d he asked, his heart jumping to his throat.\u00a0</p><p>Her lashes lifted slowly to reveal the uncertainty but also the tentative hope in her eyes. \u201cIt would be nice to have one from someone who wanted to, and who didn\u2019t want to take something from me in return,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBaby, are you sure?\u201d</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, Bucky just say so.\u201d</p><p>Bucky tugged her back. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that, darlin\u2019. Not at all. You\u2019ve just told me some pretty emotional stuff. I don\u2019t want to take advantage here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d she said, slowly shaking her head. \u201cYou won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>He lightly stroked her spine. \u201cA do-over, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby girl, that was real sweet,\u201d he sighed, a smile twitching his lips. \u201cShould I show you how it should have been? Your first kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, James,\u201d she purred, carding her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s real nice.\u201d His hand tightened gently in Penny\u2019s hair and pulled to tilt her chin up. He took his time bringing their mouths together, watching desire swim in her ocean blues. Their noses brushed, bumped, and rubbed together as he teased her a little, his upper lip ever so lightly skimming hers until a quiet whimper left her. Only then did he take her lips, her sweet, soft lips in a tender kiss. The kind of kiss that lingered. The kind of first kiss she deserved. The kind that smouldered instead of burned.</p><p>Her lips parted on a gentle sigh. Bucky couldn\u2019t help but flick his tongue over the bottom one. Penny\u2019s arm went around his neck as he lifted her to his thigh. The taste of her was like candy, sweet and sinful when her tongue tangled with his. She moaned and he echoed it, deciding kissing her was a bad idea. Penny was addictive. He was never going to get enough.</p><p>Penny pulled slowly back, her lips clinging to his until the last possible second. Her quiet sigh was nearly his undoing, so he drew her down and kissed her again. It was just as soft and sweet, just as tender until she sank her teeth into his lower lip and nibbled.</p><p>\u201cPenny,\u201d Bucky groaned.</p><p>She smiled when she lifted her head and ran her fingers through his hair. \u201cThank you, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time, baby girl,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAny time.\u201d</p><p>She rested her head on his shoulder, and Bucky held her close. It was comfortable, and though he still felt terrible about how he\u2019d treated her and what she\u2019d gone through, he thought maybe they\u2019d found a place to start from again. If she could trust him, he would do his best to help her heal the worst of her wounds.</p><p>Bucky tucked his nose down in her hair and breathed in the scent of peaches and vanilla. The smell made him smile even as her trauma made his heart ache.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://tilltheendwilliwrite.tumblr.com/post/178919420478/the-bodyguard\">Next Chapter</a></i></b></p><p><b><i>To be added to the tag list, please send an Ask.</i></b></p></p>",

She exchanged a look with Bucky, knowing it would be security announcing a visitor. If it were Steve, he would just come up, and no one else was scheduled to visit.</p><p>At least tonight she&rsquo;d gotten the chance to eat the spaghetti before being interrupted. They&rsquo;d managed to have an enjoyable dinner in which they&rsquo;d discussed a few of her projects in greater detail without snapping, snarling, or yelling at each other.</p><p>She was pleasantly full. In fact, she&rsquo;d eaten more today than she usually did in three days. Barnes was obsessed with stuffing food in her face and with cutting back her caffeine intake. She&rsquo;d reached for her fifth cup of coffee when they&rsquo;d returned from the lab, only to be handed a cup of tea instead. As she&rsquo;d been on the phone with the Head of Oncology at Johns Hopkins, she hadn&rsquo;t the ability to bitch Barnes out, ending up drinking the surprisingly tasty tea.</p><p>By six he&rsquo;d been dragging her to her feet, refusing to let her stay longer her first day back, and hustled her out the door, down the elevator, and into the car even as she protested she still had work to do. He&rsquo;d ignored her, and by the time they got to the parking garage beneath her apartment, Penny had been dozing off in the back seat.&nbsp;</p><p>When Bucky had smirked at her standing in the open car door, Penny had just rolled her eyes and shooed him out of the way, deciding a bath was on the docket for tonight after dinner. She hadn&rsquo;t realized he&rsquo;d saved the pasta from the night before, but he&rsquo;d muttered about waste not want not something she remembered his mother saying, and gone to heat them both plates while she&rsquo;d changed out of her work clothes.</p><p>Bucky&rsquo;s suit jacket hung on the back of one of the bar stools along with his shoulder harness. He hadn&rsquo;t bothered to change himself yet, though his sleeves were rolled to the elbows as he&rsquo;d been helping dry the dishes. When he answered the house phone, it was with a blunt, &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>Penny watched his face harden and pulled the plug on the sink. She&rsquo;d put on leggings and a tank top, adding thick socks and a warm wool cardigan she wrapped tighter around herself.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a flying fuck what he&rsquo;s insisting,&rdquo; Bucky growled. &ldquo;The answer is no.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky?&rdquo; she murmured, stepping closer. He mouthed the words, <i>call your lawyer,</i> and caused her heart to kick erratically when she scrambled for her phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell Detective McGilvery he can cool his heels in the lobby until Miss Rogers lawyer arrives and ride up with her.&rdquo; He hung up before the guard could respond and looked pointedly at Penny.</p><p>&ldquo;Tamara? I&rsquo;m sorry to call you so late, but the Detective from earlier is in my lobby. Alright, I&rsquo;ll see you soon.&rdquo; Penny hung up and placed her phone on the island before gripping her elbows. &ldquo;What do we tell him?&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky moved around the counter to stand before her and gently rub her upper arms. &ldquo;The truth. You went down to get in your car. It blew up, and in the process of getting to your panic room to wait for Steve, the guard shot at you, and the men were already waiting when you got upstairs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And if he asks about why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You tell the truth. You don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; Bucky said, drawing her in for a hug. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here, Pen. If he gets out of line, I&rsquo;ll kick his ass out of here.&rdquo;</p><p>She leaned into him, finding his warmth so comforting, and wrapped her arms around his waist. It was ridiculously easy to accept his help. It was even easier to rest her forehead against his throat and breathe his scent, something musky with a hint of citrus. Bucky&rsquo;s hand gently stroked her hair, his fingers tangling and carding, working through the loose curls she&rsquo;d released from her ponytail earlier.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s weird, but I liked having you around today,&rdquo; she admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;It was&hellip; enlightening,&rdquo; Bucky chuckled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so damn smart, Pen. I can see why Steve brags so much.&rdquo;</p><p>Penny lifted her head and smirked up at him. &ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t pay attention?&rdquo;</p><p>Something flared to life in his eyes, and his hand closed in her hair. &ldquo;Some things stuck,&rdquo; he murmured.</p><p>His metal hand ever so gently cupped her cheek. His thumb swept over her lip and paused in the center. He tugged it down, rubbing a little. It made Penny&rsquo;s heart skip and the breath catch in her lungs. His gaze jumped from her lips to her eyes, and Penny could feel her cheeks warm at his look of appreciation.</p><p>&ldquo;You sure grew up pretty, Pen,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;One gorgeous dame.&rdquo;</p><p><i>You sure grew up pretty</i>&hellip; The words sent a shiver of memory through her which seemed to echo in her head. Terror streaked down her spine, and she ripped herself away from Bucky, her hand flying to her mouth as bile rose up her throat when she almost lost the dinner she&rsquo;d just eaten.</p><p>&ldquo;Penny?&rdquo; Bucky&rsquo;s voice rose with concern. &ldquo;Baby what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she croaked. When he tried to touch her, she skittered out from under his hands. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Penny.&rdquo; Bucky held his hands up and out, not touching her but not allowing her to move away from where he cornered her against the kitchen island. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you. Tell me what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s nothing. It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pen,&rdquo; he murmured, sliding closer. &ldquo;It does matter.&rdquo;</p><p>It couldn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;d buried the memories of that time so deep she&rsquo;d thought she&rsquo;d gotten rid of them. Now, with a single simple utterance, they were pounding at her, wanting out, shaking the very foundations of everything she&rsquo;d done to make herself immune to them. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t, Bucky. Don&rsquo;t make me do it,&rdquo; she whimpered, his face seeming to rise out of the dark in her mind.</p><p>Penny squeezed her eyes tightly closed, fighting with every ounce of her being to shut it out. To shut <i>him </i>out. Bucky&rsquo;s arms wrapped around her and Penny cried out, jerking against him when he wouldn&rsquo;t let go.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Pen. You don&rsquo;t have to do anything you don&rsquo;t want to. I swear. Just breathe, baby. You&rsquo;re gonna have a panic attack if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>She went limp, unable to fight him and the memories at the same time. When Bucky lifted her up, she wrapped herself around him like a snake and held on until he deposited her on the dark grey sofa in the living room and dragged the white throw from the back to tuck around her.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know what the trigger had been, but he knew fear when he saw it. This wasn&rsquo;t from her recent trauma. This was old, deeply buried, and painful. A wound she hid that had festered. Once she was covered beneath the heavy blanket, Bucky gently collected her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Penny.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, James.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look, doll, I won&rsquo;t push,&rdquo; not yet anyway, &ldquo;but have you talked to someone about this?&rdquo;</p><p>She sighed and looked away. &ldquo;It was a long time ago. I thought I&rsquo;d gotten past it.&rdquo;</p><p>Shame filled her face. Embarrassment followed. Bucky prayed as he hadn&rsquo;t in years that what he suspected was wrong, but he&rsquo;d seen enough faces of abuse to recognize it. To find it on hers, on Penelope&rsquo;s, broke something inside him.</p><p>Nat&rsquo;s voice whispered in his mind. <i>You weren&rsquo;t the cause, but you made her choice easier.</i></p><p>&ldquo;My God, Pen. My God,&rdquo; he whispered, horrified as moments from that night began to click together in his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Please, James. Not now,&rdquo; she whimpered.</p><p>He dropped his head to her thigh and breathed through his mouth until the shaking stopped. They were about to have unwelcome guests. Being this out of control could be dangerous.</p><p>The light touch of her hand in his hair nearly broke him all over again. &ldquo;I could really use a stiff drink, Buck,&rdquo; she said softly.</p><p>He lifted his head to look at her. The sad smile shattered his heart. But then she cupped his cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Buck.&rdquo;</p><p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t, but she was trying to pull herself together, and he rose to stand on weak legs, and stumble his way to the brass and glass cart near the fireplace where he poured three fingers of scotch for her, and an entire tumbler for himself. He drank half of it before returning to her side.</p><p>She took the glass but gripped his hand before he could walk away. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because none of it was your fault,&rdquo; she sighed, appearing small and fragile.</p><p>He threw the rest of the scotch down his throat relishing the burn which dried the threatening tears but didn&rsquo;t let go of her hand. &ldquo;Steve doesn&rsquo;t know, does he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does anyone?&rdquo;</p><p>She pressed the tumbler to her cheek. &ldquo;Becca.&rdquo;</p><p>He ground his teeth together and put the glass down before he broke it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Pen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t look up but didn&rsquo;t release his hand either. That single point of contact was the only thing keeping him steady in his suddenly upside down world. He wanted to wrap his arms around her and hold her close. Comfort her like he should have all those years ago. Shame made him sick to his stomach for how he&rsquo;d treated her that night. It rolled in his gut.</p><p>He wanted to ask. It was worse not knowing the extent of how badly he&rsquo;d missed the signs. There he was, jealous, angry, thinking she&rsquo;d let someone paw at her, only to find out-</p><p>He slammed the brakes on that train of thought when the sound of the elevator starting its ascent dinged through the main floor of the apartment.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got this,&rdquo; she assured him, looking a little steadier than she had, though the erratic tripping of her heart concerned him.</p><p>&ldquo;Take deep breaths, Pen,&rdquo; he murmured, releasing her fingers to stride up the few steps from her sunken living area and cross the floor to wait arms crossed before the elevator.</p><p>No wonder she didn&rsquo;t date. She didn&rsquo;t trust men.</p><p>When Bucky caught a glimpse of himself in the polished doors, he thrust a hand through his hair and quickly rolled down his sleeves. He had his glove out and on, and a semblance of control returned to his face before the doors opened.</p><p>Detective McGilvrey was, according to his record, a good cop. But even good cops on paper could be bad guys. Bucky didn&rsquo;t trust his squeaky clean record.</p><p>When the second ding announced the arrival of the elevator, he slipped his right hand to the small of his back and gripped the Glock tucked there.</p><p>Tamara burst forth, paused, her eyes darting over him, before stepping around Bucky to head for the living room. It was clear she&rsquo;d come from some class as her hair was tied up, her clothes were leggings and a tank top over a colourful sports bra beneath a warm coat, and the sky-high heels from earlier were now running shoes.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Smith,&rdquo; he nodded to Tamara.</p><p>&ldquo;Sergeant Barnes,&rdquo; she said, her eyes sharp and face pinched. Evidently, her ride up in the elevator hadn&rsquo;t been a pleasant one with the detective for company.</p><p>&ldquo;McGilvery,&rdquo; he growled at the man. &ldquo;Miss Rogers has had a long day. Make it quick and watch yourself our I&rsquo;ll be seeing you out of the building.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do I feel like, &ldquo;The fast way,&rdquo; should be tacked onto that statement,&rdquo; he muttered, indicating the glass windows and balcony with a jerk of his chin.</p><p>A slow smile spread over Bucky&rsquo;s mouth when he stepped out of the way and motioned the man to proceed him, his right hand still gripping his gun. &ldquo;Take it whatever way you want.&rdquo;</p><p>McGilvery&rsquo;s shoes clicked on the floors, and Bucky smirked when the detective became aware his did not. The man&rsquo;s shoulders tightened and rose an inch before he forced them to relax, but Bucky could see the way the hair on the back of his neck stood up.</p><p>&ldquo;You ex-military?&rdquo; McGilvery asked.</p><p>&ldquo;When is anyone ever <i>ex</i>-military?&rdquo; Bucky murmured.</p><p>&ldquo;Marines, two tours in Afghanistan. You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m stupid, Detective? You know who I am,&rdquo; Bucky chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Yeah, I do. I&rsquo;m a fan. Never thought I&rsquo;d come face to face with James Barnes when I went to speak with Miss Rogers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hoping for Steve?&rdquo; Bucky asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Romanoff actually.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky snorted. &ldquo;The Widow would eat you alive.&rdquo;</p><p>McGilvery shot him a look and a wry smile. &ldquo;Would you think less of me if that was what I was hoping for?&rdquo;</p><p>A chuckle escaped him. The guy was charismatic when he wanted to be; Bucky would give him that. It wasn&rsquo;t hard to see Penny&rsquo;s blonde head where she was propped in the corner of the couch in her wide open floor plan, and Bucky followed McGilvery into the living room where Tamara had taken a seat beside Penny. Bucky stopped at Penny&rsquo;s side and laid his hand gently on her shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Rogers, thank you for seeing me. It&rsquo;s rather difficult to get past all your defences,&rdquo; McGilvery said, taking a seat across the coffee table from her.</p><p>&ldquo;Not difficult enough,&rdquo; Penny murmured, sipping from her cup.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve been through a trying time. I&rsquo;ll make this quick and painless,&rdquo; McGilvery said with a smile.</p><p>Penny shuddered beneath Bucky&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d appreciate you getting on with it then, Detective instead of repeating the words my assailant used to see if you can get a reaction.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ask your questions, Detective,&rdquo; Tamara said sharply.</p><p>&ldquo;Nate, please ladies. No need for formalities. After all, it&rsquo;s not as if Miss Rogers had anything to do with her assault.&rdquo; He looked straight at Penny.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would I?&rdquo; Penny snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;Just what are you implying, Detective? That my client hired those people? For what purpose?&rdquo; Tamara demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;People have done stranger things for publicity, or to cover up something else. After all, you&rsquo;ve got that nasty company audit coming up. What better way to push it back then an attack on the owner.&rdquo;</p><p>Penny stiffened. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>McGilvery smirked. &ldquo;Come now, Miss Rogers. Don&rsquo;t play innocent. Your capital gains and losses are off the charts. And with the rumours you&rsquo;ll be going public in the next year swirling, it was bound to happen that the IRS would be sticking their nose in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky, I need my phone,&rdquo; she breathed on a rush of air.</p><p>Though he didn&rsquo;t like leaving her, it wasn&rsquo;t far from the kitchen, and he could see all the players easily enough. When he returned with it, no one had moved or spoken. Penny took it from him, dialled a preset number, clicked the speaker button, and set it on the coffee table in front of her.</p><p>It rang five times before he picked it up. &ldquo;Penny, dear! How are you?&rdquo; From the sound of the background noise, the man was partying rather hard.</p><p>&ldquo;Cut the crap, Marcus!&rdquo; Penny snapped. &ldquo;Am I being audited?&rdquo;</p><p>Silence, then the background noise faded as a door clicked shut. &ldquo;Look, Penny&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Son of a bitch, Marcus! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; she exploded.</p><p>&ldquo;It was your first day back!&rdquo; he whined.</p><p>&ldquo;Marcus, don&rsquo;t! From the sounds of it, this isn&rsquo;t something you <i>just </i>found out about! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me before?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Penny. I&rsquo;ve got it under control.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; she snarled and hung up, an unholy fire blazing in her eyes. &ldquo;As you can see, Detective, I have only just been made aware of this. And as my brother has already stated, the attack on me had to do with getting back at him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With an inside twist,&rdquo; McGilvery said. &ldquo;After all, your building has more security than most in the city. They had to have help getting in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The new higher security guard was the source of that, Detective, as you should also know,&rdquo; Tamara snapped. &ldquo;My client had nothing to do with what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What were they after, Penelope? What were they looking for in your office?&rdquo; McGilvery pressed, leaning forward.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Penny said, slamming her glass down on the coffee table.</p><p>&ldquo;This interview is over,&rdquo; Bucky stated coldly, motion for McGilvery to stand up.</p><p>&ldquo;This had nothing to do with your brother, did it? We can&rsquo;t protect you if you don&rsquo;t coopera-&ldquo;</p><p>McGilvery never got to finish his sentence when Bucky wrapped his gloved hand around the man&rsquo;s throat, thumb and forefinger squeezing his jawbone hard enough to make it clear Bucky could and would break it to shut him up, and lifted the large man with minimal effort to his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;I said you&rsquo;re done. Time to go.&rdquo; He jerked the detective around and gave him a shove which sent him stumbling toward the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;I could have you arrested for assaulting an officer!&rdquo; McGilvery snarled.</p><p>&ldquo;You could try,&rdquo; Bucky smiled darkly. &ldquo;But then, I outrank you, <i>Detective</i>. So you go ahead. Let&rsquo;s see what happens.&rdquo;</p><p>McGilvery ground his teeth together and stormed for the elevator. When the doors opened, Bucky reached around and pounded the button for the lobby.</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t over,&rdquo; Nate stated as the doors began to close.</p><p>Bucky caught them before they could. &ldquo;You just came into Penelope Rogers home and harassed her. Yeah, Detective, it is. And when I explain this fucking shit show to her brother and just how upset she was by it, boy, you&rsquo;ll be lucky to keep your badge.&rdquo; Bucky let the doors go on McGilvery&rsquo;s pale face.</p><p>Penny was speaking quietly with Tamara when he returned. &ldquo;Did you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Penny, I didn&rsquo;t. I swear. I don&rsquo;t know why he didn&rsquo;t contact legal as soon as the notice arrived.&rdquo; Tamara fidgeted with her shirt. &ldquo;Marcus has been&hellip; distant lately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Distant?&rdquo; Penny frowned. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whispered conversations. Late night texts. He disappears for hours and won&rsquo;t tell me where he&rsquo;s gone. Penny, I know I&rsquo;m not exactly an <i>attentive </i>girlfriend being busy with my firm, but I thought&hellip; we were happy. Now? I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Tam.&rdquo; Penny threw her arms around the woman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. I haven&rsquo;t exactly been the best friend these last few years, have I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all busy now, but I do miss Friday night drinks,&rdquo; Tamara sighed, hugging her back.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to try harder,&rdquo; Penny announced.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in!&rdquo; Tamara laughed. &ldquo;Ugh, but not tonight. I smell like spin class.&rdquo;</p><p>Penny&rsquo;s nose wrinkled. &ldquo;Maybe a little.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Tamara smirked. &ldquo;Kick a girl when she&rsquo;s down. And in front of hot bodyguard. Some friend you are.&rdquo;</p><p>A snort left Penny when she turned to look at Bucky, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not that hot. I&rsquo;ve seen better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your pretty boy brother doesn&rsquo;t count,&rdquo; Bucky groused, causing both women to laugh.</p><p>***</p><p>Later, after Tamara and Penny had spent another hour visiting and regaling Bucky with stories of their university adventures, he showed Tamara to the elevator.</p><p>&ldquo;Sergeant?&rdquo; she said softly, her hand hovering over the button for the lobby. &ldquo;Take care of her. She acts tough, but she&rsquo;s more fragile than people know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s stronger than you think, Miss Smith.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even strong people can break under this kind of stress. She&rsquo;s terrible at needing people. I think she&rsquo;s going to need you, and not just for protection.&rdquo;</p><p>Tamara&rsquo;s dark eyes locked with his as the elevator doors closed. Something in them warned him to heed her request.</p><p>Bucky turned around to find the living room empty and sighed, wondering if Penny had gone to bed. He had questions. Lots of questions. Was he ever going to get answers? Then the light clicked on in her office, and he headed down the hall.</p><p>Penny was talking to her AI when he arrived in the doorway. &ldquo;Friday, you remember those numbers you said were funky in the last round of financials Marcus sent us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Penny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to take a closer look,&rdquo; she all but growled. &ldquo;Full scan. In-depth. Dig deep, girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Friday murmured.</p><p>&ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo; Bucky asked, striding into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Coffee?&rdquo; she said, glancing his way.</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t sleep tonight,&rdquo; he murmured.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be sleeping anyway.&rdquo; She stood to her full height, the look on her face the bone-chilling one of the Ice Queen. &ldquo;The only reason I can think of for him not telling me about this when it happened? Marcus has been cooking my books. My books! Dammit!&rdquo; She brought her fist down on the desk hard enough it had to hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;Pen, if he has you&rsquo;ll find it,&rdquo; he said, striding forward to collect her hands before she could do herself further damage.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, though?&rdquo; she asked, suddenly sounding lost and confused along with angry. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s paid better than anyone else on staff. The man makes seven figures a year! There&rsquo;s no reason to steal from me. And these rumours about going public? That&rsquo;s the second time I&rsquo;ve heard it today! What the hell is going on in my company?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby,&rdquo; Bucky murmured, releasing her hands to frame her face. The hurt in her eyes gutted him. &ldquo;People steal for any number of reasons, but if he was embezzling from your company, and he thought killing you would give him control and get the government off his back, allowing him the time to take the company public and replace the funds he&rsquo;d stolen&hellip; Penny, that&rsquo;s motive.&rdquo;</p><p>She inhaled sharply.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he murmured, gently massaging the tight muscles of her neck. &ldquo;You run the numbers. I&rsquo;m going to work a deep dive into Marcus&rsquo;s background. I already skimmed the surface today, but I&rsquo;ll look deeper and see what I can find.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; She closed her eyes and exhaled hard. Her shoulders slumped right before her forehead landed on his chest. &ldquo;I hate all of this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, Pen. I know,&rdquo; Bucky murmured, hugging her carefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the coffee.&rdquo; He patted her back and headed for the kitchen.</p><p>***</p><p>Hours later, Bucky had a sick feeling in his stomach when he set his tablet down and looked at Penny dozing off at her desk. He had more questions then he did answers, but one thing had become glaringly apparent.</p><p>Taft had ties to Hydra.</p><p>Penny&rsquo;s eyes closed and stayed that way. Her breathing deepened, and Bucky stood slowly to his feet. He may have made the coffee, but he hadn&rsquo;t promised to make it caffeinated. He preferred tea anyway. Too many cups of coffee and he was jittering, on edge, and surly. Tea had a much more soothing effect and didn&rsquo;t make him jumpy.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday,&rdquo; he murmured, still watching Penny.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Sergeant?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How bad is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still compiling the data,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Guess.&rdquo;</p><p>She was quiet for a moment before a sound like a sigh registered. &ldquo;I have looked at the last five years of financials from Mr. Taft. All five years show discrepancies. The information Penny has been given does not correlate with what has been coming in and going out from the different departments. I have also found two departments which do not exist. One has money being syphoned into it. The other has money going out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you saying someone is washing their money through Penny&rsquo;s company?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It appears so,&rdquo; Friday murmured. &ldquo;But the money going out is higher than what is coming in. So far, thirty million is missing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Son of a bitch!&rdquo; Bucky hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;And I am not yet finished. Penny has had this company for ten years. If Taft has been doing this since the beginning, it will be higher.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky scrubbed his hand over his face. &ldquo;Fuck. Can you follow the money? See where it is going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I already have. It is routed many times into offshore accounts, and while I am talented, I am not Jarvis. I do not have the ability to slip past their firewalls to see where it has gone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying Stark&rsquo;s AI could get us all the way to the end point?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is highly probable,&rdquo; she agreed.</p><p>He pulled his phone from his pocket and made the call, unsurprised when Stark answered the phone at three in the morning.</p><p>&ldquo;Tinman, what do you want? It better not be that arm. It was perfect when you left.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky snorted at that after what Penny had to say about it earlier. &ldquo;Hardly, Stark. I need your AI.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony remained silent for a moment before muttering, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s already in the vehicle. What more could you need?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Friday says Jarvis can do what she can&rsquo;t. I need your AI to follow the money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Money?&rdquo; Tony asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, money. And before you ask, no, I won&rsquo;t tell you what money. Let&rsquo;s just say it has to do with Penny and why she was attacked. Can I borrow him or not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Barnes, Jarvis isn&rsquo;t I toy I can lend you, you can hand back when you&rsquo;re done. Once he&rsquo;s in the system, he&rsquo;s in. You can&rsquo;t limit what he does and what he knows.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Friday?&rdquo; Bucky murmured. &ldquo;Thoughts?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps&hellip; Jarvis could teach me what I need to know to be of better assistance to Penny? I would appreciate the company,&rdquo; she said softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Who the hell is Friday?&rdquo; Stark asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Penny&rsquo;s Jarvis,&rdquo; Bucky muttered. &ldquo;Do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll email you a link. Open it and set your phone on Penelope&rsquo;s desk.&rdquo;</p><p>Stark hung up, and a second later Bucky&rsquo;s phone chimed with the email. &ldquo;You sure about this, Friday?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, but I need the assistance,&rdquo; she admitted.</p><p>Bucky took a deep breath, shot a glance at Penny, and blew it out. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gonna skin me, I just know it.&rdquo; Still, he tapped the link and laid his phone on her desk before moving to her side and lifting her from her chair.</p><p>She mumbled something unintelligible and curled into him trustingly. Bucky&rsquo;s heart lurched. Her trust after what he&rsquo;d learned today was humbling, and while he wanted answers, tonight wasn&rsquo;t the time to ask for them. But he vowed to be more careful with her.</p><p>Striding from the room, Bucky took her up the stairs two at a time. She was too light to his mind, and even at rest, he could hear the strange fluttering of her heart. It didn&rsquo;t beat as it should but skipped and jumped around. The sound was odd, but he pushed aside for later contemplation.</p><p>He took her to her bed and laid her down, gently removing her sweater and socks before covering her with the throw from the foot of her bed. It was a moment of deja vu, but this time he sat on the edge of it and brushed her hair from her cheek. Her face was soft in sleep; her long lashes pillowed on her cheeks. She was beautiful no matter how he looked at her, but now she looked fragile and so very innocent.</p><p>Guilt soured his stomach again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Pen,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Sorry for not seeing it then. So damn sorry for how I acted. I was a stupid, jealous idiot. I thought&hellip; it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I thought. I should never have done what I did when you were upset.&rdquo;</p><p>She surprised him when she rolled over and looked at him, her blue eyes dark with memories. &ldquo;I had such a crush on you.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky looked away, more guilt weighing on him. &ldquo;I was immature and stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to hate you. I did for a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you tell me what happened?&rdquo; he asked, his voice breaking.</p><p>This time she looked away. Then she sat up, pulled her knees to her chest, and set her chin on them. &ldquo;Becca and I went to that party. I was feeling pretty good what with being newly seventeen and having finally caught the notice of James Barnes. I think I was living on a virtual high with how giddy spending time with you made me feel,&rdquo; she smirked a little, then sighed. &ldquo;Marcy&rsquo;s parents were out of town, and by the time we got there, the party was huge. Becca was seeing Kevin at the time and ditched me as soon as she found him, but I was used to it. I love her, but the girl was boy crazy. I went and got a drink and hung out with some other friends, then&hellip;&rdquo; she hesitated, her breath catching, &ldquo;this guy came up and started talking to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you know him?&rdquo; Bucky asked, wondering if she went to school with them.</p><p>Penny shook her head. &ldquo;He was older than me. Some friend of a friend&rsquo;s brother or something.&rdquo; She closed her eyes and set her cheek on her knee; her face turned toward him. &ldquo;He offered to get me a drink.&rdquo;</p><p>His heart dropped into his stomach. &ldquo;Pen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The stupid thing is, I knew better, but I thought that could never happen to me. I kept thinking that right up until I came to with him on top of me.&rdquo; Tears filled her voice, hoarse and torn enough to make Bucky&rsquo;s ache in sympathy. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know him, but he knew me. He said, &ldquo;I sure grew up pretty,&rdquo; and thanked me for the fuck. I was so horrified and disgusted both with him and myself I threw up over the side of the bed. It freaked him out, and he got off of me, threw out the condom he&rsquo;d used, got dressed and left. For a moment, all I could think was, &ldquo;Thank God he used protection.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Penny.&rdquo; Hearing it was like being stabbed with a knife to the heart over and over.</p><p>&ldquo;I tore my shirt getting dressed I was in such a hurry to get the hell out of there, but I could taste him in my mouth.&rdquo; She gave a silent gasp, tears escaping past her closed lids. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what he did. I hurt&hellip; everywhere, but he&rsquo;d been in my mouth&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky wanted to reach out and hold her but was afraid to touch her until she groped for his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;So I stopped in the kitchen and grabbed a can of beer, but I was shaking so hard I spilled it on myself. I drank half of it before I couldn&rsquo;t taste him anymore and then left, running home to hide in the treehouse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where I showed up and&hellip;&rdquo; Bucky couldn&rsquo;t finish. &ldquo;God, Pen.&rdquo; The tears he&rsquo;d been fighting spilled down his cheeks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the biggest jerk.&rdquo;</p><p>She squeezed his hand. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know. I was too numb and too sick and embarrassed and horrified to be able to express myself. I could hardly admit it to myself, let alone tell you. God!&rdquo; She gave a choked laugh. &ldquo;I was terrified to tell anyone. So scared you&rsquo;d be as disgusted with me as I was with myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, Penny! Of course not! Fuck, if Steve and I had known, we would have hunted that fucker down and-&rdquo; He cut himself off from finishing with <i>castrated him.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Made him eat his own balls?&rdquo; she murmured, her ocean eyes peering out at him from behind her wet lashes.</p><p>&ldquo;Something like that, yeah,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;You know not every man is like that.&rdquo;</p><p>She gave a tired sigh. &ldquo;I know that in theory, but then I met Aaron in Uni.&rdquo;</p><p>His blood froze. Not twice. If she said it happened twice, he was going to lose his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what you think,&rdquo; she murmured, evidently seeing the panic on his face. &ldquo;We dated, but I couldn&rsquo;t&hellip; when things would get physical, I got&hellip;&rdquo; Red filled her cheeks as she turned her face away. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even remember what happened thanks to the drugs, but I just&hellip; just couldn&rsquo;t. And he was okay with it. He didn&rsquo;t push me for sex. I was so thankful until I realized he was using me. He stole one of my very first designs and tried to pass it off as his own. Thankfully I had the documents and things to back up my claim, but when I confronted him about it and asked him if anything about our relationship was real,&rdquo; she pressed her forehead to her knees, &ldquo;he laughed,&rdquo; Penny whispered. &ldquo;Laughed and called me frigid. He and his buddies had quite the chuckle over the whole thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Christ!&rdquo; Bucky hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;I got the last laugh when I had him arrested for theft, and then turned around and sold my invention for fifty thousand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dollars!&rdquo; Bucky barked.</p><p>Penny chuckled. &ldquo;Yeah. Dollars.&rdquo; She leaned toward him and rested her head on his shoulder. &ldquo;After Aaron, I gave up on men. What was the point when they just kept taking things from me? The only one I could trust to have my back was Steve, and you were right about one thing. There&rsquo;s no one like him, and few people can live up to his standards. Now with what Marcus is probably doing, it looks like my luck with men is holding.&rdquo;</p><p>She gave a defeated sigh and Bucky wrapped his arm around her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m real sorry, Pen. I should never have said what I did. It was mean, and I was jealous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jealous?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought&hellip;&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t say it, not after what she&rsquo;d just told him. &ldquo;I was mad because&hellip; <i>fuck</i>! I was twenty-four, and so fucking attracted to you &mdash; my best friend&rsquo;s seventeen-year-old sister. You were so sweet and good and lovely. Looking at you helped me forget some of the less tenable parts of what Steve and I were being asked to do. The idea you&rsquo;d&hellip; been with someone else, I was hurt and jealous and said foolish things.&rdquo;</p><p>She lifted her head to look at him, surprise in her eyes. &ldquo;You&hellip; you wanted me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Pen. I wanted you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I so badly wanted you to kiss me on my birthday,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Then when you did after what happened&hellip; all I could think was, &ldquo;If you knew what had just happened, you&rsquo;d be so disgusted by me.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t even know what he&rsquo;d done, and your mouth was on mine. Then you said what you did, and it was everything I felt about myself at that moment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby girl,&rdquo; Bucky gently cupped her chin in his hand. &ldquo;I could never be disgusted with you. Nothing that happened was your fault. You know that right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew better than to take that drink,&rdquo; she whispered, her eyes haunted.</p><p>&ldquo;He chose to drug you. He&rsquo;s the one who-&rdquo; Bucky swallowed the bile in his throat, &ldquo;raped you. None of that is on you, Pen.&rdquo;</p><p>She sighed and closed her eyes. &ldquo;I know that, but I still feel&hellip; dirty. It&rsquo;s been years, but I can&rsquo;t shake the feeling. Sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m cursed to be disappointed in men. Steve&rsquo;s so&hellip; good. It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s all the good I&rsquo;m allowed to have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true, Pen. You can&rsquo;t think like that!&rdquo; he insisted, pulling her closer until they were hip to hip, her hand linked with his, the other curled against his chest. &ldquo;There are good guys out there besides Steve.&rdquo; He shifted his metal hand to the back of her neck and drew her up out of her hunched position. &ldquo;There are other guys you can trust to have your back. Like me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;James,&rdquo; she whispered, her hand gliding up to rest against his neck; her thumb skimmed the edge of his jaw, back and forth over his stubble.</p><p>&ldquo;Penny, baby girl,&rdquo; he swallowed thickly. &ldquo;Can I tell you something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Considering everything I just told you?&rdquo; She gave a wry smile. &ldquo;Yeah, Bucky. Anything.&rdquo;</p><p>His gaze drifted down to her lips, plump and pink and parted before lifting to lock with her eyes. The ocean blue was mesmerizing, deep and dark and mysterious like the sea itself. &ldquo;I wanted to kiss you on your birthday, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Her breath shuddered out, and her gaze dropped to his lips. &ldquo;I wish you had.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would have done it so differently,&rdquo; he murmured, her thumb continuing to gently stroke his jaw.</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Softer, gentler. Sweet like you.&rdquo;</p><p>Her hand skimmed slowly forward until her thumb rubbed over his lower lip. &ldquo;You were my first.&rdquo;</p><p>He groaned and let his forehead rest against hers. &ldquo;Damn, Pen. Now I really feel like shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then&hellip; um&hellip;&rdquo; She cleared her throat and looked away. &ldquo;Maybe we could have a do-over?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that what you want?&rdquo; he asked, his heart jumping to his throat.&nbsp;</p><p>Her lashes lifted slowly to reveal the uncertainty but also the tentative hope in her eyes. &ldquo;It would be nice to have one from someone who wanted to, and who didn&rsquo;t want to take something from me in return,&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>She pulled away. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to, Bucky just say so.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky tugged her back. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that, darlin&rsquo;. Not at all. You&rsquo;ve just told me some pretty emotional stuff. I don&rsquo;t want to take advantage here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; she said, slowly shaking her head. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p><p>He lightly stroked her spine. &ldquo;A do-over, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby girl, that was real sweet,&rdquo; he sighed, a smile twitching his lips. &ldquo;Should I show you how it should have been? Your first kiss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, James,&rdquo; she purred, carding her fingers through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; he smirked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s real nice.&rdquo; His hand tightened gently in Penny&rsquo;s hair and pulled to tilt her chin up. He took his time bringing their mouths together, watching desire swim in her ocean blues. Their noses brushed, bumped, and rubbed together as he teased her a little, his upper lip ever so lightly skimming hers until a quiet whimper left her. Only then did he take her lips, her sweet, soft lips in a tender kiss. The kind of kiss that lingered. The kind of first kiss she deserved. The kind that smouldered instead of burned.</p><p>Her lips parted on a gentle sigh. Bucky couldn&rsquo;t help but flick his tongue over the bottom one. Penny&rsquo;s arm went around his neck as he lifted her to his thigh. The taste of her was like candy, sweet and sinful when her tongue tangled with his. She moaned and he echoed it, deciding kissing her was a bad idea. Penny was addictive. He was never going to get enough.</p><p>Penny pulled slowly back, her lips clinging to his until the last possible second. Her quiet sigh was nearly his undoing, so he drew her down and kissed her again. It was just as soft and sweet, just as tender until she sank her teeth into his lower lip and nibbled.</p><p>&ldquo;Penny,&rdquo; Bucky groaned.</p><p>She smiled when she lifted her head and ran her fingers through his hair. &ldquo;Thank you, James.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Any time, baby girl,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Any time.&rdquo;</p><p>She rested her head on his shoulder, and Bucky held her close. It was comfortable, and though he still felt terrible about how he&rsquo;d treated her and what she&rsquo;d gone through, he thought maybe they&rsquo;d found a place to start from again. If she could trust him, he would do his best to help her heal the worst of her wounds.</p><p>Bucky tucked his nose down in her hair and breathed in the scent of peaches and vanilla. The smell made him smile even as her trauma made his heart ache.</p><p><b><i><a href=\"https://tilltheendwilliwrite.tumblr.com/post/178919420478/the-bodyguard\">Next Chapter</a></i></b></p><p><b><i>To be added to the tag list, please send an Ask.</i></b></p></p>",

In fact, she&rsquo;d eaten more today than she usually did in three days. Barnes was obsessed with stuffing food in her face and with cutting back her caffeine intake. She&rsquo;d reached for her fifth cup of coffee when they&rsquo;d returned from the lab, only to be handed a cup of tea instead. As she&rsquo;d been on the phone with the Head of Oncology at Johns Hopkins, she hadn&rsquo;t the ability to bitch Barnes out, ending up drinking the surprisingly tasty tea.</p>\n<p>By six he&rsquo;d been dragging her to her feet, refusing to let her stay longer her first day back, and hustled her out the door, down the elevator, and into the car even as she protested she still had work to do.
