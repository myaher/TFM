I think you might actually count Bran as one of those people who died and came back, but he came back changed. Reborn. He\u2019s The Three Eyed Crow. He\u2019s still Bran Stark, but he\u2019s not. His life means something else now. He ceded Winterfell to Sansa. His path is different.\u00a0</p><p>He never actually played the game of thrones though. He wan\u2019t interested. He was a little boy looking for adventure when he was pushed from the tower and died the first time. He didn\u2019t really die, but his life as son of Winterfell kind of did. But he REALLY died when he went beyond the wall and went on that spiritual trip. The magic took him. He\u2019s no longer a boy, he\u2019s a mystic.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m not sure he GETS to die anymore.
