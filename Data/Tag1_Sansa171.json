It would be somewhat much to cut something out just so that a few delulu shippers will get duped. As far as I remember we always saw actual tidbits.</p><p>The wider context is something completely different of course and it is possible that Jon tells Dany to wait. That wouldn&rsquo;t be too bad though. Whatever Jon&rsquo;s feelings, it might be a good idea to be the first to greet Sansa and smooth things over.</p><p>Although I would say that Jon&rsquo;s face we saw in the first promo did not look like someone who urgently wanted to say something. It looked like someone who wanted to get home and into the arms of someone dear.</p><p>I think it is possible that Jon whispered something in Sansa&rsquo;s ear when they hugged. You could interprete Sansa&rsquo;s side eyes as her snapping to attention after Jon whispered something. We will see when episode 1 airs.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think that we will have more dialogue in these few seconds we saw, so no reciting of many titles etc. Another anon saw wide mist coming from Jon&rsquo;s mouth and also suspected he said something, but I doubt it. <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJHsK6Pc1_SMBWpoQTzURow\">@athimbleful</a> made a gifset of this scene side by side with the discussion Jon and Sansa have with Lord Glover and there you can see that Jon&rsquo;s breath puffs mist in the air as well - but he doesn&rsquo;t say anything in that scene either.</p><p>For Jorah I would say that the explanation by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJHsK6Pc1_SMBWpoQTzURow\">@athimbleful</a> makes more sense. Jorah rejoices because he sees that Jon is indeed not that much into D and sees his own star rising again or his suspicions confirmed.</p><p>As for D&rsquo;s smug smile: it is clearly directed at Sansa. It says: mine, mine and is the smile of the type &lsquo;mean girl&rsquo; that comes as an early triumph because the boy is hers. If she were proud of Jon, she would smile at Jon and with a nicer more render smile - just my interpretation of course.</p><p>I think that the whole scene is set up to remember us of King Robert&rsquo;s arrival. And the differences are significant. Sansa bids D welcome in the exact same wording as Ned, an ambiguous wording that could mean 'welcome to Winterfell&rsquo; or 'my loyalty is yours&rsquo;. With Ned it meant both, with Sansa it means none of the above but is just hollow words. The visual differences are also significant. Nobody kneels, D and Jorah are set in opposite to Jon and Sansa. Jon joins team Winterfell before D comes close. The shots of D, Jon and Sansa are shots that hint at a love triangle. </p><p>All in all I don&rsquo;t think that this is meant to be a warm welcome or even the attempt for one by Jon. If Jon would have wanted to orchestrate the greeting he could have either escorted Dany as the loyal Warden he supposedly is or he could have come in advance and could have prepared everybody to kneel to give a proper welcome to the Queen as we saw it in the pilot.</p><p>As always with scenes with Jon and D my mind can come up with little twists that would make these far less ambiguous. I&rsquo;m in no way a film expert.. That I can come up with a different scenario more positive for Jon\u20acnerys is telling I think. I hope to have diverted you from your fears somewhat. \ud83d\ude07</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

If Jon would have wanted to orchestrate the greeting he could have either escorted Dany as the loyal Warden he supposedly is or he could have come in advance and could have prepared everybody to kneel to give a proper welcome to the Queen as we saw it in the pilot.</p><p>As always with scenes with Jon and D my mind can come up with little twists that would make these far less ambiguous. I&rsquo;m in no way a film expert.. That I can come up with a different scenario more positive for Jon&euro;nerys is telling I think. I hope to have diverted you from your fears somewhat. &#128519;</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

And it\nmight be hard to see that as a flaw of hers. </p><p>In the past seasons, we&rsquo;ve like that about Daenerys. We also\nlike that about Jon Snow, Arya Stark, Ned Stark and Olenna Tyrell &ndash; cutting through\nthe bullshit with blunt honesty. Being direct and concise and not playing the\nstupid and pointless political games. </p><p>These characters are often performing a wish-fulfillment for\nthe audience, we would love to tell off other people who are clearly not doing\nwhat they should be doing and just cut through all the fake-smiles.&nbsp;</p><p>Especially\nif you work in the service industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Or sometimes the character does what we\nwant to see happen in our own real-world politics. </p><p>It&rsquo;s not exactly a bad trait, but it&rsquo;s also certainly not a\ngood one (honestly, it depends on the situation). </p><p>Daenerys not really knowing how to or I would argue, not\nreally having the patience for the long game, isn&rsquo;t a strength of hers, though. And\npersonally, I see that as more of a flaw.</p><p>In life, you have to play nice.&nbsp;</p><p>And in the world of Westeros,\nyou have to play the political game. You don&rsquo;t have to fight for the Iron\nThrone like Cersei (and Dany and others think), but you are part of the\noverall scheme. </p><p>And this is also where the difference between Conquerors and\nQueens/Kings comes into play. You have to get people on your side and currently\nwhen there are multiple &ldquo;heirs&rdquo; for the Iron Throne, that&rsquo;s more important than\never. </p><p>You want people to want you on the Throne. And no major groups\nof people in Westeros actively want Daenerys on the Throne. They also don&rsquo;t\nwant Cersei, but if your best-selling point is that you might be slightly better\nthan Cersei Lannister&hellip;well, good luck with that. </p><p>A conqueror or tyrant threatens and uses hard or violent\npower and while a King/Queen can also do that, arguably that leaves more of a\nbad impression and an even worse taste in one&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>Cersei is not a good\nqueen for blowing up the Sept. Joffrey was not a good king for hurting Sansa. And\nKing Aerys II was not a good king for torturing and killing his subjects. </p><p>Bad blood begins to spill over &ndash; 2 out of 3, so far, have\nbeen killed by those they &lsquo;trusted&rsquo; or at least would never suspect. </p><p>Dany should&rsquo;ve learned from Meereen &ndash; conquering and ruling\nare two very different beasts. One can be done in an &ldquo;instant&rdquo; and the other is\nnever truly done, you will always have to work &ndash; if you are to be a good ruler\nor leader. </p><p>And Dany lacks that patience. </p><p>So, depending on how long the political drama/game goes on\nbetween Daenerys and the Starks, I am interested to see how Dany handles it. </p><p>I personally believe, Daenerys will get frustrated with\nSansa. Who I think will never be open or exactly warm to her, but always\ncourteous and polite. Which yeah, that would be frustrating from Dany&rsquo;s POV, but you have to still grin and bear it.&nbsp;</p><p>Or maybe even, Daenerys might view Sansa and the other\nStarks as threats to Jon.</p><p>From an outsider perspective (maybe even Tyrion and Jorah),\nthere might be speculation that the legitimate Stark children are angry and\nupset with Jon &ndash; &ldquo;he took Winterfell from under their nose and then gave it\naway.&rdquo; </p><p>Other siblings have killed one another for their family&rsquo;s\nseat of power.</p><p>Perhaps, Tyrion or Jorah might want to separate Dany from\nJon, possibly hinting at her siding with the Legitimate Stark Children in this &ldquo;battle\nfor Winterfell.&rdquo;</p><p>But the Starks aren&rsquo;t like other families, as we&rsquo;ve been\nshown.

Unlike Cersei, she moves away from beading as winter has come and rather takes to using quilting to express herself and also to cover up her seams.\u00a0</p><p>The dresses are quilted with padding for protection against coid winter despite the armor like cuts. The materials she uses are either her recycling what she had before or merely working with textures of simple fabric and patterns in a limited way. It shows frugality considering the point in time, while also not taking away Sansa\u2019s connection to the sewing needle altogether. In Sansa\u2019s case, the act of sewing is a very intimate affair because it\u2019s a way of her remembering her mother, Septa Mordane and her childhood.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>\u201c<i>I wanted a <b>real strength</b>,\u201d Clapton says. \u201cI think that she\u2019s embraced everything that\u2019s happened to her.\u201d The designer chose to adorn Sansa with a heavy belt that wraps around her neck and goes to her waistline, covering a double-breasted dress.\u201c<b>It\u2019s almost like \u2018no one will ever get to me again,</b>\u2019\u201d Clapton says. <b>\u201cThere\u2019s an armor to her.

Sansa wears these dresses either on their own or with the cloak except for the third, which she always wears with a shoulder fur, even when not with a cloak.\u00a0</p><p>Interestingly, the fabric of all three is similar, but the quilting of the Eyrie dress especially makes it seem like it is made out of a thicker material that almost resembles Dany\u2019s winter cloak. But if you look closely, it\u2019s similar to Northern fabrics used before. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3840\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9521d58e31d6cc2637a5f32b0f2c794/tumblr_inline_pl13cvQ3o21u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3840\"/></figure><p>It has textures of the roughspun Northern dresses we\u2019ve seen before. It\u2019s not fine material like silks but it\u2019s still comfortable and is functional in keeping warm. It\u2019s also quilted and provided with a soft padding underneath and probably lined inside with wool. The other fabrics and textures, which include feathers, patchwork or thread work, are sewn onto the costumes to form the geometrical patterns.</p><p><b>Dress #1: The Eyrie feathers</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f3f03d1edfb17a375c7aaec08bc089f/tumblr_inline_pkynbydwnU1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\"/></figure><p>The feathers on this dress are from the Eyrie dress that was used in season 4 and 5. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"4858\" data-orig-height=\"2655\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2cf14cf2b67cf67efe35537a32eecabb/tumblr_inline_pkynhraykZ1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4858\" data-orig-height=\"2655\"/></figure><p>It references her alliance with the Vale, but doesn\u2019t stop at that. The presence of armor is most pronounced by this dress because of its stark suppression of sexuality with the strips of Eyrie feathers covering the exposed section of her cleavage and going up to her neck, where she wears a high collar, and tapering down to her waist.</p><p>The strips the feathers are placed on are straight rather than curved and because of this reassembling from afar they could resemble scales and thus appear less gentle. In fact, the Tully armor has scales like this. Though the silhouette is completely different. \u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"560\" data-orig-height=\"373\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fab57adb3f003e54a0335f4c267cd69/tumblr_inline_pkynhtaHPc1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"560\" data-orig-height=\"373\"/></figure><p>Additionally, the feathers in that dress evolve into shoulder tabs resembling Northern armor pieces or furs and the feathers surrounding the back come up in the Northern women collar piece. Instead of embroidery around it, the symbolic significance is sized down to the use of these feathers on it topped with metallic direwolves on its ends.\u00a0\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3915\" data-orig-height=\"2871\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/332781a8014aedda878d3123a3d5ee34/tumblr_inline_pkynwzx2il1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3915\" data-orig-height=\"2871\"/></figure><p>What\u2019s also interesting about it is how it seems to be recycling patches from the previous dress such that the edges are rough as she places one top of the other like plates. It\u2019s not as finely done as her Eyrie dress. She also uses vertical lines to quilt the dress.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Overall, the way it is refashioned its silhouette resembles the Night\u2019s Watch training armor. And of course, the brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch are known as \u201ccrows\u201d, who are quite closely related to ravens.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"4256\" data-orig-height=\"2832\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d4c84594cb2f24eb12a24cbe8bd1120/tumblr_inline_pkynijL4US1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4256\" data-orig-height=\"2832\"/></figure><p>Thus, she\u2019s bringing all parts of her journey together. </p><p>Interestingly, unlike the Eyrie dress and the Night\u2019s Watch armor, Sansa\u2019s dress is grey, although it looks almost like black in poor lighting. This dress isn\u2019t for anyone\u2019s benefit like the Eyrie dress was. </p><p>Where the season 4 \u201craven dress\u201d was meant entice, her season 7 version of the Eyrie feathers is meant to shield her from the male gaze. It still sends a \u201cmessage\u201d nonetheless. Not only to keep those who want to violate her body away from her, but also in a way to appeal to a patriarchal society that she has more worth than just her body.\u00a0</p><p>Still there is a kind of juxtaposition between the structure of the dress as it has bird feathers, which follow Sansa\u2019s winged imagery through seasons, but the way it is arranged in straight lines it is a lot more constrained. She\u2019s confined in it as much as it acts as an armor. </p><p><b>Dress #2: Criss Cross Pattern</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5113\" data-orig-height=\"2516\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/882856369f5cd9e201448115176fe0a9/tumblr_inline_pkynd8NBCU1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5113\" data-orig-height=\"2516\"/></figure><p>While it isn\u2019t obvious because of the poor lighting, not only does Sansa wear this with her cloak and furs but also she wears it in the scene where Jon gives the North to her in 7x02. The criss cross pattern isn\u2019t just a print but rather made from placing strips of different cloths on top of each other like patchwork. Thereby it\u2019s a lot more textured. When not wearing furs, she pairs it up with the Northern woman\u2019s collar with two metallic direwolves lined with raven feathers from her Eyrie dress.\u00a0\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"5120\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f294cb2cf192bed985074d0c6a067d83/tumblr_inline_pkynhc8Ux11u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"5120\"/></figure><p>The pattern on the dress could be the central rhombus on the Northern leather armor with finer lines. Or it could also be a minimalist fish swimming vertically.\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3840\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f549e48bb35e949d81792bdf2b64ccf5/tumblr_inline_pkynjua16w1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3840\"/></figure><p>Considering the scene in 7x03 is where she\u2019s talking about layering the armors to protect the soldiers from the cold, it\u2019s most likely an armor pattern. There\u2019s also the fact that the other dress is explicitly acknowledged to be inspired by Catelyn\u2019s Tully side. Additionally, given there is one Vale and Night\u2019s Watch influenced dress and one Tully influenced dress, this one is more influenced by the North in its details.</p><p>Still, Sansa\u2019s costumes often have dual quality, so I could see how the checkered pattern could be seen as fish scales. Perhaps, even the narrow diagonal lines on the side are partly influenced by <a href=\"https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F04%2FBrienne-kills-Stannis-Official-HBO.jpg&amp;c=sc&amp;w=736&amp;h=485\" target=\"_blank\">Brienne\u2019s armor</a> as well. Also considering Clapton seems to be focusing on Sansa\u2019s \u201ctight lacing\u201d, the lines could be seen as laces she is tying herself tighter with. </p><p><b>Dress #3: Fishes Swimming Pattern</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14cbcd219871be8e785120b10937e1a5/tumblr_inline_pkyndvRLky1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\"/></figure><p>Strangely, Sansa never wears this dress without a shoulder fur, even when she leaves her cloak in 7x05.

Hence this outfit also looks a bit more traditionally feminine.\u00a0</p><p>That said, since this costume does have a lot of lacing significance to \u201cbind\u201d herself, the lines do look like threads and they could be seen as nets too and the tight lacing of the belt and leather straps around her body also cut the fluid appearance of the fishes, giving the dress a dual quality of empowerment and entrapment.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1133057129091959aa124e0a38500d6d/tumblr_inline_pkyoiqwNwH1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\"/></figure><p>Some may have noticed how Sansa\u2019s movements in this dress without a cloak looked a bit stiff and awkward. It may have been intentional considering Clapton\u2019s theme with her character this season as pointed out in the last post. This tight lacing isn\u2019t meant to be comfortable. Additionally, in order to mask the side opening of the dress, she uses quilting with narrower strips of the same material so it\u2019s hard to tell apart one layer from the other.</p><p>Apart from this, Sansa wears her wide hard leather belt and straps around her body and loops her metallic necklace with the circle and needle around her borrowed from her Eyrie raven-like costume. These two elements seal the battle iconography ultimately, where one is an armor and the other is a weapon in the making.\u00a0The metal stands out against the rest of her rather close fitted costume, but it\u2019s also in response to the Doylist comparison being cued amongst Sansa, Dany and Cersei in how they\u2019re using jewellery.\u00a0</p><p>The use of armor isn\u2019t altogether new. She has been building her armor since Ned\u2019s death.

But it\u2019s not that she won\u2019t use some of it in the future by subverting it into her favour.\u00a0</p><p>According to Clapton Sansa does end up designing her second wedding dress paying respects to her family because it\u2019s about her goal to take back her family home.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cWhat struck me about Sansa\u2019s wedding gown is that (much like Margaery\u2019s second wedding gown) this one was wholly Sansa.

There\u2019s no beading here. While Sansa does pay respects to her family, this isn&rsquo;t a wedding she wants to be at either and it is essentially driven by her desire to avenge her family that Littlefinger manipulates her into doing by convincing her she would be weak otherwise. As we know, what follows is that dress being ripped apart by the \u201cwings\u201d\u00a0by Ramsay and she is abused further.\u00a0</p><p>So the phrase \u201cas if she was actually sewn or laced into her dress\u2014like there was no way in\u201d is in response to that and her abuse and exploitation by the Lannisters and Littlefinger and her betrayals by others as well. It results in her sewing every layer into the other so they can almost merge into one another - even when it is made to appear hardened.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t just want a shell as a protective layer, she tries to sew herself into the shell so it\u2019s impossible to remove.\u00a0</p><p>That kind of imagery sounds painful and quite tragic when you think of it. As powerful as this sounds in terms of her abusers, there\u2019s a vulnerability in Sansa not wanting anyone to touch her or break through her walls. She\u2019s afraid of believing in anyone and trusting them with her life completely again after being burned so many times.\u00a0</p><p>(to be continued&hellip;)</p><p><b>A/N: </b>In the next part, I will compare Sansa\u2019s textures with Cersei\u2019s and Dany\u2019s - including the significance of jewellery and perhaps in the one that follows, I\u2019ll go back to comparing the remaining parts of their silhouettes. I was going to include the former in this post but the new footage just came with a lot more material and I didn\u2019t want to make these posts too long since it hampers readability and it\u2019s asking a lot of people\u2019s attention span.\u00a0</p>",

It\u2019s not fine material like silks but it\u2019s still comfortable and is functional in keeping warm. It\u2019s also quilted and provided with a soft padding underneath and probably lined inside with wool.

The presence of armor is most pronounced by this dress because of its stark suppression of sexuality with the strips of Eyrie feathers covering the exposed section of her cleavage and going up to her neck, where she wears a high collar, and tapering down to her waist.</p><p>The strips the feathers are placed on are straight rather than curved and because of this reassembling from afar they could resemble scales and thus appear less gentle. In fact, the Tully armor has scales like this. Though the silhouette is completely different. \u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"560\" data-orig-height=\"373\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fab57adb3f003e54a0335f4c267cd69/tumblr_inline_pkynhtaHPc1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"560\" data-orig-height=\"373\"></figure><p>Additionally, the feathers in that dress evolve into shoulder tabs resembling Northern armor pieces or furs and the feathers surrounding the back come up in the Northern women collar piece. Instead of embroidery around it, the symbolic significance is sized down to the use of these feathers on it topped with metallic direwolves on its ends.\u00a0\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3915\" data-orig-height=\"2871\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/332781a8014aedda878d3123a3d5ee34/tumblr_inline_pkynwzx2il1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3915\" data-orig-height=\"2871\"></figure><p>What\u2019s also interesting about it is how it seems to be recycling patches from the previous dress such that the edges are rough as she places one top of the other like plates. It\u2019s not as finely done as her Eyrie dress. She also uses vertical lines to quilt the dress.\u00a0<br></p><p>Overall, the way it is refashioned its silhouette resembles the Night\u2019s Watch training armor. And of course, the brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch are known as \u201ccrows\u201d, who are quite closely related to ravens.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"4256\" data-orig-height=\"2832\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d4c84594cb2f24eb12a24cbe8bd1120/tumblr_inline_pkynijL4US1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4256\" data-orig-height=\"2832\"></figure><p>Thus, she\u2019s bringing all parts of her journey together. </p><p>Interestingly, unlike the Eyrie dress and the Night\u2019s Watch armor, Sansa\u2019s dress is grey, although it looks almost like black in poor lighting. This dress isn\u2019t for anyone\u2019s benefit like the Eyrie dress was. </p><p>Where the season 4 \u201craven dress\u201d was meant entice, her season 7 version of the Eyrie feathers is meant to shield her from the male gaze. It still sends a \u201cmessage\u201d nonetheless. Not only to keep those who want to violate her body away from her, but also in a way to appeal to a patriarchal society that she has more worth than just her body.\u00a0</p><p>Still there is a kind of juxtaposition between the structure of the dress as it has bird feathers, which follow Sansa\u2019s winged imagery through seasons, but the way it is arranged in straight lines it is a lot more constrained. She\u2019s confined in it as much as it acts as an armor. </p><p><b>Dress #2: Criss Cross Pattern</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5113\" data-orig-height=\"2516\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/882856369f5cd9e201448115176fe0a9/tumblr_inline_pkynd8NBCU1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5113\" data-orig-height=\"2516\"></figure><p>While it isn\u2019t obvious because of the poor lighting, not only does Sansa wear this with her cloak and furs but also she wears it in the scene where Jon gives the North to her in 7x02. The criss cross pattern isn\u2019t just a print but rather made from placing strips of different cloths on top of each other like patchwork. Thereby it\u2019s a lot more textured. When not wearing furs, she pairs it up with the Northern woman\u2019s collar with two metallic direwolves lined with raven feathers from her Eyrie dress.\u00a0\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"5120\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f294cb2cf192bed985074d0c6a067d83/tumblr_inline_pkynhc8Ux11u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"5120\"></figure><p>The pattern on the dress could be the central rhombus on the Northern leather armor with finer lines. Or it could also be a minimalist fish swimming vertically.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3840\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f549e48bb35e949d81792bdf2b64ccf5/tumblr_inline_pkynjua16w1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3840\"></figure><p>Considering the scene in 7x03 is where she\u2019s talking about layering the armors to protect the soldiers from the cold, it\u2019s most likely an armor pattern. There\u2019s also the fact that the other dress is explicitly acknowledged to be inspired by Catelyn\u2019s Tully side. Additionally, given there is one Vale and Night\u2019s Watch influenced dress and one Tully influenced dress, this one is more influenced by the North in its details.</p><p>Still, Sansa\u2019s costumes often have dual quality, so I could see how the checkered pattern could be seen as fish scales. Perhaps, even the narrow diagonal lines on the side are partly influenced by <a href=\"https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F04%2FBrienne-kills-Stannis-Official-HBO.jpg&amp;c=sc&amp;w=736&amp;h=485\" target=\"_blank\">Brienne\u2019s armor</a> as well. Also considering Clapton seems to be focusing on Sansa\u2019s \u201ctight lacing\u201d, the lines could be seen as laces she is tying herself tighter with. </p><p><b>Dress #3: Fishes Swimming Pattern</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14cbcd219871be8e785120b10937e1a5/tumblr_inline_pkyndvRLky1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\"></figure><p>Strangely, Sansa never wears this dress without a shoulder fur, even when she leaves her cloak in 7x05.

But it\u2019s so interesting when you boil something and manipulate it \u2013 I love doing that!</i></p><p>A number of people hypothesised that the pattern was the Bolton sigil but on close look, it does look like fishes swimming upstream and downstream, where their heads and tails are in white/light grey.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"5120\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/02ebfc7d8cd027d687ad5ad7aa5371d9/tumblr_inline_pkyngidDUp1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"5120\"></figure><p>It\u2019s worth noting that compared to the other two dresses, the use of line is a lot more fluid considering the they curve to form streamlined fish bodies and even the quilting uses narrower vertical lines. Hence this outfit also looks a bit more traditionally feminine.\u00a0</p><p>That said, since this costume does have a lot of lacing significance to \u201cbind\u201d herself, the lines do look like threads and they could be seen as nets too and the tight lacing of the belt and leather straps around her body also cut the fluid appearance of the fishes, giving the dress a dual quality of empowerment and entrapment.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1133057129091959aa124e0a38500d6d/tumblr_inline_pkyoiqwNwH1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\"></figure><p>Some may have noticed how Sansa\u2019s movements in this dress without a cloak looked a bit stiff and awkward. It may have been intentional considering Clapton\u2019s theme with her character this season as pointed out in the last post. This tight lacing isn\u2019t meant to be comfortable. Additionally, in order to mask the side opening of the dress, she uses quilting with narrower strips of the same material so it\u2019s hard to tell apart one layer from the other.</p><p>Apart from this, Sansa wears her wide hard leather belt and straps around her body and loops her metallic necklace with the circle and needle around her borrowed from her Eyrie raven-like costume. These two elements seal the battle iconography ultimately, where one is an armor and the other is a weapon in the making.\u00a0The metal stands out against the rest of her rather close fitted costume, but it\u2019s also in response to the Doylist comparison being cued amongst Sansa, Dany and Cersei in how they\u2019re using jewellery.\u00a0</p><p>The use of armor isn\u2019t altogether new.

There\u2019s no beading here. While Sansa does pay respects to her family, this isn\u2019t a wedding she wants to be at either and it is essentially driven by her desire to avenge her family that Littlefinger manipulates her into doing by convincing her she would be weak otherwise. As we know, what follows is that dress being ripped apart by the \u201cwings\u201d\u00a0by Ramsay and she is abused further.\u00a0</p><p>So the phrase \u201cas if she was actually sewn or laced into her dress\u2014like there was no way in\u201d is in response to that and her abuse and exploitation by the Lannisters and Littlefinger and her betrayals by others as well. It results in her sewing every layer into the other so they can almost merge into one another - even when it is made to appear hardened.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t just want a shell as a protective layer, she tries to sew herself into the shell so it\u2019s impossible to remove.\u00a0</p><p>That kind of imagery sounds painful and quite tragic when you think of it. As powerful as this sounds in terms of her abusers, there\u2019s a vulnerability in Sansa not wanting anyone to touch her or break through her walls. She\u2019s afraid of believing in anyone and trusting them with her life completely again after being burned so many times.\u00a0</p><p>(to be continued\u2026)</p><p><b>A/N: </b>In the next part, I will compare Sansa\u2019s textures with Cersei\u2019s and Dany\u2019s - including the significance of jewellery and perhaps in the one that follows, I\u2019ll go back to comparing the remaining parts of their silhouettes. I was going to include the former in this post but the new footage just came with a lot more material and I didn\u2019t want to make these posts too long since it hampers readability and it\u2019s asking a lot of people\u2019s attention span.\u00a0</p>",

This dress isn\u2019t for anyone\u2019s benefit like the Eyrie dress was. </p><p>Where the season 4 \u201craven dress\u201d was meant entice, her season 7 version of the Eyrie feathers is meant to shield her from the male gaze. It still sends a \u201cmessage\u201d nonetheless. Not only to keep those who want to violate her body away from her, but also in a way to appeal to a patriarchal society that she has more worth than just her body.\u00a0</p><p>Still there is a kind of juxtaposition between the structure of the dress as it has bird feathers, which follow Sansa\u2019s winged imagery through seasons, but the way it is arranged in straight lines it is a lot more constrained. She\u2019s confined in it as much as it acts as an armor. </p><p><b>Dress #2: Criss Cross Pattern</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5113\" data-orig-height=\"2516\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/882856369f5cd9e201448115176fe0a9/tumblr_inline_pkynd8NBCU1u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5113\" data-orig-height=\"2516\"></figure><p>While it isn\u2019t obvious because of the poor lighting, not only does Sansa wear this with her cloak and furs but also she wears it in the scene where Jon gives the North to her in 7x02. The criss cross pattern isn\u2019t just a print but rather made from placing strips of different cloths on top of each other like patchwork. Thereby it\u2019s a lot more textured. When not wearing furs, she pairs it up with the Northern woman\u2019s collar with two metallic direwolves lined with raven feathers from her Eyrie dress.\u00a0\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"5120\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f294cb2cf192bed985074d0c6a067d83/tumblr_inline_pkynhc8Ux11u48vsz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"5120\"></figure><p>The pattern on the dress could be the central rhombus on the Northern leather armor with finer lines.

There\u2019s also the fact that the other dress is explicitly acknowledged to be inspired by Catelyn\u2019s Tully side. Additionally, given there is one Vale and Night\u2019s Watch influenced dress and one Tully influenced dress, this one is more influenced by the North in its details.</p><p>Still, Sansa\u2019s costumes often have dual quality, so I could see how the checkered pattern could be seen as fish scales. Perhaps, even the narrow diagonal lines on the side are partly influenced by <a href=\"https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F04%2FBrienne-kills-Stannis-Official-HBO.jpg&amp;c=sc&amp;w=736&amp;h=485\" target=\"_blank\">Brienne\u2019s armor</a> as well.

It may have been intentional considering Clapton\u2019s theme with her character this season as pointed out in the last post. This tight lacing isn\u2019t meant to be comfortable. Additionally, in order to mask the side opening of the dress, she uses quilting with narrower strips of the same material so it\u2019s hard to tell apart one layer from the other.</p><p>Apart from this, Sansa wears her wide hard leather belt and straps around her body and loops her metallic necklace with the circle and needle around her borrowed from her Eyrie raven-like costume. These two elements seal the battle iconography ultimately, where one is an armor and the other is a weapon in the making.\u00a0The metal stands out against the rest of her rather close fitted costume, but it\u2019s also in response to the Doylist comparison being cued amongst Sansa, Dany and Cersei in how they\u2019re using jewellery.\u00a0</p><p>The use of armor isn\u2019t altogether new.

There\u2019s no beading here. While Sansa does pay respects to her family, this isn\u2019t a wedding she wants to be at either and it is essentially driven by her desire to avenge her family that Littlefinger manipulates her into doing by convincing her she would be weak otherwise. As we know, what follows is that dress being ripped apart by the \u201cwings\u201d\u00a0by Ramsay and she is abused further.\u00a0</p><p>So the phrase \u201cas if she was actually sewn or laced into her dress\u2014like there was no way in\u201d is in response to that and her abuse and exploitation by the Lannisters and Littlefinger and her betrayals by others as well. It results in her sewing every layer into the other so they can almost merge into one another - even when it is made to appear hardened.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t just want a shell as a protective layer, she tries to sew herself into the shell so it\u2019s impossible to remove.\u00a0</p><p>That kind of imagery sounds painful and quite tragic when you think of it. As powerful as this sounds in terms of her abusers, there\u2019s a vulnerability in Sansa not wanting anyone to touch her or break through her walls. She\u2019s afraid of believing in anyone and trusting them with her life completely again after being burned so many times.\u00a0</p><p>(to be continued\u2026)</p><p><b>A/N: </b>In the next part, I will compare Sansa\u2019s textures with Cersei\u2019s and Dany\u2019s - including the significance of jewellery and perhaps in the one that follows, I\u2019ll go back to comparing the remaining parts of their silhouettes. I was going to include the former in this post but the new footage just came with a lot more material and I didn\u2019t want to make these posts too long since it hampers readability and it\u2019s asking a lot of people\u2019s attention span.\u00a0</p>",

The presence of armor is most pronounced by this dress because of its stark suppression of sexuality with the strips of Eyrie feathers covering the exposed section of her cleavage and going up to her neck, where she wears a high collar, and tapering down to her waist.</p><p>The strips the feathers are placed on are straight rather than curved and because of this reassembling from afar they could resemble scales and thus appear less gentle. In fact, the Tully armor has scales like this. Though the silhouette is completely different. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fab57adb3f003e54a0335f4c267cd69/tumblr_inline_pkynhtaHPc1u48vsz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Additionally, the feathers in that dress evolve into shoulder tabs resembling Northern armor pieces or furs and the feathers surrounding the back come up in the Northern women collar piece. Instead of embroidery around it, the symbolic significance is sized down to the use of these feathers on it topped with metallic direwolves on its ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/332781a8014aedda878d3123a3d5ee34/tumblr_inline_pkynwzx2il1u48vsz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>What&rsquo;s also interesting about it is how it seems to be recycling patches from the previous dress such that the edges are rough as she places one top of the other like plates. It&rsquo;s not as finely done as her Eyrie dress. She also uses vertical lines to quilt the dress.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Overall, the way it is refashioned its silhouette resembles the Night&rsquo;s Watch training armor. And of course, the brothers of the Night&rsquo;s Watch are known as &ldquo;crows&rdquo;, who are quite closely related to ravens.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d4c84594cb2f24eb12a24cbe8bd1120/tumblr_inline_pkynijL4US1u48vsz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Thus, she&rsquo;s bringing all parts of her journey together. </p><p>Interestingly, unlike the Eyrie dress and the Night&rsquo;s Watch armor, Sansa&rsquo;s dress is grey, although it looks almost like black in poor lighting. This dress isn&rsquo;t for anyone&rsquo;s benefit like the Eyrie dress was. </p><p>Where the season 4 &ldquo;raven dress&rdquo; was meant entice, her season 7 version of the Eyrie feathers is meant to shield her from the male gaze. It still sends a &ldquo;message&rdquo; nonetheless. Not only to keep those who want to violate her body away from her, but also in a way to appeal to a patriarchal society that she has more worth than just her body.&nbsp;</p><p>Still there is a kind of juxtaposition between the structure of the dress as it has bird feathers, which follow Sansa&rsquo;s winged imagery through seasons, but the way it is arranged in straight lines it is a lot more constrained. She&rsquo;s confined in it as much as it acts as an armor. </p><p><b>Dress #2: Criss Cross Pattern</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/882856369f5cd9e201448115176fe0a9/tumblr_inline_pkynd8NBCU1u48vsz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>While it isn&rsquo;t obvious because of the poor lighting, not only does Sansa wear this with her cloak and furs but also she wears it in the scene where Jon gives the North to her in 7x02. The criss cross pattern isn&rsquo;t just a print but rather made from placing strips of different cloths on top of each other like patchwork. Thereby it&rsquo;s a lot more textured. When not wearing furs, she pairs it up with the Northern woman&rsquo;s collar with two metallic direwolves lined with raven feathers from her Eyrie dress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f294cb2cf192bed985074d0c6a067d83/tumblr_inline_pkynhc8Ux11u48vsz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The pattern on the dress could be the central rhombus on the Northern leather armor with finer lines. Or it could also be a minimalist fish swimming vertically.&nbsp;<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f549e48bb35e949d81792bdf2b64ccf5/tumblr_inline_pkynjua16w1u48vsz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Considering the scene in 7x03 is where she&rsquo;s talking about layering the armors to protect the soldiers from the cold, it&rsquo;s most likely an armor pattern. There&rsquo;s also the fact that the other dress is explicitly acknowledged to be inspired by Catelyn&rsquo;s Tully side. Additionally, given there is one Vale and Night&rsquo;s Watch influenced dress and one Tully influenced dress, this one is more influenced by the North in its details.</p><p>Still, Sansa&rsquo;s costumes often have dual quality, so I could see how the checkered pattern could be seen as fish scales. Perhaps, even the narrow diagonal lines on the side are partly influenced by <a href=\"https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F04%2FBrienne-kills-Stannis-Official-HBO.jpg&amp;c=sc&amp;w=736&amp;h=485\" target=\"_blank\">Brienne&rsquo;s armor</a> as well. Also considering Clapton seems to be focusing on Sansa&rsquo;s &ldquo;tight lacing&rdquo;, the lines could be seen as laces she is tying herself tighter with. </p><p><b>Dress #3: Fishes Swimming Pattern</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14cbcd219871be8e785120b10937e1a5/tumblr_inline_pkyndvRLky1u48vsz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Strangely, Sansa never wears this dress without a shoulder fur, even when she leaves her cloak in 7x05. However, the dress without with its furs <a href=\"https://blog.fidmmuseum.org/museum/2018/09/interview-with-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html\" target=\"_blank\">has been displayed at the FIDM Museum</a>. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/28543af70b25b3b2eee3fae0c6787551/tumblr_inline_pkynexTZez1u48vsz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Interviewer: Is Sansa&rsquo;s fabric one of the furnishing fabrics?</i></p><p><i>Clapton: I think it is &ndash; it might be the reverse side.<b> I thought it looked like fishes swimming. </b>I think we worked into it a bit &ndash; it&rsquo;s beautiful.

But it&rsquo;s so interesting when you boil something and manipulate it &ndash; I love doing that!</i></p><p>A number of people hypothesised that the pattern was the Bolton sigil but on close look, it does look like fishes swimming upstream and downstream, where their heads and tails are in white/light grey.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/02ebfc7d8cd027d687ad5ad7aa5371d9/tumblr_inline_pkyngidDUp1u48vsz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that compared to the other two dresses, the use of line is a lot more fluid considering the they curve to form streamlined fish bodies and even the quilting uses narrower vertical lines. Hence this outfit also looks a bit more traditionally feminine.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, since this costume does have a lot of lacing significance to &ldquo;bind&rdquo; herself, the lines do look like threads and they could be seen as nets too and the tight lacing of the belt and leather straps around her body also cut the fluid appearance of the fishes, giving the dress a dual quality of empowerment and entrapment.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1133057129091959aa124e0a38500d6d/tumblr_inline_pkyoiqwNwH1u48vsz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Some may have noticed how Sansa&rsquo;s movements in this dress without a cloak looked a bit stiff and awkward. It may have been intentional considering Clapton&rsquo;s theme with her character this season as pointed out in the last post. This tight lacing isn&rsquo;t meant to be comfortable. Additionally, in order to mask the side opening of the dress, she uses quilting with narrower strips of the same material so it&rsquo;s hard to tell apart one layer from the other.</p><p>Apart from this, Sansa wears her wide hard leather belt and straps around her body and loops her metallic necklace with the circle and needle around her borrowed from her Eyrie raven-like costume. These two elements seal the battle iconography ultimately, where one is an armor and the other is a weapon in the making.&nbsp;The metal stands out against the rest of her rather close fitted costume, but it&rsquo;s also in response to the Doylist comparison being cued amongst Sansa, Dany and Cersei in how they&rsquo;re using jewellery.&nbsp;</p><p>The use of armor isn&rsquo;t altogether new. She has been building her armor since Ned&rsquo;s death. It prominently features in her two wedding dresses.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c25516197aa763bc4efa4d7c1a7bd135/tumblr_inline_pkynk2Al101u48vsz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The rigidity of the shape is quite telling of her state and mindset.

The additional appendage with embroidery around it is like Lyanna&rsquo;s metallic brace at her wedding to Rhaegar.&nbsp;But there is more to it as Sansa&rsquo;s season 3 wedding dress is not made by her but rather the Lannisters.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Obviously we imagined that the wedding dress has been commissioned by Cersei and the Lannisters for Sansa, and so <b>the embroidery would have come from Cersei&rsquo;s mind</b>. We guessed that it wouldn&rsquo;t be romantic or lovely and girly and pretty with dainty flowers, but a <b>real strong message of dominance, saying that we own you now, Sansa</b></i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Wedding days should be a joyous event for the bride, but, unfortunately, Sansa&rsquo;s being forced into a marriage that she doesn&rsquo;t want, into the Lannister family. For this dress, Michelle wanted it to be a <b>confined</b>, <b>restricted bodice shape</b> with <b>bare, vulnerable arms</b>. She wanted an <b>embroidered band that would wrap around the bodice and tell Sansa&rsquo;s life story</b>.</i>&rdquo; - <a href=\"https://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2014/04/04/36776/game-of-thrones-the-woman-behind-the-costumes-intr/\" target=\"_blank\">Michele Carragher to SCPR</a></p><p>So if it looks like an armor, it&rsquo;s still her being forced into it and it is another form of abuse in its own way. It&rsquo;s a cage. But it&rsquo;s not that she won&rsquo;t use some of it in the future by subverting it into her favour.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Clapton Sansa does end up designing her second wedding dress paying respects to her family because it&rsquo;s about her goal to take back her family home.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;What struck me about Sansa&rsquo;s wedding gown is that (much like Margaery&rsquo;s second wedding gown) this one was wholly Sansa. Clapton says that was deliberate. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sansa trying to respect everyone that&rsquo;s been before her<b>. She finally feels like she can make Winterfell a family home again.</b> So I wanted to incorporate pieces that represented her family.&rdquo; <b> There&rsquo;s the animal fur of the wolf that also recalls the furs we saw Ned and Robb</b> sport in earlier seasons. There&rsquo;s <b>the shape of the dress, which is very northern</b>, and one her <b>mother wore frequently</b>.

There&rsquo;s no beading here. While Sansa does pay respects to her family, this isn&rsquo;t a wedding she wants to be at either and it is essentially driven by her desire to avenge her family that Littlefinger manipulates her into doing by convincing her she would be weak otherwise. As we know, what follows is that dress being ripped apart by the &ldquo;wings&rdquo;&nbsp;by Ramsay and she is abused further.&nbsp;</p><p>So the phrase &ldquo;as if she was actually sewn or laced into her dress&mdash;like there was no way in&rdquo; is in response to that and her abuse and exploitation by the Lannisters and Littlefinger and her betrayals by others as well. It results in her sewing every layer into the other so they can almost merge into one another - even when it is made to appear hardened.&nbsp;She doesn&rsquo;t just want a shell as a protective layer, she tries to sew herself into the shell so it&rsquo;s impossible to remove.&nbsp;</p><p>That kind of imagery sounds painful and quite tragic when you think of it. As powerful as this sounds in terms of her abusers, there&rsquo;s a vulnerability in Sansa not wanting anyone to touch her or break through her walls. She&rsquo;s afraid of believing in anyone and trusting them with her life completely again after being burned so many times.&nbsp;</p><p>(to be continued&hellip;)</p><p><b>A/N: </b>In the next part, I will compare Sansa&rsquo;s textures with Cersei&rsquo;s and Dany&rsquo;s - including the significance of jewellery and perhaps in the one that follows, I&rsquo;ll go back to comparing the remaining parts of their silhouettes. I was going to include the former in this post but the new footage just came with a lot more material and I didn&rsquo;t want to make these posts too long since it hampers readability and it&rsquo;s asking a lot of people&rsquo;s attention span.&nbsp;</p>",
