Mental Illness may make you think you are alone at the time but you aren\u2019t, it is designed to trip you up. Find a support system, keep those poeple close and let them know all your illnesses and be upfront with them about it. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell them you can\u2019t hangout today because today is a bad depression day, or you can\u2019t go outside today because you\u2019re too anxious. If they\u2019re good people they will understand and work with you. Those who choose not to understand mental illness are ignorant and selfish people. They\u2019re also incredibly weak because we go through something so hard everyday that no one can see. It\u2019s hard but again&hellip; you\u2019re not alone. Try and stay present, love and welcome the little moments because to me those mean so much more. Find things to do that you love, I call that self care shit, and take care of yourself. Your mind is a temple just as much as your body is and if you don\u2019t protect them or guard them then it will be harder to work toward anything. Keep your head up and reach out to others whom you think are struggling. Mental illness is no joke homies but if you\u2019ve got a good support group, a positive mindset, and a fighting spirit you can make it through it.</p><p>Much love today mental illness warriors. &lt;3</p>",
