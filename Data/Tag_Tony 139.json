It might not seem that way, but I am.\u201d Tony took\na deep breath and looked at Steve before his gaze darted away once more. \u201cThis\nis me happy. I know what I\u2019m doing. I know what I\u2019m doing here right now and I\nknow what I want to do in the future. Everything\u2019s always been the same and my\nlife plan has always been figured out. And then you came along. You with your\nfancy art degree and your friends that suddenly became my friends and your\nstupid muscles and your even more stupid smile.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s brow furrowed even more. He wasn\u2019t quite sure what\nTony was getting at. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but what? Tony, what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Tony all but yelled, his voice deafening in\nthe room and causing Steve to jump. \u201cRhodey has been on at me for ages to talk\nto you, but I don\u2019t know what I want. It\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t, I\u2019m not sure\u2026 I just, I\nlike you, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth snapped shut and his head tilted to one side as\nhe squinted at Steve. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Steve said, his eyes on Tony\u2019s as he kept\nhimself as still as he could. \u201cBecause I like you too.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause before Tony swallowed almost audibly,\nhis tongue poking out to lick his lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What?\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled ever so slightly, but didn\u2019t say anything else,\ninstead waiting for Tony to work it out. The young man was extremely clever\nwhen it came to science, robotics and math, but not so much when it came to real-life\nhumans.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Steve nodded and leant forward ever so slightly, shuffling\nto the edge of the couch. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t have to go anywhere,\u201d he promised softly.\nThe words came easily, nothing but the truth. \u201cI\u2019ve liked you for a long time\nand I\u2019ve had a lot of time to think things through. Honestly I\u2019d be okay with\nnothing changing. The knowledge that you like me back is enough for now. Enough\nfor always, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked again, staring in disbelief. </p><p>Steve bit down on his smile as he stood up slowly. \u201cNothing\nhas to change, Tony. <i>You</i> don\u2019t have\nto change.\u201d</p><p>Tony shook his head, but made no effort to step backwards as\nSteve moved closer. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Steve said sweetly, honestly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want\nyou to be any different. I would never ask you to be. You\u2019re wonderful the way\nthat you are.\u201d </p><p>There was a lot more that Steve wanted to say, though he\nmanaged to hold them back. It wasn\u2019t the right time and Tony was already\nfinding it hard enough to get his head around what was happening, judging by\nhis wide eyes and parted lips. </p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d Tony said, tongue darting out again. \u201cI do.\nBut I just don\u2019t think I can\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts,\u201d Steve interrupted. \u201cNot right now.

You.&rdquo; Tony pressed his lips together for a second, the\nanguish clear on his face. Steve stayed patiently silent as he waited for Tony\nto continue. &ldquo;I&hellip; It&rsquo;s. Oh, god. I just&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, Tones. Slow down.&rdquo; Steve set his book down to one\nside hurriedly and held up his hands placatingly when he sensed Tony working\nhimself up into a panic. </p><p>He&rsquo;d been having a few more dealings with a panicking Tony\nrecently and, though he didn&rsquo;t like having to do it, Steve was getting good at\ncalming him down. A couple of the best and time-proven ways were to cut Tony\noff when he started to ramble or to just stay quiet, but to be there as a\ncalming presence.</p><p>In a subconscious effort to make himself less threatening,\nSteve pressed himself further back into the couch. Tony was already standing\nwhilst Steve was sitting, but every little extra thing helped.&nbsp;Despite\nbeing midway through a PhD, Tony was still very young and inexperienced and\nSteve felt a strong wave of protection come over him whenever he was around the\nyounger man. All of their friends did, really, and it freaked Tony out.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do people,&rdquo; Tony said after a long pause, his words\ncoming out in a rush, spilling into one long jumble. His eyes were fixed steadfastly\non the wall behind Steve&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do friends and I certainly don&rsquo;t do\nrelationships.

Alongside her brother, Howard, they build a whole world of technology and science for themselves.</p><p>Up until a fatal night in 1947.</p><p>She was announced dead in 1949.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Toni wasn\u2019t going anywhere with him as long as she had anything to do about it.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to do this the easier way, but the best ones do put up the best fight at first, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>It was the last thing she remembered before darkness overtook her.</p><hr><p><b>Chapter Six: Save Me\nFrom Myself</b></p><p><i>Early 1990\u2019s, The Red Room</i></p><p>The\nyoung girls dashed across the dimly lit room in hopes of keeping to the music\nthat played loudly. While the melody was soothing, it appeared that the girls\nwere anything but. Many faces were twisted in pain. It was expected, they had\nbeen dancing for hours. Yet only one girl, hair fire engine red, kept her face\nimpassive, not willing -or unable- to feel anything. Her movements were cold\nand left The Winter Flower feeling like it was watching ice claim warm waters. Despite\nthat it was intrigued by the young girl.</p><p>\u201cFaster.\u201d\nMadame B\u2019s voice rang through the room and with one word the whole room spurred\nto a faster speed in order to survive. One of the girls, a blonde, was\nbreathing hard and unable to keep up with the others\u2019 speed. A sliver of pity ignited\nin The Winter Flower. </p><p>The ballet\nwas as beautiful as a dead body bleeding out in the middle of winter. It made The\nWinter Flower want to flee, but that would ensure a punishment. Unfortunately, in\nHydra lending it to the KGB the deal never contained in what condition it were\nto be returned to her handlers, only that it were to be alive. </p><p>Suddenly\nthe blonde crashed. No-one stopped. They were very well aware of what were to\nhappen if they did. Madame B clicked her tongue and it was moving. Few long\nstrides and it had the girl supported up by her armpit. \u201cDispose her.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>With\na nod it left the room. The young girl was trashing in its hold. \u201cPlease!\nPlease don\u2019t!\u201d The blond yelled in despair, \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be better!\u201d\nDisappointment and disgust arose in it as the blond girl started screeching and\ncrying. Wasn\u2019t it enough it had to do this? Did she have to struggle too?</p><p>Heaving\na sigh, it tossed the blonde inside the room. She stumbled and landed on the\nfloor in a starfish like position. The Winter Flower barely held back its\nsnort. It was amusing how <i>weak</i> some\nof these girls were despite growing up in The Red Room. It knew now wasn\u2019t a\ntime to play games and honestly, it didn\u2019t even want to. Taking out the 9mm\npistol it always carried, it weighted the gun in its hands before firing a single\nshot. It rang through the small lightless room. For good measure it shot the\ngirl again to make sure she wouldn\u2019t get up and live. Disobeying was bad\nenough, but to actually fail to complete what it was asked to do? Madame B\nwould single handedly murder it, if its handlers wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Just\nto make sure she was really dead, it held its fingers by the blond\u2019s pulse\npoint. When it didn\u2019t find anything, it headed for the door, only to stop short\nat the sight of the red headed girl. Her head was tilted curiously. \u201c<i>Why did you kill her?</i>\u201d the girl, not\nolder than 15, asked. Her Russian was pronounced without care, but it was her curiosity\nthat puzzled The Winter Flower.</p><p>\u201c<i>You know why.</i>\u201d It drawled back. The red\nhead\u2019s face betrayed no emotion, though her eyes seemed to flash with\nirritation, long enough for it to detect.</p><p>\u201c<i>No, I know why she had to die. What I\u2019m\nasking is why did</i> you<i> kill her?</i>\u201d The\nWinter Flower paused. The question seemed to confuse it. Did it not have to\nkill the blond girl? Did it mistake Madame B\u2019s orders?</p><p>\u201c<i>I don\u2019t understand</i>,\u201d it replied,\nconfusion and panic seeping into its voice.</p><p>\u201c<i>I guessed you wouldn\u2019t</i>.\u201d And that was\nit.</p><p>As\nyears passed inside The Red Room and the red head, Natalia progressed without\nproblem, both The Winter Flower and Natalia grew closer. Never could it answer\nher question and never did Natalia ask again.</p><p>As the\ncentury was drawing to a close, The Winter Flower was returned to Hydra.</p><p>It\nnever saw Natalia again, and on the rare occasion it remembered the calculating\nred head a terrible feeling of loss overtook it, making it wish Natalia\nRomanova was alright, where ever she might be.</p><p>* * *</p><p><i>1998, NYC, America</i></p><p>A puff of cold air sprung free from the man\u2019s lungs as he\nmoved through Central Park, occasionally hiding in the shadows. It had been a\nfew years since his escape, but he still couldn\u2019t shake the feeling he was\nwatched and followed every time he so much as stepped outside. He supposed it\nwas quite possible, with all the traffic cameras surrounding almost every\ncorner you could turn. New York City was a bad place to hide, but he knew that\nwould also make his captors less likely to look there.</p><p>He was moving towards the building where his old buddy was\ncurrently living in. Though he had no recollection of what had happened between\nthem in the past, he knew they were close by the small memory snippets that had\nappeared over time. In those memories, as hazy as they were, he had been a\nconstant.</p><p>As soon as it had come to his attention about two and a half\nyears ago, he had felt something shift. His mind was all jumbled, but he hoped\nhe could get help through his old best friend. He hoped they would find what\nthey once had. He also wished to help the woman in his dreams. He couldn\u2019t\nquite identify who she was, only a name whispered in a night of comfort and\nlove came to his mind.</p><p><i>Natasha</i>.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know was this woman alive still, but his dreams\nhad conjured up her in the goddamn awful Chair. It would make him lose his mind\ncompletely as he slipped into The Winter Soldier mode, as he\u2019d take to calling\nit. Sometimes -though it was lessening as he became more lucid- he would slip\ninto that mode, waking up days later not knowing who he\u2019d hurt or what had\nhappened. It was a hellish nightmare.</p><p>So that was why he was here, standing in front of the SHIELD\napartment where Steve Rogers lived in. He hoped Steve really was here and not\non some SHIELD mission. As quick as that thought came, a clear picture of a\nskinny blonde boy arguing with him about going to war appeared. James barely\nheld back his gasp at the pain that followed. Suddenly it seemed like a bad\nidea to even be in the vicinity of him. That doubt disappeared immediately as\nhe realized this was the clearest memory he has had in years. </p><p>Falling back on old training, James slipped into the\nbuilding, keeping his ears and eyes carefully open. His watchful eyes flickered\nback and forth on ever single detail he could get. The lobby was painted a\nwashed-out light blue. It wasn\u2019t as in-your-face as one would expect. The bland\nand colourless deco complimented the bright walls nicely. And while there was a\nbunch of sofas and chairs in one of the corners, they seemed a bit dusty like\nno-one had sat there in a while. Suspicion flared and James\u2019 hand slipped into\nhis pocket to grab the trusty knife he\u2019d had for years, if not decades. He\nstrained his ears, hoping to hear something. When nothing was there to be\nheard, he continued towards the lift. </p><p>His left metallic hand hovered over the call button. Quickly\ndeciding that the stairs were safer, incase of ambush, he headed to the other\nside of the room towards the stairwell. His neck prickled at the silence. It\nwas unnerving. Silent as a ghost, he trudged up the stairs. </p><p>Steve\u2019s apartment was on the third floor. The second floor\nwould not be a place where he would linger for long. Despite being silent, he\nmoved as quick as lightning. On the right side of the stairs was three doors.\nThe silent and empty corridor had hairs on his arms standing up. He quickly\nstalked towards the doors. The door on the right and closest to the stairs had\nlight music coming from inside. The door on the left remained silent. And the middle\ndoor, Steve\u2019s door, was silent as well.</p><p>Knowing the dangers of knocking on his door, James quietly\nslipped out his knife, taking out the hair pin that was hidden in the handle.\nAs quiet as possible, he slowly started to feel out the lock. In seconds he had\nthe door unlocked. By now he was quite sure Steve knew that someone was\nbreaking into his apartment.</p><p>The door opened with a slight screech that made James\ngrimace. He could hear deep concentrated breathing, he could hear Steve.\nCursing his stupidity of coming here when he was home. He stepped inside and\nlike he expected, the shield was flying towards him. He quickly turned to the\nside, his hair slapping into his face, and grabbed the shield with his metallic\narm. The clank rang through the apartment and corridor. He grinned at Steve and\ncould hear how he stopped breathing.</p><p><i>\u201cBucky?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cGuess, I should\u2019ve knocked.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Hours and many explanations later, Steve was still staring\nat James like he was seeing a ghost. He supposed he was one. All Steve had\nknown was that he had died in the Alps in the forties. It was quite sad to see\nSteve reaching for Bucky, when all he could give him was James. He understood\nit. For Steve it had been only a couple of years, but for him it had been more\nthan 50 years. James knew he understood that there was no more of \u2018Bucky\u2019, but\nhad a hard time realizing what it actually meant.</p><p>\u201cI-uh,\u201d Steve stumbled over his words in the living room they\nwere sitting in. James turned towards him, his question clear in his eyes. Steve\u2019s\neyes suddenly glinted with unshed tears and he seemed to choke on his words. It\nregarded James with surprise. He had never seen his best friend so pained. \u201cThey\ntold me-\u201d Steve\u2019s tears flowed down his cheeks and the ragged breath he took in\nmade James almost flinch.</p><p>Quickly, he scampered up from his seat across from Steve and\ntook the shivering man into his arms. \u201cI thought I had lost you, too!\u201d Steve\nsuddenly cried out, and this time he flinched from the loudness by his ear. Nevertheless,\nhe didn\u2019t take his arms away from the hug as the blonde clinged to him. After\nwhat felt like hours, Steve lessened his deathly grip on James and dragged his\nsleeves across his face. He muttered an, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d before he released him\ncompletely.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you sorry for, you punk?\u201d James asked him\nin a quite murmur. Steve\u2019s eyes grew unfocused for a moment, before he smiled at\nhis old friend.</p><p>\u201cFor breaking apart like that. I just- ah, remembered\nsomething I found out.\u201d Steve smiled a self-decrepitating smile. It soon turned\ninto a grimace.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna tell me what it was?\u201d James asked carefully,\nstepping back to stare at his friend. The blonde\u2019s face went through a bath of\nemotions, before settling on a horribly broken look.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ah, it\u2019s about Natasha.\u201d Steve finally said, although\nvery carefully. The name launched an assault of images of cold nights with soft\nvoices and naked bodies, of gruesome murders and painful punishments, the image\nof screaming, hot and pain- Like doused with cold water, James\u2019 head arose from\nthe assault.</p><p>After a while of calming himself down and placing a\ncarefully constructed mask of curiosity, he asked, \u201cNatasha who?\u201d Steve\u2019s eyes\ngrew stormy and his eyebrows pinched together, like he was disappointed that James\nwouldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cMy Natasha. Stark? Natasha Antonia Stark?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice\nwas wavering, and he felt worried the blonde would burst into another set of\ntears. God, Steve\u2019s girlfriend, James suddenly remembered with clarity. She\nmust be in her seventies.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d James breathed out. \u201cI remember her. Is she alright?\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes glistened again, and his jaw clenched so tight\nJames could hear the screech of his teeth. \u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d The simple statement\nmade it feel like someone had punched him in the gut. He couldn\u2019t imagine- oh,\nSteve. \u201cS-She died in 1949. L-lab accident, a building collapsed on her and her\nteam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d James breathed out. \u201cGod, that\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-Not only did she have to deal with me being gone and the\naftermath of the war, she hadn\u2019t even lived to 25, B-James.\u201d James felt his\nbreathing catch in his throat, and he had to swallow multiple times to rid of\nthe lump in his throat. \u00a0\u201cOh, Howard must\u2019ve\nbeen so broken. He l-loved her so much. How couldn\u2019t anyone love that woman?\u201d</p><p>Howard Stark, Maria Stark, 1991, December 16<sup>th</sup>, dispose\nof Howard, retrieve the serum, kill possible witnesses. <i>\u201c\u2026Winter Soldier Program reactivated\u2026\u201d</i> James hissed at the pain. He\ncouldn\u2019t help but fall to his knees on the hardwood floor. Everything around\nhim went dark for a second, before he startled with a gasp. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky?\u201d Steve asked tentatively. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Steve,\u201d he gasped out. \u201cOh, God. I killed him!\u201d</p><p>A thunderous expression overtook Steve\u2019s features as he\ngrabbed James\u2019 hands. He pulled them away from the painful grip they had on his\nhair. \u201cJames.\u201d The stern voice froze him completely. The only telltale sign of\nhis panic was the harsh breathing. \u201cYou might\u2019ve delivered the death sentence,\nbut it wasn\u2019t your choice. You were only protecting yourself, no-one would\nexpect anything less. <i>It wasn\u2019t you</i>.\u201d</p><p>Oh, how he wanted to believe Steve\u2019s precious words. \u201cBut I\nstill did <i>it</i>,\u201d James hissed as he\nwrenched himself free and retreated to a corner. Steve continued his thunderous\ngaze on him, but an understanding dawned upon him. He could understand why\nJames felt the way he did.</p><p>It could be compared to what Steve had to go through when he\ngot soldiers killed on the field. He didn\u2019t do all he could. His careful\nplanning only went so far. But for James it was so much worse. It wasn\u2019t his\nordering of troops that got them killed, but his very own hands, controlled by\nthe hands of others.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I came here,\u201d James informed him after minutes of\nsilent glaring. \u201cI need help. Professional help. But not from SHIELD.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust them.\u201d James opted for.</p><p>\u201cWell, do you trust me?\u201d Steve asked him. Did he <i>trust</i> him? No, James didn\u2019t trust him.\nIt didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he answered truthfully. After a beat he\nadded, \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s smile was slightly bitter.</p>",

While the melody was soothing, it appeared that the girls\nwere anything but. Many faces were twisted in pain. It was expected, they had\nbeen dancing for hours. Yet only one girl, hair fire engine red, kept her face\nimpassive, not willing -or unable- to feel anything. Her movements were cold\nand left The Winter Flower feeling like it was watching ice claim warm waters. Despite\nthat it was intrigued by the young girl.</p><p>\u201cFaster.\u201d\nMadame B\u2019s voice rang through the room and with one word the whole room spurred\nto a faster speed in order to survive. One of the girls, a blonde, was\nbreathing hard and unable to keep up with the others\u2019 speed. A sliver of pity ignited\nin The Winter Flower. </p><p>The ballet\nwas as beautiful as a dead body bleeding out in the middle of winter. It made The\nWinter Flower want to flee, but that would ensure a punishment. Unfortunately, in\nHydra lending it to the KGB the deal never contained in what condition it were\nto be returned to her handlers, only that it were to be alive. </p><p>Suddenly\nthe blonde crashed. No-one stopped. They were very well aware of what were to\nhappen if they did. Madame B clicked her tongue and it was moving. Few long\nstrides and it had the girl supported up by her armpit. \u201cDispose her.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>With\na nod it left the room. The young girl was trashing in its hold. \u201cPlease!\nPlease don\u2019t!\u201d The blond yelled in despair, \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be better!\u201d\nDisappointment and disgust arose in it as the blond girl started screeching and\ncrying. Wasn\u2019t it enough it had to do this? Did she have to struggle too?</p><p>Heaving\na sigh, it tossed the blonde inside the room. She stumbled and landed on the\nfloor in a starfish like position. The Winter Flower barely held back its\nsnort. It was amusing how <i>weak</i> some\nof these girls were despite growing up in The Red Room. It knew now wasn\u2019t a\ntime to play games and honestly, it didn\u2019t even want to. Taking out the 9mm\npistol it always carried, it weighted the gun in its hands before firing a single\nshot. It rang through the small lightless room. For good measure it shot the\ngirl again to make sure she wouldn\u2019t get up and live. Disobeying was bad\nenough, but to actually fail to complete what it was asked to do? Madame B\nwould single handedly murder it, if its handlers wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Just\nto make sure she was really dead, it held its fingers by the blond\u2019s pulse\npoint. When it didn\u2019t find anything, it headed for the door, only to stop short\nat the sight of the red headed girl. Her head was tilted curiously. \u201c<i>Why did you kill her?</i>\u201d the girl, not\nolder than 15, asked. Her Russian was pronounced without care, but it was her curiosity\nthat puzzled The Winter Flower.</p><p>\u201c<i>You know why.</i>\u201d It drawled back. The red\nhead\u2019s face betrayed no emotion, though her eyes seemed to flash with\nirritation, long enough for it to detect.</p><p>\u201c<i>No, I know why she had to die. What I\u2019m\nasking is why did</i> you<i> kill her?</i>\u201d The\nWinter Flower paused. The question seemed to confuse it. Did it not have to\nkill the blond girl? Did it mistake Madame B\u2019s orders?</p><p>\u201c<i>I don\u2019t understand</i>,\u201d it replied,\nconfusion and panic seeping into its voice.</p><p>\u201c<i>I guessed you wouldn\u2019t</i>.\u201d And that was\nit.</p><p>As\nyears passed inside The Red Room and the red head, Natalia progressed without\nproblem, both The Winter Flower and Natalia grew closer. Never could it answer\nher question and never did Natalia ask again.</p><p>As the\ncentury was drawing to a close, The Winter Flower was returned to Hydra.</p><p>It\nnever saw Natalia again, and on the rare occasion it remembered the calculating\nred head a terrible feeling of loss overtook it, making it wish Natalia\nRomanova was alright, where ever she might be.</p><p>* * *</p><p><i>1998, NYC, America</i></p><p>A puff of cold air sprung free from the man\u2019s lungs as he\nmoved through Central Park, occasionally hiding in the shadows. It had been a\nfew years since his escape, but he still couldn\u2019t shake the feeling he was\nwatched and followed every time he so much as stepped outside. He supposed it\nwas quite possible, with all the traffic cameras surrounding almost every\ncorner you could turn. New York City was a bad place to hide, but he knew that\nwould also make his captors less likely to look there.</p><p>He was moving towards the building where his old buddy was\ncurrently living in. Though he had no recollection of what had happened between\nthem in the past, he knew they were close by the small memory snippets that had\nappeared over time. In those memories, as hazy as they were, he had been a\nconstant.</p><p>As soon as it had come to his attention about two and a half\nyears ago, he had felt something shift. His mind was all jumbled, but he hoped\nhe could get help through his old best friend. He hoped they would find what\nthey once had. He also wished to help the woman in his dreams. He couldn\u2019t\nquite identify who she was, only a name whispered in a night of comfort and\nlove came to his mind.</p><p><i>Natasha</i>.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know was this woman alive still, but his dreams\nhad conjured up her in the goddamn awful Chair. It would make him lose his mind\ncompletely as he slipped into The Winter Soldier mode, as he\u2019d take to calling\nit. Sometimes -though it was lessening as he became more lucid- he would slip\ninto that mode, waking up days later not knowing who he\u2019d hurt or what had\nhappened. It was a hellish nightmare.</p><p>So that was why he was here, standing in front of the SHIELD\napartment where Steve Rogers lived in. He hoped Steve really was here and not\non some SHIELD mission. As quick as that thought came, a clear picture of a\nskinny blonde boy arguing with him about going to war appeared. James barely\nheld back his gasp at the pain that followed. Suddenly it seemed like a bad\nidea to even be in the vicinity of him. That doubt disappeared immediately as\nhe realized this was the clearest memory he has had in years. </p><p>Falling back on old training, James slipped into the\nbuilding, keeping his ears and eyes carefully open. His watchful eyes flickered\nback and forth on ever single detail he could get. The lobby was painted a\nwashed-out light blue. It wasn\u2019t as in-your-face as one would expect. The bland\nand colourless deco complimented the bright walls nicely. And while there was a\nbunch of sofas and chairs in one of the corners, they seemed a bit dusty like\nno-one had sat there in a while. Suspicion flared and James\u2019 hand slipped into\nhis pocket to grab the trusty knife he\u2019d had for years, if not decades. He\nstrained his ears, hoping to hear something. When nothing was there to be\nheard, he continued towards the lift. </p><p>His left metallic hand hovered over the call button. Quickly\ndeciding that the stairs were safer, incase of ambush, he headed to the other\nside of the room towards the stairwell. His neck prickled at the silence. It\nwas unnerving. Silent as a ghost, he trudged up the stairs. </p><p>Steve\u2019s apartment was on the third floor. The second floor\nwould not be a place where he would linger for long. Despite being silent, he\nmoved as quick as lightning. On the right side of the stairs was three doors.\nThe silent and empty corridor had hairs on his arms standing up. He quickly\nstalked towards the doors. The door on the right and closest to the stairs had\nlight music coming from inside. The door on the left remained silent. And the middle\ndoor, Steve\u2019s door, was silent as well.</p><p>Knowing the dangers of knocking on his door, James quietly\nslipped out his knife, taking out the hair pin that was hidden in the handle.\nAs quiet as possible, he slowly started to feel out the lock. In seconds he had\nthe door unlocked. By now he was quite sure Steve knew that someone was\nbreaking into his apartment.</p><p>The door opened with a slight screech that made James\ngrimace. He could hear deep concentrated breathing, he could hear Steve.\nCursing his stupidity of coming here when he was home. He stepped inside and\nlike he expected, the shield was flying towards him. He quickly turned to the\nside, his hair slapping into his face, and grabbed the shield with his metallic\narm. The clank rang through the apartment and corridor. He grinned at Steve and\ncould hear how he stopped breathing.</p><p><i>\u201cBucky?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cGuess, I should\u2019ve knocked.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Hours and many explanations later, Steve was still staring\nat James like he was seeing a ghost. He supposed he was one. All Steve had\nknown was that he had died in the Alps in the forties. It was quite sad to see\nSteve reaching for Bucky, when all he could give him was James. He understood\nit. For Steve it had been only a couple of years, but for him it had been more\nthan 50 years. James knew he understood that there was no more of \u2018Bucky\u2019, but\nhad a hard time realizing what it actually meant.</p><p>\u201cI-uh,\u201d Steve stumbled over his words in the living room they\nwere sitting in. James turned towards him, his question clear in his eyes. Steve\u2019s\neyes suddenly glinted with unshed tears and he seemed to choke on his words. It\nregarded James with surprise. He had never seen his best friend so pained. \u201cThey\ntold me-\u201d Steve\u2019s tears flowed down his cheeks and the ragged breath he took in\nmade James almost flinch.</p><p>Quickly, he scampered up from his seat across from Steve and\ntook the shivering man into his arms. \u201cI thought I had lost you, too!\u201d Steve\nsuddenly cried out, and this time he flinched from the loudness by his ear. Nevertheless,\nhe didn\u2019t take his arms away from the hug as the blonde clinged to him. After\nwhat felt like hours, Steve lessened his deathly grip on James and dragged his\nsleeves across his face. He muttered an, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d before he released him\ncompletely.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you sorry for, you punk?\u201d James asked him\nin a quite murmur. Steve\u2019s eyes grew unfocused for a moment, before he smiled at\nhis old friend.</p><p>\u201cFor breaking apart like that. I just- ah, remembered\nsomething I found out.\u201d Steve smiled a self-decrepitating smile. It soon turned\ninto a grimace.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna tell me what it was?\u201d James asked carefully,\nstepping back to stare at his friend. The blonde\u2019s face went through a bath of\nemotions, before settling on a horribly broken look.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ah, it\u2019s about Natasha.\u201d Steve finally said, although\nvery carefully. The name launched an assault of images of cold nights with soft\nvoices and naked bodies, of gruesome murders and painful punishments, the image\nof screaming, hot and pain- Like doused with cold water, James\u2019 head arose from\nthe assault.</p><p>After a while of calming himself down and placing a\ncarefully constructed mask of curiosity, he asked, \u201cNatasha who?\u201d Steve\u2019s eyes\ngrew stormy and his eyebrows pinched together, like he was disappointed that James\nwouldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cMy Natasha. Stark? Natasha Antonia Stark?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice\nwas wavering, and he felt worried the blonde would burst into another set of\ntears. God, Steve\u2019s girlfriend, James suddenly remembered with clarity. She\nmust be in her seventies.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d James breathed out. \u201cI remember her. Is she alright?\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes glistened again, and his jaw clenched so tight\nJames could hear the screech of his teeth. \u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d The simple statement\nmade it feel like someone had punched him in the gut. He couldn\u2019t imagine- oh,\nSteve. \u201cS-She died in 1949. L-lab accident, a building collapsed on her and her\nteam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d James breathed out. \u201cGod, that\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-Not only did she have to deal with me being gone and the\naftermath of the war, she hadn\u2019t even lived to 25, B-James.\u201d James felt his\nbreathing catch in his throat, and he had to swallow multiple times to rid of\nthe lump in his throat. \u00a0\u201cOh, Howard must\u2019ve\nbeen so broken. He l-loved her so much. How couldn\u2019t anyone love that woman?\u201d</p><p>Howard Stark, Maria Stark, 1991, December 16<sup>th</sup>, dispose\nof Howard, retrieve the serum, kill possible witnesses. <i>\u201c\u2026Winter Soldier Program reactivated\u2026\u201d</i> James hissed at the pain. He\ncouldn\u2019t help but fall to his knees on the hardwood floor. Everything around\nhim went dark for a second, before he startled with a gasp. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky?\u201d Steve asked tentatively. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Steve,\u201d he gasped out. \u201cOh, God. I killed him!\u201d</p><p>A thunderous expression overtook Steve\u2019s features as he\ngrabbed James\u2019 hands. He pulled them away from the painful grip they had on his\nhair. \u201cJames.\u201d The stern voice froze him completely. The only telltale sign of\nhis panic was the harsh breathing. \u201cYou might\u2019ve delivered the death sentence,\nbut it wasn\u2019t your choice. You were only protecting yourself, no-one would\nexpect anything less. <i>It wasn\u2019t you</i>.\u201d</p><p>Oh, how he wanted to believe Steve\u2019s precious words. \u201cBut I\nstill did <i>it</i>,\u201d James hissed as he\nwrenched himself free and retreated to a corner. Steve continued his thunderous\ngaze on him, but an understanding dawned upon him. He could understand why\nJames felt the way he did.</p><p>It could be compared to what Steve had to go through when he\ngot soldiers killed on the field. He didn\u2019t do all he could. His careful\nplanning only went so far. But for James it was so much worse. It wasn\u2019t his\nordering of troops that got them killed, but his very own hands, controlled by\nthe hands of others.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I came here,\u201d James informed him after minutes of\nsilent glaring. \u201cI need help. Professional help. But not from SHIELD.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust them.\u201d James opted for.</p><p>\u201cWell, do you trust me?\u201d Steve asked him. Did he <i>trust</i> him? No, James didn\u2019t trust him.\nIt didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he answered truthfully. After a beat he\nadded, \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s smile was slightly bitter.</p>",

It would make him lose his mind\ncompletely as he slipped into The Winter Soldier mode, as he\u2019d take to calling\nit. Sometimes -though it was lessening as he became more lucid- he would slip\ninto that mode, waking up days later not knowing who he\u2019d hurt or what had\nhappened. It was a hellish nightmare.</p><p>So that was why he was here, standing in front of the SHIELD\napartment where Steve Rogers lived in. He hoped Steve really was here and not\non some SHIELD mission. As quick as that thought came, a clear picture of a\nskinny blonde boy arguing with him about going to war appeared. James barely\nheld back his gasp at the pain that followed. Suddenly it seemed like a bad\nidea to even be in the vicinity of him. That doubt disappeared immediately as\nhe realized this was the clearest memory he has had in years. </p><p>Falling back on old training, James slipped into the\nbuilding, keeping his ears and eyes carefully open. His watchful eyes flickered\nback and forth on ever single detail he could get. The lobby was painted a\nwashed-out light blue. It wasn\u2019t as in-your-face as one would expect. The bland\nand colourless deco complimented the bright walls nicely. And while there was a\nbunch of sofas and chairs in one of the corners, they seemed a bit dusty like\nno-one had sat there in a while. Suspicion flared and James\u2019 hand slipped into\nhis pocket to grab the trusty knife he\u2019d had for years, if not decades. He\nstrained his ears, hoping to hear something. When nothing was there to be\nheard, he continued towards the lift. </p><p>His left metallic hand hovered over the call button. Quickly\ndeciding that the stairs were safer, incase of ambush, he headed to the other\nside of the room towards the stairwell. His neck prickled at the silence. It\nwas unnerving. Silent as a ghost, he trudged up the stairs. </p><p>Steve\u2019s apartment was on the third floor. The second floor\nwould not be a place where he would linger for long. Despite being silent, he\nmoved as quick as lightning. On the right side of the stairs was three doors.\nThe silent and empty corridor had hairs on his arms standing up. He quickly\nstalked towards the doors. The door on the right and closest to the stairs had\nlight music coming from inside. The door on the left remained silent. And the middle\ndoor, Steve\u2019s door, was silent as well.</p><p>Knowing the dangers of knocking on his door, James quietly\nslipped out his knife, taking out the hair pin that was hidden in the handle.\nAs quiet as possible, he slowly started to feel out the lock. In seconds he had\nthe door unlocked. By now he was quite sure Steve knew that someone was\nbreaking into his apartment.</p><p>The door opened with a slight screech that made James\ngrimace. He could hear deep concentrated breathing, he could hear Steve.\nCursing his stupidity of coming here when he was home. He stepped inside and\nlike he expected, the shield was flying towards him. He quickly turned to the\nside, his hair slapping into his face, and grabbed the shield with his metallic\narm. The clank rang through the apartment and corridor. He grinned at Steve and\ncould hear how he stopped breathing.</p><p><i>\u201cBucky?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cGuess, I should\u2019ve knocked.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Hours and many explanations later, Steve was still staring\nat James like he was seeing a ghost. He supposed he was one. All Steve had\nknown was that he had died in the Alps in the forties. It was quite sad to see\nSteve reaching for Bucky, when all he could give him was James. He understood\nit. For Steve it had been only a couple of years, but for him it had been more\nthan 50 years. James knew he understood that there was no more of \u2018Bucky\u2019, but\nhad a hard time realizing what it actually meant.</p><p>\u201cI-uh,\u201d Steve stumbled over his words in the living room they\nwere sitting in. James turned towards him, his question clear in his eyes. Steve\u2019s\neyes suddenly glinted with unshed tears and he seemed to choke on his words. It\nregarded James with surprise. He had never seen his best friend so pained. \u201cThey\ntold me-\u201d Steve\u2019s tears flowed down his cheeks and the ragged breath he took in\nmade James almost flinch.</p><p>Quickly, he scampered up from his seat across from Steve and\ntook the shivering man into his arms. \u201cI thought I had lost you, too!\u201d Steve\nsuddenly cried out, and this time he flinched from the loudness by his ear. Nevertheless,\nhe didn\u2019t take his arms away from the hug as the blonde clinged to him. After\nwhat felt like hours, Steve lessened his deathly grip on James and dragged his\nsleeves across his face. He muttered an, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d before he released him\ncompletely.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you sorry for, you punk?\u201d James asked him\nin a quite murmur. Steve\u2019s eyes grew unfocused for a moment, before he smiled at\nhis old friend.</p><p>\u201cFor breaking apart like that. I just- ah, remembered\nsomething I found out.\u201d Steve smiled a self-decrepitating smile. It soon turned\ninto a grimace.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna tell me what it was?\u201d James asked carefully,\nstepping back to stare at his friend. The blonde\u2019s face went through a bath of\nemotions, before settling on a horribly broken look.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ah, it\u2019s about Natasha.\u201d Steve finally said, although\nvery carefully. The name launched an assault of images of cold nights with soft\nvoices and naked bodies, of gruesome murders and painful punishments, the image\nof screaming, hot and pain- Like doused with cold water, James\u2019 head arose from\nthe assault.</p><p>After a while of calming himself down and placing a\ncarefully constructed mask of curiosity, he asked, \u201cNatasha who?\u201d Steve\u2019s eyes\ngrew stormy and his eyebrows pinched together, like he was disappointed that James\nwouldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cMy Natasha. Stark? Natasha Antonia Stark?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice\nwas wavering, and he felt worried the blonde would burst into another set of\ntears. God, Steve\u2019s girlfriend, James suddenly remembered with clarity. She\nmust be in her seventies.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d James breathed out. \u201cI remember her. Is she alright?\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes glistened again, and his jaw clenched so tight\nJames could hear the screech of his teeth. \u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d The simple statement\nmade it feel like someone had punched him in the gut. He couldn\u2019t imagine- oh,\nSteve. \u201cS-She died in 1949. L-lab accident, a building collapsed on her and her\nteam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d James breathed out. \u201cGod, that\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-Not only did she have to deal with me being gone and the\naftermath of the war, she hadn\u2019t even lived to 25, B-James.\u201d James felt his\nbreathing catch in his throat, and he had to swallow multiple times to rid of\nthe lump in his throat. \u00a0\u201cOh, Howard must\u2019ve\nbeen so broken. He l-loved her so much. How couldn\u2019t anyone love that woman?\u201d</p><p>Howard Stark, Maria Stark, 1991, December 16<sup>th</sup>, dispose\nof Howard, retrieve the serum, kill possible witnesses. <i>\u201c\u2026Winter Soldier Program reactivated\u2026\u201d</i> James hissed at the pain. He\ncouldn\u2019t help but fall to his knees on the hardwood floor. Everything around\nhim went dark for a second, before he startled with a gasp. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky?\u201d Steve asked tentatively. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Steve,\u201d he gasped out. \u201cOh, God. I killed him!\u201d</p><p>A thunderous expression overtook Steve\u2019s features as he\ngrabbed James\u2019 hands. He pulled them away from the painful grip they had on his\nhair. \u201cJames.\u201d The stern voice froze him completely. The only telltale sign of\nhis panic was the harsh breathing. \u201cYou might\u2019ve delivered the death sentence,\nbut it wasn\u2019t your choice. You were only protecting yourself, no-one would\nexpect anything less. <i>It wasn\u2019t you</i>.\u201d</p><p>Oh, how he wanted to believe Steve\u2019s precious words. \u201cBut I\nstill did <i>it</i>,\u201d James hissed as he\nwrenched himself free and retreated to a corner. Steve continued his thunderous\ngaze on him, but an understanding dawned upon him. He could understand why\nJames felt the way he did.</p><p>It could be compared to what Steve had to go through when he\ngot soldiers killed on the field. He didn\u2019t do all he could. His careful\nplanning only went so far. But for James it was so much worse. It wasn\u2019t his\nordering of troops that got them killed, but his very own hands, controlled by\nthe hands of others.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I came here,\u201d James informed him after minutes of\nsilent glaring. \u201cI need help. Professional help. But not from SHIELD.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust them.\u201d James opted for.</p><p>\u201cWell, do you trust me?\u201d Steve asked him. Did he <i>trust</i> him? No, James didn\u2019t trust him.\nIt didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he answered truthfully. After a beat he\nadded, \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s smile was slightly bitter.</p>",

While the melody was soothing, it appeared that the girls\nwere anything but. Many faces were twisted in pain. It was expected, they had\nbeen dancing for hours. Yet only one girl, hair fire engine red, kept her face\nimpassive, not willing -or unable- to feel anything. Her movements were cold\nand left The Winter Flower feeling like it was watching ice claim warm waters. Despite\nthat it was intrigued by the young girl.</p><p>&ldquo;Faster.&rdquo;\nMadame B&rsquo;s voice rang through the room and with one word the whole room spurred\nto a faster speed in order to survive. One of the girls, a blonde, was\nbreathing hard and unable to keep up with the others&rsquo; speed. A sliver of pity ignited\nin The Winter Flower. </p><p>The ballet\nwas as beautiful as a dead body bleeding out in the middle of winter. It made The\nWinter Flower want to flee, but that would ensure a punishment. Unfortunately, in\nHydra lending it to the KGB the deal never contained in what condition it were\nto be returned to her handlers, only that it were to be alive. </p><p>Suddenly\nthe blonde crashed. No-one stopped. They were very well aware of what were to\nhappen if they did. Madame B clicked her tongue and it was moving. Few long\nstrides and it had the girl supported up by her armpit. &ldquo;Dispose her.&rdquo;</p><p>With\na nod it left the room. The young girl was trashing in its hold. &ldquo;Please!\nPlease don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; The blond yelled in despair, &ldquo;I promise I&rsquo;ll be better!&rdquo;\nDisappointment and disgust arose in it as the blond girl started screeching and\ncrying. Wasn&rsquo;t it enough it had to do this? Did she have to struggle too?</p><p>Heaving\na sigh, it tossed the blonde inside the room. She stumbled and landed on the\nfloor in a starfish like position. The Winter Flower barely held back its\nsnort. It was amusing how <i>weak</i> some\nof these girls were despite growing up in The Red Room. It knew now wasn&rsquo;t a\ntime to play games and honestly, it didn&rsquo;t even want to. Taking out the 9mm\npistol it always carried, it weighted the gun in its hands before firing a single\nshot. It rang through the small lightless room. For good measure it shot the\ngirl again to make sure she wouldn&rsquo;t get up and live. Disobeying was bad\nenough, but to actually fail to complete what it was asked to do? Madame B\nwould single handedly murder it, if its handlers wouldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Just\nto make sure she was really dead, it held its fingers by the blond&rsquo;s pulse\npoint. When it didn&rsquo;t find anything, it headed for the door, only to stop short\nat the sight of the red headed girl. Her head was tilted curiously. &ldquo;<i>Why did you kill her?</i>&rdquo; the girl, not\nolder than 15, asked. Her Russian was pronounced without care, but it was her curiosity\nthat puzzled The Winter Flower.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You know why.</i>&rdquo; It drawled back. The red\nhead&rsquo;s face betrayed no emotion, though her eyes seemed to flash with\nirritation, long enough for it to detect.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No, I know why she had to die. What I&rsquo;m\nasking is why did</i> you<i> kill her?</i>&rdquo; The\nWinter Flower paused. The question seemed to confuse it. Did it not have to\nkill the blond girl? Did it mistake Madame B&rsquo;s orders?</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t understand</i>,&rdquo; it replied,\nconfusion and panic seeping into its voice.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I guessed you wouldn&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo; And that was\nit.</p><p>As\nyears passed inside The Red Room and the red head, Natalia progressed without\nproblem, both The Winter Flower and Natalia grew closer. Never could it answer\nher question and never did Natalia ask again.</p><p>As the\ncentury was drawing to a close, The Winter Flower was returned to Hydra.</p><p>It\nnever saw Natalia again, and on the rare occasion it remembered the calculating\nred head a terrible feeling of loss overtook it, making it wish Natalia\nRomanova was alright, where ever she might be.</p><p>* * *</p><p><i>1998, NYC, America</i></p><p>A puff of cold air sprung free from the man&rsquo;s lungs as he\nmoved through Central Park, occasionally hiding in the shadows. It had been a\nfew years since his escape, but he still couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling he was\nwatched and followed every time he so much as stepped outside. He supposed it\nwas quite possible, with all the traffic cameras surrounding almost every\ncorner you could turn. New York City was a bad place to hide, but he knew that\nwould also make his captors less likely to look there.</p><p>He was moving towards the building where his old buddy was\ncurrently living in. Though he had no recollection of what had happened between\nthem in the past, he knew they were close by the small memory snippets that had\nappeared over time. In those memories, as hazy as they were, he had been a\nconstant.</p><p>As soon as it had come to his attention about two and a half\nyears ago, he had felt something shift. His mind was all jumbled, but he hoped\nhe could get help through his old best friend. He hoped they would find what\nthey once had. He also wished to help the woman in his dreams. He couldn&rsquo;t\nquite identify who she was, only a name whispered in a night of comfort and\nlove came to his mind.</p><p><i>Natasha</i>.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know was this woman alive still, but his dreams\nhad conjured up her in the goddamn awful Chair.

It was something Tony had noticed over the last year since the whole Vulture fiasco. They had been in a fairly nice apartment when he&rsquo;d first come to recruit the girl which, by the way, had been kind of a hard sell. Still, the apartment had been small, but it was New York so that hadn&rsquo;t exactly been strange. It was neat and tidy. Lived in, but nothing had been dirty. He&rsquo;d caught sight of a wedding photo and a picture of Penny between her aunt and the man who must have been her uncle. But then he&rsquo;d been offered a walnut date loaf and Tony Stark was many things but rude to women inviting him into their homes and offering him homemade food was not one of them. So he&rsquo;d suffered through several bites of loaf and had let himself get distracted.</p><p>The first time they&rsquo;d moved had been right after Penny had returned home from Germany, but the Avengers had been in shambles and Tony hadn&rsquo;t paid all that much attention. Happy was the one in charge of keeping an eye on the girl anyway and had mentioned in passing that she lived a few blocks away from her old apartment. He hadn&rsquo;t given that much thought&hellip;Happy had also mentioned that it was a nice place and the kid seemed safe, so he hadn&rsquo;t said anything about it. Also, he&rsquo;d been trying to keep his distance. The girl was sweet. She was innocent and a little naive, and he hadn&rsquo;t wanted to ruin any of that.</p><p>Of course, he&rsquo;d found out pretty quickly that keeping his distance wasn&rsquo;t going to work, thus the offer of a real internship. Well&hellip;more of a mentorship. He called every week or so, had her over every month to check up on her suit and install upgrades and generally just make sure she was okay.</p><p>Once a month had soon turned into twice a month, which had turned into every weekend. The kid had a way of getting under his skin. Because she was sweet and innocent and a little naive, but also brave. So, so brave. And good. And smart. One of the smartest kids he&rsquo;d never met. She could keep up with him in the lab, and she looked at him like&hellip;like he&rsquo;d saved her life. Like she owed it all to him when really, she would have gotten there on her own eventually. It would have just taken her a little longer. So he&rsquo;d stepped in. Given her the resources she&rsquo;d needed.</p><p>But she could have done it without him.</p><p>Still, this kid liked him. She&rsquo;d been in his lab with him and worked with him&hellip;eaten dinner with him and Pepper and had then chosen to spend even more time with him. That hadn&rsquo;t happened all that often in his life and\u2026</p><p>He brushed the thought away as he stared at the chair where, up until five minutes ago, his intern had sat, working on her webshooters. She&rsquo;d been quiet. And Penny Parker was never quiet. Penny Parker was bright eyes and stupid jokes and giggling at his own stupid jokes. She was telling him all about her day and offering him a glass of water when she got herself one and asking him science question after science question that he was always more than happy to answer. But today&hellip;today had been different.</p><!-- more --><p>She&rsquo;d arrived right on time, thanks to Happy, but had been&hellip;subdued. Practically on mute. Sure, she&rsquo;d smiled at him and sure, she&rsquo;d been wearing a t-shirt with Thor on it, and of course, she&rsquo;d laughed a little when he&rsquo;d teased her about it, but she hadn&rsquo;t been the same. And alarm bells had started to go off. &ldquo;Kid?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d asked, a few minutes later. She&rsquo;d gotten right to work, pulling her webshooters out of her backpack and handing him the suit. &ldquo;You good?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh? Yeah.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d given him a weak smile&hellip;the kind of smile that didn&rsquo;t get anywhere near her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? &lsquo;Cause usually you&rsquo;re about fifteen minutes into the essay on how your day has been by now.&rdquo; He had cursed himself almost as soon as the words had come out of her mouth, not wanting to hurt her feelings or make her think that he didn&rsquo;t want to hear all about her day. Because he did. But at the moment, he was worried.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;uh&hellip;my day was fine.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d told him, shrugging. &ldquo;Boring.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;d gotten a closer look then, leaning in, and she&rsquo;d looked back up at him with the same dead smile. Her eyes had been dull, underscored by dark shadows, face pale. &ldquo;Are you feeling okay?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d asked, knowing he was pushing.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; She had given a weak laugh. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been sick since the bite.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d hummed, turning back to her suit, but Penny hadn&rsquo;t gotten back to the webshooters right away. Instead, she&rsquo;d run a hand over her face, blinking heavily, then yawning before getting back to her tinkering.</p><p>He&rsquo;d pushed again a few minutes later after she&rsquo;d yawned again. &ldquo;You staying out too late to patrol?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;no, we uh&hellip;I was up late last night because we moved and&hellip;and we have to unpack everything.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d frowned at that, remembering that they&rsquo;d just moved apartments less than a year ago.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Everything okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah&hellip;the uh&hellip;the rent went up so\u2026&rdquo; She had shrugged, seeming a little embarrassed. He had decided to brush past that, not wanting to embarrass her even more.</p><p>&ldquo;Is the new place far from the old one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d shrugged again. &ldquo;A few blocks. But\u2026&rdquo; And she&rsquo;d started to tell him. She&rsquo;d opened her mouth to say something. But then Friday had butted in.</p><p>&ldquo;Boss, you have an incoming call from Pepper Potts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call her right back.&rdquo;</p><p>And that had been that, but the girl had gone back to staring at her webshooters. &ldquo;Sorry about that kid. What were you saying?&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;d given him a brief smile, barely looking up from her webshooters. &ldquo;Oh. Just, uh&hellip;it&rsquo;s kind of small. But it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p><p>And he&rsquo;d stopped pushing. But as soon as she&rsquo;d gone, he&rsquo;d told Friday to bring up her new address, the names of every person in that building, and the landlord. Sadly, he hadn&rsquo;t been able to find much. Names, sure. And a couple of DUI&rsquo;s on a couple of the other residents&hellip;it was a six story walk up, which must suck for her aunt, but Penny hadn&rsquo;t complained about it&hellip;just mentioned that it was small.</p><p>Maybe he was being paranoid. Maybe&hellip;maybe nothing was wrong. Maybe she was just tired.</p><p>Then he got a text from her four days later. &ldquo;Could you please pick me up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; He answered immediately, jumping up from his desk where he&rsquo;d been filling out some paperwork and racing toward the garage.</p><p>Penny had never, not once, in the history of their relationship, asked him for something like that. Once, she&rsquo;d fallen off a roof and broken her ankle, and he&rsquo;d had to find out from Karen who had overruled Penny&rsquo;s many, many pleas not to call him. &ldquo;School.&rdquo; Was the one-word response he received.</p><p>Okay. So she was at school&hellip;it was 7:45&hellip;school had started less than an hour ago&hellip;he didn&rsquo;t ask any questions. instead, he sent a quick &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there as fast as I can&rdquo; and he&rsquo;d driven as fast as possible without getting caught.</p><p>Pulling up outside the school, he&rsquo;d hesitated, then pulled out his phone again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>And then she appeared from around the corner, hood up, hands shoved in her pockets, head down. &ldquo;Kid?&rdquo; He asked. &ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; She sniffed a little.</p><p>&ldquo;May&rsquo;s at work and&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;I\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s fine, kid. I don&rsquo;t mind picking you up. Here.&rdquo; He opened the passenger side door and tried to catch a glimpse of her face. She kept her head down though, turning slightly away from him. So he climbed in the driver&rsquo;s side, pulling out of the parking lot before another thought occurred to him. &ldquo;Does the school know where you are?&rdquo; She hesitated, then shook her head. &ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Sighing, he pulled out his phone. &ldquo;Friday, call May Parker and inform her that Penny is sick and that I&rsquo;m taking her home. See if she can call the school.&rdquo; With that, he set the phone down.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, I&rsquo;m really\u2026&rdquo;. He held up a hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry, kid. It&rsquo;s no problem.&rdquo; She opened her mouth, then closed it with an audible click, lowering her head once more. She was tense&hellip;obviously waiting for a dressing down or an interrogation. And that&rsquo;s exactly what Howard would have given him.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t Howard.</p><p>So he turned on the radio as he drove to the tower, pulling into the garage in comfortable silence, then parking the car by the door. It wasn&rsquo;t until they stepped onto his floor of the tower, both of them moving to the living room, that he gestured to the sofa and finally spoke. &ldquo;Take a seat, kid.&rdquo; He offered, and she did, curling up in the corner of the couch. He took the seat beside her, hoping he wasn&rsquo;t too close. That he wasn&rsquo;t overstepping. &ldquo;So\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can just go home\u2026&rdquo;. She murmured. He shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go anywhere, Pen. Are you sick?&rdquo; She just shrugged, hood still up, face down. &ldquo;You cold?&rdquo; He asked, making his voice light, but she sniffed and he felt his heart clenched, sure he looked like a deer in the headlights. &ldquo;Penny?&rdquo;</p><p>Then, reaching out with unsteady hands, he pushed her hood back, stomach dropping when he got it past her hair.</p><p>The makeup barely covered the bruises. Her eye was swelling&hellip;makeup couldn&rsquo;t hide that. Her lip had been busted open, and there was a cut on her cheek. These bruises hadn&rsquo;t happened on patrol, because had some random criminal somehow managed to beat the shit out of her, Friday would have informed him.</p><p>His brain put it all together in seconds, during which she refused to meet his eyes.</p><p>One. Someone had beaten her. Two. She&rsquo;d allowed it, which meant she must have been in her civilian clothes. Three. Those were fresh bruises, eye still swelling. It had happened sometime within the last few hours. Four. Tony was going to make someone pay.</p><p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; He asked, voice almost flat. She clenched her jaw.</p><p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t happen again. It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Penny.&rdquo; He warned. Like a dad. His own dad had used that tone, so to soften the warning, he reached out, resting a hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;C'mon, honey.&rdquo;</p><p>Penny hesitated for a long time&hellip;so long that Tony nearly gave up. But then she spoke, voice barely a whisper. &ldquo;May&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He thought he might throw up. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;no I mean&hellip;I was&hellip;I was trying to protect May.&rdquo; She swallowed hard. &ldquo;And Flash\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait this happened at school?&rdquo; He cried, incredulous, and she shook her head, lips trembling, and he squeezed her shoulder, leaning in to meet her eye. They were red-rimmed under the bruises, pleading. &ldquo;Okay&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry. No more interrupting. What happened.&rdquo;</p><p>She took a deep breath, hands tight in her lap as she stared down at them. That was fine. She didn&rsquo;t have to look at him. &ldquo;Flash saw&hellip;we were in the hall and I thought I&rsquo;d covered it up in the bathroom but I couldn&rsquo;t and he saw my face and&hellip;he got kind of freaked out and asked what had happened and\u2026&rdquo;.</p><p>Well, that was a surprise. The little bully was usually more likely to make fun of her but apparently, even he had been concerned.</p><p>&ldquo;We had to move into this new place.&rdquo; She started again, hands tight in her lap. He sat back, literally biting his tongue and warning himself to just listen. &ldquo;The other landlord jacked up the rent and we couldn&rsquo;t afford it anymore, so May found this new apartment and we moved in&hellip;the guy that owns it said he&rsquo;d give us a deal for the first month.&rdquo; She shrugged. &ldquo;May didn&rsquo;t tell me much. But&hellip;he&rsquo;s&hellip;he was trying to get her to go out with him and&hellip;and she said no and then he changed the deal and she had to pay more\u2026&rdquo;.</p><p>Tony clenched his hands into fists at his sides. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do anything to her&hellip;but she left early this morning and I woke up and he was beating on the door&hellip;I think he thought she was still home. Then he unlocked the door and came in\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He came into your apartment?&rdquo; He repeated, not loving his angry the question sounded but he couldn&rsquo;t help it. Some man had walked into Penny&rsquo;s apartment when she&rsquo;d been home alone. And yeah, she was Spidergirl. She was strong and could take care of herself when it came to criminals on the street. But that was her home! And she should feel safe in her own home. She was just a kid, for crying out loud.</p><p>&ldquo;I told him to get out&hellip;tried to push him out but\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He hurt you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I let him.&rdquo; She hurried to remind him. &ldquo;I could have stopped him but I couldn&rsquo;t let him&hellip;I couldn&rsquo;t let him find out.&rdquo; She told him softly. &ldquo;He&hellip;he was yelling about rent and asking where May was&hellip;I loved him back and he hit me. I couldn&rsquo;t fight back and let him know who I was so\u2026&rdquo; She trailed off, bringing a finger up to her cheek and wiping her eye. He scooted forward, reaching out an arm and wrapping it hesitantly around her. &ldquo;I tried to cover it up with makeup but Flash saw and\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hate to break this to you, Spiderling, but makeup isn&rsquo;t going to cover that up.&rdquo; He brought a careful finger up to brush it over her the bruise on her cheek. &ldquo;Did he leave? After he hit you?&rdquo; She nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;he hit me a couple of times and then&hellip;he told me I&rsquo;d better not tell anyone.&rdquo; He clenched his jaw and the girl hurried to apologize because, for some reason, she thought that everything was her fault. Was it possible that they were related? Because they certainly had that in common. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;I should\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. My turn.&rdquo; He murmured. &ldquo;Okay. Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do. You&rsquo;re going to wash your face, and then we&rsquo;ll take care of the cuts. Then, I&rsquo;m going to call May\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; He ignored her outburst, going on as if she hadn&rsquo;t spoken.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to call May and tell her that I&rsquo;m going to help you find a new apartment. A nice apartment. In a safe neighborhood. That you won&rsquo;t have to move out of after a few months if the rent goes up. I&rsquo;ll get my guys to help you move your stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Stark, you don&rsquo;t have to\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Consider it an internship perk.&rdquo; He waved her off, standing and pointing down the hall. &ldquo;Go. Clean up, then we&rsquo;ll make sure those cuts don&rsquo;t get infected. They should be healed by tomorrow&hellip;or at least look a lot better, but either way, we have to tell May. She needs to know what happened, and then Pepper and I will help you find a new apartment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go on, Spiderling.&rdquo; He urged, holding a hand out and pulling her to her feet, then gave her a push toward the hallway. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get this taken care of.&rdquo; But in the meantime, he was going to take care of that asshole.</p><p>Pulling out his phone, he sent a message to Rhodey. &ldquo;Hey, honeybear. Wanna help me intimidate an asshole later?&rdquo;</p><p>The response took about a minute as he pulled out a first aid kit from the kitchen counter. &ldquo;Tones, you know we can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes. &ldquo;He broke into my fifteen-year-old intern&rsquo;s apartment and beat the shit out of her.&rdquo;</p><p>This time, the reply was immediate. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>",

It was something Tony had noticed over the last year since the whole Vulture fiasco. They had been in a fairly nice apartment when he\u2019d first come to recruit the girl which, by the way, had been kind of a hard sell. Still, the apartment had been small, but it was New York so that hadn\u2019t exactly been strange. It was neat and tidy. Lived in, but nothing had been dirty. He\u2019d caught sight of a wedding photo and a picture of Penny between her aunt and the man who must have been her uncle. But then he\u2019d been offered a walnut date loaf and Tony Stark was many things but rude to women inviting him into their homes and offering him homemade food was not one of them. So he\u2019d suffered through several bites of loaf and had let himself get distracted.</p><p>The first time they\u2019d moved had been right after Penny had returned home from Germany, but the Avengers had been in shambles and Tony hadn\u2019t paid all that much attention. Happy was the one in charge of keeping an eye on the girl anyway and had mentioned in passing that she lived a few blocks away from her old apartment. He hadn\u2019t given that much thought\u2026Happy had also mentioned that it was a nice place and the kid seemed safe, so he hadn\u2019t said anything about it. Also, he\u2019d been trying to keep his distance. The girl was sweet. She was innocent and a little naive, and he hadn\u2019t wanted to ruin any of that.</p><p>Of course, he\u2019d found out pretty quickly that keeping his distance wasn\u2019t going to work, thus the offer of a real internship. Well\u2026more of a mentorship. He called every week or so, had her over every month to check up on her suit and install upgrades and generally just make sure she was okay.</p><p>Once a month had soon turned into twice a month, which had turned into every weekend. The kid had a way of getting under his skin. Because she was sweet and innocent and a little naive, but also brave. So, so brave. And good. And smart. One of the smartest kids he\u2019d never met. She could keep up with him in the lab, and she looked at him like\u2026like he\u2019d saved her life. Like she owed it all to him when really, she would have gotten there on her own eventually. It would have just taken her a little longer. So he\u2019d stepped in. Given her the resources she\u2019d needed.</p><p>But she could have done it without him.</p><p>Still, this kid liked him. She\u2019d been in his lab with him and worked with him\u2026eaten dinner with him and Pepper and had then chosen to spend even more time with him. That hadn\u2019t happened all that often in his life and\u2026</p><p>He brushed the thought away as he stared at the chair where, up until five minutes ago, his intern had sat, working on her webshooters. She\u2019d been quiet. And Penny Parker was never quiet. Penny Parker was bright eyes and stupid jokes and giggling at his own stupid jokes. She was telling him all about her day and offering him a glass of water when she got herself one and asking him science question after science question that he was always more than happy to answer. But today\u2026today had been different.</p>[[MORE]]<p>She\u2019d arrived right on time, thanks to Happy, but had been\u2026subdued. Practically on mute. Sure, she\u2019d smiled at him and sure, she\u2019d been wearing a t-shirt with Thor on it, and of course, she\u2019d laughed a little when he\u2019d teased her about it, but she hadn\u2019t been the same. And alarm bells had started to go off. \u201cKid?\u201d He\u2019d asked, a few minutes later. She\u2019d gotten right to work, pulling her webshooters out of her backpack and handing him the suit. \u201cYou good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Yeah.\u201d She\u2019d given him a weak smile\u2026the kind of smile that didn\u2019t get anywhere near her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah? \u2018Cause usually you\u2019re about fifteen minutes into the essay on how your day has been by now.\u201d He had cursed himself almost as soon as the words had come out of her mouth, not wanting to hurt her feelings or make her think that he didn\u2019t want to hear all about her day. Because he did. But at the moment, he was worried.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026uh\u2026my day was fine.\u201d She\u2019d told him, shrugging. \u201cBoring.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gotten a closer look then, leaning in, and she\u2019d looked back up at him with the same dead smile. Her eyes had been dull, underscored by dark shadows, face pale. \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d He\u2019d asked, knowing he was pushing.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She had given a weak laugh. \u201cI haven\u2019t been sick since the bite.\u201d He\u2019d hummed, turning back to her suit, but Penny hadn\u2019t gotten back to the webshooters right away. Instead, she\u2019d run a hand over her face, blinking heavily, then yawning before getting back to her tinkering.</p><p>He\u2019d pushed again a few minutes later after she\u2019d yawned again. \u201cYou staying out too late to patrol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026no, we uh\u2026I was up late last night because we moved and\u2026and we have to unpack everything.\u201d He\u2019d frowned at that, remembering that they\u2019d just moved apartments less than a year ago.</p><p>\u201cReally? Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah\u2026the uh\u2026the rent went up so\u2026\u201d She had shrugged, seeming a little embarrassed. He had decided to brush past that, not wanting to embarrass her even more.</p><p>\u201cIs the new place far from the old one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She\u2019d shrugged again. \u201cA few blocks. But\u2026\u201d And she\u2019d started to tell him. She\u2019d opened her mouth to say something. But then Friday had butted in.</p><p>\u201cBoss, you have an incoming call from Pepper Potts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her right back.\u201d</p><p>And that had been that, but the girl had gone back to staring at her webshooters. \u201cSorry about that kid. What were you saying?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d given him a brief smile, barely looking up from her webshooters. \u201cOh. Just, uh\u2026it\u2019s kind of small. But it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d stopped pushing. But as soon as she\u2019d gone, he\u2019d told Friday to bring up her new address, the names of every person in that building, and the landlord. Sadly, he hadn\u2019t been able to find much. Names, sure. And a couple of DUI\u2019s on a couple of the other residents\u2026it was a six story walk up, which must suck for her aunt, but Penny hadn\u2019t complained about it\u2026just mentioned that it was small.</p><p>Maybe he was being paranoid. Maybe\u2026maybe nothing was wrong. Maybe she was just tired.</p><p>Then he got a text from her four days later. \u201cCould you please pick me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d He answered immediately, jumping up from his desk where he\u2019d been filling out some paperwork and racing toward the garage.</p><p>Penny had never, not once, in the history of their relationship, asked him for something like that. Once, she\u2019d fallen off a roof and broken her ankle, and he\u2019d had to find out from Karen who had overruled Penny\u2019s many, many pleas not to call him. \u201cSchool.\u201d Was the one-word response he received.</p><p>Okay. So she was at school\u2026it was 7:45\u2026school had started less than an hour ago\u2026he didn\u2019t ask any questions. instead, he sent a quick \u201cI\u2019ll be there as fast as I can\u201d and he\u2019d driven as fast as possible without getting caught.</p><p>Pulling up outside the school, he\u2019d hesitated, then pulled out his phone again. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>And then she appeared from around the corner, hood up, hands shoved in her pockets, head down. \u201cKid?\u201d He asked. \u201cYou alright?\u201d She sniffed a little.</p><p>\u201cMay\u2019s at work and\u2026I\u2019m sorry\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s fine, kid. I don\u2019t mind picking you up. Here.\u201d He opened the passenger side door and tried to catch a glimpse of her face. She kept her head down though, turning slightly away from him. So he climbed in the driver\u2019s side, pulling out of the parking lot before another thought occurred to him. \u201cDoes the school know where you are?\u201d She hesitated, then shook her head. \u201cRight.\u201d Sighing, he pulled out his phone. \u201cFriday, call May Parker and inform her that Penny is sick and that I\u2019m taking her home. See if she can call the school.\u201d With that, he set the phone down.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I\u2019m really\u2026\u201d. He held up a hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, kid. It\u2019s no problem.\u201d She opened her mouth, then closed it with an audible click, lowering her head once more. She was tense\u2026obviously waiting for a dressing down or an interrogation. And that\u2019s exactly what Howard would have given him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t Howard.</p><p>So he turned on the radio as he drove to the tower, pulling into the garage in comfortable silence, then parking the car by the door. It wasn\u2019t until they stepped onto his floor of the tower, both of them moving to the living room, that he gestured to the sofa and finally spoke. \u201cTake a seat, kid.\u201d He offered, and she did, curling up in the corner of the couch. He took the seat beside her, hoping he wasn\u2019t too close. That he wasn\u2019t overstepping. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can just go home\u2026\u201d. She murmured. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go anywhere, Pen. Are you sick?\u201d She just shrugged, hood still up, face down. \u201cYou cold?\u201d He asked, making his voice light, but she sniffed and he felt his heart clenched, sure he looked like a deer in the headlights. \u201cPenny?\u201d</p><p>Then, reaching out with unsteady hands, he pushed her hood back, stomach dropping when he got it past her hair.</p><p>The makeup barely covered the bruises. Her eye was swelling\u2026makeup couldn\u2019t hide that. Her lip had been busted open, and there was a cut on her cheek. These bruises hadn\u2019t happened on patrol, because had some random criminal somehow managed to beat the shit out of her, Friday would have informed him.</p><p>His brain put it all together in seconds, during which she refused to meet his eyes.</p><p>One. Someone had beaten her. Two. She\u2019d allowed it, which meant she must have been in her civilian clothes. Three. Those were fresh bruises, eye still swelling. It had happened sometime within the last few hours. Four. Tony was going to make someone pay.</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d He asked, voice almost flat. She clenched her jaw.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny.\u201d He warned. Like a dad. His own dad had used that tone, so to soften the warning, he reached out, resting a hand on her shoulder. \u201cC'mon, honey.\u201d</p><p>Penny hesitated for a long time\u2026so long that Tony nearly gave up. But then she spoke, voice barely a whisper. \u201cMay\u2026\u201d</p><p>He thought he might throw up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026no I mean\u2026I was\u2026I was trying to protect May.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cAnd Flash\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait this happened at school?\u201d He cried, incredulous, and she shook her head, lips trembling, and he squeezed her shoulder, leaning in to meet her eye. They were red-rimmed under the bruises, pleading. \u201cOkay\u2026I\u2019m sorry. No more interrupting. What happened.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, hands tight in her lap as she stared down at them. That was fine. She didn\u2019t have to look at him. \u201cFlash saw\u2026we were in the hall and I thought I\u2019d covered it up in the bathroom but I couldn\u2019t and he saw my face and\u2026he got kind of freaked out and asked what had happened and\u2026\u201d.</p><p>Well, that was a surprise. The little bully was usually more likely to make fun of her but apparently, even he had been concerned.</p><p>\u201cWe had to move into this new place.\u201d She started again, hands tight in her lap. He sat back, literally biting his tongue and warning himself to just listen. \u201cThe other landlord jacked up the rent and we couldn\u2019t afford it anymore, so May found this new apartment and we moved in\u2026the guy that owns it said he\u2019d give us a deal for the first month.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cMay didn\u2019t tell me much. But\u2026he\u2019s\u2026he was trying to get her to go out with him and\u2026and she said no and then he changed the deal and she had to pay more\u2026\u201d.</p><p>Tony clenched his hands into fists at his sides. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything to her\u2026but she left early this morning and I woke up and he was beating on the door\u2026I think he thought she was still home. Then he unlocked the door and came in\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came into your apartment?\u201d He repeated, not loving his angry the question sounded but he couldn\u2019t help it. Some man had walked into Penny\u2019s apartment when she\u2019d been home alone. And yeah, she was Spidergirl. She was strong and could take care of herself when it came to criminals on the street. But that was her home! And she should feel safe in her own home. She was just a kid, for crying out loud.</p><p>\u201cI told him to get out\u2026tried to push him out but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let him.\u201d She hurried to remind him. \u201cI could have stopped him but I couldn\u2019t let him\u2026I couldn\u2019t let him find out.\u201d She told him softly. \u201cHe\u2026he was yelling about rent and asking where May was\u2026I loved him back and he hit me. I couldn\u2019t fight back and let him know who I was so\u2026\u201d She trailed off, bringing a finger up to her cheek and wiping her eye. He scooted forward, reaching out an arm and wrapping it hesitantly around her. \u201cI tried to cover it up with makeup but Flash saw and\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to break this to you, Spiderling, but makeup isn\u2019t going to cover that up.\u201d He brought a careful finger up to brush it over her the bruise on her cheek. \u201cDid he leave? After he hit you?\u201d She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026he hit me a couple of times and then\u2026he told me I\u2019d better not tell anyone.\u201d He clenched his jaw and the girl hurried to apologize because, for some reason, she thought that everything was her fault. Was it possible that they were related? Because they certainly had that in common. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026I should\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. My turn.\u201d He murmured. \u201cOkay. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re going to wash your face, and then we\u2019ll take care of the cuts. Then, I\u2019m going to call May\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He ignored her outburst, going on as if she hadn\u2019t spoken.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to call May and tell her that I\u2019m going to help you find a new apartment. A nice apartment. In a safe neighborhood. That you won\u2019t have to move out of after a few months if the rent goes up. I\u2019ll get my guys to help you move your stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Stark, you don\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it an internship perk.\u201d He waved her off, standing and pointing down the hall. \u201cGo. Clean up, then we\u2019ll make sure those cuts don\u2019t get infected. They should be healed by tomorrow\u2026or at least look a lot better, but either way, we have to tell May. She needs to know what happened, and then Pepper and I will help you find a new apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, Spiderling.\u201d He urged, holding a hand out and pulling her to her feet, then gave her a push toward the hallway. \u201cWe\u2019ll get this taken care of.\u201d But in the meantime, he was going to take care of that asshole.</p><p>Pulling out his phone, he sent a message to Rhodey. \u201cHey, honeybear. Wanna help me intimidate an asshole later?\u201d</p><p>The response took about a minute as he pulled out a first aid kit from the kitchen counter. \u201cTones, you know we can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes. \u201cHe broke into my fifteen-year-old intern\u2019s apartment and beat the shit out of her.\u201d</p><p>This time, the reply was immediate. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p>",

But today\u2026today had been different.</p>[[MORE]]<p>She\u2019d arrived right on time, thanks to Happy, but had been\u2026subdued. Practically on mute. Sure, she\u2019d smiled at him and sure, she\u2019d been wearing a t-shirt with Thor on it, and of course, she\u2019d laughed a little when he\u2019d teased her about it, but she hadn\u2019t been the same. And alarm bells had started to go off. \u201cKid?\u201d He\u2019d asked, a few minutes later. She\u2019d gotten right to work, pulling her webshooters out of her backpack and handing him the suit. \u201cYou good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Yeah.\u201d She\u2019d given him a weak smile\u2026the kind of smile that didn\u2019t get anywhere near her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah? \u2018Cause usually you\u2019re about fifteen minutes into the essay on how your day has been by now.\u201d He had cursed himself almost as soon as the words had come out of her mouth, not wanting to hurt her feelings or make her think that he didn\u2019t want to hear all about her day. Because he did. But at the moment, he was worried.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026uh\u2026my day was fine.\u201d She\u2019d told him, shrugging. \u201cBoring.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gotten a closer look then, leaning in, and she\u2019d looked back up at him with the same dead smile. Her eyes had been dull, underscored by dark shadows, face pale. \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d He\u2019d asked, knowing he was pushing.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She had given a weak laugh. \u201cI haven\u2019t been sick since the bite.\u201d He\u2019d hummed, turning back to her suit, but Penny hadn\u2019t gotten back to the webshooters right away. Instead, she\u2019d run a hand over her face, blinking heavily, then yawning before getting back to her tinkering.</p><p>He\u2019d pushed again a few minutes later after she\u2019d yawned again. \u201cYou staying out too late to patrol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026no, we uh\u2026I was up late last night because we moved and\u2026and we have to unpack everything.\u201d He\u2019d frowned at that, remembering that they\u2019d just moved apartments less than a year ago.</p><p>\u201cReally? Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah\u2026the uh\u2026the rent went up so\u2026\u201d She had shrugged, seeming a little embarrassed. He had decided to brush past that, not wanting to embarrass her even more.</p><p>\u201cIs the new place far from the old one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She\u2019d shrugged again. \u201cA few blocks. But\u2026\u201d And she\u2019d started to tell him. She\u2019d opened her mouth to say something. But then Friday had butted in.</p><p>\u201cBoss, you have an incoming call from Pepper Potts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her right back.\u201d</p><p>And that had been that, but the girl had gone back to staring at her webshooters. \u201cSorry about that kid. What were you saying?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d given him a brief smile, barely looking up from her webshooters. \u201cOh. Just, uh\u2026it\u2019s kind of small. But it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d stopped pushing. But as soon as she\u2019d gone, he\u2019d told Friday to bring up her new address, the names of every person in that building, and the landlord. Sadly, he hadn\u2019t been able to find much. Names, sure. And a couple of DUI\u2019s on a couple of the other residents\u2026it was a six story walk up, which must suck for her aunt, but Penny hadn\u2019t complained about it\u2026just mentioned that it was small.</p><p>Maybe he was being paranoid. Maybe\u2026maybe nothing was wrong. Maybe she was just tired.</p><p>Then he got a text from her four days later. \u201cCould you please pick me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d He answered immediately, jumping up from his desk where he\u2019d been filling out some paperwork and racing toward the garage.</p><p>Penny had never, not once, in the history of their relationship, asked him for something like that. Once, she\u2019d fallen off a roof and broken her ankle, and he\u2019d had to find out from Karen who had overruled Penny\u2019s many, many pleas not to call him. \u201cSchool.\u201d Was the one-word response he received.</p><p>Okay. So she was at school\u2026it was 7:45\u2026school had started less than an hour ago\u2026he didn\u2019t ask any questions. instead, he sent a quick \u201cI\u2019ll be there as fast as I can\u201d and he\u2019d driven as fast as possible without getting caught.</p><p>Pulling up outside the school, he\u2019d hesitated, then pulled out his phone again. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>And then she appeared from around the corner, hood up, hands shoved in her pockets, head down. \u201cKid?\u201d He asked. \u201cYou alright?\u201d She sniffed a little.</p><p>\u201cMay\u2019s at work and\u2026I\u2019m sorry\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s fine, kid. I don\u2019t mind picking you up. Here.\u201d He opened the passenger side door and tried to catch a glimpse of her face. She kept her head down though, turning slightly away from him. So he climbed in the driver\u2019s side, pulling out of the parking lot before another thought occurred to him. \u201cDoes the school know where you are?\u201d She hesitated, then shook her head. \u201cRight.\u201d Sighing, he pulled out his phone. \u201cFriday, call May Parker and inform her that Penny is sick and that I\u2019m taking her home. See if she can call the school.\u201d With that, he set the phone down.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I\u2019m really\u2026\u201d. He held up a hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, kid. It\u2019s no problem.\u201d She opened her mouth, then closed it with an audible click, lowering her head once more. She was tense\u2026obviously waiting for a dressing down or an interrogation. And that\u2019s exactly what Howard would have given him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t Howard.</p><p>So he turned on the radio as he drove to the tower, pulling into the garage in comfortable silence, then parking the car by the door. It wasn\u2019t until they stepped onto his floor of the tower, both of them moving to the living room, that he gestured to the sofa and finally spoke. \u201cTake a seat, kid.\u201d He offered, and she did, curling up in the corner of the couch. He took the seat beside her, hoping he wasn\u2019t too close. That he wasn\u2019t overstepping. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can just go home\u2026\u201d. She murmured. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go anywhere, Pen. Are you sick?\u201d She just shrugged, hood still up, face down. \u201cYou cold?\u201d He asked, making his voice light, but she sniffed and he felt his heart clenched, sure he looked like a deer in the headlights. \u201cPenny?\u201d</p><p>Then, reaching out with unsteady hands, he pushed her hood back, stomach dropping when he got it past her hair.</p><p>The makeup barely covered the bruises. Her eye was swelling\u2026makeup couldn\u2019t hide that. Her lip had been busted open, and there was a cut on her cheek. These bruises hadn\u2019t happened on patrol, because had some random criminal somehow managed to beat the shit out of her, Friday would have informed him.</p><p>His brain put it all together in seconds, during which she refused to meet his eyes.</p><p>One. Someone had beaten her. Two. She\u2019d allowed it, which meant she must have been in her civilian clothes. Three. Those were fresh bruises, eye still swelling. It had happened sometime within the last few hours. Four. Tony was going to make someone pay.</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d He asked, voice almost flat. She clenched her jaw.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny.\u201d He warned. Like a dad. His own dad had used that tone, so to soften the warning, he reached out, resting a hand on her shoulder. \u201cC'mon, honey.\u201d</p><p>Penny hesitated for a long time\u2026so long that Tony nearly gave up. But then she spoke, voice barely a whisper. \u201cMay\u2026\u201d</p><p>He thought he might throw up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026no I mean\u2026I was\u2026I was trying to protect May.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cAnd Flash\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait this happened at school?\u201d He cried, incredulous, and she shook her head, lips trembling, and he squeezed her shoulder, leaning in to meet her eye. They were red-rimmed under the bruises, pleading. \u201cOkay\u2026I\u2019m sorry. No more interrupting. What happened.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, hands tight in her lap as she stared down at them. That was fine. She didn\u2019t have to look at him. \u201cFlash saw\u2026we were in the hall and I thought I\u2019d covered it up in the bathroom but I couldn\u2019t and he saw my face and\u2026he got kind of freaked out and asked what had happened and\u2026\u201d.</p><p>Well, that was a surprise. The little bully was usually more likely to make fun of her but apparently, even he had been concerned.</p><p>\u201cWe had to move into this new place.\u201d She started again, hands tight in her lap. He sat back, literally biting his tongue and warning himself to just listen. \u201cThe other landlord jacked up the rent and we couldn\u2019t afford it anymore, so May found this new apartment and we moved in\u2026the guy that owns it said he\u2019d give us a deal for the first month.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cMay didn\u2019t tell me much. But\u2026he\u2019s\u2026he was trying to get her to go out with him and\u2026and she said no and then he changed the deal and she had to pay more\u2026\u201d.</p><p>Tony clenched his hands into fists at his sides. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything to her\u2026but she left early this morning and I woke up and he was beating on the door\u2026I think he thought she was still home. Then he unlocked the door and came in\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came into your apartment?\u201d He repeated, not loving his angry the question sounded but he couldn\u2019t help it. Some man had walked into Penny\u2019s apartment when she\u2019d been home alone. And yeah, she was Spidergirl. She was strong and could take care of herself when it came to criminals on the street. But that was her home! And she should feel safe in her own home. She was just a kid, for crying out loud.</p><p>\u201cI told him to get out\u2026tried to push him out but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let him.\u201d She hurried to remind him. \u201cI could have stopped him but I couldn\u2019t let him\u2026I couldn\u2019t let him find out.\u201d She told him softly. \u201cHe\u2026he was yelling about rent and asking where May was\u2026I loved him back and he hit me. I couldn\u2019t fight back and let him know who I was so\u2026\u201d She trailed off, bringing a finger up to her cheek and wiping her eye. He scooted forward, reaching out an arm and wrapping it hesitantly around her. \u201cI tried to cover it up with makeup but Flash saw and\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to break this to you, Spiderling, but makeup isn\u2019t going to cover that up.\u201d He brought a careful finger up to brush it over her the bruise on her cheek. \u201cDid he leave? After he hit you?\u201d She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026he hit me a couple of times and then\u2026he told me I\u2019d better not tell anyone.\u201d He clenched his jaw and the girl hurried to apologize because, for some reason, she thought that everything was her fault. Was it possible that they were related? Because they certainly had that in common. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026I should\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. My turn.\u201d He murmured. \u201cOkay. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re going to wash your face, and then we\u2019ll take care of the cuts. Then, I\u2019m going to call May\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He ignored her outburst, going on as if she hadn\u2019t spoken.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to call May and tell her that I\u2019m going to help you find a new apartment. A nice apartment. In a safe neighborhood. That you won\u2019t have to move out of after a few months if the rent goes up. I\u2019ll get my guys to help you move your stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Stark, you don\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it an internship perk.\u201d He waved her off, standing and pointing down the hall. \u201cGo. Clean up, then we\u2019ll make sure those cuts don\u2019t get infected. They should be healed by tomorrow\u2026or at least look a lot better, but either way, we have to tell May. She needs to know what happened, and then Pepper and I will help you find a new apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, Spiderling.\u201d He urged, holding a hand out and pulling her to her feet, then gave her a push toward the hallway. \u201cWe\u2019ll get this taken care of.\u201d But in the meantime, he was going to take care of that asshole.</p><p>Pulling out his phone, he sent a message to Rhodey. \u201cHey, honeybear. Wanna help me intimidate an asshole later?\u201d</p><p>The response took about a minute as he pulled out a first aid kit from the kitchen counter. \u201cTones, you know we can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes. \u201cHe broke into my fifteen-year-old intern\u2019s apartment and beat the shit out of her.\u201d</p><p>This time, the reply was immediate. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Day 8!! &nbsp;I won&rsquo;t be doing Day 9 but will be back for Day 10 :) &nbsp;Thank you so much to everyone who is reading and revieiwing!!! &nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Day 8: Bullied</b></p><p>Penny and May moved a lot. It was something Tony had noticed over the last year since the whole Vulture fiasco. They had been in a fairly nice apartment when he&rsquo;d first come to recruit the girl which, by the way, had been kind of a hard sell. Still, the apartment had been small, but it was New York so that hadn&rsquo;t exactly been strange. It was neat and tidy. Lived in, but nothing had been dirty. He&rsquo;d caught sight of a wedding photo and a picture of Penny between her aunt and the man who must have been her uncle. But then he&rsquo;d been offered a walnut date loaf and Tony Stark was many things but rude to women inviting him into their homes and offering him homemade food was not one of them. So he&rsquo;d suffered through several bites of loaf and had let himself get distracted.</p><p>The first time they&rsquo;d moved had been right after Penny had returned home from Germany, but the Avengers had been in shambles and Tony hadn&rsquo;t paid all that much attention. Happy was the one in charge of keeping an eye on the girl anyway and had mentioned in passing that she lived a few blocks away from her old apartment. He hadn&rsquo;t given that much thought&hellip;Happy had also mentioned that it was a nice place and the kid seemed safe, so he hadn&rsquo;t said anything about it. Also, he&rsquo;d been trying to keep his distance. The girl was sweet. She was innocent and a little naive, and he hadn&rsquo;t wanted to ruin any of that.</p><p>Of course, he&rsquo;d found out pretty quickly that keeping his distance wasn&rsquo;t going to work, thus the offer of a real internship. Well&hellip;more of a mentorship. He called every week or so, had her over every month to check up on her suit and install upgrades and generally just make sure she was okay.</p><p>Once a month had soon turned into twice a month, which had turned into every weekend. The kid had a way of getting under his skin. Because she was sweet and innocent and a little naive, but also brave. So, so brave. And good. And smart. One of the smartest kids he&rsquo;d never met. She could keep up with him in the lab, and she looked at him like&hellip;like he&rsquo;d saved her life. Like she owed it all to him when really, she would have gotten there on her own eventually. It would have just taken her a little longer. So he&rsquo;d stepped in. Given her the resources she&rsquo;d needed.</p><p>But she could have done it without him.</p><p>Still, this kid liked him. She&rsquo;d been in his lab with him and worked with him&hellip;eaten dinner with him and Pepper and had then chosen to spend even more time with him. That hadn&rsquo;t happened all that often in his life and&hellip;</p><p>He brushed the thought away as he stared at the chair where, up until five minutes ago, his intern had sat, working on her webshooters. She&rsquo;d been quiet. And Penny Parker was never quiet. Penny Parker was bright eyes and stupid jokes and giggling at his own stupid jokes. She was telling him all about her day and offering him a glass of water when she got herself one and asking him science question after science question that he was always more than happy to answer. But today&hellip;today had been different.</p><p>She&rsquo;d arrived right on time, thanks to Happy, but had been&hellip;subdued. Practically on mute.

But then she spoke, voice barely a whisper. &ldquo;May&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He thought he might throw up. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;no I mean&hellip;I was&hellip;I was trying to protect May.&rdquo; She swallowed hard. &ldquo;And Flash&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait this happened at school?&rdquo; He cried, incredulous, and she shook her head, lips trembling, and he squeezed her shoulder, leaning in to meet her eye. They were red-rimmed under the bruises, pleading. &ldquo;Okay&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry. No more interrupting. What happened.&rdquo;</p><p>She took a deep breath, hands tight in her lap as she stared down at them. That was fine. She didn&rsquo;t have to look at him. &ldquo;Flash saw&hellip;we were in the hall and I thought I&rsquo;d covered it up in the bathroom but I couldn&rsquo;t and he saw my face and&hellip;he got kind of freaked out and asked what had happened and&hellip;&rdquo;.</p><p>Well, that was a surprise. The little bully was usually more likely to make fun of her but apparently, even he had been concerned.</p><p>&ldquo;We had to move into this new place.&rdquo; She started again, hands tight in her lap. He sat back, literally biting his tongue and warning himself to just listen. &ldquo;The other landlord jacked up the rent and we couldn&rsquo;t afford it anymore, so May found this new apartment and we moved in&hellip;the guy that owns it said he&rsquo;d give us a deal for the first month.&rdquo; She shrugged. &ldquo;May didn&rsquo;t tell me much. But&hellip;he&rsquo;s&hellip;he was trying to get her to go out with him and&hellip;and she said no and then he changed the deal and she had to pay more&hellip;&rdquo;.</p><p>Tony clenched his hands into fists at his sides. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do anything to her&hellip;but she left early this morning and I woke up and he was beating on the door&hellip;I think he thought she was still home. Then he unlocked the door and came in&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He came into your apartment?&rdquo; He repeated, not loving his angry the question sounded but he couldn&rsquo;t help it. Some man had walked into Penny&rsquo;s apartment when she&rsquo;d been home alone. And yeah, she was Spidergirl. She was strong and could take care of herself when it came to criminals on the street. But that was her home! And she should feel safe in her own home. She was just a kid, for crying out loud.</p><p>&ldquo;I told him to get out&hellip;tried to push him out but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He hurt you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I let him.&rdquo; She hurried to remind him. &ldquo;I could have stopped him but I couldn&rsquo;t let him&hellip;I couldn&rsquo;t let him find out.&rdquo; She told him softly. &ldquo;He&hellip;he was yelling about rent and asking where May was&hellip;I loved him back and he hit me. I couldn&rsquo;t fight back and let him know who I was so&hellip;&rdquo; She trailed off, bringing a finger up to her cheek and wiping her eye. He scooted forward, reaching out an arm and wrapping it hesitantly around her. &ldquo;I tried to cover it up with makeup but Flash saw and&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hate to break this to you, Spiderling, but makeup isn&rsquo;t going to cover that up.&rdquo; He brought a careful finger up to brush it over her the bruise on her cheek. &ldquo;Did he leave? After he hit you?&rdquo; She nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;he hit me a couple of times and then&hellip;he told me I&rsquo;d better not tell anyone.&rdquo; He clenched his jaw and the girl hurried to apologize because, for some reason, she thought that everything was her fault. Was it possible that they were related? Because they certainly had that in common. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;I should&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. My turn.&rdquo; He murmured. &ldquo;Okay. Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do. You&rsquo;re going to wash your face, and then we&rsquo;ll take care of the cuts. Then, I&rsquo;m going to call May&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; He ignored her outburst, going on as if she hadn&rsquo;t spoken.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to call May and tell her that I&rsquo;m going to help you find a new apartment. A nice apartment. In a safe neighborhood. That you won&rsquo;t have to move out of after a few months if the rent goes up. I&rsquo;ll get my guys to help you move your stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Stark, you don&rsquo;t have to&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Consider it an internship perk.&rdquo; He waved her off, standing and pointing down the hall. &ldquo;Go. Clean up, then we&rsquo;ll make sure those cuts don&rsquo;t get infected. They should be healed by tomorrow&hellip;or at least look a lot better, but either way, we have to tell May. She needs to know what happened, and then Pepper and I will help you find a new apartment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go on, Spiderling.&rdquo; He urged, holding a hand out and pulling her to her feet, then gave her a push toward the hallway. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get this taken care of.&rdquo; But in the meantime, he was going to take care of that asshole.</p><p>Pulling out his phone, he sent a message to Rhodey. &ldquo;Hey, honeybear. Wanna help me intimidate an asshole later?&rdquo;</p><p>The response took about a minute as he pulled out a first aid kit from the kitchen counter. &ldquo;Tones, you know we can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes. &ldquo;He broke into my fifteen-year-old intern&rsquo;s apartment and beat the shit out of her.&rdquo;</p><p>This time, the reply was immediate. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>",

It was something Tony had noticed over the last year since the whole Vulture fiasco. They had been in a fairly nice apartment when he&rsquo;d first come to recruit the girl which, by the way, had been kind of a hard sell. Still, the apartment had been small, but it was New York so that hadn&rsquo;t exactly been strange. It was neat and tidy. Lived in, but nothing had been dirty. He&rsquo;d caught sight of a wedding photo and a picture of Penny between her aunt and the man who must have been her uncle. But then he&rsquo;d been offered a walnut date loaf and Tony Stark was many things but rude to women inviting him into their homes and offering him homemade food was not one of them. So he&rsquo;d suffered through several bites of loaf and had let himself get distracted.</p>\n<p>The first time they&rsquo;d moved had been right after Penny had returned home from Germany, but the Avengers had been in shambles and Tony hadn&rsquo;t paid all that much attention. Happy was the one in charge of keeping an eye on the girl anyway and had mentioned in passing that she lived a few blocks away from her old apartment. He hadn&rsquo;t given that much thought&hellip;Happy had also mentioned that it was a nice place and the kid seemed safe, so he hadn&rsquo;t said anything about it. Also, he&rsquo;d been trying to keep his distance. The girl was sweet. She was innocent and a little naive, and he hadn&rsquo;t wanted to ruin any of that.</p>\n<p>Of course, he&rsquo;d found out pretty quickly that keeping his distance wasn&rsquo;t going to work, thus the offer of a real internship. Well&hellip;more of a mentorship. He called every week or so, had her over every month to check up on her suit and install upgrades and generally just make sure she was okay.</p>\n<p>Once a month had soon turned into twice a month, which had turned into every weekend. The kid had a way of getting under his skin. Because she was sweet and innocent and a little naive, but also brave. So, so brave. And good. And smart. One of the smartest kids he&rsquo;d never met. She could keep up with him in the lab, and she looked at him like&hellip;like he&rsquo;d saved her life. Like she owed it all to him when really, she would have gotten there on her own eventually. It would have just taken her a little longer. So he&rsquo;d stepped in. Given her the resources she&rsquo;d needed.</p>\n<p>But she could have done it without him.</p>\n<p>Still, this kid liked him. She&rsquo;d been in his lab with him and worked with him&hellip;eaten dinner with him and Pepper and had then chosen to spend even more time with him. That hadn&rsquo;t happened all that often in his life and&hellip;</p>\n<p>He brushed the thought away as he stared at the chair where, up until five minutes ago, his intern had sat, working on her webshooters. She&rsquo;d been quiet. And Penny Parker was never quiet. Penny Parker was bright eyes and stupid jokes and giggling at his own stupid jokes. She was telling him all about her day and offering him a glass of water when she got herself one and asking him science question after science question that he was always more than happy to answer. But today&hellip;today had been different.</p>\n</p>",
